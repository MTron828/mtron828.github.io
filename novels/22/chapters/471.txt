Chapter 472: The missing military dagger (2)

Qin Xiaoyu stood up and turned around to glare at Xia ruofei. She shouted,””Xia ruofei!”

Xia ruofei walked over innocently and said,””What’s wrong?”

When he saw that the dagger had disappeared, his expression changed drastically and he shouted,””Officer Qin, where is my military dagger? Where did you hide it? Are you really going to confiscate it? You can’t do that, it’s very important to me ...”

In fact, Xia ruofei was already overjoyed. After he confirmed that Qin Xiao Yu had deliberately used the dagger to embarrass him, he had no intention of letting Qin Xiao Yu go.

Therefore, when Qin Xiao Yu was discussing Zhao he’s case with the police officers, he immediately recalled the dagger in Zhao he’s palm back into the spirit map space.

He was standing less than three meters away from Zhao he. With Xia ruofei’s concentration, he could easily retrieve the dagger from such a distance.

Xia ruofei was standing right behind Zhao he. There were two police officers beside him, but they had their backs to Zhao he as they were discussing the case. No one saw the military dagger being pulled out of Zhao he’s hand. Then, it was as if an invisible hand had pulled the dagger towards Xia ruofei, and it disappeared into Xia ruofei’s palm.

Qin Xiao Yu looked at Xia ruofei coldly and said,””Is there any meaning to this?”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, then said with a wronged expression,””What do you mean? Don’t tell me you thought I took the dagger?”

“Isn’t that so?” Qin Xiao Yu sneered and retorted.

“Nonsense! I’m a few meters away from him!” Xia ruofei said indignantly,”besides, I’m with your colleagues. You can ask them! Did I move or not?”

Perhaps Xia ruofei’s acting skills were too good, but Qin Xiao Yu was not so sure.

However, her instincts told her that it was Xia ruofei’s doing.

Qin Xiao Yu turned her eyes to Zhao he and asked coldly: “Did he come to your side just now?”

Zhao he’s face was pale from the blood loss. He looked at Xia ruofei with uncertainty and said,””I didn’t see clearly ...”

In fact, he knew very well that when the dagger was suddenly pulled out, he subconsciously screamed. However, it only took him a second or two at most before he turned around and saw that Xia ruofei was standing at the same place. He was quite far away from him too. In theory, it couldn’t be Xia ruofei.

However, the police were also far away from him. If it wasn’t Xia ruofei, who would be so bored?

Qin Xiao Yu glared at Zhao he with dissatisfaction, then looked at her subordinates and asked: “”Sun Hao, you were the closest to Xia ruofei. Did you see anything?”

Sun Hao hesitated for a moment, but he still said,””Captain Qin, he ... He didn’t move. He’s been standing in the same place.”

Qin Xiao Yu’s brows furrowed and she asked,”did you see it clearly?” Don’t talk nonsense if you didn’t see clearly!”

Sun Hao’s body trembled slightly and he avoided Qin Xiao Yu’s gaze. He immediately said without any principles,””I ... I’m not too sure.”

It could be seen that although Qin Xiao Yu was young, she had a lot of power in the police force ... No, she had a lot of prestige ...

Xia ruofei immediately protested,””Officer Qin! What’s the meaning of this? This police officer clearly testified for me, you’re using your power to oppress people!”

Qin Xiao Yu raised her chin and looked at Xia ruofei,””Then tell me where the dagger went. Don’t tell me it can grow wings and fly?”

“You’re asking me, but who am I supposed to ask!” Xia ruofei said unhappily,”I should be the one asking you! There are so many police officers here, and a dagger actually disappeared under your eyes. Do you know how important it is to me? Now that I’ve lost it, who am I going to find to compensate?”

Qin Xiaoyu was so angry that she clenched her teeth and her face was flushed red. She came to Sanshan city with a high degree of education and the Halo of the Ministry. Everything had been smooth, but she had been unable to do anything to Xia ruofei time and time again. She was quite mad.

The police officers looked at each other and couldn’t help but show a strange expression.

The young man in front of him was the first person who dared to speak to Captain Qin in this way. Captain Qin also seemed to have lost his usual calm and rationality. It was as if his emotions were easily driven by Xia ruofei and he was constantly losing control.

“You’re illegally possessing a controlled knife. It’s supposed to be confiscated!” Qin Xiao Yu twisted logic.

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”then you didn ‘t!” Oh right ... Do you want to search my body? You don’t even trust your own subordinates! Why don’t you just search it yourself!”

Xia ruofei opened his arms and looked like he was at her mercy.

Qin Xiao Yu’s cheeks blushed and she lowered her eyes,””Hooligan ...”

She, a Virgin, was going to search his body? Qin Xiao Yu was embarrassed and angry at the thought of the delicate hand touching his body.

The police were holding back their laughter. They all thought that Qin Xiao Yu and Xia ruofei were throwing a tantrum. Rather than saying that they were quarreling, it was more like flirting.

However, since he dared to flirt with Captain Qin, the police’s admiration for Xia ruofei was endless like the surging River ... T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

As for the dagger’s sudden disappearance, although it was a little strange, the police didn’t care about it. A few years back, people had a lot of air guns and even shotguns in their homes, not to mention this dagger.
