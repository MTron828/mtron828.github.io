2094 The young goose’s “exit”_2

Xia ruofei checked the missed calls and found that they were all from Ling Qingxue. The first call was from yesterday evening, the second was from around 10 p.m., And the rest were from the morning.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but worry. Ling Qingxue had called so many times. Could something have happened?

He hurriedly called Ling Qingxue back, and a monotonous ringing sound came from the phone. It rang for more than ten times before Ling Qingxue picked up the call.”Hey! You’ve finally appeared ...”

Xia ruofei could feel Ling Qingxue’s complaint, but he was slightly relieved. At least he could confirm that Ling Qingxue was not in any danger.

He smiled apologetically and said,”I’m sorry, Qingxue!” I’ve been busy with something these few days and I need to be absolutely focused, so I put my phone on silent and didn’t pick up your call ...”

“I thought you were playing a game of” disappear from the face of the earth “!” Ling Qingxue replied,”I’ve been calling you since last night ...”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”wife!” I’m sorry! I’m sorry ... By the way, something must have happened for you to look for me in such a hurry, right?”

Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”you’re really forgetful!” Have you forgotten what day it is today?”

Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat. Could it be some special anniversary or birthday that he had forgotten?

His mind was spinning quickly, but he could not figure out what day it was. Xia ruofei remembered clearly things like Ling Qingxue’s birthday and the anniversary of their official relationship. It was obviously not today.

“What day is it?” Xia ruofei asked guiltily.

Ling Qingxue said in a bad mood,”you really forgot!” The batch of young geese that you’ve spent so much effort to import from abroad will officially end your ‘closed – door cultivation’ today. I’m really impressed that you’ve forgotten about them ...”

Xia ruofei finally understood. He patted his head and laughed.”Look at my brain ... Qingxue, I’ve been so busy these past two days ...”

“I called you immediately after I received the notice from the Inspection and Quarantine Bureau yesterday,” Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”but no one picked up.” I called you many times this morning ... Xia ruofei, your performance was terrible!”

“Yes, yes, yes! It’s all my fault ...”Xia ruofei quickly apologized and continued,” then where are you now? I’ll drive back to the city right away. Let’s go and collect these precious young geese together!”

“I’ve been waiting for you ... It’s too late!” Ling Qingxue said,”I couldn’t contact you, so I came to pick them up myself! Anyway, I was the one who handled the procedures back then, so I just took my ID card and got it out!”

“You’ve brought all the young geese out?” Xia ruofei was overjoyed when he heard this. He quickly asked,”did you lose any young geese?”

“These little guys are very tenacious. I counted just now, and not a single one is missing!” Ling Qingxue said,”Oh right, quickly tell me where to send these things! There were 50 of them! I can’t bring it back to the company! I can’t raise them at home either ...”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”wife, I’ll send you the location right away. You can send this batch of young geese over!” I’ll rush over immediately. If you’re early, just wait for me here for a while!”

“Alright then!” Ling Qingxue said,”hurry up! I still have a lot of work to do in the company!”

“Alright! Alright!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll be right out!”

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei washed up in the bathroom. Then, without eating, she grabbed her handbag and rushed downstairs to the warehouse in the city.

When Xia ruofei arrived at the warehouse, Ling Qingxue was already waiting for him at the entrance. There was also a small truck next to it. There were about ten cages in it. The cages were all filled with the Strasburg geese that Xia ruofei had imported from Europe. There were about four to five geese in each cage.

Xia ruofei quickly pulled over and jogged towards Ling Qingxue.

“Qingxue, I’m so sorry! “I made you wait for me again ...” Xia ruofei said apologetically.

“I’m fine ... I just arrived a while ago!” Ling Qingxue said,”hurry up and open the warehouse door! I’m in a hurry to go back to the company!”

In reality, the quarantine area for the imported live animals was not far from the airport. After Ling Qingxue collected the batch of young geese, she called Xia ruofei on the way back. Her journey back to the city was similar to Xia ruofei’s journey from Tao Yuan farm to the city. Although she had set off earlier, she had hired a pickup truck, so the speed was not very fast. Therefore, the two of them arrived at the warehouse at about the same time.

Xia ruofei nodded and walked over to open the door.

Ling Qingxue did not hire a Porter, so Xia ruofei simply did it himself. Two baskets of geese at a time were gently loosened, and in a few moments, all the young geese were moved into the warehouse.

After Ling Qingxue sent the pickup away, she said to Xia ruofei,””Ruofei, I’ll go back to the company first!”

“Alright, alright!” Xia ruofei said,”it’s been hard on you, wife! Drive slowly on the road!”

“I know!” Ling Qingxue said. Just as she was about to leave, she turned around and said,”Oh right, my father asked you to come over to our house for dinner today! I was so busy just now that I almost forgot about this ...”

“Why would father – in – Law suddenly want to treat me to a meal?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“How am I supposed to know?” Ling Qingxue said unhappily,”just go and eat! Alright, I’ll be leaving first ... Remember to be there at 6 pm sharp!”

“Yes, sir!” Xia ruofei said.

After watching Ling Qingxue leave in her car, Xia ruofei returned to the warehouse.

This batch of young Strasburg geese seemed to be in good spirits. They must have been treated well in the quarantine area.

Without hesitation, Xia ruofei kept the young geese and the cage into the spirit map space.

He locked the warehouse door and drove back to Taoyuan farm.

After this round trip, it was almost time for lunch. Xia ruofei had not eaten or drunk anything for more than a day. Although he was not very hungry, he was drooling when he thought about the food made by Cao tieshu’s wife in the canteen. Thus, he went straight to the canteen and had lunch with the farm employees.

After returning to the small villa, Xia ruofei locked the doors and windows. Then, he took out the spirit map scroll from his palm and entered the medium with a thought.

“Master!” Xia Qing called out respectfully.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”did you see the geese I just sent in?” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing nodded.

“Do you have any way to make these geese suffer from the most severe fatty liver without suffering any pain?” Xia ruofei asked.

In fact, the delicious foie gras was, strictly speaking, the fatty liver of a goose.

“What’s a fatty liver, master?” Xia Qing asked with a blank expression.

“It’s a disease. But after geese get this disease, their livers will become more delicious!” Xia ruofei replied,”the liver is a type of organ. Its main function is to detoxify ...”

Xia ruofei’s voice became softer and softer as he spoke, and he didn’t think that Xia Qing could understand what he was saying.

Sure enough, Xia Qing said with an ashamed look,””I’m sorry, master. I don’t understand what you’re saying at all, and I can’t help you ...”

“It doesn’t matter, I’ll think of a way myself!” Xia ruofei said,”when you’re not working, you have to help take care of these young geese. Hmm ... Feed them once every ten hours or so! Let’s cut some grass to feed them first!”

“Understood!” Xia Qing replied without the slightest hesitation.

After Xia ruofei left the medium, he sat by the window of his bedroom and stared blankly at the lush farm outside. In fact, his mind was completely focused on the large number of Chinese medical books.

These were all the information contained in the Jade talisman of inheritance. Xia ruofei was basically reading the crystallization of the ancestors ‘wisdom in his mind. He wanted to find an effective way to let these Strasburg geese grow without pain and at the same time, form high – Quality foie gras.

Suddenly, Xia ruofei’s eyes lit up as an idea came to him ...
