Chapter 819: A wish.2

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei followed the trail leading to the park and walked up the mountain. After a while, he saw the road sign. There was a small path on the right that led to the cemetery of martyrs.

Xia ruofei followed the path for a few hundred meters and saw the entrance to the cemetery of martyrs.

In fact, at the foot of the mountain, there was an eye – catching monument. It was the monument of liberation. Around the monument were the tombs of the martyrs who had sacrificed themselves from the anti – puppet war and the liberation War to peaceful times.

There was a small house near the entrance of the cemetery of martyrs. An old man in his sixties came out of the house to dry his clothes. When he saw Xia ruofei, he put down his basin and walked over to ask Xia ruofei why he had come.

The old man was wearing a green military uniform from the 1980s, which had been washed until it was a little white. He was also wearing liberation shoes that had stopped production by the Army.

When he heard that Xia ruofei was squad leader Luo’s comrade – in – arms, he had come from another place to pay his respects to squad leader Luo. He suddenly became very enthusiastic and personally took Xia ruofei to squad leader Luo’s grave.

Not just anyone could be buried in this martyrs ‘Cemetery. It had to be a martyr officially recognized by the country, and generally, only martyrs with ancient yellow records would be buried here. Therefore, sometimes there might not be a new “resident” for one or two years, so the old man naturally had a deep impression of squad leader Luo, who had been buried not long ago.

The two of them talked as they walked. Xia ruofei also learned that the old man’s name was Luo Yuanshan’s Kasaya. Luo was a big family name in guhuang. Many of the kasayas who were born and raised in guhuang were once soldiers. They even participated in the border war in the 1980s. After they retired from the Army, they volunteered to guard the graves of the martyrs and had been there for more than 30 years. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei could not help but respect Luo Yuanshan.

Luo Yuanshan was quite strong, so he walked like a tiger and climbed the mountain at a fast speed.

Soon, he brought Xia ruofei to a new grave and said,””Little Luo, your comrade is here to see you ...”

“Thank you, uncle Luo,” Xia ruofei said politely.

Luo Yuanshan smiled at Xia ruofei and quietly retreated to a distance. He used to be a soldier, so he knew the friendship between comrades very well. He knew that Xia ruofei needed a quiet environment at this time.

Xia ruofei knelt down in front of the gravestone of old Luo and said to himself,””Class monitor Luo, I’m here to see you ...”

The gravestone was inlaid with a black – and – White photo of squad leader Luo in his military uniform. In the photo, he had a confident smile on his face.

The front of the grave was very clean. There were still some sticks left in the incense burner after the incense had been burned. There were two piles of dried candle oil on the altar in front of the tombstone.

Xia ruofei placed the offerings one by one on the altar, lit the candles, and started burning joss paper.

Xia ruofei drew two circles in front of the grave, one big and one small. First, he burned a few stacks of paper money in the small circle. This was also a Southern custom. These paper money were given to the land and passing ghosts. After they took the money, they would not fight with the class leader, old Luo.

The paper money in the big circle was naturally burned for squad leader Luo.

After Xia ruofei had burned all the paper money and ingots that he had brought, he carefully put out the remaining fire. There were plants everywhere in Xuanji Forest Park. If they were not handled carefully, it would be easy to cause a Mountain Fire.

Xia ruofei opened another bottle of Drunken Eight Immortals. He first filled the three glasses on the altar, then took out another glass and poured about 50 grams of white wine into it.

Xia ruofei took the cup and pointed it at the photo of squad leader Luo on the tombstone. He said,””Class monitor, I’ll give you a toast!”

After he finished speaking, Xia ruofei raised his head and finished the entire glass of wine. Then, he picked up three glasses from the altar and slowly poured the wine on the ground.

Xia ruofei said,”squad leader Luo, I’m going to your house to visit my sister – in – Law.” I hope sister – in – Law can accept the job I’m offering her, otherwise it’s too difficult for her to support a family on her own ... You know sister – in – Law the best, she’s very strong and refuses to accept the help of her comrades. You must bless me with a smooth trip! By the way, Nan Nan will be starting primary school soon. Don’t worry, as long as sister – in – Law is willing to work in Sanshan with me, I will definitely find the best school for Nan Nan to study in Sanshan ...”

Xia ruofei held a bottle of wine in one hand and sat in front of the grave of old Luo. His back was leaning against the grave and he was chatting casually.

From time to time, he would take a sip of wine from his cup. Of course, he did not forget to fill the cups on the altar with wine.

As Xia ruofei chatted, he started to talk about his days in the Army. He didn’t think much of the past when he was in the lone wolf assault team, but now that he thought about it, it became precious memories.

It was not until the sun had gradually set in the West and Xia ruofei’s shadow was gradually elongated that he let out a long sigh. He stood up and said,””Class monitor Luo, I still have to go to your house, so I won’t be able to accompany you today. I’ll come and visit you again when I have time in the future ...”

Xia ruofei slowly put the offerings into the bag and cleaned the grave of squad leader Luo before turning around.

At this moment, he realized that the old soldier Luo Zhiyuan had not left the tomb for the entire afternoon. He was sitting under a pine tree in the distance. When Luo Zhiyuan saw Xia ruofei leaving, he stood up.

“Master Luo, thank you ...” Xia ruofei said.

He had been chatting with squad leader Luo for so long that he had forgotten the time. He hadn’t expected this veteran to actually wait for an entire afternoon.
