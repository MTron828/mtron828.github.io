Chapter 174: Little Black’s counterattack (1)

Not long after Xia ruofei returned to his room, the Hengfeng Jiahua Hotel staff came to his door with a check. It was a total of 14 million Huaxia dollars. MA Xiong had helped to organize the auction tonight, including the final funds. He had converted the money to HxB according to the exchange rate of that day and paid Xia ruofei directly. However, under Xia ruofei’s strong request, the venue usage fees, the auctioneer’s remuneration, and other expenses were still paid as usual. The only difference was that the hotel had given Xia ruofei a big discount. The check could be redeemed at any time. After the staff left, Xia ruofei immediately summoned the spirit map scroll and put the check in the space. There was no safer place than this. Xia ruofei ordered the private butler of the Presidential Suite to forbid anyone from entering the room and then locked the door. To be on the safe side, he went straight to the bathroom attached to the master bedroom. After locking the door and pulling the curtains, he took out the spirit map scroll and entered the medium. Xia ruofei came to the original space and appeared beside the simple fence. When Blacky saw Xia ruofei, it immediately wagged its tail happily. Compared to when he first came in, little black had obviously grown a lot. More than two days had passed in the outside world, and it had already stayed in the original space for almost three months. It lived in an environment with dense spiritual energy every day, and the milk it drank contained flower petal solution. Naturally, it grew extremely fast. Xia ruofei noticed that most of the food he had prepared had been eaten up by Blackie. Xia ruofei opened the fence and Blackie immediately jumped out. It pounced on him and rubbed its face against Xia ruofei ‘s. It was very intimate with him. Xia ruofei had always been fond of Blackie. He reached out and patted Blackie’s head, chuckling.”Little guy, you must be very lonely these days!” Blackie could not understand Xia ruofei’s words and only whimpered. “You should be much smarter now!” Xia ruofei stood up and said with a smile,”come, Blackie. Roll three times on the ground!” Hearing that, Blackie rolled three times on the ground and wagged its tail at Xia ruofei. “Bring me that basin.” Xia ruofei pointed at the shallow basin that was filled with milk for black. Blackie immediately ran into the fence, held the basin in its mouth, and moved out. The basin was not small and it was not light either. With great difficulty, Blackie carried it to Xia ruofei’s side and barked twice, as if asking for credit. “Sure!” Xia ruofei was amused. He then gave xiaohei some relatively more complicated instructions and found that xiaohei could understand and execute them accurately. Xia ruofei made a comparison and felt that Blackie’s intelligence was comparable to lightning ‘s. It was probably because the spiritual Qi in the spirit map space was very rich. Blackie had stayed inside for much longer than lightning. This time, Xia ruofei was completely relieved. Time passed too quickly in the original space. Naturally, Xia ruofei could not let Blackie stay here for too long. He picked up Blackie and entered the new space with a thought. There were six other puppies in the new space. Since there was nothing here, they were all in a free – range state. The moment Xia ruofei appeared, he saw six puppies chasing each other on the grass. Because only a little more than two days had passed, these puppies naturally didn’t have any obvious changes. The weakest one, hairy six, was still walking unsteadily, swaying behind the puppies. Blackie also shook its head and looked at the puppies, then looked down at itself. It seemed to be wondering why its brothers and sisters didn’t grow taller ... But its limited spiritual intelligence obviously couldn’t understand this complicated problem. Xia ruofei smiled mischievously and put Blackie down. Woof! Woof! Woof! Blackie howled and ran towards fluffy one and fluffy two. If there’s a grudge, then take revenge! Its voice was full of energy and its speed was as fast as lightning. Xia ruofei could only see a black shadow flash by. After a while, Blackie had already arrived in front of fluffy one and fluffy two. The six puppies were all shocked. Seeing the fierce and powerful little black, who was a whole circle bigger than them, these puppies who had bullied little black very badly in the past, ran away in fear. Blackie jumped up and pressed er Mao, who was the slowest, to the ground with its paw. Er Mao immediately started wailing. Da Mao and the other four puppies only dared to bark from a distance, but they did not dare to take a step closer. They were even more unable to understand how Blackie, the weakest of them all, could grow so much in such a short time and become so awe – inspiring. Now, even if the six of them attacked together, they wouldn’t be enough to beat little black. Xia ruofei was also afraid that Blackie would hurt er Mao, so he quickly shouted,””Xiao hei, that’s enough. Let go of er Mao!” Blackie heard Xia ruofei’s voice and released his claws. As soon as er Mao regained its freedom, it immediately ran far away, looking back at Blackie from time to time, afraid that it would pounce on it again. “Alright! You’ve finally gotten your revenge!” Xia ruofei smiled.”Blackie, these are your brothers and sisters. You have to be a good boss in the future. Don’t bully them anymore, understand?” Blackie whimpered, indicating that it understood what Xia ruofei meant. Xia ruofei waved at Da Mao and ER Mao again. The six puppies looked at Blackie with lingering fear and did not dare to come over. The intelligence of these six little dogs was naturally far inferior to that of Blackie, so they were only dodging out of instinct. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. He said to Blackie,””Fine, you can go and conquer your little brothers yourself! Little black, go!” When Blackie heard this, it immediately jumped out excitedly. Xia ruofei shouted from behind,””Don’t hurt them!” Blacky barked twice and charged at the six puppies without looking back. The six dogs were scared out of their wits and began to run in all directions. But how could their small bodies outrun Blackie? Xia ruofei crossed his arms and stood at the side, watching the show. Blackie really showed off his power this time. It didn’t take long for him to lead the dejected fluffy one and fluffy two back. Blackie raised his head slightly, like a general who had returned in triumph. Fluffy one and fluffy two were in a sorry state. Their fur was messy and covered in dust. They looked like frosted eggplants. It was obvious that they had been subdued by Blackie in just a short time. Xia ruofei laughed,” That’s quite efficient! Little black, you’ll be their boss from now on, so don’t bully them anymore!” Blackie wagged its tail. Xia ruofei then said to fluffy one and fluffy two,””From now on, you’ll live here with Blackie. I’ll let you out when I need you. You’ll have to listen to Blackie’s orders here and don’t cause trouble, understand?” Da Mao and ER Mao were not very intelligent so they did not understand what Xia ruofei was saying. However, after Blacky’s deep roar, they trembled and quickly followed Blacky’s example, wagging their tails at Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei also laughed out loud. It seemed that Blackie was starting to act like a boss. Since he was not at home, Xia ruofei did not stay in the medium for long. He checked the puppies ‘food, opened another bag of dog food, and poured it into the big Basin. Then, Xia ruofei left the spirit map space in a flash after giving a few words to Blackie. After keeping the spirit map, Xia ruofei took a bath in the bathroom and went to sleep in the spacious master bedroom. …… The next morning, Xia ruofei did not have any other plans. After waking up, he ordered breakfast and went to the Presidential Suite. After breakfast, Xia ruofei sat on the deck chair on the balcony and read a book leisurely. The winter sun shone on his body and the distant whistle of the Huangpu River rang in his ears from time to time. Xia ruofei lazily passed the time for most of the day. During this time, he gave Monica a call and made an appointment to have lunch at the French restaurant on the top floor of the hotel. Xia ruofei only got up and changed into his suit when the appointed time was approaching. He left the Presidential Suite and took the special elevator to the top floor.
