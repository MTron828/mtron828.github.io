2934 Returning to the house (1)

As Zhang Chao slowed down the car, he turned his head and asked,””Mr. Xia, there are usually very few people and cars on this road, you see ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”very good, let’s do it here!” Let’s find a place to Park and unload the containers!”

“Yes!” Zhang Chao quickly said.

He drove a little further and saw an open space by the road. He turned the car around and stopped it on the open space.

It was very convenient for a container truck to unload cargo. The supporting leg of the rear compartment was lifted up, and the lock was unlocked. The trailer could be used to drive away.

After removing the car, Zhang Chao drove the mop a little and stopped. He jumped out of the driver’s seat and walked quickly to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei took the initiative to shake hands with Zhang Chao and said,”Brother Zhang, thank you!”

Zhang Chao quickly extended his hands and shook Xia ruofei’s hand tightly. He said,””Mr. Xia, please don’t say thank you to me. I’m not worthy of it! Compared to the help you’ve given us, what I’ve done for you is not worth mentioning! Right, can I just unload the things here? Do you still need my side to ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said with a smile,””It’s done! We’ll leave the rest to ourselves! You can just arrange for someone to tow the back of the car away tomorrow!”

“Alright!” Zhang Chao said,”then ... Mr. Xia, I’ll go back first!”

“Go!” Xia ruofei smiled.”Let’s part ways here! We’ll meet again if we’re fated to!”

“Mr. Xia, goodbye!” After Zhang Chao finished speaking, he solemnly bowed to Xia ruofei and said sincerely,”thank you!”

Then, he walked quickly to the front of the truck. When he left, he honked at Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng to express his gratitude.

The truck quickly disappeared from sight. Xia ruofei then smiled at Luo Qingfeng and said,””We’ve been busy for half a day, we should go back! Let’s get to work!”

With that, Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng unlocked all the containers. Then, with a single thought, he stored the containers in the back of the truck into the spirit map space.

Although he already knew that Xia ruofei must have a storage magical treasure with a large storage space, Luo Qingfeng was still shocked to see Xia ruofei put away such a large container with his own eyes.

A storage treasure that could store such a large object was already priceless in the current cultivation world.

Furthermore, Luo Qingfeng also knew that in Xia ruofei’s storage treasure, there was at least a yacht in addition to the container. This meant that the space in the storage treasure might be much larger than he had imagined.

Xia ruofei kept the container easily and used his mental strength to check. After making sure that there was no one within a few kilometers, he smiled and said,””Qingfeng! Let’s return to the residence!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Yes! Master!” “Yes,” Luo Qingfeng replied respectfully.

The two of them summoned their flying swords at the same time. Their figures flashed and jumped on the flying swords. Then, two sword lights flashed. The two figures flew straight into the sky on their flying swords and soon disappeared in the horizon.

……

The return journey was smooth and quiet, and the two of them flew for more than ten hours.

Of course, since they were not in a hurry, Xia ruofei stopped to rest twice on the way. He took out the yacht from the spirit map space, landed the flying sword, and rested on the yacht for about an hour before continuing to fly.

Due to the time difference, it was almost Teno’ clock in the morning the next day when the two returned to Peach Blossom Island.

It was a sunny day on the peach source Island. There were no clouds in the sky, and the blue sky and the sea were connected in a line. The scenery was very beautiful.

Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng rode on their flying swords and passed through the Taixu xuanqing formation, landing on the square in front of the Yanhuang building.

When the two of them activated the array, Li Yifu noticed it immediately. He quickly walked out of the building and saw two sword lights flying down from the sky. Then, he saw clearly that Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng had returned.

Li Yifu quickly came forward and bowed.””Martial granduncle! You’ve returned!”

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile and asked,”adopted husband, how has the island been these two days?”

“Reporting to grand uncle – Master, everything is normal!” Li Yifu said.

“By the way, where are Wei Wei and Qingxue?” Xia ruofei asked.

“They probably don’t know that you’re back yet, senior granduncle. I’ll go and inform them right away!” Li Yifu quickly said.

Li Yifu was in control of the formation, so he sensed it immediately when someone touched it. Song Wei and Ling Qingxue naturally didn’t have such a quick reaction.

However, just as Li Yifu finished speaking, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue appeared in front of Xia ruofei. They happened to see Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng coming on their flying swords from the window and quickly ran down the stairs, so they were just behind Li Yifu.

“Ruofei, you’re back!” Song Wei said with a smile.

Ling Qingxue said with envy,””RUO Fei, we saw you flying on your sword just now! He’s so handsome! I also want to ride a flying sword ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”isn’t that simple?” He just had to work hard in his cultivation! When you reach the Golden core stage, I will definitely get you a good flying sword! At that time, I’ll naturally be able to ride a flying sword!”

“The Golden core stage ... It seems so far away!” Ling Qingxue said,”I’ve been cultivating for almost a year, but I’m only at the fourth level of the aura refining realm!”

Li Yifu and Luo Qingfeng almost vomited blood when they heard this, especially the old Li Yifu. Before he met Xia ruofei, he had spent decades and half of his life to reach the third level of the aura refining realm!
