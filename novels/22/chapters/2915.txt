2916 Sending Buddha to the West (1)

Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng looked at Zhang Chao, who was constantly giving orders to his brothers, with amusement.

Of course, Xia ruofei understood Zhang Chao’s feelings. Although they had just survived a disaster, if they reacted a little slower, they would still be killed. At least from the perspective of an ordinary person like Zhang Chao, that was indeed the case.

Zhang Chao anxiously shouted at Qiang,””Where’s Lu Chunfeng? Where did that kid go?”

Zhang Chao did not know if he should blame or thank Lu Chunfeng. He asked Lu Chunfeng to accompany Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng to inspect the goods, but Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng ran to the front, while Lu Chunfeng himself was missing. This was obviously an absence without permission! However, if Xia ruofei and the others had not come, they would have been shot to death today. No matter what, after ERAD had insulted the Chinese, Zhang Chao would definitely not be able to stand it. The situation of falling out was inevitable.

It was because of this that Zhang Chao did not blame Xia ruofei for teaching those bodyguards a lesson or for humiliating ERAD. On the contrary, he was very grateful to Xia ruofei. It was not an exaggeration to say that he had saved his life. According to the rules of the Hong sect, from this moment on, the lives of the ten or twenty brothers who were left at the shipping company today belonged to Xia ruofei.

“He should still be in the warehouse,” Qiang said quickly.”I’ve already sent someone to inform the brothers over there to quickly come to the front and evacuate with everyone!”

“Hurry up!” Zhang Chao shouted,”don’t pack up! We’ll leave with the cash and documents!”

At this moment, Xia ruofei finally got a chance to interject. He said to Zhang Chao,””Brother, don’t rush! You’re giving up on such a huge family business just like that?”

“Mr. Xia!” Zhang Chao said with a bitter smile. We don’t want to abandon our family business! Madeline gave us a lot of pressure before, but we’ve been holding on because we don’t want to give up so easily. But now that he had completely offended them, there was no room for negotiation! And if we stay and fight those drug lords head – on, it’s no doubt like hitting a rock with an egg. There’s no hope of winning at all, and we’ll only lose our lives in vain!”

Zhang Chao quickly explained,””Mr. Xia, please don’t misunderstand! I’m not blaming you ... We’re really grateful that you and this old man helped us! And before you made your move, I already had a failed negotiation with that ERAD. If it wasn’t for you and this old man, I’m afraid that Huafeng shipping would be covered in corpses now, so ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said with a smile,””No need to explain ... Brother Zhang Chao, are these drug dealers really so arrogant?”

“You might not know much about the situation in Mexico,” Zhang Chao said with a bitter smile.”I’ll put it this way. ” The Bay group could be said to be one of the top drug lords in Mexico. How powerful were they? It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that if they wanted to, they could even overthrow the Mexico government at any time. They were only willing to maintain the current situation because they were worried about the interference of the international community! You’ve just seen it, whether it’s the state government or the city government, those officials are simply ERAD’s dogs! The Gulf group’s armed forces are much stronger than the Mexico military and police, and they are well – equipped. To put it bluntly, they are an elite force!”

Zhang Chao didn’t finish his sentence, but his meaning was obvious. Although the Hong sect’s power was spread all over the world, it was just a loose organization like a gang. The result of a gang against the Army was obvious.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”since that’s the case ... You guys should get ready to evacuate!” I’ll think of another way to help you solve this problem. ”

Although it was Zhang Chao and the others who got into this mess, and before Xia ruofei came out, Zhang Chao had already fallen out with him, so the situation had nothing to do with Xia ruofei. However, considering that Li Yifu was the leader of the Hong sect, there must be some fate between him and the Hong sect. Since he had encountered it, there was no reason for him to stand by and do nothing.

When Zhang Chao told Xia ruofei to solve this problem, he was actually hoping that the Qingqing Bay group could do whatever they wanted in Mexico. Even if the headquarters of the Hong sect stepped in, it would be almost impossible to solve this situation. No matter how good Xia ruofei was at fighting, he was only a young man in his twenties. What power did he have to solve this problem? Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

However, since Xia ruofei did not object to their retreat, Zhang Chao did not say anything more. He could not possibly say something like “I don’t think you can do it. Don’t waste your time”, right?

Out of courtesy, Zhang Chao said,””Then I’ll thank you in advance, Mr. Xia! But ... When ah Qiang and the others are done packing, you must immediately evacuate with us. While coordinating with us, you must also ensure your own safety. If anything happens to you, we won’t be able to explain it to uncle Yi!”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei said readily.

He knew very well that it was impossible to stop Zhang Chao and the others from evacuating Huafeng shipping. No one believed that he could deal with a huge and terrifying drug lord gang like the Bay group.

Zhang Chao and a few core employees of Huafeng shipping were nervously preventing everyone from boarding the truck, including Xia ruofei’s entire container of goods. They were hoisted onto the head of a truck that happened to be left in the company.
