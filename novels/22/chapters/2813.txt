Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.”Vice – President Zhao, you’re overpraising me. I know my own limits. I’m just a so – called professional player who only plays fish for three days and plays the net for two days. I don’t deserve such high praise.”

Zhao Zhenghao said sincerely,”Mr. Xia, I’m not trying to flatter you!” China’s football needs stars like you too much. In the past few years, the football world was chaotic. The most direct impact was, of course, a group of people went to prison, but in the long run, the impact was even more fatal. It has gradually begun to show in the past two years. Because of the dark secrets of the football world, the number of children who learned to play football in those years has sharply decreased, leading to a gap in talent. This is also an important reason for the decline in the national team’s performance in recent years. The range of talents that ran ran has selected is too small. There are only a few people from a certain age group. ”

Zhao Zhenghao took a sip of his drink and continued,”Although the domestic league seems to be getting more and more popular in the past two years due to the entry of capital, the strength of the national team hasn’t improved much. The Chinese Football Association actually places a lot of importance on youth training. Everyone knows that football should be started from a young age, but this is a long – term work and it is difficult to see results in the short term. This has also made some comrades who are eager for quick success and instant benefits not very concerned about youth training. Some clubs also don’t like to do youth training because it is the most convenient way to buy people. ”

Zhao Zhenghao and Xia ruofei were not close friends, but Zhao Zhenghao clearly knew that he could not treat Xia ruofei as an ordinary player. Would an ordinary player make so many big shots greet him? That was obviously not possible!

“Our country has a large population, but the football population is smaller than many small European countries. This is the reality.” Zhao Zhenghao said seriously,”so the Chinese Football Association is also working hard from multiple angles, such as increasing the construction of infrastructure, promoting campus football, and so on. On the other hand, we’ve always wanted to set up an idol. Through the power of role models, we can attract more children to learn to play football. ”

The level of European football had always been high. In addition to the natural physical advantage of the race, the more important reason was their consistent high – Quality youth training, such as Barcelona’s youth training camp, La Masia, which was world – famous. In this aspect, it was just as Zhao Zhenghao had said, China was still lacking.

“We call it the ‘star – making movement’ internally,” Zhao Zhenghao said with a smile.”Originally, we focused our attention on Wu Lei. We hoped that the only player in the first team of the five major leagues could hold up the sky of Chinese football. Now, it seems that President Xia is more suitable for this role!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,””Vice President Zhao, I can’t do this! He couldn’t even be a role model for the children! Otherwise, they’ll think that professional players are like me, not doing proper work!”

Everyone could not help but smile at Xia ruofei’s words.

Xia ruofei was not a qualified professional player. He did not follow the path of a professional player. However, he had skills that countless professional players were envious of. He was always a hot topic and was a popular person on the internet. It was no wonder that Zhao Zhenghao wanted to set Xia ruofei as a benchmark.

It was a simple truth. People who did not watch the game might know the names of the world’s top players, such as Messi and C.R.C. Luo, but they might not know the first – Class star players like Neymar, zuyares, and mbape. However, in China, Xia ruofei’s fame in the non – Fan circle definitely surpassed that of Neymar and the others.

“Mr. Xia, we can discuss this further, but let’s not talk about this for now,” Zhao Zhenghao said with a smile.

In fact, Zhao Zhenghao didn’t give up on his idea. He just felt that the time was not right. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

According to his plan, if Xia ruofei could join the China national team and perform well in the world Cup qualifiers, especially if he could help the national football team to enter the World Cup finals again, Xia ruofei would become a football hero in the eyes of the people without the deliberate promotion of the Chinese Football Association.

The scene of the Chinese football team making it into the world Cup in Korea and Japan was still vivid in Zhao Zhenghao’s mind. It was really a national celebration! After so many years, many people were familiar with every player in that national team.

As expected, Zhao Zhenghao did not mention their “star – making operation” again. Instead, he started chatting with Xia ruofei and Zhou leiyun. They talked about a variety of topics, from the domestic economic situation to the weather and food Spain. Zhao Zhenghao could be considered as a knowledgeable person. Basically, he could chat about any topic.

Of course, this was also the reason why Zhao Zhenghao wanted to befriend Xia ruofei. If he was an ordinary player, Vice President Zhao would have been more reserved.

After three rounds of drinks, Zhou leiyun smiled and stood up.””President Xia, Vice President Zhao, I can’t hold my liquor. I’ll go make some tea first. You guys can talk!”

This private room was quite large, and it even had a special tea – making area. Of course, the tea set wasn’t as complete as the hotels in China. In fact, it was mainly for guests to drink coffee and chat.

Zhou leiyun was taking the initiative to avoid suspicion. Song Wei and Ling Qingxue exchanged a look and stood up at the same time.

“Let’s go have some tea too!”Song Wei said with a smile.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Are you all full? Then go and rest for a while! I’ll have a chat with Vice President Zhao!”
