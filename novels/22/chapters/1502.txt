Chapter 1503: Seemingly real yet illusionary (2)

Translator: 549690339

However, he was clearly in an ancient tomb that was deeply buried underground. How did he suddenly appear in a tropical forest? Could it be that spatial teleportation could be performed in that strange place?

Xia ruofei was so shocked that he could not think.

It wasn’t that he didn’t consider the possibility that this was an illusionary formation, but everything was so real, including the sunlight, the rainforest, and the snakes, insects, rats, and ants that could be seen everywhere in the jungle ...

No matter if it was an illusion array or not, they had to get out of it. Xia ruofei wanted to leave the rainforest first before making any plans.

So he clenched the gun in his hand and pushed away the thorns in the jungle and walked forward.

As a member of the Special Forces who had undergone special training, Xia ruofei did not feel uncomfortable in such an environment. Instead, he was like a fish in water.

His speed was quite fast.

However, after a few hundred meters, Xia ruofei suddenly stopped. His eyes were alert.

Because he saw a person standing quietly in front of him.

The man was wearing Southeast Asian clothes. He had a machine gun on his shoulder and two bullet belts on his body.

Xia ruofei quickly removed the safety of his gun and pointed it at the man with both hands. He said in a deep voice,””Don’t move! Put the gun on the ground, then slowly turn around!”

The man did not seem surprised by Xia ruofei’s appearance. He cooperatively threw the machine gun on the ground, then held the back of his head with both hands and slowly turned around.

When the man was facing Xia ruofei, Xia ruofei’s eyes narrowed and his body trembled.

He knew the person in front of him, or to be more precise, this person had become the most unforgettable part of his memory, and he might never forget.

The man’s name was Mamba, a small drug lord in Southeast Asia. Of course, this was not the main point.

The reason why Xia ruofei had a deep impression of this person was because he had once met Mamba during a mission.

Furthermore, that was Xia ruofei’s first actual combat mission after joining lone wolf and going through strict training and examinations. This mission was to encircle and annihilate the Mamba gang that came to our country’s border for trade.

At that time, Xia ruofei’s performance was outstanding. After the mission was completed, there was an additional third – Class merit form in his file.

The reason why he was able to get his first Military Merit was because he had killed a person on his first shot in this mission.

This was the first time Xia ruofei had killed someone. He clearly saw through his crosshair that his target’s head had been shot through. After firing the shot, he could not help but retch.

The person he had killed was Mamba!

A dead person suddenly appeared in front of him alive. The shock was simply indescribable.

Xia ruofei could even see a bloody hole on the Mamba’s forehead, from which blood and brain matter were flowing.

Mamba’s eyes were lifeless and his face was pale. He stared straight at Xia ruofei and muttered,””I’m in so much pain ... So much pain ...”

Xia ruofei felt his hair stand on end, but he quickly forced himself to calm down.

It must be an illusory formation! Xia ruofei thought to himself,”all of this is fake!”

Xia ruofei gritted his teeth and said to himself,””You killed him with one shot when he was alive. Now that he’s dead, you’re afraid of him? At most, I’ll just beat him to death again!”

After he had calmed down, Xia ruofei pulled the trigger without hesitation.

The crisp sound of a gunshot rang out in the forest, and blood bloomed from Mamba’s chest. He clutched his chest and said,””You ... You’re so cruel ...”

As the Mamba slowly fell to the ground, Xia ruofei felt the world spinning and a strong wind blew in the forest.

When he opened his eyes again, he found that the scene had changed.

This time, he was in a desert. Not far in front of him, an all – terrain vehicle was burned to the ground, leaving only its skeleton.

Seeing this scene, Xia ruofei did not even need to recall anything to immediately recall the scene back then.

That was his second actual combat mission with the team. In this mission, he accurately hit the fuel tank of the all – terrain vehicle that the terrorists were in while constantly moving. The vehicle caught fire and exploded on the spot, and the four terrorists on the vehicle also died on the spot.

As expected, he soon saw four figures appear in front of him.

The four of them were all burnt black. One of them had a broken arm and it was hanging by his side, covered in blood. They dragged their feet and walked towards Xia ruofei with blank eyes, leaving four blood – Red footprints in the desert ...

Xia ruofei’s eyes were cold as he fired without hesitation.

Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa!

The crisp sound of gunfire continued to ring out, and the four terrorists fell to the ground without any suspense ...

Then, the scene kept changing. Different people kept appearing in front of Xia ruofei.

Some of these people were extremely vicious ruffians, some were cunning drug lords, and some were cold – hearted killers.

They all had one thing in common, which was that they had either been killed or captured by Xia ruofei.

Those who were captured alive basically couldn’t escape the death penalty.

Therefore, these people were actually dead.

Xia ruofei could feel the anger in his heart building up. He knew that everything was fake, but the people he had killed before had appeared in front of him one by one, and they were all in terrible States after their deaths. This had a huge impact on his heart.
