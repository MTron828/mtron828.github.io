Chapter 97: Put down your pride (1)

“Youyou ...” Professor Tian frowned and called out. He subconsciously felt that Lu You was about to cause trouble again. From the start, Lu You seemed to be on bad terms with Xia ruofei. No matter how she looked at Xia ruofei, she did not like him. Xia ruofei turned around and looked at Lu You. He smiled and asked,””What’s wrong? What’s the matter?” Lu You bit her lower lip gently. After a while, she finally said,””I was prejudiced against you before and my attitude wasn’t very good. I apologize.” Xia ruofei was a little surprised, but he quickly came back to his senses. He smiled and said,””It’s okay, I didn’t take it to heart. ” When Lu You saw Xia ruofei’s smile, she felt that Xia ruofei didn’t seem to care. She couldn’t help but grit her teeth. However, she didn’t show it and continued,””You ... Can you stay for the afternoon? Huanhuan ... Likes to hang out with you, and she’ll have to take her medicine again later. If you’re there, we’ll know what’s going on ...” “Don’t worry, the Chinese medicine is not dangerous ...”Xia ruofei smiled. “I didn’t mean it that way, don’t misunderstand!” Lu You quickly said,”I just want you to stay for half a day more to accompany Huanhuan. This will be good for her recovery.” Lu You looked at Xia ruofei and tried her best to make her facial expression gentler. However, she was already gnashing her teeth in hatred. This stinky fellow, I’ve already lowered myself to beg you, yet you’re still trying to make things difficult for me ... You’re really annoying! Lu You was truly concerned about her cousin Huanhuan. She had always been at odds with Xia ruofei, and she had almost lowered her voice just now. Xia ruofei saw the anticipation in Tian Huixin’s and Ma Zhiming’s eyes. He couldn’t help but secretly sigh. He looked at professor Tian and asked with a smile,””Professor Tian, will this ... Disturb your family reunion?” “Xiao Xia, we’re so happy that you’re willing to stay and accompany Huanhuan!” Professor Tian said quickly. “Yes, yes, yes! Xia Sheng, Huanhuan is very close to you. Please stay and accompany her!” Ma Zhiming also said quickly. Xia ruofei thought for a while and nodded.””Alright then! I don’t have anything to do today, so I’ll go back in the evening ...” Lu You’s gaze was a little complicated, but she still said softly,””Thank you!” “You’re welcome,” Xia ruofei said calmly,”I also like little Huanhuan and hope that she can recover as soon as possible.” Xia ruofei returned to the living room and knelt down in front of Huanhuan. He said gently,””Huanhuan, let me show you another magic trick, okay?” Huan Huan now understood that it was difficult for her master to speak. After thinking about it seriously, she revealed an extremely innocent smile and nodded heavily. Soon, Xia ruofei was playing with Huanhuan. She would giggle from time to time and was like a different person from before. Tian Huixin brought over Huanhuan’s lunch. Just as she was about to feed her, Xia ruofei quietly stopped Tian Huixin and tried to encourage Huanhuan to eat by herself. To his surprise, Huanhuan really started to pick up a small spoon and eat by herself. Although her movements were still a little clumsy and her fine control of her hands had some problems, causing her to spill a lot of rice and soup, this was still a very gratifying improvement. Huan Huan rested for a while after her meal. Xia ruofei heated up the second dose of Chinese medicine and brought it over. This time, it was even smoother than the last time. She finished half a bowl of medicine in a few mouthfuls and then pestered Xia ruofei to play games. It was the first time that Ma Zhiming and Tian Huixin had seen their daughter so clingy. They had been sick for a long time, so they knew a lot about autism. They naturally knew what a happy change this was, and they were both very excited. Little Huanhuan was tired again after playing for a while. This time, she fell asleep on the floor. Tian Huixin carefully carried Huanhuan upstairs to rest. After such a long time, Xia ruofei’s lunch was almost over, and Huanhuan had already gone to bed, so he took his leave at the right time. Professor Tian’s family, including Tian Huilan and Lu You, all stood up to send Xia ruofei to the door. Ma Zhiming even held Xia ruofei’s hand and said many words of thanks. As she watched Xia ruofei drive away in the pickup truck, Tian Huixin could not suppress the excitement in her heart. She had never dared to think that a normal trip home would bring them a ray of hope in their despair. “Zhiming, no matter how much Huanhuan recovers this time, we must thank little Xia!” Tian Huixin said to her husband. Ma Zhiming nodded in agreement and said,”Yes, the consultation fee for Xia Sheng must not be low!” Tian Huilan laughed.”Zhiming, I can tell that Xiao Xia really loves Huanhuan. He’s definitely not treating Huanhuan for the money.” “Big sister, we know about this.” Ma Zhiming said,”but from our point of view, we still have to express our feelings ...” Professor Tian knew that his son – in – Law had a net worth of tens of billions. Money was nothing to him. Thus, he smiled and said, “It’s fine to pay the consultation fee, it’s natural to spend money to see a doctor! Besides, Xiao Xia’s prescription is so precious ...” Previously, professor Tian trusted Xia ruofei unconditionally. Some people did not think so. But now, no one thought so anymore. Huanhuan’s change today made everyone not dare to underestimate Xia ruofei’s medical skills. “By the way, Zhiming, little Xia is starting her own business now. She should be developing in the planting and breeding industry in the future. Don’t you also have a few Michelin star restaurants in Hong Kong?” professor Tian continued. In the future, you can also help Xiao Xia in her career!” “Of course, of course!” Ma Zhiming quickly replied after hearing that. Rich people naturally cared about their health the most. Xia ruofei had first pulled professor Tian back from the brink of death due to acute myocardial infarction. This time, he even had a solution to the world’s difficult medical problem of autism. His medical skills had already been recognized by Ma Zhiming from the bottom of his heart. If he could be on good terms with someone like Xia ruofei by helping out in the business, Ma Zhiming would be more than happy to do so. Naturally, Xia ruofei did not know about the discussion between Ma Zhiming and the others. After he left Sanshan University, he drove straight to the holiday villa in the suburbs. Soon, the car went out of the Urban area and turned into National Highway 306. Just then, Xia ruofei’s phone rang. He was wearing a pair of jeans today, and his phone was in his pocket. He was in a driving position, so his pants were a little tight. Xia ruofei held the steering wheel with one hand and lifted his butt slightly. He took out his phone from his pocket with the other. This position was a little awkward. At this moment, Xia ruofei suddenly saw a black shadow rush out from the side of the car. Even though he had excellent reflexes, he only had time to step on the brakes and subconsciously turn left to avoid it. However, Xia ruofei could clearly feel that the front right side of the car had hit something. His heart skipped a beat as he realized that he might have hit someone ...
