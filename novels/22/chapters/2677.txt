The Super Jaguar helicopter whizzed past Paradise Island.

Xia ruofei sat in the front passenger seat with a pair of soundproof headphones on. Looking down from the sky, the green peach Garden Island looked like a Pearl embedded in the South Pacific Ocean. The color of the sea around the island changed from light to dark, and gradually transitioned to a deep dark blue.

Looking down from the sky, the entire Peach Blossom Island could be seen at a glance.

The helicopter pilot, Wu Wenhan, was controlling the plane while secretly observing Xia ruofei, who was sitting on his right, out of the corner of his eye. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Wu Wenhan used to be a land pilot, but he stopped flying due to physical reasons.

However, although he couldn’t take on combat flight missions, Wu Wenhan had no problem flying a civilian helicopter. He had excellent skills and quickly got a position as a helicopter pilot in a civilian aviation company. Later, he was sent to green cloud Island, which was now Peach Blossom Island, to work.

To be honest, Wu Wenhan really wanted to keep this job. Although this small island in the South Pacific was far away from the mainland and his family, the pay was high! He was sent abroad by the navigation company, and his salary was still received from the navigation company, but the Liu family gave him quite a generous subsidy, which was much higher than the usual subsidy for being sent abroad. Moreover, on this Island, there were not many flight missions, and the work was very easy.

Wu Wenhan couldn’t wait to fly more, because every time the helicopter took off, he could get another flight allowance, which was also given by the Liu family.

Unfortunately, the good days didn’t last long. This green cloud Island changed hands just like that, and it was even renamed as Peach Blossom Island. And the owner of Peach Blossom Island was this young man who was ten years younger than him.

Wu Wenhan’s field work was done by the Liu family contacting the airline company he worked for and paying the cost of renting a pilot to the airline company. So, in theory, if the Liu family withdrew from Paradise Island, he would also have to withdraw.

However, the Liu family had continued to pay for a period of time, allowing him to stay and clean up the mess.

In fact, if Xia ruofei wanted to continue to hire him, it was very simple. He just had to sign a new contract with the navigation company.

Therefore, whether Wu Wenhan could continue to get a high salary or not, it was all up to Xia ruofei.

Hence, from the moment Xia ruofei boarded the plane today, Wu Wenhan had been very careful. He was afraid that Xia ruofei would be unhappy if he did not provide good service.

However, Xia ruofei’s performance confused Wu Wenhan.

Xia ruofei’s expression had been serious since they boarded the plane. Other than giving him directions, he did not say anything else.

Xia ruofei’s instructions came through Wu Wenhan’s earphones from time to time.

“Turn 5 degrees to the left ... Pull up a little ... Hover ... Lower the altitude ... Fly towards the southeast ... Hover ...”

Wu Wenhan did not dare to relax. He executed Xia ruofei’s instructions meticulously and flew the helicopter skillfully.

From the corner of his eye, he could see Xia ruofei scribbling and drawing on a piece of paper. He did not dare to ask more, nor did he dare to peek at what Xia ruofei was writing or drawing.

The flight lasted for more than an hour. The entire time, they were in the sky above Paradise Island. The furthest they flew was only about three nautical miles perpendicular to the airport runway.

Although Xia ruofei’s instructions were not complicated, Wu Wenhan was walking on thin ice. He even guessed that Xia ruofei was deliberately testing his flying ability because Xia ruofei’s instructions were traceless. She often told him to change the route without warning. If it were not for his excellent flying skills, he might not have been able to react in time.

Finally, Wu Wenhan heard Xia ruofei’s calm voice from his earphones.””Alright, let’s return!”

Wu Wenhan was relieved and quickly flew the Super Jaguar to the helicopter parking spot on the roof of the building.

The Super Jaguar landed steadily on the helicopter with the “H” logo.

After the car was shut down, the sound of the propeller quickly became lower.

Xia ruofei took off his headphones and turned to Wu Wenhan.””You’ve worked hard, you’ve flown well!”

Wu Wenhan was excited and quickly said,””You’re too kind, boss!”

“Fly well. I’ll need an excellent pilot like you in the future!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Thank you, boss! I will definitely work hard!” Wu Wenhan said excitedly.

Xia ruofei nodded and stepped out of the cockpit. He walked straight to the stairs after he got off the plane.

Wu Wenhan was still sitting in the cockpit. He raised his arms and shouted,””Yay! That’s great!”

Xia ruofei did not know that his casual words would make Wu Wenhan so excited. In fact, whether Wu Wenhan could continue to stay would depend on his performance in the “interview.”

In the future, Xia ruofei would have to personally screen all the people who would work on Peach Blossom Island.

There was no way Peach Blossom Island could be completely isolated from the outside world like those cultivation sects. After all, the airport, docks, planes, yachts ... All of them needed ordinary people to maintain them.

Since it was inevitable, Xia ruofei had to go through them one by one. At least, he couldn’t leave behind those with ulterior motives. Otherwise, if the secret of the Paradise Island were to be leaked, the consequences would be extremely severe.

Xia ruofei no longer had to carefully hide his intentions on this flight, so he could see it the clearest this time.
