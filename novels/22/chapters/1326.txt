Chapter 1327: Chapter 793-it’s too late to regret (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei didn’t expect it to be Chen shun. He thought that Chen shun was already in the capital. After all, Tang weiran had already rushed to the three mountains from the capital.

He did not expect Chen shun to be so ambitious. He did not complete anything on his business trip to the three mountains and caused a big mess, but he was still in the mood to travel on public expense.

So, Xia ruofei looked at Tang weiran who was sitting opposite him in surprise. He smiled and said,””President Tang, you’ve brought people with you? Why is he with you?”

Tang Wei Ran was also confused and said,””No, I didn ‘t! I came in a hurry this time, so I only brought Zheng Xu with me ...”

Xia ruofei was stunned. He jumped out of the car and walked to the door.

He couldn’t see very clearly under the light of the car opposite him. He could only see two dark figures.

Chen shun could see clearly with the help of the light. When he saw Xia ruofei, he quickly called out,””President Xia, President Xia, it’s me! Chen shun ... I ... I’m here to apologize to you ...”

Hearing Chen shun’s voice, Xia ruofei turned around and walked back without thinking.

There was really nothing to talk about with this person.

“President Xia, please hold on!” Chen shun said anxiously. I ... I’ve realized my mistake. Please give me another chance!”

When Chen shun saw Xia ruofei leave without looking back, he was so anxious that he rushed into the house. Chen Weinan had already explained the seriousness of the matter clearly. If he couldn’t get the forgiveness of the Paradise company this time, then his hard – won formal establishment would probably be ruined.

However, the well – trained veteran soldiers wouldn’t let him charge in just like that. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The two veterans who were on shift duty at the gate took a step forward at the same time with great tacit understanding. Chen shun suddenly felt as if he had hit a wall, and his whole body was bounced back a few steps.

“Let me in!” Chen shun shouted,”I’m not causing trouble. I’m just here to apologize to President Xia!”

The two seasoned soldiers, however, stood in place expressionlessly. They opened their arms and blocked Chen shun’s way. No matter how hard Chen shun tried, the two were as firm as mountains. Even eight of him added up would not be a match for one veteran.

“Enough!”

Just as Chen shun was trying to get in, Tang weiran finally got out of the car and shouted.

“Chen shun! What are you doing here?” Tang Wei Ran glared at Chen shun in disgust and asked coldly.

Chen shun was stunned for a moment before he reacted. This was president Tang of the corporation! He was in charge of chain companies.

His legs went soft and he almost couldn’t stand. He had to put his hand on the veteran’s body to prevent himself from falling down.

“D – D – President ... Tang!” Chen shun stuttered,”I’m even ...”

“I know you’re Chen shun, the purchasing manager of the chain company!” Tang weiran interrupted Chen shun impatiently,”I’m asking you, what are you doing at the peach blossom company?”

To be honest, if Chen shun didn’t introduce himself to Xia ruofei, Tang weiran wouldn’t have known who Chen shun was. He was the Vice President of the group. How could he know a small manager of a chain company? Even if they had seen each other once or twice, they would definitely not have any impression.

“President Tang, I made a mistake during the negotiation this morning. It was caused by my ineptitude. I ... I’ve realized my mistake. I ... I want to apologize to President Xia ...” Chen shun quickly said.

Tang weiran’s eyes flashed with a trace of anger. Chen shun’s words proved that he was still hoping for a fluke. He didn’t have the attitude that he should have when he realized his mistake.

“President Xia doesn’t need your apology!” Tang weiran said in disgust. The company will find out what’s wrong with you. Go back!”

Tang weiran said and walked towards Xia ruofei.

After taking two steps, Tang weiran stopped and turned around. She said in disgust,””Also, don’t disturb the normal work order of others! What a scandal it was to make a scene at the door at night! Even if you don’t find it embarrassing, I do!”

After that, Tang weiran ignored Chen shun and chased after Xia ruofei.

Lin Zhongming sat in the electric car and didn’t get out. He kept staring at Chen shun under the light. Seeing Chen shun’s desperate look, he didn’t feel any pity at all. As long as he thought of Chen shun’s face during the day, he couldn’t help but feel happy.

Xia ruofei and Tang weiran got into the car one after another. Xia ruofei said calmly,””Drive! Let’s continue the tour ...”

Tang Wei Ran looked guilty and said,””President Xia, I’m sorry! Our group’s employees are disturbing you ...”

Tang weiran even used honorifics. It could be seen how nervous he was at this time.

In fact, Tang weiran hated Chen shun to the core. Not only did he cause a lot of trouble, but he had also tried his best to appease Xia ruofei. They had a good chat, but Chen shun suddenly came up with a “humble apology”, which ruined everyone’s mood.

Xia ruofei didn’t really mind. In fact, a nobody like Chen shun was not even worth Xia ruofei’s attention. It was even more difficult for him to be moved.

However, it was not Xia ruofei’s style to be bullied by others. He was like this in the Army. Who in the Army did not have guts? Xia ruofei could still clearly remember what old Luo had said to him when he was given the first opportunity to take leave after the lower company.
