2456 Getting better and better (1)

Translator: 5496903Xia ruofei was not blindly confident. It was just that Ling Qingxue’s cultivation had also reached the peak of the third Qi layer. From the third Qi layer to the fourth Qi layer, it was not too difficult to break through the bottleneck. Furthermore, after taking the heart concentrating grass, Ling Qingxue’s physique had become very suitable for cultivation. With one night’s time and the help of array flags, it was completely possible to help Ling Qingxue break through.

After all, Ling Qingxue’s talent was actually better than Song Wei’s after consuming the heart concentrating grass. This was also the main reason why she was able to catch up even though she started cultivating later than Song Wei.

The facts had proven that Xia ruofei’s judgment was very accurate.

He had cultivated with Ling Qingxue in the array flags for about seven to eight days, and Ling Qingxue had successfully completed the transformation from Qi layer level 3 to Qi layer 4. The process of breaking through was without any danger, and it could be said that success came naturally when water flowed.

After Ling Qingxue had consolidated her cultivation, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue left the time formation.

Xia ruofei kept the time array flag and smiled.””Qingxue, you broke through faster than I expected,”

“Compared to Wei Wei? Who’s faster?” Ling Qingxue asked.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile bitterly. He thought to himself that he had to be more careful in the future, especially in terms of cultivation. If one of them cultivated too fast, he would be in an awkward situation.

“I think you’re faster ... We spent about nine days to help Wei Wei break through,” Xia ruofei said.

“It seems that my cultivation speed is not bad!” Ling Qingxue smiled in satisfaction.

Xia ruofei said seriously,”Qingxue, you’re only cultivating your true Qi and mental energy now. You’re not practicing the secret techniques of cultivators. Also ... Your and Weiwei’s cultivation is still too low. So, you must be careful when you’re outside. Don’t expose your identity as cultivators. If you meet other cultivators, no matter what their cultivation is, you must avoid them at once!”

Ling Qingxue nodded and said,”I understand.” Don’t worry, RUO Fei! We won’t go around showing off! Besides ... When it comes to cultivation, unless you’re experiencing it yourself, no one would believe you!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’m just giving you a reminder. Don’t get carried away just because your cultivation has improved.” Including myself, I’m still far from that ...”

“Yes ...” Ling Qingxue nodded her head lightly.

Xia ruofei continued.”Also ... After you’ve improved your cultivation, you have to get used to the power you control as soon as possible. I don’t want you to become the Kings of destruction.”

If one’s cultivation didn’t break through to a new level, in addition to the strength of their true Qi, their body would also be strengthened. The corresponding physical strength would naturally increase a lot. If they couldn’t adapt to this power in a short time, there would be problems of overexerting. It was fine if they accidentally damaged some things, but it would be bad if they hurt people.

“Don’t worry!” Ling Qingxue pursed her lips and smiled.”It’s not like this is the first time we’ve broken through. We’ll be careful!”

“Mm! That’s good!” Xia ruofei said.

Then, he sniffed and asked with a smirk,””Qingxue, don’t you smell something weird?”

Ling Qingxue was stunned for a moment. She did smell something unpleasant, but she was too focused on talking to Xia ruofei and did not pay much attention to it. Now that Xia ruofei reminded her, she immediately realized that the pungent smell was coming from her.

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but cry out in shock. She said shyly,””Xia ruofei! How can you be so bad! Why didn’t you remind me when you smelled it ...”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t stay there any longer. She wanted to rush back to her room to take a shower.

Xia ruofei grabbed her hand and looked into her eyes.”Qingxue, you can shower at my place ... You can stay at my place tonight!”

Ling Qingxue’s heart trembled. She lowered her head and said,””My ... My change of clothes is still over there ...” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“I’ll help you get it!” Xia ruofei said decisively.

“But ...” Ling Qingxue hesitated, but she couldn’t think of any reason to reject him.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”no buts!” Hurry up and take a shower! I’ll go get your clothes now!”

“Then ... Hurry up!” Ling Qingxue said, half – heartedly.

“Immediately!” Xia ruofei said happily. Then, he tapped his feet and used his true energy. His speed was as fast as lightning and he rushed into the room next to Song Wei ‘s.

He picked up Ling Qingxue’s luggage and immediately returned to his room, locking the door.

Seeing Xia ruofei lock the door, Ling Qingxue’s pretty face could not help but heat up.””I’ll find my own clothes! You’re not allowed to look!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”good, good, good!” I don’t want to ...”

With that, Xia ruofei turned around and walked to the sofa opposite him. He sat down with his back facing Ling Qingxue.

Ling Qingxue took out some clean clothes from her luggage and quickly hid in the bathroom.

After the shower, Ling Qingxue did not mention that she wanted to go back to the guest room. The two of them very naturally walked towards the bedroom with each other in their arms.

After a while, a heart – shaking Sonata was played in the room ...

After a long time, Ling Qingxue snuggled into Xia ruofei’s arms with a faint smile on her face.

She nestled in Xia ruofei’s arms comfortably and said lazily,””Ruofei, there’s something you have to pay more attention to ... Don’t forget!”
