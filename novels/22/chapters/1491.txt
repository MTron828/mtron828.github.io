Chapter 1492: Entering the underground palace (2)

Translator: 549690339

At this moment, Song Wei heard a “ding” sound from below. It was obviously different from the digging sound earlier. She quickly asked,””RUO Fei, what’s wrong?”

“Song Wei, give me the flashlight!” Xia ruofei said.

Xia ruofei’s voice was muffled as he was already deep in the cave. However, Song Wei could still hear him clearly. She quickly took out a rope from her bag to tie the flashlight and went down.

After a while, Xia ruofei returned to the cave. He sat down and said to Song Wei,””They should have dug up a tomb brick! I want to change my tools. ”

Xia ruofei rummaged through the backpack at the side and took out a bag of tools. There were small crowbars, shovels, and other tools in it. They were all prepared for the limited space underground.

He thought for a moment, then took out a roll of plastic cloth from his bag and stuffed it into his pocket. Then he said,””I’m going down!”

Song Wei felt nervous for no reason. She grabbed Xia ruofei’s arm.

“What’s wrong?”Xia ruofei was stunned.

“It’s nothing ... You ... Be careful!”Song Wei’s face heated up.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”don’t worry!” I’m not an impetuous person. If anything goes wrong, I’ll immediately retreat! Oh, right ...”

Xia ruofei suddenly thought of something. He took out a black bag from his backpack and passed it to Song Wei. “I’ll pull the rope later, and you pull the pipe down!”

For safety’s sake, Xia ruofei had a rope tied around his waist when he was working. If anything happened, Song Wei could still pull him up.

Of course, whether the delicate lady song could move Xia ruofei was another matter altogether.

Song Wei opened it and was surprised,””Snake – like endoscope? You’re quite well – prepared!”

Xia ruofei chuckled,”it’s better to be safe than sorry!” Safety first!”

Song Wei was relieved and nodded,””Then you can leave! I’ll wait for your signal!”

An industrial grade snake – Tube endoscope allowed one to see the situation inside the tomb without personally going down. It was equivalent to a second pair of eyes, and it could avoid some unknown risks to a large extent.

Xia ruofei grinned at Song Wei and went back into the hole.

He quickly came to the place he had just dug. The soil here had been cleaned up by him, and in front of him were slightly curved tomb bricks.

The gaps between the bricks were tightly closed, and the construction process was quite advanced. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Xia ruofei took out the military dagger from the spirit map space and inserted it into the tiny gap. Then, he pried it carefully.

Gradually, the bricks began to move.

As the gap increased, Xia ruofei changed to a small pry bar and pried open a whole brick.

After taking out one, the rest was easy. Soon, all the bricks in front of him had been pried off.

However, what surprised Xia ruofei was that there was not a hollow chamber under the bricks. It was still made of compact soil.

This tomb chamber should be tamped with Sanhe soil from top to bottom, and there was a layer of tomb bricks in the middle, similar to a sandwich biscuit.

Xia ruofei didn’t know what was so special about this design, but he didn’t want to get to the bottom of it. Since it was still three – in – one soil, he would continue digging.

After digging another 40 centimeters, Xia ruofei finally felt the weight in his hand lighten. He immediately revealed a trace of joy. He knew that he had dug through.

However, Xia ruofei’s expression hardened when he thought of the cold unknown poison in the tomb. He immediately took out a plastic cloth that he had prepared and covered the hole he had just dug out. Then, he pulled the rope around his waist.

Song Wei had been waiting for a long time. When she felt the shaking of the rope, she quickly lowered the snakepipe peeping lens.

Xia ruofei placed the endoscope through the small hole in the tomb, then climbed out of the hole.

“How is it?” Song Wei asked.

“It’s already dug through!” Xia ruofei said,”let’s take a look at the situation down there before we decide if we should go in!”

“En!” Song Wei nodded her head.

Xia ruofei took out his laptop and the control end of the endoscope from his bag and connected them skillfully.

The snake endoscope was powered by a battery, and soon, the image of the bottom appeared on the screen of the laptop.

Naturally, Song Wei was also looking forward to it.

The infrared camera didn’t have any color on it, but they could still clearly see the situation in the tomb.

The place they had dug through seemed to be a passageway, about two meters high. Two rows of sculptures stood on both sides of the long corridor, looking a little eerie and strange.

Xia ruofei controlled the snake – like endoscope and took pictures of both ends of the tunnel. There was no danger. Although it felt eerie, it was very quiet.

So, he called up another interface on the computer and integrated a sensor at the top of the snake – Tube endoscope, which could detect the air condition in the tomb.

The data showed that everything was normal. Other than the low oxygen content, there were no signs of excessive harmful gases.

Song Wei and Xia ruofei looked at each other and asked,”Do you want to go down?”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” But ...”

“I’ll play too!” Song Wei said before Xia ruofei could finish.
