Xia ruofei and Zhou leiyun watched half of the match and left after Wu Lei left.

On the way back to the hotel, Zhou leiyun could not help but say,””President Xia, you’re really a God! The effect of your special training for Wu Lei is obvious!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’m just joking. It’s only been one night. I’m not a God!” That was Wu Lei’s own hard work. At most, I was just counseling him. I also felt that he was a little unconfident in yesterday’s game, so I talked to him. It seems that the effect was not bad. ”

Zhou leiyun could not help but feel a little disappointed. He asked,””Ah? There’s no special training …”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”but Wu Lei’s body is a little thin and not as good in confrontation. I will use some methods passed down by our ancestors to help him improve as much as possible. I believe that the training effect will not be worse than those professional physical coaches.”

Only then did Zhou leiyun reveal a hint of joy. He said,”I knew it! How could President Xia’s methods be so simple! Wu Lei is now the club’s precious baby. The height he can reach will determine the height of our club’s influence in the country! You must pay more attention to it!”

Xia ruofei said,”don’t worry!” I’ll do my best. ”

At that moment, Xia ruofei’s phone vibrated. He took out his phone and saw that it was a call from Liu Dong, the boss of jingbei group. He signaled to Zhou leiyun and answered the call.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”President Liu, you’re calling me so late at night. Could it be that you want to invite me for a drink?” I’m not in the country!”

“President Xia, thank you so much for this!” Liu Dong said. I’ll treat you to a drink after you return to China!”

Xia ruofei was stunned and asked,”boss Liu, what are you talking about?” I don’t understand what you’re saying. ”

Liu Dong said,”director Xia, don’t hide it from me. I’ve already inquired about it. The reason why my matter in Italy was resolved so quickly was because you entrusted the local Chinese leaders and Chinese society to help. They put in a lot of effort!”

Then, Liu Dong sighed,’this matter was resolved so quickly, and it has also reduced a lot of losses for kyokuboku group! I can’t thank you enough for this. President Xia, I’ll see you in the future!”

Xia ruofei finally understood why Liu Dong had called. It was about the incident in Italy.

While Liu Dong was being schemed against in Italy was embroiled in a lawsuit, the stock price of kyokuboku group also fell. At the same time, there were also undercurrents within the company.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Xia ruofei heard about this at the opening ceremony of the Paradise gathering. He called lui hai of the Italy Freemasonry and asked him to use the influence of the Freemasonry to urge the Roman police to close the case as soon as possible.

Xia ruofei did not care about this matter after the call. He did not know that Liu Dong’s matter had been resolved.

“Hi!” Xia ruofei said. It’s this matter! I thought it was a small matter! Boss Liu, you don’t have to be so polite. “After I heard about you the other day, I happened to have a few friends in Italy who are doing pretty well, so I tried to call them and tell them. Actually, I’m not sure if they can help, so I didn’t tell you …”

Liu Dong said gratefully,”director Xia, you’re a great man!” I, Liu Dong, am convinced! If it were any other person, regardless of whether they could help or not, they would have told the world about it, afraid that I wouldn’t appreciate it. You, on the other hand, have done it without a sound! I’m definitely going to make friends with you!”

“Haven’t we been friends for a long time?” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Yes, yes, yes!” Liu Dong hurriedly said,”my mistake! A slip of the tongue! President Xia, we must get together after you return to the country. I have to give you a few drinks!”

“Alright! I’ll contact you when I get back!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”if the grade is not high enough, I won’t agree to it!”

“Hahaha! That’s a deal! When the time comes, we’ll have a good gathering at the peach blossom banquet!” Liu Dong said.

“Hey! You really know how to pick a place!” Xia ruofei said,”it’s a deal then!”

After he hung up, Xia ruofei kept his phone in his pocket and smiled at Zhou leiyun.””It’s from kyokuboku group’s President Liu. ”

Zhou leiyun was sitting right beside Xia ruofei, so he could clearly hear the contents of their phone call.

Zhou leiyun asked with a smile,”has the issue with him in Italy been resolved?” Or did you help me solve it?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”I’ve only made a few calls. Actually, I’m not sure if my friend Italy can help, so I didn’t tell you about it. It seems like the result is not bad!”

Zhou leiyun sighed,”it’s not easy to do things abroad these days!” Don’t think that Liu Dong and I have some influence in China, but outside of China, we are of no use! Just like in Spain, money alone was not enough! President Xia, you’re the best! You can still do whatever you want in Europe!”

“It’s not that exaggerated. I just know a few friends! I can’t say that I can call the wind and summon the rain. ” Xia ruofei said humbly,”it just so happens that they were able to help this time. If we were in another place, I might not be able to use my reputation.”
