Chapter 171: The Super – rich compete (1)

Translator: 549690339

After Xia ruofei finished speaking, he passed the microphone to the auctioneer and walked down the stage confidently. The auction had been going according to Xia ruofei’s plan from the very beginning. Even an unexpected factor like Blake did not cause any impact. Now that everyone’s enthusiasm had been completely aroused, the atmosphere of the auction had also reached its peak. Everything would naturally come to fruition. The auctioneer was also in high spirits. It was rare to see such a high – tide auction. He said in an infectious voice,””Alright, ladies and gentlemen, the auction for the heaviest white truffle in history officially begins. The starting price is ...” The auctioneer paused for a second or two, then said,”” 0 Yuan!” “Everyone can make any bid. Each increment must be no less than 10000 US dollars!” The auctioneer said. As soon as he finished speaking, there was a moment of silence. Then, a silver – haired chinese old man smiled and raised his sign, saying,””Then I’ll give you a price to explore the way, hmm ... 800000 dollars!” Immediately, many people in the auction hall let out a sigh. The moment the old man made his bid, many people who still had a glimmer of hope were now completely destroyed. Sure enough, the starting bid of 0 Yuan was a gimmick. In the end, it was a game for the Super – rich, so it was impossible to pick up scraps. “It seems like you’re determined to get it, manager Gu!” MA Xiong laughed. There’s an imposing manner!” The silver – haired old man was called Gu Hongyang, the chairman of the Runcheng Real Estate Group. As the boss of one of the top three real estate companies in China, he was as rich as MA Xiong. 800000 dollars was nothing to him. Hearing MA Xiong’s words, Gu Hongyang laughed and said, “Didn’t we hear that Boss Ma is not going to fight with us? The world record – breaking white truffle! I want to try it too!” MA Xiong burst into laughter. At this time, a middle – aged man with a big belly raised his sign and said with a smile,””Since old Gu has made his move, I’ll join in the fun! 850 thousand US dollars!” MA Xiong couldn’t help but laugh when he saw this. He knew that there would be a show to watch today. He also glanced at Xia ruofei beside him and thought to himself,”Xia Sheng is really lucky. This white truffle will definitely be auctioned off for a high price today.” The fat man’s name was GE long, and he also ran a real estate company. Julong Real Estate Group, under his name, was also ranked in the top ten in the country. Those in the same industry were enemies. GE long and Gu Hongyang perfectly illustrated this saying. When the two companies were still small, the competition between them was already very fierce. Now that both companies had become real estate Giants, the two were still fighting with each other. It wasn’t that enemies didn’t meet, but with these two people together, it was impossible for the auction price to not be high. As expected, Gu Hongyang’s face darkened as he snorted and raised his sign,” 900000 US dollars!” Instantly, some guests who were not powerful had completely become spectators before they even had the chance to bid. GE long was still smiling like a Maitreya Buddha. He raised his sign unhurriedly and said,”” 910 thousand dollars! Old Gu, no matter how much you bid, I’ll bid 10000 more than you!” It was obvious that GE long was more sophisticated and did not show his emotions. Gu Hongyang, on the other hand, seemed to be a little short – tempered and his emotions were written all over his face. “Then what if I offer 100 million US dollars?” Gu Hongyang said angrily. “Then you pay ...” GE long said with a smile. Everyone burst into laughter. Gu Hongyang was just saying that out of anger. How could he really offer such an outrageous price? If he really called out this price, GE long would definitely not follow. Then Gu Hongyang would really become the biggest laughing stock. At this moment, a Westerner wearing an exquisitely tailored Kiton suit smiled gently and said in fluent Chinese,””The two of you have been fighting for so many years, why don’t you both take a step back this time? I’ll pay 1 million dollars!” “I thought you wanted to be the peacemaker, President an!” MA Xiong laughed. I didn’t expect you to interfere ... Haha!” The Westerner who spoke fluent Chinese was called an zaihua. In fact, he grew up in Macao. Although he looked like a foreigner, he was actually a native of Macao. An zaihua’s identity was also extraordinary. He was the son – in – Law of gambling King he of Macao and was highly regarded by gambling King he. He managed several casinos in Macao and could be said to be unparalleled. An zaihua smiled and said,”Chairman MA, I’m helping the two of them out!” Otherwise, if we fight over it, won’t it end up in the hands of that little brother by your side?” “Thank you for your kind offer, Mr. An,” Gu Hongyang snorted and said,”but I don’t care about a mere one or two million dollars.” “President an, let’s compete with our own abilities,” GE long said with a smile. An zaihua shrugged his shoulders. He obviously didn’t expect his words to persuade the two to leave. GE long looked at Gu Hongyang. Seeing that Gu Hongyang had no intention to speak, he directly said with a smile,”Since President an is so generous, I’ll add a little more. 1.05 million dollars!” The atmosphere in the hall became more and more lively. 1.05 million dollars was definitely the highest price in the history of truffle auction. Before Xia ruofei took out the White truffle, the world’s largest piece of truffle weighing 1.89 kilograms was finally sold for a shocking 60000 US dollars. However, that was definitely an accident in the auction. In fact, there was a buyer who had offered one million dollars before the auction, but the owner of the White truffle wanted to maximize the profit, so he insisted on auctioning it. In the end, he lost money. However, even if the previous buyer of the truffle had bid one million, Xia ruofei’s white truffle had been sold for 1.05 million, which was definitely a sky – High price. This time, it was Gu Hongyang’s turn to be disgusted by GE long. He raised his board and coldly said,”1.06 million US dollars! GE long, just 10000 more than you!” “1.08 million!” An zaihua thought for a moment and raised his sign to bid. It was obvious that GE long and Gu Hongyang were competing with each other, but an zaihua really wanted to get the White truffle. Now an zaihua was also a little annoyed. After GE long and Gu Hongyang’s fight, the price couldn’t be low even if he wanted to! “1.1 million!” Gu Hongyang shouted. GE long immediately followed with a smile,””1.11 million dollars! Old Gu, I won’t give up so easily!” “1.12 million!” Gu Hongyang didn’t want to show weakness. “1.13 million!” GE long raised the price without hesitation. An zaihua was speechless. He thought for a while and decided that he really did not want to continue watching the two of them compete like roosters. So he simply raised his sign, gritted his teeth, and said,””1.2 million dollars! This is the highest price I’m willing to offer. If you’re willing to offer a higher price, then I’ll admit defeat!” [PS] I’ve been working overtime today and only got home at almost 11 pm.
