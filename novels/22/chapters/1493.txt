Feeling Xia ruofei’s strong embrace, Song Wei blushed and her heart beat faster. However, Xia ruofei let go of her after helping her stabilize her body. Song Wei could not help but feel a little disappointed.

“Are you alright?”

Xia ruofei’s concerned voice came through song Wei’s earphones.

Only then did she come back to her senses and quickly said,””I’m fine! Which way should we go?”

They were in a long passageway. There were statues on both sides of the passageway. Under the illumination of the flashlight, they looked like monsters. Even though Song Wei was an archaeologist and was braver than most girls, she could not help but feel scared. She subconsciously moved closer to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei looked around with the help of the flashlight. He felt that the corridor was filled with a gloomy atmosphere.

The place where they came in happened to be in the middle of the corridor. It was dark at both ends, and they did not know where it led to.

However, Xia ruofei had another basic basis for his judgment, and that was to sense the Jade Leaf.

However, the changes in the Jade Leaf would not be too obvious within a short distance. Hence, Xia ruofei could only head in one direction. If he was lucky and the Jade Leaf’s reaction became more intense, it would mean that he had chosen the right direction. If not, he would have to turn back.

“Let’s go in a random direction,”Xia ruofei said.

Xia ruofei and Song Wei walked side by side, carefully walking in one direction.

In this empty and quiet underground Palace, the sound of their footsteps was particularly loud and scary. Song Wei could not help but pull on Xia ruofei’s clothes, not daring to fall behind.

Xia ruofei turned around and asked with a smile,””Song Wei, are you scared?”

Song Wei was obviously scared, but she still said,””Tsk ... Did you forget what my major is? A coward would dare to enter this line of work?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”then can you pull a little lighter?” I’m afraid you’ll tear my clothes ...”

Song Wei let go of Xia ruofei’s hand in embarrassment, but she quickly held onto Xia ruofei’s arm. Fortunately, the gas mask covered her expression, or it would have been even more embarrassing.

The passage seemed to be very long. The two of them had advanced nearly a hundred meters, but there was still no sign of turning. It was as if it would continue on forever.

Xia ruofei suddenly stopped in his tracks. Song Wei asked nervously,””What’s wrong?”

“We might have gone in the wrong direction.” Xia ruofei said,”turn back!”

After walking for such a long distance, not only did the temperature of the Jade Leaf not increase, it even decreased slightly. Xia ruofei knew that he was even further away from the realm stone, so he changed his direction without hesitation.

“Your intuition again?” Song Wei asked with a smile.

“It turns out that my intuition is still very accurate!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

The two of them changed direction and advanced in the other direction.

Soon, they arrived at the spot where they came in from. Song Wei felt a little more at ease when she saw the rope hanging down from the entrance.

As for how they were going to climb up the two – meter height, she was not worried at all. Anyway, with Xia ruofei around, there would be no problem.

The two of them didn’t stop. They passed by their previous position and continued to move in another direction.

A fork appeared in this direction very quickly.

Xia ruofei still chose a direction based on his intuition. Of course, he had expected that the underground palace would be very large and the passage would not change. So, to prevent himself from getting lost, he carved a mark with a military dagger at the fork.

This time, he was lucky. The Jade Leaf’s reaction was much stronger than before, which meant that Xia ruofei had guessed the right direction.

Xia ruofei asked as he walked,””Song Wei, did the places we passed by overlap with the area you entered last time?”

Song Wei shook her head and said with certainty,””Absolutely not! We didn’t find such a passage back then. ”

“It seems that the scale of this underground Palace is even larger than we imagined!” Xia ruofei said.

The two of them continued to venture deeper. Along the way, they encountered many forks in the road. These forks looked exactly the same. The passage was more than two meters high, with sculptures standing on both sides.

Xia ruofei also followed the guidance of the Jade Leaf and constantly corrected the route. Of course, he did not forget to mark every fork in the road.

Along the way, the Jade Leaf’s reaction was getting stronger and stronger. Xia ruofei was also excited and looking forward to it.

If it had always been a corridor like this, even though it was a little creepy to walk in, there was no danger. If they continued to go deeper, they would eventually find the world stone.

Although Song Wei did not know Xia ruofei’s real purpose, she did not ask. She just followed Xia ruofei closely. Every time Xia ruofei confirmed or changed his route, she never asked for the reason. She just treated it as Xia ruofei’s intuition.

However, as they walked, Xia ruofei suddenly stopped in his tracks and his expression turned ugly.

Song Wei didn’t understand and quickly asked,””What’s wrong?”

Xia ruofei’s voice was a little strange as he said,””We might be in trouble ...”

Just now, Xia Qing, who had been using her divine thoughts to observe the situation outside, suddenly gave a warning. She told Xia ruofei that there seemed to be a problem with this passage and asked him to immediately go back and check the route they had taken just now.

“What kind of trouble?” Song Wei asked in a trembling voice.

“It’s not clear yet, let’s go back first!” Xia ruofei said.

The two of them changed direction and walked to a fork in the road. Xia ruofei immediately shone the flashlight on the wall beside the statue. He was shocked.
