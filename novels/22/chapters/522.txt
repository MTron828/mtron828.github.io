Chapter 523: Paradise farmy...1

The farm guards quickly removed the roadblocks, and the extended Bentley slowly drove into paradise Farm.

What entered his eyes was a boundless grassland. The green grass swayed slightly in the breeze, setting off the blue sky and white clouds, making one feel relaxed and happy.

This was a six – thousand – hectare farm! In addition to the undulating terrain, it was basically impossible to see the edge with the naked eye.

As the Bentley drove through the picturesque farm, Liang Qichao introduced the place to them,””Ruofei, our Paradise Farm covers an area of about 6000 hectares and is distributed in a narrow and long shape. It’s about 4 kilometers wide from east to west and 15 kilometers from north to south. There are man – made lakes and rivers in the farm, so it has rich water and fertile land. Currently, the farm is mainly engaged in animal husbandry, with a total of more than 30000 sheep and 3000 Angus cows, the annual output value is about 8 million Australian dollars. ”

At that moment, the car passed by a very new – looking building. Liang Qichao pointed at the building outside and said,””This is my grandpa’s purebred horse breeding base. It covers an area of about 150 hectares, with a special track that can be fully irrigated, an all – Weather track, a swimming pool for horses, and a training ground that can accommodate 78 horses at the same time. This is my grandpa’s treasure!”

Tang He couldn’t help but laugh. He looked at the purebred horse base outside with pride.

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile. He understood this situation. When they signed the contract, Tang He specifically mentioned that this purebred horse breeding base would be independent, including the ownership of all the facilities and horse racing. The operation and management of the purebred horse breeding base would also be decided by Tang He alone. It would not change because of the change in the ownership of the farm.

“I’ll definitely come over and take a good look when I have time!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I heard that elder Tang has a few world – Class horse races under his name.”

“Hahaha! Then you’re here! I bought a new horse this year, fiont, and it’s living and training in this breeding base!” Tang He raised his head and laughed.

Tang He loved good food and horse racing. He had collected many of the world’s top horse racing horses and his horses often won gold and silver in major competitions around the world, earning him a lot of honor.

The car continued to drive forward, and soon a small farm located by an artificial lake came into view.

Liang Qichao said with a smile,”ruofei, other than the breeding base for purebred horses, our farm also has a farm, including a small villa, a warehouse, a veterinarian station, and ten ordinary houses. In addition, we also have a complete feeding shed, helipad, isolation house, and other facilities. You can say that the degree of modernization is still very high.”

The farm was the end of the trip. The car stopped in front of a small and exquisite villa.

The group alighted from the car. Xia ruofei took a deep breath. The air in Hunter Valley was filled with the unique fragrance of grapes. This was the most famous wine – producing area in all of Australia.

The man – made Lake next to it was sparkling, and there were a few swans swimming in the water. From time to time, birds would fly across the water, leaving behind ripples. In the distance was a green grassland. The afternoon sun was just right, making people feel a little lazy.

This was definitely a good place for a vacation! Xia ruofei sighed in his heart.

“Brother Liang, no wonder you look so good. I’m a little jealous of you ...” Xia ruofei said half – jokingly.

“Why don’t you give up on your business in China and come to Australia to focus on running this farm?” Liang Qichao laughed.

Xia ruofei suddenly said gloomily,”I wish!” But that’s not realistic at all. At least in the short term, the focus of my career will definitely be in China ...”

Liang Qichao shrugged and said,”then there’s no other way!” But now that you’re the big boss of Paradise Farm, you can come over anytime if you want to relax. There aren’t many rooms on the farm, but you can still stay with three to five girls!”

Tang He couldn’t help but laugh and teased,””Brother Xia, I think you should consider Qi Chao’s suggestion. When you want to come over, let me know in advance, and I’ll transfer you a private jet. It’s only eight or nine hours of flight from China, it’s very convenient!”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and said,”sure!” When I’ve gathered three to five girls, I won’t be polite with you ...” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Tang He raised his head and laughed.

The group walked into the only small villa in the 6000 – hectare farm.

Although it was only a small villa, it had 10 bedrooms and all kinds of facilities.

Paradise Farm was not one of those cheap, low – Quality farms. It was in an excellent location, only a hundred kilometers away from the central city of Sydney. Moreover, it was located in a tourist resort like the Hunter Valley, so it could basically solve all living needs within 20 kilometers.

Moreover, the farm had a telephone, internet, and other modern facilities.

It must be known that some nouveau riche in China blindly invested when they saw that Australian farms were cheap. As a result, they regretted buying them. Some farms did not even have water permits and could not use the designated amount of agricultural water. Some farms were legally allowed to carry extremely low livestock, and even though they had a vast area, they could not raise a few livestock. If they raised more than the livestock they could carry, they would be punished for animal abuse. Some farms were located in remote areas, and it would take two to three hours to drive to the nearest town. It could be said that they were completely isolated from the world ...
