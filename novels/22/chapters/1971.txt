1972 A good start (1)

MA Xiong took a look and said with a smile, “It’s United States. Li from the Kyushu group!”

The auction had attracted a lot of rich people, but Li Yifu was definitely one of the important guests. Among all the rich people present today, there were only a few who were richer than Li Yifu.

Even Tang He, who was a rich man, sent his subordinates to attend the event. Li Yifu was the only one who attended the event in person.

MA Xiong wanted to take a few steps forward to welcome him, but when he saw that Xia ruofei was standing still and had no intention of going over to welcome him, he thought for a while and decided not to.

Li Yifu obviously saw Xia ruofei and MA Xiong as well because he had obviously quickened his pace. The few retinues were not prepared for this and he even managed to put a distance between them.

“President Xia, Mr. MA!” Li Yifu greeted him from afar.

“Welcome to Hong Kong, Mr. Li!” “Thank you for your hard work!” MA Xiong said with a smile.

“Good, good!” Li Yifu replied absent – mindedly.

Xia ruofei looked at Li Yifu indifferently and then said to MA Xiong,””Grandpa MA, you should go to the venue and greet your friends first! I have something to discuss with Mr. Li. ”

MA Xiong was stunned for a moment before he replied,”Alright, alright! Then you guys take your time to chat! Mr. Li, I’ll be leaving now ...”

Li Yifu smiled and nodded.

After MA Xiong left, Li Yifu shot a look at his subordinates, asking them to move away. Then, he followed Xia ruofei to the side.

Since there were no outsiders around, Li Yifu immediately said in a low voice with a respectful expression,””Senior granduncle!”

“Why are you here again?” Xia ruofei said,”can’t you just stay in America?”

“This ... Martial granduncle’s company is holding an auction, so this disciple naturally has to come and support!” Li Yifu said.

Xia ruofei said unhappily,”I think you’re having an easier time as the chairman than I am!” Was a Financial Group worth tens of billions of dollars really that easy to manage? Flying all over the world all day without having to take care of anything?”

“Senior granduncle,” Li Yifu said awkwardly,”I rarely get involved in the company’s Affairs anymore. It’s all handled by the younger generation of the family.”

Then, Li Yifu quickly explained,””Senior granduncle, I’ve been bestowed with spiritual crystals and treasures by you. I’ve made rapid progress in my cultivation in the past few days, but at the same time, I’m confused about many things. I hope that I can take advantage of this opportunity to get some advice from you, Grand granduncle.”

After all, Li Yifu did not cultivate the complete Guiyuan Scripture. The cultivation method named Guiyuan Scripture was actually an incomplete version of it. As the cultivation method was incomplete, he would naturally encounter various problems and confusion when he cultivated it.

After Xia ruofei gave him a spiritual crystal, it was as if the hardware for cultivation had improved a lot. However, the software for cultivation techniques was still lacking. Therefore, the faster the cultivation speed, the more confusion he would have.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”we’ll see!” If I have enough time, I can answer a few of your questions!”

“Thank you, grand uncle – Master!” Li Yifu was overjoyed and quickly said.

His voice was a little loud due to his excitement. Xia ruofei quickly glared at him, then looked around and said,”Lower your voice!”

“Oh! Martial granduncle, this disciple understands!” Li Yifu said in a low voice.

“Also! “When you go in later, behave normally. Don’t be so respectful all the time ...” Xia ruofei said.

“I understand!” Li Yifu said.

“Right, during the auction, you’re not allowed to randomly increase the price!” Xia ruofei said,”I’m well aware of the auction price of these items. If you call out a price that is far higher than the actual value, then you can blame me for not being polite to you when I come down!”

“Oh ... I understand!” Li Yifu said,”don’t worry, senior granduncle. I will definitely remember your instructions!”

In fact, Li Yifu really wanted to do that. In his opinion, this was an auction where his grand uncle – Master was personally present. If the final price of the auction item was too low, wouldn’t it be a disgrace to his grand uncle – Master?

For Li Yifu, even if he bought all the items for auction at twice or thrice the price, that amount of money was only a drop in the bucket.

However, Xia ruofei had killed this thought in the bud. He could only behave himself during the auction. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Alright, let’s not stay outside for too long. It’s almost time, let’s go in!” Xia ruofei said.

“Senior granduncle, please!” Li Yifu quickly said.

“I’m half a host, and you’re our guest today! He was a billionaire! Who do you think should go first?” Xia ruofei said in a low voice,”remember your identity!”

“Yes, yes, yes! Then this disciple will overstep his boundaries!” Li Yifu quickly said.

Xia ruofei finally showed a warm smile and raised his voice.””Mr. Li, this way please!”

Li Yifu and Xia ruofei walked into conference hall No. 1 one after the other. The spotlights immediately flashed to look at Li Yifu, who was a rich man. He would definitely be chased by the media if he came to attend the event.

Just the title of “a billionaire in Hong Kong attended an auction in Hong Kong” was enough to attract readers.

In this sense, Li Yifu’s original intention had been achieved. His presence alone had increased the topic of discussion at the auction.
