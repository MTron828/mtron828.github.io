Chapter 309: There’s something wrong with your brain (1)

“RUO Fei, we’re almost there!” “Is everything ready?” Liang Qichao asked. “Don’t worry!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’m already waiting for you in the warehouse! You can just drive over to the location I shared on WeChat!” “Alright!” Liang Qichao said. Xia ruofei opened the warehouse door and walked out. Not long after, he saw a row of cars turning in from the intersection. Soon, the first car arrived at the entrance of the warehouse. Liang Qichao, who was sitting in the front seat, lowered the window and waved at Xia ruofei. The car drove a few meters past the warehouse before stopping. This way, the second car could Park at the entrance of the warehouse. Liang Qichao quickly got out of the first car and walked back. At this time, the second car had just stopped. Liang Xiaojun, who was in the front seat, got out of the car and quickly walked to the back seat to open the door. Xia ruofei saw a silver – haired old man in a rice – colored Tang suit get out of the back seat of the Mercedes – Benz. He knew that this must be Liang Qichao’s cousin, old master Tang. As expected, Liang Qichao walked over and introduced them,””Grandpa, this is my friend Xia ruofei. He was the one who helped me find the Phoebe zhennan material. Ruofei, this is my United States cousin whom I’ve told you about before. ” “It’s a pleasure to meet you, elder Tang!”Xia ruofei smiled. He had already found out from Liang Qichao that the old man’s surname was Tang. Tang He laughed and took the initiative to shake hands with Xia ruofei, saying,””Mr. Xia, I’ve troubled you with my matter! Thank you!” “You’re too polite!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Then, Xia ruofei’s gaze fell on Liang Weimin and Yuan Shan, who were standing beside Liang Qichao. He said,””Brother Liang, these two must be uncle and Auntie!” “Right!” Liang Qichao nodded and said,”dad, mom, this is my good friend, Xia ruofei!” “Hello, little Xia!” Liang Weimin said with a smile. “Hello, uncle and Auntie!” Then, Liang Qichao asked impatiently,””Ruofei, that piece of Phoebe zhennan material is in the warehouse, right?” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”Yes, I’m ready.” Elder Tang, please come in!” “Hahaha! Good, good, good. ” Said elder Tang. Xia ruofei made an inviting gesture and led elder Tang into the warehouse. Liang Qichao and the rest followed behind. As soon as they entered the warehouse, everyone’s eyes fell on the Phoebe zhennan wood in the middle of the warehouse. They had all seen Liang Weihua’s raw material just now, so when they looked at this one again, they naturally had an intuitive comparison. First of all, this piece of material was obviously much thicker than Liang Weihua ‘s. The difference between a diameter of 1.25 meters and a diameter of one meter was still very obvious. Besides, Xia ruofei’s piece of material was at least ten meters long, almost twice the length of Liang Weihua ‘s. Regardless of whether it was real or fake, just his size alone was already very visually impactful. Elder Tang’s eyes also lit up as he quickly stepped forward to take a closer look. Liang Weimin’s expression was a little apprehensive, but at the same time, his eyes revealed a hint of anticipation. Liang Weihua and Liang Xiaojun both frowned slightly. They were very nervous at the moment. They didn’t believe that Liang Qichao could be so lucky to find a piece of Phoebe zhennan that was better than their one at the last moment. However, when they saw the piece of material, they were extremely worried. Both father and son clenched their fists secretly. Everyone’s eyes fell on elder Tang. Elder Tang, on the other hand, examined it very slowly and carefully. He circled the wood several times to examine it, especially the cut section. Finally, the old man’s face revealed a trace of excitement. He raised his head and announced,””This is indeed goldsilk Phoebe! And it’s a top – grade old material!” As soon as the old man finished speaking, Liang Weihua and Liang Xiaojun’s expressions changed, while Liang Weimin and Liang Qichao cheered in their hearts. Especially Liang Weimin, who had been worried about his personal gains and losses, finally smiled as if he had been relieved of a heavy burden. Liang Weihua frowned slightly and said,”uncle, you might not understand the situation in China. The level of forgery by illegal businesses these days is very high. It’s almost as if they’re passing off the fake as the real thing. This piece of material is different from the one I have. I’ve specially asked an expert in the industry to appraise mine. I can guarantee that it’s ...” “Wei Hua, what do you mean by that!” Liang Weimin glared at him and interrupted Liang Weihua, saying,”are you doubting uncle’s judgment?” Liang Weihua snorted and said,”Liang Weimin, stop twisting my words!” I’m just worried that uncle doesn’t know the chaos in the domestic market of Phoebe zhennan and has fallen into the trap of someone with ill intentions! Especially if some people collude with each other and help others, it’s really impossible to guard against!” “Liang Weihua! You better explain yourself!” Liang Weimin’s face immediately fell, and he said angrily,”who are you calling a traitor!” “It’s better to be safe than sorry!” Liang Weihua put on a fake smile and said,”I know you want to perform well in front of uncle, but you didn’t find it earlier or later. When you found a Phoebe zhennan material on my side, you suddenly found another one, and it happened to be bigger than mine. This is too much of a coincidence! I can’t help but be suspicious!” Xia ruofei was watching coldly from the side. Seeing this scene, he couldn’t help but turn around and ask,””Brother Liang, is this the relative who found the Phoebe zhennan? Was there something wrong with his brain? Persecutory delusion?” Liang Qichao could not help but shake his head and laugh,””Ruofei, this ... I don’t know much about uncle Wei Hua’s health, so I can’t rule out the possibility you mentioned!” Xia ruofei did not lower her voice on purpose, and Liang Qichao did not hold back when he saw that Liang Weihua had already fallen out with his father. Hence, everyone in the room could hear their conversation clearly. The Liang family’s relatives had come to watch the show, and when they saw this, they all looked at Liang Weihua, as if they wanted to see the world in chaos. Liang Weihua’s face turned ashen. He narrowed his eyes and stared at Xia ruofei.”Young man, you should watch your mouth! So as to avoid trouble from the mouth!” “Nonsense!” Xia ruofei said rudely,”Who are you? You’re pointing fingers at my things in my warehouse, and you’re putting basins of dirty water on my head. Do I have to be polite to you? I’m not that cheap!” “You ...” Liang Weihua was so angry that he was trembling. Liang Xiaojun also glared at Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei turned a blind eye to the father and son’s murderous gazes. He turned to elder Tang and said,””Old man, since your junior has doubts, then I’ll keep this golden Nannan material for myself! I don’t want to become a swindler who colludes with people from the inside before I even do business! It just so happens that a boss from Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province has begged me several times. If it wasn’t for brother Liang, this piece of material wouldn’t have been left until now. I might as well...Just sell it to him!”Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com
