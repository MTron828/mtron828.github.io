3033 The star evolution formation (2)

Xia ruofei’s current array Dao level was much higher than when he had set up the void xuanqing array on the Peach Blossom Island.

Although he had spent most of his time studying the rules of space, he still needed to change his mind sometimes. Therefore, he had taken out the knowledge in the Jade talisman of inheritance to study. Even though the time he had spent on learning was very little, it was still a very long time in the span of a thousand years.

Hence, Xia ruofei had basically studied all the books on arrays in the Jade talisman of inheritance thoroughly. He had also done the same for the other Miscellaneous Studies.

However, he did not have the opportunity to practice it in the inner space of the ore.

But no matter what, his current level of array Dao theory was much higher than before.

Xia ruofei had no idea how much it had improved, but he could easily understand the blueprint. This was also a direct reflection of Jian Jia’s past. He would probably have to spend a long time to understand the blueprint.

But now, Xia ruofei could clearly simulate the operation of the entire array just by looking at the structure.

Furthermore, unlike Luo Qingfeng, who only knew how to operate the array and did not know the reason behind it, Xia ruofei could basically tell at a glance why the genius elder of the star Seizer sect had set it up in such a way. He only needed to think a little to figure out the deep meaning behind each array pattern.

Luo Qingfeng did not dare to disturb them and stood quietly beside Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei, on the other hand, was engrossed in studying the blueprint.

He looked at it for a full half an hour before letting out a long sigh of relief. He then carefully folded the blueprint.

Xia ruofei had to admit that the formation that the genius elder had set up was indeed very advanced. There were many clever ideas, and even Xia ruofei couldn’t help but clap his hands in admiration.

One could imagine that the star Seizer sect’s ancestor must have been extremely talented in the Dao of formations.

However, the star Seizer sect’s Foundation wasn’t particularly deep. No matter how talented that genius elder was, he didn’t have the unique learning conditions that Xia ruofei had. It was impossible for him to come into contact with so many array books of different schools. To put it bluntly, his vision was still a little narrow.

One’s vision determined one’s outlook.

This stellar evolution formation was exquisite, but the overall structure was not Grand enough.

At least, that was what Xia ruofei thought.

After he finished studying the blueprint, he had already formed a few directions for improvement in his mind, even though he had not checked the array and the control core on the spot.

Xia ruofei heaved a sigh of relief.

If he looked at it for a long time and realized that he couldn’t change it, then it would really be a little embarrassing.

Luo Qingfeng looked at Xia ruofei and asked with a hint of anticipation,””Master, what do you think? Is there any room for improvement in our sect – protecting formation?”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””I’m almost done with the blueprint. I’ll look at it again in a while and try out this formation when necessary. If I’m not wrong, there should be a few areas that are worth improving!”

Luo Qingfeng was overjoyed and quickly said,””That’s great! Master, how do you need this old servant to cooperate? please tell me!”

Other than one of Luo Qingfeng’s most trusted disciples, only he could control the sect – protecting array.

This was also a rule passed down from generation to generation within the star Seizer sect.

Furthermore, the only one who could truly control the array was Luo Qingfeng himself. The reason why he had arranged for a trusted disciple to learn some of the array’s control functions was also to prevent a strong enemy from attacking when the sect leader was not in the sect.

Although the sect – protecting array would automatically activate its defense when it was attacked, if no one was controlling the array, the defensive power would be much weaker.

When Luo Qingfeng heard that there was room for improvement, his first thought was to fully cooperate with Xia ruofei. He would do his best to cooperate with Xia ruofei no matter how he tested the array technique.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,””You just watch from the side. If there’s a problem with my control, you can remind me in time.”

“Ah?” Luo Qingfeng was stunned for a moment.

He had not taught Xia ruofei how to control the formation!

Could it be that this thing could be self – taught?

Before Luo Qingfeng could react, Xia ruofei had already flipped his hand and took out a few spiritual stones. He skillfully inserted them into the core control of the array. Then, he pressed on the core control with both hands and released his spiritual power ...

This stellar evolution formation was usually in a hidden state and only retained its basic defensive functions. Thus, the energy required was naturally very small.

However, when he wanted to test the various functions of the formation, he had to put in more spirit stones to ensure the supply of energy.

When Luo Qingfeng saw Xia ruofei’s skillful operation, the control core lit up slightly and started to operate smoothly.

Luo Qingfeng was dumbfounded by the scene.

He had controlled this formation for decades, and he didn’t even need to release his spiritual power to check it out. He could confirm that the formation’s defensive function had been fully activated. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Then, Xia ruofei changed the way he operated his spiritual power a few more times. The formation was like an obedient child. Under Xia ruofei’s control, it kept changing its functions.

While Xia ruofei was controlling the formation, his spiritual power had already spread out. Not only did he observe the operation of the formation in the entire Zhai Xing Lou, but he also extended his spiritual power further to observe the state of the formation. He also verified some of his judgments when he was looking at the blueprint.

After a while, Xia ruofei kept the spiritual stone.

At this time, the stellar evolution formation had also obediently returned to its dormant “standby” state.

Luo Qingfeng’s head was spinning, as if he was in a dream.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Qingfeng, I’ve already taken a good look.” However, I still need to think about how to improve it. There are a few prototypes that I need to confirm the direction of improvement and then perfect. It might take two to three days!”

Luo Qingfeng came back to his senses and was still a little dumbfounded.

The operation of the star evolution formation was very complicated. After he was confirmed as the successor of the sect master, he had to learn for more than two months before he could barely get started, and this was under the circumstances of having someone to teach him.

Xia ruofei, on the other hand, was completely self – taught. He had only studied the blueprint for half an hour and could actually operate it so skillfully. It was really infuriating to compare people!

Besides, he had heard from Xia ruofei that he had come up with several prototypes of the improvement plan in such a short time. From what Xia ruofei had said, he was going to pick a plan to perfect.

Since when did modifying a sect – protecting array become as easy as eating and drinking? and they could even be picky ...

If he wasn’t a genius, then how could the so – called geniuses of the other sects bear it?

“Qingfeng?” Seeing Luo Qingfeng’s dazed look, Xia ruofei could not help but call out to him.

Luo Qingfeng finally came back to his senses and quickly replied,””Master, this old servant is really too astounded...Originally, this old servant wanted to explain to master how to control this star evolution formation, but I didn’t expect that master could master it without a teacher ... This old servant is really a frog in the well!”

“I saw this from the blueprint!” Xia ruofei said,”as long as you can understand the blueprint and the operation of the formation, it’s not difficult to control it. It’s not difficult for those who know it!”

Qingfeng Luo suddenly felt like he had received a critical hit of tens of thousands of points ...

...

Until now, he had not understood the principle of the star evolution formation. He only knew how to control it according to the control method taught by the old head. As far as he knew, not many of the past sect leaders of the star Seizer sect had truly understood the principles behind this formation. The vast majority of them knew how it worked, but not how it worked.

Xia ruofei only spent half an hour to understand the principle of the entire formation.

Now, he had casually said,”it’s not difficult to meet him.” If Xia ruofei was not Luo Qingfeng’s master, he might really break off all ties with Xia ruofei. This was really infuriating ...
