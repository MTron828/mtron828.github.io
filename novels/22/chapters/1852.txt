Chapter 1853: Imparting knowledge and answering questions (1)

Translator: 549690339

After returning to Taoyuan farm, Xia ruofei said to Li Yifu,””Foster husband, during this period of time, you can tell me if there are any problems with your cultivation. I will try my best to answer them for you.”

“Many thanks, grand uncle – Master!” Li Yifu said gratefully.

Since it was related to cultivation, Li Yifu didn’t try to be polite. He immediately voiced out some of the questions that had been bothering him.

The Guiyuan Scripture that Li Yifu cultivated was born out of the Guiyuan true Scripture, or to be more precise, it was the defective version of the Guiyuan true Scripture.

Xia ruofei had already imprinted the original “Guiyuan Scripture” into his mind through the inheritance of the Jade talisman. Although he had never tried to cultivate it, he had a deep understanding of this technique after spending some time. After all, this inheritance not only contained the content of the technique but also some cultivation experience of predecessors.

Some of Li Yifu’s questions were due to his incomplete martial arts techniques, which led to a deviation in his understanding. Some were because his own comprehension had not reached that level yet. Xia ruofei could basically answer these questions easily.

From Li Yifu’s point of view, Xia ruofei’s seemingly simple words could make him feel enlightened. After a long talk, Li Yifu felt that he had benefited a lot, which was better than if he had immersed himself in cultivation for a month.

His heart was naturally filled with gratitude.

While Xia ruofei was giving Li Yifu pointers, Ling Qingxue was also listening with interest. The ultimate truth of heaven and earth was the same, and she had some vague feelings about it. However, the time she had been exposed to cultivation was too short. In addition, she had only cultivated the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” and had not dabbled in other cultivation techniques. Thus, she had not been able to comprehend anything by analogy, so she did not gain much.

Even so, Ling Qingxue still felt that when Xia ruofei was teaching Li Yifu, she was mesmerized by the spirit that he exuded. At the same time, she also felt that the path of cultivation was vast and profound.

Li Yifu stood up and bowed deeply to Xia ruofei. He said from the bottom of his heart,””Martial granduncle’s words are better than this disciple’s ten years of hard practice! This disciple thanks martial granduncle for your kindness in teaching!”

Xia ruofei accepted the bow and smiled.””Foster husband, now that you have a spiritual crystal in your hand, you shouldn’t have any bottlenecks in your cultivation in the short term. I suggest you return to the United States as soon as possible and cultivate in seclusion for a while. You’ll definitely make a breakthrough!”

“I’ll take care of the things in China and return to the United States immediately!”Li Yifu said respectfully.

In fact, Li Yifu did not care much about business matters. This trip was mainly for Xia ruofei. However, he had sent an aircraft to Xia ruofei this time. He still had to stay behind to deal with the ownership transfer of the aircraft and the rental of the airport space. As the aircraft was Xia ruofei ‘s, he would not feel at ease if it was left to someone else.

Then, Li Yifu said,”martial granduncle, this disciple will take his leave!” I’ll come back to say goodbye to you before I return to the United States!”

Xia ruofei nodded.”Alright, I won’t keep you here. Go back and cultivate!”

“Disciple will take his leave!” Li Yifu bowed to Xia ruofei, then turned around and left the villa.

When they heard the sound of the car driving away, Ling Qingxue finally said to Xia ruofei,””Ruofei, someone gave you a plane and you didn’t even ask him to stay for a meal?”

It was almost lunchtime. Ling Qingxue thought that Xia ruofei would at least ask Li Yifu to stay for a meal or at least be polite. She did not expect Xia ruofei to let Li Yifu leave without even putting on a show.

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”why should we keep him for dinner?” Everyone felt uncomfortable, right? And ... If they wanted to eat, someone had to cook, right? If I were to cook, would my foster husband dare to stay idle by the side? If he were to cook, hehe ... I can’t guarantee what he’ll do. ”

Li Yifu looked like he had been pampered since he was a child, and after he started cultivating, he would not come into contact with cooking. He might be very capable, but he might not know how to cook.

Ling Qingxue was stunned for a moment. She smiled bitterly and said,””Now that you’ve put it that way, it does make a little bit of sense!”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”it’s very reasonable, okay?” Besides, as my Grand disciple, what’s wrong with him giving me a plane? Even if we didn’t have this relationship, I would still have given him a gift! And it’s worth far more than an Airplane!”

When Xia ruofei said this, Ling Qingxue also remembered this. She clicked her tongue and said,””Ruofei, if Li Yifu didn’t tell me today, I wouldn’t have known that the spiritual crystal was so precious ... Isn’t it a waste for you to give it to me for cultivation?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”spiritual crystals are meant for cultivation!” How could it be wasted? Besides, you’re my wife. No matter how good it is, it’s not a waste to use it on you!”

Ling Qingxue felt a surge of warmth in her heart when she heard that. She looked at Xia ruofei with tenderness and love.

Xia ruofei chuckled and continued,””Don’t worry! I still have a few of these spirit crystals. Just focus on your cultivation and don’t worry about resources!”

“En!” Ling Qingxue nodded and said,”RUO Fei, you’re so good to me!”

“Hehe, I’m so good to you, shouldn’t you reward me?” Xia ruofei asked with an evil smile. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ling Qingxue saw the look in Xia ruofei’s eyes and knew what he was thinking. She couldn’t help but blush and said in a low voice,”Quickly go and cook! I’m so hungry!”
