“Brother Xia!” Wu Lei smiled and asked,”are you busy these days? Everyone really misses you!”

“I’ve been quite busy recently. ” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”Lei Zi, how’s the team’s performance recently?”

“Everyone’s been in good shape for the last few matches, and the results are quite good!” Wu Lei said happily,”in the last six games, we have achieved three wins, two draws, and one loss. Now we are completely far away from the relegation zone. It can be said that the task of staying in the league can be declared a success. At present, we are only four points away from the theoretical European region. Everyone is now rubbing their fists and full of confidence. They want to rush up in one go. Maybe next season, we can also experience the European competition!”

“Three wins, two draws, and one loss? That’s a pretty good result!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”could it be that the opponents in the recent rounds are just average?”

“Actually, we won ‘t. The three games we won were all from the league’s roaming teams. We even forced a draw with Real Sociedad and getafie. These are all top – ranked teams!” Wu Lei said, and then said with some embarrassment,”the only game we lost was to Real Madrid ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”Are there a lot of Catalan media mocking you as ‘free point boys’ again?”

The grudges between the teams in La Liga were also a topic that the fans enjoyed talking about. After Xia ruofei entered Espanyol, he naturally understood some of the grudges related to Espanyol. As the two Barcelona teams, the Spanish and Barcelona teams were naturally incompatible. Although there was a big gap in strength between the Spanish and the other team, every time the two sides faced each other, the Spanish players did not need to mobilize at all. They just played and did their best every time, playing 100% or even 120% of their strength. Although they lost more than they won, they did cause a lot of trouble for Barcelona.

Compared to when they played Barcelona, they were on steroids. When they played against Real Madrid, another “two heroes of the Western Premier League,” the Spanish team’s fighting spirit was not as strong. Under the huge gap in strength, the Spanish team lost most of the games without any resistance.

As a result, some of the Catalonian media’s pro – Barcelona media were naturally very displeased. They were determined to fight against Barcelona. If Barcelona did not buck up and play with all their might, they might be forced into a draw or even lose the game. Then, the RCD Espanyol would immediately lose to Real Madrid. Wouldn’t that be a great help to Real Madrid in disguise? In the face of the Spanish players, bar?a naturally had to do their best. Every time, it consumed a lot of physical energy, and in the hot – blooded Derby, the probability of injury was greatly increased.

As a result, the media ridiculed the Spaniards as Real Madrid’s underlings. Every time they faced Real Madrid, they acted as “free point boys,” with the purpose of stopping Barcelona. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Wu Lei laughed in embarrassment and said,””The difference in strength in that game was too great, and on our side, iglesias accumulated yellow cards and was suspended. The few opportunities we had to fight back were not played ...”

“If you lose, then you lose! Who cares what others say!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

He was now the owner of Espanyol and also a first team player. Naturally, he shared the same enemy as the Spaniards. Although he did not hate bar?a, he did not care about the media’s views.

“Yes, we’ll just be good ourselves.” Wu Lei said. Then, he hesitated for a moment and asked,”brother Xia, are you free next weekend? Can you come back and play a game on behalf of our team?”

Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”is this your own idea or the team’s request?”

“Manager Ruby can’t wait for you to represent the team in every game ...” Wu Lei said with a smile.”The players are the same. You have completely conquered everyone with one game. I can see that at the critical moment of the team, everyone really wants you to come out and help the team win, but they don’t dare to mention it!”

“Zhou leiyun didn’t say anything?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Director Zhou didn’t specifically mention this, but after the last match, he chatted with me for a while and expressed his intention in this regard.” Wu Lei said,”it’s probably because director Zhou felt that you took care of me more, so he hoped to find out your thoughts through me! If you don’t want to, no one will force you!”

Wu Lei was honest and did not hide anything from Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I knew it. Zhou leiyun is indeed a sly old fox!” Lei Zi, which team are you playing against next? What time is it?”

Wu Lei was stunned for a moment before he asked in surprise,””Brother Xia, you mean ...”

“I have to give you face!” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”it just so happens that I’m done with my work recently. I still have time to fly over and play one or two matches.”

Actually, Zhou leiyun’s plan was to use Wu Lei to sound out Xia ruofei’s intentions. If Xia ruofei was willing to play for the team, he would definitely call the team personally to invite the players and coaches. They might think that Zhou leiyun and Xia ruofei were both owners of the team. In terms of wealth, Zhou leiyun had more, and Xia ruofei could at most be on the same level as Zhou leiyun. In reality, Zhou leiyun knew very well that there was a huge gap between him and Xia ruofei. If it was not for the ties of the Spanish team, he would not even be able to enter Xia ruofei’s circle.
