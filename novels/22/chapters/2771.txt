If the Chinese Football Association had not publicly announced on Weibo that Xia ruofei was not willing to join the national team, he only needed to inform Zhao Yongjun and the others. Then, the Chinese Football Association would definitely ignore the appeal of the netizens. They had been used to this anyway.

Of course, Xia ruofei also had the desire to serve the country. After all, he had loved football since he was young. When the national football team made it to the World Cup in Korea and Japan, although he was still young, he could still remember the National celebration.

Although Xia ruofei’s feelings for the national football team were not as great as a famous commentator had said, Chinese football would always be his Holy Grail no matter how many people’s spittoons it was. But at least Xia ruofei was not like some fake fans who used the national football team as a target to vent their negative emotions and defamed the national football team without any bottom line.

If he could help and change the national football team, and even help the national football team advance to the World Cup, he was still willing to do his part.

“Sure,” Feng Jing nodded.”As long as you set the tone, we’ll handle the rest!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”how about this?” I’ll respond to the Chinese Football Association’s invitation on the internet. I’ll do it myself. You can contact the Chinese Football Association in advance and tell them that I hope to be able to talk to the relevant responsible comrades about this matter in person. However, the specific time will have to be arranged again. I may not be free in the next few months. ”

“Alright!” Feng Rao replied.

“Sister che, is there anything else?” Xia ruofei asked.

Feng Jing spread her hands.”Busy man, you can continue to disappear. But I hope you can at least keep in touch with me on your phone. That way, if the company needs you to make any decisions, we’ll be able to find you.”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”I promise I’ll do it!” Um ... If you really can’t get through to my phone, you can try to call me later, or just leave me a message. I promise you that I won’t lose contact for a long time!”

Xia ruofei was thinking that if he activated the shield mode of the formation on Peach Blossom Island, he might really lose contact with the outside world. Of course, unless there were special circumstances, the entire Paradise Island would not be blocked. After all, Paradise Island was not like the encampment of other cultivation sects, which had been hidden for hundreds of years. Paradise Island itself could be found on the open sea Map or even on Google Earth, so there was no need to block it.

If the Peach Blossom Island were to suddenly disappear, it would attract the attention of people with ulterior motives.

“Alright,” Feng Rao said helplessly. I got it. ”

Xia ruofei picked up the handbag on the table and said,””Sister che, I really have something urgent to attend to. I’ll take my leave first! We’ll keep in touch on the phone regarding the national football team!”

“Alright!” “Drive slowly!” Feng Jing said.

“I know!” Xia ruofei quickly walked out of the office and waved at Feng Jing without looking back.

Feng Rao shook her head with a bitter smile and also walked out.

Xia ruofei drove as fast as he could to the large warehouse in the city. He finally arrived twenty minutes before the agreed time with the winery.

He heaved a sigh of relief. After locking the warehouse door from the inside, he quickly used his mental strength to check the warehouse and the surrounding conditions. Then, he took out jars of Drunken Eight Immortals from the spirit map space and placed them neatly in the warehouse.

After doing all this, Xia ruofei rested for a while. The car sent by the winery arrived.

They had just delivered the newly produced Drunken Eight Immortals wine.

The handover process was already familiar. The workers first unloaded the new wine from the truck, transported it all into the warehouse, and placed it neatly on the other side.

Then, he loaded the jars of Drunken Eight Immortals wine that had been “modified” by Xia ruofei into the empty truck.

After about an hour, the loading and unloading work was completed.

The manager of the winery shook Xia ruofei’s hand to express his gratitude, then left the warehouse with his team.

Xia ruofei returned to the warehouse and locked the door.

Then, with a slight thought, the new wine that had just been transported into the warehouse disappeared into thin air. Very quickly, they were all transported to the spirit map space.

Immediately after, Xia ruofei took out the medicinal herbs that Xia Qing had prepared in advance from the spirit map space. The bags of medicinal herbs were handled very well, and Xia Qing had even added a label on each bag. All Xia ruofei needed to do was to separate them into different categories and put them away.

This time, Xia ruofei had prepared a lot of ingredients, enough for Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory to use for a long time. Even if the pharmaceutical group’s factory and the Changping branch were to start working, these raw materials would definitely be able to last for a while.

With the free labor of the mercenaries, the spirit map space’s herb garden expanded at an extremely fast speed. Although many herbs were still growing and had not reached the peak of harvest, Xia Qing had accumulated quite a lot of herbs over this period of time. This time, Xia ruofei took all of them out.

In any case, he would be able to harvest more and more medicinal herbs in the future.

Xia ruofei looked at the medicinal bags that filled half the warehouse and felt a sense of achievement.

He gave Xue Jinshan a call to tell him that the medicinal herbs were ready and that he should immediately send a car over to receive them.

After Xue Jinshan finished his meeting, he had already gathered all the trucks. He knew that as long as Xia ruofei gave the order, they would be in place soon. As expected, he received a call from Xia ruofei not long after he returned to the construction site in Changping County.

Xue Jinshan was very excited and immediately called for a car to transport the goods to the warehouse. It was not the first time he received raw materials from the warehouse. He was already very familiar with it without Xia ruofei sending him the address.

After Xue Jinshan finished the call, he immediately drove his own car from the construction site in Changping County to the warehouse in the city.

Xia ruofei sat in the warehouse, bored. He even took out some crystals and cultivated for a while.

It was only when he heard the sound of the truck’s engine outside that he stopped his cultivation. He put away the crystals and walked over to open the warehouse door.

Xue Jinshan had already met up with the convoy on the way. When he saw Xia ruofei, he said,”Chairman, you’ve personally come to arrange the raw materials. It’s really hard on you!”

Xia ruofei laughed and scolded,”cut the crap!” If I can’t get the raw materials for you today, you brat, don’t know what you’re going to say behind my back, do you?”

“I wouldn’t dare!” Xue Jinshan laughed.

As he spoke, he walked into the warehouse and saw the medicine packets piled up like a small mountain. He couldn’t help but gasp and call out,””Woof! All of these ingredients are for our pharmaceutical factory?”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”too much?” Then pull less! I’ll return it!”

“Don ‘t!” Xue Jinshan quickly smiled apologetically,”I was just too surprised! This has far exceeded my expectations! Chairman, this is all money! How can we return it when it’s already here?”

As if he was worried that Xia ruofei would go back on his words, Xue Jinshan quickly called for the workers to start moving the goods.

The workers were busy moving bags of processed Chinese medicinal herbs while Xue Jinshan kept Xia ruofei company and talked. After moving for more than an hour, half of the warehouse was finally finished.

Xue Jinshan’s trucks weren’t enough. After loading two trucks, he estimated that it was enough, so he quickly transferred three more trucks over. In the end, eight large trucks were needed to load all the medicinal herbs. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Xue Jinshan was in a hurry to go to the warehouse of the pharmaceutical factory to settle this batch of raw materials. After thanking Xia ruofei for his support in his work, he bade farewell to Xia ruofei and led the team to the warehouse of the Tao Yuan pharmaceutical factory.

Xia ruofei had finally settled some trivial matters. When he was at Taoyuan farm, he even took some time to go to the main water tower of the farm and the pomfrets breeding workshop to add some spirit Heart Flower petal solution. With his current cultivation, he could naturally do it without anyone noticing.

Xia ruofei locked the warehouse and drove back to the jiangbin villa district.
