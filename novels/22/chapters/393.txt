Chapter 394: Jaded skin ointment is on fire (2)

In the secretary’s office.

Chief Cai from the Sanshan city’s Bureau of finance was waiting. He had been there for more than ten minutes, but there was still no movement from Tian Huilan’s office.

“Director Xiao, when will Secretary Tian be free?” chief Cai couldn’t help asking.

Xiao Mei replied politely,”director Cai, I’m not too sure about this. There are visitors to the secretary’s office. I can’t confirm the exact time.”

“Then ... May I ask, who is the person in the secretary’s office now?” Chief Cai asked.

“It’s the deputy head of Changping County, Wu Liqian,” Xiao Mei said.

“Oh ... Thank you!” Bureau chief Cai sighed.

He had no choice but to continue waiting. Chief Cai naturally knew Wu Liqian. To be precise, there was no cadre in Sanshan city who did not know Wu Liqian’s name. She had been by Secretary Tian’s side when he was the mayor. Everyone knew that although Secretary Tian’s Secretary had been replaced by Xiao Mei, Wu Liqian was still the cadre closest to him.

Other people might need to make an appointment to come over, and there was a time limit for reporting work, but Wu Liqian certainly did not have these restrictions.

Even if something major happened, chief Cai wouldn’t dare to let Xiao Mei go in and urge her.

Fortunately, he didn’t have to wait too long. About ten minutes later, the door to Tian Huilan’s office opened. Wu Liqian walked out and closed the door gently.

“County Head Wu, how are you?” Chief Cai came up and greeted him.

“Chief Cai, I’m sorry. I spoke to the Secretary for a while and took up your precious time.” Wu Liqian said with a smile.

“It’s fine, it’s fine ...” Bureau chief Cai said quickly.

Even though he was the God of Fortune of Sanshan city and was half a level higher than Wu Liqian, he still didn’t dare to act arrogantly in front of her.

While the two of them were chatting, Xiao Mei had already gone in to report. She came out and said,””Chief Cai, the Secretary invites you in. However, she needs to attend a meeting in 20 minutes. Please control the time to around 15 minutes. ”

“Okay, thank you, director Xiao!” Chief Cai said quickly.

Then, she greeted Wu Liqian and hurriedly knocked on Tian Huilan’s office door.

Xiao Mei pulled Wu Liqian aside and asked in a low voice,””County Head Wu, did you ask the Secretary about the cosmetics?” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“I’m afraid you’ll be disappointed, director Xiao,”Wu Liqian said with a smile. The Secretary did use a face mask, but it’s not available on the market. It was handmade by her friend, so ...”

Wu Liqian shrugged her shoulders.

“Oh, I see ...” Xiao Mei said with disappointment,”thank you, Mayor Wu!”

“You’re welcome. I’ll go back first!” Wu Liqian said with a smile.

“Take care!”

……

On the outskirts of San Shan city, Xia ruofei’s rented warehouse was already filled with huge wine jars.

Xia ruofei watched as the big truck with the wine left. He turned back to the warehouse and locked the door from the inside.

Over the past few days, the winery had already stored about 90 tons of Drunken Eight Immortals white wine into large wine jars and transported them to the warehouse in batches.

Most of the wine was stored in ordinary wine jars of 500 catties, and about 20 tons were stored in wine jars of different glaze colors. In addition to the color difference, these wine jars were also attached with obvious labels and dates, which were easy to see at a glance.

The ordinary wine jars contained the kind of Drunken Eight Immortals that would be sold to the public in the future after a month of improvement.

Among the 20 tons, 15 tons were in the three – month improvement period, and the other five tons were in the improvement period of five months.

In the future, the winery would transport 100 tons of white wine every month. Among them, the number of white wine that needed to be improved for three months, five months, and a year was fixed. The remaining 80 tons would be sold on the market in a month.

Xia ruofei started to store the large wine jars into the spirit map space.

With a thought, the large wine jars in the warehouse disappeared into thin air one after another. If anyone saw this scene, they would be so shocked that their jaws would drop.

Although Xia ruofei did not summon the spirit map, there were huge wine jars in the original space of the spirit map.

And these large wine jars were all arranged according to Xia ruofei’s wishes.

The white wine jars with three to five months of improvement time were placed together with the one year wine jar on the empty space near the space membrane.

The one – month wine jars were neatly stacked on the other side of the space, almost close to the space membrane wall.

Although the original space was only eight mu in size, Xia ruofei had only developed and utilized a small part of the land with the spatial spirit pond as the center. A large amount of land on the periphery was empty, so there was no problem for the wine jars to be placed on the ground.

In the future, if Xia ruofei continued to develop the original space and there was not enough land, it would not be too late for him to consider stacking these wine jars together.

After collecting the last big wine jar, Xia ruofei still felt a little tired even though his spiritual power had increased greatly. After all, the wine in the wine jar was five hundred catties heavy. Including the weight of the wine jar itself, it was at least six to seven hundred catties. With so many of them, even if Xia ruofei’s spiritual power was strong, he still felt that it was a little too much.

He was still too weak! Xia ruofei said in his heart.

Fortunately, he already had two prescriptions that could continuously strengthen his physical fitness and mental power.
