3126 Chapter 1706 – no matter big or small (2)

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, then he smiled and said,””The Paradise corporation’s products do indeed make use of some means of cultivators. However, there are still essential differences between the Paradise company and the businesses of the cultivation forces in the secular world. First of all, when I founded the Paradise company, I had yet to come into contact with the cultivation world. To be precise, I was not a cultivator at that time. In addition, from the General Manager to the most basic employees of the Paradise company, all of them are ordinary people from the secular world. The company is not responsible for any information collection, cultivation Resources Collection, and other work. It is a completely normal secular company. ”

As Xia ruofei said this, Chen Xuan’s figure flashed across his mind. This early – Stage golden core cultivator was the young master of the number one sect in the cultivation world. He was a basic programmer in his company!

However, Xia ruofei quickly forgot about Chen Xuan’s special situation. Naturally, his company did not arrange for him to train.

Song Qiming nodded and said,””Ruofei, I basically understand the situation after hearing your explanation. To be honest, today is a completely different day for me!”

“Uncle song, like I said, it’s important to keep a calm heart!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”when you didn’t know about the existence of the cultivation world, when you used the ‘modest Sutra’ as an old man’s health – keeping technique, wasn’t everything the same as before? Your position and social status in the secular world will not affect your cultivation. Of course, if one was too busy with work and couldn’t even take out two to four hours a day to cultivate, then it might really have a certain impact. The path of cultivation is like rowing a boat against the current. If you don’t advance, you’ll fall behind. ”

“Will your cultivation level still regress?” Song Qiming asked curiously.

“Of course, all the martial artists in the secular world know that you have to practice every day, or your Kung Fu will be wasted. This is even more so for the cultivators. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”but I think that no matter how busy you are with work, you shouldn’t be so busy that you can’t even spare a little time, right?”

Song Qiming looked a little embarrassed and said,””I thought it was because I was busy with work or on business trips, so I didn’t practice it ... But now that I understand the situation, I’ll do it every day!”

No one would be unwilling to live a healthier and longer life, and song Qiming was no exception.

Moreover, after cultivating, one could master power that exceeded the limits of human beings.

After knowing the truth, song Qiming naturally did not treat cultivation as something that he did not care about.

“Besides, the benefits of cultivation are obvious,” song Qiming continued. In the past few months, I felt that my entire spirit was different. My mind was particularly clear, my energy was particularly abundant, my thoughts were particularly clear, and my work efficiency was much higher than before. I felt like I had suddenly returned to my youth. With the increase in work efficiency, I can have more time to cultivate. ”

For example, it was the same as reading and signing a batch of documents. Before song Qiming started cultivating, he might need two hours. Now, he only needed half an hour to clearly consider all aspects and make comments. That would save them an hour and a half.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”uncle song, you’re in such a good mood. It’s a good boost for your work!” It looks like the burden on your shoulders will probably increase ...”

“At my level, personal progress is no longer determined by work ability and political achievements.” Song Qiming smiled and waved his hand. I’m not very interested in this aspect now. I’ll be lucky if I get it, but if I don ‘t, it’s my fate! I’m just a farmer’s child from a small mountain village. I’m already quite satisfied with my current position, managing such a vast and rich land, and serving millions of people!”

Xia ruofei did not care much about politics, so he did not continue the conversation.

He thought for a while and said,”by the way, uncle song, before we find a way for aunt Fang to cultivate, I hope you can keep the matter of cultivation a secret from her.” It’s not that I don’t trust her, but I’m worried that it’ll be bad for her to know too much, especially the difference in the lifespan of cultivators and ordinary people ...”

“I understand!” Song Qiming nodded and said,”don’t worry! I’ve also learned about confidentiality regulations! I promise to keep my mouth shut to everyone!”

Xia ruofei was also amused. He waved his hand and said,””Uncle song, I don’t think so ... I asked you to keep it a secret for another reason, and that’s for your safety! After all, your cultivation is still relatively low and you don’t have any actual combat experience. If you encounter other cultivators, you’ll still be in great danger. ”

At this point, Xia ruofei’s expression turned serious. He said,””Uncle song, the lack of resources in the world of cultivation is beyond your imagination. It’s not uncommon for cultivators to fight over a little bit of cultivation resources. Although there were some rules in the world of cultivation, in general, the strong were respected. This was the true law of the jungle. Therefore, if you expose your cultivation and the spiritual crystals you have, you will be in danger!”

Xia ruofei took out a jade pendant from the spirit map space and handed it to song Qiming.””Uncle song, I’ve carved a small formation on this to conceal your cultivation. Ordinary Qi condensation cultivators won’t be able to see through it, and this is also a form of protection for you. As for golden core cultivators, they won’t notice a low – ranked Qi condensation cultivator like you. You must carry this jade pendant with you. ”

Song Qiming took the jade pendant solemnly and said,””I know, don’t worry! I know what’s important. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”besides not easily revealing your cultivation level to others, you must also pay attention during your cultivation process. Although I’ve said before that it’s right to not advance while sailing against the current, there’s one more thing you must remember. That’s to go too far.” Cultivation can not be rushed. Otherwise, if there is a problem, even I am not confident that I can save him! In the process of your cultivation, you must remain calm. In addition, if you sense that something is wrong, you must stop your cultivation immediately and inform me. You must not take any chances. ”

Song Qiming had no experience in cultivation and his identity was special. He was Song Wei’s father. Hence, Xia ruofei had to remind him of every detail. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Song Qiming had clearly accepted the fact that he was a cultivator and started to think from the perspective of a cultivator. He nodded and said seriously,””Alright, I’ll remember your advice! I’ll be careful. If there’s anything I don’t understand, I’ll ask you in time. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” You can call me at any time. ”

Xia ruofei then took a pen and paper from the desk and wrote down a string of numbers.”If you can’t get through to my phone, you can call this number. You’ll definitely find me.”

This was the number of the Peach Blossom Island’s satellite phone. This satellite phone was personally controlled by Li Yifu to ensure that song Qiming could contact Xia ruofei at any time.

Song Qiming carefully folded the paper with the phone number and put it into the safe. Then, he said,””Alright! You don’t have to worry too much about me. Didn’t you say that I have a good talent for cultivation? As long as I’m careful, there shouldn’t be any problems!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””You’re right. Normally, there shouldn’t be any problems. Uncle song, considering that you might be able to break through to refined Qi Level 4 very soon, I have to teach you the cultivation method for the next stage in advance ...”
