Chapter 3398: Taking the risk to enter_2

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei’s vital Qi formed a protective shield and easily dispersed the corrosive mist.

Seeing this, Xia ruofei felt relieved. It seemed like the yuan Qi protection was effective. This way, he would be much safer.

He continued to slide down carefully, and soon most of his body was immersed in the clouds. The clouds were repelled when they were about a meter away from the protective shield. There was no corrosive fog around him.

Xia ruofei also realized that the rope had indeed broken at the edge of the cloud. There was no rope further down. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Fortunately, the terrain here was much gentler than the top of the mountain. Xia ruofei reached out and grabbed the protruding corner of the rock. His entire body was easily pressed against the rock wall.

Xia ruofei stayed in the fog for a minute or two. After he was sure that the yuan Qi protective shield could block the corrosive fog, he pressed down hard and his clumsy – looking body rose into the air. He grabbed the rope accurately and climbed up quickly to the platform where the two of them had been temporarily staying.

Ling Qingxue asked anxiously,”ruofei, what’s the situation down there?” Are you alright?”

Even though Ling Qingxue had seen with her own eyes that Xia ruofei’s energy shield had repelled the highly corrosive weapons, she was not sure if some of the mist would enter the shield and corrode the spacesuit or even endanger Xia ruofei’s life.

Xia ruofei took off the airtight helmet from the EVA suit and smiled.””I’m fine! I’ve already verified that the yuan Qi barrier can effectively protect our safety! As for the situation down there … The visibility is very poor, and my spiritual power can’t penetrate the mist, so I’m not too sure …”

“It’s good that you’re fine!” Ling Qingxue said,”ruofei, I think it’s too dangerous down there. Why don’t we …”

Ling Qingxue did have the thought of giving up, but it was not for her own safety. It was because she was worried about Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei shook his head.”It’s not my style to give up halfway. Besides, since the yuan Qi Shield can repel the poisonous gas and we have the spacesuits that can provide us with the oxygen we need, we should be able to explore slowly!” The only thing we need to pay attention to is the poor visibility down there and the dangers in the fog!”

“I’m just worried about the unknown danger!” Ling Qingxue said.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”we’ve been here all this time. Which level of mission is easy?” Wealth comes from danger. Qingxue, we might only encounter such an opportunity once in our lives. If I don’t try my best, I won’t be satisfied! You don’t have to worry too much, 1 still have some cards up my sleeve. If we really encounter any danger, it shouldn’t be a problem to keep our lives!”

Although Xia ruofei said it casually, he knew the danger of this.

If they wanted to find the goldthread nether snake, they would have to explore the cloud area. It would be fine if they moved around the edge of the cloud area. With the protection of the yuan Qi barrier, if there was any real danger, he would be able to escape with Ling Qingxue quickly. However, once they entered the depths of the cloud and mist region, it would not be so easy to escape.

Once the yuan Qi protective shield was destroyed, the spacesuits wouldn’t be able to last long.

The only thing that Xia ruofei could rely on was the spirit map.

Along the way, the performance of the spirit painting made Xia ruofei feel at ease. However, he didn’t know if the painting could withstand the high – intensity corrosion. If the painting was damaged, it would undoubtedly be a disaster for him. Therefore, he wouldn’t use the spirit map painting unless he had no other choice.

Seeing that Xia ruofei had made up his mind, Ling Qingxue could only say helplessly,””Alright then! But I’m going down with you!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”even if you didn’t ask, I would have brought you along!” I don’t feel at ease leaving you up there alone! Qingxue, hurry up and change into your spacesuits. We’ll continue down!”

“Alright!”

Ling Qingxue took out the spacesuit that she had used on the way here from her storage ring. With Xia ruofei’s help, she quickly put it on.

Xia ruofei carefully tested the airtight seal of Ling Qingxue’s spacesuit as well as the condition of the oxygen passage. After making sure that there were no problems, he said,””Go! Let’s continue down!”

The two of them grabbed the rope and started to climb down. Xia ruofei opened up his Yuan Qi protective shield and covered both of them.

Very quickly, Xia ruofei’s legs had already disappeared into the clouds. He continued to descend until he reached the end of the rope. Xia ruofei jumped lightly and grabbed a bump on the rock beside him. Then he said,””Qingxue, come down!”

Although they were both in spacesuits, it was more convenient to communicate through the intercom system.

Xia ruofei also carefully maintained his Yuan Qi protective shield, especially on Ling Qingxue’s side. He left a lot of room for improvement.

Ling Qingxue quickly arrived at the end of the rope. She held the rope with one hand and observed the environment. Then, she nimbly jumped to Xia ruofei’s side and grabbed a bump on the cliff. Xia ruofei reached out and grabbed her spacesuit.

“Let’s go down slowly!” Xia ruofei said seriously,”you must be careful. Also, be careful of the protruding rocks on the cliff. If your spacesuit is torn, it will be very troublesome.”

“Understood!” Ling Qingxue said calmly.

The two of them carefully climbed down the rock wall. At first, the clouds were still a little thin, and they had just entered the cloudy area, so they could still vaguely see the platform above them. As they continued to descend, the clouds became thicker and thicker. Soon, the sky above them was a vast expanse of white. After leaving the yuan Qi barrier, their vision could only extend one or two meters at most.

Naturally, Xia ruofei was even more careful. While maintaining the protective shield, he also released his spiritual power to be on alert.

However, this cloud was very strange. His mental power would be devoured if it went a little deeper, and he could not detect the situation in the distance at all.

At this time, the two of them were surrounded by thick white fog, and they slowly descended in spacesuits.

Xia ruofei didn’t know how deep the fog was, but he knew that the only way to find the goldthread nether snake was to keep going down.

Moreover, this cliff was very large, and he might have to explore the fog for a long time before he had a chance to find the goldthread nether snake.

To be honest, with such a large area, and all covered in poisonous fog, six hours was not enough to explore little by little, even if there were no other dangers.

Xia ruofei felt that either there would be obvious clues, or they could only rely on their character.

He felt that the former was more likely. After all, the trial Pagoda was a test of a cultivator’s ability. If one had to rely on luck to pass, then there would be no meaning to the trial.

Hence, Xia ruofei had been carefully observing his surroundings, hoping to find some useful clues.

However, the cliff was almost the same. There was no vegetation at all, not even a blade of grass. There was nothing special about it.

Ling Qingxue followed Xia ruofei closely. Even though her cultivation was slightly lower, she was still able to handle the terrain with ease as long as they did not encounter any other dangers.

Before they knew it, the two of them had already climbed more than 300 meters down the cliff after entering the misty area.

There was still a thick white fog below, and it was so thick that it couldn’t be dispersed. It was impossible to tell how deep it was.

It could be said that the two of them had been climbing with difficulty for more than an hour without any gains, but one – fifth of the time had already been consumed.

Xia ruofei was still very calm. As he slowly climbed down, he observed his surroundings with all his attention.

After going down another ten meters, Xia ruofei suddenly stopped. Ling Qingxue stopped at the same time. They looked at each other through the airtight helmets on their spacesuits and revealed a look of surprise ….
