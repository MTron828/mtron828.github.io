Chapter 1285: Returning to the farmy_1

Translator: 549690339

Guo Hongjiang’s private jet was the Gulfstream 550. Although it was a generation older than MA Xiong’s Gulfstream 650, it was still a top – Class business jet.

Xia ruofei had been in the Gulfstream series commercial plane many times and was already immune to the luxurious and comfortable cabin.

The short two – hour flight was very stable. Xia ruofei even went to visit the cockpit on the way.

The Gulfstream series aircraft’s cockpit was very modern. It was equipped with a visual assistance system, a three – dimensional weather radar, and other advanced facilities. It was full of a sense of technology.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel tempted.

He also specifically asked the captain about the Gulfstream series business jet and found out that the price of the latest Gulfstream G650 was about 430 million Chinese dollars, while the old G550 was about 320 million Chinese dollars.

“When the farm in Australia starts to generate profits, I’ll fly a private jet for fun!” Xia ruofei said to himself.

With this thought in mind, Xia ruofei simply chatted with the two pilots about the Gulfstream plane in the cockpit. He only returned to his seat and fastened his seat belt when the plane entered the approach stage.

The plane landed smoothly.

Xia ruofei expressed her gratitude to the flight crew and left the tarmac with her small suitcase. She left the airport through the small terminal exclusive to private planes.

Ye Lingyun had already driven the car and was waiting at the entrance.

“Brother Xia, you’ve had a long journey!” Ye linyun said as he took the luggage.

“You little rascal ... Didn’t I tell you? In the future, we’ll just let the people below do things like picking us up. ” Xia ruofei said,”you’re the head of security and one of the higher – ups in the company. Don’t you think it’s beneath you to be my driver?”

“I don’t think so!” Ye Lingyun laughed. Besides, I’ve wanted to quit my job as the head of security for a long time!”

Xia ruofei glanced at ye Lingyun and said,””I know that you’ve put all your thoughts on the tea leaves, but before the personnel changes, you can’t give up on your job!”

“I know!” Ye linyun quickly replied. Brother Xia, don’t worry!”

Xia ruofei nodded. Ye Lingyun quickly opened the door of the Mercedes – Benz for Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei lowered his head and sat in the car.

Ye Lingyun jogged to the driver’s side, opened the door, and got in.

The car started to move slowly. Xia ruofei said,””Ling Yun, I’m sure everyone knows that the company will be moving its headquarters to the city soon. Since you’re willing to work in the tea industry, you should make some adjustments during the move!”

“Alright, I’ll follow your arrangements!” Ye linyun replied without hesitation.

“Before we move, we have to do a good job of security.” Xia ruofei said,”I have to remind everyone not to let their guard down.”

Tao Yuan farm produced a large number of Tao Yuan vegetables every day, which inevitably attracted the coveting of others. The factory price of Tao Yuan vegetables was mostly tens of Yuan per 500 grams. If thieves sneaked in and stole some or destroyed the vegetable fields, the loss would be huge.

Moreover, there were also precious pomfrets in the farm. These fish were very timid. If they were startled, it was likely that a large number of them would die, and the loss would be really heavy.

“Understood!” Ye linyun said,”don’t worry, brother Xia! The brothers all knew it in their hearts! With such a high salary, it would be a disgrace to the old army if he made any mistakes!”

Xia ruofei nodded.”No matter what the arrangements are,” he said,”you’ll still enjoy the company’s senior management standards.”

“Hai, I’m fine with it.” Ye Lingyun smiled and said,”I’ve never had to worry about food and drink with brother Xia. It doesn’t matter how much money I have ...”

“Bullshit!” Xia ruofei said,”don’t you want to save up some money to get married? Besides, the housing prices in San Shan are going crazy. You’re not young anymore, so you can buy a house as soon as you have the money!”

Ye Lingyun chuckled and pretended to be focused on driving. He didn’t respond.

However, an idea came to Xia ruofei’s mind. As the company expanded, there would be more and more employees, especially in the farm and pharmaceutical factories, which were labor – intensive industries. The number of employees in these two areas was the largest. Besides, the e – commerce Department also needed a lot of manpower. Xia ruofei felt that it was time to adjust the personnel structure. It would be best to follow the hierarchical system of other companies, with different levels corresponding to different wages.

In addition, the company’s senior executives still needed appropriate incentives. Otherwise, it would be fine for a year or two, but after a long time, the enthusiasm of those senior officials would also decline.

No matter how high his annual salary was, he was still a high – ranking employee.

However, Xia ruofei had never considered option incentives because he had no intention of financing or going public. Paradise Corporation could only be 100% in his hands. In fact, the current situation was the same. Except for Paradise Farm in Australia, which was in a partnership with Tang He, Xia ruofei had full shares in the other assets.

Not only did Xia ruofei not have any intention of financing or going public, but the company had not even taken a loan from the bank.

In other words, the debt rate was zero.

This was very rare in the business world. Most companies were in debt, and many real estate companies had a debt ratio of more than 50%.

Of course, this was mainly because Xia ruofei’s company did not need to expand. Besides, his core competitive power was in the spirit map space, so he did not need external help.
