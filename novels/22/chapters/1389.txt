Chapter 1390: An agreement (1)

Translator: 549690339

For Lin Qiao, happy times were always short.

After staying a night at Gulangyu, Xia ruofei and the rest would return to San Shan. She would return to school to continue her revision and prepare for her final exams.

However, the two days spent on Gulangyu had become a very beautiful memory in Lin Qiao’s heart.

The leisurely Gulangyu road, the romantic café, the cute Peppa Pig doll, and the Turkey ice cream shop owner who failed to “show off ...” Everything that happened in the past two days was engraved in Lin Qiao’s heart.

She stood at the school gate and looked at the cool Knight XV that was gradually blending into the traffic. The feelings she had for him for a long time were even more difficult to suppress.

After a long time, Lin Qiao couldn’t see Xia ruofei’s car anymore. She took a deep breath, and her eyes became more determined.

Lin Qiao pursed her lips and turned around to walk into the school.

......

Xia ruofei and the others arrived at the three mountains in two cars. It was already evening by the time they arrived.

Hence, Xia ruofei asked Zhao Yongjun and the others to return to Tao Yuan farm to rest for the night. The next day, he arranged for them to meet Ling Xiaotian at the headquarters of the Ling Ji food and beverage group.

Although Ling Xiaotian’s assets weren’t the best in the country, and the influence of the lingji F & B group wasn’t much in the eyes of Zhao Yongjun and the others, he was still Xia ruofei’s future father – in – Law, so they were very respectful to Ling Xiaotian when they met.

Ever since Ling Xiaotian found out about Zhao Yongjun and the others ‘identities through Xia ruofei, he had placed great importance on this meeting. He would not look down on them just because they were young.

The two sides had a strong desire to cooperate, so the atmosphere of the meeting was naturally very pleasant and warm.

Soon, everyone decided on the intention to cooperate.

Ling Xiaotian had officially decided to open a branch of Ling’s private kitchen in the capital city and integrate it into the club system that Xia ruofei and the others were about to build.

The club was in charge of the finance department, and lingji private kitchen had a dedicated finance staff who also recorded the accounts separately. Both parties would check their accounts once a month, and at the same time, settle their accounts once a month.

In order to promote in – depth cooperation between the two sides, everyone had initially agreed to exchange shares in the future. They would hold each other’s shares, and the main bodies would be the Beijing branch of Ling Ji private kitchen and the club.

What was interesting was that during the meeting, they had already decided on the name of the club.

It was called the Paradise clubhouse.

There were many reasons for this. For example, the Paradise Corporation was becoming more and more famous, so using this name was also beneficial to the club’s brand. The meaning behind the name “paradise” wasn’t bad either. The club was meant to be built into a paradise – like place, so that everyone could enjoy whatever they could think of.

Also, Zhao Yongjun and the others had new inspiration from their meeting with Ling Xiaotian.

That was to set up a special sales booth for the products of the Paradise Club.

Things like Taoyuan Da Hong Pao, Taoyuan tie Feng Dou, Taoyuan Cordyceps, Jade skin cream, seasonal Taoyuan fruits, top – grade one – headed abalone, top – grade truffles, and so on would all be exquisitely packaged and displayed here.

The club’s members could also purchase these popular items through the club.

Of course, those who could become members of the club basically didn’t lack money, so the price wouldn’t be cheaper than outside. Because of the exquisite packaging, it would even be more expensive than outside channels.

The only difference was that there was no need to rush, and everyone could buy whatever they wanted within their quota.

People with money and status would want special privileges.

Ordinary people had to line up, rush to buy, or wait at the computer on the dot. As long as they had a membership card and were within the quota, they could buy at any time and even deliver the goods to their doorstep.

The introduction of this system would definitely be very attractive.

Xia ruofei also agreed with Zhao Yongjun’s suggestion. His paradise Corporation had always been focused on high – end consumers, which had always been Xia ruofei’s main customer base.

When promoting paradise corporation’s products in the club, the customers were all carefully selected. 100% of them were the elites of society. Compared to the profit they could generate, Xia ruofei was more than happy to have such a brand influence.

Hence, not only did he raise both hands in agreement, but he also expressed on the spot that he would give the club a certain amount of resources in the distribution of resources. Moreover, the price would be a certain discount from the market price.

In any case, he also had shares in the club. If he gave up a certain amount of profit, a quarter of the profit would return to his hands. The loss of money was very small. Compared to the huge reputation that the Paradise company had gained, it was almost negligible.

It could be said that the meeting at the headquarters of the Ling Ji F & B group was very successful, and everyone successfully reached an agreement to cooperate.

Of course, Ling Xiaotian and the others did not sign any written agreement, not even a one – sided contract.

The main thing was that the club was only a concept at the moment. Not only had the location not been decided, but the company had not even been registered.

Moreover, with Xia ruofei around, their relationship was unbreakable. When they officially cooperated, it would naturally be written in black and white. At this stage, it was enough for everyone to reach an oral agreement. There was basically no going back on their words or any other variables.

The group had taken an important step forward in their expansion, and they had even built a bridgehead in the central city of the country, Beijing. Ling Xiaotian was also very happy. In the afternoon, he invited Zhao Yongjun and the others to a meal at Ling Ji private kitchen.

Although they had already tasted the delicious Chinese perch and Buddha Jumps Over the Wall a few days ago, when they saw the two dishes again today, everyone was still moving their chopsticks quickly and eating them quickly. Moreover, they were still full of praise.

After lunch, Xia ruofei bade farewell to Ling Xiaotian and his daughter and personally drove Zhao Yongjun and the others to the airport.

In front of the VIP security at the departure hall, Zhao Yongjun patted Xia ruofei’s shoulder and smiled.””RUO Fei, this trip was really worth it! Not only did they get to eat a rare delicacy, but their bodies and minds were also extremely relaxed. Most importantly, everyone had found an opportunity to cooperate. Now, they were all full of energy! Thank you!”

“Big brother Zhao is too polite!” Xia ruofei grinned.”I’m afraid I’m not entertaining enough! After all, when I went to the capital, you all treated me very well!”

“Excessive modesty is arrogance!” Zhao Yongjun laughed and said,”ruofei, we’ll do an investigation as soon as possible after we go back. We’ll aim to set a target before New Year’s Day and get the land before the Spring Festival!”

“Alright! After all, I can’t stay in the capital to keep an eye on you all for long. Besides, you guys are doing so well in Beijing, I can’t compare to you. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”just give me a call when you need funds. I can transfer the initial funds over anytime!”

“Alright!” Zhao Yongjun smiled and patted Xia ruofei’s shoulder.

Xia ruofei then looked at song Rui and said with a smile,””Xiao Rui, you have to work harder this time when you get back. Quickly take down Zhuo Yiyi!”

“A man should put his career first ...”

“Go! “If you’re not confident, then say so ...” Xia ruofei pouted and said,”we’ve helped you with everything we can. The rest is up to you!” Don’t tell me you’re giving up?”

“How is that possible!” Song Rui immediately said,”I’ll ask her out when I get back! The next time you come to Beijing, we will definitely be together!”

Speaking of this, song Rui asked,”I say ... When are you going to the capital?” Buying such a big house, but it’s so empty, I feel like it’s a waste ... Why don’t you just let me live in it ...”

“Get lost!” Xia ruofei laughed and scolded,”if you want to live in a big house, you’ll have to work hard to earn money to buy it! How can you keep thinking about reaping without sowing?”

Song Rui smiled and said,”we’re brothers.” What’s Yours Is Mine ...”

“According to your theory, then Zhuo Yiyi ...” Xia ruofei said unhurriedly.

“Don’t talk nonsense! You can’t take advantage of a friend’s wife!” Song Rui immediately said warily,”look at how respectful I am to my sisters – in – Law. No matter if it’s Ling Qingxue, Lu You, or Song Wei, Oh ... Or little sister Lin Qiao, I’ve never had any improper thoughts about them!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”a dog’s mouth can’t spit out ivory!” Other than Qingxue, what do the rest of them have to do with me? Don’t talk nonsense!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Song Rui chuckled and said,”that’s enough, ruofei. Don’t be so pretentious!” Everyone has a tacit understanding ...”

At this time, Zhao Yongjun called out from the front,””It’s almost time, let’s go through the security check!”

Xia ruofei finally let song Rui go and said loudly,””Brothers, I’ll stop here! I’ve prepared some tea leaves and iron – skinned fengdou for you. They’re all in the blue cardboard box that we just checked in. When you arrive in Beijing, remember to take them out and divide them. Everyone has a share!”

“Alright! Thanks, brother!” Zhao Yongjun laughed.

Hou Liang and the others also expressed their thanks. Then, the group walked toward the security checkpoint.

Xia ruofei stood outside the yellow line and said with a smile,””Brothers, have a safe journey! By the way, it doesn’t seem to be good to have a smooth wind on the plane, so I wish everyone a safe landing!”

Zhao Yongjun and the others laughed in a relaxed manner and waved at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei watched as everyone passed the security check and walked to the VIP lounge. Then, he turned around and left the airport, driving back to Paradise Farm.

Xia ruofei had been accompanying Zhao Yongjun and the others for the past few days and had almost no time for company matters. Now that they were on the plane, Xia ruofei had to hurry back to the farm ... To have a good rest!

Why aren’t you hurrying to settle your work? Please, eating and playing with him was also very tiring, okay? of course, he had to rest well to recover his vitality. Only then would he be in a better state to work!

However, Xia ruofei’s wish fell through. He had just returned to the farm. Before he could spend time with lightning, Blackie, and the rest, he received a call from Feng Jing, saying that she had work to report.

Feng Jing could handle most of the work on her own. Since she wanted to report to Xia ruofei, it must be something important. Xia ruofei could only ask her to wait in the office while he went over.

He grumbled as he put on his coat and walked towards the mixed – use complex.

Xia ruofei seriously suspected that Feng Rao had bribed the veteran on duty at the door. Otherwise, why would her call come the moment he stepped into the room?

If this went on, how could he be a Happy Hands – off shopkeeper?
