Chapter 368: The mysterious black Rock (1)

Vice – Principal li didn’t even want to say anything. He simply greeted professor Tian and Chen dongbai, then looked at Meng Zhou and Chen Song coldly before leaving the stadium.

Chen dongbai also walked down the stage and went straight to the side of the three mountains University. He said to Xia Cheng,””Xia Cheng, congratulations!”

Xia Cheng was so excited that she was almost speechless, but she could only express her gratitude.

He had always been a conservative person, and today’s twists and turns almost made his little heart unable to take it.

Of course, Sanshan University’s gardening club had gained a lot of face this time. As the president of the gardening club, he was even more honored and his face was red with excitement.

People from other universities also came over to congratulate Xia Cheng, and Xia Cheng expressed his gratitude.

Just as Xia Cheng was busy dealing with the crowd, Xia ruofei, Lu You, and Jiang Yue, who didn’t like to join in the fun, quietly squeezed out from the crowd.

Xia ruofei saw professor Tian the moment he came out.

“Xia, congratulations!” The old man said with a smile.

Xia ruofei pretended to be confused.”Professor Tian, this is the result of Sanshan University’s gardening club. Why are you congratulating me?”

“Don’t think I don’t know!”Professor Tian laughed. Youyou’s jade lion was found with my help! But not long after I took it back, I got sick and almost couldn’t come to the exhibition. I know very well what this jade lion looked like back then. It’s like a new person now. Don’t tell me that this has nothing to do with you!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”I just helped out a little. It’s not worth mentioning.”

“Brother Xia, this is not a small favor!” Jiang Yue said,”if it wasn’t for you, this jade lion might not have been able to live until now!” How could she win the Gold Award?”

Jiang Yue was now Xia ruofei’s die – hard fan.

At this moment, Xia ruofei saw a figure from the corner of his eye. He quickly said to professor Tian,””Professor Tian, I still have something to deal with, please excuse me ...”

Professor Tian turned around and laughed. “You’re going to collect the spoils! Hurry up and go ...”

Xia ruofei immediately strode in the direction of Agricultural University. Lu You and Jiang Yue looked at each other and tacitly followed.

The depressed Chen Song was about to take advantage of the chaos to escape when he heard a voice behind him,””Chen Song, where do you think you are going?”

Chen song’s expression was bitter. He stood still and slowly turned around. He saw Xia ruofei with his arms crossed in front of his chest, looking at him with a faint smile.

The two beauties, Lu You and Jiang Yue, were also standing on either side of Xia ruofei. They looked at Chen Song with a hint of amusement.

“Do I need to report to you where I’m going?” Chen Song said with a cold face.

A bright smile appeared on Xia ruofei’s face as he said,””There’s no need to report, but you seem to have forgotten something. We just made a bet this morning, and it’s only noon now. Your memory can’t be that bad, right?”

“I don’t think he has a bad memory,” Lu You chimed in.”He’s trying to go back on his word!”

“It seems like someone can’t afford to lose ...” Jiang Yue said.

At this time, everyone was leaving the venue, preparing to return to their respective booths to welcome the incoming visitors. However, Sanshan University was in the limelight today, and the two great beauties, Lu You and Jiang Yue, were very eye – catching in the Sanshan University Camp. Therefore, when everyone saw the two of them talking to Chen Song, they all stopped in their tracks to watch.

Xia ruofei did not explain the details of the bet, but Chen Song was very active in questioning the votes. He even went up to the stage to check the votes personally. In the end, he was chased off the stage by Vice Principal li. Thus, everyone knew him.

When the people from the three mountains University and Agricultural University were together, everyone naturally thought of a bet.

Chen Song felt a little embarrassed under so many people’s gazes. He coldly snorted and said, “Don’t slander me! I don’t want to go back on my word, you’re the ones who haven’t come yet. I still have a lot of things to do at the booth, so how could I have the time to wait for you here?”

Chen Song took out the chain from his pocket and threw it to Xia ruofei.”I admit defeat this time! This is the bet you won, take it ...”

To Chen Song, the stone hanging on the chain was just a little mysterious. He could vaguely feel that the stone was not simple, but he did not value it as much as Xia ruofei did. Thus, even if he lost, he would not feel much heartache.

Chen Song was more concerned that not only had he lost his face, but he had also lost the face of Agricultural University. He had even made an appointment with Vice President li. His future days would not be good.

At the thought of this, he hated Xia ruofei so much that he didn’t want to see his face again.

Xia ruofei reached out and took the chain easily. The string of strange black stones was hanging at the end of the chain.

He caught it with his left hand, so he didn’t even need to check to know that Chen Song didn’t switch it. This was because the spirit map scroll in his right palm immediately began to tremble with excitement, and a burning feeling came from his palm.

Xia ruofei put the chain and the stone into his pocket and smiled.””Thanks!”

Chen Song coldly snorted. With a gloomy face, he parted the crowd and left without saying a word.

Xia ruofei did not care. He had already gotten what he cared about the most. As for how much Chen Song hated him, it had nothing to do with him. Even if Chen Song hated him to the point of gritting his teeth, Xia ruofei would still live comfortably.

He, Lu You, and Jiang Yue returned to the side of the Sanshan University. The students of the Garden Club were surrounding professor Tian and talking.

Seeing Xia ruofei return, Xia Cheng and the others quickly came forward to express their gratitude.

Xia ruofei’s mind was completely focused on the black stone. There was only one thing in his mind, and that was to leave as soon as possible and return to the farm villa to study the stone.

Hence, Xia ruofei replied absent – mindedly, and then said,””Professor Tian, Lu You, Jiang Yue, since the matter here has been settled, I’ll be heading back first. The farm is currently under construction, and I have to keep an eye on the construction site ...” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Brother Xia, it’s almost time for lunch. Let’s eat before we go back!” Jiang Yue quickly said,”I heard that the food in Agricultural University’s canteen is pretty good. Let’s go and try it together!”

Xia ruofei was eager to return home. He smiled and said,””Next time! He really had something to do today. Isn’t this exhibition going to last for a few days? If I’m free tomorrow or the day after, I’ll come back to see you ...”

Jiang Yue was disappointed, but Xia ruofei had clearly expressed her desire to return. She could only obediently nod her head and said,””Alright! Then you must come when you’re free ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

When Lu You saw Jiang Yue’s reaction, she could not help but shake her head in her heart.

Professor Tian smiled and said,”little Xia, you can go back first if you have something to do.” I thank you on behalf of our school!”

“Hey! It’s really a small matter, you don’t have to be so polite. ” Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.”I’ll be leaving then! Goodbye!”

Xia ruofei waved at professor Tian and the other students and walked out of the stadium.

At this moment, professor Tian suddenly remembered something and shouted,””Oh right, Xiao Xia, wait a moment, I have something to tell you!”
