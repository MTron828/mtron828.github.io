Chapter 302: Peach blossom Orchard_1

Xia ruofei carried the bucket and started to water the saplings that the workers had dug out. He especially sprinkled more water on the roots. Lu Bo, who was watching from the side, also shook his head secretly. What he was worried about before was not that the seedlings would wither, but that the temperature was too low. It would not be easy to grow them in this season. Hence, Lu Bo felt that Xia ruofei’s actions were amateurish and that it was a futile attempt. However, since Xia ruofei was so insistent, he naturally did not say anything more. Instead, he walked to the side to help Xia ruofei contact a truck. Soon, the workers had prepared 260 saplings, and a white van that Lu Bo had called over also arrived at the nursery. Xia ruofei and the chauffeur had agreed on the transportation fee, which was 500 yuan. Lu Bo asked the workers to start loading the cars while Xia ruofei took out cash from his bag to pay for the saplings. The 260 saplings came to a total of 4680 Yuan. Lu Bo took the initiative to round it down and took 4600 Yuan from Xia ruofei. After loading the truck, Xia ruofei drove in front to lead the way while the truck driver followed behind. Along the way, Xia ruofei controlled the speed of the car. The pickup truck and the small truck entered Taoyuan farm one after another. When they passed the vegetable greenhouse, Xia ruofei stopped the car and shouted. Cao tieshu and the rest walked out of the shed quickly. Seeing Xia ruofei with a small truck, Cao tieshu couldn’t help but ask,””Yo! Sir, what did you buy this time?” “A lychee sapling!” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”old Cao, gather everyone and bring the tools to the orchard at the back of the mountain. We’ll plant the fruit trees today. Thank you for your hard work!” Hearing this, Cao tieshu turned pale with fright and said,”Boss, it’s too cold now. It’s not easy to grow lychee trees!” After he finished speaking, Cao tieshu couldn’t help but say in annoyance,”Aiya! It’s all my fault for not making things clear yesterday! Boss, I only asked you to set the tree seedlings yesterday. You can only plant the trees in the beginning of spring! This is really a waste of money ...” Xia ruofei said in a relaxed manner,”it’s okay, old Cao. This is a high – tech sapling that I’ve specially contacted. It has strong resistance to the cold. It will definitely survive!” “High – tech sapling!” Cao tieshu’s eyes lit up. Right now, the word “high – tech” had already become a synonym for magic in Cao tieshu’s mind. “High – tech vegetable seeds” had already completely conquered Cao tieshu. Hence, he believed Xia ruofei’s words without a doubt. He immediately turned around and said,””Guys! Stop what you’re doing and let’s go to the orchard at the back of the mountain to plant trees! Boss, bring the saplings back with you and your tools!” The workers took out their tools, such as shovels, pickaxes, and hoes. Xia ruofei asked them to place the tools on the back of the pickup truck. Some of the workers got into pickup trucks, while others got into small trucks. It wasn’t far anyway, so they just had to squeeze in. When he was building the farm, Xia ruofei had considered the future development problems. Hence, the roads in the farm were accessible in all directions. A cement road could lead directly to the orchard in the back of the mountain. The two cars drove directly to the hillside. As soon as Cao tieshu got off the car, he began to call the workers to unload the cars. With more than a dozen people working together, it didn’t take long for them to unload all the fruit tree seedlings. After Xia ruofei paid the transportation fee, he sent the small truck away. Cao tieshu had already started to assign tasks. Xia ruofei walked over to Cao tieshu and said,””Old Cao, plant lychee trees on the east side of the hill.” Cao tieshu made a rough estimation and said,”Boss, are these saplings not enough? This hillside was at least 8 mu! You only have around 200 saplings!” Xia ruofei smiled.”According to the standard planting pattern of 6 by 5 meters, there should be enough. There should be some surplus.” “It’s so wide! Wouldn’t that be a waste of land?” Cao tieshu said hesitantly. Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it’s fine!” These are high – tech saplings, and we’re taking the high – end route. Moreover, these saplings will definitely grow bigger than the average lychee tree, so we won’t feel sparse anymore!” Cao tieshu thought about it and felt that it made sense. In any case, the boss would definitely know more than him. Before the vegetable greenhouse officially started to produce vegetables, the vegetables that Xia ruofei provided to the two restaurants every day were not something that Cao tieshu, a farmer who had grown vegetables for most of his life, could grow. Therefore, Cao tieshu naturally would not question Xia ruofei’s decision. He immediately called the workers to start working. Xia ruofei couldn’t help much with planting the trees. It was almost noon and he couldn’t finish it before lunch, so he called pang Hao to order some food and wine from the county and have them delivered to the orchard at the back of the mountain. Then, Xia ruofei walked to the tree saplings. Without Cao tieshu and the others noticing, he secretly took two lychee tree saplings into the origin space. He wanted to plant one or two more in the origin space so that he could have lychees to eat at any time. Xia ruofei watched for a while and decided that he could not help much, so he decided to walk up the mountain. He came to the water tower and looked around to make sure no one was around. Then, he took out a porcelain bottle containing the petal solution from his space. The concentration of the petal solution in the bottle was quite high, containing almost one – third of the composition of a strange flower petal. Xia ruofei poured all the solution from the porcelain bottle into the water tower. The orchard had also been pre – buried with an irrigation system, and the water used was also from the water tower on the mountaintop. After all the fruit trees were planted, they would have to water them. Xia ruofei believed that with this bottle of petal solution, all the lychee trees would survive. He put the porcelain bottle back into the medium and strolled down the mountain. It was almost lunchtime when the workers had planted half of the saplings. Pang Hao sent the food he ordered from the county restaurant up the mountain, and everyone sat on the ground to have a simple lunch. Xia ruofei also had lunch with the workers. After eating, they rested for a while. Cao tieshu was worried that the saplings would not be good if they were dug out for too long. After a while, he stood up and asked everyone to continue working. Xia ruofei greeted Cao tieshu and drove down the mountain in his pickup truck. Back at the villa, Xia ruofei gave ye Lingyun and pang Hao some instructions. He told them to prioritize Cao tieshu’s safety if he needed anything. Then, Xia ruofei went upstairs to his room. After Xia ruofei locked the door and windows, he entered the spirit map space. He first took out a portion of the seeds that he had bought today according to Cao tieshu’s demands. Then, he divided them into different categories and stuck their labels on the sorting boxes. He poured in the diluted flower petal solution and began to soak them. After soaking all the seeds, Xia ruofei thought that he would be able to harvest the petals of the exotic flower again today. He walked towards the nameless plant.
