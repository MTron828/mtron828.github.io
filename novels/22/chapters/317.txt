The caller ID showed that it was a local landline number. Xia ruofei picked it up and said,””Hello, who is this?” Manager Lu’s voice came from the phone,””Xia, the chief wants to talk to you. Please wait a moment.” “Oh, okay!” Xia ruofei quickly said. His heart skipped a beat. Under normal circumstances, elder song would pass on his message through manager Lu. Could it be that something big had happened? Just as Xia ruofei’s mind was racing, elder song’s voice came from the phone.””Little Xia.” “Hello, chief!” Xia ruofei quickly greeted him. “Xia, do you have any good ideas on how to treat colon cancer?” Elder song sounded anxious.”Brother Fu’s results at the provincial Hospital are out. It’s late – Stage colon cancer ...” “Ah?” Xia ruofei was shocked.”How did this happen? Didn’t they say it was kidney stones? Did the hospital on Mount Wu Yi make a mistake?” Elder song sighed and said,”it’s not a misdiagnosis. Kidney stones are also common. It’s precisely because kidney stones can also cause abdominal pain that the doctors were misled. This time, if it weren’t for the rich experience of the experts from the provincial Hospital, they might not have discovered it.” “Chief, what did the specialist say?” Xia ruofei asked. “Brother Fu is getting on in years. His body might not be able to take the surgery or chemotherapy.” Elder song said in a low voice,”so...The specialist judged that the prognosis is not very good ...” “Xia, that’s why I wanted to ask you. Is there any Chinese medicine that can treat mid to late stage colon cancer?” elder song continued. Xia ruofei pondered for a while.”Chief, how about this? I’ll go and check on old Mr. Li first. Oh right ... Is he in the hospital or in guling?” “Brother Fu is already in the Gu Ling courtyard. He doesn’t know about his condition yet.” Elder song said,”thank you for your hard work, little Xia.” Elder song was not surprised that Xia ruofei did not give him an answer immediately. Although Xia ruofei had successfully cured his liver cancer, li Zhifu had been diagnosed with colon cancer. It was the same type of cancer, but the treatment was completely different. It would be abnormal if Xia ruofei did not hesitate to give him an answer! “You’re welcome, chief. I’ll come over now. ” Xia ruofei said. After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei did not get up immediately. Instead, he sat on the chair and pondered for a while. Then, he took out the spirit painting scroll and entered the medium. After making some preparations, Xia ruofei went downstairs and drove away from Taoyuan farm. After half an hour, Xia ruofei arrived at Gu Ling courtyard. Manager Lu came down personally to welcome Xia ruofei. “Xiao Xia, the chief is with old Mr. Li. Let’s go over directly!” Manager Lu said. “Alright,” he said. Xia ruofei nodded. Manager Lu led Xia ruofei into the building and said,””Xiao Xia, be more careful when you speak later. Old Mr. Li doesn’t know about his illness yet. The chief wants to hide it from him as much as possible.” “I understand, don’t worry!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. The relatives of many cancer patients would hide their condition from their patients because once the patients knew that they had a terminal illness, most of their conditions would deteriorate rapidly under great psychological pressure and fear, and they would soon die. Xia ruofei had suffered from Lou Gehrig’s disease before, so he was very clear about the mentality of a terminal patient. The two of them soon arrived at elder song’s room. Manager Lu knocked on the door lightly, opened it, and led Xia ruofei in. Elder song and Li Zhifu were sitting in the guest room. There was a chessboard in front of them, and they were playing Chinese Chess. After seeing Xia ruofei, li Zhifu laughed and said,”Little Xia is here!” “Hello, old Mr. Li, Hello, chief.” Xia ruofei walked over and said with a smile. Elder song smiled and nodded at Xia ruofei. He put down the chess piece in his hand and said,””Brother Fu, since Xiao Xia is here, let’s call it a draw!” “No, no, no! I’ve eaten your car, so you’ll definitely lose this game!” Li Zhifu said. “That might not be the case!” Elder song chuckled and said,”your two horses are dead. I have all the officials here, so you can’t kill me in a short time!” “Impossible! You’ve long lost the power to fight back!” Li Zhifu shouted. “Fine, fine, fine,” elder song smiled bitterly,”then you win this game! Brother Fu, let’s go make some tea ...” Xia ruofei and manager Lu both smiled. It was obvious that elder song enjoyed this kind of life. With his status, even song Zhengping’s children had to be respectful to him. Only li Zhifu, who had been his old friend for many years, could communicate with him freely. They sat around the coffee table. Li Zhifu took out some tea leaves and prepared to make tea. Elder song stopped him and said,””Brother Fu, let Xiao Lu make some tea!” Li Zhifu looked at elder song with a puzzled expression. Elder song chuckled.”Xia came over today and he can give you a check – up. Don’t look at Xia’s young age. He’s very accomplished in Chinese medicine. Some of my old problems were cured by Xia’s Chinese medicine.” Xia ruofei also said,”old Mr. Li, why don’t I take your pulse?” The elderly will have some minor problems with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, so it’s best to take care of them in time. ” Li Zhifu looked at elder song for a while, then looked into his eyes and asked,””Song, tell me the truth, did I find something wrong with my body?” “Kidney stones are a little troublesome, but it’s not a big problem. Now that medicine is developed, the stones can be removed outside the body ...” Elder song said with a normal expression. “I’m not talking about kidney stones!” Li Zhifu said,”little song, I didn’t hear you say anything for the past two days. Why did little Xia come over to check my body when the report came out today?” “Brother Fu, don’t think too much!” Elder song chuckled and said,”isn’t it because Xiao Xia came to see me today?” Xia ruofei also smiled.”Old Mr. Li, I’m just taking your pulse. Don’t think too much.” Li Zhifu was silent for a moment before sighing,”Alright then!” The old man had lived for more than 90 years, and his rich life experience made him keenly feel that his illness seemed to be very troublesome. However, since elder song chose to hide it out of goodwill, he might as well play dumb. Xia ruofei walked to li Zhifu’s side and sat down. He took his pulse carefully, looked at his tongue, and asked him some questions. He did the whole set of Chinese medicine treatment process methodically. “How is it?” Li Zhifu asked calmly. Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s not a big problem. I’ll give you some Chinese medicine later. You’ll be fine.” “It’s good that you’re fine!”Elder song quickly said. It’s good that you’re fine! Come, brother Fu, let’s have some tea ...” Li Zhifu smiled but didn’t say anything. Everyone tacitly stopped talking about this matter and sat around the coffee table, drinking tea and chatting. After a while, Xia ruofei excused himself and left elder song’s room. He had something to discuss with song Rui. He walked to the window in the corridor, took out a cigarette, and lit it. After taking three or four puffs, he saw manager Lu walking out of elder song’s room. “Xiao Xia, how’s the checkup?” manager Lu asked impatiently. Is there any way to treat it?”
