Chapter 754: Chapter 506 – hidden skill and fame (3)

Xia ruofei waved at the Veterans and left the private room.

The four unlucky ones had been taken away by the ambulance. Xia ruofei knew that the poison was not enough to kill them, but they would definitely suffer.

As for how Deputy – Mayor Xue would fly into a rage and how Hao Jue nightclub would deal with the aftermath, it was not Xia ruofei’s concern.

As long as Lin Qiao was fine, he didn’t care if Haojue nightclub was unlucky or not.

Besides, it was obvious that Xue Fei had a close relationship with this nightclub. Besides, this kind of place was full of filth. Xia ruofei would not feel guilty at all if he could punish them a little.

Xia ruofei went to the parking lot downstairs, opened the door, and sat in the driver’s seat.

However, he was not in a hurry to drive away. Instead, he sat in his seat, took out a cigarette, and lit it. Then, he rolled down the window and began to think while smoking.

There was no doubt that he had taught Xue Fei a lesson this time, and it could be said that he had vented his anger.

However, from Xue Fei’s point of view, the failure of Today’s Plan was undoubtedly an accident caused by “force majeure.”

In other words, not only would he not dispel his malice toward Lin Qiao, but he might even hate Lin Qiao more because of today ‘s’ unexpected disaster ‘.

It was impossible for Xia ruofei to be by Lin Qiao’s side and protect her all the time. Especially after the summer break, Lin Qiao would definitely go to college, and it was likely that she would go to college in another city. By then, Xia ruofei would be even more out of reach.

He didn’t doubt that with Xue Fei’s vindictive personality, it was possible that he would chase Lin Qiao to the city where her University was located to take revenge on her.

Therefore, he had to find a way to completely solve this hidden danger.

......

The most thorough method was naturally to make Xue Fei disappear from this world. However, Xia ruofei still had the law in his heart. He was not a bloodthirsty demon. Unless he had no other choice, or was severely threatened or violated his bottom line, he would not kill Xue Fei unless he had a way of seeking death. For example, Liang Haiming.

If he wanted to take Xue Fei’s life, he could have sent out ten or a hundred times the number of Hornets tonight. Xue Fei would have died on the spot without any suspense.

He could only think of other ways.

A thought flashed through Xia ruofei’s mind.”What if Xue Fei’s father, Xue zhenbang, had some problems with himself and suddenly fell from power? What if Xue Fei was also involved in the case and faced imprisonment?

Wasn’t this kind of foppish brat’s greatest reliance on his father’s authority? If his father was in prison, and even he himself was implicated, would he still be able to do anything?

Xia ruofei began to investigate Xue Zhengbang. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

If Xue zhenbang was really just a mediocre official who indulged his son and did not break any laws, Xia ruofei naturally could not do anything to him. However, if Xue zhenbang was a parasite of the country, a corrupt official, then he deserved to be out of luck.

However, investigating a Deputy Mayor was not that simple. At least, it could not be the same as investigating Xue Fei. In this kind of investigation, Lei Hu and the others could not play much of a role.

He still had to think of a complete plan! Xia ruofei was so deep in thought that he didn’t even realize that his cigarette was almost burnt to the end.

Just then, Xia ruofei’s phone on the console vibrated.

He snapped out of his thoughts and snuffed out the cigarette in the car’s ashtray. He then picked up his phone and glanced at it.

After seeing the caller ID, Xia ruofei’s eyes revealed a strange look. The person who called was not usually contacted! What could be the matter for him to call so late at night?

Xia ruofei quickly picked up the call.
