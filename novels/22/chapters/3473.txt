“You can continue to dote on your disciple!” Taoist master Qing Xuan said unhappily. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Daoist Qing Xuan, don’t be angry… When we meet this kid in the future, 1’11 ask him to return him to you!” Perfected Shan He laughed.

“Since he took it, I’ll just give it to him. I’m not going to argue with a junior over a few mind – calming wood bookshelves …” Taoist master Qing Xuan said. “Daoist Qing Xuan is magnanimous!” Immortal mountain river said with a smile,”then let him find more good things to show his respect to you in the future!”

Daoist priest Qing Xuan said unhappily,”! don’t dare to hope for that, as long as this kid doesn’t harm my baby anymore … 1 say… It’s time for him to leave!” There’s nothing left on the ninth floor, what’s he still doing here?”

For the first time, Qing Xuan Taoist priest was so eager for the trial – taker to leave as soon as possible, afraid that Xia ruofei would play some tricks again. On the ninth floor of the trial Pagoda.

After Xia ruofei kept everything, he looked around and confirmed that the wooden floor, which looked just as good, was really unmovable. He then nodded in satisfaction and walked towards the door.

Xia ruofei did not hesitate and walked through the door.

The familiar pulling force came. Xia ruofei once again filled his body with vital Qi and released his spiritual power. He was always on guard. After all, it was just his guess. In fact, he did not know where the light door led to.

After a brief moment of dizziness, Xia ruofei felt that he was standing on solid ground again.

Before he could observe his surroundings, he heard a familiar voice exclaiming in surprise,””RUO Fei! You’re out!”

Xia ruofei kept the purple Yuan crystal in his storage ring as well. Then, he placed the storage ring in the stone chamber in the mountain sea realm in the spirit map space.

At this moment, in the center of the room on the ninth floor of the trial Pagoda, a door made of light appeared.

Xia ruofei could guess that he had completed all the missions in the Tower of Trials and received all the rewards. He should be able to leave through this door of light. Perhaps he could leave the Tower of Trials directly.

He was still worried about Ling Qingxue’s injuries, so he naturally didn’t want to stay here any longer.

Just as Xia ruofei was about to leave, he suddenly had an idea. He looked at the antique – looking desk.

In addition to the three storage rings on the desk, there were also brushes, ink, paper, and inkstones. Although these things didn’t have any energy fluctuations, they shouldn’t be magic treasures. However, they were obviously old and the materials were quite exquisite.

Since he was just passing by, he couldn’t miss it. Xia ruofei walked over again and tried to take the Four Treasures of the Study.

He didn’t expect that after trying, these things would actually be successfully stored into the spirit map space, and the table was suddenly empty.

This set of tables and chairs looked pretty good! Even if it wasn’t a Dharma Treasure, it wasn’t something that the ordinary tables and chairs of the secular world could compare to.

Then, Xia ruofei’s gaze shifted to the four bookshelves …

A few seconds later, the entire room was emptied by Xia ruofei. The four walls were empty, and even the bookshelves had been moved into the spirit map space.

In the hidden space that was enshrouded in purple clouds, Daoist priest Qing Xuan was dumbfounded.

After a long while, he looked at immortal mountain river with wide eyes and said,””Your… Your disciple is really… Is he a Suan ni? Why did he want everything? He didn’t even let go of the empty bookshelves …”

Immortal mountain river was already overjoyed. He laughed and said,””Daoist Qing Xuan, it’s just a few bookshelves and a set of tables and chairs! It’s not a magic treasure! Even so many precious purple essence crystals have been given out, and you still care about this little thing? Don’t be so stingy!”

“Is this a matter of being stingy?” Daoist Qing Xuan asked. This kid’s table manners were too unsightly! It’s like a bandit crossing the border!”

Qing Xuan felt that he and Xia ruofei were fated to be enemies. When they were on the seventh level of the trial Pagoda, Xia ruofei’s little Dao companion had the blood of fairy Lingbo and took away the heavenly cloud Palace, leaving the entire seventh level of the trial Pagoda with only a bare square. On the ninth level of the Tower of Trials, Xia ruofei did not even let go of the empty bookshelves after receiving his reward. Now, the ninth level of the Tower of Trials had been swept clean.

Daoist priest Qing Xuan said unhappily,”this kid’s eyes are quite sharp!” Although those bookshelves, tables, and chairs aren’t magic treasures, they’re all made of precious calming wood. I’ve really suffered a great loss this time …” “Mind – calming wood?” Daoist master mountain river was also stunned for a moment,”Daoist brother Qing Xuan is really rich! You actually used the mind – calming wood to build an entire bookshelf?”

Mind – calming wood was also a very precious spiritual plant in the world of cultivation. Because of its extremely slow growth, the production of this wood was very small, especially large pieces of mind – calming wood were very rare. As the name implied, the soul – stabilizing wood could calm the mind and was very beneficial to the spirit body. It could also promote the growth of spiritual power, so although it was not a magic weapon, it was still very precious. Ordinary cultivators would be too excited to sleep if they could get some leftovers. They would often grind the mind – calming wood into powder and then light it in an incense burner. It was similar to the use of sandalwood. When one lit a little mind – calming incense during cultivation, one could enter a state of complete oblivion faster, and it was also very beneficial to one’s mental power.

Even for a powerful cultivator like the immortal mountain river, he would at most have some small things like small wood carvings, which could help him concentrate and calm down. It was very rare to see Daoist priest Qing Xuan use the mind – calming wood to build such a large bookshelf, table, and chair.

Daoist Qing Xuan said,”l explored a secret realm more than a thousand years ago and found three larger mind – calming wood. At that time, I built a few bookshelves and a set of tables and chairs. I originally kept them for my own use. Later, I was rotated to guard the trial Pagoda, so I simply put them on the ninth floor of the trial Pagoda. Occasionally, I would go there to cultivate …” Immortal mountain river tried to hold back his laughter and said,”this kid is a bit outrageous!” How dare you take Daoist Qing Xuan’s mind – calming wood bookshelf? This is outrageous!”

In fact, Daoist Qing Xuan did not expect that someone would actually be able to make it to the ninth level of the trial Pagoda. After all, this had never happened before, so he did not prepare anything in advance. The ninth level of the trial Pagoda was originally used as his study room. The bookshelves, tables, and chairs had not been cleaned, so they could not be stored in the storage space like in some of the previous rounds.

Qing Xuan Taoist priest was also careless. He didn’t expect Xia ruofei to be so impolite and take everything that could be stored on the ninth floor of the trial Pagoda.

He wanted to cry but had no tears …

Immortal mountain river then laughed,””But Daoist Qing Xuan, you can’t blame RUO Fei for this. After all, this child didn’t know that these things were yours! He didn’t know anything about the entire trial Pagoda. Since he had made it to the 9th level, he naturally thought that everything inside was his reward! This child was just too honest and didn’t know how to be polite … But he would definitely…

“Since he took it, I’ll just give it to him. I’m not going to argue with a junior over a few mind – calming wood bookshelves …” Taoist master Qing Xuan said.

“Daoist Qing Xuan is magnanimous!” Immortal mountain river said with a smile,”then let him find more good things to show his respect to you in the future!”

Daoist priest Qing Xuan said unhappily,”! don’t dare to hope for that, as long as this kid doesn’t harm my baby anymore … 1 say…. It’s time for him to leave!” There’s nothing left on the ninth floor, what’s he still doing here?”
