2422 Cultivator_In a short while, the carpet under Liu haojun was covered with blood.

Liu haojun’s eyes were wide open, and he twitched a few times in vain. His throat made a hissing sound, revealing a strong desire to live.

However, Liu Feng’s knife was a fatal wound. Even if bianque was reborn, he could not save Liu haojun. After a few seconds of struggle, Liu haojun’s consciousness sank into eternal darkness.

Liu Feng had been standing quietly in the room, his eyes filled with complicated emotions.

When Liu haojun stopped struggling, Liu Feng walked up to him and touched his neck. Then, he opened Liu haojun’s eyelids and confirmed that his pupils had begun to dilate.

Liu Feng let out a long sigh and gently closed Liu haojun’s eyes. Then, he jumped out of the balcony and quickly disappeared into the night.

Liu Feng did not know that all his actions were being monitored by Xia ruofei, who was on the roof of a residential building in the opposite District.

Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to investigate and witness the last few minutes of Liu haojun’s life.

Xia ruofei finally heaved a sigh of relief when he found out that Liu haojun was dead.

Ever since Liu haojun had pestered Wu Liqian in Changping County of Sanshan city, Xia ruofei and Liu haojun’s enmity had never stopped. This time, Liu haojun had hired an assassin to assassinate song Qiming. His motive had become an eternal mystery with his death. However, Xia ruofei speculated that it was likely to be a continuation of the enmity from that time.

Of course, Xia ruofei was not interested in knowing why Liu haojun wanted to kill song Qiming. Anyway, since he dared to do such a thing, he must be prepared to die an unnatural death. If he killed him directly, he would no longer be a threat.

Xia ruofei did not alert Liu Feng, who was running away quickly, nor did he plan to keep him.

Instead, he waited for Liu Feng to disappear into the night before leaving from the rooftop of the building.

It was already around nineo’ clock in the evening. Xia ruofei did not rush back to Chang ‘an city overnight. He would not be able to catch the last flight back to the capital Tonight, so he decided to stay in Pingan County for the night and fly back to the capital city the next morning.

Hence, Xia ruofei decided to tour this famous small town in the Northwest with great interest. Finally, he came to the small mountain beside the Pingan River and sat cross – legged near the pagoda.

At this time, there were no more tourists in the pagoda Park. Xia ruofei was in a secluded place, so no one would disturb him.

He didn’t plan to stay in a hotel.

Liu haojun’s death tonight would definitely become big news in this small county. When the news spread back to the capital, it would probably cause a huge shock in the circle of rich and powerful people.

Nowadays, except for those small, informal hotels, most hotels needed to register their identity. Xia ruofei didn’t want to appear frequently in places where things were going wrong with his Xia Tian identity. Otherwise, if someone really noticed him, he would have to give up his identity.

If “summer” appeared in Chang ‘an city, it might not be too eye – catching. After all, it was a thousand – year – old ancient capital and a famous tourist city.

However, if “Xia Tian” happened to leave a record of his stay in a hotel in Pingan County on the night of Liu haojun’s death, it would attract a lot of attention. In such a small county, there would not be many outsiders. A simple investigation would be enough to spot the problem.

Besides, there was another important reason why Xia ruofei came to the pagoda Park. He could feel that the spiritual Qi in this direction was denser than in many other places. He thought that he would not have time to cultivate today, so he decided to cultivate in the pagoda Park.

To a cultivator, it was nothing to cultivate the entire night without sleeping.

After Xia ruofei sat down cross – legged in the shadow of the tree, he took out a piece of essence crystal from the space. He skillfully operated the “great Dao formula” and began to absorb the pure spiritual Qi composition in the essence crystal to cultivate.

At the same time, the spiritual Qi around his body seemed to be attracted by a magnet, slowly gathering toward him.

Xia ruofei entered a state of cultivation. Time passed by slowly, and before he knew it, it was midnight.

At this time, in a small courtyard in the western suburbs of ping ‘an County, a short middle – aged man with a small mustache sat up from the bed and walked to the courtyard to wash his face with the water in the basin.

Just as he was about to return to his room and start cultivating, he suddenly felt a very strong fluctuation of spiritual energy in the East. He couldn’t help but let out an “eh”.

The middle – aged man with a small mustache looked at it attentively, and then muttered to himself,””It’s near the pagoda Park. Could it be ... A rare treasure has appeared?”

Chang ‘an city was a thousand – year – old ancient capital. The surrounding counties and cities also had a historical heritage, including Pingan County. Under the nourishment of the thousand – year – old Emperor aura, the spirit Qi in these areas was richer than that of other places on earth. At the same time, there had been records of rare treasures appearing in history. Therefore, the middle – aged man with the small beard was a little excited.

He couldn’t be bothered with his cultivation. His figure flashed and he flew in the direction of the pagoda Park.

Xia ruofei, who was immersed in his cultivation, did not notice that the middle – aged man with a small mustache was approaching him from a few kilometers away. He was still circulating the “great Dao technique” over and over again. He could feel his cultivation level increasing bit by bit, constantly breaking through the bottleneck.

The bearded middle – aged man was very fast, and he arrived at the pagoda Park in about ten minutes. He sensed it for a while, and his face was full of joy. He muttered to himself,””The spiritual energy is so dense! It must be a rare treasure!”

After saying this, the middle – aged man with a small mustache increased his speed and headed straight for the place where Xia ruofei was cultivating.

Although Xia ruofei was immersed in his cultivation, he was cautious by nature and would not cultivate in the open without any preparations.

In fact, he had set up a simple array around the area. Once someone barged in, it would activate the spiritual power imprint he had left behind. This way, even if he entered a state of enlightenment, he would still be able to wake up immediately. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

This kind of arrangement was actually just to prevent people from climbing mountains in the middle of the night, or any wild beasts from accidentally barging in. After all, this was not their home.

Xia ruofei did not consider the fact that he was a cultivator.

Up until now, other than Ling Qingxue and Song Wei, the only cultivators he had seen were Li Yifu and Manzila from Africa. Therefore, he guessed that due to the lack of spiritual energy, the cultivators on earth were almost extinct.

He didn’t expect to meet a real cultivator in a small county in the Northwest today.

As there were no cultivators on guard, Xia ruofei’s alarm array did not cover a large area. It only covered a radius of about ten meters.

Hence, when the bearded middle – aged man activated the formation and Xia ruofei woke up from his cultivation state, he was already a few meters away from Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei opened his eyes and saw a man with a small beard staring at him. He was stunned.

The middle – aged man with the goatee was also surprised.

He also did not expect to meet a cultivator in Pingan County. However, his eyes were quickly attracted by the piece of origin crystal in Xia ruofei’s hand.

Even though Xia ruofei was holding it in his hand, even though he had used it several times, the spiritual Qi within it was still so dense that it could not be dispersed.

The bearded man’s eyes revealed a hint of greed.

It was difficult to cultivate on earth. Although the middle – aged man with the small mustache had better conditions than the average cultivator, it was his first time seeing a treasure like origin crystals.

Of course, the bearded middle – aged man did not know that this treasure was called origin crystal. With his experience, he had not had the opportunity to come into contact with such a high – end cultivation resource.

He glanced at Xia ruofei.

Although Xia ruofei looked very young, one could never judge a cultivator’s age by their appearance. For example, this man with a small beard looked like a middle – aged man but he was actually over 60 years old.

The middle – aged man with a small mustache bowed slightly to Xia ruofei and said cautiously,””Fellow Daoist, I’m Liu chengfeng. May I know your name? Which celestial mountain and treasured land were they cultivating in? Why did you come to Pingan County?”
