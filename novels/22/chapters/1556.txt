Chapter 1557: The poor man who took over the situation (2)

Translator: 549690339

Although there was a small amount of Jade of the glass type near the cut that Xia ruofei had made, it was estimated to be worth two to three million Yuan at most if all of it was taken out. This was an even higher estimate.

The most terrifying thing was that only a small part of it had been opened, and the color of the Jade had already dropped to the freezing point. If he opened further in, there would probably only be stones left.

As for the direction of the other incision, who knew how much Jade could be cut out?

Fatty Luo felt the blood in his body turn cold.

In his daze, he shuddered and then shouted,””Master! Continue driving! I don’t believe that there’s only this little Jade left in such a big piece of material!”

The master of cutting the stones was already used to the performance of these stone gamblers. They were ecstatic when they gambled, and their bodies went limp when they gambled. Life was full of all kinds of things ...

“Boss, what’s the next solution?” he asked.

“Yes!” Fatty Luo said, enlightened. Let’s change direction! Start from the other incision. I don’t believe it ...”

At this moment, the veins on fatty Luo’s forehead were bulging, and he was gritting his teeth like a gambler who had lost so much that his eyes were red.

The stonecutter nodded his head calmly. After adjusting the angle of the raw stone, he continued to Polish it from the old cut.

Fatty Luo stared fixedly at the raw stone, as if he could produce Jade from it this way.

The window opened by the organizer gradually expanded, and the Jade inside was slowly revealed.

Just as everyone had predicted, the Jade on this side had reached the ice grade. The master polished it for a few minutes and pushed about ten centimeters in the direction of the new cut, but the quality of the Jade revealed was basically not reduced.

Moreover, the jadeite was hidden relatively shallow. Basically, after the stone Skin was worn off, the Jade flesh would be directly inside.

Some color had also returned to fatty Luo’s face, and he panted as he said,”I knew it ... It’s impossible for such a huge raw stone to have only a few pieces of rubbish Jade!”

However, before fatty Luo could finish his sentence, the surrounding jade stone merchants started to stir.

“It’s not working again ... I’ve ground so much, it’s all stone!”

“There’s an 80% chance that he’s going to lose ...”

“President Luo has suffered a huge loss this time ...” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Fatty Luo’s whole body trembled slightly. He couldn’t believe what he was seeing. The ice – Type jade that had originally brought him some hope suddenly stopped without any warning after extending more than ten centimeters. No matter how the stone – cutting master polished it, it was still a Cold Stone.

“I won ‘t! It can’t be ...”Fatty Luo muttered to himself.” How could this be?” I won’t ...”

The stonecutter continued to cut the stone with great diligence, and soon the outer layer of the whole raw stone was polished off.

The distribution of the jadeite inside the whole raw stone had a rough outline.

Coincidentally, only two of the incisions had a small amount of Jade in the direction of the other party’s extension line.

The area near the cut that Xia ruofei had pointed out was mostly glass – Type jade, while the other side was ice – Type jade.

Since there was no Jade in the middle, the master of cutting the stone ground it more. Now, the raw stone was roughly in the shape of a mute Bell. The big ones on both ends had a small amount of Jade, and the relatively fine one in the middle was pure stone.

Everyone present was an expert. They quickly estimated that the Jade from both heads would be worth at most six or seven million Yuan, and that was because there were more ice – Type jade.

Everyone looked at fatty Luo with pity in their eyes, some gloated, and the way they looked at Yu mingdong was more complicated.

Today, Yu mingdong was like God’s favorite. Good things kept happening.

Not only did he buy the top – grade Violet Jade, but he also bet more than 20 million on the raw stone that he had misjudged and was about to go bankrupt. Fatty Luo actually spent more than 50 million to buy it. In this way, Yu mingdong not only didn’t lose money, but he also made double the profit.

Even something that should have been bad luck could turn into a good thing by chance. This luck was simply heaven – defying.

Of course, there were also a lot of people who were scared. These were the people who had bid against fatty Luo just now. The guy who had bid 52.5 million was even sweating. Fortunately, fatty Luo had added 500000 in the end and he had reluctantly given up. Otherwise, he would have been the unlucky one today.

While Yu mingdong felt a wave of fear, he was also extremely grateful to Xia ruofei.

If Xia ruofei had not reminded him, he would have lost more than 10 million Yuan.

Although 10 million was not enough to hurt him, who would feel good about losing so much money?

Yu mingdong looked at Xia ruofei gratefully. He didn’t say anything. Yingluo had secretly reminded Xia ruofei just now. Everyone’s attention was on the material, and no one had noticed it. Naturally, he couldn’t say anything now. Otherwise, wouldn’t he be drawing hatred to Xia ruofei?

As for Xia ruofei’s great help, Yu mingdong naturally would not be ungrateful. This kind of thing had to be carried out in action and not just spoken.

In fact, Yu mingdong had already made up his mind.

Fatty Luo’s heart felt like it was bleeding, and his entire being was in a daze. He had lost more than forty million just like that! Yu mingdong’s loss of 18 million Yuan wouldn’t be a big deal, but fatty Luo’s loss of more than 40 million Yuan would really affect the capital chain.

The key was that if word got out that he had misjudged to such an extent, his reputation would be in tatters.

He looked at Yu mingdong with a pale face, but he couldn’t blame Yu mingdong for this. It was obvious that they were the ones who were rushing to buy it. Yu mingdong hadn’t even said anything, and they had already taken the initiative to bid.

Moreover, this transaction had been notarized and an official transfer agreement had been signed, so fatty Luo could only silently admit defeat.

Fatty Luo panted heavily and said as if he had gone crazy,”I don’t believe it! I don’t believe this is the result!”

He walked to the raw stone and said loudly,””That young man just now was able to cut out a top – grade violet from a piece of scrap. There are still so many pieces of this piece of material that haven’t been cut open! Who dares to say that there’s no Jade inside!”

After saying that, fatty Luo said to the stonecutter, “I’ll open it myself!”

The stone – cracking master also knew that it was best not to add fuel to the fire at this time. He only nodded slightly and then silently retreated.

Fatty Luo switched on the cutting sheet, turned on the power, and cut directly into the middle of the mute – Bell shaped material.

Everyone looked at fatty Luo with a hint of pity in their eyes, as if they were looking at a drowning man trying his best to grab onto a life – saving straw.

In fact, everyone knew very well that the material was no different from being fully cut to this extent. This was even different from Xia ruofei’s situation. Xia ruofei’s piece of material had not been touched after it was cut, but fatty Luo’s piece had been completely polished. It was obvious whether there was Jade in it.

In fact, fatty Luo was just unwilling to accept this reality in his heart.

He cut the material like crazy, but when he didn’t see any green, he changed positions.

Very quickly, except for the two pieces of jade that had basically been completely dug out, the rest had been cut off by fatty Luo bit by bit.

There was nothing. Even if fatty Luo crushed these stones into powder, there was no extra Jade.

Looking at the ground full of small pieces of stone and two extremely dazzling jadeite, fatty Luo finally couldn’t hold on any longer, and his legs went soft as he sat on the ground.

“It’s over ... It’s all over ...” Fatty Luo muttered.

Xia ruofei watched coldly from the side. This fatty Luo was actually a little utilitarian, but his mouth was a little mean. Seeing him like this, although he knew that he had asked for it, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel a little sympathetic.

Yu mingdong, who was beside Xia ruofei, also showed a look of pity. He hesitated for a moment and walked towards fatty Luo, who had a dazed look in his eyes.
