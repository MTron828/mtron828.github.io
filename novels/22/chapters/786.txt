Chapter 787: Second – Class hero (2)

After squad leader Luo’s body was cremated, his ashes were placed in the small hall of the lone wolf Special Forces.

This place was temporarily set up as a mourning hall to receive the condolences of the soldiers.

Squad leader old Luo was a well – deserved hero. He was a hero who fought against the enemy forces in an era of peace and wrote his loyalty with blood and life. However, for the sake of confidentiality, his deeds would not be publicized in the media, and people would not know that there was once a veteran who had given his precious life for the country and the Army.

Therefore, his ashes would not be publicly offered to the public.

In fact, there were many other nameless heroes like this.

“We can walk with our families in the night, live a comfortable life in the city, and be intimate with our loved ones under the moonlight. All these seemingly within reach but ordinary happiness is because of the silent sacrifice of countless soldiers.

The reason why our lives are so bright is because someone is blocking the darkness from us ...

Xia ruofei stood in the lone wolf commando unit’s honor room. He stopped in front of the Wall of Martyrs. There was a new photo of old Luo, the squad leader. On his left was his good brother Lin Hu. At this moment, Xia ruofei’s heart was filled with many emotions.

“Class monitor Xia, you’re here!” A voice came from behind Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei turned around and saw that it was Tian Feilong.

“Feilong! What’s the matter?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“Wolf King invites you!” Tian Feilong said,”he’s in the big conference room. You don’t need me to lead the way, right?”

“Of course!”

......

When Xia ruofei, who was dressed in military uniform, arrived at the big conference room, he realized that all the core members of the strike Force were present.

Guo Zhan saw Xia ruofei enter and smiled.””RUO Fei is here! Let’s find a place to sit!”

“Yes!”

Immediately, someone moved to the side and gave Xia ruofei a friendly smile.

The people in the meeting room were all the core members of the lone wolf assault team. Xia ruofei had been a core class monitor before he retired, so he was very familiar with them.

Xia ruofei sat down and whispered to the platoon leader who had given up his seat to him,””Thank you!”

“Everyone’s here, let’s start the meeting!” Guo Zhan said,”everyone is very familiar with comrade Xia ruofei, so I don’t need to introduce him. This time, we have encountered a serious problem while carrying out the 615 mission. Our misjudgment of the situation has led to casualties. I will report this to the higher – ups for an inspection and ask for punishment. Today’s meeting only has one topic ...”

At this point, Guo Zhan looked at Xia ruofei and continued,””Comrade Xia ruofei volunteered to join the battle and requested the unit to recall him to participate in mission 615. He played a decisive role in the follow – up process of the mission! He had used his actions to fulfill his promise of “returning to the battlefield if there was a battle!” Whether it’s me or all the members of lone wolf, we’re very grateful to Xia ruofei! I suggest that everyone give Xia ruofei a round of applause to thank him!”

The meeting room burst into a round of applause. Xia ruofei tidied his clothes and stood up to give everyone a standard military salute.

After the applause stopped, Guo Zhan continued,”In order to commend Xia ruofei’s outstanding performance, the higher – ups have decided to reward him. I will now read out the order from the southeast Military Region to reward him with second – Class merits!”

As soon as Guo Zhan’s voice fell, everyone in the conference room stood at attention.

Guo Zhan picked up a document and read aloud,”Southeast Military region’s government No. 12 order! Lone wolf assault team,”comrade Xia ruofei, a retired soldier from your division, was summoned back to carry out his mission ...”

Guo Zhan read out word by word the Meritorious Service Order personally signed and signed by the military chief, and the conference room was once again filled with thunderous applause.

Xia ruofei walked up the stage. Guo Zhan personally pinned the second – Class Meritorious Service Medal on the chest of Xia ruofei’s military uniform. He also presented the certificate of Meritorious Service and the good news of Meritorious Service to Xia ruofei. Now that Xia ruofei was all alone, he naturally had no place to mail the good news of Meritorious Service, so he gave it to him directly.

Although Xia ruofei had already retired, he would still be recorded in his personal file for his contributions and awards during his recall.

This second – Class merit did not have any material reward, but to Xia ruofei, it was a very precious honor.

Hence, Xia ruofei was rather excited. After receiving the medal and certificate, he stood on the stage and saluted to his comrades. He said emotionally,””Thank you for the organization’s recognition, my comrades! Although I have left lone wolf, my heart will always be with everyone. In the future, as long as the Army gives the order, I am willing to put on my clothes again and go to the battlefield! Still the same words, if there’s a battle call, I will return!”

“Alright!” His comrades gave Xia ruofei a warm round of applause.

“I hereby announce that comrade Xia ruofei has successfully completed his mission. His temporary recall has come to an end!” Guo Zhan said from the side.

……

At the entrance of the barracks, a camouflage cheetah off – Road vehicle was parked quietly.

Xia ruofei was quietly packing up in his room.

Xia ruofei had already changed back into his casual clothes. All the things that were given to him during the mission, including the woodland camouflage, the standard belt, the bulletproof vest, the bullet bag ... Were all placed neatly on the bed.

He carefully put the certificate and medal into his bag, zipped it up, and stood up. He looked around the familiar dormitory.

At this moment, Xia ruofei saw Guo Zhan standing at the door.

“Since you’re so familiar with it, you don’t need to send me off, right?” Xia ruofei pretended to be relaxed and smiled.

Guo Zhan walked in and casually placed his military hat on the table. He asked,”Talk?”

Xia ruofei was stunned.

“Don’t worry, I’m not trying to persuade you to stay,”said Guo Zhan with a smile. There’s something else I need to talk to you about. ”

“Please speak!” Xia ruofei grinned.

Guo Zhan took out a small stool from under the bed. After the two sat down, he said,””Ruofei, I’m here to talk to you about sister – in – Law,”

“You mean class monitor Luo’s lover?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Yes!” Guo Zhan nodded. After the coordination of various military and local departments, squad leader Luo’s grave had been confirmed. It was in the martyrs ‘Cemetery in the county where his hometown was. Tomorrow, sister – in – Law and Nan Nan will be bringing squad leader Luo’s ashes home. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and listened quietly.

“Squad leader Luo’s parents are old,” said Guo Zhan,”and now he’s still hiding his sacrifice from the old man. I’m afraid they can’t bear the blow.” Although squad leader Luo’s pension and consolation money can alleviate the urgent needs, but in the future, without squad leader’s salary and only some martyr’s pension, I’m afraid his family life will be even more difficult. ”

Guo Zhan paused for a moment before he continued,”generally speaking, the family members of a martyr like squad leader Luo who has made great contributions can solve their work problems. The local government has also promised to make proper arrangements.” However, sister – in – Law didn’t want to cause trouble for the organization. She said that if class monitor Luo was still alive, he wouldn’t agree to her doing this. ”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be moved. The word ‘military wife’ was a heavy word. The sacrifice and pain behind this word were also extremely great. A military wife like Lin Yue ‘e, who had a high level of awareness, was not the only one.

Guo Zhan continued,”I’ve tried to persuade her, saying that this is a normal treatment, but sister-in-law’s heart is set on it, and she doesn’t accept it..” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Xia ruofei said,”sister – in – Law is soft on the outside but strong on the inside. She has her own opinions. It’s hard to change her mind once she has decided on something.”

“Isn’t that so?” Guo Zhan smiled bitterly.”Ruofei, that’s why I’d like to ask you to persuade her. This time, you’ve personally avenged old Luo, so she might listen to you.”

“Captain, I don’t recommend sister – in – Law to accept the work arranged by the organization ...” Xia ruofei said after some thought.

Guo Zhan was stunned for a moment and said,”you brat!” I’m still counting on you to persuade sister – in – Law! Why are you going against me now?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Wolf King, let me finish!” “Sister-in-law’s education level is only high school, and she doesn’t have any special skills. Even if the organization arranges a job for her, it’ll at most be an idle position in a public institution. Moreover, the salary in Ganjiang province is generally low. Even if she has a permanent position, she won’t have much money a month. By then, her family will definitely be tight. ”

“Do you have a better idea?” Guo Zhan asked.

“Of course!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”don’t forget what I do for a living! My company is currently expanding rapidly, and I’m hiring people every once in a while. I think we should just let sister – in – Law work in my company. We can’t let her suffer any grievances in terms of salary and benefits!”
