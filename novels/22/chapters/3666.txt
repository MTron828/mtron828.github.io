Chapter 3667: The mixed courtyard of Jianghu (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei frowned but did not say anything.

He was only slightly surprised in his heart. Why was there someone else in this courtyard? this elder Liu who was carrying the birdcage could not possibly be a member of the water Yuan sect. Otherwise, the sect leader, Shen Hu, would not have such an attitude.

Furthermore, the water element sect was a subsidiary sect that didn’t even have a golden core cultivator. At most, they would only have one or two slots. The reason why Shen Hu was able to obtain two slots was probably because Chen Xuan had considered the fact that Lu You was in the water element sect.

Elder Liu looked at Xia ruofei from head to toe and smiled.””He should be an ordinary person from the secular world, right? Sect Master Shen, it’s a taboo to bring ordinary people into the first heaven sect without permission!”

Xia ruofei’s cultivation had already reached the intermediate stage of the Golden elixir realm, and his spiritual power had even reached the spiritualisation realm. On the other hand, elder Liu, who was carrying the birdcage, was only a little cultivator at the seventh level of the Qi refinement realm. How could he have felt the energy fluctuations from Xia ruofei’s body?

Xia ruofei looked thin and weak, with a harmless look. He was also wearing the casual clothes of the secular world. Naturally, this elder Liu had the first impression that Xia ruofei was an ordinary person.

What elder Liu said was actually what Lu You was most worried about. She could not help but look at Shen Hu anxiously.

In fact, she knew very well that although Shen Hu was a man of his word in the water element sect and had a high reputation, he was not a big deal in the first heaven society.

When they came to the first heaven society this time, even an ordinary elder didn’t come to welcome them. Instead, an elder’s direct disciple came.

Even the second – generation disciple had reached lianqi level 9, which was much more powerful than Shen Hu.

This elder’s direct disciple also did not place Shen Hu in his eyes. The entire process of receiving them was extremely reserved. After arranging for them to stay in this courtyard, he left as if he had completed his mission.

If this elder Liu really reported it to the first heaven society, Shen Hu wouldn’t be able to cover up for it.

Many disciples of the first heaven society were stationed in the reception area, mainly to serve the guests.

Lu You was a little flustered, but Shen Hu was very calm. This was because he knew that Xia ruofei was not an ordinary person from the secular world. He was a golden core expert and a distinguished guest invited by the first heaven society to attend the ceremony. He was also on good terms with the young sect leader, Chen Xuan.

“There’s no need for elder Liu to worry about this,”Shen Hu replied with a faint smile.

After he finished, Shen Hu said with a trace of respect,”Mr. Xia, this way please!”

Xia ruofei glanced at this elder Liu indifferently, then nodded slightly and followed Shen Hu to The West Wing.

Lu You, on the other hand, looked worried. She hesitated for a moment but did not open her mouth. She followed him.

Shen Hu invited Xia ruofei into the house and hurriedly started to make tea. His attitude was so warm that Lu You was a little confused.

Actually, Shen Hu was already very restrained. If he did not have to hide it from Lu You, his attitude towards Xia ruofei would definitely be much more respectful than it was now.

Xia ruofei looked around at the furnishings in the house and realized that it was indeed worse than the one he was staying in. It seemed that the courtyards used to entertain guests were also divided into different classes. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The apartment he was staying in should be the best in terms of location and grade.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but ask curiously,””Sect Master Shen, why are there other people living in this courtyard? What was that elder Liu doing just now?”

Shen Hu was busy boiling water as he said,”Mr. Xia, the heavenly sect has invited a lot of people to attend the ceremony. Except for some distinguished guests, such as the sect leaders of big sects or golden core experts, who can enjoy the treatment of having their own courtyard, the small sects like us have to live here, otherwise we won’t have enough courtyards!”

When Shen Hu said this, he scooped out some tea leaves from the wooden box and continued,”Elder Liu is an elder of the golden sword sect. The golden sword sect is similar to our water element sect. Their sect leader is also a Qi refinement level 9 cultivator. Other than the golden sword sect, there are also cultivators from the luoshen sect living in this courtyard, so the living conditions are slightly worse. The sect leader can have his own room. Lu You even shares a room with another female cultivator from the luoshen sect.”

The layout of this courtyard was similar to the one that Xia ruofei was staying in. There were two side rooms on the East and West side, and the master bedroom suite was in the middle.

Although Shen Hu had a single room, he was in the west room. Clearly, among the three sects, the water Yuan sect’s status was relatively lower.

Xia ruofei nodded slightly and said,”the conditions are indeed a little bad. Since the first heaven society has invited everyone to attend the ceremony, they should make the accommodation better!” At least everyone has a single room, so we won’t disturb each other!”

Lu You was shocked when she heard this and quickly said,””Ruofei, if you don’t understand, don’t talk nonsense. Be careful of getting into trouble!”

Shen Hu didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He wouldn’t have dared to say what Xia ruofei had said. However, with Xia ruofei’s relationship with Chen Xuan, it was fine for him to say it half – jokingly.

However, it wasn’t easy to reply to this. Shen Hu could only smile awkwardly and continue to make tea.

Lu You saw that Xia ruofei was smiling and did not take it seriously. Shen Hu did not say anything either. She could not help but say worriedly,””Teacher, Will Liu Ming really tell on us to the first heaven society? Shouldn’t you have made preparations earlier?”

Shen Hu smiled calmly and said, “It’s fine! Even if the first heaven society knows about it, they won’t blame us..”
