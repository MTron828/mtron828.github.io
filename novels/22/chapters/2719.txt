2720 Imparting cultivation technique (2)

“I understand ...” Li Yifu lowered his head and said.

He knew that what Xia ruofei said made sense. If Xia ruofei really abandoned him and ran for his life, with Xia ruofei’s loyal personality, he would probably live in guilt for the rest of his life. He would also be implanted with a huge mental demon and it would be difficult for him to improve his cultivation.

Therefore, Li Yifu secretly made up his mind that if he couldn’t hold on any longer, he would kill himself decisively so that his senior granduncle could escape without any distractions.

Naturally, Xia ruofei did not know that Li Yifu had already prepared for this. He softened his tone and said,””Foster husband, you don’t have to think too much. I still have many ways to save our lives. Even if this Luo Qingfeng can really break the Taixu xuanqing formation, we still have a great chance of escaping.”

“Yes! Senior granduncle!” Li Yifu lowered his head and said.

Li Yifu’s conviction to sacrifice his life for justice was extremely firm. He felt that Xia ruofei’s words were just to comfort him. Hence, although he agreed verbally, he did not change his mind.

In fact, Xia ruofei was not just comforting Li Yifu.

Even if Luo Qingfeng’s array skills were far beyond their expectations and he could break the Taixu xuanqing formation, Xia ruofei would still have a way to escape. He could only wait for his death. Xia ruofei’s biggest trump card was not the peach Garden Island or the Taixu xuanqing formation, but the spirit map space.

In the worst case scenario, Xia ruofei could have brought Li Yifu into the spirit map space. He was absolutely sure that an Aurous core stage cultivator would not be able to discover the secret of the spirit map space. It would not be a big problem to save their lives.

However, if that were to happen, he would have to reveal the secret of the spirit map space to Li Yifu. There was also the biggest problem. When Xia ruofei was in the space, the spirit map scroll could not be moved. To enter the space at any time, the spirit map scroll had to be within Xia ruofei’s range of thought. This meant that even if Xia ruofei brought Li Yifu into the space, they would still be Trapped in Paradise Island or even in the space for a long time. There was no chance to escape.

Hence, unless it was the last resort, Xia ruofei would not use this trump card.

Xia ruofei looked at Li Yifu and said,””Wait here for a moment, I have something to give you.”

“Yes, martial granduncle!”

Xia ruofei got up and walked to the bedroom next door. Then, he took out a small booklet that he had prepared earlier from the spirit map space. He then returned to the living room.

Xia ruofei handed the booklet to Li Yifu and said,””Take it. Cultivate well for the next two days. Although it’s just a last – minute preparation, every bit of improvement is good.”

Li Yifu was stunned for a moment and subconsciously looked at the cover of the small booklet in his hand. Then, his whole body trembled, and his eyes could no longer move away from the words “Guiyuan Scripture” written on the first page of the booklet.

Li Yifu’s cultivation technique was called the Guiyuan Scripture. Although it was only one word different from the Guiyuan true Scripture, the difference was like heaven and earth.

To put it bluntly, the origin returning Scripture was only a simplified version of the origin returning true Scripture. Compared to the origin returning true Scripture, there were many omissions and even mistakes. This was also an important reason why Li Yifu’s cultivation progress had been slow for the past few decades.

When Xia ruofei first met Li Yifu, he already knew about this. However, he did not pass on the Guiyuan Scripture to Li Yifu rashly. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Although the Guiyuan Scripture was only one of the many cultivation techniques stored in the Jade talisman of inheritance and its level was not particularly high, there was a saying in the world of cultivation that “techniques should not be passed on easily”. Through some experiences later on, Xia ruofei had a better understanding of Li Yifu and was more assured of his character.

He thought that the time was right, so he gave Li Yifu the Guiyuan Scripture that he had already copied.

Although some of the techniques he had obtained from the Jade talisman of inheritance were better than the Guiyuan Scripture, Li Yifu had been practicing the Guiyuan Scripture for decades. It was a technique that originated from the Guiyuan Scripture. Now that he was practicing the Guiyuan Scripture, it could be said that they were of the same lineage, and success came naturally when water flowed.

The most suitable one was the best.

Li Yifu’s hands couldn’t help but tremble slightly, and he couldn’t speak for a long time.

He had once fantasized that Xia ruofei would give him the Guiyuan Scripture, but he did not dare to have too much hope. After all, Xia ruofei had only mentioned that the sect had this technique, but he did not say whether it had been passed down. Moreover, even if it was passed down, why would Xia ruofei pass it to him?

Xia ruofei had always been the one who had been kind to him, giving him pointers on cultivation and giving him spiritual crystals ... But he had only given Xia ruofei a commercial plane. To him, money in the secular world was nothing. If he were to be measured in value, a Gulfstream G650 commercial plane was not even comparable to the scraps of spiritual crystals.

Li Yifu knelt in front of Xia ruofei and said in a trembling voice,””Senior granduncle, this disciple is fear.....I can’t accept a reward without doing anything. Senior granduncle has given this disciple such a precious cultivation technique, this disciple .....”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”get up first!”

Although Xia ruofei had accepted the fact that Li Yifu was his Grand – disciple, he still felt uncomfortable when an old man knelt in front of him.

“Yes!” Li Yifu didn’t dare to disobey and quickly stood up.

Xia ruofei said kindly,”adopted husband, this technique is not particularly outstanding among the inheritances of the sect. However, you’ve been practicing this technique all these years. It’s the most suitable for you.” To be honest, when I first met you at big brother Tang’s house, I had the idea of passing the cultivation technique to you, but I didn’t do so at that time. I hope you don’t blame me for not passing it to you later. ”

“I wouldn’t dare!” Li Yifu quickly replied. The disciple had not made any contributions, but the Grand uncle – Master had guided the disciple’s cultivation and even given him a spirit crystal, the most precious treasure for cultivation. The disciple was already terrified. Moreover, at that time, the senior granduncle didn’t know much about his disciples. The cultivation technique was so precious, so how could it be passed on to the wrong person? This disciple understands martial granduncle’s good intentions. ”

Xia ruofei had wanted to explain, but seeing that Li Yifu had thought it through so clearly, he could save his breath.

“It’s good that you understand,”he said gently. It shouldn’t be difficult for you to learn this cultivation technique. However, if there’s anything you don’t understand, you can come to me anytime. In short, the most taboo of cultivation is to shut yourself in. If you don’t understand, ask. You can’t rely on your own imagination. ”

Although Xia ruofei did not cultivate the Guiyuan Scripture, the techniques in the Jade talisman of inheritance were directly transferred to his mind. He also had a lot of cultivation experience, so there was no problem in guiding Li Yifu.

“Yes! Senior granduncle!” Li Yifu said respectfully.

Xia ruofei encouraged Li Yifu with a few more words and then let him find his own room to cultivate.

After Li Yifu left, Xia ruofei did not immediately rest. Instead, he left the building and flew towards the shelter on the island.

The Paradise Island was now empty, and he didn’t have to worry about being discovered, so he didn’t need to hide. He took the fastest path and quickly arrived at the shelter embedded in the mountain.

After passing through the heavy door, Xia ruofei headed straight for the storehouse.

After a while, he arrived at the huge warehouse.

About half of the entire shelter was a warehouse, while the other half was a living area.

The Liu family’s warehouse was full. They had prepared for the worst. Most of the food stored were necessities for survival such as food and drinking water. There was also a large cold storage warehouse full of meat and fish, all of which had been frozen solid in the low temperature below zero degrees.

Xia ruofei didn’t hesitate. He used his spiritual power to store the items in the warehouse into the spirit map space.

The mountain and sea realm in the spirit map space was extremely vast. Even if all the food in the sanctuary was stored inside, it would only take up a small portion of the space.

In the spirit map space, he didn’t have to worry about food going bad.

He casually set up an independent space in the mountain and sea realm, and moved all of the war preparations and storage materials in the sanctuary into it.

Xia ruofei was preparing for the worst. If he really needed to hide in the spirit map space, he might have to live in the space for a long time. He could only find a chance to escape when the time was right. So, it was safer to move these supplies into the space in advance. After all, they were just small amounts of spiritual power.

After emptying the warehouse, Xia ruofei returned to his luxurious suite in the project department building. He took out the crystals and cultivated for a while before going to bed to rest.
