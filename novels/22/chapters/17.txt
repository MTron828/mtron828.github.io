Chapter 18: Acute Heart Attack

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Hu Zi’s family lived in Changping County, a suburban county in Three Mountain City.

After Xia Ruofei left home, he went straight to the South station. There was a bus from Three Mountain City to Changping every half an hour. Xia Ruofei quickly bought the nearest ticket to Changping from the ticket counter. There was still about 20 minutes to go.

Xia Ruofei left the ticket counter and prepared to enter the bus station.

At this moment, there was a commotion at the door. Xia Ruofei turned around and saw an old man lying on the ground in the distance. Soon, there were people pointing at him. Some people even took out their phones to take photos, but no one went forward.

Xia Ruofei hurried over.

At this moment, there were already many onlookers around the old man. Xia Ruofei squeezed in forcefully, and someone shouted unhappily.

“What are you squeezing in for?”

Xia Ruofei had no time to argue with anyone. He saw an old man in his seventies or eighties with gray hair lying on the ground in pain.

He must have an acute condition! Xia Ruofei did not have time to think too much and hurriedly went forward to check on him.

At this moment, the onlookers persuaded.

“Hey! Don’t go over there, lad. Be careful not to get cheated of money!”

“That’s right! This old man looks very sick. Don’t ask for trouble!”

“Don’t go over there. I’ve already called 120!”

Xia Ruofei could not help but smile bitterly in his heart. There were indeed some strange sight in society, such as the famous Nanjing incident. There were also many similar cases, causing many people to not dare to touch the old man after he fell to the ground, afraid of getting into trouble.

However, Xia Ruofei had been trained by the army for many years. He could not watch an old man lay on the ground and do nothing. His conscience could not take it.

Therefore, he did not hesitate to take two steps forward and squat down in front of the old man. The old man’s eyes were tightly closed, and his face was filled with pain. His face was very pale, and his lips were already slightly purple.

Xia Ruofei gently extended a finger to check the old man’s breathing. It was already very weak, and he could clearly feel that the old man’s skin was cold.

Acute myocardial infarction!

The words came to Xia Ruofei’s mind. He had received first-aid training in the army. He was not a professional doctor, but he could make a rough judgment.

His first instinct was to quickly search the old man’s body. Under normal circumstances, a patient with heart problems would carry drugs like nitroglycerin, but Xia Ruofei did not find any.

Xia Ruofei thought that perhaps this old man did not have a history of heart disease. This time, it might be a completely acute condition, so it was naturally impossible for him to carry heart medicine.

He shouted without looking back.

“Can someone please call 120?”

“Young man, someone has already called 120. Get up quickly! Don’t get into trouble that you can’t get rid of!” someone reminded him.

When Xia Ruofei heard that someone had already called 120, he ignored that person’s reminder and directly changed the old man’s position to a lying position. He raised the old man’s feet slightly and placed his military satchel at his feet.

Then, he hurriedly checked the old man’s pulse and found that it was also very weak.

The old man’s condition was getting worse. Xia Ruofei knew that if this continued for a few minutes, the old man would die before the ambulance could arrive. He could not help but become anxious.

At this moment, Xia Ruofei’s gaze inadvertently landed on the military satchel under the old man’s feet. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

He quickly grabbed the satchel and quickly took out the bottle of grape juice. Then he forced open the old man’s mouth and poured the juice into his mouth.

After Xia Ruofei put away the bottle of potion, he nervously paid attention to the old man’s condition. Although it had already confirmed that the petals were effective against his ALS, this was still a diluted solution. Furthermore, Xia Ruofei was not sure if they could be effective against such a serious myocardial infarction.

Fortunately, the petal solution did not disappoint Xia Ruofei.

Not long after the old man drank it, his breathing began to steady and strong, and the color slowly returned to his face.

Seeing this, Xia Ruofei heaved a long sigh of relief.

The onlookers could also tell that after Xia Ruofei fed the old man a liquid of unknown composition, the old man’s condition was rapidly improving. They could not help but click their tongues in wonder.

The old man had yet to wake up, so Xia Ruofei did not dare to leave. He squatted at the side and paid attention to the old man’s condition.

After another five minutes or so, the old man’s breathing was completely steady and his face was back to normal.

He frowned slightly at first, then slowly opened his eyes.

“He’s awake, he’s awake!”

“The lad’s too good!”

“Yes! I thought the old man was dying just now!”

The onlookers chattered.

“What … what happened to me?” the old man asked weakly.

Xia Ruofei said.

“Old man, you just fainted. It could be an acute myocardial infarction. How do you feel now?”

“My chest is still a little tight… but it’s better…” the old man said.

Xia Ruofei nodded.

“That’s good! Lie on the ground and don’t move. Someone has already called 120. The ambulance will be here in a while. You should go to the hospital for a thorough examination and treatment!”

Xia Ruofei had only fed the old man two or three mouthfuls of diluted petal solution. He was doing this to prevent the old man from recovering too rapidly or even jumping around if the effect of the petal solution was too good. That would really be shocking.

Now it seemed that he had been right to be careful. He had saved the old man’s life without exposing his secrets.

Xia Ruofei stood up and said.

“Old man, since you’re fine, I still have to catch the bus, so I’ll leave first. You must go to the hospital for a thorough checkup later! Oh right, it’s best to inform your children immediately.”

With that, Xia Ruofei prepared to return to the station.

At this moment, the old man hugged Xia Ruofei’s leg.

The onlookers immediately discussed.

“See! He’s going to rip-off…”

“I told him not to go over just now!”

“The lad is still too young and inexperienced in society…”

Xia Ruofei was a little stunned. Could it be that he really met someone who was going to extort him? That old man didn’t look like that kind of person!

The old man seemed to have heard the discussion beside him. He quickly let go again and said.

“Young man, don’t… don’t misunderstand… I’m not trying to blackmail you… I know you saved my life just now. I just want you to leave me your contact details so I can thank you later!”

Xia Ruofei relaxed and smiled.

“Old man, there’s no need to thank me. I’m just acting out of kindness. It’s good that you’re fine. I’m really going to miss the bus. Goodbye!”

“Young man, then… then take my business card. You must contact me later!” The old man struggled to take out a business card from his pocket and handed it to Xia Ruofei with trembling hands.

Xia Ruofei thought for a moment, then smiled and nodded. He took the business card and put it in his pocket. Then he greeted the old man and quickly left the scene, walking into the waiting room of the South station.

As he entered, he heard the distant wail of an ambulance siren behind him.

Xia Ruofei knew that the ambulance had arrived. He was completely relieved.

After some time, it was almost time for the bus to depart. Xia Ruofei did not wait long before he boarded the bus heading to Changping County.
