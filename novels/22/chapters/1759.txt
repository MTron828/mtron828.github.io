Chapter 1760: Uninvited guests (3)

Du Qinghong had been participating in the exchange activities at the Huaxia mystical society. This time, Liu haofan had invited his good friend, Shen Zhongliang, the director of the Huaxia mystical society, over, so he followed along to take a look. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Because he had visited the land last time, this land was not suitable for any project at all. Of course, except for cemeteries, so when he heard that a company was going to develop a clubhouse project, he was a little curious.

Now that du Qinghong heard that Xia ruofei was the major shareholder of this project and that lingji F & B also had a share, he could not help but feel anxious.

Du Qinghong said absent – mindedly,””I’m here with my friend. ”

He then asked,”how did you get involved in this project?” This land isn’t suitable for the club project!”

Liu haofan’s eyes lit up when he saw that Ling Qingxue seemed to be close to du Qinghong. He smiled and asked,””Old man du, you know this lady?”

“En, the child of an old friend,” du Qinghong nodded.

Liu haofan laughed and said,”then we’re on the same side!” Old man du, please persuade this lady! It’s still not too late to withdraw the shares now. If we really hold on, no amount of money will be enough to make a loss!”

Then, Liu haofan raised his voice and said,””Brother Jun, CEO Xia, elder du is a senior in the field of metaphysics, and elder Shen is a director of the Huaxia mystical society. It was elder du and elder Shen who helped me look after this piece of land, and they both believed that it was a Yin gathering place. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have dared to lie with my eyes open!”

Xia ruofei immediately understood. Liu haofan was so fearless because he had a senior from the metaphysics world backing him up! Needless to say, old Shen and uncle du must have come after he had set up the yin formation.

However, Xia ruofei felt a little strange. Why did these two seniors from the field of metaphysics not realize that the Feng Shui of this land had completely changed since they got off the car?

In fact, Xia ruofei did not know. The reason was very simple. First of all, it was because of his preconceived notion. Last time, they had checked it very seriously and the conclusion was quite certain. Secondly, the atmosphere here was a little chaotic. Fengshui specialists were very sensitive to auras, but there were so many people here today, men and women, young and old. There were also construction machinery, various audio equipment, big screens, and so on. With so many auras mixed together, they did not notice the changes in the atmosphere.

In contrast, a few people from the metaphysics world who arrived earlier than them had carefully checked the Fengshui of this land.

They knew why Zhao Yongjun had invited them here. They were also very curious about the rumors that had been spreading around, so when they arrived, they started to check it very carefully. The Vice President of the metaphysics society had even used a spiritual compass.

At this moment, the formation had been reversed by Xia ruofei. The conclusion that these people from the metaphysics world came to was naturally the opposite of the conclusion that Shen Zhongliang and du Qinghong had come to that day.

Therefore, when they heard Liu haofan say that this was a haunted house, especially when du Qinghong and Shen Zhongliang had personally visited it, their expressions were as interesting as could be.

Xia ruofei looked at Liu haofan and then looked at du Qinghong. He smiled and said,””Uncle du, this piece of land can only be used to build yin residences? Do you want to take a closer look?”

Du Qinghong sighed in his heart. What was the use of looking at things that were already set in stone? No matter how good his personal relationship with Ling Xiaotian was, it was impossible for him to lie with his eyes open on such an issue! He was not the only Fengshui master in the world. If such a lie was exposed at any moment, wouldn’t he be smashing his own rice bowl?

What he didn’t know was that because Liu haofan announced that the conclusion of the netherworld mansion was determined by him and Shen Zhongliang, it almost caused him to lose his job.

Liu haofan egged them on,”old Shen, old du, since President Xia won’t give up, why don’t you guys suffer for a while longer?” I’ll also tell him what a Yin residence is!”
