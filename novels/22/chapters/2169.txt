2170 Leaving without saying goodbye (2)

“The sound of Helicopter Engines! Did you hear that?” Xia ruofei asked,”it must be a big ship or a military vessel! They saw the distress signal and sent a plane over to check! Hurry up and light the signal flare! Otherwise, the helicopter will turn back when it can’t find anything!”

In this vast sea, a helicopter’s range would definitely not be able to reach these waters. The helicopters that could appear were definitely carrier – based helicopters, either large cruise ships with complete facilities or warships.

Either way, the chances of Puyol and the others being rescued had greatly increased.

Puyol was also excited when he heard that. Although he still did not hear anything, he believed Xia ruofei’s words without a doubt. He quickly went into the tent to look for the remaining help signal flame.

Pjoll held the signal flare tightly in his hand and pulled with his right hand.

With a buzz, sparks flickered, followed by three “Bang Bang Bang” sounds, three signal flares flew into the air.

The light from the fire illuminated Puyol’s face, which was filled with anticipation. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Soon, the sound of the helicopter’s engine became louder and louder. This time, even Puyol and the three survivors could hear the sound of the engine. Obviously, the pilot of the helicopter had also seen the flames, so there was no need to search and move forward. Instead, he flew directly in this direction.

After a short while, the flashing anti – collision lights on the helicopter appeared in their field of vision, and the sound of the helicopter’s engine became louder and louder.

Puyol and the other three survivors couldn’t help but shout for help on the raft. The three survivors waved their hands frantically, while Puyol also kept waving the signal stick that was still spurting sparks.

Xia ruofei was the only one who sat on the simple deck quietly. He went through his disguise again and realized that all the items from the civilized society, such as compressed biscuits, mineral water, and instant noodles, were in his backpack. Other than the tent for John Junior, there was nothing from the modern civilization.

The tent was a very popular camping tent he had bought online. The sales of the Skycat agency alone were hundreds of tents every month, so it was impossible to find out his identity through the tent.

In other words, he could disappear at any time.

Of course, Xia ruofei was not in a hurry to dive into the water. Instead, he waited with Puyol and the rest.

After all, it was only the helicopter that was coming over, and it was hard to say if the pilot had noticed them. Xia ruofei would not leave until he was sure that Puyol and the others could be saved.

At this time, sunrise had just risen on the sea.

A red helicopter was getting closer and closer to the morning sun. Puyol and the others were so excited that they were in tears.

The helicopter flew a few rounds above the raft. Considering that the airflow caused by the propeller could easily overturn the raft, the helicopter did not lower its height too much.

Soon, the helicopter dropped a positioning buoy. The pilot reached out his hand and waved at Puyol and the others before leaving.

These buoys would constantly send location signals to guide ships over.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Puyol, don’t worry!” The rescue ships would arrive soon! You’re saved!”

“Yes ...” Puyol sobbed.”Thank you, great divine immortal ... Thank you ...”

David and the other survivors also hugged each other in excitement.

They had been stranded on the deserted island for so many years, and they had just experienced that nightmarish night not long ago. They had almost become the Python’s food. These people had truly survived a disaster! That kind of excitement was really difficult to express in words.

Xia ruofei said,”Puyol, after you’ve been rescued, you must know what you should say and what you shouldn’t say. You must know in your heart. If you don’t want to be a lab rat, don’t mention that mysterious island.”

“I understand ... I understand ...” Puyol immediately said.”Lord Divine immortal, but our identities can be investigated. We clearly encountered a sea disaster in the Atlantic Ocean. Now, we have appeared in the Indian Ocean. This is hard to explain ...”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”then tell me that you’ve drifted to a Nameless Island with the lifeboat. Tell me about the specific situation of the island, especially the situation in the pool. Also, you must not tell me that you ate the fruit. Otherwise, you might be cut into pieces and studied like a lab rat ...”

Puyol couldn’t help but shiver and quickly said,””I definitely won’t say anything ... I’m the only one who knows about this, so it’ll be fine as long as I don’t say anything. I’ll tell David and the others about the Python, but it’s best not to mention it. No one would believe me if I told them about the man – eating Python that was as thick as a bucket! They might even think that we’ve been on a deserted island for too long and have developed mental problems!”

Xia ruofei nodded in satisfaction and said,””It’s good that you understand! In short, it was less likely for problems to arise if he spoke less. As for the fact that you came out of the island a few years later and ended up in the Indian Ocean, it’s just that the island is a little more mysterious, and there’s no danger to you. ”

“Yes, yes, you’re absolutely right ...” Puyol quickly said.

Xia ruofei continued,”also, about my situation ...”

“I understand, I understand!” Puyol hurriedly said,”Lord Divine immortal, we won’t say anything. Don’t worry ...”

Xia ruofei smiled.”It doesn’t matter to me whether you guys talk or not. However, to save yourselves some trouble, you’d better pretend that I’m not here. Later, you and David will have to tell the same story.”

Puyol revealed a puzzled expression and said,””Lord Divine immortal, but when the rescue boat arrives, you ...”

Xia ruofei smiled.”You don’t have to worry about that. Just tell David and the others!”

He didn’t tell elder Puyol that he would leave in a while, and elder Puyol naturally didn’t expect someone to jump into the sea in such a vast area without even seeing the rescue team. Therefore, elder Puyol didn’t think much and quickly followed Xia ruofei’s instructions to find David and the other two survivors. They then started to speak in a low voice.

Xia ruofei, on the other hand, went to the tent on the simple deck and stuck his head out to take a look.

John Junior was sleeping soundly. The raft was probably floating on the sea like a cradle. The little guy had been sleeping most of the time and didn’t cry at all.

Xia ruofei reached out and touched John Junior’s little face. He smiled and said,””Little guy, we’ll be saying goodbye in a while ... I hope that we’ll really be able to see you again in the future if we’re fated ...”

Xia ruofei sat on the raft with Puyol and the rest. After waiting for almost an hour, a ship finally appeared on the sea level in the distance ...

Although they knew they were saved when they saw the helicopter, they still couldn’t help but jump up in excitement when they saw the rescue ship coming. They were waving the clothes they had just taken off as they jumped.

The ship stopped a few dozen meters away from the raft, then lowered a lifeboat and rowed towards the raft.

Puyol and the rest were standing on the raft and looking forward to it. No one noticed that Xia ruofei, who was at the bow of the boat, waved his hand lightly and the backpack disappeared into thin air. Then, he turned around at the bow of the boat and silently dived into the sea ...

As there were supplies and tents on the simple deck, no one on the lifeboat or the cruise ship saw Xia ruofei enter the water.

After Puyol waved his arms around for a while, he turned around excitedly and said,””Daoist immortal, we finally have to ... Eh? Daoist immortal! God ...”

When the survivors saw this, they also turned their heads and found that there was no one at the bow.

Puyol, David, and the other two exchanged looks and quickly recovered from their shock. Puyol looked at the approaching lifeboats and said in a low voice,””Listen up, the divine immortal definitely doesn’t want to see these rescue personnel. Remember what I told you just now. Never mention the divine immortal, or we won’t be able to explain it clearly and it will bring endless trouble ...”

Dave and the others nodded in agreement.

As for Xia ruofei’s safety, Puyol and the others, who had seen so many of his magical means, were not worried at all. However, when they saw Xia ruofei leave so quietly, they were more or less a little disappointed ...

Xia ruofei had not gone far. After he dived into the sea, he immediately summoned the spirit map and stuffed it into a gap under the raft’s simple deck.

This place was completely covered by wooden boards, and couldn’t be seen from the sea.

Xia ruofei entered the space and immediately released his spiritual power to observe the situation above the sea ...
