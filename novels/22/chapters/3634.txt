Chapter 1965: the great Tang!

Xia ruofei found Qi Huan very quickly.

When Qi Huan heard that Xia ruofei wanted Liang Qichao to be discharged from the hospital, he couldn’t help but be surprised. He couldn’t help but try to persuade her. After all, even though Liang Qichao’s injuries had improved, he was still far from being able to recuperate at home. It was obviously much safer to stay in the hospital, and he could deal with any sudden situations in time.

However, Xia ruofei’s attitude was very firm, so Qi Huan could not persuade him anymore.

After all, Xia ruofei was different from ordinary family members. Tang Yitian had personally arranged for him to be here and was responsible for the patient’s treatment. The clinic had only provided him with a venue. Since Xia ruofei had asked for the patient to be discharged, he certainly couldn’t stop him. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Thus, Qi Huan immediately ordered the clinic’s ambulance to get ready to transport the patient.

Xia ruofei took the opportunity to call Tang He, who was far away in the United States, and told him that Liang Qichao’s injury had stabilized, and that the surgical team from the United States did not need to stay in Sydney all the time. They could go home.

Elder Tang was very happy to hear this. He was very satisfied with Liang Qichao.

Elder Tang He had no children, so his billions of assets would be inherited by the younger generation of the Liang family in the future. As for who to give the majority to, elder Tang had been observing the younger generation, including Liang Qichao. In fact, Liang Qichao’s position in his heart was becoming more and more important. If Liang Qichao became disabled this time, he would definitely not be able to inherit elder Tang’s huge family business. If that really happened, elder Tang would feel very regretful.

Tang He even asked about the situation of Paradise Farm with concern, and Xia ruofei told him to relax. Of course, it was not convenient to tell him the inside story. Xia ruofei only said that he had found someone to coordinate it. At the moment, the kalini family had suspended all actions on Paradise Farm. The follow – up should be able to be coordinated.

Elder Tang was also very happy to hear this. He repeatedly said that he had not fulfilled his responsibility as a shareholder.

After Xia ruofei and Tang Fie chatted for a while, Qi Iluan’s ambulance was ready, so Xia ruofei told Tang He and hung up the phone.

He personally sent Liang Qichao to the ambulance, followed by Daphne. For safety’s sake, the armed guards from Paradise Farm also drove two cars, one in front to clear the way and the other following the ambulance.

Xia ruofei thanked Qi Huan as he watched Liang Qichao’s ambulance leave the clinic.

He found a secluded spot nearby and took out the black Phoenix flying ship. Then, he leaped onto it.

Xia ruofei maneuvered the flying boat into the air slowly. However, he did not fly directly in the direction of Peach Blossom Island. Instead, he found the ambulance and followed Jian Jia and Steve in the air at a steady pace. Galini had already told Grello to stop the operation for the time being, but Xia ruofei could not hope that the madman Grello would really carry it out. Liang Qichao’s body was so fragile now. If Grello really attacked again on the way, Liang Qichao would really die.

As the ambulance was traveling on the road, it was naturally much slower than the black Phoenix flying ship.

However, Xia ruofei was very patient. He slowed down and followed them slowly. In fact, he was sitting in the control room and reading a book leisurely. He just had to divert some of his attention to control the flying boat and monitor the ambulance.

Xia ruofei was only relieved when the ambulance drove through the gate of Paradise Farm.

The security on the farm was very tight. Even if greello was crazy enough to ignore his brother Steve, he would not be able to do so. Galini’s orders also meant that it was impossible to attack Paradise Farm, as the impact would be too bad. Even if the Galini family was powerful, it would be difficult to cover up the public’s opinions.

So, as long as he entered Paradise Farm, Liang Qichao would be safe.

With a thought from Xia ruofei, the black Phoenix flying ship nimbly streaked across the sky in an arc. Then, its speed suddenly increased as it flew in the direction of Paradise Farm..
