2310 A clear direction_Even though he could only see the outermost layer of the sea of consciousness, Xia ruofei still gasped and retracted his spiritual power without hesitation.

This was because he realized that song Qiming’s sea of consciousness was already in tatters. If he were to rashly probe it with his spiritual power, it was very likely to cause the sea of consciousness to collapse.

If that really happened, song Qiming would never wake up again.

Xia ruofei retracted his spiritual energy and sat in front of the bed with lingering fear. He was stunned for a long time before he recovered.

Although it was just a glimpse, Xia ruofei still got valuable information.

First of all, the reason why song Qiming was unconscious was definitely due to his soul.

Even for an ordinary person, their sea of consciousness would at most be small and fragile compared to a cultivator ‘s. It would not be stable, but it would not be as broken as Xia ruofei had sensed. This was clearly a sign of damage to the soul.

Secondly, Xia ruofei was glad to know that song Qiming was not brain dead!

Although his sea of consciousness was riddled with holes, it was not completely lifeless. On the contrary, Xia ruofei could vaguely feel a faint soul fluctuation in the depths of his sea of consciousness. If a person was already brain dead, his soul would dissipate in a very short period of time. His sea of consciousness would also become lifeless and become a dead land. This clearly did not match the situation that Xia ruofei had detected.

Xia ruofei sat and thought for a long time before he used his mind to contact Xia Qing in the space.””Xia Qing, put aside the work at hand for now and go to the spirit map world to make me a bowl of spirit nourishment soup!”

Xia Qing was busy expanding the herb garden in the space like a hardworking bee. After receiving Xia ruofei’s order, he immediately put down his work and got up to answer,””Yes! Master!”

As the master of the spirit map space, Xia ruofei had the highest authority. Xia Qing would definitely carry out his orders without hesitation.

Xia ruofei then said telepathically,””Also, make preparations for the emergency cultivation of the heart concentrating grass! I’m in urgent need of it in the outside world. If the pregnancy soup doesn’t work, I may need the heart concentrating grass at any time!”

Although Xia Qing felt that using precious spiritual crystals to cultivate the heart concentrating grass was not worth it, Xia ruofei’s words were an order. He didn’t even think and immediately said,””I understand! Master, I’ll prepare the spirit crystals and the array. You can come in and activate the array when you need it. ”

“Alright! You’ve worked hard. ” Xia ruofei said telepathically.

After the arrangements were made, Xia ruofei raised his hand and looked at his watch. It was already past nine in the evening. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

He decided to use the spirit nourishment soup the next day to see if it could heal song Qiming’s damaged soul. If the nurturing soup did not work, Xia ruofei would immediately choose to use the heart concentrating grass.

Although spiritual crystals were precious, he would not hesitate to pay any price as long as he could save song Qiming, given his relationship with Song Wei.

Besides, Xia ruofei had crystals with higher concentration of spiritual Qi. In comparison, he didn’t care how many spiritual crystals he used.

Xia ruofei packed his things and was ready to rest.

The intensive care unit was different from the general ward because there were strict requirements on visiting hours, which generally avoided the time when the doctor was making ward rounds. In addition, the patient’s family members could not stay in there for a long time. They had to leave after an hour at most, so there were no accompanying beds here.

Actually, with Xia ruofei’s current cultivation, he would not feel tired even if he stayed up all night. Or he could just sit down and cultivate. It was just a night. If he sat down and cultivated, it might pass in the blink of an eye.

However, Xia ruofei also knew that there were surveillance cameras in the ICU. He did not want to appear to be too independent, so he went to the on – call room and borrowed a military bed from the doctor on duty. He lay on the bed in the ICU and soon fell asleep ...

The next morning, Fang Liyun and Song Wei went to the intensive care unit to visit song Qiming before the doctors started their ward rounds. Although it was not visiting hours in the morning, song Qiming’s status was different. Moreover, the General Hospital had already made an exception for song Qiming’s treatment, so the two of them were allowed to enter the intensive care unit area.

As soon as they arrived at song Qiming’s ward, Fang Liyun and Song Wei saw Xia ruofei curled up on the small military bed and sleeping soundly. The mother and daughter could not help but feel touched.

Especially Song Wei, she knew that Xia ruofei had put in so much effort for his father, and it was mostly because of her. When she saw Xia ruofei curled up on the military bed, her heart trembled and her eyes were covered with a layer of tears.

Fang Liyun and Song Wei both lightened their footsteps in fear of waking Xia ruofei up.

However, Xia ruofei was extremely alert. He woke up immediately when Fang Liyun pushed the door open.

Xia ruofei rubbed his drowsy eyes and saw Fang Liyun and Song Wei in his hazy vision. He quickly got up from the military bed and said,””Auntie! Song Wei! You guys are here!”

“Ruofei, did we wake you up?” Fang Liyun said apologetically.

Xia ruofei chuckled and replied,”no, I wake up around this time every day!” I slept quite early last night, I had enough sleep!”

In fact, before Fang Liyun entered the room, she could see Xia ruofei sleeping soundly on the military bed through the glass wall. Of course, she did not think that Xia ruofei would wake up naturally when they entered the room.

Besides, the bed was a little short. Xia ruofei had been sleeping in a more awkward position. Fang Liyun was touched when she saw that. She had a better impression of Xia ruofei.

If Xia ruofei knew that his future mother-in-law’s impression of him had increased because of this small detail, he would definitely be overjoyed. Sleeping on this military bed was not a big deal to him.

Fang Liyun asked,”ruofei, why don’t you go back to sleep?” There are doctors on duty 24 hours a day at Qiming’s place. There’s no need for you to stay up all night to accompany him. ”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Aunty, I’m still worried about uncle song’s health. I’m afraid that if something happens at night, I won’t be able to take care of it in time without being in the hospital ... Besides, I’m so young. It’s not a big deal to take care of him for a night. It’s not like I didn’t sleep!”

Fang Liyun nodded and said,”ruofei, I won’t say any more words of thanks. It’s useless to say any more. We’re a family from now on!” No matter how much Qiming recovers, our family will owe you a huge favor!”

When Song Wei heard this, she subconsciously stole a glance at Xia ruofei and her face became slightly hot.

Naturally, Xia ruofei was elated. Of course, he did not show it. He only said humbly,””Auntie, don’t be so polite! In fact, when we left Beijing, elder song even called me and told me to save uncle song’s life at all costs. Besides, you and uncle song have been taking care of me so much, so it’s only right that I help uncle song now!”

“Chief, you’re so concerned about Qiming ...” Fang Liyun said, feeling touched.

“Isn’t it? Elder song even called me last night to ask about uncle song’s situation!” Xia ruofei said,”and he told me again and again that I have to find a way to wake uncle song up as soon as possible!”

Song Qiming was an important figure in the song family. Moreover, although he was only a distant relative of elder song, he was an orphan of the revolution. He had been sponsored by elder song since he went to school, so elder song’s feelings for him were no worse than his own sons.

In song Qiming’s situation, he should be considered lucky to have survived. However, with Xia ruofei around, elder song naturally hoped to see a better outcome. After all, song Qiming’s position at both the provincial and municipal levels was very important, especially when he was the head of the chairman of Sanshan. Such a position could not be vacant for a long time. If song Qiming did not wake up, it was likely that the organization would appoint someone else to take this position.

This was something elder song didn’t want to see.

Therefore, after getting to know about song Qiming’s situation through the phone last night, elder song had also asked Xia ruofei to try different ways to help song Qiming regain consciousness as soon as possible.

Xia ruofei chatted with Fang Liyun and Song Wei for a while and said,””Aunty Fang, Song Wei, you guys stay here and take a look at uncle song. I’m going to wash up!”

“Hurry up and go!” “I’ve asked Xiao Li to prepare breakfast. She’ll bring it to this floor later. Come back for breakfast after you’re done washing up!”

Xiao Li was the female staff member from the municipal Party Committee who was responsible for Fang Liyun’s safety.

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said,”then, Auntie, don’t take too long. You can wait outside later!”

Since Xiao Li had brought breakfast over, he would definitely have sent it to the main hall outside. The intensive care unit was not a wet market where one could enter and leave at will, let alone eat in there. That was absolutely not allowed.

Fang Liyun nodded with a smile.

Xia ruofei left the intensive care unit and walked to a blind spot of the surveillance cameras. He took out his bag from the interspace and found a sink outside the washroom. He washed up quickly and put his bag back into the interspace.

When he returned to the intensive care unit area, Fang Liyun and Song Wei had already come out. The female worker from the municipal Party Committee, Xiao Li, had also brought breakfast that he had just bought.

Xia ruofei and the other two sat on the long chairs in the lobby and finished their meal. This was how many family members of the patients outside the intensive care unit ate their meals. When they were in the hospital, they were not as particular about their meals.

After eating, Xia ruofei said,”aunty, I’m going out in the morning to prepare some medicinal herbs.” I’ll keep my phone on. If there’s any situation, please call me immediately. I’ll come back as fast as I can!”
