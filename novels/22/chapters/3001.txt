3002 Blue water flying boat (1)

When Xia ruofei and the rest arrived at the rooftop, there were already cultivators who were already there. When they saw Chen Xuan and the rest, they greeted them politely before leaving on their flying swords.

Xia ruofei looked at the sword lights that streaked across the sky. He felt that it was a spectacular sight.

Each sword light represented one or two cultivators. Many sects had brought Qi condensation disciples to increase their knowledge. These disciples couldn’t ride flying swords, so they naturally needed their elders to bring them along. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Of course, ordinary people would not be able to see this.

Xia ruofei also prepared to take out his flying sword. Although he knew that it was a bit shocking for a young man in his twenties to have the cultivation of the Golden core stage, he could not pretend to be a Qi refining stage cultivator and let Luo Qingfeng carry him.

Luo Qingfeng’s cultivation level was average among the Golden core cultivators, and it would consume a lot of energy to fly with someone. Even Xia ruofei would feel very uncomfortable.

Luo Qingfeng seemed to have sensed Xia ruofei’s intention and quickly stopped him with his eyes. At the same time, he immediately sent a voice transmission,””Master, there’s no need to take out the flying sword!”

Xia ruofei stopped what he was doing and looked at Luo Qingfeng suspiciously. He did not understand Luo Qingfeng’s intention.

At this moment, Chen Xuan flipped his hand and retrieved a Green Treasure.

Xia ruofei took a closer look and saw that Chen Xuan was dragging a small and exquisite Jade boat. It was entirely green and had exquisite patterns carved on it.

Just as Xia ruofei was still confused, Chen Xuan had already formed a few mysterious hand seals and slapped on the boat. The small Jade boat was like a balloon that had been blown up. It expanded in the wind and in a short while, it had grown to about ten meters long and was suspended quietly on the rooftop.

Mu Sheng laughed and said,”every time I see this blue water flying boat, I’m amazed. It’s simply a creation of heaven and earth!” Daoist Chen, I didn’t expect that sect leader Chen would give you such a precious treasure! He really thinks highly of you!”

Chen Xuan smiled.”This is just a temporary loan from my father. After all, with the Clearwater flying boat, it’ll be much more convenient for me to travel far.”

“I see!” Mu Sheng laughed and said,”I was wondering why sect leader Chen suddenly became so generous!”

Chen Xuan smiled but didn’t say anything. He had always been brought up in a strict family. The principle that a son shouldn’t criticize his father’s mistakes had been instilled in his mind since he was young. Although Mu Sheng was joking, Chen Xuan, as the son of the Tianyi sect’s sect master, Chen Nanfeng, naturally couldn’t respond to this.

Mu Sheng also knew Chen Xuan’s temper, so he didn’t take it to heart. Instead, he looked at the surprised Xia ruofei and said with a smile,””It seems that this is fellow Daoist Xia’s first time seeing a jadewater flying boat! This is the first time I’ve seen this treasure, and I was so shocked that my eyes almost popped out! This is one of the most famous treasures in the world of cultivation!”

Chen Xuan looked at Xia ruofei’s expression and knew that he did not know much about the Clearwater flying boat. He smiled and explained,””Brother Xia, sect leader mu is exaggerating. It’s not really a treasure. In fact, the jadewater flying boat is just a means of transportation. It’s just a novel one and there’s only one in the world of cultivation. That’s why the rumors are exaggerated.”

“It’s indeed very stunning!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”especially when it suddenly becomes big ...”

“Haha!” Chen Xuan laughed.”Actually, my father was lucky to have found this many years ago from an ancient cultivation ruin. We estimate that in the ancient cultivation world, this is just an ordinary means of transportation. It’s a pity that the inheritance has been cut off. No one in the current cultivation world is able to make it!”

After sighing for a while, Chen Xuan smiled and said,””Fellow Daoists, please board the boat!”

Mu Sheng laughed and said,”this is good!” It’s saved me a lot of energy!”

After that, Mu Sheng made a gesture and said,””Fellow Daoist Chen, you first!”

Chen Xuan smiled.”You’re the guests. I’m the host. Of course, you should go first!”

Mu Sheng didn’t hesitate and took the lead to board the Clearwater flying boat. Mu Hua and mu Jianfei, Xia ruofei, and Luo Qingfeng modestly declined. In the end, Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng had no choice but to board the flying boat first. Mu Hua, Chen Xuan, and the others also boarded the boat.

Xia ruofei observed for a while. The Bluewater flying boat looked like a small boat. However, after boarding it, he realized that there was a very spacious cabin under the Jade canopy.

Chen Xuan asked everyone to take their seats in the cabin.

After Xia ruofei sat down, he looked around and realized that even though there were eight people in the cabin, it did not feel crowded at all. It did not feel stuffy either. In addition, there were large porthole windows on both sides of the cabin, inlaid with transparent crystals. They could see the situation outside, but at the same time, there would be no airflow in.

Chen Xuan nodded at a disciple of the first heaven society he had brought with him.

The disciple immediately walked to a stage carved with complicated and mysterious patterns in the front of the cabin and took out three standard – cut spiritual crystals from his storage ring.

Xia ruofei could tell at a glance that the blue water flying boat was most likely driven by spiritual crystals.

That platform was clearly the main control formation for the Flying Ship.

It was normal to think about it. The jadewater flying boat was so big and could carry so many people. If they only used spiritual size, it would not be enough to drive it. Only spiritual crystals with higher purity could bear this important task.
