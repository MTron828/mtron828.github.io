Chapter 1659: A strange deviation (2)

“If you’re ready, I’ll bring it in!” “My food will be sent in half an hour later!” Said Wilkinson with a smile.

Under normal circumstances, two pilots would not eat at the same time. On one hand, someone had to monitor the flight status and maintain communication with the air traffic control on the ground, so they had to concentrate on their work. On the other hand, it was also to prevent extreme situations. If there was a problem with the food, at least they wouldn’t get food poisoning at the same time.

“Thank you, Mr. Wilkinson!” The flight attendant said with a smile.

“It’s no trouble at all!” Wilkins smiled as he picked up his plate and said,”when you guys send me my food, you can come back and take captain’s portion!”

“Understood!” The flight attendant said.

Wilkinson walked towards the cockpit with a plate of food. No one noticed that he took out a small paper bag from his pocket and quickly poured the powder inside into Johannson’s corn soup. He then stirred it a few times.

Wilkinson rang the doorbell at the door of the cockpit, and Johannson quickly turned on the door switch. Wilkinson walked into the cockpit and patted the male flight attendant on the shoulder.”Buddy, thank you for your hard work!”

After the flight attendant left the cockpit, Wilkinson locked the door from the inside and smiled.””Mr. Captain, your lunch is here!”

“Oh! I’m so grateful!” Johannson did not suspect that the co – Pilot had brought in the food when he returned to the cockpit. It was normal.

Johannson pulled out the small table in front of him and turned around to take the plate from Wilkinson.

Wilkinson sat back in the front passenger seat, put on his earphones, and asked,””Mr. Johannson, how’s the plane?”

“Everything is normal!” Johannson said.

“Alright, I’ll take over from now on!” “You can enjoy a delicious lunch now!” Said Wilkinson with a smile.

“OK!”Johannson said with a smile. He picked up his fork and started to enjoy the food. Of course, he would put down his fork and knife from time to time to drink his favorite corn soup.

Time slowly passed by in peace.

In the kitchen of the front cabin, a beautiful blonde flight attendant looked at the time and smiled at her companion.””It’s been half an hour. I’m going to deliver food to the handsome man, Wilkinson!”

“I wish you good luck!” Her companion chuckled.

The blonde flight attendant blinked at her companion and said,””Thank you!”

Then, she walked to the cockpit with a plate of food.

At the door of the cockpit, the blonde flight attendant tidied up her hair with one hand, then showed the most charming smile she had ever been trained to. She pressed the doorbell of the cockpit, and then looked up slightly, her charming blue eyes looking at the surveillance camera above the door.

There was no sound in the cockpit, and the smile on the blonde flight attendant’s face was almost frozen. She felt that something was wrong and pressed the doorbell a few more times, but there was no response from the cockpit.

“What happened?”The blonde flight attendant muttered to herself.

She picked up the communication device at the door and tried to talk to the cockpit, but no one picked up.

The blonde flight attendant looked even more worried.

Usually, such a situation would only happen when the pilot’s cabin was extremely busy and had no time to care about other things.

However, the plane was currently cruising at a high altitude, and the flight had been relatively stable from beginning to end. There wasn’t even a small bump. What could the two pilots in the cockpit be busy with?

The blonde flight attendant didn’t dare to delay. She quickly returned to the kitchen and put down the plates. Then, she found the chief flight attendant Guli and reported this strange situation to her.

Guli was also confused. She tried to use her communication device to contact the cockpit, but there was no response.

At this moment, another flight attendant exclaimed in a low voice,””Purser, look!”

Guli turned her head and saw that the LCD screen showed that the plane was slowly deviating from the scheduled route, and the altitude was also slowly decreasing.

There were many LCD screens on the Airbus A350, allowing passengers to see the plane’s current position, altitude, and a diagram of the virtual route. Even the real – time image of the plane’s exterior captured by the tail camera could be seen by everyone.

As such, the screen would immediately display the moment the plane started to deviate.

However, Guli wasn’t too surprised. During the actual flight, the plane might adjust the flight route and altitude level under The Command of the Air traffic control, or after taking the initiative to apply for approval due to the weather, airflow, and other factors. This was a very normal phenomenon.

Of course, combined with the fact that she couldn’t contact the cockpit, Guli couldn’t help but feel a little uneasy.

As the chief flight attendant of this flight, Guli didn’t panic in front of her subordinates and first – Class passengers. She decided to observe for a while longer.

However, the result of waiting made Guli feel even more uneasy. The qinhuang plane was no longer just deviating at a small angle. The plane’s course was now in the opposite direction of the planned route. Moreover, its altitude was constantly decreasing. Although the rate of descent was not very high, this phenomenon was too abnormal.

Guli knew that she couldn’t wait any longer. She decided to wake up the second captain, Brook.

She picked up the cabin’s communication device and connected to the pilot’s lounge.

Brook, who had just fallen asleep, picked up the call in a daze.””Hello?”

“Captain Brook, I’m the chief flight attendant, Guli.” Guli’s expression was grave as she said,”the plane seems to have some problems. I would like to invite you down to take a look!”

Brook didn’t dare to delay and quickly said,””I’ll come down immediately!”

Soon, the cabin door behind the cockpit was opened. Captain Brook was buttoning up his uniform as he asked,””What happened? The flight seems to be very stable!”

Because the first – Class passengers were not far away, in order to prevent the passengers from panicking, Guli slightly lowered her voice and said,”Captain Brook, we seem to have lost contact with the cockpit ...”

“Lost contact?” Brook raised his eyebrows in surprise.”How is that possible?”

“We tried to ring the doorbell and use the cabin’s communication facilities, but we couldn’t contact the cockpit!” Guli said seriously,”what’s worse is that the plane has deviated from the scheduled course and has been dropping in altitude!”

Brook’s expression changed slightly when he heard this. He quickly walked to the LCD screen and took a look. His heart couldn’t help but skip a beat. The plane had already deviated for dozens of nautical miles, and the altitude had dropped to about 30000 feet, and it was still falling.

Brook knew very well that their normal cruising altitude was 36000 feet. Even if it was adjusted due to the weather or airflow, they would not have dropped so much.

Captain Brook personally went to the door of the cockpit and rang the doorbell, but there was no response.

He had already realized that there might be a problem with the cockpit, but there was still a glimmer of hope in his heart. That was, the communication problem had caused the cockpit to not hear the doorbell or the call ringtone.

However, there was no explanation for the deviation and the lower height ...

Brook didn’t dare to think of the worst possibility. He took a deep breath and began to knock on the cockpit door. If it was a communication problem, the pilot in the cockpit would have reacted when he heard the knock. This was the last hope that Brook was trying.

However, there was still a dead silence, as if the two people in the cockpit had fallen asleep.

Captain Brook’s expression changed drastically as he quickly analyzed the current situation.”Now that the plane was controllable, the first possibility that could be ruled out was that both pilots had lost their abilities at the same time.

Even if the pilot had lost consciousness, under normal circumstances, the aircraft’s autopilot would continue to fly according to the route and altitude they had input in advance. At most, it would not respond to the adjustment instructions of the air traffic control, but it would never cause such a large magnitude of deviation and drop in altitude.

It was obvious that this was man – made! Only by manually changing the autopilot’s parameters would the plane have such a large deviation.

If it was caused by a mechanical failure, the entire process would not have been so smooth.

What was going on? The two Air Accidents of Malaysia Airlines and wings of Germany quickly flashed in Captain Brook’s mind. The air accident of Malaysia Airlines ‘Flight 370 had not been finalized yet, while the air accident of wings of Germany had been confirmed to be the co-pilot’s suicide by deliberately controlling the plane to crash into the ground ...

Brook’s forehead was suddenly covered in sweat, and his face became very pale.
