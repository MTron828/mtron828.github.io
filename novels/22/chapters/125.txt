Xia ruofei moved his body slightly and felt the hand – made leather seat. Then, he fastened his seat belt, shifted gears, and stepped on the accelerator ... With a surge of power output, the Knight XV that weighed more than six tons suddenly shot out. The 6.8 – liter V10 engine drove such a heavy body without any sense of delay. Xia ruofei turned the steering wheel and realized that the car was not as cumbersome as he had imagined. It was very agile. In the Army, Xia ruofei had even driven an armored vehicle before, so it was not a problem for him to drive this monster – Class SUV. He drove the car through the villa’s Gate and came to the road outside. Then, he started to step on the accelerator. At that moment, the windows were all open. Xia ruofei felt as if an airplane had flown by, and the roar of the engine was shocking. The modified Knight XV had excellent acceleration. Xia ruofei felt a push on his back after stepping on the accelerator. The car sped up on the road. The road was only four meters wide. The Knight XV was speeding on the road at a high speed. It was very exciting. Manager Huang’s face turned pale. After a while, they arrived at the main road. Xia ruofei still had a feeling that he had not had enough. He simply drove the car in the direction of Changping County. Knight XV had the appearance of a domineering Dark Warrior. Almost 100% of people turned their heads, especially when they arrived at Changping County. Many people even took out their mobile phones to take pictures. There were only 100 units of this car in the world, and it was said that there were only three in China. It was rare to see one. What was interesting was that there was also a Hummer H2 in Changping County. Xia ruofei compared it to the Hummer H2. The top of the Hummer only reached the Knight XV’s window. In front of the Knight XV, the Hummer was like a delicate little girl. Xia ruofei dropped manager Huang off at the county town and drove to Taoyuan farm. Along the way, he also enjoyed his driving. Men seemed to be born with a love for good cars. Especially Xia ruofei, who had been through a lot in the military. In front of such a muscular super SUV, he had no resistance at all. He was deeply fascinated by this road tank. However, he suppressed his excitement and stopped the car by the roadside. He gave MA Xiong a call. When he was in Hong Kong, MA Xiong gave Xia ruofei his private phone number. “Xia Sheng! Did you receive my gift?” MA Xiong laughed as soon as he picked up the phone.”How is it? Do you like it?” Xia ruofei forced a smile.”Old Mr. MA, I’ll shamelessly accept the truffles you’ve given me. But I really can’t take this car.” “Xia Sheng, I bought this Knight XV a while ago. I’ve been modifying it in Hong Kong.” MA Xiong said,”I heard from Zhiming that you use an ordinary pickup truck every day, so I wanted to give you this car. Why? Does this car not suit your taste? It’s fine if you don’t like SUVs, I’ve also ordered a limited edition Ferrari ...” “Mr. MA, you’ve misunderstood ...” Xia ruofei quickly interrupted MA Xiong and said,”it’s not that I don’t like it, but ... This car is too expensive. I can’t take it!” This old man was really too much. He gave a supercar without considering whether other people’s small hearts could take it. Could it be that all the Super – rich people were so willful? MA Xiong immediately pretended to be angry.”Xia Sheng, you saved my life. Don’t tell me my life is not worth a few million dollars?” “That’s not what I meant ... I’ve already accepted the payment for your treatment. It’s not right for me to accept this car ...” Xia ruofei explained with a bitter smile. “Xia Sheng, are you talking about the five million Chinese dollars?” MA Xiong laughed and said,”that’s just a small token of our appreciation. The last time I went to the United States for a small knee joint surgery, it cost more than this. Not to mention, you pulled me back from the gates of hell!” MA Xiong continued,”xiasheng, why don’t you just take this car as my advance payment? that way, I’ll be able to ask you for help the next time I have a difficult and complicated illness, right?” You’re not allowed to decline again, if you do, you’re not giving me face!” Xia ruofei could only helplessly reply,””Alright then! Thank you, old Mr. MA ...” “Hahaha! It’s just a small token of appreciation. Xia Sheng, don’t be so polite!” MA Xiong said with a smile,”there’s the phone number of the car modification company in the file. Call this number if you have any problems with your car. They will immediately send someone from Hong Kong to deal with it for you!” Hahaha! This car really can’t be repaired in the mainland ...” “Alright, I got it!” Xia ruofei said. He then chatted with MA Xiong for a while and invited him to visit Sanshan when he was free before he hung up. Xia ruofei started the car again and drove the powerful and domineering super SUV back to Taoyuan farm. He had just stopped the car when pang Hao and ye Lingyun ran out of the villa. “RUO Fei! Whose car is this? The Knight XV? It’s too F * cking awesome!” Pang Hao shouted,”I’ve only seen pictures on the internet! I can’t believe I actually saw a real car today!” Ye linyun’s eyes lit up as well.”Brother Xia, where did you get this car? It’s so exciting!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,””This car is mine now.” “What?” Pang Hao cried out in shock,”yours? RUO Fei, did you win the lottery? He’s actually buying the Knight XV ...” A few workers who were working nearby saw the flashy car and surrounded it. When they heard pang Hao’s words, one of them smiled and asked,””Boss, this car looks very expensive. It must be more than a million Yuan, right?” “More than a million?” pang Hao’s mouth twitched. It’s more or less enough to buy the wheels ... This car will cost at least 15 million Yuan to import into China!” “What? 1...15 million?” The worker was so shocked by the price that he even stuttered. “Brother Xia, is this car really that expensive?” ye Lingyun asked Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.”Well ... The price of the car is about 15 to 16 million dollars. However, mine has been modified. It cost about 4 million dollars in total.” Hiss ... There was a series of gasps. Even pang Hao, who was familiar with the market, was stunned when he heard the price. After a long while, he came back to his senses and reached out his hand to Xia ruofei impatiently.””Hurry, hurry, hurry, give me the key! Let me go for a walk!” Xia ruofei slapped pang Hao’s hand away and asked,””What are you scared of? Do you have a driver’s license?” “Hehe ... I’ve already passed subject three. I’ll get my driver’s license very soon ...” Pang Hao laughed awkwardly. “Get lost!” Xia ruofei laughed and scolded,”I’m not worried about my car, but I’m worried that the wall won’t be able to take it!” The crowd burst into laughter. Pang Hao knew that he did not have a driver’s license, and it was definitely dangerous to drive such a powerful off – Road vehicle, so he could only pull back his hand resentfully. “Brother Xia ...” Ye Lingyun said weakly. Xia ruofei glanced at him and threw the car keys to him.””Come back after one round! Don’t drive too fast, this is a car, not an airplane ...” “Yes!” Ye Lingyun was overjoyed. He quickly opened the car door and got in. “Hey, hey, hey! RUO Fei, this isn’t fair! Why can’t you give it to me when I want it? you gave the key to little ye the moment she opened her mouth?” Pang Hao shouted loudly. Xia ruofei rolled his eyes.”Nonsense. He even drove an armored vehicle in the Army. How can you compare to him?” “I ...” Pang Hao was suddenly at a loss for words. On the other side, ye Lingyun could not wait to start the car. The Knight XV made a loud roar. “Wait, wait, wait!” Pang Hao quickly shouted. I can’t drive it, but it shouldn’t be a problem to take a car!” After that, he jogged to the other side, opened the door of the front passenger seat, and climbed up on his hands and feet. His chubby body seemed very flexible. Ye Lingyun drove pang Hao and the Knight XV out of the villa’s courtyard. Xia ruofei returned to the villa immediately. Yingying was very confident in ye Lingyun’s driving skills. She knew that this kid would definitely be fine. As Xia ruofei went upstairs, he was thinking about an important matter – cultivating truffles! [PS] the 6th update is over, please subscribe please monthly tickets ahhhhhhhhh ...
