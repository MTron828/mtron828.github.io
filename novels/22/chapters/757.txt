Chapter 758: Just right (2)

Guo Zhan let out a long breath and patted Xia ruofei’s shoulder.””Brother! Thanks!”

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile and also patted Guo Zhan lightly. He could see that Guo Zhan’s mood was more excited. This old leader, who was extremely calm, had a lot of emotional fluctuations today, which was a little different from the Guo Zhan in his impression.

Xia ruofei asked Guo Zhan to sit down and calm down. Then, he looked up at the infusion bag. There was still about one – third of the spirit Heart Flower petal solution left.

Xia ruofei nodded to himself. After using the spirit Heart Flower petal solution so many times, he was more experienced in controlling the concentration and dosage. This time, he controlled it very accurately.

If the concentration of the solution was too high and the amount used was too large, there would be a situation where not only would the poison be completely eliminated, but even the external wounds would start to heal. This would be too shocking.

It seemed that today’s dosage was just about right. Due to the length of the syringe, the spirit Heart Flower petal solution in the small porcelain bottle was not completely extracted. However, Xia ruofei did a rough calculation and felt that the dosage should be about right. The poison that even the specialists in the General Hospital were unable to do anything about couldn’t be completely removed in one dose, right?

There were also gunshot wounds and wounds left by surgery. They couldn’t be healed without medicine, right?

So ... Xia ruofei looked at Jin Gang, who was lying on the hospital bed in a daze, and said silently in his heart,”Xiao Ling, I can only let you suffer a little.

The men of the lone wolf assault team were not afraid of death, so what was a little pain?

Xia ruofei and Guo Zhan didn’t make a sound. When the bag of petal solution was finished, the nurse outside came in to change the bottle.

The nurse was still a little strange. She felt that this bottle took much longer than expected. She looked at Xia ruofei and Guo Zhan suspiciously. However, their superiors had specifically instructed that the patient’s situation was special and the confidentiality level was extremely high. Therefore, Guo Zhan could act as he pleased.

Therefore, even though the nurse found it strange, she did not say anything.

As for the monitoring images of the ICU, the nurses naturally had no access to them. Xia ruofei knew that Guo Zhan would definitely coordinate for them to be deleted, so he was not worried.

......

After the nurse changed the bottle, she checked Jin Gang’s various physical indicators as usual. She could not help but let out a low cry of surprise.

In particular, Jin Gang’s complexion and skin color had obviously improved. Even people without medical professional knowledge could see it.

“Nurse, is there a problem?” Guo Zhan asked.

“The patient seems to be getting better,” The nurse said excitedly,”I’ll report to director Cai immediately!”

After that, the nurse ran out in a hurry.

Xia ruofei and Guo Zhan looked at each other. Although their masks covered their expressions, they quickly read each other’s intentions from their eyes.

“Blood Wolf, if you’re afraid of trouble, why don’t you leave first?” Guo Zhan said.

Guo Zhan was very clear about the significance of Xia ruofei’s treatment. He knew that this old subordinate of his must have some secrets, but Guo Zhan didn’t care. Who didn’t have some privacy? Xia ruofei would have told himself if he could.

Moreover, in a unit with such a high level of confidentiality, Guo Zhan had long been used to keeping his mouth shut. He also had many things that he could not tell Xia ruofei, even if they were as close as brothers, such as this operation.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Don’t worry. Your security level is the best shield. However, don’t take off my mask. Also, I’ll have to trouble you to get rid of the surveillance footage today.”

“Don’t worry!”Guo Zhan nodded.

After a while, academician Cai zhengbin, the director of the surgery department of the General Hospital, entered the ICU with a group of experts. They immediately did a comprehensive examination of Jin Gang’s condition.

The results were soon out. The amount of toxins in xufang’s blood had been reduced by 80% compared to the examination after the operation.

In other words, only about 20% of the original poison remained in his body.

Academician Cai zhengbin said excitedly,”this is great!” You’ve won us precious time for follow – up treatment!”

Guo Zhan bowed to the White – haired old academician and said,””Academician Cai, I’m very grateful to you for your hard work in saving the life of an ordinary soldier. However ...... I think we have already found a way to deal with the poison, so we won’t trouble you with the detoxification. ”

Cai zhengbin was stunned for a moment, and the experts and students behind him all looked unhappy.

What the hell is this?

However, Cai zhengbin didn’t think that it was a surprise at all. He heard unusual information from Guo Zhan’s words.

“Comrade, you ... You’re saying that you’ve found an effective anti – Poison drug?” Cai zhengbin asked excitedly.

Guo Zhan nodded his head with absolute certainty.

Cai zhengbin immediately turned his eyes to Xia ruofei, who was next to Guo Zhan. However, Xia ruofei was wearing a sterile suit and a mask, so he couldn’t recognize her at all.

Guo Zhan seemed to have seen through Cai zhengbin’s thoughts and said with a trace of apology,”Academician Cai, I’m sorry ... This matter is highly confidential. I have no right to disclose the anti – Poison drug and treatment plan, including the identity of this comrade. Please understand.”

A chief physician behind Cai zhengbin could not help but frown and said,”This is against the rules, right? “The patient was treated by our hospital, and chief Cai was the chief surgeon for the operation. We also organized a consultation overnight regarding the poison resistance therapy. You used unknown drug without the hospital’s permission, and you kept it a secret from us ...”

Cai zhengbin turned around and glared at the chief physician. He said,”Little Huang, mind your words!”

Most of the experts in this group of lecturers and assistant lecturers were Cai zhengbin’s students. Many of them had followed Cai zhengbin from undergraduate, master ‘s, and PhD students. Therefore, when academician Cai said this, they all quieted down.

In fact, Cai zhengbin knew very well what his students were thinking. This unknown poison was so fierce and so difficult to treat. If he could study the principle and dig deeper, it would definitely be an excellent topic. A little sorting out would be a very good result.

Now that the poison resistance treatment had nothing to do with them, how could they not be anxious?

And it was very obvious that the anti – Poison drugs that Guo Zhan and the others found were the right ones, which made the medical experts even more eager.

However, Cai zhengbin also knew that the injured person, including Guo Zhan, who sent the injured person, came from a highly confidential unit, and it was the military chief who called overnight to personally ask about it.

The military chief even called his cell phone and told him that these two people were very important, and that they had to do their best to save the lives of the wounded. At the same time, he also emphasized confidentiality and discipline. He only needed to do the treatment well and should not ask about things that should not be asked.

Academician Cai, who had been in the military for decades, naturally knew the weight of his words. So, after he scolded chief physician Huang, he immediately said to Guo Zhan,”We respect your opinion. In addition to the anti – Poison treatment, our General Hospital will also send the most elite forces in other aspects to ensure that there are no accidents during the recovery period of the injured! If you need anything, you can call me directly. ”

“Thank you, elder Cai!” Guo Zhan said sincerely.

Cai zhengbin smiled and nodded. Then, he left the ward with the experts from his department. The problem of the unknown toxin had been basically solved. The vital signs of the patient were very stable. There was no need for so many experts to keep an eye on him.

After the doctors left, Xia ruofei grinned and gave Guo Zhan a thumbs up.

Guo Zhan looked at Jin Gang, who was lying on the bed, and said,”Sanguine Wolf, Xiao Ling’s condition is basically stable. Let’s go out for a smoke?”

“Alright!”

Xia ruofei stood up, and the two of them left the ICU. After changing out of their sterile clothes, Xia ruofei didn’t take off his mask and just walked out with it on.

It was definitely not allowed to smoke in the hospital, so the two of them came to the end of the corridor and went to the balcony outside. Guo Zhan took out a cigarette box, took out a cigarette, and threw it to Xia ruofei. Then, he took out a cigarette and lit it up.

Xia ruofei took a deep breath and then let out a long breath. He looked at the dark night sky without saying a word.

However, what was going to come would still come.

“Did Niu Tao tell you everything?” Guo Zhan asked calmly.

Xia ruofei’s body trembled slightly. He turned back to look at Guo Zhan and nodded silently. The familiar faces of his comrades appeared in front of his eyes. Who would it be ... Who would unfortunately die in this mission?

Guo Zhan took a few puffs, and the cigarette soon burned to the end. He threw the cigarette butt on the ground and opened his mouth with trembling lips ...
