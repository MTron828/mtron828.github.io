Chapter 705: Super – stimulant (2)

There was a commotion among the parents as they stretched their necks to look in, trying to find their children among the candidates in school uniforms.

After the examinees came out, they quickly found their parents. The school gate also began to become noisy.

“Qiang Qiang, how did you do?”

“Daughter, are the questions difficult?”

“Don’t even think about it after the exam! There was still a math exam in the afternoon! Let’s go home, your mom made you some delicious food!”

……

The mood of the candidates was also different. Those who did well in the exam walked a lot more briskly with smiles on their faces, while those who didn’t do well had sullen faces. Some girls with weaker psychological qualities even shed tears on the spot.

The entrance of the examination hall was extremely lively!

Xia ruofei also came to the door. After a while, he saw Lin Qiao and two other girls walking out, talking and laughing.

The sharp – eyed Lin Qiao found Xia ruofei at a glance. She shouted happily,””Brother ruofei!”

Then, he quickly exchanged a few words with the girls beside him, waved at them, and jogged towards Xia ruofei.

Lin Qiao grabbed Xia ruofei’s arm and said happily,””Brother ruofei, you’ve really been waiting for me the whole morning!”

Xia ruofei pulled Lin Qiao’s hand away and said,””Girl, your classmates are all here! Be careful of your influence!”

......

“I don’t want to!” Lin Qiao held Xia ruofei’s arm tightly and pressed her body against Xia ruofei ‘s.”What’s wrong with me holding my brother’s hand?” Who dares to say that!”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly. Lin Qiao’s youthful and energetic body was on his body. The soft touch on his arm made him feel a little uncomfortable.

The two of them walked to the parking space not far away. Xia ruofei didn’t ask Lin Qiao about her exam until the two of them got into the car. Xia ruofei then asked,””Qiao’ er, did you drink the Chinese medicine I gave you before the exam?”

“How would I dare to disobey brother Fei’s instructions?” Lin Qiao smiled and said,”brother ruofei, what kind of godly medicine is that? After I drank it, I felt that my head was especially clear and my reaction speed was much faster than before. There were a few questions that I didn’t review today, but I actually solved them after thinking about it!”

Xia ruofei started the car and drove it out of the parking space. He laughed and said,””So you’re saying that you did pretty well in the first subject?”

“I’m feeling pretty good!” Lin Qiao said,”but our teacher said not to match the answers after the exam to avoid affecting the mood of the later exams. So ... I’m not sure how I did in the exam!”

“It’s good that you feel good!” Xia ruofei skillfully maneuvered the car and said,”your teacher is right. It’s meaningless to answer now. It’ll only affect your mood.”

“You still haven’t told me what kind of godly medicine it is!” Lin qiaojiao said angrily.

“A super drug! There will be strong side effects after a few days. ” Xia ruofei smiled and turned to look at Lin Qiao. He asked,”are you scared?”

Lin Qiao was stunned for a moment. Then, she curled her lips and said,”Tsk! I don’t believe it! If this thing was harmful, you wouldn’t have let me drink it! It’s fine if you don’t want to tell me ...”

Xia ruofei smiled but didn’t say anything. No matter how Lin Qiao asked, he wouldn’t say anything.

In fact, what Xia ruofei prepared for Lin Qiao was an enhanced version of the heart – nourishing soup. He had taken the heart – nourishing soup before and found that his mind was particularly clear and active in the first two hours after drinking it.

This was the main effect of the heart – nourishing soup. The treatment of autism was a “by – Product” that Xia ruofei had accidentally discovered.

Therefore, Xia ruofei had made the heart – nourishing soup in advance and added the solution of the petals of the spirit Heart Flower without caring about the cost. Finally, he divided the medicinal soup into four portions so that Lin Qiao could drink it once for each subject.

The heart – nourishing soup could help Lin Qiao improve her brain’s thinking ability in a short period of time, while the spirit Heart Flower petal solution could recuperate her body. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

After a long preparation period for the college entrance examination, many students were in a state of sub – Health. Moreover, Lin Qiao was a girl. If her “relatives” came during the examination, she might have a stomachache or something.

With the petal solution of the spiritual heart Flower, she could make sure that all these small problems would be swept away. It could also remove fatigue and let Lin Qiao be in the best state for the exam.

Xia ruofei’s considerations were thorough.

The car continued to move forward, but Lin Qiao soon found that the road seemed to be wrong. She couldn’t help but ask,””Brother ruofei, I don’t think we should go home this way!”

“I didn’t say I was going home!” Xia ruofei chuckled.

At this moment, the car had already reached the Kempinski Hotel. Xia ruofei turned the steering wheel and drove the car into the hotel’s parking lot. Then, he skillfully parked the car in the parking space.

“Kempinski?” Lin Qiao asked,”brother ruofei, what’s the situation?”

“Get out of the car! You’ll be staying here for the next two days!” Xia ruofei said,”this place is closer to the exam hall. You can rest better.”

“Wow! It’s a five – Star hotel!” Lin Qiao said,”brother ruofei, you are really generous!”

“You think I wanted to ...” Xia ruofei said helplessly.”I went to the nearby rujia, Suba, and Jinjiang star ... They were all full! The examinees “parents have already booked the tickets one or two months in advance!”
