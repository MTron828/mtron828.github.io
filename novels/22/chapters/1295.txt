Chapter 1296: Chapter 781 -“bad”_1

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””Tell boss Xu that I’m free between 3:30 and 4:30.”

“Alright!” Liu Qian immediately said and turned around to pass on the message.

Feng Rao smiled and said to Xia ruofei,””We’re only giving them an hour?”

Business negotiations like this were usually long and drawn out. Even if bojun real estate was in a hurry to cash out, it was inevitable that there would be a tug – of – War during a negotiation. An hour was too short a time.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””We’re not the ones who are anxious now! It’s good for us to give them a sense of urgency. ”

“Don’t go too far ...” Feng Rao couldn’t help but say.”If bojun gives up on the deal with us, it’ll be hard to find such a good opportunity in the future.”

“Like I said, the possibility of that is very small.” Xia ruofei said,”besides, I didn’t make things difficult for them. As soon as they suggested to restart the negotiations, I agreed!”

“Alright! It’s fine as long as you’re confident. ” Feng Jing stood up and said,”then, about the negotiation this afternoon ...”

“I’ll prepare!” Xia ruofei said confidently,”you’ll come with me.”

“Alright!” Feng Jing said,”I’ll go over first!”

After Feng Jing left, Xia ruofei returned to his desk and went through all the information he had gathered. He thought about all the possible problems that might arise during the afternoon’s negotiations and finally smiled.

Soon, the name of the balance power building would be changed!

Since it was almost time for lunch, Xia ruofei did not skip work and continued to watch a movie on his computer.

Time passed by slowly, and soon it was time to get off work in the morning.

Just as Xia ruofei was packing his things and was about to head down to the canteen for lunch, his phone on his desk started to vibrate.

Xia ruofei took a look and answered the phone.””President Lin! I heard you were promoted? I haven’t had the time to congratulate you!”

It was president Lin from Qiantang Tongren Hall. He had been promoted to the Deputy General Manager of the East China region due to his outstanding performance not long ago.

The cooperation between peach blossom company and Tongren Hall was mainly in the charge of President Lin. The tin maple bucket was sent to Qiantang city regularly, and President Lin’s promotion was reported back by the company’s employees.

The reason why Mr. Lin was able to produce such outstanding results was inextricably linked to Xia ruofei. Whether it was the rare wild ginseng or the scheduled supply of the best iron – skinned maple, they were all things that were difficult to purchase on the market. In the past six months, Mr. Lin had brought a continuous supply of high – Quality goods to Tongren Hall. It was reasonable for him to be promoted by one rank.

Hence, Xia ruofei could be considered CEO Lin’s greatest benefactor.

“Director Xia, this is all thanks to you!” President Lin said very politely.

“Hahaha! It’s a win – win situation!” Xia ruofei said.

“Director Xia,” President Lin said,”I’m looking for you this time for two things. Please take care of me, director Xia!” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“We’re old friends, so there’s no need to be so polite. As long as I can help, I’ll do my best!” Xia ruofei said.

“Then I’ll thank you in advance, President Xia.” President Lin said,”the first thing is about the iron Kaede fight. President Xia, can you sign a new supply agreement with us ...”

“What’s wrong? Do you feel that the previous agreement was inappropriate, President Lin?” Xia ruofei asked, frowning.

He thought to himself,”did Mr. Lin think that the price he had signed before was too high?”

Back then, President Lin had personally come to Tao Yuan farm to discuss the Ironhide Kaede bucket. Feng Jing had personally negotiated the price, and it was indeed higher. After the agreement was signed, President Lin had even half – jokingly complained to Xia ruofei.

However, Xia ruofei felt that it was impossible! Although the supply price was relatively high, Tongren Hall still had a large profit space. Moreover, there was only one shop that could supply a large amount of iron – hide maple Dipper of that grade. Tongren Hall basically monopolized the business and made a lot of money every month!

Sure enough, President Lin quickly said,”President Xia, don’t misunderstand. All conditions remain the same!” I ... I mainly want to change the main purchasing party to the East China region of Tongren Hall ...”

Xia ruofei understood immediately and couldn’t help but laugh.”President Lin, you’re taking drastic measures the moment you leave. Aren’t you afraid that your old subordinates will curse you?”

Mr. Lin smiled awkwardly.”In fact, after our Qiantang shop purchased the goods, we also distributed them to the major stores in the country. However, I was the one who negotiated the contract, so it was not convenient for the leader to take them away at that time. In fact, the bulk of the purchases were made in the major regions, and it was easier to coordinate the distribution of resources in all aspects ...”

“Alright, alright, alright, we’ll do as you say!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll talk to the legal department.”

He wasn’t interested in listening to President Lin’s ramble about those things. In any case, there was no loss for the Paradise company. It was just a re – signing of the agreement, so why not do him a favor at no cost?

“Thank you, director Xia!” President Lin quickly said. I’ll send someone to contact your company tomorrow!”

Then, with a trace of anticipation, President Lin asked,””President Xia, there’s one more thing ... Do you have the Cordyceps that you bought last time?”

Previously, Xia ruofei had used the time flow of 30 times in the Archean realm to test the cultivation of Cordyceps. He had harvested about 500 grams. Although it was a small amount, it was all bought by CEO Lin.
