Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei didn’t have to wait long for Ma Zhiming to reply.

“Mr. Xia, this is a top – grade black jade!”

This sentence was followed by three shocked emojis.

Xia ruofei had never doubted the value of this piece of Jade. At least until now, the reaction of the spirit painting scroll had never been wrong. Therefore, when he saw Ma Zhiming’s reply, although he was very happy, he was not overjoyed.

Before Xia ruofei could reply, Ma Zhiming quickly sent another message.”Mr. Xia, the picture doesn’t look very real. Do you want to buy this piece of Imperial Jade? Black jade of this level is very, very rare. Even I have never seen one in my many years of work!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. His fingers quickly tapped on the screen and replied to Ma Zhiming,””Mr. MA, there is no doubt about its authenticity, because I personally cut this piece of Jade out of the raw stone, and it is an old raw material!”

After Xia ruofei sent this message, Ma Zhiming’s side was silent for a while. Then, he directly gave up on WeChat communication and called.

Xia ruofei picked it up and smiled.””Mr. MA!”

Ma Zhiming’s voice was very excited as he said,”Mr. Xia, so you are the owner of this top – grade black jade?”

“You can say that!” Xia ruofei laughed.

“Mr. Xia, are you interested in selling this piece of Imperial Jade?” Ma Zhiming asked excitedly,”our Hengfeng jewelry is willing to buy it at a high price! The specific price will need to be evaluated after seeing the real thing, but I can guarantee that the purchase price will not be lower than 100 million!”

Ma Zhiming didn’t doubt the authenticity of this piece of Jade at all because he had absolute trust in Xia ruofei. Since Xia ruofei said that this piece of Jade was cut out from the raw stone by himself, it couldn’t be fake. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Xia ruofei was mentally prepared. He knew that this piece of Imperial Jade might be worth a lot, but when he heard Ma Zhiming personally promise that the purchase price would be at least 100 million Yuan, he couldn’t help but feel his heart jump.

It would be a lie to say that he wasn’t tempted. Even if Xia ruofei was considered to be a little wealthy now, it wasn’t to the extent that he didn’t care about a hundred million Yuan.

However, Xia ruofei quickly resisted the temptation. He said apologetically,””I’m sorry, Mr. MA, I might have a use for this piece of Imperial Jade, so I don’t plan to sell it for the time being ...”

“I see ...” Ma Zhiming said regretfully.”That’s really a pity. This kind of extremely rare Jade can be regarded as the treasure of our Hengfeng jewelry ...”

“Mr. MA, I would like to ask ... If such a black jade is cut into a finished product, what kind of product should it be made into?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

Ma Zhiming answered without thinking,”black jadeite represents darkness, and at the same time, it also represents righteousness. Therefore, it is generally made into pendants in the image of Zhong Kui, Bao Gong, Guan Gong, or other ornaments. It can also be made into beads, bracelets, and so on. It can ward off evil spirits and avoid disasters. Ordinary evil spirits can’t get close to it!”

In fact, Hong Kong had a relatively well – preserved culture of Feng Shui and metaphysics, especially in the upper class of society. Many people believed in this, so black jade products were the most popular in Hong Kong.

Xia ruofei’s Black jadeite was of the best quality in terms of quality, purity, hardness, water head, and so on. If it was made into a finished product, it would undoubtedly be favored and pursued by countless people. Hence, Ma Zhiming was eager to buy this black jadeite.

“I see. I’ve learned a lot ...” Xia ruofei smiled.

“Mr. Xia, do you want to make a finished product of this Jade?” asked Ma Zhiming. If that’s the case, there are a few old masters in the processing plant under our company who are very good at carving. Do you want them to be processed here? We don’t charge a single cent for the processing fee. As long as the finished product is completed, if there are any extra pieces, Mr. Xia, you can sell them to our company at the market price!”

Xia ruofei was a little embarrassed to reject Ma Zhiming’s offer when he saw how enthusiastic he was.

However, he obviously wouldn’t let others do it for him. In terms of carving skills, there might be many people who were better than him. However, Xia ruofei was very confident in the finished product. Even the old master of Hengfeng jewelry would not be able to compare to him.

This was because he could carve out a kind of divine charm that other Masters couldn’t show. In addition, the most important point was that he could carve all kinds of array patterns on these jade products, so that they were no longer simple ornaments, but had a certain function.

“Thank you for your kindness, Mr. MA. I’ll contact you again if I need to.” Xia ruofei said.

When Ma Zhiming heard this, he knew that Xia ruofei had already tactfully rejected him. He could not help but secretly sigh.

“It doesn’t matter where this piece of Jade is processed. If there are any remaining finished products, Hengfeng jewelry will be my first consideration,” Xia ruofei added.

Ma Zhiming suddenly had a feeling of a ray of light at the end of the tunnel. He was overjoyed and said, “That’s great! Thank you, Mr. Xia!”

“You’re welcome, I’m just doing business! I’ll be more at ease if I work with you, won’t I?” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“That’s right, that’s right!” Ma Zhiming said and then asked,”Mr. Xia, do you really not need our master to help? Our Hengfeng jewelry’s old master’s skills are much better than some famous mainland Masters ...”
