Chapter 1516: A different song Wei (1)

Translator: 549690339

The white fox looked at Xia ruofei in confusion.

Xia ruofei’s face was slightly bitter as he said,””You weren’t lying to me before, were you? Didn’t you say that you could find my friend by breaking the formation? Now that the array has been broken and you’ve eaten so many world stones, where are my friends? Where is he?”

The White realmfox seemed to have indigestion from eating too much. After it burped, it was stunned for a moment before it finally understood what Xia ruofei meant. It lazily stretched out its forelimbs and gestured a few times, indicating that Xia ruofei should follow it.

It then jumped off the stone platform and walked out of the cave unhurriedly.

Xia ruofei opened his eyes wide and said,””So cracking the formation has nothing to do with my friend! You’re too cunning!”

The white fox turned around and looked at Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei could clearly see the disdain in its eyes, as if it was saying,”didn’t you also get so many benefits?”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He couldn’t do anything to this realm Fox. Since the White realm Fox had been in the underground palace longer than him, it must be very familiar with the environment. Moreover, it was so fast. It might really know where Song Wei was!

After the white fox was full, it slowed down and walked in front at a steady pace. Xia ruofei did not dare to rush it too much as he was afraid that this little ancestor would quit and he would have to try his luck again.

As he followed the white fox, Xia ruofei was lost in thought.

This underground Palace was strange everywhere. He was clearly in that huge square, and then he inexplicably came here with the world collapsing. So where was he now? Was it under the square? Or did he simply go to another space?

Xia ruofei could vaguely feel that this underground Palace was extremely dangerous. Now that he had obtained the world stone and even obtained some extra rewards, he was in a hurry to leave this place.

However, his priority was to find Song Wei.

Just as Xia ruofei was lost in his thoughts, the white fox suddenly stopped.

Xia ruofei quickly stopped in his tracks and looked in the direction that the White realm Fox’s forelimb was pointing at. Suddenly, his entire body trembled.

There was a stone room about ten meters ahead.

The door of the stone room was left ajar. Through the door, he could clearly see a woman lying quietly on a stone bed. Although he could not see her face from this angle, from her clothing, it should be Song Wei.

Xia ruofei’s heart was burning with anxiety. Could it be that Song Wei was already in danger?

He exerted force on his feet and dashed toward the stone room like lightning.

The white leopard cat cried out twice and tried to stop Xia ruofei. However, Xia ruofei’s speed was beyond its expectations. It could not stop him at all and Xia ruofei had already passed by it.

After rushing into the stone room, Xia ruofei had a clearer look. The woman on the bed was Song Wei.

The moment he entered the stone chamber, Xia ruofei could clearly feel a cold aura permeating the entire room. He could also sense an unknown poison that contained a trace of world stone. The concentration of this cold poison was very high and most of it was blocked in the stone chamber. Only a small amount of poison had escaped.

“Song Wei, what’s wrong?” he asked anxiously.

As Xia ruofei spoke, he had already rushed to the stone bed. He reached out and grabbed Song Wei’s wrist to check her pulse.

Xia ruofei had come into contact with this poison before and knew that it could cause people to faint.

From the looks of it, this stone room was the source of the unknown poison. Song Wei and her team members had only been infected by a small amount of poison that had escaped from here.

Xia ruofei was anxious and apologetic when he thought of how long song Wei had been in such a poisonous environment and how she was still unconscious.

If he had not insisted on walking to the altar alone, Song Wei might not have been separated from him.

She could imagine how helpless Song Wei must have felt when she disappeared from the altar ...

Xia ruofei was praying that Song Wei’s life force had not completely disappeared. At the same time, he used his spiritual power to check on Song Wei’s condition.

However, something that made Xia ruofei’s jaw drop happened.

The moment his spiritual energy touched Song Wei’s wrist, it bounced off. The huge repulsive force even bounced off Xia ruofei’s hand. He did not even have the ability to resist.

What was going on?

Xia ruofei released his spiritual power again. This time, it was the same as before. Once his spiritual power touched the surface of Song Wei’s body, there was a huge repulsive force that completely isolated his spiritual power.

Xia ruofei was even more anxious. This was definitely not a good thing for Song Wei.

Just as Xia ruofei was about to take out the petals of the spirit Heart Flower from the medium to try and wake Song Wei up, Song Wei’s eyelids twitched and she slowly opened her eyes.

“Song Wei, you’re awake!” Although Xia ruofei did not know why Song Wei suddenly woke up, he still called out in surprise.

Song Wei’s gaze fell on Xia ruofei, causing his heart to skip a beat. Her eyes were cold and emotionless.

At that moment, Xia ruofei almost thought that the song Wei in front of him was still a magical beast.

However, Xia ruofei also knew that since the white leopard had brought him here, the song Wei in front of him should not be a fake.

But why did Song Wei’s eyes suddenly become so unfamiliar and so scary? And she doesn’t seem to recognize me at all ... Xia ruofei couldn’t understand.

The white fox seemed to be very afraid of this stone room. It stood at the door and did not dare to come in. It only cried anxiously at Xia ruofei and waved its forelimbs, indicating for Xia ruofei to leave quickly.

Unfortunately, Xia ruofei’s attention was all on Song Wei. He did not care about what the realm Fox was doing.

Furthermore, even if Xia ruofei had seen it, he would not have left just like that. Song Wei’s situation seemed to be very bad. How could he leave her behind?

“Song Wei, I’m RUO Fei!” Xia ruofei looked at Song Wei and said,”you don’t recognize me?”

Song Wei’s eyes were emotionless. She stared at Xia ruofei for a few seconds before she slowly sat up from the stone bed.

Xia ruofei suddenly felt a sense of extreme danger.

Almost at the same time, Xia Qing also shouted in the space,””Master! Be careful!”

Even Xia Qing, who was in the space, could sense the extremely dense killing intent ...

Xia ruofei’s vision blurred. Song Wei, who was sitting on the stone bed just now, seemed to have turned into a white light. Xia ruofei’s cultivation was now at the advanced level, but he could not see Song Wei’s movement at all. He did not even have the time to think about blocking before he felt a huge force hit his chest.

His entire body involuntarily flew to the side and back, heavily crashing into the stone wall.

Xia ruofei felt as if his internal organs had shifted. There was a sweet taste in his throat and a stream of blood flowed from the corner of his mouth.

In fact, the instinct of a Special Forces soldier made him full of true energy the moment he hit the stone wall. Even with such protection, he was still injured and spat out blood. It could be seen how terrifying the power of the blow was. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Master! Quickly leave this stone room!” Xia Qing shouted madly in the space.

Xia ruofei also knew that the crisis was not over yet. So after he hit the stone wall, he rolled over almost subconsciously and then pounced towards the door of the stone chamber.

However, Song Wei’s speed was even faster. Xia ruofei could only feel the dangerous aura behind him in an instant.

Xia ruofei gritted his teeth and stomped on the ground with all his might. He released genuine Qi from his feet and the reaction force increased his speed.

Even so, Song Wei’s palms still landed heavily on Xia ruofei’s back.

Xia ruofei couldn’t take it anymore. He opened his mouth and spat out blood.

Fortunately, he also borrowed the force of this attack to speed up a lot more, finally leaving the stone room in a sorry state.

“Let’s go!” Xia ruofei shouted at the white fox.

However, he felt his legs go soft, as if he had lost most of his strength. He couldn’t use any strength at all.

Xia ruofei looked at the white fox again. Although it was looking into the stone room with fear, it did not run away.

Xia ruofei looked back thoughtfully. Song Wei was standing at the door of the stone room. It was as if there was an invisible barrier blocking her. She just stood there and looked at Xia ruofei coldly. Then, as if nothing had happened, she turned around and went back to the stone bed.

“She doesn’t dare to come out, or she can’t come out?” Xia ruofei muttered in his heart.

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei let out a sigh of relief. At least his safety was temporarily guaranteed. He could not imagine what would happen to him if Song Wei could leave the stone room and chase after him.

No matter how he thought about it, Xia ruofei felt that he would not be able to survive if that happened.

But how did Song Wei become like this? Xia ruofei looked at the white fox and asked,””Little guy, what’s going on?”

The white fox was making gestures and meowing, but Xia ruofei had no idea what it was trying to say.

However, he thought of a possibility, and his expression changed drastically as he asked,””She ... She couldn’t have been possessed, right?”

After speaking, Xia ruofei stared at the white fox.

The white fox nodded its head, but just as Xia ruofei’s heart sank to the bottom, it immediately shook its head.

Xia ruofei was as anxious as an ant on a hot pan.”Is it or not? Give me a definite answer!”

If Song Wei’s body was really taken by someone else, he would feel guilty for the rest of his life. Besides, he did not know how to face song Qiming and his wife.

The white fox chirped a few times, then pointed at Song Wei in the stone room.

Xia ruofei, who was so upset, did not understand what it meant.

At this moment, Xia Qing suddenly spoke.
