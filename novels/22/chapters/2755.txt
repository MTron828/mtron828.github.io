2756 The storage ring (2)

Luo Qingfeng was stunned for a moment. He quickly took off the ring and presented it to Xia ruofei with both hands, saying,””Master, it’s my fault ... This is a storage ring that I obtained by chance. There are some treasures that I’ve accumulated over the years. Please accept them!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”you’ve misunderstood!” I’m your master, not a Bandit. Why would I take your things? Quickly put it on!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Luo Qingfeng looked at Xia ruofei in confusion. He did not know whether he should keep the ring or insist on giving it to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”what are you thinking?” I just wanted to ask you if there’s any way to buy a storage ring. If possible, I would like to buy a few!”

Xia ruofei had his own spirit map space, which was more useful than any storage ring. Naturally, he did not need it.

However, he also knew how convenient it was to have a storage treasure. Therefore, if possible, he wanted to buy a few to give one to Ling Qingxue and Song Wei. He also wanted to give one to his little disciple Tang Haoran and his Grand disciple Li Yifu.

Only then did Qingfeng Luo realize that he had really misunderstood. He put the ring back on embarrassedly, and at the same time, he could not help but feel touched.

Under the control of the soul seal, his subconsciousness was completely submissive to Xia ruofei. He was Xia ruofei’s private property, let alone the storage ring. However, Xia ruofei still respected his ownership of the goods. He was obviously a very kind master.

Luo Qingfeng thought for a moment and said,”master, if it was a hundred years ago, storage rings would still be precious. However, they would not be rare.” But now the cultivation environment is getting worse and worse, and many years ago, those Yuanying and above cultivators disappeared without a trace. These people in the cultivation world now simply don’t have the ability to refine storage rings, so these things are becoming more and more rare and can’t be bought with money. ”

Xia ruofei was mentally prepared, so he nodded and said,””Alright then! Keep an eye on this for me. If there’s any news in this area, report it immediately. ”

“Yes! Master!” Luo Qingfeng hesitated for a moment and said,”if you really need a storage ring, master, this one can ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”I’ve already said that I won’t snatch your things ...”

“Master,” Luo Qingfeng quickly said.”I’m willing to offer it to you, master ...”

“Isn’t that the same?” Xia ruofei said,”alright, I’m just asking. You can go now!”

He was not interested in Luo Qingfeng’s storage ring, and there was only one. Should he give it to Song Wei? Or should he give it to Ling Qingxue? If a bowl of water wasn’t flat, the backyard could easily catch on fire, so at least two pills were needed.

“Alright!” Luo Qingfeng could tell that Xia ruofei really did not want his ring, so he could only nod helplessly.

“Master, I’ve heard something about the storage ring ...” He added after some thought.

“Oh?” Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and said,”tell me!”

“There are often people in the cultivation world who organize auctions to exchange information.” Luo Qingfeng said,”there will be an auction in a month’s time. It will be organized by the falling leaves sect and the location will be in a city near the falling leaves sect. There is news that there might be more than one storage ring at the auction ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be stunned.””The fallen leaves sect?”

“Yes! Master, have you heard of this sect?” Luo Qingfeng asked.

Xia ruofei nodded and did not say much. He asked directly,”Is the information accurate? Didn’t you say that storage rings are quite rare these days? why is there more than one at this auction?”

Xia ruofei was naturally very familiar with the fallen leaf sect because the first soul slave he took in, Liu chengfeng, was from the fallen leaf sect. Hence, he had learned a lot about the fallen leaf sect through Liu chengfeng. It could be said that other than the star Seizer sect, the sect he understood the most in the cultivation world was the fallen leaf sect.

Naturally, Xia ruofei would not tell Luo Qingfeng about this in detail.

“This subordinate has only heard of it, the news has not been verified.” Luo Qingfeng quickly said,”it is said that the storage ring was made by the same weapon refining master. There are three of them in total, and they are a set. Of course, we can’t rule out the possibility that it’s fake news, and even if it really appears in the auction, I’m afraid the price will be pushed to a very high price ...”

Xia ruofei nodded.”I understand ...” He said.”Is that auction open to all cultivators?”

“We need an invitation! In recent years, the cultivation environment has been getting worse and worse, and some rogue cultivators are unscrupulous in order to obtain cultivation resources. Therefore, the auctions in recent years are generally small – scale, mainly for the sake of safety. Only those who know each other well will be invited. ” Liu chengfeng said,”but our star Seizer sect will definitely receive an invitation. Master, do you want to participate?”

“En, since there’s news of the storage ring, there’s no harm in taking a look,” Xia ruofei said,”pay attention to the news of this auction and see if there are any storage rings. I’m preparing to go and experience it. Remember to remind me a few days in advance. ”

“Alright! Master!” “Yes!” Luo Qingfeng quickly said,”I will make the proper arrangements!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and asked in embarrassment,””Oh right, this kind of auction ... What do they usually use to pay? It can’t be secular coins, right?”

The money in the secular world, even the firm US dollars or euros, was worthless in the eyes of cultivators. Only cultivation resources were the most important to them. If money couldn’t be exchanged for cultivation resources, what was the difference between money and waste paper? However, since it was an auction, it naturally had to be measured with a universal currency. After all, bartering was not very convenient. The value of the items was different, and if one wanted to successfully trade, it would take a lot of effort.

Qingfeng Luo was a little surprised. He had always thought that this young master must have a powerful sect behind him. He did not expect that he did not even know some common knowledge about the cultivation world.

Of course, the general knowledge of the cultivation world in Luo Qingfeng’s eyes might not be clear to some low – Level cultivators in the Qi refining stage. They had not reached that level yet. Hence, Xia ruofei might not be able to understand some things very well just through Liu chengfeng and Zheng Yongshou.

However, since Xia ruofei had asked, Luo Qingfeng did not dare to disobey. He explained patiently,””Master, in this kind of auction, we usually use spirit stones to trade.”

Then, he took out a few crystals that contained a certain amount of spiritual Qi from his storage ring and handed them to Xia ruofei.”This is a spiritual stone. It contains a certain amount of spiritual Qi. However, compared to the spiritual crystal that master gave me, the spiritual Qi in the spiritual stone is much worse in both quality and concentration.”

Xia ruofei took it and looked at it. These spiritual stones were all cut according to the standard. Each one was the same size and the spiritual Qi inside was almost the same. No wonder they were used as currency.

The concentration of spiritual Qi in spiritual stones was indeed much lower than that of spiritual crystals.

Even so, this kind of spirit stone was considered a relatively precious cultivation resource. Not only could it be used as money, but it could also be used directly for cultivation.

Xia ruofei understood immediately. No wonder Liu chengfeng and the others did not mention anything about spiritual stones. With their cultivation, they had probably never touched spiritual stones before.

“Can crystals be used as currency?” Xia ruofei asked.

Although these spiritual stones were low – grade, Xia ruofei did not have any! The most inferior things he had were spirit crystals. Now, he didn’t even need spirit crystals. He directly used origin crystals for cultivation.

“Of course you can!” Qingfeng Luo said,”according to the market price in the past, one spiritual crystal can be exchanged for 1000 spiritual stones. Now, there is a price but no supply. After all, spiritual crystals are very rare. If someone is willing to exchange spiritual crystals, I’m afraid they can be exchanged for at least 1200 spiritual stones.”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei felt relieved.””That’s good! Alright, you guys can set off!”
