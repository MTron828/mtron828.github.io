“President Wei, don’t worry! I know my limits!” Tang weiran said,”as long as he doesn’t mess up this time, I’ll even worship him like a little ancestor!” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Wei Jianming couldn’t help but laugh as well.”Then you go! Although this matter is a crisis, it might not be a bad thing. It might be a chance for us!”

“Okay, President Wei. I’ll go and prepare now ...” Tang weiran got up and said goodbye to Wei Jianming.

Wei Jianming smiled and nodded. He stood up and walked Tang weiran to the door.

Then he closed the office door. At this time, Wei Jun also walked out from the resting room.

“Did you all hear that?” Wei Jianming took out a cigarette and asked.

Wei Jun’s face had a trace of excitement as he said,”Mm! Dad! You’re too awesome!”

Wei Jianming patted Wei Jun’s shoulder and said,”Little Jun, you handled this matter very well! You should immediately reply to Hou Liang and Zhao Yongjun!”

“Alright!” Wei Jun said happily,”dad, then I’ll be leaving first!”

Although the matter wasn’t settled yet, Wei Jun knew that it shouldn’t be a big problem since Wei Jianming placed so much importance on it, so he was prepared to inform Zhao Yongjun and Hou Liang first.

It had only been about an hour, and he had already done this much. No matter what, he was a man who attached great importance to this matter, and his attitude was quite correct.

“Mm! The water in the capital is very deep. You need to speak less and see more. If you don’t understand, you can ask Hou Liang. ” Wei Jianming said.

“I know, dad!” Wei Jun said obediently.

After Wei Jun left, Wei Jianming sat there for a while, deep in thought. Then, he snuffed out his cigarette, stood up, and returned to the conference room.

......

Sanshan city.

Xia ruofei returned to the small villa after lunch. Then, he entered the spirit map space in his room. Although there were some problems with the sales of the Cordyceps, he still placed great importance on the harvest.

He stayed in the space for a while and watched Xia Qing excavate the wormgrass skillfully. He couldn’t help but be eager to join her in excavating the wormgrass.

After more than an hour of hard work, Xia ruofei finally left the cordyceps cultivation garden. He wasn’t tired, but he wanted to take a nap in the afternoon. After all, he couldn’t work continuously without sleep like Xia Qing.

After Xia ruofei returned to the bedroom outside, she went straight to the bathroom to wash off the mud on her body. After changing into her coral fleece home clothes, she slipped into her Cotton Slippers and entered the bedroom.

After he lay on the bed, he picked up his phone from the bedside table and saw that there were two missed calls.

Both calls were made by Zhao Yongjun, and there was about ten minutes between the two calls. It seemed that he had called while he was in the spirit map space.

Hence, Xia ruofei immediately called back.

“Ruofei, you finally picked up the phone!” Zhao Yongjun said.

Xia ruofei chuckled and asked,”brother Zhao, what’s the situation?” What’s the matter?”

“It’s still about aweto,” Zhao Yongjun said.”I’ve helped you find someone and passed a message to the higher – ups of the Tongren Tang Group. The other party attached great importance to it and immediately sent a Vice President to San Shan in person to deal with this matter! I think he’ll contact you this afternoon!”

Xia ruofei was a little surprised, but at the same time, he felt a trace of warmth in his heart. He said,””Brother Zhao, why would I trouble you to use your favor for this? This is not appropriate ...”

“What kind of bullshit is this!” Zhao Yongjun said,”do we have to be so distant between us brothers? Then you helped my father, so I won’t be able to repay you in this lifetime, right?”

“Fine, I was wrong!” Xia ruofei readily accepted his advice and immediately said,”brother Zhao, I won’t stand on ceremony with you ...”

“That’s the way!” Zhao Yongjun said,”ruofei, their Vice President Tang is in charge of the chain company. His words are very effective! When the time comes, you don’t have to be so polite with him. If they still want to cooperate well, just state the price. Also, if you’re not satisfied with Chen shun’s way of handling things, don’t give up so easily!”

“Alright! I got it!” Xia ruofei said and continued to ask,”by the way, why is the situation at Tongren Hall so complicated? How much higher is this Vice President compared to manager Chen shun?”

Zhao Yongjun couldn’t help but laugh,””Ruofei, have you not done a basic understanding of your business partners?”

“Hey! I’ll just sell things to them and then collect the money. Anyway, if my things are good, they’re also rushing to buy them. Why would I know their situation?” Xia ruofei said nonchalantly,”I like the food of a restaurant. I don’t need to know the capital structure of the restaurant or the resume of the chef, right?”

“That’s true!” Zhao Yongjun laughed.”The person who came today is the Vice President of the Tongren Tang Group. Strictly speaking, the one you dealt with before is a subsidiary of the Tongren Tang Group, which is the Tongren Tang chain. It’s mainly a chain of pharmacies in various regions and cities. In addition to this chain company, the Tongren Tang Group has more than ten subsidiaries, including the Research Institute and Chinese medicine hospital. There are two listed companies under its banner, which are very large in scale. He is the Vice President of a big group and is in charge of the chain company. How much older do you think he is than that bullsh * t purchasing manager?”
