2565 High evaluation_2

However, maserino was still very gentlemanly. He did not hesitate to praise the two Chinese players of the Spanish team.”There is no doubt that the two Chinese players on the other side dominated the game today! Number 24 is very intelligent. His running in the front field has caused us a lot of trouble; On the other hand, summer’s performance on the 25th was even more phenomenal. It could be said that he had turned the team’s defeat into victory with his own ability. If you want to ask me why we lost today, I only want to say one thing: That is, Spain has Xia, but we don ‘t!”

Similarly, the Spanish players were full of praise for Xia ruofei. For example, Xia ruofei’s “fanboy”, mark Roka, said in an interview,””Mr. Xia is my idol! The effect of his arrival is immediate and can improve the strength of the Spanish team by a large margin!”

There were also the Spanish team’s main center forward, Iglesia, Captain Lopez, main center back, Naldo, and others. They all gave high praise to Xia ruofei’s performance in front of the reporters. In addition to the fact that Xia ruofei was a shareholder of the club, it was more because he had completely conquered the hearts of the fans and teammates with one game.

The players also expressed enough goodwill to Wu Lei, who was also from China. They all said that because of the language barrier, they did not communicate much with Wu Lei, but they could feel that Wu Lei was a very good person. Everyone was getting more and more tacit during training.

When everyone saw a Chinese Billboard or poster, Wu Lei would teach everyone the Chinese pronunciation of the advertisement, and now many players on the team had learned a few simple Chinese words.

In short, the atmosphere within the Spanish team could be said to be harmonious.

Of course, there were also those who did not welcome Wu Lei’s arrival, such as melondo and puado, who were produced by the Spain youth training.

Pouado had been brought off the field early on because of his poor performance, but Wu Lei, who replaced him, had a wonderful performance. He was already biased against Chinese players, which made him even more upset.

Even though Metatron did not say it, he did look down on Wu Lei. Melondo was a little clingy on the field. Often, when the football was in his phase, the rhythm would slow down, and he rarely passed the ball to Wu Lei. However, his performance in the last game was terrible, especially in the second half when he was almost invisible.

Their terrible performance clearly served as a foil to Xia ruofei and Wu Lei’s outstanding performance.

How could they feel comfortable?

However, with this kind of dissatisfaction, they naturally would not accept the media’s interview. Even if they were asked questions about Wu Lei and Xia ruofei, they did not dare to publicly express their dissatisfaction. Otherwise, it would destroy the stability of the locker room. The two of them were just young players. Their weight was too light. Moreover, Xia ruofei was a shareholder of the club. Even if they were dissatisfied, they did not dare to publicly express it.

In addition to reporting on the post – Match interviews, marca also interviewed the managers of the other La Liga teams and famous football stars, asking them to make their comments on Xia ruofei. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Real Madrid’s manager, Zidane, said,”after yesterday’s game, a lot of people called me and asked me to see Xia’s goal. There were also a lot of people like you who wanted me to evaluate the goal.” What I want to say is that there are no two completely identical leaves in the world, and the same is true for the world of football. It is because of the infinite possibilities that football has such a great charm that attracts us! Indeed, Xia’s wonderful world wave was similar to my goal in the past, but it was also unique! If I had to make a comparison between the two goals, I even think ... Xia’s goal was more brilliant!”

After giving Xia ruofei’s half – turn and mid – Air shot, which was a copy of the heavenly fairy, a very high evaluation, Zidane also gave Xia ruofei a further evaluation. He said,””Short – lived? No, no, no! I don’t think so! In fact, I spent more than an hour today watching the entire video of that game from the moment Xia was brought on. “From a head coach’s point of view, Xia’s wonderful play was not just in those three goals. His every touch of the ball was very reasonable, his vision was very wide, and his physical fitness was stronger than most players. I think he is an extremely good player and can play the role of B2B’s midfield commander. He played a very important and decisive role in both the offense and defense of the team! In the next season, Spain’s opponents will have a headache. Of course, this also includes our Real Madrid team!”

Zidane’s evaluation of Xia ruofei was quite high, even beyond many people’s expectations. After all, Xia ruofei had only played in one game, and he was a substitute. Even though he had an extremely outstanding performance, many people still held a judgmental attitude. In history, there were many players who had performed very well in a few games or even a season, but quickly faded away. Xia ruofei’s performance in only one game, no matter how good he was, was not rare. After all, it was not that convincing.

However, Zidane was a legendary star player who had been very successful as a player and had a very high starting point as a manager. His observation perspective was naturally different from that of ordinary people. As he had said himself, after he had carefully analyzed Xia ruofei’s game, he had seen many things that ordinary fans and even coaches could not see. That was why he had made such a judgment.
