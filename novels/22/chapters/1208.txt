8?7?6?5......

In the blink of an eye, Xia ruofei had arrived at the air conditioner’s condenser in Room 503.

The rooms on this side all had a small balcony next to the air conditioner condenser. The rooms were inside the balcony.

Xia ruofei didn’t stop when he landed on the air conditioner’s condenser. He used the force to push off and threw himself sideways. Then, he rolled beautifully on the balcony to unload the force and quietly reached the balcony of Room 503.

......

In the room.

Division Chief li revealed an ambiguous smile. After closing the door, he walked over to Feng Jing and wrapped his arm around her shoulder. He said with a smile,”Boss Feng, you should have agreed to come out and talk to me face to face. A wise man submits to circumstances!”

Feng Rao dodged his lecherous hand without a trace and said without batting an eyelid,”Section Chief Li, you asked me to come and meet you, and I’m here. Can we talk about the project now?”

A trace of displeasure flashed across Division Chief Lee’s face, but he quickly put on a smile. He leaned back in his chair and said calmly,”Sure! Didn’t I ask you out today to discuss the project?”

Section Chief li could see Feng Rao’s resistance, but it was normal to him.

Feng Jing had already been reserved for many days, and the fact that she was meeting her in such a setting showed that she had already wavered.

Section Chief li wasn’t in a hurry. He had the whole night.

In fact, he enjoyed the sense of achievement of slowly breaking the psychological defense of the other party and forcing them to submit.

In other words, if Feng Jing didn’t resist this kind of thing from the start and even took the initiative to use her beauty to do things, perhaps Section Chief li wouldn’t have been so interested.

Feng Rao’s nervous heart relaxed a little. She subconsciously clutched her bag and calmed herself down before saying,””Chief li, our company is very sincere about this acquisition, and I believe that our offer will definitely satisfy the leader. As far as I know, the companies that are currently interested in the balance power building are not ...”

“Miss Feng!” Section Chief li waved his hand and interrupted Feng Jing.”I don’t care about your price at all. To be honest, no matter how much money I get from selling those few floors, what good will it do me?”

Speaking of this, Section Chief li made a meaningful look and said,””The money belongs to the country ... So, the sincerity I want to see isn’t just this!”

Feng Jing smiled and said,”Division Chief li, we know that you’re in charge of handling these assets. There must be a lot of tedious work to do. It’ll be very hard. So...After this is done, we won’t forget you. We’ll definitely express our gratitude to you.”

Section Chief li reached out to pick his ears and said with a lack of interest,””I’ve seen many empty promises. President Feng, please say something useful!”

“Section Chief li, since we’re already at this point, why don’t you state your condition?” Feng Jing raised her eyebrows.

Division Chief li raised his eyes and said,””Miss Feng, you’re a smart person. You should already know my conditions!”

“I don’t like riddles, please just tell me!” Feng Rao smiled.

Division Chief Li’s eyes flickered, but he quickly said,””First, one million in cash! Not a single cent less! “Of course, I won’t let you suffer a loss. As long as I leak some information to you, you’ll definitely save more than a million in such a big deal! It’s a win – win situation!”

Chief li was usually more cautious, but he thought Shixin hotel was the safest place, even safer than his home. Room 503 was his special room, which was usually not open to the public. The possibility of eavesdropping devices being installed here was zero.

In this kind of environment where people thought they were safe, people would subconsciously relax their minds and speak without too many scruples.

In their previous interactions, Section Chief li had hinted to Feng Jing more than once. He had even hinted to her that the amount was one million Yuan, but this was the first time he had said it so clearly.

Feng Rao was slightly happy, but she still looked at Section Chief li and said,”Since it ‘s’ first of all ‘, then ... Does Section Chief li have other conditions?”

Section Chief Li’s fiery eyes swept over Feng Jing as he said with a smile,””Miss Feng, you’re a smart person. Don’t you know what other conditions I have?”

“I’m not too sure ...”Feng Rao said.

“Since you don’t know, then I’ll just say it!” Section Chief li stood up and said,”my second and last condition is naturally you, miss Feng ...”

“What do you mean?” Feng Rao asked, gritting her teeth.

“Why are you acting dumb!” Section Chief li smiled and said,”miss Feng, it’s already so late and I’ve asked you to come to the hotel. Isn’t it obvious what I want?” I’ll put it this way! As long as you accompany me for a night, those few floors of the balance power building will definitely belong to your paradise company ...”

Even though Feng Jing was mentally prepared for this, or more accurately, she was the one who led Division Chief li to say these words, she still couldn’t help but feel a chill down her spine. Her chest heaved up and down slightly, and her heart was filled with shame and anger.
