2657 Revisiting an old place (1)

Guo Zhan was still the same as before. In lone Wolf’s territory, no one could refute his decision.

Xia ruofei had not felt this way for a long time. After he had retired and started his company, he had always been the one who kept his word. Facing the overbearing Guo Zhan, Xia ruofei did not feel uncomfortable. Instead, he felt warm in his heart. He smiled and nodded,””Alright, then we’ll stay for one night!”

“This is right!” Guo Zhan patted Xia ruofei’s shoulder and said,”I’m a little busy here. I’ll get a civil servant to accompany you around the camp. You can also go and reminisce with your old comrades. There’s no training for the past two days. Everyone is packing up.”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei nodded.

The style of a soldier was straightforward and never sloppy. Guo Zhan directly shouted,””Little Zhao! Come over here!”

“Here!” The civil servant little Zhao had just called the guest house to arrange a room when he heard Guo Zhan’s call and ran over.

Guo Zhan pointed at Xia ruofei.”Show squad leader Xia around the camp. Later, we’ll go to the canteen. Ask them to prepare a table of dishes!”

After that, Guo Zhan took out a few hundred Yuan from his pocket and gave it to Xiao Zhao. He said,”Take the money first! If it’s not enough, I’ll make up for it!”

The food expenses in the Army were fixed, and the soldiers had allocated food expenses. The officers had to hand over their food. Although Guo Zhan was the chief of this unit, he had to pay if he wanted to treat Xia ruofei to a meal in the canteen. Otherwise, he would be encroaching on the soldiers ‘interests.

In the past, when some Army leaders treated people to a meal in the canteen, they would pay for it directly from the food expenses. Everyone was used to it. Now that the military’s style had changed, even the troops under the Supreme Commander took the initiative to join forces. With such an example, naturally, no one would dare to covet such small advantages.

Of course, Guo Zhan’s style had always been extremely upright, and he would never do such a thing. As his civil servant, Xiao Zhao naturally understood his temper, so he took the money without saying anything.

“Wolf King, you can go ahead with your work!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Go! Just don’t forget to go to the cafeteria during dinner time!” Guo Zhan said, waving his hand.

Xiao Zhao accompanied Xia ruofei out of the office. When they reached the stairs, Xiao Zhao finally relaxed. It was clear how “scary” Guo Zhan was in front of these soldiers.

Xiao Zhao looked at Xia ruofei with admiration and said,””Squad leader Xia, this military camp has always been filled with your legend. Today, I finally see you in person!”

Xiao Zhao was a corporal who had joined the lone wolf commando unit after Xia ruofei had retired. Like the Sentinels at the door, many of the newcomers had already known about Xia ruofei’s past before they had joined the lone wolf commando unit. It was only after they had joined the lone wolf commando unit that they found out that the Mr. Xia, who was so popular on the internet, had retired from the lone wolf commando unit. The sense of recognition they had for him had suddenly changed.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”So, all the people I’ve seen in the past were ‘dead people’?”

“God, don’t scare me!” Xiao Zhao waved his hand and said. Didn’t I say something wrong because I was too excited? I wanted to say that I’ve finally seen him in person! Really, all the soldiers in our class regard you as their idol!”

“Your idols should be those Battle Heroes!” Xia ruofei said seriously.

“You’re also a war hero!” Little Zhao said,”although we don’t know the specific content of the 615 mission, an old squad leader sacrificed himself in the mission, and you made a second – Class merit. This is enough to prove the difficulty of the mission and the excellent role you played in the mission!”

After hearing Xiao Zhao’s words, Xia ruofei fell silent.

His thoughts were pulled back to the time when he was summoned back to perform the mission. When he was involved in this mission, the old squad leader Luo Zhicheng, who had brought him up, had already sacrificed himself. He still remembered the heartache he had felt when he saw squad leader Luo’s face in the hospital morgue.

Xiao Zhao seemed to realize that he had said the wrong thing. He looked at Xia ruofei uneasily and said in a low voice,””Class monitor Xia ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said calmly,””I’m fine ... Little Zhao, come with me to the honor room. ” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Oh ... Okay, class monitor Xia!” Little Zhao said.

The two of them walked towards the honor room. Xia ruofei was very familiar with the camp and did not need Xiao Zhao to lead the way. The two of them were silent all the way until they reached the entrance of the honor room.

“Class monitor Xia, please go in!” Said Xiao Zhao. I’ll wait at the door. ”

Xiao Zhao knew that it was not a good time to disturb Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei nodded slightly and said,”you’ve worked hard ... Didn’t the wolf King ask you to go to the cafeteria?” You can go over first, I’ll stay here for a while. ”

Little Zhao hesitated for a moment and then nodded,””Alright!”

Xia ruofei pushed the door open and entered the honor room. He found the switch by the door and turned it on.

The place was exactly the same as before. The furnishings and layout had not changed at all. Every item in the room carried the heavy honor and glorious past of this unit. Now, the name of this unit was about to disappear in the long river of history. Some of the officers and soldiers had to travel thousands of miles to change into Navy uniforms. Some even had to take off their uniforms and become ordinary people. From then on, they would bury these extraordinary years deep in their hearts. Xia ruofei looked at the pictures in front of him. The certificates and the flags made her feel emotional.
