Manager Lu could only sigh and say,””Dear leaders, today is the first day of our store’s opening, please be kind ...”

“So what if it’s the first day of business?” Tian Mingyi said sarcastically,”can we not accept any inspections and management on the first day of business? Won’t there be any violations on the first day of business?”

Manager Lu’s expression froze, and he felt very angry in his heart. However, since the boss had spoken, he had no way out. He could only play it by ear.

Inspector Wu had a cold smile on his face and said,”Manager Lu, our brothers are here. You can’t be thinking of resisting the law, right?”

“I don’t dare, I don’t dare ...” Manager Lu quickly smiled.

“Then, arrange for a few people to cooperate with the inspection!” Inspector Wu said lazily,”I’ll check the hygiene first.”

It was already past Sixo’ clock, and the customers who had booked private rooms were arriving one after another. Some of them had already gone to their private rooms and came out to check on the situation when they heard the noise, while some saw law enforcement officers in all kinds of uniforms as soon as they entered the door. Everyone couldn’t help but hesitate.

Although Ling’s private kitchen was on its first day of business, it had done a lot of publicity and promotions. In addition, with the Golden signboard of the Ling’s Dining Group and the high – end decorations of the restaurant, business was still very good. Tian Mingyi had come at the last minute and did not manage to book a private room.

Now that these customers saw a large number of law enforcement officers coming to the door, they were obviously looking for trouble. They were all wondering if this shop had offended someone.

Tian Ming Yi saw that there were many guests watching, and he felt even more proud. He said loudly,”Everyone, go back first! This shop won’t be open for business today!”

Manager Lu couldn’t hold back his anger when he heard this. You’re just the Vice – Principal of an elementary school. What right do you have to make decisions for the restaurant? The store manager didn’t even say anything, so why did you clear the place?

Manager Lu’s face slightly darkened and said,””Principal Tian, this isn’t appropriate, right? We’ll just cooperate with the leaders for inspection. These guests have booked private rooms in advance, how can we just drive them out!”

“Manager Lu, I’m just helping you to inform your customers in advance. Do you think you’ll still be open for business tonight?” Tian Mingyi sneered.

“You ...” Manager Lu clenched his fists in anger.

When inspector Wu saw this, he immediately stepped forward and said,””Manager Lu, we received a report from the public that your restaurant has serious hygiene problems, so we conducted a spot check. So, I’m officially informing you that before the results of our inspection are out, your restaurant must stop all business activities!”

“What?” Manager Lu was so angry that his lips were trembling. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

He had seen shameless people, but he had never seen someone so shameless.

Just now, it was obvious that Tian Mingyi was angry because he couldn’t get a private room, so he asked director Wu to gather a group of people to do a so – called surprise inspection. It was obviously a public office to avenge private wrongs, but now this director Wu was actually lying through his teeth, saying that there was a public report.

You’re here to eat when the public is reporting you? Furthermore, he was flustered and exasperated because he couldn’t get a private room?

“Manager Lu, do you not understand what I’m saying?” Inspector Wu’s voice turned cold.”I told you to stop all business activities immediately!”

Manager Lu felt that he was on the verge of exploding. He wanted to go up and knock these two shameless people down with a punch. At this time, the lobby manager of the restaurant, a girl in her 20s, gently pulled manager Lu’s clothes and gave him a look.

Manager Lu slowly calmed down and realized that he definitely couldn’t do anything, otherwise, he would become unreasonable. The chairman must have something to rely on. He couldn’t ruin the Chairman’s big plan.

At the thought of this, the anger in manager Lu’s eyes gradually dissipated and was replaced by a look of humiliation.

He looked deeply at Tian Mingyi and director Wu, then said to the guests,””I’m sorry, everyone. There’s an emergency today, so we can’t serve you. To express our apologies, we’ll give each guest in the private room a 500 – Yuan doorless voucher. You can come and spend at any time within the effective period.”

Manager Lu had been in this line of work for so many years, so he still had some quick – witted ideas.

When he saw the attitude of director Wu and the others, he knew that it was not a good idea to fight them head – on. Since they had made up their mind to kill them, he could only minimize the negative impact.

This kind of doorless voucher was prepared before the opening. Of course, it was originally prepared to be given to some officials in charge of the streets and districts. This was not the kind of voucher used for promotion. In other words, the 500 yuan given to the guests could be used directly as money without any additional conditions. If the guests just happened to spend 500 yuan, then the bill would be waived.

Manager Lu’s attitude was very sincere, and the manager of the store, the lobby manager, and other people began to explain to the customers one after another. Most of the customers were reasonable, and after receiving the compensation from the store, they left one after another.

Although a small number of them were a little unhappy, it was obvious that the store was in trouble. They had already said that they couldn’t open for business today, so in the end, they took the coupons and left with a face full of dissatisfaction.

Manager Lu and the other employees in the store were very angry as they watched the customers leave one by one and the waiters in charge of reservations called the customers who had not arrived one by one to explain and promised to compensate them with coupons.
