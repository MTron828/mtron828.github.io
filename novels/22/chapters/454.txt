Chapter 455: Chapter 385 – overseas returnee MBA_1

Feng Rao was driving her red BMW Z4 on provincial highway 215, entering Changping County. The city was already far behind her, and there were large patches of farmland and barren land on both sides of the road. Feng Rao’s expression became more and more depressed, and her delicate nose wrinkled slightly, as if she was dissatisfied.

Feng Jing was the professional manager that Wu Liqian had introduced to Xia ruofei. She was also Wu Liqian’s University classmate.

Feng Jing’s resume was brilliant and brilliant. She obtained an MBA from Wharton at the University of United States. After graduation, she returned to China and entered the world – famous accounting firm, pricewongatong, as a Senior Consultant. After working for a year, Feng Jing got tired of the less challenging consulting job and jumped ship to a famous internet company in the country as the Senior Vice President. She resigned two months ago and was currently unemployed.

A high – Class overseas returnee like Feng Jing was naturally highly sought after by headhunting companies. In the past two months, she had received countless offers, but she didn’t even read through them carefully, let alone interact with them. In the past two months, Feng Jing only did one thing, and that was to carry a simple bag and travel around the world, completely emptying her mind.

Feng Jing had just returned home when she received Wu Liqian’s call. She was preparing to rest for a few days before setting off for the Tibetan Plateau.

Wu Liqian told Feng Jing that a good company was currently hiring a general manager. Naturally, Feng Jing couldn’t reject her best friend from her university days like how she rejected a headhunter company, so she tried to find out more about the situation.

When Feng Jing heard Wu Liqian’s brief introduction of paradise corporation’s scale and current situation, she even thought that Wu Liqian was deliberately joking with her. No, in her opinion, this company couldn’t even be called a company. Strictly speaking, it could only be considered a workshop. At best, it was a slightly larger workshop. How could she, who was a Wharton MBA and once had a Senior Consultant Manager at pricey house, be in charge?

Was he using a butcher’s knife to kill a chicken?

Using a cannon to kill a mosquito?

It wasn’t until she confirmed it a few times that Feng Jing realized that Wu Liqian was serious.

Also, Wu Liqian had told her over the phone that although the company was small, it had amazing potential. She strongly advised her not to make a decision immediately, and it was best to observe it on the spot.

Perhaps it was out of trust for her best friend of many years, or perhaps Feng Jing was too free recently, or perhaps her brain had suddenly gone haywire, but in any case, she agreed to Wu Liqian’s ridiculous suggestion.

As the surrounding environment became more and more desolate, Feng Jing felt that the third possibility was the most likely reason why she agreed to come here.

His brain was really damaged!

However, they had already driven for more than 100 kilometers. Feng Jing’s hometown was Quangang city in the southern part of the southeast province, and she had already made an appointment with the other party. Naturally, Feng Jing couldn’t just go home at this time. Even if it was for Wu Liqian’s sake, she still had to go through the motions.

With this kind of mentality, Feng Rao arrived at Taoyuan farm with the help of the GPS.

There was not even a sign outside the farm. In fact, there had been one a few days ago. However, after Xia ruofei had gotten elder song’s name, he had asked pang Hao to find an advertising company to design a new sign. The old sign had been removed.

A security guard wearing a black suit and a headset solemnly gestured for Feng Jing to stop in front of the yellow no – Entry line.

“The security is pretty decent. It’s like a military restricted area ...” Feng Jing stopped the car and mumbled to herself.

However, this didn’t give Feng Jing any bonus points.

The security guard on duty today was Qin Xiaojun. He walked to the car and knocked on the window.

Feng Rao rolled down the car window. Qin Xiaojun asked,””Who are you looking for? What’s the matter?”

Feng Rao revealed a graceful smile and said,”I have an appointment with your director Xia today. Please inform him.”

“Are you Ms. Feng Jing?” Qin Xiaojun asked immediately.

Feng Jue nodded. Qin Xiaojun immediately replied,”Miss Feng, the chairman has already instructed that you can go in directly after you arrive. He is waiting for you in the office of the complex! I’ll arrange for a colleague to show you the way!”

“I’ll have to trouble you then. ” Feng Rao smiled.

Qin Xiaojun’s attitude made Feng Rao feel very comfortable. No matter what, Qin Xiaojun still took his presence very seriously.

However, Feng Jing thought to herself,’any small company of this size would definitely place a lot of importance on an overseas graduate from Wharton’s MBA, right?

In reality, Xia ruofei had not even looked through Feng Rao’s resume carefully. Although Wu Liqian had given him a copy, it was only out of his trust in Wu Liqian. He was only paying attention to the talent that Wu Liqian had introduced.

Qin Xiaojun contacted his comrades through the walkie – talkie, and soon, Lei Hu appeared at the entrance in an electric car.

In order to make it easier for the security guards to patrol the farm, Xia ruofei had recently purchased two of these four – seater electric vehicles. The roads inside the farm had been well planned from the beginning and could be said to be accessible in all directions. With these electric vehicles, Lei Hu and the rest could patrol without any blind spots and were very efficient.

Qin Xiaojun greeted Lei Hu before turning to Feng Rao,”Miss Feng, you can just follow the electric car in front.”

“I want to walk in,” Feng Jing said.”I’ll take a look at the farm while I’m there. Is that okay?”

Qin Xiaojun hesitated for a moment before he replied,”No problem, please park your car on the side! I’ll take good care of your car. ”
