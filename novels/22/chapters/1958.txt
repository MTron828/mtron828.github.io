1959 An old friend visits (1)

Xia ruofei laughed and waved his hand. “It’s safe here, so there’s no need for that. Besides, I’m not used to staying in the same room with so many people!”

Liu Qian also said,”director Feng, the 36th floor and above of the hotel are all sealed off. Only those who are participating in the auction can enter. Moreover, there are strong security forces arranged on the top floor. They are just standing guard outside the suite. Safety should not be a problem.”

“That’s good.” Feng Rao nodded.”I just feel that this batch of goods is too valuable. I hope nothing goes wrong ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”don’t worry about your safety.” Liu Qian, tell us about the preparation situation here!”

“Alright!” Liu Qian calmed her mind. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

She was originally just Feng Jing’s assistant. This was her first time being sent out to work and her first time taking charge of an area on her own. It was obvious that the company had the intention of nurturing her. Now that she was facing the company’s chairman, general manager, and two directors, she couldn’t help but feel a trace of invisible pressure.

Liu Qian cleared her throat and said,”director Xia, director Feng, director Dong, director pang, Hengfeng group and its auction houses have attached great importance to this auction. They have unconditionally fulfilled some of our requests. The preparations for the auction can be said to be very smooth ...”

Then, Liu Qian reported her work in Hong Kong for the past few days and said,””As of 3 p.m. Today, the auction house has received a total of 386 million Hong Kong dollars as the bid deposit. More than 200 companies and individuals have signed up for the auction. In addition, we have also invited some media reporters, so tomorrow’s auction will be held in conference hall No. 1, which can accommodate 800 people!”

Each auction allowed three people to enter. Of course, not everyone would use up their slots. In addition, with the media reporters and staff, conference hall No. 1 was definitely enough.

“Yes.” Xia ruofei nodded and asked,”have you compiled the list of companies and individuals participating in the auction?”

“I have a copy here that ends at 12 noon today!” Liu Qian quickly said.

She passed the folder with the name list to Xia ruofei and continued,””This list is updated every three hours. I got it this afternoon. I went to pick them up later and didn’t have time to get the new list.”

Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s okay. I’ll just take a look.”

Tomorrow was the day of the auction, and those who wanted to sign up must have paid the auction deposit long ago. There was no need to hide this kind of thing, and there was no need to sign up at the last time. It was completely meaningless.

There was only a difference of a few hours. Even if it was the latest list, it wouldn’t be much different from the one Liu Qian had.

Xia ruofei opened the folder and said,””Liu Qian, you’ve done well! She was quite meticulous! This month’s bonus will be doubled!”

Liu Qian was overjoyed, not because of the bonus, but because she had been recognized by the chairman, which would be a great benefit to her future development in the company, especially at this time when the company intended to cultivate her.

Xia ruofei flipped through the name list quietly. Liu Qian sat there with a surge of emotions. She couldn’t help but recall the time when she first joined the peach blossom company.

At that time, Liu Qian had hesitated for a long time when she chose to interview at a startup company far away from the city. But when she walked into Taoyuan farm, she immediately fell in love with the environment.

What left the deepest impression on Liu Qian was that she had even treated her boss, Xia ruofei, as someone who had gone through the interview with her. After joining the company for a long time, she had the urge to hide in a hole whenever she saw Xia ruofei.

In the blink of an eye, more than a year had passed. She had also grown from a young and inexperienced person who had just stepped out of the University gate to an assistant general manager of paradise Corporation. Working as a general assistant in such a company with unlimited potential meant that his future could be said to be limitless.

This was a situation that Liu Qian didn’t even dare to think about when she first joined.

She naturally cherished such an opportunity.

Xia ruofei saw many familiar names on the list, including the Hong Kong tycoons such as Guo Hongjiang and Zheng jianian that he had met before. There were also the United States King of shoes, Lophis, the Romania tycoon Nicolay, and so on. They had all attended the auction last time and had come personally this time.

In addition, Xia ruofei also saw the name of shengbang group. However, he guessed that Grandpa Tang He had sent someone to support him. He did not come to Hong Kong, or he would have contacted him long ago.

The Kyushu group’s name was also on the list. Xia ruofei did not know if Li Yifu would come in person, but according to Xia ruofei’s understanding of Li Yifu, he would most likely come.

Besides that, Xia ruofei also saw a familiar name, the black family.

At the truffle auction, George Blake from the Blake family was humiliated by Xia ruofei. In the end, old Blake personally came forward to put out the fire and even stripped George Blake of his position as the heir in exchange for Xia ruofei’s cooperation.

This time, old Blake had probably seen the best truffles on the auction list, so he couldn’t sit still and came to Hong Kong in person.

Xia ruofei read from the beginning to the end, but he did not see the name that he wanted to see. Even the Grao family that Monica belonged to was not on the list. This made Xia ruofei feel a little disappointed.
