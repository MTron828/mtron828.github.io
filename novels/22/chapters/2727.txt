“Isn’t this thing known as clairaudient? Why do we still need some ... Signal?” Luo Qingfeng asked with a frown.

“I’ve heard from martial nephew Boshan before. To communicate through mobile phones, we need to rely on some ... Base station. There’s no one living on this Island, so they definitely wouldn’t build that kind of base station!” Zheng Yongshou nodded.

“The things in the secular world are convenient sometimes,” Luo Qingfeng said.”But they’re a little too troublesome!” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Although Zheng Yongshou did not travel much in the secular world, he had left the sect three times for the Peach Blossom Island. Especially this time, he had stayed in the secular world for quite a long time and went to many places, so he was naturally more knowledgeable than Luo Qingfeng.

In particular, Zheng Yongshou was even more familiar with the route to Peach Blossom Island.

He thought for a moment and said,”master, if we take a plane to Peach Blossom Island, the nearest airport should be in Ye City of Nanhai province. Why don’t we go directly to Ye City?” You’ll definitely be able to make a phone call there!”

Qingfeng Luo had spent most of his life in the South Sea. Although Ye City was very close to the mainland, he had been there a few times.

So, after hearing Zheng Yongshou’s words, Luo Qingfeng calculated in silence and said,””Mm! Ye City wasn’t too far away. If they flew at full speed, they would reach it in less than an hour! Then let’s do this! Yongshou, we’ve had enough rest, let’s continue our journey!”

When Zheng Yongshou heard that it would take another hour or so, he immediately regretted making that suggestion. The feeling of Wanwan was too exciting, he couldn’t take it!

Zheng Yongshou felt that his mouth was really cheap, even if it was just a suggestion to find a small island with people living nearby, it would also be fine! There would be cell phone signal there, and they could also take a boat to Ye City, right?

However, he did not have time to react at all. Soon, he was swept up by Luo Qingfeng and soared into the sky. The whistling sound of the wind rang in his ears again. In an instant, he was hit by the strong wind and burst into tears. He quickly closed his eyes.

After more than 40 minutes, Qingfeng Luo and Zheng Yongshou landed on a deserted beach in Ye City.

Even with Luo Qingfeng’s profound cultivation, after 40 to 50 minutes of flying, he still felt that his dantian was a little empty. Flying on a sword consumed too much true Qi, especially when he was flying with another person.

Qingfeng Luo had also considered that after flying to Ye City, he would no longer need to continue flying on his sword. His true energy could also slowly recover naturally. If he had to consume crystals to replenish his true energy, he would rather die than do so.

After flying for such a long time, Zheng Yongshou really wanted to die. As soon as he landed, without the support of Luo Qingfeng’s true energy, he immediately fell to the ground, his legs unable to exert any strength.

It took a while for Zheng Yongshou to recover. He looked at Luo Qingfeng and said,””Master, this disciple’s cultivation is too low. It’s too embarrassing ...”

Luo Qingfeng was also sitting cross – legged to recover his vital energy. He waved his hand and said,””You’ve recovered? Then, he would call Bo Shan! Tell him to arrange our schedule as soon as possible!”

“Yes! Master!” Zheng Yongshou quickly said.

He took out his phone from his pocket. This phone was given to him by Wang Boshan, and he only knew how to use some simple functions.

Zheng Yongshou found Wang Boshan’s number and dialed it.

On the Paradise Island, Wang Boshan was waiting for a call from Zheng Yongshou. As soon as his phone rang, he immediately picked it up and turned on the speaker. At the same time, he gestured to Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei immediately walked over.

As soon as the phone was connected, Zheng Yongshou directly said,””Bo Shan, the head Master has decided to bring me to the Peach Blossom Island. You must be prepared to receive me!”

Wang Boshan revealed a trace of joy. He knew that the first step of Xia ruofei’s plan should have succeeded. He quickly said,””Alright! Junior uncle Zheng!”

“The most important thing now is to book air tickets and arrange our itinerary for sect leader, master, and me,” Zheng Yongshou continued. We’re going to take a plane from Ye city’s Meilan Airport, can you help us book the tickets now?”

“I understand! Don’t worry, martial uncle Zheng, I’ll get it done right away!” Wang Boshan quickly said.

Zheng Yongshou thought of his experience of sword Kinesis flight, and his heart moved slightly. He deliberately said with a trace of pride,””Boshan, the head, master and I are already in Ye City, so you can book the earliest flight! Do you know why we were so fast? Hahaha! We came here on our flying swords, and the sect leader took me directly from Star Island to Ye City. You haven’t experienced this feeling before, have you?”

Qingfeng Luo did not suspect anything. He just felt that it was both funny and infuriating that Jian Jia, who had been so scared that her face turned pale, was so close to live broadcasting her ‘sword vertigo’ in the air. She had just recovered and was already bragging in front of the younger generation of her sect.

However, Qingfeng Luo was very satisfied with Zheng Yongshou today. Even though Zheng Yongshou’s performance was a little exaggerated, Qingfeng Luo did not blame him at all. Instead, he felt that Zheng Yongshou was still a child. This was the performance of an honest person! No wonder he was so loyal to the sect.

Qingfeng Luo laughed and scolded,”Yongshou, stop bragging to Boshan!” Tell him to quickly book that ... Plane ticket!”

Zheng Yongshou had already conveyed all the information he wanted to convey, and it was all in clear language, not even code words were needed.
