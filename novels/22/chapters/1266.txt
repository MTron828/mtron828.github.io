“Mister Guo!” The vet exclaimed in disbelief.

Guo Hongjiang waved his hand and stopped the vet from speaking further. He said indifferently,””I’ve already decided. You don’t have to say anything more!”

The vet could only helplessly hand over the syringe that he had prepared earlier to the assistant and then glared at Xia ruofei in dissatisfaction.

In his eyes, Xia ruofei was just messing around. In the end, he would only increase the “star of Hong Kong” ‘s pain.

He really could not understand why Guo Hongjiang would agree to such a ridiculous thing.

Xia ruofei did not care about the dissatisfied looks from the veterinarian and the other team members. He smiled faintly and said to Guo Hongjiang,””Director Guo, my treatment method is a bit special. I hope that we can have a relatively quiet environment. Also, we need a few more Chinese medicines. Please send someone to prepare them as soon as possible. ”

Although Guo Hongjiang still did not believe that Xia ruofei could save the “star of Hong Kong”, he would give his full support since he had agreed to let Xia ruofei try.

Therefore, Guo Hongjiang said without hesitation,””No problem! Mr. Xia, please write down the herbs you need. I’ll get someone to prepare them immediately!”

“Sure!” Xia ruofei nodded.

Since Guo Hongjiang had spoken, someone quickly found a pen and paper and handed it to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei did not hesitate. He picked up his pen and wrote down the names and quantities of at least 50 medicinal herbs on the paper.

These were all medicinal herbs for treating injuries from falls, and their purpose was naturally to deceive people.

Xia ruofei handed the list of herbs to Guo Hongjiang and said,””In addition to buying the medicine, we also need to buy a clay pot to boil the medicine. In addition, prepare some charcoal, gauze, tape, and other things for bandaging.”

“No problem!” Guo Hongjiang handed the list of herbs to the veterinarian and motioned for him to prepare the herbs immediately. Then, he asked,”Mr. Xia, do you need any equipment such as a splint?”

“No need for now!” Xia ruofei said,”let’s talk if you need it.”

The staff rushed out to buy the herbs while Xia ruofei walked to the “star of Hong Kong”.

The fractured back leg seemed to swell even more. The “star of Hong Kong” was getting more and more anxious and kept struggling.

Although the staff was very experienced and tied its four hooves to a special frame, they could not completely restrict its hind legs. Under a series of movements, the pain would definitely increase.

The ropes used to tie the horses up were stained with blood, and the horses were also covered in wounds.

He had only been tied up for a little more than ten minutes, and he was already covered in wounds. It could be imagined that it would take at least three months to fully recover with traditional treatment methods, so it was simply an impossible task.

Guo Hongjiang saw that the “star of Hong Kong” was in great pain every minute and his heart couldn’t help but waver.

He felt that he might have gone crazy. How could there be any other way in this situation?

He should have been more determined! Guo Hongjiang said in his heart.

In such a situation, every second that he lived was torture for the “star of Hong Kong”. It was better to just put him down with a needle. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

However, since he had already promised Xia ruofei, Guo Hongjiang would not go back on his word.

Just as Guo Hongjiang was feeling conflicted, Xia ruofei had already walked to the front of the “star of Hong Kong”.

He gently patted the head of the anxious and pained “star of Hong Kong”, and then seemed to causally rub its head for a while.

Then, to Guo Hongjiang and MA Xiong’s surprise, the “star of Hong Kong” seemed to calm down immediately. He even squinted his eyes slightly. His gentle look made them feel like they were dreaming ...
