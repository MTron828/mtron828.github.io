Chapter 488: Chapter 397 – unexpected change (1)

Liang Haiming was not in a hurry to leave. He and the middle – aged man next to him watched the last container truck leave the dock and head for the neighboring province, Gannan. It was as if they could see a large amount of Chinese yuan flying towards them.

Gannan province was the Liang family’s traditional sphere of influence. Old master Liang’s hometown was in Gannan province. Many of the current provincial leaders were promoted by old master Liang. These “car parts” would not have any problems when they reached Gannan province. They could be assembled into cars very quickly and be exchanged for a lot of money.

If it weren’t for the fact that Gannan was an inland province, Liang Haiming would definitely not have put so much effort into managing the southeast province.

Liang Haiming turned around and walked toward his Mercedes – Benz. The middle – aged man followed him.

Liang Haiming asked without turning his head,””Did you keep a close eye on him?”

He didn’t say who it was, but the middle – aged man naturally knew who he was referring to. He immediately replied,””Don’t worry, young Liang. Heibao is personally watching over him with his men!”

Liang Haiming nodded and said,””Call Heibao, do it!”

“Now?” the middle – aged man was stunned.

He subconsciously felt that something was wrong. Liang Haiming looked extremely crazy. Besides, this batch of goods had just been cleared through customs and were still in the southeast province! It would take at least five or six hours to pass through the southeast province and enter Gannan province. If anything happened during this time, who knew what impact it would have on the goods?

Liang Haiming’s expression turned cold. He turned to look at the middle – aged man and asked,””Is there a problem?”

Liang Haiming’s eyes were so cold that the middle – aged man couldn’t help but shiver. He quickly said,””No, no... Young master Liang, I’ll inform Heibao immediately!”

“One hour, I want to see that girl on my bed!” Liang Haiming said.

Then, he got into the Mercedes – Benz that the bodyguards had already opened the door for him and left.

The middle – aged man stood there with a bitter smile on his face, and helplessly took out his phone to contact Heibao.

“Heibao, young master Liang ordered you to attack now. He wants to see that woman within an hour.” The middle – aged man said,”after you succeed, send her directly to the green Bull Mountain Resort.”

The qingniu Mountain Resort was located in qingniu County, a suburban County under Sanshan city. Liang Haiming had booked a small villa in this resort for a long time. After all, many things were inconvenient to do in the hotel suite in the city center, but there were no such concerns in the suburbs resort during the off – season.

After hanging up the phone, the middle – aged man’s face showed a hint of worry. He felt that Liang Haiming’s actions this time were too aggressive, and it even gave him an inexplicable sense of crisis.

However, he was just a person arranged by the family to take care of Liang Haiming’s specific Affairs. He had little say in the family. As the grandson of the Liang family’s old master, Liang Haiming did not listen to any of his suggestions at all and had always done things his own way.

The middle – aged man smiled bitterly and shook his head. He also got on the car and left the dock area.

……

San Shan city, Nantai District, Ling Ji food and beverage headquarters.

Ling Qingxue walked out of the building with an exquisite LOEWE handbag slung over her shoulder.

She had obviously dressed up well today.

She was dressed in a long, light pink down jacket, paired with a pair of black slim – cut jeans. Her long, beautiful legs set off her tall and slender figure. She even combed her hair into a cute bun. She had exquisite light makeup on her face, giving people a sense of amazement.

There was a faint smile on Ling Qingxue’s face because she was going to see Xia ruofei soon. Although the two of them met every few days and would even go to the hotel to have sex if they had enough time, she was still looking forward to every opportunity for them to spend time together.

When she did not see Xia ruofei, Ling Qingxue took out her phone from her LOEWE bag and dialed Xia ruofei’s number.

Xia ruofei had already reached the Nantai District. He stopped the car and waited for the traffic light to turn green. There was a straight road in front of him. He could already see the Ling Ji food and beverage headquarters in the distance. He was about 200 meters away from his destination.

When the phone rang, Xia ruofei, who had better eyesight than ordinary people, had already vaguely seen Ling Qingxue’s figure standing in front of the building.

He picked up the phone with a smile and said,””Qingxue, I’m so sorry! I was delayed by something at the farm. I’ll be there soon. I’m waiting for the traffic light and I saw you ...”

“Oh ... Okay, drive slowly, I’m not in a hurry ...” Ling Qingxue said considerately.

The red light at this intersection did not last long, so when Xia ruofei parked, he switched to second gear and stepped on the clutch and brake. There was a smile on his face. He was about to meet his beautiful girlfriend, and his practice of the core runes of the spiritual puppet was progressing very quickly, so he was in a very good mood.

“Don’t worry, my driving skills ...”

Xia ruofei’s expression suddenly changed when he was halfway through his sentence. Something was happening at the entrance of the Ling Ji F & B headquarters 200 meters in front of him!

A Black Multi – Purpose vehicle suddenly sped out from the side of the street and stopped right beside Ling Qingxue. Two burly Men in Black jumped out of the car and grabbed Ling Qingxue’s delicate arms, one on each side. Without a word, they pushed her into the car.

Ling Qingxue’s panicked screams came from Xia ruofei’s Bluetooth Earphone, followed by a few muffled sounds. It was obvious that her phone had fallen to the ground.

At this moment, the red light in front of them was counting down to the last ten seconds.

Xia ruofei did not hesitate. He lifted the clutch and stepped on the gas in one go. The pickup truck’s tires screeched sharply and it sped away from where it was. It barely avoided the cars on both sides that were rushing through the intersection. Under the curses of the drivers, it rushed in the direction of the Ling’s food and beverage headquarters.

At the same time, the automatic cameras at the intersection flashed and recorded Xia ruofei’s behavior of running the red light.

Of course, Xia ruofei did not care about this. His eyes were bloodshot and his teeth were clenched. He stared at the black Multi – Purpose vehicle that was more than a hundred meters away.

The man in the van was obviously an experienced man. It only took him a few seconds to kidnap her, get into the car, and drive off.

When Xia ruofei drove the pickup across the intersection, the black Multi – Purpose vehicle also started to move quickly.

It was past six in the evening, and the traffic on the street was heavy. Xia ruofei drove the pickup truck nimbly through the traffic during the peak hour and chased after the black business car.

A distance of more than a hundred meters could be covered in a blink of an eye under normal circumstances. However, during the evening peak hour, there were dozens of cars in between. It was difficult to overtake each car. Xia ruofei could only rely on his superb driving skills and clench his teeth to catch up.

In the beginning, the black MPV didn’t notice the pickup truck 100 meters away, so they didn’t run away at high speed. In fact, it wasn’t easy to drive at high speed in the evening peak traffic. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

This gave Xia ruofei a chance to catch up.

His car seemed to have gone crazy. There were a few times when it almost scraped against other cars, causing other drivers on the road to honk unhappily. There were even Road Fury who chased after Xia ruofei, unwilling to be outdone. However, how could these ordinary drivers catch up with Xia ruofei, who had undergone special driving training? soon, they were left behind and could only curse in dissatisfaction.

Xia ruofei looked at the approaching black car and kept reminding himself to stay calm.

Ling Qingxue could only be saved if he handled the situation calmly. If he lost his cool now, there would be no hope left.

He didn’t know the reason why those people kidnapped Ling Qingxue, but he could already guess that the person in the black car and the person who wanted to deal with him yesterday were the same person behind the scenes.

If his guess was correct, then he couldn’t let his guard down. A kidnapping like this could be for money, but if it was ordered by the person hiding in the dark, then Ling Qingxue would be in danger.

The person hiding in the dark definitely had an irreconcilable hatred for him. Moreover, Ling Qingxue was a beautiful woman. The other party’s motive for deliberately sending people to capture Ling Qingxue was self – evident.

Xia ruofei felt a little regretful and guilty. After he was followed by Zhao he, his first thought was the safety of the farm, Feng Rao, and the others. He did not expect the other party to be so shameless and unscrupulous as to change the target to Ling Qingxue. If something happened to Ling Qingxue because of him and because he did not warn her in time and protect her, he would never be able to forgive himself.

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei’s heart was burning with anxiety. He forced himself to remain calm and kept stepping on the clutch, gear, accelerator, brake, and steering. He controlled the car to accelerate and decelerate at times. The pickup truck was like an agile Loach as it weaved through the traffic and gradually approached the black business car.

However, just as Xia ruofei’s car was about ten meters away from the black MPV, with two cars in between, the MPV suddenly accelerated.

It was obvious that the other party had finally felt that something was wrong.

Xia ruofei gritted his teeth. The pickup truck made a dull roar and followed closely behind the commercial vehicle. The two cars began to chase each other in the evening peak traffic ...

In the middle row of the black business car, Ling Qingxue was sitting in the middle. Her head was tilted and she was leaning against the seat softly. Her eyes were closed. Although she was already unconscious, her face still had a panicked expression, which made people feel pity for her.

Two burly Men in Black sat on either side of Ling Qingxue.

In addition to the driver, there was a bald man in the front passenger seat. He had a long scar at the corner of his eye, and his eyes shot out a fierce light, looking very ferocious and terrifying.

The driver of the business car was a thin man. He also had a crazed look on his face. This kind of pursuit at lightning speed and dangerous situation in the traffic made him feel very excited. At first glance, he also looked like a fugitive.

The bald man in the front passenger seat looked indifferently at the pickup truck that was crazily chasing after them from the rearview mirror and said indifferently,””Monkey, change our course! Take the nearest road out of the city!”
