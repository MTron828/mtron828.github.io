2255 Returning the favor (1)

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you’re too late. I really have something on tonight.” He had already agreed to someone else’s request ... Wait! Why don’t you guys come over together tonight? You will go with the Li family’s fourth brother. ”

“What’s your game tonight?” Song Rui asked,”is it convenient for us to go over?”

“There’s nothing inconvenient about it. It’s just that xiangnan TV’s director Gao is treating me to a meal. I even dragged Hou Liang along to accompany him!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”if you don’t mind, you can bring li Xiaosi along!”

Song Rui laughed and scolded,”you’re just lazy!” You don’t want to entertain too many people, so you decided to get together, right?”

“Where did all this nonsense come from?” Xia ruofei laughed and scolded him. Then, he asked,”just tell me if you’re coming or not!”

“Come!” Song Rui said without hesitation,”why can’t I go if someone is treating me? It’s settled then! Where’s the place tonight?”

In fact, song Rui was doing this for Xia ruofei’s sake. Otherwise, there would be a long line of people waiting to treat him to a meal on Chang ‘an Street. He would not be interested in ordinary people’s meals. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

In fact, Xia ruofei was just returning the favor. Xiangnan TV and Gao Jun had done a good job in promoting paradise Corporation this time. He believed that the effect would be obvious after the show was broadcast. Therefore, he was trying to pull some connections for Gao Jun. Although Gao Jun had been in contact with Hou Liang and even song Rui, the significance of this dinner was different. Although Gao Jun could not get on song Rui’s good side just because of one dinner, the relationship between both parties would be much closer. This was undoubtedly Gao Jun’s dream.

“The Wang family’s private kitchen, ya Qing’s private room. You can go there by yourself. The time is 6:30!” Xia ruofei said.

“Alright! I’ll give Li Xiao si a call, that guy has long wanted to get to know you. ” Song Rui smiled and said,”but don’t take him too seriously. The Li family is not as good as they used to be. Otherwise, li Xiaosi wouldn’t be selling imported cars all the time.”

In the eyes of a top rich man like song Rui, the job of selling imported cars was obviously a bit degrading.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”alright!” I know what I’m doing. ”

He was not that utilitarian when making friends. As long as their personalities and tempers were compatible, he did not care about the other party’s status or the prosperity of their family. If they didn’t get along, he wouldn’t even look at someone from the second or third generation like song Rui.

As his cultivation continued to improve, Xia ruofei’s mentality had gradually changed. Secular power and status could no longer cause any waves in his heart.

Sometimes, he even wondered what kind of state the mayfly’s evolution would reach in the end – And would the life forms that had evolved to a higher level still be considered the same as ordinary humans? In a sense, it was already a different species, right?

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei went to his bedroom to take a nap. He got up at around fouro’ clock and washed up. He changed into casual clothes and went to the living room to find some tea leaves to make tea.

It was a little past FiveO’ clock when Qin Yanan knocked on his door, telling him that it was almost time to leave.

At FiveO’ clock, the traffic in Beijing had already started to get heavy. If they didn’t set off earlier, they would probably be stuck on the road.

Xia ruofei picked up a bag of tea that he had prepared after waking up and walked out of the room.

This was the gift he had prepared for Gao Jun. After all, he was treating Gao Jun to a meal, so it wasn’t good to come empty – handed. This bag of tea was naturally the peach garden’s Da Hong Pao, but it was not the mass – produced version sold in the official flagship store of Peach Garden. Instead, it was produced by the tea trees in the spirit map space and personally fried by Xia Qing. The quality was naturally much better than the Da Hong Pao sold on the market.

In terms of taste alone, the Da Hong Pao in the space was not inferior to the famous mother tree, Da Hong Pao. Although the tea leaves in the space were bred from the branches of the mother tree, Da Hong Pao, and belonged to the second generation of tea trees, the spirit map space’s unique environment and rich spirit Qi made the tea trees in the space even better than the mother tree of the nine Dragons carriage, Da Hong Pao.

However, the value of tea leaves could never be determined by the taste alone. The five parent trees, Da Hong Pao, were the ancestors of all Da Hong Pao tea leaves. Moreover, with the accumulation of history, these were all intangible values.

But no matter what, this gift was definitely not light, and it was also something that money couldn’t buy.

Xia ruofei saw Qin Yanan and he Yu standing outside the door.

“President Xia, the car is ready,” Qin Yanan said.

“Then let’s go!” Xia ruofei nodded.

When they arrived at the backyard, Wu Qiang had already started the Land Rover and was waiting. He Yu sat in the front passenger seat, while Xia ruofei and Qin Yanan naturally sat in the back seats.

This made Xia ruofei determined to buy an MPV as soon as possible. The Land Rover was good for family use, but it would not be suitable for business activities.

Wu Qiang calmly drove the car on the road that was gradually becoming congested while Xia ruofei leaned back in his seat and closed his eyes to rest.

There were indeed a lot of cars in Beijing, and with the peak traffic after work, the traffic on the road was getting more and more serious. The distance from the courtyard in liuhai Lane to the Wang family’s private kitchen was not too far, but the car finally arrived at around 6:20. It took a full hour to get there.

Xia ruofei waited in the car for Wu Qiang to Park before getting off with Qin Yanan and he Yu. He also called Wu Qiang over to take a look at how they had come out earlier today. Wu Qiang had not had dinner yet.
