2596 Everything is under control_1

Xia ruofei had expected Liu Qunfeng’s reaction.

To be more precise, when Xia ruofei confirmed that Liu Lifang was the one who had caused the whole incident, he had already thought of how to deal with her.

In this matter, he had the absolute initiative. The key to the problem was how to grasp this scale.

But before that, he had to lay the foundation.

After hearing Liu Qunfeng’s words, Xia ruofei did not reject his proposal as Liu Qunfeng had worried.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””If the Liu family can help us find the herbs, that would be the best.”

Liu Qunfeng was stunned, unable to believe his ears.

He had thought that Xia ruofei would reject his suggestion and did not have much hope. He did not expect Xia ruofei to agree so easily. This was really beyond his expectations.

Liu Qunfeng quickly said,””Thank you, Mr. Xia! Thank you, Mr. Xia!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Don’t thank me so quickly. The herbs needed to make these pills are extremely rare. You can’t find them just because you have money or power ... Chief Liu, please prepare a pen and paper for me!”

“Alright! Alright!” Liu Qunfeng quickly turned to Liu Liru and said,”Liru! Quickly get a pen and paper!”

“Oh!” Liu Liru came back to her senses and quickly walked out of the room.

After a while, she came in with a stack of A4 paper and a pen. She handed the paper and pen to Xia ruofei respectfully.

Xia ruofei didn’t beat around the bush. He sat down and wrote down a dozen medicinal herbs. Then, he handed them to Liu Qunfeng and said,””Chief Liu, these herbs are necessary for making pills. If the Liu family can find them, the more the better!”

Liu Qunfeng didn’t agree with Xia ruofei’s words. He thought that Xia ruofei would definitely add some irrelevant and precious herbs to the list to protect the prescription. At least, it would be able to confuse people.

What he did not expect was that none of the medicinal herbs had anything to do with making pills. In fact, every medicinal herb was used to confuse people.

Of course, Liu Qunfeng didn’t show it. Instead, he acted like he was convinced. He took the list from Xia ruofei with both hands and said sincerely,””We’ll do our best to find it and try to get ...”

Liu Qunfeng stopped in the middle of his sentence. He stared at the list that Xia ruofei had written. He was dumbfounded. He knew every word on the list, but when put together, they were names of herbs that he had never even heard of.

Although Liu Qunfeng wasn’t a professional Chinese medicine practitioner, as the eldest son of a rich family, he had received a traditional education since he was a child. He knew the names of many Chinese medicinal herbs. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

However, after looking at Xia ruofei’s list, he couldn’t even recognize a single herb. Furthermore, the names of these herbs were obviously very precious and rare.

Liu Qunfeng looked at the names of the herbs on the list, such as heart condensing grass, purple crystal blood vine, and green spirit fruit, and couldn’t help but feel a headache.

Xia ruofei had not scribbled. Every medicinal herb he had written, including the heart condensing grass, were actually spiritual herbs that could only be used in the cultivation world. A portion of them were spiritual herbs that could be grown in the heart Island medicinal garden in the mountain sea realm, but they had not ripened yet. There were some that even Xia ruofei did not have. He had only read about them in some ancient books. Even in the world of cultivation, these herbs were extremely precious.

If the Liu family could really find three or five of the spirit herbs on the list, then what harm was there in treating old man Liu again for free? It was just a few petals of the spirit Heart Flower. Xia ruofei’s current stock of spirit Heart Flower petals was quite sufficient.

Of course, under such a tight time, it was almost impossible to find any of the medicinal herbs on the list.

Then, Xia ruofei could naturally state his conditions. The huge Liu family had tried so hard but could not find even a single medicinal herb. The value of this pill was evident. If they wanted Xia ruofei to save old master Liu’s life, the Liu family would have to pay the corresponding price.

Although Xia ruofei could demand an exorbitant price now, he did not choose such a violent method. Not only did he want the Liu family to give him enough benefits, but he also wanted them to be convinced and even grateful. This was the goal that Xia ruofei wanted to achieve.

Liu Qunfeng looked at the list again and confirmed that he didn’t recognize a single herb. He couldn’t help but smile bitterly to himself. Now, this list had become a hot potato.

Of course, he could not rule out the possibility that he did not have enough knowledge of Chinese medicine. After all, he did not graduate from a professional Chinese medicine course. In the traditional education he received back then, most of the topics related to Chinese medicine were memory songs and riddles about Chinese medicinal herbs. It was very likely that there were knowledge gaps.

Liu Qunfeng could only hope that he was lucky. He handed the list to Liu Chongli and said solemnly,””Uncle Chongli, I’ll leave this matter to you. You must mobilize the entire clan’s power to find the medicinal herbs on this list!”

Liu Chongli was mainly in charge of the Liu family’s family business. The branch company could be said to be spread all over the country, even abroad. So, if you wanted to get these medicinal herbs, you must find them all over the country and even the world through the family business.
