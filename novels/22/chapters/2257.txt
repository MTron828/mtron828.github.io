2258 Toasts (2)

Gao Jun’s only weakness was that he came from an average family background. He had graduated from the capital Broadcasting college, which was now the media College. From an a – list host to the second – in – command of the station, he had taken it one step at a time. Every improvement was made through solid performance. But after reaching his position, if he wanted to carry out greater ambitions, he did not just need to work hard. He also needed help and opportunities from all sides.

If he could “report” to Hou Liang’s father this time, it would be equivalent to having a powerful assistant at the headquarters “level. Thus, he was naturally very concerned.

In comparison, although song Rui’s family was obviously much stronger than Hou Liang ‘s, Gao Jun was not so eager to befriend them. After all, he was far from being able to reach the song family’s status. It might not be a good thing for him to be overly attached to them.

Gao Jun and Hou Liang were chatting happily while Li Zhe took the initiative to talk to Xia ruofei. It was obvious that he wanted to make friends.

Li Zhe walked to Xia ruofei with a glass of wine and said with a smile,””Brother Xia, let’s have another drink! I’ve long heard of your great name, but I’ve never had the chance to get to know you! Thanks to brother Rui, we finally have this opportunity!”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”Xiao si, you’re too polite!” Speaking of which ... I should thank you properly for buying the car!”

“Hey! It’s a small matter!” Li Zhe waved his hand nonchalantly and said,”brother Xia, getting a few imported cars is no problem for me! Please don’t take it to heart ... If it wasn’t for brother Rui saying that you definitely wouldn’t agree, I would have given that car to you directly!” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“That won’t do!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I can’t ask you to help me and pay for it at the same time! That didn’t make sense. You don’t have to give me a discount. To be honest, I don’t lack money. You’ve already helped me a lot by letting me get the car so quickly!”

“Alright! You’re a rich man, so I won’t be pretentious!” Li Zhe smiled and said,”come, I’ll drink first!”

After he finished speaking, Li Zhe raised his cup and drank it. Then, he showed the bottom of the cup to Xia ruofei.

This was a tael of white wine. Tonight, he had used Drunken Eight Immortals at 53% alcohol. After drinking this tael of wine in one gulp, Li Zhe felt that he had drunk a little too much. He quickly reached for the glass and took another big gulp to suppress the alcohol.

Xia ruofei also downed his drink. Compared to Li Zhe’s sorry state, he seemed to be very calm, as if he had just drunk plain water.

Li Zhe couldn’t help but give Xia ruofei a thumbs up and said,””I’ve long heard that brother Xia can’t get drunk even after a thousand glasses. I’ve finally seen it for myself today!”

“There’s no one who can’t get drunk after a thousand cups!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’m just a little better at drinking than the average person. It’s not as exaggerated as you say! Little four, don’t drink too much, it’s bad for the liver!”

“I know, brother Xia!” Li Zhe grinned and said,”there aren’t many people who can make me toast to them like this. It’s fine to drink once or twice occasionally!”

Then, Li Zhe said to Xia ruofei,””Brother Xia, the car will be here in a few days. Do you want to pick a good license plate first?”

Li Zhe specialized in the imported car business, and most of the buyers were rich and powerful people like song Rui. Naturally, it was a one – stop service. Therefore, he must have made connections with a unit like the vehicle Administration.

Before Xia ruofei could say anything, song Rui stood up and said,””Little four, are you done yet? Why did he have to chat with RUO Fei? I haven’t even had a drink with RUO Fei!”

“Yo!” Li Zhe quickly said. Brother Rui, I was just talking to brother Xia about the license plate. The Elfa will be arriving at the port soon. I want to ask brother Xia if you have any license plates you want so that you can prepare in advance!”

“That’s it!”Song Rui said. Just do as you see fit ... Pick a lucky number for RUO Fei, or 6666,8888, or something of the same number. Don’t get those special numbers. ”

Then, song Rui smiled at Xia ruofei and said,””RUO Fei, do you agree with what I said?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Xiao Rui knows me best!” Xiao si, let’s do as your brother Rui says! Actually, I don’t have any requirements for the license plate number. If it really doesn’t work out, I can just choose one of the normal ones. ”

“No, no, no!” Li Zhe quickly said. Isn’t that a slap to my face? Brother Rui’s request isn’t difficult at all, I’ll definitely get it done properly!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.”Alright then. Thank you for your hard work!”

“It’s not hard! It’s not hard!” Li Zhe said,”then, brother Xia, you can talk to brother Rui! I won’t disturb you any longer ...”

Then, he filled Xia ruofei’s glass with wine and returned to his seat.

Song Rui then took his glass and clinked it with Xia ruofei ‘S. He said,””Let’s have a toast as brothers!”

“How about ... A bigger cup?” Xia ruofei said half – jokingly.

Song Rui immediately replied,”don’t even think about it!” Xia ruofei, whoever drinks with you in the future is your grandson! Just use a small cup, you can drink it if you want!”

Every time song Rui drank with Xia ruofei, he would be so drunk that he was unconscious. The most annoying thing was that Xia ruofei was fine no matter how much he drank. Such an abnormal drinking capacity had already made song Rui and the others despair. They could not even have the thought of competing with Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”a small cup it is!” Come on! A toast to you!”

After that, Xia ruofei clinked his glass with song Rui’s and finished the whole glass of white wine in one gulp.

Song Rui had no problem with such a small glass, so he naturally wouldn’t back down and drank the wine in the glass.

Then, song Rui put down his glass and said,””Let’s go out for a chat?”

Xia ruofei looked at song Rui and nodded.””Alright! It’s good to go out and get some fresh air ...”

After that, he whispered to Gao Jun beside him and walked towards the door of the private room. Song Rui quickly followed.

The Wang family’s private kitchen was reconstructed on the basis of a siheyuan. After the private room was a large courtyard. The layout of the courtyard was well – arranged and there were many secluded places.

Xia ruofei and song Rui found an empty corner and sat down on the stone chairs.

Xia ruofei took out a box of cigarettes and passed one to song Rui. Then, he took one for himself and put it in his mouth.

He turned on the Zippo lighter for himself and handed it to song Rui without turning it off.

Song Rui took the lighter and lit the cigarette. Then, he closed the lighter and played with it in his hand as he said,””Li Xiaosi has been trying to get a share of our club’s business, he’s been trying to stall me for days ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”no wonder he’s so attentive!” What are your considerations?”

“We have the same opinion. We don’t want to recruit new shareholders for the time being.” Song Rui said,”anyway, we have plenty of funds. Although li Xiaosi’s character is not bad, his strength is a little lacking.”

The strength that song Rui was talking about was not in terms of financial strength. In terms of money, Li Zhe, who was in the imported car business, was probably much richer than people like song Rui and Hou Liang. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been in such a hurry to invest in the peach blossom Association and Exchange it for Hou Liang and the others. He couldn’t even afford this capital.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded,”you can decide on your own. I won’t interfere.” Even if you want to pull in a few people to work together, as long as you think they are trustworthy, I will agree. ”

Song Rui nodded and said,”let’s do that for now.” Let’s see this guy’s performance! Anyway, I think so! “Even if we want to absorb new shareholders, we’ll have to wait until our paradise society officially opens and makes a name for ourselves. At that time, the value of each share will definitely not be the same as now. Only in this way can we show the advantage of being the original shareholders!”

“You’re still very clear – headed!” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”you called me out just to talk about this, right?”
