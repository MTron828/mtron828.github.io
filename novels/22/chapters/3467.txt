Chapter 3468: The big clearance gift bag (2)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei was shocked and instinctively backed away.

At this time, he immediately felt that after the stream of light entered his sea of consciousness, it was directly transformed into a large amount of information and filled his mind.

Xia ruofei was no stranger to this process. It was similar to the time when he absorbed the three Jade talismans from the heaven, earth, and human.

This was just the beginning. When Xia ruofei touched a book, it was as if a valve had been opened. Suddenly, all the secretaries in the room turned into streams of light and shot in Xia ruofei’s direction as if they had eyes.

In an instant, the entire ninth level of the trial Pagoda was covered in this light. The bright light filled the sky and Xia ruofei could not help but close his eyes. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

It wasn’t that he didn’t want to avoid them. On one hand, he had already realized that these books contained inheritance information and wouldn’t harm him. On the other hand, and more importantly, there were too many streams of light. The room was so small that it could be said that there was no way to avoid them.

Under such circumstances, Xia ruofei decided not to Dodge. He stood where he was, ready to withstand the impact of the huge information flow.

Rays of light pierced into Xia ruofei’s forehead. It looked as if his head had been pierced by thousands of swords.

In fact, Xia ruofei was not feeling good either. In a short period of time, a huge amount of information had been flooding into his mind. Any normal person would feel uncomfortable. Furthermore, there was a huge amount of information in the four walls of books. Fortunately, Xia ruofei’s spiritual power had already reached the spiritualization realm and his sea of consciousness had also stabilized. It was naturally different from when he had absorbed the Jade talisman of inheritance.

Hence, even though Xia ruofei felt like his head was about to burst, it was just an unbearable headache. There was no danger.

The process did not take long. It only took two to three minutes. When the last ray of light entered Xia ruofei’s forehead, everything returned to normal.

At this moment, the bookshelves on all four sides were empty.

The stream of light disappeared, but Xia ruofei was still absorbing the information. He was still standing at the same spot, frowning and closing his eyes. He was suffering from the discomfort of a huge amount of information being stuffed into his mind.

After another six to seven minutes, Xia ruofei finally heaved a long sigh of relief. He reached out to wipe the sweat off his forehead and looked around at the empty bookshelves.

He couldn’t help but reveal a trace of lingering fear. If the number of books on the shelf increased by another 20 to 30%, he was afraid that he would not be able to bear it.

In fact, Xia ruofei was overthinking. Although no cultivator had ever made it to the 9th level of the trial Pagoda, these books were actually rewards that had been prepared long ago. No matter if it was a Qi refining stage cultivator, golden core stage cultivator or nascent Soul Stage cultivator, if they really wanted to pass the stairway to heaven, they would all end up in the same place and end up in this study room.

In other words, even Qi refining cultivators could withstand these inheritances. It was just that the light formed by the books would not be so violent and would be slower.

In fact, since Xia ruofei had been transported from the top of the heaven ladder for golden core cultivators, the light streams of the books were basically transported at the maximum speed that golden core cultivators could bear.

It was only because of Xia ruofei that he had the strength to do so. If it was another Aurous core stage cultivator, he would have been in a much more difficult position.

In the hidden space enshrouded in purple clouds, the image on the bronze mirror in front of Taoist Qing Xuan and immortal Shan He had changed to the ninth floor of the trial Pagoda. The two of them were also paying attention to Xia ruofei’s situation.

When they saw that Xia ruofei had finished absorbing the information of the inheritance so quickly, they were all surprised.

The two experienced powerful cultivators quickly understood the reason. Daoist Qing Xuan could not help but show a trace of shock. After a long while, he said,””Brother mountain river, I’m really impressed … Your disciple’s mental power has already broken through to the spiritualization realm! It was no wonder that on the heavenly stairs, he seemed to be able to deal with the spiritual pressure with ease! And when 1 was absorbing the book of inheritance just now, it was so fast…”

Immortal mountain river also looked surprised and said,””Daoist Qing Xuan, this is a pleasant surprise!”

The two of them had both been in the Golden core stage and the original infant stage. They knew very well how difficult it was to cross the gap between the spirit gathering stage and the spirit transformation stage.

Back then, the two of them had been stuck in the spirit gathering stage for many years, and they had only broken through in one go because of a certain opportunity.

There were even some cultivators who had already reached the early stage of the nascent soul realm, but their spiritual power was still in the late stage of the spirit gathering realm. This was not uncommon.

On the other hand, Xia ruofei’s vital Qi cultivation had just broken through to the intermediate stage of the Golden elixir realm, but his spiritual power had already reached the spiritualization realm. This was even more commendable.

At the same time, this also showed that Xia ruofei had great potential in cultivation.

No wonder Qing Xuan Daoist priest did not hide his envy after he understood the key points.

Immortal Shanhe continued,”! think this disciple of mine broke through on the heaven ladder. Daoist qingxuan should still remember that on the four hundred and fiftieth step, he already showed signs of difficulty and was about to be eliminated. But later on, he became more courageous as the battle progressed, and each step was very stable!”

Qing Xuan nodded and said,””That’s it! It must be that his spiritual power has already reached the threshold of a breakthrough. Under the immense spiritual power Pressure, he used his unyielding heart to forcefully break through that solid barrier and raise his spiritual power to spiritualisation boundary!”

Daoist Qing Xuan was even more impressed. He sighed,””In such a difficult situation, this child didn’t give up and even went against the trend to break through. This kind of unyielding tenacity is truly valuable! Brother mountain river, you’ve really taken in a good disciple!”

Although Qing Xuan Taoist priest had said this more than once, immortal mountain river could not help but smile after hearing it. He said,””This child’s cultivation is still very low, and we don’t know how he will develop in the future! I don’t deserve such a high evaluation from Daoist Qing Xuan!”

Qing Xuan glanced at immortal mountain river and said,””It’s a bit hypocritical of you to say that! I’m not blind!”

Hearing this, immortal mountain river couldn’t help but burst into laughter.””In the future, if this child, Fei, has any achievements, it will be thanks to Daoist Qing Xuan’s efforts!”

On the ninth floor of the trial Pagoda, Xia ruofei stood quietly in the middle of the study room. He was surrounded by empty bookshelves.

Although all the information had been transferred, he still had not come back to his senses.

There was too much information to process.

It could be said that the information contained in all the books on these four bookshelves was several times more than the information he had obtained from the three Jade talismans combined.

Xia ruofei took a quick look and realized that the inheritance information was all – encompassing. There were all kinds of cultivation techniques, ancient books, cultivation anecdotes, array techniques, medical techniques, alchemy techniques, smithing techniques … It really had everything. Xia ruofei even found a few ancient books about spiritual plants, which taught people how to identify, plant, and maintain spiritual herbs.

Just like the information from the Jade talisman of inheritance, the information that Xia ruofei had obtained on the ninth level of the trial Pagoda had entered his mind directly. It also included the experiences of many predecessors. It was like being enlightened and directly transmitted into his mind.

Xia ruofei also realized that some of the contents were the same as the ones he had obtained from the Jade talisman of inheritance. In other words, some of the books and techniques that immortal mountain river had collected back then were also recorded in the ninth floor of the trial Pagoda.

Of course, in comparison, the contents of the inheritance here were more comprehensive, and the amount of information was also much larger.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh and mumble to himself,””This reward is quite special! First, pack up thousands or even tens of thousands of precious books? Is this a big gift bag for clearing the game?”

Xia ruofei mumbled to himself as he continued to check the new information in his mind. Suddenly, his expression changed slightly and he looked surprised
