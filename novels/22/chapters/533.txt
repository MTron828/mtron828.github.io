Chapter 534: The treatment of the rich (2)

Of course, Captain Johnson knew that Xia ruofei was joking. He laughed heartily and said,””Mr. Xia, thank you for your generosity, but I’m more looking forward to the beautiful scenery of China!”

“Haha, then let’s go!” Xia ruofei smiled.

“Mr. Xia, please board the plane!” Captain Johnson made an inviting gesture and said,”I hope you enjoy today’s journey!”

Xia ruofei boarded the plane through the accommodation ladder.

Every Gulfstream plane would have its space layout and interior matching according to the customer’s preference. Tang He’s plane was slightly different from MA Xiong’s private plane that Xia ruofei had taken before, but it was still as luxurious.

It had a wide, handmade single – person leather seat, expensive wool carpet, and a dazzling array of modern electronic equipment. It was absolutely an extreme enjoyment to sit in such a plane. Compared to it, the most luxurious Airbus A380 first – Class cabin was like a youth hostel to a super five – Star hotel.

Xia ruofei’s net worth was far from that, but he had enjoyed the luxury of being the world’s richest man in advance.

Xia ruofei was the only passenger today. After he boarded the plane, the cabin crew quickly took their positions.

The flight attendant retracted the accommodation ladder and closed the cabin door.

Captain Johnson brought the co – Pilot and the air Mechanic into the cockpit and once again performed the various checks before take – off.

After a while, the flight attendant came over and reminded Xia ruofei to fasten his seat belt.

The plane trembled slightly and began to slowly glide on the runway.

As the flight route had been applied in advance, the Gulfstream G650 was allowed to take off after waiting for a minute or two at the runway.

The Gulfstream G650 slid into the runway and turned around at the end of the runway. The nose of the plane was aimed in the take – off direction.

Then, the engine was set to take – off thrust, and the plane began to accelerate rapidly on the runway.

Xia ruofei did not feel any vibration. The plane took off gracefully. Under the afternoon sun, the body of the plane drew a beautiful arc and rose quickly towards the cruising altitude.

The entire process was quite smooth, and there were no bumps at all due to the small size of the plane.

The process of climbing was also faster than that of an ordinary passenger airliner. It didn’t take long for the seat belt warning light to go off.

The flight attendant came over and served Xia ruofei a well – prepared lunch. The main course was Angus steak. The ingredients were from the high – Quality ranches in the Hunter Valley area of Australia. Of course, red wine from the Hunter Valley winery was also included.

After Xia ruofei enjoyed his lunch, the flight attendant quickly cleared the table and asked Xia ruofei if he needed to take a rest in the lounge.

There was a lounge at the back of the plane. After sacrificing some space for the seats, this lounge was equipped with a real soft bed instead of the relatively narrow sofa bed commonly seen in the plane’s first – Class cabin.

Xia ruofei had rolled in the sheets countless times last night and this morning. Even with his amazing physical strength, he still felt tired. Thus, he gladly accepted the flight attendant’s suggestion and got up to walk to the lounge at the end of the cabin.

Xia ruofei told the flight attendant to wake him up when the plane was about to land. He then walked into the lounge and locked the door.

This lounge could be completely locked, providing the user with a very private space.

Xia ruofei closed all the windows in the lounge and dimmed the lights. He took off his coat and lay on the bed.

Xia ruofei felt like he was in a dream.

He had actually rolled in bed with a foreign girl he had only met a few times, and it seemed like he had a taste of her. At least, in terms of sensory stimulation, Monica was more pleasing to Xia ruofei than Ling Qingxue.

Xia ruofei felt that his relationship with Monica was a little complicated. It was obvious that the two of them had long gone beyond ordinary friends. Moreover, they did not seem to be just having sex. Didn’t Monica say that she wanted to “keep herself pure” for him?

Ever since he found out that he had taken Monica’s first night, Xia ruofei’s impression of Monica seemed to have changed.

As for how to define his relationship with Monica, Xia ruofei was also a little confused.

As his imagination ran wild, Xia ruofei’s breathing gradually stabilized and he entered Dreamland ...

What did it feel like to sleep tens of thousands of feet up in the air? If Xia ruofei were to be asked this question, he would not be able to answer.

This was because he felt that it was no different from sleeping at home. He had been trained in the Army and could fall into a deep sleep very quickly no matter what environment he was in. This time was no exception.

Xia ruofei was woken up by the soft beeping sound of the communication device on the bed. He drowsily took off the communication device and heard the flight attendant politely remind him that the plane was about to leave cruising altitude and begin to descend in ten minutes.

Hence, Xia ruofei got up, put on his clothes, and returned to his seat. He fastened his seatbelt.

It was already dark outside the porthole. It was already night time.

Xia ruofei looked at the time. He had slept for about eight hours. It was already Seveno’ clock in the evening in China. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The plane quickly began to descend and finally landed smoothly at the Changping International Airport in Sanshan city.

After the plane taxied to the dedicated tarmac, Xia ruofei lifted his suitcase and thanked Captain Johnson and the other crew members who had walked out of the cockpit. Then, he got off the plane and went through the special passage to complete the immigration procedures.
