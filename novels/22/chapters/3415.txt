Chapter 3416: Both of them broke through_2

Translator: 549690339

Xia Qing naturally carried out Xia ruofei’s order to the letter and quickly prepared a sharpened pine wood sword.

Xia ruofei took out the newly – made pine wood sword and held it in his hand.

Ling Qingxuc looked and saw that Xia ruofei had actually taken out a wooden sword. As Xia ruofei was in a hurry, he had specifically instructed Xia Qing not to pay too much attention to its appearance. Hence, the workmanship of this pine wood sword was indeed a little rough, but it was barely shaped into the shape of a sword.

Ling Qingxuc couldn’t help but be dumbfounded. She was stunned for a moment before she asked,””RUO Fei, you’re not thinking of using this sword to pick the fruit, arc you?”

“That’s right!” Xia ruofei said with certainty.

“Is there a mistake? Even such a sharp flying sword can’t handle it, and you’re counting on a wooden sword?” Ling Qingxue asked, her eyes wide.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”don’t underestimate this wooden sword. It’s been blessed by a Senior Master.” It’s absolutely invincible!”

Ling Qingxue didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”come on! It was obvious that it was just made, and it was very rough! You’re not kidding me, right?” Xia ruofei said,”why would I tease you at a time like this?” Just wait and see! Open your eyes wide! Don’t ever blink!”

With that, Xia ruofei waved his wooden sword to cut the branch of the Vermilion Jade Fruit and used his spiritual power to tell scholar Yuntai,””Senior Yuntai, as you can see, I’ve boasted to my cultivation partner. Please don’t remember it wrong, or I’ll really lose face!”

Scholar Yuntai laughed and said,”don’t worry!” Don’t worry! I have a good memory, so the most suitable sword is definitely pine wood!”

As the two of them spoke, Xia ruofei’s pine wood sword had already made contact with the Vermilion Jade Fruit.

Not only Ling Qingxue, but even Xia ruofei’s eyes were wide open as he looked forward.

A miraculous scene happened. When the ordinary – looking pine wood sword touched the indestructible branch, it cut the branch off as if it was tofu.

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. He only came back to his senses after the two Vermilion Jade fruits fell for a short while. He quickly used his spiritual power to lift them up and prevent them from falling off the cliff.

If he were to pick it up but not hold it and fall into the depths of the cliff, that would be the biggest joke!

Ling Qingxue was flabbergasted. After a long while, her eyes widened and she said,””This … This … It’s actually effective!” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Xia ruofei had already regained his senses. He carefully used his spiritual power to lift the two Vermilion Jade fruits and laughed.”Qingxue, this is called” everything has its weakness “!”

Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei suspiciously and asked,””You weren’t acting before, were you? This is too amazing!”

Xia ruofei did not know whether to laugh or cry,”am I that bored?” Besides, the blue immortal sword really touched the branch just now. Even if I didn’t use any force, with the sharpness of the blue immortal sword, an ordinary branch would have been broken!”

“That’s true…” Ling Qingxue said.

After the Vermilion Jade Fruit left the fruit tree, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue quickly realized that the poisonous fog outside the vital Qi barrier was actually dissipating at a rapid speed.

To be more precise, they did not dissipate, but all gathered at the Vermillion Jade Fruit tree and were directly absorbed by the fruit tree.

The cut on the fruit tree that had just been made by the pine wood sword also healed very quickly, and a new branch grew out, as if the poisonous fog was the best nourishment.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue looked at the scene in front of them curiously until all the clouds had been absorbed by the Vermillion Jade Fruit tree. At this time, the branch where the Vermilion Jade Fruit was on had completely recovered, and two small buds had grown on it.

It was obvious that as long as there was enough time, two more Vermilion Jade fruits would grow on it.

Out of caution, Xia ruofei did not remove the yuan Qi protective shield. However, he could not help but look down curiously.

After the poisonous fog dissipated, the bottom was naturally visible. However, with his eyesight, he still couldn’t see how deep it was. It was as if the cliff had been cut down by a knife and an axe, and it continued to extend downward. Below it was a black abyss.

Xia ruofei felt a sense of oppression just by looking at it. The abyss was like a giant beast with its mouth wide open. It made one’s heart palpitate.

“Qingxue, we’ve got the loot. Let’s go up!” He said directly.

Ling Qingxue had also looked down, and when she saw the black abyss, she felt even more scared. She quickly said,””Good, good, good! It’s quite scary down there…”

Xia ruofei didn’t touch the Vermilion Jade Fruit with his hands. He used his spiritual power to wrap them up. Then, he urged the flying sword under his feet and flew up at the fastest speed. In the blink of an eye, he arrived at the top of the mountain.

Xia ruofei then removed the yuan Qi protection and lowered his flying sword.

After the two of them jumped off the flying sword, they took off their spacesuits and prepared to split the loot. Yingying had tried it earlier on as well. As expected, the Vermilion Jade Fruit could not be stored in the spirit map space, so they could only eat them directly.

Xia ruofei asked,”senior Yuntai, how do I use this Vermilion Jade Fruit?” Should I take it directly?”

“In this case, I can only consume it directly.” Scholar Yuntai said,”I’ve heard that some alchemy Masters can use the Vermillion Jade Fruit as the main ingredient to refine spiritual pills. The effects of the spiritual pills they obtain are much better than directly consuming the Vermillion Jade Fruit. However, only alchemy Masters at the leaving aperture stage and above can do this …”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei dispelled his other thoughts. The leaving aperture period was very far away for him. Besides, he did not have much research on alchemy and only knew how to make some spiritual herbs. He did not even know what spiritual pills looked like.

Compared to his array Dao level, his alchemy Dao could not even be considered to be at the beginner level.

This Vermillion Jade Fruit couldn’t be taken out of the trial Pagoda, so there was no other choice but to eat it directly.

Hence, Xia ruofei asked,”then … Senior Yuantai, may I ask if Qi refinement cultivators can also consume the Vermillion Jade Fruit?”

“The Vermilion Jade Fruit is most suitable for golden core cultivators,” said scholar Yuntai. For Qi condensation cultivators, the Vermilion Jade fruit’s medicinal properties were a bit too strong. However, I can see that your Dao companion’s mental energy cultivation seems to be very high. She should be able to withstand the energy of half a Vermilion Jade Fruit. Any more than that and it won’t be good! In addition, you can only take one Vermillion Jade Fruit at most. If you take too many, there is still a risk of your body exploding.”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be stunned. Then he said,””Wouldn’t that be wasting half a Vermillion Jade Fruit?”

Scholar Yuntai said,”that can’t be helped. After all, you can’t take the Vermillion Jade Fruit out… But this is already a very rare opportunity. You can’t bite off more than you can chew. You should give up what should be given up.”

“I understand! Thank you for your guidance, senior Yuntai!” Xia ruofei said.

He believed in the words of scholar Yuntai without a doubt, so he naturally didn’t dare to let Ling Qingxue eat the whole fruit.

He thought for a moment, then used the pine wood sword to split one of the Vermillion Jade fruits into two. He then handed the other half of the fruit to Ling Qingxue and said,””Qingxue, your cultivation is not high enough, so you can only take half a fruit at most. Anything more than that will be dangerous

“You should keep it for yourself!” Ling Qingxue said,”it’s more important for you to improve your cultivation.”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I can only eat one at most. Otherwise, I’ll be in danger.” Qingxue, I’ve already arranged everything, you can take it directly! Then, he would cultivate here. I don’t know how long we can stay on the sixth floor of the Tower of Trials.”

“Alright then!” Ling Qingxue said.

Then, without hesitation, she stuffed the half a Vermillion Jade Fruit into her mouth.

Seeing this, Xia ruofei also stuffed the whole Vermillion Jade Fruit into his mouth.

After the Vermillion Jade Fruit entered his stomach, Xia ruofei felt a warm current flowing through his body. It was as if he was bathing in a hot spring.

Immediately after, Xia ruofei felt the vital Qi in his dantian start to stir. The circulation of his technique became faster and faster as he continuously absorbed the essence of the Vermilion Jade Fruit.

Soon, Xia ruofei felt that the momentum this time was very strong.. It was a direct breakthrough in cultivation!
