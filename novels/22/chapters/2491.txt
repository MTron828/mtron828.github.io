2492 Official transfer announcement (1)

Zhou leiyun chuckled and said,”yeah!” We have reached an agreement with the Shengang club. As long as there is no problem with the physical examination Spain, Wu Lei will be a player of our club!” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Xia ruofei opened Weibo on his computer and asked,””How much is the transfer fee?”

“Two million euros!” Zhou leiyun said with a smile.

Xia ruofei easily found the link to the live broadcast of the press conference. He clicked on the Live Broadcast page and said in surprise,””So cheap? It seems that the Shenggang team is very supportive of Wu Lei’s decision to stay abroad!”

Wu Lei was the best shooter in the Chinese Super League this season. So many big – Name foreign players were trampled under his feet. Although he had the support of the entire Shengang system and strong foreign players, it also fully showed that Wu Lei’s own strength was not ordinary.

In the Chinese Super League, if a striker of Wu Lei’s level were to transfer, according to the current domestic market, it would cost at least a hundred million Yuan. Two million euros was not even one – fifth of the price.

Of course, the Chinese Super League had been burning money in recent years. The price of a Chinese player was falsely high. Moreover, transferring from the Chinese Super League to one of the five major leagues, La Liga, was in a sense a “higher social ladder.” Even so, two million euros was really too cheap.

Zhou leiyun laughed and said,”they’ve indeed made a huge concession!” Although the Shengang club’s reputation in the country has not been very good for the past two years, there is nothing wrong with supporting the players to stay abroad!”

Shengang club was also a mid – tier super nouveau riche. They had spent a lot of money to bring in two super foreign players. They were strong contenders for the championship every season, but they were a little stingy in some things.

For example, in Shengang’s home game against Tianjin, the Tianjin team had a defender who was good at throwing the ball with great strength. The out – of – bounds balls near the end line were directly thrown into the penalty area by him. In order to prevent his hands from slipping when he threw the ball, the defender would wipe the ball with a towel every time he served the out – of – bounds ball.

Therefore, the Tianjin team placed towels on both sides near the bottom line in advance.

However, during the game, the ball boy from Shengang took the towel away and had a conflict with the assistant coach of the Tianjin team.

In addition, the Shengang team was also very familiar with many of the common means used at home, such as a lot of watering before the game and deliberately delaying time with the ball boy.

In addition, the Shengang team was a team from the shencheng area and belonged to the state – owned shencheng Port Authority group. Therefore, some fans called the Shengang team “dock team,””little men team,””towel team,” and so on.

Of course, these were all not very pleasant to hear.

Xia ruofei had not watched much football for the past two years. However, during this period of time, because he had invested in a Spanish club and there was news of Wu Lei’s transfer, he had taken advantage of his break to understand the situation of the two clubs. He had even watched a live broadcast of Shengang team’s game last weekend. Thus, he had some understanding of the “deeds” of the Shengang team.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”that’s why I said nothing is absolute!” From this incident, it also shows that this club is still generous. My impression of them has changed a lot!”

“That’s true, but this transfer isn’t that simple. ” Zhou leiyun laughed and said,”let’s say we have the same ownership of Wu Lei as the Shengang club! If Wu Lei were to transfer to another club in the future, a part of the transfer fee would be given to Shengang club. Also, if Wu Lei transfers back to the Chinese Super League, Shengang club will have priority. ”

Zhou leiyun continued,”of course, the Shengang club is not without effort. Other than the concession on the transfer fee, because Wu Lei only has an annual salary of one million euros in our RCD Espanyol, which is almost half of his income in the Chinese Super League, the Shengang club also gave Wu Lei some compensation on the annual salary. It is still very humane.”

With Wu Lei’s current value and the fact that he had never proven his strength in the five major leagues, the Spanish club certainly could not offer a high salary. Even if the boss was Chinese, they could not act recklessly. After all, the club had 20 to 30 players in the first team alone. If Wu Lei was paid a high salary, what would the other players think? How could the changing room be stable? What if everyone demanded a pay raise? Do you still want the club’s financial balance?

In order to realize his football dream, Wu Lei was willing to reduce his salary by 50% to play in La Liga. This was him paying for his dream and feelings. The Shengang club gave Wu Lei a certain subsidy on his annual salary to try not to make him lose too much of his income. This was indeed a very humane approach.

Although Shengang did this so that Wu Lei would be willing to return to Shengang to play football unconditionally in the future, this practice still made Xia ruofei’s impression of the club improve.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I have to give this club’s leader a thumbs up!” By the way, CEO Zhou, when is Wu Lei going to Spain?”

“It should be within these two days!” Zhou leiyun said,”it’s either tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. He has to go to Spain for a medical examination. If there are no problems, he can officially sign the contract. In addition, his shoulder injury can’t be delayed any longer. If everything goes well, we’ll arrange for him to go to Germany for surgery after signing the contract, and then return to Barcelona to recuperate. This way, he can also have some time to adapt to life Spain and the team’s environment. “
