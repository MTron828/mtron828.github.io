Chapter 3662: Gathering at the first heaven society (2)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei quickly turned around and said in surprise,””So it’s sect leader mu! Long time no see! Sect leader mu, you’re still as elegant as ever!”

Mu Sheng was experienced. He knew that Xia ruofei did not realize that he was chasing after him.

Thinking about it, Mu Sheng’s face turned red. Just now, he had used all his strength, but the person in question didn’t even notice him, which was a bit of a blow.

Of course, Mu Sheng would never show this. He laughed and said,””Yup! Little brother Xia, you were also invited to watch sect leader Chen break through to the nascent Soul stage, right? It seems that we are really fated! The time of arrival was almost the same. By the way, little brother Xia, How long have you been here?”

Mu Jianfei had a strange expression on his face. He wanted to laugh, but he was afraid of being lectured by his strict father, so he had a hard time holding it in.

Xia ruofei naturally didn’t know Mu Sheng and mu Jianfei’s thoughts. He thought for a while and said,””I’ve only just arrived, and … I’ve only had two or Three Cups of Tea!”

Mu Sheng almost vomited blood. The black Phoenix flying ship was only 50 to 60 meters away from him. However, Xia ruofei’s Black Phoenix flying ship had left him in the dust. By the time he arrived, Xia ruofei had already been drinking Three Cups of Tea leisurely. How infuriating!

Although he was very depressed, Mu Sheng did not show any abnormal expression. He smiled and said,””Little brother Xia is enjoying fragrant tea here, accompanied by a beauty. It’s quite pleasant!”

When the female disciple Qing Lian heard this, she couldn’t help but blush. She quickly lowered her head to arrange the tea set to hide her embarrassment.

Xia ruofei said,”senior mu, you must be joking. I’m just a guest who does as the host wants. I’m just taking a break here.” That’s right, even senior mu has rushed over from the southwest. It seems that the first heaven society has invited quite a number of special guests this time!”

Mu Sheng nodded and said,”I think there will be a lot of people. This is a breakthrough to the nascent Soul Stage!” How many years had it been since a Yuanying stage cultivator appeared in the cultivation world? For brother Nanfeng to be able to achieve such an achievement, he is truly worthy of being the number one person in the cultivation world!”

Mu Sheng was still very emotional. He and Chen Nanfeng were cultivators of the same generation, and they had a good personal relationship. However, his cultivation talent and opportunities were worse than Chen Nanfeng’s.

It turned out that although his cultivation was slightly lower than Chen Nanfeng’s, they were both golden core cultivators and belonged to the same major realm. There was naturally a gap, but it was not so great that it was difficult to catch up.

However, once Chen Nanfeng broke through to the nascent Soul Stage this time, there would be a huge gap between him and Chen Nanfeng. With the current cultivation world on Earth’s dilapidated environment, he would probably be left in the dust for the rest of his life.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sect leader Chen, you’re a genius. It’s only a matter of time before you break through to the original level.” However, this was a rare opportunity to watch a cultivator break through from the late – Stage of the Aurous core stage to the Yuanying stage! We’ll definitely gain a lot from this. The benefits for our future cultivation are obvious. So, we owe the first heaven society a big favor this time.”

Mu Sheng laughed and said,”the experience of breaking through to the Yuanying stage is indeed very precious for young geniuses like brother Xia. But for an old man like me, it’s dispensable. I haven’t even seen the hope of the late jiedan stage, let alone the Yuanying stage. It’s really too far away for me …”

At this time, a sound of something breaking through the air could be heard.

Xia ruofei, Mu Sheng, and mu Jianfei turned their heads at the same time and saw the Clearwater flying boat flying towards them from the heavenly sect’s direction at an extremely fast speed. Before the flying boat could completely stabilize, Chen Xuan had already jumped off the deck.

With a warm smile on his face, he greeted from afar,””Brother RUO Fei! Senior mu! Junior Brother Jian Fei! I welcome you all!”

“Brother Chen, long time no see!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Mu Sheng and mu Jianfei also greeted Chen Xuan with a smile.

Not far away, the welcoming disciple and the female disciple, Qing Lian, who was making tea in the pavilion, also stood up and bowed to Chen Xuan.

Chen Xuan nodded slightly and walked quickly to Xia ruofei and the other two. His face was filled with unconcealed joy.

Actually, the moment Chen Xuan appeared, Xia ruofei had been secretly observing his micro – expressions.

If the first heaven society had already discovered the traces of Shen tianfang’s death and determined that it had a lot to do with Xia ruofei, then Chen Xuan’s enthusiasm for Xia ruofei could only be an act. In fact, Xia ruofei could basically tell that Chen Xuan was genuinely happy.

Xia ruofei also felt a little relieved. Of course, he did not dare to relax completely. Chen Nanfeng was a formidable character. Even if he found something suspicious, he would probably hide it from Chen Xuan. After all, Chen Nanfeng knew that Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan had a good relationship.

“Brother RUO Fei, senior mu, Junior Brother Jian Fei, welcome to the first heaven society!” Chen Xuan continued enthusiastically,”my father is currently preparing for tomorrow’s breakthrough. Hence, he is unable to free himself to welcome everyone. He has specially instructed me to express my apologies to everyone. I hope that everyone can forgive me!”

Mu Sheng laughed.”Brother Nanfeng’s breakthrough to the nascent soul realm is a big and happy event for the entire cultivation world. It’s also the most important thing at the moment. How can we be so unreasonable?”

Xia ruofei also smiled.”Actually, brother Chen, you don’t have to come out to welcome us. You can just ask the disciples to bring us in. I’m flattered that you came to welcome us personally!”

“That’s what I should do!”Chen Xuan laughed. You’re all important guests of the first heaven society! Please board the airboat! I’ll bring everyone into the sect, and I’ve already arranged your accommodation! Please!”

Perhaps it was because Chen Nanfeng was about to break through to the nascent Soul Stage, Chen Xuan was in a particularly good mood today.

“Senior mu, please!” Xia ruofei smiled.

After a short greeting, Mu Sheng, as a senior, boarded the airboat first.

Mu Jianfei, on the other hand, refused to follow his father. He was a Qi layer cultivator, how could he walk in front of Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan, two golden cores?

Hence, Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan jumped onto the flying boat together. Mu Jianfei then jumped onto the flying boat lightly with the tip of his foot and followed behind the two of them.

Chen Xuan took control of the Clearwater flying boat and took off in the direction of the first heaven society.

A few minutes later, a magnificent ancient architectural complex appeared in their sight.

The heavenly sect was located in the depths of Mount Tai. To the secular world, this was a primitive forest that was rarely visited by humans. Even if someone mistakenly entered this place, they would leave the territory of the heavenly sect because of the formation. Even if they walked to the front of the mountain, they would not be able to see through the sect’s concealment formation.

The first heaven society’s buildings were built against the mountain, and they looked magnificent. Chen Xuan maneuvered the flying boat to the mountainside. There was an entire stretch of exquisite courtyards here, specially used by the first heaven society to receive important guests.

Each courtyard here was independent. Although the distance between courtyards was not far, they were separated by some natural mountain rocks or trees to ensure that the guests staying here could have a very good private space.

These courtyards had already been cleaned up inside and out a few days ago. At this time, it could be said that they were spotless, welcoming the arrival of the distinguished guests in their best appearance.

Chen Xuan controlled the flying boat to lower its altitude, and everyone jumped off the boat.

After Chen Xuan kept the swift Boat, he pointed to the nearest courtyard and smiled.””Uncle mu, you and Junior Brother Jianfei can stay in this courtyard! If you need anything, you can ask the service disciples.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Good! I’ll have to trouble you, nephew Chen!” Mu Sheng laughed and said,”then let’s go and rest!”

“Alright!” Chen Xuan replied courteously,”lunch will be sent to the courtyard. Tonight, we’ve prepared a welcome banquet. Uncle mu and brother Jianfei, please do us the honor of attending!”

“Good! We will definitely participate!” Mu Sheng said readily.

Mu Sheng and mu Jianfei walked into the courtyard that was allocated to them. Chen Xuan then smiled at Xia ruofei and said,””Brother RUO Fei, the courtyard you live in is in front. I’ll Take You There! We brothers haven’t seen each other for a long time.. Let’s have a few drinks together this afternoon and catch up!”
