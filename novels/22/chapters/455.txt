Chapter 456: Overseas returnee MBA_2

“Thank you!” Feng Rao smiled.

She drove the car into the farm’s Gate and parked it by the side of the road. Then, she got out of the car and said to Lei Hu, who was leading the way,””I’ll have to trouble you!”

Lei Hu made an inviting gesture and said,”Miss Feng, this way please!”

Qin Xiaojun returned to his post. He looked at Feng Jing’s back and muttered to himself,”This woman is too beautiful! Brother Xia is amazing!”

He still didn’t know that the seemingly weak and lovely young woman just now was very likely to become his superior’s superior ...

Under Lei Hu’s lead, Feng Rao looked around as they walked, and she asked Lei Hu some questions.

Lei Hu had not been working here for a long time, and there were many things about the farm that he was not very clear about. However, Xia ruofei had instructed him to receive Feng Jing warmly, so he could only briefly explain what he knew.

Naturally, Feng Jing couldn’t get the information she wanted.

However, when she saw the rows of beautiful modern greenhouse, she couldn’t help but show a look of admiration.

These greenhouses were up to 100 meters in length and neatly arranged on both sides of the farm Road. The neatly arranged brand – New greenhouses under the sun were pleasing to the eye.

Very quickly, Lei Hu brought Feng Jing to the newly completed complex.

When Feng Jing saw the six – story complex that took up quite a lot of space, she couldn’t help but be stunned.”Is this your farm’s office building?”

Feng Jing’s first thought was that it was such a waste. A small farm and an office building of this size didn’t even take up half of the space.

It had been many years since Feng Jing returned to the country. She knew that many government agencies and units had beautiful and luxurious office buildings. In some poor counties in the country, the tallest and most beautiful building in the county was the government office building.

However, very few bosses of private companies did this. They were all spending their own money, and no one would waste it like this.

When Lei Hu heard Feng Rao’s question, he immediately showed a proud expression and said,””This is our comprehensive building. The first and second floors are the cafeteria and office, and the third floor and above are the staff apartments and the farm guest rooms. Miss Feng, the conditions of our farm are very good! There’s a free lunch every day, and even us security guards can be assigned to a single apartment with one bedroom and one living room!”

After hearing this, Feng Jing was suddenly enlightened, and her impression of Taoyuan farm improved a little. Her impression of the chairman Xia she was about to meet also improved a little. At least this little boss was good to his employees.

Of course, this kind of good impression was very limited. After all, compared to the company she used to work in, Tao Yuan farm was really small ...

Very quickly, Lei Hu brought Feng Jing to Xia ruofei’s office.

Xia ruofei personally stood up to welcome Feng Jing and warmly invited her to the guest sofa to take a seat. At the same time, he asked Lei Hu to quickly prepare some tea.

Feng Jing was a little dazed when she saw Xia ruofei. She thought that she would see a middle – aged man with a big belly, or even a gold chain as thick as a thumb around his neck.

However, it was completely different from the image of a nouveau riche in her mind. Xia ruofei was slightly thin. Although he was not handsome enough to startle the people in the party, he had a sunny and clean aura, which made people involuntarily feel close to him.

Although Xia ruofei’s facial features were not as sharp as those of movie stars, they gave people a very comfortable feeling when put together. Especially his eyes, which were so bright as if they could see through people’s hearts.

It didn’t seem like a bad idea to work with such a handsome young man ... Feng Jing suddenly had this ridiculous thought.

Then, an even more ridiculous thought appeared in her mind: Could it be that Qianqian was trying so hard to recommend him because of this handsome guy?

From Xia ruofei’s point of view, the young married woman in front of him, who still retained her charm, was obviously distracted. This was because when Lei Hu placed the brewed tea in front of her, she actually did not have the slightest reaction.

“Miss Feng ...” Xia ruofei called out. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Only then did Feng Rao come back to her senses, and her face couldn’t help but heat up. What kind of nonsense was she thinking?

Although the other party was only a small boss, it was obviously unprofessional to be distracted in such a formal meeting.

Feng Rao revealed an apologetic smile and said,””I’m sorry, director Xia, I was just thinking of something else. ”

“It’s fine. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”miss Feng, sis Wu showed me your resume. I invited you here today to talk to you about work.”

Sis Wu? ‘As expected, he has a special relationship with Qianqian ...’ Feng Rao thought to herself.

But this time, she wouldn’t be distracted. With a professional smile on her face, she said,””Director Xia, I have a general understanding of your company’s situation. I have also taken a look just now. With all due respect, your company’s scale doesn’t seem to be very large. This job might not be what I expected.”

Xia ruofei was not in a hurry to explain. He just smiled and asked,””Oh? Then, what is the scale of miss Feng’s ideal company?”

“I used to be a Senior Consultant at pricewatry,” Feng Rao said confidently.”My previous job was the Senior Vice President of Hailang net. I think your company’s size is quite far from the two companies above, right?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”That’s for sure. However, I’m also sure that you can’t make all the decisions and keep your word in a company of this size, can you?”

Feng Rao looked at Xia ruofei as if he was a monster and said,”Of course!”

“But my company can give you the highest authority.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”being a high – Level female worker in a big company and leading a small company to grow and expand are two completely different things. Also, since miss Feng resigned from these two companies, I believe that’s one of the reasons, right?”

When the guard reported that Feng Jing had arrived, Xia ruofei took out the resume that Wu Liqian had given him and looked through it again. He knew that Feng Jing, who had returned from overseas and was a high – ranking overseas graduate, definitely had the dream of starting a business. Otherwise, Feng Jing would not have given up the position of the Senior Vice President of Hailang network.

“Director Xia, I admit that I’m tempted by the idea of maximum autonomy, but ...” Feng Jing smiled.

“I think miss Feng might as well take a look at our products first.” Xia ruofei said confidently.

“Product?” Feng Rao was stunned.

“Of course,” Xia ruofei shrugged.”Isn’t the core competitiveness of a company like us in the field of agricultural products?”

“That makes sense,” Feng Rao nodded.”I didn’t know the details before I came here.”

Xia ruofei got up and walked to the lounge. He took out the Taoyuan vegetable samples that he had prepared in the morning from the refrigerator and returned to the reception area to lay them out one by one.

Feng Rao looked at the neatly arranged tomatoes and cabbages on the coffee table, her eyes slowly widening. She didn’t hide her surprise at all.

The appearance of these paradise vegetables was simply too beautiful. The tomatoes were tender and alluring, and the cabbages looked as if they were carved out of Jade. It even made people unable to bear to eat them.

“Chairman Xia, your company ... All of your products look like this?” Feng Rao couldn’t help but ask.

“Of course, I picked them randomly from the vegetable greenhouse. I didn’t prepare any special preparations.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Although Wu Liqian had specifically emphasized the uniqueness of Taoyuan vegetables, Feng Jing could not feel the huge difference between them and ordinary vegetables without seeing it with her own eyes.

Moreover, Feng Jing had no direct experience with the name of Taoyuan vegetables in Quangang city.

Hence, when Xia ruofei took out paradise vegetables, Feng Jing was shocked.

Xia ruofei continued,”all of our company’s vegetables, fruits, and other products are currently in short supply, and the average price is ten times that of the same type of products on the market!” And the cost wouldn’t be much higher than a normal product ...”

“That means ...” Feng Jing said.”The profits are ten times that of a normal farm?”

“That’s just a conservative estimate,”Xia ruofei replied with a smile.

Then, Xia ruofei threw out another bombshell.””Moreover, our Peach Blossom Farm’s actual assets are more than ten million USD. I don’t think that this scale will be much worse than what you’re expecting, miss Feng!”
