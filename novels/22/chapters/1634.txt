Chapter 1635: Formation (2)

“Don’t underestimate me!” Song Rui snatched the shovel and said,”speak! How to dig? Even if you haven’t eaten pork, you’ve seen a pig run! Wasn’t it just digging a hole? What’s so difficult about that?”

Xia ruofei held back his laughter and drew a circle on the ground with his feet.””Dig down from this position. It doesn’t need to be very deep, 40 to 50 centimeters will be enough!”

“Just wait and see!” Song Rui said.

With that, he picked up the shovel and dug hard at the spot that Xia ruofei had marked. The ground beside the lake was wet and soft. After song Rui used all his strength, the end of the shovel was almost completely buried in the soil.

He looked at Xia ruofei proudly and tried to lift the shovel with all his might. However, he was soon dumbfounded. He had used too much force just now and could not lift the soil up no matter what.

Xia ruofei tried to hold back his laughter. It was obvious that song Rui had never done farm work before. He only knew how to use brute force. The angle of the shovel was too straight and it did not go too deep. On top of that, he did not use much strength. That was why he was in such a sorry state.

“Come, come, come, I’ll show you!” Xia ruofei said.

He pulled song Rui aside and gently dug up a shovel of soil and threw it aside. Then, he said while digging,””Look carefully. The angle isn’t so straight. It’s slightly slanted, and don’t use brute force. You can step down with your feet to assist, and then gently lift it up. Won’t you get up?”

Song Rui saw that Xia ruofei had dug up the soil so easily and snatched the shovel back.

After a few attempts, song Rui finally found the trick. Although his efficiency was much lower than Xia ruofei ‘s, he was still very proud.”Did you see? This brother still has some talent for working!”

Xia ruofei didn’t want to dampen his enthusiasm, so he smiled and said,””Good luck then! Let’s complete the mission as soon as possible!”

“Alright!” Song Rui replied.

Although song Rui’s standard of work was average, the task was indeed not very large. In addition, he was very motivated, so after more than half an hour of hard work, a hole with a diameter of more than 20 centimeters and a depth of 40 to 50 centimeters was dug. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“How is it, ruofei?” song Rui asked, panting.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded,”it’s alright!” Let’s rest for a while!”

Song Rui sat on the ground next to him. He had been holding back his energy just now. Now that he was done, he felt that his arms were sore and weak, and at the same time, he felt waves of fatigue.

Song Rui rubbed his arm and asked,””RUO Fei, what do we do next?”

Xia ruofei took out the mountain tiger jade carving from his backpack and placed it in the hole that song Rui had dug earlier. He carefully corrected its position.

When he heard song Rui’s words, he replied without looking up,””Wait!”

Song Rui was stunned. He moved closer to Xia ruofei and looked at the downhill Tiger jade carving curiously. He could not help but ask,””The important mission you’re talking about, don’t tell me it’s digging a hole?”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”otherwise?”

“What the ...” Song Rui said,”what kind of important mission is this?”

“But I think it’s already very difficult for you ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Don’t look down on me!” Song Rui said,”I don’t do much work, but I’m good at learning! What kind of important mission is digging a pit? RUO Fei, if there’s any more difficult work, you can let me do it!”

Xia ruofei’s brain quickly calculated all the coordinates and finally decided on the position of the downhill Tiger Jade statue.

“Are you sure?” he looked up at song Rui and asked.

“Of course!” Song Rui puffed up his chest and said,”don’t underestimate me! I’m an amateur at physical work, but I’m smart!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei laughed evilly to himself.”Then I’ll arrange for you to complete the most important part of tonight’s event. This is related to whether we can complete the entire array or not. You must not drop the ball!”

Song Rui’s spirit was lifted when he heard this. He stood up from the ground and puffed out his chest. “Don’t worry! This bro never drops the ball at critical moments! Go ahead! What do you want me to do?”

“Don’t worry. We can only start after Wu Qiang and brother Zhao have finished their work!”Xia ruofei said. You’ll know in a while!”

“You’re keeping me in suspense ...” Song Rui muttered.

Xia ruofei ignored him. He picked up the walkie – talkie and asked,””Wu Qiang, how’s the situation on your side?”

Soon, Wu Qiang’s calm voice came from the walkie – talkie,””Boss, everything’s going well. We’re still short of four seats!”

“Received!” Xia ruofei said,”report to me after you’re done!”

“Understood!”

Xia ruofei put the walkie – talkie in his pocket and sat on the ground.””Let’s rest for a while! Come and have a cigarette! Wu Qiang and the rest still need some time ...”

Xia ruofei and song Rui sat by the lake, smoking and chatting. They waited for about 40 to 50 minutes before Wu Qiang’s voice finally came from the walkie – talkie,””Boss, it’s all done! What’s our next step?”

Xia ruofei picked up the walkie – talkie and said,”now, go back to the car with brother Zhao. Report to me immediately when you arrive!”

“Alright!”

Xia ruofei kept the walkie – talkie and patted song Rui.””Get up! Get ready to work!”

Song Rui’s spirit was lifted. He quickly stood up from the ground and asked,””Speak! What should he do? I can’t wait!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’ll teach you what to do after brother Zhao and Wu Qiang leave.” It’s not too late for you to regret now. Are you sure you don’t need me to do it personally?”

Song Rui waved his hand and said,””Stop dawdling! Just tell me what to do!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei chuckled.

The two of them stood by the pothole and waited for a few minutes. Wu Qiang then reported that they had already retreated to the car.

Hence, Xia ruofei immediately said to song Rui, who was already impatient,””Alright, it’s your turn! Do you see that Jade statue?”

“I saw it!” Song Rui nodded.

“Go over now and turn the Jade statue two circles clockwise, then three circles counterclockwise. Finally, press it down hard!” Xia ruofei said,”remember, don’t mess up the order. During the whole process, the Jade statue can not leave the ground. Do you understand?”

Seeing Xia ruofei’s serious expression, song Rui put away his nonchalant thoughts and said seriously,””Remember, two circles clockwise, three circles counterclockwise, press down hard. You can’t leave the ground during the whole process. Did I repeat it wrong?”

“Very accurate!” Xia ruofei patted song Rui’s shoulder and said,”go ahead! This is the most crucial part of tonight’s event, and it will directly determine the success or failure of our operation! It’s all up to you now!”

“Alright!” Song Rui rubbed his hands and walked to the pothole and squatted down. He did not notice that Xia ruofei, who was behind him, had a mischievous smile on his face.

As Xia ruofei had emphasized the importance of the Jade, song Rui did not dare to be negligent. He held the Jade carving very carefully and started to turn it slowly.

One, two ... Song Rui counted silently in his heart. After turning two rounds in a clockwise direction, he turned three rounds in a counterclockwise direction. Although it was a very simple action, perhaps it was due to psychological factors, song Rui actually felt very heavy. After he finished turning, he could not help but look up at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei gave an encouraging smile and said,””Continue!”

Song Rui nodded heavily and looked down at the mountain tiger Jade statue. Then, he placed his hand on the top of the Jade statue, gritted his teeth, and pressed down hard!

The moment song Rui pressed down on the Jade carving, he suddenly felt a chill coming from the Jade carving and couldn’t help but shiver.

......

Next to the Mercedes – Benz, Zhao Yongjun and Wu Qiang had already packed up the remaining supplies and put them in the car. The two of them were smoking and chatting beside the car.

When they talked about their past in the Army, the two of them also sighed with emotion.

When song Rui pressed down on the mountain tiger jade carving by the lake, Zhao Yongjun and Wu Qiang both felt something at the same time and couldn’t help but look in the direction of the lake.

Zhao Yongjun subconsciously gathered his clothes and said,””Why do I suddenly feel so cold?”
