Chapter 49  A flash of inspiration_1

    Xia ruofei looked at the one - mu Space in front of him and started planning.

  With the spiritual pond as one of the corners, a space of about 100 square meters was set aside for the mother plant, seedlings, and some of Xia ruofei's own miscellaneous items and farm tools. The Tri - colored flower was also in this area.

  There were still more than 500 square meters of space left. At the moment, the vegetable plot had used up about 200 square meters. Xia ruofei planned to use the remaining space to temporarily open up a vegetable plot. This way, it would not be a problem to supply both "West River moon" club and Ling Ji restaurant at the same time.

  Although the collaboration with Ling Ji F & B had been halted due to he Dong's interference, Xia ruofei was already very confident.

  Xia ruofei immediately rolled up his sleeves and started to work.

  After his terminal illness was cured, Xia ruofei was full of energy with the help of the petals of the exotic flower.

  Hence, Xia ruofei had no problem completing the seemingly huge workload. He just needed to spend some time.

  Due to the difference in the flow of time in this space, 10 hours here was only 1 hour in the outside world. Hence, Xia ruofei had plenty of time.

  He first used a hoe to open up the soft soil in the space into a vegetable field, which took him a few hours.

  After that, Xia ruofei sat down at the spirit pond and used a ladle to scoop up some water. He gulped it down and wiped his mouth as he prepared to process the vegetable seeds.

  Previously, when Xia ruofei was planting vegetables, he would fill a large plastic container with the spiritual pond water, soak the seeds in it for a few hours, and then sow them. After waiting in the outside world for a few hours, the seeds would sprout and he would return to the medium to plant them.

  This time, Xia ruofei did the same thing.

  He took the tidying box that was usually used to soak the seeds and filled half the box with water in the spirit pond. Then, he took out the water Spinach Seeds and poured them into the tidying box, and began to soak them.

  At this moment, an idea flashed across Xia ruofei's mind.

  He was soaking the seeds in the spiritual pond water. What if he added the petal solution of the Tri - colored flower to the spiritual pond water?

  After having this thought, Xia ruofei could no longer remain calm.

  The solution could cure als such as Lou Gehrig's disease and kidney failure, and it could also strengthen the body of healthy people. Could it also be effective on vegetable seeds and improve the quality of the vegetables?

  If it was really as he had guessed, then the problem of planting it in the outside world would be completely solved!

  Xia ruofei felt that he couldn't wait any longer. He immediately found another tidying box and filled it with some spirit pond water. He began to make the solution for the flower petals. He mixed the remaining solution from last time with grape juice and huoxiang zhengqi water. He was worried that the test results were inaccurate, so he made a new solution. Anyway, the flower petals would grow back every three days. It was worth it to use a petal for this experiment.

  Xia ruofei found an empty bottle, washed it, and filled it with the spiritual pond water. Then, he used a pair of tweezers to carefully pick up a petal and put it into the bottle.

  The flower petal instantly merged into the spiritual pond and disappeared without a trace.

  Xia ruofei closed the bottle and shook it a few times to ensure that the solution was even. Then, he unscrewed the bottle cap and poured about one - fifth of the spirit pool water into the plastic container. He then mixed it evenly with a wooden stick.

  Then, Xia ruofei found some cabbage seeds and poured them into the box. Cabbage had a shorter growth cycle and could be harvested in ten to twenty days. It was the most suitable for experiments.

  After doing all this, Xia ruofei left the spirit map space and went to the kitchen downstairs to make some breakfast. Then, he took a shower and rested for a while. After about two hours, he returned to his room, locked the door and windows, took out the scroll, and entered the spirit map space.

  According to the time ratio, the seeds in the medium had been soaking for about a day.

  Xia ruofei first scooped up the Water Spinach Seeds that had been soaked in the ordinary spiritual pond water and went to a vegetable field that he had specially opened up in the interspace for growing seedlings. He sprinkled the seeds evenly and covered them with a thin layer of soil before watering them with the spiritual pond water.

  After planting the water spinach, Xia ruofei returned to the seed - soaking area and took out about half of the cabbage seeds. He then planted them in the nursery vegetable field.

  He packed the remaining seeds in a small plastic bag and left the spirit map space with a watering can, a hoe, and other farming equipment.

  Xia ruofei brought these things to the small backyard of the villa.

  The backyard was supposed to be a lawn, but the owner of the villa had neglected the villa after the migration, so it was overgrown with weeds.

  Xia ruofei took off his jacket and put on a thin autumn coat. He picked up the hoe and started to work.

  He shoveled all the weeds away and turned the backyard over again. Then, he opened up two vegetable fields and a small area for seedlings.

  After that, Xia ruofei took a short break before starting to sow the seeds. He planted the seeds that had been soaked in the spiritual pond water that had been infused with the petals of the exotic flowers on the seedling - growing field. Then, he took water from the tap in the backyard and watered them.

  The reason why he did not use the soil and spiritual pond water was that Xia ruofei wanted to see if the quality of the seeds would increase significantly after soaking them in the exotic flower petal solution. Hence, he had to eliminate other factors.

  After all the seeds were sowed, it was already close to noon.

  Xia ruofei took a shower and washed off the stinky sweat on her body. She changed into a set of comfortable home clothes and casually made some lunch for herself.

  After they finished eating, Xia ruofei drove the pickup truck to Changping County and bought some plastic film and long bamboo strips.

  Back in the backyard of the villa, he built a simple greenhouse with bamboo sheets and plastic sheets on the seedling field.

  After he was done, he could only wait. It should take ten to twenty days to see the results.

  However, the vegetables produced in the origin space were enough to support him, so Xia ruofei was not in a hurry.

  He remembered that the succulent seedlings had been sent out three days ago. Shunfeng express was still rather helpful, so perhaps someone had already received the goods.

  Hence, Xia ruofei washed his hands at the tap and quickly went upstairs to turn on his computer. He then entered the back end of the Taobao shop. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

  Sure enough, he had already received more than a dozen orders. A total of 30000 Yuan had been transferred to his Alipay account.

  Xia ruofei first withdrew all the money into his bank card and then impatiently opened the comments section to see the customers 'comments.

  Looking at the comments backstage, they were all positive, and many of them were very long. Several of them were attached with pictures, which made them more convincing.

  "It's definitely worth it! This is the highest quality raw stone Flower I've found in all my years of playing with meat!"

  "A good friend in the industry introduced it to me. At first, I thought the price was a little expensive, but after I received the goods, I realized that it's not expensive at all! It's too cheap!"

  "Directly post the picture! So as not to be said to be entrusted! He was definitely a good seller! With this tortoise shell peony, I can throw away all the succulents I used to raise!"

  ……

  Then, in almost every comment, the buyers were asking when the new goods would be released, saying that they would inform them in advance so that they could be prepared to buy them.

  Xia ruofei pulled out his keyboard and was about to reply to the comments, but when he saw the comments urging him to get the new product, an idea suddenly came to his mind ...
