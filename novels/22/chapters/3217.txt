3218 The fragile blue water flying boat (1)

Seeing Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng, Chen Nanfeng squeezed out a smile and greeted,””Sect leader Luo, fellow Daoist Xia!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

Luo Qingfeng naturally noticed that something was wrong with the three of them, but he did not ask any further. He just smiled and said,””Sect leader Chen, sect leader mu, Valley master Liu, I was just about to bid farewell to the three of you!”

“Oh? Is sect leader Luo leaving?” Chen Nanfeng asked in surprise.

In his opinion, Luo Qingfeng was a firm supporter of Xia ruofei. Although Luo Qingfeng did not pass the music screening, at least he could give Xia ruofei more confidence by staying here. After all, he was also an Aurous core cultivator!

Therefore, Chen Nanfeng and the other two were quite surprised that Luo Qingfeng was in such a hurry to leave.

“There are still many things in the sect,” Luo Qingfeng said with a faint smile.”I can’t help much here, so I’ll go back first after discussing with the first elder.” The disciple I brought will stay and continue to serve everyone well. ”

“I see, then I wish sect leader Luo a safe journey!” Chen Nanfeng said.

Chen Nanfeng’s mind was not on Qingfeng Luo. Furthermore, Qingfeng Luo did not pass the music selection. Even if he stayed, he would not be able to participate in the moon exploration. Therefore, in Chen Nanfeng’s opinion, Qingfeng Luo’s departure did not matter at all.

Luo Qingfeng smiled and nodded. He then greeted Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha, and then nodded to Xia ruofei. He then left the courtyard house, found a place with no one around, summoned his flying sword, and flew away.

In the courtyard house.

Xia ruofei looked at the three and asked,””Three seniors, is there something else? You don’t look too good ...”

Chen Nanfeng sighed and said,””Let’s talk inside!”

“Alright, please come in!”

Everyone went to Xia ruofei’s master suite and sat down on the sofa in the living room.

“Fellow Daoist Xia, the three of us took some time to test the jadewater flying boat ...” Chen Nanfeng said.

Xia ruofei looked very surprised. He had just entered the room and talked with scholar Yuntai for a while, then called Li Yifu to arrange the purchase of spacesuits and other space equipment, and then called Luo Qingfeng over to give him some instructions. In fact, there was not much time.

The three of them had already taken the jadewater flying boat to space? Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

However, he felt relieved after thinking about it. If it was just to test the performance of the flying boat, it did not necessarily need to completely break out of the atmosphere. Besides, it would take enough time to fly up and down.

“Sect leader Chen, have the three of you reached the outer space?” Xia ruofei asked.

Chen Nanfeng shook his head.”I don’t think so. But I can see the curved outline of our world. It’s quite high.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”so ... The results of the test are not ideal?”

Chen Nanfeng sighed and said,””The environment outside is much worse than we thought. Just as fellow Daoist Xia said, the air at our altitude is very thin. If an ordinary person doesn’t have any protection, they may die in a short time. Even a golden core cultivator wouldn’t be able to hold on for long with their physical body ... It’s also for this reason that we didn’t continue flying upwards, but chose to return. ”

“I’m aware of the outer space environment.” Xia ruofei said,”that’s why I’m taking the spacesuits very seriously. I’ve already thought of a way to contact the United States to purchase spacesuits. Of course, there are also some other equipment, including the oxygen supply module. As I’ve said before, the Science and Technology of the secular world are sometimes more useful than the means of the cultivation world. ”

Chen Nanfeng nodded in agreement and said,””Yup! I heard from Xuan ‘er that there’s a Space Station made by ordinary people flying around above our heads. It’s much higher than the altitude we were at just now, but ordinary people without any cultivation can live on it for a long time. ”

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile.”There are many redeeming qualities about human technology. Furthermore, their development speed is far faster than the cultivation world.”

Then, Xia ruofei asked again,”three seniors, if it’s just the problem of the external environment, you don’t have to worry too much. I will definitely find a way to solve it.”

“If this was the only problem, we wouldn’t be so depressed ...” Mu Sheng said at this time.

“Oh? Could it be that there’s something that’s hard to solve?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Let brother Chen say it himself!” Mu Sheng sighed and said.

“Fellow Daoist Xia,” Chen Nanfeng said with a wry smile,”to be honest with you, I’m afraid we’ll have to discuss our plan again ... Because I’m afraid that the Clearwater flying boat can’t withstand long – term space travel!”

Mu Sheng also nodded and said,”that’s true. We didn’t stay for long just now, but the Bluewater flying boat has been damaged in the extremely cold environment outside. You also know that many things in the ancient cultivation world have been lost. This flying boat refining method is one of them. We don’t know how to repair it when it’s damaged.”

“It’s only been a short time, but it’s already damaged in several places.” Liu Mansha added,”a one – way trip to the moon will take ten days to half a month. We all think that the Clearwater flying boat will not be able to last that long. Moreover, we still have to consider the problem of returning!”
