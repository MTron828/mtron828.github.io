Chapter 1790: Song Wei's suggestion (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. Even he could not solve this problem. It was a complete mess. What solution could Song Wei come up with in such a short time?

However, he still said,”Oh?” Tell me. ”

Song Wei bit her lower lip and said,””Do you think ... We can let her start cultivating the” absolute beginning Heart Sutra “? Then ... After she reaches the third level of the Qi refining stage, you and she will use ... Use that kind of cultivation method. I think ... Maybe she will be able to understand us and accept my existence ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel disappointed. He smiled bitterly and said,””Song Wei, not everyone has the physique to cultivate! What if Qingxue was unable to cultivate? Doesn’t everything you’re saying ...” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

At this point, Xia ruofei suddenly stopped and looked at Song Wei with his eyes wide open. He stuttered,””Wait! You ... You ... What did you just say? Make Qingxue ... Accept your existence? You ... What ... Do you mean by this?”

Song Wei sighed and glanced at Xia ruofei. “It’s the literal meaning!”

“No... I ... I don’t quite understand.” Xia ruofei said.

Actually, it wasn’t that he didn’t understand. He was just too shocked.

What kind of person was Song Wei? She was the child of a Provincial Minister and a top student of Beijing University. She was a proud daughter of heaven in the whole country. Now, it seemed that she was willing to accept Ling Qingxue’s existence and even subtly placed her position below Ling Qingxue. How could Xia ruofei not be shocked?

“You heard me right. If sister Qingxue can accept my existence, I ... I don’t mind you being with her ...” Song Wei sighed.

“Song Wei, you ... Let me go!” Xia ruofei said,”this is too shocking!”

Song Wei took a deep breath to calm herself down and said,””Ruofei, this isn’t an impulsive decision. I’ve already thought it through. This is like an unsolvable question. No matter what you choose, I won’t feel good about the result ...”

Song Wei paused and said,”if you choose me, the guilt in my heart will accompany me for the rest of my life. A voice will keep telling me that I am a shameful third party!” Although this was an accident, I’ve liked you since a long time ago. If it wasn’t for this accident, you and sister Qingxue would be a match made in heaven. I’ve already made up my mind to give you my blessings. If you and sister Qingxue part ways because of today’s accident, I’ll be a sinner!”

“Song Wei, don’t say that ...” Xia ruofei felt bad.

“Let me finish, ruofei!” Song Wei waved her hand. If you had chosen sister Qingxue, to be honest, I’m not that magnanimous either. If it was in the past, I might have just left quietly, but after today’s incident ...”

At this point, Song Wei looked a little shy, but she quickly raised her head and said,””After today’s events, I know that I can’t leave you in this life! If you choose sister Qingxue in the end, I don’t think I’ll be able to live!”

At this point, Song Wei finally revealed a relieved smile and said,””So, instead of being tangled up in this, it’s better to make up my mind! This is the solution I want to give you!”

Xia ruofei looked into Song Wei’s eyes and asked,””Do you know what this means?”

“I know ... The pressure from family, public opinion, and ... Perhaps we’ll never have a proper status ... And many other problems!” Song Wei said,”but I’ve already thought it through. All of this is not important. Let’s leave the future to decide!”

Xia ruofei would be lying if he said that he was not tempted by Song Wei’s suggestion.

Which man didn’t dream of having three wives and four concubines? However, that was just a fantasy. In real life, such situations were rare and Xia ruofei had never dreamed of it.

However, the reality was right in front of his eyes. On one side was his first love, Ling Qingxue. The two of them were stuck together like glue. On the other side was Song Wei. Because of today’s special situation, Song Wei’s position in the depths of Xia ruofei’s soul was no less than Ling Qingxue ‘s.

No matter which one he gave up, it would be a heartache for Xia ruofei.

If Song Wei’s suggestion could be realized ...

Xia ruofei could not help but let his imagination run wild.

However, after thinking for a long time, he still said with a bitter smile,””Song Wei, your suggestion is too shocking. I need to think about it ... Also, it’s rare to have a body for cultivation. I don’t think Qingxue has the talent for cultivation ...”

“Even if she can’t cultivate, I still hope that you ...” Song Wei hesitated for a moment and said,”work hard in the direction I’m talking about! I won’t have any problems ...”

Xia ruofei was deeply touched. He hugged Song Wei’s shoulder and lowered his head. He placed his forehead on Song Wei’s and said softly,”I know ... Song Wei, no matter what, I won’t let you down ...”

Song Wei’s face was flushed red, and her eyes were overflowing with happiness.

Everything that happened today felt like a dream. Song Wei would not even dream of this ...
