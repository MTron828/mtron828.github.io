Chapter 680: The appearance of the world stone again (2)

Xia ruofei had seen many soldiers like this, but not a Colonel like this. He could not help but take a few more glances at Colonel Jin.

For Zhao Cheng to trust him so much, this person must have his own special abilities.

The mengshi command vehicle drove West and soon arrived at a heavily guarded neighborhood in the western suburbs.

It was called a residential area, but in fact, it was a Hill with soldiers stationed around it. The guards at the gate were not security guards, but armed soldiers.

At first, Xia ruofei was still wondering if general Zhao was receiving treatment in the military camp. Then, he thought about it and realized that since she was diagnosed with such a serious illness, she must have been resting at home. As expected, her final destination was this heavily guarded neighborhood.

Jin Feng stuck his head out and waved his hand gently. The bar of the gate immediately rose up. The speed of the mengshi almost did not slow down, and it accurately rushed past the gate. At the same time, the soldiers on both sides of the gate stood at attention and raised their chests, saluting the mengshi.

After entering the door, Xia ruofei suddenly felt a slight warmth in his chest.

He was stunned for a moment. However, he immediately realized that the Kasaya was the Jade Leaf that Xia Qing had carved. In other words, the realm stone’s sensing array had reacted!

There were world stones nearby?

Xia ruofei was both surprised and happy. He didn’t expect that there would be such a big surprise waiting for him on a friendly visit.

This was truly a case of travelling far and wide to find it without any effort!

However, Xia ruofei also knew that he could not reveal any suspicion at this time. No matter what, he had to wait until he had treated Zhao Cheng’s illness before finding an opportunity to search for him.

Since he already knew the location, as long as he could get to the district, the induction array would definitely be able to find him.

......

The only problem was the security in this area. It was as tight as a military camp. However, for Xia ruofei, it was not difficult to sneak in. At most, it would be a little troublesome.

As Xia ruofei’s mind was spinning, the car was still moving forward on the mountain road.

There were a few sentries in the middle, but when they saw the fierce warrior command vehicle, they immediately relaxed.

After passing each sentry post, the number of houses built along the mountain became fewer and fewer. After passing the third sentry post, the only thing that could be seen on the side of the road was villas scattered all over the place.

There were big and small villas, some were detached, some were stacked.

The mengshi command vehicle was still moving forward, and it did not look like it was about to reach its destination.

Xia ruofei, who was in the car, was no longer thinking about this.

He was very surprised to find that as the car moved forward, the Jade Leaf on his chest was getting hotter and hotter.

In other words, he was getting closer and closer to that world stone!

Finally, the mengshi command vehicle passed the fourth sentry post.

There were only a few dozen villas in this area, and these villas occupied a relatively large area. They also had their own front and back courtyards, which looked very stylish.

Obviously, this was a treatment that only the chief of a Military Region could enjoy.

Finally, the fierce warrior command vehicle stopped in front of Villa No. 6. However, it only stopped for a short while. Zi!” After a quick scan, the courtyard door opened silently to the sides with a click, and the fierce warrior command vehicle drove in.

At this moment, Xia ruofei’s emotions could not be any more excited. This was because the Jade Leaf was so hot that he could not bear it. He was almost certain that Qianqian’s realm stone was in general Zhao Cheng’s house!

Xia ruofei had been thinking about this all this while. He did not even notice that the car had stopped. It was only when song Rui nudged Xia ruofei with his elbow that he came back to his senses.

It turned out that general Zhao Cheng had come out to welcome them personally. Xia ruofei quickly opened the door and got out of the car. On the other side, song Rui also got out.

“Uncle Zhao!” Song Rui called out from afar.

Zhao Cheng, who was still dressed in his military uniform and had two golden stars on his shoulders, also revealed a hearty smile. He quickened his steps and said,”Xiao Rui! I haven’t seen you in years. I heard you’ve become more sensible. ”

Song Rui’s act of being an obedient child came from the bottom of his heart. He immediately showed an embarrassed smile and said,””Uncle Zhao, I just feel that it’s time for me to learn some skills and share the burden of my family!”

“Hahaha! Alright! This is what it means to be sensible!” Zhao Cheng patted song Rui’s shoulder hard. Song Rui grimaced in pain and didn’t dare to shout.

After exchanging a few pleasantries, Zhao Cheng turned to look at Xia ruofei and grinned.””You must be doctor Xia, right?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Nice to meet you, Sir. My name is Xia ruofei. I’m in charge of your treatment today.”

“Aiya! Doctor Xia, nice to meet you! I really have to thank you for this!” Zhao Cheng grabbed Xia ruofei’s hand and held it tightly.”Elder song has instructed me that in front of doctor Xia, I’m just an ordinary soldier. You’re my chief. If you tell me to go east, I will not go west. If you ask me to beat a dog, I definitely won’t chase a chicken away! In short, you must be firm in carrying out the orders and carry out the instructions thoroughly!”

Xia ruofei was dumbfounded when he heard this. Didn’t they say that general Zhao was a person who avoided treatment? How did he look like he was afraid of being treated? She was probably the most obedient patient in the world, right?

Song Rui, who was watching from the side, almost burst out laughing.

It seemed that grandpa’s tone was very strict! Look at how scared this uncle Zhao is ...

“Uh ... Chief ...” Xia ruofei was stunned.

“Doctor Xia, please don’t call me chief!” Zhao Cheng said,”during the treatment, you will be my superior, my chief!”

“Don ‘t!” Xia ruofei quickly said,”then I’ll call you general Zhao!”

“Alright! Doctor Xia, whatever you say!” Zhao Cheng said after thinking for a while.

“Then ... General Zhao, let’s find a quiet room first. I’ll check your body.” Xia ruofei said.

Zhao Cheng subconsciously said,”is there a need to check again?” Didn’t I just finish the sugar sifter? All the test reports are complete ...”

As he spoke, he felt that something was wrong. When he saw the smirk on song Rui’s face, he suddenly came to a realization and quickly changed his words.”Yes, yes, yes, a check is necessary! It’s very necessary!”

Xia ruofei was speechless, but he still explained,””General Zhao, I’m using the Traditional Chinese Medicine method of looking, listening, asking and feeling to give you a check. Since we’re going to use traditional Chinese medicine treatment, we naturally have to use the Traditional Chinese Medicine method to check first! Don’t worry, this won’t take up too much time. ”

“It doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter how long I’ll use it!” Zhao Cheng quickly said.

Song Rui couldn’t hold it in anymore and turned his back to her.

However, from his trembling body, even a fool could tell that he was laughing silently.

Even the usually serious Colonel Jin Feng could not help but smile. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Zhao Cheng personally led Xia ruofei’s group into the villa.

As soon as he entered, Xia ruofei felt that the Jade Leaf on his chest was on fire. It was extremely hot. He felt that his skin was about to burn too. It was really unbearable, so he decided to keep the Jade Leaf in the spirit map space.

In any case, he could now confirm that the world stone was definitely in Zhao Cheng’s Villa.

When Xia ruofei walked into the living room of Zhao city’s Villa, the spirit painting itself could sense the world stone. Xia ruofei could feel the agitation of the mark in his palm.

“Come, come, come,” Zhao Cheng said.”Doctor Xia, have a seat and have a cup of tea. I’ll get someone to prepare the treatment room.”

If it was in the past, Xia ruofei would definitely want to be treated first. However, he had put all his attention on the realm stone today. Zhao Cheng’s words were exactly what he wanted, so he smiled and nodded.

Everyone came to the coffee table and sat down. Xia ruofei followed the senses of the spirit map and sat in the inner seat without a trace.

Beside him was an ornamental fish tank. The bottom of the fish tank was covered with cobblestones of various sizes, some black and some white ...
