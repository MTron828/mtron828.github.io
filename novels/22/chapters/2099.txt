2100 Acquiesce (2)

With Ling Qingxue’s participation, the atmosphere at the table became even more lively. The three of them chatted as they drank, and they finished the two bottles of Drunken Eight Immortals that Xia ruofei had brought.

Ling Xiaotian was still a little unsatisfied and wanted to open the two bottles of noble rot wine to drink as well, but Xia ruofei quickly stopped him.

Xia ruofei would be fine. He would not get drunk from this little bit of alcohol. Even if Ling Qingxue’s cultivation was still very low, she could still use her true energy to expel the alcohol from her body. Therefore, if she were to really drink, the one who would get drunk would definitely be Ling Xiaotian.

Being drunk was not only bad for one’s health, but being knocked out by one’s own daughter on the wine table was also a bit too much of a blow, especially for Ling Xiaotian, who considered himself a wine immortal.

Of course, Xia ruofei would not say that he was worried that Ling Xiaotian would drink too much. This would only add fuel to the fire. His reason was that he still had to check Ling Xiaotian’s body. If he drank too much, he would not be able to do so.

Ling Xiaotian could only say,””Alright then! It’s not easy for me to drink so happily today, I want to drink more!”

“Uncle Ling, there’s still a long way to go. We’ll have many more opportunities to drink together in the future!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

The three of them got up and left the dining room. Aunt Liu would naturally clean up the leftovers.

They made tea in the living room for a while. Xia ruofei noticed that Ling Xiaotian reeked of alcohol and suggested that he should check on him.

Xia ruofei checked Ling Xiaotian’s pulse and then looked at his tongue. Of course, to be more accurate, he used his spiritual power to check his pulse.

Xia ruofei checked carefully and said,””Uncle Ling’s health isn’t bad. It’s just that his spleen and stomach are a little weak, and his liver fire is a little strong.”

“Ruofei,” Ling Qingxue said hurriedly,”can you give my father a prescription? get some medicine and take it.”

Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s just a small problem. Food therapy is better than medicine. I’d better give uncle Ling two herbal recipes!” It just so happens that your family does this, so it’s perfect to use Medicinal Food to recuperate!”

Ling Xiaotian chuckled,”sure!” I don’t like to eat bitter Chinese medicine, so it’s better to use medicinal cuisine!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Ling Qingxue quickly returned with a pen and paper for Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei scribbled down a prescription and handed it to Ling Xiaotian.

Then, he said,”uncle Ling, I’ve written down the ingredients needed for the herbal dish and the cooking method on the paper. You just have to follow the recipe!” This medicinal cuisine is not suitable for daily consumption. You should probably eat it every other day! In less than a month, all these small problems will be recuperated. ”

“Good, good, good!” Ling Xiaotian said happily, then carefully kept the recipe.

Then, Ling Xiaotian said,”ruofei, you’ve drunk quite a lot tonight. You definitely can’t drive. Why don’t you stay here for the night?”

Ling Qingxue turned to look at Xia ruofei.

Naturally, she wanted Xia ruofei to stay the night. However, she was a girl after all and was embarrassed to ask her father to stay. Now that Ling Xiaotian had suggested it himself, she was overjoyed.

If Xia ruofei stayed here, not only could the two of them be intimate, they could even use the time formation to cultivate. Ling Qingxue was looking forward to it.

Of course, Xia ruofei would not decline. He smiled and said,””Alright! Then I’ll have to trouble uncle Ling!”

Ling Xiaotian smiled and waved his hand.”We’re all on the same side. What’s there to talk about?”

“Father, I’ll go prepare a guest room for RUO Fei!” Ling Qingxue said hurriedly.

Ling Xiaotian looked at his daughter with a smile that was not a smile and said,””Why do you need a guest room? Even if it’s prepared, it might not be used. When the time comes, aunt Liu will have to wash an extra set of bedsheets ...”

How could Ling Qingxue not understand what Ling Xiaotian was hinting at? She immediately blushed and pouted,””Dad ...”

Ling Xiaotian waved his hand and said,”Alright, alright!” You’ve been together with ruofei for so long, I’m not an old – fashioned man!”

Xia ruofei didn’t expect Ling Xiaotian to be so carefree. Wasn’t it said that all fathers would pay special attention to their daughters, and even unconsciously carry a trace of hostility towards their daughters ‘boyfriends?

“Uncle Ling, this ... Isn’t appropriate, is it?” he laughed drily.

Ling Xiaotian laughed and said,”anyway, I’ve said enough. You guys can decide for yourselves how you’re going to stay the night!” I’ll give old Jiang a call and ask him about the house ...”

With that, Ling Xiaotian left Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue behind and went straight to the study.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue looked at each other. Finally, Ling Qingxue asked with a red face,””Ruofei, what should we do?”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”My future father – in – Law has already made it so clear. How can I disappoint his good intentions?”

“Ah? My dad is at home! “If we stay in the same room, wouldn’t it be ...” Ling Qingxue said shyly.

“If we don’t stay in the same room, wouldn’t we be lying to ourselves?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”wife, it’s getting late. Let’s go to bed!”

With that, Xia ruofei strode upstairs and went straight to the door of Ling Qingxue’s boudoir. Then, he turned around and said to Ling Qingxue, who was following behind him slowly,””Wife, do you have to walk until dawn?”

Ling Qingxue glared at Xia ruofei and said,””Fine, we’ll live together! I’m not afraid of you!”

Then, she strode forward and opened the door before Xia ruofei could. She glared at Xia ruofei as if to show off her power and then walked in.

Xia ruofei laughed and entered the room, locking the door from the inside.

That night, the two of them were naturally very intimate. However, because Ling Xiaotian’s bedroom was also on the same floor, and it was diagonally opposite Ling Qingxue’s room, the two of them had to carefully suppress their voices while they were having the most fun, so as to have a different taste of excitement.

Now that they finally had the chance to be alone, Ling Qingxue naturally wouldn’t waste it. In the middle of the night, the two of them put on their clothes and got out of bed.

Xia ruofei casually set up the time formation and cultivated the “absolute beginning Scripture” with Ling Qingxue for a few more days. Of course, the few days here referred to the time inside the formation. In reality, only a few hours had passed in the outside world.

The two of them only ended their cultivation at four in the morning in the outside world.

This time, both of them had improved, especially Ling Qingxue. It had been a long time since she had felt the joy of her cultivation level rising. She had cultivated the “absolute beginning Scripture” alone, but her progress was relatively slow. Basically, she could only barely maintain her cultivation level and not regress.

If Xia ruofei had not been worried that Ling Qingxue’s body would not be able to take it and wanted to let her rest for a while before the sun rose, she would definitely have been able to cultivate all night.

The two of them soon fell asleep in each other’s arms.

It was close to eight in the morning when the two of them finally woke up. By the time they finished washing up, changed their clothes, and went downstairs, Ling Xiaotian had already finished his breakfast and left for the office.

The housekeeping Attendant, aunt Liu, prepared a sumptuous breakfast for them. At the same time, she conveyed Ling Xiaotian’s original words, saying that he would be going to the company to oversee things, so he would leave after having breakfast and let them have a good rest.

Ling Qingxue’s face turned red and she glared at Xia ruofei.

At that moment, aunt Liu had already left after preparing breakfast for the two of them. Ling Qingxue pinched Xia ruofei’s soft waist and said,””It’s all your fault, it’s all your fault ...”

Xia ruofei chuckled and did not avoid the question. He said,””Didn’t you oversleep? What was there to be embarrassed about? Wife, are you eating or not? I’m about to start eating! We still have to go to the Yacht Club later!”

When Ling Qingxue heard about the yacht, she temporarily forgot about her shyness and sat down to have breakfast with Xia ruofei.

After breakfast, Xia ruofei drove Ling Qingxue to the Yacht Club in his SUV.

Since they did not set a specific time yesterday, Qin Lan had arrived at the Yacht Club early to wait.

She saw Xia ruofei’s flashy off – Road vehicle through the glass wall and quickly walked out to greet him.
