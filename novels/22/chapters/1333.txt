Chapter 1334: An order from his future father – in – Law (2)

Translator: 549690339

All the work had been arranged yesterday afternoon. This group of people set off from Qiantang early in the morning and drove for seven to eight hours to San Shan.

Xia ruofei personally led a few core members of paradise Corporation to retrieve all the Cordyceps from the villa. Then, with both parties present, they weighed the Cordyceps again and sealed it.

He and Lin Zhongming signed and confirmed the transfer of ownership. Then, the people from the escort company took over the batch of expensive medicinal herbs and loaded them into the modified bulletproof small truck.

This transaction was considered complete.

And the payment of more than 100 million Yuan would be transferred to the public account of the peach blossom company by tomorrow at the latest.

The entire process of the transfer was recorded by the people from both companies. After all, it was a transaction that involved hundreds of millions of dollars, so everyone was very cautious.

As for the subsequent transactions involved in the contract, because the amount would be equally large, Tongren Hall would still contact the escort company to complete the transfer of the goods.

Of course, when all aweto was being packaged, it was necessary to have paradise corporation’s LOGO in an eye – catching position to reflect the huge profit. Xia ruofei even placed more emphasis on the increase of brand awareness.

Lin Zhongming attached great importance to this deal. He was also worried and gave up on taking the plane. He chose to take the escort company’s car back and personally escort the car.

Therefore, after the goods were loaded, Lin Zhongming said goodbye to Xia ruofei and left the Paradise company in the small truck.

Xia ruofei watched as the truck carrying the Cordyceps that was worth hundreds of millions of Yuan left Taoyuan farm. Then, he said to Feng Jing,””Boss Feng, please let me know when the funds from Tongren Hall have been transferred to your account.”

“Alright!” Feng Jing nodded.

“By the way, will the other funds arrive on time?” Xia ruofei asked.

“It’s not a big problem!” Feng Jing smiled and said,”a few major online sales platforms have agreed to pay the sales funds in advance. After this sum of money comes back, other than paying for the building, we should still have a balance of 20 to 30 million on our books. We have enough cash flow and our cash flow structure is very healthy!”

Feng Jing was already immune to Xia ruofei’s ability to close a business deal worth more than 100 million Yuan with a flip of his hand and fill up a seemingly impossible financial gap in an instant.

Not only her, but the entire paradise Corporation seemed to have a blind trust in Xia ruofei. It was as if there was nothing that Xia ruofei couldn’t handle.

The company’s development was getting better and better, and the morale of the employees was high.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” Then, after the sales funds have been transferred to my account, I’ll pay for the purchase of the building as soon as possible! There’s no need to delay it for a few more days. In addition, transfer the property rights as soon as possible so that we can make overall arrangements!”

“Understood!” Feng Rao said,”bojun real estate will do their best to cooperate with us. They also hope to settle the payment as soon as possible.”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. He thought for a moment and said,””We’ll have a meeting tomorrow. Everyone will talk about the recent work and the main direction of the next step. In addition, everyone will discuss the sales of pomfrets. You can also understand the market situation in advance!”

“Okay, I’ll inform the sales department to prepare the information!” Feng ke said.

Xia ruofei nodded and yawned.””It’s finally settled. I’m going back to rest. I’ll leave the company to you all!”

Feng Rao was already used to Xia ruofei’s nonchalance. She said helplessly,””I know! You can go back! I’m not counting on you for these trivial matters anyway ...” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Xia ruofei chuckled and cupped his hands at Feng Jing. After thanking her for her hard work, he walked towards the small villa.

Feng Rao smiled bitterly and shook her head. She also turned around and walked into the complex. She urged Xia ruofei to call for a meeting tomorrow. She still had a lot of things to prepare and could not afford to be idle!

......

After Xia ruofei returned to the small villa, he did not immediately take his afternoon nap.

He lit a cigarette and walked to the balcony. He sat on the recliner and planned Zhao Yongjun and the others ‘arrangements for their visit to the three mountains.

Xia ruofei wasn’t close to Hou Liang and the others, but he was good friends with Zhao Yongjun. Moreover, Zhao Yongjun and Hou Liang had put in a lot of effort for the Tongren Hall incident. In addition, the people who came to the three mountains were close to song Rui, so he had to treat them well.

However, Xia ruofei couldn’t figure out why the second and third generation of the Xia family would come to the three mountains in the middle of winter.

Although the three mountains was located in the southeast of China and had been upgraded to one of the new furnace cities of China, it was very cold in winter. It was silly to go to the beach in such weather.

However, apart from the seaside, the three mountains did not have a lot of tourist resources. He could not bring a bunch of second – generation and third – generation children to play on the farm, right?

Xia ruofei was also having a headache.

Of course, with the size of the southeast province, there were many places to visit. For example, Egret Island, which was often more famous than Sanshan and was often mistaken for the southeast province’s capital by foreigners, was a famous tourist city. It was not far from Sanshan. It was a three to four hour drive and only one or two hours by high – speed rail.

“If it doesn’t work, I’ll bring them to live on the farm for a day or two. Then, we’ll kill our way to Egret Island. At the same time, I can also visit Lin Qiao ...” Xia ruofei said in his heart.

Just as Xia ruofei was racking his brain to find a way to deal with Zhao Yongjun and his men, his phone rang.

Xia ruofei looked at the caller ID and a gentle smile appeared on his face. He immediately picked up.”Qingxue, did you miss me?”

On the other end of the phone, Ling Qingxue pouted and said,””I miss you ... The Yangtze River beluga in the farm! Hehehe ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but roll his eyes, but he still asked,””You and uncle Ling tried it? How’s the taste?”

“It’s pretty good!” Ling Qingxue said,”my dad is full of praise, but I think ... It’s mainly because Uncle SU’s cooking skills are good!”

“Tsk! You’re not sincere!” Xia ruofei said,”no matter how good uncle SU’s cooking skills are, without the high – Quality ingredients from our farm, how could he make such delicious food? Even a clever housewife can’t cook without rice!”

“You’re good, alright?” Ling Qingxue said with a smile, then muttered,”aren’t they all raised by your men? You probably don’t even go there once a month, do you?”

“That was also the result of my wise leadership!” Xia ruofei said proudly,”besides, without my high – tech means, do you think you can easily raise the Yangtze River beluga? Do you know how delicate this fish is? You’ll be scared to death if your footsteps are a little heavier ...”

“Is it that exaggerated?” Ling Qingxue didn’t believe him.”Then wouldn’t you have to put the Chinese perch deep in the mountains and forests?”

“I’m doing some soundproofing!” Xia ruofei said,”back then, it was almost made to the standard of a recording room. Even if there was lightning and thunder outside, no movement could be heard in the breeding workshop!”

Then, Xia ruofei asked again,”by the way, did our dad give any advice?” I’m going to start selling the Chinese perch soon. ”

Ling Qingxue giggled.”I don’t have any opinions. However, I do have an order for you to pass on!”

“An order?” Xia ruofei was confused.”What orders does dad have?” I’ll definitely carry it out!”

Ling Qingxue was embarrassed and annoyed,”you keep calling me dad, are you addicted to it?” That’s my dad! It’s not related to you ...”

Xia ruofei was thick – skinned and chuckled.””Isn’t that something that will happen sooner or later? I’ll start practicing now, so that I won’t be unable to say it when I change my name in the future ...”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but burst out laughing. “I’ve never seen such a thick – skinned person like you ...”

She then continued,”I’m not going to joke with you anymore. Let’s get down to business!” My dad said that when this kind of Yangtze River Pomfret is on the market, our Ling Ji restaurant will have to sell at least 300 catties a month!”
