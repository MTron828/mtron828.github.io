2035 The aftermath (1)

It was already oneo’ clock in the morning when they returned to the Hong sect’s branch in Turin.

This rainy night was undoubtedly filled with blood. Xia ruofei had killed more than ten core members of the Gelman family. The Hong sect had taken the initiative to attack the Gelman family. Both sides had suffered casualties. Of course, in general, the Gelman family, who was in a state of panic, must have suffered more losses.

As old Gelman also flew into the sky in the violent explosion, it could be said that the name of the Gelman family had been completely wiped out. The remaining small fish and shrimp, without a leader, naturally scattered. Even if they stayed in Turin, they did not dare to disclose their former identity.

The Hong sect had gained a lot, and they had basically replaced the Geerman family as the most powerful force in the underworld of Turin.

Of course, the Turin police force would definitely increase their control of the Hong sect. The Hong sect needed to stay low for a while to consolidate their territory.

Boxes of various sizes were moved into the meeting room in the small building and stacked neatly together.

Lyu hai and Lyu zhengfeng told the others to leave.

“Mr. Xia,” lui hai said respectfully,”these are your spoils. How do you want to deal with them?”

Xia ruofei replied casually,”Didn’t I tell you?” I’ll take this box, you guys can split the rest! It’s not a bad idea to leave it for your daily expenses!”

In Xia ruofei’s opinion, that half box of world stones was much more valuable than gold, jewelry, and cash. Furthermore, he had already achieved financial freedom. These things were worth a lot, but how could he take them? He couldn’t put them into the spirit map space in front of so many people, could he?

Besides, although the Hong sect had gained a lot of benefits from this trip, especially their power in Turin, which would definitely expand greatly, they were still helping Xia ruofei. He could just take the treasures as compensation for his hard work.

Obviously, lui hai didn’t dare to accept it, so he said hurriedly,””You must not! Mr. Xia, you can’t accept a reward without doing anything! We’ve already killed Turin’s biggest enemy, so how can we take your loot?”

Xia ruofei furrowed his brows and said,”I’m sure many of our brothers were killed or injured in tonight’s operation.” Take out a part of this money to compensate our dead and injured brothers, and leave the rest for your activities!”

After saying that, Xia ruofei didn’t give lui hai and lui zhengfeng a chance to decline, he yawned and said,””Alright, alright, let’s not talk about these small things anymore! I’m tired after a busy night! I’m going to sleep!”

With that, Xia ruofei carried the gray box and left the small meeting room.

Lyu hai and Lyu zhengfeng looked at each other while facing the room full of gold, silver and jewelries.

“What should we do, big brother hai?” Lu zhengfeng asked after a long while.

Even if Xia ruofei did not care about these treasures, Lu zhengfeng did not dare to take them. They were hot to the touch!

“How should I know?” lui hai said with worry.

“If Mr. Xia doesn’t accept it, we can’t take it either! Are we going to throw it away in the river?” Lu zhengfeng said,”why don’t you ... Ask uncle Yi?” We’ll do whatever the old man says!”

“Yes,” lui hai nodded,”that’s the only way ...”

“I might as well make the call now!” Lu zhengfeng said,”the United States is six hours behind us. It’s only about eighto’ clock in the evening now. Uncle Yi shouldn’t be sleeping so early!”

“Alright!” Lui hai said while taking out his phone, finding Li Yifu’s number and making a call. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Of course, Li Yifu didn’t rest. Lui hai had reported to him that Turin was preparing to take action tonight, so he had been waiting for the news.

Li Yifu’s phone rang, and he immediately picked it up.

“Ah hai! How’s the situation?” Li Yifu asked.

“Uncle Yi! Mr. Xia is a God!” Lui hai couldn’t contain his excitement,”he’s invincible, even snipers can’t do anything to him!” We’ll wipe out the entire Gelman family in one night!”

To Li Yifu, this was all within his expectations. He nodded lightly and said,””Uncle Yi didn’t trick you, did he?”

Lui hai scratched his head with embarrassment,””Uncle, we are just ordinary people, how can we imagine the ability of a master like Mr. Xia? I’m a little short – sighted, please don’t make fun of me ...”

On one hand, he wanted to ease his embarrassment, and on the other hand, he needed to ask Li Yifu about the treasures. So lui hai quickly said,””Uncle Yi, there’s still something we don’t know how to do, and we’d like to hear your opinion ...”

Li Yifu suddenly became serious and asked,””Is it related to Mr. Xia?”

“It can be considered so!” Lui hai knew how important Mr. Xia was in Li Yifu’s heart, so he didn’t dare to keep him in suspense. He immediately said,”well, we are in the old nest of the Geerman family ...”

Lui hai briefly told him about the treasures and then asked,””Uncle Yi, it’s a hot potato to hold onto these treasures! But Mr. Xia insists on not accepting it, what should we do?”

Li Yifu also fell into hesitation after hearing this.

Xia ruofei’s words were the Golden Rule for him, but the situation was different.

Li Yifu muttered to himself for a long time before he made a decision and said,””How about this! You can estimate the market value of these items, then take out the money from the Hong sect’s funds and transfer it to Mr. Xia. I will give you the account number! All you need to do is to report the valuation to the headquarters, and I will inform the others! I’ll personally pay the rest to the organization!”
