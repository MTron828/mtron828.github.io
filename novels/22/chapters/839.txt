Gesang pointed to the mountain and said,”Mr. Xia, this is the main production area of Cordyceps in Naqu. That hillside and several mountains in the West are where my father excavates Cordyceps all year round.”

Xia ruofei drove the car off the road and stopped as close to the foot of the mountain as possible. He smiled and said,””Then let’s climb up and take a look!”

Gersun nodded excitedly. He picked up the rope and backpack and led the way.

Soon, the two of them started to climb the hill. The hill at the foot of the mountain did not look very steep, but it was not as flat as Xia ruofei had imagined. With the high altitude, even Gesang, a local, was panting after a while.

However, Xia ruofei did not seem to be affected. His footsteps were still very strong.

At this time, the harvesting season of the Cordyceps had just passed. It was the time for the land to recuperate, for bats and moths to lay eggs and for larvae to hatch. Therefore, there were no other Tibetan people in the entire Cordyceps production area.

There were also fengma flags left behind by the Tibetan people on the hill. This was a unique sight in Tibet. Ever since Xia ruofei entered Tibet, he had seen this kind of white, yellow, red, green, and blue banner on the roadside countless times.

The wind on the mountain was very strong, and these banners fluttered in the wind, looking very spectacular.

While climbing the mountain, gersun breathlessly introduced,”Mr. Xia, you can already find wormgrass in this area, but the altitude here is not high enough, so the quality of the wormgrass is not as good as the ones above.”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”then let’s continue to look up!”

Gesang was speechless. Even he, a local, was so tired that his legs were weak, but Xia ruofei looked as if nothing had happened. He did not even look tired. Her physical fitness was too amazing!

However, since Gesang had agreed to be Xia ruofei’s Guide, and Xia ruofei had paid him in advance for the day before they set off, he naturally had to satisfy his employer’s requirements as much as possible.

Therefore, gersun gritted his teeth and continued to climb.

Gesang said breathlessly,”Mr. Xia, when my father and the other herb diggers were looking for Cordyceps, they had to bend down and climb up little by little. Sometimes, they even had to kneel on the ground. Because the exposed part of the Cordyceps was only a very small tip. Even an experienced herb Diggles would have to be very serious to not miss it.”

When Xia ruofei really arrived at the caterpillar fungus production area, he experienced the hard work of a grass digger. After all, it was rare to find a person with such a strong body like him. Even if the Tibetan people were born and raised, it must be very hard for them to find wormgrass on such a high altitude mountain.

“It’s really not easy!”Xia ruofei said.

“Yeah!” Gersun said. After a day, their legs are painful and numb, and most of the grass diggers have serious rheumatism in their legs, which is caused by kneeling and lying on the ground for a long time to look for wormgrass. ”

Gesang pointed to a small pit not far from his feet and said,””Mr. Xia, you see ... There used to be a wormgrass here. It was found and dug out by a grass digger.”

As he spoke, gersun knelt down and lowered his body. He took out a small shovel from the side of his backpack and carefully dug the soil.”There used to be an Cordyceps sinensis in this pit. After digging it out, the herb diggers would put back some barley and rice with blessings and wishes. This is their special feeling for the land ...”

Xia ruofei took a closer look and saw that there were indeed grains of rice and barley in the pit.

He couldn’t help but feel a little uncomfortable. He had spent so much effort to find the region where the wormgrass was produced. He wanted to simulate such an ecosystem in his space, so he had to take the soil from this place.

This was because only the soil and vegetation here had the most authentic mycelium and bat moth eggs or larvae.

If that was the case, the land would definitely be affected. Although Xia ruofei did not need a large amount and would not destroy the ecosystem here, he was embarrassed when compared to the Tibetan herbalists ‘piety.

Gesang continued to lead Xia ruofei up. Along the way, he explained to Xia ruofei about the plants he had seen. Naturally, they encountered bats and moths along the way. Xia ruofei carefully memorized the looks of the bats and moths. Gesang also carefully avoided the eggs hanging on the grass and leaves.

Before they knew it, the two of them had been on the mountain for three to four hours.

Xia ruofei and Gesang sat on a High Rock to rest. They had mineral water and dry food, and the unique scenery of the plateau was in front of them.

Xia ruofei had a clear understanding of the situation here. The two of them started to descend the mountain after eating.

Gesang also heaved a sigh of relief. He was also exhausted. It was not the first time he came here, but he used to follow his father and other grass diggers. They always moved slowly and stopped every time. After all, they had to dig wormgrass. This time, they had to climb such a long mountain road in one breath, and he felt that it was too much for him.

When they returned to the foot of the mountain, the two of them took their car and returned to Nagqu County.

Xia ruofei dropped gersun off at an alley near his house. He took out 500 yuan and handed it to him.”Gesang, thank you for accompanying me to enjoy the most beautiful scenery of the plateau today. This is your salary.”

“Mr. Xia,” gersun quickly declined.”I was only your guide for half a day. You don’t need to pay so much!”

Xia ruofei smiled and stuffed the money into gersun’s hands. He said,””You’ve worked very hard today. The extra money is my tip to you!”

Xia ruofei saw that gersun was still hesitating, so he smiled and said,””Gesang, this money is not much, you can keep it! I might have to return to the southeast in a day or two. ”

“Ah? Mr. Xia, didn’t you want to tour the Nagqu County?” Gersun asked in surprise.

Xia ruofei said,”I feel like I’ve experienced the authentic Tibetan mountain scenery today. Also, I want to take back the Cordyceps that I bought as soon as possible!”

Xia ruofei waved at Gesang and said,””Gesang, thank you for being my guide. Let’s part ways here! I’ll come to that song again if I have the chance!”

With that, Xia ruofei stepped on the gas and drove away from the alley.

He didn’t return the car but drove straight to the Nagqu hotel. After returning to his room, he went to the bathroom to take a shower, washed away the dust on his body, and then had a good sleep. He didn’t get up in high spirits until night fell.

After an afternoon’s rest, Xia ruofei’s condition had been adjusted to its peak.

He went downstairs to a food stall near the hotel for a Tibetan – style dinner. Then, he returned to the hotel parking lot and picked up the rented Toyota off – Road vehicle before driving out of Nagqu County.

Xia ruofei’s destination was the mountain area that gersun had brought him to this morning.

He remembered the road conditions very clearly and arrived at the foot of the mountain where he had parked his car in the morning without a hitch.

Xia ruofei alighted from the car. He was wearing a windbreaker and hiking shoes. He was dressed professionally, but he did not carry heavy equipment on his back like the other backpackers.

With the spirit map space, Xia ruofei didn’t need anything like a backpack.

With a flip of his hand, a bright flashlight appeared in his palm.

After turning on the flashlight, Xia ruofei started to climb up the mountain along the route he had taken in the morning.

Generally speaking, the quality of wormgrass was better at a higher altitude.

Hence, Xia ruofei was prepared to go to a higher place.

Since gersun was not by his side, Xia ruofei did not have to control his speed. He was almost twice as fast as he was in the morning. After an hour, he had reached the highest point of the mountain.

However, Xia ruofei did not stop. He continued to climb after observing the mountain.

Gesang also said that his father had once reached an altitude of about 6000 meters to dig for wormgrass.

Xia ruofei held a flashlight in one hand and used the other to push away some tall weeds as he continued to climb higher.

After about half an hour, Xia ruofei suddenly stopped and had a strange look on his face.

That was because he suddenly felt that the leaf – shaped jade pendant that he had been hanging on his body seemed to be emitting a warm aura ...
