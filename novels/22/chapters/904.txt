Song Qiming smacked his lips after drinking the white wine in the small glass. Then, he closed his eyes slightly and revealed an intoxicated expression.

Guangzhi Cao and the others were also impressed. Even Fang Liyun and Song Wei, who didn’t usually drink white wine, were also mesmerized by the rich taste of the wine after taking a sip.

After a long while, song Qiming sighed and said,””Good wine ... Ruofei, to think that I’ve been keeping that thirty – year – old Maotai like a treasure! I didn’t expect the wine produced by your own winery to have reached such a level. I think it’s no less than that bottle of Maotai! I think your Drunken Eight Immortals wine is amazing!”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”uncle song, there are only a few jars of this wine. I’ve kept them all. It’s different from the Drunken Eight Immortals that are sold in the market. There’s no comparison.” Whether it’s scale or Foundation, our winery is still far from those big – Name wineries. ”

Song Qiming laughed and pointed at Xia ruofei.””Clear – headed! I believe that if you guys continue steadily, it won’t take a few years for your Drunken Eight Immortals to become a famous brand in China. ”

“Then I’ll have to count on uncle song’s blessings.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Xiao Cao, pour us some wine!” Song Qiming said. There was only a bottle of Maotai just now, so I had to drink it sparingly. There’s no need to drink it now, I have to drink a few more glasses with ruofei!”

Guangzhi Cao immediately stood up and poured wine for everyone.

After the meal, Xia ruofei’s two – pound jar of wine was almost empty. Song Qiming was in a good mood and wanted to drink more, but Xia ruofei quickly stopped him. He said that he could not hold his liquor anymore and that he should save the other jar for him to drink slowly in the future.

Song Qiming thought about it and felt that it would be a waste to drink such a good wine in one go. Besides, he had drunk quite a lot today, so he gave up.

Actually, Xia ruofei was far from drinking enough, but he could tell that song Qiming was almost done. Song Qiming’s voice had increased, and he made some big hand gestures when he spoke. A leader would not do this normally.

Xia ruofei didn’t want to drink too much on their first time drinking together, so he brought up the end of the session.

After the meal, song Qiming pulled Xia ruofei to the living room to make some tea so that everyone could sober up.

Song Wei rested for a while after the meal and took the first pill according to Xia ruofei’s advice.

Xia ruofei sat for a while. Considering that song Qiming had a lot to drink and needed to rest for the afternoon, he stood up and said goodbye.

Song Qiming immediately asked Guangzhi Cao to call the chauffeur team and ask them to send two chauffeurs over to send Xia ruofei back.

In fact, the alcohol at noon did not affect Xia ruofei at all. However, he could not drive under the influence of alcohol in front of the Secretary, so he did not reject song Qiming’s good intentions.

The municipal Party committee’s compound wasn’t far from the villa area of the Standing Committee. Soon, the two drivers arrived at villa number one in a car.

Xia ruofei bade farewell to song Qiming’s family and got into his own Mercedes – Benz. A driver from the municipal Committee drove his Mercedes – Benz, and another driver drove an empty car behind them. Taoyuan farm was more remote so that after they dropped Xia ruofei off, the driver could directly return to the city.

Song Qiming’s family sent them to the door personally. This made the two drivers speechless, especially the driver who drove Xia ruofei. He was even more careful and rarely slammed on the brakes. He drove very smoothly.

After sending Xia ruofei off, song Qiming felt a little sleepy and decided to go back to his room to sleep. He let Guangzhi Cao and Zhang go back to rest and gave them half a day off.

Guangzhi Cao hesitated for a moment, then took a step forward and said in a low voice,”Secretary, I have something to report to you. It’s about Xia ruofei.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Song Qiming was stunned for a moment, then his expression returned to normal. He said indifferently,””Let’s talk in the study!”

Guangzhi Cao wanted to report to song Qiming about what happened at the West River Moon Club that day. He had been hesitating. After all, it was only a verbal conflict that day. There was no need to report such a small matter to the Secretary.

But today, he felt how much song Qiming valued Xia ruofei. Besides, Xia ruofei was treating Song Wei, which made him more important to song Qiming. He thought about it and decided to report it.

The two of them came to the study. Song Qiming sat down and pointed to the chair opposite him.””Sit down and talk! What’s the matter?”

Guangzhi Cao sat down and calmed himself down. He quickly organized his words and said,””Secretary, when ruofei and I were eating at Xi Jiang Yue that day, the child of the organization department’s Deputy Minister Yang, Yang Jianren, had a verbal conflict with him because of the box. Yang Jianren’s words were not very nice at the time ...”

Song Qiming raised his eyebrows and said calmly,””Tell me the details.”

Guangzhi Cao told song Qiming everything he had seen and heard at the West River Moon Club.

Song Qiming didn’t say anything for a long time. Guangzhi didn’t dare to make a sound either. He sat on the chair and looked at song Qiming.

After a long while, song Qiming asked,”do you know ... This yang Jianren?” How is he usually?”
