Chen Xuan personally brought Xia ruofei along the green stone Mountain path to Yun Xiao peak.

The two of them chatted and laughed along the way. From time to time, the passing disciples would stop in their tracks and bow respectfully when they saw Chen Xuan.

Chen Xuan didn’t put on the airs of an elder or the son of the sect leader. He just smiled and nodded at everyone.

“Brother Xia, there are a total of six peaks in the first heaven society. The Yunxiao peak is located in the middle and is personally managed by the sect Masters of each generation. Some of the important places of the sect are basically located on the Yunxiao peak.” “I’ve been living on the Yun Xiao peak since I was young. However, I had my own residence after I grew up.” Chen Xuan explained as he walked.

“It’s easier to live alone!”Xia ruofei laughed.

Chen Xuan laughed and nodded. “He’s indeed more at ease!”

Whether it was in the world of cultivation or the secular world, every child probably had the same mentality when they were young, hoping to be free from the control of their parents. Many children applied for universities far away from home after the college entrance examination, and many of them had the same mentality.

“Brother Xia, my father is quite a kind person, especially towards the young talents in the world of cultivation. He has always been very supportive, so you don’t have to be too nervous.” Chen Xuan chuckled.

“It’s fine ...” Xia ruofei said.”I’m more curious than nervous!” After all, your father is the number one person in the world of cultivation!”

“That’s just a rumor in the cultivation world,”Chen Xuan replied with a smile. My father had said before that there were many hidden experts in the cultivation world. He was only a late – Stage golden core cultivator, so he couldn’t be called the number one expert in the cultivation world. In any case, we can’t say this in the heavenly sect, including the so – called number one sect in the world of cultivation. We’ve never really considered ourselves the number one sect, in case it gets out and becomes a laughingstock. ”

“You’re being too humble!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s hard to say whether your father is the number one in the cultivation world, but the first heaven society’s strength is obvious to all. In terms of overall strength, there are almost no sects in the cultivation world that can compete with the first heaven society!”

“You’re too kind! You’re too kind!” Chen Xuan laughed as he waved his hand.

The two of them moved very quickly, and in a short while, they arrived in front of a Chain Bridge.

Xia ruofei looked up and saw five steep peaks in the Misty Valley. The one in the middle was the highest, and the other peaks were scattered around like stars surrounding the moon.

Each peak was connected to the middle Peak by a Chain Bridge.

Xia ruofei looked at the Chain Bridge in front of him and realized that he was actually on one of the peaks.

Thus, there were six peaks in total.

As expected, Chen Xuan stood at the end of the bridge and introduced with a smile,””Brother Xia, we’re currently at the blue cloud Peak. This is the only peak that can be reached directly after entering the mountain Gate. Most of the ordinary disciples cultivate and live within the blue cloud Peak’s range. This Chain Bridge leads to Yun Xiao peak. Brother Xia, please!”

“Brother Chen, please!” Xia ruofei made an inviting gesture and stepped onto the Chain Bridge with Chen Xuan.

A steel cable as thick as an arm connected two mountains. After stepping on the bridge, Xia ruofei immediately felt like he was floating in the air.

The wind in the valley was usually stronger, and as long as a gust of wind blew, the Chain Bridge would sway.

Furthermore, the Chain Bridge did not have any special railings. There was only a steel cable on each side as a basic protection. The wooden boards under his feet were not solid, and there were many gaps between them. He could directly see the valley that was faintly visible in the clouds.

If it was an ordinary person, they would probably feel weak in the legs and tremble in fear after walking on this Chain Bridge.

However, Xia ruofei would not do that.

Not to mention that he was already an Aurous core stage cultivator and could ride a flying sword anytime. Even before he started cultivating, when he was serving in the Army, he had experienced much more dangerous environments than this. His mental fortitude had long been trained.

On the swaying Chain Bridge, Xia ruofei’s expression was relaxed and he walked steadily.

Naturally, Chen Xuan had no problem with that. He introduced the basic situation of Yun Xiao peak to Xia ruofei as they walked.

In addition to the residence of the sect leader, there was also a very important elder meeting hall. Basically, all major decisions in the first heaven society were made on Yun Xiao peak.

In addition, there was also an ancestral hall of the heavenly sect, where the memorial tablets of the previous sect Masters and elders would be worshipped.

Very quickly, the two of them crossed the Chain Bridge that was two to three hundred meters long and arrived at Yun Xiao peak.

At the other end of the Chain Bridge, about 20 to 30 meters away from the top of Yun Xiao peak, there were disciples who were specially assigned to guard Yun Xiao peak, which was an important place in the first heaven society. Naturally, it was not a place that anyone could enter.

Even some high – Level disciples had to ask for permission before they could enter Yun Xiao peak.

Of course, Chen Xuan was not one of them. He brought Xia ruofei to the end of the Chain Bridge. The disciples guarding the Chain Bridge immediately bowed and greeted him.”Greetings, young sect leader!”

“Sect leader, are you free now?” Chen Xuan asked.

“Young sect leader, the sect leader has ordered that when young sect leader and this young master Xia arrive, they can go directly to the meeting hall. He is waiting there.” The disciple replied respectfully.

“Meeting hall?” Chen Xuan was taken aback for a moment, and a look of surprise appeared on his face. However, he quickly regained his composure and replied,”I understand.”
