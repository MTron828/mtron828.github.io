Translator: 549690339

“Sure!” Song Wei said after some thought. I saw that you brought two tents and thought that you were going to camp in the wild!”

“That’s just in case we need it!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I didn’t know that this ancient tomb was so close to the county. Of course, I had to prepare everything.”

“Then let’s go find a hotel first!” Song Wei said with a smile. I’ll slowly draw the rest of the draft when I get to the hotel. I’ll try to make it as complete as possible!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said,”I’m counting on you!”

Xia ruofei drove to Hualin County. He found a place to stop and searched for local hotels on his phone.

The economy of this small county in Hunan Province was not very developed. Naturally, there were no five – Star luxury hotels in this County.

In fact, the best hotel here was only a three – Star hotel. Xia ruofei opened one of the hotels called Grand Hotel and found that there was a Presidential Suite on the list. The room price was only 800 to 900 Yuan. He could not help but feel shocked.

Xia ruofei clicked on it to read the details and laughed. It turned out that this “Presidential Suite” was equivalent to a family room. It had a living room and two bedrooms, which could accommodate up to four people.

His heart skipped a beat. This room was quite suitable.

As this was the location of the ancient tomb of the Ming Dynasty, Xia ruofei naturally wanted to leave as little traces of his presence as possible. It would be best to use the fake identity card that he had prepared before moving in.

Each ID card could only get one room. The room had its own bedroom, which was enough for him and Song Wei to stay in at the same time.

“This is the place!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Then, he booked the room on the internet and opened the navigation system. He entered the name of Tianhao hotel and began to plan the route.

Song Wei was also curious and came over to take a look. Xia ruofei smiled and explained the “Presidential Suite” to her. Song Wei could not help but giggle.

At the same time, she also had a faint anticipation in her heart. Although there were two separate bedrooms, did this count as the two of them staying in the same room in the hotel?

Song Wei’s face heated up at the sudden thought.

Xia ruofei didn’t notice Song Wei’s awkwardness. After planning the route, he started the car and drove towards the Tianhao hotel.

“Song Wei, wait for me in the car, I’ll check in!” Xia ruofei said to Song Wei after they arrived at the Tianhao hotel.

The hotel’s system was connected to the Public Security Bureau’s network. Xia ruofei’s fake ID had cost a lot of money, so there was no problem in passing the verification. However, if the two of them went to the front desk to check in, the hotel must register their ID information. Otherwise, it would be troublesome if they were found out.

If only one person went to register, they would naturally turn a blind eye. As for how many people would go to stay in the end, the hotel couldn’t care less.

That was what many of the couples who went to the hotel did.

“Alright,” Song Wei nodded.

Xia ruofei opened the door and got out of the car. He smiled at Song Wei and said, “I’ll send you a WeChat message after I’m done. You can go to your room directly! Don’t move our things, just leave them in the car!”

Song Wei felt a tinge of excitement in her heart. She smiled and said,””I know, you should go!”

Xia ruofei waved at Song Wei and walked into the Tianhao hotel.

At the front desk, his fake ID card was not exposed. After showing the online room booking information, he used this ID card to check in and got the room card.

Xia ruofei walked straight to the elevator and sent a WeChat message to Song Wei.””Fourth floor, room 8418. I’ll go up first!”

Song Wei could not help but smile when she received Xia ruofei’s message. She took her bag and took out the car keys from the driver’s seat. She got out of the car, locked the car and walked into the hotel.

She took the elevator to the fourth floor and found room 8418 very quickly. The door was left ajar.

Song Wei knocked on the door lightly and heard Xia ruofei’s voice from inside.””Come in!”

Stepping on the soft carpet, Song Wei walked into the ‘Presidential Suite’. As soon as she entered, she found herself in a small living room. There were two doors on both sides of the living room, leading to two bedrooms.

Xia ruofei was holding an electric kettle to get some water. He turned to look at Song Wei and said with a smile,”Of the two bedrooms, one is a big bed, and the other is a double bed. Ladies First, you can stay in the master bedroom with the big bed!”

Song Wei did not stand on ceremony with Xia ruofei. She turned around and closed the door. She smiled and said,”Alright! Then I’ll go and draw the sketch first!”

“Alright! You’ve worked hard!” Xia ruofei took the water and went to the entrance. He placed the electric kettle on the seat and started to boil the water.

Xia ruofei looked at Song Wei, who was drawing a sketch on the coffee table in the living room. He smiled and said,”Pour the water yourself after it’s done boiling! I’ll go back to my room and take a shower!”

“En!” Song Wei said without raising her head.

Xia ruofei smiled, walked into his bedroom, and locked the door.

After entering the bedroom, Xia ruofei immediately released his spiritual force and scanned the entire room to make sure that there were no hidden cameras installed. The security of a small hotel like this was not very good. Who knew if someone had secretly installed a pinhole camera or something?

Fortunately, everything was normal in the room. Xia ruofei heaved a sigh of relief.

He walked over to check if the window was locked. Then, he drew the two curtains. He took a deep breath and summoned gupu’s spirit painting scroll from his palm.

Under such circumstances, Xia ruofei would never take out the spirit map scroll, let alone enter the spirit map space.

But since Xia Qing had specifically made this suggestion, he had to go in no matter what.

Xia ruofei placed the painting on the bed and went to the bathroom to turn on the shower head. Then, he returned to the bed and disappeared into thin air with a thought. Only an ancient painting was left on the bed.

If Song Wei were to see this, she would probably be so scared that her face would turn pale.

In order to prevent any accidents from happening, Xia ruofei even specially asked Xia Qing to pay attention to the outside world through divine sense. As breaking the seal required full attention, he couldn’t split his divine sense to be on guard.

He requested Xia Qing to inform him at once if there was any movement in the outside world, regardless of whether he was at a critical moment in breaking the seal or not.

No matter what, safety was the most important. The spirit painting was Xia ruofei’s top secret.

After giving Xia Qing some instructions, Xia ruofei disappeared in a flash and reappeared in the cave in the mountain sea realm. He didn’t have much time to look at him, as time passed at the same rate in the mountain sea realm as the outside world. A man wouldn’t take too long to take a bath.

Xia ruofei’s eyes fell on the three green light shields on the stone platform.

Two Jade tablets and a small Jade box were lying there quietly, waiting for their owners to come and get them when their cultivation was strong enough.

Xia ruofei walked straight to the seal where the earth character was. He took a deep breath and closed his eyes, adjusting himself to his best state.

After a long while, Xia ruofei suddenly opened his eyes. Two rays of determination shot out from his eyes. He gently pressed his palm on the protective Halo. At the same time, his spiritual power was circulating madly. He continuously mobilized the invisible spatial force and gathered it in his palm.

As soon as Xia ruofei’s palm touched the seal, he felt a strong repulsive force.

He snorted and stood there without moving an inch, quickly stabilizing his position.

After a while, Xia ruofei’s hand slowly but firmly pressed in. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Under the effect of the invisible spatial force, the light on the seal of the earth character jade talisman became even brighter, and the entire transparent protective cover seemed to be trembling ...
