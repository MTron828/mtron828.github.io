3165 Super computer (2)

Wang Chi felt that Xia ruofei was worth his time and effort to befriend, which was why he did this. Otherwise, let alone a storage card, even if it was an official Paradise Club membership card, it wasn’t something that they needed. There was no need to be so enthusiastic!

“You’re welcome! You’re welcome!” Wang Chi chuckled and said,”I’ll let you know if I have any news! You just need to be prepared. ”

“Alright, alright!” Xia ruofei said.

After Wang Chi hung up the phone, Xia ruofei told Chen Xuan and the rest about the situation. Everyone was very happy.

There were still three days left, so Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan did not have to be in such a hurry.

They could easily check the algorithm program and even try to run a small sample in a home computer environment to check if there were obvious logic errors in the algorithm.

At the same time, Xia ruofei called the private jet paradise to prepare for its flight to the capital city in three days. At the same time, he applied for a flight route from the capital city to new Wu city in advance.

If Wang Chi accompanied them to the Supercomputing Center at new Wu, Xia ruofei and the rest would not be able to take the airboat.

Moreover, Wang Chi was getting on in years, so he had to make his travels as comfortable as possible.

At this time, a luxurious private jet would be very useful.

Hearing that Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan had finished writing the algorithm, Mu Sheng and the others came over.

However, everyone, including Song Wei and Ling Qingxue, could not understand the dense code on the screen.

“Little brother Xia, can we crack the secret of the token with this?” Mu Sheng asked hesitantly.

Xia ruofei smiled;”of course, it’s not that simple. First of all, brother Chen and I need to check the algorithm further to make sure that there are no major problems.; In addition, it needs to be run on a supercomputer, and the supercomputer will crack it. ”

“Speaking of which ...” Chen Xuan asked,”brother Xia, can you contact the time of the supercomputer now?”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” It’s good to confirm it in advance. Let’s check the algorithm again and again. I think it will only take one or two days. ”

If it were an ordinary programmer, it would be impossible for them to finish checking such a complex algorithm in one or two days. It was also impossible for an ordinary programmer to write this algorithm in such a short time.

However, Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan were different. One to two days was more than enough for them.

After Xia ruofei finished speaking, he took out his phone and dialed Wang Chi’s number.

The phone rang a few times before Wang Chi picked it up. He laughed heartily and said,””President Xia! Are you looking for me to discuss a problem or something related to the supercomputer?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. Academician Wang was a straightforward person.

He said,”academician Wang, I do want to trouble you to contact them. Can you help me find some supercomputer time ...”

Wang Chi chuckled.”I’ve always been very concerned about your matters. I’ve been helping you contact people these past few days.” Speaking of which, your luck is pretty good. I was thinking that it would be good if I could coordinate with the timing of the Tianhe No. 1 or the Tianhe No. 2. I didn’t expect the result to be better than I expected ...”

“Oh?” Xia ruofei’s eyes brightened.”Could it be the light of Taihu territory?” he asked.

“Hahaha! President Xia is indeed smart! I guessed it right!” Wang Chi said with a smile,”it’s just that if we use God’s power to build the light of Taihu territory, we need to go to new Wu city. I wonder if it’s convenient for you, director Xia?”

“Convenient! Of course, it’s convenient!” Xia ruofei quickly said.

The light of Taihu territory was one of the top supercomputers in Huaxia, and it was ranked in the top three in the world. This supercomputer was developed by the National parallel computer Engineering Research Center and installed in the National supercomputer, Xin Wu Center. That was why Wang Chi said that to use the light of Taihu territory, one had to go to Xin Wu city.

From Xia ruofei’s perspective, he naturally hoped to use the best supercomputer.

And the light of Taihu territory, which was supported by Shen Wei, was obviously the best choice.

It should be known that this supercomputer only took four hours to complete the calculation task that “Tianhe No. 2” would take more than 20 hours to complete in the testing of the supercomputer’s standard program.

This meant that its computing speed was far superior to the previous “Tianhe No. 2″ supercomputer.

Xia ruofei quickly asked,”academician Wang, is Shenwei in a hurry to build the light of Taihu territory?” Can you really free it for us to use?”

Wang Chi did not answer Xia ruofei’s question directly. Instead, he asked,””How long do you think it will take?”

Xia ruofei pondered for a while and calculated in his heart. He didn’t expect to have the opportunity to use the divine power to support the light of Taihu territory, so he didn’t estimate the time.

After a while, Xia ruofei said,”it’d be best if it can last for ten hours. If it doesn’t work, eight hours will do!”

“Swish!” Wang Chi shouted,”your thing ... Has such a large computational ability?”

“Is it hard to coordinate?” Xia ruofei asked,”if we really can’t do it, let’s settle for the second best?”

“There shouldn’t be any problems!” Wang Chi said,”however, you will have to wait for three days. I will inform you after I confirm the specific time of use. Also ... I’ll accompany you to new Wu. If there’s really not enough time, I’ll help you coordinate on the spot!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel touched. Wang Chi’s favor was too big.

What if there wasn’t enough time and the algorithm they wrote was only halfway through? If Wang Chi accompanied him, this problem would be easily solved. With his reputation, he could still delay the matter for a while.

“Thank you so much!” Xia ruofei said sincerely,”academician Wang, we will take care of the transportation and accommodation problems. You just need to let me know the exact time!”

“Alright!” Wang Chi laughed and said,”don’t take it to heart, Mr. Xia. I have something to do at the new Wu Supercomputer Center anyway. I’ll help you guys coordinate your in – Flight schedule!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”no matter what, you’ve done us a great favor!” Thank you so much!”

Wang Chi was helping Xia ruofei with all his might not only because of the 30000 Yuan storage card. As an academician, he wouldn’t do anything for 30000 Yuan. It was mainly because Wang Chi could see that Xia ruofei was different from the rest. These details included the leader who invited him to the exchange meeting a few days ago, Zhao Yongjun, song Rui, and the others ‘attitudes towards Xia ruofei.

Wang Chi felt that Xia ruofei was worth his time and effort to befriend, which was why he did this. Otherwise, let alone a storage card, even if it was an official Paradise Club membership card, it wasn’t something that they needed. There was no need to be so enthusiastic!

“You’re welcome! You’re welcome!” Wang Chi chuckled and said,”I’ll let you know if I have any news! You just need to be prepared. ”
