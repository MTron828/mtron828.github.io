3322 A terrifying illusion (2)

Xia ruofei gasped for breath as he looked at the scene.

Immediately after, the earth trembled slightly, and everything in the house began to twist. To be more precise, the space became twisted.

Except for Xia ruofei, who seemed to be unaffected, all the other objects were twisted at a strange angle.

After a few seconds, Xia ruofei felt his vision blur. The garden disappeared, the winding path disappeared, the pond, the flower bed, the pavilion, and the bridge disappeared one by one.

Then, Xia ruofei seemed to have experienced the shifting of the stars and appeared on a sand dune.

Xia ruofei panted as he looked left and right.

He found that his environment had suddenly become an extremely hot desert. Looking around, there was yellow sand in all directions, and he couldn’t see the end at all.

Xia ruofei was surrounded by sand dunes that extended into the distance. From afar, they looked like waves, which was a spectacular sight.

He also felt the heat all of a sudden. This extreme heat was not any lower than the desert on earth. It was as if his breath was hot.

In all fairness, the desert environment was really different from the comfortable garden just now.

However, Xia ruofei felt more at ease.

He felt that he must have passed the test of the illusion, and only now could he see the true appearance of the trial Pagoda’s third floor.

What he had just experienced in the courtyard was like torture from hell to Xia ruofei.

He was unscathed, but he had killed more than 20 of his closest family and friends. Even if they were all illusions, they looked exactly the same as real people because of the illusion. This was a huge blow to Xia ruofei’s heart.

Xia ruofei knew that if he couldn’t control himself at any moment, he might really become a hysterical lunatic.

Now it seemed that he had passed the test of the illusionary realm.

Both of Xia ruofei’s feet were stuck in the sand. He was not in a hurry to get up. Instead, he sat down and adjusted his breathing. He had used up a lot of energy just now. Now that he had really entered the small space of the Tower of Trials ‘third level, he might be in a dangerous environment. Naturally, he had to seize the time to recover.

If Xia ruofei was not a cultivator, he would not be able to withstand the heat of the sand. He would definitely be so hot that he would cover his butt and jump up.

“Congratulations, you have successfully passed the test of the illusory formation. You can now begin your journey on the third level of the Tower of Trials ...” A female voice said.

The voice was a little mechanical, similar to the intonation of a machine reading subtitles.

Xia ruofei was slightly stunned, but he quickly closed his eyes and continued to adjust his breathing until he was in his best condition. Then, he strenuously pulled out his feet and jumped on the qushuang flying sword. After a moment of silence, he chose a direction based on his feelings and flew straight in that direction.

Xia ruofei’s top priority now was to find the companion who had been randomly selected and sent to the same small space.

Of course, it would be best if the companion was Ling Qingxue.

Xia ruofei, you will control the qushuang flying sword and fly in one direction.

With the experience in the second floor of the Tower of Trials as a warning, Xia ruofei did not dare to fly recklessly. He kept his altitude low so that the qushuang flying sword was flying close to the desert.

Standing on the flying sword, Xia ruofei could see the desert stretching forward as if it had no end.

He couldn’t help but feel worried. This was only one direction, so one could imagine how big the third floor of the trial Pagoda was.

It was extremely difficult to find a single person in such a large area!

Furthermore, Xia ruofei had to be on guard against any possible danger, such as lizards and rattlesnakes that could survive well in the desert.

If these terrifying people were to hide under the sand and attack Xia ruofei by surprise, he would be in deep trouble.

Xia ruofei was at his wit’s end but he could not find any shortcuts. He could only use the stupidest method to search bit by bit.

However, after flying for more than ten minutes, he actually saw a small black dot in the distance. This small black dot should also be moving, but not as fast. It was also heading in Xia ruofei’s direction.

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. Then, he could not help but release his spiritual power to check. He could not see Jian Jia clearly with his naked eyes. He could not even see if the black dot was a person.

However, there was nothing in the desert to block his vision, so his field of vision was very far. Even though he could see the black dot, Xia ruofei was still very far away from the moving black dot. Even his spiritual power could not cover such a large area.

Xia ruofei urged the qushuang flying sword to fly at full speed in the direction of the black dot.

As they got closer, Xia ruofei could see more clearly that the black dot was probably a person.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel excited, but at the same time, he was a little nervous.

He was excited because he had finally met someone, and this person was “summoned” by him, so he still felt a sense of accomplishment. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

He was nervous because he was worried that the person who would be sent to this trial space wouldn’t be Ling Qingxue. After all, this was only a one in eight chance.

Xia ruofei continued to fly toward the black dot on his flying sword.

As they got closer, Xia ruofei could finally see clearly Xuxu’s light yellow T – Shirt with a bow at the bottom. The pair of blue jeans accentuated the curves of her legs perfectly. She was wearing a pair of brown high – Top Martin Boots.

Xia ruofei couldn’t suppress his excitement because it was really Ling Qingxue’s outfit.

He was a little worried about his personal gains and losses, because the probability of one in eight wasn’t that high. Ling Qingxue had actually been matched with him, and this was something he couldn’t believe.

But seeing was believing, and Xia ruofei had no choice but to believe.

In fact, the qushuang flying sword had been flying at full speed. Very quickly, Xia ruofei caught up to the small black dot and finally saw the Kasaya clearly.

This person was Ling Qingxue!

Xia ruofei was very excited, but at the same time, he felt worried.

Because he saw that as Ling Qingxue was moving forward, a few giant lizards were chasing after her.

No wonder Ling Qingxue kept moving. She was in danger.

Xia ruofei flew to Ling Qingxue’s side on his sword and shouted,””Qingxue! Run this way!”

Ling Qingxue looked up at Xia ruofei and smiled in surprise. She said loudly,””RUO Fei! You’ve really come to save me!”

Xia ruofei shouted,”don’t be nervous. Run at full speed!” Their speed isn’t too fast, so you just need to maintain this speed and don’t get stuck in the sand!”

Xia ruofei shouted as he rode on the qushuang flying sword and chased after them.

Finally, he caught up to Ling Qingxue. The flying sword of the twisted frost had already made a beautiful arc in the air as it flew towards the giant lizards.

...

Ling Qingxue merely grabbed Xia ruofei’s hand. She panted as she said,””Ruofei, I’m so tired! I was still looking for the Star Beast just now, but I suddenly teleported here, what’s going on?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I was the one who brought you here. This is the third level of the trial Pagoda!” Don’t worry! With me by your side to protect you, you definitely won’t have any problems with your safety!”

“I saw this giant lizard the moment I came out! I was almost scared to death!” Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”RUO Fei, where have you been? Why can’t I see you after I entered the secret realm?”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”Me too. I couldn’t see you once I entered. You don’t know how worried I was.”

At this moment, the female voice rang out again,””Congratulations to the two of you for entering the third level of the Tower of Trials. I’ll now announce your mission!”

When Xia ruofei heard the voice, his heart skipped a beat. He raised his eyebrows and an idea came to his mind ...
