Chapter 1754: Qingxue goes to the capital (1)

In the evening, Zhao Yongjun and the others gathered at the courtyard in liuhai Lane.

Zhao Yongjun was the last to arrive. He had gone to Beihe province to visit a senior in the field of metaphysics. He had personally invited him to participate in the groundbreaking ceremony of the Paradise chapter. When he received Xia ruofei’s notice, he was on his way back to the capital.

As soon as Zhao Yongjun arrived, song Rui said,””Ruofei, since brother Zhao is here, you should at least tell us why you called us back, right?”

“You guys arrived long ago?” Zhao Yongjun asked with a smile.

“Isn’t that so?”song Rui said, a little depressed. However, RUO Fei kept me in suspense and only told me when everyone is here!”

“Oh?” Zhao Yongjun raised his eyebrows and asked,”ruofei, what’s so mysterious?”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”good news!” Please wait a moment!”

After saying that, he turned around and walked into his bedroom. It didn’t take long for him to bring out the long paper box.

“What is it?” Song Rui was the most impatient and could not help but step forward to take the paper box.

Xia ruofei pushed his hand away and said,””Don’t move! If you break it, you won’t be able to afford it!”

Xia ruofei opened the paper box with his own hands and took out the piece of calligraphy. He spread it out slowly and held the two sides of the paper in his hands to show it to everyone.

“The inscription of the peach blossom gathering?” Zhao Yongjun muttered to himself.

Then, he trembled violently, his eyes fixed on the inscription at the end of the line, his expression extremely shocked.

When Xu Zi Xuan, Liu Jian and the rest saw elder song’s signature, they were also dumbfounded.

Song Rui’s expression was the most interesting. He looked as if he had seen a ghost, his face full of disbelief.

After a long while, Zhao Yongjun asked in a trembling voice,””Grandpa song specially mentioned this to our paradise gathering? RUO Fei, are you an imposter? Why would an old man like him care about such a small matter?”

Song Rui also came back to his senses and said bitterly,””This is my grandfather’s handwriting. Yesterday, I went back to the old residence and my grandfather asked us about the details of this project, including the name of the Paradise society. I was also the one who told him ... But what I find strange is ...”

Song Rui looked at Xia ruofei and asked,””Why didn’t my Grandpa write it for me directly yesterday? he wrote it after I left and gave it to RUO Fei! What kind of situation was this! Who’s his real grandson?” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Everyone almost burst out laughing when they heard song Rui’s words.

Zhao Yongjun patted song Rui’s shoulder and said,””Xiao Rui, I can see how much of a failure you are. Learn more from ruofei!”

Zhao Yongjun didn’t dare to tease the old chief about his blood relationship, but it didn’t stop him from taking the opportunity to attack song Rui.

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He could only comfort her.”Song Rui, don’t overthink it! Maybe it was after you left yesterday that the Bureau chief decided to write inscriptions for us! After all, this was a clubhouse project. The chief must be very cautious! “This afternoon, manager Lu happened to be going to the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference to handle some matters, so he brought it along ...”

Song Rui’s expression improved a little, but he still said gloomily,””He could have called me! I can get it myself!”

“Alright, Xiao Rui!” Zhao Yongjun said,”we were originally working on this project together. Isn’t it the same whether it’s you or ruofei?”

Xia ruofei also said,”let’s talk about serious business!” The Bureau chief’s inscription is a huge encouragement to us ...”

This point was without a doubt, didn’t you see that right now Xu Zi Xuan and the others “faces were still red, each and every one of them still dazed and had not recovered!

Xia ruofei continued,”I was thinking, aren’t we designing the of paradise gathering?” Why don’t we just use the Bureau chief’s personal inscription for the !”

“That’s not appropriate, is it?”Zhao Yongjun said subconsciously.

From his point of view, elder song’s inscription was more of an encouragement to the younger generation. They would at most hang the words in the office of the Paradise Association. Wouldn’t the chief be displeased if they used the chief’s inscription as the symbol of the Paradise Association?

This time, even song Rui wasn’t sure. He asked with uncertainty,””Ruofei, can ... Can my grandfather’s handwriting be used so casually?”

In fact, manager lü had already hinted that since elder song had given Xia ruofei this calligraphy piece, he didn’t care how they used it. It didn’t matter if it was used as the club’s .

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”don’t worry!” The chief wouldn’t mind! By the way, who’s the company in charge of plane design?”

“Brother Xia, it’s me!” Wei Jun quickly said.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I think we should do it this way.” Take this to the design company tomorrow and design a few more versions based on elder song’s inscription. Right, just use the main three words, don’t need the signature behind ...”

They had to prepare different versions of the same to meet the requirements of different occasions, such as horizontal, vertical, 3d, and so on ...

Zhao Yongjun and the others heaved a sigh of relief when they heard Xia ruofei’s words.

Only the main part of the inscription was used, and there was no need to sign off. This was much more low – Key.

Although elder song’s handwriting was so distinctive that many people in the upper – Class circle could recognize it at a glance, at least ordinary people couldn’t recognize it.

The matter regarding the peach blossom Association’s design was settled just like that.
