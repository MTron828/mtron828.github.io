Chapter 1687: Chinese Kungfu (3)

After he finished speaking, he even made a bow step, stretched out his right hand and hooked his finger, and made a “ah da” sound.

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. So this person was a fan of Bruce Lee.

The other members of the investigation team also felt that the investigator’s words made sense. After all, Eastern Huaxia was too mysterious in the eyes of foreigners like them, especially Chinese Kungfu, which had been exaggerated by a lot after being rendered by some classic film and television works.

Of course, only director li was skeptical. After all, he knew very well about the state of the martial arts in China. Two years ago, wasn’t there a mixed martial arts athlete who went everywhere to challenge the Masters of the famous sects? Moreover, he won easily, which meant that the effectiveness of Chinese martial arts had weakened a lot.

But no matter what the investigators thought, Xia ruofei had already told them the answer with facts. At the same time, he had also cleared the name of the Airbus company. It was not that their planes were of poor quality.

The entire experiment was recorded and would be filed as investigation data.

The debate over the cockpit door naturally came to an end.

“Professor Aris, can I leave now?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Of course!” Ayres quickly replied. Mr. Xia is free to begin with. Thank you very much for helping us complete this experiment. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””I have my contact information at Quto. If there’s anything else you need my cooperation with, you can call me. Of course, that’s if I’m still in Australia ...”

“Alright! Alright!” “Thank you, Mr. Xia!” Aris said.

The investigation team still had to do a Professional Identification of the cockpit door. Alex quickly got a shuttle bus over and sent someone to accompany Xia ruofei and Feng Jing to go through the immigration procedures.

After successfully passing through the customs, Xia ruofei flew to the staff of Quto to express her gratitude. They shook hands and bade farewell.

“Ruofei, this golden – haired beauty from qplease airlines is very enthusiastic about you!” Feng Rao said with a smile. And his eyes are full of admiration!”

“That’s her job, okay?” Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”Sister ran, let’s go out!” We’ve been delayed for two days, but we’ve finally reached Australia!”

“Don’t worry, I’ll take a picture for you!” Feng Rao smiled.”After so many twists and turns, we finally landed in Australia. Shouldn’t we leave a memento?”

Xia ruofei thought about it and agreed. He said,”Then let’s take a photo together!”

“I’ll take a solo shot for you first!” Feng Rao smiled and said,”come! Handsome, make a more handsome pose!”

Xia ruofei had no choice but to cooperate with Feng Jing and smile at the camera.

With a click, Xia ruofei’s image was fixed on the camera. The background was the busy Kingsford Smith Airport.

Then, the two of them took a few more photos before they dragged their luggage to the exit.

Xia ruofei didn’t notice that Feng Jing was fiddling with her phone as she walked and then sent the photo ...

As they had taken a public jet here, and they didn’t know how long the weird experiment would take, it was hard to estimate Xia ruofei’s time, so he didn’t let Liang qishao come to pick them up.

The two of them took a taxi at the airport and went straight to the Hunter Valley.

Although Feng Jing had traveled to many places, this was her first time in Australia. Hence, she was in high spirits as she enjoyed the beautiful scenery along the way.

Xia ruofei, on the other hand, was bored as he swiped his phone to pass the time. After all, he had been here a few times. Although he was not tired of aesthetics, at least he did not feel too novel.

Last night, the Paradise corporation’s promotion was very successful. Because the quantity was relatively sufficient, many netizens who usually couldn’t get the jaded skin cream successfully bought it yesterday. Some people were even lucky enough to get a 20% discount voucher, which was even more affordable.

Xia ruofei also wanted to see the netizens ‘reactions, so he opened the official Weibo of the Paradise Corporation out of habit.

He glanced at the Weibo post that had just been posted a few minutes ago, and the expression on his face suddenly became very interesting. He couldn’t help but exclaim,””Sister Che! You’re too unkind!”
