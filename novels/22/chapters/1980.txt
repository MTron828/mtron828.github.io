1981 Cleaning up inventory (1)

The media in Hong Kong and mainland China were talking about the peach blossom company’s auction, and Feng Jing was immersed in her work as soon as she got off the plane, mainly dealing with media interviews.

There were simply too many media outlets that had invited him for an interview, so the company’s publicity department had no choice but to screen them again and again. Many media outlets also requested to interview Xia ruofei, but Feng Jing had to turn them down. Although they really wanted Xia ruofei to be interviewed, Xia ruofei was hiding in Hong Kong and did not mention returning to the three mountains.

In addition, the pharmaceutical factory’s project was progressing very quickly. Although Xue Jinshan was keeping an eye on the whole process, Feng Jing was also worried and would ask about the progress from time to time.

Everyone was extremely busy. Xia ruofei spent the weekend with Huanhuan at Disneyland in Hong Kong.

Hong Kong’s paparazzi were famous for their pervasive presence. Now that Xia ruofei’s reputation had risen in Hong Kong, there were even paparazzi camping at Hengfeng Jiahua Hotel. In order not to affect the mood of going out and having fun, and at the same time, to protect Huan Huan, some paparazzi had no integrity and did not care about the privacy of minors. Xia ruofei did not want Huan Huan to be exposed to the media at such a young age. This would affect the safety of the MA family in the future. Hence, Xia ruofei had specially put on some makeup before he left.

When Xia ruofei was in the Army, disguising and investigating was a compulsory course.

After obtaining the Jade talisman inheritance of the peach Garden space, it was even easier to change one’s appearance. There were several ancient books in the inheritance that recorded the methods of using cultivators to change one’s appearance.

In fact, to cultivators, this was just a small trick. As long as they slightly controlled the movement of some facial muscles, coupled with some special skills, the whole person’s temperament and appearance would be completely different. People who were not particularly familiar with them would not be able to recognize them at all.

It was strange. After Xia ruofei’s makeup, even Ma Zhiming and Tian Huixin were amazed. They could not believe that a person could change so thoroughly. However, Huan Huan didn’t feel that it was strange at all. She was still very close to Xia ruofei as if the change in Xia ruofei’s appearance didn’t affect her natural closeness to him.

Xia ruofei carried the masked Huanhuan and walked out of the hotel entrance. The paparazzi who were waiting did not recognize him at all. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Huanhuan had a great time the whole day. She had taken the Ferris wheel five or six times. If it were not for the fact that the roller coasters and jumping machines were too exciting and had an age limit, she would have tried it.

However, she was still too young and could only watch the roller coaster full of adults ‘screams with envy.

The two of them had lunch at Disneyland. In the evening, Xia ruofei left Disneyland with Huanhuan. He brought her out for dinner before sending her home.

Xia ruofei promised Huan Huan that he would take her to the Ocean Park the next day. The little guy finally let Xia ruofei fly back to the hotel.

Back in the Presidential Suite of Hengfeng Jiahua Hotel, Xia ruofei took a nice bath and then took out his phone to call Li Yifu.

“Senior granduncle!” Li Yifu answered the phone immediately and said respectfully.

“Foster husband, are you still in Hong Kong?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Senior granduncle, I have been waiting at Hengfeng Jiahua Hotel, waiting for your notice!” Li Yifu said respectfully.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”come to the suite on the top floor.” I have some time tonight. If you have any doubts about cultivation, you can ask me!”

He had not been able to take care of Li Yifu for the past two days, and he felt a little apologetic.

Li Yifu wasn’t dissatisfied at all. Instead, he was pleasantly surprised and quickly said,””Alright! Senior granduncle! This disciple will come up now!”

Xia ruofei greeted the Butler of the Presidential Suite, Tony, and soon, Tony led Li Yifu into the suite.

“Mr. Xia!” Li Yifu greeted Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei nodded and said to Tony,””Tony, you go first! Mr. Li and I have something important to discuss. If there’s no special emergency, don’t come and disturb us!”

“Alright!” Tony bowed slightly and left the Presidential Suite.

As soon as the door was closed, Li Yifu immediately showed a respectful expression and took a step forward.””Disciple greets martial granduncle!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”you’re welcome!” Sit down!”

“Thank you, grand uncle – Master!” After Li Yifu sat down, he looked at Xia ruofei expectantly.

Xia ruofei said,”if you have any problems with cultivation, just tell me!” I’ll try my best to answer your questions!”

“Yes!” Li Yifu said respectfully.

After that, he impatiently raised some of the questions he had encountered during his cultivation.

Basically, whenever Li Yifu asked a question, Xia ruofei would answer it without thinking. He spoke non – stop and Li Yifu was intoxicated by his words.

Time passed by unknowingly.

When Li Yifu was still unsatisfied, Xia ruofei said,””Let’s call it a day! It won’t be easy for you to digest if I say too much. First, thoroughly understand what I’ve said tonight. You may encounter new problems in cultivation, and I’ll answer them all at once!”

Li Yifu stood up and solemnly bowed to Xia ruofei.””Senior granduncle has given this disciple a new lease on life, this disciple is ashamed and actually did not repay it! In this life, this disciple swears to follow senior granduncle! Even if I have to go through fire and water!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”what do I have that requires you to go through fire and water?” As long as you cultivate properly, that will be the best way to repay me! Now that you’re the only one left in your branch, I also hope that the sect can grow stronger and stronger!”
