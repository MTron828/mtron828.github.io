Chapter 798: Another Meritorious Service (2)

More importantly, the investigation report didn’t mention that the murderer had a gun!

She was very confident in her skills, so she chased after him relentlessly. The worst thing was that she didn’t even have time to call the police station for help.

Moreover, this place was a little remote, so no one might pass by even after half a day ...

Scarface’s feigned fear had long since disappeared, and in its place was a ferocious smile.

His pair of triangular eyes stared at Qin Xiao Yu and sneered,””So it’s really the cops! You guys are really persistent! I’ve already run to the three mountains hundreds of kilometers away, and before I could take a break, I’ve been targeted by the cops again ...”

Qin Xiao Yu’s pretty face was a little pale, her white teeth gently bit her lower lip, staring at Scarface and asked,””You’re Huang Chunhua?”

Scarface had a gun in his hand, so he nodded fearlessly.”Yes, I’m Huang Chunhua! Little girl, you can go on your way in peace now?”

Qin Xiao Yu’s expression changed slightly and she called out,””Huang Chunhua, killing a police officer is a capital crime! Don’t make the same mistake again! If you come back with me and turn yourself in, you’ll still have a chance to be treated leniently!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Huang Chunhua laughed hysterically and said,””Death penalty? The crimes I’ve committed are enough to be shot eight times! What’s the big deal with killing one more police officer? Little girl, if you want to blame someone, blame yourself! If you didn’t chase after me, wouldn’t everything be fine?”

Huang Chunhua’s eyes were filled with killing intent as she placed her finger on the trigger.

Qin Xiao Yu’s heart trembled, she knew very well that Huang Chunhua had long been filled with killing intent.

Huang Chunhua was a demon who killed without blinking. He would not hesitate to open fire the next moment.

Qin Xiao Yu closed her eyes in despair.

......

She was a top student at the People’s Public Security University of China and came from an illustrious family. It wouldn’t even be an exaggeration to say that she was a proud daughter of heaven.

She didn’t expect that she would die in this foreign land at such a young age, Qin Xiao Yu couldn’t help but feel sad.

However, there was no gunshot.

Instead, Qin Xiao Yu felt a gust of wind blowing past her, and Huang Chunhua let out a heart – wrenching scream.

She quickly opened her eyes and saw a Black Dog coming out of nowhere. It was biting Huang Chunhua’s right hand that was holding the gun. Huang Chunhua was brought to the ground by the dog, and the gun fell to the ground in pain.

Huang Chunhua screamed and struggled with all his might. The Black Dog bit Huang Chunhua’s wrist tightly. It looked like it had bitten deeply, and Huang Chunhua’s hand was covered in blood.

Qin Xiao Yu was stunned by this sudden turn of events, but she was indeed a top graduate of the People’s Public Security University of China, so she quickly came back to her senses.

Qin Xiao Yu quickly stepped forward and kicked the gun away. Then, she grabbed Huang Chunhua’s hair and hit his carotid artery with her right hand.

Huang Chunhua was suddenly attacked by the Black Dog and was still in a state of panic, he did not have time to take any precautions. Qin Xiao Yu’s attack was successful and she knocked Huang Chunhua out.

Qin Xiao Yu secretly heaved a sigh of relief, feeling that her luck was just too good.

In such a situation where death was certain, a dog had appeared out of nowhere. Not only had it saved his life, but it had also helped to catch this murderer.

Many girls were afraid of dogs and Qin Xiao Yu was also a little scared. She was also worried that this dog was so fierce that if it continued to bite, Huang Chunhua would die from blood loss. That would be too easy on this murderous demon.

Just as Qin Xiao Yu was about to gather her courage and try to communicate with the Black Dog, the Black Dog actually let go of its mouth very humanly, wagged its tail at Qin Xiao Yu and ran away.

Qin Xiao Yu’s mouth was agape, but in the end, she didn’t say anything. She didn’t think that she could communicate with a Black Dog, and the most important thing now was to control Huang Chunhua.

Therefore, Qin Xiao Yu did not have time to look for the Black Dog for the time being. She went straight to Huang Chunhua, skillfully pulled out Huang Chunhua’s belt, and tied his hands tightly behind his back.

Then, Qin Xiao Yu immediately took out her phone and called the police station to inform them of the situation here. She asked the police station to send support to bring Huang Chunhua back immediately.

Then, Qin Xiao Yu took out a piece of tissue and covered the handstand of the pistol, carefully picking up the gun with Huang Chunhua’s fingerprints on it. It could not be destroyed as these were all physical evidence.

At this moment, Qin Xiao Yu heard a voice behind her,””Officer Qin, what a coincidence!”

Qin Xiao Yu turned around and saw a pickup truck had driven up behind her. Xia ruofei was peeking his head out from the driver’s seat and looking at her with a smile.

Qin Xiao Yu looked at Xia ruofei warily and asked,””What are you doing here?”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”my company’s warehouse is right in front. Why can’t I be here?” As for officer Qin ... What’s the situation? Catching a thief?”

“None of your business!” Qin Xiao Yu snorted coldly.

Xia ruofei clicked his tongue and said,”officer Qin, it seemed very dangerous just now!” Is this person pointing a gun at you?”

Qin Xiao Yu’s expression froze and she asked subconsciously: “”You ... You saw everything?”

Then Qin Xiao Yu came back to her senses and immediately said: “”Why are you asking so many questions when the police are handling a case? If there’s nothing else, hurry up and leave! Don’t let me find evidence of you committing crimes!”
