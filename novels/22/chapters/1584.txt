“Song Wei, are you coming back to the farm with me first, or are you going home?” Xia ruofei asked,”if you’re going back directly, we’ll send you off first.”

After returning to San Shan, he had to be more careful. After all, song Qiming was the official in charge of the city. Song Wei’s identity was also more sensitive. If he was not careful, he would be seen by someone with ill intentions.

This was also the reason why Xia ruofei had asked ye Lingyun to pick him up personally. Ye Lingyun was someone he trusted absolutely and was very tight – lipped, so he would not spread the news.

Although Song Wei really wanted to return to the farm with Xia ruofei, she still knew when to stop.

It would be fine if he visited the farm normally, but he had just returned from a foreign land. If he went to the farm directly instead of going home and was noticed by people with ulterior motives, it would inevitably lead to suspicion.

If people knew that she had gone out with Xia ruofei alone for more than ten days, it would be even easier to arouse all kinds of speculations.

Hence, Song Wei pondered for a moment and said,””I’d better go back directly! I haven’t been home for so many days ... You don’t have to send me back to the city, just find a place where it’s easy to get a taxi on the way. ”

Xia ruofei had also considered sending song Wei back with a pickup truck. It did not seem to make sense. Song Wei had flown back from another city. If she did not ask her family to arrange for a car to pick her up, she should have taken a taxi.

He thought for a moment and said,”I still have to do it. How about this ... I’ll make the arrangements.”

Xia ruofei took out his phone and dialed pang Hao’s number.

“Boss Xia, Ling Yun sent a car to the airport this afternoon. Are you back?” As soon as pang Hao picked up the phone, he complained,”you’re really good! Leaving behind such a big stall and running away to have fun for more than ten days ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and scolded,”why are you so full of complaints?!” By the way, has pingzi reported to work?”

“I’ve been reporting to the company since the seventh day of the new year,” Pang Hao said,”that kid still wants to start from the bottom, but according to your instructions, the company has arranged a project team leader position for him, under the e – commerce Department.”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”sure. The e – commerce business will grow. Although it’s a little tiring, it can train people. It’ll be easier to promote him in the future ...”

After asking about Guanping’s situation, Xia ruofei went straight to the point.””Little fatty, are you driving to work today?”

“Of course, I’ve been up since seven in the morning ...” Pang Hao said.”I’m looking forward to moving to the new headquarters in the city as soon as possible. It’s really too painful to wake up early every day!”

Xia ruofei ignored pang Hao’s complaints and said,””Give Lei Hu a call and ask him to drive your car to the intersection between our farm and the National Highway. I want to borrow your car.”

After pang Hao earned some money, he quickly got his driver’s license and bought a Volkswagen Bora. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The car was not eye – catching. Besides, with the development of online car – hailing, Song Wei would not attract much attention if she took this car back. Hence, Xia ruofei decided to commandeer pang Hao’s car.

“No problem! I’ll make the arrangements immediately. ” Pang Hao said.

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei said to Song Wei,””I’ll send you back later!”

Song Wei was overjoyed because she could spend more time with Xia ruofei. She nodded her head.

The airport and Tao Yuan farm were both located in Changping County, not far from each other. It didn’t take long for the car to reach the intersection leading to the farm.

A white Volkswagen Bora was parked at the intersection, and Lei Hu stood beside it.

The pickup truck stopped slowly beside the Bora, and Xia ruofei and Song Wei got out of the car.

“Hu, I’ll take over director pang’s car. You can go back to the farm with Ling Yun!” Xia ruofei said to Lei Hu.

“Alright, brother Xia!” Lei Hu replied.

Xia ruofei leaned on the window of the passenger seat and said to ye Lingyun,””Ling Yun, help me move my things to the second floor of the mansion when we get back. Get a few more people. It’s quite heavy!”

“Alright!” Ye linyun grinned.

Ye Lingyun had the spare key to Xia ruofei’s Villa. Xia ruofei would often be away for many days. Ye Lingyun was the one who helped to feed the fish and the dogs.

After Xia ruofei gave ye Lingyun some instructions, he went into pang Hao’s Volkswagen Bao’ Lai with Song Wei.

The car drove towards the city. Along the way, Song Wei was not as active as she had been in the past few days. She seemed to be in low spirits.

Xia ruofei knew the reason for Song Wei’s low spirits, but he did not say anything. He could only find a light topic and chat with her on the way.

Half an hour later, Xia ruofei stopped the car by the road.

“Song Wei, the municipal committee’s family housing area is just around this corner. There are a lot of people there, so I won’t drive there. You can take a few more steps ...”

“Alright!” Song Wei said.

She opened the car door and took a step out. Then, she turned to Xia ruofei and said,””RUO Fei, what should I do with my cultivation in the future?”

Xia ruofei pondered for a moment and said,”I can come to the city to look for you. You can also go to the farm under the name of visiting. We have the time formation. We don’t need to interact too much. We can still cultivate.”

“But my school is about to start.” Song Wei said,”although the postgraduate curriculum is not very tight and it’s easy to take leave, my parents will definitely be suspicious if I stay in Sanshan for no reason and not go to Beijing ...”

“Is that so ...” Xia ruofei frowned, then relaxed again and smiled.”That’s fine. I’ll be going to the capital for a while soon. I have something to do there.”
