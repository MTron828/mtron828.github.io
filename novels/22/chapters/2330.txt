2331 The situation is optimistic (2)

“It’s going well!”Professor Chen said excitedly. The dynamic encephalon monitor shows that Secretary song’s brain waves have basically returned to normal. Judging from various indicators, everything is developing in a good direction, and it is still getting better!”

“That’s great ...” Fang Liyun could not help but Mutter.

She had been under too much pressure these few days. Ever since she rushed to the hospital after finding out that song Qiming was in trouble, she had not left the building. She was in constant fear every day and did not even have the appetite to change her clothes. If this had happened in the past, it would have been unimaginable for her, who was graceful and elegant.

“Professor Chen, if that’s the case ... Can you transfer uncle song to a normal Ward?” Xia ruofei asked. It’s more convenient for family members to visit and take care of her!”

There were rules in the intensive care unit. Normally, visiting hours were only half an hour a day. Although Fang Liyun and Song Wei could get some extra care, they could not stay in there for long. After all, there were other critical patients in there.

Professor Chen hesitated and said,””Mr. Xia, how about ... We observe him for a few more days? The equipment in the intensive care unit was more complete, and the response in case of an emergency was faster. If we go to the general ward ...”

Every bed in the intensive care unit was equipped with advanced life – Support equipment and monitoring equipment. In addition, emergency equipment such as a defibrillator was also always available. There was even a bedside X – ray machine and other examination equipment. The cost of each bed plus the standard equipment would reach hundreds of thousands, which was incomparable to the cost of ordinary wards.

Even if it was a Ward for senior cadres, at most, the living conditions would be better, but the medical equipment in it would not be much better than that in a normal Ward.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s okay, I’ll always be by uncle song’s side.” And ... I believe that uncle song will wake up soon. There’s no need to keep using up the medical resources. ”

If someone else had said that, professor Chen would have refuted it. However, Xia ruofei had been personally greeted by the head of the headquarters. More importantly, he was his “little uncle”. Professor Chen would not dare to show his face in front of Xia ruofei. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

In addition, Xia ruofei’s treatment of song Qiming had shocked professor Chen greatly. It was an eye – opener.

With this layer of Halo, Xia ruofei’s words more or less carried the authority of an “expert”.

Professor Chen hesitated for a moment before he nodded and said,””If that’s the case ... Fine! However, we still need to do a comprehensive assessment of Secretary song before he is transferred to the general ward. ”

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile and said,””No problem! Then I’ll leave it to you, professor Chen!”

The estimated time for the examination was a little long. After all, it concerned song Qiming’s safety, and the General Hospital did not dare to delay.

It was time for lunch. It was normal for doctors to work overtime and miss lunch. However, considering Ge Jun’s age, professor Chen arranged for a student to take Ge Jun, Xia ruofei, Fang Liyun, and Song Wei to the hospital cafeteria for lunch.

When they came back from the meal, the check – up had been completed. It was done by professor Chen himself.

Naturally, the results of the examination showed that song Qiming was qualified to be transferred to a normal Ward.

Not only that, but professor Chen was also surprised to find that song Qiming’s external injuries, especially his brain injuries, were recovering much faster than expected.

In fact, in the past few days, the General Hospital had not taken any substantial measures in terms of treatment. It was nothing more than the use of instruments to maintain breathing and heartbeat. The drip was also glucose, nutrient solution, and so on, which were needed to maintain life energy.

Now, not only was song Qiming’s brain injury recovering at an incredible speed, but even the fractures and contusions on his body were recovering much faster than normal.

Naturally, professor Chen also attributed this to Xia ruofei. He was even more amazed.

Under professor Chen’s arrangement, song Qiming was quickly transferred to a Ward for senior officials on the 15th floor.

It was a small suite. Other than the patient’s room, there was also a room for the caretaker so that Fang Liyun and Song Wei could take care of song Qiming.

Although they couldn’t be of any help in the treatment, they were completely different psychologically.

If their relatives had experience in the ICU, they should be able to understand that feeling. On the one hand, those who were in the ICU were generally in a more critical condition, and their family members ‘hearts were hanging. On the other hand, the doors of the intensive care unit were closed most of the time, and the people outside had no idea what was going on inside. Moreover, the visiting hours were extremely short every day, which intensified the anxiety.

Now, Fang Liyun and Song Wei were able to stay by song Qiming’s side and they knew that his condition had improved greatly. He was much better than before.

Professor Chen had also brought over some emergency equipment that was not usually equipped in the general ward in case of emergency.

After song Qiming had settled down on the bed, Xia ruofei went over to check his pulse.

“Professor Chen,” he said.”There should be a Chinese medicine room in the General Hospital, right?”

“Of course!” Professor Chen said.
