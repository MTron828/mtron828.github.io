Translator: 549690339

It took time for the spirit map space to absorb the world stone. Xia ruofei kept the small excavator into the space and left it alone for the time being. After all, Xia Qing would tell him when he was done absorbing the world stone.

Xia ruofei followed the sound of the water and found the stream. Then, he took off his coat that was stained with wolf blood and washed up. He took out a spare coat from his backpack and put it on.

If he returned to Nagqu County covered in blood, wouldn’t the hotel staff be so scared that they would call the police?

Xia ruofei cleaned himself up and left the valley.

The sky was already bright. Xia ruofei had been exploring the area for the whole night and was quite familiar with the terrain. He quickly planned the most reasonable route and started to retreat down the mountain.

Xia ruofei had spent most of his time walking around the area last night. It took him less than an hour to go down the mountain and he was already back at his car.

Xia ruofei drove the off – Road vehicle back to Nagqu County. After checking out of the car, he went online to buy a train ticket back to Lhasa. Then, he rested in the hotel room for a while. When it was almost time, he checked out and rushed to the train station.

On Xia ruofei’s way to the train station, Xia Qing had already informed him through spiritual will that the spirit map space had already absorbed the entire world stone.

However, with Xia ruofei’s current condition, it was obviously not suitable for him to enter the space to check it out. He also did not want Xia Qing to tell him what changes the space had undergone after absorbing the world stone. At this time, he still had to maintain a sense of mystery. Otherwise, when he went in to check it out again, he would not have that pleasant feeling.

Xia ruofei had already booked a direct flight from Lhasa to Sanshan city. However, there was only one flight per day. By the time the train arrived at Lhasa, it would not be able to catch the day’s flight. Hence, Xia ruofei had booked a ticket for the next day. He had no choice but to stay in Lhasa for another night.

In the hotel in Lhasa, Xia ruofei suppressed his curiosity and did not enter the spirit map space for the sake of safety.

The next afternoon, Xia ruofei’s flight landed smoothly at the Changping International Airport in Sanshan city. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

This trip could be said to be a long one, but the result was still not bad. It could be said that the harvest was quite rich.

Lin Yue ‘E’s family had agreed to come to the three mountains, and the journey to the song had gone very smoothly. Xia ruofei had completely achieved his expectations. More importantly, Xia ruofei had even obtained a pleasant surprise by finding a world stone.

If it wasn’t for the aweto, Xia ruofei might not have been able to go to Nagqu in his entire life. He would have missed the opportunity to obtain the realm stone.

Perhaps it was the will of the heavens. The realm stone that had been buried in the frozen soil of the plateau for God knows how long had finally reached Xia ruofei and was put to use.

Xia ruofei had already informed the company in advance. Hence, when he walked out of the airport terminal, Lei Hu was already waiting at the entrance to pick him up.

Lei Hu came forward and greeted Xia ruofei respectfully. Then, he took his luggage, which was not much to begin with.

On the way back to the farm, Xia ruofei briefly understood the company’s situation. After knowing that everything was normal, Xia ruofei nodded and leaned back in his chair, closing his eyes to rest.

Back at Taoyuan farm, Xia ruofei did not go to the office building. Instead, he went straight to the small villa.

Lin Qiao was still interning in the company, so the Tibetan – style gifts that Xia ruofei had prepared for her had not been used yet.

Hu Zi’s mother was preparing lunch at home. When she saw Xia ruofei return, she was very happy.

“RUO Fei, why didn’t you tell us you were coming back?” Hu ‘Zi’s mother reproached,”I should’ve prepared a few more dishes!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”godmother!” I’m not an outsider, do I need to prepare anything? Besides, as long as it’s godmother’s cooking, I love it!”

“You’re such a sweet talker ...” Hu Zi’s mother said with a smile.

“Godmother, don’t be busy!” Xia ruofei took out a packet of Cordyceps from his backpack as he spoke.”These are some Cordyceps that I bought from Nagqu. It’s good for your body to eat a little every day. Just soak it in water and drink it.”

These were the level 1 wormgrass that Xia ruofei had bought at Gesang’s house two days ago. He had spent more than 100000 Yuan on them. In the eyes of ordinary people, they were extremely valuable. However, Xia ruofei had only bought them casually to confirm the quality of the wormgrass in Gesang’s house. Hence, he had taken them as a gift for Hu Zi’s mother when he returned.

“This is aweto? This thing must be very expensive, right?” Hu Zi’s mother reproached,”you child ... Why are you wasting money again? Godmother’s health is great now, she doesn’t need any supplements!”

Xia ruofei chuckled as he stuffed the packet of worm grass into Hu Zi’s mother’s hands and said,””Godmother, I bought this from the wormgrass production area. It’s not expensive at all. This is my filial piety!”

“Alright, alright! You’re not allowed to waste money like this next time!” Hu Zi’s mother said.

Even though she said that, she still felt very happy that Xia ruofei was so filial.

“I know! Godmother, I’ll go up and take a shower first!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Mm! I’ll call you when it’s time to eat!”

Xia ruofei carried his backpack and quickly went upstairs to his room.
