Ling Xiaotian immediately revealed an awkward expression. Xia ruofei wanted to laugh, but he did not dare to. He was having a hard time holding it in. He said in his heart,”it seems like this uncle Ling is just like what Qingxue said, he’s crazy about fish!” Ling Xiaotian knew that Xia ruofei would definitely give him the pair of blood red Dragons. Ling Qingxue had already said that this was a gift that Xia ruofei had prepared for him! However, his heart was still as uncomfortable as a cat’s paw, and he couldn’t help but take the initiative to ask. “Dad, can’t you be a little more promising?” Ling Qingxue said with a smile. “Qingxue, how can you talk to uncle Ling like that?” Xia ruofei quickly said. He then turned to Ling Xiaotian and said,”uncle Ling, those blood red Dragons were specially prepared by Qingxue and I as a meeting gift for you. They’re currently being raised by my friend!” How about this, I’ll pick it up today and send it to your house tomorrow morning?” Ling Xiaotian waved his hand and said,”hey, little Xia. I was just asking. There’s no hurry!” Just bring it over whenever you’re free!” Xia ruofei was slightly stunned. Wasn’t he so eager just now? Why aren’t you in a hurry now? However, what Ling Xiaotian said next almost made Xia ruofei burst out laughing. Ling Xiaotian quickly asked,”RUO Fei, how long are your blood red Dragons?” I have to get the fish tank ready first! By the way, Qingxue, remember to remind me to buy some small fish and prawns tomorrow morning. Blood red Dragons are very picky with their food, so I have to choose them myself!” Ling Qingxue immediately laughed and nodded. Xia ruofei also came back to his senses. His future father – in – Law was just being polite! They had already started to make preparations to take over the Blood Red Dragon the next morning. Xia ruofei did not know whether to laugh or cry. Considering that Ling Xiaotian’s company still had many things to do, including the reopening of the closed stores and the sorting of the accounts, Xia ruofei got up and left after a short chat. The finance department that Ling Qingxue was in charge of was the Department that had been affected the most today, so she naturally had to stay in the company. However, Ling Qingxue still personally sent Xia ruofei out. Now that their relationship had been made public and Ling Xiaotian had agreed, Ling Qingxue had less to worry about. She held Xia ruofei’s arm and walked out with him. Naturally, they attracted a lot of attention along the way. Ling Qingxue’s face was slightly red, but she still held Xia ruofei’s hand tightly. “Qingxue, I think I can hear the heartbreak of the male employees in your company ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “Nonsense!” Ling Qingxue pouted. Xia ruofei said exaggeratedly,”how could it be nonsense?” Oh ... Could there be female employees? I can’t believe that my wife’s beauty has already reached the point where both men and women are attracted to her! This is too crazy ...” “You’re a bad guy!” Ling Qingxue bit her red lips and said,”do you think I won’t pinch you?” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh out loud, which attracted the envious gazes of many employees. Ling Qingxue walked Xia ruofei all the way to the first floor. “Qingxue, you should go back! There’s still a lot of work waiting for you to handle at the company!” Xia ruofei said. “En!” Ling Qingxue reluctantly said,”drive slowly then!” Xia ruofei grinned and said,”got it!” Thank you for your concern, wife!” Ling Qingxue rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei, but she did not correct him for taking advantage of her verbally. Instead, she walked up to him and hugged him gently. She looked into his eyes and said,””Ruofei, thank you!” “Wife, why don’t you give me some actual thanks?” Xia ruofei smiled and pointed to his face.”You know ...” Ling Qingxue’s face turned red. She looked left and right, then quickly stood on her tiptoes and kissed Xia ruofei lightly on the lips. Then, she ran away with a red face. Xia ruofei chuckled. He had only wanted to kiss her face, but he ended up kissing her on the lips instead. He had exceeded the task! Xia ruofei savored the faint fragrance on his lips as he went to the underground parking lot to find his Knight XV off – Road vehicle and drove back to the farm. When he reached home, Xia ruofei entered the spirit map space and transferred the two Blood Dragons, which had grown to nearly 50 centimeters, into a plastic container. He then dripped some low – Concentration flower petal solution into it. It was a quiet night. The next day, Xia ruofei woke up early to wash up. Then, he tidied up his hair and carefully shaved his beard. He found a suit and changed into it. This was the Brioni suit provided by the hotel when he went to the truffle auction in Shen Cheng city. It was the best suit Xia ruofei had and cost as much as 5000 US dollars. Xia ruofei usually did not care much about his appearance and would not deliberately pursue international brands. He had never bought such a high – end formal suit before. This was the first time he was going to pay a formal visit, so Xia ruofei naturally had to dress formally. Just as Xia ruofei was about to go downstairs, he suddenly stopped in his tracks. Other than these blood red Dragons, should I bring some other gifts? It was his first time visiting his future father – in – Law. Should he bring some cigarettes, wine, tea, fruits, and so on? When he thought of wine, Xia ruofei suddenly had an idea. Last time, he bought 25 big jars of Drunken Eight Immortals white wine, a total of 5000 catties. It must have been stored in the medium for a few months. He wondered how the taste was now. With this thought in mind, Xia ruofei was not in a hurry to go out. After locking the door and windows, he summoned the spirit painting scroll from his palm and entered the medium. He went straight to the place where the wine jars were placed, and casually opened the mud seal of a large wine jar and removed the lid. Suddenly, the fragrance of wine assailed his nose. Xia ruofei could clearly feel that this fragrance was much stronger than when he had first bought it. He picked up a ladle and scooped out some white wine from the jar. He brought it to his mouth and took a small sip. Immediately, the rich aroma of the wine filled his entire mouth. What was rare was that the originally choking drunken eight immortal had now disappeared without a trace. The mellow and smooth taste was even better than those high – end white wines on the market that cost one to two thousand Yuan. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smacked his lips and resisted the urge to drink a few more mouthfuls. He poured the remaining wine in the spoon back and sipped it for a while. He still had to drive. It was fine to take a small sip but he couldn’t drink too much. Xia ruofei decided to bring some good wine to his future father – in – Law. He had ordered a lot of small porcelain bottles before. The last time he treated elder song, he used the same kind of porcelain bottle to bring the petal solution with him. There were still many empty bottles in the interspace. Xia ruofei immediately went to get three. However, he didn’t take the wine from the opened wine jar. Instead, he went to the wine jar that he had marked and opened the mud seal. When he opened the lid, he saw that this jar of wine was mixed with an entire exotic flower petal. If he wanted to give it to his future father – in – Law, he naturally had to give it the best. Besides, this jar of wine was 200 catties. Xia ruofei didn’t feel any heartache at all for carrying two to three catties. He took a wine ladle and a funnel to fill three bottles of “exquisite space wine”. Then, he restored the wine jar to its original state, found the space soil and water from the pool to seal it again, and then left the spirit map space in a flash. When Xia ruofei went downstairs, ye Lingyun had already prepared breakfast. After breakfast, Xia ruofei informed ye Lingyun and left the farm in his Knight XV SUV, heading straight for Ling Xiaotian’s Riverside mansion.
