Chapter 1400: You’re done singing, I’m on stage (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei looked and quickly said,”everyone!” Everyone! There seems to be some news over there! You guys should head over first! President Feng and I can’t run away. We’ll definitely be interviewed after the press conference ...”

The reporters hesitated for a moment. They seemed to think that Xia ruofei’s words made sense. Their colleagues had already stood up. They did not want to miss out on any valuable news in the end. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Hence, they quickly smiled and bade Xia ruofei and the others farewell before leaving.

“Chairman, are you really going to accept their interview later?” Feng Rao said with a smile.

“With our beautiful President blocking the fire, wouldn’t it be easy for me to escape?” Xia ruofei smirked.”I think these reporters are your ‘static electricity’!”

Feng Jing pouted and wanted to hit Xia ruofei. However, she immediately realized that they were in a public place. Not only were her colleagues sitting behind her, but there were also many media reporters!

So, she stopped and glared at Xia ruofei.””It’s all your fault!”

Back then, if Xia ruofei had not insisted on her appearing on screen, she would not have become an “internet celebrity” for no reason. Although she did not like to shop like other girls, and Tao Yuan farm was located in a remote area, she rarely had the opportunity to go out other than when she needed to work, her life was still inevitably affected.

Just like today, as long as she appeared in public, it was inevitable that she would be chased by reporters. She really didn’t get tired of it.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Sister che, you can make a living with your looks, but you insist on taking the path of a strong woman. You’re making it so that those who don’t have good looks have no way out!”

Feng Rao’s face turned red and she said,”I can’t be bothered to talk to you ...”

Xia ruofei laughed as he teased Feng Rao. His attention was also drawn to the reporters ‘seats.

Many media reporters had already stood up and left their seats, walking towards the entrance.

Feng Rao also noticed this and couldn’t help but ask,””What happened?”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”who knows!” Ignore them!”

Just as the two of them were guessing, a person walked into the venue surrounded by media reporters.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh when he saw this. It was an old acquaintance who was teasing the southeast province’s Deputy Director of the Food and Drug Administration, he kun. He was the leader of the southeast province’s Drug Administration, and he kun was in charge of the Chinese Medicine Department.

For such a leader to attend a company’s drug conference without a care for suspicion, it was no wonder that the reporters were like cats that smelled blood and all swarmed over.

“Bureau chief he, may I ask why you are attending the conference of the new drug by the Tao Yuan pharmaceutical factory?”

“Bureau chief he! Are you representing yourself or the provincial Drug Administration?”

“Bureau chief he, what do you think of the new drug from Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory?”

He kun had a kind smile on his face. Even though the microphone was almost pointing at his face, he still didn’t take it to heart. However, he kept his mouth shut and said,””Friends of the media, today’s star is Tao Yuan pharmaceutical factory. It’s factory manager Xue, I’m only here to attend the ceremony!”

Although the reporters did not dare to ask too many questions because of he kun’s official identity, anyone with eyes could understand the meaning between the lines. They wanted to know what special relationship he kun had in private. Otherwise, why would he kun attend the press conference with such a sensitive identity?

He kun’s avoidance of the question made the reporters ‘imaginations run wild. Even if some content media did not dare to report it, self – Media was so developed now. Who didn’t have a few Weibo accounts?

Wasn’t it a simple matter to post it online?

However, what they didn’t know was that he kun had come here today on behalf of the Food and Drug Administration. The only reason he didn’t say anything was that he didn’t want to steal the limelight from Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory.

He kun quickly noticed Xia ruofei and the others. His eyes lit up and he said,””Dear reporters, please make way. After the press conference ends, I will be accepting interviews. Now, please return to your seats!”

He kun had been in a high position for a long time, so he still had some momentum. These reporters, who were called uncrowned Kings, were still people of the system. Their questions just now were already a little presumptuous. Now, they naturally did not dare to stop he kun, so they all made way for him.

“President Xia, long time no see. You’re still as elegant as ever!” He kun walked over quickly and said with a big smile.

Xia ruofei also stood up and shook hands with he kun. He smiled and said,””Bureau chief he actually came to our press conference in person. I’m a little flattered!”

“No, no, no!” He kun quickly said humbly,”your company’s new medicine is a great service. It’s only right for me to come and support you!” Our chief li just happened to be in the capital for a meeting today, otherwise he would have attended it himself. ”

Xia ruofei didn’t know who chief li was, but from he kun’s tone, he was most likely one of their leaders.

The media reporters who often read Medical News knew very well who he kun was talking about, and they could not help but be shocked.

Regardless of whether the meeting in Beijing was real or just an excuse, since he kun had said so, it meant that director li attached great importance to the Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory.

The reporters had some bad guesses in their hearts, but now they began to question their own judgment.

Xue Jinshan had accompanied he kun here. Everyone was familiar with each other. When they had gone to the capital for Yangxin soup, he kun had personally gone with Xia ruofei to the capital.

Later on, through layers of approval, Xue Jinshan had often dealt with he kun.

He arranged for he kun to sit next to Xia ruofei and said with a smile,””Director he, please take a seat and rest for a while. The press conference is about to begin.”

He kun laughed and said,”factory manager Xue, go do your work!” I’ll talk to President Xia for a while!”

“Alright!” Xue Jinshan said.

At this moment, a staff member hurried over and whispered a few words to Xue Jinshan.

Xue Jinshan’s expression changed slightly. He hurriedly excused himself from he kun and walked towards the entrance.

The media reporters seemed to have also received some news and followed him out.

Seeing this, he kun let out a sigh of relief and said,””The reporters have finally left ...”

Xue Jinshan had been standing beside Xia ruofei just now. With Xia ruofei’s hearing, he had naturally heard what the staff member said.

He laughed and said,”yes!” Someone has diverted their attention, so director he can relax a little. ”

“Oh?” He kun immediately came to his senses and looked at the entrance with interest.”Which leader is here?”

The answer was soon revealed. The person who came was Jiang Liangyu, the Deputy Mayor of Sanshan city in charge of science, education, Culture, and health.

Although Jiang Liangyu was at the same level as he kun, their authority was different.

He kun was only an assistant in the provincial unit, while Jiang Liangyu was the Deputy Mayor of the provincial capital. He was not only in charge of the health industry, but also in the fields of science, technology, Education, Culture, and so on.

Even though he wasn’t ranked very high among the Deputy mayors, he was still a high – ranking Deputy Director. Moreover, he attended this press conference as an official, which meant that he represented the first level of government.

Therefore, the reporters ‘enthusiasm was even higher.

Not only were the writing journalists eager to ask questions, but there were also many photojournalists looking for a position to take photos.

The Deputy mayor’s activities had to be reported in the local media, so Jiang Liangyu also brought reporters to the press conference this time. This way, more people surrounded him, and the scene was a bit chaotic.

Fortunately, the experienced veterans that Xia ruofei had temporarily transferred to maintain order were very experienced. They quickly opened up a passage and escorted Jiang Liangyu and Xue Jinshan into the venue.

“Mayor Jiang, this is the chairman of our paradise Corporation, Xia ruofei. This is our general manager, Feng Jing!” Xue Jinshan explained.

Jiang Liangyu wasn’t old. He looked to be in his forties, and he had a refined temperament.

Xia ruofei had accidentally seen Jiang Liangyu’s resume and had some impression of him. He knew that the Deputy Mayor used to be a teacher and had worked in the education system for a long time. After he was promoted to Deputy Mayor, he was still in charge of science, education, Culture, and health.

Jiang Liangyu immediately extended his hand to Xia ruofei with a smile and said,””I’ve heard that you’re young and promising, President Xia, but I didn’t expect you to be so young!”

“You’re too kind. I’m young, but I don’t deserve to be called a promising young man!” Xia ruofei smiled.”Mayor Jiang, you’re overpraising me!”

“Paradise Corporation is the star company of our city! President Xia is the celebrity entrepreneur of our San Shan!” Jiang Liangyu teased,”if this isn’t considered young and promising, we old men really don’t have the face to live anymore ...”

Then, Jiang Liangyu smiled and shook hands with Feng Jing. One could see that he was a modest gentleman. His eyes were very clear, and when he shook hands, it was like a Dragonfly touching the water. He did not do anything overboard just because Feng Jing was a beautiful woman.

After exchanging a few pleasantries with Xia ruofei and Feng Rao, Jiang Liangyu smiled and said to he kun,””Bureau chief he is here too!”

He kun had worked in Sanshan city for a long time and was very familiar with the situation within the Sanshan system. He also knew Jiang Liangyu and Qianqian had worked together for a period of time.

“Hahaha! Since Mayor Jiang took time out of his busy schedule to attend, as the higher authorities, we can’t fall behind!” He kun said half – jokingly.

Jiang Liangyu smiled.”Bureau chief he is right. An enterprise like the Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory should be taken care of by the local government and the authorities!”

The media reporters couldn’t help but look at each other. Wasn’t this a little too obvious? Wasn’t this not popular anymore? Aren’t you guys afraid of people gossiping behind your backs?

Jiang Liangyu and he kun came to the press conference without saying goodbye. Fortunately, Xue Jinshan was well – prepared and had adjusted his seat at the last minute. Jiang Liangyu sat in the middle, Xia ruofei sat on his left side, he kun sat on his right side, and Feng Jing sat beside Xia ruofei.

Xue Jinshan saw that it was almost time and there shouldn’t be any higher – ranking leaders attending, so he walked up to the stage and gestured to the staff.

The lights on the stage gradually dimmed, leaving only one spotlight on Xue Jinshan.

The clamor in the venue naturally slowly died down, and everyone’s eyes were focused on Xue Jinshan.

Xia ruofei was also paying attention to the situation on the stage with interest. Although he had instructed that the press conference should not be too Grand, he was still very curious about how Xue Jinshan would manage the press conference.

Xue Jinshan took a deep breath and reached out to adjust the position of his headset. Then, he said with a smile,”Welcome, Mayor Jiang and bureau chief he! Welcome, Chairman Xia ruofei and general manager Feng Jing of paradise Corporation! Welcome to all the media and colleagues of paradise Corporation! On behalf of all the employees of the Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory, I would like to thank everyone for taking the time out of their busy schedules to attend today’s new drug launch!”

After a simple opening speech, Xue Jinshan paused for a moment. His eyes swept across the room before he continued,”Before we start introducing the new drug that will be released today, I would like to invite everyone to watch a video clip!”

As soon as Xue Jinshan finished speaking, the only spotlight on the stage went out, while the big screen behind him slowly lit up ...
