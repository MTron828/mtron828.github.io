Chapter 1461: Chapter 860 – giving them a taste of their own medicine_1

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei glanced at Bai Jingjing and store manager Liu and smiled.””It’s good that you’ve made a decision, but it’s better not to stay in such a company!”

“En!” Guanping seemed to have made up his mind. He said,”I will hand in my resignation after I start work!”

When Bai Jingjing heard this, she couldn’t help but sneer. “You’re finally willing to resign? Little Guan, I’m telling you, people like you are nothing when you leave the company! Don’t end up on the streets!”

Xia ruofei’s sharp eyes swept over Bai Jingjing.

Bai Jingjing was so scared that she shrank back to store manager Liu’s side and said,””What do you want to do? I’m warning you, this is a society ruled by law. If you dare to touch me again, I’ll definitely call the police!”

Xia ruofei laughed,”I’m afraid that I’ll dirty my hands if I hit you!” I just want to tell you that even if the two of you end up on the streets, my brother will live well!”

Bai Jingjing saw that Xia ruofei had no intention of making a move and her courage seemed to increase. She sneered and said,””Then I’ll wait and see!”

After that, Bai Jingjing glanced at Guan Ping and said,”By the way, I have a lot of acquaintances in the industry. You’d better give up the idea of applying for a job at other real estate agencies! Unless you leave the three mountains, you won’t have a place in this industry!”

Although Guan Ping had already decided to work in Xia ruofei’s company, he still couldn’t help but feel angry after hearing Bai Jingjing’s words.

This was forcing him to a dead end!

If Guanping did not have a brother like Xia ruofei, even if he left pioneer real estate, he would definitely have to apply for a job at another real estate agency. After all, he had worked for so many years and was familiar with this industry.

Bai Jingjing was clearly trying to shut him out. In that case, he could only leave his hometown or change to a new industry and start from scratch.

Seeing Guan Ping’s ashen face, Bai Jing Jing couldn’t help but feel proud. She said condescendingly,””Little Guan, I’ve always admired people with a backbone, but it’s not good to be young and frivolous! If you don’t have a job, how do you support yourself? Just relying on your few poor friends?”

“Manager Bai, what’s there to talk about with this impulsive young man? he’ll only understand these things after he hits a wall in society!” Manager Liu said with a cold smile. Without a source of income, he’ll know what it means to be poor and have short aspirations!”

Xia ruofei and Guan Ping looked at the two of them speechlessly. They could not understand where their sense of superiority came from.

Wasn’t he just a small leader of a second – rate real estate agency?

“Pingzi, let’s go!” Xia ruofei’s interest waned.”What’s there to talk about with this frog at the bottom of the well?”

Guan Ping couldn’t help but smile,”It really is ...”

“Who are you calling a frog at the bottom of a well?” Bai Jingjing raised her eyebrows and said,”you poor people who eat at food stalls? Don’t think that you can talk big just because you have a few pounds of brute force!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t be bothered with such a weirdo and just smiled faintly.

At that moment, ye Lingyun drove his Knight XV to the street.

Bai Jingjing’s eyes lit up when she saw the Super SUV. She pointed at the car and said to Xia ruofei,””Did you see that? This was the life of a truly rich man! Do you know what brand this car is and how much it’s worth? One of their headlights was enough for you to eat a few hundred meals at a food stall! He didn’t even think about his own status, and actually dared to call him a frog at the bottom of a well! I think you’re even worse than toads!”

Xia ruofei glanced at Bai Jingjing indifferently. Looking at this woman who kept pestering him, he couldn’t help but feel a trace of anger.

When Guan Ping saw that Bai Jingjing had actually used Xia ruofei’s car as evidence to attack Xia ruofei, his expression became extremely interesting.

At that moment, ye Lingyun had already stopped the car. He immediately opened the door and jumped out.

He had seen the conflict from afar, so he quickly walked towards Xia ruofei as soon as he got out of the car.

When Bai Jingjing saw the young man driving the luxury SUV towards her, she thought that she had met a rich second – generation heir who was hitting on her on the street. She couldn’t help but feel excited. She even threw flirtatious glances at ye Lingyun, ignoring the fact that her lover was right beside her. She even deliberately stuck out her chest to show off her proud capital.

Ye Lingyun’s face was cold. He didn’t even look her in the eye. Instead, he went straight to Xia ruofei’s side and bowed slightly.”Brother Xia, what happened? Do you need me to deal with it?”

With that, ye linyun’s sharp eyes swept over to store manager Liu and Bai Jingjing.

“Don’t worry, they’re just two clowns!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”let’s go! You go get little fatty into the car first!”

“Yes!” Ye linyun said, then immediately walked towards pang Hao.

By the side, store manager Liu and Bai Jingjing were already dumbfounded. Their faces were turning red and white.

Bai Jingjing’s lecture to Xia ruofei still rang in her ears. She did not expect that this luxury car that was worth tens of millions actually belonged to Xia ruofei. She thought that this cool and handsome rich man was only Xia ruofei’s bodyguard and driver.

Bai Jingjing wished there was a crack in the ground for her to crawl into. Store manager Liu was even more terrified. How could a person who could afford such a luxury car be of low status? He had drunk a little alcohol today, and with Bai Jingjing’s teasing, he might get into trouble.
