“The herbs used to refine the firecloud pill are all relatively common!” Xia ruofei said directly.

“Yes! Master!” Luo Qingfeng quickly said,”please give me some time!”

“En!”

After Xia ruofei finished speaking, he sat cross – legged on the futon in the pill refining room and started to meditate.

After all, Qingfeng Luo was a cultivator at the Golden core stage, and his spiritual power was not weak. It was just a piece of paper, but he quickly memorized it.

Seeing that Xia ruofei was meditating, Luo Qingfeng did not dare to disturb him. He memorized the prescription and the refining method again. After making sure that he had memorized it, he put the precious paper into his storage ring and began to look for medicinal herbs in the medicine cabinet next to him.

In a short while, Luo Qingfeng had gathered most of the required herbs. Among them, there were two relatively rare herbs that were not kept in the alchemy room.

Just as Luo Qingfeng was in a dilemma, Xia ruofei opened his eyes and took out the last two herbs from the spirit map space.

Then, he used his spiritual power to scan the herbs that Luo Qingfeng had found. He nodded with satisfaction and said,””There’s no problem with the type and quantity of medicinal herbs. Well done!”

“This old servant is too slow – witted, master, you’re too kind!” Luo Qingfeng said quickly.

“Let’s start!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll try to be slow. How much you can learn depends on your luck!”

“Yes! Master!” “Yes,” Luo Qingfeng said quickly. He then focused his attention on the process of Xia ruofei’s refining.

Xia ruofei began to process the ingredients skillfully. The equipment in the room was very useful, and the process of refining the medicine was smoother than when Xia ruofei was in the spirit map space.

This was Xia ruofei’s second time refining the fire cloud pill. He was more skilled than the last time.

However, he didn’t pursue speed. Instead, he deliberately slowed down the pace and sometimes explained the key points.

Luo Qingfeng, who was at the side, was naturally busy observing and memorizing.

In this batch, he had refined a total of ten firecloud pills, which took about two hours.

When the last step was completed, the ten firecloud pills were already lying quietly in the medicine refining furnace.

Xia ruofei casually took a fire cloud pill that still had some heat. After carefully observing it, he said with satisfaction,””The quality is not bad! It seems to be better than last time ...”

After saying that, he took out two porcelain bottles from the space, each containing five firecloud pills.

After Xia ruofei kept one of the bottles, he handed the other bottle to Luo Qingfeng and said,””You can keep these five! It can be used in times of need, or if the meridians of the sect’s disciples are damaged during cultivation. ”

“Thank you, master!” “Thank you,” Luo Qingfeng said gratefully.

Xia ruofei looked tired and said,””If there’s nothing else, I’ll go rest first!”

“Yes!” “Please follow me, master,” Luo Qingfeng said quickly.

Luo Qingfeng brought Xia ruofei to the quiet room where he usually rested. He personally changed Xia ruofei’s bedding before he respectfully took his leave.

While Xia ruofei was resting in the quiet room, Luo Qingfeng was not idle. He went straight to the staircase on the tenth floor and shouted. A disciple who had been waiting on the ninth floor ran up and asked respectfully,””What instructions does sect leader have?”

Qingfeng Luo said,”go to the medicinal warehouse and help me find two medicinal herbs. Bring more!” Send it directly to the pill refining room!”

Even though the refining room on the tenth floor lacked two medicinal herbs, the star Seizer sect had its own specialized warehouse for medicinal herbs, and the stock of medicinal herbs there was much more complete than the refining room. Moreover, although the two herbs that were missing this time were relatively rare, they were not the kind of spirit herbs that were difficult to find, so the sect’s medicinal warehouse most likely had reserves of them.

After Qingfeng Luo finished speaking, he told the disciple the names of the two herbs he needed to refine the fire cloud pill. The disciple quickly left.

Then, he returned to the refining room and took out the prescription that Xia ruofei had written. He studied it carefully and combined it with the process of Xia ruofei refining the fire cloud pill to comprehend it bit by bit.

Very quickly, the disciple collected the medicinal ingredients and rushed to the pill refining room.

Luo Qingfeng checked the ingredients and sent the disciple to the ninth floor. He also told the disciple that he was not allowed to come to the tenth floor without permission.

After the disciple left, Luo Qingfeng began to try it out in the alchemy room.

After repeated failures, Luo Qingfeng finally succeeded in refining three firecloud pills when the sky was slightly bright.

He was overjoyed, and quickly picked it up to examine it. He even personally tasted one of the misty firecloud pills. Its medicinal properties were mild, and even if one was not injured, eating it would not have any effect. However, whether the firecloud pill he refined was up to standard or not, there was still a certain risk in rashly trying it.

After Qingfeng Luo ate the firecloud pill, he quickly closed his eyes to feel it, and a hint of joy gradually appeared on his face. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

After an entire night of failures, the firecloud pill that he had finally refined was far inferior to the one that Xia ruofei had refined. However, it was still a firecloud pill without a doubt. At least, he had managed to succeed this time.

After a night of practice, Qingfeng Luo had found the way. He felt that the main problem was that he was not skilled enough. After repeated practice, it should not be a problem for him to refine higher quality fire cloud pills.

Luo Qingfeng could not help but feel excited. If he could refine the firecloud pill, the star Seizer sect would undoubtedly have another source of income.

Although the fire cloud pill’s scope of use was not as wide as the Qi gathering pill, and cultivators who were not injured basically had no use for it, it was not like the Qi gathering pill, which could be used to assist in cultivation as long as it was a Qi refining cultivator, and there were no side effects. However, the firecloud pill was more precious than the Chi – amassing pill, and in the entire world of cultivation, the demand for it was still relatively large.

It would not be an exaggeration to say that this alone was enough to increase the star Seizer sect’s income by tens of thousands of spiritual stones every year.

More importantly, the cost of the fire cloud pill was very low. Basically, they were all common herbs that could even be purchased from the secular world.

Most of the spirit stones he earned from selling firecloud pills were pure profit.

At the thought of this, Luo Qingfeng’s gratitude for Xia ruofei grew even deeper.

At this moment, the horizon had just revealed a trace of white. Qingfeng Luo was about to strike while the iron was hot and refine a few more times to increase his proficiency when he heard footsteps coming from the corridor outside.

No disciple of the star Seizer sect would come up to the tenth floor without permission, so the person outside must be Xia ruofei.

Luo Qingfeng quickly walked over and opened the door of the pill refining room. As expected, he saw Xia ruofei walking over from the quiet room.

“Master, you’re up!” “Master!” Luo Qingfeng bowed respectfully.

Xia ruofei glanced at Luo Qingfeng and sniffed the faint medicinal fragrance coming from the refining room. He asked,””You didn’t sleep the whole night?”

“Yes! This old servant’s aptitude is dull, and I’m afraid that I’ll disappoint master’s cultivation, so while I still have a deep impression of it, I’ve been practicing refining firecloud pills overnight. ” Luo Qingfeng said with his head lowered.

Xia ruofei sniffed the medicine and smiled.””It seems that the results of your practice are not bad! If I’m not wrong, you should have already successfully refined the firecloud pill?”

“Master is wise!” Luo Qingfeng quickly said,”after several failures, I finally managed to refine a furnace of firecloud pills. The only difference is the quality.”

“Let me see!” Xia ruofei said as he walked into the refining room.

There were still two pitch – Black firecloud pills left in the furnace. They were slightly uneven and looked like the surface of the moon. The firecloud pills that Xia ruofei had refined previously were all round and smooth. In comparison, the firecloud pills refined by Luo Qingfeng were like the beggar’s version.

...

Xia ruofei did not laugh at Luo Qingfeng. Instead, he picked one up and sniffed it. After observing it carefully, he smiled and said,””Not bad! At least the medicinal properties are not a problem, it’s just that the grade is a bit different, and the degree of fusion between the medicinal properties is also a bit low, but at least it’s a fire cloud pill that can be used!”
