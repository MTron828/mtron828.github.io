[Important Notice] officially opening a VIP Reader group. Group number: 295848872, to enter the group, you need to verify the screenshot of the full order. Brothers and sisters who have fully booked the chat, hurry up and join the group! When Xia ruofei went downstairs, pang Hao had just brought Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao back from a tour of the farm. Xia ruofei smiled and went up to him, asking,””Auntie, Qiao’ er, how do you feel after looking around?” Hu Zi’s mother said with a smile,”ruofei, you’ve done a great job with the construction here!” The environment is also well maintained, and the air in the countryside is good. It’s really good!” “If you like it, then stay for a longer period of time!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”the farm has just been built. After some time, the trees will grow bigger. Then, we can plant all kinds of vegetables in the greenhouse and fruit trees in the back of the mountain. The environment will be better.” “Waa! Wouldn’t that be the fragrance of fruits?” Lin Qiao smiled and said,”brother ruofei, you have to leave a room for me! I’ll come over to stay when I’m free in the future ...” “No problem! You’re always welcome during the winter and summer break!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’ll let you eat all kinds of fruits in summer!” “Only the winter and summer breaks? What about the usual times?” Lin Qiao asked. “You usually have to go to school! Of course, I live in the city. ” “What about after I get into university?” Lin Qiao asked naughtily. Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you’re going to study in another city after you get into university?” You’ll only be back during the winter and summer breaks, right?” “Who said I’m going out of town?” Lin Qiao said,”he is going to a local university in Sanshan ...” “Yo! I already have an ideal school!” Xia ruofei asked in surprise,”what University is it?” Lin Qiao made a cute face and said with a smile, “It’s a secret!” Hu Zi’s mother laughed and scolded,”you little girl!” Why are you keeping your brother ruofei in suspense?” “It’s fine, it’s fine ...” Xia ruofei said.”Auntie, Qiao’ er is already an adult. It’s a good thing that she has her own ideas! Besides, she’s doing well in San Shan University and can take care of you! There are quite a few top universities in Sanshan city!” After experiencing the pain of losing her son, Hu Zi’s mother naturally loved her only daughter, Lin Qiao, even more. In fact, she also hoped that Lin Qiao could be by her side. If Lin Qiao really went to study in a faraway place, she would definitely be worried. Therefore, after hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Hu Zi’s mother smiled and nodded in agreement. The three of them chatted as they walked into the villa. The rooms that Xia ruofei had arranged for the mother and daughter were on the second floor. In addition to her master bedroom, there were two guest rooms on the second floor, one for the mother and daughter. Xia ruofei had already tidied up the room and changed the bedding into new ones. Especially the room prepared for Lin Qiao, which had a nine – piece set of pink Kitty cat series. He had also spent a lot of effort to decorate the room. The entire room was filled with a girlish element. As soon as Lin Qiao entered the room, she screamed with joy and threw herself on the soft bed. She hugged the pink pillow tightly and refused to get up. She kept saying that this room must be reserved for her and that she would come to stay as long as there was a holiday. Xia ruofei looked at Lin Qiao lovingly and nodded with a smile. After Hu Zi’s mother moved into the villa, she took over the kitchen. Ye Lingyun, who had been working as a part – time chef for a few days, was officially laid off. However, Hu Zi’s mother’s cooking skills were indeed much better than ye Lingyun ‘s. In addition, the ingredients were all vegetables and fish produced in the realm. Everyone was very satisfied with the meal. Pang Hao immediately said that he would be freeloading here in the future. …… The next morning, Cao tieshu brought a few workers to find Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei knew why they were here. He brought them to the villa’s garage and gave them the dozens of vegetable seeds that he had taken out in advance. Xia ruofei had also specifically told them that these seeds were all high – tech products and that they did not need to be soaked. They could be directly sown. Cao tieshu and the others were very happy that Qianqian had been employed for almost a month and finally had work to do. Cao tieshu directed the other workers to move the seeds out of the garage. He rubbed his hands and said to Xia ruofei,””Boss, we’ve discussed it yesterday. We think that the orchard in the back mountain has been opened up. It’s best to plant the fruit trees in the spring. You can think about what kind of fruit trees to plant in the next few days.” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””I understand, old Cao. Thank you for your reminder!” “By the way, boss ...” Cao tieshu wanted to say something but hesitated. In the end, he still opened his mouth and said,”in that mountain forest, our village has also planted fruit trees for a few years. However, perhaps due to the soil quality, the fruits that bear are bitter and astringent. They are simply inedible ... So, when you choose the sapling, it would be best for you to ...” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”okay, I know.” Don’t worry! I have a friend in this line of work, and I’ll ask him to give me some advice some other day. I’m sure we’ll be able to pick out the most suitable breed. ” Cao tieshu grinned and said,”sure!” It’s good that the boss has considered it! Then ... I’ll go to the greenhouse first. We’re going to plant the seeds today!” After he finished speaking, Cao tieshu walked towards the door. Xia ruofei thought for a while and called out to him,””Old Cao, I see that you’re doing quite well in management. I’ll let you be in charge of the vegetable greenhouse in the future, is that okay?” “Boss, you’re letting me manage the greenhouse?” Cao tieshu asked in surprise. Don’t worry! Since the boss trusts me so much, I’ll definitely manage the vegetable greenhouse well!” “Mm! Do well!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”well ... I’ll temporarily be considered a supervisor! I’ll raise your monthly salary to 7000!” “There’s even a salary increase!” Cao tieshu was a little surprised. He immediately said,”boss, our salary is already high enough. This ...” Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.”Our company pays according to your work. We don’t engage in equality.” As a supervisor, you definitely can’t be paid the same as ordinary workers! Work hard and the company will develop well. Your salary will definitely increase!” “AI! I see, thank you, boss!” Cao tieshu said excitedly,”don’t worry, boss. I will definitely do a good job!” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. Cao tieshu left in high spirits. Xia ruofei had finally handed over the vegetables. As long as the greenhouse in Taoyuan farm started to produce vegetables and started to operate positively, Xia ruofei could stop the vegetable planting in the spirit map space. During the transition period, he still had to ensure that he provided Ling Ji restaurant and the West River Moon Club with food every day. At night, Xia ruofei locked the door and windows of his bedroom. After a careful inspection, he took out the spirit map. Now that there were many people living in the villa, Xia ruofei was even more careful. Xia ruofei entered the origin space and planned to patrol the area before tidying up the field. Now that the scale of farming could be reduced, once the greenhouse started to produce vegetables, the origin space could stop growing normal vegetables. By then, he only needed to prepare the “high – tech seeds” regularly. When Xia ruofei saw the pond with a pair of Red Arowana, he was immediately attracted to it ...
