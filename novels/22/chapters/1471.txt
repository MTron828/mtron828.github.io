Chapter 1472: A coincidental encounter at the hotel (2)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei took their room cards and registered with the staff at the entrance of the buffet restaurant. Song Wei stood at the side and waited.

At this moment, an uncertain voice was heard.””Song Wei?”

When Song Wei heard the familiar voice, she was stunned for a moment. Then, she turned around and her eyes widened when she saw who it was.

“Yuanyuan!” “What are you doing here?” Song Wei exclaimed in surprise.

Xia ruofei saw that Song Wei had met someone familiar, so he told the staff not to register first. He took the room card and walked towards Song Wei.

Xia ruofei saw a girl who was about the same age as Song Wei standing in front of her. She had a pretty face, but she was a little thin. Her face was not ruddy enough, and it seemed to have a trace of waxiness. It was obvious that she was not in good health.

A young man in his twenties stood beside the girl. He wore a pair of black – rimmed glasses and looked older than his actual age. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The girl was holding Song Wei’s hand in surprise and said,”Wei Wei, I went back to xiangnan after graduation! I’m the one who should be asking you! Why did you suddenly come to tan Zhou?”

At this moment, the girl noticed Xia ruofei, who was standing quietly beside Song Wei. She raised her eyebrows at Song Wei and smiled.”Oh ... I know! You must be on vacation with your boyfriend!”

“Don’t talk nonsense!” Song Wei blushed and said,”normal friends! We’re here in xiangnan to settle some matters!”

“Do something?” The girl asked with a smile,”what’s the matter?”

Song Wei was at a loss for words. She and Xia ruofei could not just tell anyone about what they were going to do in xiangnan!

Seeing Song Wei’s embarrassed look, the girl couldn’t help but laugh. “You’re still so easily embarrassed! Alright, alright, I won’t ask anymore! You should at least introduce me to her!”

Song Wei came back to her senses and quickly said,”His name is Xia ruofei, he’s my ...”

“Ordinary friends! I know ...”The girl giggled and extended her hand to Xia ruofei.” Hello, I’m Yuanyuan Xu, Weiwei’s University classmate!”

“It’s a pleasure to meet you!” Xia ruofei smiled gently and shook hands with Xu Qianqian.

After Yuan Yuan greeted Xia ruofei, she smiled at Song Wei and said,””Not bad, not bad! Her eyes are clean, and her temperament is friendly. She’s worthy of our great lady song!”

Song Wei and Xia ruofei looked at each other and smiled bitterly. They could not clear their names even if they jumped into the Yellow River.

However, Song Wei did not reject such a misunderstanding. In fact, she was a little happy.

However, when they thought about how they had been acting sneakily when they set off from the three mountains, afraid of being discovered, and how they had been coincidentally met by song Zhengping and Xu Yuanyuan after they arrived in Tanzhou, they were speechless.

Was tan Zhou really that small?

Song Wei’s eyes fell on the young man beside Xu Yuan Yuan. She smiled and said,””Yuanyuan, where’s the one beside you? Why didn’t you introduce me? Could it be ...”

Shu Yuan Yuan smiled and held the young man’s arm. She said to Song Wei,””I’m not like some people who hide things, let me introduce you! This is my husband, he’s called Zhuang Yan. ”

Song Wei could not help but widen her eyes in disbelief.”Hubby? Yuanyuan, don’t tell me ... You’re already married? How long has it been since we graduated?”

Xu Yuanyuan glanced at Zhuang Yan beside her and a trace of happiness flashed in her eyes. She smiled and said,””Yup! If he felt that she was suitable, he would marry her! Otherwise, wouldn’t it be even more impossible to get married?”

“Yuanyuan, are you mocking me?” Song Wei pretended to be angry.

Xu Yuan Yuan giggled and said,”no!” No! Didn’t you already find the right person?”

Then, Xu Yuanyuan glanced at Xia ruofei.

Song Wei blushed and tried to cover it up,”Why didn’t you tell us that you were getting married? Even if it’s just sending a message to our classmates “group chat, it’s fine!”

Xu Yuan Yuan held Zhuang Yan’s arm tightly and said with a smile,””We’re all so far apart, and we’re all in the north and south, so I don’t think we should trouble everyone ...”

“You!” Song Wei pointed at Yuan Yuan and said,”since I know, I’ll give you a red packet!”

Xu Yuan Yuan laughed and said,”there’s really no need!” You’re still in school, and you’re spending your parents ‘hard – earned money to give me a red packet!”

Xia ruofei could not help but look at Song Wei. It seemed that Song Wei was quite low – Key when she was in college! Her classmates, be it Zhuo Yiyi or Xu Yuanyuan, whom she had met today, did not know about her illustrious family background!

At this moment, Zhuang Yan smiled and said,”Yuanyuan, let’s not stand here anymore. It’s been a long time since we last met. Let’s sit down and chat over there!”

It was obvious that Zhuang Yan was very good to Xu Yuanyuan. Song Wei was happy from the bottom of her heart that her classmate had found her own happiness.

The four of them came to the rest area in the hotel lobby and sat down on two empty couches. Xu Yuanyuan and Song Wei hadn’t seen each other for more than half a year, so they naturally had endless things to talk about.

Xia ruofei and Zhuang Yan were ignored by them.

However, they naturally didn’t care, especially Zhuang Yan. When Xu Yuan Yuan was talking, he would occasionally look at her face with eyes full of love. It was obvious that the two were quite in love.

Naturally, Song Wei had to ask about Yuan Yuan’s recent situation and why she got married so quickly.

It turned out that after Xu Yuanyuan graduated from her college, she returned to her hometown, xiangnan. She passed the public institution’s recruitment examination and entered Tanzhou city’s cultural relics Bureau to work. Zhuang Yan was also an employee of this unit, and he was admitted two years earlier than Xu Yuanyuan.

Zhuang Yan graduated from the Department of Archaeology at the University of Jin Ling, while Xu Yuanyuan graduated from the capital University. The two of them were students from famous universities with similar majors, so they naturally had a lot in common in the Qingshui Yamen.

After a while, the two of them got together.

Zhuang Yan was an honest and simple person. He was usually a little reticent, and he was also a little slow in understanding things between men and women. The two of them were finally able to get married because Xu Yuanyuan took the initiative at first.

Song Wei couldn’t help but giggle and said,”This is really your style, Yuanyuan!”

Song Wei knew that with her results, she had the chance to continue her postgraduate studies. Even if she wanted to find a job, she had a good chance of working in Beijing.

Xu Yuan Yuan had chosen to return to her hometown and enter the cultural relics Bureau, which was a government office of clear water. There must be a reason behind this.

However, since Xu Yuanyuan didn’t say anything, Song Wei naturally wouldn’t ask about Wanwan. Who didn’t have some privacy?

Also, for example, Xu Yuanyuan and Zhuang Yan appeared at the Kempinski Hotel today, which was a bit out of the ordinary. Xiangnan was an inland province, and the treatment within the system was ordinary. In addition, a unit like the cultural relics Bureau didn’t have any extra income. At least, they didn’t have the economic strength to enter and leave a five – Star hotel.

However, Song Wei would not ask such a silly question. It was enough to just reminisce about the past when classmates met.

Just as everyone was chatting happily, a fashionably dressed young woman walked into the hotel lobby through the revolving door.

She looked around and soon found Xu Yuanyuan and Zhuang Yan sitting on the sofa. A trace of displeasure flashed in her eyes.

The young woman walked over in a daze and slightly frowned,”Zhuang Yan, Yuanyuan, why are you still sitting here? Director Jiang and director Wang are about to arrive. What will they think if they come in and see you guys sitting there? Your first impression is already bad, and you still want to ask for help?”

“Sister – in – Law, Yuanyuan just met her University classmate. We haven’t seen each other for a long time, so she came over to have a chat ...” Zhuang Yan quickly stood up and said.

The young woman glanced at Song Wei and Xia ruofei, then said to Zhuang Yan,”Why do you have to pick this time to reminisce with us? Zhuang Yan, Yuanyuan is insensible. Are you going to mess around with her?”

Xu Qianqian suddenly looked aggrieved and bit her lower lip. When she saw Zhuang Yan’s smiling face, she swallowed the rebuttal that was already on the tip of her tongue.

Xia ruofei and Song Wei looked at each other and felt confused. Why did she become so insensible after talking to her classmates?

What kind of logic was this?
