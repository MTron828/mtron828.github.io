1986 I’m going to find her (1)

“What’s the situation?”Xia ruofei frowned.

“It’s just hearsay,” old Blake said.”It seems that Toles of the Gelman family has said that if Monica is willing to be his woman, the Gelman family can consider letting the Grasso family live ...”

“what?”Xia ruofei could not help but raise his voice. He frowned and asked,”what does Toles do?”

“He’s a notorious thug, a top fighter of the Mafia, the Gelman family,”said old Blake. “I think ... His public declaration must have been tacitly approved by the Gelman family. After all, the Grao family is just an ordinary business family. Their mistake was that they had sponsored the Moore family in the beginning, but they themselves are not a threat to the Gelman family. ”

“Isn’t this a society ruled by law? After hearing your news, why do I feel like Italy is still in the Middle Ages?” Xia ruofei said with a dark face.

Old Blake smiled bitterly.”Xia, the sun always coexists with the darkness. The Gelman family does have a great influence in the underground world of Italy. Toles dared to make a public statement, so he must have something to rely on ...”

“Then ... How did this matter develop?” Xia ruofei asked.

He was a little nervous at the moment, afraid that old Blake would tell him that Monica had become the woman of the villain named Toles.

Old Blake shrugged.”I don’t know. I only heard about it once. I came to Hong Kong soon, so I don’t know much about Italy!”

Xia ruofei sighed and said,””No matter what, I’m very grateful to you. Mr. Blake, if you can, I hope you can help me find out about the follow – up development of this matter. In addition, I also hope to collect some information about the Grao family, the Gelman family, and that thug called Toles. ”

“I’m willing to serve you!” Old Blake said with a smile.

“Thank you very much!” Xia ruofei said,”by the way, if it will affect your personal safety, then forget it. This is just my personal request. No matter what decision you make, it won’t affect our future cooperation. ”

“I’m just trying to get some information. The black family has the ability to do so. Don’t worry, Mr. Xia. I’ll send the information you need to your email as soon as possible!” Old Blake said with a smile.

“Thank you!” Xia ruofei said sincerely.

Although Xia ruofei had a very bad impression of the Blake family because of George Blake, to be honest, old Blake was a good person. This old man always gave people a comfortable feeling when he was with them. No wonder he was the patriarch of the Blake family.

Xia ruofei and old Blake said goodbye to each other at the electric ladder.

After returning to the Presidential Suite, Xia ruofei immediately took out his phone and dialed the number that Monica had left him.

A mechanical electronic voice came from the phone. Monica’s number was no longer in service.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but blame himself. It had indeed been a while since he had contacted Monica.

To be honest, he might have more physical needs than mental needs for Monica. They did not see each other often, but every time, they would have sex. Other than physical “communication”, Xia ruofei did not care about Monica like a lover.

Now that he knew Monica was in trouble, Xia ruofei suddenly realized that he was still worried about her. He was filled with guilt very quickly.

At this moment, what appeared in his mind was no longer Monica’s flirtatious style in bed, but Monica’s back view when they said goodbye to each other for the last time ...

Xia ruofei felt as if his heart had been pricked by a needle. He even had the urge to call Captain Liu An immediately to change his plan and fly directly to Italy.

However, Xia ruofei knew that being impulsive would not solve the problem. He could not go to Italy directly, at least not with the visa issue.

In addition, if he were to go to Italy he could not go out with his current identity, because it was very likely that he would have a conflict with the Mafia family. At that time, his identity would become a huge hindrance.

Hence, even though he was anxious, Xia ruofei knew that he had to plan for the long term.

The reason why he was a little flustered at that moment was because after Monica’s phone was turned off, the only way they could contact each other was cut off. He did not know Monica’s current situation.

The unknown was always scary.

Xia ruofei smoked a few cigarettes in a row and gradually calmed down. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

However, the idea of going to Italy to find Monica became more and more firm!

He muttered in his heart,”no matter what, I must find her!” No matter who was trying to threaten Monica, I will make them pay a painful price!

Xia ruofei raised his hand and looked at his watch. It was almost time to leave for the airport.

So, he packed his luggage and called Zhao Yongjun.

Zhao Yongjun quickly picked up his call,””Hahaha! “Ruofei, you’ve been doing well these days!” There’s news of you being in the limelight in Hong Kong everywhere! Tell me honestly, are there a lot of Hong Kong girls throwing themselves into your arms now?”

“Big brother Zhao, I need your help with something urgent.” Xia ruofei didn’t have the mood to brag to Zhao Yongjun, so he went straight to the point.
