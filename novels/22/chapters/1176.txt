“Alright!”

Xia ruofei leaned against the back of the Land Rover. Just as he closed his eyes and was about to take a nap, his phone vibrated.

Xia ruofei glanced at the phone screen and picked up the call with a smile.””Qiao’ er, why did you suddenly think of calling your brother?”

Lin Qiao snorted and said,”brother ruofei, you’re so mean!” It’s not easy for me to return to the three mountains, but you actually ran to the capital!”

Xia ruofei just remembered that today was the first day of the National Day holiday. With the seven – day holiday, Lin Qiao would definitely go back to the three mountains.

She had probably gone to the farm at the first moment, but she had come up empty – handed, so she had called to “condemn” her.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’m here for work, not for a tour ... Do you think I’m suffering?” The whole country is on holiday, and I still have to work!”

“I don’t care!” Lin Qiao said angrily,”you’re standing me up ...”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly,”what should we do?” Why don’t you come to Beijing for a few days? I’ll pay for the plane tickets!”

“Really?” Lin Qiao’s voice suddenly became much happier. However, after pondering for a moment, she said in a low mood,”forget it! I haven’t been home for more than a month. I have to spend some time with my mom!”

Xia ruofei felt relieved and said,””It seems that living independently is really tough! Our Qiao’ er has grown up and knows how to be filial to the elderly ...”

Lin Qiao snorted,”bad brother!” Don’t flatter me!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“I’ll try to come back as soon as possible,” Xia ruofei said quickly.”If you’re already back in school by then, I’ll go to Egret Island to see you!”

“Really?” Lin Qiao said,”then you have to keep your word!”

“That’s for sure!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll bring you some special pastries from the capital, okay?”

“This is more like it!” Lin Qiao’s displeasure turned into joy.”Then you can go back to your work! My mom is calling me!”

She hung up the phone after she finished speaking.

Xia ruofei shook his head with a bitter smile and kept his phone.

If they were delayed for a few more days, by the time Lin Qiao returned to school, Xia ruofei had also planned to go to Heron Island. He had not given Lin Qiao the Jade Leaf that he had prepared!

If Lin Qiao was still at San Shan by then, it would be easy. He could just give both her and Hu Zi’s mother their share.

After returning to the courtyard house, Xia ruofei gave Feng Jing a call and asked her to come over in the evening. Then, he walked around the courtyard with great interest to see the progress of the renovation works in the past half a month.

Zhao Yongjun’s friend was quite reliable. He was indeed a professional in the restoration of ancient buildings. The project was very detailed and had a sense of antiquity, unlike the ancient buildings on the urban pedestrian streets, which were completely impossible.

This included the new side door in the backyard and the two garages that had been renovated. Everything was done almost perfectly, and the entire courtyard did not lose its sense of harmony.

Xia ruofei saw that the main renovation project was almost completed. There were some minor repairs that had not been completed, but it had been cleaned up. The construction tools were also placed neatly in the corner of the courtyard. The whole courtyard was in good hygiene. It did not look like it had just undergone civil engineering.

Obviously, this was all thanks to Wu Qiang. Xia ruofei also praised him.

In the afternoon, Xia ruofei rested for a while in the master bedroom in the central courtyard. He got up and went to the courtyard. After making a cup of tea, he took a book and leisurely flipped through it on the lounge chair.

Listening to the birds chirping on the pomegranate tree and the pigeon’s whistle in the distance, the sun shone through the gaps of the leaves and onto his body, making him feel warm and comfortable.

In this courtyard house, it seemed as if time would flow longer.

When it was past fouro’ clock, Xia ruofei heard melodious music coming from the control system of the smart home. The control terminals were all over the courtyard so that the owner could control it at any time.

Of course, Xia ruofei had the highest authority. At the same time, Wu Qiang had some basic authority.

“Wu Qiang!” Xia ruofei shouted.”My friend must have arrived. Please go to the front yard to welcome him!”
