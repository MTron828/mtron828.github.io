2061 Effect with one shot (1)

“What?” Rousey’s mouth opened into an “O” shape as he repeatedly said,”Mr. Xia, this is impossible! I’m not belittling Chinese medicine, it’s just that ... This isn’t scientific at all!”

If Xia ruofei had said that he could regain some feeling in his leg after a stage of treatment, he might have been skeptical. However, how could he have done it with just one acupuncture treatment?

If it could be so simple to restore the feeling in his leg, then this illness would not have left so many famous doctors helpless.

In fact, Rousey’s leg disease was very serious. After he unfortunately contracted serious polio, although his fever subsided and he saved his life, he had no feeling below his knee since then. His leg was severely deformed. After so many years, even if he insisted on rehabilitation therapy, his leg muscles still inevitably atrophied.

Rossi himself had almost given up hope. Now that he heard Xia ruofei say that he could recover the feeling in his legs with one acupuncture session, his first reaction was disbelief.

Over the years, he had experienced too many times the mental journey from hope to disappointment. Now, he was basically in despair.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”the entire Chinese medicine system is not scientific in the Western mainstream view.” Rousey, won’t we know in a while whether it’s possible or not?”

Rousey looked at Xia ruofei deeply, took a deep breath and said,””Okay, then I’ll leave it to you, Mr. Xia!”

Seeing Xia ruofei’s confident look, Rossi’s emotions were unconsciously affected. A glimmer of hope began to appear in his heart.

Anyway, it didn’t matter if he tried it once. At most, it wouldn’t have any effect. It wasn’t the first time he had experienced such a process over the years.

After a while, Monica personally dragged Xia ruofei’s small luggage into the room.

She was a little surprised to see Rousey lying on the bed.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”did you bring the thing?” Hurry up and bring it over!”

Monica handed the luggage to Xia ruofei. He opened it and took out an exquisite box that had been prepared.

When he opened the box, he saw a row of silver needles of different sizes on the side of the lid. Inside the box was a set of delicate tools for cupping, including a jar, mugwort, and so on.

Xia ruofei gestured for Rossi to take off his pants. Rossi was still a little embarrassed in front of his sister, but Monica went over to help him take off his pants quickly.

Xia ruofei carefully disinfected the silver needle with alcohol and sat down by the bed.

He said to Rousey,”today, we will mainly perform acupuncture on a few acupuncture points on your leg. Although these silver needles are very long and look a little scary, you won’t feel any intense pain. So, don’t be nervous. The more relaxed you are, the less pain you will feel.”

Rousey rubbed his nose.”I can’t feel anything in my legs,” he said.”You can prick me however you want!”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. He couldn’t help but laugh and said,””You’ll feel it soon. ”

Then, Xia ruofei turned to Monica and said,””Monica, if you’re afraid, you can wait outside. Don’t worry, I won’t let anything happen to Rosey. ”

Monica looked at the trembling silver needle in Xia ruofei’s hand. She was a little scared when she thought about how long the needle was going to be inserted into Rossi’s leg. However, she still said bravely,”No need, I’ll just watch from the side!”

“OK!”Xia ruofei didn’t mind having someone by his side during the treatment.

He didn’t say anything more, and his eyes became very focused. His right hand shook slightly, and a silver needle accurately inserted into the Yangling Spring Point diagonally below Rossi’s knee. His movement was as fast as lightning. Monica even felt like she had blinked, and then the silver needle was already trembling slightly on Rossi’s leg.

Xia ruofei had already found the right acupuncture points, so he did not hesitate at all. Very quickly, the second and third needles also found the corresponding acupuncture points.

His acupuncture technique came from a long – Lost Traditional Chinese Medicine book in the Jade talisman of inheritance. It was called “Xing Lin San Shou”. He didn’t look for too many acupuncture points, and the technique was very special. If he used it with a small amount of true Qi, the effect would be quite obvious.

After inserting three needles, Xia ruofei did not continue to take out needles from the box at the side. Instead, he took a deep breath and extended two fingers to gently twist the silver needles. Threads of true energy invisible to the naked eye followed the silver needles and entered Rossi’s acupuncture points.

Because there was no feeling in his leg, Rousey did not feel anything at first, as if the needle had been inserted into someone else’s body.

However, as Xia ruofei started to channel his essential Qi into the acupuncture points, Rossi also noticed something unusual. Unknowingly, he felt soreness, swelling, and numbness in the three parts where the needles were inserted. Although the feeling was not particularly obvious, it was very real.

Rousey could even feel that the soreness was centered around the silver needle, radiating about five or six centimeters. He still could not feel the other parts of his body below his knee, but the soreness was becoming more and more obvious at the spot where the needle was inserted.

Rousey couldn’t help but draw in a breath of cold air, revealing a shocked expression.

He had lost feeling in his legs for more than ten years. This was the first time he felt the existence of his legs after he fell ill. The feeling was very wonderful, and at the same time, it set off a great storm in his heart.

Xia ruofei wasn’t lying. From the acupuncture to now, less than a minute had passed, and the effect he had mentioned before had already appeared.

“Rousey, do you feel uncomfortable?” Monica asked, a little worried.

“No, no, no...” Rousey quickly said,”Monica! This feeling was great! It can’t be any better ... I ... I can feel my legs ...”

Xia ruofei, who was focused on acupuncture, said without looking up,””Keep calm, don’t move, it’s best not to speak ...”

Monica was also surprised and happy. She quickly said,””Yes, yes, yes! Rousey, do as Xia says. Don’t move around, so as not to affect his treatment. ”

“Alright,” he said. Rousey whispered.

From the moment Xia ruofei walked into the room, Rossi was the most obedient. Now, he would do anything Xia ruofei asked him to do without hesitation.

Xia ruofei continued to twist the silver needles, and wisps of true energy continued to stimulate Rossi’s acupuncture points. In the second half of the acupuncture treatment, Xia ruofei began to flick the ends of the silver needles with his fingers, and the three silver needles began to vibrate at different frequencies.

The expression on Rossi’s face also became more and more varied, because as the silver needle trembled, his soreness became more intense. He could even feel a hot flow being transmitted from the tip of the silver needle, making his lower leg feel like it was bathing in a hot spring.

After a long time, Xia ruofei waved his hand and removed the three silver needles at a very fast speed. Then, he slowly disinfected them with alcohol, wiped them clean, and put them back into the box one by one.

“Xia, are you done with the treatment?” Monica asked.

Xia ruofei closed the box and nodded.””Yes! The effect of this treatment should be pretty good! What do you think? Rousey!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

As Xia ruofei spoke, he winked at Rousey and smiled.

“Of course!” Rousey said excitedly. Mr. Xia, I haven’t felt the existence of my legs for many years, and no doctor has ever been able to restore the feeling in my legs. You’re the first one to succeed!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s not a big deal to feel your legs during acupuncture. When I remove the silver needles and you can still feel them, that will be the first step to success.”

Rousey reached out to touch his slightly deformed and shriveled calf and said,””Mr. Xia, I don’t know if it’s just my imagination, but I feel like I can feel my legs. It’s just that the feeling is very weak, as if they’re separated by several layers of pants ...”

Xia ruofei said with certainty,”this is not an illusion, Rossi. Acupuncture is stimulating a few of your acupuncture points and clearing your meridians. From a Chinese medicine point of view, when your qi and blood flow is smooth, you will feel that your nerves are gradually recovering ...”

“Xia,” Monica said excitedly,”then you can continue treating Rousey!”

Rousey also nodded and said,”Mr. Xia, I’m not afraid of pain!” Please continue to treat me!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”It’s not a matter of whether you’re afraid of pain or not. Acupuncture treatment requires a certain amount of time to let these acupuncture points recover their energy. If you don’t control it, they will continue to overdraw and eventually harm the body.” In addition ...”

Xia ruofei paused for a moment before he continued,””Today was only the first treatment, and there was no external or oral Chinese medicine, so the effect was not particularly ideal. I’ll prepare the Chinese medicine tomorrow. After that, I’ll use massage and acupuncture. The effect will definitely be very good!”

“I’m looking forward to it!” Rousey said excitedly,”I might not be able to sleep tonight ...”

In fact, Rousey was so excited that he was about to cry. His hands were almost constantly rubbing his two calves as if that was the only way he could really feel the hope of standing up.

“That won’t do!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”the only way to guarantee the effect of tomorrow’s treatment is to rest well! “If your body is too weak, then many treatments can’t be carried out simultaneously ...”

“I understand!” “Don’t worry,” Rousey said.”I’ll force myself to sleep as soon as possible!”

Xia ruofei nodded and stood up. He smiled and said,””Then I won’t disturb you any longer. Rest early, good night!”

“Good night! Mr. Xia!” Rousey said respectfully.

After Xia ruofei showed off his skills, Rousey’s attitude towards him had changed dramatically. After seeing that he had a chance to stand up again, Rousey almost worshipped Xia ruofei like a god.

Monica also smiled and nodded at Roxi. Then, she walked out of the bedroom with Xia ruofei.

As soon as they left, Xia ruofei said,”Monica, inform ah Yong and Ah Hua to come and see me!” I have something I need them to do!”
