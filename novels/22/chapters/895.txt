Chapter 896: A strange poison (3)

Translator: 549690339

Song Wei tidied her clothes and walked to Xia ruofei. She smiled and said,”Doctor Xia, thank you for saving me ...”

Xia ruofei was not as flattered or nervous as the others when he was faced with a beautiful woman with a classical aura and the little princess of a provincial official.

He only smiled faintly and said,””You’re welcome. Actually, even if I didn’t do anything, you would still wake up. It’s just that it would take a little longer. ”

Song Wei’s eyes were filled with anticipation. She looked at Xia ruofei and asked,””Doctor Xia, do you really have a way to get rid of the poison in my body? I ... Could lose consciousness at any time, and I might never wake up again. This kind of life is really too torturous ...”

Xia ruofei said seriously,”to be honest, I’m not absolutely sure. However, I already have an idea. I can only say that I’ll try my best.”

Song Qiming quickly said,”ruofei, just try your best. Weiwei’s condition is very complicated. Even many experts in 301 Hospital are helpless. We’ve tried many methods in Chinese medicine, but none of them worked. So, don’t be stressed.”

“That’s right, that’s right,” Fang Liyun chimed in,”doctor Xia, no matter what the result is, we’re very grateful to you!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.”Relax. Don’t keep thinking about this. It’s good for your recovery.”

Xia ruofei was talking to Song Wei.

Song Wei gently nodded and said,”I know, thank you ...”

She sighed in her heart. This kind of pain of walking step by step towards death, this kind of helplessness of knowing that there was a bottomless abyss not far away but still involuntarily moving forward, how could people who had never experienced it understand?

Song Wei did not have much hope for Xia ruofei. In fact, she had already experienced the process of anxiety, disappointment, reignited hope, and finally, complete despair. Now, even she did not dare to hope that her condition would improve.

Song Wei could only stay at home every day. Other than watching movies and TV shows on the internet, she also kept in touch with her friends in the archeological team through social software so that she could find out about the situation of the two team members who had been poisoned.

Their condition was also developing rapidly. One of them had already fallen into a deep coma. According to the condition of the team member who died first, this one would probably only be able to hold on for about a week.

In fact, among song Qiming’s family, Fang Liyun and Song Wei did not have much confidence in Xia ruofei. Song Qiming, on the other hand, was still hoping for a miracle because of elder song.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Secretary song, Auntie Fang, I’ll leave this half bottle of medicine to you. Remember, only take it when the patient faints again.”

“Okay, okay. Thank you, Dr. Xia.” Fang Liyun quickly took the small porcelain bottle and held it in her arms like a treasure.

Xia ruofei said,”I’ll go back first. If everything goes well, I should be able to prepare the medicine in two or three days. I’ll come back then.”

“Ah?” song Qiming quickly replied. Ruofei, it’s almost time for dinner, let’s eat before you leave!”

“Yeah, yeah!” Fang Liyun immediately agreed. I’ve already asked little Luo to prepare it. It’s just a simple meal!”

Xia ruofei smiled and shook his head.””Saving a life is like putting out a fire. I’d better hurry up and make the medicine ...”VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience
