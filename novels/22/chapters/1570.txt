Chapter 1571: An unexpected surprise (2)

Translator: 549690339

Song Wei was a little embarrassed and said,”Is it very powerful? I don’t know either! I just followed the chant step by step. There was no movement at the beginning, so I thought I couldn’t cultivate ...”

Xia ruofei did not know whether to laugh or cry,”do you think cultivation is like eating and drinking?” Some people couldn’t even sense Qi for months. Even the most talented people would rarely be able to cultivate their first wisp of Qi in such a short time! If word of this gets out, those with average talent would probably find a rope and hang themselves ...”

Song Wei blushed and said,”I don’t know either. It’s mainly because I don’t have a reference!”

Xia ruofei said,”since you’re talented in this area, our chances of defeating the peach blossom miasma will be higher!” I didn’t expect you to have such a strong affinity with spiritual energy. It’s really an unexpected surprise ...”

At this point, Xia ruofei suddenly had a flash of inspiration and realized a possibility.

Heart – concentrating grass!

Xia ruofei immediately thought of the pained expression on Xia Qing’s face when she heard that he was going to use the heart – concentrating grass to save song Wei. Xia ruofei clearly remembered that Xia Qing had said that after Song Wei took the heart – concentrating grass, her soul would be greatly nourished and might be stronger than ordinary people’s soul.

The path of cultivation was difficult. Physical conditions were one aspect, but in the end, it still depended on one’s soul talent. The stronger one’s soul was, the greater one’s affinity with spiritual Qi would be. Naturally, one would be able to achieve twice the result with half the effort when cultivating.

It seemed like Song Wei had profited from her misfortune this time. The heart concentrating grass had changed her talent to a large extent.

From this, it could be seen that the heart concentrating grass was indeed a very heaven – defying spiritual medicine.

However, Xia ruofei did not feel any heartache at all when he used this spiritual herb on Song Wei.

Xia ruofei didn’t reveal his guess.

It’s better to let her think that I’m gifted! This way, I’ll be more confident in my cultivation ... Xia ruofei thought to himself.

Naturally, Song Wei was very happy. She asked,”RUO Fei, what should we do next?”

Xia ruofei pondered for a moment and said,”the true Qi in your dantian is still very weak. It’ll be difficult to complete a full circulation with this trace of true Qi ...”

If the two of them were to enter a coordinated cultivation state, the amount of true energy that Xia ruofei released would have to be about the same as the amount of true energy in Song Wei’s body. Otherwise, the balance would be broken and they would not be able to achieve the effect of cultivation.

In the process of cultivation, the meridians that the true energy passed through would also absorb the true energy to a certain extent, and continue to grow.

The true Qi in Song Wei’s body was still too weak. It would be completely absorbed by her meridians before she could even complete a Qi circulation.

Without completing the Qi circulation, the genuine Qi would not be able to grow endlessly, and the cultivation would not be able to continue.

Xia ruofei continued,”so, you should continue to use the” primogenitor Scripture “to absorb the spiritual Qi in the spiritual crystal. Try your best to strengthen this trace of true Qi. Then, we can cultivate together ...”

When Song Wei heard the word “combine,” she blushed for no reason.

Xia ruofei didn’t notice. Seeing that Song Wei didn’t say anything, he continued,””Sharpening a knife won’t delay the work of cutting wood! Moreover, you’re so talented in cultivation. This process won’t waste too much time ...”

Song Wei quickly adjusted her mood and said,””I know! I’ll continue cultivating then ...”

She closed her eyes and then opened them again. She looked at Xia ruofei and said,””Why don’t you ... Wait outside the formation! You don’t have to stay here with me ... Besides ... I’m a little uncomfortable with you watching me. I’m afraid it’s not easy for me to calm down ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Okay, okay, okay!” Then cultivate well, and if you’re hungry, eat something. You must remember that haste makes waste, and if you’re too eager for success, you might really go crazy!”

Xia ruofei was also worried that Song Wei was in a hurry to solve the hidden danger of the peach blossom miasma, which would cause problems in her mentality when she cultivated, so he gave her a small scare.

“Don’t worry!”Song Wei nodded. We are from the archeology Department, and we are very patient ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. He stood up and walked out of the formation. After taking a step, he stopped and turned back, smiling.”But ... You just said that you would feel uncomfortable with me by your side. You have to overcome this as soon as possible! The “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” is mainly cultivated by two people. How will you enter the cultivation state then?”

Song Wei blushed and said,”I know, I know. You can leave now!” Oh right, you might as well go to the bedroom and rest for a while! You’re not allowed to watch me cultivate ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and waved at Song Wei. Then, he stepped out of the array.

He walked into the bedroom as he was told. However, the time inside and outside the formation was 90 times slower, so Xia ruofei could not stay outside the formation for too long. He walked to the window, lit a cigarette, and took a short break.

It had only been about ten minutes.

In reality, Song Wei had already spent 15 to 16 hours in the time formation.

Xia ruofei returned to the living room and walked into the time formation.

He saw that Song Wei was still cultivating with her eyes closed, so he didn’t disturb her. He waited until Song Wei opened her eyes before he said, “Don’t tell me you haven’t rested and have been cultivating all this time?”

Song Wei avoided Xia ruofei’s gaze and said weakly,”I stopped to eat something in the middle!”

After saying that, she pointed to the biscuit packaging beside her and said,””You see! I ate half a box of biscuits!”

“You can’t do this. Your body won’t be able to take it ...” Xia ruofei said.”You have to sleep for a while now ...”

Counting the time before, Song Wei had been cultivating for a day and a night without rest. Even Xia ruofei could not take it. One should know that cultivation was a very boring thing. Perhaps the body did not feel tired, but the spirit could not take it.

“I think I’m in a pretty good state!” Song Wei said.

She didn’t want to stop so easily. On one hand, she wanted to solve the problem of the peach blossom miasma as soon as possible. On the other hand, it was her first time stepping into the realm of cultivation. She was like a child who had just gotten a new toy. Everything was full of novelty for her.

“That’s supported by willpower. This definitely won’t do.” Xia ruofei said,”I’ve said it before. Haste makes waste. If you can’t strike a balance between work and rest, it’s easy for problems to arise in your cultivation! I’m not trying to scare you ...”

“Then, you should check the results of my cultivation first!” Song Wei said expectantly.

Xia ruofei said,”let’s not worry about that for now. You must sleep for eight hours. I will plan your next cultivation. You can’t be so persistent!”

“Alright ...” Song Wei said, feeling wronged.

Seeing this, Xia ruofei smiled.”I will maintain this time formation. Eight hours is equivalent to five or six minutes in the outside world. It won’t waste much of your time!”

Then, Xia ruofei pulled Song Wei up and spread the blanket on the sofa.”I won’t be setting up the array again, you can sleep here ...”

Song Wei’s heart was filled with warmth. She nodded and said,”I know ...”

Song Wei lay on the sofa obediently and let Xia ruofei cover her with the blanket. She felt happy as if someone was taking care of her.

Xia ruofei said,”I will wait for you to fall asleep before I leave the array. Then, I will wait outside until the time is up. I will wake you up. You are not allowed to cultivate secretly!”

In fact, Xia ruofei had already ‘confiscated’ the crystals so Song Wei could not cultivate even if she wanted to.

Song Wei nodded her head lightly and closed her eyes.

Xia ruofei sat at the side and watched. In fact, Song Wei was already very tired. So, her breathing became very stable very quickly and she quickly entered a state of deep sleep.

Xia ruofei stood up carefully and tucked Song Wei in. Then, he left the time formation quietly.
