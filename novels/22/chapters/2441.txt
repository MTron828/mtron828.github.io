2442 A heaven – defying inheritance (1)

Xia ruofei’s expression relaxed.

However, he didn’t take out the ‘heaven’ word jade talisman immediately. Instead, he carefully observed every formation pattern that had been fused.

After a while, Xia ruofei casually erased the array pattern that he had spent five days to inscribe.

Although the formation pattern looked exactly the same as the pattern on the heaven jade talisman, he could still find a few minor flaws when he carefully compared it with his mental power.

Xia ruofei would not allow such a flaw to exist.

If he ignored these small flaws and tried to unlock the heaven jade talisman by force, the failure would be a small matter. However, if the Jade talisman was damaged, Xia ruofei would have no time to regret.

With the experience of unlocking the human and earth Jade talismans, Xia ruofei was not in a hurry.

He knew that the most difficult part was actually the first successful inscription. Now that he was able to inscribe a complete array pattern, it was only a matter of time before he polished off some small flaws.

After Xia ruofei rested for a while, he started to carve the runes again.

As expected, he didn’t encounter too many obstacles this time. Everything went smoothly from beginning to end. After about an hour, he carved and fused the array runes again.

After Xia ruofei observed it carefully, he erased the array pattern again and started to carve it again.

Xia ruofei repeated the process over and over again. He used all his energy to carve the runes and personally erased them again and again.

Although it seemed like a futile effort, if a cultivator who was proficient in arrays were here, they would realize that every array pattern that Xia ruofei drew was more perfect and in line with the way of nature.

The number of small flaws in the array pattern due to the proficiency of the technique and the control of spiritual power was also decreasing.

Just like that, after a whole day and night, when Xia ruofei once again drew the array pattern that he was so familiar with, his eyes revealed a trace of anticipation.

During the entire process of carving the runes, Xia ruofei felt that it was smooth and natural. This feeling was hard to come by and when it appeared, it was usually when he was performing beyond his usual level.

After a day and a night of practice, Xia ruofei was getting more and more skilled at carving the array pattern. The flaws in the array pattern were rapidly reduced, and there were even a few times when it was close to perfection.

Xia ruofei was full of anticipation for the array runes that he would carve this time. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

He immediately released his mental energy and carefully performed a “carpet check” on the array pattern. Starting from every small array pattern, every arc, and every detail, he examined the set of array patterns bit by bit.

Under the effect of his powerful mental energy, every detail of the formation pattern was revealed.

This examination lasted for an entire hour. When Xia ruofei finished examining the last small array pattern, he couldn’t help but reveal a satisfied smile.

He had finally met the requirements!

At least Xia ruofei had reached the standard in his heart. As for whether this standard was high enough and whether he could unlock the heaven – ranked jade talisman, Xia ruofei had some confidence. After all, this was not his first time unlocking a jade talisman. With the experience from the previous two times, he knew what kind of standard the array pattern had to reach.

Hence, Xia ruofei did not hesitate and took out the ancient heaven jade talisman.

The Jade talisman floated in front of Xia ruofei with the help of the invisible spatial force.

Not far from the Jade talisman was the set of formation patterns that glowed with a faint golden light.

Xia ruofei’s mind moved, and the set of complicated array patterns formed by spiritual power slowly floated towards the heaven jade talisman.

Finally, the array pattern was imprinted on the heaven word jade talisman and perfectly matched with the patterns on the Jade talisman.

Streams of light lit up on the ‘heaven’ jade talisman. The formation patterns engraved on the Jade talisman also lit up one by one. Finally, the entire jade talisman lit up with a dazzling brilliance.

When the last formation pattern lit up, the dazzling light suddenly expanded and flew towards Xia ruofei like a waterfall. It went straight into his forehead.

Xia ruofei, who was already experienced, was prepared. He sat up straight and closed his eyes tightly. His face revealed a rare trace of nervousness.

A huge amount of information gushed into Xia ruofei’s mind.

Even though he had already experienced it, Xia ruofei still felt a sense of fullness after a second or two. Information was still pouring into his mind.

He revealed a pained expression, and the blue veins on his forehead also protruded.

Xia ruofei gritted his teeth and held on. He knew that the inheritance information in the Jade talisman was very precious. Although the process of inheritance was painful, under normal circumstances, it would not exceed his tolerance. At least, it would not cause too much danger.

At least, that was the case for the earth and human Jade talismans.

However, Xia ruofei’s cultivation level was not as high this time, especially in terms of physical strength. If he had unlocked the heaven jade talisman normally, he would have been safe. However, it was hard to say in this situation ...

When Xia ruofei made the decision to take out the heaven jade talisman by force, he was already mentally prepared.

He knew that there was a certain degree of danger in doing so. On the one hand, he might cause harm to his body in the process of breaking the light membrane. On the other hand, his cultivation level might not be high enough, and the amount of information in the inheritance might be too much for his body to handle.
