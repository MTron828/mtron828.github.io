Chapter 98: Healing (1)

Xia ruofei quickly got out of the car to check and saw a Black Dog lying by the wheel, wailing. One of its front legs was obviously twisted, and there was a lot of blood coming out of its head. It seemed to be seriously injured. At first, Xia ruofei felt relieved. Fortunately, he did not bump into anyone. But at the same time, he was a little worried. The dog was dirty and scarred. It was obvious that it was a stray dog. Although it was the dog that suddenly ran out from the side of the road and hit his car, the dog was so seriously injured now. If he ran away, it would probably die. Xia ruofei thought for a while and felt that it was a life after all. He would not be able to live without it. So, he walked over and squatted down to carefully examine the dog’s injury. The Black Dog saw Xia ruofei coming over and showed a vigilant look. It struggled and bared its teeth at Xia ruofei. Unfortunately, it was too seriously injured. As soon as it opened its mouth, blood foam flowed out. It did not look threatening at all. “Don’t be afraid. I’m here to save you ...” Xia ruofei said gently. At the same time, he stretched out his hand and gently stroked the Black Dog’s back. Perhaps it felt Xia ruofei’s kindness, the hostility in the Black Dog’s eyes gradually faded. Its body curled up slightly and kept trembling. It was obvious that it did not have long to live. Xia ruofei quickly summoned the spirit painting and took out a bottle of flower petal solution. Now, Xia ruofei would always keep a few bottles of petal solution in his storage space in case of emergency. One of the petals was mixed into the spatial spirit pond water and was split into three bottles. Xia ruofei pried open the Black Dog’s mouth and poured in a quarter of the petal solution. The Black Dog’s body suddenly trembled, and it seemed to be much more energetic than before. The color in its eyes gradually disappeared, and it slowly returned. Xia ruofei was already used to this. He took out a first aid kit from the space and treated the Black Dog’s wound with great familiarity. After the Black Dog drank the petal solution, it no longer had any wariness towards Xia ruofei. Instead, it showed some intimacy and allowed Xia ruofei to treat its injuries. After cleaning and disinfecting the small wounds, Xia ruofei took out a splints from the first aid kit and said to the Black Dog,””It might hurt a little, bear with it ...” The Black Dog naturally did not understand what he was saying, but it revealed a very human – like confused expression. Xia ruofei smiled and reached out to feel the Black Dog’s broken leg. Then, he used force to fix the broken bone. The Black Dog whined in pain, but it seemed to know that Xia ruofei was helping it, so other than the pain, it did not have any other extreme reaction. Xia ruofei skillfully used a splint to fix the broken leg of the Black Dog. Then, he poured some flower petal solution on the broken leg. The Black Dog immediately felt a cooling sensation and the pain was greatly reduced. It could not help but let out a comfortable cry and used its nose to rub against Xia ruofei’s hand, acting very affectionately. Xia ruofei thought,’the spiritual Qi in the spirit map space is rich, so it should be very beneficial for the Black Dog’s recovery.’ He gently picked up the Black Dog and sent it into the spirit map space with a thought. At the same time, Xia ruofei used his mind to check the situation in the space. The Black Dog seemed to be a little stunned by the sudden change in its surroundings, and it looked around nervously. However, the environment in the interspace was far better than the outside world. Very soon, the Black Dog was no longer nervous. It laid on the ground in a very comfortable position with its eyes slightly closed, as if it had fallen asleep. Only then did Xia ruofei put the painting away in his body. Just as he was about to get into the car, the phone in his pocket rang again. He had bumped into the black Dog just to answer this call. After that, he had been busy treating the Black Dog, so his phone rang for a while before it stopped. He didn’t expect the person who called him to be so persistent. After a while, he called again. Xia ruofei took out his phone and saw that it was his classmate of six years, Guan Ping. Guanping was a real estate agent. Previously, Xia ruofei was in a hurry to sell the house to treat Hu Zi’s mother’s illness. Through Guanping, he managed to sell the house in a very short time. Ling Qingxue had also found the address of the group rental apartment that Xia ruofei had rented at that time through Guan Ping. Xia ruofei picked up the phone and asked,”Guanping, what’s up?” “Why didn’t you pick up the phone?” Guan Ping said teasingly,”don’t tell me you’re having fun with the campus Belle, Ling?” “What are you saying? What campus Belle Ling?” Xia ruofei said guiltily. “Acting! Are you still pretending?” Guan Ping laughed out loud.”Ling Qingxue, the campus Belle, even took the initiative to ask me for your address. It’s really hard for a girl to woo a guy!” “Guanping, if you have something to say, say it. Why are you always talking about Ling Qingxue?” Xia ruofei said,”don’t tell me you’re interested in her?” “Of course I’m interesting! She’s rich and has long legs, who wouldn’t like her?” Guan Ping laughed,”it’s a pity that he’s only interested in you! As a brother, I can only wash my face with tears to fulfill your wish ...” “Nonsense!” Xia ruofei laughed and scolded him.”Are you okay or not? I’m hanging up if there’s nothing else! I still have to drive ...” “Don ‘t, don’ t, don ‘t, there’s something, there’s something!” Guan Ping quickly asked,”are you free tomorrow night? Yuan Lili is going to get engaged, and she wants to invite our classmates for a gathering before the engagement. This year is exactly ten years after she graduated from junior high school!” “Yuan Lili?” An image of a young girl appeared in Xia ruofei’s mind.”She’s getting engaged? Time really flies ...” Yuan Lili was Xia ruofei and Guan Ping’s junior high school classmate. At that time, she was the kind of person who didn’t show off. However, if she could take the initiative to invite them to a class reunion, she must have been doing well. Many things could happen in ten years. “It’s not that fast for a girl to get engaged at the age of 24!” Guan Ping teased,”you’re almost done talking with the campus Belle, so you can get engaged! Don’t hold him up!” Seeing that Guan Ping was talking about Ling Qingxue again, Xia ruofei quickly changed the topic and asked,””Are there many students attending tomorrow night?” Xia ruofei joined the Army after graduating from high school. He had almost no contact with his middle school classmates, and he could not even remember their names. “At most ten or twenty! Many of them have gone abroad, and some are working in other places. ” Guan Ping said,”I’ve been hanging out in San Shan and I’ve been in contact with my classmates the most. So, Yuan Lili asked me to do my best to help out with the arrangements.” Sanshan city was a famous hometown for overseas immigrants. Almost every family had relatives overseas, and many people went overseas to work or study. “Then ...” Xia ruofei hesitated. He had almost cut off all contact with his middle school classmates, and they must have been very unfamiliar with each other after not seeing each other for ten years. In fact, such a gathering was actually quite boring. “Ruofei, you should participate! I don’t have much to talk about with my classmates who are doing well, so just take it as being my companion!” Guan Ping advised,”that’s right, little fatty has also confirmed that he will be participating.” Fatty’s name was pang Hao. When they were in middle school, he and Guan Ping were Xia ruofei’s closest classmates. Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””Alright then! Send me the time and place on WeChat later!” “Pick me up at my company tomorrow at six!” Guan Ping laughed.”I’ll hitch a ride from you.” “No problem!” Xia ruofei agreed readily. After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei continued to drive back to the holiday villa. He went straight upstairs to his bedroom and took out the spirit map scroll from his palm. He wanted to go in and see how the injured Black Dog had recovered. [PS] it’s being strongly recommended. Please give me your recommendation votes~~~
