Chapter 712: Xue Fei shriveled in fear (3)

Lin Qiao stopped and said,”Brother ruofei, this is an Apple Store! We’ll ...”

“That’s right! Although this M Nation company isn’t a good company and their products are very expensive, the quality and performance are very good. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you’ll need it for University. We’ll pick the good ones!”

“But ...” Lin Qiao said,”this is too expensive. I ... Don’t have enough money!”

“Silly girl! If I accompany you here, do you think I’ll let you pay for it?” Xia ruofei said.

“That won’t do!” Lin Qiao quickly said,”before we left, my mom repeatedly told me not to spend your money anymore ...”

“The general has disobeyed military orders!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Qiao’ er, this is a graduation gift from brother ruofei. Can you bear to reject it?”

“But ...”

“No buts!” Xia ruofei said,”let’s go in and take a look first! If you don’t like it, you can go to another shop! It doesn’t cost money to look at it ...”

“Okay ...” Lin Qiao reluctantly agreed.

This was a shop authorized by Apple. The shop area was very large, and there were many display stands in the middle of the shop with mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and other peripheral devices for customers to try out.

After all, Lin Qiao was still a high school girl. As soon as she entered the door, she was attracted by the dazzling array of exquisite products. A trace of Love appeared in her eyes, and she quickly went to experience it.

Lin Qiao was experiencing the entry – Level MacBookAir, which was priced at a little more than 6000 Yuan. The metallic appearance, beautiful system interface, and smooth operating experience quickly made her unable to let go.

Lin Qiao didn’t hide her love for this model of computer. She couldn’t help but hesitate. Qianqian’s mother gave her 5000 Yuan before she left, which was definitely enough to buy an ordinary laptop. However, Apple laptops were usually more expensive, with the most expensive being more than 20000 Yuan. This model only cost a little more than 6000 Yuan.

......

Why don’t I borrow a thousand Yuan from brother ruofei? Lin Qiao couldn’t help but have such a thought.

No. 8 high school, where Lin Qiao was from, was a key class in the province. Many of the students were the children of leading cadres, and many of them used Apple phones and laptops.

When Lin Qiao saw her classmates using Apple products, she would naturally be envious. However, she had been very sensible since she was young and never compared herself with her classmates, let alone beg her mother to buy one for her.

Now that she had graduated from high school, did well in the college entrance examination, and was going to buy a computer for college, Lin Qiao was really tempted by this computer.

Xia ruofei noticed Lin Qiao’s expression. He laughed and said, “Qiao’ er, there are a few more designs here. Come and try them on!”

Lin Qiao walked to Xia ruofei’s side and looked at the price tag first. It was the newly launched MacBookPro. The 15.4 – inch top – end version was priced at about 22000 Yuan.

Looking at the price, Lin Qiao couldn’t help but stick out her tongue and said,”This is too expensive ...”

“It doesn’t cost money to try!” Xia ruofei still said the same thing.”Come and try!”

Lin Qiao couldn’t resist the temptation and also tried it.

The MacBookPro was much better than the air in terms of both configuration and performance. Moreover, the high – definition screen experience was obviously better than the air. After trying it out for a while, Lin Qiao was actually reluctant to put it down.

Xia ruofei smiled and beckoned a shop assistant over.””Do you have the mcbookpro for this i7 processor in stock? I want to sell one!”

The shop assistant quickly said,”yes, yes. Sir, please come this way. I’ll pay for you immediately!”

Lin Qiao came back to her senses and quickly said,”Brother ruofei! This laptop is too expensive, I don’t want it ... I’ll just buy the air!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”since I’ve bought it, I’ll buy the best one. I’ll get it done in one go!” This arrangement is enough for you to use for four years in college, in case you have to replace it later!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“But ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,””It’s settled then. As your brother, I’ll give you a small gift. If you reject it, I’ll be sad!”

Xia ruofei then gestured to the shop assistant. The shop assistant immediately nodded and walked quickly to the cashier to get the bill.

Seeing Xia ruofei’s determination, Lin Qiao didn’t say anything more. She quickly glanced at Xia ruofei and said softly,””Brother ruofei, thank you!”

“Silly girl!” Xia ruofei ruffled Lin Qiao’s hair affectionately and took her hand to the cashier.

The shop assistant had already brought out a new machine that had not been opened. He quickly opened the bill and said,””Sir, please swipe your card here! If you buy our new MacBookPro today, we’ll give you a year’s membership as a gift. This is your password card, please keep it!”

Xia ruofei took the membership card and stuffed it into Lin Qiao’s hand. He grinned and said,””Just nice, it’ll be more convenient for you to watch dramas in the future!”

After Xia ruofei paid with his card, he picked up the box containing the computer and was about to leave with Lin Qiao.

Just then, the shop assistant who had been serving Xia ruofei called out from behind,””Sir, please wait! You have spent more than 20000 Yuan in our shop, so you can join our challenge!”
