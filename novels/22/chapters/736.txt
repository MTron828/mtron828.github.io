Chapter 737: Rising to fame (1)

When everyone returned to the sales office, Lin Qiao signed where she needed to sign and left the handling of the property ownership certificate to Liang Weimin. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

After that, they went to the nearest Xinhua Bookstore and bought a few software design tutorials before driving back to the farm together.

After returning home, Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao still didn’t seem to be in a good mood. In fact, they didn’t talk much on the road.

Xia ruofei realized that his decision was not right. A house that cost more than two million Yuan was nothing to Xia ruofei now, but to Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao, it was a height that they would never be able to reach in their lives.

In particular, Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao were not greedy people. On the contrary, although they were poor, they had strong characters and always insisted on working hard to change their lives by themselves.

Xia ruofei’s deepest impression was when he found out that Hu Zi’s mother was seriously ill and had no money for treatment when he first left the Army. Without hesitation, he urgently sold the only house in the family and sent Hu Zi’s mother all the money he had including his retirement fees anonymously.

However, in the face of such a fortune that could extend one’s life, Hu Zi’s mother insisted on not using it. Even if her illness was so serious that it was life – threatening, she still refused to use a single cent.

From another perspective, this truly reflected Hu Zi’s mother’s precious character.

Xia ruofei felt that although Hu Zi’s mother had no choice but to accept his ‘act first and report later’, it seemed to give them the feeling of accepting charity.

Xia ruofei often helped the mother and daughter, but giving a house was not the same as giving Taoyuan vegetables, chicken, duck, fish, and meat, or giving Lin Qiao some digital products after her college entrance examination.

After realizing this, Xia ruofei thought that he should do something. Otherwise, it would be bad if he left a grudge in the mother – daughter pair’s hearts.

Wouldn’t that be doing bad things with good intentions?

Hence, Xia ruofei, who had already walked up the stairs and was about to return to his room, suddenly stopped and returned to the living room.

......

Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao were also about to return to their rooms.

“Auntie, Qiao’ er!” Xia ruofei stopped them.

Hu ‘Zi’s mother turned around and asked with a smile,””Is there anything else, ruofei?”

Xia ruofei organized his words and smiled.””Auntie, I know that I made the decision to buy this house today and made you feel a little uncomfortable ...”

“Ruofei, Auntie knows you mean well ...”

“Auntie, let me finish first.” Xia ruofei said,”actually, my thinking is very simple. I just want to be filial to Hu Zi.”

At this point, Xia ruofei’s face revealed a look of reminiscence. He continued emotionally,””Hu Zi and I are life – and – Death brothers. When we joined the team, we swore that on the battlefield, everyone had to be prepared to take a bullet for their comrades. In fact, Hu Zi used his actions to fulfill his oath.”

Xia ruofei’s voice was a little choked as he said,””Aunty, the last words that Hu Zi left in this world often reverberate in my mind, and I can never forget them. He said,’ruofei, help me take care of my mother and sister ...'”

Xia ruofei’s gaze seemed to travel through time and space, back to the dangerous tropical forest. The sound of the sniper rifle seemed to still be in his ears. The hot blood that was gushing out of Lin Hu’s chest was so glaring. He used all his strength to turn his head and say to Xia ruofei,””Ruofei, help me ... Take care of my mom ... And my sister ...”

Xia ruofei’s voice trembled as he continued to speak to Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao,””I said to Hu,’don’t worry, from now on, your mother is my mother ...'”

Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao were already in tears. Hu Zi’s mother choked and said,””Ruofei, stop it! We all understand your feelings ...”

“No, Auntie, let me finish.” Xia ruofei said stubbornly,”actually, from that moment on, I took over the baton from Hu Zi. Taking care of you and letting you live a good life is my duty ...”

“I know, I know ...” Hu Zi’s mother mumbled with red eyes,”ruofei, you’ve already done very well.”

Xia ruofei shook his head.”Auntie, I really treat you like my own mother and Qiao’ er like my own little sister. My parents passed away in an accident when I was young. My only relative, my grandfather, also left me. I’ve been alone since then. There’s something I’ve always wanted to say ...”

“Ruofei, you speak.” Hu Zi’s mother said. She looked at Xia ruofei with love and a hint of heartache.

Xia ruofei continued,”Auntie, I’m a child without a father or mother now. I’ve promised Hu that I’d treat you like my own mother. So ... I want to acknowledge you as my godmother and take care of you on behalf of Hu. I hope you don’t mind.”

Hu Zi’s mother’s lips were trembling. She was also very excited.

Her son’s early death was a permanent scar for her. However, Xia ruofei’s appearance changed her family, which was plagued with disasters, and she and Lin Qiao were freed from endless suffering.
