Chapter 37: The Most Awesome Transfer Student

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

At two o’clock sharp, Xia Ruofei brought Lin Qiao downstairs.

Hu Zi’s mother had yet to fully recover, so Xia Ruofei let her rest in the house.

With Xia Ruofei around, Hu Zi’s mother was very relieved and did not insist on following them to the school.

The two of them walked to the first floor and saw that Wu Liqian had just walked into the lobby. After a few pleasantries, the three of them got into Wu Liqian’s Passat. Xia Ruofei took the front passenger seat, and Wu Liqian took Lin Qiao’s hand and got into the backseat.

As a third-year arts student, Lin Qiao naturally knew of the famous No. 8 High School, so she was both excited and nervous along the way.

Wu Liqian could tell that Lin Qiao was a little nervous. She smiled and said.

“Little Lin, don’t worry. The Education Bureau has already informed them. When you reach there, you can transfer directly into the top class for arts. If you can’t keep up with progress for the time being, it’s fine. The school will arrange for experienced teachers to tutor you.”

“Thank you, Secretary Wu!” Lin Qiao said obediently.

Wu Liqian smiled and said.

“Hey! Why are you calling me Secretary Wu? Just call me Sister Wu.”

“Oh… Thank you, Sister Wu!” Lin Qiao blushed slightly and said softly.

Xia Ruofei also smiled and turned around.

“Sister Wu, thank you so much for this matter! Please help me convey my gratitude to Mayor Tian!”

“Little Xia, don’t stand on ceremony!” Wu Liqian said. “It’s just a small matter.”

As they talked, the car reached No. 8 High School and stopped in front of an office building.

The principal, vice principal, dean, and other teachers of Class One of No. 8 High School were already waiting downstairs. They had already received a call from the director of the Education Bureau himself and knew that it was Mayor Tian’s secretary who was bringing the transfer student to report that day. Naturally, they did not dare to treat them poorly.

If it wasn’t for the fact that Wu Liqian didn’t want to attract too much attention, the Director of Education Bureau might have personally accompanied her. Who wouldn’t want to seize the opportunity to get close to the mayor? Especially since Wu Liqian’s boss was very likely to become a member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Committee.

“Director Wu, hello! Welcome to No. 8 High School for inspection and guidance!” Principal Rao of No. 8 High School took a step forward and said enthusiastically.

Wu Liqian had a smile on her face. She shook Principal Rao’s hand gently and said.

“Principal, I’m not here to inspect and provide guidance. Mayor Tian only gave me one task today, which is to send Student Lin Qiao over to report.”

Principal Rao had already paid a lot of attention to the student because the Director of Education Bureau had personally informed him. Now that he heard Wu Liqian’s words, he immediately understood that this matter was not Wu Liqian’s private matter, but Mayor Tian’s personal instructions. The importance of the matter immediately rose to another level in his heart.

“Yes, yes, yes, it is important for her to report…” Principal Rao said with a warm smile. “We have already completed the relevant procedures.”

Then, Principal Rao pointed at a slightly reserved middle-aged woman beside him and said.

“This is Teacher Xu, the form teacher of the arts class.”

“Hello, Director Wu!” Teacher Xu hurriedly came forward to greet her, looking a little reserved.

Wu Liqian gave a friendly smile and said.

“Teacher Xu, please take care of Lin Qiao as she learns in your class in the future!”

“Of course, of course!”

Principal Rao also said from the side.

“Teacher Xu, Lin Qiao has just transferred over. You have to pay more attention to her studies and life. Help her integrate into the new class as soon as possible!”

“I will, Principal,” Teacher Xu said quickly.

Xia Ruofei couldn’t help but feel a little emotional as she watched from the side. The school leaders lined up to welcome her, and the form teacher was seemed to be stepping on thin ice. Lin Qiao could probably be considered the most impressive transfer student in the history of No. 8 High School!

Fortunately, Xia Ruofei also knew Lin Qiao’s character. He believed that she wouldn’t become complacent because of this and lose her position.

Principal Rao looked at Wu Liqian and asked.

“Director Wu, then… should we invite Student Lin Qiao and Teacher Xu to meet the students in class?”

“Sure.” Wu Liqian nodded and smiled. Then, she said to Lin Qiao, “Little Lin, then follow your teacher to class! If you have any difficulties in the future, just call Sister Wu directly!”

Xia Ruofei also said.

“Qiao’er, when you reach the new class, you have to study hard and get along well with your classmates, understand?”

Lin Qiao nodded and said seriously.

“Yes, I will! Thank you, Brother Ruofei! Thank you, Sister Wu!”

Xia Ruofei and Wu Liqian smiled and nodded. The two of them watched as Lin Qiao gradually walked away with Teacher Xu.

Principal Rao very politely invited Wu Liqian to inspect the school and give feedback. However, Wu Liqian’s purpose for this trip was not for anything else, so she politely declined.

She got into the car with Xia Ruofei, and the school leaders waved goodbye.

The car drove out of the gates of No. 8 High School before Wu Liqian asked.

“Little Xia, where are you going? I’ll drive you!”

Xia Ruofei said.

“Sister Wu, just drop me off somewhere in front. I’m going out to find a place to rent this afternoon. I have no specific destination.”

Wu Liqian had obviously misunderstood and thought that Xia Ruofei was looking for a house for Lin Qiao and her mother. She smiled and said.

“By the way, I forgot to tell you just now. I happened to hear this morning that a colleague’s house is being rented out. He bought a house outside and moved out. The family building is two-bedroom and very close to No. 8 High School. Personally, I think it’s very suitable for Lin Qiao and her mother. And the rent isn’t expensive. It’s only 800 yuan a month. How about that? Do you want to see the house?”

Xia Ruofei was immediately tempted. At the same time, he could not help but look at Wu Liqian in a different light.

Although Wu Liqian had said it casually, it was obviously not as simple as “happening to hear about it.” Whether it was the location, size, or rent, this house was simply tailored for Lin Qiao and her mother. Wu Liqian had definitely put in a lot of effort to find it.

It had to be said that this secretary was smart and meticulous. Wu Liqian knew what Xia Ruofei meant by saving Professor Tian’s life, and she also knew very well that Tian Huilan appreciated Xia Ruofei very much. Therefore, she was also very concerned about Xia Ruofei and spared no effort.

Xia Ruofei pondered for a moment and said/

“Sister Wu, since you have helped us find it, it must be very suitable! But since Auntie and Qiao’er are living in the house. why don’t I bring them to see the house after Qiao’er finishes school? You don’t have to personally be there. Just give us the landlord’s contact information and help us inform the landlord!”

“Sure, no problem!” Wu Liqian said readily.

Then she asked with a smile.

“Since you don’t have to look for a house anymore, where are you going now?”

Xia Ruofei was stunned for a moment. He smiled awkwardly and said.

“Sister Wu, actually, I want to rent a house myself. Before you called me, I was just about to wander around and try my luck!”

“Oh? You live alone?” Wu Liqian asked. “Then what kind of house are you looking for? Your Sister Wu knows quite a lot of people. I might be able to help you find a suitable one.”

Xia Ruofei thought for a moment and said.

“Wu Liqian, the house I’m looking for might not be easy to find…”

“Oh? Tell me about it first!” Wu Liqian became even more interested.

“First I hope it’s a house that is somewhere quieter. It doesn’t matter if it’s a little more remote. There must be a separate yard and not many other houses around. That would be best!”

Wu Liqian couldn’t help but laugh.

“Little Xia, look at you… Are you intending to become a hermit?”

“Hehe… I like peace and quiet…” Xia Ruofei said. “That’s why I said it might not be easy to find! It’s fine, Sister Wu. I’ll go to the suburbs myself and look for a suitable one.” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Wu Liqian pondered for a moment and said with a smile.

“Little Xia, now that you mention it, I do know a house that fits all the conditions you mentioned!”
