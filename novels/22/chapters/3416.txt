Chapter 3417: The appearance of a super – grade golden core (1)

Translator: 549690339

Ling Qingxue, who was beside Xia ruofei, did the same. After she consumed the Vermilion Jade Fruit, she could not help but enter a state of cultivation. She sat cross – legged on the ground and continuously circulated her cultivation technique to absorb the essence of the Vermilion Jade Fruit. After a while, there was a mist above her head.

Xia ruofei’s momentum was like a hot knife cutting through butter. Thick vital Qi surged through his meridians and began to rush towards the bottleneck of the early golden core stage.

Xia ruofei felt that his condition was surprisingly good. Cultivators were very sensitive to their own condition, especially when they were close to a breakthrough. Most people would be able to sense it.

The rich energy of the Vermilion Jade Fruit was like a rocket booster. It laid a solid foundation for Xia ruofei’s breakthrough.

Xia ruofei soon entered a state of selflessness. There was not a single stray thought in his mind, including the desire to break through. It had been expelled from his mind. The only thought now was to cultivate.

Xia ruofei quickly realized that the energy contained in the Vermilion Jade Fruit was not only majestic but also easy to absorb. Basically, after every circulation, his vital Qi would grow a little. This change was very obvious. He did not even need to deliberately observe and could easily notice it.

Very quickly, Xia ruofei felt the bottleneck of the beginner stage of the Golden elixir realm begin to loosen. There was still a lot of energy in the Vermilion Jade Fruit that had not been absorbed.

It was stable! Two words appeared in Xia ruofei’s mind.

Sure enough, after a while, Xia ruofei seemed to hear a cracking sound. The vital Qi broke through the bottleneck of the early golden elixir realm.

At that moment, the yuan Qi Whirlpool in Xia ruofei’s dantian had reached its maximum speed. The purple – Gold yuan Qi Pearl in the center of the whirlpool was like a black hole, opening its mouth wide to swallow the yuan Qi.

The moment the early – Stage golden core bottleneck was broken through, the entire Yuan Qi vortex seemed to stagnate for a short while. Immediately after, a large amount of Yuan Qi surged into the yuan Qi vortex and directly entered the purple – Gold yuan Qi Pearl that was like a black hole in the center of the vortex.

After the purple – Gold yuan Qi Pearl absorbed the yuan Qi, it began to grow at a speed visible to the naked eye.

The yuan Qi vortex had already stopped spinning, and the yuan Qi in the vortex was constantly being absorbed by the purple – Gold yuan Qi Pearl.

Just like that, the essence Qi vortex became smaller and smaller, while the essence Qi condensed Pearl became bigger and bigger.

To be more precise, this was no longer an essence energy Pearl, but a true golden core.

The most obvious sign of breaking through from the early stage to the middle stage of the Golden core realm was the disappearance of the yuan Qi vortex. All the yuan Qi in the body would flow into the center of the original Yuan Qi vortex and finally form the Golden core.

As Xia ruofei was cultivating the great Dao Arts, a purple – Gold vital energy Pearl appeared in the center of the originally empty vital energy Whirlpool.

At that time, the mountain river spiritual map, the previous owner of the spiritual map, spiritual master Shan He, had told Xia ruofei that only by practicing the great way formula could the Pearl form in the dantian. Xia ruofei’s purple – Gold pearl was even rarer. According to the standard of the ninth – grade golden core, Xia ruofei’s golden core had already surpassed this standard and could be called a Supreme – grade golden core.

At this time, the Super – grade golden core was gradually taking shape.

The vital Qi in Xia ruofei’s body gushed into the purple – Gold vital Qi Pearl crazily while the remaining energy of the Vermillion Jade Fruit was also being absorbed rapidly. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The purple – Gold Origin Energy Pearl kept growing like a balloon.

In the end, a purple – Gold golden elixir appeared in Xia ruofei’s dantian. It was spinning in the center of his dantian.

The yuan Qi vortex from before had disappeared without a trace.

Xia ruofei was still sitting cross – legged with his eyes closed. The “great Dao technique” was still circulating rapidly because the energy of the Vermilion Jade Fruit had not been completely absorbed.

The purple – Gold golden core in his dantian didn’t look particularly solid. Although it had formed a golden core, there was still some fog – like Yuan Qi around it, which made it look a little weak.

But this was already a genuine mid – Stage golden core.

It was not an exaggeration to say that Xia ruofei’s golden core was much more solid than the Golden core of an ordinary intermediate golden core cultivator.

The middle stage of the Golden core was originally the initial stage of the formation of the Golden core. As for the early stage of the Golden core, strictly speaking, it could not be considered the Golden core stage, because there was no golden core in the dantian of the cultivators at this stage, but only a Yuan Qi vortex.

However, the bottleneck to form the yuan Qi vortex was far greater than the bottleneck to transform the yuan Qi vortex into a golden core. After the formation of the yuan Qi vortex, the cultivation base of the cultivator would be greatly improved, so this stage was also classified as the Golden core stage.

When one reached the middle stage of the Aurous core stage, they would have truly formed the Aurous core. However, this was only the initial stage. The Golden core in the dantian of a cultivator was already very empty.

Once the Golden core was completely condensed, it meant that the cultivator had entered the late stage of the Golden core.

From the middle stage of the Aurous core stage to the late stage, it was actually a process of continuous compression and tempering of the Aurous core.

Xia ruofei absorbed the energy of the Vermilion Jade Fruit in a daze. The purplish – Gold golden elixir was becoming more and more solid.

However, this process was very slow. Even with the Vermilion Jade Fruit, it was only a little faster. In fact, if Xia ruofei didn’t feel the change in his cultivation, he wouldn’t be able to notice the Golden core.

Unknowingly, Xia ruofei had finished absorbing all the energy from the Vermilion Jade Fruit..
