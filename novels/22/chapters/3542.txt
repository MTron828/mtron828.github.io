Song Rui was in a good mood. Whether Xia ruofei did it or not, at least the marriage with the Li family of the Kyushu group was completely impossible.

Everyone's eyes were on Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.""Grandpa song, aunty song, I don't intend to prove anything, nor do I want to show off my strength. I'm just giving a simple example to show that as long as you have absolute strength, you don't need to get many things through marriage."

Xia ruofei's words were clear. Although he did not want to prove anything, the truth was already so obvious. As long as he wanted to, the project that the song family had been unable to negotiate for a long time could be easily settled. If they all had such strength, why would there be a marriage alliance?

In fact, Xia ruofei had already prepared other ways to show off her strength.

However, when he heard song Zhilan say that the marriage partner was Li Yifu's grandniece, he naturally gave up his original plan. It was much easier to exert influence on the Kyushu group directly through Li Yifu.

Song Zhilan's face was still filled with disbelief even after she hung up the phone.

Not only did li chenghui make a huge concession on the prosperous nine provinces project, but he also took the initiative to invite the song family to join the Kyushu group's big logistics project. Even if it was an apology for the marriage, this gift was too heavy.

It was to the extent that the trace of displeasure in song Zhilan's heart had already flown to the ninth heaven.

In fact, Li Yifu's family was definitely not as powerful as the song family. However, the song family also had an obvious weakness, which was that their influence outside of Huaxia had been sharply reduced.

This was also a common situation for some of the big families in the country.

On the other hand, the Li family was the exact opposite. Li Yifu's family had always had a great influence in the Western world, which was dominated by the United States and Europe.

The song family hoped to expand their business overseas, and if they could get the support of the Kyushu group, it would naturally be much smoother.

Today, li chenghui had invited song Zhilan to participate in the Kyushu group's logistics project, which was equivalent to giving the song family wings to enter the United States and Europe. Such an opportunity was what song Zhilan had always dreamed of.

the excitement on her face didn't fade. she said to eccentric song," dad! this was truly an unexpected surprise! he didn't expect the kyushu group to be so sincere! i can finally take a big step forward in the sea investment i planned this year!"Findd new ùíîtories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

elder song's expression was calm. he didn't reply to song zhilan, but looked at xia ruofei and asked with a smile," "ruo fei, is this what you want to prove to us?"

"ruo fei?" song zhilan also recovered from her excitement and looked at xia ruofei with suspicion.

deep down, song zhilan didn't really believe it. although xia ruofei was very outstanding and his career was developing well, in song zhilan's opinion, there was still a big gap between him and the nine states group. it was impossible for him to have any say in the company. how could he make li chenghui reject the marriage in such a short time and make a phone call? and then, he even gave the song family such a big profit?

however, her rationality told her that it was very likely. otherwise, there wouldn't be such a coincidence. the moment xia ruofei finished his phone call, li chenghui had clearly rejected the marriage.
