Chapter 1077: Chapter 680 – Temporary visit to Beijing (1)

Translator: 549690339

The plan was very detailed, from poster production, video shooting to TV advertisements, online advertisements, outdoor advertisements, and even the preliminary structure of the press conference PowerPoint.

However, Xia ruofei was getting drowsy.

He had absolute trust in Feng Jing’s abilities. Since it was something his general manager could do, he naturally lost interest.

However, Feng Rao had reported to him out of respect, so Xia ruofei could only listen patiently. In reality, his mind had already wandered.

Just as Xia ruofei was nodding and thinking, he suddenly heard Feng Jing say,””Chairman, regarding the product endorsement, we’ve contacted the recently popular singer of the Jade lady sect, Dong Xinyu, and she has agreed to meet us in Beijing tomorrow. “I hope you can come with me. On one hand, it’s to show that we value it. On the other hand, I’ve considered that the endorsement fee may be a relatively large expense. If you’re present, you can make the decision directly ...”

Xia ruofei had been absent – minded the whole time, so he habitually nodded and said,””Alright ...”

Then, he immediately reacted and sat up straight, saying,””I’m going too? There’s no need for this, right? Your general manager is personally taking action, isn’t that enough? As for the final decision ... As long as you think the price is right, you can just set it. I believe you. ”

“Chairman,” Feng Jing said with a bitter smile,”the endorsement fee isn’t a small sum. I can’t make the decision.”

Feng Jing really didn’t have the energy to criticize this lazy Chairman anymore. He actually wanted to leave such a big matter to others.

Moreover, many men would want to get close to the female celebrity, Dong Xinyu. Xia ruofei, on the other hand, avoided her like a snake. It was really enough that a man could be lazy to this extent ...

Xia ruofei touched his nose and said with a smile,””If you really don’t think you can make the decision, you can ask me directly on WeChat! Boss Feng, I believe in your ability!”

“Chairman ...” Feng Jing said helplessly,”the spokesperson part is very important in the entire publicity plan. It directly determines the product’s image. I think you should look into it yourself ...”

In fact, this was the only thing that required Xia ruofei’s personal attention in the entire publicity plan. Feng Jing had already delegated the rest of the work to everyone.

Who would have thought that Xia ruofei didn’t even want to do the only job, which was to meet beautiful celebrities?

Xia ruofei touched his chin and said,””CEO Feng, I think ... You can actually be the spokesperson! You also have a lot of fans online now! I think she’s even more famous than that so – called female singer, Dong Xinyu ... At least, I’ve never heard of her name before, but I’ve heard of your name like thunder ...”

Feng Rao was embarrassed and quickly said,””Chairman, this ... I won’t trouble you to talk to Dong Xinyu personally. I ... I’ll handle it myself ...”

After speaking, Feng Jing stood up and left the office.

This Chairman really touched on a sore spot. The strange ideas in his mind were simply driving people crazy.

Feng Jing was already feeling a little uncomfortable with her sudden popularity. If she were to continue being an ambassador, she might as well just be in the entertainment industry and not a professional manager ...

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh out loud. It seemed that this trick was still effective!

Just as Feng Jing was about to walk out of Xia ruofei’s office, Xia ruofei suddenly had an idea. He shouted,””President Feng, wait a moment ...”

“Does the chairman have any other instructions?” Feng Jing turned around helplessly.”Don’t ever mention that I’ll be your spokesperson. There’s no room for discussion!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you’re meeting Dong Xinyu in the capital tomorrow, right?” I’ll go with you ...”

Xia ruofei suddenly remembered that Tang Yitian’s family was also in the capital at this time. Tang Yitian should be done with his work tomorrow. If he went to the capital, he could meet them. If there was no need, they wouldn’t have to fly to the three mountains.

As for discussing the contract with Feng Jing, it was just a side trip.

Feng Rao looked at Xia ruofei hesitantly. She did not know what Xia ruofei was up to. Why did he change his mind so quickly after all the excuses he had just made?

“Chairman, you’re not joking with me?” Feng Rao asked suspiciously.

“When have I ever joked about work?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

Feng Jing cursed in her heart, you were just joking around with me about the endorsement a minute ago ...

She could not help but ask,”no additional conditions?” Don’t tell me you want me to be your spokesperson?”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”if you agree, I have no problem with it.” The endorsement fee will be excellent ...”

“Don ‘t! Don’ t! I don’t want to!” Feng Jing asked,”Chairman, you really don’t have any other requests?”

Xia ruofei forced a smile and said,”why don’t you believe me?” Weren’t you the one who insisted that I go with you? I’ve already agreed to it, why are you asking so many questions? Do you want me to go or not? Before I change my mind, you better make your decision quickly!”

“I want it!” Feng Jing hurriedly said,”it’s settled then. I’ll get the administrative office to book the plane tickets immediately!”

She had decided that no matter what Xia ruofei had up his sleeve, she would agree to it first. Anyway, if she were to be the spokesperson, she would rather die than do it ...

Feng Jing quickly left Xia ruofei’s office as she was afraid that Xia ruofei would ask for more.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh out loud as he looked at Feng Rao’s sorry figure.

He took out his phone and sent a text message to Tang Yitian, telling him that he was going to the capital for a business trip tomorrow, and that they could meet directly in the capital.

Xia ruofei was worried that Tang Yitian was at the entrepreneur Summit and it would be inconvenient for him to answer the phone, so he sent him a text message to inform him.

She didn’t expect Tang Yitian to call back so quickly.

“Brother! Why did you suddenly decide to come to the capital?”

“Big brother Tang,” Xia ruofei said with a smile,”there’s something I need to do in the company. I need to go there personally.”

Tang Yitian was worried that Xia ruofei would make a trip to the capital for their family. Xia ruofei was a God – like figure! Moreover, he was Haoran’s master. If he had to trouble him to make a trip personally, he would definitely feel a little apologetic and even feel a little scared.

After hearing that Xia ruofei had other matters to attend to in the capital, Tang Yitian was relieved. He said happily,””Then I’ll tell Haoran the good news. He’ll be very happy!”

“Ruofei, when will you arrive in the capital tomorrow?” Tang Yitian asked. We’ll treat you to a meal as a family of three!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”the schedule hasn’t been confirmed yet.” Big brother Tang, I’ll be busy with work after I get to Beijing. I’ll contact you again after I’m done!”

“OK! Then I’ll see you in the capital!” Tang Yitian said straightforwardly.

......

The next morning, Xia ruofei and Feng Jing took a flight at around 9:30 am and arrived at the Capital International Airport at noon.

The administrative office had already booked a hotel in advance.

Now that the company’s various businesses were making a lot of profits and had abundant cash flow, the company management’s accommodation standards and travel subsidies for business trips were very high. This was also decided by Xia ruofei himself.

If he could make money, he should be able to spend it. Only by doing a good job in employee welfare would everyone have a sense of ownership and work hard for the company.

Furthermore, Xia ruofei was also on a business trip this time, so the administrative office had booked a Business Suite at the five – Star Hilton Hotel for the two of them.

The Hilton Hotel provided pick – up service. When the two of them dragged their suitcases out of the airport, they saw a Mercedes – Benz with the hotel LOGO on it. A driver in a suit and white gloves was standing next to the car, holding a sign with their names on it.

Taking the Mercedes – Benz provided by the hotel, the two arrived at the Hilton Hotel in Wangfujing and successfully checked in.

After Feng Jing put her simple luggage away, she went to Xia ruofei’s room.

“Chairman, I’ll contact Dong Xinyu’s manager first to confirm the location for the meeting tonight.” Feng ke said.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

Feng Rao quickly found a number on her phone and dialed it.

“Hello, Sister Fang, I’m Feng Jing from paradise Corporation! We’ve contacted each other before ... It’s like this, our company’s Chairman Xia and I have already arrived in the capital. We want to confirm the time and place of the meeting tonight ... What? This ... But we’ve already agreed on this ... I’m sorry, sister Fang, I didn’t mean it that way ... I know, I know...Then when will miss Dong be free ... Okay! We’ll keep in touch then ...”

After the call, Feng Jing looked a little embarrassed and her brows furrowed slightly.

Xia ruofei, who was standing at the side, heard everything. He asked calmly,””Boss Feng, what’s the situation? Did they stand us up?”

“Dong Xinyu’s manager said that she has to film an important show tonight, so the meeting has been canceled!” Feng Jing said with a sigh. I asked her when she would be free to meet up again, but her attitude was very cold ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but pout.””Do these celebrities have any professional ethics? Didn’t we already agree on this?”

Feng Rao was a little embarrassed. “I’m sorry, Chairman. I didn’t expect him to suddenly break the appointment. I even made you follow me to Beijing, but you couldn’t even see him ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”It’s nothing. However, if you can’t decide on a spokesperson, I’m afraid that the publicity plans you’ve made before will not be able to be carried out, right?” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m
