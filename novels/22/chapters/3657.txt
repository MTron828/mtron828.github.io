Xia ruofei felt that the two of them had been away from home for a long time. Even if the family would not be too worried about their safety, they would still miss them. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Hence, under Xia ruofei’s suggestion, the two of them returned to the three mountains of Huaxia to spend a few days with their family.

Of course, the treatment they received was not something Zheng Yongshou could compare to. This time, Xia ruofei had personally escorted them back on the black Phoenix flying boat.

Xia ruofei also stayed at the three mountains to rest for a few days. Then, he brought Song Wei and Ling Qingxue back to Paradise Island.

In the days he spent on the Peach Blossom Island, besides cultivating the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” with his two female friends and the “great way of Dao” by himself, Xia ruofei would also take some time every day to familiarize himself with the drawing of the runes in the control core of the spiritual puppet.

His proficiency in inscribing was getting higher and higher, and his success rate in inscribing array runes was also much higher than before.

Therefore, during this period of time, the number of spiritual vultures in the spirit map space had increased by more than a dozen. Now, the group of spiritual vultures under Xia Qing’s management had grown to twenty people.

When it came to carrying out simple missions, these spirit puppets were much better than those in the mountain and sea realm who did it for free.

Furthermore, they could also do it without rest or sleep, so the pressure on Xia Qing had also been reduced by a lot.

In the next few days, Xia ruofei was more relaxed. He would perform acupuncture on Liang Qichao once a day. Liang Qichao’s recovery speed was much faster because of this. His rehabilitation training was also very smooth. He could basically walk slowly on the ground, but he could not do any intense exercises yet.

Xia ruofei had spent most of his time in Paradise Farm these few days. Other than treating Liang Qichao with acupuncture, he would also take some time to cultivate. He also liked to fish by the man – made Lake and enjoy the rare peace.

During this time, he went to Sydney once because Tang Yitian had gathered all the new people to the foundation in the manor. Xia ruofei had “interviewed” them one by one and went through them again.

After Xia ruofei’s screening, 23 of the 30 people met the requirements. They were extremely loyal to Tang Yitian and had a strong ability to resist temptation. They could definitely be added to the foundation.

Out of the remaining seven, five were eliminated by Xia ruofei due to their own quality.

After all, the foundation had very high requirements for reliability. Although these five people could not work in the foundation, they could still continue to work for Tang Yitian’s company, but they would not be entrusted with important tasks in the future.

The remaining two were completely commercial spies.

One of them was even Tang Yitian’s most trusted old subordinate.

In fact, the passing rate was already very high, but Tang Yitian still suffered a blow. His confidence was severely damaged, and everyone looked like a commercial spy to him. He even wanted Xia ruofei to help him screen all the staff around him.

Of course, this wasn’t realistic. Tang Yitian had so many properties under his name, and his business was so big that he had tens of thousands of employees. Moreover, some positions didn’t have access to any secrets, so there was no point in screening all of them.

Besides, Xia ruofei was a cultivator. Tang Yitian couldn’t possibly make such a request.

After Xia ruofei helped Tang Yitian identify this group of people, the trip to Australia came to an end.

He had gotten rid of Grello. In kalini, he had helped Liang Qichao speed up his recovery and also screened new members for the Holy Dragon Foundation. It could be said that the trip had been very successful.

Xia ruofei performed acupuncture on Liang Qichao one last time and left him some ointment. Then, he returned to Sydney and went to Tang Yitian’s Manor to say goodbye to him.

“Big brother Tang, I’ve basically dealt with the matters here, so I should go back now.” Xia ruofei and Tang Yitian said directly.

Tang Yitian had also expected this. He nodded and said,””Mm! Since you want to go back, then go back! I don’t want to delay your cultivation.”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”If you need my help with anything, including but not limited to the foundation, you can contact me. If I can’t get in touch with you, you can ask elder Zheng to pass the message. Didn’t he leave his satellite phone number?” You can contact him at any time.”

Tang Yitian nodded and said,”yeah, if 1 really need to trouble you, I won’t be polite.” Ruofei, Haoran will be out of school soon. Aren’t you going to wait for him?”

Xia ruofei smiled and shook his head.’Tve already told him everything. I won’t be saying goodbye to him this time. 1 don’t want to make him sad.” When he comes back, tell him what I’ve told him and make him remember it! I won’t let him worry about other things. Haoran is a good kid.”

During Xia ruofei’s trip to Australia, he would guide Tang Haoran in his cultivation whenever he was free. At the same time, he would also give him a lot of advice.

Most importantly, she hoped that he could maintain a pure heart. She also emphasized that he should not rush for success in his cultivation, especially since he was very close to a breakthrough this time. He should not be too hasty. He must advance step by step and advance steadily.

As long as Tang Haoran kept Xia ruofei’s words in mind and put them into action, with his talent and physique, he would be able to cultivate the “fierce yang Scripture” at a rapid pace. Xia ruofei would not have to worry too much. “Alright!” Tang Yitian nodded. Since you’ve decided, I won’t force you. I’ll pass on your words!”

“Alright, big brother Tang, I’ll be leaving now! I’ll come back to see you guys when I have the chance!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Tang Yitian personally sent Xia ruofei to the back garden of the manor. He watched as Xia ruofei directly jumped into the air. He couldn’t see the black – armored flying ship that had been enchanted with a concealment array, but he knew of its existence. After all, he had experienced it once.

Xia ruofei stood on the deck of the black Phoenix flying ship and waved at Tang Yitian below. Then, with a slight thought, he steered the Flying Ship, leaving a stream of light and disappearing into the horizon.

Xia ruofei controlled the black Phoenix flying ship and flew in the direction of Peach Blossom Island.

After returning to the Peach Blossom Island, Xia ruofei started to cultivate in silence.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue were also working very hard to help Li Yifu break through to the Golden core stage. Tang Haoran would also reach refined Qi level 9 very soon. This was obviously a great stimulation for the two of them.

In the following period of time, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue spent almost every day in their rooms in the Yanhuang building, training hard. It could be said that they did not leave the house at all.

If it was not for Xia ruofei’s reminder, they might have continued to cultivate like this.

Xia ruofei felt that the two of them had been away from home for a long time. Even if the family would not be too worried about their safety, they would still miss them.

Their motivation was much stronger, and they could also go without sleep and rest, so Xia Qing’s pressure was reduced a lot..
