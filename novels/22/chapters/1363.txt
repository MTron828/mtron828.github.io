Chapter 1364: Discussing the big plan together (2)

Translator: 549690339

“Secondly, after we’ve won the land, we can mortgage it to the bank. As long as the bank cooperates, we can loan a large sum of money. It’s even entirely possible that it won’t be lower than the price of the land. This money can be used for the early stage of construction funds.

“Third, as long as we get the land and start construction, we’ll be able to get the pre – Sale membership card. I think the annual fee is about 200000 Yuan. With our names, there should be a lot of people who want to buy it, right? When the time comes, we’ll have to set up some barriers. Not just any Tom, Dick, or Harry can become our members!

Then, I’ll control it according to the initial scale of 500 people. This will bring us another 100 million in cash flow ...”

Hou Liang and the others weren’t too clear about the ways of business, but when they heard Zhao Yongjun’s analysis, they couldn’t help but be flabbergasted.

Song Rui said,”so ... So ... We don’t need to invest much money at all. We can still open the club and make a lot of money?” Isn’t this too easy?”

Xia ruofei could not help but smile bitterly. This method was easy to say, but it was not that easy to achieve. Whether it was the land acquisition, the loan, or the pre – Sale membership card, which one was easy?

Other than Zhao Yongjun and the second and third generation, who else could play such a game?

Zhao Yongjun laughed and said,”hehe, what do you think?” Otherwise, how could old Chen’s second son afford to open such a Big 4S store? How much money could he have? When people get their cars from the car manufacturer, they usually only settle the payment after they sell them, and the payment period is very long. Besides, the store lease, bank loan, and so on ... Anyway, it’s all a matter of operation!”

The Chen family in Beijing was slightly inferior to the song family, but they were also a very big family. The second son of the Chen family that Zhao Yongjun mentioned was about the same age as them. He opened a Big 4S shop in Beijing, and his business was doing very well.

But then Zhao Yongjun changed the topic and said seriously,””But we can’t learn from Chen er. That kid is too greedy and unscrupulous. He’s too ugly!”

Xia ruofei nodded.”Brother Zhao is right. If we want to do it, we have to do it fair and square. We can use the resources we have, but we can’t do anything illegal.”

What Xia ruofei meant was that even if he had to go through the back door, he had to do things according to the rules.

For example, the land transfer fee could be paid according to the stipulated maximum time limit, but it could not exceed this time limit and be delayed indefinitely.

It was the same for bank loans. They had to go through the normal procedures of application and approval. The loan amount had to be within the normal range and not too outrageous.

As long as he could do this, he would not be caught by others.

Xia ruofei wanted to do something with song Rui and the others, but he did not want them to become scammers in order to earn money and implicate the elders in their family.

Zhao Yongjun looked at Xia ruofei with admiration and said,””I have the same thoughts as RUO Fei. We don’t think highly of people like Tian Xiaojun, so we can’t do things that we don’t get!”

Zhao Yong Jun paused, then continued,””This is what I’m thinking. We’ll take out 300 million as a start – up capital. I think if we choose a more remote location, it should be enough to buy land! Subsequently, through land mortgage loans, the funds would be used to start construction projects! If there’s a capital gap during the construction process, we’ll increase the capital together. If you don’t want to or can’t take out that much money at the moment, you can also choose to dilute your shares!”

After all, building a club was not the same as developing real estate. The land needed was not so big, and they did not need to buy land for billions of Yuan or billions of Yuan like real estate developers.

Zhao Yongjun’s plan was still relatively safe. Even if they didn’t have such a big background, normal commercial real estate investments would still work this way.

The real estate industry had always had the highest debt rate, but it did not affect the real estate developers ‘ability to make a lot of money.

“I think so!” Xia ruofei nodded.

After splitting the 300 million, even if he contributed a little more, it would only be a few tens of millions more. It was not difficult for Xia ruofei at all.

“I agree with brother Jun’s suggestion, but I don’t have much money to use. It’s fine if I invest less, right?” Hou Liang said.

“I’m in the same situation as Liang bro,” Wei Jun quickly said.”Guys, shoot a little more, we’ll play with you guys!”

“No problem!” Zhao Yongjun replied readily. Don’t force yourself according to your own abilities!”

Xia ruofei looked at Wei Jun and Hou Liang and said,””Let’s discuss how to distribute the investment ratio first!”

Zhao Yongjun and Xia ruofei looked at each other and smiled.””I’ll talk to RUO Fei one last time! Let’s talk about how much we can invest first, and we’ll pay for the insufficient part! Ruofei, how is it?”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

In terms of economic strength, Xia ruofei and Zhao Yongjun were definitely the strongest, so no one had any objections to this suggestion.

Song Rui discussed with the others in a low voice and then said,””I’ll take an average! I can still come up with 50 million. ”

After song Rui expressed his opinion, Liu Jian immediately said,””Then I’ll also invest 50 million!”

The song family owned a huge family business. Song Rui and the other direct descendants usually had a lot of savings. In addition, song Zhilan, who was in charge of the song family’s business empire, doted on song Rui very much. She would definitely support him in this serious investment business. 50 million Yuan was not a big problem for him.

Liu Jian’s situation was similar to song Rui ‘s. His family had their own company Group. Compared to Hou Liang and the others, they were considered to be relatively wealthy.

Xu Zi Xuan smiled and said: “I’m not as rich as you guys. The few of us came out together to do something. The most important thing is to participate. I’ll invest ten million!”

Zhao Yongjun smiled and nodded, then turned his gaze to Hou Liang and Wei Jun.

The two of them laughed in embarrassment. In the end, Hou Liang said,”Wei Jun and I can each come up with about 5 million, isn’t that too little?”

“Sure!” Zhao Yongjun replied readily. What Zixuan said just now was very right, brothers do things together for fun, money doesn’t matter, as long as you don’t think the future dividends will be too little!”

“No, no,” Wei Jun quickly said.”We won ‘T. Liang bro and I are already very happy to be able to participate in this project!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

With Hou Liang’s family background, there was already a gap between him and Zhao Yongjun and the others. Wei Jun was even worse off than Hou Liang. It was already a surprise that Zhao Yongjun and the others were able to bring them along for this club. They were even worried that Zhao Yongjun would not like it if they invested too little! How could he not have enough shares?

Zhao Yong Jun smiled and nodded,”Then let me calculate! If the five of you can come up with 120 million, then there’s still a gap of 180 million left ...”

“Brother Zhao,” Xia ruofei said,”liangzi and Wei Jun’s 5 million is indeed too little. It’s less than 2% of the shares ...”

When Xia ruofei said this, Hou Liang and Wei Jun couldn’t help but feel nervous. If Xia ruofei wanted to kick them out and not bring them along, Zhao Yongjun would definitely respect his decision.

However, what Xia ruofei said next gave them a pleasant surprise.

Xia ruofei continued,”how about this?” Each of them should invest 10 million! I’ll pay for the rest. Consider it as me lending them five million each ...”

Hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Hou Liang quickly said,””This won’t do! Brother Xia, how can we take your money?”

“What do you mean you took my money? I’m the one who lent it to you, and it’s for the interest!” Xia ruofei deliberately put on a straight face and said,”what? You don’t want to give me face?”

“No, no...” Hou Liang quickly replied.

Xia ruofei’s expression softened a little.”Liangzi, don’t feel any pressure. I’m just thinking that you have too few shares, and I’ll have to rely on you guys to manage the club. That’s not very good. I have more than enough money here, so I’ll just lend you some money for a while. That’s normal, right?”
