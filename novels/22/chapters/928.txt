Before he left for Australia, Xia ruofei had already managed to draw the unlocking rune. However, he was not familiar with it and it did not seem to be working smoothly. He judged that there were some minor flaws and did not rush to unlock the human – shaped jade talisman.

In the past few days, he had taken the soup of the pregnant spirit and used his mental strength to control it in his body many times. He had almost overexerted himself several times. After recovering these days, he felt that his mental strength seemed to have improved.

Hence, Xia ruofei wanted to use tonight’s time to practice a few more times to see if he could draw a more perfect unlocking rune.

Of course, there was a more critical reason. After his body absorbed the huge amount of innate pure Yang Qi in little Haoran’s body, although this pure Yang Qi was temporarily stored in his dantian and controlled by the simple magic art that Xia Qing taught him, it was still not stable enough.

These days, Xia ruofei could faintly feel that the ball of innate pure Yang Qi in his dantian had been stirring.

It was definitely not a good idea to keep suppressing them like this. The best solution was naturally to completely absorb them and make them his own.

According to Xia Qing, as long as Xia ruofei unlocked the first three levels of the great Dao Arts and obtained the cultivation technique of the great Dao Arts, he would be able to absorb the innate pure Yang Qi.

Hence, Xia ruofei, who had not been very concerned about cultivation, felt a sense of urgency.

Xia ruofei sat cross – legged on a Jade futon, guarding his bier. After a while, he pointed his finger and his spiritual power came out of his body. He began to draw runes in the air.

Xia ruofei was already very familiar with the first part of the rune and could complete it in one go. However, when he reached the second part, the runes became more and more complicated. It required more and more delicate control of his spiritual power. Naturally, Xia ruofei’s speed slowed down.

However, it was still relatively smooth overall. Xia ruofei could clearly feel that his control of his spiritual energy had improved.

After a short while, a beautiful and complicated rune appeared in front of Xia ruofei.

He opened his eyes and took a look. Then, he waved his hand and dispersed the runes.

The entire rune construction process was completed by Xia ruofei’s spiritual power. He did not need to check to know that it was a success. However, it was still not smooth enough, so he did not hesitate to disband the rune.

Of course, Xia ruofei could still clearly feel his improvement.

With a trace of joy, he rested for a while and continued to practice.

Before he knew it, Xia ruofei had been practicing for more than three hours.

He only stopped when he felt that his spiritual power had almost been exhausted.

Xia ruofei’s face revealed a trace of joy.

The improvement was obvious. He was getting more and more familiar with the rune, and there was an improvement with every rune he drew.

Xia ruofei could feel that the runes he had constructed were becoming more natural and harmonious. There was a feeling that they were almost natural.

Moreover, the construction speed had also increased significantly.

It could be said that today’s practice had the best effect.

Of course, this was also related to the sense of urgency in Xia ruofei’s heart.

Even though a calm and natural attitude was beneficial for cultivation, if there was an appropriate amount of pressure, it could often be turned into motivation.

Xia ruofei felt that if he continued to practice at this speed, he would be able to unlock the human – shaped jade talisman in a few days.

As for further practice, to be able to carve the rune into the Jade, he would need more time to practice.

Xia ruofei drank a cup of spiritual pond water before sitting on a Jade futon. After his mental energy had recovered a little, he stood up and returned to the Archean realm with a thought.

Due to the difference in the flow of time, Xia Qing, who was in the Archean realm, had already completed the treatment of the grape cutting and the Phoebe zhennan wood.

After seeing Xia ruofei, Xia Qing immediately greeted him with respect. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Xia ruofei smiled.”Xia Qing, I’ve learned a lot from practicing the construction of runes today. I should be able to unlock the human – shaped jade talisman in two or three days!”

“Congratulations, master!” Xia Qing happily said. The ‘great Dao Arts’ is a very magical cultivation technique, and it’s all – encompassing. After master unlocks the human jade talisman, your strength will definitely have a qualitative leap!”

“All – encompassing?” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”isn’t this just a cultivation technique?”

Xia Qing forced a smile.”Master, I can only reveal this much. In any case, you’ll understand after you open the seal on the human – shaped jade talisman in two days.”

Xia ruofei said helplessly,”Okay, okay, I know you can’t say anything, right?” Don’t worry, I won’t force you!”

Then, Xia ruofei continued,”I will give little Haoran one last treatment in a few days. I will absorb all the pure Yang Qi in his body. It would be best if I can start cultivating the great Dao formula before that. Otherwise, if the pure Yang Qi in my body continues to increase, I will not be able to suppress it.”

Of course, Xia ruofei could still choose to expel the innate pure Yang Qi out of his body. After all, he was different from Tang Haoran. The simple technique that Xia Qing taught him could completely direct the innate pure Yang Qi out of his body through a few acupuncture points.

However, this would be a waste.

“You’ll definitely succeed, master!”Xia Qing nodded.

After saying that, Xia Qing pondered for a moment and said,””Master, regarding the treatment of that child, I have a suggestion ...”

“Oh? You tell me!” Xia ruofei said with great interest.

In terms of cultivation, Xia Qing was undoubtedly at the level of an expert professor and a primary school student compared to Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei still attached great importance to his advice.

“Master, I suggest that you leave a small amount of innate pure Yang Qi for that child ...” Xia Qing said with a serious expression.

“What?” Xia ruofei was shocked.”Didn’t you say that the innate pure Yang Qi was the main cause of little Haoran’s strange illness?”

Xia Qing nodded and said,”in fact, the innate pure Yang Qi has a very strong nourishing effect on the human body. It’s just that it’s not enough.” Furthermore, this child was born with so much innate pure Yang Qi in his body, it’s definitely a one in a million physique. Leaving him a trace of innate pure Yang Qi is also leaving him an opportunity. ”

Xia Qing paused for a moment before she continued,””Master, if a person with such a special physique were to cultivate, he would definitely be a genius. If he were to absorb all the innate pure Yang Qi, although the hidden dangers in his body would be completely gone and his physique would even be slightly stronger than an ordinary person, his cultivation talent would also be reduced by a lot.”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei revealed a thoughtful expression and asked,””You mean to say ...”

Xia Qing said without hesitation,”if possible, I suggest that master take him as a disciple. You don’t have to teach him the” great Dao Arts.”After you unseal him, many cultivation techniques in my mind will be open to you. At that time, you will definitely be able to find a cultivation technique that is suitable for his physique.”

“Taking in a disciple ...” Although Xia ruofei had guessed Xia Qing’s intention, he still felt a little hesitant.

After all, he was only a young man in his twenties. He had been serving in the Army all this time and had received an atheist and materialistic education.

Although the existence of the spirit map space had gradually allowed Xia ruofei to accept those legends that he used to think were impossible, he still felt that there was something wrong with the words ‘sect’ and ‘disciple’.

“Master, it’s very hard to meet such a genius.” Xia Qing tried to persuade him from the side,”although I have never seen that child before, his physique has determined that once he steps onto the path of cultivation, he will definitely be able to advance by leaps and bounds.”

Xia ruofei pondered for a long time and finally said reluctantly,””I’ll try! Little Haoran is still so young, and his parents are both from prominent families. It’s not even certain if they’re willing to let me take their child as my disciple!”

“To be able to become master’s direct disciple and have the chance to obtain a great inheritance, what’s there to be unwilling about?” Xia Qing felt it was a bit unbelievable,”what is the wealth of the secular world compared to this?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”You don’t understand ... The outside world is completely different now. At least, I haven’t met any cultivators yet ... Anyway, I know about this. When I treat little Haoran in a few days, I’ll ask Tang Yitian about it.”

“Yes, master,” Xia Qing said with her head down.

As usual, Xia ruofei checked the situation of the crops in the space. Then, he instructed Xia Qing to take care of the Semillon grapes carefully and continue to cut to expand the planting area of the Dendrobium candids. After that, he left the space and returned to the outside world.

……

The next day, Liang Qichao set off from Paradise Farm with Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao. Xia ruofei’s driving license was from the military, so he didn’t have an international driver’s license. He could still drive around Hunter Valley, but he couldn’t drive for a distance of one to two hundred kilometers. It would be troublesome if he were to be checked by the police.

So, after Liang Qichao had arranged the work on the farm, he personally became their driver and tour guide.

After the car set off from Paradise Farm, Lin Qiao still clung to Xia ruofei and insisted on sitting in the back seat with him.

After spending a few days in the Hunter Valley, Lin Qiao was looking forward to the trip to Sydney today. She said,””Brother Liang, where are we going first? The Opera House or the harbor Bridge? When can we take the yacht?”

“I’m just your driver,”Liang Qichao said with a smile,”I’ll listen to your brother!” We’ll go wherever the boss says!”

Xia ruofei rolled his eyes and asked,”what if I ask you to jump into the sea?”

“Then I definitely won’t dance! “I’m not stupid ...”Liang Qichao said without thinking.

Seeing the two bickering, Lin Qiao couldn’t help but smile.

At that moment, Liang Qichao’s phone on the control console vibrated. He pressed the answer button on his Bluetooth headset and said,”“hello!”

With one hand on the steering wheel and the other on the Bluetooth headset, Liang Qichao had a troubled look on his face. In the end, he said in English,””I know ...”

Xia ruofei waited for him to hang up and asked,””What’s wrong? What’s up with the farm?”
