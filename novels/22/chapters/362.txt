Chapter 363: A duel (1)

Xia Cheng and the others also thought of this problem. Everyone stopped celebrating and started to think.

After a while, Xia Cheng said without much confidence,””Mr. Xia, why don’t we ... Consider this bet a draw! Both of them won the Gold Award, so it’s a happy ending!”

From Xia Cheng’s point of view, Sanshan University’s gardening club had already exceeded their expectations by winning the Gold Award. There was no need for them to compete with Agricultural University.

Of course, the most important thing was that he had no confidence at all.

Yang suhe from Agricultural University had such a high chance of winning the championship, and this was her home ground. If they had to fight for first or second place, then their jade lion Mo Lan would most likely lose.

If that was the case, then the value of the tied gold medals would be greatly reduced. Agricultural University would always be the first and Sanshan University the second.

Taking such a big risk for a bet, wasn’t it not worth it?

Xia Cheng and most of the students from the Garden Club had the same thought, but someone else didn ‘t.

The moment Xia Cheng finished his sentence, someone immediately said in unison,””No!”

Xia ruofei and Lu You spoke. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Xia ruofei looked at Lu You in surprise. He did not agree to a draw because of the black stone in Chen song’s hand. He did not understand why Lu You was so strongly against it.

If she lost this bet, Lu You would lose a pot of orchid that was at the level of a gold medal at the Expo!

“Youyou ...” Jiang Yue gently tugged on Lu You’s sleeve.

“Lu You,” Xia ruofei said,”everyone thinks that it’s good to be happy. Why are you against it?”

“There’s no reason. I just don’t like that Chen Song!” Lu You said indifferently,”that arrogant look is asking for a beating! Besides, the bet has already been made, what’s the point of a draw?”

Xia ruofei grinned and said,””Great minds think alike!”

Lu You said in her heart,’slightly the same ghost! If I didn’t see your eyes light up after seeing the stone in Chen song’s hand, I wouldn’t even care about this stupid bet!

Of course, Lu You would not say this out loud.

Xia Cheng furrowed his brows.”Since Lu You has decided to bet to the end, we can’t really object to it. But, both of us will win the gold Prize. How are we going to decide who’s better?”

“Isn’t that simple?” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”our previous agreement was that if both parties received the same award, the judges would decide the specific ranking. Of course, this kind of thing should be left to the judges.”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Let’s go! Let’s go and meet the people from Agricultural University. ”

Xia ruofei took the lead, and the students of the gardening club of Sanshan University surrounded him as they walked towards the area where the teachers and students of Agricultural University were.

When Chen Song saw Xia ruofei walking over, his face darkened and he snorted coldly.

Meng Zhou also frowned slightly. He took two steps forward and said,”Xia Cheng, congratulations!”

Although he was a little unhappy that Sanshan University had won their Gold Award, as the president of Agricultural University’s gardening club, Meng Zhou still had some basic manners.

Xia Cheng smiled and said,”thank you! Congratulations to you guys too!” You’ve already won the gold and silver Awards. ”

“It’s a pity that we didn’t achieve the expected results. ” Meng Zhou said indifferently.

It was obvious that they were not planning to share the Gold Award with others.

“Xia Cheng, what’s the matter?” Meng Zhou continued to ask.

“Mr. Xia, the consultant of our gardening club,” Xia Cheng said indifferently,”he had a bet with your club’s Chen Song. You should have heard about it, right?”

Meng Zhou raised his eyebrows and glanced at Xia ruofei indifferently.”Chen Song told me that the Gold Award has been decided. How are you guys going to handle it?”

Xia Cheng turned around to look at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei smiled.”The bet has been made. It’s only natural that we decide who’s the winner. Both pots of flowers are gold prizes. I think you guys want to know who’s first and who’s second, right?”

Meng Zhou smiled noncommittally and said,””Then how do you want to decide the winner?”

“Student Chen Song said that if both parties win the same award, the judges will have to work a little harder to decide which flower is better.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I think this is a good idea.”

“The judges discussed for more than two hours and even came up with a tie for the gold medal. This means that it’s hard for them to distinguish between the two.” Meng Zhou squinted his eyes and said.

“Do you have a better idea, Meng Zhou?” Xia ruofei asked indifferently.

Meng Zhou smiled and said,”I have a suggestion. Since the judging panel can’t decide which pot of flowers is higher, why don’t we let the audience choose? we can put the two pots of flowers together and ask all the audience who visited the exhibition to vote. At the end of the exhibition, the pot that gets the most votes will be the well – deserved first place. No one can say anything about that, right?”

Chen song’s eyes lit up when he heard that. He said,””President Meng, this is a good idea! Fair and just!”

The students of Agricultural University also agreed.

Lu You laughed coldly and said,””You guys are really good at planning! “This is your Agricultural University, and most of the audience are teachers and students from the University. Is there any fairness in letting the audience vote? Why don’t we just count it as your victory!”

Meng Zhou put on a fake smile and said,”student, the public’s eyes are clear. You have to believe in the awareness of the teachers and students of Agricultural University!” If your pot of jade lion is really good, I believe that most of the teachers and students will not go against their conscience and vote for our pot of yang Lotus. ”
