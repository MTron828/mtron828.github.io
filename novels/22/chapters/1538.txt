The people around him cheered or sighed from time to time. Xia ruofei looked at Yu mingdong beside him and realized that he was also extremely nervous. He held the little notebook tightly in his hand and stared at the big screen without blinking.

Soon, the results of Xia ruofei’s bidding for the two raw stones with the smallest numbers were out.

Without a doubt, Xia ruofei had made the right choice. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

He had already memorized the number of the raw stone and the bidding list in his heart. He didn’t need to look at his little notebook from time to time like Yu mingdong and the others.

Someone had already walked to the service desk, showed the second couplet of the bidding slip, and started to swipe his card for the transaction.

In the area where the raw stones were placed, the staff began to get busy. They shuttled back and forth, picking up a piece of raw stone from time to time and returning it to the service desk.

A few small forklifts were also moving around the area to pick up the larger raw stones and move them to the service desk.

Xia ruofei was not in a hurry. He decided to wait until all eight of his raw stones were opened before settling the bill.

The largest raw stone was numbered 1896. It was also the largest one among the eight raw gemstones.

It would take a long time to drive out more than 1000.

At this moment, Xia ruofei realized that Yu mingdong, who was beside him, had clenched his fist tightly. His face revealed a trace of joy.

“President Yu, you bought it?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“Mm! Old he is very optimistic about this raw stone. I’m 10% higher than the normal valuation, and I’ve finally won it!” Yu mingdong said happily,”I’ve already missed two raw stones in front ...”

“Congratulations!” Xia ruofei said.

“I hope it’ll be a good result after it’s opened ...” Yu mingdong laughed.

“Mr. Yu, which one is it?” Xia ruofei asked casually.

Yu mingdong smiled and said,”number 633!” This raw stone was not small! Its appearance and performance are also very good!”

Xia ruofei remembered immediately. He had some impression of raw stone No. 633. It was about the same size as raw stone No. 1896 that he had chosen at the end.

At that time, the spirit map scroll also reacted to raw stone No. 633, but it was much less than the reaction of raw stone No. 1896. It was almost the same as the reaction of the basin – sized raw stone he had previously chosen.

The price – Performance ratio was too low, so Xia ruofei quickly excluded number 633.

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei could not help but look at the big screen. At this time, the information on the screen just happened to scroll to the screen of raw stone No. 633. He looked at the bid price -21.35 million!

Xia ruofei’s face twitched. It was so high!

He was sure that the value of the Jade contained in this raw stone was definitely not comparable to that of the raw stone No. 1896 that he was about to buy with 8.6 million Yuan. At best, it was about the same value as the other small raw stone that he was going to buy.

Xia ruofei had only spent 350000 Yuan on the basin – sized raw stone, which was a fraction of the price of raw stone No. 633.

Although Xia ruofei didn’t know much about Jade, he could still make a good judgment.

He looked at the happy Yu mingdong and said in his heart,”This guy might be screwed today ...

However, he couldn’t say it out loud. He didn’t know how to help Yu mingdong recover his losses, so he could only wish him good luck.

Soon, Xia ruofei turned his attention back to the big screen.

In a short while, the bidding results for the raw stones that Xia ruofei had chosen were out one by one.

Number 708, won the bid!

Number 836, won the bid!

Number 992, won the bid!

......

After waiting for more than half an hour, the bid for No. 1896 finally appeared.

“Winning bid: 8.6 million HxB!”

Xia ruofei secretly heaved a sigh of relief. He had won all eight raw stones with less than 12 million Yuan!

To Xia ruofei, the results were clear.

He took out a small stack of second couplets of bidding slips from his pocket and walked towards the service desk that had already begun to get busy.

Yu mingdong, who was beside Xia ruofei, saw this and quickly asked,””Mr. Xia, where are you going?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”I was lucky. I bought a few pieces. I’m going to pay for the goods!”

Yu mingdong was stunned for a moment and felt a little surprised. He quickly smiled and said,””Let’s go together! I still have a few pieces with lower serial numbers, so I can’t get them out so quickly!”
