Chapter 533: The treatment of the rich (1)

“RUO Fei, you’re good!” Liang Qichao leaned against the Mercedes – Benz, a cigarette in his hand, and said with a smile,”I was wondering why you weren’t interested in Australian girls! You have better ones!”

Xia ruofei’s expression didn’t change as he said,”what are you saying?” Why can’t I understand a single word?”

Liang Qichao gave him the middle finger in disdain and said,””Acting! Why are you acting dumb in front of your brother! Even though I’m quite close to sister Qingxue, even though I once ...”

“What?” Xia ruofei’s eyes widened.

Liang Qichao quickly replied,”yes!” The little beauty of the past, do you understand? After you got together with Qingxue, I’ve never had any other thoughts! Besides, I’ve already been sent to a place thousands of miles away, how would I dare to have any thoughts?”

“So You Think they’re being banished?” Xia ruofei said with a half – Smile,”then I’ll talk to Mr. Tang and ask him to transfer you back to United States?”

“Don ‘t, don’ t, don’t ... You’re my brother, okay?” Liang Qichao quickly smiled apologetically.”I think it’s pretty good on the farm. It’s really pretty good ...”

The Hunter Valley had beautiful scenery and a pleasant climate. Furthermore, Liang Qichao was the leader here and had the final say. In addition, he was full of confidence in Xia ruofei’s paradise vegetables and firmly believed that they could produce an eye – catching report card here. So, unless he was out of his mind, he would not be willing to transfer back to United States to compete with Liang Xiaojun!

Xia ruofei then said,”that’s more like it!” Brother Liang, don’t worry! At that time, our Paradise Farm will definitely amaze the world with a single brilliant feat, and your status will naturally rise with the tide!”

“That’s true, that’s true! I have absolute confidence in you! Now we’re just waiting for the seeds in our country!” Liang Qichao said with a smile.

Then, Liang Qichao suddenly came to his senses. He shouted,””AI! That’s not right ... Didn’t we just talk about you? How did you end up talking about me? You’re too cunning, aren’t you?”

Xia ruofei held back his laughter and said,”what’s the matter with me?” I don’t remember! Brother Liang, have you finished your cigarette? If we don’t leave now, we’ll miss the flight ...”

Then, Xia ruofei opened the door to the passenger’s seat and got in. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Liang Qichao stepped on the cigarette butt and threw it into the trash can by the roadside. Then, he sat in the car and fastened his seat belt as he said,””Ruofei, you’re too cunning ... Is there any meaning in hiding things from my brother? Even an idiot can tell what’s going on between you and Monica, okay?”

Xia ruofei pretended to be confused and said,”what could have happened to us?” Weren’t they just friends? Didn’t I tell you yesterday? I met him in Shen Cheng city last time!”

Anyway, Liang Qichao did not see him in bed with Monica with his own eyes. Even if it was highly suspicious, Xia ruofei would not admit it personally. He would just let Liang Qichao scratch his ears and cheeks.

Liang Qichao started the car and said,””Ruofei, don’t worry! I’m not the kind of person who would betray his friends, so you don’t have to worry about Qingxue ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and did not say anything. He simply leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes to rest.

Seeing that Xia ruofei didn’t respond, Liang Qichao was helpless. He could only look at Xia ruofei in disdain and drive seriously.

Four days later, Xia ruofei was back at Kingford Smith Airport in Sydney.

Tang He’s private plane was already waiting at the airport. The flight crew had already made preparations for departure. After Xia ruofei passed through the special security check, he waved goodbye to Liang Qichao and walked directly to the tarmac under the guidance of the flight attendant.

Tang He’s private jet was also a Gulfstream G650, the same model as MA Xiong ‘s. In fact, many world – Class rich people preferred Gulfstream business jets.

The plane’s maximum cruising speed reached Mach 0.925, which was higher than the average passenger airliner. At Mach 0.85, the plane’s maximum range could reach 13000 kilometers. It could fly from the East Coast of the United States to the capital of Huaxia without interruption. For the Super – rich, they pursued the best comfort, the shortest flight time, and the highest efficiency.

Therefore, the Gulfstream G650 naturally became the choice of many of them.

The Gulfstream G650 was parked quietly on the private plane’s tarmac. Captain Johnson, the co – Pilot, the air Mechanic, and another flight attendant were waiting for Xia ruofei next to the plane.

“Mr. Xia, it’s an honor to serve you.” Johnson said as he stepped forward.

“You’ve worked hard. ” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”how have you been in Sydney?”

“Very good!” Captain Johnson smiled and said,”the sun, the beach, and the beautiful girls here have left a deep impression on me!”

After sending Tang He back to the United States, Johansson’s flight crew immediately returned to Australia. Then, they waited in Sydney to serve Xia ruofei. In between, they would stay in Sydney for two to three days and naturally, they would tour around.

The fact that Johansson was willing to give up his position as a Captain in a big airline and work for Tang He, a super – rich man, to fly in a business plane showed that the benefits Tang He offered were quite good, even hard to refuse.

In fact, Johansson’s salary was far higher than that of a Captain from an ordinary airline. In addition, in such a situation where they had to wait in a different place, they would also receive a considerable amount of subsidies.

Even the expenses of staying in a five – Star hotel, sightseeing, and so on could be reimbursed.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Mr. Captain, do you want me to go back for a few more days?” I’ll let you enjoy Australia’s sun and beaches. Of course, there are also beautiful women ...”
