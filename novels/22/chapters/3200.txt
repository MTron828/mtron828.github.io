3201 A wonderful journey (2)

The world behind the light screen door also began to become clearer and clearer.

At this moment, everything came to an abrupt end.

Suddenly, the scene in front of Xia ruofei’s eyes flashed rapidly as if he was rewinding at sixteen times the normal speed. In the blink of an eye, he returned to reality.

At this moment, the ending part of the song was played.

Xia ruofei seemed to be in a daze, as if his soul had returned to its place.

Then, he suddenly realized that he had just been listening to a song, and then he had such a fantastic experience.

The scariest thing was that Xia ruofei, who was an Aurous core stage cultivator, was so entranced by the music that he did not even notice it. He even forgot who he was and where he came from. He thought that everything that happened in space was his own experience.

Xia ruofei could still vividly remember what he had just experienced.

Although it was an illusion, Xia ruofei felt that it was not just an illusion.

His attainments in the array Dao were quite good, and he had experienced or personally arranged many illusory arrays. Even if it was an exquisite illusory array, it was difficult to achieve the effect of being in the realm and completely forgetting himself.

Furthermore, when Xia ruofei heard the ending of the song, he suddenly realized that the music he heard from the gourd – shaped pottery and the door of light in the ‘illusion’ seemed to be the song playing on the computer ...

While Xia ruofei was still in a daze, the music ended and the hall returned to silence.

No one made a sound.

After a long while, Xia ruofei was the first to speak.””This is the song we’re looking for!”

Even though there were still a few songs that he had not heard, Xia ruofei had already stated his conclusion with certainty.

Everyone had just recovered from their shock. After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Chen Xuan couldn’t help but look shocked as he said,””That’s right! That’s it!”

Liu Mansha nodded.”This song is indeed different from the previous 18 songs. I can feel that the previous dissonant parts have become very smooth ...” She said.

“That’s true, I feel the same way as Valley master Liu ...”Mu Sheng nodded.

Xia ruofei’s face revealed a strange expression. He looked at Chen Xuan, who had the same strange expression, and could not help but ask,””Did everyone see that miraculous scene just now?”

Chen Xuan, Ling Qingxue, Yu Xin ‘er, and mu Jianfei all nodded in agreement.

However, Song Wei, Mu Sheng, and Liu Mansha were puzzled.

Liu Mansha saw her disciple, Yu xiner, nodding as well. She couldn’t help but ask,”Xiner, what did you just see?”

“Master, you ... You didn’t have that wonderful experience just now?” Yu xiner asked in surprise.

Liu Mansha frowned slightly and shook her head.””I can hear that this song is obviously much more perfect than the previous 18 songs. To be precise, I can’t find any flaws. However, it was just a piece of music. I didn’t have any special experiences ...”

Mu Sheng also stared at mu Jianfei and asked,””Jianfei, what did you just experience? Why don’t I feel anything?”

Song Wei was also confused. She did not have any reaction after listening to the song.

“Father, let brother RUO Fei speak!” Mu Jianfei said.

He was also a little dumbfounded at this moment. He had never thought that his father, who was almost omnipotent in his heart, would actually lose to him in the matter of listening to a song ...

Xia ruofei revealed a thoughtful expression and said,””Seniors, please calm down. Let’s confirm first ...” He said.

Then, Xia ruofei looked at the other people who had also heard the song.

“Brother Chen, brother Jianfei, miss Xin ‘er, and Qingxue, let’s confirm if the scene we all experienced was the same!” Xia ruofei said.

Chen Xuan, Ling Qingxue, and the others naturally nodded in agreement.

Xia ruofei said,”I’ll go first!” After the song started, my consciousness was immersed in it. Then, it felt like a movie was playing in front of my eyes, and I felt like I was flying away from earth ...”

Chen Xuan nodded his head and continued,””I flew in the lonely space for a long time, and then I saw the moon ...”

“I flew directly to the dark side of the moon and crossed many huge craters on the way.” Mu Jianfei added.

“I’m slowing down behind a crater. ” Yu xiner blushed and said,”then, eight lights lit up one after another ...”

“Then, a strange instrument appeared and started to play music ...” Ling Qingxue continued.

Xia ruofei was sure that they had all experienced the same thing.

He nodded and finally said,”then, as the music played, a door of light appeared. You could vaguely see that it was like a Fairyland inside, and similar music echoed from the door of light. Then, this experience ended, and everyone’s consciousness returned to their bodies, right?”

Chen Xuan, Ling Qingxue, mu Jianfei, and Yu Xin ‘er all nodded their heads. It was obvious that the latter part of the story was the same for everyone.

Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha were both stunned. Of course, Song Wei was also in disbelief.

In just a short time, Xia ruofei and the others had experienced such a magical scene. It was obvious that the appearance of this scene was related to the music. When it was about to end, the music was also a kind of response.

Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha knew that this experience was closely related to the secret of the token, and it contained a lot of key information, but they did not react at all.

“There’s one more thing,”Chen Xuan said,” has everyone noticed? Although that experience was like a dream, it’s now imprinted in our minds. Every detail is clear and not a single one is missed. ”

Xia ruofei sensed it and nodded.””Indeed!”

This feeling was similar to the various ancient books and cultivation techniques he had received through the Jade talisman of inheritance. It was completely imprinted in his mind and could not be erased.

Xia ruofei could not help but laugh when he thought about how he had memorized the order of the eight lights. He did not need to deliberately record it because he would never forget it. After listening to the song, the experience was written into his mind.

“What’s going on?” Mu Sheng couldn’t help but ask,”why can’t Valley master Liu, miss song, and I feel any of this? Are we in the wrong position? Do you want to change seats and listen to it again?”

Xia ruofei had already guessed it, but Mu Sheng’s request was not too much, so he had no reason to refuse.

In fact, he was quite looking forward to that experience just now, and he was also wondering if he could experience it again.

And so, Mu Sheng and mu Jianfei exchanged seats. Similarly, Liu Mansha and Yu Xin ‘er, Ling Qingxue and Song Wei also exchanged seats. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Then, Xia ruofei walked into the screening room again and played the song No. 19.

The melodious music reverberated in the theater.

Xia ruofei closed his eyes subconsciously, but the feeling of his consciousness leaving his body and the stars moving did not appear.

...

He opened his eyes and looked at the others, only to find that they were in the same situation as him.

Chen Xuan, Ling Qingxue, mu Jianfei, and Yu xiner had all entered the same mysterious scene as Xia ruofei. However, they did not.

So this was a one – time thing!

Mu Sheng, Liu Mansha, and Song Wei, who had not been able to enter the space and moon scenes before, did not enter the wonderful scenes after changing seats.

Everyone listened to the song until the last note was played, and the studio fell into a long silence.

Everyone was silent.

Especially Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha, they found it hard to accept. Why couldn’t they play the same song as Xia ruofei, Chen Xuan, and the others?

Even their sons and disciples could do it, but they couldn’t do anything at all. Where would they put their old faces?
