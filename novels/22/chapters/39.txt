Chapter 40: Shipment

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Xia Ruofei thought that although the resort villa in the suburbs was very convenient, it was built on the premise that there were cars. If he did not have his own car, taking a taxi would not be a long-term solution.

Moreover, if he were to travel to and fro the city from the villa, he would still have to walk a long way to reach the highway. It would be too inconvenient to take a minibus.

Hence, buying a car had become Xia Ruofei’s top priority.

Fortunately, when Xia Ruofei retired, he had already converted his military license to a local driving license. Now, he only needed to buy a car to drive.

Hence, Xia Ruofei was in no hurry to go to the villa in the suburbs. He planned to settle the matter of the car in the afternoon.

Xia Ruofei did not hesitate much on the choice of model before deciding to buy a pickup.

Although he had nearly 500,000 yuan on hand now and could totally buy a good joint venture car, money had to be spent on the blade. There was still a lot to spend in the future. Besides, Xia Ruofei was not someone who liked to show off. From a practical point of view, a pickup was undoubtedly the most suitable.

Because at this stage, Xia Ruofei would definitely need to transport things often, such as mailing succulent seedlings, buy flower pots, cardboard boxes, vegetable seeds, farm tools, and so on. If he bought a luxury car or SUV, he would not put it to much use.

After making up his mind, Xia Ruofei took a taxi straight to the Huaxia Motor City in the southern suburbs. There were many car shops there.

It did not take long for Xia Ruofei to buy a pickup car that cost about 100,000 yuan. This pickup car was also the most popular model in the country and was very practical.

Xia Ruofei paid the full amount on the spot. The car shop also sent some conventional gifts such as film patches, footpads, and fenders. Xia Ruofei added another 2,000 yuan and asked for the trunk cover for the back of the car.

He also entrusted the car store to handle the license plates and insurance.

This was not a popular car model from a big brand, so there were available cars for collection on the spot. After Xia Ruofei and the other staff of the car store installed the window film and fenders in place, they drove out of the shop.

Although the license plate would take a few days to arrive, with the purchase receipt for the new car, it would not be a problem even if he encountered traffic police on the way.

After leaving the car shop, Xia Ruofei drove to buy some cardboard boxes, transparent tape, foam strips, bubble bags, and other things for packing and mailing. Then, he went to the electronic city to buy a new computer and a printer. He bought a few boxes of printing paper before driving back to his vacation villa in the suburbs with a full truckload.

After returning to the villa, Xia Ruofei first arranged his life matters.

He chose a large room on the second floor facing the sea with a small balcony and its own bathroom as his bedroom.

After carefully locking the door and drawing the curtains, Xia Ruofei took out the Spiritual Map and entered the Spiritual Map Space with the cardboard box and other packed items. Then, he brought his beddings and daily necessities out of the space.

It took a moment to make the bed and place some of the daily necessities in place. Then Xia Ruofei connected the new desktop and printer in his bedroom.

The room’s Internet interfaces were all ready-made, and the landlord had paid for a year’s worth of broadband, so he could go online as soon as he was connected.

Xia Ruofei first went to his Taobao platform to collate all the orders and printed them out in a form. Then, he entered the Spiritual Map Space with the order information. He was prepared to pack the succulent seedlings in the space and send out the delivery as soon as possible—that was a transaction of 110,000 yuan! The sooner the customer received the goods, the sooner he would get the money!

As for why he had chosen to pack it in the space, it was naturally because the ten times faster time flow would save him a lot of time. Now, the most precious thing to Xia Ruofei was undoubtedly time.

After entering the space, Xia Ruofei distributed the goods according to the contents of each order. After gathering the succulent seedlings for an order, he started packing.

Before packing, he would first water them with the spiritual pond water. Then, he would wrap each pot of succulent seedlings in a bubble bag and tie them tightly with tape. After placing all the seedlings into the cardboard box, he would fill the gaps with foam strips. Finally, he would seal the cardboard box tightly with transparent tape and paste the order number on the outside.

It could be said that there was extreme protection, and it could basically avoid damage to the succulent seedlings caused by the violent sorting of packages.

There were more than a hundred pots of succulent seedlings and a total of more than 40 orders. It took Xia Ruofei more than five hours to pack them up—of course, it was only half an hour in the outside world.

Xia Ruofei took a lot of effort to bring all 40 over cardboard boxes out of the Spiritual Map Space. After drinking a few mouthfuls of the pond water to recover his energy, he carried the cardboard boxes into the pickup truck and drove straight to Changping County. It was only a ten-minute drive from here to the county city, which was much closer than returning to the city.

He had checked the map online before setting off, so he quickly found a branch of the parcel forwarder.

Xia Ruofei asked the staff for a stack of delivery slips and began to fill in the delivery slips according to the order information. After filling one slip, he pasted it on the corresponding cardboard box according to the order number. Finally, he weighed and counted the money.

While filling out the delivery form, the store’s television was broadcasting the local news. The county television station announced that Deputy Chief Zheng of the county’s Public Security Bureau was being investigated by the organization. At the same time, Zhong Qiang and his son were also suspected of crimes and were arrested by the local police. They were also on the county television news.

Xia Ruofei could not help but reveal a pleased expression. This was really satisfying!

After venting his anger, Xia Ruofei was in a good mood, and the speed at which he filled in the delivery form was much faster.

Soon he had all the sheets filled and pasted.

A few staff members helped him carry the cardboard boxes in and weigh them. There were more than 40 orders, and the delivery fee alone was more than 500 yuan. He was not a mere customer given that he had sent so many parcels in one go, so the post office staff’s attitude was very good.

After Xia Ruofei paid, the staff member gave him a receipt and said.

“Sir, if you send packages regularly and in large quantities, we can sign an agreement. You can give us a call when the time comes and we’ll go straight to your place to collect them! And there can be a certain discount on the delivery fees.”

“Sure!” Xia Ruofei said without thinking. “I have about 40 to 50 orders every month. There might be more in the future, but I live a little far away. It’s about a ten-minute drive from the county city. Is that okay?”

“That won’t be a problem!” the staff said. “Here’s a sample of the agreement. You can take a look. In your case, we can give you a 20% discount. If the collaboration is long, the cost might be even lower.”

Xia Ruofei took it and browsed through it before nodding.

“No problem. Let’s sign the agreement!”

The staff immediately found a manager. After registering Xia Ruofei’s ID number and address, they quickly typed out an agreement and signed it together.

The manager shook hands with Xia Ruofei and said.

“Mr. Xia, thank you for choosing our delivery company! I hope we can work well together in the future!”

“Happy cooperation!” Xia Ruofei said with a smile.

“By the way, Mr. Xia, you can also bring some delivery slips back,” the manager said. “Our official website has a delivery slip template for download. You just have to fill in the information according to the template on the computer and you can print the delivery slips directly.”

“Really?” Xia Ruofei said happily. “That’s great. Get me a hundred first!”

After filling in more than 40 delivery forms, Xia Ruofei’s hands were sore. If he could print them directly, it would indeed be a lot easier.

A few minutes later, Xia Ruofei left the place with a stack of delivery slips.

He’d just driven the pickup back to the resort house. Before he could get out of the car, the phone on the console rang …
