Chapter 1199: Returning to Austria.2

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei quickly informed Feng Jing and asked her to arrange for the seeds to be sent to Australia.

“No problem!” Liang Qichao said excitedly. I’ve basically planted all of them. The rate of germination is quite high, and from the looks of it, they’re growing very well!”

“That’s good!” Xia ruofei also smiled.”This means that our Paradise Farm will soon start to generate a lot of cash flow ...”

Paradise Farm’s biggest advantage was that it had a large area and sufficient water. As long as there was no problem with sales, the profit was quite amazing. After all, paradise brand sold quality vegetables, and the price was not generally high.

Liang Qichao nodded and said,”vegetables have their own growth cycle. However, the growth rate of Taoyuan vegetables is much faster than ordinary vegetables, so this cycle can be shortened by a lot. I’ve already contacted Maya. We’ve initially Set Black Friday this year, and we’ll distribute the goods to all the supermarkets in the country at the same time!”

Black Friday was a popular “man – made festival” in the West in recent years. It was similar to China’s 11/11. The so – called Black Friday was the second day of Thanksgiving every year. Thanksgiving was the fourth Thursday in November, so Black 5 was the fourth Friday in November every year. On this day, businesses would do a lot of promotions, and it was also a Festival for the hand – chopping gang.

“Alright!” Xia ruofei nodded in agreement.”We can also cooperate with the supermarket and do a Black 5 promotion. However, we have to be careful not to give people the impression that we are common goods.”

“I understand! We’re still discussing the specific plan, and Maya still respects our opinions!” Liang Qichao said with a smile.

“We’ll have another big event on Christmas Day,” Xia ruofei said with a smile.”We’ll make Paradise Farm famous!”

“Great minds think alike!” Liang Qichao laughed.

......

After returning to Paradise Farm, Xia ruofei checked out the peach Garden vegetables that had been planted on this scale under Liang Qichao’s lead.

Even though Xia ruofei had been mentally prepared, he was still shocked when he saw the endless vegetable field.

Liang Qichao was right. The seedlings cultivated from these seeds were very tenacious, and there was no soil in Australia that was not acclimatizing to them. Each one of them was growing very well, and the lush green made people like them.

After returning to the small villa by the artificial lake, Xia ruofei washed up and changed into a set of home clothes. Then, he tried the Australian food that Uncle Bill had prepared.

In the evening, Xia ruofei did not go to the West couple. Instead, he took a walk by the artificial lake in Paradise Farm and went back to his house to rest.

The next day, Xia ruofei drove the farm car to West Winery after breakfast.

He didn’t inform the West couple in advance when he came to Australia this time.

Hence, when the couple saw Xia ruofei, they were both surprised and happy. They hugged the young boss warmly.

“Uncle Carter, how have you been?” Xia ruofei asked in English with a gentle smile on his face.

“Of course, I’m full of energy every day!” Old West said happily.

On the other hand, Auntie Kelly said,””He’s full of a sense of belonging here because you kept the name of West Winery!”

Xia ruofei laughed.”It’s such a good intangible asset. How can I give it up?”

“Uncle Carter, how’s the winery doing?” he asked.

Xia ruofei’s company in China was still expanding rapidly, and the department structure was not complete. For example, the overseas business division had not been established yet. Xia ruofei entrusted Liang Qichao to send professional financial staff to check the accounts regularly, and he rarely asked about it himself.

“Everything is normal!” Old West said,”the turnover is also roughly the same as in previous years!”

The wine – making work in the winery had been completed a long time ago, and this period of time was also a relatively relaxed time of the year.

Of course, this was only relative.

Australia’s tourism industry was developing very well, especially since the Chinese people were becoming richer. Every year, there was an endless stream of people who came to the Hunter Valley to travel. As the Hunter Valley’s special winery, there was an endless number of guests every opening day.

Xia ruofei nodded.”Uncle Carter, the main reason I came to Australia this time is to improve the winery’s grapes. I’m going to replant the grape seedlings I’ve prepared.”

Old West was shocked and said in surprise,””Eradicate them all and replant them?”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””All the products of my company must be the best in the industry, and wine is no exception ... Of course, I’m not saying that the products of West Winery or Golden Oak winery are bad. I just think they can be better ...”

Old West didn’t quite agree with the young boss’s words.

He had been in the business for decades, so he was very confident in the quality of his grapes. As for the Golden Oak winery, although he didn’t want to admit it, the fact was that the Golden Oak winery’s grapes were even better than the West Winery ‘s. They were among the best in the entire Hunter Valley.

Old West couldn’t imagine that this young boss from China could find better grape seedlings.

“Boss, the cultivation of grape seedlings is very complicated. If you don’t pay attention to a certain detail, it may affect the quality of the grapes ...” Old West tactfully reminded him.

Madam Kelly gently tugged at Old West’s clothes, reminding him that the person in front of him was their boss.

Xia ruofei didn’t think that it was a mistake. He smiled and said,””Uncle Carter, I know all of this. I spent money to buy the winery, so how can I be against money? Don’t you agree?”

Old West was sure that Xia ruofei had been tricked into buying poor quality grape seedlings. Although Xia ruofei had already made it clear, he still could not help but say,””Boss, the grapes of West Winery and gold oak winery are at their best growing period. They can be planted for another 20 to 30 years without a problem. If we replace the grape seedlings, the harvest cycle alone may take two to three years. This ...” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Uncle Carter, I believe that my grape seedlings don’t need such a long period to mature.” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Although his voice was gentle, there was an undeniable meaning behind it.

Old West said dejectedly,””Alright! You’re the boss, so you have the final say ...”

There was a hint of helplessness in his words, as well as some resentment.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””I’ve come to you today to ask you to organize a team to eradicate all the existing grape trees. At the same time, we’ll hire some people. We’ll start planting new grapes tomorrow.”

Then, Xia ruofei added,””Don’t worry, uncle Carter! The new grape species is still Semillon. From now on, our winery will only produce Semillon white wine! I’m going to make it the symbol of the winery, and even the Hunter Valley!”

Old West looked at the ambitious boss in front of him and smiled bitterly.

It was easy to get rid of the grape trees, but if the seedlings Xia ruofei had prepared were not reliable, it could take two to three years! If he didn’t do this, he would be able to produce a large number of grapes every year to make wine, which would be a great loss.

Moreover, it would be a joke if the wine of a few years in a winery was out of stock.

However, Xia ruofei was now the owner of the winery and even the Golden Oak winery. He had the final say in everything.

No matter how close Old West was to the winery, he was only an employee under Xia ruofei. He had to follow his boss’s orders. To put it bluntly, Xia ruofei only needed to say the word and he would be fired.

“Alright! As you wish, boss!” Old Wester shrugged and said.

Then, he walked into the bar dejectedly and began to call for help.
