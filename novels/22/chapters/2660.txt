2661 The old company commander comes to seek shelter_3

Xia ruofei felt a little more at ease after hearing this. However – at the same time, he began to hesitate – the deputy was his company commander in the past. Now that he was working for him, his mentality ...

Ma Jia seemed to have read Xia ruofei’s mind and took the initiative to say,””RUO Fei, you don’t have to worry. If I go to your side, I’ll definitely be in the right position. I was your leader in the Army, but when we’re here, you’re my boss. I can still distinguish this!”

Guo Zhan laughed and said,”you don’t have to worry about that, RUO Fei!” “This phenomenon is very normal. A few years ago, I had an old comrade who transferred to another job. He was a technical level 9 without any administrative positions. He transferred to his wife’s hometown and became the Deputy Director of the city’s Finance Bureau. In the end, the Deputy Director of the finance Bureau was a soldier that he had led many years ago when he was a platoon leader. After this soldier retired from the Army, he became a civil servant. After so many years, he was promoted to Deputy Director, while he, the old platoon leader, became the Deputy Director of the Bureau. Wasn’t he still very positive? In private, the Deputy bureau chief is very friendly with the old platoon leader, but at work, he still does what he should do. ”

Xia ruofei was a little embarrassed as he said,””I’m not worried about that. It’s just that we’re a private company, and it’s a waste of your talent for you to work with me ... Besides, the people I’m hiring this time are going to work overseas, so they might not be home for a long time ...”

“No problem!” Ma Jia replied. As long as you think that my abilities meet the requirements ...”

“That’s for sure!” Xia ruofei said,”do you think I don’t know the old company commander’s military quality? Even if his explosive power has decreased after his injury, he should be more than enough to deal with my work!”

“Then isn’t it settled?” Ma Jia smiled and said,”as for the future ... My parents are no longer alive, and my wife and I have no children yet. If you can bring a family member, I’ll bring her to work. If not, then it’s fine. Didn’t we live in two different places when we were in the Army? We’re already used to it!”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei replied without hesitation,”I have many positions on that Island overseas that need people. If I remember correctly, sister – in – Law studied Meteorology?”

“You even remember that?” Ma Jia asked in surprise.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”who asked you to show off every day?” Sister – in – Law was still your girlfriend at that time! It’s her first time in the company, and you introduced her to everyone you met, saying that she’s your girlfriend and that she’ll be a meteorological expert in the future!”

“She was still in University at that time!” Ma Jia laughed embarrassedly. “After I graduated, I went to work at the weather control station in my hometown. Do you know what a weather control station in a County is like? The forecast results are the same for almost every place. There’s only so much land in total! It’s also divided into so – and – so town, so – and – so village, so – and – so District ...”

Upon hearing this, everyone could imagine the scene and couldn’t help but laugh.

Xia ruofei said,”I don’t think the salary at the county meteorological station is high.” Ask sister – in – Law to resign and come with you! I have a post there!”

“You even need a meteorological major?” Ma Jia asked in surprise.

“There’s a small airport on the island that needs people from the Meteorological Department! If sister – in – Law didn’t go, I would still have to recruit people outside!” Xia ruofei said,”it’s decided then! Old company commander, call sister – in – Law now. If she has any concerns, tell her that her monthly salary is five thousand Yuan! US dollars! This was only the salary for those who had just joined the company, and it would be increased in the future. In addition, we can help her pay for her insurance and housing Fund in China, just like the employees of our paradise company!”

“Ruofei, your salary is a little high!” Guo Zhan said with a smile. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Yup! RUO Fei, if I were to say this, your sister – in – Law would definitely think that I’ve made a mistake and have accepted some benefits in disguise!” Ma Jia also said.

5,000 US dollars was equivalent to more than 30000 Chinese dollars. Some small businesses could only earn this much in a year. Ma Jia couldn’t help but feel a little scared after hearing it.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”that’s really not high. If we’re working in China, the standard might not be so high. However, there are salary standards for overseas work!” Not to mention that the island is in the South Pacific Ocean. It’s isolated and thousands of miles away from home. It’s a great sacrifice to work there. This can be considered a kind of compensation!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”old company commander, you’re not worried that your income won’t be as high as sister-in-law’s and your status in the family will drop, are you?” There’s no need for that at all. After you’ve joined, your salary will only be higher than sister – in – Law ‘s! Even if one’s financial status determines one’s status in the family, you must still be very tough when you speak!”

After hearing that, everyone burst out into laughter, regardless of whether they had families or not. Even those military officers who were having lunch together revealed a wisp of expectation in their eyes.

After laughing, Guo Zhan seriously said,””RUO Fei, I absolutely trust you! That’s why I’m handing over these excellent officers to you ... Among the few who are here today, besides ma su, they are also facing the problem of surplus personnel. Let me introduce them to you ...”

After he finished speaking, Guo Zhan pointed to the major beside him and said,”This is Liu mingtian, the head of the military supplies Department. Due to his age, he has been rehired this time. Old Liu has also chosen to take his own career. I talked to him this afternoon, and he is very interested in your position. Old Liu is an expert in logistics, and his military skills are no worse than the scouts in the general Army. He used to be a Captain of an assault team! He should be able to help you!”
