Translator: 549690339

Speaking of the jaded skin cream, as Xia ruofei expected, Feng Jing immediately became energetic. All the troubles brought about by her unexpected popularity were thrown out of the window.

Her eyes lit up and she said,”Chairman, I was just about to give you a suggestion!” We have to speed up the progress of the Jade skin cream project! The popularity on the internet comes and goes quickly these days. The opportunity is fleeting!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”yes!” In an era of information explosion, it’s hard for people’s attention to last long, because there are new eye – catching events happening all the time. ”

At this point, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile and say,””Boss Feng, you’re quite clear about this ... But if that’s the case, why are you still worried about becoming famous? Maybe after three to five days, everyone will forget about it!”

“I’m talking business with you!”Feng Rao pouted. Why are you pulling me in again? Can’t we talk about work properly?”

Xia ruofei looked at Feng Jing and sighed.””Every time I see you working so hard that you forget to eat and sleep, I think: His success was not by chance. Those who don’t work hard will have an endless supply of street stalls and an endless supply of food in the market ...”

Feng Rao looked at Xia ruofei in amusement and said,””Chairman, are you having a fever? You’re actually giving me Chicken Soup for the Soul?”

Xia ruofei said seriously,”I’m not done yet!” For someone as talented and hardworking as you ...”

“How is it?” Feng Rao giggled.”Will you be successful and reach the peak of your life?”

Xia ruofei rolled his eyes.”You’re thinking too much. Someone as talented and hardworking as you wouldn’t have the time to shop at street stalls. That’s why you can only work overtime and order takeaway to shop on Taobao.”

The smile on Feng Rao’s face froze. After a while, she rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and pouted.”I hate people who give me poisonous chicken soup with a straight face!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,””I saw that you’ve been too nervous these past two days, so I wanted to ease the atmosphere ...”

Xia ruofei stood up and pointed at the sofa in the guest area.””President Feng, let’s talk over here ...”

Xia ruofei and Feng Jing sat down on the sofa in the reception area of the office. He fiddled with the tea set and made tea as he said without looking up,””Chief Feng, you’ve been back for a few days. You should have understood the situation at the pharmaceutical factory, right? What’s the situation now?” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Overall, it’s progressing very quickly.” Feng Rao organized her thoughts. We’re not short of funds now, so we’ve directly ordered six production lines as we’ve discussed before. They’ve already been shipped to Germany, and the pharmaceutical factory has also been building factories according to the standards of the manufacturers. ”

Xia ruofei gently pushed the cup of tea in front of Feng Rao. Feng Rao said,””Thank you ... Chairman, including the transportation, installation, and debugging time, it will take about two months for all six production lines to be put into production. Factory manager Xue had already personally brought the materials to Beijing for approval. The approval process for skin care products was relatively simple, and now that he had the connections, it shouldn’t be a big problem. I called Kanayama and he said that if everything goes smoothly, he would be able to complete the process in about half a month. Even if there were any delays in the middle, a month would be enough. ”

“What about the raw materials?” Xia ruofei nodded.

“After your instructions last time, I approved a million Yuan of funds to the pharmaceutical factory, all of which will be used to purchase the Chinese medicinal herbs needed for the jaded skin cream.” Feng Jing said,”the pharmaceutical factory’s raw material warehouse is already stocked with a lot of medicinal herbs, and the acquisition is still in progress. There shouldn’t be a problem for it to be put into production in the early stages.”

“We still have to cooperate with the villagers in the future.” Feng Jing continued,”by the way, Chairman, the last ingredient in the formula for the jaded skin cream will be provided by you ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”don’t worry!” I’ve already made arrangements to provide sufficient medicinal herbs at any time!”

That day, after deciding on the production mode and secret method of the jaded skin cream, Xia ruofei had already instructed Xia Qing to open up a special area in the mountain and sea realm to plant the green maple vines in batches.

Furthermore, to prevent the green maple vines from not being able to be supplied in time when they were in production, Xia ruofei even got Xia Qing to find a place in the Archean realm, where time flowed 30 times slower, to plant some first. He would harvest the matured batch and grind them all into powder before continuing to plant.

When the jadeshi ointment was officially put into production, Xia ruofei would definitely be able to provide a sufficient amount of green maple powder.

The green maple vines in the mountain and sea realm were planted in batches every half a month or so. Once they were harvested, they could be produced in an endless stream in the Xuanji spirit map space. There were no seasons, so they could be planted at any time.

“Then there’s no problem!” Feng Rao said happily.

After a moment of silence, she said,”Chairman, I have an idea ... We have a sufficient stock of heart – nourishing soup. There’s still a certain stock in addition to the supply for clinical trials. Can we set up a production line to produce the jaded skin cream in advance?” It’ll take at least two months for the new production line to be put into production, but the approval for the jaded skin cream will probably be completed within a month. There’s a time difference between this and the production line. By then, we’ll definitely face the situation where the approval will be received, but the production line isn’t in place yet. ”

“Will early production violate the policy?” Xia ruofei asked.
