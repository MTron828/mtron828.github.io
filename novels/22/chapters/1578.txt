“No problem!” Yu mingdong said straightforwardly,”let’s go. We’ll claim the winning BID’s raw stone first!”

The group walked towards the counter. Xia ruofei and Song Wei walked side by side and smiled.””Did you bring your card? Do you need me to help you?”

“I can still afford 120000 Yuan,” Song Wei grinned and said,”I don’t need you to pay for it!” If we make a fortune from this, it’ll be hard to explain!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you’re still saying that you don’t have money? you took out 120000 Yuan without even blinking an eye. You’re a little rich woman too!”

“I’ve been saving this money for many years,”Song Wei said coyly. If I really lose everything, you’ll have to compensate me!”

“Pei Pei Pei! They hadn’t even cut the stone yet! “You’re just saying unlucky things ...”Xia ruofei said.

“I’m just preparing for a rainy day! Rich people are all stingier than the next. Who knows if you will go back on your word?” Song Wei chuckled and said.

Very quickly, the group of people arrived at the service desk. Yu mingdong went to handle the delivery procedures, while Xia ruofei and Song Wei went to the adjacent seats and showed the staff the second couplet of the bidding slip.

Song Wei’s raw stone was very small. Not long after she swiped her card, a staff member brought the raw stone to the service desk.

After confirming that there were no mistakes, the transaction was completed.

Then, the two of them went to meet up with Yu mingdong. Yu mingdong was busy swiping his card and paying. He was a little surprised to see Xia ruofei. “You’re done so quickly?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s just a small piece of raw material. We’ll hand over the money and the goods at the same time!”

“Mr. Xia, where are your raw stones?” Yu mingdong asked in surprise.

“Oh, I’m not in a hurry.” Xia ruofei said,”let’s watch you guys cut the stone first!”

Xia ruofei did not plan to cut the raw stones on the spot. These five raw stones were definitely going to increase in value. If they were cut out on the spot, it would be too shocking. It would also inevitably cause people to suspect that no matter how lucky Qianqian was, it could not be so good.

In essence, stone gambling was a probability event, and the huge increase was definitely a small probability event.

When the probability of a small probability event happening became 100%, it was definitely abnormal.

Xia ruofei didn’t want to attract the attention of people with ulterior motives, let alone become the focus of everyone’s attention.

Yu mingdong said with some regret,”I still wanted to cut your raw stone first, and then try my luck!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”President Yu, you’re being superstitious!” I can’t accept this!”

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, even the female staff who was handling the raw stone delivery procedures for Yu mingdong could not help but smile.

How many of the people who came to the public Jade bid were not superstitious? Looking at the Almanac before leaving the house, wearing one or two accessories that could increase one’s luck ... These were all very common. Some people even had strange habits that outsiders would think of, but they were also thinking about it from the perspective of Feng Shui metaphysics.

“Mr. Xia,” Yu mingdong said with a smile,”that’s a bit of a big hat!”

“Hahaha! Don’t worry, President Yu, I believe your luck won’t be too bad!” Xia ruofei laughed.

“Then I’ll really be counting on your blessings.” Yu mingdong said with great joy, as if it had really gone up.

While they were chatting, Yu mingdong’s raw stones had been delivered.

Two of the raw stones were relatively large, and they were directly transported over with a forklift.

When the staff learned that Yu mingdong was preparing to cut the stone on the spot, they immediately arranged a forklift to send the raw stone directly to the next door.

Xia ruofei and the rest followed the forklift out of the public Jade bid.

Song Wei held the raw stone that cost 120000 Yuan in her hands and followed Xia ruofei excitedly.

Shi Lei had already found an empty spot to cut the stones. Xia ruofei went over and was overjoyed. It was the same stone – cutting master from the day before.

Yu mingdong couldn’t help but say happily,””Hahaha! Master, we are really fated!”

The stonecutter had been cutting stones for many people in the past few days, but he still had a deep impression of Xia ruofei and the others. It was not just because the raw stones had increased in value after they were cut, but more importantly, the process of cutting stones that day was full of ups and downs and was full of drama.

Therefore, the stonecutter also grinned,””Bosses, I wish you all the best in advance!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The day before yesterday, he had received a red packet of 20000 Yuan, which was much more than what he usually earned by working.

“Haha, I’m counting on your blessings, counting on your blessings ...” Yu mingdong said.

Then, he politely said to Song Wei,””Miss song, why don’t ... You go first with this one?”

Song Wei was a little nervous. She looked at Xia ruofei and gave him a questioning look.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”don’t look at me!” It’s up to you. It’s all the same no matter when you open it. ”

In any case, this raw stone would definitely rise in price. It was actually not bad to open it first. It was equivalent to a good start, and it could also be considered as a good start for Yu mingdong.

It didn’t matter if he opened it later. Xia ruofei also took a look at Yu mingdong’s raw stones. He still had an impression of at least four or five of them, which meant that the Jade inside should be good.

Therefore, even if the other pieces might be cut down, in general, Yu mingdong could at least maintain a zero – profit and no – loss situation.

For a Jade boss, it was already a good result to be able to buy good Jade at a cost price. After all, it was rare to see a situation where he made tens of millions of Yuan like the day before yesterday.

Song Wei pondered for a moment and nodded,”Alright then, let’s cut mine first!”

Song Wei then passed the raw stone in her hand to the master.

The stonecutter weighed the raw stone in his hand and asked,”Boss, How do I solve this?”

Naturally, Song Wei was dumbfounded. She subconsciously turned to look at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”I don’t know much about this either. How about you give me some advice?” Or perhaps he might as well slowly grind his way in! This raw stone isn’t that big anyway. ”

“Then we’ll do as Mr. Xia says!” Yu mingdong said.

The stonecutter nodded his head readily, and quickly changed the hand grinding wheels. After fixing the raw stone in place, he turned on the power and began to grind.

Song Wei clenched her fists tightly and watched the master’s movements nervously.

It was the first time she had seen such a scene, so of course, she was looking forward to seeing a beautiful jade in this seemingly ordinary stone.

Earning money or not was secondary.

Stone fragments flew in all directions, and many people came to watch the fun.

Especially when they saw that it was Xia ruofei, Yu mingdong and the others who were cutting the stones, more and more people gradually gathered around them. Jian Jia and the others were in the limelight the day before yesterday. They had directly ruined the reputation of a senior stone gambling consultant and even made tens of millions. They could be said to be the biggest winners of that public bid.

Everyone also wanted to see if the miracle from last time could happen again.

“It’s Green, it’s Green!” Someone with sharp eyes shouted.

The stonecutter was the person closest to the raw stones. He had also seen it and immediately moved the grinding machine away from the raw stones and turned off the power.

He put down the grinding machine, went over to get a wet cloth, and wiped the place where he had just ground.

Song Wei followed Xia ruofei and got closer to the raw stone. She saw with her own eyes that after the stonemason wiped the stone with a wet cloth, the polished part revealed an intoxicating green color. She could not help but cheer.

He finally saw the most original Jade! It turned out that the raw materials of those beautiful jade products were all produced in this way! Song Wei also felt a strange feeling in her heart.

Xia ruofei could not help but smile when he saw how excited Song Wei was.

In fact, Song Wei was more like a lady from a big family. She treated people well and grew up in a leading family. Naturally, she had a trace of grace and luxury. However, when she was with Xia ruofei, her nature was released. Sometimes, she was like a carefree little girl. Actually, Song Wei was not much younger than Xia ruofei.

“This water source is pretty good!”

“How much did you buy this raw material for? It’s definitely going up!”

“It’s so shallow, but there’s already green. I’m afraid it’s going to increase by a lot!”

Everyone was also in a heated discussion.

Yu mingdong’s face was also filled with joy. He thought that Mr. Xia was really a Lucky Star. Today was another good start. His next stone cutting should be very smooth!

Many people came over to take a look at the raw stone, and some impatient people even started bidding.

“Young lady, are you selling this piece of material? I’m willing to pay 200000!”

” 230 thousand! Sell it to me!” As soon as the person in front of him made a bid, another person immediately added another 20000.

Song Wei was also shocked. She had bought this stone for 120000 Yuan. She had only used a grinding machine to grind a small window, but her value had doubled. No wonder so many people were crazy about stone gambling ...

Besides, Song Wei did not understand why these people were so enthusiastic about bidding when they had just opened up a small opening. Weren’t they afraid that there was only a little Jade inside?

What song Wei didn’t know was that these people had been in this industry for many years. They could more or less see the way to the raw materials that had already been cut open.

Moreover, wasn’t the core of stone gambling the word ‘gambling’? This way of bidding was also a bet that the price would rise later. If all the materials were revealed, there would be no room for speculation, and the price would basically be transparent.

Of course, Xia ruofei did not want Song Wei to sell it now. He was 100% sure that the price of this raw stone would rise and he would only make more money if he continued to sell it.

However, before he could remind Song Wei, she said,””I’m sorry! I’m not selling this raw stone! Master, please continue driving!”

The master of cutting stones grinned and said,””Alright!”

The grinding machine started to make a buzzing sound again. The stone – cutting master carefully operated the raw stone to grind off a very shallow layer of Stone Skin, revealing the Jade. So he had to be extra careful to not accidentally damage the Jade.

The master saw that Song Wei had no intention of selling it, so he did not stop in the process. He operated the equipment skillfully and used all kinds of appropriate methods. Soon, the stone was completely cut open.

In front of everyone was a fist – sized piece of Jade. Although the raw stone was not big, the Jade inside was not small.

Yu mingdong immediately went over to look at the color of the Jade, then said happily,””Miss song, congratulations! This was a Jade of the glutinous type, and its quality was quite good! Judging from the price you bought it at, this piece of material has gone up a lot!”

“Thank you, President Yu!” Song Wei took the piece of Jade happily and held it in her hands fondly. Her eyes were almost shining.
