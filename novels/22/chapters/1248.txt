Chapter 1249: Chapter 759 – making friends (2)

Translator: 549690339

Guo Hongjiang, Zheng jianian, and the other influential rich and famous people in Hong Kong could be of great help to Xia ruofei. That was why MA Xiong had deliberately revealed Xia ruofei’s medical skills to them.

MA Xiong smiled and said,”it’s good that Xia Sheng understands!” Director Guo’s influence in Hong Kong is above mine, and there are many fields that our Hengfeng group has not yet been involved in. With his and Zheng’s help, your company will definitely be able to develop very smoothly in Hong Kong!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Thank you, old Mr. MA.”

Everyone got to know each other in the lounge and chatted for a while. The lunch was ready, and MA Xiong called everyone to the banquet hall.

MA Xiong was definitely the main character at the luncheon. He also highly recommended Xia ruofei, so Xia ruofei naturally became one of the focal points. Many of MA Xiong’s friends came up to toast and chat with him.

Guo Hongjiang and Zheng jianian were even more enthusiastic about Xia ruofei.

After the lunch, the two of them chatted with Xia ruofei for a long time and invited him to their house.

In the afternoon, the auction’s cleaning up was basically over.

Hengfeng’s transfer was naturally fast. More than 15 million dollars of auction funds were transferred to Xia ruofei’s overseas offshore company account on the same day.

Now, Xia ruofei’s offshore account already had more than 30 million US dollars. This money was more than enough to cover the daily expenses of the Australian winery.

Meanwhile, Australia’s Paradise Farm was about to start generating profits soon. The new grapes had been planted in the winery, and if everything went well, they should be able to use the new grapes to make wine next year. At that time, the winery would also be able to generate considerable profits, and the offshore company would have more and more funds.

Moreover, it was very easy to transfer money back to China from overseas.

If there was a lack of funds to pay for the building, Xia ruofei could transfer a sum of money back at any time.

Of course, it would take some effort to transfer the money back. Hence, Xia ruofei would not use the money unless it was necessary.

Feng Jing and her team handed over the work here and prepared to return to the three mountains the next morning.

That night, Xia ruofei asked Ma Zhiming to book a private room at Hengfeng Jiahua Hotel and invited Feng Jing and the employees to have a meal together. It could be considered a celebration party.

Besides, Xia ruofei had also specifically instructed Feng Jing to buy a gift for each employee at the airport’s duty free shop. The limit was 30000 Yuan. Even Feng Jing had her own. Xia ruofei had paid for the gift out of his own pocket as a reward for his own employees.

The team that came to Hong Kong this time, including Feng Jing, only had four or five people. Xia ruofei had earned more than 15 million US dollars, which was almost 100 million Chinese dollars. The welfare for these employees was only about 100000 Yuan, so Xia ruofei naturally didn’t care.

He had always been very generous to his employees.

Wu Qian and the other girls were naturally overjoyed. They all shouted,”long live the boss!” With 30000 Yuan, they could at least buy a very good LV bag or other luxury goods of equivalent value at the airport’s duty – Free store. For these girls, this was simply a heavenly blessing!

Feng Jing knew Xia ruofei’s temper, so she didn’t reject him. She even expressed her gratitude to Xia ruofei on behalf of the employees.

After dinner, Wu Qian and the others dragged Feng Jing out to go shopping.

Wu Qian said with a smile,”President Feng, we’ve been working here for almost a week. Today’s work is completed successfully. Come with us to relax!”

“That’s right, President Feng!”A round – faced girl also said. Aren’t you afraid that you’ll tire yourself out from working all day long? You need to have a sense of relaxation!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Boss Feng, I think the employees are right. Don’t be too tense. Relax when you need to!”

“There’s still a few more emails from the company, but I didn’t have time to read them today!”Feng Jing said with a bitter smile. I’m going to deal with it tonight!”

Actually, Feng Jing wasn’t much older than Wu Qian and the others. It was just that she was too engrossed in her work. She looked like a typical career woman, so she appeared to be more mature than her actual age.

Wu Qian and the others were all thinking about Hong Kong’s night view or shopping at Sha Sha’s store, but Feng Jing was still thinking about work.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”CEO Feng, you can’t finish your work!” I think Fangfang was right just now. We must have a balance between work and rest! You don’t have to do anything tonight, go out with them! This is an order!”

Feng Rao glared at Xia ruofei and said,”What kind of order is this?”

Wu Qian was Feng Jing’s assistant and was closer to her, so she was a little braver with her words. She giggled and said,””President Feng, in our company, the chairman’s words are like the Imperial edict! Do you dare to disobey the decree?”

“What nonsense is this ... Fine!” Feng Rao smiled bitterly. I can go out with you, but I have to be back before 10 O’ clock!”

“Ah? At Teno’ clock ...”Wu Qian’s face suddenly turned bitter.

Xia ruofei quickly gave Wu Qian a look. Wu Qian immediately understood and said,””Alright, alright, alright, I’ll listen to you!”

Xia ruofei said,”that’s right!” Wait a minute! I’ll arrange a car for you. Just tell the driver where you want to go!”

“Yay! Long live the chairman!” Wu Qian said happily.

Xia ruofei gave Ma Zhiming a call. Ma Zhiming naturally arranged a business car for Xia ruofei without a second thought. He even sent the best driver in the company.

Feng Jing left the hotel with Wu Qian and the rest. Xia ruofei secretly heaved a sigh of relief. He took out his phone and called Monica as he walked towards the elevator.

When Xia ruofei returned to the Presidential Suite on the top floor, she immediately took out a 2.5 – kilogram piece of white truffle from her interspace and placed it in the refrigerator that had been specially added to the Presidential Suite.

He then walked to the large balcony connected to the living room and looked down from the balcony on the highest floor.

At this time, the lights in Hong Kong had just lit up. The beautiful Port Victoria was in the distance. From Xia ruofei’s position, he could see the lights of the boats on the sea and the traffic on the seaside roads.

The night was intoxicating.

However, Xia ruofei’s mind was not on the night.

After he smoked a cigarette on the balcony, he heard Yue ‘er’s doorbell ring.

He quickly snuffed out the cigarette and threw it into the trash can by the balcony door. Then, he rushed over to open the door.

Monica was standing at the door.

She was still wearing the dress that she had worn at the auction today. Her slender legs were stretched tightly by the dress, and her graceful figure was undoubtedly revealed. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

However, Monica’s hair was still wet. It was obvious that she had already taken a shower in the room, changed into this dress, and dressed up carefully.

Xia ruofei could see the tenderness in her charming blue eyes. Xia ruofei, who was already a little impatient, fell for her even more at this moment.

He grabbed Monica’s hand and pulled her gently, causing Monica to fall into his arms.

Then, Xia ruofei locked the door with his foot. The two of them couldn’t wait to kiss each other in the living room. Their charming voices soon rang out in the Presidential Suite.

......

After a long time, Monica, with her messy hair and lazy expression, drew circles on Xia ruofei’s chest and asked,””Xia, is the truffle you mentioned in the morning in Hong Kong? I don’t want to return empty – handed from this trip to China ...”

“Monica, you’re so charming,” Xia ruofei said with a smile.”I forgot what I was supposed to do when I saw you ...”

Xia ruofei sat up straight and said, “Let’s go baby! I’ll show you the stock I’ve specially reserved for you!”

Monica was already weak from the torture, but when she heard that the truffle was in the Presidential Suite, she immediately perked up and quickly sat up.

Xia ruofei did not hide anything in front of Monica and walked straight to the living room. Monica casually wrapped a towel around her and quickly followed.

“Clang clang clang clang!” Xia ruofei smiled and opened the door of the cold cabinet.”Baby, come and take a look. Are you satisfied?”

Just as Monica walked over in anticipation, the melodious doorbell suddenly rang ...
