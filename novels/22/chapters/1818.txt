“No... Tell me the truth, is there any progress in your cultivation?” Ling Qingxue quickly asked,”have you gathered all the medicinal herbs you mentioned last time?” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Xia ruofei deliberately kept her in suspense.”Don’t ask so many questions. I’ll just ask you one thing. Are you coming or not?”

Ling Qingxue was silent for a moment, then said,””Alright, I’ll come over then ...”

Xia ruofei said happily,”good girl!” Qingxue, if you’re not busy with work these few days, you can ask uncle Ling for a leave of absence! Just take it as a few days off and rest at my farm!”

Xia ruofei had already explained it so clearly, so how could Ling Qingxue not understand? she was very excited and immediately said,”I know! You wait for me!”

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei communicated with Xia Qing using his spiritual will and asked him to brew the medicine as soon as possible because Ling Qingxue was about to arrive.

The flow of time in the spirit map’s space was 30 times slower than that of the outside world. Hence, Xia Qing had more than enough time. When Xia ruofei contacted him, he had just harvested the heart – concentrating grass and was setting up a spirit – gathering array.

Xia Qing said,”I understand, master.” I’ll have to invite you in to set up the time formation flags later, but I’m almost done ...”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei agreed readily.

He entered the spirit map space once again. Xia Qing had already harvested the heart concentrating grass. Now, only a small section of the heart concentrating grass was left on the ground. As time flowed 30 times faster at the Archean realm, especially during the recovery period, the rate of spirit Qi consumption was also relatively fast. Thus, Xia Qing did not remove the spirit gathering array and even placed a few more spirit crystals on it.

Xia Qing was currently grabbing medicinal herbs from the Archean realm medicinal rack, preparing to brew a medicinal soup.

When he saw Xia ruofei enter, he quickly put down his work and came over to greet him.

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”Don’t worry about me. Hurry up and brew the medicine. I need it urgently.”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing respectfully replied.

“Have you finished setting up the heart – concentrating grass?” Xia ruofei asked again.

“Master, everything is ready,” Xia Qing replied.”The spirit gathering array has also been replaced with new spirit crystals. You just need to set up the time array!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”sure!” Go and do your work!”

Then, he walked to the heart – concentrating grass and waved his hand. All the time array flags floated up and slowly floated in front of Xia ruofei.

He grabbed the array flag and waved it casually. The time array flag immediately flew in different directions and landed in the right positions.

Xia ruofei’s improvement in spiritual power was very obvious. He had finished setting up the time formation almost in an instant.

Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to feel the array and immediately noticed the time difference between the inside and outside of the array. This feeling was too easy for a cultivator who had cultivated his spiritual power.

This meant that the time formation had been set up and was in effect.

After setting up the formation, Xia ruofei felt around and realized that the consumption of spiritual crystals had increased. Furthermore, the state of the heart concentrating grass was also recovering at a speed that could be seen with the naked eye.

He observed for a while and saw that Xia Qing was busy brewing the medicine. He said goodbye and left the spirit map space. As for the specific matters, Xia Qing was naturally in charge of them.

After returning to the outside world, Xia ruofei strolled down the stairs and took a walk in the farm before waiting at the gate.

Not long after, Xia ruofei could see the car lights in the distance.

As the car neared, it was indeed Ling Qingxue’s Porsche 911. Xia ruofei immediately asked the veteran on duty at the door to raise the bar.

Ling Qingxue drove the car through the gate of the farm and stopped, then rolled down the window.

Xia ruofei walked over with a smile and said,””Wife, you’re pretty fast!”

Ling Qingxue rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,”My dad just went to Heron Island with his friends, so I drove here! If you’re lying to me ...”

Xia ruofei put on an innocent expression and said,””Why Would I Lie to You? I really missed you so much that I couldn’t fall asleep, so I called you!”

“You ...” Ling Qingxue glared at Xia ruofei and said,”get in the car!”

Xia ruofei chuckled as he opened the door to the passenger’s seat and sat down.”Wife, don’t be angry ... I definitely won’t let you down tonight!”

“Really?” Ling Qingxue asked as she looked at Xia ruofei.

“Of course!” Xia ruofei vowed,”I will perform well tonight. I won’t stop until you’re satisfied!”

Ling Qingxue was embarrassed and said,”I hate you!” Who said that? I’m talking about the cultivation ...”

Xia ruofei was also confused.””I’m also talking about cultivation! It wasn’t easy for me to find all the herbs, and I’ve made you some Chinese medicine to recuperate your body. I think you’ll be able to recuperate your body to its best state after drinking it ...”

Xia ruofei pretended to be confused and asked,””What did you think I was talking about?”

Ling Qingxue’s face turned red and she said,””I’m too lazy to talk to you! You only know how to bully me!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but burst out laughing.

Ling Qingxue drove back to the small villa in the farm. The two of them entered the villa and Xia ruofei said,””Qingxue, go upstairs and wait for me in the room. I’ll bring the medicinal soup up!”

Ever since Ling Qingxue heard about Xia ruofei’s cultivation, she could not calm down. Although it had only been two or three days, she was still very excited. However, when it was time for her to be exposed to cultivation, she started to feel very nervous.

Xia ruofei saw Ling Qingxue’s expression and couldn’t help but laugh.””Silly girl, don’t be afraid! Go up and wait for me! Cultivation isn’t as complicated as you think. I believe you’ll be able to get started very soon!”

Ling Qingxue nodded and walked up the stairs.

Xia ruofei, on the other hand, went to the kitchen and took out the medicinal soup that Xia Qing had brewed from the spirit map space. He heated it in the microwave and walked upstairs with the medicine bowl.

When he returned to his room, Ling Qingxue was sitting on the bed, a nervous expression on her face.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Qingxue, come here and drink this bowl of medicine. Then, I’ll teach you what to do next ...”

The bowl of medicine looked ordinary, but it had actually used up an entire stalk of heart – concentrating grass, which was worth a city. The second stalk of heart – concentrating grass had already been cultivated in the spirit map space, so it was worth at least nine to ten spiritual crystals! Xia ruofei’s heart ached again!

Ling Qingxue did not know how precious the medicinal soup was. After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, she immediately walked over, picked up the bowl, and sniffed it. Then, she frowned and said,””Ruofei, what a bitter medicine!”

Xia ruofei laughed,”good medicine is bitter!” You just have to close your eyes and drink it in one go! I’ll get you a banana. Eat it immediately after you’re done so that there won’t be any bitterness in your mouth!”

“Alright!” Ling Qingxue said. But I don’t want to eat bananas, I want plum candy ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”no problem!” I’ll go get it for you now!”

Xia ruofei took out a few plum candies from the box in the living room and went back upstairs.

Ling Qingxue was still holding the bowl of medicine. When she saw that Xia ruofei had really brought the plum candy, she put the bowl to her mouth, closed her eyes, and drank it in one go.

After finishing the medicine, Ling Qingxue immediately called out,””RUO Fei, Tang! Quickly give me a candy! The medicine is too bitter ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and handed over the peeled plum candy.”Hurry up and eat!”

Ling Qingxue swallowed the sweet plum in a few bites, then opened another one and put it in her mouth. She asked,””Ruofei, now that you’ve drunk the medicine, can you start cultivating?”

Xia ruofei had already asked Xia Qing. The medicinal soup made from the heart concentrating grass would take at least one to two hours to fully take effect.

Therefore, he laughed and said,””No hurry, no hurry! Wife, it’s been a while since we’ve been together ...”
