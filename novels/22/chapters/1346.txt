Chapter 1347: Squatting in a row (1)

Translator: 549690339

Tian Xiaojun’s heart skipped a beat. The first thought that came to his mind was: These young masters in Beijing also had their eyes on the Paradise Corporation!

The path that Hou Liang, Xu Zixuan, and the others had taken only led to the backyard, where there was only one private room.

As for Hou Liang’s “having a meal with friends”, Tian Xiaojun had subconsciously ignored it. In his opinion, Hou Liang, Xu Zixuan, and the other second – generation heirs who could be said to be well – known in the capital, coming to the three mountains together was an extremely unusual matter. There was only one explanation, and that was that they had also noticed the peach blossom company’s terrifying ability to make money, and they had come to find them immediately.

Tian Xiaojun’s heart ached so much that he clenched his teeth. Since he had been targeted by this group of men, he probably wouldn’t even have a share of the soup.

“Looks like I’ve made a wasted trip to the three mountains ...” Tian Xiaojun thought in frustration.

However, since there was no way to get the shares of the Paradise company, Tian Xiaojun immediately thought of how to obtain certain benefits.

An idea suddenly flashed through his mind. He didn’t even have time to tell Zhong Zixin and Xia Tian before he quickly chased after Hou Liang and the others.

Hou Liang and the other two chatted as they walked.

“Liang bro, don’t we ... Need to wait for Jun bro at the entrance?” Wei Jun asked.

“Young master Song said that they’re going to take a detour to pick someone up. Brother Jun told us to go in first and not wait for him!” Hou Liang said with a smile.

“Oh ...” Wei Jun nodded and said,”it seems that young master Song has quite a few friends in the three mountains!”

“That’s for sure ...” Xu Zixuan said with a smile,”brother Rui has been at the three mountains for quite a long time, he’s familiar with this area!”

“Brother Xuan, the one we’re most familiar with is the one we’re about to meet, right?” Hou Liang asked with a smile. I’m a native of the three mountains!”

“Hahaha! That’s true ...”Xu Zi Xuan said with a smile.

At this moment, Tian Xiaojun caught up with him, panting. He shouted,”Young master Xu, young master hou, please wait!”

Hou Liang and the others stopped in their tracks and turned around to look at Tian Xiaojun. They did not understand why this guy had become so clingy.

Tian Xiaojun smiled awkwardly and asked,”Young master Xu, young master hou, if you don’t mind me asking ... Are you going to find ...”

At this point, Tian Xiaojun pointed at the door of the small courtyard not far away and continued,”Xia ruofei from paradise Corporation?”

Hou Liang and the other two exchanged glances. Then, Hou Liang asked indifferently,””How did you know?”

Tian Xiaojun chuckled and said, “Didn’t I ... Just come out?”

Hou Liang raised his eyebrows. He sized up Tian Xiaojun and asked,”You know the person inside?”

Tian Xiaojun quickly waved his hand.”Young master hou, please don’t misunderstand. I have nothing to do with that Xia ruofei. I’m not trying to help him!”

Tian Xiaojun thought that Hou Liang had misunderstood that he was speaking up for Xia ruofei, so he explained in a hurried tone, afraid that Hou Liang would be unhappy with him.

Little did he know that the moment he said this, the expressions of Hou Liang and the other two changed slightly.

Hou Liang and Xu Zixuan looked at each other again before he asked,”So, what’s the purpose of your visit?” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Tian Xiaojun’s face revealed a trace of embarrassment, and he laughed awkwardly,”I know I can’t hide it from young master hou’s eyes ... We’re actually here for the Paradise corporation’s shares ...”

When Hou Liang heard the word ‘shares’, the muscles on his face couldn’t help but Twitch. However, he still remained calm and asked indifferently,””Since you’ve seen us coming, what are you doing here? Don’t tell me you still want to split ...”

“I absolutely didn’t mean it that way! I definitely didn’t mean it that way!” Tian Xiaojun quickly said, almost swearing to the heavens,”didn’t I ... Get rebuffed by that Xia ruofei? That’s why I’m here to remind you, young master hou ...”

Then, Tian Xiaojun quickly explained, “I’m not underestimating your abilities, but I’ve been in contact with Xia ruofei just now. This person doesn’t know what’s going on. If you rashly ask for shares, he might not buy it. I’m afraid we’ll have to do something ...”

“What method do you think we should use?” Hou Liang asked with narrowed eyes.

Tian Xiaojun’s spirit was lifted, and he chuckled,”Young master hou, there are so many ways to deal with a small company like this! Any random functional Department could just give them a heads up and they would not be able to continue operating! I wanted to ask the price Department to teach him a lesson, but since you’re here, I don’t have to do anything ...”

Hou Liang slowly nodded. Beside him, Xu Zixuan and Wei Jun were looking at Tian Xiaojun as if he was already a dead man.

Tian Xiaojun was still unaware of it, and he said as if he was taking credit,”Young master hou, according to my judgment, it’s more difficult to make him submit directly. It’s better to teach him a lesson first, then it’ll be much easier to talk to him later ... Oh right!”

After saying that, Tian Xiaojun quickly added,”This Xia ruofei is not only muddleheaded, but he’s also a little barbaric. He doesn’t care about us at all just because he has some skills ...”

Hou Liang’s gaze gradually turned cold as he asked,””So ... You even fought with him?”

Tian Xiaojun replied awkwardly,”it’s not really a fight!” Xia Ling ... The brother who was with me just now, he only pointed at him and he almost broke his finger. If you guys come into contact with him, please be careful ...”
