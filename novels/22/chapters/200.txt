Chapter 201: Spare no expense (1)

Once Xia ruofei returned to the villa, he was surrounded by Hu Zi’s mother and the other two. “Ruofei, it wasn’t convenient for me to ask since Qingxue was around just now ...” Hu Zi’s mother asked,”what does Qingxue’s family do?” Lin Qiao’s eyes glowed with curiosity. Even ye Lingyun, who was usually quiet, pricked up his ears. “Her family ... Runs a restaurant!” Xia ruofei laughed. “That’s good!” Hu Zi’s mother said,”it’s good to open a restaurant! Now that everyone’s living is better, the restaurant’s business is not bad!” Lin Qiao laughed and said,”mom ... Sister-in-law’s family must be rich!” I’ve seen the car she drove on the internet. It’s worth at least one or two million!” “Argh! It’s so expensive?” Hu Zi’s mother was also shocked. She looked at Xia ruofei and asked,”ruofei, does Qingxue’s family really own a restaurant?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Auntie, I’m not lying to you. Her family really runs a restaurant.” However, her family’s business is quite big ... Oh right, her family’s restaurant also has a partnership with me. It’s one of the two restaurants that I provide vegetables to every day, called Ling’s restaurant. ” Ling Ji restaurant was very famous in the southeast province, so Hu Zi’s mother had naturally heard of it. When she heard this, she couldn’t help but look worried and said,””Oh ... That’s a big business! Her family is so rich, so ... Will her elders dislike us?” “Mom, what are you thinking? Sister-in-law’s family is rich, and so is brother ruofei!” Lin Qiao said,”he opened such a big farm right after he left the military. Even the rich people in Hong Kong are fighting to buy his truffles!” “That’s different ... After all, RUO Fei doesn’t have any Foundation. ” Hu Zi’s mother said worriedly. Xia ruofei smiled and said,”aunty, don’t worry about this!” Qiao’ er is right, her family is rich, but I’m not that much worse off than them. Besides, Qingxue isn’t the kind of person who likes the rich, or she wouldn’t be with me!” Hu Zi’s mother nodded and said,”yes, ruofei. It’s good that you’re confident in yourself. Oh, right. In the future, call Qingxue over to play more often. That girl is really likable ...” “Sure, I’ll call her over when her company isn’t so busy.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Auntie, you should rest early too. I’ll go back to my room first.” After greeting Hu Zi’s mother and the rest, Xia ruofei went upstairs to his bedroom. He locked the door and windows, summoned the spirit map scroll, and entered the original space with a thought. Xia ruofei had to start preparing the meeting gift for Ling Xiaotian. If Ling Xiaotian liked other things, Xia ruofei might have been a little confused. However, he loved Arowana so much that it was much easier for Xia ruofei. He didn’t dare to say about other things in this original space, but there were many Red Arowana. The only problem was that these red Arowana had only been born for a short period of time. They were generally relatively young and had not even started to have hair color. However, to Xia ruofei, this was not a big problem. He took a box and filled it with the water in the space pool. He came to the fish pond where the young red Arowana were raised. Xia ruofei closed his eyes and used his mind to communicate with the spirit map space. Then, he focused all his senses on the fish pond. Soon, he had a panoramic view of the entire fish pond. Slowly, Xia ruofei’s attention was focused on the 70 – odd young red Dragon in the fish pond. His mind swept through every single fish. In the end, Xia ruofei chose two young fish, one male and one female. They were the best pair of fish in this batch. Xia ruofei used his mind to “wrap” the two young fish and controlled them to move slowly to the side of the fish pond. In a short while, this pair of young red Dragon fish, about 20 centimeters long, was pushed to the side of the fish pond by Xia ruofei’s gentle strength. Xia ruofei squatted down, carefully picked up the pair of fish, and placed them in the sorting box. Then, Xia ruofei moved the sorting box to a small fish pond not far away. This small fish pond was originally dug by Xia ruofei to raise the pair of blood red Dragons. Now that the young fish had moved to the newly dug large fish pond and the two blood red Dragons had been brought to the outside world by Xia ruofei, the small fish pond was empty. Now, it came in handy. Xia ruofei carefully placed the two young red Dragons into the small fish pond. Then, he walked to the nameless plant and found the preservation box that contained the petals of the strange flower. Xia ruofei picked up a petal with a pair of tweezers and threw it into the small fish pond. Even though the space had a time flow that was 30 times faster, it would still take a long time for the Red Dragon to grow into a Supreme – grade Blood Red Dragon that Xia ruofei could use. Hence, if Xia ruofei wanted to shorten this time as much as possible, he had to continue looking for other help. The petals of the strange flower were undoubtedly a great help. Now, he already had 17 petals, and he was about to get another five, so he didn’t feel particularly bad about the gift Yingying prepared for his future father – in – Law. He couldn’t be careless at all. It was just a petal, so it didn’t matter if he used it up. Of course, in terms of value, a pair of high – Quality blood – Red Dragons could not be compared to a whole petal. However, this was a gift for his future father – in – Law, so Xia ruofei did not care about the cost. The water in the pond was a spatial spirit pond, so when the petals fell into the pond, they immediately dissolved without a trace. The two young red Dragons, who were still not used to the new environment, were like cats that smelled fish. They swam excitedly in the fish pond. From the moment they were born until now, Xia ruofei would occasionally drop a small amount of petal solution into the pond. However, it was diluted and there were very few exotic flower petals in it. Moreover, the fish pond was so big that more than 70 young red Dragons were fighting for it. In the end, they could only get a pitiful amount. But this time, it was completely different. The fish pond wasn’t very big. The petals of the exotic flower had dissolved in the water. It could be said that every drop of water contained a large amount of energy from the petals that made them extremely happy. Furthermore, there were no other young fish in the pond fighting for food. The entire petal belonged to the two fish. Xia ruofei’s idea was simple. The original space had thirty times the time flow. If he added the spiritual Qi – rich environment in the space, one day inside would be equivalent to more than a month in the outside world. If he did not mind using an entire petal, the growth rate would definitely be greatly increased. He estimated that in a day in the outside world, these two young red Dragons could grow to the level of two or three months in the outside world. In ten to twenty days, this pair of young red Dragon should be able to grow to the extent of normal growth in the outside world for several years. A conservative estimate would be 50 to 60 centimeters long. Most importantly, the red Arowana that had absorbed an entire petal of the exotic flower would definitely be first – Class in quality. When the time came, it would definitely be a good gift for Ling Xiaotian. After observing for a while, Xia ruofei walked around the space to check on the growth of Phoebe zhennan wood, ginseng, and other crops. Then, he went to the new space to replenish the food for xiaohei and the rest and played with them for a while. After that, Xia ruofei checked the oak trees. The oak trees that were moved to the new space were all very energetic. Their leaves were green, and they had probably taken root and survived. However, the new space had the same flow of time as the outside world. It would only take a few days for them to be transplanted here. Hence, Xia ruofei was not in a hurry to remove the wooden sticks that were used as support. Xia ruofei looked around in the new space. The space was getting bigger and bigger. This time, it had not evolved completely, but the new space had reached 30 to 40 acres. If he walked around, it would take a long time. Xia ruofei suddenly had an idea,”can we get a means of transportation to get in?” However, the terrain in this space was uneven and there were no roads. Ordinary cars or even off – road vehicles would be useless in there. Besides, if the vehicle was too heavy, Xia ruofei could not bring it into the space. Take Knight XV for example. If Xia ruofei wanted to move it into the origin space, he would probably have to repeat the dangerous scene when he was transplanting the Phoebe zhennan trees. Xia ruofei thought as he strolled around. Blackie, fluffy one, and fluffy two followed closely behind him. Suddenly, Xia ruofei thought of a great idea.
