Chapter 1025: Chapter 656 – rebuking the square (2)

Translator: 549690339

Buying a two – or three – story office building and buying land from the government to build their own building were two completely different concepts.

Not to mention other things, just the capital investment alone was also incomparable.

Especially now that the land was in such a hot state.

Moreover, with the current scale of the Paradise Corporation, if the area of the headquarters building was huge, it would definitely not be used up. This would involve the problem of renting or selling to other companies. Paradise Corporation had never had any experience in real estate development. As the saying goes,”you can’t be a newbie when you’re familiar with it”. The water in this was very deep.

And if they wanted to use it independently, just like the Ling Ji F & B headquarters, they had to consider the problem of funds and usage rate. If they built it too high and the area was too large, paradise Corporation would not be able to use it all. There would definitely be a lot of space left idle. If they invested a large amount of funds in the early stages, it would eventually become a waste.

Feng Jing immediately voiced her concerns.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”CEO Feng, that’s why I said we should look further!” It might be enough for now, but it didn’t mean it would be enough in the future! Our paradise Corporation is destined to become a great Corporation that will attract the attention of the entire world, and in the short term, our company will soon set up an overseas business department. As the company expands step by step, if we only purchase or rent two or three floors of office buildings now, we’ll definitely face the problem of not having enough space. ”

Xia ruofei then passed the tea to Feng Jing and continued,””And don’t you think that only by having the entire building to ourselves would it be in line with our company’s high – end and classy position?”

Feng Rao couldn’t help but burst into laughter. “That’s great! However, the funding will be a big problem!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Currently, we do not have enough funds. However, whether it’s land or building, the funds are not a one – time investment. The construction of this building may last for a few months or even one or two years. With such a long buffer, the funds will not be a problem.”

Xia ruofei saw that Feng Rao was still in a daze, so he smiled and said,””Don’t forget, our Paradise Farm in Australia will soon start large – scale planting. I’ve estimated the output of Paradise Farm at full power, and the profit it can bring to the company every month should be in the tens of millions of us dollars!”

Feng Rao couldn’t help but take a deep breath as her beautiful eyes revealed a strange light,””Chairman, I’m not too familiar with the situation at Paradise Farm in Australia. I know that the profits should be pretty good, but I didn’t expect ...”

“That’s money for the future. “Xia ruofei laughed and said,” we don’t have that kind of capital for the time being. That’s why I said that we’re not in a hurry and can take our time to investigate. If there’s a suitable plot of land or a building for sale, we might as well go and understand it in detail. If we want to do it, we’ll do it in one step and do our best!”

When Xia ruofei said this, he was high – spirited and had a sense of rebuking and pointing out the country.

“Understood!” Feng Rao replied excitedly. Chairman, I’ll keep an eye on this information!”

“Boss Feng, you won’t blame me for not taking this matter seriously, will you?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Feng Rao smiled in embarrassment and said,””Since the chairman already has a plan, I’m relieved ...”

“Come, come, come, let’s have some tea!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”since I’m free today, I’ll let you know about the recent events.”

“Alright!” Feng Rao immediately took out her notebook.

Xia ruofei smiled.”First of all, it’s about Paradise Farm. I’ve said it last time. The seeds need to be done as soon as possible. During this time, you guys should communicate more with manager Liang in Australia.”

Liang Qichao’s identity was a little special. Although he was the person in charge of Paradise Farm, he was not an employee of paradise Corporation. Strictly speaking, he was the representative sent by Xia ruofei’s partner, Tang He. However, Xia ruofei trusted him very much, so he was fully responsible for the work of Paradise Farm.

Feng Jing nodded.”Alright. I’ve already assigned someone to handle this. I’ll report to you as soon as I get any new information.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”also, the Maya Group in Australia will invest 10 million USD to set up the Paradise charity fund. This charity fund will be jointly managed by the Paradise Corporation and the Maya Group in Australia. The foundation will be under the name of the Paradise Corporation.”

Feng Rao was greatly shocked.

As a former senior Manager of one of the top 500 companies in the world, Feng Jing naturally knew of the famous Mei ya group.

She did not expect Xia ruofei to be so capable that he could “swindle” 10 million US dollars from the Meiya group to set up a charity fund. Although the charity fund was jointly organized by two companies, it was named after Paradise Corporation and was also under paradise corporation’s name. It was basically a free gift.

“Chairman, you’re so cool ...” Feng Jing mumbled.

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”it’s a little complicated to explain. Anyway, you just need to know that the establishment of the charity fund was decided by me and the founder of the Meiya group, Mr. Tang Yitian. It’s a done deal. When the time comes, the Meiya group will send people over to help us complete the preliminary application for the foundation and other preparatory work. Then, the 10 million US dollars they promised will be transferred to the Foundation’s account as soon as possible.”

Xia ruofei paused and continued,””So ... Our company might need to do another recruitment in the near future. We mainly need talents in two areas. One is the foreign trade talents who are proficient in foreign languages and foreign laws and policies for the establishment of the overseas business department, and the other is the staff of the charity Foundation. In addition, we can also supplement some management staff for the pharmaceutical factory. After all, after the clinical trials are over, the pharmaceutical factory will start production officially. I’m worried that Xue Jinshan doesn’t have enough manpower.”

“Alright!” Feng Rao immediately replied. Chairman, I’ll immediately organize a meeting with my colleagues in the Human Resources Department to come up with a plan and try to recruit people as soon as possible. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””I’ll leave the specific matters to you. I’m assured when you do it! Hahaha ...”

Feng Rao couldn’t help but secretly roll her eyes. This guy always talked about slacking off in such a fresh and refined way ...

However, Feng Jing was used to Xia ruofei’s working style.

As a successful career woman, Feng Jing didn’t like her boss giving her too much orders. So far, her work at paradise Corporation had been very pleasant. This was also inseparable from Xia ruofei’s habit of being a boss who did nothing.

“I understand! Don’t worry, Chairman. I’ll get this matter settled as soon as possible. ” Feng ke said.

Then, Feng Rao asked curiously,””By the way, Chairman, I just saw you coming out of the marketing department. What’s the matter today?”

Xia ruofei was speechless,”you’re asking me this as if I’ve been slacking off at home and never went to work ...” But then he thought about it and realized that he really was like that ...

“I was just about to tell you about this!” Xia ruofei said,”I’m looking for a colleague from the art design team to help me design an exterior packaging.”

“The packaging?” Feng Jing’s eyes lit up as she asked,”Chairman, is the company going to release a new product?” Could it be that the jaded skin cream can be mass produced?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile bitterly,”even a strong woman can’t resist the temptation of the jaded skin cream!” This wasn’t the first time Feng Jing had mentioned the mass production of jaded skin cream to him. It was as if it was a crime not to mass – produce such a good cosmetic product to benefit all women.

Xia ruofei scratched his head and said,”there are still some technical difficulties in the mass production of jaded skin cream. It’s not possible for now.” But you’re half right, we do have a new product, and this new product must be a phenomenal one!”
