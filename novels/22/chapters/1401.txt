Chapter 1402: The sound of applause (2)

Translator: 549690339

Now, this world – Class problem had been solved by the Chinese.

Furthermore, it was conquered using pure Chinese medicine techniques.

In today’s era where Chinese medicine was being questioned and on the decline, such news was undoubtedly a shot in the arm.

This was definitely explosive news!

Therefore, when Xue Jinshan finished his press conference and began the Q & A session, almost everyone raised their arms in unison.

Xue Jinshan’s response to the reporters “enthusiastic response was also within his expectations. He unhurriedly picked up the mineral water on the podium, unscrewed it, and took a sip. Then, he casually pointed to a female reporter and said with a smile,”Ladies First. The first question will be given to the lady in yellow in the third row!”

The female reporter who got the chance to ask a question was a little excited. After taking the microphone from the staff, she immediately began to ask questions. After saying two sentences, she was surprised to find that the microphone was still off. She quickly turned it on with a red face.

This little interlude made everyone laugh.

Xue Jinshan also smiled and said,”don’t be nervous, take it slow!” There’s no time limit for our questions ...”

“Thank you, factory manager Xue!” The female reporter was indeed a regular at press conferences. She quickly adjusted her embarrassment and revealed an elegant smile.”I’m a reporter from Channel News and Channel News. Thank you, factory manager Xue, for giving me the first chance to ask questions!”

Then, the female reporter went straight to the point and asked,””Manager Xue, the effect of the heart – nourishing soup is so obvious. How much will it be sold for? We know that many families with autism are still very poor. Can these children afford to use the heart – nourishing soup?”

Xue Jinshan smiled. Although the team had already prepared some information for him and some answers to the questions that the reporters might ask, he didn’t even look at them. He directly said,”The price of the heart – nourishing soup was supposed to be announced on our company’s official website and the drug administration’s website at the same time, but since you asked, I’ll announce it here!”

At this point, Xue Jinshan paused for a moment. After attracting everyone’s attention, he continued,”The selling price of our heart – nourishing soup is 168 Yuan per box, and every ten boxes is a course of treatment. According to the severity of the illness, the symptoms can be significantly improved after three to six courses of treatment. Most children can basically return to normal after ten courses of treatment.”

When Xue Jinshan was announcing the numbers, the reporters below the stage were also quickly calculating.

A treatment of 1680 Yuan was not considered expensive. Even if he took 10 treatments, it would only be 16800 Yuan.

One had to know that the slightly better autism treatment institutions were quite expensive. A perceptual integration course would cost at least one or two hundred Yuan, and two or three thousand Yuan a month was considered little. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The most important thing was that this kind of course couldn’t cure autism. It could only improve the child’s perception and correct their behavior to a certain extent, and it required long – term classes.

And according to what Xue Jinshan said, he only needed to pay for half a year’s worth of medical expenses to be able to basically cure her.

He didn’t need to calculate to know which was more cost – effective.

Moreover, he believed that most families could afford 16800 Yuan. Even if it was a poor family, they could still afford it if their relatives and friends pooled their money together and scrimped on food and clothing.

If the medicine was really as effective as it was described and there was no need to take it for a long time, then this price was really a good price.

Xue Jinshan paused for a few seconds to give everyone time to digest this information. Then, he continued,”In order to ensure that every child with autism can receive effective treatment, our pharmaceutical factory’s parent company, the misty paradise company, will also set up a special fund in our paradise Charity Foundation to subsidize children from poor families. At the same time, our pharmaceutical factory will also donate 10000 boxes of heart – nourishing soup every year to provide to children with autism who have difficulties for free. These charity activities will be put into practice in the future, and all media friends are welcome to supervise us!”

After Xue Jinshan finished speaking, the audience immediately broke into a warm round of applause.

Even the reporters who were busy taking photos or writing quickly on their computers stopped what they were doing and clapped hard.

It was not easy for a company to achieve this.

Other things aside, if another pharmaceutical factory were to develop such a special medicine that filled in the gaps, first of all, they would not set such a low price. This was because this medicine did not have to worry about its sales at all. It completely monopolized the market, and with the high proportion of children in the hospital, the supply would definitely not be able to meet the demand.

No matter how much the cost was, the price of the heart – nourishing soup was 168 Yuan a box. At least, it lowered the threshold to a level that most people could afford.

In addition, they also took into account some particularly poor families and specially made a separate project in the charity Foundation. They also donated medicine every year.

Such a company with a strong sense of social responsibility, wasn’t it worth clapping for?

Xue Jinshan waited for the applause to die down before he smiled and said,”Next question, please ask the man with the blue tie in the middle of the first row!”

“Thank you, factory manager Xue!” The male reporter took the microphone, stood up, and said,”I’m a reporter from the news channel of Sanshan TV station. I can foresee that the demand for heart – nourishing soup will be very high in the future. I would like to ask factory manager Xue about your factory’s current production capacity. Will there be a purchase restriction for this medicine like the jaded skin cream?”

The reporter’s words also attracted a burst of laughter, especially some female reporters who had failed to get the jaded skin cream several times. They looked at Xue Jinshan with resentment.

Xue Jinshan felt the gazes on him, as if there was a dagger on his back.

He laughed bitterly in his heart. This was the decision of President Xia and President Feng! Besides ... Our factory is only responsible for production. The sales have nothing to do with us!

He avoided the eyes of the female reporters, organized his words, and said,””Objectively speaking, the production capacity of the heart – nourishing soup can’t meet the needs of the patients for the time being, but we’re already actively responding to it. On one hand, after the medicine was approved, we’ve already started production at full capacity. On the other hand, the company has already approved the factory’s application report. We will immediately continue to import production lines from Germany and further expand the production capacity. This time, we have invested a lot of money to introduce six production lines at once! I believe that very soon, the heart nourishing soup’s shortage will be effectively alleviated!”

After saying this, Xue Jinshan revealed a sincere smile and said,”Yangxin soup is different from jaded skin cream. It’s a type of medicine, and it’s currently the only effective medicine for autism. We’ve come into contact with too many families with autism during the process of drug research and drug testing, and we can feel their pain. So, we won’t monopolize the market and raise the price, nor will we hoard and hoard. We will only continue to expand the production volume while ensuring the quality of the medicine! Let the children of the stars receive the signal from earth as soon as possible!”

Another round of enthusiastic applause rang out.

Just when everyone thought that Xue Jinshan had already answered the question, Xue Jinshan gestured with his hands and continued,””Of course, in order to prevent malicious reselling, we will also have corresponding specific measures. To put it simply, the heart – nourishing soup will only be sold in China for the time being, and we will not sell it through pharmacies or online channels. The only channel is the hospital pharmacy! We don’t limit the number of purchases, but we don’t want the heart – nourishing soup to become a means of profit for scalpers! Therefore, only a real child with autism could buy the heart – nourishing soup with a prescription after a definite diagnosis. Of course, we’ll also ask for assistance from the higher – ups in the Department of Health to monitor the doctors and hospitals. In short, we hope that every box of heart – nourishing soup will be used on children with autism, and not become a tool for others to profit!”
