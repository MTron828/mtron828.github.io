Xia ruofei, on the other hand, went to the indoor training ground and easily completed a series of tests according to the fitness coach’s requirements. He didn’t even sweat much. The fitness coach began to doubt his life. Xia ruofei’s data was a little too perfect!

He had once suspected that the testing equipment had malfunctioned. If it had been any other player, the fitness coach would not have hesitated to let them test again. But now, the person standing in front of him was the major shareholder of the club! He wouldn’t dare to even if he was given a few guts! Was he supposed to tell Xia ruofei,”the test just now was due to an error in the instrument and the data was not accurate. Please do it again?”

Do you still want to work?

Xia ruofei saw the physical trainer’s constipated expression and couldn’t help but ask,””Coach, is there a problem?”

“Argh! No, no... No problem!” The fitness coach said quickly.

Xia ruofei looked at the data in the coach’s hand and said with a smile,””Don’t doubt the authenticity of the data. The machine is definitely not broken. This is the objective data ... If you’re worried, I can do it again!”

“No need, no need!” The physical coach said quickly,”Mr. Xia, you can go and rest for a while. You can join the team training in a while!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei was relieved to hear his coach’s words. He shrugged and said,”thank you for your hard work today!”

“It’s not hard! It’s not hard!” The fitness coach said.

After Xia ruofei left the indoor training ground, the physical trainer busied himself again. Although he did not dare to let Xia ruofei take the test again, he still could not believe that the data was so close to perfect. So he decided to try it himself to see if there was a problem with the testing equipment.

The fitness coach breathlessly finished most of the tests according to Xia ruofei’s order. When he got his data, he couldn’t help but smile bitterly. His data was much worse than Xia ruofei ‘s. As a professional fitness coach, it was embarrassing.

However, this also proved that there was no problem with the testing equipment. Xia ruofei’s physical data was objective and true. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The physical trainer heaved a sigh of relief. He picked up Xia ruofei’s physical strength data and walked quickly to the training ground.

He realized that with Xia ruofei’s current physical condition and strength, he did not have to consider how long he could last in the competition because Xia ruofei could complete the match.

Of course, it was the head coach’s decision whether he could be a starter or even play the entire game. Just because he had good physical fitness did not mean that he could be a starter. After all, Xia ruofei had never played professional football. Besides free kicks, the coaching staff did not know much about other aspects of the situation. Furthermore, Xia ruofei had never cooperated with his teammates. In this case, the possibility of letting him start was very small.

However, no matter what, the physical coach felt that he had the obligation to report Xia ruofei’s physical test data to head coach Ruby as soon as possible, so as to provide a basis for his decision.

When the fitness coach arrived at the training ground, Xia ruofei was already in the team training.

He did not deliberately make use of his practitioner’s ability to perform well. Overall, he could only be considered average. However, even so, Ruby was very surprised. At least in a short time, Ruby saw that Xia ruofei could gain a foothold in the Spanish team based on his performance in the joint training and the team confrontation, even without taking into account the free – kick factor.

This had far exceeded Ruby’s expectations.

As long as Xia ruofei was not rendered useless in both offense and defense, Ruby would have more choices in his lineup. There would be more room for maneuver, and the risk of Xia ruofei’s participation would be greatly reduced.

Ruby was both surprised and happy.

At this time, he saw the fitness coach walking over and asked impatiently,””How is it? How’s Mr. Xia’s physical performance?”
