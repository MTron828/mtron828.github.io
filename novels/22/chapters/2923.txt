2924 Chicken flying and dog jumping (1)

Godman’s heart trembled at Charlie Koch’s words. The importance that Charlie Koch placed on this matter had far exceeded his expectations. As the clan leader of the Koch family, even calling him personally to ask about this matter had already given Godman immense pressure. Now, it seemed like the other party placed far more importance on this matter than that. Based on normal logic, Godman’s level was not even close to Charlie Koch ‘s. At most, Godman would have to report this matter to Pierre. However, Charlie cohe had to follow up personally and bring a satellite phone with him at all times to wait for the results.

This made Goodman even more nervous.

He quickly replied,”understood!” Mr. Cohe, I will definitely give you a satisfactory answer as soon as possible!”

Charlie cohe did not say anything more and directly hung up the phone.

Goodman heard the busy tone from the phone. He waited for two seconds until he was sure the other party had hung up before carefully hanging up.

Goodman’s clothes were drenched in sweat. He even felt a dull pain in his chest. He had been scared out of his wits.

After ending the call with Charlie cohe, Goodman’s body relaxed a little, but it was quickly replaced by a burning rage.

Orders were sent out from the luxurious Manor on the edge of the Caribbean Sea. At the same time, feedback was quickly collected from various places to Goodman’s Manor.

Right now, the entire Bay group was in a very tense atmosphere, especially in the direction of the state of veracru. Several consecutive orders for a thorough investigation were directed to the state of veracru.

The head of the bay group’s Northeast region, Manino, was in a terrible fix. He was in charge of all the operations in the Northeast region of Mexico, and his jurisdiction included the state of veracrus. Goodman was in charge of such a large drug trafficking Kingdom, so he naturally could not get to the bottom of it. He directly asked quachaquarkos or the state of veracrus, so all his anger was poured out on Manino.

On the other hand, Manino was also dumbfounded. It was just a small matter of stealing a warehouse of a shipping company. No one had reported it to him in advance, and there was no need to.

Manino hurriedly called the person in charge of the state of vilacrus, ERAD, and this time, he finally found the person in charge.

……

The ERAD were still in quachaquarkos, and they fled back to the Bay group’s branch in quachaquarkos like stray dogs.

ERAD was sitting in Madeline’s office. Madeline and ERAD’s bodyguard team leader, Juan, were standing in front of the desk in fear. They were in extreme despair. They felt that they had stirred up such a big mess this time and even caused ERAD to suffer great humiliation in front of the Chinese. They were definitely going to die.

ERAD’s face was as dark as water, and after a long while, he said fiercely,””Madeline, I’ll put this on the tab. If you make any mistakes next time! Let’s settle the Old and New scores together!”

Hearing this, it was as if medel had heard heavenly music. He was so excited that he almost cried.

“Yes!” He quickly replied. Mr. ERAD! Thank you for your forgiveness! From now on, I’m willing to be your most loyal servant, willing to risk my life for you! Going through fire and water!”

ERAD waved his hand impatiently. He wasn’t in the mood to listen to Madel’s loyalty.

In fact, ERAD wanted to tear medel into pieces. If it wasn’t for medel’s urging, how could he have stepped into today’s muddy water? In terms of hatred, ERAD’s hatred for Madeline was probably second only to Xia ruofei ‘s.

However, he had no choice but to let Madeline stay.

The reason was simple. He didn’t want to wait a moment longer. The flames of revenge were about to burn him to ashes! In kuachakuros, the armed forces of the Bay group were all under the control of Madel. Although in theory, he also had the power to command the armed personnel here, Madel had been in kuachakuros for many years and had planted many confidants under him. If he really killed Madel, the armed personnel under him might riot. Even if he could barely suppress it, he could not expect to command the people here.

ERAD didn’t want to mobilize people from other places in the state of vilacrus. He couldn’t wait for even a second. He wanted to send people to flatten Huafeng shipping now!

Therefore, in a fit of rage, ERAD still chose a temporary solution, which was to spare Madeline’s life.

After he had taken his revenge, he would take Madeline’s life.

“Yes,” ERAD said.”Madel, whether you can atone for your crime and make a contribution will depend on your performance next!”

Madeline was not a fool, and he naturally knew what ERAD wanted to do. He quickly puffed out his chest and said,””Mr. ERAD, I’ll immediately mobilize all the armed personnel of kuachaquarkos to blow up that Huafeng shipping company!”

ERAD gritted his teeth and said,”first, send people to surround this company!” Then, he would directly use the rocket to blow it up! I don’t want this company to have a complete building and a living creature after our attack!”

According to ERAD’s temperament, he hoped to arrest everyone in Huafeng shipping company and use all the means of torture to let them die in extreme pain. Only then could the hatred in his heart be slightly alleviated.

However, he was frightened by the individual combat power of Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng. He was worried that if the armed men attacked, it would be a suicide mission. So, he chose the safest plan, which was to surround the shipping company and bombard it with heavy firepower.

ERAD felt that no matter how powerful the two Chinese were, could they withstand the power of the rocket explosion? As long as there was enough firepower, it would be difficult to find even a complete brick in the entire shipping company. Both of them were made of flesh and blood. How could they survive an attack of this level?

Although the thrill of revenge would be greatly reduced in this way, at least he could kill them, and his biggest goal would be achieved.

In order to achieve this goal, ERAD didn’t want to cause any trouble. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Understood!” Madeline quickly replied. Mr. ERAD, I’ll personally lead the team over!”

“Go!” ERAD said with a dark face,”I’ll wait for your news here!”

After Madeline left the office, ERAD turned his gaze to the uneasy bodyguard Captain, Juan.

“Hu an, you don’t need me to say anything else, right?” ERAD said indifferently.

Hu an’s body trembled slightly, and he said with a complicated expression,””Mr. ERAD, I’ll take action personally. I guarantee that no one will be left behind!”

ERAD nodded his head lightly and said,””Go! After you’re done, come back and report to me!”

“Yes!” Juan bowed slightly to ERAD, turned around, and left the office.

His mission was to get rid of the bodyguards who had come with ERAD to kuachakuros. These people did not play any role. Instead, they saw the worst side of ERAD kowtowing to the Chinese people and begging for mercy. Naturally, ERAD would not keep them.

Juan was also very clear that it did not mean that he was safe just because ERAD had asked him to carry out this mission.

Although Juan had followed ERAD for many years and had even taken a bullet for him when ERAD was being shot, ERAD was a cold person by nature, and it was still uncertain whether he would let Juan live.

However, Juan didn’t dare to take the opportunity to escape because he knew ERAD too well. If he took this opportunity to escape, he would face ERAD’s endless pursuit even if he ran to the end of the world. With the strength of the Bay group, the possibility of him escaping was too small.

Furthermore, he still had his family to worry about. If he dared to run, his family would definitely end up in a very miserable state.

Therefore, Hu an’s only choice was to listen to his orders and gamble that he still had a certain value to ERAD, so that ERAD would let him go.

After dispatching Madeline and Juan, ERAD let out a long sigh of relief and leaned back in his chair to rest.

The throbbing pain in his knees and the burning sensation on his face were a constant reminder of the humiliation he had suffered today, making him unable to calm down for a moment.

ERAD only closed his eyes to rest for a short while, then immediately picked up his phone again. He couldn’t wait to know how Madeline’s operation was going.

However, before he could find Madeline’s number, another call came in.

ERAD looked at the caller ID and saw that it was his boss, the person in charge of the Bay group’s northeast area, Monino. He quickly picked up the call.”Mr. Manino!”

“ERAD! Your men had a conflict with a Chinese company in kuachakuros?” Manino asked urgently.

ERAD was slightly stunned. He didn’t expect Manino to be so well – informed. His visit to Huafeng shipping today was just a spur of the moment idea. It was not a big deal, so there was no need to report to Manino. After he had returned in defeat, his mind was filled with thoughts of revenge. He wanted revenge as soon as possible, so even though he had mobilized almost all the armed personnel on kuachakurakos ‘side to do something big, he had not had the time to report to Manino.

But ERAD didn’t expect that Manino would take the initiative to call and ask about this.

...

ERAD’s first reaction was that Manino had planted spies around him. This was a common practice. He would also place people in his subordinate organizations in order to better control and command them. However, what made him wary was that he didn’t notice it at all.

While ERAD was thinking that he would have to investigate this matter thoroughly after this matter was over, he said,””Mr. Manino, I was just about to report to you! This Chinese company is too arrogant. I went to deal with it personally, but I was beaten up by them! Now, only explosions and blood can declare the authority of the Bay group! I’ve already asked the person in charge of kuachakuros, Madel, to gather the armed men and teach those damned Chinese a lesson that will leave a deep impression! Mr. Manino, don’t worry, Bay group’s dignity will not be trampled on by anyone!”

After Manino heard this, he was so scared that he almost dropped his phone. Hot blood rushed to his head, and he could not help but curse ...
