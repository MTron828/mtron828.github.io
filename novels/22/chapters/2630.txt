2631 Returning to the Hunter Valley (1)

Xia ruofei thought for a while and happily accepted the invitation. Qianqian was a friend who had experienced a life – and – Death landing with him. Xia ruofei was also very willing to share this happy moment with Captain Brook. Besides, everyone knew about the forced flight. Qstrang airlines was already preparing for a movie. Xia ruofei had a lot of exposure during that period, so there was no need for him to keep a low profile at this time.

Hence, Xia ruofei followed Captain Brook and Molly to the welcoming crowd.

The Senior Vice President of qishang, Tony, also attended the event personally. There were also people in charge of the public relations department of qishang and the A350 fleet. When they realized that the person who had been watching from afar was actually Xia ruofei, they were all very surprised.

When he was dealing with the incident, Xia ruofei had interacted with all of them. With his extraordinary memory, he could not forget them. He could even call out their names proficiently, which made everyone feel closer to him.

Xia ruofei naturally stood with Tony and the rest. Brook walked to the side and faced the media with a smile.

Of the two pilots flying with Captain Brook, other than the co – Pilot, the other was an inspector of a very high rank. The inspectors were in charge of the captain’s assessment. The assessment flight when the co – Pilot was promoted to Captain or when the captain’s flying qualifications were restored was the responsibility of the inspectors.

The inspector said with a smile,””Captain Brook’s performance in the flight assessment was perfect. I’m very honored to announce that he will be reinstated as the captain of the Airbus A350 from today onwards!”

Although Brook had already completed two flights, strictly speaking, this flight was an assessment flight. Only by passing the assessment could he regain his qualifications to fly the Airbus A350. In other words, it was not until the inspector’s announcement that Captain Brook had truly recovered physically and mentally and was back in his flight position.

The moment the inspector finished speaking, a round of applause broke out. Tony and the other executives also came forward to congratulate him. Captain Brook was all smiles as he expressed his gratitude.

The media reporters all reached out to Captain Brook and asked him how he felt at the moment.

As the person who experienced the most thrilling forced landing in the history of QSO, Captain Brook had always received a high level of attention from the media. For his assessment flight, QSO had informed reporters from major media in advance to come to the tarmac for interviews.

Brook laughed and pulled Xia ruofei over.””Before I answer your questions, I would like to let you all meet someone!”

“Wow!”

“God! Are my eyes playing tricks on me?”

“It’s Mr. Xia!”

The media reporters exclaimed in surprise.

To be fair, the public opinion in Australia was not particularly friendly to China. The arrogance and prejudice of some Western White people were particularly obvious here. These local media usually carried out some misleading reports about China with colored glasses.

However, Xia ruofei was definitely an exception. Almost all the Australians had a good impression of him. In the Western society that advocated individual heroism, very few people would have a bad impression of such a heroic figure. Even the Australian athletes, who were extremely hostile to China, could only suppress their dissatisfaction and praise Xia ruofei when they talked about him.

There was no doubt that Xia ruofei was also the darling of the media in Australia. In fact, he was even more popular than Captain Brook. Everyone knew that even though the epic forced surrender was not without captain Brook’s technical guidance, Xia ruofei had at least 80% of the credit.

After that incident, there were also experts who had carried out countless re – examine. Some people even found volunteers to carry out experiments.

The test was simple. Didn’t Xia ruofei claim that he had received simple helicopter flight training? Hence, they found a pilot who had just started to fly solo and had no knowledge of fixed – Wing aircraft to simulate Xia ruofei’s role. Then, they found an experienced A350 Captain who was as knowledgeable as Captain Brook and entered the flight parameters into the simulator. The experienced captain did not participate in the flight control throughout the entire process and only gave technical guidance. The entire process was operated by the pilot.

The results of the experiment were brutal. After 20 to 30 attempts, the helicopter pilot student had no successful landing.

There was only one time when the plane landed awkwardly on the runway, and the landing gear was broken when it landed. If it had been the real situation on that day, even if there were no other planes on the runway, such a landing was likely to cause the plane to disintegrate.

Moreover, in reality, the wind was howling in the plane. Such an environment could not be simulated at all. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

After the results of the experiment were announced, it further emphasized how great and unbelievable Xia ruofei’s feat of forcing the plane to land was.

“Ladies and gentlemen,” said Captain Brook with a smile,”I also want to tell you that considering that Mr. Xia is thousands of miles away, I did not inform him of this assessment flight. Our two planes landed in Sydney almost at the same time today. It was a complete coincidence. That’s why I said ... This is all God’s arrangement. “
