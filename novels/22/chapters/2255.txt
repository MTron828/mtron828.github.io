“President Xia, I’ll just eat a little outside.” Wu Qiang said as he walked.

“Let’s come over together!” Xia ruofei said,”the other party must have arranged a driver’s meal in advance.”

Xia ruofei knew that Wu Qiang was not good with words and did not like social events, so he did not intend to let him attend the banquet.

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Wu Qiang did not say anything more and quickly followed.

Walking through the wide and bright gate of the private kitchen of the Wang family, Xia ruofei was about to find a greeter to ask for the location of ya Qing’s private room when he was surprised to find that Gao Jun was already waiting there in advance.

Standing beside him were Hou Liang and two other women who looked extremely capable.

Unlike hotels, private restaurants didn’t have a lobby. In fact, there was a Hall separated by a well. Hou Liang, Gao Jun, and the others were all standing there waiting. Seeing this, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but speed up.

Gao Jun and the others naturally saw Xia ruofei and the others at a glance and also quickly walked up to them.

“President Xia!”

“Brother Xia!”

The two of them greeted him at the same time.

Xia ruofei took two steps forward and said,””I’m sorry, there was a traffic jam on the road. I’ve been waiting for a long time ...”

“We’ve only just arrived. ” Gao Jun said with a smile. There was a hint of excitement and gratitude in his eyes. It was obvious that Hou Liang’s arrival was a great surprise to him.

Qin Yanan and he Yu also came forward to greet him. They should also know the two women next to Gao Jun, so they quickly smiled and exchanged greetings.

Gao Jun introduced,”President Xia, this is Huang Yajuan. She’s the Executive Director of this season’s life you yearn for. The one beside her is her Executive Director, Luo Xue.”

Xia ruofei felt that the two ladies looked familiar. He must have met them before in the festival Group.

The filming of life’s yearning was different from that of movies and television series. It was even different from most reality shows. The staff would do their best not to disturb the guests ‘natural performance and would not re – shoot after they shouted’ cut ‘. This was because there were no NGS in this kind of show. They would record the entire process and then post – Edit it. Therefore, the director’s presence was not that strong during the filming process. Xia ruofei only felt that the two of them looked familiar.

In fact, what he saw was mostly the director and the cameraman. Huang Yajuan and Luo Xue spent most of their time in the attached building and would not be watching the recording scene all the time.

This was also the reason why they could still come out to socialize today.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”so you’re the female hero under the high platform!” Director Huang! Director Luo! Nice to meet you!”

“I’m flattered. You can just call me Huang, President Xia!”Huang Yajuan quickly said.

Hou Liang also came forward to greet him with a smile. Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Monkey, you’re early!”

“Brother Xia, I wouldn’t dare to be late if you summoned me!” “Of course.” Hou Liang smiled and said,”although we’re hosting on a high platform today, I’ll have to offer you a few cups of wine later!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””There’s nothing to do today. Everyone, drink a little! By the way, Xiao Rui isn’t here yet?”

“Brother Rui will also be coming?” Hou Liang asked in surprise.

It was obvious that song Rui and Li Xiao si had not arrived yet. Otherwise, Hou Liang would not have asked such a question.

“I knew this kid was unreliable!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”let’s not wait for him. Let’s go to the private room first!”

Gao Jun, who was at the side, had already thought about it. If even Hou Liang had to call him “brother,” it meant that the friend that Xia ruofei had invited was not an ordinary person. Although he had the honor of having a meal with song Rui once, they were not familiar with each other. Naturally, he could not guess that the person who would be attending the banquet was song Rui from the few words between the two.

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Gao Jun quickly said,””President Xia, why don’t you ... Go to the private room and rest while I wait here?”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand,”no need!” High platform, let’s go to the private room to sit for a while, or we can eat first! That guy has always been unreliable. Who knows if he’ll stand me up!”

Gao Jun was in a difficult position. He was afraid of offending that “brother Rui,” so he couldn’t help but look at Hou Liang for help.

“Gao tai, let’s just listen to brother Xia!” Hou Liang said with a smile.

Hou Liang knew about Xia ruofei’s relationship with song Rui, so he naturally had to listen to Xia ruofei’s opinion.

“Alright! Alright!” Gao Jun quickly said,”President Xia, young master hou, assistant Qin, assistant he, this way please!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”Oh!” By the way, Gaotai, my pilot hasn’t had his dinner yet. Please arrange something for him to eat!”

“Alright!” Gao Jun quickly responded and then said to Luo Xue,”Xiao Luo, go and make the arrangements immediately!”

“Alright, high platform!” “Yes, master!” Luo Xue hurriedly replied. She then smiled at Wu Qiang and said,”master, please follow me!”

Xia ruofei nodded at Wu Qiang and asked him to follow Luo Xue. Then, he brought Qin Yanan, he Yu, Gao Jun, and the others through the hall to the next courtyard, to ya Qing’s private room.

This private room was not the largest among the private dishes in the Wang Residence, but the environment was quite elegant.

After entering the private room, the group of people took their seats by the antique coffee table. The waitress in the cheongsam began to make tea for everyone.

The faint sound of guzheng and the faint smell of sandalwood in the room, as well as the smell of tea, made people feel a lot more relaxed.

Xia ruofei nodded slightly at Qin Yanan, and the latter immediately took out Xia ruofei’s bag of tea and walked to Gao Jun. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Xia ruofei smiled.”Director Gao, this is a small token of my appreciation. I hope you won’t mind!”

Gao Jun stood up, feeling a little flattered. He took the tea leaves from Qin Yanan’s hands with both hands and said,””President Xia, how can I accept this? You’ve helped me so much, why are you still giving me a gift? We should be the ones ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and interrupted Gao Jun. He smiled and said,””Director Gao, let’s cut the formalities. Some homemade tea leaves aren’t considered an expensive gift. It’s just a small token of my appreciation.”

“Then I’ll be impolite to refuse!” Gao Jun happily took the tea leaves and said,”the peach garden’s Da Hong Pao is famous all over the world. I’m finally lucky to have a taste! Thank you, President Xia!”

In fact, with Gao Jun’s status, it was not a problem for him to buy a few catties of Taoyuan Dahongpao. Besides, Xia ruofei had sponsored a lot of tea leaves to the festival Group this time. As the Deputy Director, it was easy for Gao Jun to get some for himself to taste.

Of course, Gao Jun didn’t know that the tea leaves given by Xia ruofei were completely incomparable to the peach blossom Da Hong Pao that was sold in bulk.

Everyone sat down to make tea and chat, the atmosphere was very harmonious.

After a while, Xia ruofei raised his hand to look at his watch. It was already 6:40. He said,””Director Gao, my friend is already ten minutes late. Let’s not wait any longer and eat first!”

“This ... Isn’t very good, is it?” Gao Jun hesitated for a moment before saying,”it’s still early anyway. Why don’t we ... Wait a little longer?”

“Eating while waiting, that’s not considered cruel.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I had an appointment with him at 6:30 pm. It’s already past 6:30 pm. Director Gao, please tell the waiter to serve the dishes first! It doesn’t matter if we’re men, but it won’t be good if the ladies are hungry ...”

Gao Jun turned his gaze to Hou Liang, only to see Hou Liang slightly nodding his head. Thus, he didn’t think too much about it and just nodded his head, saying,”Alright then, let’s get to the table!”

Then, he ordered the waiter to pour the wine and serve the dishes while he led Xia ruofei and the others to the Round Table.

At this moment, there was a soft knock on the door of the private room. A waitress in a cheongsam gently pushed the door open. Then, everyone saw song Rui walking in with a young man in his mid -20s.
