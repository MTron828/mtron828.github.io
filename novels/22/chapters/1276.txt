Chapter 1277: Miracle (2)

Translator: 549690339

On the morning of the third day, Xia ruofei walked out of the room and said to the staff who was waiting in the corridor,””Please ask director Guo to come over.”

“Okay, please wait a moment, Mr. Xia!” The staff member quickly said respectfully.

After a while, Xia ruofei heard a knock on the door.

“Please enter!” Xia ruofei said loudly.

The room door was pushed open and Guo Hongjiang walked in.””Mr. Xia, you were looking for me ...”

He was stuck in the middle of his sentence because he saw the “star of Hong Kong” standing in the middle of the room. He was not tied to the shelf at all.

Guo Hongjiang could not help but be surprised and happy. At the same time, he was a little worried, so much so that he subconsciously lowered his voice.

“Mr. Xia ... This ... The star of Hong Kong can be used in the real world?” Guo Hongjiang asked in surprise.

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile.”According to my judgment, the star of Hong Kong’s injuries have basically been cured. As long as he doesn’t do any strenuous exercise, it won’t be a big problem ...”

In fact, the star of Hong Kong had not only recovered, but it was even better than before it was injured.

The dense spiritual energy in the spirit map space wasn’t just for show, not to mention that it had absorbed an entire petal of the spirit Heart Flower. In addition, it had also used a lot of the ointment for bruises and injuries passed down from the ancient recipe.

Xia ruofei had no doubt that if the “star of Hong Kong” were to participate in the race and the opponents were the same as that night, he would beat them without a doubt. He would have an obvious lead.

However, in order not to scare Guo Hongjiang, Xia ruofei still chose a relatively conservative way of speaking.

But even so, Guo Hongjiang was still deeply shocked.

In three days, the serious fracture injury was basically healed.

For hundreds of years, the problem of treatment for the fracture of a horse’s leg in horse racing had not been solved. Even in today’s medical era, the treatment for the fracture of a horse’s leg could only be euthanized helplessly.

However, Xia ruofei only used Chinese medicine to make some ointment and cured her fracture in three days. She was like the reincarnation of the Chinese!

Although bianque and Hua Tuo might not know how to treat horses, Guo Hongjiang could not think of any other words to describe Xia ruofei’s medical skills.

“Mr. Xia, I really don’t know what to say ...” The star of Hong Kong “is my favorite horse race!” To be honest, tens of millions of Hong Kong dollars is nothing to me, but that kind of feeling is irreplaceable ...”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Director Guo, I understand. I invited you here today to bid you farewell.”

Guo Hongjiang was stunned for a moment and quickly said,””Mr. Xia is leaving? This ... The ‘star of Hong Kong’ hasn’t fully recovered, right? You ... Do you have any urgent matters in the mainland?”

“That’s not it ...”

“Then, can you please continue to treat the star of Hong Kong?” Guo Hongjiang did not wait for Xia ruofei to finish his sentence and said hurriedly,”Mr. Xia, although I know you don’t lack money, but ... But I can pay a high fee, as long as you are willing to stay and help the ‘star of Hong Kong’ recover ...”

“Director Guo, can you let me finish?” Xia ruofei forced a smile.

“I’m sorry, you say, you say ...” Guo Hongjiang also knew that he had lost his composure and quickly said with some embarrassment.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Director Guo, I’m leaving not because I want to quit halfway. I just feel that I’ve completed all my work. I don’t have to be here to do the rest.”

Xia ruofei took a sip of water and said,””The ‘star of Hong Kong’ is in good condition now and can undergo some low – intensity recovery training. I’ll also keep some of the ointment and apply it every night.”

“But ... I’m worried that there will be an accident ...” Guo Hongjiang said.

Xia ruofei smiled.”I’ve said it before. I won’t do anything that I’m not confident in. So don’t worry. There won’t be any accidents!”

“This ...” Guo Hongjiang hesitated for a long time before he said,”alright then! Since Mr. Xia insists on leaving, I can’t force you to stay. However ... If there’s anything that you can’t handle here, I hope Mr. Xia won’t hesitate to lend a hand ...”

“No problem! If anything happens, I’ll fly to Hong Kong immediately. ” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Thank you! Thank you!” Guo Hongjiang expressed his gratitude sincerely.

“Right, there are a few more things.” Xia ruofei said,”regarding the ‘star of Hong Kong’, I hope that director Guo can keep his knowledge to himself. I believe that Mr. MA has told you that I’m a person who doesn’t like trouble.”

“Don’t worry, Mr. Xia. I’ll be careful even if you don’t tell me.” Guo Hongjiang said with a smile.

“Well, and ... For the next step of rehabilitation training, try to minimize the scope of knowledge as much as possible. It’s best to arrange for one or two trustworthy people to be in charge.” Xia ruofei said,”the time for the rehabilitation training can be extended as much as possible. This way, the recovery period will not be so shocking.”

“No problem!” Guo Hongjiang said without hesitation.

Then, he asked in a low voice,””Mr. Xia, so ... The star of Hong Kong’s recovery is much better than I thought?”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, and then he couldn’t help but smile bitterly.

Guo Hongjiang was indeed a powerful figure in the treacherous business world. He had only been a little negligent, but he had immediately grasped the key information.

“You can say that!” Xia ruofei didn’t hide anything and said directly,”director Guo,’star of Hong Kong’ is a very good horse. It’s born with good conditions, so it’s normal for it to recover faster. So ... Please give an order to not X – ray it for a month,”

A look of surprise flashed in Guo Hongjiang’s eyes. He quickly said,””I understand! Don’t worry, Mr. Xia, I’ll make the necessary arrangements and minimize the impact. ” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“That’s good. ” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Guo Hongjiang looked at the quiet “star of Hong Kong” and felt that this horse seemed to be different from before.

There was almost no change in his appearance, but he gave Guo Hongjiang the feeling that he had been reborn.

His curiosity grew, and he couldn’t help but ask in a low voice,””Mr. Xia, can you let me see the real state of the ‘star of Hong Kong’? This way, I’ll have a better idea of what to do. ”

Xia ruofei saw Guo Hongjiang’s expression and knew that he couldn’t refuse. After all, the “star of Hong Kong” was Guo Hongjiang’s horse. After he left, Guo Hongjiang would definitely try it.

At that time, even more people might see it.

Rather than that, it would be better to tell Guo Hongjiang directly. Even if it was shocking, it was only Guo Hongjiang.

Xia ruofei believed that after Guo Hongjiang had seen his true strength, he would definitely not announce it to the world.

Guo Hongjiang would definitely try his best to be on good terms with a miracle doctor like Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei was not willing to make it public, so Guo Hongjiang was most likely hoping for it. If the whole world knew about miracle doctor Xia, it would not be easy to ask him for help with any health problems.

These thoughts flashed through Xia ruofei’s mind. He nodded and said,””Then let’s go to the training ground! But ...”

“Don’t worry, Mr. Xia. I’ll clear the area now!” Guo Hongjiang immediately said,”all personnel are to take half a day off and let them leave the training base. Leave a few bodyguards here to guard the periphery. Don’t let them enter the training ground!”

It was easy to talk to smart people. Xia ruofei did not even need to finish his sentence. Guo Hongjiang immediately understood his intention.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. Guo Hongjiang immediately went to make the arrangements.

......

Half an hour later.

Guo Hongjiang was dumbfounded as he stood at the side of the training ground. Xia ruofei, who was dressed in a Knight’s uniform, passed the horsewhip to his left hand and jumped off the horse. He led the “star of Hong Kong” towards Guo Hongjiang.

Guo Hongjiang was still in a petrified state. His mouth was so wide open that an egg could almost be stuffed in.

The scene that he had just seen had completely stunned Guo Hongjiang. Now, he only had one thought in his mind: Am I dreaming?
