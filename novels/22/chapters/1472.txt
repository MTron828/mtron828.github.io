Chapter 1473: It’s difficult for an honest official to resolve family affairs (1)

Translator: 549690339

Although Xia ruofei and Song Wei were unhappy, they could not act out since Xu Yuanyuan herself did not say anything.

On the other side, Zhuang Yan’s heart still ached for his wife. Seeing that his sister-in-law’s words were so unpleasant, he couldn’t help but say,”Sister – in – Law, the leader hasn’t arrived yet, right? Yuanyuan is not in good health and needs to rest after standing for a long time. It’s okay to sit for a while, right?”

The young woman looked at Zhuang Yan and said,”Little Yan, you’ve really grown up with a wife! You’ve all learned how to talk back?”

Zhuang Yan had always been an honest man. Hearing his sister-in-law’s words, his face turned red and he couldn’t say anything for a while.

Xu Yuan Yuan’s eyes turned red. The young woman’s words were insinuating that she had led Zhuang Yan astray. It was really uncomfortable to hear that.

However, Xu Yuanyuan obviously didn’t want to put Zhuang Yan in a difficult position, so even though she felt very wronged, she still stood up and walked to Zhuang Yan’s side. She gently tugged on his sleeve, indicating for him to stop arguing.

“Sister – in – Law, it’s our fault. Please don’t stoop to Zhuang Yan’s level ...” Xu Yuanyuan said to the young woman.

The young woman snorted and glanced at Zhuang Yan. Then, she said,”Yuanyuan, I’m not criticizing you, but if you don’t care about your own matters, how can others help you?”

“Yes, sorry to trouble you, sister – in – Law ...” Xu Yuanyuan said.

“Just wait here!” The young woman pursed her lips and said,”Zhuang Cheng has already picked up chief Jiang and is on his way!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“I know ...” Xu Yuanyuan said in a low voice.

Xia ruofei and Song Wei looked at Xu Yuanyuan’s thin back and couldn’t help but sympathize with her.

Xu Yuanyuan and Zhuang Yan were standing not far behind the young woman. From their position, they could see the revolving door of the hotel entrance. If the leader they were waiting for arrived, they would be the first to notice.

Song Wei took a few glances and whispered to Xia ruofei,””I’ll go over and ask about the situation!”

“Okay, let’s go together!” Xia ruofei nodded.

The two of them stood up and walked to Xu Yuan Yuan. Song Wei pulled on Xu Yuan Yuan’s clothes and brought her to a corner. She asked her in a low voice.

The young woman turned her head and glanced coldly at Xu Yuan Yuan. Seeing that Xu Yuan Yuan had not gone too far, she did not say anything, only frowning slightly before turning back and standing there, looking forward to seeing what was happening.

Although Xia ruofei did not approach them, his hearing was much better than the average person ‘s, so he could still hear the conversation between Song Wei and Xu Yuan Yuan.

This was Xu Yuanyuan’s family matter and Song Wei didn’t want to gossip about it. But now that Xu Yuanyuan was obviously wronged, Song Wei couldn’t ignore it as her college classmate.

At first, Yuanyuan did not want to tell Xia ruofei but after Song Wei’s persistent questioning, she told Xia ruofei the whole story. Xia ruofei had a general understanding of the situation.

It turned out that when Xu Yuanyuan graduated last year, the reason why she didn’t choose to study for a master’s degree or stay in Beijing for a job was mainly because of her family.

Her mother’s health wasn’t very good and she had retired from the hospital to recuperate. Her father was very busy at work and often needed to work the night shift, so the two elders hoped that she could return to her hometown to work so that she could take care of her family.

Moreover, in the opinion of the elderly, a stable job was more important than anything else for a girl. Instead of staying in the competitive capital to work, it was better to go home and live a stable life. It would be even better if she could marry a good husband.

In fact, what happened next was exactly what the old man had hoped for.

After Xu Yuanyuan and Zhuang Yan met and fell in love at work, their relationship heated up rapidly. After a few months of dating, they couldn’t wait to walk into the hall of marriage.

Zhuang Yan knew that Xu Yuan Yuan was not willing to waste her life in a government office like the cultural relics Bureau. Moreover, Xu Yuan Yuan had just graduated and her Foundation was still there, so he was very supportive of her applying for a graduate student at Capital University.

Xu Yuanyuan’s grades in University were very good. If she systematically revised for a period of time, the probability of getting in was still very high.

Zhuang Yan even took on the responsibility of taking care of the old man. He said that as long as Xu Yuan Yuan got in, he would take care of the family and she didn’t need to worry about it.

Xu Yuan Yuan’s last bit of worry was dispelled, and her desire to continue her studies grew stronger and stronger.

However, she was now a part of the system. She couldn’t take the postgraduate entrance examination just because she wanted to. She still needed the approval of the unit.

Of course, Xu Yuanyuan could also resign from her position and do her best to take the postgraduate entrance examination, but her parents didn’t agree. They felt that it was too risky.

Moreover, they didn’t want Xu Yuanyuan to lose her position.

If Yuan Yuan wanted to go back to her alma mater, the only way was to keep her position at the cultural relics Bureau and go to graduate school in the name of sending her to school. Of course, she would also have to come back to work after graduation.

Xu Yuanyuan naturally didn’t want to go back to the cultural relics Bureau, but she had to take things one step at a time. She had to get into her master’s degree first and go back to study. As for the things after her master’s degree, she could consider them a few years later.

Therefore, the problem went back to the far end. There were many people who wanted to go out to further their studies every year. Xu Yuanyuan’s qualifications were very shallow, and she had worked for less than a year. In such a situation, the unit would not approve it at all.

Therefore, he could only hope that the leader would show mercy.

That was why they had this dinner today.

The young woman’s name was Yao na, and she was the wife of Zhuang Yan’s brother, Zhuang Cheng. She and Zhuang Cheng both worked at the Tanzhou city’s Finance Bureau.
