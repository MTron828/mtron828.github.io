Chapter 1810: Uncle Xu is here (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”forget about the payment. I don’t think he’ll accept it ...”

“You’re not paying?” Feng Jing’s eyes widened in shock.”Chairman, this ... Isn’t very appropriate, right?”

Naturally, Xia ruofei could tell that Xu lang was trying to befriend him. If it was just a greeting from MA Xiong and the other Hong Kong tycoons, Xu lang would not have treated him so differently. However, Xia ruofei could not figure out the reason behind it.

However, at least Xia ruofei did not feel Xu Lang’s malice, so he did not waste his brain cells thinking about it.

No matter what, Xia ruofei had a feeling that if he paid Xu lang, he would most likely not accept it. Of course, Xu lang came all the way here and he could not let him come for nothing.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and came up with a plan. He smiled and said,””Don’t worry, I have my own arrangements! I won’t lose my manners!”

“Alright then!” Feng Rao shrugged.

As the three of them chatted, the dishes were already being served in the kitchen. The ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ that Feng Rao had been thinking about was also served.

Xia ruofei ordered four servings for Xie Bing, his chauffeur today. However, Ling Qingxue would be coming over soon. He thought for a while and said to the waiter,””Ask the kitchen to prepare another ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’. My driver is eating in the front yard. Send it to him.”

Xia ruofei originally wanted Xie Bing to come to the flying Snow Pavilion in the backyard for a meal, but Xie Bing kept rejecting him, so he could only ask for a small room in the front yard.

The waiter’s face twitched. He thought to himself,”this young master is really extravagant!” He even prepared the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup for the driver ...

One must know that this signature dish would usually be ordered at least half a month in advance. If it was during the peak period of the meal, such as a long holiday, it would be ordered even earlier.

Of course, the price was also very touching. The average working class would definitely not be able to afford it.

Not only did Xia ruofei have a Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup for everyone, but even the chauffeur who was accompanying him also had one. He was really rich.

However, the waiter only sighed in his heart and quickly replied,””Alright!”

After the waiter left, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Come on! Try this Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup!”

“Let’s just wait for Qingxue!” Feng ke said.

Xia ruofei smiled.”You’re welcome. She’s here to work. We don’t know when it’ll end.” Besides, we’re not outsiders ... Let’s eat first!”

“Alright!” Feng Rao nodded after some thought. Since the chairman has spoken, President Dong, let’s not be polite!”

“Thank you for your hospitality, Chairman!” Dong Yun said with a smile.

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.”It’s just a meal. You’ve all worked hard during this period of time. Take it as my reward!” By the way, do you want to drink some wine?”

“I need to focus on enjoying the food,” Feng Rao shook her head.”I’ll drink later!”

“Alright! As you wish!” Xia ruofei said.

The waiter came over to help them open the small jars. A rich fragrance immediately wafted out. Dong Yun, who was tasting the lingji’s Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup for the first time, couldn’t help but sniffle. Feng Jing couldn’t wait to taste it.

The waiter helped them scoop out the various ingredients from the jar, and the unique fragrance of the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup started to fill the room.

It had to be said that Xia ruofei’s Secret recipe was very effective in improving the taste of the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’. Girls were usually afraid of getting fat from eating greasy food, but Feng Rao and Dong Yun could not resist the temptation of the delicious ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ and ate it with relish.

In just a short while, they had already finished almost half of the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ in the small jar. The other dishes were almost untouched.

At that moment, the waiter knocked on the door, and everyone saw Ling Qingxue walk in.

“Qingxue, come over and sit!” Feng Rao immediately called out.

“Does the food here suit everyone’s taste?” Ling Qingxue asked with a smile.

“Just look at these two beauties” performance and you’ll know if they’re to your taste ...”Xia ruofei smiled.

Feng Rao was a little embarrassed and said,”Chairman, you seem to have eaten a lot too!” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”well, actually, I’m eating the same thing as CEO Feng ...”

Dong Yun couldn’t help but smile as well. It wasn’t a glorious thing to eat as much as a man like Xia ruofei!

Feng Rao’s face turned red, but Ling Qingxue came to her rescue. She rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,””President Feng, don’t pay attention to this guy. He just has a bad mouth ... He’ll come here often if he likes to eat it!”

Feng Rao nodded and said,”Ling Ji ‘s’ Buddha Jumps Over the Wall ‘is indeed a worldly delicacy. If the price is a little more affordable ... Forget it. I’ll just keep the price!” Otherwise, I’m worried that it won’t be long before I gain weight. It’s just right that I can’t afford to eat now ...”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but reveal a happy smile. This was equivalent to praising the deliciousness of Ling Ji’s private kitchen.

She then looked at Xia ruofei. Everything was clear without words. The ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ recipe was provided by Xia ruofei for free.

Opening a private restaurant was Ling Ji’s first attempt to develop into a high – end restaurant. The success of this attempt had a very important relationship with the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ formula that Xia ruofei had provided.

After Ling Qingxue sat down, she asked the waiter to bring a bottle of red wine over. Everyone drank one or two glasses.
