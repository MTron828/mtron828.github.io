Chapter 735: The “conspiracy” has succeeded (2)

Hu Zi’s mother also looked relieved. Although her family was poor and she didn’t go to school, she had always paid great attention to the education of her children. Therefore, both Lin Hu and Lin Qiao were very kind.

Xia ruofei acted as if he didn’t hear her. He continued to smile and said,””Qiao’ er, I remember when you first transferred to No. 8 high school, I told you that if you did well in the college entrance examination, I would give you a big surprise ...”

“I remember!” Lin Qiao immediately said,”brother ruofei, those phones and computers that you gave me a few days ago, aren’t they big surprises? It solved all the digital equipment problems I had in college in one go, and all of them are luxurious!”

Xia ruofei glared at Lin Qiao and said,”I haven’t finished yet! Don’t interrupt!”

Lin Qiao stuck out her tongue mischievously.

Xia ruofei continued,”those small prizes aren’t a surprise. They’re just small gifts.” Auntie, Qiao’ er, the surprise I’m talking about is this house ...”

“No! RUO Fei, you can’t do this!” Hu Zi’s mother finally said what she wanted to say. She did not let Xia ruofei interrupt her again.”This is a house worth millions. We can’t take it no matter what!”

This time, Lin Qiao also stood firmly on her mother’s side and said,””Yes! Brother ruofei, we appreciate your kindness. But I don’t want to be a person who doesn’t work for anything. I believe that in the future, I will be able to use my own hands to let mom live a good life. ”

Xia ruofei had already anticipated their reaction, so he was still smiling.

He said,”Qiao’ er, there’s no conflict!” With this house, you still need to work hard to change your life and your destiny. ”

Lin Qiao opened her mouth, but Xia ruofei didn’t wait for her to speak and continued,””The most important thing is that I’ve already bought this house under your name! And in full! The money has been paid!”

After Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao heard this, they couldn’t help but be stunned. The house suddenly became very quiet. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Xia ruofei smiled proudly and said,””What do you think I took your ID card for that day? I knew you wouldn’t accept it, so I had to act first and report later!”

......

Hu ‘Zi’s mother frowned slightly and asked,””Qiao’ er, did you really give your id to brother ruofei?”

“I ... I didn’t know that brother ruofei would use it to buy a house ...” Lin Qiao said dejectedly.

Hu Zi’s mother looked at Xia ruofei, feeling both angry and amused. She said,””Ruofei, we can’t take this house. You can either keep it for yourself or return it!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”I knew you’d say that. That’s why I’ve invited President Liang of the jianda group.”

After he finished speaking, Xia ruofei smiled and gave Liang Weimin a look.

Liang Weimin knew it was time for him to step up, so he cleared his throat and said, “I’m sorry! We don’t give refunds once our houses are sold. Mr. Xia has already paid 2.44 million Yuan for the house, so it is now an asset under Lin Qiao’s name. ”

Hu ‘Zi’s mother said,”this ... This can’t be right, right?” Don’t you need to sign the real estate certificate? Qiao’ er only gave her identification card to RUO Fei, and she was able to get the house under her name?”

“The real estate certificate is already in the process of being processed. It does need Lin Qiao’s signature,” Liang Weimin said.

“Then why don’t you just get the real estate certificate under brother ruofei’s name?” Lin Qiao quickly said.

Liang Weimin smiled and said,”I’m sorry!” This house was bought in your name, and the house purchase invoice we issued also has your name on it, so the property ownership certificate can only have your name on it. If it is inconsistent with the house purchase invoice, the Housing Authority will not allow it. ”

Lin Qiao was dumbfounded.”This can’t do, that can’t do. Brother ruofei’s way of doing things is really ... Watertight!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Auntie, Qiao’ er, I was worried that you wouldn’t accept it. That’s why I did everything behind your back. This time, you can’t reject me, can you?”

Hu Zi’s mother thought for a moment and said,”ruofei, we really can’t accept this.” Since Qiao’ er’s name must be written on the property ownership certificate, then we’ll do it first. After we’re done, we’ll transfer the ownership to you. That should be fine, right?”

Xia ruofei revealed a troubled expression and said,””You can, but the transfer fee isn’t low! Also, the transfer of a house less than five years old will have a very high transaction tax!”

When Liang Weimin heard this, he immediately took out his phone and pulled out a calculator. As he calculated, he said,””I’ll give you a rough calculation! In your case, you can only transfer the ownership as a second – hand house. The property area of this house is 126 square meters, and the unit price is 20000 Yuan! “The surrounding houses are already worth more than 30000 Yuan. 20000 Yuan is already very low ... If we calculate it at 20000 Yuan, the total price will be 2.44 million Yuan. Moreover, this is not an ordinary house and it has not been five years, so we can’t enjoy the tax reduction ...”

Liang Weimin said as he entered some data into his phone’s calculator. In the end, he said, “I’ve calculated it! In this case, the contract tax is 73200 Yuan, business tax is 136640 Yuan, and personal income tax is 24400 Yuan. Not including other small expenses, the three items alone will cost you 234240 Yuan!”

Hu Zi’s mother couldn’t help but gasp when she heard this. After a long while, she said,””Just ... Just changing the name of the property ownership certificate ... It ... It costs 230000 Yuan?”
