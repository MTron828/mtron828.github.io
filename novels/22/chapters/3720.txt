The next morning, Xia ruofei, Song Wei, and Ling Qingxue had breakfast together. After they cleaned up, they went straight to the rooftop.

To Xia ruofei’s surprise, Li Yifu was already waiting on the rooftop.

The wind on the island was very strong, and Li Yifu’s white beard was ruffled by the wind. However, he still didn’t move, and it seemed that he had been waiting for a long time.

“Greetings, martial granduncle! Greetings to the two martial grandmother!” Li Yifu quickly greeted the three of them respectfully.

Xia ruofei frowned and said,”adopted husband, Didn’t I tell you yesterday that I don’t need you to send me?” Why are you still here?”

“Martial granduncle is going on a journey, how can this disciple not send you off? This is unreasonable!” Li Yifu lowered his head and said.

Xia ruofei did not know whether to be angry or to laugh. Seeing Li Yifu’s expression, he was slightly touched. His tone softened and he asked,””How long have you been up here?”

“This disciple didn’t know when martial granduncle would leave, so I was cultivating on this balcony last night.” Li Yifu said respectfully.

“You …” Xia ruofei pointed at Li Yifu with a helpless expression.

However, Xia ruofei did not know what to say to him. In the end, he could only smile bitterly and say,””Alright… You’re too kind …”

No matter what he said, he would not listen. He promised but still did things his way. Xia ruofei could not do anything about it. He could not really punish Li Yifu for such a thing.

As the saying goes, one shouldn’t blame others for being too polite!

“Wei Wei, Qingxue, let’s go!” Xia ruofei said.

With that said, he casually took out the black Phoenix flying ship.

The flying boat quickly enlarged and then quietly hovered above the rooftop.

Xia ruofei and the other two jumped onto the flying boat.

“This disciple will respectfully send off martial granduncle!” Li Yifu immediately bowed and said.

Xia ruofei stood on the deck and waved his hand.””You can go back! Let’s go! Guard Peach Blossom Island well, contact me by phone if you need anything!” “Yes, martial granduncle!” Li Yifu said.

Xia ruofei didn’t say anything else. He used his mind power to communicate with the core control of the flying boat. The black – armored flying ship trembled slightly before its speed increased rapidly. In the blink of an eye, it had disappeared into the horizon.
