2809 There’s such a move?_

Even if Ruby didn’t attend the press conference, the reporters would still have news to write about. All they needed to do was to add more ink to Ruby’s pride.

Xia ruofei had also guessed Ruby’s intention. He shrugged and smiled.”Alright! Then we’ll follow your plan!”

Ruby and Xia ruofei sat in the changing room and rested for another ten minutes. Then, they got up and walked to the press conference hall in nokapu.

Ruby was right. Although they were almost 20 minutes late this time, there were still many reporters in the press conference hall. Almost no one was willing to give up the opportunity to get first – hand news.

When Ruby appeared, the photojournalists immediately grabbed their cameras and began to take pictures. When they found that the well – deserved hero of Spain, Xia ruofei, also appeared at the press conference, the flashes were even more continuous.

Xia ruofei was also someone who had seen many big scenes. He always had a gentle smile on his face. He nodded at the reporters as he walked to his seat.

Ruby and Xia ruofei went straight to their seats and sat down. Ruby gave Xia ruofei a questioning look. Xia ruofei nodded in understanding and made a gesture to invite him in. Ruby adjusted the angle of the microphone and cleared his throat. The crowd suddenly quieted down.

Ruby said,”first of all, I would like to apologize to everyone. This press conference was supposed to be held 20 minutes ago, but I was late ... And the reason I was late was quite ridiculous!” After the game, I was still celebrating with my players on the field when nokapu’s water spray system suddenly turned on. My players and I were drenched and I didn’t want to let you see two drenched chickens, so I had to go back to the locker room to take a shower and change my clothes!”

Some neutral media reporters laughed in good faith, while some Catalan media reporters who were close to bar?a looked a little upset. A few media reporters who were close to RCD Espanyol showed resentment.

Ruby continued,”I don’t know why this happened!” In my opinion, this is very unprofessional behavior!”

Ruby did not criticize the management of nocapu Stadium too much. Such things only needed to be done to a certain extent. Today, he deliberately arrived 20 minutes late for the press conference with his wet hair and made the matter clear without any tactfulness. He had already conveyed his attitude to the media.

To put it bluntly, the media was always eager to see the world in chaos. How could they let go of such good news material?

Therefore, Ruby didn’t need to hype up the matter too much. The media would naturally play it out.

On the contrary, if he said too much, it would be easy to leave behind excuses.

Ruby was very smart, even a little cunning.

To be honest, even if they were sprayed with water, Ruby and the Spanish players only criticized bar?a’s underhanded tactics. Their joy of defeating their arch – enemy was not diluted by the matter.

Ruby only said this with the mentality that it would be good to make his mortal enemy in the same city feel more uncomfortable.

He quickly began to comment on the game.””This is a great victory! I’m very satisfied with the performance of everyone on the field! Everyone has fully implemented my tactical arrangements and defeated bar?a in nokapu. Is there anything more wonderful than that?”

Next, Ruby focused on a few other players.”Diego Lopez played the role of an old player. He is the anchor of the rear defensive line. If it weren’t for his many difficult saves today, maybe the game would have ended differently. Wu Lei has fully integrated into the team and his improvement is very obvious. He is now a very important player on our forward line. I hope he can score more goals for the Spanish fans in the future! Mr. Xia ruofei is a surprise player on our team. Everyone knows that he is not a professional player, but I have to say that this is a miracle. With Mr. Xia’s strength, he can definitely sit in the main position in any team in La Liga. Today’s game was also thanks to Mr. Xia’s excellent play, which allowed us to get a good result. What I want to say is that Mr. Xia’s two goals in this game are both worth collecting. These two goals will be replayed countless times in the future! I think the editors of the TV station are going to have a headache when selecting the top ten goals of La Liga this round. Which of Mr. Xia’s two goals should be ranked first and which should be ranked second?”

“Hahaha!” The reporters couldn’t help but laugh.

However, they didn’t think Ruby was exaggerating. Anyone who had watched the game would think that Xia ruofei had already taken the top two spots in the top ten.

Ruby then commented on the performance of their opponent, Barcelona. He said that there was no doubt about Barcelona’s strength. They were one of the strongest teams on earth, but they were lacking some luck and ... Xia ruofei!

Ruby’s roundabout way of praising his own players caused another round of laughter.

Very quickly, it was time for the reporters to ask questions.

The beautiful reporter of marca, clatina, was the first to get a chance to ask questions. She stood up after taking the microphone and said in English with a smile,””My question is for Mr. Xia ruofei. What’s your comment on the fountain being turned on in the stadium before the team could even leave after winning the away game?”

Maca was based in Madrid and was a media that was known to be Pro – Real Madrid. Naturally, clatina caught on to bar?a’s weakness and hoped to get a first – hand review from Ruby or Xia ruofei so that she could write a brilliant story about this matter when she returned.

Of course, comparing the two, Xia ruofei was more interesting than Ruby, so she threw the question to Xia ruofei without hesitation.

Of course, clatina also hoped that Xia ruofei, who looked very young, would not be like Ruby, who had dealt with the media all year round. He would not be able to keep his words to himself. How could he create big news? nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Xia ruofei shrugged and said in fluent Spanish,””I don’t think it’s gentlemanly. Of course, I don’t want to comment on nokapu’s approach, but I can tell you clearly that no team will be treated like this at the El prate Stadium, and of course, that includes bar?a!”

El prate was Espanyol’s home ground. Although Xia ruofei said that he did not comment on the lights being turned off and the water spraying, he did make an evaluation and pointed out that Barcelona was not generous enough.

“Thank you!” Clatina smiled sweetly and said,”oh yeah, your Spanish is great. It’s beyond my expectations!”

After that, clatina, who had gotten the answer she wanted, smiled and sat back down.

The reporter from The Sports Daily, Pablo, continued to ask questions, which were still thrown at Xia ruofei.

He asked,”we noticed that you and Messi exchanged jerseys after the game. I think the fans must be very interested. What did Messi say to you at the time? Also, what do you think of Messi?”

Xia ruofei answered the first question in fluent Spanish, so this time, Pablo asked in Spanish.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Messi said that I did well in this game. He also said that he hoped to exchange jerseys with me.” As for my evaluation of him ... There is no doubt that Messi is a great player. Even though the Spaniards and Barcelona are arch – enemies in the same city, it does not prevent me from making such an evaluation of Messi, just like how he also gave full affirmation to my performance. ”

Pablo’s eyes brightened slightly. Before the staff member took the microphone away, he rushed to ask,””So, you and Messi appreciate each other? Even if the relationship between your respective teams is bad, you still admire Messi?”
