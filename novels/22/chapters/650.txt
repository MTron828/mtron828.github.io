Chapter 651: The soul puppet Xia Qing_2

Xia ruofei reached out and touched the man in green. His skin was still elastic, almost the same as a real person ‘s.

Isn’t this simulation technology too awesome? He could simply beat up those so – called human replica robots!

Xia ruofei recalled that the man in green was dressed like an ancient person. He guessed that the person who made him must have been from a previous dynasty.

To be able to create such a fake puppet at that time, it simply subverted Xia ruofei’s understanding.

Fortunately, the soul puppet was in the form of a middle – aged man. If it was made into a beautiful woman, Xia ruofei could not guarantee that he would not have any evil thoughts.

He shook his head violently to get rid of all the wild thoughts in his mind. Then, he walked around the man in green a few times and muttered in his heart,”This spiritual puppet was a replica, but it couldn’t just be an ornament, right?

According to the booklet’s introduction, a soul puppet could assist its owner in many tasks. However, the soul puppet in front of him was motionless, just like playing with a dummy challenge. Qianqian wasn’t exactly accurate in saying that. It was a dummy to begin with!

At this moment, Xia ruofei heard a click. He could not help but shiver.

From the corner of his eyes, he saw the array board on the stone tablet move. He quickly stepped forward and caught the array board that had just fallen off the stone tablet.

Then, the groove on the stone tablet disappeared at a speed that was visible to the naked eye. The stone tablet returned to its original ancient appearance, and no trace of the groove could be seen on it.

Xia ruofei thought that this was too illogical. If he hadn’t reacted quickly just now, the array board would have fallen to the ground. The metal components were not a problem, but the sheep – Fat white jade at the core was probably in trouble. This was the highest quality sheep – Fat white jade! It was very expensive ...

Wait a minute! Sheep – Fat white jade?

Xia ruofei had a flash of inspiration. He clearly remembered that the booklet had mentioned that the runes on the suet white jade were the core to control the spiritual puppet.

......

Could it be that it was the key to making the spiritual puppet move?

As Xia ruofei thought of this, he quickly picked up the array board. He exerted some force and removed the sheep – Fat white jade from the center of the array board.

Then, he started to worry again. He could guess the direction, but how could he place it on the spiritual puppet?

The robots on TV opened the hatch directly and the energy box could be put in.

Could it be that he had to take off the green – robed man’s clothes and check where the sheep – Fat white jade was placed? When Xia ruofei thought of this, he could not help but imagine the scene and felt a chill in his heart.

Xia ruofei tentatively held the palm – sized piece of suet white jade and gently touched the man in green. He said,””Take it ...”

The green – robed man remained motionless.

“Hey, look carefully, it’s the core rune!” Xia ruofei picked up the sheep – Fat white jade and waved it in front of the man in green.”Top quality sheep – Fat white jade. It’s so expensive!”

The green – robed man was unmoved.

“No way? Do you really want me to strip him of his clothes?” Xia ruofei muttered to himself with a bitter face,”at least make him look like a beautiful woman! This is too crazy!”

As he spoke, Xia ruofei looked at the sheep – Fat white jade in his hand unwillingly. He wanted to give it a try, so he released his spiritual energy and circulated it along the complicated and mysterious lines engraved on the sheep – Fat white jade.

A faint white light appeared on the sheep – Fat white jade, and the entire core rune quickly lit up.

The man in Green’s eyes lit up. Then, there was a suction force. The suet white jade in Xia ruofei’s hand flew up and passed through the man in Green’s clothes before entering his body.

Xia ruofei stared at the man in green nervously.

The man in Green’s eyes slowly lit up as if he had come to life. He moved his hands and feet gently and turned to Xia ruofei. With a respectful expression, he said,””Master!”

Yes, this guy’s expression was also quite realistic!

Xia ruofei was shocked as well. He was wondering if this was a real puppet or a human. Why was he panicking?

Xia ruofei cleared his throat and pretended to be calm.””Hmm, you ... What’s your name?”

“Master, please give me a name!” The green – robed man bowed slightly and replied.

Give him a name? What should I call it?

Old Zhao?

Old Li?

Old Wang? Xia ruofei thought about how this guy lived in the spirit map space, which meant that he was his neighbor! He immediately felt bad. He was determined not to have such a vulgar name!

Xia ruofei thought for a while and looked at the green robe he was wearing.””You can follow my surname, Xia! As for the name ... Let’s call her Xia Qing, okay?”

“Thank you for the name, master!” The Azure – robed Xia Qing bowed and said.

“Alright, I’ll call you Xia Qing from now on!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Then, Xia ruofei asked hesitantly,””Xia Qing! You ... Are you really just a puppet, not a real person?”

It was a bit of a blow to ask so directly, but Xia ruofei didn’t have the confidence. Besides, it seemed that Xia Qing was very respectful to him, Xia ruofei thought that he wouldn’t be angry ...

As expected, Xia Qing didn’t show any dissatisfaction, and she replied with a respectful tone,””I’m master’s exclusive spiritual puppet, not a human. ”

“Then who made you? What is your body made of?” Xia ruofei asked.

He was really curious about this question. This soul puppet was simply passing off a fake as the real one, and it seemed to have a very high spiritual intelligence, even more realistic than the world’s top Intelligent Robots. It could be said that if Xia Qing was changed into a set of modern clothes and let him go to the outside world, no one would find out that he was actually just a puppet.

Facing Xia ruofei’s expectant eyes, Xia Qing lowered her head and said,””I’m sorry, master. I didn’t know. ”

It seemed that this question was beyond Xia Qing’s scope. After all, he was just a puppet, and whether he knew or not was all decided by the person who made him.

Xia ruofei was slightly disappointed. Then, he asked,””Alright! Then ... What can you help me with?”

“Master, I’ve implanted” nine volumes of the divine farmer,”” collection of the farming heart,”” immortal herb Scripture,”and other ancient books into my brain. They can help master take care of the spirit map world and take care of the spirit herbs and immortal herbs within the spirit map world ...” Xia Qing immediately said.

When Xia ruofei heard the words “spirit map world”, he was slightly moved. He knew that this was probably the correct name for the spirit map space.

He quickly asked,”you know that we’re in the spirit map world, right?” How much more do you know about the spirit map world?”

Xia Qing replied,”master, I only know that the spirit map world is divided into the Archean realm and the mountain and sea realm. The Archean realm has a time formation that allows one to grow rare spirit plants that require a longer period of time. The mountain and sea realm is vast and boundless. It is a small world ...”

At this point, Xia Qing paused for a moment. She looked into the distance and sensed for a moment, then said,””Master, the current mountain and sea realm is only the tip of the iceberg. Master still has to work hard, so that the spirit map world can grow as quickly as possible.”

Xia ruofei’s eyes lit up. It was obvious that the so – called primal realm was actually the original space, and the mountain and sea realm was the new space he was in.

“Xia Qing, do you know how to make the spirit map world grow as quickly as possible?” he quickly asked.

“Master, you can plant more rare spirit herbs and immortal herbs. The spirit Qi released by these spirit herbs can nourish the spirit map world.” Xia Qing said,”for example, the spirit heart tree of the Archean realm is a very good spirit plant. In addition, there are also some spirit plants that are extremely beneficial to the growth of the spirit map world, such as the Purple Heart mysterious pearl grass, mysterious Jade ginseng, Nine Heavens resurrection grass ...”

Xia ruofei could not help but feel a headache when he heard these names. He had never heard of them before. Furthermore, they looked very high – end and impressive. Where was he supposed to find them? Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He directly interrupted Xia Qing’s words and asked,””Stop, stop ... Let’s not talk about this first. Xia Qing, other than the various spirit plants, is there any other way to promote the growth of the spirit map world?”

“There’s another way,”said Xia Qing.

Xia ruofei was overjoyed and quickly said,””Hurry up and tell me!”
