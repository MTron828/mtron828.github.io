Chapter 3421: Tower of Trials “seventh floor_l

Translator: 549690339

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but smile bitterly.’This reward … It really doesn’t follow the rules!”

The Vermilion Jade Fruit was clearly an extremely precious spiritual fruit. If it were to be sold in the cultivation world, it would definitely cause a crazy fight. However, obtaining such a precious spirit fruit without any use was even more maddening than not getting it!

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”You can’t eat it. It’s a pity to throw it away. You can’t take it away… The senior who designed the trial mission, can you not be so naughty?”

Xia ruofei looked at the two Vermilion Jade fruits in his hand speechlessly. After a long while, he said,””It’s a waste of time for us to climb down the cliff to pick those two Vermilion Jade fruits! Even if we don’t do anything, we’ll still get two at the entrance of the passage … Forget it! Forget it! It was better to go directly to the seventh floor! Let’s hope the seventh floor’s quest isn’t that bad

At this moment, Xia ruofei suddenly felt the weight in his hand lighten. Then, the two Vermilion Jade fruits he was holding disappeared into thin air.

“This…” Xia ruofei was shocked.”What’s going on?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Ling Qingxue’s expression was a little strange. She said,””Ruofe…The…The two Vermilion Jade Fruit…I think I…Put them in my storage ring!”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but widen his eyes and say,””What? Qingxue, can you repeat that? did I hear you wrong?”

“I… Just now… I was just trying to make a last resort to see if I could put the Vermillion Jade Fruit into my storage ring,” Ling Qingxue said,”I didn’t expect … To put it in so quickly!”

“Really?” Xia ruofei could not believe it.

“Mm! The two Vermilion Jade fruits are in my storage ring right now!” Ling Qingxue said,”do you want me to take them out and show you?”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”no, no, no!” If you take out the Vermillion Jade Fruit and we can’t take it back, wouldn’t we be dumbfounded? I’ll just leave it with you!”

Then, Xia ruofei said with a puzzled look,””After we picked the Vermilion Jade fruit at the bottom of the cliff, I tried it, but there was no way to put it into a storage treasure. How could these two be okay? Could there be a BUG?”

“I don’t know either!” Ling Qingxue said,”I was just trying. I didn’t think it would be so easy to put it in!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I don’t care!” Whether it’s a BUG or not, at least these two Vermilion Jade fruits are truly ours! Hahaha! I’ve made up my mind!”

The situation just now was like a Gold Mountain in front of them, but they couldn’t move it away at all. It was really uncomfortable.

As long as the Vermilion Jade Fruit could be stored in a storage treasure, it meant that it could definitely be taken out of the trial Pagoda. This was because the storage treasure itself was a small independent space. Even if the storage ring was destroyed, it would only destroy the small space. The items inside could not be returned to the body. They would only fall into the spatial turbulence.

Moreover, this trial Pagoda couldn’t possibly destroy the storage Treasures of all the cultivators who entered it when they left. Even if that senior Almighty was crazy, he wouldn’t do such a crazy thing.

Therefore, anything that could be stored in a storage treasure could be taken out.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue’s mood instantly brightened up when they received two Vermilion Jade fruits at once. At least their efforts were not in vain.

Ling Qingxue was especially focused on helping Song Wei increase her cultivation level. She didn’t want Song Wei to feel uncomfortable because of the huge difference in their cultivation levels. With the Vermilion Jade Fruit, it would be much easier to raise his cultivation.

Of course, Xia ruofei was very happy. There were two Vermilion Jade fruits, and Song Wei could only consume half of it. If the rest of the Vermilion Jade fruits were given to Qi condensation cultivators, they could be split into three portions. Even if it was given to an Aurous core stage cultivator, one pill would be enough. Not everyone could be as strong as Xia ruofei. The remaining half could at least allow a Qj refining stage cultivator’s cultivation to soar.

In the hidden space enshrouded in purple mist, the green – robed elder looked at the smiling Xia ruofei and couldn’t help but sneer. He muttered to himself,'”‘How can this old man’s arrangements be seen through by a little kid like you? It’s a pity that your Dao companion actually wants to give it a try, otherwise … Hehe! When we meet again, I’ll tell you the truth. Your expression will be very interesting then …”

Xia ruofei cupped Ling Qingxue’s cheek and kissed it heavily. He smiled and said,'”‘Qingxue, it’s all thanks to you! Otherwise, I might even throw this Vermillion Jade Fruit away! You see … Your usefulness always shows itself inadvertently! You can’t undervalue yourself in the future!”

Ling Qingxue blushed and said,'”‘I know!”

“Go! I’ll take you to the seventh level of the trial space!” Xia ruofei said.

He held Ling Qingxue’s hand and walked to the familiar door.

The two of them stopped and looked at each other in tacit understanding. Then, they took a deep breath at the same time and stepped into the light curtain Door together.

After a familiar light tearing and dizziness, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue felt their feet on the ground again.

When they entered the light curtain Door, the two of them had been holding hands.

Xia ruofei was actually very clear that if the two of them were to be separated, he would not have used the cassock to hold hands. When he first entered this secret realm, he had held Ling Qingxue’s hand and entered together. However, after entering, he realized that the two of them had already been separated..
