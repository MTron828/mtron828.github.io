Of course, if Xia ruofei had to go into seclusion for a long time or was unable to contact the outside world, he would make some arrangements in advance. For example, he would leave behind a few petals of the spirit Heart Flower. After all, a promise meant karma. If one could not fulfill one’s promise, one’s Dao heart might be affected at some point in the future.

“No problem! No problem!” “Mr. Xia, I’ll go and arrange the spaceship,” Elon Musk said quickly. This should be relatively quick. The spaceship and the cabin are already available. We only need to remove the useless system and make some adjustments to the internal design. Then, we will do the assembly work. It won’t take too long. ”

“That’s great!” Xia ruofei said,”in other words, the spaceship and the expansion cabin were assembled before the EVA suit?”

“Of course!” “Yes,” Elon Musk said without hesitation.”If you need it, it can be completed in two weeks at the latest! Do you think ... It will be delivered together with the EVA suit, or the part for the spacecraft in advance?”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and asked,””If it’s two weeks later ... By then, we should be able to provide some of the spacesuits and oxygen supply modules, right?”

“Theoretically, yes!” Elon Musk hesitated for a moment and said,”but this way, we will need to make some adjustments to the workflow. Originally, I was planning to assemble the spacesuits together after all the parts were produced. ”

“Then I’ll have to trouble you to make some adjustments. It’ll be perfect if you can give us a few sets of spacesuits and a certain number of oxygen supply modules when we deliver the spacecraft in two weeks!” Xia ruofei said.

Elon Musk pondered for a moment before saying,””It should be no problem! I think ... It should be possible to provide five sets of spacesuits and hundreds of oxygen supply modules!”

“Then it’s decided!” Xia ruofei said,”Mr. Masker, I’m counting on you!”

“You’re too kind!” Elon Musk said,”Mr. Xia, I’ll take my leave first! I have to make arrangements for the spaceship’s modification ...”

Having just received three life – saving promises from Xia ruofei, Elon Musk was full of energy.

“Please do!” Xia ruofei also stood up and said,”I’ll go and check on little X’s condition.”

……

For the next three to four days, Xia ruofei continued to stay in the mansion of Elon Musk, performing acupuncture on little X step by step and providing Chinese medicine on time. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Although little X did not undergo a full body examination again, elonmask and gramus could still see that little X’s condition was improving day by day. The two of them were naturally very happy. Little X was diagnosed with Strigoi not long after he was born. This huge haze had been lingering in their hearts for a long time. Now, the haze had finally been dispelled.

In the blink of an eye, Xia ruofei had already stayed at Elon Musk’s house for a week.

According to his treatment plan, the acupuncture was basically over, but the process of taking the medicine would continue for about three weeks.

Xia ruofei didn’t need to stay here any longer – Yingluo couldn’t really stay here for a month.

Of course, before he left, Xia ruofei left a sufficient amount of Chinese medicine for Elon Musk.

Xia ruofei had brewed the Chinese medicine in advance and divided it into small portions according to the dosage of little X.

For the convenience of storage, Elon Musk had also specially purchased a set of vacuum – packed Chinese medicine equipment. This way, Xia ruofei could easily divide the Chinese medicine into small portions.

He had to take it three times a day for 21 days, so he had 63 bags of Chinese medicine.

Elon Musk had people stick a label on each bag of Chinese medicine, indicating the date of consumption. Then, he bought a refrigerator to store these medicines separately and sent someone to guard them 24 hours a day.

After giving all the necessary instructions, Xia ruofei left the mansion in Elon Musk’s exclusive car, the one and only Tesla electric car.

Naturally, elonmask and gramus personally sent him off.

Even little X, who had not left the room for a long time, was carried out by Grims to see Xia ruofei off.

Of course, this was also because little X’s condition had greatly improved. Otherwise, even if Grims wanted to do this, Mannu’s medical team would not allow it.

Back at the Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles, Xia ruofei immediately gathered everyone.

Song Wei and the rest had been here for a week and had nothing to do. Fortunately, Li Yifu, the host, had made very detailed arrangements. They did not stay in the hotel for the whole week and basically went out to have fun with Li Yifu, enjoying the Super VIP treatment.

One should know that in this group, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue were Xia ruofei’s cultivation partners. In terms of seniority, they were on the same level as Li Yifu’s grandmother. Chen Xuan and Yu Xin ‘er were both well – known Masters and had high status in the cultivation world. Not only did Chen Xuan have a good father, he was also a golden core stage expert. Li Yifu would definitely have to serve any of these four people carefully.

The wealth, status, and fame of the secular world were not worth mentioning in the world of cultivation.

Everyone was gathered in Xia ruofei’s room.

Chen Xuan smiled and said,”brother Xia, it’s been hard on you this week!” We followed you to the United States, but we didn’t help much. It’s all your help!”
