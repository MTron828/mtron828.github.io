Translator: 549690339

When Xiao Qiang heard this, he knew that pang Hao would be appointed as the Chief Financial Officer, which was the CFO. He couldn’t help feeling envious.

In fact, as someone who had come from a famous school, Xiao Qiang looked down on pang Hao, who didn’t have a high educational background. This was also a common problem among the elites of famous schools, which was to judge people with colored glasses.

However, pang Hao and Xia ruofei were classmates. Xia ruofei’s position in the company was stable, second only to the General Manager, Feng Jing. Xiao Qiang could not be envious of this. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

He quickly adjusted his attitude, stood up, and said respectfully,””Alright, President Xia, I’ll inform him immediately! Then I’ll go down first ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. He stood up and said,””President Xiao, work hard in the future! The company won’t mistreat meritorious officials!”

Xiao Qiang’s heart was filled with excitement, and he felt somewhat flattered.

Director Xiao and President Xiao might only have a difference of one word, but their meanings were completely different.

The director was the Head of the Department, while President Xiao was the head of the company.

“Of course, of course!” Xiao Qiang quickly replied. President Xia, please wait!”

After he finished speaking, he hurriedly bowed slightly to Xia ruofei and left the office in quick steps. He did not dare to let Xia ruofei personally send him out.

In fact, Xia ruofei was just pretending to get up. He had no intention of seeing Xiao Qiang out.

After Xiao Qiang left, Xia ruofei sat down and started scribbling in his notebook. He was mainly jotting down his judgment of Xiao Qiang from the conversation just now.

Now, Xia ruofei was becoming more and more like the head of the company. Even though he did not do anything most of the time, his prestige in the hearts of the employees had never diminished. Even Feng Jing could not compare to him.

Very quickly, pang Hao knocked on the door and entered the office. He said,””President Xia, you’re looking for me?”

After more than a year of experience, pang Hao had become more mature. He did not feel superior just because he was Xia ruofei’s classmate. On the contrary, he had always been in a state of vigilance, reminding himself not to be arrogant because of the favor he received, and even more so, not to embarrass Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”fatty, there’s no one else in the office. Why do you have to be so formal?” Sit, sit, sit, I’m just looking for you to have a casual chat ...”

Pang Hao was much more relaxed after hearing that. He sat down on the chair opposite Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei pushed the cup of tea over and said,””Have some tea, we’ll chat while drinking!”

He used the large teacup that was used to serve guests. After all, today was a formal conversation between the two of them. He did not want to make it too casual. It was not okay for the two of them to make Kung Fu Tea and chat at the same time.

“Ruofei, if there’s anything you need, just give me a call and give me instructions!” Pang Hao said with a smile.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Fatty, I called you here today to tell you that our company will be undergoing structural adjustments and optimization soon. Hmm...In general, we’ll be using the Company group’s structure, so the number of people in the company’s leadership has also been expanded. I’ve discussed with director Feng and we’ve decided that you’ll be the company’s CFO, which is the Chief Financial Officer.”

When pang Hao heard this, he could not help but reveal a surprised expression. His mouth was slightly agape, and the amiable smile on his face seemed to have frozen.

It was obvious that the good news came too suddenly for him.

Xia ruofei found it funny and waved his hand in front of pang Hao.””Hey! My soul has returned!”

“Ruofei, you’re not joking with me, are you?” pang Hao snapped back to his senses.

“Nonsense! How can I joke about such a serious matter?” Xia ruofei said unhappily,”what? You don’t seem to be willing?”

“Of course I’m a hundred, a thousand times more willing!” Pang Hao laughed bitterly. Who doesn’t like to be promoted?”

Pang Hao was closer to Xia ruofei, so he didn’t have to think for a long time before speaking like Xiao Qiang. He didn’t need to figure out the meaning of Xia ruofei’s words because Xia ruofei would definitely not beat around the bush when speaking to him. Whatever she said would definitely be what it was, without any hidden meaning.

Pang Hao then changed the topic and said,””Ruofei, I’m just worried that I’m not capable enough. Will it delay my work? You see, President Feng, director Xiao, and the others all graduated from famous schools, while I’m only in a Junior College ...”

“I don’t like to hear that. So what if you’re a Junior College student?” Xia ruofei said,”haven’t you been doing well for the past year? I don’t see you making any mistakes in your work! Besides ... Aren’t you also self – studying finance?”

“That’s different ...”

“Different my ass!” Xia ruofei ruthlessly interrupted pang Hao’s words and said,”according to your theory, I should be guarding the door. After all, I haven’t even gone to college ...”

“You’re the boss, how is that the same?” Pang Hao smiled and said,”the big bosses like Bill Gates and Zuckerberg dropped out of college!”

“I think you just don’t have the confidence!” Xia ruofei said,”isn’t it just a CFO? Wasn’t the work about those things? Could it be more complicated than being the financial director now? Are you afraid of people gossiping?”

“Not exactly ...” Pang Hao said with a bitter smile.”There’s also the worry about his ability. After all, the company is developing faster and faster, and the scale is getting bigger and bigger. The complexity of the financial work is also increasing exponentially ...”

“You brat, your brain must be flooded!” Xia ruofei said resentfully,”you’re the leader! Leader, do you understand? Leave the specific work to the subordinates. Your responsibility is to helm the ship! The entire finance department has to help me look after this! If you think the work is too complicated, then just continue to build a strong team! Our company is hiring every few days, so why don’t you report your requirements!”
