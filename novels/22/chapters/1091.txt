Chapter 1092: Elder song’s birthday (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei was leaning against the headboard when he made the call. After hearing song Rui’s words, he sat up and smiled.””Why did you say ‘also’? Are you also in the capital? It can’t be such a coincidence!”

“I’m really in Beijing!” Song Rui said,”I just came here yesterday!”

“F * ck!” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but swear.”I also came yesterday ...”

The two of them checked the time and realized that they had arrived in Beijing almost at the same time. The two of them were on two adjacent flights and the landing time was less than an hour apart.

Xia ruofei laughed and scolded,”F * ck ... You’re just like a ghost!” The moment I set foot in the capital, you actually ran over as well!”

Song Rui did not back down and said,”What do you mean I’m a lingering spirit?” This is part of my plan, okay? You, on the other hand, don’t you care much about the company’s Affairs? Why are you here on a business trip?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s a long story ...”

“Then don’t say it!” Song Rui immediately said,”but ... I’m guessing ... It’s related to that small star?”

“You’re right ...” Xia ruofei said.”Sigh ... You’ve done a great job this time. You didn’t screw up at the critical moment! That small star hadn’t gone far yet! In the blink of an eye, you’ve come back crying and begging for mercy ...”

“Hehe! I wouldn’t dare to neglect your matters!” Song Rui said. Then, he asked in a wretched manner,”is she in your bed now? Do you want me to remove the ban tomorrow?”

“Go! Do you think that everyone is as filthy as you?” Xia ruofei laughed and scolded,”I’m telling you! This person wanted to seal her up! If I ever see any news about her still in the entertainment industry, I’ll make you pay!”

“Woof! Boss Xia is really angry this time!” Song Rui laughed and said,” I’ll go back and pass the word, and I guarantee that no one will dare to let her out!”

Song Rui said it casually. A small star like Dong Xinyu was indeed insignificant in his eyes. He would definitely do as Xia ruofei said.

“Thanks!” Xia ruofei said. Oh right ... You said you had something to discuss with me, now that I’m free, tell me!”

“I called to invite you to the capital,” song Rui said.”But now that you’re here, it’s even easier!”

“What’s wrong?” Xia ruofei frowned and asked,”what happened?”

“Can’t you just wish for me to be better!” Song Rui complained and then said,”nothing happened! However, it’s my grandfather’s birthday the day after tomorrow, and he has personally instructed me to invite you over to celebrate his birthday!”

Xia ruofei stood up and said,””Elder song’s birthday? Why didn’t you say so earlier!”

He did a quick calculation in his heart. Elder song should be 84 years old this year. However, the older generation mostly celebrated their fake birthday, which was 85 years old. Although it was not the 10th birthday, it was still quite important to celebrate the 5th.

After all, elder song was already so old. To put it bluntly, it was hard to say if he could even celebrate his tenth birthday!

Song Rui couldn’t help but pout and said,”I’ve already taken the initiative to call you twice to talk about this!” You were the one who didn’t even give me a chance to speak before hanging up ...”

Xia ruofei chuckled in embarrassment.””I just happened to have something to do, right? Elder song’s birthday is in two days, I didn’t even prepare for it!”

“My grandfather has specially instructed that you can come alone. Don’t bring any gifts!” Song Rui said hurriedly.

“How can that be!” Xia ruofei subconsciously said,”it’s impolite to come empty – handed!”

Song Rui smiled and said,”actually, my grandfather’s birthday was not planned to be Grand at all. The leaders of the central office proposed to prepare a birthday banquet for him at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, but they were all rejected. It will be held at our old house the day after tomorrow. Only some of our own families will attend the banquet. You are one of the few guests that the old man personally invited!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel touched. It was just a small family banquet, but elder song had specially invited him to attend. It could be seen how much elder song valued him.

He pondered for a moment and said,”alright!” I know, I’ll definitely be there the day after tomorrow!”

“Mm! “Send me your hotel’s location. I’ll come and pick you up the day after tomorrow ...” Song Rui said.”The old house is heavily guarded. You can’t get in without someone to take you in!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said.

After he hung up, he sent the location of the hotel to song Rui.

Then, Xia ruofei lay on the bed and thought about what gift to prepare.

Although song Rui had said that the old master had specifically emphasized not to bring gifts, Xia ruofei would definitely not go to the house empty – handed.

However, it was a little particular what kind of gift to prepare.

If it was just old mountain ginseng or iron – Skin maples, Xia ruofei could take them out at any time.

Although these precious Chinese medicinal herbs were not unpresentable, especially the good – looking and old ginseng, which was hard to come by, Xia ruofei still felt that it was not very suitable as a birthday gift.

Xia ruofei had already given elder song a similar gift. If he still gave him wild ginseng, it would not be sincere enough.
