2012 A strategy (1)

Lui hai sized Xia ruofei up under the light. He was too young and looked plain, but he was exactly the same as the picture Li Yifu sent him.

Hello, Mr. Xia, I’m lui hai! He said hurriedly.

Hello, Mr. Lu! Xia ruofei nodded and said,thank you for your hard work. You guys came here very quickly ...

Lui hai said a bit cautiously,you’re welcome! Just call me ah hai! Uncle Yi told us to follow your arrangements! If you need us to do anything, just tell us!

In fact, when Li Yifu called him, he was even more serious than this. He told lui hai that Mr. Xia had a very distinguished status, so he should respect Mr. Xia as much as he respected him.

Li Yifu’s position in the Hong sect was very high. Not only was he one of the big bosses in the United States headquarters, but he also controlled a huge amount of wealth. His father, li Jiuzhou, was also a legendary Big Boss of the Hong sect. Therefore, his influence in the Hong sect was much stronger than that of ordinary big bosses.

Li Yifu asked lui hai to respect Xia ruofei as much as he respected him, which meant Xia ruofei’s status was elevated to the level of the leader of the Hong sect.

Lui hai couldn’t understand why Li Yifu didn’t pay so much attention to Qianqian even though Xia ruofei was from a top family. The heads of those families could barely enjoy such treatment, but Li Yifu didn’t care much about the junior Disciples.

Even so, lui hai didn’t dare to neglect Li Yifu’s warning, so he was very respectful to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei didn’t beat around the bush. He nodded and said,Okay, ah hai, I still have two friends here. I need you to find a safe place for us to settle down.

No problem! Lui hai said without hesitation,we have our own branch in Turin. It’s absolutely safe there!

En! Xia ruofei nodded and said,they can understand Chinese. Let’s not talk about it on the way. We’ll talk about it when we get there!

Lui hai only heard from Li Yifu that it might be related to the local mafia, but Li Yifu didn’t know the details. After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, he immediately nodded and said,No problem!

Please wait for a moment, I’ll bring them out! Xia ruofei said.

With that, Xia ruofei turned around and went into the bushes. He opened the door of the Mercedes – Benz and got in.

Mr. Xia, are your friends here Monica asked.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,yes! They’ll settle you down first. You’ll be safe once you’re there. We’ll go out now!

Alright! Monica said.

She was not worried that Xia ruofei would lie to her. If he had any ill intentions, he would not have needed to go through so much trouble, much less help her rescue Rousey.

Besides, the siblings had no other choice but to trust Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei started the car and drove out of the bushes to lui Hai’s SUV.

He opened the door and got off, saying to lui hai,I have three people with me. Also, I need your help to deal with this car and make it disappear completely.

This Mercedes – Benz was going to take Monica to the Toles villa, and it would definitely become an important clue in the Gehrman family’s search. It had to be cleaned up.

No problem! Lui hai nodded. Just leave it to us!

After that, lui hai said after a moment of silence,Ah li! The three of you will drive Mr. Xia’s car. After you’ve cleaned up the car, you can return on your own!

Alright, big brother hai! Ah li quickly said.

Lui hai then said to Xia ruofei with respect,Mr. Xia, you can let your friend in!

Xia ruofei nodded and walked to the side of the Mercedes – Benz. He opened the door and told Monica,Monica, let’s switch to that car!

With that, Xia ruofei carried Rousey easily and Monica followed him to the SUV.

All the seats in the car were empty. Monica and her brother sat in the back, Xia ruofei sat in the passenger’s seat, and lui hai drove himself.

The two cars drove out of the road one after another. Ali and the others drove the broken Mercedes – Benz and disappeared into the night, while lui hai drove towards the downtown area of Turin.

As Xia ruofei had told them in advance, lui hai didn’t talk much on the way. It was very quiet in the car.

After entering the downtown area, lui hai drove through the streets and alleys. After about half an hour, he arrived at a small building.

This small building was also a typical French style building, and it looked a little old. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

In fact, the entire block was basically filled with old buildings that were full of a sense of age, which made it look very amorous.

The French building had a small yard. Lui hai flashed the car lights in front of the door and someone opened it immediately. It was a young Chinese man in his 20S. Lui hai stuck his head out of the car and waved his hand. The young man immediately pushed the door open.

Lui hai drove the car into the yard. As soon as the car stopped, he unbuckled his seat belt and got off the car. He trotted to the other side of the car to open the door for Xia ruofei.

Mr. Xia, please! Lui hai said respectfully.

This scene stunned the young man who opened the door.

Thank you! Xia ruofei said with a smile.

After Xia ruofei got off the car, lui hai said to the young man,Ah Yong, arrange three empty rooms. There are two guests here. Take them to rest ... Oh, right, push a wheelchair over first.

Obviously, lui hai was not as rough as he looked. From this detail, one could see his attentiveness.

Alright! Ah Yong quickly ran into the small building.

Xia ruofei said to Monica,go and rest with Rousey. You’ll be safe here. Don’t worry! I’ll solve the problem with the Gelman family as soon as possible. You don’t have to escape abroad.

Lui hai raised his eyebrows when he heard the name of the Geerman family, but he didn’t say anything.

I understand. Thank you, Mr. Xia! Monica said.

Ah Yong quickly pushed a wheelchair over. Xia ruofei personally carried Rossi out of the car and placed him in the wheelchair. Then, he patted his shoulder and said,Rest early!

Ah Yong pushed the wheelchair and led Monica into the small building.

Lui hai also stepped aside and walked into the building with Xia ruofei.

Ah Yong, after you’ve settled the two guests, inform zhengfeng and the rest to come to the small meeting room in ten minutes. There’s something important to discuss! Lui hai said.

Alright, big brother hai! Ah Yong said.

Considering Rousey’s inconvenience, the rooms ah Yong arranged for them were on the first floor.

When they reached the stairs, lui hai said,Mr. Xia, this way please!

He brought Xia ruofei to a small meeting room on the second floor and busied himself with making tea for Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei said,hai, don’t be busy! I’ll tell you what happened first ...

Yes! Lui hai sat down opposite to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,You’ve heard it just now. It has something to do with the Gelman family. Those two people just now are my friends ...

Xia ruofei briefly told lui hai about Monica’s situation, and then said,That’s the general situation. My request is very simple, and that is to completely solve Monica’s problem. Do you have any suggestions

Lui hai thought for a while and said,Mr. Xia, we know about the situation between the Gelman family and the Moore family. The influence of the Gelman family in Turin is growing rapidly. If it wasn’t for Toles ‘incident, the Gelman family would have to give me some face. But now ...

Xia ruofei said directly,there’s no need to worry about the Gelman family. I don’t have a good impression of this Mafia family. Just destroy them. I’m worried about whether the glory society will retaliate ...

Lui hai couldn’t help but smile bitterly, thinking,Young master! You’re really saying it without pain! In all of Italy, the Gelman family was not a big force, but it was not easy to destroy them ...

But since Xia ruofei said so, lui hai couldn’t refute Jian Jia. Li Yifu told him to be careful. Otherwise, he would have given a tight slap to any young man in the Hong sect who dared to talk big.

Fighting and killing all day long wouldn’t be able to achieve much.

Mr. Xia, lui hai frowned,if we want to kill the Gelman family, we must mobilize people from all over the country. It’s impossible to hide such a big move from the glory society ...

Do you need a lot of manpower Xia ruofei asked,how many people do you have in Turin

There should be a few hundred people who can fight! Lui hai said,but the Gelman family has gained a firm foothold in Turin. Their influence is in many fields such as restaurants and construction companies. If we want to cripple the whole family, we won’t have enough manpower. There are too many aspects and we can’t kill them in one blow. When they come back to their senses and start to mobilize manpower or even ask for help from the glory Association, things will be very troublesome.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and asked,Ah hai, if ... And I’m saying if, you didn’t mobilize people from other places, and only attacked the Gelman family in Turin, what would the glory society’s reaction be

Lui hai felt this question was a bit ridiculous. He had clearly explained that the manpower of Turin alone could not defeat the German family. What was the point of this assumption

However, since Xia ruofei had asked, he did not dare to not answer.

After thinking for a while, lui hai said,Mr. Xia, if it were any other small force, the glory society would definitely send reinforcements to the Gelman family. After all, the Gelman family is backed by one of the glory society’s elders. But if it’s US, the Hong sect, they’ll most likely just wait and see ...

Oh Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and asked with interest,is there something in this
