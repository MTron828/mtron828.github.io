“Alright ...” Lin Yue ‘e said,”thank you, RUO Fei!”

Xia ruofei smiled and invited everyone to sit down in the small living room. He then said,””Sister – in – Law, uncle Luo, let me know if you need anything in your life. This place is quite far from the Urban area, so you have to go to town to buy groceries. So, I suggest that you don’t start eating for the time being. It’s more convenient for you to apply for a card and eat in the cafeteria tomorrow.”

“Alright, we’ll listen to you!” Lin Yue ‘e said with a smile. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”uncle Luo still needs some time to absorb the medicine after taking the medicine last time. I’ll come back in two days to check on you. Don’t worry. As long as you persist in the treatment, your illness will definitely be cured.”

Uncle Luo chuckled and nodded,””Alright, alright, alright.”

Then, Xia ruofei continued,”sister – in – Law, let’s talk about the salary and benefits!” You’ll be a supervisor at the orchard. According to our salary, your monthly salary is about 8000 Yuan, and you’ll be given insurance, welfare, and other annual benefits. ”

Lin Yue ‘e jumped in fright when she heard that. She hurriedly waved her hands and said,””This is too high! There’s no work in the orchard, and I don’t have to do it myself, so how can I get such a high salary? RUO Fei, just give me two to three thousand!”

“Yeah!” Uncle Luo also said. “Eight thousand is too much. It’s even higher than the salary of our County Head ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”how can you compare it like that?” I’m a private company. If the company’s benefits are good, the employee treatment will be high! Sister – in – Law, uncle Luo, the ordinary workers on our farm are paid 5000 a month. Even the sister – in – Law who worked in the cafeteria just now, her salary is more than 2000 or 3000! You’re just an orchard manager with a salary of two to three thousand Yuan. People can’t say that I’m exploiting my employees!”

Lin Yue ‘e asked in disbelief,””Ruofei, is the salary here really that high?”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”of course!” It’s not a secret. When you’re familiar with the employees in the future, you’ll know once you ask them. Why Would I Lie to You?”

“But baqian is also ...” Lin Yue ‘e revealed an awkward expression.

“Sister – in – Law, I’m really not giving you any special treatment!” Xia ruofei said seriously,”the company has its own system. Even if I’m the boss, I have to follow the rules. Besides, the company is making money, so we can only give our employees such treatment! Don’t decline ...”

“Alright then ...” Lin Yue ‘e could only helplessly reply.

Uncle Luo was also speechless,”Xia, is the salary in the southeast province so high?” No wonder the young men in our village work in this area all year round and can earn tens of thousands of Yuan every year. I used to think that they were bragging!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”uncle Luo, those who come out to work are all working hard to earn money!” Not all companies had the same benefits as gaofu! However, as long as sister – in – Law continues to work in our company, the treatment will be even better in the future. It’s not just her, all the employees will be the same!”

Xia ruofei chatted with them for a while more before he got up and bade them farewell. They still had to pack their luggage. Besides, they had been in the car for a long time today. Nan Nan also had to rest early.

On the small path back to the villa, Xia ruofei was in a very good mood. He had finally completed the task assigned by Wolf King Guo Zhan. At the same time, he had done something within his ability for squad leader Luo.

As he walked, he took out his phone, found Guo Zhan’s number, and dialed it to check if he had completed the mission. He definitely had to report to the chief.
