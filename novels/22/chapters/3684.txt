Chen Xuan’s words piqued Xia ruofei’s interest.

After they were seated, Chen Xuan gave Xia ruofei a toast to express his gratitude.

Then, he didn’t keep her in suspense and said directly,””Brother RUO Fei, it was my father’s idea for me to ask you to come here. He told me through voice transmission before he left. This matter is related to the opportunity that my father announced in public.”

“I’m all ears!”Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“To be honest, this opportunity isn’t really a secret within the heavenly sect. Basically, every disciple has a chance. It’s just that only a handful of people get to obtain a truly great opportunity. Brother RUO Fei, you might not know this, but the first heaven society once had a leaving aperture stage master, and our heritage is very long. Therefore, we also have many glorious inheritances. Although most of the inheritances were lost in the catastrophe hundreds of years ago, we managed to preserve a very important secret realm … Or to be more precise, a magic treasure!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei listened attentively and nodded.””So, this opportunity is related to this magic treasure?”

“Yes, I am!” Chen Xuan replied,”this treasure is called the seven stars Pavilion. It looks like a miniature Pavilion on the outside, and the Big Dipper is engraved on the plaque at the top.”

Chen Xuan raised his glass and gestured to Xia ruofei. Then, he took a sip and continued,””The purpose of the seven Star Pavilion’s initial design is no longer known, but for this generation of disciples of the heavenly sect, after reaching the fifth Qi layer, we will have a chance to enter the seven Star Pavilion. After breaking through to the Golden core stage, you’ll be given another chance to enter the seven Star Pavilion.”
