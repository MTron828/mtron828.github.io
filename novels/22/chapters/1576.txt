Chapter 1577: Getting rich in silence (2)

Translator: 549690339

The big screen in the venue was still blank, but since the organizers had let everyone in, they should be announcing the winning figures soon.

Sure enough, under everyone’s expectant gaze, the big screen began to refresh the data, and there was a small commotion in the crowd.

Song Wei quickly looked at the big screen. Xia ruofei smiled and said, “Don’t worry, your raw stone is more than five hundred! It can’t be that fast ...”

“Can’t I take a look at someone else’s first?” Song Wei said and continued to ask,”Oh right, which raw stones did you invest? I’ll help you look after it! I don’t want you to miss it. ”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”I’ll tell you when I win!” To avoid losing face if you don’t win the bid ...”

“You’re still keeping me in suspense ...” Song Wei looked at Xia ruofei, amused.

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”you’d better focus on your raw stone!” You’ve only managed to get one. If you didn’t get it, then you’d have come here for nothing ...”

“Pei Pei Pei! You jinx!” Song Wei said,”then why don’t you recommend me to invest a few more Yuan? If this one doesn’t hit, then it’s all your fault!”

As the two of them chatted, the big screen had already begun to announce the winning bid.

Naturally, some were happy while others were sad. Some raw stones were more popular, and hundreds of bidding sheets were received. However, there would only be one person who would win the bid in the end, which meant that many people were destined to return in disappointment.

Those who won the bid were naturally ecstatic, while those who didn’t were dejected. At the same time, they were full of anticipation to pay attention to the bidding situation of the next raw stone.

The fanatical atmosphere at the scene was really similar to the casinos of the old society.

Xia ruofei glanced at the screen and said with a smile,””I’m quite lucky to have bought one ...”

“Oh, really? Which one?” Song Wei quickly asked.

“Number 261!” Xia ruofei said.

This raw stone was also the one he had the most faith in. The reaction of the spirit painting scroll was almost the same as the raw stone that was highly likely to be the highest bid with a starting price of more than forty million. However, this raw stone’s starting price was only slightly more than four million, and the number of people paying attention to it was obviously much less than the original stone that was more than forty million.

Xia ruofei took into account the bidding situation of the others and finally invested 6.18 million Yuan. Naturally, he won the bid successfully.

“More than six million!” Song Wei could not help but exclaim,”you really have the guts to buy it! This is not treating money as money!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Anyway, I made quite a lot of money from yesterday’s cut. If this one really collapses, I’ll just treat it as buying it for fun. It’s just a little less profit, and I won’t lose anything ...”

“That’s a pretty good mentality!” Song Wei smiled and said,”I hope your luck is as good as yesterday!”

“Thanks for your kind words!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I wish you a fortune too!”

“Hehe, thank you, thank you!” Song Wei cupped her hands at Xia ruofei in a serious manner.

The bidding continued, and the second raw stone that Xia ruofei had his eyes on, Pi Xiu No. 468, was also announced. He won the bid without any suspense.

The starting price of this raw stone was 2.13 million Yuan, and Xia ruofei had invested 3.2 million Yuan.

As this raw stone was the most popular among the five raw stones that he had his eyes on, there were many people competing for it. The highest price was 3.15 million. Xia ruofei was not willing to give up on this raw stone, so he put in 3.2 million in the end.

According to the reaction of the spirit painting scroll, it should not be a loss to buy it for more than three million. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

When Song Wei knew that Xia ruofei had bought the raw stone, she was not surprised. The previous bid of over six million Yuan had already been won, so this three million Yuan was nothing.

She was getting more and more nervous as the bidding for the raw stone she had invested in was getting closer and closer.

Xia ruofei’s remaining three raw gemstones were numbered behind Song Wei ‘s.

Hence, Xia ruofei also started to pay attention to when the information of the raw stone would appear.

Number 500, number 530, number 560 ...

The messages kept rolling and finally, when a new message appeared, Xia ruofei saw the condition of raw stone No. 572.

He didn’t pay attention to the long string of numbers, so he naturally wouldn’t remember it. He was naturally concerned about the bid price.

120,000!

Xia ruofei was stunned when he saw the price. He had asked Song Wei to fill in 100000 Yuan because the starting price of the stone was 90000 Yuan. When he asked Song Wei to bid in the last few minutes, no one was interested in the stone.

However, the winning bid was actually 120000. Could it be that someone really came out to bid in the last few minutes, and with such a high price?

It can’t be this small, right?

Even if they won the bid, they would not earn much. However, Xia ruofei recommended it to Song Wei. If they did not win, they would not be happy.

At this moment, many thoughts ran through Xia ruofei’s mind.

Song Wei, who was beside him, was stunned for a moment. Then, she grabbed Xia ruofei’s arm and cheered,””Ruofei, it’s a hit! I bought it!”

There were many people like Song Wei at the public Jade bid, so her actions did not attract much attention.

Xia ruofei was stunned. He said,”Look carefully, the winning bid is 120000!”

“Yeah! 120,000 Yuan, I wrote 120000 Yuan!” Song Wei said excitedly,”I’ve checked the winning bid number. It’s me!”

Song Wei said as she waved the bidding slip in her hand.
