  "We're learning from each other and improving ourselves!" Wang Chi said with a smile.

  "President Xia, how do you feel after visiting our Supercomputing Center?" he asked Xia ruofei. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

  "The nation's most important weapon indeed lives up to its reputation!" Xia ruofei said seriously.

  "Haha!" Wang Chi laughed and said,"it seems like the light of Taihu territory has met Mr. Xia's requirements!"

  Wang Chi had been deeply involved in the design, manufacturing, assembly, and debugging of the light of Taihu territory. He could be said to be the leader of this project, so he was very proud of Xia ruofei's praise.

  Xia ruofei smiled."Of course. This is the best supercomputer in China and even the world. If it doesn't meet the requirements, then we can only hope that the alien civilization can help us!"

  "Hahaha!"

  Everyone laughed, and the Supercomputing Center's leaders also felt honored.

  "Academician Wang, President Xia, we've booked a room at the guest house," Cai Songlin said. "Please take a rest first, and then we'll have dinner together." The engine room will need to undergo a routine maintenance after it's shut down tonight. It'll only be back in use around 10 pm, so after dinner, everyone can go to the guest house to rest for a while. I'll send someone to inform everyone when the engine room is ready!"

  Xia ruofei thought for a while and asked,""Academician Wang, what do you think?"

  "Let's do as the host says," Wang Chi said readily."We'll follow director Cai's arrangements!"

  "Alright!" Xia ruofei said,"then I'll have to trouble you, director Cai!"

  "No trouble at all! It's no trouble at all!" Director Cai said quickly.

  "Director Cai," Wang Chi said,"director Xia has a few friends at the Xin Wu hotel. Don't forget to send a car to pick them up tonight!"

  "Oh! This has already been arranged, don't worry!" Cai Songlin said.

  "Yes!" Wang Chi nodded."Just let the driver contact Xiaoyi. He'll coordinate the people!"

  "Alright!"

  Under Cai Songlin's lead, the group arrived at the Supercomputing Center Guest House.

  The guest house was not far behind the supercomputer Center building. The first and second floors were canteens, and the third to sixth floors were guest rooms. There were thirty to forty rooms in total. It was clear that the reception work at the supercomputer Center was not light.

  Between the guest house and the computer room building, there were three - story auxiliary buildings on both sides. They were mainly spare parts warehouses, security staff dormitories, and so on.

  These buildings formed a small courtyard with a basketball court in the middle.

  The guest house had already prepared the rooms. They did not know about Xia ruofei's relationship with Ling Qingxue and Song Wei, so they gave everyone a single room. Because of the king's pool, the rooms were the best.

  Everyone rested in their rooms until evening. Cai Songlin personally went to the guest house to invite everyone down for dinner.

  They did not set up a banquet in the hotel. Instead, they invited Xia ruofei and the others to a private room on the second floor of the cafeteria.

  Obviously, the Supercomputing Center Guest House often received guests, so they were very confident in the skills of their chefs.

  In fact, the chef didn't let them down.

  The table was full of specialty Jiangsu dishes with fine colors, fresh, fragrant, and crispy. Just looking at them made one very appetizing.

  Jiangsu cuisine was sweet and light in taste, similar to the food at San Shan. That was why Ling Qingxue and Xia ruofei were used to it. Song Wei also liked sweet dishes and enjoyed them.

  As they still had important things to do at night, the Drunken Eight Immortals wine that Cai Songlin had specially prepared was not put to use. Everyone chose to drink fruit juice.

  As the director of the Supercomputing Center, Cai Songlin naturally had to put his work first, so he couldn't persuade him to drink.

  Without drinking, the banquet naturally ended early.

  At around eighto' clock, everyone had already eaten and drunk to their fill, and returned to the guest house.

  Everyone rested at the guest house for a while. At around 9:30, Chen Xuan and the others arrived at the park in the Supercomputing Center's Toyota Coaster.

  Hence, Xia ruofei and the rest went to the engine room and waited in the lounge.

  The engine room was undergoing a routine shutdown for maintenance.

  Cai Songlin didn't go back either. He stayed in the lounge and chatted with everyone while waiting for Yingying, mainly to accompany Wang Chi.

  Even though Chen Xuan, Liu Mansha and Mu Sheng were already Aurous core stage cultivators, they could not help but feel nervous.

  After all, the five Holy badges, or to be precise, the rising Dragon badge, had been passed on to all kinds of gods in the cultivation world for so many years. When everyone thought that the mysterious veil of the badge would be unveiled tonight, they became a little uneasy.

  On the other hand, Xia ruofei was still calm and composed.

  He didn't have the same feelings as Chen Xuan and the others. After all, the heavenly sect had spent decades collecting and studying the five Holy badges.

  Time passed by.

  When the clock on the wall pointed to 9:55, there was a knock on the door of the lounge. A technician in the computer room walked in and said,""Director Cai, the equipment has been repaired, and it is back to normal! It can be put into Use at any time!"

  "Alright." Director Cai nodded and said,"to make sure there's no problem, we'll need to do a more important data calculation immediately!"

  "The current equipment is running stably. All parameters are normal!" The technician said.

  "I know, you guys go and make your preparations!" Cai Songlin said.

  Then, he smiled at Xia ruofei and said,""CEO Xia, from now on until 8 am tomorrow morning, a total of ten hours of work time is yours. However, you must finish it by 8 am tomorrow morning. There are still many tasks waiting in line!"

  "The Supercomputing Center has always had a lot of work to do," Wang Chi said."President Xia, please understand!"

  Xia ruofei was not someone who did not know what was good for him. He immediately replied,""Director Cai, I'm already very grateful that you were able to coordinate ten hours for me in such a tight time!"

  "You're welcome! You're welcome!" Cai Songlin chuckled and said,"then ... Let's not waste any time. Let's go to the computer room!"

  "Alright!"

  This time, they were going to run the procedures directly. Therefore, Chen Xuan, Mu Sheng, Liu Mansha, and the others had to be there as well. Thus, the group of them left the lounge and headed straight for the computer room.

  After registering and entering the computer room, Cai Songlin said,""Director Xia, according to the regulations, only staff members can enter the control room. You have to copy the packaged program to us or directly copy it to this computer. Our staff can read the data through the internal network."

  Cai Songlin said as he pointed to a work computer at the side.

  This was a suite, and the control room was inside. The room outside was a little smaller. There was a large double - layer glass window on the wall between the control room and the room outside, which was similar to the studio and director room of a radio or TV station.

  Xia ruofei could tell that the room was designed for visitors. That way, they could see the control room without disturbing the staff.

  He pondered for a while and said with a smile,""No problem! Let's just copy it to this computer!"

  After saying that, he took out a portable hard drive from his bag and started to operate on the computer.

  "You put it in this shared folder, right?" Xia ruofei asked.

  "Yes, I am!" A technician called over by Cai Songlin quickly said.

  Xia ruofei took about five minutes to copy the data. Then, through the window, everyone saw the staff inside copying the algorithm program through the intranet and starting to run the program.

  Mu Sheng saw that the staff inside didn't seem to be doing anything. They were just sitting on the chair and monitoring the status and parameters of the equipment. He couldn't help but pull on Chen Xuan's clothes and asked in a low voice,""This is it?"

  "The calculation process is done by a calculator. We don't know how much time it will take. All we have to do is wait for the results!" Chen Xuan replied.

  Cai Songlin walked out of the control room and said,""Director Xia, there's no problem with the program. It's already running! You can wait for the results here, or you can rest in the lounge or guest house. "
