2691 The plan begins (1)

Xia ruofei arrived at the position of the cliff first. He agilely slid down the cliff to the position that he had marked last time.

He grabbed the rock with one hand and took out a shovel from the space with the other. He removed the tree branch that he had marked and started to dig.

The salty and wet air had eroded the rocks into the shape of a honeycomb. After Xia ruofei injected his essential Qi, he dug into the rocks easily.

It didn’t take long for him to dig a place to hide, so he put a little strength into his arms and curled up on the small platform that he had just dug out. He continued to dig sideways.

He spent about half an hour before he finally dug out the hole for the Jade pillar.

Xia ruofei stuck his head out and checked carefully. After confirming that the direction was correct, he put the shovel back into the space. Then, he took out the Jade pillar that he had prepared earlier from the spirit map space and carefully placed it into the hole.

Then, Xia ruofei slowly filled the hole with the gravel that he had dug out earlier. At the same time, he adjusted the position of the Jade pillar until the gravel filled the gap and the Jade pillar was fixed in the best position.

Xia ruofei filled up the rest of the rubble and then broke off some branches with leaves from the side to disguise the position.

In fact, as long as the array was activated, ordinary people would not be able to get close to the positions of the nine Jade pillars. If someone really wanted to destroy it by force, the array would automatically counterattack.

As for the days before the array was activated, ordinary people could not climb down this steep cliff. Even a cultivator with a high level of array skills would not be able to accurately identify the position of the Jade pillar without a detailed inspection of the entire natural array like Xia ruofei.

In addition, Xia ruofei had put on some disguises, so he should be safe.

After Xia ruofei set up the Jade pillar, he quickly climbed up the cliff like an agile ape. Then, under the cover of the night, he flew towards the base of the mercenaries on Peach Blossom Island.

The spot next to the mercenary camp was not for the Jade pillars. It was less important in the entire formation, and because the terrain was flat, it was much less difficult to set up.

Xia ruofei’s main focus was on the disguise after setting up the array. After all, this place was so close to the mercenaries ‘base. If he didn’t disguise himself well, the mercenaries might be able to see through him.

Xia ruofei could not guarantee that these guys with too much energy would not dig it open to take a look. If they really destroyed the place, they would have to rebuild it. If it was destroyed just as the formation was about to be activated, it would cause the entire formation to slow down and might ruin the big plan.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei was also an expert in disguises. When he was in the Army, he was always in the top few of the lone wolf assault team in this assessment. Now that he was a cultivator, especially with his spiritual power in the spirit gathering realm, his perception of the surrounding environment was many times sharper than before. Hence, after he set up his disguise, it could be said to be flawless. Even experienced Special Forces soldiers would have a hard time seeing through it.

After settling the two locations that he had to set up personally, Xia ruofei returned to the Sosnovka Military Base warehouse quietly. He did not alert anyone during the entire process.

The next morning, Xia ruofei was ready to return to Huaxia as planned.

Naturally, Li Yifu personally sent Xia ruofei to the airport. At first, Xia ruofei did not want Li Yifu to send him. After all, he was in charge of the renovation project. However, Li Yifu almost knelt down on the spot when he heard that he was not allowed to send him. Xia ruofei could only agree with a bitter smile.

After getting into the car, Xia ruofei returned to his original appearance.

From here to the airport, until boarding, they would not meet any outsiders. The airport of Peach Blossom Island was a private airport, and the car could directly drive to the tarmac.

The warehouse was right next to the airport, and it didn’t take long to walk to the tarmac, so it was even faster by car.

Xia ruofei gave Li Yifu a few simple instructions, especially a few important points. He emphasized them again, and then the car arrived at the tarmac. Paradise was already ready to take off.

Liu Qingfeng also rushed to the airport to send him off. Of course, he also knew Xia ruofei’s rules, so he came alone. He didn’t even bring a driver and drove his own car to the airport.

As soon as Xia ruofei got out of the car, Liu Qingfeng came up to him.

Xia ruofei smiled and shook his hand.””Qingfeng, it’s been hard on you during this period of time.”

“You’re welcome, President Xia. This is part of my job!” Liu Qingfeng said, somewhat flattered. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Xia ruofei pointed at Li Yifu and said,””During the time I’m not on the island, all work will be done according to boss Li’s instructions. You all have to obey boss Li’s leadership and cooperate with him to do the final cleaning work well.”

“Yes!” Liu Qingfeng quickly said,”I will definitely obey boss Li’s command!”

“Mr. Liu, you’re too kind,” Li Yifu said lightly.”We’re all here to complete the task assigned by Mr. Xia. We’ll work together in the future.”

Li Yifu was a big entrepreneur and had rich management experience. The management task Xia ruofei gave him was not difficult at all.
