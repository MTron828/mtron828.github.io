3073 The number one sect (1)

Xia ruofei knew that in Chen Xuan’s eyes, he was only a Qi refining cultivator. That was why Chen Xuan had brought the Clearwater flying boat with him. This was to prevent him from feeling awkward when he had to ride a flying sword.

Naturally, Xia ruofei would not reveal that he had broken the Kasaya. In fact, neither Chen Xuan nor the other cultivators he met at the auction had asked about Xia ruofei’s cultivation level. Now, Xia ruofei would not reveal that he was already an Aurous core beginner stage cultivator.

The group arrived at the rooftop, and sun Xiao followed them respectfully.

Chen Xuan took out the jadewater flying boat. The flying boat expanded rapidly and floated in the air quietly.

Xia ruofei secretly compared the blue water flying boat with his black flying boat and found that the blue water flying boat was indeed much worse. Whether it was the size, material, flying speed, or other factors, the black flying boat was much better.

“Brother Chen, I’ve troubled you to come out personally and even use the Clearwater flying boat. I’ve really troubled you ...” Xia ruofei said.

Chen Xuan laughed heartily.”There’s no need to be so polite, brother Xia. I’ve said it before. No matter how important you are to the heavenly sect, this is the courtesy you deserve!” Brother Xia, please!”

“Brother Chen, please!”

The two of them tapped the ground lightly with the tips of their toes, and their bodies floated up from the ground, landing firmly on the deck of the flying boat.

“This disciple will respectfully send young sect leader and young master Xia off!” Sun Xiao hurriedly bowed and said.

This time around, Chen Xuan did not bring any of his followers with him. Hence, he had to control the Flying Ship personally.

Soon, the jadewater flying boat rose into the air and flew toward the depths of Mount Tai.

Chen Xuan raised the flying boat and adjusted the direction. He smiled at Xia ruofei and said,””Brother Xia, we’ll be able to reach the first heaven society in no time if we take an airboat from tai city. Why don’t we go to the deck! While you’re at it, I’d like to invite brother Xia to enjoy the scenery of Mount Tai!”

“Sure!” Xia ruofei smiled naturally.

The two of them went to the deck and stood by the side of the ship.

Although this airboat was slower than the black airboat, it was much faster than most of the planes. However, because of the protective cover, there was no wind on the deck, and the flight was very stable.

Chen Xuan smiled as he introduced the scenery to Xia ruofei.

This was the area where Chen Xuan had grown up, so he was naturally extremely familiar with it. He was able to introduce the various scenic spots in a clear and logical manner.

At first, Xia ruofei could still see the tourists visiting Mount Tai below the swift Boat. Although the tourists were as small as ants in his field of vision due to the height of the flying boat, he could still see them clearly with the eyesight of a cultivator.

He could clearly see the tourists walking on the winding and steep mountain road.

However, it didn’t take long for the flying boat to fly over the scenic Area and enter the depths of the mountain range where few people visited.

Although these areas had not been developed, it was precisely because of this that there were fewer traces of man – made carvings and there was no trace of smoke and fire. The scenery was more natural.

“We’ll be reaching the mountain Gate soon!” Chen Xuan said with a smile.”Prepare to descend!”

In fact, Xia ruofei’s spiritual power had already sensed the traces of cultivators in the nearby mountains. This area was already a no-man’s land. The cultivators below were naturally the hidden sentries sent by the first heaven society.

Chen Xuan returned to the Flying Ship’s cabin and maneuvered the ship to descend slowly.

Xia ruofei stood on the deck and watched as the flying boat charged towards a mountain wall covered with vines without any signs of slowing down.

The speed of the flying boat was extremely fast. Xia ruofei could see that the mountain wall was rapidly approaching.

However, Xia ruofei was still standing calmly at the bow of the ship, ignoring the mountain wall that he was about to hit.

Actually, with his current attainments in the array Dao, he could already sense the array set up here from afar. As for this mountain wall, no matter how realistic it was, Xia ruofei’s spiritual power could sense that it did not exist. It was just an illusion created by the array, a simple smokescreen.

Even though it was just a smokescreen, the effect was still very good.

Not only was it a steep mountain wall in the eyes of ordinary people, but most cultivators who could not sense the array would only see it as a mountain wall even if they used their spiritual power to explore it. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Sure enough, the instant the flying boat came into contact with the ‘mountain wall’, it didn’t meet with any obstruction or impact. It directly entered the mountain wall.

Xia ruofei stood on the deck of the swift Boat. He seemed to see a ripple, and then the scenery in front of him changed.

A majestic mountain Gate appeared not far away. Behind the mountain Gate was a wide mountain road that meandered upward.

A series of ancient buildings were built against the mountain, scattered in an orderly manner within a radius of several dozen li. It was clear that this entire area was enveloped in a large array. Everything within the array’s range couldn’t even be detected by the satellites in space. In the photos taken by the Pi Xiu reconnaissance satellite, this was a primeval forest.

That was actually an illusion created by the formation. The real situation had long been concealed.

The spiritual Qi in the entire area was very rich. Xia ruofei sensed that it was almost at the same level as the Taixu xuanqing formation before the second transformation.

Near the mountain Gate, there were a few disciples wearing white Crescent – shaped clothes. They looked full of energy and were at least at refined Qi Level 5 and above.
