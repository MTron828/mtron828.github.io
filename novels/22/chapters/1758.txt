Chapter 1759: Uninvited guests (2)

Xia ruofei looked around. One of the old men beside Liu haofan was Ling Xiaotian’s good friend, du Qinghong. He was also a well – known figure in the field of metaphysics.

How did he end up with Liu haofan? Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be confused.

However, Ling Qingxue had already walked over quickly. Xia ruofei had no choice but to put his questions aside and follow her.

Zhao Yongjun came to Liu haofan with a faint smile on his face.””Haofan, why are you here?”

“Jun bro, why didn’t you invite me for such a big event?” Liu haofan grinned and said,”you’re treating me like an outsider!”

Zhao Yongjun said indifferently,”haofan, you’re a busy man!” We don’t dare to trouble you with such a small project. ”

“Aren’t you treating me as an outsider?” Liu haofan said with a smile,”I was the one who transferred this land to you. Now that the project is going on, I have to come and congratulate you!”

Then, Liu haofan said to his driver,””Bring the things over!”

The driver quickly took out a box that was half a meter long from the trunk and handed it to Liu haofan with both hands.

Liu haofan handed the wooden box to Zhao Yongjun and said with a smile,””Brother Jun, this is a small gift from me!”

Zhao Yongjun was even more confused. Did Liu haofan take the wrong medicine today? He didn’t look like he was looking for trouble, but more like he was here to support!

However, one shouldn’t hit a smiling person. Zhao Yongjun naturally couldn’t be cold to Liu haofan’s attitude.

Just as he was about to take it, Liu haofan said,””Brother Jun, there’s a Maitreya Buddha statue inside. It’s completely in the style of the Giant Buddha in harmony Palace, and it was even blessed by the old llama of harmony Palace!”

At this point, Liu haofan deliberately raised his voice and said,””I know the situation of this land the best. It’s a treasure land for the netherworld! It’s easy to attract unclean things if the yin Qi is too strong, so I’ve specially invited a Buddha statue for you, hoping to help suppress those evil spirits. After all, we still have to do business in the future!”

Zhao Yongjun’s face darkened. So all this was for this!

He pulled back his hand, then looked at Liu haofan coldly and said,””Haofan, I’ll welcome you if you want to celebrate, but if you’re here to cause trouble, don’t blame me for not giving you face.”

Liu haofan said innocently,”what are you saying, brother Jun?” I’m here to sincerely congratulate you! Even the congratulatory gift is full of sincerity. It has been a long time since the old llama of harmony Palace personally blessed the Buddha statue. I had to ask many people to invite this Buddha statue ...”

What happened here naturally attracted everyone’s attention. The guests who came to the groundbreaking ceremony had all heard of the rumors from before, so they couldn’t help but start discussing it in low voices.

With so many reporters present, Zhao Yong Jun’s anger was slowly rising.

He snorted and was about to speak when Xia ruofei’s voice came from behind him.””I didn’t expect young master Liu to know Feng Shui! We’ve never even heard of it. Why don’t you give us some more common knowledge?”

When Liu haofan saw Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue, the hostility in his eyes disappeared in a flash. Then, his eyes fell on Ling Qingxue. He did not hide the greed in his eyes as his gaze lingered on her long legs for a few seconds.

Xia ruofei frowned. He stood in front of Ling Qingxue and looked at Liu haofan coldly.

Liu haofan was stunned for a moment, then laughed and said,””I don’t know how to look at Feng Shui, but it’s not a problem to explain to you what a netherworld treasure land is. This piece of land was actually a place where Yin was gathered. It was the most suitable place to build a tomb, which would definitely bring good fortune to future generations! But to use it to build a club ...”

At this point, Liu haofan laughed and said,””President Xia, did you think I was out of my mind? Why would I give this land to you so cheaply ...”

Zhao Yongjun frowned. He didn’t understand why Xia ruofei would bring up this topic on purpose. Wasn’t this making Liu haofan even more aggressive?

Sure enough, after hearing Liu haofan’s words, the guests became even more nervous. The previous rumors couldn’t help but surface in their minds. Some people had originally planned to Buy Membership after the club was built to support Zhao Yongjun and the others, but now they were thinking of backing out.

However, a few people from the metaphysics world looked at Liu haofan with a strange expression. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Xia ruofei ignored Liu haofan. Instead, he smiled and greeted du Qinghong, who was beside Liu haofan.””Uncle du!”

Ling Qingxue also smiled at du Qinghong.””Uncle du, why are you here?”

When Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue appeared, du Qinghong had already noticed them. However, Xia ruofei was talking to Liu haofan, so du Qinghong could not greet them.

Now that both Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue had greeted him, he quickly replied,””RUO Fei, Qingxue, what are you doing here?”

Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”our company also has a share in this project!” Also, RUO Fei was a major shareholder! Today is the groundbreaking ceremony, so of course we have to come! Uncle du, I’m surprised that you’re here!”
