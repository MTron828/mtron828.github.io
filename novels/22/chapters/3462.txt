Chapter 3463: Top of the mountain (1)

Translator: 549690339

Daoist Qing Xuan’s body trembled. He turned to look at Xia ruofei in the bronze mirror. Xia ruofei’s eyes were bloodshot. His bones were broken and he was trembling from the pain. If it was any other person, they would have fainted from the pain. However, Xia ruofei kept his mind clear and even guided the huge pressure to train his body.

Even in the eyes of an Almighty cultivator like Daoist Qing Xuan, such a crazy move was unbelievable.

He saw the crazy aura that Xia ruofei was exuding and knew that immortal Shanhe was right. This kid was really aiming for the top and would do anything to achieve his goal.

A person who was so cruel to himself was truly terrifying.

Even Daoist Qing Xuan could not help but feel a chili in his heart. He said with a bitter smile,””Brother mountain river, I’ve learned a lot… This kid is only in the mid – Aurous core stage, but he’s so scary…”

Immortal Shanhe also looked at Xia ruofei in the bronze mirror and said,””The ones who are terrified should be our enemies. This child is in the same camp as us. The crazier he is, the happier we should be!”

“That’s reasonable!” Daoist priest Qing Xuan said,”I’m looking forward to his performance more and more … I’m very glad that I gave him an energy storage Pearl as a reward during the previous round. Otherwise, no matter how crazy he is, he won’t have enough Yuan Qi to use.”

Immortal mountain river pursed his lips and said,”even if my disciple doesn’t have the elemental storage Pearl, it’s still fine!” Furthermore, he obtained this elemental storage bead with his own abilities!”

“I’m just saying. I don’t mean to ask for a reward!”Taoist master Qing Xuan said in a bad mood.

“Everyone knows that Daoist brother Qing Xuan is impartial and incorruptible. How could you possibly play favorites?” immortal Shan He laughed. Right?”

Daoist Qing Xuan rolled his eyes and turned his head away, not bothering to pay any more attention to immortal mountain river.

This old man was a little arrogant now. Wasn’t it just that the disciple’s performance was a little better? He’s already starting to attack the sky, the earth, and the air?

Alright! Having such a disciple was really something to be envious of.

On the eighth level of the Tower of Trials, the Obsidian stairway.

Xia ruofei stood firmly on the four hundred and ninety – ninth step. He slowly released his Yuan Qi protection and gradually increased the pressure on his body.

This required his control to be extremely precise. If he released too little, he would not be able to achieve the effect of tempering his body. If he let go too much at once, his body would not be able to withstand the huge power and would likely suffer fatal injuries. The worse outcome would be that he would be thrown out involuntarily and stop at Level 499.

And all of this required him to endure the immense pain of his bone armor shattering while achieving precise control, which was obviously even more difficult.

People with weak willpower would not be able to maintain their consciousness under such pain, let alone control it precisely.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei’s will had always been strong. In addition, after his spiritual power had broken through to the spiritualization realm, his precision in controlling it had also improved. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Even so, what Xia ruofei was doing now was like dancing on the tip of a knife.

He was completely focused and did not dare to be distracted. He continued to draw in the squeezing force and tempered his body over and over again.

Xia ruofei couldn’t even remember how many petals he had used.

Fortunately, he hadn’t used the flower petals much recently, so he had a lot of them in stock. Under such circumstances, only the petals of the spirit Heart Flower had an immediate effect. Other methods would not be able to quickly recover the bone armor. Hence, even though Xia ruofei’s heart ached, he still used the petals decisively.

Now was not the time to save flower petals.

As time passed by, even Daoist Qing Xuan and immortal mountain river could not stand it anymore. Even through the copper mirror, they could feel the immense pain that Xia ruofei was going through.

Sometimes, when the pressure was slightly too much, the result would be very terrifying. The bones would be broken directly, and even the arms would be twisted irregularly many times.

If this kind of pain was endured in an instant, it would still be within the range of tolerance.

However, Xia ruofei was constantly enduring it and it had almost been an hour.

In other words, a person’s bones would be repeatedly broken and connected within an hour, and then immediately broken again. If it was someone else, they would probably die from the pain.

However, Xia ruofei was still standing firmly on the steps. However, because he was biting his teeth so hard, his lips had been bitten open countless times. Every time he used the petals of the spirit Heart Flower, the injury on his lips would also be healed. However, the blood on his chin remained. In addition, his muscles were twisted from the pain, making him look even more terrifying.

Xia ruofei had suffered so much pain, but he had to pay for it.

In this one hour, he slowly reduced the strength of the yuan Qi protection on the surface of his body, and his body also slowly adapted to the increasing pressure.

Right now, the strength of his Origin Energy protection was only half of what it was before, but his body was still able to withstand the increased pressure. In the cycle of breaking, healing, breaking, and healing, his body’s strength was growing at a rate that could be seen with the naked eye..
