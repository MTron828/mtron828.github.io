Chapter 1933 Prostrating on the ground (2)

In addition, because the news video mentioned that the incident happened in the West Lake Mansion community, the poster somehow found the information of the house registration. The owner of the house in the West Lake Mansion community building 3, room 1092, was Liu haojun!

The poster also analyzed that from the news video, one could see the lit Ferris wheel in the distance and a landmark building further away, the Baofeng building. The design of the building was very strange, as if it had been cut in the middle by a knife, so it was still very obvious from a distance.

Then, the poster posted the distribution map of the West Lake Mansion and the surrounding area. It could be clearly seen that the balcony of Unit 02 of Building 3 was facing the direction of the Ferris wheel and the Baofeng building. The angle was almost the same as in the video ...

In the end, the poster concluded that the news that was immediately deleted after the broadcast was so “short – lived” because the person involved in the news was Liu haojun.

At the end of the post, there was also Liu haojun’s resume, which made all the bottom – Level civil servants envious.

Xu Yougang was dumbfounded. He couldn’t help but ask,””Brother Xia, these ... Are all your masterpieces?”

From Xu Yougang’s point of view, only Xia ruofei could analyze so many things from an edited news video.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”I’m the one who provided the material, but I’m not the one who posted it. There are so many websites and forums, and I have to use different accounts to top the posts. I can’t finish it in such a short time even if I die of exhaustion!”

“That’s true ...” Xu Yougang also found that these posts were very popular, and there were a lot of replies. If it was all spontaneous replies from netizens, no matter how naive Xu Yougang was, he would not believe it.

Xia ruofei smiled.”A lot of things can be solved with money. Why should we put in so much effort and take the risk?” This is also the reason why I didn’t let you continue to be in charge of this plan, because the premise is that you have provided enough ‘shells’. Dangerous work like firing the cannons should be left to those who are not afraid of death!”

“Internet Water Army?” Xu Yougang also came to his senses.

Xia ruofei chuckled and nodded.””While you’re busy, I’m not idle either. I’ve already contacted three internet water armies in advance and paid them well. They’re ready to launch a tidal wave of public opinion attacks at any time.”

Xia ruofei paused and continued,””Tonight, I’m just going to prepare all the hot news after this news is posted on Weibo. Then, I’ll send it to the Internet Water Army, and it’ll be done!”

Xia ruofei made it sound easy. In fact, it was not easy to find so many valuable clues in the video in just half an hour, even with the answers and evidence. At least, Xu Yougang felt that he could not do it.

“Brother Xia, I’m really convinced!” Xu Yougang prostrated himself in admiration.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”okay, now you don’t have to worry, right?” Tomorrow, you can go and play in peace. You must be gone for at least ten days, and you are not allowed to come back before the time is up!”

“Yes!” Xu Yougang said.

“Also, don’t try to save money for me! You’d better spend that 200000 Yuan! They stayed in the best hotel, ate the best food, and played the best games! Just pick the best of everything!” Xia ruofei laughed.”But don’t mess around outside! I don’t want to affect your family’s harmony ...”

200,000 Yuan was only enough for a meal at a top club. However, if four people went on a vacation in China, they could definitely enjoy the best conditions.

“I know, brother Xia!” Xu Yougang said, touched.

“Don’t forget to save the money tomorrow. ” Xia ruofei reminded them again,”if you need money, use cash first. Try to avoid transferring large amounts of money into your account.”

“We’ll be careful!” Xu Yougang said.

Then, the two of them drank tea and chatted while paying attention to the situation of the troll Army’s overwhelming promotion on the internet.

……

At the provincial Hospital.

Liu haojun finally saw old Zhou.

Not only did old Zhou go to the West Lake Mansion to get his phone, but he also brought a laptop with him.

“Secretary, I took a look online before I came out. This matter shouldn’t have spread much. The main thing is that after the Weibo was deleted, many of the reposts can’t be seen anymore. I don’t think it’s a big problem.” Old Zhou analyzed.

“Yeah, but we can’t let our guard down!” Liu haojun said,”there are two things that are more urgent now. Give me some ideas. One is to shut Fang Chenchen’s family up. I understand what you mean, uncle fan. Spend as much money as you can and try not to cause any trouble at this time. ”

Old Zhou nodded.

Liu haojun continued,”the other thing is to eliminate the negative influence on the internet as fast as possible.” It’s best to get it done on the internet, but I can’t let my family know about it. I don’t have any good ideas for the time being ...”

“Secretary Liu, I think we should try to settle it with money first. I heard that some companies are quite powerful these days. They can help delete the posts with money ...” Old Zhou said after a moment of silence.

Liu haojun’s eyes lit up.

He was used to solving problems through connections because it was often the easiest and most convenient way for him. However, old Zhou’s words provided him with a new way of thinking.

“That makes sense!” Liu haojun said,”old Zhou, go and ask around. As long as there’s a company that provides this kind of crisis public relations service, money is not a problem!”

“Alright! I’ll immediately ask around!” Old Zhou said.

“Remember to keep it a secret!” Liu haojun said sternly,”don’t let it slip. If the old man finds out about this, I’ll really have to bear the consequences ...”

As soon as Liu haojun finished speaking, his phone suddenly rang.

He took a look at the caller ID, and his little heart couldn’t help but tremble. This was really what he said! It’s already so late, and the old man actually called me personally. What could it be?

Liu haojun had a bad feeling about this.

However, even if he had ten thousand guts, he wouldn’t dare to not answer the phone call from the old man. So, he made a shushing gesture to ol ‘Zhou, and then nervously swiped the phone to answer.

“Grandpa! It’s so late, why aren’t you resting?” Liu haojun tried to make his voice sound normal, but it was still inevitably trembling.

The majestic voice that made his heart tremble came from the phone.””How can I sleep with a good grandson like you?”

Liu haojun’s heart skipped a beat. He was already panicking.

However, he definitely couldn’t admit it at this time. What’s more, the old master didn’t say anything specific. What if something else made the old master angry? if he messed up, wouldn’t he be confessing?

Therefore, Liu haojun forced himself to say,””Grandpa, I’ve been pretty well – behaved recently! He had already devoted himself to the grassroots work. These few days, he had been busy coordinating an investment project for Changping County! Once this project can be settled in Changping, it can bring in thousands of jobs, and the tax revenue will also be substantial ...”

“Liu haojun!” The old master couldn’t take it anymore.”Enough! I didn’t call you to listen to you talk about these useless things!”

“Grandpa, what did I do wrong?” Liu haojun said innocently,”I really didn’t know! Tell me, I’ll definitely change!”

“You really don’t know?” the old man’s voice was cold. Liu haojun, I’ll just ask you one thing. Who is Fang Chenchen?” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

When he heard the name “Fang Chenchen,” Liu haojun felt as if his head had been hit by a heavy hammer. With a “bang”, he lost all ability to think ...
