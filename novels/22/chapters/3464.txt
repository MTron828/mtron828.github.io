Chapter 3465: Super genius (1)

Translator: 549690339

Immortal mountain river was so excited that he couldn’t sit still. He paced back and forth in front of the copper mirror and said anxiously,””This kid, why is he hesitating at this critical moment? Hurry up and go!”

This was directly reaching the top! It was much more exciting than breaking a record!

Normally, breaking a record was something to be happy about. After all, this record had been maintained for one to two hundred years. In the long years before this, the record had been even lower. If Xia ruofei could break the record, it already proved his amazing talent. He definitely could not escape the title of super genius.

However, this depended on what they were compared to.

If Xia ruofei was eliminated at around four hundred and eighty steps, it would be fine.

However, he was now on the five hundred and seventeenth step. He was only one step away from setting a record that would never be surpassed in the future.

It was definitely unprecedented, and there was even a high probability that it would never happen again.

The difficulty of the Obsidian stairway was too great. Even if an early Yuanying stage cultivator tried to climb the Golden core stage cultivator’s Obsidian stairway, he could not guarantee that he would be able to reach the top. Therefore, in the long years to come, it was likely that no one would be able to reach the top.

Even if there was such a genius, he would at most share this record with Xia ruofei. He would not be able to surpass Xia ruofei’s Obsidian stairway. The time was not counted. It did not matter how long it took. It just depended on how many steps one could last.

In fact, those who took a longer time would naturally have to withstand more pressure. To be able to reach the top after being in an environment with super pressure for a long time meant that their strength was even more amazing! VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

But now, Xia ruofei was clearly just one step away from the final stage, but he suddenly stood still on the 517th step. This was really bad for the two powerful cultivators who were watching him.

They looked on helplessly as Xia ruofei stood on the 517th step and started to train his body. They couldn’t help but look at each other.

The two of them realized a problem at the same time.

Qing Xuan smiled bitterly and said,””Brother mountain river, we’ve all overlooked a problem…”

Immortal mountain river also smiled bitterly and said,””Yup! We were preconceived … This child doesn’t know the situation of the last step, so he must be well – prepared before he dares to step up. He definitely doesn’t want to fail at the last moment!”

Taoist master Qing Xuan patted his forehead and said, not knowing whether to laugh or cry,”In the past, no one has ever been able to reach this stage. Even the few early Yuanying stage cultivators who tested the Obsidian stairway were not able to reach the second last step, so I didn’t consider this situation…”

Immortal Shanhe looked worried and said,””I don’t know how long he can last … The pressure on this step is already extremely great, and I guess he doesn’t have much Yuan Qi left. The reason why he’s stuck on this step now is because he’s not confident, and he wants to temper his body to make it stronger.”

Daoist Qing Xuan pursed his lips and said,””That can’t be helped … This is fair to every challenger, no one knows about the situation of the Obsidian stairway in advance. If it were you and me going through a similar obstacle, we’d definitely try to be as safe as possible before the situation is clear!”

“I’m just afraid that he’s too safe and will lose the big picture because of the small…” Immortal mountain river said with a frown.

Qing Xuan laughed and said,””Brother mountain river, you’re being a little too concerned. I’ve watched this child go through the trials one by one. Not only is he astonishingly talented, but he’s also very resilient. He’s also very bold. If he really can’t keep up with the vitality supply, even if he’s not fully prepared, he’ll definitely try his best to climb up! It wouldn’t be a joke to be eliminated in the second last level!”

“I hope so …” The worry on immortal mountain river’s face didn’t decrease much.

On the eighth level of the Tower of Trials, the Obsidian stairway.

Xia ruofei stood on the 517th step and carefully controlled the strength of his Yuan Qi protection. He gradually increased the pressure on his body and continued to use the seemingly cruel method to temper his body.

There wasn’t much vital Qi left in the elemental storage Pearl. Fortunately, he was constantly absorbing vital Qi crystals while he was operating the “great Dao chant” technique. He could more or less replenish some vital Qi, so he could still hold on for the time being.

Besides, ever since his spiritual power had broken through to the spiritualization realm, Xia ruofei’s fine control had improved greatly. Hence, he could accurately control the strength of his vital Qi protection, which increased the efficiency of his body tempering.

Now, every second he stayed in this environment meant an additional second of consumption. The more precise his control was, the better the tempering effect of his body would be.

Moreover, he could also very accurately estimate how long he could last. It was necessary to make as many preparations as possible, but the premise was that he couldn’t be eliminated on this level, and he had to reserve a certain amount of Yuan Qi for use on the next level. Otherwise, it would be meaningless to temper his body now.

Hence, even though Xia ruofei still looked very miserable, with his bones constantly being crushed or even broken, he was actually very calm and knew what was going on.

However, the bloody chin, the irregular distortion of his bones, and the involuntary trembling of his muscles due to the pain all made him look a little terrifying..
