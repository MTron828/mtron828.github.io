2774 The enthusiastic response (2)

Ling Qingxue’s eyes brightened when she heard this. Even though she did not know what Feng Jing said, she could tell from Xia ruofei’s words that he had posted a video on Weibo this afternoon and it seemed to have caused quite a stir.

Ling Qingxue immediately took out her phone and opened the Weibo app. She skillfully found Xia ruofei’s ID in the following list and clicked on it. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Xia ruofei was still on the phone with Feng Jing and did not care about what Ling Qingxue was doing.

“No trouble at all!” Feng Rao replied. How could there be trouble? Ruofei, your response is excellent! The netizens ‘evaluation of you is quite high! That’s why even though the guys and girls in the public relations department are busy, they’re still very happy!”

Xia ruofei could tell that Feng Jing was in a good mood. The video he had posted must have had a good effect.

In fact, this was how the public relations department worked. As long as there was public opinion, whether it was positive or negative, they had to act immediately and make the most appropriate response at the first moment.

If it was a negative public opinion, then needless to say, it was naturally necessary to put out the fire as soon as possible to minimize the negative impact.

If it was a positive public opinion, they would also have to immediately discuss the follow – up plan. The purpose was nothing more than to expand the positive impact as much as possible and further improve the company’s image.

For example, this time, when the company’s public opinion monitoring staff discovered Xia ruofei’s video response, they immediately followed up on the feedback data of various platforms and formed a preliminary public opinion report.

When the public relations department found out that the comments online were mainly positive, they quickly came up with a preliminary judgment and began to discuss the follow – up plan. This plan included how peach blossom company’s official account would respond and also suggestions on how to operate Xia ruofei’s personal account. They even had to consider how peach blossom company would commercialize their operations when Xia ruofei really went to war in the national football team, such as buying advertisements for the live broadcast of the competition. On Weibo and other platforms, there would be a lucky draw to give Xia ruofei the national football team’s Jersey.

Of course, there were some plans that required the involvement of the marketing department.

Under Feng Jing’s leadership, the cooperation between peach blossom company’s various departments was quite good. There were very few situations where the various departments would undermine each other or hold each other back. In most cases, everyone could work together. The entire company was like a precise operating instrument, and the work efficiency was very high.

Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s good that it’s effective. It’s almost the end of the year. I’ll give everyone a big red packet then!”

“I’ll remember your words!” Feng Rao chuckled and said,”I’ll pass the message to them later!”

“That’s why I called you,” Feng Jing continued,”you can take a look at it later and reply to the comments if you’re free.” In addition, the Chinese Football Association has contacted us. Their attitude is clear that they will give priority to your time. When you are free, the two sides can meet to discuss in detail!”

“Alright, thank you for your hard work, sister che.” Xia ruofei smiled.”I’ll contact you again when I’m free.” By the way, I’ll be leaving the three mountains tomorrow. If there’s anything, we can contact each other by phone or email!”

“No problem!” Feng Rao readily agreed.

Perhaps it was because Xia ruofei had performed well on Weibo and the results were good, Feng Jing was in a good mood. Hence, she did not complain about Xia ruofei’s habit of being the boss.

Xia ruofei had just hung up the phone when Ling Qingxue rushed over and said,””Not bad, young man! You’re really influential on the internet now! This Weibo video had only been out for two to three hours, right? There are already thousands of comments, and most of them are praising you!”

Xia ruofei let Ling Qingxue rest on his body and said with a smile,””How did they all praise me?”

“See for yourself!” Ling Qingxue said as she handed her phone over.

Xia ruofei took Ling Qingxue’s phone and browsed through the comments on Weibo. He realized that there were indeed many praises.

“I like President Xia’s feelings!”

“What a good ‘serving the country, duty – bound’! President Xia’s character was once again confirmed! You’re awesome!”

“I don’t know what’s going on, but President Xia just sat there and talked without any heroic words or stirring emotions, but I couldn’t help but have the urge to cry! As expected, I’m getting old?”

……

These were the comments with the highest likes, so they were listed in the top comments section.

Xia ruofei continued to read, and the style changed. For example, there was a comment that also received high likes: Look at President Xia, his net worth is at least a few billion! To manage such a large company, playing football was just a hobby, but he could say that it was his duty to serve the country. Compared to some of the current players in the national football team, you are afraid of being injured in the national team game and delaying your return to the club to make money. You just take a walk on the field and play health football. Are you worthy of the national team’s robes you are wearing? Was it worthy of the national emblem on his chest?

It was estimated that several National Football players would have mixed feelings when they saw such comments!

What made Xia ruofei not know whether to laugh or cry was that someone had also dissed Wu Lei. Of course, no one could deny Wu Lei’s hard work. Therefore, the dissing was nothing more than wasting opportunities, frequently falling into the offside trap, and the most criticized and ridiculed thing about him was that he could not fight alone.

Xia ruofei thought to himself,”did Wu Lei get shot?” He wouldn’t blame me, would he? Hahaha ...

Although the general public opinion was full of praise and praise, the internet world was so big. There were so many people online. Naturally, there were some who were unconventional and stood out. It was also possible that these people did not like Xia ruofei and wanted to criticize him. This situation was too common on the internet.

No one could be as popular as Chinese yuan.

Someone left a comment in the comment section,”it seems like he wants to be special!” Why is it that everyone else can follow the national team’s recruitment and arrangement, but you, Xia ruofei, are different? Is it because you’re richer?

Xia ruofei didn’t even need to refute these brainless comments as they were spontaneously abused by a bunch of fans thousands of times.

“We’ve captured a bar spirit alive! Everyone, come and watch!”

“President Xia is not even a registered player of the Chinese Football Association. He is not engaged in professional football, and he usually has so much work. It is already commendable that he can actively respond to the country’s recruitment, but someone actually criticized him. This is simply ...”

“I’m really sorry, everyone. We didn’t close the door of the mental hospital tightly and let this thing out! It’s all our fault, Qingshan mental hospital. ”

“It’s not because President Xia is rich, but because he uses the keyboard better. ”

At the end of the comment, there was a picture of a keyboard man who was widely circulated on the internet.

Xia ruofei laughed out loud. He then looked through his own Weibo and private messages and was surprised to find that the Chinese Football Association had also reposted his Weibo with the words: [I’ve already contacted peach blossom company. Thank you, President Xia, for your patriotic feelings!] He was looking forward to the meeting between the two sides!

Xia ruofei gave the Chinese Football Association’s Weibo a like and passed the phone to Ling Qingxue.

Ling Qingxue glanced at Xia ruofei and said,””You must be very proud of yourself now, right?”

Xia ruofei chuckled and replied,”it’s nothing much!” I just feel that the fans are very cute, uh ... Even if they’re anti – fans, they’re actually quite cute. ”

“Aren’t female fans cuter?” Ling Qingxue asked.

Xia ruofei immediately sensed danger and quickly changed the topic. He laughed dryly.””We’re going to Beijing tomorrow. I’ll go and pack my luggage first ...”

With that, Xia ruofei got up and left in a hurry. Seeing Xia ruofei’s figure running away, Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but burst out laughing.
