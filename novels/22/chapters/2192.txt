“What are you saying ...” Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”You still don’t believe me ...”

“I believe you! I believe in you! “That’s enough ...”Ling Qingxue said with a smile.

Xia ruofei leaned the mop against the wall and said,””Wife, I’m done mopping the floor. Do you want to sleep in the guest room? I’m going to clean up the place!”

Ling Qingxue glared at Xia ruofei and said in an unfriendly tone,””What do you think? Could it be that someone wanted to steal my body from another room after I fell asleep?”

Ling Qingxue could stay in the same room as Feng Ye or Xia ruofei, because she could at least keep an eye on one of them. However, she was definitely not going to sleep in the guest room alone. Otherwise, what was the point of staying at Xia ruofei’s house?

Xia ruofei chuckled,”you’re the one who took the initiative to stay in the same room as me!” I didn’t force you, right?”

Ling Qingxue finally understood Xia ruofei’s intentions. She could not help but say in embarrassment and anger,””Why are you so bad!”

Xia ruofei laughed and put his arm around Ling Qingxue’s shoulder.”I was just joking! Wife, who told you to joke with me first?”

“Hmph! You only know how to bully me!” Ling Qingxue twisted her body, trying to break free.

However, Xia ruofei’s grip was very tight, and Ling Qingxue did not really use much strength. So, not only did she not manage to break free, but she was also pulled into Xia ruofei’s arms.

Ling Qingxue clattered and hit Xia ruofei’s chest with her pink fist. She said,””You’re so bad ... You’re so bad ...”

Xia ruofei stretched out his leg to hook the door of the room and closed it. Then, he carried Ling Qingxue by the waist and strode towards the soft bed.

This bed was chosen by Ling Qingxue and Xia ruofei together. It was three meters wide and had a size – made latex mattress on top. It was soft and had a hint of elasticity. The two of them had dated in this villa a few times, and this big bed was definitely the “main battlefield”.

Now that the flames of war had risen again on this “main battlefield,” waves of heart – shaking murmurs accompanied by the creaking of the bed were like a Symphony that made people blush and their hearts beat faster. The bedroom was suddenly filled with Endless Spring light ... F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

After a long time, the two of them finally stopped and snuggled up against each other to rest.

Ling Qingxue’s face was still flushed as she said,””Why are you so lecherous? If sister ran, who is downstairs, hears this, how can I still be human? It’s so embarrassing ...”

Xia ruofei said nonchalantly,”the soundproofing of this house is pretty good!” How could it be heard so easily? Unless you’re stupid enough to arrange a room for her just below our bedroom ...”

Ling Qingxue tilted her head and tried to recall. Then, she let out a scream, and her face, which was already flushed, became even redder.

“What’s wrong?” Xia ruofei caressed Ling Qingxue’s smooth skin and asked with concern.

Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei in embarrassment and stammered,””I ... I think I’ve really lost my mind ... What should I do?”

Xia ruofei sat up immediately. He stared at Ling Qingxue and asked,””Wife, you’re not joking? There are a few guest rooms downstairs! You ... Are you sure you’re really going to stay in the room just below our bedroom?”

Ling Qingxue nodded silently.

Xia ruofei rubbed his forehead and was speechless. After a while, he said with uncertainty,””Qingxue, we ... We didn’t make much noise just now, did we?”

“I think so ...” Ling Qingxue also had an awkward expression on her face.

The two of them looked at each other and covered their faces with the blanket at the same time. Then, they couldn’t help but laugh again.

Xia ruofei lifted the blanket and said,”let’s not care about that!” It’s already done anyway, there’s no medicine for regret!”

Then, Xia ruofei reached out and touched Ling Qingxue’s shoulder.””Wife, why don’t we ... Have another fight? Let’s keep it a low profile this time ...”

Ling Qingxue was so scared that she quickly wrapped herself tightly with the blanket and said,””Absolutely not! Ruofei, stop joking ... Sister ran is just downstairs! Don’t play any more tricks tonight! Otherwise, I’m really going to sleep in the next room ...”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”I was just saying ... Oh right, wife!” I still have something good to give you!”

Ling Qingxue peeked her head out from under the covers, her hands still gripping the corners of the blanket tightly.””What is it?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”just wait!” I’ll go get it!”

He naturally thought of the two types of fruits he had collected on green travel Immortal Island. He had originally planned to give a few to Ling Qingxue, but in the afternoon, he thought that Ling Qingxue wouldn’t be coming over tonight, so he had temporarily placed them in his spatial ring.

Xia ruofei got off the bed and opened the drawer with his back facing Ling Qingxue. After blocking her view, he took out a dark red fruit and a dark purple fruit from the medium. He held the fruit in his hand and walked back with a smile.

“Here!” Xia ruofei handed the fruit over.

“What is this? How come I’ve never seen this fruit before?” Ling Qingxue asked.

“Don’t ask so much, you’ll know after you eat it!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”let’s eat the red one first ...”

“Oh!” Ling Qingxue pouted.

She obediently picked up the red fruit and took a bite. She immediately felt her mouth full.
