2064 Multi – pronged approach (2)

Of course, Xia ruofei would not correct Rossi’s misunderstanding. He just smiled and said,””I’m saying that yesterday’s acupuncture was only the beginning of loosening up your meridians. Today, I’ll use a variety of techniques and medicine to treat you. If you’re so excited about the little effect yesterday, then you’ll be so excited that you won’t be able to sleep in the days to come.”

“Xia,” Monica said with a smile,”if he can really stand up again, I’m sure Rousey will be willing to go without sleep for a few days!”

“Of course!” Rousey said excitedly,”Mr. Xia, let’s start the treatment!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. He went forward to help Luo Si up and let him lie on the bed. Jian Jia called it ‘help’, but Luo SI’s legs could not exert any strength at all. Basically, he had put all the weight on Xia ruofei. However, Xia ruofei still managed to complete it easily.

Xia ruofei took out a silver needle and said while disinfecting it,””The acupuncture point for today’s acupuncture is on the upper body. Rousey, take off all your clothes on the upper body!”

“Mr. Xia,” Rousey said in surprise,”my problem is in my legs. Why did I have to do it on my upper body?”

Of course, he was just curious and did not question Xia ruofei’s decision. When he asked the question, he had already started to unbutton his shirt. Monica came over and helped him take off his shirt.

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”I told you yesterday that Western medicine treats headaches and feet pains. If it can’t be cured, it’s simply amputation and organ replacement. However, it’s different. Traditional Chinese Medicine focuses on the balance of yin and yang and treats the human body as a comprehensive system to regulate. So, it’s not unusual to use acupuncture on the upper body to treat leg injuries.”

“Chinese medicine is really unfathomable, Mr. Xia. I was really ignorant yesterday,” said Rosey with a nod.

Xia ruofei smiled and motioned for Rousey to lie down. Then, he picked up a silver needle with two fingers and moved as fast as lightning.

Monica, who was at the side, only felt a blur in front of her eyes. A silver needle as thin as a cow’s hair was stuck in Rossi’s chest.

Rossi did not feel much as he lay there, but Monica could see it clearly. The long silver needle had actually pierced a large portion of it. Most importantly, the silver needle was very thin, as if it would break if she was not careful. She had not seen Xia ruofei use much strength, but he had easily pierced that much.

Xia ruofei’s expression was very focused. His hands moved quickly and decisively. His eyes did not even blink. In the blink of an eye, he had inserted the silver needles into five acupuncture points.

Then, he used the Xinglin Sanzhou acupuncture technique and gently twisted the silver needle.

Actually, it was a little scary to see so many silver needles being inserted, but Rossi did not feel too much pain. The main reason was that most human nerves felt pain on the surface of the skin. The silver needles were thin and Xia ruofei’s technique was clean. Rossi felt like he had been bitten by a mosquito.

However, when Xia ruofei started to perform the acupuncture technique, a warm current immediately came from the acupuncture points and flowed slowly along the meridians. It felt like bathing in a hot spring. It was so comfortable that Rosi almost cried out and even felt like falling asleep.

Xia ruofei twirled the silver needle as he said,””Rousey, you should be feeling warm right now, and the part where the needle was inserted will feel a little sore. These are all normal reactions, so don’t be nervous. If you feel any other discomfort, tell me immediately!”

“Got it,” said Rosey, nodding.

After about 30 minutes of acupuncture, Xia ruofei kept the silver needles in a specific order.

Monica hurriedly came forward and used a hot towel to wipe Xia ruofei’s forehead. Actually, Xia ruofei was not sweating. She was just expressing her concern.

Xia ruofei smiled at Monica and said,””It’s fine, I’m not tired!”

“Luo Si, how do you feel now?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Mr. Xia,” Rousey said,”I feel a little warm in my legs, and a little itchy below my calves, like many ants are crawling!” Mr. Xia, the feeling today is even stronger than yesterday!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”the channels and collaterals are cleared step by step. Naturally, the effect is getting better day by day.” If you can feel the numbness and itchiness, it means that the purpose of the acupuncture has been achieved. ”

“That’s great!” Rousey said excitedly.

Although the itch wasn’t very comfortable, it really made him feel the existence of his two legs.

Xia ruofei said,”I’m going to massage the area below your knee. The process might be a little painful. You have to bear with it.” If you really can’t hold it in, it’s fine if you scream out loud. We won’t laugh at you. ”

Xia ruofei said as he rolled up Rossi’s pants to cooperate with the treatment. Rossi had specially worn a pair of loose pants today so that he did not have to take off his pants awkwardly.

“Mr. Xia, I’m not afraid of pain,” said Rosey nonchalantly. What I’m most afraid of is not being able to feel any pain. That would simply make people ... Ah!”

Luo Si could not help but cry out in pain as Xia ruofei had already started massaging his calf. The intense pain caused him to cry out subconsciously.

Monica could not help but take a deep breath. Actually, she had seen everything clearly. Xia ruofei did not seem to have used much strength and had only pressed down twice casually. She did not know why Rousey had such a big reaction.

“Rousey, are you okay?” Monica asked worriedly.

Rousey gritted his teeth and said,”I’m fine. This feeling is great. I ... I haven’t felt pain in my legs for many years. It’s reminding me that my legs are still ... Still growing on my body.”

When Rossi was speaking, Xia ruofei did not stop massaging. He was very accurate in finding the acupuncture points. With the stimulation of a small amount of essential Qi, the pain was actually very strong. However, after Rossi was mentally prepared, he gritted his teeth and did not make a sound.

Xia ruofei said while massaging,””Don’t talk so much. You can save your strength this way. ” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Rousey was in so much pain that the muscles on his face twitched, but he still squeezed out a smile and said,””It’s ... It’s okay ... I can take it ...”

In fact, Rousey’s smile was a little sinister under the stimulation of the pain. Monica was even more worried. At the same time, her heart ached when she saw her brother in so much pain.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei did not massage for long. He stopped after about ten minutes.

At this moment, Rousey’s body looked as if it had been splashed with water. He was sweating a lot, and the sheets under him were wet.

“Mr ... Mr. Xia, is it ... Over?” he asked, panting.

“The most painful process has ended.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”there won’t be much pain in the next treatment. Rousey, your willpower is very strong. I’m more confident in healing your leg!”

“Thank you!” Rousey said weakly. He had been enduring the pain and had consumed a lot of energy.

“Take a rest first. Next, we’ll start applying the ointment.” Xia ruofei said as he stood up.

He first went to the side and brought over the earthenware pot with the ointment and placed it on the stool next to Rousey’s bed. Then he took out a new pair of butonened gloves from his pocket, tore open the package, and slowly put them on.

Then, Xia ruofei grabbed a ball of ointment and applied it on Rousey’s leg. He said,””After the acupuncture and massage, your channels and collaterals have been cleared up quite a bit. Now is the time when your qi and blood flow is at its smoothest, and you can better absorb the medicinal properties of the ointment.”

As he spoke, he spread the ointment evenly on Rousey’s leg.

When the ointment touched his skin, Rousey could not help but take a deep breath ...
