2903 Ambitious and ruthless_

Charlie unhurriedly picked up a high – intensity light that he had prepared earlier and turned it on, shining it towards the sea.

At this time, Davis had just emerged from the sea, desperately breathing. Although his hands and feet were injured, he had been good at swimming before, and the buoyancy of the sea was relatively large, so he did not sink. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Of course, this was only temporary. Davis was illuminated by the strong light and subconsciously closed his eyes. Then he immediately shouted,””Charlie, don’t kill me ... I beg you ... Please pull me up!”

As soon as the wounds on his body were soaked in the sea water, he felt a piercing pain, but he didn’t feel it. There was only one thought in his mind, and that was to beg for mercy.

He was too afraid of death!

Charlie looked at Davis, who was struggling on the surface of the sea, with a complicated expression, and shouted,””Davis, everyone has to be responsible for their own actions, and you are no exception! So ... You’d better personally repent to God!”

After saying that, Charlie took a few steps forward and picked up the heavy anchor.

The anchor had been connected to Davis by a long rope.

Davis endured the pain as he stepped on the water and tried hard to look up. When he saw Charlie once again come to the deck railing with the big iron anchor in his hand, he couldn’t help but wail in despair.”No! No! Charlie, you ... You should Just Shoot Me!”

This way of dying was too terrifying and too painful! The fear in Davis’s heart was growing wildly.

Charlie was unmoved. He only coldly looked at Davis, who was struggling in the water, and muttered,”Farewell! Little brother!”

With that, he threw the anchor in his hand out.

Charlie was very strong. The iron anchor flew out with the rope and fell into the sea with a plop.

Dai Weisi’s eyes revealed endless despair and hatred, he cursed out loud: “Charlie! You won’t have a good death! I won’t let you go even if I become an evil spirit! I curse you forever ... Gugugugu ...”

Before he could finish his sentence, he was pulled into the sea by the sinking iron anchor, and then he sank to the deep sea involuntarily.

With a strong light in his hand, Charlie watched as Davis was pulled into the sea by the iron anchor. Only a few bubbles emerged, and the sea surface quickly returned to calm.

At this moment, his mood was extremely complicated. He felt the joy of revenge, but also a trace of loss.

His only blood – related younger brother in the world had been dealt with by his own hands ...

Charlie held onto the deck railing with both hands and kept taking deep breaths.

Of course, to be able to control one of the top super consortiums in the United States and even the world for so many years, Charlie was naturally a fierce and ambitious person. His killing decision was unimaginable to ordinary people, and his psychological endurance was by no means comparable to ordinary people. He quickly calmed down and began to calmly deal with the follow – up matters.

He couldn’t drive such a super yacht back alone, but he didn’t plan to drive it back at all.

Before getting rid of Davis and the others, Charlie had already thought about what to do.

He gathered his emotions and walked to the first deck with ease. There was a lifeboat hanging on the side of the yacht. He lifted the tarpaulin on the lifeboat and climbed inside to check the emergency supplies. Then, he returned to the deck and began to arrange the various cabins.

Charlie had already made up his mind to give up on the yacht. Even though it had cost him more than a billion dollars to build this super – Luxury yacht, and it was also his favorite yacht, so many people had died on it. He would definitely not be able to use it in the future. Most importantly, so many crew members and staff members were dead, and even their bodies were sunk into the sea by Davis’s men. Then, Davis and his men were killed. The only survivor was Charlie, and he would not be able to explain himself if he went back.

Therefore, his only choice was to sink the yacht and get into a lifeboat to ask for help. After being rescued, he naturally announced to the public that he had encountered a sea disaster and that he was the only one who had escaped with his life.

Although this situation was somewhat unreasonable, with Charlie’s status, as long as there was a valid reason, no one would hold it against him.

As for Davis, he naturally never appeared on this yacht. Davis had snuck into this yacht, and no one knew except for a few of his trusted subordinates who had participated in the operation, so Davis ended up missing.

Davis was not married and had no children. In the end, the small number of shares in his hands would be inherited by Charlie.

This luxurious yacht was well – equipped. Charlie liked this yacht the most and often went out to sea on it. Therefore, he was very familiar with the structure and some special functions of this yacht. He quickly packed up the things he needed to bring along the lifeboat, then found a few pieces of TNT with timer devices from the small Armory of the yacht and placed them in several key positions on the yacht.

When he first bought the yacht, the seller specifically emphasized to him that these positions were relatively weak. In case of special circumstances, if he wanted to abandon the ship but did not want to leave the yacht to the enemy, as long as he blew a hole in those positions, the yacht would sink soon.

Charlie set the detonation time to 20 minutes, then hurriedly released the lifeboat. He quickly got into the lifeboat and left the yacht far away.

This lifeboat was the type that had power. Charlie drove it a few hundred meters before stopping the lifeboat. He looked back at the yacht that was still brightly lit in the distance with a complicated expression.

After a while, there were a few dull explosions in the distance. Charlie saw the yacht shake a few times. Then, a large amount of seawater probably poured into the cabin, and the yacht began to sink slowly.

The process of sinking was quite fast. After a while, the yacht was completely silent. After a few splashes, the sea finally returned to calm.

Charlie heaved a long sigh of relief, then took out the satellite phone from the emergency equipment bag of the lifeboat. He found the built – in 24 – hour help line for the yacht company and directly dialed it.

……

After Xia ruofei left Charlie’s yacht, the short distance of ten kilometers was covered in a blink of an eye. He returned to his own small yacht.

“Master!” Luo Qingfeng quickly stood up and called out.”Master!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”you can continue to regulate your breathing.” Let’s rest for an hour and then continue our journey!”

“Yes! Master!” “Yes!” Luo Qingfeng quickly responded.

Xia ruofei also sat cross – legged on the deck of his yacht. As he circulated the “great Dao Sutra” to recover, he also split a bit of his spiritual power to pay attention to Charlie’s situation.

Xia ruofei had already given the decision to Charlie. No matter what decision he made, Xia ruofei would not interfere. However, if Charlie let Davis go, Xia ruofei would be more or less disappointed in him. In Xia ruofei’s opinion, this was undoubtedly a woman’s benevolence.

What Charlie did not know was that the eastern deity had not gone far. After that, his every move had been monitored by the deity.

Xia ruofei saw how Charlie dealt with the murderers decisively and even ended Davis ‘life in a relatively cruel way. He could not help but nod and think,”This guy was indeed a formidable person! He was so cruel to his own brother!

Xia ruofei had thought that Charlie would at most kill Davis with one shot. He did not expect Charlie to choose such a cruel way to die for Davis.

After that, Charlie began to make arrangements for the follow – up. Xia ruofei was no longer interested in it. He retracted his spiritual force and started to concentrate on recovering his elemental energy.

As the consumption was not huge, Xia ruofei did not even use origin crystals or spiritual crystals. Instead, like Luo Qingfeng, he directly absorbed the spiritual Qi in the air to replenish his own losses.
