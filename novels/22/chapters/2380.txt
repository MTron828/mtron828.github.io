2381 Taking in the captives (2)

He glanced over indifferently, and Bao Guijun and the others quickly went back to work, afraid that their master would be unhappy because they were lazy.

Xia ruofei felt like laughing. If Bao Guijun and the rest knew that the old man they were teasing was their former boss, the highest leader of the modr organization, what would their reaction be?

However, it was unlikely that he would be afraid. After all, everyone’s status was the same here. Furthermore, Manzilla did not look like he was very strong, even though he could kill ten people in seconds when he was up against an opponent like Bao Guijun.

Bao Guijun and the others didn’t recognize the famous Satan, but there was one person in the crowd who definitely recognized him.

It was none other than the man Xia ruofei had caught in his Manor, the Viper, Boak.

He was in a complicated mood. After being hypnotized by Xia ruofei, he did not hesitate to reveal Satan’s identity, his hiding place, and other key information. After waking up, he could still remember everything that happened during the period of hypnosis, so he was very clear that he was the one who betrayed Manzila.

As a matter of fact, the only person who knew Manzila’s identity was Mr. Boak, so the crowd did not make any noise and instead looked at the kind – looking old man.

Meanwhile, bouaker hid himself in the crowd. He hoped that Manzila would never find him, because he was filled with guilt and regret, and he felt too ashamed to face his boss.

Manzilla himself had lost all of his drive. He said,”Thank you! By the way, su Cai should be your alias, right? How should I address you?”

After Xia ruofei entered the medium, he returned to his original appearance.

However, as a practitioner, Manzila had long discovered that the aura of this yellow – skinned, black – eyed Asian man was almost exactly the same as that of the Siamese Susai who had easily defeated him. In other words, the two were the same person.

Manzilla also quickly determined that this was the real face of the person in front of him. It was most likely a disguise because Xia ruofei now had absolute control and did not have to worry about his identity being exposed.

Xia ruofei smiled.”My surname is Xia. You can call me Mr. Xia.”

“Yes, Mr. Xia!” Manzila said respectfully. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei nodded and looked at the group of captives.

Some of the captives had seen Xia ruofei before, but now that he had changed back to his original appearance, they could not recognize him. Most of them were caught in their sleep and did not know who had tricked them.

Even so, everyone knew very well that their fate was in the hands of this young man in front of them. In addition, the faintly discernible sharp aura that Xia ruofei was exuding made these captives very reverent. No one dared to look him in the eye.

The corner of Xia ruofei’s mouth curved up slightly. With a thought, his entire body was lifted up by the invisible force of space. With a whoosh, he stopped firmly in the air as if he was standing on flat ground.

Xia ruofei looked down at the group of captives. In the eyes of the captives, he was as majestic as a God.

He said indifferently,”I’m Xia ruofei, from Huaxia in the East!” From the moment you were captured, I was your master!”

Xia ruofei spoke in English. The people in the modr training camp came from all over the world and English was the international language. Most of the people present could understand it. The few who could only speak arulei were naturally confused and did not know what Xia ruofei was talking about.

However, Xia ruofei did not mind. After all, there were only a few people who did not understand. After they came down, they could ask each other and they would know what they had said today.

In fact, there were already some captives who understood arulei’s local language and were translating for the people around them in a low voice.

Xia ruofei did not speak very fast. This was to give those who were not good at English some time to understand.

He continued,”the place that everyone is in right now is my personal little space. You can also think of it as a paradise that is isolated from the world. In short, from today onwards, you will work for me here in exchange for living supplies.”

Xia ruofei’s words also fell into the ears of Bao Guijun and the others. They were all slightly shocked. In fact, their experience in the space had made them have this guess, especially Bao Guijun and Huang rujue. They had been to the outside world and found themselves outside of Basoko town. This meant that the owner of this small space could carry it with him wherever he went.

But after hearing Xia ruofei’s confirmation, Bao Guijun and the others couldn’t help but have a different feeling. They knew that it was basically impossible to escape from this place in this lifetime.

Fortunately, they had been intimidated by Xia ruofei’s strength and had no intention of running away. Hence, they did not have a mental breakdown.

However, the captives weren’t so calm. After hearing this, many of them couldn’t help crying.

Xia ruofei glanced at everyone indifferently and shouted,””Quiet down!”

“Other than being isolated from the outside world, this place is basically full of benefits! For example, the environment is unique and far away from the hustle and bustle of the city. ” Xia ruofei continued,”if you live here for a long time, your body will get better and better. You won’t have to wander around and live a life of blood! As long as you work hard and obey master’s orders, you’ll be able to live a comfortable life without any danger!”

After saying this, Xia ruofei paused and observed the expressions of the captives.

These four words described Xuanji as someone who had lost their parents.

He continued,”everyone has the right to choose!” Those who choose to stay, I welcome you! People who don’t want to work for me ...”

When the captives heard this, they couldn’t help but reveal a look of hope.

Could it be that those who were unwilling to stay could regain their freedom? It was said that the Chinese army had a tradition of giving preferential treatment to captives during wartime. Those who were willing to stay were given uniforms and weapons so that they could join the battle. Those who were unwilling to stay were separated on good terms. Sometimes, they were even given a small travel fee ...

However, these people were destined to be disappointed and even desperate.

How could Xia ruofei give up on a piece of fat meat in front of his mouth? Furthermore, Xia ruofei did not hide his name at all, nor did he hide the fact that everyone was in a small space. How could he risk the secret of the spirit map and painting being leaked and release the captive?

Xia ruofei paused for a moment and continued,””For those who don’t want to work for me, I’m very willing to give you a one – way ticket to heaven! Those who are unwilling to work in exchange for survival can take a step forward!”

Faced with Xia ruofei’s undisguised murderous intent, everyone could not help but shrink back and feel a wave of despair.

It was better to live than to die. These mercenaries who believed in money, who would be so stupid as to give up their lives than to surrender to the ‘enemy’?

Hence, after Xia ruofei finished speaking, he waited for a while. In the end, no one stood up.

“Very good! Everyone has made a very wise choice!” Xia ruofei said, satisfied.

His expression said,”I didn’t force you, it’s your own choice”, which made the captives feel angry and funny at the same time. What was the difference between such a choice and not having a choice?

Next, Xia ruofei said indifferently,””Since you’ve chosen to stay, then you must follow the rules here. My rules here are simple, basically, to trade labor for survival. As long as you put in enough labor, you can get survival supplies! Another important point was to obey! It was absolute obedience! Anyone who disobeyed orders would be killed without question! Your supervisor will inform you of the specific rules!”

Xia ruofei nodded to Xia Qing.

Xia Qing immediately understood and stood up beside Xia ruofei. She also stood in the air.

“This is your supervisor, Xia Qing. From now on, you will listen to his commands!” Xia ruofei said
