Translator: 5496903As soon as Xia ruofei finished speaking, the cheers in the meeting room almost blew the ceiling off. The employees who were taking over the team were all smiling.

Although everyone knew that Xia ruofei had always been generous, the reward that Xia ruofei gave this time was beyond their expectations.

Xia ruofei looked around and said with a smile,””Brothers of the song family, this time, you should go to Spain with the employees of our paradise Corporation and have fun for a few days! Relax, relax!”

The song family’s support staff also showed joy when they heard this. They were all professionals working in the song family’s group company. The leader was an outer disciple of the song family, named Song Yong. He knew more about the family affairs. His main task was to prevent the Liu family from leaving any hidden hands in the handover process.

“Thank you, director Xia!” Song Yong replied respectfully. However, we don’t need it. After the mission here is over, we have to go back and report!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”time doesn’t conflict!” We won’t be leaving so soon! Go back to the capital first and wait for our notice. No declining! I’ll let the song family know. ”

Song Yong knew about Xia ruofei’s close relationship with the song family. He knew that Xia ruofei only needed to say the word to give them a few approvals.

Song Yong did not dare to disobey Xia ruofei’s arrangement. Besides, this was a good thing. Even if he did not care about traveling abroad, it was a very attractive benefit for his employees. Besides, he could also make friends with Xia ruofei. Even for Song Yong, it was very attractive.

Therefore, Song Yong no longer hesitated. He stood up and bowed slightly,””Then we’ll thank you, President Xia!”

The few people sent by the song family also thanked Xia ruofei happily.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”you’re welcome!” You’ve helped us a lot this time. I should be the one to thank you!”

Wang Jian and Lu Weifeng felt awkward in the conference room that was full of laughter. Xia ruofei was giving them a big bonus, but of course, the Liu family would not get a share. Even if he gave it to the security guards at the door, he would not give them a single cent as a reward.

However, they could not leave. They could only sit in their seats awkwardly and look at the people around them smiling.

Xia ruofei turned his head and said,”Yanan, please register everyone’s passport information. There’s no need to contact the travel agency for the time being. Everyone just needs to be prepared.”

“Yes, Chairman!” Qin Yanan immediately replied.

Xia ruofei smiled and said to Xue Jinshan,””You’re going to Kanayama too! You’re not allowed to take leave! He could take this opportunity to relax and recuperate. Hurry up and assign your work to the others!”

“I see, Chairman,” said Xue Jinshan with a forced smile.

Xue Jinshan could tell that Xia ruofei was insistent on letting him rest for a while. Although he still could not let go of the work at hand and was a little resistant, he felt warm inside.

Then, Xue Jinshan couldn’t help but ask,”Chairman, why are you traveling to Spain this season? Is there any special arrangement?”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”I might as well reveal to everyone here that we have yet to make other arrangements for this trip to Spain. However, we will definitely be going to Barcelona. If everything goes well, we will also arrange for everyone to visit the Spanish football club. If any of you are fans, you will be in luck!”

Xue Jinshan loved to watch and play football in University, but he had almost no time to pay attention to it after he started working. But at least he knew about football.

Hence, Xue Jinshan could not help but ask,”Spanish? Chairman, if you’re going to Barcelona to visit the football club, shouldn’t you go to Barcelona?”

The world – famous Barcelona’s home ground, nokapu Stadium, was not as unattainable as everyone thought. When the fans were open, everyone could buy tickets to visit.

Normally, if one wanted to visit a Stadium or a Football Club in Barcelona, the first choice would definitely be nokapu. As for the RCD Espanyol and their home stadium, El Pratte, one might not have even heard of it if one was not a senior La Liga fan. Many people did not even know that the RCD Espanyol was also in Barcelona.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”there must be a reason for choosing a Spanish club!” I’ll keep you in suspense for now, but I’m sure everyone won’t be disappointed!” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

After listening to the report and announcing the benefits, Dong Yun invited Xia ruofei to have a meal in the canteen of the pharmaceutical company. After the meal, Xia ruofei inspected the entire pharmaceutical company with Dong Yun and the others.

The group of people accompanied Xia ruofei on the Toyota Coaster of the pharmaceutical Group. They looked around the entire factory area. Although it was just a cursory view, Xia ruofei still had a deep impression of it.

After returning to the company’s guest house, Xia ruofei said to Dong Yun and Xue Jinshan,””I can see that the conditions of this Pharmaceutical Group are very good, and the infrastructure is also very good. There are still two sub – factories that I haven’t visited, but after listening to your report, I can see that the conditions there are also very good. You must make good use of these unique conditions and speed up the pace of development!”

“Understood!” Dong Yun and Xue Jinshan replied in unison.

Xia ruofei then pointed at Xue Jinshan and said,””Of course, speeding up the pace of development does not require you to risk your life. It is still the same sentence: you must be a qualified leader, not an old yellow cow who works hard! Do you understand?”
