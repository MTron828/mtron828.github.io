Chapter 767: Xiao hei’s Meritorious Service (2)

“Understood!” Xia ruofei nodded heavily.

Soon, Guo Zhan contacted the other assault team members who were on standby through a secret phone and asked them to hurry to Sanshan University.

Then, the three of them prepared to open the manhole cover and enter the sewer.

Xia ruofei walked to the side of the manhole cover. Tian Feilong immediately came over and prepared to help the workers open the manhole cover. There were special tools. They hooked the holes on the manhole cover and lifted it up easily. Now that they did not have any tools, even if they were much stronger than ordinary people, it would not be easy to open the manhole without any force.

However, Xia ruofei waved his hand to indicate that there was no need.

He squatted down and used his fingers to grab a small gap on the edge of the manhole cover. He pushed it hard to the opposite side, making the gap as big as possible. Then, he put his fingers in and lifted the manhole cover with a light push.

It was easy now that he had a point to exert force on. Xia ruofei held the cover with one hand and gently lifted it up and put it aside as if he was holding a ball of cotton.

Guo Zhan looked at Xia ruofei in surprise. He thought to himself,”not only did this kid not regress after he left the Army, but he also seems to have grown a lot stronger!”

Xia ruofei patted Blackie’s head and said,””Xiao hei, continue to track that smell after we go down. However, there might be enemies inside. Remember not to make any sound!”

Blackie had already gained sentience, so it immediately nodded.

Guo Zhan and Tian Feilong, who were watching from the side, couldn’t help but be secretly amazed. To be able to train the dog to be as human as little black was really not an easy thing to do!

After Xia ruofei finished speaking, he reached out to hold Blacky and prepared to go into the water.

“Wait a minute, Blood Wolf!” Guo Zhan shouted. There might be danger down there, I’ll take the lead!”

......

This was also a tradition in the Chinese army. When there was danger, the commander would always take the lead.

“Wolf King,” Xia ruofei said,”we’ll have to rely on Blackie to track us down. It only listens to me, so I have to be at the front.”

This reason was very sufficient, and Guo Zhan had no way to refute it. He pondered for a moment, then took out a pistol from his waist and handed it to Xia ruofei.”The main equipment is in the hands of the other comrades. You can use this gun!”

It was naturally the most dangerous to be at the forefront. Guo Zhan had also handed the only weapon he carried with him to Xia ruofei.

After Xia ruofei took the gun, Guo Zhan took off his coat and prepared to give Xia ruofei the bulletproof vest he was wearing.

Xia ruofei quickly waved his hand and said,”Captain, there’s no need for the bulletproof vest!” You can wear it yourself!”

With that, Xia ruofei kept his gun and sat down at the entrance of the sewer. He held Blacky in one hand and grabbed the ladder at the side with the other. Then, he nimbly got into the sewer.

Xia ruofei was very confident in his current strength. Even if he was caught off guard, his extraordinary reaction speed would definitely allow him to avoid danger in time. On the other hand, Guo Zhan and the others wearing bulletproof vests was equivalent to an extra layer of protection, so he firmly refused to accept the bulletproof vests.

Guo Zhan tried to pull him back but failed. Xia ruofei had already entered the sewer. He didn’t dare to delay and quickly followed Tian Feilong into the sewer.

Tian Feilong, who was at the back, didn’t forget to move the cover of the well that Xia ruofei had placed aside to cover it, in case any teacher or student accidentally fell in.

There was an extremely unpleasant smell in the sewer. Xia ruofei frowned slightly and reached into his bag. In fact, he took out a dozen disposable masks from the spirit map space. He took three and put them on. Only then did the smell subside a little.

He gave the remaining masks to Guo Zhan and Tian Feilong.

“Blood Wolf, you’re quite well – equipped!” Guo Zhan said, somewhat surprised.

Xia ruofei grinned and did not explain further.

As for black, he could only bear with it. Firstly, there was no mask that suited his specifications. Secondly, Xia ruofei still needed him to track his scent. How could she cover her nose?

There was also a thin layer of dirty water in the sewer, which was disgusting to step on. However, to Xia ruofei and the other two, they had been through much worse situations than this many times. This was a piece of cake.

On the other hand, little black had always lived in the picturesque spirit map space with rich spiritual energy. As soon as he entered the sewer, especially when he stepped in the sewage, he was very uncomfortable at first. After a while, he reluctantly walked forward.

Guo Zhan and Tian Feilong were both equipped with multi – functional combat watches, which could achieve a simple air monitoring function. If the air quality in the sewer was seriously life – threatening, the watch would immediately vibrate to give a warning.

The stench in the sewer was very strong, and it caused a lot of interference for Blackie to distinguish directions.

It sniffed and hesitated for a while before deciding on a direction to go.

The waterway was accessible in all directions. Without Blackie leading the way, Xia ruofei and the others would not have been able to find the route that the group of people had taken.

Blackie walked in front while the three of them followed closely behind.

The three of them subconsciously lightened their footsteps. Xia ruofei and Tian Feilong also held their loaded pistols tightly in their hands, keeping an eye on the situation in front of them.

In such a dark and narrow environment, once they encountered the enemy, the situation would be very dangerous. Even if the enemy fired randomly, they were likely to be hit by stray bullets.
