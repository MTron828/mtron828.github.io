Chapter 756: Starry Night rescue (2)

One person sacrificed, another person sacrificed ...

These four words were like a heavy hammer pounding on Xia ruofei’s heart.

Although the lone wolf assault team was a high – ranking force, it did not have many members. This type of Special Forces assault team was made up of elite soldiers. Those who were selected were the elites of the elites. Hence, Xia ruofei was very familiar with all the comrades in the assault team. Everyone had a very good relationship with each other.

The death of one person meant that a familiar comrade would leave him forever. Xia ruofei had only retired for about a year. Even if there was a new member in the lone wolf assault team, it was impossible for him to be sent out to carry out an important mission that even Guo Zhan had to personally take action. Hence, the possibility of the death was high.

There was a Wall of Heroes in the lone wolf assault team’s history Library, on which every comrade who had died was printed. Lin Hu was the 165th and the latest one.

Now, there was another comrade who used to crawl and roll on the training ground with him, sweating like rain, but he was about to become an icy photo on the Wall of Heroes.

Xia ruofei felt as if his heart was being cut by a knife. He could not help but clench the steering wheel tightly.

“Little Xia! Little Xia!”

Niu Tao’s voice brought Xia ruofei back to his senses. He said, “I’m sorry, brother bull, I was distracted ...”

“We’ve missed the intersection ...” Niu Tao said helplessly.”Let’s go back a little!”

“Oh! Alright!”

Xia ruofei immediately put the car in reverse and drove the car back a dozen meters. Then, he turned left according to Niu Tao’s instructions and continued driving.

Finally, the car stopped in front of an eight – story building with white tiles on the outside.

......

This was the specialist building of the General Hospital, which specialized in treating leaders of the garrison system at the Deputy military level and above, as well as leaders of the provincial level and above. It was similar to the South Building of the 301 Hospital.

The wounded were definitely not qualified to stay in the specialist building, but the lone wolf assault team was an exception. Every member of the lone wolf assault team was the heart of the military region’s chief. Moreover, the injured was in a critical condition, which was a matter of life and death. Therefore, the chief of the military Region personally called to coordinate, and the General Hospital naturally provided the best medical resources immediately.

Xia ruofei and Niu Tao got out of the car and ran up the stairs. Niu Tao flashed his special pass at the Sentry post and the two of them ran into the building without any obstacles.

He took the elevator to the sixth floor. As soon as he got out of the elevator and came to the corridor, Xia ruofei saw the wolf King Guo Zhan, who he had not seen for a year.

Guo Zhan was wearing a black tight – fitting short – sleeved T – Shirt and a pair of army green tactical pants. His body was stained with a lot of dust. He leaned against the wall of the corridor, and his face clearly showed a trace of fatigue.

This was something that Xia ruofei had rarely seen in his entire military career. Guo Zhan seemed to be always full of energy. Whether it was in battle or training, his sharp tiger Eyes were always full of energy, as if he never knew fatigue.

But today, Guo Zhan’s eyes seemed to carry a trace of fatigue, and even a trace of confusion. It was obvious that the accident in the mission this time had dealt him a heavy blow.

“Wolf King!” Xia ruofei’s voice was trembling.

After leaving the Army for more than a year, Xia ruofei had a relationship. He even had a night of fun with the Italy beauty Monica. His business was also doing well. However, the moment he saw the old Chief of the Army, Xia ruofei seemed to have returned to the military camp in a straight line and square blocks, back to the danger – filled tropical jungle, back to the unforgettable time when he took a bullet for his brothers and comrades ...

Guo Zhan raised his head abruptly. When he saw Xia ruofei, his eyes seemed to be burning with hope again.

He quickly took a few steps forward and said,”Blood Wolf!” I heard that you’ve successfully treated many difficult – to – treat illnesses after you retired from the Army. Are you good at detoxification?” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Wolf King, what’s the situation now?” Xia ruofei asked calmly,”which brother is injured? What’s the exact situation?”

Xia ruofei knew that the situation of the injured must be very urgent, so he held back his grief and did not ask which of his comrades had died.

It was important to prioritize matters. This was the first lesson that Guo Zhan had taught Xia ruofei after he joined the lone wolf assault team. This included rescuing injured comrades on the battlefield. There was a priority, which was not simply differentiated by the severity of injuries.

“Jin Gang was the one who was injured,” said Guo Zhan. “He was shot in the abdomen, which penetrated the lower lobe of the liver, the stomach, and the intestines. The bullet stopped at the lower left side of the abdomen. After the specialists from the General Hospital tried their best to save him, the bullet has been taken out ...”

Xia ruofei pursed his lips and said,”the bullet was dipped in poison?”

Just now, Guo Zhan had asked him if he was good at detoxification, so he had already guessed it.

Guo Zhan’s expression dimmed and he nodded,”Yes, if it’s just an external injury, it won’t be life – threatening. The real problem is the poison on the bullet. The bullet stayed in the abdominal cavity for a long time, and the poison has already entered the blood. The General Hospital used an antiviral serum, but it didn’t work. It should be an unknown poison, and flamy is in a very dangerous situation now!”

“Didn’t the General Hospital collect any blood samples for analysis?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Of course there is!” Guo Zhan said. However, we have basically confirmed that this is an unknown poison, and it is quite difficult to detoxify it. Now, the specialists in the General Hospital are having an emergency consultation to try a new treatment, but Xiao Ling ... I’m afraid she won’t be able to hold on for long!”

When Guo Zhan said this, he couldn’t help but punch the wall heavily. His soldier was lying on the hospital bed, and the god of death was approaching step by step, but he was powerless. This feeling made Guo Zhan feel so much pain that he wanted to die.

A child – like face flashed across Xia ruofei’s eyes.

Jin Gang was a first – Class Sergeant, who was now called corporal. He had joined the lone wolf assault team three years later than Xia ruofei and was very popular in the team. Everyone took good care of this nineteen – year – old little brother.

“Wolf King, take me to see Xiao Ling immediately!” Xia ruofei replied,”I might have a way, but ... The hospital ...”

“You don’t have to worry about that!” Guo Zhan was indeed Xia ruofei’s old chief. The tacit understanding between the two did not weaken with the passage of time. Xia ruofei had only spoken halfway when Guo Zhan had already understood his thoughts.”Just follow me!”

With that, Guo Zhan led Xia ruofei along the corridor for more than ten meters and arrived at the door of the intensive care unit. As Jin Gang’s vital signs were very unstable and his condition was extremely dangerous, he was directly arranged to be in the ICU after the operation.

The chief of the military Region had personally called to ask about this matter, so what Xia ruofei was worried about did not happen. Guo Zhan only went over to negotiate a few words, and the hospital immediately agreed to let Guo Zhan and Xia ruofei enter the intensive care unit.

After strict disinfection, the two of them wore sterile clothes and went to the ward where Jin Gang was.

Jin Gang was lying on the hospital bed and had fallen into a coma.

The patient had been seriously injured and had just undergone a major operation. Because of the blood loss, one side of the patient’s face was somewhat pale.

However, Jin Gang was different. His face had a layer of dark gray, and even the skin on his body was the same color. It was obvious that the poison had entered his body through the blood circulation. If he did not treat it in time, Jin Gang’s life would soon be lost.

Guo Zhan turned his gaze to Xia ruofei. Since they met, Xia ruofei had been very calm. This old subordinate that he had personally selected from the field army back then seemed to have changed a little after being away for more than a year. He was so calm that he seemed to be more grounded.

There was no doctor on duty in the ICU. The experts were all in an emergency meeting to study the detoxification treatment plan. The nurse was also waiting outside. Only when Jin Gang’s vital signs showed major signs and the instrument gave a warning would the nurse call the doctor in an emergency and rush in to do emergency treatment.

This was also the most ideal environment that Xia ruofei needed. He did not want to be disturbed by others while he was treating Jin Gang.

Xia ruofei nodded slightly to Guo Zhan, then took the responsibility to sit in front of Jin Gang’s bed. He grabbed Jin Gang’s hand and began to take his pulse.

Guo Zhan looked at Xia ruofei anxiously, hoping to get some useful information from the change in Xia ruofei’s expression. However, Xia ruofei kept his eyes closed and his face was as calm as an ancient well.

After a while, Xia ruofei let go of Jin Gang’s hand and took out a leather bag from his bag.

After unfolding it on the bedside table, Guo Zhan saw that it was a whole set of acupuncture silver needles.

Xia ruofei undid Jin Gang’s shirt and used two fingers to pick up a long silver needle. Then, without hesitation, he accurately inserted the silver needle into the shenfeng point on his chest ...
