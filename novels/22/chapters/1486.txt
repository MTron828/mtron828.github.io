Chapter 1487: Array Dao inheritance_1

Translator: 549690339

Even though he was prepared and had adjusted himself to his best state, Xia ruofei still couldn’t help but groan when the massive amount of information poured into his mind. The veins on his forehead bulged out and he looked like he was in great pain.

He guarded his heart and kept his mind clear, his body trembling slightly.

Fortunately, he had the experience of receiving the inheritance from the Jade talisman once. Xia ruofei did not panic and persevered with his strong will.

The process of passing down the inheritance might have been very fast, but Xia ruofei felt as if a hundred years had passed. He was drenched in sweat again.

After the legacy was over, Xia ruofei heaved a long sigh of relief. His entire body was at ease.

Xia Qing’s eyes narrowed. She came in front of Xia ruofei, bowed slightly and said,””Congratulations, master. You have successfully obtained the inheritance of the earth character jade talisman.”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and said weakly,””This process is really too painful. When I think about how I have to go through it again in the future, I feel like dying ...”

“This is an unparalleled opportunity for cultivators,” Xia Qing said with a smile.”If cultivators from the outside world can get such an opportunity, even if it’s a hundred times more painful, they’ll still be happy!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand weakly and said, “I’ll take a rest first and check out my gains this time ...”

“Yes!” Xia Qing said with a bow, and then quietly retreated to the side.

Xia ruofei sat down on the recliner by the spirit pond and crossed his legs. He started to sort out the things he had gained from the inheritance.

The main content was naturally the cultivation techniques from Level 4 to Level 6 of the great Dao Arts.

In fact, he only needed to practice the first level of the “great Dao Arts” during the Qi cultivation stage. This set of cultivation techniques pointed directly to the Dao of heaven and earth, allowing him to practice to a very high realm.

Hence, the content was not of much use to Xia ruofei now. He skimmed through it and felt that it was too profound and obscure. He knew that he had not reached the required realm and would not be able to understand it even if he read it, so he gave up.

Other than these three levels of cultivation techniques, the earth jade talisman did not pass on many miscellaneous books and records like the human jade talisman. Of course, it was not as if he had gained nothing.

Xia ruofei inspected the Jade talisman and realized that other than the cultivation techniques from Level 4 to Level 6 of the great Dao technique, the earth character jade talisman also “gifted” six books.

The contents of the inheritance were directly projected into Xia ruofei’s mind. With a thought, he naturally knew the contents of these six books.

Without exception, all of them were related to array Dao.

Could it be that the cultivation of the last three levels of the cultivation method required the knowledge of array Dao? Xia ruofei thought to himself.

However, this was a matter for the future. Xia ruofei did not think too much about it. He was thinking that Xia Qing had suggested him to work hard to break the protective barrier of the earth jade talisman. He must have known the contents of the earth jade talisman long ago.

Therefore, at this stage, the only thing that was useful to Xia ruofei was this knowledge of arrays.

Xia ruofei didn’t think too much about it. After all, it didn’t hurt to have more skills. He didn’t hesitate and started to “read” the books in his mind.

Because of the characteristics of the inheritance, these books were already reflected in his mind, so Xia ruofei read them very quickly.

Lines of mysterious words appeared in his mind. He should have felt that they were rather obscure, but Xia ruofei did not have any difficulty in understanding them. It was as if he had been born with this knowledge and had already mastered it.

Reading through everything once was just to make this knowledge more integrated and truly become his own knowledge.

After studying the array knowledge, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but sigh.”The path of cultivation was truly profound. Just this knowledge of arrays was enough to make Xia ruofei feel as if a door was slowly opening.

In the past, according to the education that Xia ruofei had received since he was young, these magical things were no doubt pseudoscience. However, now, it was clear that his entire knowledge system had been subverted. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The Dao of formations was as vast as the ocean.

The array books in the earth jade talisman were all top – notch. Xia ruofei had received so many high – end books at once. His array skills had undoubtedly improved from beginner to expert.

The array Dao covered a wide range of content. According to its different functions, it could be divided into trapping array, killing array, illusion array, concealment array, sound – isolating array, and so on. Of course, the spirit gathering array and protective jade talisman that Xia ruofei had come into contact with before were also a type of array.

Even the primordial realm of the spirit map realm, where time flowed 30 times slower than the outside world, was also the effect of the array. However, this level of array was something that Xia ruofei could not reach at his current stage.

In essence, every array was formed by countless array patterns. These array patterns were like the molecules and atoms that made up matter. They were the basic components of an array. It was the arrangement of various array patterns that made the functions of the array completely different.

After Xia ruofei had completely digested this knowledge, he couldn’t help but feel a sense of awe. This was actually a huge system, and its scale was no less than the scientific system of human society.

Xia ruofei did not doubt that the array techniques he had mastered could be put to good use.

He opened his eyes, stood up, and walked to the side of the spirit pool. After stretching his body, he turned around and looked at Xia Qing.
