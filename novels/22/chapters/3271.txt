Although Xia ruofei’s spiritual power was invisible, it could actually be used. Furthermore, within the range of his spiritual power, the speed was extremely fast.

Of course, mental strength couldn’t be used directly to cause a serious physical attack to the enemy. In terms of pure strength, it was very small. It was naturally not a problem to use it to control things and the like. It was also not a big problem to use mental strength to trigger the possible information of traps.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power quickly and accurately touched the position of the first light spot, raising clouds of Moondust.

The moment his spiritual power touched that spot, Xia ruofei immediately felt a trace of abnormality under the 10 – centimeter – thick lunar dust. This spot was obviously different from the other spots. There was a standard round stone slab below. His spiritual power could even feel a trace of spiritual power on this small stone slab.

Xia ruofei didn’t think too much about it. He quickly touched the stone slab with his spiritual power. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

This was only the position of the first light spot. According to the demonstration in the illusion, although the eight light spots seemed to be connected and lit up, there were subtle differences in their order.

Hence, Xia ruofei controlled the eight wisps of spiritual energy at the same time and probed the eight spots of light.

This was also thanks to his profound spiritual power cultivation, which allowed him to control it to the finest detail.

After the first light spot was touched, the remaining seven spots were touched by Xia ruofei’s spiritual power in sequence and time.

The entire set of actions could be said to be done in one go.

Shen tianfang, Chen Xuan, and the others nodded in agreement at Xia ruofei’s actions. At the same time, they made a comparison in their hearts. If they were in Xia ruofei’s shoes, would they be able to do it so easily? Could it be accurate to the point where it was not the slightest bit off?

In the end, Chen Xuan, Yang Liu, and mu Hua, the three Aurous core stage cultivators, came to a conclusion. Even they themselves could barely do it without error, but they definitely couldn’t do it as easily as Xia ruofei did.

Shen Tian made a comparison in his heart and felt that he could only reach Xia ruofei’s level at most. After all, he was an intermediate golden core cultivator!

In fact, Shen tianfang’s spiritual power cultivation was slightly inferior to Xia ruofei ‘s, but he did not know it.

When Xia ruofei’s spiritual power quickly touched the positions of the eight light spots, everyone held their breath and stared intently in front of them, afraid of missing any detail.

However, nothing happened after all eight encounters.

Everyone felt a little startled.

Xia ruofei was the first to react. Without any hesitation, he followed the time difference in the demonstration and immediately started the second attempt.

After he finished, he repeated it for the third time.

In the illusion that everyone had experienced, the eight dots of light had lit up three times in a row. The order and rhythm were exactly the same each time.

Hence, when there was no reaction after the first contact, Xia ruofei made a decision in a split second. He would do it three times as demonstrated in the illusion.

In fact, Xia ruofei was still very confident.

This was because his mind power had already detected that the positions of the eight spots of light were not ordinary lunar soil under the floating dust. Instead, they were all circular stone slabs of the same color.

It was possible for one or two of these standard – shaped objects to be naturally formed, but for eight of them to be exactly the same, and in the exact same position as in the illusion, this was definitely not a coincidence.

Xia ruofei was sure that the eight round stone slabs were man – made.

After all, this was the dark side of the moon, a place where humans from the secular world had yet to set foot in. There were only two possibilities for an artificial object to appear here. One was that it was left behind by aliens. Wasn’t there always a rumor that there were mysterious aliens living on the dark side of the moon and that they were constantly monitoring earth? The other possibility was that it was left behind by a cultivator.

Considering that these eight positions completely coincided with the positions of the light spots in the illusion, it could be basically confirmed that these were left behind by the cultivators.

In fact, after Xia ruofei’s spiritual energy had circulated three times, the eight positions immediately began to emit a blinding light, just like how it was demonstrated in the illusion.

Beams of light shot into the sky.

There was no air on the moon, so when everyone looked up, all they could see was the Dark Universe.

And these 8 pillars of light, also shot straight up, directly shining into the universe space.

The order in which the light pillars lit up was the same as the order in which Xia ruofei touched them. In other words, the light spots that appeared in the illusionary realm were exactly the same.

Then, a gourd – shaped ceramic instrument slowly rose.

The moment the ceramic instrument appeared, Xia ruofei and the other golden core cultivators couldn’t help but look at it. They all shouted in unison,””Spatial dimension laws!”

That’s right, the moment the instrument appeared, the Golden core cultivators felt an obvious fluctuation in the rules of space.

In other words, the ceramic instrument looked like it was rising from a thick layer of lunar dust in the demonstration, but it was actually summoned from a small space. However, after it appeared, it began to rise again, so it looked like it was being lifted up from the lunar dust.
