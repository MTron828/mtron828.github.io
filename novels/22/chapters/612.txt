Chapter 613: Special cigarettes (3)

“Yes, yes, yes!” Ye linyun quickly replied,”I’m almost done with this box of cigarettes. I only have one left!”

“Then you can take it!” Xia ruofei said.

“Thank you, brother Xia!” Ye linyun said excitedly.

He immediately took out an almost empty cigarette box and carefully put the remaining cigarettes into it.

Xia ruofei found it funny and said,””If you like it, take a few more boxes! This cigarette is a little light, I’m not used to it ...”

“No need, no need,” ye Lingyun quickly replied.”This is enough. These are cigarettes from the chief, I don’t dare to take more!”

Xia ruofei smiled and started the car again.””Alright then! You can ask me for more after you’re done! We’re brothers, no need to be so polite ...”

“Alright! Thank you, brother Xia!” Ye linyun grinned and carefully put the cigarette box into his pocket.

After returning to the farm, ye linyun met up with his comrades and was naturally excited.

The staff canteen was already closed, so Xia ruofei asked Lei Hu to send someone to town to buy some marinade and other dishes to go with the wine. He also contributed a few bottles of Drunken Eight Immortals wine. After having some supper with everyone, he returned to the villa.

Ye Lingyun stayed in the staff dormitory. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The next day, Xia ruofei drove to the city after having breakfast in the staff cafeteria.

He brought along two small boxes of top – grade Da Hong Pao, each containing a total of 200 grams, and gave them to Ling Xiaotian and professor Tian.

......

With only 12 tea trees, the yield must be very low. Xia ruofei did not count on these tea leaves to sell for money. He had originally intended to give them to some elders and friends. It was perfect as a gift.

After giving them away, Xia ruofei only had about four taels left. He was not going to give the tea leaves away and would keep them for himself.

After giving the gift, Xia ruofei drove back to Taoyuan farm.

He went straight to the complex. It had been two days since he left the farm. The employees all knew that he was back, so he had to go around the office for show.

When he reached his office, Xia ruofei realized that the door was open. He was stunned. He looked inside and saw song Rui sitting on the guest sofa. He was holding a cup of hot tea and enjoying it.

“Swish!” Xia ruofei shouted,”why did you come to my place without saying a word? I thought there was a thief in the office!”

“You’re the thief!” Song Rui said,”you’re having a good time as a boss, aren’t you? What time is it now for you to come to work?”

Xia ruofei walked to song Rui and sat down beside him.””Isn’t that obvious? I’m the boss, I’m the boss in the company! Of course, we can come whenever we want!”

Xia ruofei continued,”aren’t you addicted to being a good boy?” How come you’re suddenly free to come here?”

“Of course there’s something I need to talk to you about!” Song Rui said.

Xia ruofei took out a cigarette and threw it to song Rui. Then, he took one out for himself and lit it. After taking a puff, he said,”Speak! What was it? Make a statement first! I’m not going to drink with you ...”

Then, Xia ruofei saw that song Rui was staring at the cigarette box that he had casually thrown on the coffee table. The box was pure white, without any logo or pattern.

Elder song had given this to Xia ruofei yesterday. He had casually carried a bag with him.

“Where ... Where did you get this cigarette?” Song Rui asked in surprise.

“Yesterday, I went to the Gu Ling courtyard and your Master Song gave me two ...” Xia ruofei said nonchalantly.

“How much? Say that again!” Song Rui’s eyes widened.”Two ... Two?”
