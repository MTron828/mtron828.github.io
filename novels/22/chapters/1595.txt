Chapter 1597: Dude, an azmu please!_2

Translator: 549690339

“Oh? “Tell me ...” Xia ruofei smiled.

“First and foremost, the most affordable thing is the discount on the price. This yacht, including import tariffs and luxury goods taxes, will cost about 3.6 million Yuan in total.” Liao Bo said,”when we attend the yacht exhibition this time, we will give our interest to our customers directly in terms of price. The total discount is as high as 100000 Yuan!”

Xia ruofei maintained a faint smile and looked at Liao Bo, who had an exaggerated expression, without saying a word.

Liao Bo looked at Xia ruofei and continued,””Also, if you buy this yacht, you’ll become a member of the azmu Huaxia region Yacht Club, and you’ll be exempted from the annual fee for the first two years. The annual fee is 50000 Yuan per year.”

Liao Bo saw that Xia ruofei still did not speak and hurriedly explained,””Mr. Xia, if you become a member of our Yacht Club, you can enjoy a lot of valuable services. We also organize some exchange activities regularly, and members can participate in them for free.”

Rich people generally valued this kind of exchange. The exchange activities organized by high – end yacht clubs were naturally a good opportunity to expand their network.

However, Liao Bo did not know that Xia ruofei did not care about such exchanges. It was because his connections were beyond Liao Bo’s imagination. He did not need to participate in such exchanges.

Besides, Xia ruofei had no intention of using the yacht in the outside world. How would they communicate then? They were going on a yacht. Was Xia ruofei going to rent a motorboat to join the fun?

Liao Bo saw that Xia ruofei did not show any sign of interest and could not help but feel anxious. He gritted his teeth and said,””Mr. Xia, if you really want it, I can apply for a lower price for you. I really can’t give you any more discounts with my authority ... In addition, I’ll apply for some other gifts from the company, such as ... A seven – day stay at the Four Seasons Hotel, worldwide! This is only available when you order a large yacht ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”Okay, okay, little Liao, I didn’t say I didn’t want to buy it ...”

Only then did Liao Bo realize that he seemed to be a little anxious.

In fact, many customers who were willing to spend millions on a yacht did not care about a discount of tens of thousands of Yuan, not to mention a small favor like a five – Star hotel ticket. He knew that he should focus on service.

Thinking of this, Liao Bo said sincerely,””Mr. Xia, our company values every customer very much. You’ve chosen azmu’s yacht, which means you’ll be able to enjoy the best service. In fact, buying a yacht isn’t just a deal. More accurately, it should be a reward for yourself. It can bring you a completely different life experience ...”

Xia ruofei heard Liao Bo’s bewitching words and asked with a smile,””Xiao Liao, I only have two questions I’m concerned about. One is if I place an order on the spot today, when will the earliest be able to deliver it?”

Liao Bo couldn’t help but feel invigorated. When he talked about this question, it usually meant that the deal was very close. Otherwise, the customer would not ask such specific questions.

“Even if we start manufacturing this model now, it won’t take too long,” he quickly said.”The specific delivery time depends on the personalized configuration you choose, but under normal circumstances, it won’t exceed two months.”

Xia ruofei was quite satisfied with this answer. He nodded and asked,””There’s one more question. How are we going to deliver the yacht?”

“The yacht will be produced in our company’s Italy headquarters. After completion and inspection, it will be declared into the country through the sea shipping channel as per normal customs declaration. We will send it to the yacht dock you designated ...” Liao Bo said without thinking.

“What if I don’t want to receive it at the dock?” Xia ruofei said,”let’s put it this way! I hope you can send this yacht to the warehouse I’ve specified. Can you do that?”

“No problem!” Liao Bo said without hesitation,”we’ve always put our customers first!”

If Xia ruofei wanted to buy a large yacht that was tens of meters long, Liao Bo might have hesitated. After all, it would be very troublesome to transport such a size yacht on land. However, this small yacht that was ten meters long would not have such a problem at all. An ordinary flatbed could handle the transportation task.

Xia ruofei nodded in satisfaction.”OK! There shouldn’t be any problems then! I’ll order this one! How do I pay?” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Liao Bo was overjoyed and quickly said,””Mr. Xia, it’s like this ... After you choose the specific personalized configuration, we will calculate a specific price, which includes the cost of the yacht purchase and all kinds of taxes incurred during the import. You only need to pay a 50% deposit, and after the yacht has been delivered and accepted, you can pay the remaining 50%!”

“Understood!” Xia ruofei said,”then let’s go through the procedures!”

“This way, please!” Liao Bo said hurriedly and then led the way enthusiastically.

He brought Xia ruofei out of the yacht exhibition area and into Hall 9, which was adjacent to the outdoor exhibition area. There, service counters were set up for all the yachts of major brands. The two of them soon arrived at the service counter of azmu.

Liao Bo was busy calling for the service staff to serve Xia ruofei tea. He brought Xia ruofei to the sofa in the guest area and sat down. He skillfully found a small booklet and handed it to Xia ruofei.”Mr. Xia, this is the configuration list of the Atlantis 34 yacht. You can take a look first and we’ll decide on them one by one later!”
