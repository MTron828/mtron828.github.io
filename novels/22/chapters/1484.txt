Chapter 1485: Successful unlock (1)

Translator: 549690339

As the light flickered, Xia ruofei’s forehead started to sweat.

The invisible spatial force was acting on the light screen through his palm. Under the pressure from the inside and outside, he felt that his palm bone seemed to be creaking, as if it would crack at any time.

This light barrier was extremely tough. Xia ruofei’s palm had almost completely sunk into it, but it did not break.

The more he pushed forward, the stronger the reaction force. Even though Xia ruofei was using all his spiritual power, he still felt that the force was not in his heart.

However, Xia ruofei was a tough person and would never give up easily.

Moreover, he had a faint feeling that this earth character jade talisman was very important for his exploration of the ancient tomb. If this attempt failed, he was afraid that he would not be able to break it again in a short time. First of all, he would feel a sense of fear in his heart. In addition, he did not have enough time.

Hence, even though his body was trembling, Xia ruofei still pushed his palm forward slowly but firmly.

He didn’t care if the powerful pressure would hurt him, and continued to mobilize the invisible Space Force.

The light barrier trembled more and more violently. Xia ruofei’s expression became more and more ferocious. He was already an arrow at the end of its flight. Although his will was extremely strong, the human body had a reaction to stress. If the pain reached a certain level, coupled with the overexertion of his spiritual power, Xia ruofei would probably faint.

He could already feel the darkness in front of him, and his field of vision seemed to have started to narrow. Even the Halo barrier was becoming a little blurry in his eyes. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Xia ruofei gritted his teeth and shouted with all his strength. He pressed the chest with all his might.

With a soft “Chi” sound, the entire light barrier finally couldn’t withstand the pressure and shattered, turning into spots of light and quickly disappearing from the stone room.

Xia ruofei suddenly felt his body relax and all the pressure disappeared.

He staggered for a few minutes, and he even felt exhausted. His whole body was soaked in sweat as if he had just been fished out of the water.

As he had overexerted his mental strength, Xia ruofei felt a piercing pain on both sides of his forehead. It was as if thousands of needles had been inserted at the same time.

He waved his hand, and a small bottle of spirit Heart Flower petal solution that he had prepared in advance slowly floated in front of him.

Xia ruofei picked up the bottle and opened it with his weak hands. He gulped down the entire bottle of petal solution.

Then, without another word, he sat cross – legged on the futon and began to recover.

The effect of the solution was very fast. As soon as he drank it, Xia ruofei felt the pain in his palm and head begin to ease. His strength was also gradually recovering.

Due to time constraints, Xia ruofei did not wait for her body to recover to its best condition. She stood up and walked quickly to the stone platform. She reached out and picked up the ancient jade talisman.

In order to save time, Xia ruofei did not look at it in detail. He held the Jade talisman in his hand and with a thought, he returned to the Archean realm where time was accelerated by 30 times.

Xia Qing was waiting quietly in the Archean realm. A large part of her attention was focused on the outside world through her divine sense.

When he saw Xia ruofei appear at the Archean realm with a jade talisman, he immediately said,””Congratulations, master! I’ve successfully obtained the earth character jade talisman!”

Xia ruofei still looked tired. He smiled and said,””I’m quite lucky. I almost failed, but fortunately, I still held on!”

“Xia Qing,” Xia ruofei continued,”can you tell me what use this earth character jade talisman has for my trip to the ancient tomb?”

“Master, you’ll naturally understand after you undo this jade talisman!” Xia Qing said with a smile.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but roll his eyes. He picked up the earth jade talisman and examined it carefully. The shape and size of this jade talisman were exactly the same as the human jade talisman, but the seal script on it had changed into the Word “earth”. In addition, it was also the same as the human jade talisman, with mysterious patterns engraved on it.

These lines were obviously much more complicated than the human talisman. Xia ruofei found it very difficult to simulate it in his mind. His spiritual power had improved by a lot, and he could easily complete the unlocking of the human talisman with a thought. It was clear how difficult it was to unlock the earth talisman.

However, the most difficult task of breaking the barrier had been completed, so the unlocking process was naturally imperative. It was nothing more than practice.

Xia ruofei calculated the time. He should be able to stay in the Archean realm for another four to five hours. The flow of time here was 30 times slower than the outside world. Five hours was about ten minutes. Including the time he spent breaking the barrier in the cave in the mountain sea realm, he would only be able to enter the spirit map space for about twenty minutes at most. This was basically the normal time for a bath.

Hence, Xia ruofei did not waste any more time. He sat down cross – legged on the ground and started to study the unlocking runes of the earth character jade talisman seriously. As he analyzed, he even stretched out his fingers and drew in the air.

Time passed by slowly. Xia Qing quietly stood guard behind Xia ruofei, paying attention to the situation outside at all times. Xia ruofei, on the other hand, devoted himself to the study of the unlocking runes.

Gradually, Xia ruofei started to use his spiritual power to draw runes.

As Xia ruofei’s fingers moved, mysterious lines appeared in front of him, shining with a faint golden light.
