2178 The master and disciple meet again (2)

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”Why?”

“Jebson is a boy in their class,” Jennifer said with a smile.”Alan, why do you want to look like Jebson?”

“He often bullies other children. I want to tease him!” Tang Haoran said.

Xia ruofei and Tang Yitian looked at each other and burst out laughing.

Xia ruofei asked,”Haoran, is this kid bullying you too?”

“He wouldn’t dare to bully me, master!” Tang Haoran said proudly. He might be the biggest in the class, but ten of him can’t even beat me!”

Tang Yitian coughed and said,”Haoran, I didn’t teach you Kung Fu for you to fight! You can’t bully the weak!”

Xia ruofei looked at Tang Haoran with a smile. He wanted to hear his reply.

“I won’t bully anyone!” Tang Haoran puffed out his chest and said. I still remember what master said! And when Jebson bullies other little students, I’ll stand up to stop him! At first, he wanted to teach me a lesson, but after I taught him a lesson, he no longer dared to bully other students in front of me!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”Woof! Even little Haoran knew how to be chivalrous! Not bad, not bad ...”

Tang Haoran looked at Xia ruofei and asked,””Master, can I sleep with you tonight?” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Xia ruofei looked at Tang Yitian and Jennifer with a smile, then said,””Sure! I still want to test your cultivation! In addition, if you have any questions about cultivation, you can also ask me. How about we master and disciple talk by candlelight tonight?”

“Yay! That’s great!” Tang Haoran was so happy that he jumped.

Tang Yitian and Jennifer naturally didn’t have any objections. They were overjoyed!

“Haoran,” Jennifer said with a smile,”since you’re going to sleep with master tonight, why don’t you go wash your face and brush your teeth now?”

“I know!” Tang Haoran replied.

Jennifer brought Tang Haoran to wash up while Xia ruofei sat in the living room and chatted with Tang Yitian for a while.

Xia ruofei suddenly thought of his identity and couldn’t help but ask,””That’s right, big brother Tang! I’ll use this identity to enter China, and this person will only have an entry record and then disappear. Will it cause you any trouble?”

Tang Yitian thought for a while and said,”this shouldn’t be a big problem ... If you really can’t do it, then we’ll do it this way ... When you return to San Shan, you can go to the beach in that disguise. We’ll just report that you went missing and said that you didn’t come back after swimming in the sea. After a certain number of days, we’ll be sure that this person is dead, and all the identity records will be erased.”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but giggle. He was going to go to the sea too because he had left the three mountains on a yacht back then. In the end, he still had to drive that yacht back to the dock! Otherwise, Xia ruofei would not be able to explain why such a big yacht had disappeared just like that!

“Then it’s decided!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ll contact you when the time comes.”

Tang Yitian nodded, then asked,””Ruofei, are you really not going to visit Paradise Farm this time?”

Xia ruofei shook his head and said,”this is illegal entry. It’s not convenient.” And I’m in a hurry to go back ... By the way, big brother Tang, you didn’t tell Liang Qichao that I’m in Australia, did you?”

“No, no! You already said that you entered the country through an abnormal method, why would I go around telling people?” Tang Yitian said,”apart from Jennifer and Haoran, no one knows that you’ve come to Australia.” Even the people who helped with the identification documents don’t know your true identity ...”

“That’s good! I’m confident in big brother Tang’s work!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

The two of them chatted for a while. Since Xia ruofei had to fly to China the next morning, they didn’t stay up too late and went upstairs to their room.

Tang Yitian even went to Xia ruofei’s room and told Tang Haoran to be obedient and not disturb Xia ruofei’s rest.

After Tang Yitian and Jennifer went back to their room, Xia ruofei called Tang Haoran over. After checking, he found that his cultivation had really reached the 3rd level of the refinement stage and he should not be too far away from a breakthrough.

This showed that the little guy was really diligent and didn’t relax for a day.

Xia ruofei was naturally very satisfied. He told Tang Haoran about the practice of the “blazing sun Sutra”. After his cultivation and spiritual power had improved, his understanding of cultivation had also improved. Although the cultivation experience of the “blazing sun Sutra” came from the Jade talisman of inheritance, his understanding of this cultivation technique and the cultivation experience were different.

After he was done, Xia ruofei answered some of Tang Haoran’s questions about cultivation. When he saw that it was already one in the morning, he told Tang Haoran to go to bed.

The next morning, while Xia ruofei was still asleep, he saw Tang Haoran get up.

He opened his eyes and saw that Tang Haoran was already sitting cross – legged on the bed. He was holding a spirit crystal in his hand and starting to cultivate.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel a little ashamed. As a master, he didn’t have as much perseverance in his cultivation as Tang Haoran.

He didn’t disturb Tang Haoran, and quietly got out of bed to wash up. Then, he took out origin crystals and started cultivating.

Two hours later, the master and disciple woke up from their cultivation state.

Xia ruofei said,”Haoran, not bad, not bad!” He’s been training very hard!”

Tang Haoran smiled embarrassedly and said,””Master, please teach me the method to change my appearance!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh,”you still remember that?” Your current cultivation is still too low. When your cultivation reaches the required level, I will teach you!”

In fact, if he was at refined Qi Level 3, he could definitely practice Xia ruofei’s method of changing his appearance. However, Xia ruofei was worried that after he passed it to Tang Haoran, the little guy would be too playful and play with people everywhere. He thought that it was better to wait until he grew up and matured.

“Alright then ...” Tang Haoran was a little disappointed and said,”I’ll definitely work hard in my cultivation! Try to meet the requirements as soon as possible!”

“That’s the right way to think!” Xia ruofei laughed.

Then, he took out a spiritual crystal from the medium and handed it to Tang Haoran, saying,””I see that you’re cultivating so hard. Take this spiritual crystal first, in case you use up the one you have.”

“Master, I feel that there’s a lot of spiritual Qi in this spiritual crystal! No need to give me a new one!” Tang Haoran said quickly.

“If I give it to you, just take it!” Xia ruofei said,”it’s for cultivation anyway, so it won’t go to waste. What if I’m not by your side after you’ve used up all your spirit crystals? Take this as a backup!”

Xia ruofei had obtained two hundred origin crystals this time. From now on, he would definitely use origin crystals as his main source of cultivation. For Tang Haoran’s current cultivation, using the spirit crystal to cultivate was just right.

Naturally, Xia ruofei would not feel bad about giving it to his own disciple.

Tang Haoran took the crystals from Xia ruofei and said,””Thank you, master!”

Xia ruofei smiled and touched his head.””No need to be so polite with master. Hurry up and wash your face and brush your teeth!”

When Xia ruofei brought Tang Haoran downstairs, Jennifer had already prepared breakfast.

After Xia ruofei had breakfast with Tang Yitian’s family, the Elfa van from last night arrived at the holiday villa.

“Ruofei, the arrangements at the airport have been made. We won’t be sending you to the airport.” “I wish you a smooth journey!” Tang Yitian said.

Tang Yitian knew that Xia ruofei had to keep a low profile on this trip. He and Jennifer were a famous Chinese tycoon in Australia and a superstar. Once they appeared at the airport, it was impossible to keep a low profile, so they decided not to go.

Xia ruofei nodded and said, Then, let’s meet again!”

Tang Haoran revealed a reluctant expression and said,””Master, you have to come to Australia often to see me!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded,”definitely!” My good disciple is in Australia! And master has a business in Australia, so he’ll come here often in the future!”

“En!” Tang Haoran nodded.

Xia ruofei waved goodbye to Tang Yitian’s family and got into the Elfa van. They left the holiday villa and headed towards the Polz airport.
