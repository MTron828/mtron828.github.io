Chapter 1761: A soft persimmon is not soft_1

Just as du Qinghong was caught in a dilemma, someone suddenly stood out from the crowd and said,””Old Shen, old du, you guys are here too?”

Shen Zhongliang and du Qinghong looked up and were instantly shocked. The person who was speaking was Lu Shengsi, the Vice President of the Huaxia mystical society. Beside Lu Shengsi was Hong shenyuan, who was also a director of the Huaxia mystical society like Shen Zhongliang.

Lu Shengsi’s appearance helped du Qinghong out of his predicament temporarily. He whispered a few words to Liu haofan, then walked towards Lu Shengsi with Shen Zhongliang. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“President Lu, you’re here too!” Du Qinghong greeted.

Lu Shengsi pulled du Qinghong and Shen Zhongliang to the side and asked in a low voice,””Old du, old Shen, did you really come up with the conclusion that young master Liu was talking about the yin gathering place?”

Shen Zhongliang didn’t understand what he was getting at and said,”Yup! This Feng Shui situation was very obvious! Did President Lu also come because he heard something?”

When du Qinghong saw the strange expressions on Lu Shengsi and Hong shenyuan’s faces, he couldn’t help but Mutter in his heart.

“President Lu, could there be something more to this plot of land?” he asked with a slight frown.

Lu Shengsi sighed and asked,””Old Shen, were you and old du the ones who personally visited him that day?”

It was no wonder that Lu Shengsi would have doubts. This was clearly a place with excellent Fengshui, and even an ordinary Fengshui master could see it. How could experienced Fengshui Masters like Shen Zhongliang and du Qinghong make a mistake at the same time, and their conclusions were completely different?

This was something Lu Shengsi couldn’t understand.

Another director of the Huaxia mystical society also said in a strange tone,””Old Shen, old du, take a good look ...”

Du Qinghong had already confirmed that there was a problem. Before Shen Zhongliang could react, he immediately looked around and used his sect’s Secret technique, Qi observation.

Du Qinghong couldn’t help but tremble when he checked, and his eyes were filled with disbelief.

Du Qinghong finally realized that the aura of the entire land was completely different. It could even be said that it had gone from one extreme to the other.

In fact, when they got off the car, du Qinghong felt that the atmosphere was not as cold as it was that day. However, he thought that it was because there were more people at the scene, and it was close to noon, so the Yang energy had neutralized the yin energy.

The main thing was that he had already seen it very clearly that day. He had long been prejudiced by his first impression and had not thought about other aspects at all.

This was because this was a naturally formed Yin gathering place. That day, he and Shen Zhongliang had already confirmed that it was almost impossible to reverse the situation with human strength. Thus, they had not made any mental preparations in this aspect.

Now that the life QI in this land was so rich, and the entire Qi field was reversed, how did it still look like a Yin gathering place? This was clearly a treasure ground for gathering wealth!

Du Qinghong’s face turned pale as he muttered to himself,””This ... This ... How is this possible?”

“Old du ...” Shen Zhongliang also realized that something was not right. He frowned and said,”the atmosphere here seems a little different. Why don’t we take a closer look ...”

Du Qinghong waved his hand and said,”old Shen, there’s no need to look anymore. We were wrong that day. No! Maybe it’s not as simple as a misjudgment. ”

Du Qinghong knew that Lu Shengsi and Hong shenyuan must have carefully studied the Feng Shui of this piece of land. The two of them pulled them to the side and asked them in low voices. They rarely explained the problem, so there was no need to look at it again.

However, du Qinghong did not think that he and Shen Zhongliang would be wrong at the same time. So, after he calmed down, the first thing that came to his mind was that there was an expert who had turned the Feng Shui situation around.

Du Qinghong didn’t dare to imagine what kind of master could do this. It wasn’t as simple as cracking the yin gathering place, but a complete reversal. He turned this piece of land from a “treasure land” only suitable for building Yin residences into a real land of wealth and fortune. This method was simply ingenious!

Just as du Qinghong was in a daze, Lu Shengsi said in a low voice,””Old du, old Shen, we’ll discuss other things later. Right now, the most important thing is to deal with the current situation ...”

Lu Shengsi naturally did not think that du Qinghong and Shen Zhongliang’s skills were that bad, so he also knew that there must be a reason for this. But he also knew that now was not the time to investigate this, there were still two groups of people waiting over there!

Du Qinghong was also shocked. He looked at Shen Zhongliang and said,””Old Shen, I can see that this young master Liu brought us here today to use our name to make things difficult for others!”

“I didn’t expect that we would still be used by others at our age ...” Shen Zhongliang said with a bitter smile.

In fact, Shen Zhongliang and du Qinghong did not really know that much inside information. It was just that Liu haofan took the initiative to look for them, saying that there was a company preparing to develop the land that they had seen last time. Today was the groundbreaking ceremony, and Liu haofan wanted them to attend.

The two of them didn’t think too much about it. Since they had nothing to do today, they agreed.

Du Qinghong did not expect to see such a scene. What was even more unexpected was that Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue were both shareholders of this project ...

Lu Shengsi said in a low voice,”old Shen, old du, my suggestion is not to get involved in this mess. The person who invited old Hong and I to attend the groundbreaking ceremony has a strong background. He’s not inferior to young master Liu at all!” If you don’t pay attention to your words, it’s easy to offend people. ”
