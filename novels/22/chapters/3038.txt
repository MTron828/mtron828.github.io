Translator: 5496903“Master,” Luo Qingfeng said in a trembling voice,”it’s all my fault. There were so many spies in the sect, but I didn’t even notice ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”let’s not talk about this now. Fortunately, we didn’t cause any major losses. If even core secrets such as the blueprint of the sect’s defensive formation were leaked out, the star Seizer sect would be in grave danger!” It’s not too late to make up for it. Since we’ve already found out, we’ll just have to deal with it as soon as possible!”

“Yes! This old servant will obey master’s instructions!” Luo Qingfeng said quickly.

He was also filled with lingering fear. If Xia ruofei had not come to the star picking sect and conducted a thorough screening of all the disciples, he would not have known anything, especially the spy who had successfully infiltrated the star picking tower. He was too dangerous.

He himself lived in zhaixing tower, but there was actually an enemy’s spy beside his bed.

Even though under normal circumstances, no one would be able to plot against an Aurous core stage cultivator, but there was no such thing as a thousand – day guard against thieves. What if the other party used a strange poison to plot against him? Or should he take advantage of the critical moment of his closed – door cultivation to suddenly fight with his life? If he were to be careless, he might really fail miserably.

Even if his own safety wasn’t a big problem, there were too many secrets in Zhai Xing Lou. If any of them were leaked out, it would bring great harm to the star picking sect.

It could be said that those who were selected to enter star – picking tower were all disciples that Luo Qingfeng had personally inspected and thought to be highly reliable.

And just like that, a spy had managed to sneak in.

Luo Qingfeng could not help but sweat.

Xia ruofei picked up a piece of paper from the table and handed it to Luo Qingfeng. He said lightly,””The elder who wants to replace you every day and the list of five spies are all here. You can deal with them as you see fit! In addition, among these disciples, I’ve also listed out some of them who have a strong sense of belonging to the sect and are dead set on you. They should be the most reliable. If these people have good talent, you can put them in an appropriate position!”

Luo Qingfeng was touched. With tears in his eyes, he took the list with trembling hands and knelt on the ground with a thud.””Master has given this old servant and the star Seizer sect a new lease of life. This old servant thanks you!”

“Get up!” Xia ruofei said indifferently,”it seems that this internal investigation is still very important. Quickly arrange for the disciples outside to come back for the investigation. We must not leave any hidden dangers!”

“Yes! This old servant has already arranged for the personnel to temporarily rotate. Within seven days, all the people outside will return to the sect!” Luo Qingfeng said.

Xia ruofei said,”I can’t wait that long. I have to go back to Peach Blossom Island!” After I’ve taken care of some matters, I’ll return to the star Seizer sect and screen the remaining disciples!”

“Yes! Master!” Luo Qingfeng said with his head lowered.

He never looked at the paper in his hand. Since Xia ruofei had even provided the name list, the five spies would not be able to escape. As for that ambitious elder, he did not intend to keep him. No matter if it was a Qi refining level 9 or 8, as long as they had not broken through to the Golden core stage, they were no different from ants in his eyes. Losing a Qi refining elder was not a big deal to the star Seizer sect.

Xia ruofei had helped the star Seizer sect to modify the sect’s protective formation. Very soon, the star Seizer sect’s cultivation environment would undergo a tremendous change. Xia ruofei had also given him the method to cultivate spiritual power. This way, the Qi refining cultivators of the star Seizer sect would improve very quickly.

At that time, there would be more high – Level Qi refinement cultivators and even golden core cultivators. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Under such circumstances, Luo Qingfeng would naturally not care about an elder at the advanced Qi refinement realm.

Luo Qingfeng clenched the paper tightly and said respectfully,””Master, even if you’re going to leave, you should rest for a day or two. You’ve been so busy with the star Seizer sect’s Affairs these past few days that you basically haven’t rested at all. This old servant’s heart is very uneasy!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s okay. It’s the same to rest on the road.”

Luo Qingfeng was stunned when he heard this. He did not know that Xia ruofei had already obtained an airboat. In fact, it was even more advanced than Chen Xuan ‘s. Naturally, he thought that Xia ruofei was flying back to Peach Blossom Island on her sword. Flying on a sword was very exhausting. How could she rest on the way?

However, Luo Qingfeng did not dare to ask too much. Since Xia ruofei had decided, he could only follow it unconditionally.

Xia ruofei took out a stack of documents that he had prepared earlier and said,””I’m leaving these for you, use them well! In the future, the cultivation environment of the star Seizer sect will not be any worse than that of the other top sects. Before the star Seizer sect produces a second Aurous core stage cultivator, you will have to stay in the sect for most of the time. If there’s anything, I will naturally inform you. The rest of the time, you will work hard to improve your strength and protect the sect!”

“Yes! Master!” “Yes, master,” Luo Qingfeng replied respectfully. He then looked curiously at the stack of documents in Xia ruofei’s hands and asked,”master, this is ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”this is the modified control method of the star evolution formation. There are some changes from before, but not much. Take a look and you should be able to get used to it soon.” This is the content of the second volume of the “glittering jewel true understanding.” The first volume is more suitable for Qi refining cultivators. You’re already in the Golden core stage. After mastering the first volume, you should focus on the second volume.”Also, these are all cultivation techniques and battle skills. I’ve extracted those that are suitable for Qi condensation disciples. You can pass them on to talented and loyal disciples as you see fit. En ... There are a few more that are suitable for golden core cultivators. You can learn them when you have time. You don’t have to be proficient in them. It’s good to use them as a reference ...”
