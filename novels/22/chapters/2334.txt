2335 An unexpected surprise (1)

As song Qiming had just woken up, his body was still weak. Furthermore, Xia ruofei could not use the petals of the spirit Heart Flower on song Qiming in such a crowded place like the main hospital. Hence, he only chatted with song Qiming for a short while and let him rest well. He then got up and left.

Song Wei knew that her mother, Fang Liyun, had a lot to say to her father. Hence, she left the ward under the excuse of sending Xia ruofei off.

Fang Liyun looked at the back view of the two leaving together, and at that moment, she suddenly felt that the scene was quite beautiful. If only RUO Fei didn’t have a girlfriend. Such a son – in – Law would be hard to find!

However, Fang Liyun also knew that Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue had a good relationship, so this thought only flashed through her mind for a moment. She quickly eliminated it. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Xia ruofei asked Song Wei to send him to the elevator. He told her to rest and then took the elevator down.

He even called Guangzhi Cao and told him to keep the possibility of the attacker behind the car accident a secret from song Qiming.

Since the crisis was over for the time being, the most important thing for song Qiming now was his rehabilitation. If he knew about these things, it would only add to his troubles.

For the next two days, Xia ruofei did not appear in the General Hospital.

He had disappeared in the name of tidying up the medical books. He did not want to see professor Chen’s sad face when he heard that song Qiming was going to be discharged. Even if no one said it, professor Chen could guess that if song Qiming was to be discharged, Xia ruofei would be the one taking over the treatment.

Under elder song’s arrangement and coordination, song Qiming stayed in the senior cadre Ward in the General Hospital for two days. After his physical indicators stabilized, he was successfully discharged.

The General Hospital sent an ambulance to take song Qiming back to the family members ‘District. Although song Qiming was a provincial leader, he still chose to live in the family members’ hospital of the Sanshan Municipal Party Committee.

According to Xia ruofei’s instructions, song Qiming’s family declined the good intentions of the medical staff from the General Hospital. After they settled down at home, they let the medical staff who escorted them go back with the ambulance.

Not long after the ambulance left, Xia ruofei’s Black Knight XV SUV appeared at the entrance of song Qiming’s small villa.

He also brought a big bag with a change of clothes, toiletries, and some things that he had prepared for the past two days.

Yes, Xia ruofei was going to’ cohabit ‘with Song Wei.

To be more precise, he was going to stay at song Qiming’s house for two days to make arrangements for his rehabilitation. Then, he would be ready to return to the capital.

Fang Liyun and Song Wei personally came out and warmly welcomed Xia ruofei into the house.

Song Wei was looking forward to living under the same roof as Xia ruofei for a few days. At the same time, she felt a little guilty because her parents were watching.

“This feeling is quite exciting ...” Song Wei thought to herself.

“Wei Wei, take RUO Fei to his room and settle him down!” Fang Liyun said,”I’m going up to see your father! He’s been talking about it the whole morning, asking when RUO Fei would be coming!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”no need, Auntie!” I’ll just go and see uncle song! I haven’t seen him for two days, I have to quickly give him a checkup. ”

“Alright then!” Fang Liyun had indeed treated Xia ruofei as her junior. She did not bother to be polite with Xia ruofei. She agreed readily and personally led Xia ruofei upstairs.

Song Qiming was arranged to stay in the master bedroom on the second floor. He was still unable to get out of bed, so Fang Liyun was the one who took care of him. She did not even hire a caretaker. It was clear that the two of them were very close.

When Xia ruofei entered the room, song Qiming was leaning against the headboard and reading the newspaper. His head, which had been shaved off due to the surgery, had short hair, but he seemed to be in good spirits.

To make it easier to take care of him, song Qiming’s bed was a bed that had been transported from the hospital. It was placed side by side next to the master bedroom’s bed. This way, when needed, the head of the bed could be raised directly, and he could eat on the bed directly by placing it on a small table.

As soon as Xia ruofei entered the room, song Qiming heard the commotion. He looked up and immediately put down the newspaper in his hand. At the same time, he took off his glasses.

Song Qiming smiled and said,”RUO Fei is here!” You’ve had a hard journey! Quickly come over and sit!”

“Uncle song, you seem to be in good spirits!” Xia ruofei smiled.”How are you feeling these two days?”

Song Qiming said half – jokingly,”I feel great!” I’m just not used to having nothing to do all of a sudden ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”then you can slowly get used to it!” But I guess after you get used to it, you’ll be busy again, and you won’t be used to it!”

What Xia ruofei meant was that song Qiming could recover in a relatively short time.

In fact, song Qiming was very eager to go back to work. After all, he had reached his current level at his age, so his future was very bright. He was full of energy and enthusiasm in his work. He would not even think about taking a break.

Therefore, song Qiming could not help but smile happily when he heard that. He said,””Then I’ll be counting on your blessings ...”
