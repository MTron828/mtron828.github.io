Chapter 1751: Another gift of ink (1)

Everyone drank and chatted, and naturally, they talked about the groundbreaking ceremony that Xia ruofei and Zhao Yongjun had discussed.

In fact, Xia ruofei and Zhao Yongjun were already the leaders of the small team. Xia ruofei’s suggestion was very good, so no one objected. They were all discussing the details with great interest.

When Hou Liang learned that his proposal to bring in the meetup group for life you yearn for had been put on hold as a backup plan, he didn’t show any dissatisfaction or dejection. He still said that he would actively work and coordinate to ensure that this backup plan could be immediately implemented if needed.

To Xia ruofei, this club was just a small project with his good friends. Although he would do his best because of Zhao Yongjun and the others, he didn’t really place much importance on it.

If he had not discovered the nine rotation universe formation, Xia ruofei would not have paid so much attention to it. If the piece of land was snatched by Liu er, he would just have to find another piece.

In contrast, Zhao Yong Jun and the others, especially Xu Zi Xuan and Liu Jian, placed a lot of importance on this project. After all, for them, this was a heaven – sent opportunity to achieve financial freedom.

Although these rich kids did not have to worry about food and clothing, if they really wanted to live as carefreely as Xia ruofei, the pocket money given by their families was far from enough. Once this project was successful, they would not have to worry about money anymore.

Moreover, this was also a serious matter in the eyes of the elders in the family. If they did it well, they could still be very outstanding.

Hence, Xu Zixuan and the rest were very enthusiastic and offered their suggestions. The meal lasted until 2 pm before Xia ruofei let Wu Qiang clean up the mess. The rest of them went to his courtyard to make tea and continue talking about the groundbreaking ceremony.

Xia ruofei personally poured tea for everyone. This made Hou Liang, Wei Jun, and the others feel flattered. They quickly stood up and took the tea with both hands.

Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”brother Zhao, since we’re holding a groundbreaking ceremony, shouldn’t we decide on the name of our club?” You can’t possibly say ‘CC08 0601 0023 plot project’ during the groundbreaking ceremony, right?”

Xia ruofei had a good memory. When he was bidding for the land, he could still recite the official land number word for word.

Everyone laughed out loud, and the focus of the discussion shifted from which guests and media to the naming of the clubhouse.

“Didn’t we agree to call it paradise clubhouse?”Zhao Yongjun asked.

Xia ruofei shook his head and said,”it doesn’t feel good ... Besides, it’s a bit old – fashioned to call it a club now!” Besides, even though I’m a shareholder, the club has nothing to do with paradise Corporation. It’s a joint project of everyone, so wouldn’t the public misunderstand that it’s a club under paradise Corporation by naming it like this?”

Song Rui laughed and said,”so be it!” I don’t mind! Your company is so popular, it’s not a bad idea for the club to get a share of the glory!”

Xu Zi Xuan also said,”RUO Fei, I also don’t think it’s a big deal, isn’t it just a name?” There were so many people with the same name in the world! Besides, strictly speaking, our club is inextricably linked to the Paradise Corporation!”

What Xu Zixuan said was what everyone had initially agreed on. After the club was built, a special area would be opened to display the products of paradise Corporation.

Liu Jian, Hou Liang, and the others all agreed.

Xia ruofei said,”that’s true. But I don’t think the name Paradise Club is anything special. It’s a bit common. Why don’t we think of a better name?”

Song Rui’s imagination ran wild and he said,”then ... How about mansion number one?” If we brothers want to do something, we have to be the first!”

“Brother Rui, isn’t this name a bit too tacky?” Xu Zi Xuan said with some disdain.

“What?” song Rui was not convinced.”You think the name I suggested is old – fashioned? why don’t you say something not old – fashioned?” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Let me think about it, I don’t have any ideas for the time being ...” Xu Zi Xuan smiled.

“Tsk ...” Song Rui expressed his disdain.

The brothers racked their brains and came up with a few names, but they were all rejected for various reasons. Although Xia ruofei was the one who proposed the name, he could not come up with any good ideas either.

At this time, Zhao Yongjun, who had been silent all this time, suddenly spoke,””Ruofei, why don’t we just call it the ‘paradise gathering’!”

Song Rui’s eyes lit up and he said,”not bad!” Brother Zhao, although it’s only one word, it feels like the style has gone up. Look, isn’t Boss Ma ‘s’ Jiangnan party ‘cool? If it became ‘Jiang – Nan club’, it would feel so low! Big brother Zhao, that’s a beautiful word!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”isn’t this the same as not changing?”

“It’s different!”Song Rui said. It was completely different! The whole style is so much higher!”

Zhao Yongjun also smiled and said,”ruofei, let’s not talk about your concerns. I think the name itself is quite good!” Don’t our potential customers all pursue that kind of paradise – like life? Besides, our land is surrounded by mountains and rivers, and with your careful arrangement and Yifan’s personal design, it’s not a problem to turn it into a paradise!”
