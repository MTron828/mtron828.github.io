Translator: 549690339

What Xia ruofei wanted Lei Hu to do was to collect evidence of Liu haojun’s lifestyle. It would be even better if he could find evidence of him breaking the law.

Xia ruofei firmly believed that a dog can’t change its habit of eating sh * t. This could be seen from how Liu haojun and Wu Liqian, who was a member of the Standing Committee, dared to plot against him after he took office, and they did it so brazenly and without any disguise.

He didn’t believe that Liu haojun had no flaws in this aspect.

If Lei Hu and the others were to collect evidence, they would naturally have to use some illegal means. This was a certain risk for Lei Hu and the others, especially for the terrifying power behind the other party. If there was even the slightest mistake, Lei Hu and the others would not be able to stay in the country.

That was why Xia ruofei had offered such a high reward and even thought of a backup plan for them.

If something really happened, they would have to go to Australia. No matter how long the Liu family’s hands were, they could not reach the other side of the ocean.

After talking to Lei Hu, Xia ruofei muttered to himself for a while and decided to make another call. This time, he was calling Tian Huilan.

He felt that he had to tell Tian Huilan about this. Besides, he didn’t know how long it would take Lei Hu and the others to collect evidence. During this time, Wu Liqian’s condition made him a little worried.

Although Liu haojun was only pestering Xia ruofei, he knew this kind of rich man’s son from the capital very well. If he did not have any effect on Liu haojun, he might use some despicable means to force him. If Wu Liqian was hurt, Xia ruofei would never be at ease.

It was fine if he didn’t know about this, but since he did, he would definitely get involved.

It was not good for Xia ruofei to directly intervene in the affairs of the organization, but he believed that Tian Huilan would definitely have a way.

Xia ruofei had this thought in mind as he dialed Tian Huilan’s private number.

“RUO Fei! Why are you so free to call me today?” Tian Huilan asked with a smile after picking up.

“Aunty Tian, I hope I’m not disturbing your work,” Xia ruofei said.

“No, no! I was just about to get off work!” Tian Huilan said,”by the way, I heard that you stayed in Beijing for a long time some time ago. Why didn’t you come over to visit?” It can’t be that the tea becomes cold after the person leaves, right?”

Xia ruofei quickly replied,”aunty Tian, I wouldn’t dare!” When I was in Beijing, I was so busy that I didn’t even have time to visit my other friends and elders except for the old chief!”

“I heard that your paradise gathering is quite famous in Beijing ...” Tian Huilan laughed and said,”this time, I’ll consider you barely pass! However, the next time you come to the capital, you can’t be lazy!”

“Definitely, definitely! When the time comes, I’ll definitely pay you a visit!” Xia ruofei said.

“By the way, what’s the matter?” Tian Huilan asked with a smile.

“Yes,” Xia ruofei said,”I think it’s necessary to report to you about the situation with County Head Wu.”

“Liqian?” Tian Huilan was a little surprised.”What’s wrong with her? Is there a problem?”

“Did she call you to report to you?” Xia ruofei asked.

“I didn ‘t!” Tian Huilan said,”she hasn’t called me in a while ... What happened? RUO Fei, don’t keep me in suspense!”

It was clear that Tian Huilan’s concern for Wu Liqian came from the bottom of her heart. After all, Wu Liqian had worked for her for several years. She had absolute trust in Wu Liqian and spared no effort in cultivating her.

“I just found out about it ...” Xia ruofei said.

Then, Xia ruofei told Tian Huilan about Wu Liqian’s troubles in detail. He did not deliberately hide anything, but he did not exaggerate anything either. He just described the facts objectively.

Even so, Tian Huilan couldn’t help but feel angry after hearing this. She said, “She’s simply playing the zither randomly! Such a cadre was promoted? It was truly inconceivable! I really can’t believe that such a ridiculous thing could happen inside the trap!”

If Tian Huilan did not have absolute trust in Xia ruofei, she would have suspected that everything was made up. Furthermore, it was made up without any technical content and was full of loopholes.

However, since these words came from Xia ruofei’s mouth, she did not doubt the authenticity at all. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Moreover, Tian Huilan had been working in the capital for some time, so she had some understanding of the behavior of some rich second generation. Although she wasn’t familiar with Liu haojun, she had vaguely heard that the children of the Liu family’s current generation were all good – for – nothing, so she didn’t find it strange that Liu haojun had done such a thing.

Tian Huilan’s anger was partly because her former Secretary was involved. On the other hand, she was also a female leader and knew the hardships a woman faced in the system, so it was easier for her to empathize with her.

Xia ruofei said,”aunt Tian, this is what I’m thinking. Sister Qian is not very happy in Changping County. She’s also being held back in her work. I wonder if you have any suitable positions ...”

Tian Huilan immediately understood. She thought for a moment and said,”Ruofei, there’s a strict procedure for selecting officers. Even if I go through it personally, it’ll take a long time to go through the procedures. Distant water can’t quench present thirst ...”

At this point, Tian Huilan thought for a moment and continued,”How about this! “We have a training class that should start the day after tomorrow. We’ve already decided on the candidates. I’ll go and coordinate to add one more person. Let Liqian stay away from the center of the whirlpool and come to Beijing for two months ...”
