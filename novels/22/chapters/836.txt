Chapter 837: High – Quality wormgrass (1)

Translator: 549690339

The Tibetan child was overjoyed and said,””Don’t worry, Sir. Our wormgrass is all natural. Each one was dug up by my father from the mountains four or five thousand meters above sea level. My father has been digging wormgrass for decades, and he never uses inferior quality wormgrass!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”let’s take a look at the item first.” As long as the quality of the wormgrass is good, money is not a problem. ”

“Sir, if it’s convenient, can I invite you to my house to look at the goods?” The Tibetan child asked carefully.

He then explained,”the best quality of the Cordyceps that my father collected is hidden at home. I don’t dare to take it out easily, in case it is discovered by zashidoji’s people ...”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”okay, let’s go now!” I hope your aweto can satisfy me!”

“You won’t be disappointed!” The Tibetan child quickly said,”please follow me!”

With that, the Tibetan child led the way and walked through the familiar alleys.

Xia ruofei could tell that he was very careful. He was trying to avoid crowded places and took turns on the winding paths.

Of course, they could not rule out the possibility that this Tibetan child had ulterior motives and had deliberately brought Xia ruofei to a less crowded place.

However, Xia ruofei was bold because of his skills. Even if the Tibetan child had any tricks up his sleeve, he was not afraid. He followed behind him and looked around from time to time, as if he was very interested in the Tibetan – style buildings in Nagqu County.

“By the way, what’s your name?” Xia ruofei asked casually.

“Sir, my name is gesanluo bu. You can call me Gesang!” The Tibetan child quickly replied.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”Gesang, your Chinese is pretty good!”

Gersun smiled shyly and said,””Sir, my mother is a han. She taught me Chinese.”

“Is that so?” Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows in surprise.

Intermarriage between han and Tibetan was not unheard of, but it was relatively rare.

“My mother passed away when I was eight, so my Chinese is ...” Gersun said sadly.

Xia ruofei patted gersun’s shoulder and said,””I’m sorry!”

Gersun smiled again and said,””Sir, it’s alright! I was indeed very sad when she passed away two years ago, but I’m much better now. I just want to grow up quickly and make a lot of money so that my father won’t have to work so hard to dig wormgrass. ”

Xia ruofei and Gesang chatted as they walked forward. After a while, the two of them reached the middle of a narrow alley. There was a rather dilapidated house here. When they reached the door, they could smell a pungent smell of medicine.

“We’re here!” “Please come in, Sir!” Gersun said.

Then, Gesang opened the door and let Xia ruofei in.

Gesang’s house was a typical Tibetan residence. It was built with stone and had three stories high. There was a small well in the middle. After walking in, they could see that the interior was actually very fine and meaningful. Beautiful auspicious patterns were drawn on the walls, mainly blue, green, and red, symbolizing the blue sky, the land, and the sea.

As soon as the two of them walked in, a middle – aged man’s voice came from the room. He asked loudly in Tibetan, and gersun immediately replied loudly. Xia ruofei could not understand what they were talking about.

Although gersun was young, he seemed to have a high EQ. After he answered, he immediately explained to Xia ruofei,””Sir, my father was asking who came, and I told him I brought a guest to see the aweto.”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

“Please come in, Sir!” Gesang said. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

He brought Xia ruofei to a dimly – lit room where the smell of medicine was the strongest. Xia ruofei could vaguely see a dark – skinned middle – aged man sitting on a bamboo chair. His left leg was swollen and there was some black ointment on it. The pungent smell was from the ointment.

Xia ruofei had learned some Chinese medicine, but he couldn’t tell what medicine he was using. He guessed that it was a Tibetan medicine.

As soon as gersun entered the house, he spoke to his father in Tibetan. Then, his father looked at Xia ruofei and said,””Where did this gentleman come from?”

His Chinese was also quite good. It seemed that he had learned it from his han wife.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”my surname is Xia. I came from the southeast province to buy some high – Quality wormgrass. However, I’m not satisfied with the goods on the market. Gesang said that you have some good wormgrass at home, so I came to take a look.”

Gesang’s father nodded and said,”Hello, Mr. Xia. My name is Solang renzeng. Gesang is right. Our wormgrass was dug up by my relatives and me from the mountain. There are high and low quality wormgrass, but they are definitely authentic twisted wormgrass!”

“Let me take a look at the goods first!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Solang renzeng nodded and gestured to Gesang. Gesang immediately walked out of the house and came back with three or four bags after a while.

“Mr. Xia, these are the Cordyceps that my father personally dug up and dried,” said Gesang.”The quality is the highest in this bag. Two stalks reach one gram!”

After he finished speaking, Gesang looked at Xia ruofei eagerly.

The quality of wormgrass was similar to that of abalones. The bigger the size of a single wormgrass, the more valuable it was. One kilogram of high – Quality wormgrass contained about 2000 wormgrass, and one kilogram contained 2500 wormgrass, 3000 wormgrass. Of course, the better wormgrass contained 1500 wormgrass, and could reach 1000 grams.
