2237 Entering the mushroom house (1)

Huang Lei also made an exaggerated expression and said,””Waa! These are internet famous tea leaves!”

He Jiong gave him a thumbs up and said with a smile,”You know your stuff! Actually, I’ve tried to get one online before, but I can’t get it every time. ”

“Your hand speed is still not as good as the netizens”!”Huang Lei laughed.

“Hehe, I didn’t think that recording a show would have such a benefit!” He Jiong said happily,”I can’t wait! Teacher Huang, you’re good at making tea. Quickly give me a cup!”

“Alright!” Huang Lei rolled up his sleeves and took out a small bag of Da Hong Pao tea leaves from the tea can. He began to skillfully boil water and make tea ...

For the convenience of brewing tea, the tea leaves sold on the internet in Taoyuan Dahongpao were all packed in small bags. One small bag was enough for each tea.

While the two hosts were making jokes, they had actually already advertised for paradise Corporation.

Of course, this was all planned in advance in the program proposal.

It could be said that xiangnan TV was really sincere towards Tao Yuan company.

After a while, the fragrance of tea wafted out from the pergola. Even Peng Chang, who was chopping firewood in the courtyard, couldn’t help but come over and ask for a cup of tea.

Just then, a phone rang in the mushroom house.

He Jiong shouted,”little Xing!” A call came in! Quickly come down and answer it!”

Zhang Xing, who was cleaning up the house on the second floor, immediately replied,””Oh! Alright ...”

Zhang Xing ran down the stairs. The phone was in the corner of the lobby on the first floor. It had been ringing a few times. Zhang Xing was worried that the other party would think that no one had answered the call, so he ran over in a hurry and almost tripped over his slippers.

All these were recorded by the camera and would be edited into the show, so that the fans could see their idol’s real embarrassment, which could also improve the ratings.

With one hand on the table, Zhang Xing quickly picked up the phone with the other. Before he could catch his breath, he said,””Hello!”

An unfamiliar voice came from the phone,””Is this the mushroom hut?”

“Yeah!” Zhang Xing scratched his head and said. Yes! Who are you?”

It was Xia ruofei on the other end of the line. According to the show’s rules, he was not allowed to reveal his identity and he had to try his best not to let the other party guess.

Hence, Xia ruofei changed his voice slightly to make it rougher. He said,””What happened? You can’t even recognize my voice!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Zhang Xing had always been an obedient boy, like a harmless little sheep.

Besides, he really didn’t know who the guest for the first episode would be, so he didn’t need to act at all.

Zhang Xing scratched his head in embarrassment and said,”I ... I can’t guess ...”

Xia ruofei purposely used a thick northeastern accent and even changed his voice. On top of that, he was not from the entertainment industry to begin with. No matter how hard Zhang Xing racked his brain, he would not be able to guess who he was.

“I heard that we can order at your gada?” Xia ruofei asked casually.

“Yes! Yes, I am!” Zhang Xing quickly asked,”what do you want to order? I’ll record it down ...”

At this moment, He Jiong, Huang Lei and Peng Chang also walked into the house. They gathered around the phone.

Huang Lei was also very curious about who the guest for the first episode was. He couldn’t help but ask,””Little Xing, are you here to order?”

Zhang Xing quickly nodded and said,””Yes, yes, yes!”

“Who is it? Who is it?” Peng Chang asked curiously.

“I ... I can’t tell!” Zhang Xing said with a blank face. But ... It seems to be a northeast accent ...”

At this moment, Xia ruofei said on the phone,””Then I want to order a pork stewed with vermicelli!”

He spoke with a strong northeastern accent, so Zhang Xing couldn’t tell for a while. He was stunned for a moment and then said,””Leanyou (pork)... W – what is leanyou?”

Seeing Zhang Xing’s confused look, Huang Lei could not help but say,””Come on! I’ll do it!”

Zhang Xing passed the phone to Huang Lei as if he had been pardoned.

Peng Chang quickly pulled Zhang Xing to the side and asked about the characteristics of the person who made the call. He Jiong, on the other hand, put his ear close to the phone receiver to listen to the conversation between the two.

After Huang Lei took the phone, he said,””Hello! What did you say you wanted?”

“Pork stewed with vermicelli!” Xia ruofei continued to say casually,”can you make this dish?”

Huang Lei immediately understood. He said,””Pork stewed with vermicelli! Aiyo...This...Might be a bit difficult!”

When Zhang Xing heard this, he suddenly came to a realization and said,”Pork with vermicelli? He kept saying ‘rent and rent’,’rent and rent’, I can’t think of pork at all ...”

With his adorkable look, his fans would probably love him to death with some sound effects and subtitles later.

Xia ruofei said,”no way?” You don’t even have pork stewed with vermicelli? Then what kind of restaurant are you opening?”

He Jiong knew that the guest for the first episode was Xia ruofei. When he heard Xia ruofei deliberately speaking with a northeastern accent, he could not help but burst out laughing. He moved closer to the microphone and said loudly,”This student, we don’t own a restaurant!”

He Jiong deliberately added a xiangnan accent in his Mandarin, which made it sound very funny.

“You just want to eat pork stewed with vermicelli, right?” asked Huang Lei.
