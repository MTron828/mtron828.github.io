However, Xia ruofei didn’t act immediately. He just stood quietly in front of the realm stone.

In fact, Xia ruofei’s brain was spinning at full speed.

This was because these array patterns weren’t stationary. Instead, after every change in the array pattern, the location of the transfer would change.

In other words, where the cultivator would be teleported to would depend on the timing of the world stone.

Xia ruofei had been waiting for this moment.

He stared at the brilliant array pattern in front of him and used his brain power to do a lot of complicated calculations.

After a few minutes, Xia ruofei finally found the right time. Then, without hesitation, he stretched out his hand and pressed on the realm stone.

The array pattern trembled slightly, and the teleportation function of the array was activated.

The scene of the stone pillars and the stone platform collapsing appeared in front of him again. However, Xia ruofei did not realize that this was a side effect of the teleportation array. Now, although the scene appeared again, Xia ruofei was not affected at all. This was because the scene was more or less distorted in his eyes and could be easily seen through.

This was the stark difference between Xia ruofei’s current cultivation and strength.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue could only watch as the white light flashed on the Jade stone platform. Then, Xia ruofei disappeared into thin air.

Although they were mentally prepared, the two of them still couldn’t help but subconsciously let out a cry of surprise.

After the flash of white light, the Jade platform returned to its usual tranquility.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue looked at each other.

This kind of quiet environment was actually even more frightening, especially when Xia ruofei had disappeared just like that. The person that the two of them trusted the most was gone. They were more or less feeling a little guilty.

“Wei Wei, where did RUO Fei get sent to?” Ling Qingxue asked in a low voice.

“1 don’t know!” Song Wei shook her head. However, RUO Fei did this because he was confident. He was not a reckless person. Let’s just wait here quietly. Remember RUO Fei’s words, don’t touch the core of the formation without permission.”

Ling Qingxue nodded and said,”yes!” This formation is a bit evil, 1 don’t dare to take the risk! Let’s just obediently wait for RUO Fei!”

At this moment, Xia ruofei’s voice came from behind them.””Hahaha! You guys are quite obedient! 1 couldn’t resist my curiosity and touched the core of the formation.”

The two of them turned around in surprise …

Space and time formations had always been the most complicated formations.

This Space Array was the same. The seemingly simple array pattern actually contained countless changes.

The minute difference in each arc could lead to a completely different result.

The so – called “great Dao is simple” was roughly this principle.

Even with Xia ruofei’s array Dao level, it would still be very difficult for him to completely understand such an array technique.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei was not here to learn about arrays. He did not need to understand the most basic principles. It was enough for him to understand the different possibilities brought about by the changes in the array.

In this place, he only needed to’ know how it is ‘, and not’ know why it is ‘.

Formations served specific purposes, and the main function of this formation was transportation.

Xia ruofei started his analysis from the teleportation function.

He analyzed the different teleportation effects that different array patterns would bring.

This was especially so for the realm stone in the center of the formation. How would the formation be activated upon contact? this was the core of the formation’s function and was also the main point of Xia ruofei’s analysis.

Xia ruofei simulated in his mind again and again how the other array patterns would operate once he touched the realm stone. He also simulated how the teleportation destination would change under the effect of the entire array.

In fact, the amount of calculation required was not low. However, with Xia ruofei’s current array Dao level, he could still manage it.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue stood beside Xia ruofei. Seeing that he was staring at the formation without moving, they did not dare to disturb him. They just stood there quietly.

As time passed, Xia ruofei did not seem to have any intention of taking any further action. Song Wei and Ling Qingxue were not impatient either. They knew that Xia ruofei must be analyzing the array, so they waited patiently at the side.

After a long time, Xia ruofei finally heaved a long sigh of relief and said,””This formation is really exquisite! From the scale of this underground Palace and the design of this formation, it can be seen that the senior who set up this underground Palace had a skill in the Dao of formations that people could only look up to.”

Xia ruofei’s array skills were already enough to make song Wei and Ling Qingxue look up to him. Even in the entire cultivation world today, his array skills could be said to be superior to everyone else.

Even Xia ruofei was full of praise for this formation. It was clear that this was indeed a very exquisite formation.

Song Wei turned to look at Xia ruofei and asked,””RUO Fei, does this mean that … You’ve already seen through the pattern of this formation?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”! have a certain judgment. However … Whether it’s correct or not, it needs to be tested.”

“You’re going to test the array?” Ling Qingxue could not help but ask.

“Of course, time is the only standard to test the truth!” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”if you don’t try it yourself, it’ll always be empty talk.”

“That makes sense!” Ling Qingxue laughed and said,”true knowledge comes from practice!”

Song Wei was a little anxious. She quickly said,”Since we’re going to test the array, then the three of us will do it together!”

Last time, she had been separated from Xia ruofei here, so she had been traumatized.

Now that Xia ruofei wanted to test the array again, Song Wei was reminded of the situation back then. The helpless situation back then had left an indelible shadow in her heart.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,””Wei Wei, there’s no need for that. Although I’m just testing out the function of the formation, I’m actually quite confident in it. There’s no need to be so nervous.”

“But…” Song Wei said anxiously.

“Let me finish.” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”even if my judgment is wrong, I’m confident that I can minimize the danger and return to this jade stone platform without any problems!”

Song Wei secretly sighed and said,””Alright! You’re an expert in formations, I trust your judgment!”

Xia ruofei gently pinched Song Wei’s soft hand and smiled.””Don’t be too nervous. I’m just doing a simple experiment to confirm my judgment. Remember, after I’m teleported away, don’t move and don’t touch the core of the formation. Do you understand?”

Xia ruofei was very serious. Song Wei and Ling Qingxue both nodded in agreement. This was not a joke. If they touched the core of the array, they might really die.

Xia ruofei and Song Wei were lucky that they were not teleported to a dangerous place. Otherwise, they would have died in the underground palace. This could be considered as the ignorant being fearless!

After Xia ruofei had instructed Song Wei and Ling Qingxue, he slowly walked to the center of the Jade stone platform. At the core of the array, the realm stone was placed there quietly. It was exactly the same as when they had first entered.

However, in Xia ruofei’s eyes, this seemingly calm Jade stage was actually filled with all sorts of array patterns. Each array pattern contained several changes and when combined together, there were countless possibilities.

However, Xia ruofei had already done a thorough analysis of the teleportation array’s functions. Hence, the array patterns had evolved into various possibilities in Xia ruofei’s eyes.

He steadily walked to the world stone in the center of the Jade stone platform.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue held their breaths and stared at Xia ruofei without moving.

However, Xia ruofei didn’t act immediately. He just stood quietly in front of the realm stone.

In fact, Xia ruofei’s brain was spinning at full speed.

This was because these array patterns weren’t stationary. Instead, after every change in the array pattern, the location of the transfer would change.

Xia ruofei had been waiting for this moment.
