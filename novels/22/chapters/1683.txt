Chapter 1684: A strange experiment (2)

Everyone knew that even if they were to argue, there would be no result in the end, so they all agreed with director Li’s opinion. After some discussion, they expressed their gratitude to Xia ruofei and let him leave the meeting room.

Xia ruofei fled back to his room. He did not want to stay with these extremely strict experts for another minute.

Initially, Xia ruofei thought that this matter would be over. However, he had underestimated the seriousness of the expert investigators ...

In the morning, Xia ruofei brought Feng Jing to the beach in Saipan to enjoy the ocean. He even snorkeled with the excited Feng Jing.

In fact, to Xia ruofei, the activities of floating on the surface of the sea and sticking one’s head into the water to enjoy the beautiful underwater scenery were child’s play. When Yingluo was in the Army, they had deep diving activities every time they went for sea training. Although they were not as extreme as professional divers, it was much more exciting than playing house on the sea in a life jacket and breathing tube.

However, since Feng Jing was so interested, Xia ruofei did not want to dampen her spirits.

During the snorkeling process, Xia ruofei had no interest in the corals and fish in the shallow sea. His shifty eyes could not help but look elsewhere.

Saipan was a tourist spot, so snorkeling was naturally very popular. He could look at beautiful women instead of corals! And looking at beautiful women in the water was also a different flavor.

The person closest to him was naturally Feng Jing.

Feng Rao was wearing a bikini today. She was usually dressed like a successful career woman, but she looked quite different in a bikini.

Her slender waist and long, firm legs were usually wrapped up tightly. Xia ruofei’s eyes had a feast today.

As he peeked, he muttered in his heart,”I didn’t expect sister ran to be so voluptuous ...

As she was distracted, she happened to meet Feng Jing’s eyes.

Although they were wearing protective goggles, Feng Jing could clearly see Xia ruofei’s admiring gaze. Her heart was beating wildly. Even in the cool sea, she could still feel her face burning.

However, Feng Rao did not avoid Xia ruofei’s gaze. Instead, she was secretly happy.

Xia ruofei, who had been caught red – handed, was a little embarrassed. He quickly turned his head away.

Feng Rao couldn’t help but want to laugh, but she had to shut her mouth tightly because of the respiratory tube in her mouth.

After snorkeling, the two returned to the hotel to take a shower and change their clothes. Then, they went to a local restaurant on the beach and ordered a bunch of chamolo – style dishes, such as red rice, barbecue, coconut crab ... They chose the special ones.

The two of them had just returned to the hotel after a hearty meal when they were stopped in the lobby by director li. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“President Xia! Have you eaten?” Chief physician li asked with a smile.

“I’ve already eaten outside. Director li, what’s wrong ...” Xia ruofei asked.

“I need to talk to you about something. Shall we go over there and have a chat?” Department Director li looked at Feng Jing, and he wanted to say something but stopped himself.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”sure, sister ran, you can go back and rest!”

Feng Jing looked at Department Director li and nodded. She then asked,”Ruofei, how long are we going to stay in Saipan? There were a lot of things to do in Australia! Didn’t you say that we can’t wait for the winery? Also, a domestic company can’t always be left without someone to take charge!”

Director li knew that Feng Jing was actually asking him, so he quickly said,”Madam, the part that requires Mr. Xia’s cooperation will be completed soon. You can leave tomorrow at the earliest!”

“That’s good!” Feng Jing smiled and said,”director Li, I’ll leave you two to your own devices ...”

After she finished speaking, she nodded at director li and walked toward the elevator.

Xia ruofei explained.”President Feng is the president of our company. We went to Australia for a business trip. We didn’t expect to encounter this incident. It delayed a lot of work ... You know, a strong woman who has returned from abroad has her mind full of work ...”

“I understand!” Chief physician li smiled apologetically. I understand!”

The two of them went to the teahouse on the first floor and ordered two drinks. Xia ruofei asked,””Director li, is there anything else that the investigation team needs my cooperation with?”

Director li smiled bitterly.”There’s something that I might have to trouble you with, director Xia. We, from China, are against it, but the United States and Australia insist. So, there’s nothing we can do. I might have to trouble you for a while, director Xia ...”

Then, director li explained the situation to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry after hearing the story.

It turned out that the people from the United States Transportation Safety Committee were still struggling with the matter of the cockpit door. They had sent people to check the plane’s door in the morning, but they didn’t find any obvious quality problems.

However, the hatch had been destroyed, and after the explosion, a lot of data could not be analyzed.

Although it was a good thing that they had successfully broken through the hatch in the air and avoided a serious crash, it might not have been a good thing in the investigation of the accident.

At the very least, the Airbus company was very nervous.

Eager to draw a clear line, they came up with a bad idea, which was to remove a door and locking mechanism from the same – Model plane of Qinba, check the quality first, and then ...

Then, he asked Xia ruofei to use the explosion – proof axe to break open the intact cabin door.

If they could prove that there was no problem with the quality, even if other people could not break it under the same conditions, but Xia ruofei could do it, then they could definitely rule out the quality problem of the Airbus.

In order to avoid suspicion, they even directly used the cabin door of another aircraft of the same model purchased in the same batch by Australian Airlines. This was difficult to fake, so there was no need for Australian Airlines to cooperate with the Airbus to fake it.

Of course, all the expenses were covered by the airline.

For the sake of the company’s reputation, they were really going all out.

This plan seemed a little unreliable, but it received full support from experts in Australia and the United States

After Xia ruofei heard this, he was a little dumbfounded.””You ... You want me to destroy another intact cabin door? Are you sure they’re not stupid?”

Director Li said with a smile,”I thought I heard wrong at that time. We also mentioned that in an emergency, human potential may be unleashed. If you do it again, you may not be able to break open the hatch. However, they insisted on giving it a try. Besides, the airline is not short of money ...”

“How long will it take?” Xia ruofei frowned and asked,”I really have an emergency in Australia. I can’t afford to be delayed!”

“Oh, it’s like this. The plane they’re going to use for the test is at quodaine’s base.” Director li quickly said,”they have already dismantled the hatch and the locking mechanism. They are preparing to arrange for you to fly to Australia tomorrow morning and cooperate with them to complete this experiment. You can leave after that!”

Xia ruofei let out a sigh of relief and said,””That’s more like it! Alright! I’ll go crazy with them this time ...”

Chief physician li let out a long breath and said,””Thank you, director Xia! Thank you, President Xia ...”

Since Xia ruofei was a Chinese, the investigation team naturally sent representatives from China to do the work. However, director li had inquired about Xia ruofei’s situation before leaving the country. Chief Xue had also hinted to him. Director li knew that if Xia ruofei insisted on not cooperating, he would not be able to force him.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei was easy to talk to. He only complained a little and agreed to the ridiculous experiment.

When Xia ruofei returned to his room, he passed by Feng Jing’s room in the corridor. Seeing that the door was not closed, he knocked on it and walked in.

“What did that director li want with you?” Feng Rao asked with a smile.

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry as he told Feng Jing about the investigation team’s strange experiment plan. Feng Jing was also dumbfounded after hearing it.

“Are you really going to do this experiment with them?” Feng Rao smiled and asked,”if you can’t break it this time, won’t it ruin your image?” Maybe the situation was urgent and your potential exploded ...”

What Feng Jing said was very similar to what department Director Li said.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”there’s no’ what if ‘. As long as they don’t mind the money, I can break open as many doors as they want!” We’ll fly to Australia tomorrow. Once we get off the plane, we’ll hack open their cabin doors and then we’ll leave!”
