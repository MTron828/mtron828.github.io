2779 Super big surprise_1

In fact, even the flight crew of the peach source felt that this landing on peach source Island was different from the previous few times. It was as if the air was much sweeter.

However, they were just ordinary people, so their sense of spirit Qi was not as strong as that of cultivators like Song Wei and Ling Qingxue.

Ling Qingxue and Song Wei felt as if they had entered the legendary holy mountain and Immortal Island after the plane landed.

This feeling was much stronger than the one in the villa at the array eye of the Paradise gathering. After all, the level of the Taixu xuanqing array was much higher than that of the Paradise gathering’s natural array. Moreover, the coverage of the two arrays could not be mentioned in the same breath.

The flight attendant quickly opened the cabin door. Xia ruofei, Ling Qingxue, and Song Wei stepped out of the plane.

Li Yifu and Zheng Yongshou were waiting on the tarmac. As soon as the cabin door opened, the two of them quickly greeted him.

After Ling Qingxue stepped onto the tarmac, she sniffed and felt the rich spirit Qi on the island. She then asked, ” “RUO Fei, when did you find such a place? It’s like an Immortal Island!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,” how is it? ” I’m not exaggerating, am I? With this Island rich in spiritual energy, I won’t have to worry about cultivation resources in the future, right? ”

“Yes, yes!” Ling Qingxue and Song Wei both nodded.

At this moment, Li Yifu and Zheng Yongshou walked up.

“Senior granduncle!”

“Mr. Xia!”

The two of them bowed respectfully and greeted him. Because Xia ruofei had given instructions in advance, Zheng Yongshou addressed Xia ruofei as “Mr. Xia” instead of “master”.

Li Yifu’s identity wasn’t a secret to Song Wei and Ling Qingxue, so there was no need for him to change his words.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” You’ve all worked hard! Foster husband, has the Taixu xuanqing formation been operating normally these past few days?”

“Everything is normal, martial granduncle!” Li Yifu said respectfully,”as the array operates, the concentration of spirit Qi in the array continues to rise, and it has now reached an equilibrium.”

Xia ruofei nodded. Once he entered the range of the formation, he could already feel that the Taixu xuanqing formation was in a very stable state.

Then, Xia ruofei said to Li Yifu,””Get benilatti to arrange for the crew to stay in the best hotel in Evarts Island!”

“Alright!” Li Yifu nodded and said.

At this time, the captain, Liu An, had just gotten off the plane. He heard Xia ruofei’s words and quickly said,””Thank you, Mr. Xia!”

In fact, the flight crew could also stay on Peach Garden Island. There were many guest rooms in the building on the island, but they were all empty now. However, if they stayed on Peach Garden Island, there were no entertainment facilities at the moment, and they could not walk around freely. There were many places that were forbidden. Comparatively, of course, the conditions on Evarts Island were better and freer.

Li Yifu called benilati. The restricted area on the island – which benilati was originally supervising on the construction site – had already been divided. However, some of the previous greenery and environmental projects had not been completed and looked unsightly, so Li Yifu asked benilati to recruit some workers from ponaattu to improve these places. After receiving Li Yifu’s call, benilati quickly handed over the supervision work to a Foreman, Then, he rushed to the airport.

Xia ruofei, Ling Qingxue, and Song Wei got into Li Yifu’s Land Rover and left the airport for “Tao Yuan building”. The project department building in Qin Zhuan was also named as Tao Yuan building by Xia ruofei. It had the same name as the headquarters of the Tao Yuan company in San Shan. However, there was no confusion here.

Xia ruofei had reserved the best suite in the building for Ling Qingxue and Song Wei.

In fact, he could stay in the same room as them. There was more than one room in the suite. However, in front of Li Yifu, a junior in the sect, Xia ruofei felt that he should be more careful and maintain his image as an elder in the sect. Therefore, he chose a room that was close to the suite.

Xia ruofei led Ling Qingxue and Song Wei to the room and said with a smile,””You can live here when you are on the island! You can choose your own room! Any room has an unrivaled ocean view, and most importantly, it’s rich in spiritual energy, so you can cultivate anytime, anywhere!”

“En!” Ling Qingxue nodded and asked casually,”where are you staying?”

“I’m in the next room. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”if you need me to help you with your cultivation, you can come and find me anytime!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Ling Qingxue’s face turned red and she glared at Xia ruofei.

“Actually, I’m also thinking about finding you a new set of martial arts. Otherwise, there will be too many restrictions when you cultivate,” said Xia ruofei seriously.

Ling Qingxue and Song Wei had to practice the “absolute beginning Scripture” together with Xia ruofei for the effect to be better. If they practiced it alone, it would be worse than a normal technique. Therefore, once Xia ruofei was not by their side, their progress would slow down. This was the biggest disadvantage of this technique.

Of course, this couldn’t be considered a disadvantage, because this was originally prepared for Dao companions. Basically, Dao companions among cultivators would often be together, so there naturally wouldn’t be such a problem.

“It’s okay, I’m fine like this!”Song Wei quickly said.

“Mm! In fact, we’re not in such a hurry to increase our cultivation!” Ling Qingxue chimed in,”if I were to change to another technique, I would have to start from the beginning again. I would find it troublesome!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. It was rare for these two girls to have the same opinion, but they were actually slacking off. If an ordinary person could obtain the cultivation technique in Xia ruofei’s jade talisman of inheritance, they would be overjoyed. Only these two silly girls had actually rejected it.

It would not be easy to find a suitable martial art for the two of them that would not conflict with the “absolute beginning Scripture”. Since they had said so, Xia ruofei put this thought aside for the time being.

He took the two to the terrace outside the suite and pointed to the sea in the distance.””Aside from the factor of cultivation, the scenery here is also quite good. It’s basically the original ecology. Except for some necessary construction, the scenery on the island has not been destroyed by a large number of human activities. Therefore, it’s actually quite good to take a vacation here!”

Song Wei herself had some artistic plots. She nodded in agreement and said,””This is the so – called life of facing the sea and the flowers blooming in spring! This place was really great! I don’t even want to leave!”

“I’ll stay for as long as I want!” Xia ruofei said straightforwardly,”the entire peach source Island is mine, so it’s Naturally Yours. Even Huaxia’s laws can’t control this place. All you need to do is to have fun and cultivate to your heart’s content. You don’t need to care about anything else!”

“En!” Song Wei nodded and said,”I’ll try to stay longer. I’m not particularly busy with my research project.”

“There are a few islands nearby, but the tourism development is not particularly perfect. It’s not a problem if you want to visit them. I’ll get someone to arrange it!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Ruofei, I feel that there are very few people on the island! Don’t you have any staff here?” Ling Qingxue asked curiously.

Xia ruofei pulled the two of them to the chairs on the balcony and said,””There used to be a lot of staff here. Otherwise, how could there be so many buildings on the island? However, I had them return to China in batches. It’s a little complicated, so I’ll tell you slowly. ”

Then, Xia ruofei told him about how he had treated the old man of the Liu family, how old man Liu had given him the Peach Blossom Island as a gift of thanks, how he had found a natural formation on the island, and how he had found a way to activate the formation.

Of course, he didn’t mention anything about the star Seizer sect’s plot to seize the Peach Blossom Island.

Xia ruofei did not want Ling Qingxue and Song Wei to come into contact with the dark side of the world of cultivation too early. He hoped that they would always have a beautiful vision of cultivation, which would actually be good for their cultivation.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue listened with great interest. Even without the star Seizer sect incident, Xia ruofei’s journey of obtaining the Peach Blossom Island was rather complicated and bizarre.

Xia ruofei finally said,”so, the reason why the spiritual energy on the island is so rich is actually all thanks to the Taixu xuanqing formation.” In order to activate this great formation, my foster husband has also made a great contribution. We should thank him for being able to have such a precious cultivation land!”

Xia ruofei paused and continued,””The Taixu xuanqing formation is a comprehensive formation. Not only does it have the effect of gathering spirit energy, but it’s also very strong in the defense of the island. So, there are actually many confusion formations and killing formations on the island. Usually, the position of these formations is fixed, and they can change positions when defending against enemies. I’ve asked my foster husband to block these fixed positions with barbed wire. They can be considered the island’s restricted area! You should also be careful not to make any mistakes, or you might be injured by the formation. ”

Ling Qingxue and Song Wei both nodded, indicating that they had remembered it.

“In addition, the island still needs some staff to maintain the operation of the entire Island. These staff will gradually be in place.” Xia ruofei continued,”I’ve also set up a guard team. Most of the members are veterans from my old army. They’ve already gathered at the three mountains. After a short training, they’ll be stationed on Peach Blossom Island.”

“This Island is so important. We do need to choose people we trust very much for the staff.” Song Wei nodded and said.

“Don’t worry!” Xia ruofei smiled.”I have a way to screen everyone. In the future, I will do it from time to time. People with evil intentions will not be able to sneak in.”

Just as the three of them were chatting about Paradise Island, Xia ruofei’s phone rang. He took it out and saw that it was Wu Lei calling from Spain.

...

He swiped his phone and answered the call with a smile,””Wu Lei! Is there something you need?”
