2309 One drink and one Peck_“Yes, yes, yes!” Ge Jun quickly said. Junior brother’s suggestion is very good!”

With that, Ge Jun knelt down towards the West without a second word and kowtowed three times without hesitation.

Xia ruofei saw that when he stood up, there was a red mark on his forehead. It was clear that the three kowtows were real.

Xia ruofei smiled as he helped Ge Jun up and said,””Senior brother GE, this apprenticeship gift is complete! In the future, I will pass on the [three volumes of cloud contact] to Shixiong on behalf of master! I definitely won’t hide anything!”

“Thank you, Junior Brother Xia!” Ge Jun said with a straight face.

“Junior Brother, back then ... Were master’s ashes scattered in Min River?” Ge Jun asked.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,””Yup! Is there anything I can help you with, senior brother?”

Ge Jun said,”today’s ceremony is a bit simple, but it’s an emergency!” I’m going to pay my respects to him at the min River tomorrow. At the same time, I’m going to officially report to him about my apprenticeship. ”

Ge Jun quickly explained,”Although master has told Junior Brother not to worship him and not to leave his ashes, it is a very serious matter to acknowledge a master. I think that as a special case, there will be no next time. Master will definitely not take offense ...”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. As expected, a lie would need a few more lies to cover it up.

Xia ruofei had no choice but to say,”Okay then ... But senior brother GE, I can’t leave with uncle song’s current condition. As for paying respects to master, I can only ...”

“I’ll go by myself!” Ge Jun hurriedly said,”you can treat Secretary song in peace! Master is a kind – hearted doctor. He knows that you can’t go because you want to save the dying and heal the injured, so he won’t blame you!”

Xia ruofei heaved a sigh of relief and nodded.””Alright then! I’ll have to trouble senior brother to bring some paper money for me to burn tomorrow for master!”

“Don’t worry!” Ge Jun smiled and nodded.

Following that, Ge Jun and Xia ruofei exchanged contact information. Xia ruofei realized that this old man also used WeChat. He could not help but sigh. With the development of the mobile internet, an instant messaging tool like WeChat could really cover all age groups ...

Ge Jun added Xia ruofei’s WeChat and saved his phone number. He looked at the unconscious song Qiming on the bed and smiled.””Junior Brother, I won’t disturb you any longer ... I’ll come and find you again after I pay my respects to my master tomorrow. We can sit down and discuss Secretary song’s situation. I’m sure we can find a way!”

“That’s very thoughtful of you, senior. ” Xia ruofei smiled.

Xia ruofei personally sent Ge Jun out of the ward, then went to the doctor’s office to give him some instructions before returning.

He couldn’t help but feel a little emotional. In just a short while, he had somehow gotten himself a senior brother? Furthermore, this senior brother was a leading figure in China’s Chinese medicine world. More importantly, even though the two of them were senior and junior in name, he could tell that Ge Jun still regarded him as his teacher and respected him from the bottom of his heart.

What would Li Yifu think if he knew that he had taken in a Junior Brother? Xia ruofei thought to himself mischievously.

In fact, these were two completely different things. Li Yifu was the grandnephew of the martial arts world, while Ge Jun was the senior of the Chinese medicine world. The two were not related at all.

For example, for some Quyi actors, the crosstalk and Pingshu sects, or the dagu sects, they would all have a Master – disciple relationship, and even their seniority would be different.

Xia ruofei threw these messy thoughts aside and sat down on song Qiming’s bed.

Now that there was no one to disturb him, he could finally try to check out song Qiming’s consciousness.

One had to be extremely careful when exploring one’s sea of consciousness, especially when song Qiming was a mortal who had never cultivated before. That made it even more important to be careful. A single mistake could cause permanent damage to one’s sea of consciousness.

Therefore, when Xia ruofei sent Ge Jun out, he specifically went to the doctor’s office to give some instructions. He mainly told him that he was going to treat song Qiming with Chinese medicine and that no one was to disturb him during the process. He also told the doctor on duty not to go in and disturb him before he left the ward.

If it was any other patient’s family member who made such a weird request, the doctor on duty would probably scold him to death. However, Xia ruofei’s situation was special. In terms of song Qiming’s treatment, he had a superior position. Director Chen had already instructed him about this. Therefore, even though he was dissatisfied, the doctor on duty reluctantly agreed.

Xia ruofei did not make a move immediately. Instead, he sat in front of the bed with his eyes closed. After a long time, he felt that he was in his best condition. He then put his finger on song Qiming’s pulse with a serious expression ...

A thick strand of mental energy entered song Qiming’s meridians.

As he had performed the spirit body Fusion with Song Wei and Ling Qingxue many times, Xia ruofei was very familiar with the position of the human body’s meridians and sea of consciousness. He controlled his mental power with precision and directed it to song Qiming’s meridians, heading straight for his sea of consciousness.

After all, song Qiming was over 50 years old. He had been working at the desk for a long time and lacked exercise. Hence, his meridians were very narrow. Some places were even blocked. This made it difficult for Xia ruofei to push his spiritual power forward.

After all, he had carefully condensed his mental power into a thin line and moved it through song Qiming’s meridians.

Although mind power was invisible, if he lost control of his mind power, his meridians would be damaged. More importantly, if his mind power ran amok in song Qiming’s body, there was a high chance that it would cause irreversible damage to his sea of consciousness. Hence, Xia ruofei did not dare to be careless. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Fortunately, his control over his spiritual power was already at the point of perfection. In a short while, Xia ruofei felt that his spiritual power had already reached the periphery of song Qiming’s sea of consciousness ...
