Xia ruofei wanted to make a body tempering soup.

When Xia ruofei first obtained the body tempering soup recipe from the booklet in the stone room, there were two versions.

Of course, he didn’t intend to brew a complete version of the body tempering soup with the addition of the petals of the spirit Heart Flower. He only planned to use ordinary medicinal herbs to brew a simplified version of the body tempering soup.

After all, Wu Lei was not a martial artist who specialized in body cultivation. He did not need to improve his physical fitness to such a terrifying level. Furthermore, although Xia ruofei had accumulated quite a number of spirit Heart Flower petals, there were too many uses for them. He would not waste them easily.

The simplified version of the body tempering soup required ordinary Chinese herbs. Xia ruofei had a large stock of these Chinese herbs in the spirit map space. They were not particularly expensive. In fact, as long as they could be bought with money, Xia ruofei did not need to be restricted. He could use them whenever he needed.

Although Xia ruofei had not made the body tempering soup for a while, the Kasaya was not very helpful to him now. However, his control was much better than before, so he made it very smoothly.

Xia ruofei checked the body tempering soup. After confirming that there was nothing wrong with it, he kept it in the spirit map space. Then, he went to the bathroom to take a shower and went back to his bedroom to sleep.

The next day, Xia ruofei woke up a little earlier. He took out the body tempering soup that he had brewed the night before from the medium and began to heat it on the clay stove.

At half past six, Wu Lei rang the doorbell to Xia ruofei’s room.

When Xia ruofei opened the door, Wu Lei immediately smelled a medicinal fragrance. The misty body tempering soup was different from ordinary Chinese medicine. It did not have a strong medicinal smell. Instead, it had a light fragrance. However, this fragrance was also mixed with a faint medicinal smell, which was very comfortable to smell.

Of course, this was all on the surface. In reality, the body tempering soup was not as gentle as it smelled. Its medicinal properties were very strong. Even if it was a simplified version of the body tempering soup without the petals of the spirit Heart Flower, its medicinal properties were still stronger than the average body tempering medicine. If Wu Lei had not practiced the first set of body – tempering movements of the Golden Man, Xia ruofei would not have made the body tempering soup for him to consume.

The reason was simple. He was worried that Wu Lei’s body would not be able to take it.

In fact, Xia ruofei suspected that the so – called simplified version of the body tempering soup was the real original formula. The version with the petals of the spirit Heart Flower should be an improvement on the foundation of the original body tempering soup by the previous owner of the spirit map world, spiritual master Shan He, after obtaining the spirit heart tree, to make the medicinal effect stronger.

When Xia ruofei saw Wu Lei, he immediately smiled and said,” “You’re just in time. The medicine is just warm now. Hurry up and come in!”

Wu Lei walked into the room and immediately saw the bowl of body tempering soup that was being heated on the clay stove in the small living room. He couldn’t help but be stunned for a moment and then asked,” “President Xia, this … This is for me?”

Xia ruofei nodded casually and said,””Yup! This is also a medicine to train the body. When combined with the body – tempering movement I told you to do yesterday, the effect will be even better! Don’t worry, it’s all made from Chinese medicine. There won’t be any stimulants, so you can take it without worry!”

Wu Lei could not help but feel touched. Although everyone was born equal, objectively speaking, Xia ruofei’s status was much higher than his. Moreover, the two of them could be said to have never met before, but Xia ruofei spared no effort to help him become stronger.

It was only half past six in the morning, but Xia ruofei had already prepared the medicinal soup for him to take as soon as he arrived. It could be seen how early Xia ruofei had woken up, and all of this was to help him.

Wu Lei’s eyes reddened at the thought of this. He was in a foreign country and the competition was much more intense than in China. At this time, his heart was even more fragile. Xia ruofei had helped him without thinking about how to repay him. He was naturally very touched.

This was the difference between sending charcoal in the snow and adding flowers to brocade.

Wu Lei looked at the bowl of fragrant medicinal soup in a daze. His voice was a little choked,””President Xia, I … I really don’t know how to thank you …”

Xia ruofei laughed and waved his hand. “Let’s not talk about this, we are fellow countrymen! In this foreign country, they should help each other. In addition … You really don’t have to be so formal. I seem to be a few months older than you! You can call me big brother Xia from now on, and I’ll call you Lei Zi, how about it?”

“Alright!” Wu Lei nodded and said,”brother Xia, then … I’m going to climb up the social ladder?”

Xia ruofei laughed and patted Wu Lei’s shoulder. “What’s there to be concerned about? Everyone is equal, but you and I hit it off, so we call each other brothers. It’s that simple!”

Then, Xia ruofei removed the bowl from the stove and said,””Lei Zi, I have to make one thing clear to you first, that is, this bowl of medicinal soup is also used to train the body. The effects of the medicine are a little strong, and the pain is even more intense than yesterday’s body training. It’s up to you to decide if you want to take it or not.”

“I want to drink!” Wu Lei said without much thought. Brother Xia, I can take it no matter how much it hurts!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”okay!” Test the temperature. As long as you can bear it, drink it in one gulp. This medicine must be drunk while it’s hot. Remember … After you drink, immediately do the set of movements I taught you yesterday. I will correct the deviation for you at the first moment. Only in this way can you absorb the medicine as soon as possible and reduce the pain. Otherwise, your body can’t take it and you may faint. Then, not only will it be a waste of effort, but it may also cause harm. “Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com
