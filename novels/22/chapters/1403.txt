However, he had to admire Jiang Liangyu’s level. His few simple words had aroused everyone’s interest. Originally, the reporters were not interested in the leader’s speech. They just had to record it and summarize the main points and write them into the article. However, Jiang Liangyu’s short words made the reporters curious and they kept looking at Xia ruofei.

Jiang Liangyu smiled and said,”the biggest common point is that we used to be soldiers!” Reporters who knew President Xia well might know that he was an excellent soldier before he started his business! I was also a military officer who served as a coastal guard in the southeast province for a long time!”

At this point, Jiang Liangyu paused for a moment and then continued,””I understand that President Xia’s company has hired many retired veterans to help them solve their livelihood problems and give them very good treatment! I’m very touched. President Xia was a good soldier when he was in the Army, and now he’s turned around and become an entrepreneur. He’s also an outstanding entrepreneur!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile bitterly to himself. Why is Yingying praising me on stage? Wasn’t this Mayor Jiang a little off topic?

Recently, Xia ruofei had wanted to keep a low profile and not be in the limelight. When he attended the press conference, he had told Xue Jinshan in advance that he would not go on stage or speak, but he still did not manage to prevent it ...

Jiang Liangyu continued,”at the same time, I also noticed that the Paradise Corporation has also set up a charity fund of ten million US dollars. While the company is developing, they don’t forget to give back to society. This time, they have even set up a special fund for people with autism. They also promised to donate no less than 10000 boxes of heart – nourishing soup every year. All of this is a manifestation of the social responsibility of a company!”

After beating around the bush for a long time, Jiang Liangyu finally entered the main topic and began to speak with fervor and assurance.

Of course, his previous words were not in vain. Those down – to – Earth words were well – received by the reporters and successfully made them notice Xia ruofei.

For the reporters, the leader’s impassioned speech on stage could not arouse any enthusiasm from them. On the contrary, it made them drowsy. Jiang Hua, who had a little bit of domestic affairs like Jiang Liangyu, was easy to listen to.

Jiang Liangyu’s speech could only be regarded as a cliché. It was nothing more than an affirmation of the social responsibility of the Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory and even the Taoyuan company. He also expressed optimism about the prospects of the heart – nourishing soup in the medical market. At the same time, he also expressed support for the Taoyuan company on behalf of the local government.

However, he was a very good person. Even if it was a cliché speech, it was full of wittiness. The reporters were more convinced by him and gave him warm applause.

Since Jiang Liangyu had come down from the stage, today’s new drug launch could be considered to have ended successfully.

Xue Jinshan walked up the stage and said with a smile,”Alright, thank you to all the leaders, media friends, and paradise corporation’s employees for your support and support! Today’s press conference came to an end! Please exit in an orderly manner from the east side of the venue. We have prepared a hand – to – hand gift at the East door. It’s a Jade skin cream Series produced by our Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory! Everyone can use their entrance cards to exchange for it!”

The media reporters who had already started packing up and leaving couldn’t help but cheer softly, especially the female reporters, who were so excited that they almost jumped.

Although the snow series was the cheapest basic style the jaded skin cream on sale and the nationwide unified price was 588 Yuan a set, it was particularly difficult to buy it because it was relatively cheap. It was basically out of stock every time they snapped up.

Several female reporters tried to get one three times but failed. This was great. They were given a free set for free just by attending the press conference. It was definitely a big surprise for them.

A bold reporter jokingly said,””Manager Xue, for the sake of the jadeshi ointment, I’ll definitely use the most beautiful words to promote your heart – nourishing soup when I get back!”

On stage, Xue Jinshan was also smiling as he cupped his hands in the direction of the reporters.

This was naturally a joke.

In fact, Jiang Liangyu and he kun’s presence today had already set the tone for the media reporters.

Furthermore, the entire press conference today was so harmonious and full of positive energy. Most of the reporters had a conscience and hot blood. Regardless of whether they had a gift or not, the articles that came out today would definitely be filled with praise.

When the reporters left, Xia ruofei and the rest were not in a hurry to leave.

Jiang Liangyu returned to his seat. Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and said,””Mayor Jiang, you’re really flattering me today!”

Jiang Liangyu laughed and said,”What do you mean, President Xia?” How could it be overpraising? I’m just telling the truth! Which part of me was exaggerating? You didn’t recruit a large number of retired veterans? Or did you not set up a charity fund? Or is the scale of the fund exaggerated?”

“No...” Xia ruofei said,”but ...”

“That’s it!” Jiang Liangyu said,”I’m just telling the truth. This is all positive energy and should be vigorously promoted!”

Never debate with a leader, because no matter if it was from the front or the back, you would never be able to win.

“Mayor Jiang, I guess you were a political commissar when you were in the Army, right?” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.

Jiang Liangyu laughed and said,”President Xia, I was a platoon leader, an instructor, an officer in an organization, and a Battalion instructor. However, I changed my career before I could become a political commissar. My first job after changing my career was a political instructor in a University ...”

“Isn’t that the same!” Xia ruofei said,”I knew it! It’s obvious that he came from a political background. His standard of speech is really high!”

Jiang Liangyu laughed and patted Xia ruofei’s shoulder,””President Xia, if there’s a chance, let’s get to know each other more. Although I’m a political worker, I don’t like to do empty work. I still prefer to do practical work!”

“I can tell!” Xia ruofei also said sincerely,”Mayor Jiang not only has a high level of theoretical knowledge, but he also has a lot of practical work experience!”

“Is this mutual flattery?” Jiang Liangyu asked humorously.

He kun, who was standing at the side, could not help but ask,””Mayor Jiang, this is called mutual appreciation!”

Jiang Liangyu couldn’t help but laugh heartily. He looked gentle and refined, but at this moment, he seemed to have the shadow of a soldier. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Leaders, we’ve prepared some lunch. Do us a favor and have lunch together!” Xia ruofei said.

Jiang Liangyu immediately said,”there’s no need to eat!” President Xia, if there’s a chance, let’s meet in private!”

“Yeah!” He kun also nodded. It’s more sensitive in this aspect now. President Xia, please understand!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”of course I understand!” Then it’s settled. I’ll make the arrangements for the weekend. Leaders, please come along!”

“If it’s the weekend, no problem!” Jiang Liangyu said with a smile.

“We have no reason to reject President Xia’s invitation!” He kun also said with a smile.

The reason Jiang Liangyu could attend the press conference today was because paradise Corporation was a star company, and the heart – nourishing soup was one of the guided medicine lists issued by the Wei and family planning Commission. However, on the other hand, song Qiming’s influence was also a factor.

Otherwise, there were plenty of companies with social influence. Mayor Jiang might not have to attend all of them. There were many ways to express his importance. Sending a congratulatory letter meant he valued them, sending a Secretary to send a flower basket meant he valued them, asking the leaders of the relevant departments in the city to attend meant he valued them, and even if he attended personally, it also meant he valued them.

Therefore, Jiang Liangyu was also very happy to have more contact with Xia ruofei.

There was no need to talk about he kun. He had seen Xia ruofei’s shocking connections in the capital. After returning to the three mountains, everyone still had a lot of polite interactions.

After everyone agreed, Xia ruofei personally sent the two big bosses out of the venue and into their car. After watching the car leave, he returned to the venue to meet up with Feng Jing, Xue Jinshan, and the rest.

Since the press conference was a success, it was necessary to hold a celebration party.

There were still a lot of production tasks at the pharmaceutical factory, and it was necessary to boost their morale. Hence, Xia ruofei had already asked the administrative team to make arrangements in advance. Today, he would personally bring the company’s middle – ranking and above leaders to celebrate the success of the Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory.
