2105 The king of the building (1)

The next morning, Xia ruofei and Feng Jing had breakfast in the canteen and drove to the jiangbin villa district.

Ling Qingxue did not go to work today because they had already agreed on this beforehand. She stayed at home to wait for Xia ruofei and Feng Jing.

When Xia ruofei’s car entered the villa district, he gave Ling Qingxue a call, so she had already come out in advance and was waiting at the door.

Xia ruofei stopped the car and stuck his head out to wave at Ling Qingxue. He smiled and said,””Qingxue, get in the car!”

“Uncle Jiang’s Villa isn’t far from here, let’s just walk there!” Ling Qingxue said with a smile. You can also take a look at the neighborhood’s environment. ”

“That works too!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll park the car at your house!”

Ling Qingxue nodded and opened the door of the villa. Xia ruofei slowly drove the car in.

The two of them alighted from the car, and Ling Qingxue greeted them with a smile.””Hello, Sister Che!”

Feng Rao also greeted Ling Qingxue with a smile.””Qingxue, thank you for your hard work today!”

“What’s so hard about it?”Ling Qingxue asked. I’ll take you to see the house. It’s much easier than working ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”let’s go!” Let’s talk while we walk!”

“Mm! Come with me!” Ling Qingxue said.

The three of them walked out of the Ling family’s mansion and headed towards the river.

Ling Qingxue explained as they walked,”ruofei, the row closest to Min River is filled with individual villas. It’s just that the location of the river is different, and the specifications of the houses are different. Uncle Jiang’s Villa can be said to have the best view in the entire community. It’s also the largest one. It can be said to be the king of apartments! Hey! It’s over there ...”

Xia ruofei looked in the direction that Ling Qingxue was pointing at. A villa stood quietly a few hundred meters away. Among the row of villas, that villa happened to be in a protruding position. It faced Min River at least 270 degrees without any blind spots.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it looks pretty good!” Qingxue, this uncle Jiang has good taste! When I bought this villa back then, its value has increased by more than ten times!”

Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”uncle Jiang bought it for his own vacation!” It was not just for investment. “Moreover, the turnover rate of the villa business is not high. When he is in urgent need of money, it is not as easy to sell it as it is for the small property. For example, this time, he raised funds to sell the villa. Not many people came to understand. Some people came to see it, and although they were very satisfied, they flinched once they understood the price.”

“You’re saying that I’m stupid and rich!” Xia ruofei said with a bitter face.

Ling Qingxue chuckled.”You overestimate yourself ... I agree with you if you’re stupid, but you have a lot of money ... Hehehe!”

Feng Jing felt uncomfortable and jealous when she saw Xia ruofei and his wife flirting with each other.

Ling Qingxue felt it too. After all, Feng Rao was a guest. If she kept talking to Xia ruofei and ignored Feng Rao, it was obviously not the way to treat a guest.

She turned to Feng Jing and said,”sister Jing, let’s take a look at this villa first. Then, I’ll bring you to another townhouse. It’s not far from here. It’s in that direction. It’s only a ten – minute walk.”

“It’s fine,” Feng Jing said with a smile.”We’ll follow your arrangements today!”

The three of them chatted as they walked, and they soon arrived at the villa.

Xia ruofei only realized that this villa was bigger than the Ling family’s one when they got closer. From the outside, it looked like a three – story building with a large courtyard in front. The design was very impressive and was not the traditional style. The designer had cleverly pieced a few cuboids together to form the main body of the villa. The protruding parts of the villa had several balconies of various sizes and large glass curtains. It looked very modern.

Ling Qingxue opened the door and smiled.””Let’s go! I’ll bring you guys in for a tour!”

Xia ruofei and Feng Rao followed Ling Qingxue into the front yard of the villa.

The Evergreen plants in the yard were still full of vitality in the winter, and the turf was also very neat. It was obvious that it was well maintained.

In addition to a few parking spaces in the courtyard, there was also a sunken garage. The car could pass through a clean asphalt path and slowly go downhill from the side of the courtyard to directly drive into the garage.

Ling Qingxue led the two of them into the villa. As soon as they entered, Xia ruofei let out a sigh of relief. He knew that this villa belonged to Ling Xiaotian’s old friend, so he had been worried that he would see all kinds of Chinese – style decorations and mahogany furniture. After all, rich people of that age liked this kind of style.

Although the Chinese style was not bad, Xia ruofei preferred a simpler style of decoration. He always felt that the Chinese style of decoration was too heavy, and it would be a bit depressing to live in it. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei did not really like the European style. He felt that it was too complicated and not easy.

After entering the house, Xia ruofei realized that his worries were unnecessary.

Obviously, this uncle Jiang was not a fan of the Chinese style. On the contrary, the entire villa’s decoration style was minimalistic. It used a lot of black, white, and gray colors, simple and bright. At the same time, it was also matched with some small bright colors as decoration. It made people feel relaxed and not too monotonous. It was perfect for Xia ruofei’s ideal residence.
