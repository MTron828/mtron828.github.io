Chapter 780: Chapter 516 – a turtle in a jar (3)

However, time was also very tight. If they lost contact with kappei Shani, these Japanese would soon find out.

Hence, Xia ruofei quickly took out his phone and called Guo Zhan.

Guo Zhan was woken up from his sleep by his phone. He picked it up in a daze and saw that it was Xia ruofei calling. He immediately picked it up.

“What’s wrong, Blood Wolf?”

“Wolf King, did you rest well?” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”wake up all the brothers! I’ve found the Japanese’s hideout. It’s time to act!”

Guo Zhan’s sleepiness was gone all of a sudden. He said,”You little brat! Didn’t you tell me you were going back to the farm? Who allowed you to go and investigate without permission? They are simply unorganized and undisciplined!”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”Wolf King, let’s gather the team!” You can criticize me however you want later! I killed one of their hidden sentries, so they should be aware of it soon. We have to take advantage of the time before they move to capture them all!”

When Guo Zhan heard this, he didn’t have the mood to criticize Xia ruofei anymore. He quickly said,””Where are you now?”

Xia ruofei said,”in area No. 1!” You guys come over quickly! I’ll be waiting for you at the entrance of the road! Remember to be fully armed!”

“Good! I’ll see you later!”

After the phone call with Guo Zhan, Xia ruofei marked the personnel, equipment, and Liang Qiming’s location on the map and continued to monitor the entire abandoned brick factory patiently.

When he felt that it was about time, Xia ruofei recalled the Hornet he had sent out to investigate.

Before that, Xia ruofei had them do a final check of the perimeter. After confirming that the three hidden sentries were still in their original positions, he put the Hornet and laptop into the spirit map space.

......

Xia ruofei brought Blackie along their original route and returned to the intersection of the mechanical road. After waiting for less than five minutes, they saw two business cars driving over.

Xia ruofei stood up from the grass by the road and waved at them.

The MPV drove into the road and stopped.

After getting off the car, Guo Zhan threw a pile of equipment to Xia ruofei and said,”Hurry up and change your clothes!”

Jungle camouflage, Kevlar helmet, bulletproof vest, combat boots, bone conduction headphones, anti – explosive walkie – talkie, tactical gloves, Type 95 automatic rifle ...

Xia ruofei held the familiar equipment in his hands. He didn’t even have time to feel emotional. He immediately took off his outer coat and pants beside the car and quickly armed himself.

Carak carak!

Everyone tested their guns one last time and loaded the bullets. Then, under Xia ruofei’s lead, the small team moved forward in a search formation. They followed the path that Xia ruofei had taken just now and came to a position about 60 to 70 meters away from the abandoned brick factory.

Other than the three of them standing guard in different directions, everyone else formed a circle. Xia ruofei took out the map that he had drawn on the spot and said,””Comrades, this is what I’ve scouted out just now. The enemies are mainly distributed around the fourth brick kiln. There are three hidden posts on the periphery. There are two hidden sentries at the nineo’ clock position, one hundred and fifty meters, threeo’ clock position, and one hundred and sixty meters ...” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Following Xia ruofei’s explanation, the surprise on Guo Zhan’s face became more and more obvious. Xia ruofei’s information was more detailed than he had imagined. It was as if Xia ruofei had worn an invisibility cloak and walked around the entire area a few times. The enemy’s numbers, distribution, and equipment were all clearly stated.

However, he didn’t doubt the accuracy of this information at all. He had absolute trust in his comrades. It was the tradition of the lone wolf assault team that they could trust their comrades with their backs in a battle.

After Xia ruofei had reported all the information he had gathered to everyone, the experienced Guo Zhan quickly formed a battle plan in his mind.

He quickly began to assign tasks. Six agile members were responsible for dealing with the hidden sentries on the periphery. Since the hidden sentries could watch out for each other, everyone’s actions must be absolutely synchronized. This was not difficult for the experienced lone wolf members.

The rest of the people waited at the same spot. After the three hidden sentries were all killed, they would attack from the front. The six members from earlier would surround them from three sides and directly launch a strong attack on the brick kiln.

Xia ruofei had wanted to volunteer to take care of the sniper, but considering that it was more difficult to attack directly and that he had to do his best to protect professor Liang Qiming’s safety, he opened his mouth but did not say anything.

After Guo Zhan assigned the tasks, he asked,”Comrades, are you all clear on your own tasks?”

“Clear!” The team members replied in a low voice.

“Alright, let’s begin!” Guo Zhan said decisively.
