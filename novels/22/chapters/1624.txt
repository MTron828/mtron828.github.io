Chapter 1625: The bidding begins (1)

Xia ruofei turned around and looked at the slightly drunk song Rui. He smiled and asked,””They’re all drunk cats, what else can happen?”

“You went to my grandfather’s place yesterday, right?” asked song Rui. I heard that he even stayed at the old mansion for a night?”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”yeah!” What’s wrong?”

Song Rui’s eyes lit up and he said,””The old man must have given you a lot of good things, right? Everyone should have a share of the words of your fellow apprentices, so we can share them!”

Xia ruofei was speechless. What kind of person was this? Elder song was his own grandfather, and he didn’t dare to ask for it himself. Instead, he came here to seek help.

Zhao Yongjun laughed,”ruofei, song Rui is only this good!.”

“You guys don’t want a share?” Song Rui rolled his eyes and said,”my old man has a lot of stock ...”

Zhao Yongjun chuckled,”of course!” Why wouldn’t he? However, RUO Fei was such a loyal person, how could he eat it all for himself? That’s why we don’t have to say anything ...”

Xia ruofei forced a smile and said,”brother Zhao, you’re ...” Since you’ve already said it, I won’t be stingy with some ‘dry food’. Just wait!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

With that, Xia ruofei turned around and walked into his master bedroom. After a while, he came out with something.

He knew very well that song Rui and Zhao Yongjun were definitely not interested in those tonics and desserts. The only thing that they could lower their pride to ask for was nothing more than a special supply of cigarettes. This was something that money couldn’t buy, and in a sense, it was a symbol of status.

Xia ruofei walked to the courtyard and placed the special cigarettes on the stone table. He said,””Come and get it yourself! I don’t have any more than that ...”

When song Rui saw this, he immediately pounced on it like a cat that had smelled fish. However, he was too embarrassed to take more, so he grabbed one and held it in his hand.

Zhao Yong Jun, Xu Zi Xuan, Liu Jian, and the others didn’t stand on ceremony with Xia ruofei. They went up and grabbed one each, smiling and thanking him.

Only Wei Jun seemed to be unable to let go. He hesitated for a moment before saying,”Brother Xia, I don’t need it ... I don’t usually smoke!”

Before Xia ruofei could say anything, song Rui grabbed the remaining cigarette in his hand and said,””Little Wei, how can you take back something you’ve given away? Since you don’t want it, then just give it to me!”

Zhao Yongjun and the others were dumbfounded. Could you be any more shameless? At the same time, she regretted not being as fast as song Rui ...

Xia ruofei’s reaction wasn’t slow either. He directly snatched the cigarette from song Rui’s hand and stuffed it into Wei Jun’s arms. He said,””We agreed on one for each of you. If you don’t smoke, you can take it back to your father! Or it’ll be useful when you engage in social activities!”

Then, Xia ruofei looked at song Rui and said,””Young master Song, I despise you ...”

Song Rui rolled his eyes gloomily. However, he didn’t dare to talk back to Xia ruofei, who was two years younger than him. He just shrugged and didn’t say anything.

Wei Jun seemed a little uneasy. He did not dare to reject Xia ruofei’s gift, but he was also afraid that he would offend song Rui.

Zhao Yong Jun chuckled.”Wei, this is for you. Just keep it. We all have a share!”

“Then ... Thank you, brother Xia ...” Wei Jun said.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”you’re welcome!” I saw that everyone drank quite a bit at noon. Find your own room to sleep!”

Song Rui couldn’t help but look at Xia ruofei’s bedroom and said,””Ruofei, it looks like the lordmaster gave quite a lot, right? Why don’t you ...”

“Stop dreaming!” Xia ruofei said unhappily,”no matter how much the old man gives me, it’s still mine. Don’t push your luck ...”

“I was just saying!” Song Rui muttered,”look at how petty you are ...”

After that, song Rui strolled to the first courtyard to find a room to sleep in. Zhao Yongjun and the others didn’t treat themselves as outsiders. They greeted Xia ruofei and went to find their own rooms.

At night, no one went out to look for food. They let Wei Jun and Wu Qiang go out together and bought some food and wine. Then, they ate dinner together in the courtyard house.

Even though everyone was fully rejuvenated after an afternoon’s rest, they did not drink as much as they wanted that night as they had to participate in the bidding tomorrow. They shared a bottle of Drunken Eight Immortals and drank a few glasses before stopping.

At night, Zhao Yongjun and the others stayed over at Xia ruofei’s courtyard house. The next morning, after having breakfast at home, they drove out to participate in the bidding.

The Mercedes – Benz could not fit so many people, so Xia ruofei drove his Land Rover off – Road. Zhao Yongjun and song Rui got into his car as well. The two cars left the courtyard house one after another.

The bid for the land would be held in the hot spring resort in little Tang town, which was not far from the land.

On weekdays, Beijing Road could only be described with one word, and that was “congested.”

Although Xia ruofei and the rest had left early on purpose, the traffic was still so bad that they felt like they were going to die. It took them an hour and a half to reach the Imperial Hot Springs Resort in little Tang town.

Fortunately, today’s event started at ten in the morning, so they wouldn’t miss the bidding because of traffic.

The venue was set up in the second – Floor conference hall of the resort’s main building, and the car could drive directly to the parking lot downstairs.
