Chapter 1383: The older the ginger, the spicier it is (1)

Translator: 549690339

Tian Xiaojun walked to the living room dejectedly and sat opposite Tian shunliang.

Tian shunliang glanced at his disappointing son and said in a bad mood,””What are you doing? Aren’t you very good at causing trouble? This is so embarrassing that it’s thrown to the three mountains! Do I still have the face to go back in the future?”

“Dad! “I ...” Tian Xiaojun opened his mouth, but he stopped.

“Just say what you have to say!” “I don’t have the time to play riddles with you!” Tian shunliang snapped.

“Oh ...”

Tian Xiaojun lowered his head and recounted everything that had happened two days ago from the beginning to the end. He did not dare to hide any details and spilled everything out like beans from a bamboo tube.

When Tian shunliang heard Tian Xiaojun say that he had been forced to squat by the wall for half a night in the cold winter, he could not help but feel sorry for his son. However, when he saw Tian Xiaojun’s face, he could not help but snorted softly and said in a muffled voice,”He deserves it!”

“Tian Xiaojun, do you know where you went wrong?” Tian shunliang asked.

“I shouldn’t have set my eyes on the Paradise Corporation ...” Tian Xiaojun said with his head lowered.

“Dogshit!” Tian shunliang cursed,”your mistake is to stand out! He attacked rashly before he understood the situation! Do you think you’re the only one who’s well – informed? Why did others realize it later than you? Why are you the only one who rushed to the three mountains?”

“I understand ...” Tian Xiaojun said with a lowered head.

“You don’t know!” Tian shunliang said,”you must still be unconvinced! Do you think you’re unlucky this time?”

Tian Xiaojun did not say anything, but that was indeed what he was thinking in his heart. According to common sense, when he went to the three mountains the last time, he was almost certain that there would not be any accidents, but it just had to be this small.

Tian shunliang snorted coldly and said,”in coincidences, there’s bound to be something!” Did you do any research before making such an impulsive decision? Don’t say that you’ve checked on some business registration information, that information is useless!”

Tian Xiaojun opened his mouth to say something, but Tian shunliang had already said what he wanted to say, so he obediently closed his mouth.

“Do you think that you might not be able to find any useful information even if you do an investigation on the situation at paradise Corporation?” Tian shunliang asked.

No one knew his son better than his father. Tian shunliang understood his disappointing son quite well.

Tian Xiaojun nodded and said carefully,”Dad, this Xia ruofei is hiding too much ...”

“Nonsense! Then you’ve been blinded by money!” Tian shunliang said ruthlessly,”even if you can’t find out about his relationship with the song family and the Zhao family, can’t you find out about some of his Affairs in the three mountains? What’s the use of the connections I left in the southeast province? Since you decided to go to the three mountains to do this, why didn’t you ask for more detailed information in advance?”

Tian Xiaojun was instantly speechless. He had indeed been blinded by money, and he had no way of refuting Tian shunliang’s words.

Tian shunliang glanced at Tian Xiaojun with exasperation and continued,”After I heard about this today, I spent an hour on the phone in the afternoon and got some information. I’ll tell you ...”

Tian Xiaojun was not interested at all. What was the point of analyzing all these things now?

However, he didn’t dare to refute his father. He could only sit on the sofa obediently and listen attentively.

Tian shunliang said,”the owner of this paradise Corporation, Xia ruofei, has a close relationship with Tian Huilan’s family, the former Secretary of Sanshan city. Tian Huilan has personally come out to solve his problems many times. She even got rid of a Deputy Director of the county Public Security Bureau because of him!” “What’s more, after Tian Huilan was promoted, her successor, song Qiming, still looked at him in a different light. He even invited him to have dinner at home. Song Qiming’s daughter even introduced him to the children of many important department leaders in Sanshan city and the southeast province ...”

When Tian Xiaojun heard this, he was slightly shocked.

Liu Zhe had reminded him before that Song Wei had a good relationship with Xia ruofei. He knew about the last thing that Tian shunliang had said, but he did not take it seriously.

Now that he thought about it, it was not because Song Wei had a good relationship with Xia ruofei. It was because even song Qiming valued Xia ruofei very much. If he had known that this would happen, Tian Xiaojun would not have acted rashly.

Even if he looked down on local officials, song Qiming was a powerful Deputy Minister. He was already at the top of the pyramid structure of Huaxia. His influence was not limited to a small corner. He did not dare to provoke him.

Thinking of this, Tian Xiaojun could not help but feel a little regretful. If he had paid more attention to Liu Zhe’s warning and asked his father’s old subordinates and colleagues for more information, things would not have ended up like this.

Tian shunliang looked at Tian Xiaojun and continued,”You should be clear about Tian Huilan and song Qiming’s situation! From the information I’ve just told you, with a little analysis, we can basically deduce that Xia ruofei has a special relationship with the song family! This is the information that I’ve spent a very short time to find out. If I were you, I would definitely spend more energy gathering information before going to the three mountains, and then decide on the next step! But you didn’t do anything, and that’s even more disappointing than you causing trouble ...”

“Dad, I was wrong ...” Tian Xiaojun said with a remorseful expression.

Tian shunliang sighed and said,”little Jun, I’m getting on in my years. There’s almost no room for me to develop. It’s already a blessing to be able to settle the salary of a Deputy Department Director before retirement ... But you’re different. You’re still very young, and you’re already a Deputy Department Director. Your future is limitless! If you’re always so immature, how can I be at ease?”

“Dad, I’m sorry ... I’ll change in the future!” Tian Xiaojun said in a low voice.

At this moment, Tian Xiaojun’s mother, Zhou Shumei, came over with washed fruits and said,””Old Tian, you should speak less! Little Jun isn’t feeling good either!”

Tian shunliang glared at him and said,””You’re the one who spoiled little Jun!”

Zhou Shumei placed the fruit platter heavily on the coffee table and said,””What are you saying! Isn’t Xiao Jun your son? Don’t you understand that it’s the Father’s fault if the child isn’t born?”

Tian shunliang was rendered speechless. After a long while, he snapped,””I’m talking about serious business with my son! What are you doing? Is the meal ready? I’m about to starve to death!”

Zhou Shumei rolled her eyes and mumbled as she walked to the kitchen,””You only know how to teach this and that a lesson, can’t you speak properly ...”

Tian shunliang’s face turned red and white, but he could only pretend that he had not heard anything.

After Zhou Shumei returned to the kitchen, Tian shunliang continued,””Little Jun, after hearing what you said just now, is this matter considered over?”

“Mm! “As long as the one million Yuan is transferred to my account, I think Xia ruofei will not make things difficult for me anymore ...” Tian Xiaojun said.

Tian shunliang nodded.”You’ve saved yourself in time. A real man knows when to yield. This setback is nothing!”

“But Xia Ling and Zhong Zixin are both hesitating. They don’t really want the money ...” Tian Xiaojun could not help but say.

Tian shunliang snorted coldly and said,””I’ll call old Xia and old Zhong. The trouble was caused by the three of you, why should you bear it alone? Don’t worry, they won’t dare to go too far!”

Tian Xiaojun felt slightly relieved and said,”Thank you, dad!”

Although he had been reprimanded, it might not be a bad thing for his father to know about this. After all, father and son were connected. At least he had a strong support on his side.

“I’ll let your cousin know and ask him to donate another million Yuan to the Paradise Charity Foundation under the name of the company,”Tian shunliang continued.

“Ah?” Tian Xiaojun could not help but cry out,”why? Dad, there’s no need for this! Brother gang doesn’t have much money either ...”

Tian Xiaojun’s cousin, Tian Xiaogang, had opened a trading company. Under the care of Tian shunliang, he had some small achievements. However, the entire company’s assets were only about ten to twenty million Yuan, and this was also taking into account some fixed assets. If he were to donate one million Yuan all of a sudden, he might be a little short on cash flow.

“What do you know?!” Tian shunliang’s face darkened. Is this the time to be worried about money? Besides ... How could Xiao Gang not know how he earned this money? If I ask him to pay a million, would he dare to disobey?”

“No... Dad, I’m saying that we don’t have to give any more money. The three of us together, one million Yuan, is already a lot!” Tian Xiaojun said.

“Short – sighted!” Tian shunliang said mercilessly,”Xia ruofei’s condition was one million and you’re only giving one million?”

“This is free money! Who would take the initiative to give more?” Tian Xiaojun mumbled,”moreover, Zhao Yong Jun was the witness. They definitely wouldn’t go back on their word ...”

“Yes, if I don’t mess with you openly, one day, I’ll just give you a little obstacle. Where will you go to reason?” Tian shunliang said,”especially when you’re at the critical moment of promotion and being put in an important position. What would you do if he did that?” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“I don’t think so?” Tian Xiaojun said hesitantly.

“Such a possibility can not exist!” Tian shunliang said,”your future is the most important. Everything else is dispensable! Money can be earned again, but if your future is ruined, you’ll be like this for the rest of your life! Even if you can’t become friends with him, you should at least leave an impression that you’re tactful, have a proper attitude, and are sincere in admitting your mistakes. Only then can you completely eliminate the hidden danger!”

“Alright then ...” Tian Xiaojun nodded.

The older the ginger, the wiser it was. He was still confident in his father’s judgment. Besides, it was not his money. As long as the results were good for him, why would he go against his father?

“Also, you have to quickly gather the 300000 Yuan that you should pay!” Tian shunliang said,”I’ll use your salary and legitimate savings for this money. If it’s not enough, you can borrow some from a friend. In any case, you have to be clear about where you got it from!”

Tian Xiaojun was clear about this, so he replied without hesitation,”I know, dad. I was planning to do that too ...”

“En!” Tian shunliang nodded and said,”you’re not that stupid! However, I’ll have to change this habit of being impulsive in the future!”

“I will. Dad, just watch my performance!” This time, Tian Xiaojun was very obedient.

Tian shunliang rubbed his temples and said with a hint of fatigue,””Alright! This matter will end here. During this period of time, remember to keep a low profile and be honest. Don’t leave behind any excuses for others!”

Tian shunliang stood up and asked loudly,””My dear! The meal isn’t ready yet? Why are you so slow when you’re doing something? Hurry up!”
