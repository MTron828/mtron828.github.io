Chapter 56: Wager...1

Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat. Could it be that there was Jade hidden in this ordinary – looking raw stone, and the spirit painting could be sensed through the stone Skin? Other than this reason, there was no other possible answer! Moreover, according to the vibration of the spirit painting, the value of the Jade in this raw stone was very likely to be high! Fortunately, Xia ruofei had been in the Special Forces for many years and had developed a strong mentality. Although he was thinking quickly, he still looked calm on the surface. He put down the stone as if nothing had happened and started to look at the other raw stones. Very quickly, he had passed through every raw stone. Other than the previous one, the other raw stones did not cause the spirit painting scroll to tremble at all. In other words, out of the dozens of raw stones here, only one had Jade. The probability was so low that it made one’s hair stand on end! Xia ruofei sighed in his heart. He did not hesitate and picked up the volleyball – sized raw stone. Then, he said in a relaxed tone,””This one will do!” “Ah? Sir, are you not going to pick again?” The waiter was obviously stunned as well. Then, he tactfully reminded her,”this raw stone has been in our shop for more than half a year. Many experts have seen it. The probability of producing green may be ...” Xia ruofei smiled faintly and said,”do you think the chances will be higher if we change to another piece?” I’m just playing around anyway, so I’ll take this one! It’s more to my liking ...” The waiter was speechless. This raw stone was so ugly, but why did it have to be so pleasing to the eye? Rich people were really strange. However, on second thought, she felt that Xia ruofei’s words made sense. To put it bluntly, the raw stones that were used as gimmicks were all leftovers. It didn’t make a difference which one was chosen, so it was basically impossible to produce Jade. “Alright, I’ll register it for you now.” The waitress said. She quickly wrote down the number of the raw stone in her book and said,”Sir, this raw stone is yours now. Do you need me to untie it on the spot?” “Alright!” Xia ruofei shrugged his shoulders indifferently. The waiter went over to inform the manager and then brought Xia ruofei to a slightly smaller shop next door. This was also a property of spirit Jade house, but they only sold raw stones and naturally provided stone – cutting services. “Sir, these free raw stones were supposed to be cut for a fee, but you’re our big customer, so the manager said the fee is free.” The waiter said as he walked. “Thank you,” Xia ruofei said with a smile. When they arrived at the shop next door, the waiter spoke to a worker who was cutting the stones. The worker looked at the stone in Xia ruofei’s hand and asked indifferently,””How do you want to solve it?” Xia ruofei shrugged.”I don’t know anything about this. Let’s just cut it in the middle!” The stonecutter nodded and did not say anything. He took the raw stone from Xia ruofei’s hands and fixed it on the stonecutter. Then, he turned on the power and was ready to cut. If it were any other customer who wanted to cut the raw stone in this way, the master would have tried to persuade them. However, the master knew this raw stone too well. It was impossible for it to contain Jade, so he didn’t bother to say anything. There were a few customers in the shop who were Choosing Raw stones, and they all came over to watch the show. With the rumbling of the machine and the ear – piercing friction sound, the small raw stone was quickly cut in half. The master of cutting stones found some clean water to wash the cut surface. After taking a look, he said expressionlessly,””It’s ruined, there’s no green!” No Jade? How did this happen? Xia ruofei was slightly surprised. He walked forward and squatted down to check the raw stone that had been cut into two. Among the crowd, there was a middle – aged man with a big belly. He wore a thick gold necklace around his neck and had several big gold rings on his hand. He looked like a nouveau riche. There was also a delicate woman snuggling up to him. This woman was quite beautiful, but she had very heavy makeup on, making her look a little flirtatious. The fat man saw Xia ruofei’s shocked expression and couldn’t help but mock,””Hey! Brother, there’s no need to look! If it’s broken, then it’s broken. Your stone looks like this, it’d be strange if there’s green inside!” The flirtatious woman held the arm of the fat man tightly and said in a sweet voice,””Brother Cheng, I didn’t expect you to know how to look at raw stones. You’re really capable!” The fat rich man laughed proudly.”Baby, I don’t know anything about raw stones! But I’m rich! You can ask people who understand to look at it! The last time I invited teacher chi to be my stone gambling consultant, this stone was still on the shelf for sale! Teacher chi picked it up and took a look before putting it down! Haha...I heard that old Chen gave it to the shop next door as a gift!” The fat man’s boastful expression was obvious. The expressions of the spectators changed slightly when they heard this. Someone couldn’t help but ask,””Are you talking about teacher chi Tianming from the Jade Association?” Fatty was even more proud when he heard this and said,””Is there another teacher chi in the Jade industry of Sanshan city?” This Chi Tianming should be quite famous. After hearing this, the other people who were watching the show looked at the fat rich man in a different light. The flirtatious woman hugged the fat man’s arm even tighter and said coquettishly,””Brother Cheng, can you get teacher chi to help me pick a raw stone next time? I also want to play some stone gambling ...” The fat rich man laughed and patted the beautiful woman’s hand, saying,””Baby, if there’s a chance next time, I’m going to invite teacher chi to go stone gambling in southern Yunnan with me. I’ll take you to see the world then!” “Brother Cheng, you’re the best!” The beautiful woman said excitedly, and then directly kissed the fat man’s face in front of everyone. The fat man also enjoyed the feeling of being the focus of everyone’s attention, and his smug expression became more and more obvious. He looked at Xia ruofei and said with disdain,””It’s impossible to get Jade from this kind of rubbish stone. Everyone was still waiting to cut the stone! Quickly get out of the way! Don’t waste everyone’s time!” Xia ruofei had just finished checking the raw stone that had been split into two and had an idea of what was going on. He frowned when he heard the fat man’s words. The fat man kept making noise at the side. Xia ruofei didn’t want to pay attention to him at first, but his words were getting more and more unpleasant, which made Xia ruofei a little unhappy. He raised his head and looked coldly at the fat man, saying,””Since you’re so sure that my raw stone won’t have any Jade, do you dare to make a bet?” “A bet?” fatty was stunned and asked. What bet?” “Of course it’s to bet on whether my raw stone will have Jade!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Fatty burst into laughter as soon as he heard that. He pointed at the raw stone that had been cut in half on the ground and said,””You’ve already lost it, how are you going to bet?” Xia ruofei said indifferently,”didn’t I just cut it once?” We’ll only know if there’s Jade in there after all the stones are cut out, right? Just tell me if you dare to bet or not. “
