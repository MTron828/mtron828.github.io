Chapter 490: A tough battle and a narrow victory (1)

The other party was very fast!

This was the thought that came to both Xia ruofei and Heibao’s mind at the moment of acceleration.

The distance of five to six meters disappeared almost in an instant. In a flash, the two of them had already engaged in close combat!

The Black Panther struck first. It clenched its fist and attacked Xia ruofei with a whistling wind. Xia ruofei tilted his body to avoid the powerful punch. At the same time, his body quickly stood up like a spring. Without hesitation, he elbowed the Black Panther.

The crackling sounds were endless. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The two of them had already attacked each other two to three times in a second.

Block!

He dodged!

Each strike looked extremely dangerous, but each strike was blocked or dodged by the opponent.

The two of them separated as soon as they touched!

At that moment, Xia ruofei and Heibao had exchanged positions. Xia ruofei’s back was facing the black SUV, and his eyes were filled with caution.

His arm was still a little numb, and Heibao’s reaction speed was the fastest he had ever seen in his life. Now, Xia ruofei’s attack speed was far faster than before. He believed that even the best fighter in the Special Forces might not be able to handle the series of attacks just now.

What Xia ruofei did not know was that Heibao, who was opposite him, was also in a state of shock.

With his hands behind his back, Black Panther had the demeanor of a Grandmaster.

However, his hands, which were hidden behind his back, were trembling uncontrollably. He had just used these hands to block three of Xia ruofei’s attacks.

Xia ruofei’s speed made him a little fearful, but what made him even more fearful was Xia ruofei’s strength and explosive power.

The bones in both of Black Panther’s arms were still aching. He only had this kind of feeling when he sparred with his master that year. Ever since he entered the Liang family, he had never encountered such a powerful opponent.

Heibao’s eyes were slightly narrowed. Tonight was the first time he had spoken.

“May I ask who your master is?” asked Heibao.

From Black Panther’s point of view, an expert like Xia ruofei was definitely not an amateur like Zhao he. He was most likely like him, an “insider” with a master.

Facing such an opponent, Black Panther was extremely cautious.

Although the two had only fought for a short while, Heibao was not at a disadvantage. He was still very confident in defeating Xia ruofei. However, he was most afraid that if he beat the young one, he would attract the old one and even cause big trouble for his sect.

However, Xia ruofei did not appreciate it at all. He only said coldly,””Cut the crap! Today, you will die without a doubt!”

Ever since he saw Ling Qingxue being taken into the car at the company entrance, Xia ruofei had already wanted to kill her.

A Dragon had a reverse scale, and anyone who touched it would die.

Ling Qingxue was undoubtedly Xia ruofei’s weak spot.

Hearing Xia ruofei’s insolent words, Heibao’s expression changed and he showed a hint of anger.

He snorted coldly and said,”you don’t know the immensity of heaven and earth!” Since you’re in such a hurry, I’ll fulfill your wish!”

With that, Heibao’s aura exploded. He stomped his right foot heavily on the ground and shot towards Xia ruofei amidst the flying debris.

Xia ruofei’s eyes gleamed, and his muscles tensed up as he took the initiative to meet the attack.

By the time Heibao reached Xia ruofei, he had already lowered his center of gravity. His right leg was extremely fast, and with a sharp wind, it kicked towards Xia ruofei’s knee.

In fact, Black Panther’s most powerful skill was his legs, especially his attacks on the enemy’s lower three paths, which could be said to be fast and ruthless.

Xia ruofei’s heart trembled as he faced the powerful kick. He exerted strength in his legs and leaped backward, avoiding the Black Panther’s attack.

However, Black Panther had immersed himself in leg techniques for as long as twenty years, and the leg techniques he had practiced were known for their short, sharp, and extremely fast speed. Once he launched an attack, his attacks would inevitably be like the ocean tide, each wave higher than the previous, continuous and unending.

For a moment, Xia ruofei was surrounded by the shadows of the swift and fierce kicks. He blocked them from high above and blocked them from low below, but he was in a difficult position.

Heibao was also using his trump card – he had already underestimated Xia ruofei once and would not make the same mistake again.

Xia ruofei’s situation did not look good. There were a few times when he could not Dodge in time and was hit by the Black Panther’s leg on his ankle or lower leg. It looked like he was in danger.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei had taken so much body tempering soup that his muscles and bones were all strengthened. Otherwise, the Black Panther’s side kicks would have broken his leg bones.

Once that happened, Xia ruofei would really have to give up his life.

His current situation was not the worst. His leg bone only ached a little, but it did not affect his ability to move for the time being.

While Black Panther continued to launch Swift and fierce attacks, he muttered in his heart: Was this kid’s body made of iron? [He took three kicks from me, and he’s still fine ...]

The more Black Panther fought, the less confident he was.

Xia ruofei, on the other hand, had gradually gotten used to the Black Panther’s attack speed. He could even counterattack occasionally.

Xia ruofei’s counterattacks made Black Panther even more miserable because he always found the right timing. Every time, when Black Panther had used up all his energy and was still recovering, he would sharply detect an opening and attack decisively.

The Black Panther could only block in a sorry state.

After a few times, he felt that the bones in his arm were about to break. Xia ruofei’s strength was too shocking.

The more hei Bao fought, the less confident he was. On the other hand, Xia ruofei became more confident.

Once the momentum started to decrease, it was hard to gather it again. Under this situation, Xia ruofei’s attacks became more and more fierce.

Xia ruofei did not learn martial arts from a young age like Heibao, nor did he learn any traditional martial arts. However, the combat skills he learned in the Army were all lethal. He used his fists, palms, legs, kneecaps, elbows, and even his head. It could be said that he used everything he had, which caught Heibao off guard.

However, the Black Panther was indeed stronger than all the opponents Xia ruofei had faced before. Even though he was slowly gaining the upper hand, he still could not deal a fatal blow to the Black Panther.

While they were exchanging blows, Xia ruofei suddenly had an idea.

The second set of movements that the little golden man had demonstrated suddenly appeared in his mind.

Although it was just a stationary body – forging technique, it gave Xia ruofei inspiration.

He suddenly lowered his center of gravity, pushed his hands against the ground, twisted his waist, and used all his strength to kick his left leg from an incredible angle.

An average person’s body would not be able to reach this level of flexibility. However, for Xia ruofei, who had been practicing the second set of body – forging movements for a long time, it was easy.

The Black Panther was on Xia ruofei’s side, so his vision was blocked. He did not expect Xia ruofei to attack from this angle, so he was caught off guard.

In the blink of an eye, a rapidly enlarging foot appeared in Black Panther’s line of sight, and he only had time to subconsciously cross his arms to block.

However, Xia ruofei’s full – force attack was very powerful and the Black Panther had reacted hastily, so it could not block it at all.

With a cracking sound, the accumulated injuries on Black Panther’s arm from the previous exchange finally led to a qualitative change, and his bones were truly broken.

The huge force was transmitted to his chest through his arm, and he felt as if he had been hit by a truck. He staggered back five or six steps, and he could not help but spit out a mouthful of blood.

Xia ruofei didn’t hesitate at all after his first attack. When the Black Panther retreated, he had already closed in and landed a heavy right hook on the Black Panther’s face,

The Black Panther’s head suddenly tilted to the side, and it spat out a few bloody teeth.

And under the violent shock to his head, his entire person appeared to have a brief moment of dizziness.

It would be fatal to be dizzy at this moment.

Xia ruofei did not hesitate to deliver a series of heavy punches. The Black Panther’s arms drooped down as he took the hits. All the punches landed on the Black Panther’s chest and abdomen, causing great damage to it. The Black Panther fell to the ground like a broken sack.

Xia ruofei’s eyes were filled with cold murderous intent. He stepped forward and stomped on the ground.

With a terrifying cracking sound, the Black Panther’s four limbs were broken. The strongest opponent that Xia ruofei had ever met in his life was finally crippled.

Xia ruofei realized that he was exhausted after such a high – intensity battle. His underwear was already drenched in sweat.

Ever since he had obtained the painting, this was the first time Xia ruofei had been in such a difficult and dangerous fight.

However, he didn’t have time to stop and catch his breath. He immediately shot toward the black business car.

Monkey and the other two burly men in the car turned pale with fright.

After Heibao got out of the car, monkey had already turned off the engine. He never thought that Heibao would fail, much less that he would have to drive to escape with Heibao.

However, Heibao was suddenly defeated in the fierce battle. Xia ruofei rushed towards the car like a god of death. His monkey heart was about to jump out of his chest. He reached out to start the car in a hurry.

The distance of a few meters was only a breath’s time for Xia ruofei. Before monkey could start the car, Xia ruofei had already opened the door.

He did not hesitate to punch the monkey in the face.

Compared to the Black Panther, the monkey’s combat power was nothing. Under Xia ruofei’s full speed, the monkey did not even have time to turn his head subconsciously and was knocked out by a punch.

Xia ruofei then got out of the car and opened the door of the middle row.

The eyes of the two men in the car were filled with fear and despair, especially when they saw Xia ruofei’s bloodshot eyes, which were filled with murderous intent. They could not help but tremble. Ling Qingxue was clearly beside them, but they did not even have the courage to hold her hostage to threaten Xia ruofei.

The ferocity and fierceness that Xia ruofei and Heibao had displayed in their battle had already frightened the two men.

When Xia ruofei saw that Ling Qingxue was unconscious, he felt a little relieved, but at the same time, he was even more furious.

He forcefully suppressed his killing intent and first dragged the big man on his side out of the car. Then, he casually struck the big man’s neck with his palm. The big man groaned and fell unconscious to the ground.

Then, Xia ruofei carried Ling Qingxue in his arms and carefully exited the car.

Xia ruofei held Ling Qingxue with both hands and looked coldly at the only sober man in the car. He was trembling like a sieve and said,””You! Go and drag the driver down!”
