Xia ruofei said helplessly,”isn’t that so?” However, I’m not just doing this for the money. After all, I have so many comrades, brothers, friends, and employees. I can’t just quit just because I don’t want to. I have to consider everyone! Let’s not talk about this, I really need to go back as soon as possible. Let’s have a drink together next time!”

“Alright then!” Chen Xuan laughed bitterly. Since that’s the case, I won’t keep you…”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” I’ll go back and pack up, then I’ll leave. I’ve already said goodbye to sect leader Chen!”

“You can just tell my father. I’ll definitely send you off!” Chen Xuan said,”let’s go! I’ll go back with you to pack your things first.”

Xia ruofei could only nod his head and chat with Chen Xuan as they walked. Soon, they arrived at the courtyard where Chen Xuan was staying.

Actually, Xia ruofei had put all of his things back into the spirit map space after he was done with them. Although he had stayed here for a few days, he did not have many personal belongings and had finished packing in a few minutes.

Just as Xia ruofei was about to leave, there was a knock on the door.

“Come in!” Xia ruofei said in a clear voice.

The door to the courtyard was pushed open. It was Shen Hu and Lu You who had come to visit.

Sect Master Shen, Lu You, you haven’t gone back yet?” Xia ruofei smiled.

“We were also preparing to leave today. We heard that Mr. Xia was going back, so we came to relax!” Shen Hu said with a smile.

“Alright,” Chen Nanfeng said with a smile.”Since you’re so eager to go home, 1 won’t keep you.” However, if you have time in the future, come visit us more often. We will always welcome you!”

“Okay, thank you, Uncle Chen!” Xia ruofei said politely,”if there’s nothing else, Uncle Chen, then I’ll take my leave!” Also … I’ll bid you farewell here …” “Alright!” Chen Nanfeng smiled.

Xia ruofei bowed slightly to Chen Nanfeng, then stood up and left the main hall.

As soon as he stepped out, Chen Xuan came up to him.

“Brother RUO Fei!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”brother Chen, did you wait here just for me?” Is there anything I can help you with?”

“It’s nothing important. I’ve already finished my work, so 1 wanted you to stay here for a few more days. I’ve been so busy these few days that I didn’t have time to accompany you for a walk. This is neglecting our distinguished guest! I’ve been feeling bad about this!” Chen Xuan chuckled.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”brother Chen, you’ve already specially sent a Deacon – Level disciple to serve me. How can you call this a neglect?!” The heavenly sect’s hospitality is way too high! Since you’re here, I was going to look for you!”

“Brother ruofei, what’s the matter?” Chen Xuan asked.

“Nothing much, I just wanted to say goodbye to you. I should go back now that this matter is over. There are a lot of things to deal with!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Why are you in such a hurry to return?” Chen Xuan asked anxiously. I said I’d do my best as the host!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Xia ruofei spread his hands and said,”l have no choice. You know that I’m busy with worldly affairs. Unlike you all, I have to concentrate on cultivation. Not only do I have to cultivate, but I also have some matters of the secular world to attend to!” I’ve already reached my limit by coming out for a few days.”

Chen Xuan did not know whether to laugh or cry,”brother ruofei, even though the world of mortals trains one’s heart, you can’t possibly live like an ordinary person in the secular world! With your current cultivation, you’re one of the top figures in the world of cultivation. You have to change your attitude as soon as possible! Those companies, money… And such things don’t mean much to us.”

Xia ruofei said helplessly,”isn’t that so?” However, I’m not just doing this for the money. After all, I have so many comrades, brothers, friends, and employees.
