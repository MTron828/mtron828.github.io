2376 Surface of the water Part Zhao Yongjun had prepared this for Xia ruofei before he left the country the last time. It was for emergency contact.

The SIM card was anonymous, and even the phone was custom – made. Zhao Yongjun’s father, Zhao Cheng, was a senior leader in the military. The military had a large number of orders for custom – made secret phones every year, so it was not difficult for him to get one or two custom – made phones.

After the call was made, Zhao Yongjun picked up after a few rings.

There was a hint of worry in his voice.””Brother, did you encounter any trouble?”

This phone was prepared for emergency contact. If Xia ruofei had returned to China, he would not have used this number to contact him. Now that he was using this number, he was most likely still abroad and might have met with some trouble, which was why he was a little anxious.

Zhao Yongjun was cautious. Although this custom – made phone was much safer than ordinary phones, it was impossible to completely block all surveillance. After all, there was no absolute in technology. He also knew that Xia ruofei was using a fake identity to leave the country, so he didn’t call out his name.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Brother Zhao, don’t be nervous. It’s nothing ... It’s just that there’s a sudden situation that I’m not too sure about. I wanted to ask you.”

Zhao Yongjun let out a sigh of relief and smiled,””You scared me to death! Tell me, what’s the matter?”

“Brother Zhao,” Xia ruofei asked seriously,”I want to know ... Where has Liu haojun been sent to after he returned from the three mountains?”

It wasn’t a secret in the circle of rich men in the capital. Zhao Yongjun didn’t ask why Xia ruofei was asking about Liu haojun and said,””Him! After the incident in the southeast province, he didn’t even return to the capital. He was directly sent to the northern Shaan province and arranged to stay in a subsidiary of the Liu family enterprise in Chang ‘an city. ”

Xia ruofei was stunned and asked,””Brother Zhao, does that mean Liu haojun is in Chang ‘an?”

Zhao Yongjun smiled.”I heard that it’s not in Chang ‘an city, but in a very poor County below. Maybe it’s to make him reflect on himself!” Anyway, I’ve arranged a very basic position for him. I guess this kid will never have any hope of turning things around in his life!”

When Xia ruofei heard that it was in a County below Chang ‘an city, his eyes narrowed and he quickly asked,””Do you have a specific address and company name?”

Zhao Yongjun was taken aback.”You’re quite detailed ... But I’m not too sure. Who would care about this kind of thing?!” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Liu haojun’s incident had become a laughing stock in the circle, so Zhao Yongjun didn’t need to deliberately ask around to know the news on the surface, but Zhao Yongjun definitely wouldn’t know which County he was sent to, as well as the specific company name and address. He didn’t have the time to ask around.

However, since Xia ruofei asked, Zhao Yongjun naturally wouldn’t answer with an “I don’t know” so he immediately said,””It’s not difficult to get this information. If you want to know, I’ll call someone to ask!”

Xia ruofei said,”then I’ll have to trouble you!” And ... Brother Zhao, this matter is quite urgent, and this information is very important to me. Can you do it as soon as possible? I’ll keep this phone on and wait for your news. ”

“Don’t worry! When have I ever delayed your matters?” Zhao Yongjun smiled and said,”I’ll call you back in half an hour!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei was overjoyed.”Brother Zhao is the best! I’ll be waiting for your news then! I’m hanging up!”

After hanging up the phone, the smile on Xia ruofei’s face disappeared. His expression became cold and distant. Although he did not get any specific information, from the information he had so far, Liu haojun was the biggest suspect!

The small company that the Liu family controlled was located in Pingan County, one of the poorest counties in Chang ‘an city. It matched the information provided by Zhao Yongjun perfectly.

As for the client’s name “MR LU,” it was very likely that Liu haojun had filled it out casually. After all,”LU” and “LIU” only differed by one letter.

If Liu haojun was the one who did it, it was unlikely that he would let someone else do it. After all, the impact of the incident was too great. Even if the Liu family and the song family were not on good terms, if they knew about Liu haojun’s crazy actions, they would definitely stop him.

Maybe he didn’t write “LIU” but “LU” at that time, just to hide it from people. However, his methods were too low. He directly logged into the website of the modr organization from the company to place the order, and his IP was tracked. In addition, although the account that paid the deposit was overseas, it was not an anonymous account. This showed that Liu haojun’s awareness of anti – reconnaissance was quite weak.

Of course, all of this was under the premise that Liu haojun was the one who had instructed them to do so.

As for whether it was him or not, he would be able to confirm it after Zhao Yongjun got the information in ten minutes.

Xia ruofei didn’t wait for Zhao Yongjun to call back. Instead, he pulled open the drawer and took out an identical laptop.

The computer just now could only access the internal website of the modr organization and browse the internet, but it did not store any information.
