Translator: 549690339

Liu Qian deliberately paused for a moment, then quickly glanced at the cue card in her hand, and then said in an exaggerated tone,” 20 fifth – prize prizes, and it’s actually a 5000 Yuan kyokuboku mall E – Card! This was too big of a deal! I can’t wait for the grand prize, just let me win the fifth prize ...”

Liu Qian’s funny tone made everyone smile. At the same time, they were looking forward to the lucky draw even more. As Liu Qian said, the fifth prize was already very attractive. There was a whole 5000 Yuan E – Card, and there were 20 spots. The probability of winning was quite high. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The employees who didn’t win the lottery before were also starting to hope for their good luck. After all, they had only drawn 10 sixth – prize prizes, 40 3000 – Yuan sixth – prize E – cards, 20 5000 – Yuan fifth – Prize cards, and even more big prizes were waiting for them!

Liu Qian quickly asked the female employee surnamed Lu to draw 10 sixth – Prize Winners, but she did not announce it immediately. Instead, she put the vouchers on the tray and asked Luo Xing to draw five fifth – Prize Winners.

After the lucky draw, Liu Qian expressed her gratitude to the two of them and asked them to take their seats. Then, she began to announce the winners of the two awards.

This time, they did not keep him in suspense. After all, there were still many segments to the annual meeting. It was fine to adjust the atmosphere occasionally. Otherwise, the pace would be a little delayed.

Every time Liu Qian announced a number, the camera would give a close – up of the lottery ticket. Everyone could clearly see the number on the lottery ticket on the big screen.

Out of the 10 sixth prize winners, nine of them were won by the staff in the venue, and the five fifth prize winners were all won by the staff in the venue.

Xia ruofei was sitting at Table 1. He smiled at Feng Jing, who was beside him.”CEO Feng, it seems like the employees who didn’t make it here are not very lucky ...”

Feng Rao giggled,”the grand prize is coming!” I also hope that the staff who are on duty or working overtime today can win more prizes. They are really working too hard. ”

Xia ruofei nodded in agreement as he watched the employees go on stage to receive the prizes.

The E – cards for the two awards were specially made physical cards. After the card secret was removed, one could top – up any account in kyokuboku mall.

The LOGO of paradise Corporation was also printed on the card. E – cards with different amounts of money had the same pattern, but the color was different.

The cooperation between Taoyuan company and kyokuboku shopping mall was very close, so it was naturally easy to coordinate and customize a specialized E – Card.

The annual meeting continued.

In the third round of the lucky draw, he drew the 20th place sixth prize, which was an E – Card worth 3000 Yuan.

Similarly, as many as 17 employees won the prize, and only three employees who were not present won.

The pace of the annual meeting was very fast. Not only were snacks such as peanuts and melon seeds provided, but there were also steak, foie gras, and other Western food. Although the combination was a little strange, it ensured that no one would go hungry. After eating, they would crack melon seeds, peel oranges, and chat. This made the atmosphere better.

Every department had carefully prepared small programs, and the large departments with more employees had also prepared many programs.

Basically, there would be a round of lucky draws after a performance.

In the fourth round, the last ten sixth – Place prizes were drawn, and the fifth – Place prize was drawn.

After the next round of performances, the fourth prize was finally revealed.

“My dear colleagues, the fourth prize is the latest iPhone 8, and there are 15 winners in total!” Liu Qian said excitedly. If I had known earlier, I wouldn’t have prayed that I would hit the jackpot. I’ve wanted to change my phone for a long time!”

Everyone couldn’t help but laugh when they heard that. Liu Qian would always nag during every round of the lucky draw, and her prayers had really come true in the last round. She had won an E – Card worth 5000 Yuan.

In this round, the remaining 10 5000 – Yuan E – Card winners and 5 iPhone 8 winners were selected.

Just as Liu Qian was announcing the winning numbers, Xia ruofei heard a cry of surprise from behind.

“Argh! I ... I won the lottery?”

It was Lin Qiao’s voice. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but turn around and see Lin Qiao waving her hand with the lottery ticket in embarrassment. “I’m No. 169. I think I’ve won the iPhone 8!”

Luo Xing chuckled and said,”Lin Qiao is so lucky! Hurry up and go on stage to receive your award!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile. He didn’t expect this girl’s luck to be so good. 15 out of more than 300 people. The probability wasn’t too high, but she actually won.

Lin Qiao said with embarrassment,”This ... This isn’t very good! I’m just here to join in the fun. Besides, I’m not an employee of the company! It’s a little against the rules for me to win the prize ...”

“Who dares to say that you’re not an employee?” Luo Xing asked. You’ve done so much for the company during the summer and you’re only getting that little bit of internship allowance. It’s basically free work!”

The employees of the e – commerce Department also echoed and urged Lin Qiao to go on stage to receive the award.

Although these employees didn’t know that the e – commerce Department was going to form an independent business department, they usually worked together, so they all sat at one or two tables nearby. They were all colleagues who were familiar with Lin Qiao.

Xia ruofei also turned around and smiled.””Qiao’ er, don’t let the emcee wait too long. Go up and receive your award!”

Lin Qiao blushed and said,”Brother ruofei, I ... I have an iPhone! I don’t need it anymore. Why don’t we get them to draw another one ...”

“Yours is from the previous generation!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”the prize this time is the latest one. It’s much more powerful! Quickly go and receive your award!”
