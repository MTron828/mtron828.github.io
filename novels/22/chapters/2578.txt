2579 Home visit for follow – up visit (1)

Song Qiming’s respect for Xia ruofei was reflected in every detail.

For example, because of Xia ruofei’s visit, he had to postpone two of his plans in the afternoon. After attending an important meeting, he left the office in advance and returned home to wait.

Another example was that song Qiming personally called the gate guard of the compound and reported Xia ruofei’s car plate number. Such a small matter could have been done by the Secretary or even the driver, but he chose to do it himself.

Because of this, when Xia ruofei’s car arrived at the family compound, the armed police on guard only had to glance at the license plate and immediately signaled for them to let him through.

The bar was raised slowly. Xia ruofei’s car did not even stop. It only slowed down a little and entered the family compound.

This was not the first time Xia ruofei had come to song Qiming’s house, especially when song Qiming was recuperating at home after his injury. Hence, he did not need anyone to guide him. He drove to the building where song Qiming lived easily.

He carried the two boxes of nutritional supplements he had bought in Spain from his interspace on the way there. He walked through the grape trellis in the courtyard and went straight to song Qiming’s door. He rang the doorbell.

After a while, the door opened. Song Qiming stood there with a warm smile on his face and said,””RUO Fei is here! Hurry and come in!”

Xia ruofei was stunned and quickly said,””Uncle song, why did you personally open the door for me?”

For a leader like song Qiming, the housekeeping service staff, security guards, driver, and chef were all standard. This was the treatment that high – ranking officials should enjoy. No matter what, song Qiming did not have to open the door personally. He must have had an intention to do so.

“What’s there to be afraid of?”song Qiming laughed. You’re my Savior! Your aunt Fang always told me that my parents gave me life, and you, ruofei, gave me a Second Life!”

“You’re too serious ...” Xia ruofei said. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Fang Liyun’s voice came from behind song Qiming.””Old song, what are you doing at the door? Hurry up and invite RUO Fei in!”

Song Qiming laughed and said,”leader, I’ve criticized you!” RUO Fei, quickly come in!”

When Xia ruofei entered the house, he saw song Qiming personally bringing him a pair of slippers. He quickly stepped forward and bent down to take the slippers.”Uncle song, I’ll do it myself, I’ll do it myself ...”

Song Qiming’s courteous treatment made him feel a little uncomfortable, especially when he thought about what had happened between him and Song Wei. He felt even more guilty ...

After changing his shoes, Xia ruofei saw Fang Liyun standing at the side in an apron, smiling. He quickly greeted her,””Hello, aunt Fang!”

“Ruofei, you haven’t been home for a long time!” “Your uncle song and I always talk about you!” Fang Liyun said with a smile.

“I’ve been flying around the world recently. I was in Beijing before and opened a club with a few friends. ” Xia ruofei said,”then I went to Spain. Now ... I just returned to the three mountains, so I thought of coming to visit you guys and check on uncle song’s recovery!”

“Ruofei, you’re too kind.” Song Qiming said with a smile.

“Weiwei told me about the club you’re working at in the capital. She attended the opening ceremony when she went back to school last time. I heard that business is going well!”

“It’s alright. It’s mainly handled by a few of my friends in Beijing. ” Xia ruofei said,”I usually don’t care about such specific things.”

Song Qiming laughed and said,”ruofei, Speaking of which, this paradise gathering that you’ve set up is really not bad!” It’s not important whether you can make money or not, at least you’ll give some of the boys something to do. Many people are giving you thumbs – up!”

The ‘many people’ that song Qiming was referring to were the elders of Zhao Yongjun, Hou Liang, and the others. Of course, this included the elders of song Rui.

The meaning of the Paradise gathering had never been just about economic benefits, or rather, economic benefits were only a small part of it. The big shots were only interested in resources. Of course, there were also the younger generation who had nothing to do and caused trouble all day long. Now that they were finally doing serious business, they were naturally very comforted!

Xia ruofei smiled humbly.”It’s not my credit. It’s brother Zhao Yongjun and song Rui’s work.”

“That’s because you’re a team!” Song Qiming said with a smile.

Xia ruofei was a little embarrassed by song Qiming’s compliments. He quickly changed the topic.”By the way, these are the two boxes of nutritional supplements I bought in Spain. Consider it a little token of my appreciation!”

Song Qiming pretended to be angry and said,”why did you bring something with you when it’s my turn?” Aren’t you being too polite?”

“I’m a little embarrassed to come here empty – handed to freeload ...” Xia ruofei scratched his head and said with a smile,”besides, it’s not worth much!”

Actually, song Qiming was just putting on an act. However, Fang Liyun could not stand it anymore. She took the two boxes of nutritional supplements from Xia ruofei and rolled her eyes at song Qiming.”This is just a small gift from the child, you can just accept it! Why are you putting on airs at home? It’s not like ruofei is asking you for help!”

“Madam, I didn’t say I wouldn’t accept it ...” Song Qiming said with a bitter smile.

Fang Liyun glared at song Qiming, then put on a smile and said to Xia ruofei,””RUO Fei, ignore that old man! I’m used to being serious at work!”
