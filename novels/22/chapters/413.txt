Chapter 414: The devil (1)

Xia ruofei jumped out of the car and ran to the entrance of the bar without even locking the door.

As he pushed open the heavy door, a burst of noisy music could be heard. It was as if the entire earth was shaking. Xia ruofei frowned. His sharp eyes quickly scanned the room and then went straight to the bar counter.

Outside the bar, a few burly men scattered in twos and threes saw the murderous Xia ruofei rush in. They looked at each other and quickly gathered together, following him into the bar.

Xia ruofei rushed to the bar counter and knocked away a few drunkards on the way, causing a wave of curses. However, Xia ruofei did not care. When he reached the bar counter, he grabbed the collar of the bartender who had come forward to ask questions and asked,””Where is Lu You?”

The bartender was pulled by a huge force, and his body involuntarily leaned forward. He felt that he was almost out of breath. A trace of panic flashed through his eyes, and the figure of the beautiful girl who had just been drinking here appeared in his mind.

“Sir, you ... What did you say? “I don’t understand ...” The bartender stammered.

Xia ruofei said coldly,”a very beautiful girl. She was drinking here 20 minutes ago. Where is she now?”

The bartender forced a smile and said,”Sir, who ... Who are you talking about?” The ladies here are all very beautiful ...”

Xia ruofei snorted coldly. His left hand grabbed the bartender’s collar while his right hand took out his phone. He quickly found a photo of Lu You. It was taken at the flower exhibition a few days ago.

Xia ruofei put the phone in front of the bartender and said,””Look carefully. Don’t tell me you’ve never seen her before!”

The bartender recognized Lu You immediately, and his heart sank. As expected, the girl’s friend had come looking for him. However, when he thought of Fang Luo’s ruthless methods, the bartender did not dare to say anything even if he died. He quickly said,””Sir, I’ve really never seen this girl before. There are so many people in the bar, and I can’t possibly remember every customer’s face ...”

Xia ruofei had already caught the panic in the bartender’s eyes when he saw Lu You’s photo. He was even more certain that Lu You had really appeared in this bar and that something must have happened.

He was even more anxious. This had happened twenty minutes ago. For a girl, being held hostage for twenty minutes was enough for anything to happen.

At the thought of this, Xia ruofei exerted force and grabbed the bartender.

Just then, Xia ruofei squinted his eyes. Even though he did not turn around, he could already hear a strong gust of wind. Xia ruofei let go of the bartender and he rolled back to the bar counter. At the same time, Xia ruofei lowered his body and accurately dodged the punch that came from behind.

Xia ruofei didn’t even turn his head. He followed up with a side kick and accurately kicked the abdomen of a burly man behind him. The 180 – pound man was sent flying by Xia ruofei’s kick and smashed heavily on a table behind him, crushing it into pieces. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

There were also screams from the bar.

Xia ruofei turned around and saw five or six burly men surrounding him with fierce gazes. They were obviously the people who were in charge of the bar.

Xia ruofei did not hesitate. He clenched his fists and rushed forward. Every second was precious. He did not want to waste it on these people.

Under the bar’s lustrous lights, Xia ruofei’s figure was like a ghost. After he rushed into the middle of five or six burly men, a muffled sound of beating could be heard. No one saw Xia ruofei’s movements clearly. In at most five seconds, these men all fell to the ground and lost their fighting ability.

Xia ruofei turned around and saw that the bartender was nowhere to be seen.

However, he didn’t mind. These people who were watching the place definitely knew more.

Xia ruofei stepped on the face of the man closest to him and put the phone in front of him. He asked,””I’ll give you three seconds to think about it. Tell me where this girl is now. ”

The man gritted his teeth and glared at Xia ruofei. Then, he tried his best to look away.

Xia ruofei’s eyes flashed and he stomped down heavily. The burly man cried out in pain. His face was a bloody mess and his cheekbones and nose bridge were broken.

Soon, the burly man fainted from the pain. Xia ruofei’s face remained calm as he continued to walk towards the second burly man.

The burly man was scared out of his wits when he saw what had just happened. He tried his best to move back, but he had been hit in the abdomen by Xia ruofei and had basically lost his ability to move. Xia ruofei arrived in front of him in two steps. Just like before, she stepped on the burly man’s face and showed him the photo on her phone.

“Three seconds. Tell me where she is,” Xia ruofei said.

“I ... I don’t know ...”

Xia ruofei’s eyes flashed with a cruel light. Just as he was about to do the same thing, he suddenly felt a sense of danger. He turned slightly and saw a black shadow coming at him from the corner of his eye. Xia ruofei waved his hand to block it.

It was a bar stool, but its speed and strength were not bad. After Xia ruofei blocked it, he felt a slight pain in his arm. The bar stool was sent flying and hit a ball – shaped spotlight on the dance floor.
