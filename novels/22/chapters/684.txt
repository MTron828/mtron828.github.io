Chapter 685: The effects of one course of treatment (2)

Although Zhao Cheng had made it clear that he could still continue to perform his duties as the Chief of Staff of the military Region, and he had quickly taken leave with the excuse of recuperating, the news of his departure was still spreading like wildfire.

In the past few days, there had even been rumors that a general of a military group was going to take over Zhao Cheng’s position in the capital. The rumors were very real and did not seem like they were made up.

Zhao Cheng was anxious, but he could not rush Xia ruofei. He knew that Chinese medicine would take a long time to take effect. It would be useless even if he rushed Xia ruofei. He could only hold on.

In the evening, after Zhao Cheng had finished taking the Chinese medicine that Xia ruofei had just brewed, Xia ruofei appeared in front of Zhao Cheng.

“General Zhao, the first course of treatment is over,” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“It’s over?”Zhao Cheng was stunned.

He still couldn’t believe it. Based on his impression of Chinese medicine, it had only been six days and he had only drunk a dozen Chinese medicines. He had diabetes! It was not an ordinary cold or fever!

“General Zhao, you can go to the hospital for another check – up tomorrow morning.” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. I think the symptoms of diabetes should have been greatly improved. At least, you don’t need to use an insulin pump for the time being!”

Hearing this, Zhao Cheng was overjoyed. He asked excitedly,””Doctor Xia, is this true?”

This was too important to him! If he could get rid of the insulin pump, he believed that no one would be able to force him to quit his job. After all, he was still a powerful leader in the region, and he had the behemoth song family behind him!

It was fine if he wanted to be transferred to an idle position. He would first let those commanders and Deputy commanders of other military regions who had been suffering from diabetes for several years be an example!

If Xia ruofei had not said that the last dose of Chinese medicine would take a night to absorb, Zhao Cheng would have rushed to the military general Hospital for a checkup.

He managed to hold it in for the entire night. The next morning, without even having breakfast, he drove straight to the military general Hospital with Jin Feng.

......

Xia ruofei, who was full of confidence, did not follow them. He went back to his room and made himself a cup of tea. Then, he sat on the deck chair on the balcony and slowly enjoyed his tea.

Zhao Cheng’s test results came out very quickly. The group of experts and professors were shocked. It had only been a week, so how could the results be so different?

The last time he was checked, he had severe diabetes and had to be injected with Insulin for Life. Today’s test results still showed that his blood sugar was too high, but the degree was much less serious. He only needed to take medicine to control it.

There was a huge difference between the two.

Could it be that there was something wrong with the hospital’s testing equipment? The doctors, experts, and professors didn’t dare to tell Zhao Cheng the results so easily. They secretly informed the laboratory to use the same sample for another test. This time, they had to be careful and not let any problems occur.

The results of the second test came out very quickly. It was almost exactly the same as the first time!

The office was almost in an uproar. Everyone expressed their disbelief because this had completely subverted the medical theoretical system that they had formed over the years.

Zhao Cheng didn’t care how shocked these people were! He only wanted the results.

Seeing that there was no result after a long time, Zhao Cheng couldn’t help but shout,””Little Gao! Get the hell out here ... Why can’t we get any results after such a long examination? The efficiency of your hospital is getting lower and lower!”

Director Gao of the General Hospital quickly ran over with the examination report and said,””Congratulations, chief! Your diabetes has been treated very well, and all the indicators are closer to normal levels than the last examination ...”

“I only want to know one thing!” Zhao Cheng interrupted director Gao.”Do I still need to use an insulin pump?”

“No need! No need!” Director Gao had also heard the rumors that Zhao Cheng was going to be adjusted, so he quickly said,”chief, we just need to control it with drugs and at the same time, maintain good and healthy living habits! It won’t affect your work!”

“Put this in the report!” Zhao Cheng said.

This obviously unruly request made director Gao hesitate for a moment. But when Zhao Cheng glared at him, director Gao immediately agreed without any hesitation.

With this report, Zhao Cheng rushed to Building 81 and found the head of the headquarters who had spoken to him on behalf of the organization a few days ago. He placed the report on the head’s desk and sat down without a word.

The head of the headquarters was a little confused. He reached out to take the report and glanced at it. He couldn’t help but laugh. He pointed at Zhao Cheng and scolded,”Zhao dapao, Zhao dapao! Are you bored? After holding it in for a few days, you came up with such a report to fool people?”

Zhao Cheng immediately stood up and asked,””No... What do you mean, chief?”

“Who doesn’t know that you’re overbearing, chief of staff Zhao? The General Hospital of the military Region is under the leadership of your Beijing Military Region, so you can’t just open this report as you please. ”

Zhao Cheng exploded,”bureau chief, how can you not trust me?” Don’t you understand what kind of person I, Zhao dapao, am after so many years? Even if I were to be fired on the spot, do you think I would do such a trivial thing?”

The head of the headquarters pondered for a moment and said,””This doesn’t seem like Zhao Cheng’s style ...” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“It wasn’t originally!” Zhao Cheng said,”chief, I went through a week of traditional Chinese medicine treatment. All the indicators have been reduced, so I had to do another examination.”

“Traditional Chinese medicine treatment? Diabetes treatment?” The head of the headquarters felt like he was listening to a fantasy story.

“Chief, I didn’t believe it at the beginning either.” Zhao Cheng chuckled and said,”but the truth is right in front of us. This doctor’s medical skills are truly amazing! He said that he would help me get rid of the insulin pump within a week, and he did it in six days! He also said that as long as you insist on receiving treatment, it’s completely possible for you to be cured!”

“Which highly respected doctor is it?” The head of the headquarters couldn’t help but ask.

Zhao Cheng chuckled in embarrassment.”Chief, I’m sorry! He was also introduced by an elder. He’s an expert, and I promised him that I’d keep his identity a secret. ”

The head of the headquarters laughed heartily and said,””Alright then! Then I won’t ask anymore ...”

“Chief, since there’s nothing wrong with my body, then about my work ...” Zhao Cheng asked with a hint of anticipation.

“Continue with your work!” The head of the headquarters said,”but don’t hide your illness and avoid treatment like you did in the past. Otherwise, your body will have a big problem sooner or later!”

“Alright! Thank you, chief!” Zhao Cheng was overjoyed. He stood up, saluted, and said,”Sir, I’ll go back first. I’ll rest for another day or two at most, and then I’ll be back to work!”

The news was spreading like wildfire outside, saying that commander yang of a certain Army Group was going to take over his position as the Chief of Staff. Zhao Cheng couldn’t wait to return to his position.

I’ll let those who intentionally or unintentionally spread this news see that I, old Zhao, am still in this position! Not only that, but he would also become more and more comfortable in the future! Unless I get promoted or give up my position, no one can take my position away from me!

The head of the headquarters smiled and nodded. He knew his favorite general well and knew what Zhao Cheng was thinking.

After Zhao Cheng left the 81 building, he asked Jin Feng to drive him back to the high – ranking villa area in the military area.

Along the way, Zhao Cheng swept away all the bad luck he had in the past few days and appeared to be in high spirits.

He was already thinking about how to thank Xia ruofei so that he could show his sincerity.

Zhao Cheng did not know that Xia ruofei had already chosen the ‘thank you gift’ he wanted and was waiting for Zhao Cheng to return!
