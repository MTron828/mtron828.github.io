2418 Witness with your own eyes_“Do you even believe your own words?” Eccentric song smiled faintly and said,”you can restrict him for a while, but can you restrict him for a lifetime? Besides, even if we don’t talk about the song family, isn’t Liu haojun’s existence also a thorn in your side? This guy had already gone crazy! He was a time bomb! Who knows when your Liu family might be blown to pieces ...”

Elder song glanced at old man Liu coldly and said,””That’s all I have to say. As for what to do, it’s up to you, old Liu ...”

With that, elder song stood up and left the room.

At this moment, elder Liu recalled the conversation between the two of them, especially elder song’s last words. It was like a thunderclap that rang out, making elder Liu’s determination grow stronger.

Liu haojun had almost made a big mess of things this time. It was also obvious that he had lost his mind completely. He was in a state of madness. Even if he was sent abroad, it would not make people feel at ease.

Even if the Liu family restricted Liu haojun’s bank account and didn’t let him have too much money, it didn’t solve the root of the problem. As long as the madness in Liu haojun’s heart didn’t disappear, he would think of ways to get money and then put his crazy ideas into practice.

Moreover, the Liu family was a big tree that attracted the wind. Even if the Liu family was very United internally, and everything was done to protect Liu haojun’s life, it was impossible for them to withstand other people’s ideas. Especially when they were abroad, as long as someone paid Liu haojun a small sum of money, song Qiming could be attacked again. The target might even be song Zhengping and Master song’s son.

In this way, the song family and the Liu family might completely enter into an endless struggle to the death, and naturally, someone would be able to sit back and reap the benefits.

Old man Liu sighed in his heart,”old song was right, haojun ... Has really become a time bomb ...”

On one hand, it was for his own grandson, and on the other, it was for the benefit of the entire family.

Old man Liu had already weighed the pros and cons. He was just thinking back to elder song’s words to make his decision more firm.

He raised his head and looked at Liu Feng,””Xiao Feng, there are many things that you don’t understand. Of course, you don’t need to understand. Among your group, you are the one I trust the most and feel the most at ease! That’s why I’m giving you this mission. It’s a difficult decision to make, but I’ve already made up my mind. You don’t have to ask so much, and you don’t have to persuade me. Just do your job well ... And that’s all!”

“Understood!” Liu Feng gritted his teeth and said. Third great uncle ... Of course I will carry out your orders!”

“That’s good ...” Old man Liu said.”You should hurry up and fly over. I’ve already sent people to guard the peaks, but it’s hard to avoid a long delay. The result will be the same sooner or later. It’s better to end it quickly!”

“Yes!” Liu Feng said,”third great – uncle, I’ll book the earliest flight. We’ll leave immediately!”

“Go!” Old man Liu said,”by the way ... Don’t bring the ashes back. Just bury them in Shanbei!”

Liu Feng’s body couldn’t help but tremble. After a moment of silence, he slightly nodded and said,”Alright. Third great uncle, I’ll take my leave ...”

……

In the Toyota Elfa, Xia ruofei finally said,””Wu Qiang, let’s drive! Let’s go back ...”

Wu Qiang did not know why Xia ruofei had suddenly asked him to stop the car and rest for more than half an hour. Now that Xia ruofei had said that they would set off again, he did not ask much. He nodded, started the car, and continued to drive towards the courtyard house in liuhai Lane.

The car drove steadily. Xia ruofei pondered for a moment and took out his phone to check the ticket information.

The next flight to Chang ‘an city in Shabei province would be in two hours.

Without much hesitation, he logged into a new account and bought a ticket for this flight.

Then, Xia ruofei looked up and said,”Wuqiang, find a place to stop the car. I suddenly remembered that I have something to do. You can go home after I get off the car.” There’s no need to wait for me. ”

“Alright! Boss!” Wu Qiang said.

He found a place to Park his car. After Xia ruofei got out of the car, he waved at Wu Qiang, indicating for him to drive straight home.

Then, Xia ruofei found a public toilet nearby and changed into Xia Tian’s appearance. He then changed his clothes from head to toe and walked out of the toilet in a short while. In just a few minutes, he had transformed back into the elegant young man Xia Tian.

Xia ruofei hailed a taxi and headed straight to the airport.

He had decided to personally go to Chang ‘an city in Shabei province to take a look. Although old man Liu’s words were very clear, he still felt a little uneasy.

He wasn’t sure if there was any code in the conversation between old man Liu and Liu Feng. What if old man Liu used a code to communicate with Liu Feng out of careful consideration? what he meant was to kill Liu haojun, but in fact, he was helping Liu haojun escape. Wouldn’t that mean that Liu Feng had escaped from a disaster again?

Besides, missions were carried out by humans. Xia ruofei could clearly feel that Liu Feng was conflicted about this mission. He could also see that Liu Feng and Liu haojun seemed to have a good relationship.

In this case, they had to make sure that Liu Feng didn’t carry out old man Liu’s order determinedly. Instead of killing Liu haojun immediately after arriving in Chang ‘an city, Liu Feng tipped off Liu haojun so that he had time to escape.

All these possibilities existed. Xia ruofei really wanted to kill Liu haojun, so he decided to take the fastest flight to Shanbei. He would only let go of this matter when he saw Liu haojun’s soul pass away. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

After Xia ruofei arrived at the airport, he successfully changed his ticket and went through the security check. He went directly to the waiting chair near the boarding gate and sat down. He leaned against the back and closed his eyes, as if taking a nap.

In fact, his spiritual power had been constantly spreading around.

Sure enough, after a while, he saw Liu Feng dragging a small suitcase to the gate. There were three more flights to Chang ‘an today. One of the last two took off in the afternoon near evening, and the other took off at around 10 pm.

This flight was the fastest and most suitable time.

It seemed that Liu Feng had chosen this flight as well. This was not out of Xia ruofei’s expectations.

After a while, the announcement started to indicate boarding time.

In order not to attract attention, Xia ruofei had booked an economy class ticket. He did not deliberately approach Liu Feng, but waited in line at the back.

After everyone boarded the plane in an orderly manner, Xia ruofei and Liu Feng’s seats were quite far apart. However, his spiritual power could easily cover the entire cabin and monitor Liu Feng at all times. There was no problem at all.

The flight was smooth all the way and landed safely at around 12 noon.

Xia ruofei followed the crowd out of Xianyang International Airport. As soon as he stepped out of the airport Hall, he could not help but see Liu haojun!

At this moment, Liu haojun was talking to Liu Feng, who had walked out before Xia ruofei.

“Brother Feng, why did you suddenly come to Shanbei?” Liu haojun asked,”I couldn’t believe it when I received your call!”

Liu Feng looked at Liu haojun with a complicated expression, then smiled and said,””I just happened to be here on business! That’s why I thought of you, the host. If you didn’t come, I wouldn’t even have anyone to pick me up!”

Liu haojun laughed and said,””Brother Feng, I’ve been so idle these days that grass is about to grow! You’re just in time, don’t rush to go back, play with me for a few more days!”

“That’ll have to wait until work is done first. ” Liu Feng said,”you also know that I don’t have a choice most of the time.”

“Understood!” Liu haojun laughed as he spoke. He didn’t notice the hidden meaning behind Liu Feng’s words.
