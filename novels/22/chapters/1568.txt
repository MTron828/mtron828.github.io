Chapter 1569: The first experience of cultivation (2)

Translator: 549690339

Song Wei couldn’t help but feel a little excited and said,””It’s said that there’s good fortune after surviving a great disaster. I think my luck shouldn’t be too bad! I also want to buy two pieces to try ... By the way, why did you have to wait until the afternoon? Isn’t it better to go in the morning?”

“Yesterday, President Yu bought some Jade. He needs to deal with it first and transport it back. Otherwise, it’s not safe to leave it in the hotel.” Xia ruofei asked,”why are you in such a hurry? We still have something to do in the morning!”

“What’s up? What else do you have to do this morning?” Song Wei asked.

“To cultivate the” absolute beginning Heart Sutra “!” Xia ruofei said.

“Ah?” Song Wei was dumbfounded.”Isn’t the morning a little too short?”

Xia ruofei smiled mysteriously and said,”I have my own plans!” Let’s not talk about this for now. I’ll start cultivating after breakfast!”

After a while, the service staff pushed the dining cart to Xia ruofei’s room. At the same time, he brought a room card. This was personally arranged by Yu mingdong. The new room was right opposite Xia ruofei’s room.

The two of them finished their breakfast and the waiter left the room after cleaning up.

Xia ruofei went over to lock the door and lit up the ‘Do Not Disturb’ light. Business was more important, and he couldn’t care less about what Yu mingdong would think if he saw them in the room with a ‘Do Not Disturb’ light hanging on it in broad daylight.

The two of them sat opposite each other on the sofa in the living room. Song Wei asked nervously,””Ruofei, How do I cultivate?”

This was related to whether or not they could completely eliminate the peach blossom miasma. Moreover, even if there was no such meaning, Song Wei had once dreamed of being a heroine when she was young. Now that she could come into contact with the mysterious cultivation field, she was naturally nervous and excited.

Xia ruofei smiled.”There’s no hurry. I’ll make some arrangements first.”

In order to conceal the spirit map space, Xia ruofei went back to his bedroom and took out the array flag from the space. He held it in his hand and walked out.

He also took out two spiritual crystals and put them in his pocket.

Xia ruofei moved the coffee table to the side and pulled Song Wei to the middle of the room. He gestured for her to sit cross – legged on the carpet and Xia ruofei sat opposite her.

Then, Xia ruofei waved his hand and the array flags flew in different directions. They landed accurately in their respective positions and a time – accelerating array was set up in an instant.

Although it was not the first time he had used array flags, Xia ruofei was still impressed by this convenient method of setting up the array.

Song Wei did not feel the change in the flow of time. She looked at Xia ruofei blankly. She did not know why Xia ruofei had thrown the flags out. The amazing thing was that the flags were standing straight on the ground and would not fall down. It was like magic.

If he wanted to achieve something in a short period of time, he had to use the time formation. Hence, Xia ruofei did not plan to hide the time formation from Song Wei.

“Did you notice any changes?” he asked with a smile.

“Change? What kind of change?” Song Wei asked in confusion.

Xia ruofei pointed to the clock on the wall behind him and opposite song Wei.””Look at that clock ...”

Xia ruofei tried his best to compress the area of the time formation. This time formation only covered two people, so the time flow was about 90 times faster.

About one and a half minutes inside the formation was only one second outside.

So, Song Wei looked up and found that the second hand was still. She said subconsciously,””Eh? Is the clock broken?”

Xia ruofei was speechless. Just as he was about to explain the time formation, he suddenly saw a fly flying in not too far away from them.

This fly was definitely also flying around randomly, but because of the difference in the flow of time inside and outside the formation, from their point of view, the fly’s movements were extremely slow, as if it was frozen in the air.

Xia ruofei pointed his finger and said,””Look at that fly!”

Song Wei looked up and could not help but open her mouth slightly. This was the first time she had seen such a magical scene. Since when could flies hover?

“What ... What’s going on?” Song Wei asked.

Xia ruofei laughed,”can’t you tell?” There is a huge difference in the flow of time between where we are and the other parts of the room! That’s why the flies you saw seemed to be frozen. The wall clock wasn’t broken, but from your perspective, it would take more than a minute for the second hand to move one square!”

“Wow!” Song Wei could not help but exclaim,”there’s actually such a magical thing! RUO Fei, this must have something to do with the flags you just threw out, right?” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“You’ve finally guessed it!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”that’s right. These array flags can set up a time array. The area we are in now is 90 times slower than the outside world. In other words, three months here is only one day in the outside world!”

Xia ruofei paused for a moment before he continued,””Now you don’t think that one morning is not enough to do anything, do you?”

Song Wei was dumbfounded. After a while, she said, “There’s really such a magical formation ... RUO Fei, if you stay in the formation, Won’t You Be able to do a lot of things? For example, the third – year students have 90 times more revision time than others!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”If I didn’t need to save time, I wouldn’t have used the time formation so casually. You should know that the time you spent in the time formation was normal. If you used the time formation for a long time, wouldn’t you look much older than your peers when you go out?”

It had to be said that this was indeed the thing that girls were most afraid of. Song Wei could not help but stick out her tongue when she heard this.

Xia ruofei continued,”however, it doesn’t matter if I use it occasionally. This time, I need to cultivate it in a short time. That’s why I used the array flags!” Alright, let’s get back to the main topic! Let me explain to you about this “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” first!”

After Song Wei went to rest last night, Xia ruofei had been studying the “absolute beginning Scripture of the heart”. The information in the human – shaped jade talisman was directly passed into his mind, including a lot of cultivation experience. Hence, Xia ruofei only needed to read through it once, and it was much easier than learning a cultivation technique.

He first explained to Song Wei the key points of cultivating the “Scripture of the primogenitor”. The most important thing for this technique was for both of them to be in sync. Song Wei was quite lucky because Xia ruofei had already achieved a certain level of cultivation and had a thorough understanding of the “Scripture of the primogenitor”. With Xia ruofei’s guidance, it was much easier to get started.

Xia ruofei explained for a long time, but Song Wei still did not fully understand. He knew that the cultivation terms were too obscure for Song Wei.

Hence, he simply said,”how about this!” You might not be able to understand the theory of optics, so I’ll take you to run a full cycle first. You can feel the feeling. ”

The introductory section of the “Scripture of the primogenitor” required one to be able to sense Qi. However, with Xia ruofei around, he could let Song Wei experience the feeling of genuine Qi circulation first. It would be much easier to cultivate after that.

Song Wei followed Xia ruofei’s request and raised her hands. They sat cross – legged with their palms against each other.

“Don’t be nervous. Remember the circulation route of your genuine Qi later. I will explain it to you as I drive the genuine Qi.” Xia ruofei said gently.

Then, he released the true Qi in his palm. A small wisp of true Qi entered Song Wei’s body from Xia ruofei’s palm. It followed the first level of the “Scripture of the primordium” and advanced.

Song Wei had never cultivated before and her meridians were narrow. Xia ruofei carefully pushed his genuine Qi forward while explaining the names of the meridians and acupuncture points to Song Wei so that she could remember them as much as possible.

Soon, the genuine Qi had circulated through song Wei’s body. Xia ruofei did not continue with the circulation in his body. Instead, he retracted his genuine Qi.

“That was the true Qi circulation route of the first level of the cultivation technique. Try your best to remember it!” Xia ruofei said,”our first goal is to let you find the sense of Qi!”

Then, Xia ruofei took out the spiritual crystal from his pocket ...
