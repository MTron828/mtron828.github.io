Song Wei used her eyes to stop Ling Qingxue, who was on the verge of going berserk. She smiled and said,””RUO Fei, I think ... It’s more suitable for Qingxue to go with you.”

Xia ruofei looked at Ling Qingxue and then at Song Wei. He did not say anything. It was obvious that he did not want Ling Qingxue to take the risk with him.

“Even if the star Seizer sect’s disciples are selected through strict selection, you can’t trust them completely,” Song Wei continued.”In an environment like the moon, if you can’t trust them completely, it’ll be a bad thing. In addition, we also know that you must have some unknown means to protect yourself and the people around you. Unless it’s absolutely necessary, you must not use these means, right?”

Xia ruofei nodded. His biggest trump card was the spirit map space. He would not reveal the secret of the spirit map space unless it was the last resort.

Song Wei said,”everything on the moon is unknown. There might be all kinds of dangers in the mystic realm. If you have to resort to those methods, do you think it’s better for Qingxue to stay by your side or for a star Seizer sect disciple who you can’t completely trust to stay by your side?”

Xia ruofei fell into deep thought.

Song Wei’s words had indeed moved him. He asked himself honestly, if he was really in danger of losing his life without using the spirit map space, and if there was a star Seizer sect disciple by his side, he would really abandon the other party rather than risk exposing the secret of the spirit map space to save her. However, if he did that, his conscience would definitely be condemned, and his Dao heart might even be affected.

If the person beside him was Ling Qingxue, he would naturally not hesitate to save her first!

From this perspective, perhaps Ling Qingxue was more suitable to go to the moon with him.

Of course, in that kind of environment, the situation could change in an instant, and they could encounter unexpected situations at any time. If Ling Qingxue went with him, it would be very dangerous.

Song Wei didn’t want Xia ruofei to hesitate, so she said,””Don’t think too much about it. Qingxue is a ready – made candidate who meets the conditions, and she’s one of us. Why do you have to go to the star Seizer sect to look for her?”

Ling Qingxue was also looking at Xia ruofei murderously. Although she didn’t say anything, she looked like she would pounce on Xia ruofei and scratch his face if he refused again ...

Moreover, Song Wei’s analysis was very objective and reasonable.

After some internal struggle, Xia ruofei finally nodded helplessly and said,””Alright! Then bring Qingxue along ...”

When Ling Qingxue heard this, the murderous look on her face disappeared instantly and was replaced by a happy expression. She smiled like a flower and said sweetly to Xia ruofei,””RUO Fei, thank you! I knew you’re the best ...”

Xia ruofei felt goosebumps all over his body from her sweet words. He shivered and said,””Speak properly!”

Ling Qingxue and Song Wei both laughed out loud. The two of them clapped back in celebration. They had probably discussed this beforehand. Now that their “evil plan” had succeeded, the two of them were naturally quite happy.

Xia ruofei continued,”Qingxue, you can come with me. However, you must listen to my orders throughout the entire journey. You are not allowed to act on your own!” If such a situation really happens, I will immediately imprison you until you return to Earth!”

Xia ruofei himself was not sure what kind of situation he would face on this trip. Now that he had to bring Ling Qingxue along, he was naturally under more pressure. That was why he was afraid that Ling Qingxue would not listen to his orders and fall into a dangerous situation.

Ling Qingxue stuck out her tongue and said,””I know! Don’t worry! I’ll be good ...”

As long as she could go on an adventure with Xia ruofei, she would do whatever Xia ruofei said.

Song Wei revealed an envious expression and said,”I also want to go with you guys! It’s a pity that I failed to live up to expectations and couldn’t pass the music selection ...”

“Actually, going to the moon might not be a good thing,” Xia ruofei consoled.”It’s still very dangerous. Also, Wei Wei has a mission to accomplish on earth. ”

“What mission?” Song Wei quickly asked.

“The distance between Earth and the Moon isn’t too far, so there won’t be much delay in real – time communication.” Xia ruofei said,”so, I might set up a communication system between the sky and the earth. Wei Wei will be in charge of the ground. On one hand, she can keep track of everyone’s situation. On the other hand ... If anything happens, she can leave behind information for future generations to refer to. I’m sure the other three sects will support you!”

For the first heaven sect, the surging waves sect, and the soaring Flower Valley, even if this group of people who went to explore was completely annihilated, they would not stop their exploration. In the future, they would definitely let more people receive the selection and form a new exploration team to go to the moon. In this way, some real – time information of the first team could be transmitted back and recorded, which would have great reference value.

“Don’t say such disheartening words!”Song Wei’s eyes reddened. You guys will be fine!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it’s better to be safe than sorry!” Moreover, there are many benefits to being able to communicate with the world in real time. ”

“Yes, yes!” Song Wei nodded and said,”I’m willing to do that. After all, I’ll feel more at ease if I can keep in touch with you guys ...”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”it’s late. Let’s rest first.” There are still many things to do starting tomorrow!”

……

The next day, Xia ruofei told Chen Nanfeng and the others about his decision to bring Ling Qingxue to the moon.

Naturally, no one had any objections.

Xia ruofei already had two spots, and with the one given to him by the first heaven society, it was reasonable for him to bring two people. They couldn’t say anything, not to mention that Xia ruofei only used one of the spots.

Xia ruofei continued,”I’ll make some arrangements for the spacesuits. Also ... We can start the initial test today to see if the spacecraft can adapt to the outer space environment. However, for safety reasons, we need to do it step by step. Also ... Before we get the spacesuits, it’s best not to really ascend into outer space.”

Chen Nanfeng and the others all agreed.

At this moment, the voice of master Yuntai rang in Xia ruofei’s mind.

“Little brat Xia! What kind of supercomputer are you using to calculate these words? they’re useless!” Scholar Yuntai said,”I’m dizzy from reading 1000 chapters. It’s useless!”

Xia ruofei then remembered that he had given a laptop with the first calculation results of a super computer to scholar Yuntai for research.

In other words, by treating each floating point as a Chinese character, the 1000 writings that had the highest possibility of being simulated would be calculated.

Xia ruofei asked Xia Qing to cooperate with scholar Yuntai to operate the computer, and then he didn’t care about this matter.

Later, he changed to a numerical scheme, and then Song Wei found a clue by accident. He was busy arranging music again. He had been so busy these days that he completely forgot that master Yuntai was still studying those meaningless man groups.

After hearing what scholar Yuntai had said, Xia ruofei quickly greeted Chen Nanfeng and the others, saying that he would go into the room to solve the spacesuits problem, and then hurried back to his room.

Xia ruofei said to master Yuntai,”senior Yuntai, Didn’t I tell you that day?” This proposal has already been rejected and those words are meaningless. Did you really read them for a few days?”

Scholar Yuntai snorted,””If I don’t read it myself, how can I be sure that there’s no mystery in the words?”

“So you’re done now? What was the result?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

Scholar Yuntai said in a depressed tone,””I’ve finished reading it. There’s indeed nothing mysterious about it!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh and continued,””Senior Yuntai, in fact, we’ve made a breakthrough in cracking the token these days and obtained very crucial information. I just happen to have something to ask you!”
