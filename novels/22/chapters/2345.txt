Liu Qunfeng’s movements were fast, or rather, he was very sensitive.

Xia ruofei had only mentioned it casually over the phone, but he immediately realized that there might be some problems with the handover of the pharmaceutical Group.

On the night Xia ruofei returned to the capital, he received a call from Dong Yun. The small problems that he had encountered previously were easily solved.

The attitude of those who were not very cooperative in many things and refused to cooperate with him had taken a 180 – degree turn.

Furthermore, Xia ruofei had heard from Dong Yun that Liu’s group in the capital had sent a team of executives over and fired several of the pharmaceutical groups ‘management on the spot. Then, someone from Liu’s group had temporarily taken over their work.

In this way, the handover of the work was much smoother.

Xia ruofei knew that Liu Qunfeng was trying to get on his good side.

Over the phone, he encouraged Dong Yun to keep up the good work and complete the handover smoothly in one go, laying a solid foundation for the next step of the peach blossom company’s expansion.

The next day.

Xia ruofei only called Liu Qunfeng in the evening.

Liu Qunfeng had been restless the entire day. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

He understood that there had been many problems with the handover of the pharmaceutical Group, and they were all created by Liu Lifang and a group of people. According to Liu Lifang, they were deliberately delaying Wanwan. Why could Xia ruofei leave the old man behind and go back to the three mountains after he had treated half of the patient? Since the treatment wasn’t completed, don’t even think about getting the pharmaceutical company smoothly!

Even if the transfer of shares had been completed, such a huge and complicated asset transfer, if the Liu’s group did not cooperate or deliberately made things difficult, the transfer work might be delayed indefinitely.

After Liu Qunfeng heard Liu Lifang’s “plain” idea, he almost went crazy.

His sister had been pampered since she was young. It could be said that she had not learned anything about how to deal with people. To put it simply, she was a fool. In addition, she was the eldest daughter of the corporation. Those people in the family had also gone along with her nonsense, which led to the passive situation today.

Liu Qunfeng had been too careless with Xia ruofei’s matter. He thought that Xia ruofei had gone to the three mountains and that the treatment here was mainly about taking medicine, so he did not pay much attention to the things here.

He didn’t expect his good sister to almost Pierce the sky.

Liu Qunfeng made a prompt decision and sent a trusted senior executive from his family group to the pharmaceutical Group to deal with the matter.

The management of the pharmaceutical Group that had caused the most trouble had actually done so under Liu Lifang’s instructions. This time, they had died a little unjustly and were directly treated as the rafters who stood out and took the blame for Liu Lifang.

Back in Beijing, Liu Qunfeng didn’t care about Liu Lifang’s crying. He stopped her work and told her to reflect on her actions at home.

Although Liu Qunfeng didn’t work in the family group, he was the eldest son of elder Liu. Among the second – generation children, he was the best in the political field. He basically had the final say in the family, especially since elder Liu was recovering from his illness. Most of the power of the family had been handed over to Liu Qunfeng, so he could naturally make the decision with one word.

After dealing with all these things, Liu Qunfeng reported to his father.

Elder Liu was silent for a long time, then sighed and said,””What a misfortune for her family ... It’s all my fault for spoiling her too much in the past!”

“Dad!” Liu Qunfeng said. As the eldest brother, I also have a responsibility. In the past, Lifang was a little domineering, but I didn’t pay much attention to it. I thought that it was nothing for a daughter of the Liu family to be a little high – Profile. However, now ...”

“Now that my body isn’t doing well, Li Fang and the others still don’t know what’s good for them!” Elder Liu said coldly,”that’s enough. You’ve handled this matter well. Let’s leave it at that for now!”

“Yes, father!” Liu Qunfeng continued,”then, about Xia ruofei ... Should I ...”

“You don’t have to call him, and you don’t have to take the initiative to talk about these things.” Elder Liu said indifferently,”this young man is not simple. There are some things that we can only do and not say, or else it will have the opposite effect.”

“I know, dad!” Liu Qunfeng said,”but what if he doesn’t take the initiative to contact me? The medicine you have here ...”

“He won’t keep pretending.” Mr. Liu said confidently,”although Xiao Xia is decisive in killing and doesn’t hold back in extorting, he is still a very particular person. There are many things that he doesn’t say, but he knows in his heart!”

Hearing his father’s words, Liu Qunfeng could only helplessly say,””Alright then ...”

And so, Liu Qunfeng waited for an entire day.

When he received Xia ruofei’s call in the evening, Liu Qunfeng couldn’t wait to answer.””Mr. Xia, how are you?”

“Hello, chief Liu,” Xia ruofei said lightly. I’d like to visit elder Liu tomorrow. I wonder if he’s free?”

Liu Qunfeng quickly replied,”it’s convenient!” It was convenient! Mr. Xia can go over at any time!”

He wished that Xia ruofei could just stay at old master Liu’s place tonight. Now that old master Liu was waiting for Xia ruofei to provide him with life – saving medicine, how could it be inconvenient?

Xia ruofei smiled.”That’s good. I’ll go and visit him tomorrow morning.”

“Alright! Alright!” Liu Qunfeng said excitedly,”Mr. Xia, when would you be free? I’ll send a car over to pick you up!”

He had even unconsciously used honorifics.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”there’s no need to pick me up. I know the place.” Tomorrow at around 90 O’ clock! I’ll go there myself. ”

“Alright!” “I’ll see you tomorrow, Mr. Xia!” Liu Qunfeng said.

……

The next day, Xia ruofei woke up and cultivated for a while. After breakfast, he took a shower unhurriedly. Then, he got into the Toyota Elfa driven by Wu Qiang and drove towards the small building in the southern suburbs of the capital where old man Liu lived.

Liu Qunfeng did not go to work today. He had been waiting for Xia ruofei at the three – story building in the southern suburbs.

He saw Xia ruofei’s car from afar and ordered the guards at the entrance to let them in.

The car stopped in the yard. The electric door was only half open when Liu Qunfeng walked up to them.

For a Deputy – Level leader, such a gesture in front of a young man in his twenties was obviously quite humble.

“Mr. Xia, you’ve worked hard! It’s been hard on you!” Liu Qunfeng greeted Xia ruofei warmly.

Xia ruofei’s expression was still calm, like a master who did not like material things.

“I don’t deserve to be welcomed by you personally, chief Liu!” He said with a smile.

“No, no, no!” “Mr. Xia is my father’s Savior,” Liu Qunfeng said humbly.”No matter how much courtesy you receive, you deserve it!”

“I can’t be considered a Savior!” Xia ruofei said,”elder Liu’s illness is quite tricky. Although I managed to control his condition by accident, no one can guarantee that he will be fine with this illness.”

“Of course!” Liu Qunfeng laughed dryly. That was! For Mr. Xia to be able to control the illness, his medical skills are already superb. ”

“Let’s go and see elder Liu first!” Xia ruofei said.

“Alright, this way please, Mr. Xia!” Liu Qunfeng said.

He personally led Xia ruofei to old master Liu’s room on the second floor.

The old man seemed to be in good spirits. His face was still thin, but his complexion was different.

The first time Xia ruofei met old master Liu, his face was full of defeat. It was obvious that he did not have much time.

And this time, it was obviously a little more alive.

“Little Xia!” Old master Liu reclined on the bed and greeted Xia ruofei with a smile.

“Hello, elder Liu!” Xia ruofei said with a trace of respect.

Excluding the differences in their positions and the disputes with the Liu family, Xia ruofei respected this old man who had come from the war era and participated in the creation of the Republic.

Moreover, from Xia ruofei’s previous contact with him, he could tell that old master Liu was very wise and not as sinister as he had imagined, let alone the descendants of the Liu family.

“Did everything go smoothly on your return to the three mountains?” Old man Liu asked with a smile.

“Thanks to you, I’ve finally lived up to my orders!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Song Qiming’s matter could be controlled through public opinion on the internet, and people who knew about it could be silenced, but it could not be hidden from the big families in Beijing.

Xia ruofei knew that the Liu family had probably found out about song Qiming’s escape from danger.

“That’s because your medical skills are superb and you can do what others can ‘t!” Old man Liu said with a smile.

To be honest, the old man had really understood song Qiming’s situation in detail. He had even listened to the opinions of medical experts.

The conclusion that elder Liu had obtained from the experts was that, based on song Qiming’s condition at that time, there was a 90% chance that he would not be able to last more than five hours before his brain died. The possibility of him being saved or even out of danger was almost zero.

Therefore, it could only be explained by the magic of Chinese medicine.

With such a conclusion, old master Liu looked forward to Xia ruofei’s medical skills even more.

He knew very well that Xia ruofei was not only a life – saving straw to him. To be exact, Xia ruofei was a life – saving log or even a lifeboat.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you’re too kind!” Old man, let me give you a checkup first! Let’s see how he’s doing during this period of recovery!”

“Alright!” Elder Liu chuckled and said,”Xiao Xia, when you weren’t in Beijing, my heart was in a mess. Now that I’ve seen you, I feel at ease!”

“The reason why I’m able to go back at ease is because I’m confident.” Xia ruofei said,”you should believe in the doctor!”

“Hahaha! Yes, yes, yes!” Old man Liu said with a smile.

Xia ruofei came to the bedside and sat down. Then he said,””Elder Liu, please extend your left hand!”
