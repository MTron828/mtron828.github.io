2043 A windfall (2)

“The Hong sect?” Xia ruofei immediately raised his voice.”Adopted husband, tell me clearly. What’s going on?” Why did the Hong sect transfer money to me? and it’s 270 million euros!”

“Yes,” Li Yifu quickly said,”great uncle, it’s like this ... A few days ago, when we were dealing with the Geerman family, didn’t you find a treasure room in the manor? This amount of money ...”

“Don’t tell me that this money was exchanged for that batch of gold coins and jewelry?” Xia ruofei said.

“And almost 100 million euros in cash!” He said. Li Yifu quickly added,”the remaining 170 million Yuan is almost the valuation of the jewelry.”

“Isn’t this just playing the zither randomly?” Xia ruofei frowned and said,”I’ve already said that the wealth will be left for the Italy Freemasons as funds! Because of me, many of our brothers died that day!”

Li Yifu hurriedly explained,”please forgive me, senior granduncle!” I’ve asked around, the reason why the Geerman family was wiped out that day was all because of my grand uncle’s power. The Hong sect has already gotten a huge piece of land for free! Besides, you were the one who discovered the treasure room, so ah hai and the others definitely wouldn’t dare to take the money!”

Without waiting for Xia ruofei to speak, Li Yifu continued,””Senior granduncle, the Hong sect has a comprehensive compensation system. We will compensate our brothers who died that night and those who are disabled! Don’t worry about this! Besides, ah hai and zhengfeng won’t be leaving empty – handed after attacking the Gelman family. There are many valuable things in the manor, and they’ve already gotten a big bargain. We can’t take this money anymore!”

“I said I’d give it to them, so why wouldn’t they dare to take it?” Xia ruofei said,”this ah hai is too much. He has to ask for instructions for everything. He doesn’t have any courage at all!”

“Yes, yes, yes!” Li Yifu quickly chimed in and said,”grand uncle – Master, please understand our difficulties. It’s not easy for us to deal with the wealth. Furthermore, it was the decision of the higher – ups of the Hong sect to convert all the jewelry and gold to cash, please accept it!”

Xia ruofei shook his head helplessly and said,””Alright, alright! Since you’re already here, I’ll keep it!”

He also knew that an overseas organization like the Hong sect with a long history had accumulated a shocking amount of wealth over the years. It was even comparable to those giant enterprises that were worth tens of billions.

In fact, the rich list had never reflected the true wealth ranking. There were many hidden rich people or low – Key organizations in the world, and the wealth they controlled was even more than the world’s richest people on the surface.

To the Hong sect, 200 to 300 million euros was nothing.

Since the Hong sect was so sincere, Xia ruofei would not reject them. Moreover, from Li Yifu’s point of view, Xia ruofei had a deep relationship with the Hong sect. When the time was right in the future, he would just help the Hong sect.

After Xia ruofei relented, Li Yifu heaved a sigh of relief and said,””Thank you, martial granduncle! Thank you, senior granduncle!”

Those who didn’t know better would think that Xia ruofei had transferred 270 million euros to the Hong sect. Why would Jian Jia thank the person who gave the money, but the person who accepted the money looked like he was forced to do so?

“By the way, why were you looking for me just now?” Xia ruofei asked.

Li Yifu said, somewhat embarrassed,””Senior granduncle, this disciple originally wanted to report to you about this sum of money, but it’s fine now ...”

Xia ruofei said,”okay, let’s do this first!” By the way, is there anything you don’t understand about cultivation?”

“Thank you for your concern, senior granduncle!” Li Yifu was somewhat flattered.”I’m still digesting the content that senior granduncle taught me last time. There’s no problem for now!”

“Alright! If there’s anything you don’t understand, don’t practice blindly. You can come and ask me at any time!” Xia ruofei said.

“Yes! I understand!” Li Yifu said gratefully.

After hanging up, Xia ruofei threw his phone on the bedside table. Then, he leaned against the headboard, put his hands behind his head, and stared at the ceiling in a daze.

He had thought that there was a strange story behind this huge sum of money! He didn’t expect that it would be so simple after the mystery was revealed.

In fact, Xia ruofei should have thought about the wealth that he had taken out from the Golman family’s treasure vault long ago. However, he did not take it to heart, especially after he found more than half of the box of world stones. He focused almost all of his attention on the world stones.

He didn’t expect that after so many twists and turns, the wealth would still end up in his pocket.

270 million euros was equivalent to two to three billion Chinese dollars, which was more than the current assets of the Paradise Corporation.

It had only been one night, and they had already gained so much from taking down a small Mafia family. If they were to take down all the Italy Mafia, how much money would they get?

Xia ruofei did not become greedy because of this. On the contrary, he became more alert.

After having absolute power, it could be said that it was easy to obtain wealth. And it was precisely because it was too easy that many people would inevitably lose their way and walk the evil path.

The great Dao Sutra was a cultivation technique that was filled with righteousness. If Xia ruofei’s Dao heart was really covered in dust because of worldly wealth, then his cultivation would definitely be affected. In serious cases, he might even suffer a backlash, similar to the Qi deviation in martial arts.

Xia ruofei silently recited the “great Dao technique” a few times and gradually calmed down.

Then, he gave Song Wei a call and told her that he was in Beijing today.

Ever since the two of them had that special cultivation experience, Song Wei had left an indelible mark in the depths of Xia ruofei’s heart. He could not tell if his feelings for Song Wei were deeper than his feelings for Ling Qingxue. However, he could be sure that since they had parted in the capital, his longing for Song Wei had deepened.

Xia ruofei thought that he would be able to see Song Wei today. To his surprise, Song Wei had gone to Guanzhong province with her mentor two days ago. He heard that a Tang Dynasty tomb had been destroyed by grave robbers and they needed to go there to rescue and excavate it.

Feeling extremely regretful, Xia ruofei could only remind her to take care of her safety and then hung up the phone.

Song Wei was not in the capital and Xia ruofei felt bored. He wanted to get the visa as soon as possible with his identity. Then, he would go to Italy and help Monica’s brother, Rousey, cure his leg. After that, he was ready to go back to San Shan.

After all, the company was building a pharmaceutical factory branch, as well as the expansion of the farm and a lot of other things. He felt a little bad for being away from home for a long time and throwing all the work to Feng Jing and Dong Yun.

Hence, Xia ruofei gave Captain Liu An a call and told him that he had to fly to Italy in the next few days. He asked him to make preparations in advance.

For international flights like this, not only did they have to apply for a route in advance, but the cabin crew also had to go through some procedures. After all, when they arrived in Italy, Xia ruofei did not return home immediately, and the cabin crew could not stay on the plane all the time. They would have to enter the country too.

Fortunately, most of the crew members were Chinese – American, so it was easy to go to Italy.

After making the arrangements to leave the country, Xia ruofei had some free time. He thought of the gray box that was still lying in the spirit map space and the world stones inside.

Once this thought appeared, it immediately grew. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but take out the box from the space.

1,2,3 ... A total of 18 world stones. Not a single one was missing. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

After Xia ruofei took out the world stone, he removed the restriction on the white fox. Then, he ignored the little fellow’s protest and retracted his consciousness.

He stood up and went over to lock all the doors and windows. Then, he drew the curtains tightly. Only then did he take out the spirit map scroll from his palm. He casually picked up a world stone and slowly moved it closer to gupu’s scroll ...
