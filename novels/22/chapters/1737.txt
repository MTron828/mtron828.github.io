Chapter 1738: Leap – Type upgrade_1

When Xia ruofei arrived at the middle courtyard of his residence, Song Wei was sitting at the stone table under the grape trellis. Her hands were on the stone table, supporting her face. She was staring straight ahead, but her eyes were not focused. It was obvious that she was not looking at anything. She was just in a daze.

Xia ruofei did not deliberately lower his footsteps, but Song Wei did not hear him. This was very abnormal for a master – to – be who was about to reach Qi disciple Level 3.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”what are you thinking about?” He’s so engrossed!”

Song Wei suddenly woke up from her thoughts and turned to look at Xia ruofei. She blushed and said, “You’re back?”

Xia ruofei nodded.”I heard from Wuqiang that you’ve been here for a while. Why didn’t you come in and sit?”

“The air outside is even better!” Song Wei chuckled and looked Xia ruofei up and down. She could not help but look at Xia ruofei strangely and asked,”what have you been doing? How did it end up like this? Did you ... Go dig up some ancient tomb again?”

In the morning, Xia ruofei had dug ten big holes in Xiaotang town. His clothes and shoes were inevitably stained with mud. It looked like he had crawled out of the holes. This reminded Song Wei of the scene when they explored the underground palace not long ago.

“So, in your eyes, I’m someone who digs up graves every day?” Xia ruofei laughed.

“Isn’t that so?”Song Wei chuckled. I’ve seen it with my own eyes!”

“No, I didn ‘t!” Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”I just dug a few holes in the suburbs this morning!”

“What’s the matter that needs you, the big boss, to do it personally?” Song Wei was surprised.”Don’t tell me you can’t even afford to hire workers?”

“There’s a special situation, so I can only do it myself. ” Xia ruofei said,”let’s not talk about this. I’m starving! Have you had lunch? If you haven ‘t, I’ll ask Wu Qiang to make more noodles. ”

“I came over after I finished eating.” Song Wei asked,”why haven’t you eaten yet? Why don’t you stop eating noodles and I’ll take you out to eat!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”I don’t want to trouble you. I’ve already asked Wu Qiang to boil some water. Since you’ve already eaten, I won’t prepare your share!”

“MMH! Then quickly get Wu Qiang to prepare!” Song Wei said,”Don’t Starve yourself!”

“Sure!” Xia ruofei nodded.

Then, he added,”Song Wei, it doesn’t matter what you’re looking for me for. You have to wait for me. I’m so dirty. I need to take a shower first.”

Song Wei laughed and said,”go!” Do you want me to go to the backyard and tell Wu Qiang, then you can eat the noodles after you’re done washing. ”

“No need, no need!” Xia ruofei waved the phone in his hand and said,”I’ll just call him!”

Then, Xia ruofei searched for Wu Qiang’s number and dialed it as he walked into his super large master bedroom.

He told Wu Qiang to prepare the noodles for him to eat alone. Then, he found a clean set of home clothes and went to the bathroom to take a quick shower.

When Xia ruofei came out after changing his clothes, Wu Qiang had just served the noodles. There were hand – scooped noodles, his own fried sauce, two fried eggs, and two pieces of ham. Just looking at it made one’s appetite go up, and the smell was very fragrant.

“You’ve worked hard, Wu Qiang!” Xia ruofei said,”go and rest! I’ll clean this bowl myself later. ”

Wu Qiang looked at Song Wei and said,”director Xia, you can just leave the bowl in the courtyard after you’re done. I’ll come over in the evening to clean it up.”

Song Wei had come a few times, and each time, she would stay for at least half a day. Wu Qiang had started to pay attention to her. There was even one time when he accidentally came to the middle courtyard and found that the door to Xia ruofei’s master bedroom was closed. He quickly left.

Therefore, Wu Qiang inevitably made some connections. Although he already knew that Xia ruofei had a girlfriend in the three mountains, it was normal for a Big Shot like Xia ruofei to have a few women around him. As for Song Wei, in Wu Qiang’s heart, she had already become Xia ruofei’s woman.

Therefore, Wu Qiang was worried that he would disturb their ‘two – person world’ if he came in rashly to clean up the dishes. That was why he said that he would come to clean up in the evening.

Xia ruofei had already guessed that Song Wei’s intention was to cultivate. Hence, after hearing Wu Qiang’s words, he didn’t think much about it and nodded,”Alright! Go back and rest, you don’t have to worry about this!”

As a girl, Song Wei’s mind was naturally more meticulous. After hearing Wu Qiang’s words, she could not help but blush and her expression became a little embarrassed.

Fortunately, Wu Qiang quickly left the courtyard tactfully while Xia ruofei began to eat her noodles in big mouthfuls. No one noticed her embarrassed expression.

Very quickly, Xia ruofei had finished the bowl of noodles. Song Wei could not help but laugh,””Looks like you’re really hungry. You don’t have to wash this bowl after you finish it ...”

Xia ruofei chuckled and wiped his mouth with a tissue. He said,””Speak! Why are you looking for me?” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Song Wei’s eyes became a little resentful and said,”You brat, you returned to the capital yesterday and didn’t even tell me! I only found out after watching the news! By the way ... You’re really an internet celebrity now! He caused such a big problem just by taking a plane!”

Song Wei’s tone sounded relaxed, but in reality, when the news that the quanté plane was off course was released, she was extremely worried. It was as if the end of the world had come.
