3069 A small punishment and a big warning (1)

Sun Xiao continued,”senior, just leave this to me!” I’ll get someone to arrange for you to stay in the hotel!”

With that said, Sun Xiao beckoned for the doorman at the hotel entrance not far away and instructed,””Arrange for this gentleman to stay in Suite 3. I’ll talk to President li. I’ll fill in the formalities later!”

“Yes, manager sun!” The doorman quickly replied.

Then, the doorman said to Xia ruofei respectfully,””This gentleman, please follow me...Oh, yes, your ...”

“I didn’t bring my luggage!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”thank you for your hard work. Let’s go!”

Xia ruofei took two steps and stopped. He said to the doorman,””Give me a moment.” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Then, he walked back to Sun Xiao’s side and took out a few Chinese yuan from the spirit map space. It was exactly forty Yuan.

Xia ruofei handed the money to Sun Xiao and said,””A lesson is a lesson, but you still have to pay for the ride.”

“Senior, I have money here ...” Sun Xiao quickly said.

He also felt a little drunk. This senior’s quirks really made him not know whether to laugh or cry!

“It’s only right and proper to pay for the ride. I have to pay for the ride myself. ” Xia ruofei said,”take it! I’m going to take a rest ...”

With that, Xia ruofei stuffed the money into Sun Xiao’s hand and turned to walk back to the hotel.

Sun Xiao didn’t dare to refuse and held the money in his hand, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.

He turned his gaze to the taxi and was instantly filled with anger.

If it wasn’t for this taxi driver, there wouldn’t have been such a scene today.

Although this matter had nothing to do with him, this taxi driver had affected the mood of the young sect master’s guest. If his mood was bad and the senior had a bad experience while staying in the Tianfeng hotel, then it would be his responsibility.

Besides, Xia ruofei had made it very clear. How could such a “senior” deliberately make things difficult for a brother? Therefore, there was no need to verify this matter. It could be basically confirmed that the driver was the problem.

Sun Xiao was in charge of these matters in the secular world, so he was naturally influenced by some of the social phenomena. The violation of the rules by car rental drivers was a rather prominent problem in many cities, especially tourist cities with relatively large traffic.

And today, this person had clearly hit the muzzle.

When Xia ruofei was leaving, the taxi driver saw it from his car but he did not even have the courage to call out to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei’s cold tone in the car and the feeling of falling into an ice cave had already left a shadow in his heart.

He didn’t even want the fare now.

If it wasn’t for the fact that he didn’t have the courage to run and his legs were still weak, he would have driven away immediately.

Sun Xiao coldly looked at the driver who was sitting in the driver’s seat, completely out of his wits. He walked over, patted the roof of the car, and shouted in the local language,””Come out!”

The taxi driver opened the door and got out of the car with a long face.

Without waiting for Sun Xiao to speak, the taxi driver quickly said,””Big brother, it’s my fault this time. I don’t dare to take the money anymore. Since it’s my first time, please spare me this time ...”

Sun Xiao sneered. Let him go? How could it be so easy? Although senior had said that he wanted to “punish the past and punish the future to cure the disease and save the people,” this didn’t mean that he could smooth things over. If he let the person go after everything was clear, he would be in a difficult position if senior asked.

“Cut the crap! What happened today?” Sun Xiao asked fiercely,”also, what’s wrong with the meter? You better be honest with me! If you don’t make it clear, don’t even think about leaving today!”

Following that, Sun Xiao coldly looked at the taxi driver and said,””If you dare to hide anything from me, I can guarantee that you will never be in this business again! We’re quite familiar with the Transportation Department. ”

The taxi driver trembled slightly and quickly said,”I don’t dare! He didn’t dare! This ... The taximeter might be a little off, but I rent a car too. The owner never repaired it, so I ...”

“You’re hoping to get lucky, right?” Sun Xiao nibbled at the taxi driver with a faint smile and said,”you want to get away with it? It seems like you won’t shed tears until you see the coffin!”

With that said, Sun Xiao took out his cell phone and began searching through his address book.

In fact, he was also a little embarrassed about Yingying. This matter was too small. When some of his friends took care of this matter, it always felt like a cannon hitting a mosquito. Who should he look for?

After flipping through a few pages, he really found a suitable candidate. He was the director of the Transportation Department, whose surname was li.

So, he dialed it directly and turned on the Hands – Free mode. Then, he showed the phone screen to the taxi driver and said,””It’s so good to watch! This is the price of lying ...”

When the taxi driver saw the name displayed on the phone, he was completely flustered. Director li wasn’t very important to Sun Xiao. If she hadn’t looked through her contact list, she wouldn’t have even remembered exchanging contact information with this person. But in the eyes of these taxi drivers, this person was the boss! He was directly in charge of the operation of the car rental. The transportation management personnel who caught illegal operations and car rental violations on the road were all from this director Li’s Department.

“Mr. Sun! Hello, hello!” Director Li’s warm and humble voice came through the phone.
