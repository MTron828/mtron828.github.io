2039 A face full of confusion (1)

In fact, Xia ruofei had already seen Monica’s determination in the courtyard of Toles ‘villa that day.

When he saw the email today, his heart was in turmoil.

There was no doubt that Monica had written her last letter in that situation. Monica did not hide her passionate feelings for Xia ruofei at all in the letter. She also sincerely asked Xia ruofei to go to Italy to save her brother Rossi. It was equivalent to entrusting her child to her.

Xia ruofei stared at the phone screen for a long time. Suddenly, he raised his head and said,””Sir, please find a place to Park.”

The taxi driver looked at Xia ruofei in surprise and said,””This place is quite far from liuhai Lane!”

“I’m sorry, I suddenly remembered that I have something to do. I won’t go back for the time being!” Xia ruofei said.

“Alright!” The taxi driver replied readily. He then found a temporary parking spot and slowly stopped the car.

Xia ruofei took out a 100 yuan note and handed it to the man.””Thank you, master! There’s no need to look ...”

Then, he pushed the door open and got out of the car. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Xia ruofei stood on the streets of the capital. They had just parted ways, but he still missed Monica, who was far away in Italy.

Xia ruofei muttered to himself on the street.

Monica mentioned in the email that her brother, Rossi, was under house arrest by the family, and naturally, she also mentioned Rossi’s physical disability.

In Xia ruofei’s eyes, this was an opportunity.

In fact, when he was in Italy, Xia ruofei already had the intention to save Rousey. However, he had appeared in Turin as Xia Tian and had only met Monica by chance. If the Hong sect’s attack on the Gelman family could be explained by the Hong sect’s own interests, then his action of treating Rousey’s leg disease, which was the sequelae of polio, which was not effectively treated by modern medicine, was very abrupt.

Initially, Xia ruofei had planned to find a reason or pretend to ask about Monica’s family after returning to the country. He would then suggest to try treating Rousey after learning about his condition.

Now that Monica had mentioned it in her email, Xia ruofei did not need to go in circles.

He thought for a while and called Monica.

……

In a small Manor in the southern suburbs of Turin.

Monica was carefully reading the financial statements in her exclusive office. The first thing she would do after taking over the GLO family was to thoroughly check the accounts of several companies under the family.

The core assets of the Grao family were these few companies, which were mainly engaged in truffle – related industries. Before this, it was naturally people who were absolutely loyal to Calas who held the power of the company. Now that Monica was in power, the first thing she had to do was to firmly grasp these few companies in her hands.

Controlling the financial lifeline was equivalent to controlling the entire family.

In addition to sending her more trusted clansmen to take over the company, Monica also entrusted a third – party independent accounting firm to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the accounts of these family companies.

The first purpose of doing so was naturally to find evidence of people from the original Calas’s side embezzling positions and pocketing. On the other hand, they also hoped to clear up the company’s accounts and solve all the problems left behind by history. Only then would everyone be able to travel with ease.

So Monica was quite busy these few days. Even her younger brother, Rousey, who couldn’t walk properly, couldn’t stay idle. He was also helping Monica take care of many matters of the family.

Monica looked at it very carefully, so much so that the phone on the desk rang a few times before she reacted.

She frowned slightly. There had been too many calls for her in the past few days, and it was difficult for her to concentrate on her work. Most of these calls were for her instructions and reports.

Monica had just taken over the family’s overall Affairs. She had to adopt a gentle attitude towards the family members, especially those who had taken the middle position in the matter between her and Rousey.

Therefore, although Monica was a little unhappy, she still put down the financial statement in her hand and reached for her phone.

When she saw the caller’s name on her phone, her beautiful eyes suddenly exuded a strange light, and her heart beat faster.

Monica’s hands trembled as she swiped open the phone screen and answered the call.

“Xia?” Monica said with a trembling voice.

She could not believe it. Xia ruofei seemed to have disappeared for the past few days. He did not reply to her urgent help email at all. Sometimes, she even wondered if Xia ruofei had deleted her contact information and did not even use the email address he left her.

After all, even though she and Xia ruofei had been together a few times, they had never confirmed their relationship as lovers. The two of them were more like each other’s relief from loneliness and didn’t have to take responsibility for each other. Even if Xia ruofei disappeared from her life, it wouldn’t be a surprise.

Xia ruofei’s gentle voice came from the phone.””Monica, it’s me!”

Monica’s tears flowed down immediately.

She didn’t know how she had survived these days. She didn’t dare to imagine what kind of tragic fate she would have faced if it wasn’t for that young Chinese man who also had the surname Xia.

Perhaps the best outcome would have been that she had successfully stabbed Toles to death that day, and then had the time to commit suicide!
