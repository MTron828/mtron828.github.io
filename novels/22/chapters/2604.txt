However, not long after Xia ruofei sat down, a nurse ran over and said breathlessly,””D – Doctor Xia ... The chief is awake! He ... He wants to see you!”

Xia ruofei was not surprised at all because he had calculated the dosage. Considering elder Liu’s physical condition, he should wake up by today. If he did not wake up in the morning, he would definitely wake up in the afternoon after the last bag of Chinese medicine was used.

However, Xia ruofei still pretended to be surprised. He stood up and said,””I’ll be there immediately!”

When Xia ruofei walked out of the room, Liu Qunfeng, who was the first to receive the news, had already run over.

When he saw Xia ruofei, Liu Qunfeng held his hand tightly and said excitedly,””Mr. Xia! Miracle doctor Xia! I’m really grateful!”

“Chief Liu, calm down ...” Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”If you faint again, I’ll have to help you!”

Liu Qunfeng did not mind Xia ruofei’s joke at all. He had been suppressing himself too much during this period of time. Now that old man Liu had woken up, it was as if he had found an outlet to release all his stress. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

In fact, when old man Liu had been seriously ill, all the members of the Liu family, including Liu Qunfeng, had already been mentally prepared the moment they had been diagnosed. So, although they had been very heavy – hearted at that time and felt very uncertain about the future of the Liu family, they had not been as worried as they were these days.

It was mainly because of Xia ruofei’s last interventional treatment, which gave Liu Qunfeng and the others infinite hope. At that time, elder Liu’s illness had already recovered to a rather good extent. Even the 301 specialist who came to do the routine examination for the old man was calling it a miracle. However, because of Liu Lifang’s foolish actions, all of her efforts had gone to waste.

This feeling of going from peak to bottom was much more exciting than riding a roller coaster.

From great hope to despair, it was a steep curve. This was Liu Qunfeng’s mental journey these days.

Now that elder Liu had woken up again, it was as if a dazzling light had suddenly shone into the dark heart. Even Liu Qunfeng, who was usually very good at maintaining his composure, could not control his emotions this time.

“Mr. Xia, please go in!” Liu Qunfeng said. The old master wants to see you! Oh right ... I’ll have to trouble you ...”

“Don’t worry, I’ll check on his physical condition at the first moment.” Xia ruofei smiled.”Don’t forget, I’m a doctor!”

“Yes, yes, yes!” “Please!” Liu Qunfeng said quickly.

Xia ruofei strode into old master Liu’s ward. When the doctors and nurses saw him, they immediately left the room. They had been used to Xia ruofei’s “special privileges” these days.

Of course, none of these experts and professors were unconvinced. After all, in such a desperate situation, he could still repeatedly create miracles. These experts and professors knew that they didn’t have the ability to do so.

If it weren’t for their military status and the order from their superiors to keep it a secret, they would definitely have taken the treatment to their colleagues for all kinds of discussions.

Xia ruofei walked into the quiet Ward. Old master Liu was lying on the bed with his eyes slightly closed. He still looked very weak, but when he heard Xia ruofei’s footsteps, he slowly opened his eyes.

When their eyes met, old master Liu’s eyes were filled with gratitude. He nodded at Xia ruofei with difficulty.

Xia ruofei walked over and said,”elder Liu, please don’t move. I’ll examine you.”

With that, Xia ruofei walked forward and skillfully grabbed old man Liu’s hand. He placed his fingers on his pulse and a stream of spiritual energy entered his body.

After a while, Xia ruofei stood up and said,””Elder Liu, the situation is not bad. The ventilator can be removed. Please wait a moment, I’ll go call him over. ”

Although Xia ruofei had no problem removing the catheter, he felt that it was better to let professional Western doctors do it.

In this situation, old master Liu could not even speak. It was very difficult for the two of them to communicate. Xia ruofei entered the room and saw his name written on a piece of paper beside the bed. He must have used this method to express his desire to see Xia ruofei when he had just woken up.

Through the examination just now, he found that after elder Liu regained consciousness, his body was still a little weak, but there was no problem with spontaneous breathing. There was no need to put on a ventilator at all, which was very painful for the patient.

Old man Liu revealed a grateful expression and nodded slightly.

Xia ruofei walked to the door and greeted them. Liu Qunfeng and the head of the specialist medical team, professor Luo, came to greet them.

Without waiting for them to ask, Xia ruofei said,””I’ve checked. Mr. Liu’s consciousness has returned, and his physical condition is not bad. Remove the ventilator and nasofeed tube first!”

“Alright!” Liu Qunfeng said without hesitation,”professor Luo, I’ll have to trouble you!”

Initially, professor Luo thought that it was too careless and sloppy to remove the tube right after the patient regained consciousness. Although Xia ruofei’s status was extraordinary and even the Liu family thought that his words were golden rules in terms of treatment, professor Luo still tried to persuade him.

After all, in the view of Western medicine, it was necessary to go through a detailed examination, combined with various indicators, and confirm that the requirements were met before the ventilator could be removed.

However, before he could say anything, Liu Qunfeng had already agreed to Xia ruofei’s decision.

Professor Luo smiled bitterly. He sighed and swallowed the words he was about to say.

“Alright, I’ll make the arrangements.” Professor Luo said with a hint of helplessness.

“Please wait a moment!” Xia ruofei called out.

Professor Luo stopped and asked,””Is there anything else, doctor Xia?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”after removing the ventilator, give the remaining bag of Chinese medicine to elder Liu.” Take it orally. ”

Although elder Liu had just taken the medicine, under normal circumstances, he should have taken it in the afternoon. Otherwise, the interval between taking the medicine would have been too short. However, he had already agreed to remove the tube, so why would professor Luo waste his breath on such a small issue?

Anyway, Xia ruofei was the one who provided the Chinese medicine, and the patient’s family had absolute trust in Xia ruofei. If something really happened, the specialist Group would not be the scapegoat.

Therefore, professor Luo nodded and said,””Alright!”

“You have to tell the nurse not to let her skin come into direct contact with the medicine!” Liu Qunfeng quickly added.

This was the experience that he had gained in exchange for a huge lesson!

Professor Luo’s expression was a little strange. He felt that the request was too strange, but he still nodded and said,””Okay, chief Liu, I’ll remind you.”

After that, professor Luo took the doctors from Room 301 to the ward to remove the ventilator.

Liu Qunfeng and Xia ruofei were waiting at the door.

Liu Qunfeng hesitated, then asked,””Mr. Xia, my father has just taken a bag of medicine. Will it be a problem for him to drink another bag now? Don’t get me wrong, I’m not doubting your medical skills, but as the patient’s family ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand,”understood!” He understood! Don’t worry, chief Liu. I know what to do with the medicine. When elder Liu is awake, his body’s energy consumption will be much greater than when he is unconscious, but at the same time, his absorption ability will also increase accordingly. This is like the war entering a stalemate stage, and the troops need to replenish their supplies, so I added a dose of medicine!”

“Oh, I see ...” Liu Qunfeng said.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but secretly laugh. He had made up this story casually. It would be a wonder if Liu Qunfeng could understand it!
