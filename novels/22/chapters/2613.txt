2614 The green cloud Island (2)

After blue cloud Island became a private island, miscellaneous people naturally could not come to the island. The ponautu government had undergone several changes of regime after that, but the Liu family’s control over blue cloud Island had always been recognized. In fact, even if they did not admit it, they could not do anything. After many years of construction, the defense capability of blue cloud Island was no longer something that the ponautu Army could break through.

The Liu family was not only building the infrastructure on the ground, but also the construction of various defense facilities of the highest standards. They even purchased air defense systems from the black market.

The other tidal fortifications, detection radars, monitoring systems, and so on were all built according to the highest standards.

In addition, the Liu family had also raised a mercenary army to be responsible for the defense of the island.

It could be said that after so many years of construction, blue cloud Island had become a private island that was armed to the teeth.

To build a large island like this, the cost was naturally not small.

Over the years, the Liu family had been investing a lot of money every year. All of their money added up to at least two or three billion US dollars.

Therefore, the three conditions proposed by old man Liu were basically the same in terms of money.

Old man Liu looked at Liu Qunfeng with a smile and asked, ” “Qunfeng, which one do you think little Xia will choose? Or ... Will he still be unmoved and not choose any of the three conditions? ”

“That’s impossible!” Liu Qunfeng said, ” how can I not be tempted by such a good offer? ”

Liu Qunfeng started to hesitate, “As for which one you want me to guess ... I’m not too sure ... Logically speaking, he would definitely choose the shares, but Mr. Xia isn’t an ordinary person, so it’s hard to guess what he’s thinking ...”

Old man Liu nodded and said, ” “Then let’s wait and see!”

Liu Qunfeng hesitated for a moment, but he still said, ” “Dad! I know that no matter how much it costs, it’s worth it if it can bring back your health. It’s just that ... Aren’t the conditions you’ve offered a little too good? No matter which one Mr. Xia chooses, it’ll be like cutting a piece of flesh from our hearts! Let’s not talk about other things, just the blue cloud Island is the painstaking effort you’ve planned for several years! And after we successfully bought it, we spent so many years building it up bit by bit, and now we’re giving it to Mr. Xia just like that, don’t you ... Feel bad? ”

“I’ve always believed in the principle of equivalent exchange,”said old man Liu indifferently. Xiao Xia treated me, so we’ll pay the same price. This is the fairest thing to do. QUN FENG, don’t tell anyone about this, in case they change their minds!”

“Alright, I understand!”Liu Qunfeng nodded.

Seeing his father’s white hair and tired face, Liu Qunfeng couldn’t help but feel sad. In the past, elder Liu would not have been so careful. The Liu family would not have dared to object to his decision. However, this time, old man Liu chose to tell him alone and hid it from the other clansmen. He obviously felt that he couldn’t follow his heart and couldn’t even suppress the people below him.

This was also very normal. In ancient times, if the emperor’s body couldn’t take it, the ministers under him would still have different thoughts! The princes would also become restless.

Moreover, old man Liu was only the head of a family.

Old man Liu had spoken a lot today, and the fatigue on his face was becoming more and more obvious. Liu Qunfeng quickly told him to lie down and rest, and then he quietly left the ward.

Liu Qunfeng hesitated for a long time, but in the end, he didn’t make the call. He sighed, put his phone in his pocket, and walked back to his room.

……

The next morning, after Xia ruofei had his breakfast at the courtyard in liuhai Lane, he asked Wu Qiang to drive him to the Liu family’s residence.

Liu Qunfeng had expected Xia ruofei to come this morning, so he had been waiting downstairs in advance.

Seeing Xia ruofei get out of the car, Liu Qunfeng quickly went up to him.

Xia ruofei took the thermal box containing the Chinese medicine from Wu Qiang’s hands and said,””You can go back first! I’ll give you a call when I’m using the car!”

“Okay, boss!” Wu Qiang said respectfully.

“Mr. Xia, you’ve worked hard! You’ve worked hard!” Liu Qunfeng greeted him with a smile.

“Good Morning, chief Liu!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Liu Qunfeng looked at the thermal box in Xia ruofei’s hand. He knew that it was filled with his father’s life – saving medicine.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”chief Liu, the medicine is ready. As there is a limited amount of medicinal materials, I have only prepared three days ‘worth of medicine. Let’s go and give one pack to the chief first!”

“Sure, Mr. Xia, please!” Liu Qunfeng quickly said.

He had been waiting for Xia ruofei to say this! Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The two of them made it upstairs. Xia ruofei went to the room next to elder Liu first and placed all the Chinese medicine bags in the thermal box into the refrigerator, leaving only one bag outside.

Liu Qunfeng then strictly ordered the guards to do their best and not allow anyone to get close to the fridge.

Then, he pulled Xia ruofei to the side and said,””Mr. Xia, I need to talk to you about something ...”

Xia ruofei was confused. He followed Liu Qunfeng to the corridor and asked,””Chief Liu, let’s give elder Liu the medicine first ...”

“Wait a moment! I won’t be able to hold you up for long. ” Liu Qunfeng quickly said.

“Alright then! Chief Liu, if there’s anything, just get straight to the point, don’t beat around the bush!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Alright! Alright!” Liu Qunfeng said. Then, he looked at the door of elder Liu’s room and said in a low voice,”today, my father will probably propose a few plans to you ... The plans to pay you for your treatment.”

Liu Qunfeng observed Xia ruofei’s expression as he spoke. He could not help but sigh when he saw that Xia ruofei was still calm. It seemed that Xia ruofei had already expected this.

“My father has three options for you to choose from,” Liu Qunfeng continued,”I have a request ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Chief Liu, since it’s a presumptuous request, why don’t you just keep it to yourself so that we don’t hurt each other’s feelings?”

Liu Qunfeng couldn’t help but be stunned. Why didn’t this guy play by the rules? I was just being polite ...

Liu Qunfeng smiled awkwardly and said,””That being said, I still have to say ... It’s like this. One of the plans my father proposed is to give you a certain amount of shares, the shares of our family group. If possible ... I hope you don’t choose this plan. ”

Without waiting for Xia ruofei to speak, Liu Qunfeng quickly said,””Of course, I can guarantee that the three plans my father put forward are all of the same value. If you choose either of the other two plans, you definitely won’t lose anything ... The main thing is the shares of the family group. The implications are relatively large. You know my father’s temper. No one can change his mind once he’s decided on something. So, I can only be thick – skinned and beg you ...”

After Xia ruofei heard this, he said,””I know, I’ll consider it. But ... I don’t have much confidence in the treatment right now, so isn’t it a little too early to talk about the treatment fee?”

Liu Qunfeng thought to himself, I’ll never believe you! If you weren’t confident, would you have the patience to listen to me?

Although Xia ruofei’s lofty image from a few days ago had an impact on him, he was also secretly glad that Yingluo had done so. At least, his father’s difficulties could be overcome, and there was a high chance that he could get rid of the disease.

“I understand! I understand!” Liu Qunfeng quickly said,”I’m just telling you this in advance. If my father brings this up, please consider my request.”

“Alright,” he said. Xia ruofei said indifferently,”then ... Can we go in now?”

“Of course! Of course!” “Please, Mr. Xia,” Liu Qunfeng said.
