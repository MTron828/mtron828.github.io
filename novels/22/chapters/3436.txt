Ling Qingxuc looked at the barrier and asked,””RUO Fei, What’s this? Could it be the reward for completing the mission?”

Xia ruofei shook his head.”I don’t think so. My perceptual mirror didn’t show any prompt about the completion of the mission. Besides, don’t we have to evaluate the completion rate before giving out the reward?” It definitely won’t be that fast!”

“Then, we…” Ling Qingxuc was a little undecided.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”this is definitely not an ordinary item. Since it’s here, we can’t be polite, can we?” It’s one thing to be able to get it, but you should at least try!”

In the hidden space enshrouded in purple mist, the green – robed elder laughed,””Little kid, if you can get this thing, this old man will give it to you!”

The green – robed elder looked confident that Xia ruofei would not be able to get the crystal card.

Xia ruofei didn’t know that his every move was being watched by the green – robed elder. In fact, the green – robed elder could only observe the situation on Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue’s side. This was because all the other cultivators who entered the trial Pagoda had been eliminated without exception. The one who made it the furthest had only reached the fifth level of the trial Pagoda.

Xia ruofei said to Ling Qingxuc,”generally speaking, there’s no way to open this kind of barrier. You can only rely on your own strength to break it. Let me try first!”

Ling Qingxuc smiled and nodded,”of course!” If even you can’t break it, then I’ll probably be wasting my time trying!”

“That’s hard to say, but I’ll try first!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Thus, Ling Qingxuc stepped aside while Xia ruofei took two steps forward and stood in front of the barrier.

Xia ruofei had broken through a few similar barriers in the stone room in the mountain sea realm in the spirit map space, so he was quite experienced.

He didn’t attack the barrier directly because he knew that the stronger the attack, the stronger the rebound. If he rashly attacked the barrier, he might be hurt by the rebound unless he was confident that he could break it in one strike.

According to past experience, this kind of light barrier was very tough. Unless there was an absolute crushing force, the possibility of breaking it with brute force was extremely low.

Even with Xia ruofei’s current cultivation, he was not confident that he could break the first light screen in the stone room.

So, just like before, he carefully pressed his hands on the light screen of the barrier.

Sure enough, although the membrane wall of the ward was faintly discernible, it was very tough. Xia ruofei pressed it down lightly and only made it sink a little.

Xia ruofei tried to feel the toughness of the barrier and then increased his strength.

His vital Qi continued to flow through his meridians and into his palms.

As Xia ruofei’s pressure changed, the hole in the barrier membrane became bigger.

However, Xia ruofei soon felt that this Ward’s membrane was tougher than any he had encountered before. It was not just a little stronger.

Based on the current state of the membrane, he would probably need to increase his strength by ten times before the membrane could not withstand the pressure and break open.

Xia ruofei had used at least 80% of his strength.

Besides, even if Xia ruofei could use 10 times his strength, his body was not strong enough. He was afraid that his hand would be crushed before the Ward’s membrane was destroyed.

This conclusion made Xia ruofei a little depressed.

The crystal card protected by the barrier was obviously not an ordinary item. Such a good thing was right in front of him, but he could not get it at all. This feeling was much worse than when it had never appeared.

Giving up so easily had never been Xia ruofei’s style.

Even though he had a feeling that he might not be able to break this barrier, he would not admit defeat until he reached his limit.

Hence, Xia ruofei continued to increase his strength.

At this moment, his palm was already under tremendous pressure. He could feel his finger bones creaking as if they would crack at any moment.

Very quickly, Xia ruofei had already used all his strength and continued to release his Yuan Qi to maintain the maximum pressure.

He felt that his finger bones were beginning to be unable to withstand such a long period of extreme pressure, but he still gritted his teeth and persevered.

Ling Qingxue saw the pained expression on Xia ruofei’s face and knew that he was under great pressure. She could not help but feel worried.

She couldn’t help but want Xia ruofei to give up because her heart ached when she saw Xia ruofei in so much pain.

However, Xia ruofei’s determined look made Ling Qingxue unable to give up. She could only look at Xia ruofei with concern, her eyes misty. She was also cheering for him in her heart.

Xia ruofei’s vital Qi was still abundant, but this level of strength was obviously not enough. The enchantment’s membrane did not change too much, and it should still be quite far from its limit. If he could not increase the strength, it would not have broken so easily.

Xia ruofei felt the pain in his palm and sighed. He knew that he had no way of breaking the wizardry barrier.

The huge difference in power was enough to make people despair.

When Xia ruofei heard the sound of his metacarpal bone cracking, he decisively chose to give up..
