2697 The two sides meet (1)

The next morning, Xia ruofei had breakfast at the clubhouse and rested for a while. At around 9 am, he asked the staff to prepare a car for him and left the clubhouse.

Xia ruofei drove to the private kitchen where he used to hang out with Zhao Yongjun, song Rui, and the others.

In fact, if one wanted to be safe, it was definitely the safest to arrange for them to be in the Paradise gathering. However, the Paradise gathering’s territory was also set up with an array, and that martial uncle Zheng who was traveling with Wang Boshan was very likely to be Zheng Yongshou, who had the deepest understanding of array techniques in the star Seizer sect. If they were to meet at the Paradise gathering, it was very likely that the other party would be able to see through the existence of the array.

Hence, Xia ruofei could only settle for the second – best option and chose the private kitchen of the royal family as the meeting place.

Xia ruofei personally went to the royal family’s private kitchen and reserved the most luxurious private room. This was an independent small courtyard. Once the door was closed, no one would disturb him.

He asked the private restaurant to prepare a table of food and wine for lunch, and then asked the waiter to take him to the independent courtyard called green bamboo pavilion.

When they arrived at green bamboo pavilion, Xia ruofei said to the waiter,””I’m going to take a look at the environment here. It might take a little long. You don’t have to accompany me. I’ll look for you if I need anything.”

Although the waitress felt that it was a little strange that it took a long time to look at the room, the customer was God, and his request was very reasonable, so she didn’t say anything and nodded.””Alright! Sir, if there’s anything you need, or if you want to change a private room, you can directly call the front desk with the phone in the private room. ”

“Alright! Thanks a lot!” Xia ruofei smiled.

After the waiter left, Xia ruofei looked around the small courtyard. He even used his spiritual power to check it carefully.

Then, Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to spread out. After making sure that no one was spying on them, he raised his hands and rays of light shot out from his palms. In a flash, they disappeared into the garden, grass, and potted plants.

In the end, Xia ruofei flipped his palm and a warm jade stone appeared in his palm.

If a cultivator were to see it, they would definitely be able to see that this jade stone, which seemed to be traceless on the outside, was actually filled with dense and profound array patterns on the inside.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power penetrated the Jade slightly. A murderous aura suddenly rose in the courtyard, hiding an invisible killing intent.

Xia ruofei’s face showed a trace of satisfaction. He withdrew his spiritual power from the Jade, and the murderous aura immediately disappeared.

After making all the arrangements, Xia ruofei felt more at ease.

He had set up a small – scale deathtrap array in the courtyard, but he had not activated it yet. All the array foundations were carved out of Jade and hidden in every corner of the courtyard. The core of the array was the Jade in his hand.

As long as Xia ruofei did not input his spiritual power to activate the array, everything would be the same as usual. Even if senior uncle Zheng was an expert in array, he would not be able to discover it.

Besides, according to Xia ruofei’s judgment, Wang Boshan and junior uncle Zheng definitely did not realize that he was also a cultivator. Otherwise, they would not be like now, hoping to negotiate and buy the Paradise Island with money. The significance of the Paradise Island to cultivators was huge. If it fell into the hands of cultivators, it would be impossible to buy it with money.

Hence, Xia ruofei thought that Wang Boshan and that martial uncle Zheng would not be too guarded against him and would not notice the Jade array Foundation scattered in the hidden corner of the courtyard. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Of course, Xia ruofei was only doing this for a rainy day.

Although his cultivation had already reached the ninth level of the aura refining realm, and the star Seizer sect would only be able to match or even surpass him if they sent out experts of the same generation as Luo Qingfeng, he had never dared to underestimate the foundation of a cultivation sect. Perhaps these people had some unexpected skills. In addition, he basically had no experience in fighting between cultivators. If he did not make more preparations and really fell out with them, he might not have the confidence to win.

He had set up this trap and kill array in preparation for the worst possible scenario.

By then, Xia ruofei would only need to jump into the courtyard from the private room and he would be basically invincible.

He had already observed in advance that there was a Xuan window on the left side of the master’s seat in the private room. When needed, this kind of exquisite Xuan window did not need to be opened at all. He could just hit the Xuan window and directly jump into the courtyard.

The other party would definitely chase after them, and when the trap & kill array was activated, it should have no problem dealing with Qi condensation cultivators.

However, if it was not necessary, Xia ruofei would definitely not choose to make a move here.

After all, this was the capital. The commotion caused by a battle between cultivators would not be small. If it were to be stirred up, it might spread to the whole city, and it was very likely to reveal his identity as a cultivator.

Therefore, in Xia ruofei’s plan, the location of the attack was still Peach Blossom Island. The current arrangement was just a plan for failure before the victory.

Xia ruofei checked again before walking out of the courtyard of green bamboo pavilion.

He confirmed with the private restaurant that he wanted to go to green bamboo pavilion and told them not to serve the dishes or let the waiters enter the courtyard when the guests arrived. He would call them when he needed them.
