“Brother Zhao, you go with Wu Qiang first. I’ll pack my luggage and find some wine!” Xia ruofei said.

Zhao Yongjun treated Xia ruofei’s place like his own home. He smiled and said,””Alright! Hurry up! The liquor worm in my stomach has been hooked!”

After Zhao Yong Jun went to the backyard, Xia ruofei took out five bottles of Drunken Eight Immortals from the medium. They were all aged wine that he had stored in the medium since the beginning. They were much better than the best Drunken Eight Immortals sold in the market.

He only had 20 to 30 bottles of this wine left. For the past half a year, he had been busy with his business. At most, he would routinely store the new wine that the winery sent to the warehouse every month into the storage space, and then hand over the wine that had been nourished by the spiritual energy of the storage space to the winery. He did not have any wine left for himself.

That was why Xia ruofei rarely took out this kind of wine to entertain guests. Today, he took out five bottles at once because he was very grateful to Zhao Yongjun.

Xia ruofei found a paper bag and put the three bottles of wine in it. He held two bottles in his other hand and walked to the backyard.

In the dining room, Zhao Yongjun had already sat down. Xia ruofei didn’t see Xia Xiaolan and Wu Xiujuan, so he said,””Wu Qiang, go and get your sister – in – Law and Xiao LAN. We’ll eat together!”

Wu Qiang hesitated and said,”chief Xia, they’re busy in the kitchen!” You can eat with the old company commander, we have some food left …”

Xia ruofei frowned and said,””Why go through so much trouble? We can just eat together, I’m not that particular!”

Zhao Yongjun laughed and said,”ruofei, forget it!” They’ll feel uncomfortable if we let them come over, so let’s just eat!”

Xia ruofei thought about it and felt that Zhao Yongjun’s words made sense. Even though he didn’t put on airs, Wu Xiujuan and Xia Xiaolan weren’t very close to him. He would definitely be very restrained in front of the boss. If he forced them to come over, they would feel awkward instead.

Xia ruofei nodded and agreed.

Then, he put the paper bag on the table and said,””Wu Qiang, put these few bottles of wine in brother Zhao’s car!”

Zhao Yongjun had driven here today, but he had left his car in the garage of the courtyard house. He then went to the airport with Wu Qiang’s Land Rover.

“Yes!” “Yes!” Wu Qiang replied and left with the paper bag.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”Wu Qiang, you should go and have dinner with your sister – in – Law and Xiao LAN.” You don’t need to worry about this …”

“President Xia …” Wu Qiang hesitated for a moment. He felt that he should stay behind to serve the two of them. Otherwise, there would not even be someone to pour wine for them.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”go!” We have hands and feet, we don’t need anyone to serve us!”

“Yes!” Only then did Wu Qiang stop making things difficult for him. He walked out of the restaurant and closed the door behind him.

Xia ruofei placed the other two bottles of wine on the table and laughed.””Brother Zhao, let’s each take a bottle today. We’ll each take care of our own business. No one will pour wine for the other, and no one will play tricks. How about that?”

Zhao Yongjun laughed and said,””Very good! It’s decided!”

After saying that, he unscrewed a bottle of wine and poured himself a glass. Then, he placed the bottle beside him and said,””Don’t just stand there, pour the wine first! Let’s have a go!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei also opened the bottle and poured himself a glass.

“Big brother Zhao, it’s all thanks to you this time. I won’t say any more polite words. It’s all in the wine!” This little brother will drink first as a form of respect!”

Xia ruofei raised his glass and finished the small glass of white wine.

“Straightforward!” Zhao Yongjun gave him a thumbs up and finished the white wine in his glass.

Zhao Yongjun drank the Drunken Eight Immortals wine in one big gulp and couldn’t help but sigh in comfort. His eyes were shining as he said,”This is what it means to be drunk! RUO Fei, the bottles you gave me are the same, right?”

“Of course!” Xia ruofei smiled and took a bite of the food.”This is my rare wine collection! One bottle is one bottle less!”

In fact, Xia ruofei really wanted to drink. He could get a big jar from the winery and bury it somewhere in the interspace. In a few months, he would have another big jar of aged wine. If he wanted to make it fast, he could even make the best wine in a few days with the help of the time array flag.

Zhao Yongjun naturally didn’t know about this. He pouted and said,””Then I’ll have to save some of my drink!”

The two of them drank and chatted, and they quickly finished half a bottle of white wine.

“It’s just the two of us today,” Zhao Yongjun said emotionally.”It still feels a little lonely. If only Xiao Rui, liangzi, and the others were here …”

“Brother Zhao, this is a special situation,” Xia ruofei said.”When I come back from Italy, I’ll call all of you and have a good drink!”

“Good! We’ll be waiting for you in the capital!” Zhao Yongjun said as he raised his glass,”this glass of wine wishes you a smooth trip to Italy! Your wishes come true!”

“Thanks!” Xia ruofei raised his cup and clinked it with Zhao Yongjun ‘s.”Brother Zhao, I’ll take your blessings!”

At first, the two drank quickly, but there was a fixed amount of white wine for this afternoon. One catty of white wine per person. For people who didn’t know how to drink, it was impossible to finish it. However, for Xia ruofei and Zhao Yongjun, they had to take it easy. Otherwise, their bottles would be empty in a few moments. So, they slowed down later on and only took a sip each time.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com
