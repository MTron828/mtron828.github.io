Feng Rao and the rest only returned to the hotel after nine in the evening. Pang Hao even called Xia ruofei to let him know that he was safe.

In the end, Liu Qian chose a Coach bag, which was worth about 50000 Yuan.

Initially, Liu Qian wanted to buy a bag that cost one or two thousand Yuan. However, Feng Jing rejected the promise that Xia ruofei had made. If she bought a bag that cost one or two thousand Yuan, she would be disrespecting the chairman.

According to Feng Jing and Dong Yun, they wanted to buy a bag that cost at least 100000 Yuan to not waste Xia ruofei’s good intentions. However, Liu Qian did not dare to accept it no matter what. In the end, they compromised and Feng Jing personally picked out the 50000 Yuan Coach bag for Liu Qian.

Liu Qian regarded this bag as a treasure and held it tightly in her arms throughout the shopping process, afraid of losing it.

For one thing, this was the first bag in her life that was so expensive. For another, it was a reward from the chairman, so it was of great significance.

Feng Jing and Dong Yun bought quite a few things as well. There were electronic products, clothes, and bags. Even pang Hao couldn’t help but buy his father a hermès belt.

Of course, none of them bought the jaded skin cream from Qin Zhuan studio, which was more effective than any other cosmetics. Why would they buy those expensive cosmetics with unknown effects?

The next day, Xia ruofei asked for a business car from Ma Zhiming and took a few of his capable subordinates to tour Hong Kong. After sending them to the airport in the afternoon, Xia ruofei returned to Hengfeng Jiahua Hotel.

Today, all the major media outlets in Hong Kong had reported about the auction.

“Star Island Evening News” had arranged a large report at the bottom of the front page with the title “mainland company makes a name for itself in Hong Kong!” “The total value of a single auction exceeded 100 million US dollars!”

‘Star Island Evening News’ wrote in its report,”At an auction at Hengfeng Jiahua Hotel yesterday, the transaction amount exceeded 100 million US dollars. This popular auction that had attracted many rich people from Asia, Europe, South America, and other places was not auctioning precious calligraphy and paintings, exquisite works of art, or priceless Jade and jewelry, but abalone, truffles, tea leaves, Cordyceps, iron – hide maple, ginseng, and other health food that could be seen on the dining table. What was so special about these things that even the rich with a net worth of ten billion Yuan would go after them? The reporter interviewed Mr. Guo Hongjiang, who had taken a photo of the pair of one – headed abalones yesterday ...

[Nanhua daily] wrote in the report: The Paradise Corporation from the mainland had held a special auction at Hengfeng Jiahua Hotel yesterday. Many items were being auctioned off, and the transaction volume successfully exceeded 100 million US dollars. This was the first time in Hong Kong’s history that ingredients and herbs were sold for more than 100 million US dollars.

[Hong Kong Economic news: the Paradise Corporation is holding a phenomenal auction.] Since the establishment of this mainland company, it had repeatedly created miracles in a short one or two years. Unknowingly, it had already possessed a rich product line and super – first – Class products. As long as it was in the field that paradise Corporation was involved in, their products would definitely surpass similar products by a large margin. There was no doubt that the company had great potential. If the company was listed in Hong Kong in the future, investors must pay close attention to it.

Hong Kong’s famous gourmet, Zhu Dayong, wrote in his online food column: At the beginning of the year, he was fortunate enough to have tasted the top – grade one – headed abalone at the abalone auction held by the Paradise Corporation. The delicious taste was still lingering in his mind. When I learned that another abalone would be auctioned this time, I signed up at the first opportunity. However, due to their limited financial strength and the popularity of the auction, it was a great regret that they were unable to bid for the one – headed abalone they were interested in ...

On the television, the news channel was broadcasting the auction scene. A reporter was interviewing Zheng jianian and he said to the camera,””The chairman of the Paradise Corporation, Xia ruofei, is the most courageous young man I’ve ever seen. The company is thriving under his leadership. Today’s auction transaction amount has exceeded 100 million US dollars. I’m not surprised at all. The Paradise Corporation has first – Class products and a first – Class leader. It’s only natural for them to achieve such results!”

MA Xiong, who was on the next – door CTV broadcast, said,””Paradise corporation’s products are undoubtedly the best in the industry. Today’s auction is proof that Hengfeng group will have a series of in – depth cooperation with paradise Corporation to promote these top – tier products to a larger consumer group!”

Changing the channel, Guo Hongjiang was also praising the Paradise Corporation ...

Those who didn’t know better would think that the entire TV station had been booked by the Paradise Corporation!

In addition to traditional paper and television media, online media also gave a large amount of coverage to the peach blossom company’s auction.

Moreover, online media was more effective. In fact, they had already started to push reports yesterday.

Photos of the scene, videos of the scene, and news close – up shots from different angles were all presented on the internet.

The wealth Chinese network had also specially produced a short video. This three – minute Short Video focused on the big screen that displayed the real – time transaction amount in the venue. At the same time, it was also mixed with some images of popular auction items being auctioned. Coupled with very hot music, it made people who watched it couldn’t help but feel excited.

Xia ruofei watched the video three times in his hotel room. Then, he called Xiao Qiang, the marketing director, who was staying at the company. He asked him to immediately arrange for the company’s official website to post the video in a prominent position. At the same time, the official WeChat and Weibo accounts would also send notifications about the auction with the video.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com
