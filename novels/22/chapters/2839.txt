2840 Explosive popularity (2)

Wu Junfeng had been in Barcelona for many years, so he had naturally obtained a Spain driver’s license.

He was now Wu Lei’s translator, driver, and Spanish teacher.

Xia ruofei was not in a hurry to move forward. The attention of the Spanish fans was on Wu Lei and they did not notice Xia ruofei who was not far away.

Xia ruofei stood there and looked at him with a smile. Wu Lei readily granted the young fan’s wish for an autograph. It was clear that he was quite friendly.

At this time, a few young people with Asian faces also shouted,””Wu Lei! Let’s take a picture together! We’re all Chinese students, and we’re here from Madrid to see you!”

When Wu Lei heard this, he readily followed her advice and simply pushed open the car door and got out.

When the fans saw Wu Lei communicating with their compatriots, they also made way for him in a cultured manner.

“Hello!” Wu Lei greeted the International students with a smile.

When the students saw that Wu Lei really got out of the car, they were very excited and asked for his autograph.

Seeing that his compatriots were particularly friendly overseas, Wu Lei naturally did not refuse them. He took the pen and began to sign for them.

When it was a fan’s turn wearing the old white number 7 national team uniform, Wu Lei asked with a smile,””Where should I sign?”

The fan did not prepare any photos, posters, autographs, or anything like that in advance, but each of these fans was holding a small flag. Perhaps he was a little nervous and excited to see Wu Lei, and his brain short – circuited, so he handed the small flag over.

Wu Lei was stunned for a moment and immediately said,””You can’t just randomly sign on the national flag!”

The fan also realized the problem and quickly took back the flag in embarrassment. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Wu Lei smiled and said,”if you don’t mind, I’ll sign on your Jersey.” Can I?”

“Alright, alright, alright!” The fan quickly said.

Hence, Wu Lei grabbed the lower hem of his Jersey and signed his name.

After signing, Wu Lei took a photo with the fans. Everyone spread out a big national flag with the gate of Dani Halk base as the background and entrusted a Spanish fan to take photos for everyone.

Just as Wu Lei was about to pose, he suddenly caught a glimpse of Xia ruofei, who was giggling and recording a video with his phone. He could not help but freeze.

After he came to his senses, Wu Lei opened his eyes wide and shouted,””Brother Xia! Why are you here?”

Xia ruofei was having a good time playing bystander and even recorded the scene just now. He did not expect that Wu Lei would spot him at a glance, even though the fans did not recognize him.

That was normal. After Wu Lei appeared, the fans ‘attention was on him. Wu Lei would not do that. Besides, when he was taking the photo, he was facing Xia ruofei. He could be seen at a glance.

The Spain fans did not quite understand what Wu Lei had shouted, but the Chinese fans who were studying abroad could all understand, so everyone turned their eyes to him.

It was as if everyone had discovered a new continent, and they all shouted in excitement.

Moreover, these Chinese fans obviously frequently visited social media platforms such as Weibo and Tieba in China. Therefore, they did not call Xia ruofei by his name but called him “CEO Xia”.

Although the Spain fans could not understand Chinese, they turned around curiously when they saw the Chinese fans and Wu Lei’s excited faces. Everyone saw Xia ruofei.

If Wu Lei’s performance in the past few rounds had established his image in the hearts of the Spanish fans, Xia ruofei had become the most popular player among the Spanish fans with just one and a half games, especially the game against Barcelona a few days ago.

The Spanish fans, whether they were local or Chinese students, all ran over excitedly. Even Wu Lei ran towards Xia ruofei like a little fan.

“Xia! You’re amazing! Thank you for the victory you brought to the parrot Army!” This was shouted by the local fans.

“President Xia! We love you “was obviously an international student from China.

There was even an international student who shouted,””President Xia, I want to bear your children!”

As soon as he said that, the students burst into laughter. The most outrageous thing was that the one who wanted to’ bear children ‘for Xia ruofei was not a girl, but a bearded otaku.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue laughed so hard that their bodies trembled. Xia ruofei, on the other hand, had a strange expression on his face.”Brother, your taste is a little heavy!”

“Hahaha!” The students who had stayed behind started laughing again.

Xia ruofei did not put on any airs, which made the International students feel even more cordial.

Since his identity had been exposed, Xia ruofei had no need to hide. He took pen and paper from the fans and signed for them.

Xia ruofei was the number one hero of Espanyol’s victory over bar?a. The fans were much more enthusiastic when they faced him than when they faced Wu Lei. Xia ruofei was quickly surrounded by people.

Wu Lei’s eyes flashed with worry when he saw this. He wanted to help Xia ruofei separate the fans, but he was stopped by Xia ruofei’s eyes.

As a cultivator who was about to enter the Golden core stage, no matter how crowded the crowd was, it would not have any effect on him. He stood among the fans like a pillar of support, his body not swaying in the slightest.

One by one, he signed autographs for everyone. When the fans wanted to take selfies with their mobile phones, Xia ruofei cooperated and smiled. He spent more than 20 minutes to satisfy the fans ‘requests.

After the fans had gotten their autographs, they politely thanked Xia ruofei and walked to the side, no longer crowding together.

After they had finally dealt with the passionate fans, Xia ruofei walked towards the group of international students with Ling Qingxue and Song Wei.

In all fairness, Xia ruofei was more popular than Wu Lei now, and so were the students who were studying abroad. They were naturally very happy to see their idol and came up to ask for his autograph.

Fortunately, there were not many international students and Xia ruofei signed the papers for them quickly.

Then, it was time for everyone to take a photo together. Wu Lei had originally wanted to invite Song Wei and Ling Qingxue over for a photo, but Song Wei was worried that the photo might be posted on social media, so she declined. Ling Qingxue was Xia ruofei’s official girlfriend, so she did not mind taking a photo with her. However, since Song Wei had declined, she would not go over to take a photo with her to avoid “unfair distribution”. So, she declined tactfully as well.

Hence, the responsibility of taking photos for everyone fell on Song Wei.

Song Wei was using one of the International students ‘Huawei phones to film the scene. Xia ruofei and Wu Lei were surrounded by fans. Everyone spread out the big national flag and smiled brightly at the camera.

Song Wei pressed the snap button at the right time and captured this moment.

In order to make sure that she didn’t do a bad job, Song Wei took a few photos in a row and then gave everyone an OK sign.

The crowd dispersed. The International student took the phone from Song Wei as if he had found a treasure. He couldn’t wait to look at the photo. The other international students also came over.

Xia ruofei and Wu Lei waved to the fans and walked towards the training base. Since Xia ruofei chose to walk, Wu Lei naturally could not go in by car.

Wu Junfeng drove the car directly to the parking lot of the base. Actually, he did not need to accompany Wu Lei today because Xia ruofei could easily handle the translation work.

Xia ruofei, Wu Lei, Song Wei, and Ling Qingxue walked into the training base while chatting. Wu Lei asked curiously,”Brother Xia, why did you suddenly come to the training ground today?”

“I haven’t moved in a few days. Come over and stretch your limbs!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”is there an internal match today? If not, how about we organize a small competition after training? I’m really getting an itch in my feet!”
