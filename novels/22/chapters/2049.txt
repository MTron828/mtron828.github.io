2050 Brother, I can only help you this much (1)

The facts had proven that it was not wise to compete with a cultivator in drinking.

Xia ruofei did not even use his true energy to force the alcohol out of his body. His terrifying alcohol tolerance after the change in his physique was enough to knock them all out without any suspense.

Zhao Yongjun mumbled,”good wine!” Satisfying ...”

With a loud thud, he collapsed on the table. Only Zhuo Yiyi and Xia ruofei were left in the dining room, fully awake.

Xia ruofei was slightly tipsy as he said to Zhuo Yiyi,””Yiyi, if you want to go back, I’ll get Wu Qiang to drive you back later. There’s no problem with staying here for a night. There are many rooms in the house, so I’ll let Wu Qiang’s girlfriend stay next to you. ”

He was also worried that a girl like Zhuo Yiyi would be afraid of living in a foreign place. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Zhuo Yiyi thought for a moment and said,”I think I’ll go back!” You reek of alcohol, you still have work tomorrow!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”deal!” But you’ll have to wait for a while. First, we have to settle these guys down!”

Zhuo Yiyi said,”it’s fine. It’s already so late. Don’t let Wu Qiang run back and forth. I’ll just call a cab!”

“That won’t do!” Xia ruofei said. It’s not safe for a girl to book a car online at this hour! If something really happens, Xiao Rui will kill me. ”

An unnatural expression appeared on Zhuo Yiyi’s face, and she said,””What does it have to do with that guy?”

Xia ruofei chuckled,”you’re just playing dumb!” We outsiders can see clearly what Xiao Rui’s intentions are. No matter how slow you are, it’s impossible that you can’t feel it at all, right?”

Then, Xia ruofei patted song Rui, who was like a pile of mud, and asked loudly,””Right? Xiao Rui!”

Song Rui twisted a few times and said in a daze,””Who is it? Who wants to drink with me? Come! Cheers ...”

Zhuo Yiyi smiled bitterly as she looked at song Rui. She sighed softly and said,””Ruofei, I didn’t mean to keep song Rui in suspense ...” He said.

“So you don’t have any feelings for him?” Xia ruofei asked.

“No!” Zhuo Yiyi said without hesitation. Then, she immediately came back to her senses. Her pretty face heated up slightly as she lowered her head and said,”song Rui is very concerned about me. I’m not made of mud, so how can I not feel anything at all?”

Xia ruofei had wanted to call Wu Qiang in to help Zhao Yongjun and the others get to sleep in the guest rooms, but after hearing what he said, he was no longer in a hurry.

He reached out to grab the bottle and poured Zhuo Yiyi a glass of Semillon.

Zhuo Yiyi was the only one drinking this bottle tonight, and since she was a lady, Zhao Yongjun and the others wouldn’t intentionally challenge her to a drinking contest, so there was still half a bottle left.

Xia ruofei also poured himself a cup of Drunken Eight Immortals. Then, he raised his cup and gestured to Zhuo Yiyi, saying,””Let’s have a drink first! If you don’t mind, you can tell me what you’re thinking. ”

This matter was related to his good brother’s lifelong happiness, so Xia ruofei was naturally very concerned. It just so happened that Zhuo Yiyi had drunk a little today. If he could take the opportunity to ask her about her true thoughts, it would be a good thing for song Rui.

Zhuo Yiyi was rather bold when it came to drinking. She raised her glass at Xia ruofei and downed it in one gulp.

Then, Zhuo Yiyi sighed softly and said,””Ruofei, I’m more cautious when it comes to relationships ... I know a little about song Rui’s family situation. I think ... The possibility of us ending up together is not high, so it’s better not to start something that’s destined to end without a result ...”

Xia ruofei sipped on his wine and did not interrupt Zhuo Yiyi.

Since she had opened her mouth, Zhuo Yiyi would naturally say what she had been keeping in her heart. She did not need Xia ruofei to guide her.

“That’s why I deliberately kept a certain distance from him,” Zhuo Yiyi continued.”I even treated him like a good brother. I wanted him to back off in the face of difficulties ...”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. “That’s because you don’t know Xiao Rui well enough. Although he may seem a little boisterous and unreliable at times, once he gets serious, he will never give up easily.”

Zhuo Yiyi nodded.”I’ve been holding myself back from contacting him because I don’t want to give him any hope. I don’t want to keep him in suspense like this either. But he ... He never seems to be discouraged, and he never gets impatient ...”

“Yiyi, let me share my opinion!” Xia ruofei laughed.

Zhuo Yiyi immediately nodded and said,”sure!” I don’t have anyone to talk to, not even Weiwei. After all, she’s a relative of song Rui ...”

“Actually, an outsider can’t help you with matters of the heart.” Xia ruofei said,”however, my personal opinion is that you are both still young. There is no need to suppress your current feelings for the future. Wasn’t it more important to experience a true love that both sides had given their all to? Wasn’t there a saying that was very popular now? It’s called grasping the present. We’re all young people in our twenties, so there’s no need to act like an old man. What do you think?”

After Xia ruofei finished speaking, he looked at Zhuo Yiyi with a smile.

Zhuo Yiyi’s eyes revealed a hint of confusion as she said,””I know you’re right, but I’ve been educated to be more traditional since I was young. Isn’t dating for marriage? If it’s not for marriage, then what’s the point of dating?”
