3315 High – Level astral beast (2)

The high – Level astral beast’s attacks sent stone fragments flying everywhere, but the formation only shook slightly. It was not damaged for the time being, so its field of vision was still a vast expanse of white. The visibility was very low, and it was surrounded by thick white fog.

This made it even more anxious and restless, and it attacked even more fiercely.

Of course, this high – Level Star Beast thought that it was destroying everything along the way, but in fact, it had long been affected by the array and had been moving in a very small circle.

This characteristic of a formation was very effective in trapping enemies. However, there were also some negative effects in this situation. The high – Level astral beast was always in this area, so its attacks basically all fell on the nodes of the array in this area.

In this way, the damage to these nodes would continue to stack. If the damage was stacked to a certain extent, it would inevitably have a great impact on the formation.

This was the main reason why Xia ruofei was so eager to attack.

After the formation’s offensive power was activated, black streaks of light appeared in the White mist. These streaks of light were more dense than ever before, almost covering the sky and earth, and there was no gap at all.

The high – Level astral beast immediately sensed the danger. It roared and waved its claws at a high speed. It was so fast that even Xia ruofei could not see the high – Level astral beast’s claws clearly. All he could see was an impenetrable shadow.

At the same time, the high level astral beast had also shrunk its head and body, completely hiding within the defensive line formed by its claws.

The crackling sounds continued to ring out.

The black rays of light quickly arrived in front of the high – Level Star Beast, but they were all swept away by the Star Beast’s claws. The rays of light were all diverted, and none of them landed on the Star Beast.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help frowning. He kept making hand seals and activating the formation to attack.

Such a sustained attack naturally consumed a lot of energy.

The pile of spirit stones that was as large as a small mountain was shrinking at a speed visible to the naked eye.

Xia ruofei continued to maintain the array as he threw out a pile of spiritual crystals.

This was an energy crystal that was purer than spirit stones.

At the moment, Xia ruofei’s energy reserve was very sufficient. Even if the formation continued to maintain its maximum attack, it would consume a long time.

However, the problem was that the attack speed of the black light was still not fast enough compared to the reaction speed of a high – Level Star Beast.

Therefore, the high – Level star beasts were able to block all the sharp lights. Occasionally, one or two of them would slip through, but he could use his flexible body to easily avoid them.

In other words, the continuous high consumption was in fact useless.

Xia ruofei frowned. After a while, he gritted his teeth and continued to activate the formation. His body flashed and followed a specific route towards the high – Level astral beast.

Since the black light could not be used for the time being, Xia ruofei could only add fuel to the fire.

If they were outside the array, he would not be so bold. A high – Level astral beast was at the nascent Soul Stage. It was much stronger than Chen Nanfeng, the number one cultivator in the world of cultivation. If they fought head – on, Xia ruofei had no chance of winning.

However, with the help of the formation, Xia ruofei had more confidence.

He could clearly observe the movements of the high level star beasts, but the high level star beasts were like blind and deaf, completely unable to see the situation around them.

Xia ruofei felt that it was not a problem for him to hide in the dark and play tricks.

A few minutes later, Xia ruofei was already near the high – Level astral beast, but it was still unaware.

Most of its attention was used to block the black light.

Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat. He made a hand seal, and the flying sword of the bent frost silently stabbed toward the high – Level Star Beast.

The angle at which qu Shuang’s flying sword pierced the high – Level Star Beast was just behind it, aiming at the lower part of the Star Beast’s ribs.

The high – Level astral beast was waving its front claws to block the black light, and the area under its ribs was open.

As it neared the high – Level Star Beast, the flying sword suddenly accelerated.

The whistling sound reached the Star Beast’s ears, and only then did it discover the crooked Frost Flying sword that had just appeared from the fog.

The high – Level Star Beast was both shocked and angry. It let out a furious roar and stomped its back foot, barely avoiding being hit in its vital parts. The flying sword of the bent frost stabbed into the hard scales on its back.

With a “ding” sound and a few sparks, the high – Level Star Beast was unscathed. The crooked Frost Flying sword couldn’t even leave a mark on the Star Beast’s body.

However, the high – Level Star beast’s hasty evasion of the curved Frost Flying sword had inevitably led to a gap in its defense.

A black ray of light passed through the shadow of its claws and landed on its front leg with a Swoosh.

When Xia ruofei had used the trap & kill array to kill the intermediate star beasts previously, the black light would cause a penetrating injury to the star beasts as long as it landed on them.

However, this time, the target was a high – Level astral beast, so the effect of the attack was not satisfactory.

The Jet – Black light had only pierced through less than an inch before its energy was exhausted and it disappeared.

However, no matter what, it still left a small wound on the Star Beast’s body, and Scarlet blood was flowing out of the wound. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The high – Level astral beast let out a violent roar. It had almost completely gone berserk.

A human cultivator in the Golden core stage had actually injured it. What was this? It was like a person being bitten by an ant and losing a piece of flesh. It was simply unimaginable.

The high – Level Star Beast, which had entered a berserk state, was emitting a terrifying aura.

It stomped its back hooves and charged at the black light. Then, it curled up its body to protect its vital parts and used the hardest scales on its back to withstand the remaining light. It launched a fierce attack in front of it without any care.

The banging sounds were endless.

Some of them were the sounds of the black light hitting the high – Level star beasts, but most of them were the sounds of the high – Level star beasts wantonly destroying.

In just a few seconds, the high – Level astral beast was hit three times by the sharp light. It also used its most destructive power, sending rocks flying and the formation on the verge of collapse.

Because in this short period of time, one of the nodes of the formation had been attacked continuously and the damage was already very serious.

Xia ruofei’s expression turned ugly. He gritted his teeth and continued to activate the array, launching his most powerful attacks. At the same time, he continued to control the bent Frost Flying sword to attack the high – Level Star Beast.

At this point, it all depended on who could hold on.

If the formation collapsed first, even if the high – Level astral beast was badly injured, Xia ruofei would immediately escape. He would not take any chances.

If the high – Level astral beast couldn’t hold on, it would lose its life.

At this time, the first wound on the high – Level Star beast’s body, which had been pierced by the black light, began to emit a small flame.

...

Seeing this, Xia ruofei’s face revealed a trace of joy.

It seemed that the black light’s most powerful attack was still effective against high level star beasts.

He just didn’t know how much damage these flames could cause to a high level astral beast.

When the high – Level Star Beast saw the flames on its front legs, it couldn’t help but be shocked. At the same time, it also let out a mournful roar.

Xia ruofei’s eyes brightened. It seemed that even high – Level astral beasts had a natural fear of fire. Moreover, fire seemed to do more damage to them than physical attacks.

Soon after, the high – Level astral beast’s back also began to burn.

It screamed in pain, and the speed of its claws slowed down involuntarily.

With the attacks weakened, the pressure on the formation was also greatly reduced.

However, the node of the array, which had been attacked many times, was completely destroyed by such an attack.

A hole appeared in the formation, and the White mist instantly dissipated a lot.

The biggest headache for Xia ruofei was that the damage to this node meant that its ability to trap enemies had been greatly reduced.

...

Sure enough, the high – Level Star Beast continued to screech in pain, and the effect of the array weakened a lot. It actually entered the depths of the array, close to the core of the array, and the violent attack still did not reduce.

The closer he was to the core, the more important nodes he could see.

Xia ruofei saw that the high – Level astral beast was not showing any signs of dying. Instead, it started to attack the more important nodes of the array. He could not help but feel a headache coming on ...
