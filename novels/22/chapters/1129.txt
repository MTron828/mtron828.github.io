Chapter 1130: Buying a siheyuan?(1)

Translator: 549690339

When Xu Qiang and the others saw Xia ruofei walking over, they stopped chatting and greeted him with a smile.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Qiangzi, I’m done choosing. This pair of wood carvings is not bad. I won’t stand on ceremony with you!”

Xu Qiang looked at the wood carving in Xia ruofei’s hand and was stunned.

He still had some impression of this wood carving. It was brought by an antique dealer in Tongzhou last month. After identification, it was basically confirmed that it was an item from the late Qing Dynasty. Moreover, the carving was ordinary and not worth much.

At that time, Xu Qiang had accepted it for 3000 Yuan. Their internal price control table had also noted that if the customer was willing to pay more than 5000 Yuan, the deal could be closed.

For a big shop like Boya house, this pair of wood carvings was very unremarkable and worthless.

Xu Qiang saw that Xia ruofei actually chose such a pair of wood carvings and thought that Xia ruofei was embarrassed to take those precious antiques that were worth hundreds of thousands or even millions. He quickly said,””Young master Xia, this pair of toys isn’t worth much. You should go and take a look at the Jade, calligraphy, and paintings over there! Please don’t stand on ceremony with me!”

Xu Qiang pointed to the area not far away where the more expensive antiques were displayed. The display shelves were of different grades and were equipped with spotlights.

Xia ruofei smiled and shook his head.””No need, this pair of wood carvings is quite good. I’ll take them!”

“Young master Xia, aren’t you making fun of me?” Xu Qiang said with a bitter smile. I said I would thank you properly, but you chose this ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.”Qiangzi, choosing an antique is also based on affinity. I liked this pair of wood carvings the first time I saw them. I’m not trying to save money for you. It’s decided!”

Xu Qiang also knew that people like Xia ruofei and Zhao Yongjun didn’t lack money. Even if the things in the shop were hundreds of thousands or millions of Yuan, they might not be interested. Since Xia ruofei said so, maybe they really liked the wood carving at first sight?

Xu Qiang looked at Zhao Yongjun and saw that he didn’t have any objections, so he said helplessly,””Alright then! Young master Xia, this pair of wood carvings is for you!”

“Thank you, Qiang!” Xia ruofei said happily.

Seeing Xu Qiang’s reaction, Xia ruofei knew that he must not have discovered the mystery of the wood carving. Otherwise, based on the reaction of the spirit painting scroll, this wood carving might be the most precious item in the shop.

Xu Qiang gave Xia ruofei an antique for free. If Xia ruofei chose the most expensive one, it would be unkind of him. However, Xu Qiang did not realize the value of the wood carvings. Xia ruofei’s “discerning eyes” had chosen them, so he could not blame Xia ruofei.

According to the antique trade, this was also a type of “picking up scraps.”

“Young master Xia, I’ll get someone to wrap up this pair of wood carvings!” Xu Qiang said.

“Thank you for your trouble!” Xia ruofei said gently.

Soon, the staff of Boya house wrapped the wood carvings. Xu Qiang had wanted to ask someone to send them to the car, but the wood carvings were not heavy and the parking lot was far away. Xia ruofei declined politely and carried them in his arms.

Xu Qiang had already booked a place for lunch. After Xia ruofei had chosen the things, the group walked out of the old goods market.

After they got their cars from the parking lot, the group drove three cars. Xu Qiang drove with Guo Ruchen in the front, Xia ruofei still sat in song Rui’s Phaeton, and Zhao Yongjun drove his own Porsche Cayenne.

Song Rui glanced at Xia ruofei while driving and said,””RUO Fei, this pair of wood carvings shouldn’t be that simple, right?”

Xia ruofei chuckled,”how would I know?” I just liked it at first sight, so I chose it! This is a free gift from qiangzi, it’s not nice to pick something too expensive!”

“Stop talking nonsense ...” Song Rui said.”Do you think I don’t know you?” Even if you wanted to save money for Xu Qiang, you wouldn’t have made it so obvious! Since you’ve chosen such an unremarkable pair of wood carvings, it means that there must be something special about them!”

“Woof! Your intelligence is improving very quickly!” Xia ruofei joked.

“Hanging out with a cunning person like you ...” Song Rui pursed his lips and said,”the once pure me is becoming more and more scheming ...”

“Go, go, go!” Xia ruofei said in disdain.

Song Rui looked up and laughed,”really!” Didn’t they say ‘the closer you are to Vermillion, the redder you will be’? You’re that ‘pig’!”

“You brat, you dare to scold me in such a roundabout way?” Xia ruofei glanced at song Rui and said,”it seems like you don’t want to know the secret of this pair of wood carvings ...”

“I’m willing to listen if you’re willing to tell me,” song Rui said indifferently.”But I don’t care if you don’t tell me!” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” He had ambition! So ... You don’t care about what I have to do with Song Wei?”

Zhuo Yiyi was song Rui’s Achilles ‘heel. Once Xia ruofei mentioned this, song Rui immediately panicked and quickly put on a flattering smile.”Brother, I was wrong ... I was really wrong ...”

Seeing song Rui’s flattering look, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh and said,””I don’t believe I can’t deal with you ...”

“Yes, yes, yes ...” Song Rui nodded repeatedly.

“Okay, okay ...” Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”I’ll talk to Song Wei about this when I get back!” Don’t look like a traitor, it’s scary!”
