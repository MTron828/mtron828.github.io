2409 A strategy (1)

The plane was bumpy and finally arrived safely in the capital of Ethiopia, Ethiopia.

The return trip was on China National Airlines, which Xia ruofei had booked. This time, they were in a hurry. They only needed to wait for about two hours to transfer flights at the airport in Ethiopia. Hence, Xia ruofei did not leave the airport this time. He rested for a while in the first – Class waiting room set up by China Airlines at the airport in Ethiopia before boarding the plane back home.

It was another ten – hour day and night flight. They boarded at around 7 p.m. Local time in Ethiopia and arrived at Shen Cheng at around 3 p.m. Chinese time.

After returning to the country, Xia ruofei used the identity of ‘Xia Tian’ to buy a ticket for the fastest flight to the capital.

At Seveno’ clock in the evening, Xia ruofei finally returned to the courtyard house in liuhai Lane in the capital city after a day’s travel.

Xia ruofei did not want to expose his whereabouts, so he did not inform Wu Qiang to pick him up.

After he came out of the airport, he took a taxi directly to the vicinity of Wang Fujing. He found a shopping mall with a lot of people, changed back to his original appearance in the bathroom, and changed his clothes. Then, he walked out and stopped a taxi to go home.

Wu Qiang was already used to Xia ruofei going back and forth. He was also very tight – lipped and never asked much.

However, Xia ruofei laughed and said,””I went to a homestay in the countryside with my friends for a few days to change my mind. I feel much more relaxed!”

He said this when he entered the door. Not only did he say it for Wu Qiang to hear, but the few veterans in charge of security in the front yard also heard it.

It was not that Xia ruofei did not trust them, but he was cautious out of habit. Besides, no one knew if the Veterans, including Wu Qiang, would accidentally reveal it. Xia ruofei had told them where he had been these few days so that even if someone wanted to trick them, they would not reveal it.

Furthermore, Xia ruofei did not take any high – speed rail or plane these days. In theory, he should be around the capital. As for the identity of “Xia Tian,” he did not leave the capital directly. In addition, there were so many people entering and leaving the country every day. Under normal circumstances, no one would notice him.

Xia ruofei declined Wu Qiang’s sister – in – Law, Wu Xiujuan, who had prepared supper for him. He said that he was tired and wanted to take a bath and rest.

Wu Qiang, Wu Xiujuan, Xia Xiaolan, and the others naturally left tactfully, leaving Xia ruofei alone in the master’s courtyard in the middle.

After Xia ruofei returned to his room, he locked the door and windows.

He was not in a hurry to take out the spirit map. Even though there were two hundred free laborers in the medium and a basin – sized realm stone waiting for the medium to absorb, Xia ruofei was more concerned about another problem.

That was Liu haojun’s problem.

Now, Xia ruofei had clear evidence that Liu haojun was the mastermind behind the assassination of song Qiming.

Although he didn’t know Liu haojun’s motive for doing so, he was the one who did it. There was no doubt about it.

According to Xia ruofei’s style, he should have killed Liu haojun.

He didn’t even want such a person to be free labor for his spirit map space.

However, it was not difficult to kill Liu haojun without leaving any clues. It was not difficult for Xia ruofei either. He was just hesitating whether to do so.

Killing Liu haojun silently would not maximize the benefits.

More importantly, everyone in the Liu family knew that the conflict between Liu haojun and Xia ruofei was irreconcilable.

With Liu haojun dead, Xia ruofei would be a major suspect regardless of whether there were any clues.

Unless they found the “murderer”, Xia ruofei would definitely be suspected. Even if the Liu family had to rely on Xia ruofei to treat old master Liu and they would not show it for the time being, there would definitely be a thorn in their hearts.

If it was not necessary, Xia ruofei did not want such a powerful family to hate him to the bone.

Although he wasn’t afraid of any external threats, his company was in China. His friends and employees were all in China. The Liu family couldn’t touch him. If they wanted to set some obstacles for his company or even the people close to him, it would be impossible to guard against them.

Xia ruofei furrowed his brows and thought for a while, then let out a long sigh.

In the end, it was because he was not strong enough. If he could really reach the legendary power of flying in the sky, burrowing into the ground, and destroying a city with a wave of his hand, why would he be afraid of a mere secular family?

He killed one person in ten steps and left no trace for a thousand miles. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

If he wanted to settle his grudges like a swordsman, he must first have the strength of a swordsman.

Although Xia ruofei was no longer an ordinary person, he was still at a lower level among the cultivators. Not to mention the state apparatus, even if he was up against a family like the Liu family, it would be easy for them to cause trouble even if they could not threaten his safety.

After much consideration, Xia ruofei decided to listen to elder song’s opinion.

Although he knew that he would have no chance to secretly kill Liu haojun if he told elder song, he still felt that it was better than making a move rashly and causing a lot of trouble.

He also believed that after elder song received this important piece of information, he would handle it well and maximize the benefits.
