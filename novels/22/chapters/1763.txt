Chapter 1764: The groundbreaking ceremony (2)

After Xia ruofei and Xu lang exchanged some pleasantries, he walked towards Shen Zhongliang and du Qinghong, who looked embarrassed.

They had come here with Liu haofan. Although they didn’t know about it beforehand, now that Liu haofan had left them behind and left, they were a little embarrassed.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Old Shen, uncle du, it’s better to meet by chance than to invite each other. Please come to our club’s groundbreaking ceremony!”

Shen Zhongliang and du Qinghong looked at Xia ruofei gratefully. Xia ruofei had helped them out!

Du Qinghong had a relationship with Xia ruofei and the Ling family, so he stood up first and said,””Ruofei, about today’s incident ... Old Shen and I didn’t know about Mr. Liu’s motive beforehand. We thought he was just here to celebrate ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”Uncle du, it’s all in the past now. Besides, both of you have been sticking to your professional ethics and didn’t help Liu haofan distort the truth. We all saw it!”

Then, Xia ruofei said,”the auspicious time is coming, let’s go!” The groundbreaking ceremony is about to begin. ”

“Alright, alright ...”

And so, everyone walked towards the stage together.

The guests and media reporters who had been watching the entire process were secretly cheering.

The reporters, in particular, were born to chase after hot news. Although this matter was mostly not reported, they still felt very excited after seeing it for themselves.

There were fights between rich and powerful families, legendary Fengshui Masters, and young and rich men here. It could simply be shot into a movie with ups and downs.

Although Liu haofan’s incident had happened, the preparations for the groundbreaking ceremony were still in order.

All the construction machinery was in place, and the stage and sound system had been tested. The workers from the construction side who came to attend the ceremony were seated at the back of the venue.

These workers were wearing the same new work clothes and safety hats, looking quite energetic.

The guests and reporters also went to their respective areas and sat down according to the map.

Xu Zixuan had already asked the conference staff to add two more seats for Shen Zhongliang and du Qinghong, which were arranged next to Lu Shengsi and the other mystics.

At 10:19 A. M., The auspicious time arrived. The emcee walked onto the stage and said enthusiastically,””Dear guests and friends, the foundation laying ceremony for the Paradise gathering project will now begin! First of all, let’s invite President Zhao of the peach blossom society to give a speech on stage!”

Although everyone in this small team regarded Xia ruofei as the leader, Xia ruofei would not live in the capital for long. Zhao Yongjun was also born and raised in the capital, so he was familiar with all aspects. Hence, Zhao Yongjun was still in charge of External Affairs.

Zhao Yongjun, who was in a suit with a flower on his chest, stood up and tidied his suit. He then walked up the stage with a confident smile.

“Dear elders, friends, media reporters, and representatives of the construction party, Hello!” Zhao Yongjun held the microphone and said with a smile,”first, on behalf of Hengrui Corporation, I would like to welcome everyone to today’s groundbreaking ceremony!”

After a round of applause, Zhao Yongjun continued,””Our Paradise club’s project is a comprehensive project that combines leisure, entertainment, dining, sports, fitness, and other functions into one. Everyone has obtained the initial blueprint, and the land under everyone’s feet will realize that blueprint in the next few months to a year. When the time comes, there will be mini – golf courses, indoor permanent pools, professional gyms, branded restaurants ...”

Zhao Yongjun spoke with confidence and assurance on stage, introducing the concept and blueprint of the entire paradise gathering project to everyone. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

This was also the meaning of the question. They had invited so many friends in the circle and media reporters today, wasn’t it to promote it well?

As Zhao Yongjun spoke, he glanced at the assistant below the stage. It was not until the assistant raised three fingers to signal to him that he nodded slightly.

Zhao Yongjun said,”that’s the general situation of the Paradise gathering project. I’m here on behalf of the company. After our project is completed, we will use a membership system. I also sincerely invite all the good friends here to apply for membership cards. I believe that we will definitely give you a service that is worth the money!”

Zhao Yongjun silently calculated the time and said,””As everyone has seen, there’s a small incident. I would like to make it clear that the so – called Yin gathering place that Liu haofan mentioned today, as well as the rumors on the internet some time ago, are all nonsense! Today, we’ve even specially invited the seniors from the field of metaphysics to refute these ridiculous rumors. Because the auspicious time is coming, let’s first complete the groundbreaking ceremony. After the ceremony, we’ll invite the seniors from the field of metaphysics to analyze the Feng Shui situation on this land for us!”

Then, Zhao Yongjun looked at the assistant below the stage. The assistant nodded, so he said,””That’s all I want to say. Thank you, everyone!”

Because the estimated auspicious time was 10:33 A. M., When Zhao Yongjun was speaking on stage, there were people below the stage counting the time and reminding him.

After Zhao Yongjun left the stage, the emcee walked to the center of the stage and said enthusiastically,””Next up, the foundation laying ceremony of the peach blossom society will begin immediately. First, let’s invite our foundational guests!”

Xia ruofei, Zhao Yongjun, brother song Rui, and Ling Qingxue all stood up and walked out. In addition, there was Hong Kong Feng Shui Master Xu lang, the Vice President of the Chinese Xuanxuan society, Lu Shengsi, and a Vice President of the construction company. In addition to a few more important guests, there were a total of 15 or 16 people.

Below the stage, in an open space in front of everyone’s seats, there was a custom – made foundation stone that had been prepared in advance. On it were engraved the words “paradise gathering”,”foundation stone”, and there was even a red silk ribbon and silk flower tied to the foundation stone.

When the foundational guest walked up, the hostess handed out safety helmets and red silk shovels and shovels to everyone. Of course, the significance of the safety helmets was more symbolic than the actual effect.

When the time was about to reach 10:33, the emcee said loudly,””The groundbreaking ceremony begins! Guests, please cultivate the soil for the foundation stone! Fire the gun salute!”

Amidst the lively firecrackers and drum beats, Zhao Yongjun and the others waved their shovels and shoveled the soil into the dug pit. It was exactly 10:33.

With the warm applause, the symbolic groundbreaking ceremony was completed.

The guests handed their shovels to the hostess, wiped their hands with wet towels, and returned to their seats.

Normally, the groundbreaking ceremony would have ended here, and the guests would have been able to interact with each other and visit the place. Actually, there wasn’t much to see. The scenery here was not bad, but the problem was that nothing was built here. It was just a piece of barren land.

Then, if the reporters were not satisfied with the news, they would interview Zhao Yongjun and the others to get more material.

In other words, the official event was basically over.

However, before the emcee could announce the end of the groundbreaking ceremony, Xu lang, who had just sat down, stood up and signaled to the emcee that he had something to say.

The emcee was also quite experienced, so he wasn’t stunned by this sudden small situation. He immediately reacted and said with a smile,””Next, let’s welcome the famous Fengshui master of Hong Kong, Mr. Xu lang, with a round of applause!”

This was completely out of their plan. Zhao Yongjun couldn’t help but be stunned. He didn’t know what Xu Lang’s purpose was.

The 80 – year – old Xu lang walked onto the stage with strong steps and took the microphone from the emcee. The old man was very thin and did not look very impressive, but he had a strong aura. He first looked at the guests below the stage and waited for everyone to quiet down before he put the microphone to his mouth.

Xu lang smiled and said,”just now, Mr. Zhao mentioned the Feng Shui problem of this land. I heard that there were some rumors about this land.” I came here earlier today and have walked around this place. I have a better understanding of the Feng Shui situation here, so I would like to share my judgment with everyone!”
