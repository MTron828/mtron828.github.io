“Sister che, take care!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

……

At the front desk of the company on the 11th floor of the Tao Yuan building.

Xiao Li, the clerk in charge of the reception, picked up a phone call and couldn’t help but look at Zhu zhihang and the others with a slightly embarrassed look on her face. However, she quickly calmed down and said,””County Head Zhu, I’m sorry! The chairman is in a high – Level meeting and may not have time to receive the leaders ...”

Shi Qingyuan, the director of the government office who came with Zhu zhihang, heard this and his face suddenly sank. He said,””What? Did you make it clear that the person who came to visit director Xia today is County Head Zhu?”

“I’ve given a detailed report, but that’s the Board of Directors ‘reply,” said Xiao Li.”Leaders, I’m really sorry ...”

Xiao Li was on the verge of tears. She was just a little girl who had just graduated from Junior College. Facing Zhu zhihang, Shi Qingyuan, and the other powerful leaders, she was already under a lot of pressure. When Shi Qingyuan glared at her, her little heart could not help but beat faster.

“Isn’t he too arrogant?” Shi Qingyuan said angrily.

Zhu zhihang’s face also darkened slightly, but he quickly returned to normal. He waved his hand to stop Shi Qingyuan.

It wasn’t a good thing to show off in front of a young receptionist. Zhu zhihang also knew that it was useless to say so much to this little girl. She was just a Messenger and could not decide anything at all.

Zhu zhihang thought for a while and said to Xiao Li with a pleasant expression,””Young comrade, when will President Xia’s meeting end?”

“I really don’t know about this, County Head Zhu,” said Xiao Li. I asked just now, but the Board of Directors said that the time is not easy to grasp. This meeting is very important and it concerns the company’s development strategy ...”

In fact, these words were added by Zhou Yu himself. The purpose was to show that Xia ruofei was indeed unable to leave because of a very important matter, so as to reduce the unhappiness in the hearts of Zhu zhihang and the others as much as possible.

However, the speaker had no intention, but the listener paid attention.

Zhu zhihang’s face changed slightly. He thought to himself,”the company’s development strategy? Could it be that he wanted to choose the location for the Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory branch? With the terrifying ability of the Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory to make money, building a new branch factory was indeed a big problem for the company’s development strategy.

He was even more anxious because up until now, the Paradise Corporation had yet to inspect Changping County. If they decided on the location now, it went without saying that it would definitely have nothing to do with Changping County.

However, no matter how anxious he was, Zhu zhihang couldn’t do anything. He couldn’t just barge in!

He thought about it and felt that he could not leave no matter what. He had to wait here. No matter how long he waited, he had to see Xia ruofei as soon as possible. Regardless of whether they had decided on the location, he had to work hard.

Right now, Changping County was in a state of turmoil. The negative impact caused by Liu haojun’s problem was too great. The Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory project was like a life – saving straw that had to be seized no matter what.

Once this project is ruined, then the life – saving straw will become a deadly poison. The peach blossom company initially had its eyes on Changping County, so why did it turn to invest in other areas? It must be because the investment environment in your Changping County is too bad!

Thinking of this, Zhu zhihang said with a pleasant expression,””Little comrade, in that case, can we wait here for President Xia to finish his meeting? Please report that we’re waiting here and hope that President Xia will find time to meet us after the meeting. We have very important things to discuss with him. ”

Xiao Li also heaved a sigh of relief. She was really afraid that Zhu zhihang and the others would be furious.

“Alright!” She quickly replied. County Head Zhu, please take a rest here! I’ll contact the Board of Directors immediately!”

Xiao Li led Zhu zhihang and the others to the reception room at the door and served them hot tea. Then, he returned to the front desk and called Zhou Yu with the landline.

……

On the 15th floor, in the chairman’s office.

After Xia ruofei heard Zhou Yu’s report, he looked interested and said,””Since they’re willing to wait, then let them wait!”

At this point, Xia ruofei raised his hand and looked at his watch. After a moment of silence, he said,””If they haven’t left after an hour, go downstairs and pick them up!”

Zhou Yu was slightly stunned. At the company, they got off work at 12 o’ clock, had an hour of lunch, and then continued to work at 13 O’ clock. It was already 10:30 in the morning. An hour later, it would be 11:30. Including the time it took for the elevator to go up and down, Xia ruofei had less than half an hour left for them!

Although her mind was spinning, Zhou Yu was not dazed for too long this time. She quickly nodded and said,”I understand, Chairman!”

She knew that it was impossible for her to understand her boss’s intention, but she was determined to carry out the order.

……

In the reception room on the 11th floor.

As time went by, Zhu zhihang sat on the sofa with his eyes closed, like an old monk in meditation.

On the other hand, the director of the government office, Shi Qingyuan, seemed a little anxious. He kept pacing back and forth in the reception room, raising his hand to check his watch every few minutes.

“I say ... This paradise Corporation is too arrogant!” Shi Qingyuan said to the new Secretary, Luo Jinxian, who came with Zhu zhihang,”Mayor Zhu came here personally. Even if there’s something important, can’t you just put it aside? It’s been almost half an hour, and there’s still no movement!”

Luo Jinxian had always been a staff member of the government office and an old subordinate of Shi Qingyuan. This time, he was working beside Zhu zhihang to replace Jin Yuan, who had been demoted to be a village cadre. It could be said to be a rare opportunity in his life, so he had been cautious with his words and actions.

On such an occasion, County Head Zhu did not say anything. As subordinates, it was inappropriate for them to say anything. As an old comrade, it was fine for Shi Qingyuan to occasionally complain. If Luo Jinxian went along with him, he would definitely be called “immature.”

So, Luo Jinxian just smiled at Shi Qingyuan and said,””Director Shi, why don’t you take a seat and drink some water ...”

Half an hour, 40 minutes ...

As time went by, Zhu zhihang’s anxiety became more and more intense. He couldn’t show it on his face, or he would lose his dignity as a superior in front of his subordinates.

I don’t know when this kind of waiting will end ... Zhu zhihang thought anxiously.

He could even imagine Xia ruofei and the high ranking officials in the meeting room of the Paradise pharmaceutical factory discussing the location of the branch factory. He became even more anxious.

Finally, at around 11:30, the door of the reception room was pushed open, and a girl in black – rimmed glasses and business attire walked in.

“Are you county Head Zhu?”

Zhu zhihang immediately opened his eyes and said,””I am!”

“Hello, County Head Zhu! I’m Chairman Xia’s assistant, Zhou Yu. I’m sorry to have kept you waiting!” Zhou Yu smiled and said,”the chairman has finished his meeting. He asked me to come and take you upstairs!”

That’s great! Zhu zhihang shouted in his heart.

On the surface, he was still very calm. He said very politely,””Alright, thank you for your trouble, assistant Zhou!”

Zhou Yu took Zhu zhihang and the others to the 15th floor by elevator.

Zhou Yu knocked on the door of the chairman’s office, then pushed the door open, turned sideways, and said,””County Head Zhu, leaders, please come in!”

Zhu zhihang and the others walked into Xia ruofei’s huge office. Looking at the spacious and luxurious office, Zhu zhihang could not help but secretly click his tongue.

There was still some distance from the entrance of the office to Xia ruofei’s desk in front of the floor – to – Ceiling window. Xia ruofei had been sitting in his seat and reading the documents in his hand. When Zhu zhihang and the others were almost at the desk, he seemed to have just realized it. He quickly put down the documents in his hand, stood up, and walked out.

Xia ruofei walked quickly to Zhu zhihang and said,””County Head Zhu, I’m sorry! There are too many things on hand, I’ve neglected you!”
