2783 The return of the ultimate weapon_2

Zhou leiyun had always been following Xia ruofei’s Weibo and Tieba. He was more familiar with Xia ruofei’s situation. All of Xia ruofei’s fans knew that Ling Qingxue was Xia ruofei’s girlfriend, so Zhou leiyun naturally knew about this situation.

However, since Xia ruofei had only said that he was his friend, Zhou leiyun would not be so silly as to ask further.

As for Song Wei’s identity, he was even more clear about Wanwan’s nephew Zhou Yuan who tried to be a Toad lusting after a Swan’s meat. He was so shocked that he broke out in a cold sweat. In the end, it was Zhao Yongjun who helped to calm the matter down.

Of course, Zhou leiyun had profited from his misfortune. He had gotten to know Xia ruofei because of this incident and had even asked him to invest in a Football Club. The relationship between the two had clearly become closer.

No matter what, Zhou leiyun had heard of Song Wei’s name like thunder.

He had also noticed that Xia ruofei seemed to have placed Song Wei and Ling Qingxue on the same level. His heart trembled.

However, the experienced Zhou leiyun would not show it. He only greeted the two of them warmly and led them to the parking lot.

Zhou leiyun had made a reservation for Xia ruofei at the Grand Central Hotel where he had stayed the last time. He had asked Jiang Xiaochen to book two more luxury suites, which were connected to the original one.

The Grand Central Hotel did not have a Presidential Suite. The luxury suite was already the highest standard room in the hotel.

As he did not dare to guess the relationship between Xia ruofei and the other two, Zhou leiyun simply booked three rooms. As for how many rooms they would be using at night, he did not need to care. After all, the cost of one or two more rooms was not even a drop in the ocean to Zhou leiyun.

In reality, Zhou leiyun’s small Manor in the rich district of Barcelona was more luxurious and comfortable. However, that was his home after all, and he was worried that Xia ruofei would not be used to living in someone else’s house. Furthermore, Xia ruofei had brought two female companions, which made it even more inconvenient.

After receiving their room cards, everyone took the elevator up.

After Song Wei and Ling Qingxue reached the floor of their rooms, they each returned to their own rooms and flew for more than ten hours. They were also eager to take a shower, change their clothes, and dress up.

Zhou leiyun, Jiang Xiaochen, and Wu Lei accompanied Xia ruofei to his room.

Considering Xia ruofei’s fatigue from the long journey, the three of them did not stay for long. After chatting for a while, they got up and left.

Zhou leiyun had even prepared a welcome dinner for Xia ruofei. At that time, they would naturally be able to have an in – depth exchange.

Xia ruofei politely stood up and sent the three of them out the door.

“That’s right, Lei Zi, are you still staying in this hotel?”he suddenly asked.

“Brother Xia, I’ve already moved out!” Wu Lei said with a smile. My wife and children are already here. I’ve rented a house near the club. ”

“Sure!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you don’t have to worry about anything now!”

“Yup!” Wu Lei said,”in order to support my career, Xiaobei gave up on her own career development. This time, she even came to a foreign country for me ...”

“Just treat your wife better in the future!” Xia ruofei patted Wu Lei’s shoulder and said with a smile,”use your performance at the court to repay your family!”

“I know, brother Xia! I will!” Wu Lei said firmly.

Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”chief Zhou, did you invite Lei Zi’s family and children for dinner?” Let’s get them to come over and have some fun!”

“We’ve already invited them!”Zhou leiyun quickly said.

Wu Lei was stunned for a moment, but he quickly nodded and said,””They’ll be coming to participate too!”

In fact, Zhou leiyun did not invite Wu Lei’s wife and children at the beginning. After all, this was a more formal business dinner, not a team gathering. However, Wu Lei and Xia ruofei had a good personal relationship. Besides, Xia ruofei had brought a female companion with him this time. It was more appropriate to let Wu Lei’s wife come.

Furthermore, they were in a foreign country. As fellow Chinese, they would naturally feel very close to each other. It was reasonable to invite them to attend the banquet together.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”sure!” Then I’ll take a shower and rest first, see you tonight!”

“President Xia, you must be tired from the journey. Take a good rest.” Zhou leiyun quickly said,”I’ll come up to invite you when the banquet is about to start.”

Xia ruofei nodded and waved at Zhou leiyun and the other two. Then, he turned around and returned to his room.

Zhou leiyun heaved a sigh of relief. As he walked towards the elevator with Jiang Xiaochen and Wu Lei, he patted Wu Lei’s shoulder and said,””Wu Lei, thank you for helping me out! Otherwise, it would be a little awkward ...”

He was referring to Xia ruofei’s invitation to Wu Lei’s wife and child.

“You’re too kind, general manager Zhou,”Wu Lei said with a smile.

Zhou leiyun then said to Jiang Xiaochen,”Xiaochen, quickly send a car to send Wu Lei back. Then, take them to buy a set of high – end formal clothes and send them to the hotel!” There’s still more than three hours, you better hurry!”

“Alright, director Zhou!” Jiang Xiaochen quickly said, then turned to Wu Lei.”Wu Lei, let’s go!”

“General manager Zhou, there’s no need to buy clothes! “There’s formal wear at home ...” Wu Lei quickly said.

“Let’s just buy a set! Dressing well also shows how much you value President Xia!” Zhou leiyun smiled and explained,”don’t misunderstand! I’m not saying that your family’s clothes are inappropriate, but ... How should I put it! It’s better to get a professional to help you match it for a formal banquet. ” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“It’s okay, I understand ...” Wu Lei smiled and said,”thank you, general manager Zhou.”

Naturally, Wu Lei did not lack money to buy clothes, but he still had to be polite. After all, Zhou leiyun had good intentions.

After the elevator reached the first floor, Jiang Xiaochen hurriedly left the hotel with Wu Lei, while Zhou leiyun took another car and returned to his small Manor in the wealthy district of Barcelona.

Xia ruofei naturally did not know that his casual words had caused Zhou leiyun and Jiang Xiaochen to be so busy. After his shower, he changed into soft and comfortable home clothes and lay on the bed to rest for a while. When it was almost time for dinner, he got up to wash up and then changed into a casual suit.

Then, he went to Song Wei and Ling Qingxue’s room and called them over.

Ling Qingxue and Song Wei really only used one room. It would seem more intimate if they were willing to stay together.

Of course, it was hard to say if they had any other thoughts, such as mutual supervision and so on.

The three of them chatted in Xia ruofei’s room for a while before Zhou leiyun personally came up to invite them to a banquet.

Hence, Xia ruofei and the other two followed Zhou leiyun to the restaurant in the building attached to the hotel.

Zhou leiyun had booked a large private room. There were not many people attending the banquet. Zhou leiyun did not invite the other club’s higher – ups, only Jiang Xiaochen and the first team’s head coach, Ruby. Furthermore, as Xia ruofei had brought a female companion and specifically invited Wu Lei’s family, he had asked Ruby to bring his wife, while Jiang Xiaochen brought his own girlfriend.

Zhou leiyun’s wife had not come to Spain, so he was all alone today.

When Xia ruofei and his team appeared in the room, everyone stood up and applauded, especially the head coach Ruby, who looked very excited.

When he learned that Xia ruofei had agreed to play for the club in the Catalan derby against Barcelona, he was so excited that he almost jumped up.

With Xia ruofei’s participation, he had more confidence in this competition.

Although the Chinese fans nicknamed Wu Lei “nuclear 7” because Wu Lei always wore the number 7 jersey when he played in China, this nickname was also a kind of affirmation of Wu Lei’s attack power. However, in Ruby’s mind, there was no doubt that Xia ruofei was his “nuclear weapon”. With this surprise, he might bring a lot of “surprises” to bar?a!

“Thank you, everyone!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”please take a seat!”

...

Then, Xia ruofei repeated Yingluo’s name in Spanish. He was also considering Ruby and his wife’s feelings.

Then, Xia ruofei walked to the main seat beside Zhou leiyun and sat down.
