2184 Bai Qingqing (2)

“I don’t think you have a conscience ...” The White realmfox muttered.

However, in the presence of a human ... No, the civet had no choice but to lower its head. In the end, it still accepted Xia ruofei’s explanation and said unwillingly,””That will depend on your performance next time! If the distribution is unfair, then we’ll go our separate ways! There’s no follow – up cooperation!”

“Alright, alright, alright!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”by the way, do you have a name? I can’t just keep calling you ‘little guy’, can I?”

“Name? I really don’t have any!” The White realmfox tilted its head and said,”I’ll have to think about this ...”

“What are you thinking? I think little white is a good name!” Xia ruofei laughed and then scratched his head.”That doesn’t seem very appropriate! You’re no longer pure white, how about ...... You’re called Xiao Jin?”

“Can you not be so old – fashioned!” “I’m warning you!” The white fox said with a look of disgust. You’re not allowed to call me little white or little gold! I’m not called that! I have to think of my own name!”

“Alright, alright, alright! You can take it for yourself!” Xia ruofei said,”let’s see how good you can be! Then I won’t talk to you anymore! I’m going to cook!”

“Wait! I’ve thought it through!” The White realm Fox cried out,”isn’t that puppet of yours called Xia Qing? From now on, I’ll be called Bai Qingqing! That’s a nice name ...”

Xia ruofei almost burst out laughing. Luckily, he managed to hold it in. Otherwise, Ling Qingxue would have heard him again.

He held back his laughter and said,’Bai Qingqing? Isn’t this name too girly?”

“Mother, your head!” The White realmfox was a little angry.”I’ve decided. This is my name!” You’re not allowed to randomly name me, do you hear me?”

“Good, good, good! Since you like the girly style, then I’ll call you Bai Qingqing. I have no objections!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”then you can stay by yourself for a while! It’s fine to sleep, it’s fine to cultivate, just don’t cause any destruction in my space! I’m going to cook ...”

“I despise you. You actually eat such low – end food!” The boundary Fox Bai Qingqing waved its forelimbs upwards, showing a disdainful look.

“I’m looking down on you! He’s actually eating rocks!” Xia ruofei retorted.

Then, without waiting for Bai Qingqing’s counterattack, he sealed off the connection between the spirit map space and the outside world and began to focus on preparing lunch.

In a short while, a sumptuous and delicious lunch was prepared.

In addition to the steamed Chinese perch, there were three dishes and a soup, which was more than enough for two people.

Xia ruofei brought the soup into the dining room and said,””Qingxue, it’s time to eat! Don’t look at it for now, go wash your hands, and bring out two bowls of rice!”

“I know!” Ling Qingxue answered crisply. She turned off the TV, stood up, and walked to the kitchen.

Xia ruofei brought out all the dishes, and the last one on the table was the plate of steamed Chinese perch.

Ling Qingxue put down her bowl and sniffed. She smiled and said,””It smells so good! I really miss the taste of Chinese perch!”

“Then eat more!” Xia ruofei pinched Ling Qingxue’s tender cheeks affectionately and said,”this whole strip is yours!”

“You’re so good to me!” Ling Qingxue also enjoyed Xia ruofei’s love. She smiled sweetly at Xia ruofei and said,”don’t forget about the bet this weekend! When I think about being able to eat Chinese perch every day, my mood immediately brightens up!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”wife, militarist Yun: He planned for defeat before he won! Have you ever thought about what would happen if you lose?”

“There’s no “what if”!” Ling Qingxue said with certainty,”this kind of thing is impossible! Unless the sea is yours!”

Xia ruofei laughed in his heart,”I’m sorry, my wife. My house is full of fish ...”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said,”since you’re so confident, we’ll see who’s stronger this weekend!” Wife, let’s eat! Let’s eat!”

Since Ling Qingxue had to go to the company in the afternoon, the two of them didn’t drink in the afternoon.

However, the two of them enjoyed the food that Xia ruofei had personally cooked while chatting about topics that they were both interested in. Even without the wine, they felt quite good.

After the meal, Ling Qingxue rolled up her sleeves and said,””Ruofei, you’ve worked hard cooking! I’ll clean up the dishes ...”

Xia ruofei looked at Ling Qingxue with a burning gaze and said,””Wife, there’s no hurry to wash the dishes ... We haven’t seen each other for more than ten days. You know ... The sea is vast, and I’ve been alone at sea for more than ten days. I’m almost sick from holding it in!”

Ling Qingxue’s fair face couldn’t help but turn red. Then, she burst out laughing and said,””Why is your mind filled with unhealthy thoughts? It’s broad daylight ...”

Xia ruofei had already reached Ling Qingxue’s back in one step. He hugged her slender waist from behind, put his mouth close to her ear, and said,””How is this an unhealthy way of thinking? The ancestors had said that food and sex were part of it! And this was the natural instinct of Human Reproduction, okay? If no one ate human food, then wouldn’t humans go extinct?”

“You’re the only one with so much twisted logic!” Ling Qingxue laughed as she twisted her body.” Don’t blow on my neck, it’s itchy ...”

The two of them had been together for a long time. Naturally, Xia ruofei knew Ling Qingxue’s sensitive areas like the back of his hand. After a while, Ling Qingxue gave up on being reserved and only said weakly,””Ruofei, let’s go to the bedroom ...”

“This is good!” Xia ruofei kissed Ling Qingxue as he mumbled.

Soon, the two of them fell onto the sofa in the living room, hugging each other ...

After more than an hour, Ling Qingxue walked out of the villa accompanied by Xia ruofei.

Her hair was still a little messy, and her face was flushed. When she walked, she felt that her steps were a little light, and her legs were weak.

This was because Ling Qingxue had to return to the company before 2:30 pm, so Xia ruofei had held back. If he had been allowed to do as he pleased, Ling Qingxue would probably not be able to get out of bed for a long time.

She sat in the passenger seat of the Knight XV off – Road vehicle and took out her makeup mirror to fix her makeup. She glared at Xia ruofei, who was grinning evilly, and said,””You still have the nerve to laugh? It’s all your fault!”

Xia ruofei quickly started the car and turned to Ling Qingxue with a smile.””My wife! Just now, you kept saying ‘so comfortable’ and ‘quick’...”

“Hey! You’re still talking!” Ling Qingxue’s face turned red in embarrassment. She couldn’t help but hit Xia ruofei. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I won’t say it, okay?” Women are really unreasonable ...”

“It’s all your fault anyway!” Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”big pervert! Big Bad guy! Big stinky pig!”

Xia ruofei accepted all the titles that Ling Qingxue gave him. He smiled and said,””Wife, do you want to come to my place for dinner tonight? I’ll make you another Chinese perch! Also, we can continue to discuss the topic that we didn’t finish this afternoon!”

“What topic?” Ling Qingxue asked as she touched up her makeup.

“It’s an important topic regarding Human Reproduction!” Xia ruofei chuckled.

“You ...” Ling Qingxue said angrily,”no!”

“We can even cultivate together!” Xia ruofei continued to tempt him.”You’re really not going?”

Ling Qingxue hesitated for a moment before saying,””I won’t be going over tonight. I’ve already promised my dad that I’ll have dinner with him today! And ... I’m going out to sea with you this weekend, so I have to tell him in advance!”

Xia ruofei knew that Ling Qingxue was not coming out tonight. He said regretfully,””Alright then! Then let’s meet again tomorrow!”

He drove Ling Qingxue back to the lingji F & B headquarters, and then, instead of going back to the company in the afternoon, he drove straight back to the jiangbin villa.

After parking the car, Xia ruofei went straight to the bedroom upstairs, locked the doors and windows, closed the curtains, took out the scroll, and entered the spirit map space with a thought.
