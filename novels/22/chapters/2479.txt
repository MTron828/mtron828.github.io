Translator: 5496903Xia ruofei personally went to get a bottle of Semillon white wine and opened it. This was naturally the wine he had brewed in the space. Although the wine from West Winery was not as well – known as Lafite and Matthus, this bottle of Semillon had made Zhou leiyun, who had tasted countless famous wines, praise it endlessly.

This was not just a courtesy. Zhou leiyun was truly amazed by the unique taste of this bottle of Semillon. He could not help but ask Xia ruofei about this bottle of wine.

When Zhou leiyun found out that Xia ruofei had bought these from a winery in Australia, he immediately expressed his desire to order a batch. Even though Xia ruofei had said that the bottle he had just opened was a small amount of premium quality and that the quality of the Semillon sold by the West Winery was not that high, Zhou leiyun still did not change his mind and insisted on placing an order.

Xia ruofei had no choice but to give Zhou leiyun the contact information of West Winery.

After signing the contract, the busy Zhou leiyun left. Before he left, he once again sent an invitation to Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei also said that if time allowed, he would definitely go to Spain before Wu Lei’s signing ceremony. After all, there were some procedures to be completed for the change of shares.

After Zhou leiyun left, Xia ruofei didn’t stay in Taoyuan club for long. He found Zhao Yongjun and the others who were still playing golf at the mini golf course and bade them farewell as he prepared to return to the courtyard house. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Ling Qingxue said,”ruofei, you can go back first!” It’ll be very busy at the private restaurant at night, so I have to help senior brother Wu keep an eye on it. ”

The Ling’s private KITCHEN IN PARADISE Club was the first step for Ling’s restaurant to enter the northern market. Ling Xiaotian and Ling Qingxue both placed a lot of importance on it. The members of Paradise Club were all outstanding people in the upper – Class circle of the capital city. They could be said to be rich and Noble. If they could create a good reputation here, it would have a very positive effect on the layout of Ling’s restaurant in the northern market.

It was the first day of business, and they had already received a lot of reservations, so Ling Qingxue was a little worried and wanted to keep an eye on it personally. After a period of operation, everything would be on the right track, and the staff would gradually adapt. She would not need to be so tired then.

Xia ruofei nodded and agreed. When I get home, I’ll ask Wu Qiang to drive the car over and wait for you. I’ll pick you up then. ”

Zhao Yongjun smiled and said,”ruofei, there’s no need to go through so much trouble!” Did the club still lack cars? Don’t worry, sister – in – Law won’t suffer here. No matter how late it is, we’ll arrange a car to send her back!”

“That’s right!”Song Rui also said. You can just go!”

“That works too!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”brother Zhao, Xiao Rui, please take care of Qingxue here. If anything happens, call me immediately.”

Xia ruofei was mainly worried that a beauty like Ling Qingxue would attract a lot of men. After all, those who could spend money in the Paradise Club were definitely not weak. Ling Qingxue might not be able to handle it.

Zhao Yongjun laughed and said,”don’t worry!” Who would dare to cause trouble in the peach blossom Association?”

“Unless he’s tired of living!” Song Rui immediately added.

“That’s true. ” Xia ruofei nodded.

“Ruofei, I’ll stay here with Qingxue ...” Song Wei said.

Ling Qingxue immediately replied,”Wei Wei, I don’t need your company!” You can go back with RUO Fei! I might be working late ...”

As soon as Ling Qingxue finished speaking, Zhao Yongjun, song Rui, and Zhuo Yiyi’s gazes fell on Xia ruofei and Song Wei, all of them looking thoughtful.

Xia ruofei quickly said,”don’t get the wrong idea!” Weiwei came over with Qingxue. Her luggage is still at my house! Before she goes back to school, she has to come to my place first!”

“I understand ... I understand ...” Song Rui said with a smile. He looked at Xia ruofei with a hint of mockery and ... Deep envy.

Xia ruofei felt a little guilty. He knew that it would only make things worse if he tried to explain. It would be easier to avoid suspicion if he remained calm. After all, Ling Qingxue, his girlfriend, was also present!

Hence, Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,””I can’t be bothered to talk to you people with impure thoughts! I’m leaving! Wei Wei, come back with me! Didn’t you say that you like the environment of siheyuan? Then stay for a few more days before going to school!”

After that, Xia ruofei glanced at song Rui and pretended to be nonchalant.

Song Rui and Zhuo Yiyi looked at each other. They were a little shaken. Actually, they could feel that Song Wei was looking at Xia ruofei with an unusual gaze. As Song Wei’s best friend, Zhuo Yiyi knew Song Wei quite well, so she was more sensitive. However, Xia ruofei looked as if he had a clear conscience. Most importantly, Ling Qingxue was also present. After thinking about it, he felt that his guess was too ridiculous.

Song Wei’s heart was beating like a deer in the headlights. She was so embarrassed that she did not even dare to look at everyone. After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, she made up her mind and quickly nodded her head. Then, she followed Xia ruofei and left.

Song Rui looked at their backs and then at Ling Qingxue. He shrugged and said,””Brother Zhao, let’s continue! I’ve only won two rounds, it’s not enough!”

Zhao Yongjun laughed and scolded,”you lost to ruofei by a large margin, and now you’re trying to get back your presence on me!” This bro is not going to serve you! Let’s go, let’s go, I’m going to take a look at the club too!”
