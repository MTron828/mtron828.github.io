1964 Present (1)

The wealthy people who were chatting looked over at the same time and came out with MA Xiong. Xia ruofei also walked over and said,””I’m really sorry to make all the seniors wait for me!”

“We just arrived!” MA Xiong laughed heartily.

“Xia Sheng, long time no see!” Guo Hongjiang was the first to greet Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei had helped him cure the Asian star, and he had always been very grateful to him. Although he had also given Xia ruofei a flat in the Repulse Bay, in his opinion, how could a house compare to his beloved horse?

Putting aside the fact that the value of an Asian star far exceeded the house that Guo Hongjiang had given him, he had put so much effort into the Asian star in terms of feelings. At that time, when the injury of a broken leg could only be euthanized, Xia ruofei had saved the Asian star. The feeling of being saved from death was like a roller coaster.

What made Guo Hongjiang even more surprised was that after the Star of Asia recovered from his injury, not only did it not affect his speed, but his performance was even better than before. Even the Star of Asia’s jockmaster was in disbelief.

Because the Star of Asia had passed the period of rapid growth, it was basically fixed. Maybe the cavalrymen and the horses had better chemistry and the performance could be improved a little, but the situation of the performance being improved by a large margin after a broken leg injury was completely beyond their understanding.

Hence, Guo Hongjiang was not only grateful to Xia ruofei, but also had an inexplicable sense of respect.

“Director Guo, how’s the Asian star?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

Guo Hongjiang was excited at the mention of the Star of Asia. He said,””Thanks to you, the Asian star is doing very well. He’s already a big star in Hong Kong’s horse racing circle!”

As Guo Hongjiang had promised Xia ruofei to keep his treatment of the Star of Asia a secret, he had deliberately made it vague.

Zheng Nian also asked curiously,”Xia Sheng likes horse racing too?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”haha!” Chairman Zheng, I don’t know anything about horse racing! It was director Guo and old master Ma who brought me to the race track for the first time in my life! But horse racing is indeed very exciting!”

“Xia Sheng, Chairman Zheng is also a member of the horse race,” Guo Hongjiang said.”He has a deep understanding of horse racing!”

“Oh, really? If there’s a chance, I’ll have to ask you for advice, Chairman Zheng!” Xia ruofei smiled.

After exchanging a few pleasantries with them, Xia ruofei turned to Ma Zhiming and his wife. He smiled at Huan Huan and said,”Huanhuan! Come to uncle Xia’s side!”

When Xia ruofei entered the house, Huanhuan had wanted to run over. However, Tian Huixin had told her in a small voice that uncle Xia was in the middle of a serious discussion with her grandfathers and that she should not disturb them. Thus, she had held back.

Now that she heard Xia ruofei calling her, Huan Huan immediately ran over happily and threw herself into Xia ruofei’s arms. She was very intimate with him.

Xia ruofei also liked little Huanhuan very much. He carried her easily with one hand.

He then handed the paper bag to Feng Jing and said,””CEO Feng, there are two bottles of wine in there. I gave them to Chairman MA. Please help me take them out!”

“Alright!” Feng Rao immediately took out the two bottles of expensive rotten wine from the paper bag.

MA Xiong and the rest looked at it curiously. MA Xiong knew that Xia ruofei would definitely take out something good so he asked,””Xia Sheng, what about this wine?”

“I have a winery in Australia. This is a specially brewed noble rot sweet wine. The alcohol content isn’t very high, but the sweetness is not bad. The taste is also very special. I brought it for you to try!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Then what are we waiting for? Our old friends are all here today, so let’s just open it!” MA Xiong said happily,”the wine that Xia Sheng brought will definitely be good! You guys are in for a treat today!”

Guo Hongjiang and the others also laughed in agreement, expressing their anticipation for the two bottles of wine.

In fact, other than MA Xiong and Guo Hongjiang, Zheng jianian and the others were more polite. With their wealth, basically, as long as it was something that could be bought with money, it was not rare in their eyes. What kind of good wine had they not tried before? The two bottles of wine looked very new, so they didn’t have much expectations.

Ma Zhiming immediately signaled the waiter in the private room to open the two bottles of wine.

Xia ruofei scanned the room and realized that only Guo Hongjiang and Zheng jianian had brought their wives to the banquet. He had prepared six portions of jaded skin ointment. Including Tian Huixin, Feng Jing, Dong Yun, and Liu Qian, there were exactly six ladies.

“Boss Feng, there are still six sets of jaded skin ointment in the bag. I was worried that I didn’t bring enough!” He said with a smile. He didn’t expect that there would be six ladies present, and everyone who saw it would have a share! Help me distribute it to everyone!”

“Jaded skin cream!” Guo Hongjiang’s wife immediately cried out in surprise.

Tian Huixin had used the jaded skin cream a long time ago, and she had been buying and using the mass – produced version ever since it was launched. So, she could tell at a glance that this was a high – end jaded bone ice Skin Series, and she was very happy. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Liu Qian was the most surprised. She couldn’t believe her ears. She asked with her eyes wide open,”Chairman, I ... I have one too?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”aren’t you a lady?” Liu Qian, you’ve really hidden yourself well!”

Feng Rao was taking out the jaded skin ointment and couldn’t help but laugh when she heard this.
