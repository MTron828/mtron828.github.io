Chapter 182: Transplanting the vegetables

Lu You glanced at Xia ruofei and asked,””Did I say that?” “Why are you acting dumb?” Xia ruofei said,”I heard it from you last night, okay?” Lu You looked at Xia ruofei with a half – Smile and suddenly asked,””What if I say that Yueyue has a crush on you? What would you do?” Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment and said,”are you kidding me?” I’ve only met her twice, and the other time was in the pharmacy, where you were there! What secret love?” “But you’ve only met that Caucasian girl once! Didn’t they also get along well?” Lu You pouted. “What does this have to do with anything?” Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”Monica and I are just ordinary friends ...” As Xia ruofei spoke, he couldn’t help but think of the amorous scene at the top – Floor restaurant in the afternoon and his voice became unconfident. “Feeling guilty?” Lu You laughed. “Who’s guilty? Who’s guilty?” Xia ruofei was stubborn. Then, he said seriously,”I’ve been educated by the party for many years. I’m famous for being upright. In the Army, I even had to study ideology and politics to be an advanced individual! Say, how could a person with such upright values fool around with a foreign girl?” Lu You rolled her eyes and said,”continue.” “Alright...Actually, I’m a normal person too ...” Xia ruofei sighed.”But Monica and I are really innocent! Heaven and earth can bear witness!” “Alright, alright. You’re going to swear to the heavens later, right?” Lu You said,”in any case, I already knew that not many of a man’s words are true. It’s already good enough if you can believe one in ten!” “You see,” Lu You said,”the moment I mentioned Yueyue, you deliberately changed the topic. How cunning!” Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,’you’re the one who’s blaming Monica, okay? How did I change the topic?” “Did I?” “Too much! Try to recall carefully, who was it that changed the topic?” Xia ruofei said. “Even if it’s me, it’s because of you!” Lu You argued irrationally,”if you didn’t flirt with that Caucasian girl, would I have thought of this?” Fine. Xia ruofei finally understood that he could never win by reasoning with a woman. He wisely shut his mouth. However, Lu You continued to ask,”you haven’t said anything yet.” What would you do if Yueyue really had a crush on you?” “This is impossible ...” “I’m saying if!” “What else can I do? He pretended not to know! I don’t even know her well. To be honest, I don’t even remember what she looks like. ” Xia ruofei said seriously. “You’re so heartless!” Lu You glanced at Xia ruofei and said. Xia ruofei was completely speechless. It just didn’t seem right! Either you’re heartless, or you’re a Playboy. There must be one that suits you ... The road from the airport to Taoyuan farm was not far. The Toyota nanny car arrived at the villa’s entrance very quickly. The driver got out of the car and jogged around the front of the car, ready to help Xia ruofei out. Lu You had also stood up in advance to help Xia ruofei. “I’m fine, I’m fine. I’m much better now. You don’t have to help me ...”Xia ruofei said hurriedly. “Are you sure you can do it?” Lu You asked doubtfully. “How can a man say no?” Xia ruofei blurted. “Tsk! “Hooligan ...” Lu You lowered his head and said. Hence, she did not bother about Xia ruofei. She handed Xia ruofei’s luggage to the driver and sat down. Xia ruofei got out of the car slowly. At this time, ye Lingyun and pang Hao, who were both in the villa, heard the sound of the car and came out. When they saw Xia ruofei’s head wrapped in bandages and staggering, they could not help but be shocked and quickly went up to him. “Brother Xia, what’s wrong?” Ye linyun asked immediately. Seeing Xia ruofei’s sorry state, pang Hao could not help but laugh.””RUO Fei, how did you become like this after you went to Shen Cheng city?” “Your sister!” Xia ruofei said,”little fatty, you’re too heartless!” I’m so injured, and you’re still laughing?” “I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” pang Hao said with a smile.”I wanted to make a pained expression, but I couldn’t help but laugh when I saw your heroic appearance ...” “I’ll deduct your salary if you keep laughing!” Xia ruofei said,”aren’t you going to help me with my luggage?” Pang Hao took the luggage from the chauffeur with a smile while ye Lingyun came forward to help Xia ruofei. “It’s fine, Ling Yun, you don’t need to help me ...”Xia ruofei waved his hand. He thought for a while and turned back to Lu You, who was in the car, and said,””Lu You, wait for me. I have something to give you ...” “Oh!” Xia ruofei walked back to the mansion with pang Hao and ye Lingyun. He asked pang Hao to help carry the luggage upstairs to the bedroom and told them to go about their own business. He locked the doors and windows and summoned the spirit map scroll from his palm. Xia ruofei connected to the space with his mind and quickly took out a porcelain bottle and a bottle of herbal tea. Xia ruofei had prepared these in advance in the medium for emergency “preparation”. The herbal tea was the kind of common red – jar herbal tea sold in the market. The porcelain bottle contained a concentrated petal solution. The volume of this bottle was about 300 to 400 ml, and it directly integrated an entire strange flower petal. However, Xia ruofei had divided the concentrated petal solution into three porcelain bottles, so it contained about one – third of the flower petal. Xia ruofei opened the can and poured the herbal tea into the porcelain bottle until it was almost full. Then, he closed the lid and shook it gently. Xia ruofei kept the painting in his body, then slowly walked downstairs with the porcelain bottle in hand. He came to the Toyota nanny car outside the villa. Lu You didn’t stay in the car the entire time. She had already gotten out of the car and was looking at the scenery of the farm in boredom. Xia ruofei passed the porcelain bottle to Lu You and said,””Take it.” “What’s this?” Lu You took the porcelain bottle and asked in confusion. “Once a day,” Xia ruofei said.”Drink it three times. Then, your ... Stomach ache will be solved.” With that, Xia ruofei turned around and walked back. Lu You’s face was a little hot. She held the porcelain bottle tightly in her hand, and a strange light flashed in her beautiful eyes. She looked at Xia ruofei’s back, which was still staggering, and muttered to herself,””Is it really that godly? You can even cure this kind of illness?” Lu You returned to the car, and the Toyota started again and drove toward the city. Lu You looked at the porcelain bottle in her hand again, and a warm current flowed through her heart. She couldn’t help but think of the dangerous scene that happened 10000 meters in the air. She thought of the thick arms that hugged her tightly after she woke up from her sleep and the body of flesh and blood that did all she could to protect her. A layer of mist covered her eyes ... …… Just as Xia ruofei was about to enter the courtyard, he heard someone call out from behind him,””Boss, you’re back!” He turned around and saw Cao tieshu striding toward him. Seeing Xia ruofei’s current state, Cao tieshu couldn’t help but be stunned. He quickly asked,””Yo! Boss, what’s wrong? How did you get injured like this?” “Oh, I’m fine! I was jolted on the plane and accidentally hit my head. ” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Then, he frowned and asked,”old Cao, why are you at the farm? Didn’t I ask you to take care of sister – in – Law in the hospital? What are you doing here?” Cao tieshu scratched his head and laughed,”Boss, today’s the vegetable transplanting day, how can I not come? My wife is fine. My son hasn’t started school yet. He’s taking care of him in the hospital!” “That won’t do! You have to be more concerned about sister – in – Law at this time!” Xia ruofei said,”the farm will be fine without you! Let’s go back ...” “Boss, I’m really fine ...” Cao tieshu quickly said,”the ointment you gave me two days ago was very effective! My wife’s recovery speed is so fast that even the doctor said it was incredible! My wife asked me to come back and help today! She even told me to thank you properly!” The ointment that Xia ruofei had given Cao tieshu was mixed with flower petal solution. Although it was not a lot, it would definitely increase the recovery speed of broken bones. Xia ruofei did not dare to put too much in it. Otherwise, it would be like what happened today. If his fractured lumbar spine could recover more or less in just over an hour, that would be too shocking. “It’s good that it’s effective!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”by the way, have you finished the ointment? If it’s not enough, I’ll make you some more ...” “No need, boss! There’s enough!” Cao tieshu said. “Alright, tell me when you’re done.” Xia ruofei said and continued to ask,”Oh right, how’s the transplanting going today?” “Everything is going smoothly! We have 10 people here, and we are almost done with our work!” Cao tieshu said,”boss, those vegetable seedlings are really growing too well and too quickly. It’s a good thing that we transplanted them today. Otherwise, they would definitely be too big on the seventh or eighth day of the new year ...” “So fast? You’re done transplanting them all?” Xia ruofei was also surprised.”You guys are too efficient!” “Hehe, the boss has a high salary and good benefits. Everyone has endless energy!” Cao tieshu chuckled and said,”we came here at six in the morning. We didn’t go home in the afternoon. We ate something and continued to work, so ...” “Sigh ... You guys are too hard on yourselves ...” Xia ruofei shook his head. With that, Xia ruofei turned around and shouted,” Little fatty! Come out for a moment!” “They’re coming!” Pang Hao’s chubby figure appeared at the villa’s entrance and quickly walked out of the courtyard. “Little fatty, old Cao and the others are working overtime on New Year’s Day. It’s been very hard on them.” Xia ruofei said,”go and prepare ten red packets, 500 yuan each. Go to the greenhouse and distribute them to everyone. Also, when you’re making the wage list, don’t forget to include today’s overtime pay!” “Alright!” Pang Hao replied. “Boss, you can’t do that ...” Cao tieshu quickly said,”you already gave me a red packet during the new year ...” Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”old Cao, this is just a small token of my appreciation. You don’t have to reject it ... Everyone has plenty of food and drink at home during the new year. I won’t treat everyone to a meal. Also, I’m still injured, so I won’t be going to the greenhouse. Help me keep an eye on it!” “Don’t worry boss! I’ll be at the greenhouse!” Cao tieshu said,”but this red packet, we really ...” “This matter is settled! Old Cao, I have to go back to rest. You go back to the greenhouse! Let’s finish this quickly and go home!” Xia ruofei said. After saying that, he turned around and walked back. “This ...” Cao tieshu said helplessly,”then thank you, boss!” Xia ruofei turned around and waved at Cao tieshu, then walked back to the villa. Pang Hao took care of the red packets, and Xia ruofei went straight upstairs to his bedroom. Yingying’s injuries had not healed yet, and he had to drink some more petal solution. He had not taken care of his space for the past two to three days, so he had to go in and patrol. [PS] he wanted to cry but had no tears. He was attacked in the ass all the way ...
