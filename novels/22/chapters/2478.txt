2479 Signing the contract (2)

Translator: 5496903Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”brother Zhao, I, Xia ruofei, am not that stingy.”

“Hahaha! That’s good!” Zhao Yongjun laughed.

Zhao Yong Jun and Zhou leiyun had a very good personal relationship. If Xia ruofei were to have a conflict with Zhou leiyun because of Zhou Yuan’s offense, it would be very difficult for him to be caught in the middle.

After song Rui heard this, he couldn’t help but say,””In my opinion, this little brat Zhou Yuan really needs to be taught a lesson! If I was there, I would have given him a good slap!”

He had already heard from Zhuo Yiyi about what had happened before the cold dinner party. Hitting on a beautiful lady was nothing, as everyone loved beauty. However, that kind of blatant use of money was very disgusting, especially when Zhou Yuan’s target of money was Song Wei. This kind of behavior was extremely laughable, and it also made song Rui feel that this was an insult to the song family. After all, Song Wei was also considered a member of the song family.

Zhao Yong Jun said nonchalantly,”Zhou Yuan is always like this. This time, brother Zhou will definitely teach him a good lesson.”

In fact, Zhao Yong Jun was only a few years older than Zhou Yuan, but he was of the same generation as Zhou Lei Yun, and his status was much higher than Zhou Yuan ‘s, so his words did not sound like he was speaking like an old man.

Zhao Yongjun continued,”ruofei, you can take the battery – powered cart there!” I’m also itching to play a few more rounds with Xiao Rui!”

Song Rui was speechless. He waved his hand and said,””I don’t want to play anymore ... You can play by yourself!”

“What’s wrong?”Zhao Yongjun asked, surprised.

“Big brother Zhao,” Zhuo Yiyi chuckled,”song xiaorui must be scared of being tortured. I don’t think he’ll play golf anymore ...”

“Hey! Yiyi, which side are you from?” Song Rui called out in dissatisfaction.

Zhuo Yiyi blinked her eyes and said,””I’m just stating a fact!”

Zhao Yongjun saw this and couldn’t help but laugh,””I didn’t expect RUO Fei to be an expert! If there’s a chance, I’ll have a taste of it!”

Song Rui’s eyes lit up and he said,””Don’t get a chance! Let’s see it now! Zhou leiyun can just wait for a while. What’s the rush in signing the contract?”

Xia ruofei did not know whether to laugh or cry.”Xiao Rui,” he said.”Do you really want to drag someone down with you?”

Zhao Yongjun also laughed,”stop it!” We’re the hosts of the peach blossom gathering, it’s not good to make them wait too long. RUO Fei, don’t listen to Xiao Rui’s jesting. Hurry over first!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said,”you guys have fun. I’ll go over first!”

Xia ruofei returned to the main building of the peach blossom Association in his electric car. He quickly met Zhou leiyun and the legal counsel of glory world Corporation in the guest room.

“Director Xia, I’ve already prepared the contract!” Zhou leiyun said enthusiastically.

“Alright! I’ll take a look!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Zhou leiyun gestured for the legal counsel to hand the printed draft of the contract to Xia ruofei. There were two copies in total. One was glory world corporation’s transfer of shares to Espanyol, and the other was the sponsorship contract for the advertisements on the Espanyol club’s chest.

“President Xia, do you want to get your company’s legal staff to come over and take a look?” Zhou leiyun asked.

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand,”how can I not trust you?” I’ll just look at the terms myself!”

He knew very well that Zhou leiyun would definitely not, and would definitely not dare to play any tricks on the contract.

Even if Zhou leiyun really did plot against Xia ruofei, Xia ruofei had absolute confidence that he would make Zhou leiyun pay a hundred times the price. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Xia ruofei was confident of his absolute strength.

He quickly read through the two contracts, then nodded and said,””No problem, it’s very rigorous! If director Zhou doesn’t have any more questions, we can sign the contract now!”

Although Xia ruofei could read very quickly and looked like he had only skimmed through it once, in reality, with his current cultivation, even if he did not have a photographic memory, he could basically read the entire page with just a glance. He could even read it better than an ordinary person who read it word by word.

Even if Xia ruofei was not a law major, he could still see the obvious problems in the contract.

“That’s great!” Zhou leiyun said happily.

He turned around and instructed his legal counsel to print out the formal contract on the spot.

Xia ruofei said,”director Zhou, I’ll transfer the 30 million euros for the shares to your company’s account later today.” The sponsorship fee for the chest advertisement has to be transferred from my company’s account to the club’s account. It will be a little later, but it will be received by tomorrow at the latest. Also ... This sponsorship contract will be signed with my company’s seal, so you have to leave me two copies after you sign it. ”

Xia ruofei did not intend to use his own savings to sponsor the chest advertisement. He just had to use the company’s account. Three million euros was equivalent to more than 30 million Chinese dollars. Paradise Corporation had abundant cash flow now, so this amount was not considered too big.

Moreover, the advertising sponsorship fee was signed in the name of the Paradise Corporation and the Spanish football club. The company’s official seal must be in the Sanshan Corporation, and Xia ruofei could not possibly travel around the world with the company’s official seal.

As for the transfer of shares, it was simple because these shares were owned by Xia ruofei. He only needed to sign and seal it.

“No problem! No problem!” Zhou leiyun said.

Soon, the contract was printed out. There were two contracts, and each one was in two copies.

Xia ruofei quickly flipped through it and signed his name.

In just a short while, a business that was equivalent to more than 300 million Chinese dollars was completed in a low – Profile manner in this reception room of the Paradise gathering.

Zhou leiyun and Xia ruofei did not plan to hold any press conference or hold a public signing ceremony. Zhou leiyun did not want the outside world to interpret his “dumping” of Spanish club shares in any way, or even affect glory world corporation’s stock price. On the other hand, Xia ruofei simply didn’t want to cause any trouble or increase his exposure.

After signing the contract, Xia ruofei and Zhou leiyun signed the agreement to act as one. He promised that he would not interfere with the club’s operations and would follow Zhou leiyun’s opinion on the matters of the club.

In fact, Xia ruofei was afraid of trouble. He did not even care about his own company’s Affairs if he could. He was happy to be a hands – off manager. Investing in a Football Club was just for fun. Why would he interfere with the club’s operation for no reason?

Xia ruofei shook Zhou leiyun’s hand and smiled.””President Zhou, I wish us a happy cooperation!”

“Happy cooperation!” Zhou leiyun said happily,”Wu Lei’s contract should be finalized within a week. He will be able to go to Spain within ten days at the earliest. If there are no problems with the medical examination, we will hold a signing ceremony at our home stadium, El prate. President Xia, if you have time, we can go to Spain for a few days! If Wu Lei is in good form, he might be able to play in the next round of the league!”

Xia ruofei had never watched a game live before. He did not have the financial ability to do so in the past, and he did not have the conditions to go out to watch a game when he was in the Army. Later, after the peach blossom company was established, the number of times he watched the live broadcast on TV was very few, let alone taking time to watch the game live. He had no time at all.

After hearing Zhou leiyun’s words, Xia ruofei was slightly tempted. He said,””We’ll see when the time comes! If you have time, it’s not a bad idea to go to Spain. I heard that the weather there is not bad ...”

“Alright! I’ll let you know the progress of the transfer as soon as possible!” Zhou leiyun said,”you’re a major shareholder of the club now! Hahaha ...”

“Shouldn’t we have a drink at this time?” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“I think this is a good suggestion!” Zhou leiyun chuckled and said,”I heard that the Paradise gathering has a lot of good wine ...”
