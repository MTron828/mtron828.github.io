Chapter 1126: The fake can’t be real (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xu Qiang had finally made up his mind, but was interrupted by Xia ruofei, and his anger was immediately vented.

He looked at Xia ruofei in confusion and asked,”Young master Xia, what’s wrong?”

“I advise you not to buy this incense cabinet,” Xia ruofei said firmly.”It’s a fake!” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Xu Qiang was stunned by Xia ruofei’s words.

Zhao Yongjun’s expression changed slightly as well. There were unwritten rules in the antique trade. For example, even if they had made a mistake, they could only blame themselves for not having good judgment.

Also, even if they could see that there was something wrong with it, they couldn’t say it was fake. Under normal circumstances, they would say things like “can’t see it” or “it’s hard to say” and so on. Those who really understood would naturally understand.

Xia ruofei was not in the antique circle, so it was against the rules for him to say that the cabinet was a fake.

Even though Zhao Yongjun didn’t know much about wood items, he had been in the antique business for so many years. He had a good eye for antiques. If he didn’t find any obvious problems with it, Xia ruofei, who had never touched antiques, wouldn’t be able to find anything.

So, Zhao Yongjun cleared his throat and prepared to remind Xia ruofei.

However, before Zhao Yongjun could speak, fatty an’s face darkened and he said with a fake smile,””Little brother, things can be thrown out randomly, but words can’t be said randomly! The antique business is very complicated, and it’s best for outsiders to stay out of it!”

Zhao Yongjun was going to remind Xia ruofei to watch his words, but after fatty an’s words, Zhao Yongjun immediately stopped.

What kind of person was Xia ruofei?

Even elder song thought highly of him. Yesterday, song Rui even set up a scene. It was obvious that he wanted to include him in the upper circle of the rich boys in the capital. Xia ruofei also cured Zhao Yongjun’s father’s diabetes, allowing this middle – aged general to continue his military career and even advance further.

Xia ruofei was the Zhao family’s Savior!

In the face of such a relationship, the rules of the antique circle were nothing!

Fatty an was just an antique dealer. How dare he be so sarcastic and disrespectful to Xia ruofei?

Zhao Yongjun immediately snorted and said coldly,””Fatty an! What do you mean by that? If my brother says that this cabinet is fake, then it’s F * cking fake!”

Zhao Yongjun was known for his forthright attitude in the antique circle, but he was still a rich man’s son. Once he got angry, he would not lose to anyone.

Fatty an was taken aback. Xia ruofei wasn’t in the industry and didn’t know the rules. Could it be that Zhao Yongjun didn’t know the rules too?

Fatty an was from Tianjin, after all. Although he had come into contact with Zhao Yongjun a few times, he knew that Zhao Yongjun’s background was quite big. However, he didn’t know him as well as Xu Qiang and the others.

If he knew about Zhao Yongjun’s family background, he would have admitted defeat without even a fart.

Unfortunately, he didn’t know.

So even though he was a little afraid of Zhao Yongjun, he still said,””Director Zhao, this is a little unreasonable! This little brother ...”

“I’m being unreasonable!” Zhao Yongjun narrowed his eyes and said in an unfriendly tone,”also, RUO Fei is my brother. What right do you have to call him little brother?”

“You ...” Fatty an was choked speechless by Zhao Yongjun’s overbearing attitude.

Xu Qiang was the host, and he knew that Zhao Yongjun had a strong background, so he quickly gave fatty an a look and came out to smooth things over,””Brother Jun, please calm down. Boss an didn’t mean anything by it. It’s just that master Xia ...”

“Qiang Zi, are you complaining that my brother is talking too much?” Zhao Yongjun’s voice was cold.”Then stop talking so much nonsense. Let’s go!”

Then, Zhao Yongjun immediately called Xia ruofei and song Rui to leave.

Song Rui was just there to watch the show. He glanced at Xu Qiang and fatty an with a smile and said,””You two really have guts ...”

Xu Qiang’s expression changed. He quickly grabbed Zhao Yongjun’s hand and begged,””Brother Jun, brother Jun, don’t be angry!”

As he spoke, he gently smacked his own mouth and said,””I definitely didn’t mean it that way! Young master Xia’s reminder is for my own good, isn’t it? Do you think I, Qiang Zi, am such an ungrateful person?”

How could Xu Qiang dare to let Zhao Yongjun go?

If Zhao Yongjun left in anger, not only would the friendship that they had built up over the years be destroyed, they might even be hated by Zhao Yongjun. He was someone very few people in the capital dared to offend! In comparison, what was an incense cabinet made of Yingzi wood? Even if it was true, he would not lose a piece of meat if he did not buy it.

Zhao Yongjun’s face brightened a little and said,””Qiangzi, since ruofei said that there’s a problem with this cabinet, you don’t have to buy it!”

“Okay, okay, okay. I won’t buy it, I won’t buy it ...” Xu Qiang quickly agreed.

Fatty an’s expression changed slightly when he heard that. Xia ruofei saw a flash of hatred in the honest – looking Wang xingshui’s eyes and couldn’t help but secretly pout.

“Boss Xu, this isn’t very good, is it?” Fatty an frowned slightly and said,”you were the one who said you were interested in my cousin’s incense cabinet, so we rushed over from afar. You don’t like this item, so you have to give us an explanation, right? Otherwise, if word gets out, no one would dare to do business with me, fatty an!”
