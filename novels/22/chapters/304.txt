Chapter 305: Our better (1)

The Liang family members who were waiting for them at the airport suddenly perked up. They clearly knew that it would take a long time from the time the plane landed to the time they exited customs, especially for international flights, which took even longer. However, they all walked to the yellow prohibition line and waited in unison. Especially Liang Weihua’s family, who was stretching their necks to look into the restricted area, looking very eager. Liang Qichao looked on coldly from the side and couldn’t help but find it funny. Elder Tang was still on the plane, so what could he see at this time? The group waited for more than 20 minutes before they finally saw the old man in a white Tang suit walking out of the restricted area. Behind him was an assistant pushing a luggage cart, and two other bodyguards with cold expressions on their faces were tightly protecting the old man on both sides. “Uncle!” Liang Weihua immediately shouted. After that, he took two steps forward, but was immediately stopped by the airport security. Elder Tang smiled and waved his hand at everyone. Very quickly, elder Tang arrived in front of everyone. “Uncle!” “Grandpa!” Everyone greeted elder Tang, and elder Tang also smiled and nodded to everyone. It was obvious that he was in a good mood after returning from his long journey. On top of that, he was about to be able to buy the rare Phoebe zhennan material that he had been searching for a long time. It was hard not to be in a good mood! “Grandpa!” Liang Xiaojun came forward and greeted him respectfully. A smile of approval appeared on elder Tang’s face as he said,””Xiaojun! We haven’t seen each other for two years since you returned to the country! Not bad, not bad. You still look as energetic as before!” “Grandpa, it’s a great regret that I didn’t get to be by your side and listen to your teachings after I returned to the country!” Liang Xiaojun said,”it’s a good thing that you’re back in the country now. You have to give me more guidance!” Liang Weihua also laughed and said,”uncle, thank you for taking care of Xiaojun while he was abroad for a few years!” He’s changed a lot since he came back and is much more sensible than before. It’s all thanks to your teaching!” “Hahaha! We’re all family, so don’t say such things. ” Elder Tang said with a laugh. Liang Weimin watched from the side as Liang Weihua’s family interacted with elder Tang warmly. Liang Xiaojun’s performance was especially outstanding. In contrast, Liang Qichao was hiding at the side and didn’t even take the initiative to greet elder Tang. Liang Weimin was even angrier, blaming his son for not being able to live up to expectations. Liang Weihua smiled and said,”uncle, you’ve had a long journey. Let’s go eat first!” I’ve already booked the place! We’ll rest in Shen Cheng city tonight. ” “You’re still staying overnight in Shen Cheng?”asked elder Tang. I think we should just fly to the three mountains! That piece of material ...” “Uncle, don’t you worry about the material! I’ve already bought it, and there’s someone watching over it 24 hours a day. There won’t be a problem!” Liang Weihua smiled and said,”you just had a long flight. I’m afraid that you won’t be able to take the night flight. We’ve even booked a hotel, so you can stay in Shen Cheng for the night!” “Alright then, I’ll follow your arrangements!” Elder Tang said with a smile. The group left the airport and took their respective buses to the Hengfeng Jiahua Hotel, which they had booked earlier. It was also the hotel where Xia ruofei had auctioned the White truffle. The MA family’s Jiahua Hotel chain was one of the best hotels in Shen Cheng. Naturally, Liang Weihua had to choose the best one to receive old master Tang. After arriving at Hengfeng Jiahua, everyone went to the banquet hall to have dinner. Naturally, Liang Weihua’s family was in the limelight during the meal. The other relatives almost all became foils, especially Liang Xiaojun. He was sweet – tongued and studied Business Administration. He was able to follow up on many of the topics that the old man talked about, and his performance was very eye – catching. On the other hand, Liang Qichao lowered his head and continued eating, which made Liang Weimin frown, and the meal became tasteless. After the banquet, Liang Weihua invited the old man back to his room to rest. Liang Weihua had taken charge of arranging old master Liang’s accommodation this time. No one else could interfere. He had booked the best Presidential Suite in Hengfeng Jiahua. That’s right, it was the house that Xia ruofei stayed in when he came to Shen Cheng city last time. The suite was huge and had many rooms. The two bodyguards naturally stayed in the same suite as the old man. The others were assigned to their rooms on other floors. Liang Weihua’s family sent elder Tang upstairs to rest, but Liang Weimin didn’t follow. He glared at Liang Qichao and said in a low voice,””Come with me!” Liang Qichao’s mother, Yuan Shan, frowned and said,””Old Liang, why are you so fierce? Little Chao didn’t do anything wrong, right?” “You’re still speaking up for him!” Liang Weimin said angrily,”what did I tell you before I came? Ah? Let him show off in front of uncle and try to be chosen by uncle to go to the United States with him ...” “Dad! I don’t want to go to United States!” “Isn’t it good in China?” Liang Qichao asked. “You ...” Liang Weimin was so angry that he raised his hand, wanting to hit his son. Yuan Shan quickly pulled him back and said,””Old Liang! What are you doing! So many people are watching ...” Yuan Shan continued,”I think little Chao is right. You’re doing well in China, why did you go to United States?” I’m not familiar with this place ...” “You ... You ...” Liang Weimin was so angry that he couldn’t even speak properly.”You really are a spoiled child! Little Chao doesn’t strive for progress all day long, I think you’ve spoiled him!” “Why is it my business again?” Yuan Shan was not willing to back down.”You didn’t have the ability to find the Phoebe zhennan and let Liang Weihua steal the limelight, so you’re taking it out on us. Is that how you do things?” “What do you mean by venting my anger on you guys?” Liang Weimin said anxiously,”what’s wrong with me disciplining my son? You’re the one who’s harming the child by spoiling her without any principles!” Liang Qichao saw that his parents were about to argue, so he quickly said,””Mom, dad, stop quarreling! His relatives hadn’t even gone far! Don’t let others see you as a joke ...” Liang Weimin coldly snorted and said,”you still care about your reputation?” Just now, Liang Xiaojun completely beat you. Why didn’t you feel embarrassed? Also, how many times have I told you? I told you to put in more effort to find the old material of Phoebe zhennan, did you turn a deaf ear to my words again?” “I’m being wronged, dad!” Liang Qichao quickly said,”I’ve been trying my best to find some good material for the old jinsnan! And ...” Liang Qichao looked around warily, then lowered his voice and said,””And I already have some clues. If I didn’t come to Shen Cheng in a hurry, I might have already gotten the gold Phoebe zhennan material! And from my friend’s description, our Phoebe zhennan is even better than the one we found at Liang Xiaojun’s house!” He saw that his father was about to go crazy, so he didn’t dare to hide anything. He decided to tell his father about asking Xia ruofei to find a Phoebe zhennan material. Liang Weimin’s eyes went wide when he heard that. He looked at Liang Qichao in disbelief.
