Chapter 367: Chapter 345 – deserved (1)

Even though this result was expected, professor Tian’s generous announcement still caused a small commotion in the audience.

This was especially true for Agricultural University. Some students who were hiding in the crowd even deliberately made a ruckus.

“Chi ...”

“An unfair victory ...”

Vice Principal li saw the chaotic scene but didn’t say anything to stop it. Instead, he let the students below cause a scene.

Chen dongbai’s brows furrowed as he raised his voice,”Every judge has their own independent judgment. No matter which side they vote for, they must have their own reasons! Besides ...”

At this point, Chen dongbai’s gaze fell on one of the judges below the stage and he continued,”Teacher Lu from Agricultural University is also a member of the judging team. I believe that teacher Lu’s vote should have been for yang suhe from Agricultural University, right?”

Chen dongbai couldn’t stand it anymore. They didn’t ask to leave before the vote, and there was a judge from Sanshan University and Agriculture and Forestry University on the judging panel. It was fair to begin with. Now that they had lost the vote, they started to make a fuss about the composition of the judges. Wasn’t this a show of how they couldn’t afford to lose?

Teacher Lu from Agricultural University looked a little embarrassed. He stammered for a long time but did not say anything. However, everyone was not stupid. They knew that this teacher Lu had definitely voted for Agricultural University.

In fact, this was human nature. Even if it was, no one would say anything.

But in this case, it was reasonable for professor Tian to vote for Sanshan University. And objectively, the two sides had a draw, which did not affect the result at all.

On the other hand, the group of people from Agricultural University had deliberately made a ruckus just now, which clearly showed that they had some ill intentions.

Seeing Chen dongbai being so direct, Vice President li felt a little embarrassed. He knew that at this time, he had to say something to save face. Otherwise, Agricultural University would really lose face again and again this time.

However, before vice – Principal li could speak, professor Tian, who had been wearing a kind smile, spoke first.

Professor Tian walked up to the stage with a smile and said,””Dear teachers and students, I didn’t expect that a small bet between students from two schools would cause such a big wave. Since teacher Ren has called my name, then I’ll say a few words!”

The teachers and students in the audience immediately quieted down, and everyone focused their attention on the stage.

Professor Tian still had a friendly smile on his face. He said slowly,””It’s impossible to say that there were no emotional factors in the voting this time. I’ve worked at Sanshan University for decades, and to be honest, this pot of jade lion orchid belongs to my granddaughter.”

Professor Tian’s words didn’t cause too much backlash from the audience. After all, the situation was already very clear. Sanshan University didn’t have any advantage in the voting.

On the contrary, professor Tian’s open and aboveboard words won the admiration of many people.

Professor Tian continued,”but before the voting, I did carefully compare the two pots of orchids. Objectively speaking, whether it’s this pot of jade lion or the Yang Lotus given by Agricultural University, they are both the best among the orchids. From the perspective of artistic, aesthetic, and even market value, the two pots of flowers should be equal.”

Professor Tian spoke unhurriedly, and the teachers and students below the stage also listened very seriously. They knew that a highly respected senior like professor Tian definitely wouldn’t just go on stage to say a few beautiful words. There would definitely be more important things to say later.

As expected, professor Tian paused for a moment before continuing,””But in the end, the emotional factors didn’t take up a large part of my decision. After careful comparison, I still think that this jade lion is slightly better!”

When professor Tian said this, the people from Agricultural University naturally could not take it. As the leader, Vice President li could not say anything, but a teacher leading the team could not help but ask,”Professor Tian, you just said that the two pots of flowers are on par in all aspects. So what exactly made you think that the Jade lion is slightly better?”

Vice President li looked at the teacher with great approval. This was exactly what he wanted to say, but it was not appropriate to ask because of his status. The teacher had helped him throw out the question.

Professor Tian smiled and said,”orchids are known as the gentleman of flowers. Everyone admires her beautiful and graceful leaves.” Pure, elegant, and extraordinary flowers; It was a pure, distant, and refreshing fragrance. She was a symbol of character and a portrayal of character. The ancient people often regarded orchid cultivation as an important way to cultivate one’s character and temper. In my opinion, the most precious thing about orchids is their gentlemanly and pure spirit. ”

Then, professor Tian pointed at the Jade lion on the stage and said,””Everyone can make a careful comparison. This pot of jade lion Mo Lan is filled with a natural charm. No matter which angle you look at it from, we can feel her natural quality and her simple and elegant spirit. In comparison, although this pot of yang Lotus is also very beautiful and has a strong sense of appreciation, it’s more ingenious than the Jade lion and lacks a natural charm. ”

The teachers and students below the stage listened very seriously. Those who could participate in this exhibition definitely had a certain level of professional ability. At the very least, they had a strong interest in gardening. After professor Tian finished speaking, everyone naturally turned their eyes to the two pots of orchids.

The more he looked at it, the more he felt that professor Tian’s words made sense.

The Jade lion was like a natural beauty without any makeup, while yang suhe was more like a well – dressed daughter of a noble family. She was beautiful, but she lacked the otherworldly aura of the Jade lion.

As they thought about professor Tian’s words, many of the teachers and students in the audience had thoughtful expressions.

At this moment, the president of the florist Association, Chen dongbai, also stood up and walked onto the stage. He smiled and said,”Professor Tian and I were fated to be together. My vote was actually for the Jade lion, and in my heart, her noble, elegant, and divine charm was also what gave me the bonus!”

As soon as Chen dongbai’s words fell, two other judges laughed and stood up at the same time. One of them said,”President Chen, professor Tian, it seems like great minds think alike! Old man Zheng and I were also attracted by the Jade lion’s charm, so we voted for her in the end ...”

The expressions of the teachers and students below the stage became a little interesting.

Out of the 11 judges, four of them had already voted for the Jade lion, and they had the same reason.

The most important thing was that these four judges could be said to be influential figures on the judging panel. Needless to say, professor Tian and Chen dongbai, and the two judges who stood up later were also well – known experts in the industry.

In contrast, the remaining seven judges did not express which side they had voted for. Four of them were teachers from major universities. Their professionalism and authority were definitely not as good as professor Tian and the other three.

In other words, the voting result seemed to be a narrow victory for Sanshan University, but in fact, the votes that Sanshan University received were obviously much more significant than that of Agriculture and Forestry University.

This first place could be said to be well – deserved!
