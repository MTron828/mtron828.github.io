Chapter 690: The ocean in the space (2)

Xia ruofei saw Xia Qing’s eager expression and felt a little strange, but he didn’t say anything. With a thought, his figure disappeared from the spirit map space.

After returning to the outside world, Xia ruofei carefully took out the fist – sized, pitch – Black realm stone from his bag.

When the world stone was taken out, Xia ruofei could clearly feel the spirit map scroll exuding a sense of anticipation and even hunger. The entire scroll seemed to be trembling.

Xia ruofei smiled. With a wave of his hand, the spirit map scroll immediately floated up and flew into Xia ruofei’s hand.

With a thought, the world stone in Xia ruofei’s other hand disappeared into thin air. He had already sent the world stone into the spirit map space.

The spirit map scroll trembled slightly. Xia ruofei knew that the inside of the spirit map space was undergoing a drastic change. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Xia ruofei could only wait patiently outside.

After an unknown period of time, Xia Qing’s voice rang out in Xia ruofei’s mind,””Master, I’ve finished absorbing it!”

Xia Qing’s voice was filled with uncontrollable excitement.

Xia ruofei couldn’t wait any longer. He immediately disappeared from the room.

As soon as he entered the spirit map space, Xia ruofei felt refreshed.

Although the environment in the spirit map space was obviously many times better than the outside world, Xia ruofei, who often entered and exited the space, had already gotten used to the difference.

This time, Xia ruofei felt so refreshed. It was obviously because the realm had been upgraded.

......

“Master!” Xia Qing welcomed him with a smile.

“How is it? did you make a breakthrough in the spirit map world?” Xia ruofei asked.

“I’ve broken through! And it went very smoothly!” Xia Qing replied,”I broke through after absorbing a small portion of the world stone. After that, I continued to absorb for a long time before I completely absorbed the entire world stone.”

“Oh? Has there been any change in the spirit map world?” Xia ruofei could not help but ask.

“Hehe, master will see for himself later.” Xia Qing said,”master, please come over here first!”

As she spoke, Xia Qing led Xia ruofei to the spiritual heart tree.

Xia ruofei focused his eyes and saw a complete spirit Heart Flower in full bloom.

This wasn’t strange. In the past, every time the space was upgraded, the spirit Heart Flower would bloom again no matter how much harvest was left.

However, Xia ruofei soon realized that there were seven petals on the spirit Heart Flower!

“Another flower?” Xia ruofei cried out in surprise.

Xia Qing smiled and said,”master, I’ve used the energy produced when I broke through in the spirit map world to set up a small array, which has also benefited the spirit heart tree a lot.” The quality has increased by another level!”

“That’s great!” Xia ruofei shouted excitedly,”Xia Qing, well done!”

This wasn’t as simple as just one petal. This was a permanent increase in the spirit heart tree’s quality. In the future, every spirit Heart Flower that bloomed would have seven petals.

One more piece at a time, and after a long time, it would add up to a very impressive number.

Furthermore, the spirit Heart Flower petals had a wide range of uses. Whether it was for planting, breeding, or if Xia ruofei wanted to become ‘miracle doctor Xia’, he could not do without these magical petals.

It could be said that the petals of the spirit Heart Flower were definitely strategic resources to Xia ruofei, and he could never have too many of them.

“Thank you for the compliment, master!” Xia Qing said with a face full of joy,”I will continue to work hard and strive to make the spirit heart tree break through to its best state as soon as possible. When that time comes, it will have nine petals every time it blooms!”

Xia ruofei patted Xia Qing’s shoulder and said,”Mm! Then I’ll leave it to you!”

Xia ruofei continued to walk around the Archean realm. The size of the space was as he had expected. There were no changes.

However, the spiritual Qi in the air had obviously increased. After walking around the Phoebe zhennan forest, Xia ruofei felt that it was drizzling. When he came out, he realized that his clothes were a little wet.

This meant that the spiritual energy had already started to liquefy ...

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel a little speechless. If this space continued to upgrade in the future, would there be another spiritual Qi rain? Then how heaven – defying would the environment inside be?!

Phoebe zhennan, iron – Skin Dendi, wild ginseng, tea trees, and other plants were all growing well. After the space was upgraded, these crops seemed to have become more energetic.

The Pomfret that was kept as a breeding fish and the top – grade Red Dragon that was raised in another fish pond were also full of energy. Each of them was full of vitality.

After Xia ruofei strolled around casually, he brought Xia Qing to a new space, which was the mountain and sea realm that Xia Qing had mentioned.

The moment he entered the mountain sea realm, xiaohei, Da Mao, and ER Mao immediately pounced on him affectionately and wagged their tails at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei laughed and touched Blackie’s head. “Let’s go! Come and patrol with me!”

With that, Xia ruofei led Xia Qing, followed by the dogs, and quickly walked to the all – terrain vehicle.

Xia Qing often came to the mountain and sea realm to make Da Hong Pao tea leaves, so she had seen this all – terrain vehicle before. However, she naturally knew nothing about this kind of technological product. She only had a faint feeling that this steel monster seemed to be quite terrifying.

Xia ruofei jumped into the driver’s seat and gestured for Xia Qing to sit in the front seat.

Xia Qing followed Xia ruofei’s example and fastened her seatbelt.

Xiao hei and the other two familiarly laid down behind him.

Xia ruofei laughed and started the car. He stepped on the accelerator and the all – terrain vehicle immediately sped away.

Xia Qing was startled, and she subconsciously grasped the handle beside her.

As the car sped up, Xia ruofei laughed and asked,””How is it? Xia Qing, is it exciting?”

In the whistling sound of the wind, Xia Qing tightly held the armrest and asked loudly,””Master, this ... This carriage doesn’t have any horses, how can it run? And he can run so fast ... It’s ... It’s amazing!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but burst out laughing. Xia Qing had always been very profound in Xia ruofei’s eyes. She knew more about the spirit map world than he did. She also knew how to cultivate spirit plants, set up arrays, make tea leaves ... And many other skills that Xia ruofei might not have discovered.

However, in front of the all – terrain vehicle, Xia Qing showed her fear.

This was the crushing power of an era!

Although he knew that it was a bit of a bad taste, Xia ruofei still enjoyed it. He drove the all – terrain vehicle in uneven places. The car jumped up and then fell down heavily. Xia Qing couldn’t help but hold the handle even tighter.

The car soon arrived at the beach.

The salty smell of seawater assailed his nostrils. Xia ruofei could see a curved line of water from afar. As he looked further ahead, he saw the blue sea ...

The waves churned. Although the space membrane was more than a hundred meters away, the sea still gave Xia ruofei a feeling of vastness and unfathomable depth.

The car had already stopped. Xia ruofei mumbled,””There’s really an ocean ...”

At this time, Xia Qing, who had slowly recovered, said,””Of course, this is the mountain and sea realm. If there are only mountains and no sea, how can it be considered the mountain and sea realm?”

“If the spirit map world continues to level up, how big will the mountain and sea realm be?” Xia ruofei asked.

Now, even the ocean had appeared. Could it be that the ultimate state of this space ... Would be a planet?

“I don’t know either, master,” Xia Qing shook her head and said. There are many things about the spirit map world that master has to figure out on his own. ”

“I see,” Xia ruofei nodded.

He started the car again and drove along the coastline. Soon, Xia ruofei heard the sound of running water.

A large river blocked his path.

This River had appeared together with the mountain sea realm, and it had circled around the mountain. However, it had not extended to the spatial membrane at the time. It had become wider and longer with each upgrade of the space.

This time, it was directly connected to the sea. The river surged towards the sea and blocked Xia ruofei’s way.

A River could not stop Xia ruofei. If he wanted to cross the river, he could do so with a single thought. However, Xia ruofei did not do so.

He sat in the car and looked at the river in a daze. After a while, he couldn’t help but call out,””F * ck! The Ray fish I raised in this River! Now they’re all in the sea ...”
