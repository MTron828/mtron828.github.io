2166 The gospel of the survivors (3)

It was obvious that this fruit was very useful for strengthening the body of ordinary people and could even improve one’s cultivation aptitude.

This was because he had just plucked a dark purple fruit and tested it. He discovered that this fruit could nourish the soul.

Although the effect wasn’t obvious to him, if an ordinary person ate it, it would definitely improve their soul greatly, and even improve their cultivation aptitude. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Naturally, Xia ruofei would not let go of such a good thing. He plucked all the fruits from the tree and kept them in the cave in the spirit map space.

After Xia ruofei finished picking the fruit, he went back into the pond. He realized that the tree had grown out from the wall of the pond and its roots were holding onto the wall tightly.

The purple – blooded spiritual Python struggled madly before its death, but it could not destroy the pool. Naturally, Xia ruofei would find it difficult to pull the tree out of the pool.

That was why Xia ruofei gave up on the idea of moving the tree into the spirit map space.

Of course, this was only temporary. When he completely refined the mansion – guarding wooden tablet and returned here, this tree would definitely be taken away by him.

Xia ruofei climbed out of the pool and used his Qi to dry his wet clothes.

Then, he summoned the spirit map scroll and casually stuffed it in a Bush beside the pool. He left a wisp of psyche to be on alert and entered the spirit map space with a thought.

Xia Qing had already taken care of the purple blood spirit Python’s corpse. The snake gall, along with a few other medicinal herbs, including wild ginseng, had been soaked in a 150 – kilogram wine jar.

The snake skin was also removed, and the large amount of snake meat was not wasted either. Xia Qing removed the snake meat and put several large plastic sorting boxes into plastic sorting boxes. Xia ruofei bought a large number of large sorting boxes online. He opened the lids one by one and stacked them together. They didn’t take up much space, and it was quite convenient to store things in the space.

Hence, Xia ruofei simply took out a big pot and cooked a big pot of spirit snake soup in the medium. He also heated up the braised cooked food he bought before he went out to sea. He opened a bottle of the best Drunken Eight Immortals and began to eat and drink leisurely in the medium.

Xia ruofei stayed in the origin space and did not go out for the whole day. At night, he slept on the azmu yacht in the sea of the origin space.

The next morning, Xia ruofei, who had slept in the spirit map space that was rich in spiritual Qi, returned to the pool feeling refreshed and kept the spirit map scroll.

Then, he passed through the barrier and returned to the beach with ease.

On the beach about one to two hundred meters away from the cave where Puyol and the rest were staying, Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to check and found that Puyol was taking care of John while the other survivors were busy preparing breakfast in the cave. No one came out to look in their direction.

Hence, with a thought, he took out all the wood and vines that had been left to dry in the Archean realm for about a month and placed them on the dry sand.

Then, Xia ruofei walked to the entrance of the cave and said,””Pjoll, you guys hurry up and eat breakfast. Then, the one with the weakest physical strength will stay behind to take care of Little John. The rest of you will follow me to build the raft!”

“Yes! Daoist immortal!” Puyol said excitedly, then ordered without hesitation,”David! You stay and help me take care of the child! He’s not running a fever anymore last night, so he doesn’t need to take the fever medicine anymore. Later, feed him some bread paste, and then feed him the medicine half an hour after dinner. It’s that oral solution, one – third of a bottle is enough, got it?”
