Chapter 563: Earning 20 million Yuan (3)

“Then I’m relieved. You’re all so surprised that I’m feeling uneasy too!” Xia ruofei laughed and said half – jokingly.

Mr. Lin also smiled a little embarrassedly, and then asked with a trace of apprehension,””Brother Xia, you’ve promised to sell all of these tin kaedos to us, haven’t you?”

Xia ruofei chuckled,”big brother Lin, don’t worry!” I’ve already moved my things here, how can I take them away?”

Chief Lin heaved a sigh of relief and said,””That’s great! Brother Xia, this batch of fengdou ... Our Qiantang Tongren Hall is willing to buy all of them. As for the price ... 150000 Chinese dollars per kg, what do you think?”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment and asked,”brother Lin, if I remember correctly ... The last time I came to your shop, boss Hu bought iron – Skin maples at 100000 Yuan per kilogram, right?” This purchase price ...”

“The one you bought last time was only first – Class, boss Hu,” said President Lin with a smile. “The price of special – grade is more expensive than that.” 150,000 Chinese dollars per kg ... It’s about 30% higher than the price we pay for the special goods. I’ve estimated this price based on the various indicators of your batch of maple douls. After all, I’ve never bought such high quality iron – skinned maple douls before. ”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and nodded.””Alright, since big brother Lin has said so, then we’ll trade according to the price you set!”

“Thank you, brother Xia!” President Lin was overjoyed. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

He immediately ordered the staff to come in and take the whole bag of iron – Skin maples to weigh. Xia ruofei and the others followed.

Tongren Hall’s weighing scale was very accurate. After all, some of the medicinal materials they purchased were very valuable. For example, the iron – skinned maple bucket this time was worth thousands of Yuan.

After weighing, Xia ruofei’s batch of iron – skinned maples weighed 136.4 kilograms, which was 20.46 million Huaxia dollars in total.

Although Xia ruofei already had a rough idea, he still couldn’t help but be shocked when he received such a definite sales figure.

This was only the first batch! It had brought in a profit of 20 million.

The financial pressure on the Paradise company was suddenly gone, and the money needed for the farm infrastructure was more than enough. He also didn’t need to advance the winery’s dividend.

Moreover, Xia ruofei had calculated the growth cycle of the iron – Skin dendrobe. Basically, it was more appropriate to harvest it once every three years. Then, taking into account the time flow difference, it would take one to one and a half months.

After planting this batch of Ironhide vessels in the medium, Xia ruofei basically had zero cost. The only thing he had to pay was the workers ‘wages. Compared to the profit from selling the Ironhide maples, it was like a drop in the ocean.

More than 20 million Yuan in a month’s time. It was way too easy to earn money! It was comparable to a money printing machine!

Xia ruofei once again had a clear understanding of the value of the spirit map space.

After both parties had confirmed the weight of the iron – Skin maple bucket, CEO Lin said to Xia ruofei,””Brother Xia, let’s sign the acquisition contract first! This is a large sum of money, so I’ll have to ask the main store tomorrow before I can transfer the money. Is that okay?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Of course, no problem. How could I not trust big brother Lin?”

In fact, Xia ruofei was not worried that President Lin would try to take his money. With his current means, even if President Lin went back on his words, he had countless ways to get his things back and also leave a deep impression on President Lin.

“Thank you, brother Xia!” President Lin rubbed his hands and chuckled.”Brother Xia, I have a request.”

“You’re welcome, please speak. ” Xia ruofei said with a warm smile.

“I remember you said last time that you can purchase a batch of this quality of iron – Skin Dendrobium every two or three months, right?” President Lin’s eyes were filled with anticipation as he asked,”brother Xia, do you think ... We can establish a long – term cooperation mechanism? In the future, as long as it’s iron – Skin Dendrobium produced by your company, our Qiantang Tongren Hall will be responsible for acquiring it?”

Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”brother Lin, there are so many iron – hide maples. Can you finish them?”

“You don’t have to worry about that at all,” President Lin quickly replied. Brother Xia, to tell you the truth, in the current domestic market, iron maples have always been in high demand, especially your super high quality goods, there is no market for it. A few hundred kilograms or even one or two tons a year is nothing! Besides, the Ironhide fengdou is also selling well internationally. Even if the quantity is a little high in the later stages, we can totally go through the export route!”

In fact, Qiantang Tongren Tang alone would not be able to get so many goods. After all, the area that this store could reach was limited. However, Tongren Tang was a giant pharmaceutical chain in the country with a perfect sales network. The main branch in Beijing would definitely welcome Mr. Lin’s acquisition of such high – Quality Ironhide maples with open arms.

And once a long – term cooperation agreement was reached, it would definitely be the most eye – catching achievement in boss Lin’s career. He would be promoted and put in an important position soon, which was why he was so concerned about this matter.

Xia ruofei thought for a moment. He had a good impression of Mr. Lin. He was honest and friendly. At least, Xia ruofei did not feel uncomfortable when he was dealing with him.

Since I’m going to sell the iron – Skin maples, and President Lin is interested in buying them, and Tongren Hall has a perfect sales channel, why not?

With a monthly income of 20 million, Xia ruofei naturally would not be stingy with the money.

He thought for a moment and said,””Big brother Lin, I agree with your suggestion in principle, but I have a condition. If you guys can agree, then I can decide on this long – term cooperation right now!”
