Chapter 116: Life – saving straw (1)

Although Xia ruofei did not understand Cantonese, he could tell that something major had happened when he saw Ma Zhiming’s expression change. Hence, he also stopped in his tracks and looked at Ma Zhiming. Tian Huixin waited for Ma Zhiming to hang up the phone and immediately asked anxiously,”Zhiming, what’s wrong with dad?” Ma Zhiming was a little dejected, and his eyes were a little red. He calmed his emotions and said to Tian Huixin,”Father ... He had a sudden cerebral hemorrhage. He’s in a deep coma ...” “Ah?” Tian Huixin reached out and covered her mouth. After a long while, she muttered,”how could this be? Father ... He’s always been in good health ...” “Huixin, we have to return to the port immediately. Dean Qin said that dad’s condition ... I’m afraid he won’t be able to hold on for long ... The plane sent by my family has already applied for a return flight. It’s now on its way to Sanshan. Let’s go to the airport now!” Ma Zhiming said with a sad expression. “Alright ... Let’s go!” Tian Huixin was also a little flustered. Although her father – in – Law had gradually begun to delegate power to Ma Zhiming, he was still the pillar of the family business. If her father – in – Law was no longer around, Ma Zhiming would immediately face a situation of internal and external difficulties. Ma Zhiming gently wiped the tears from the corner of his eyes and said to Xia ruofei,””Xia Sheng, I’m sorry. My father had a sudden cerebral hemorrhage and we have to rush back to Hong Kong immediately. I’ll have to trouble you next time to treat Huanhuan. ” “Oh, I’m fine ...” Xia ruofei said,”you guys should go back!” The old man’s matter is more important!” “Alright,” he said. Ma Zhiming and Tian Huixin walked out. Tian Huixin went to the courtyard and picked up Huanhuan, who was still not done playing. Everyone walked out of the courtyard together. Naturally, Xia ruofei sent them all the way to the door. At this moment, Lu You suddenly looked at Xia ruofei and asked,””Xia ruofei, do you ... Do you have any way to save my uncle’s father?” Ma Zhiming and Tian Huixin immediately stopped in their tracks and looked at Xia ruofei with hope. Just now, they had been so worried that all they could think of was to get back to Hong Kong as soon as possible. After Lu You’s question, Ma Zhiming and his wife immediately remembered that Xia ruofei’s medical skills were very brilliant. Anyone with a little medical knowledge would know how dangerous professor Tian’s acute myocardial infarction was, not to mention Huanhuan’s autism. This was a world – Class medical problem, but Xia ruofei had successfully solved it. On the phone, Dean Qin of his family’s private hospital had basically announced that his father, MA Xiong, had no hope. Ma Zhiming was in a hurry to go back. On one hand, he wanted to see his father one last time. On the other hand, he wanted to go back to stabilize his situation and prepare for the various pressures from inside and outside the family after MA Xiong’s death. It was as if he had found a life – saving straw and placed all his hopes on Xia ruofei. The couple looked at Xia ruofei intently, hoping that he would nod. Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”Chinese medicine does have a way to treat cerebral hemorrhage. However, it also needs to be analyzed in detail. I haven’t seen the patient yet and I don’t know the condition at all. I can’t make any guarantees ...” When Lu You heard this, she immediately said,”Xia ruofei, please help aunty and uncle!” We don’t need your guarantee, we just need to try our best ...” When Lu You spoke, she looked at Xia ruofei with her big, watery eyes. “Xia Sheng, if it’s convenient for you, please come back to Hong Kong with us,” Ma Zhiming quickly said.”We’ll be very grateful regardless of whether the treatment is successful or not!” Xia ruofei was not against treating MA Xiong’s illness. He had a good impression of this well – known rich man. He was also familiar with the inspirational story of MA Xiong’s poor self when he was young. Moreover, helping the MA family would definitely be of great help to his career in the future. However, Xia ruofei did not know how serious MA Xiong’s condition was, so he was hesitant. He thought for a moment and said,”it’s fine if you want me to go with you ... But I don’t have a Hong Kong and Macau Pass!” A pass was required to go to Hong Kong. Even if it was an urgent application, it would take five to seven working days. By then, it would be too late. “I’ll get my mom to coordinate it immediately!” Lu You said without hesitation,”you guys go to the airport first. Leave the Hong Kong and Macau Pass to me!” “Xiao Xia ...” Tian Huixin looked at Xia ruofei with pleading eyes. Xia ruofei no longer hesitated. He nodded and said,””Alright! I’ll go with you! But you’ll have to wait for me for two minutes. ” With that, Xia ruofei returned to the villa and entered the garage. The garage door was locked every morning, except for when he was carrying the vegetables. Xia ruofei summoned the spirit painting scroll in the garage. Then, he took five days ‘worth of vegetables each for the two restaurants and placed them on both sides. Then, he took out a small suitcase from his space and put a few clothes in it. He then dragged the suitcase out of the villa. From Ma Zhiming and the others ‘point of view, Xia ruofei must have gone into the house to pack his luggage. Xia ruofei gave ye Lingyun some instructions, mainly about Xi jiangyue and Ling’s restaurant coming over to pick up the vegetables. He also entrusted him with the farm’s construction site. In the end, Xia ruofei also gave ye Lingyun the keys to the villa and the pickup truck. Then, Xia ruofei also gave some instructions to lightning. He wanted it to listen to ye Lingyun’s words when he was out for a few days. Time was of the essence. After Xia ruofei quickly settled these matters, he followed Ma Zhiming’s family into the Mercedes – Benz business car. Lu You, on the other hand, took the Mercedes – Benz that Ma Zhiming’s bodyguard drove back to the city. On the way to the airport in the business car, Xia ruofei called President Zheng and Ling Qingxue respectively, telling them that he was going out for a few days and that the Taoyuan vegetables to be supplied for the next five days had been prepared in advance. He asked them to send a car over to transport them immediately. Both families had their own cold storage, so it was not a big problem to keep the vegetables for a few days. In the end, Xia ruofei sent ye Lingyun’s contact information to the two of them. When Ling Qingxue heard that Xia ruofei was going out, she asked about the situation out of concern. However, this was Ma Zhiming’s family’s private matter, so it was not convenient for Xia ruofei to say too much. He only said that he had an emergency and had to be away for a few days so that she could rest assured. The airport was also in Changping County, so it took about half an hour for the car to arrive at Changping airport, which was located by the sea. This time, the MA family had sent a private jet to pick them up, so Xia ruofei and the others did not take the normal passageway. Instead, they came to a small building next to the main terminal. There was a passageway for private jets. As soon as they arrived at the airport, Lu You called to tell them that Xia ruofei’s Hong Kong and Macau Pass was settled. The Secretary had personally come forward. This could no longer be described as efficient. Ten minutes ago, Xia ruofei had sent the required documents to Lu You in the car. The entire set of documents had been completed in less than half an hour. Ma Zhiming’s bodyguards took Xia ruofei’s Hong Kong and Macau Pass and drove to the airport. Xia ruofei and the rest could only wait. Fortunately, the private jet from Hong Kong had yet to land, so it was not a waste of time. It was about a 50 – minute drive from the city, but from the time Lu You called to the time when the bodyguards rushed to the private plane terminal, it only took about half an hour. It was estimated that these few brothers had also been running with all their might along the way. Xia ruofei received a brand new Hong Kong and Macau Pass and immediately went through a simple security check with Ma Zhiming’s family of three. They entered the private plane terminal’s restricted area. There was a limited number of passengers on the plane, so the bodyguards did not follow them in. They were taking the fastest civil flight back to the port. Xia ruofei and the rest went to the designated parking spot on the tarmac and waited. After a short while, they saw a jet business plane much smaller than a passenger airliner slowly approaching from the distance and quickly and steadily landing on the runway ...𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m
