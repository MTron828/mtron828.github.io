“Okay ...” Ling Qingxue nodded her head obediently and got into bed.

Xia ruofei climbed onto the bed and hugged Ling Qingxue’s body from behind.

Very quickly, he heard Ling Qingxue’s breathing slowly become even. She had clearly fallen asleep.

Xia ruofei’s eyes were wide open, and he did not fall asleep for a long time.

Ling Qingxue’s progress was much faster than he had expected. Once Ling Qingxue broke through to refined Qi Level 3, in addition to her spiritual power reaching the early stage of spiritual palpitations, she would be at the same level as Song Wei when he was cultivating with her spiritual body.

Furthermore, Xia ruofei’s spiritual power cultivation had broken through to the spirit gathering realm. His control of his spiritual power was much better than when he was cultivating with Song Wei.

In other words, once Ling Qingxue broke through to refined Qi Level 3, she could basically start trying to practice spirit – body Fusion.

Xia ruofei didn’t expect the showdown to happen so quickly.

Of course, even after the spirit and body combined cultivation, Xia ruofei could not have told Ling Qingxue about Song Wei. However, dragging it out was not a solution. It would go against his original intention and it would be unfair to Song Wei.

At that moment, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel worried. He tossed and turned in bed for a long time before he managed to fall asleep.

At six in the morning, Xia ruofei felt Ling Qingxue move beside him. She gently lifted the blanket and prepared to get out of bed. He woke up in an instant.

In fact, Xia ruofei did not sleep much for the past two to three hours. At most, he was in a half – awake state.

Xia ruofei knew that Ling Qingxue probably wanted to go downstairs to prepare breakfast. After all, Feng Jing lived on the first floor. He guessed that Ling Qingxue had her own plans and did not want Xia ruofei to go down alone to prepare breakfast, so he decided to wake up earlier.

Xia ruofei laughed in his heart. He had wanted to pretend to be asleep, but on second thought, he realized that he couldn ‘T. He was very clear about Ling Qingxue’s cooking skills. For the sake of his stomach, he couldn’t be lazy.

Hence, Xia ruofei lay down for a while. When Ling Qingxue came out of the bathroom after washing up and stood by the bed to change her clothes, he pretended to have just woken up and rubbed his eyes to look at Ling Qingxue.

“Why are you up so early?” Xia ruofei purposely asked with a hint of sleepiness.

“Ya! I woke you up!” Ling Qingxue said,”it’s nothing. You should sleep a little longer! I’ll go downstairs to make breakfast!”

Xia ruofei immediately got up from the bed and said,””Wife, how can I let you do this kind of rough work? I’ll do it!”

After he finished speaking, he ignored Ling Qingxue’s advice and quickly got dressed. Then, he walked to the bathroom as he said,””Wait for me! You don’t have to worry about the breakfast, I’ll take care of it!”

Xia ruofei washed up and went downstairs with Ling Qingxue.

Ling Qingxue took the initiative to go downstairs to cook because she had her own thoughts. Now that Xia ruofei went downstairs by himself and she was watching from the side, she was naturally happy to be free since Xia ruofei was willing to make breakfast.

She watched as Xia ruofei busied himself in the kitchen. Since she could not help, she went to the living room and cuddled on the sofa, scrolling through her phone.

After a while, Feng Rao also woke up.

It was obvious that she had not had a good rest. Her face still looked tired, and even her eye bags were showing.

When Ling Qingxue saw Feng Rao, she immediately put away her phone and stood up. She smiled and said,””Sister che, you’re up!”

“Yup! You guys are up early!” Feng Rao smiled.

Ling Qingxue looked at Feng Rao and asked with concern,””Sister che, you don’t look very good! Did you not rest well last night?”

Feng Rao’s face reddened as she thought about the faint sounds coming from upstairs last night. She said unnaturally,””Yup! I didn’t sleep well ...”

“Why?” Ling Qingxue asked, concerned. Are you not used to a strange place?”

Feng Jing thought to herself, don’t you guys know why?

However, she couldn’t reveal this matter. She could only go along with Ling Qingxue’s words and said,””Maybe! I don’t really like my bed ... It’s okay, I’ll just sleep early tonight and get some sleep ...”

“Poor sleep will have a huge impact on the skin.” Ling Qingxue said,”by the way, I still have some Jade skin cream here. Come upstairs with me and use it!” The Jade skin cream is very effective in eliminating eye bags. It’s simply immediate. ”

Feng Jing knew the effects of the jaded skin cream. She had planned to use it when she returned to the company, so she subconsciously declined,””No need, no need ... I also have some over there ...”

“Why are you being so polite with me?” Ling Qingxue dragged Feng Rao upstairs without a second thought.”You need to get your skin treated immediately!” Let’s go, let’s go!”

Xia ruofei came out with a few side dishes and said with a smile,””Time for breakfast! Eh? Qingxue, why are you pulling sister ran upstairs?”

“Don’t blindly inquire about Women’s Affairs!” Ling Qingxue said,”you eat first! You don’t need to wait for us ...”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and put down the plates. He shook his head and went to the kitchen to get the porridge.

The breakfast that Xia ruofei prepared was simple. It was plain porridge and side dishes. There were also a few fried eggs with Lotus. It was not very sumptuous but it looked very exquisite.

After a while, Feng Rao and Ling Qingxue came down side by side. Feng Rao’s complexion looked much better, and it seemed like the effects of the jaded skin ointment were quite good.

However, the jaded skin cream could only improve her skin, but it could not hide the disappointment between her brows.DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎
