“Chairman, I ...” Feng Jing said, a little embarrassed.

Xia ruofei smiled nonchalantly and said,””You’re telling the truth. I won’t be so petty. In fact, this online store was pieced together by free templates that I randomly found on the internet. Its core value is not in its bright appearance, but the products it sells and the reputation of its customers. ”

Feng Ye was stunned for a moment before blurting out,””You’re saying ... These sales and ratings are all real?”

“Of course, do you think I’m the kind of person who would do anything to gain more data?” Xia ruofei asked Feng Jing with a half – Smile.

“No, no, that’s not what I meant ...” Feng Jing quickly waved her hand.

Feng Rao’s current appearance was indeed a little embarrassing, and her face was flushed red. The main reason was that this was simply unbelievable. As soon as Feng Jing saw the explosive sales and the screen full of positive comments, the first thought that came to her mind was that this store was unscrupulous in its way of boosting the numbers. Especially since the storefront was so simple and crude, it made the beautiful numbers even less convincing.

That was why she had blurted out that question when Xia ruofei had said that the core competitiveness of this online store was its products and reputation.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”before I set up paradise Corporation, I mainly relied on succulent plants to earn starting capital.” At that time, a friend of mine supplied the goods, and I was in charge of online sales. The quality of these succulent plant seedlings was extremely high, so although the price was ridiculously high, every time a new product was put on the shelves, it would be snatched up. ”

“Yes,” Feng Jing nodded.”Chairman, do you have any other plans for letting me take over this blogshop?”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I’m planning to reuse this online store.” I’ve also contacted my friend, and he can still provide a stable supply of high – Quality succulent seedlings. I think that in addition to the succulents, we can also manage other products of the company, such as ...”

Feng Rao immediately continued Xia ruofei’s words and said,””For example, a top – grade iron – Skin fengdou!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Yes, according to the current situation, there must be a lot of surplus in addition to the annual production of iron maples that met the contract order. We can totally sell it on the online platform! Our other products, such as vegetables and fruits, can also be sold through the online store in the future. ”

Xia ruofei paused and continued,””The owner of this blogshop is me, and I’ve also accumulated a lot of high – end customers, so I’m considering transforming this blogshop into paradise corporation’s flagship store. We’ll still be walking the high – end, high – Quality route.”

Feng Rao nodded and thought for a while,”As long as there’s no dispute over the ownership, it’s completely fine. Chairman, since we’re going to do it, we have to make it more exquisite. ”

“That’s for sure. ” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”with our current online store, no one would believe us if we told them that we’re going for premium products! This is a business card of our paradise Corporation on the internet. Naturally, we have to do it well. Boss Feng, do you have any good ideas?”

Feng Jing thought for a while and said,”since we’ve decided to do it well, the first thing we have to do is to upgrade the celestialcat store. Also, I suggest we set up an e – commerce Department under the sales department. They will be in charge of the maintenance and operation of the E – store.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”okay, come up with a plan first!” Aren’t we going to recruit medical professionals to supplement the pharmaceutical factory and research Institute? “Coincidentally, I’ve also started recruiting for the e – commerce Department. In any case, it’s fine to rush one sheep, but it’s fine to rush two ...”

“How can you compare your own employees to sheep ...” Feng Jing chuckled.

“Let’s make an analogy!” Xia ruofei laughed drily.”President Feng, you should personally take care of this matter! See what kind of people are needed and recruit them as soon as possible ... Oh, right, hasn’t Qiao’ er been self – studying graphic design recently? When the time comes, ask her to intern at the e – commerce Department and learn how to design websites from the designers. ”

“Alright! I’ll personally come up with a plan and show it to you later. ” Feng ke said. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“The new batch of succulent plants will be here soon.” Xia ruofei said,”if there’s not enough time, we can select a few employees who have experience in this area and put them into work first. We don’t have to worry about the renovation of the store in the early stage. We mainly need to upgrade the Lynx store, qualification certification, new goods on the shelves, and dispatch the goods. ”

“Understood!” Feng ke said.

Xia ruofei wrote down the Taobao shop’s account number, password, and everything else and passed it to Feng Rao before letting her get busy.

Xia ruofei walked out of the general office building and left Taoyuan farm in his pickup truck.

Of course, Xia ruofei didn’t go to the city. He just found a less populated section of the road and took out all the seeds that Xia Qing had soaked and repackaged from the space. He placed them in the back of the pickup truck.

He rested in the car for a while and smoked a few cigarettes. After some time, he started the car again and drove back to the farm.

On the way, Xia ruofei gave Cao tieshu a call and asked him to gather the workers to get ready to unload the truck.

When the car returned to the farm, Cao tieshu and the workers were already waiting impatiently at the entrance.

Cao tieshu directed the workers to carefully unload all the seeds from the trucks and carry them into the vegetable greenhouse.
