Chapter 1482: So you’re in Yuezhou (2)

Translator: 549690339

Song Wei’s face turned red as she said,”you’re such a Blabbermouth!” Why aren’t you leaving?”

Xu Yuan Yuan laughed and said,”I know!” It seemed that Wei Wei couldn’t wait! Zhuang Yan, let’s go! Don’t be an eyesore ...”

Then, Xu Yuanyuan really pulled Zhuang Yan and left quickly. She insisted that Xia ruofei and Song Wei did not come down to see her off.

After the two of them left, the atmosphere in Xia ruofei’s room became a little ambiguous, especially after Xu Yuanyuan’s joke.

Song Wei blushed and said in a low voice,””I ... I’ll go back to my room first!”

“Oh ...” Xia ruofei also felt a little embarrassed.”Rest early ...”

“En!” Song Wei said.

Although she knew that Xia ruofei would not be so ridiculous as to let her stay the night, she could not help but feel a little disappointed.

When they reached the door, Song Wei turned around and said,””By the way, Yuanyuan said that she would take us around Tanzhou tomorrow. Let’s postpone it for a day!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Xia ruofei also knew that Song Wei and Xu Yuanyuan had not seen each other for a long time. Moreover, they had announced to the public that they were here for a tour in xiangnan. Since Xu Yuanyuan offered to bring them to tour Tanzhou, it was naturally not good to reject. Otherwise, it would seem unreasonable.

“Yuezhou is a convenient place and it’s not far from here!” He added.

“Yup!” Song Wei said subconsciously. Then, she raised her head and looked at Xia ruofei.”How ... How did you know?”

Xia ruofei laughed.”I’m good at divination. Don’t think that I don’t know anything if you don’t tell me!”

Song Wei was not in a hurry to leave. She looked at Xia ruofei and asked,””Since you know the place, you won’t leave me behind and run over there alone, right?”

“How could that be!” Xia ruofei said,”my words carry enormous weight!”

“Why do I not believe it?” Song Wei said,”if you leave me here and go to Yuezhou, who can I talk to?” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Can’t there be some trust between people?” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.

“We can ‘t!” Song Wei said with a smile.

“Then what do we do?” Xia ruofei spread his hands and said,”my legs are mine. You can’t stop me if I really want to leave!”

“Why don’t I stay here tonight and watch over you? let’s see how you can escape!” Song Wei laughed.

Xia ruofei was shocked and quickly said,””Stop joking! Let me tell you the truth! Actually, I was just trying to get some information out of Zhuang Yan. Isn’t he also from the cultural relics system? It’s not a secret in the cultural relic system of Hunan Province ...”

“You’re so sinister!” Song Wei said coquettishly,”you even lied to an honest man like Zhuang Yan ...”

“I didn’t lie to him! We’re really just having a chat!” Xia ruofei said,”and I know my limits. I didn’t get to the bottom of it. I only know that the ancient tomb is in Yuezhou. I don’t know anything else! So you can rest in peace. Without you as a guide, I can’t even move a single step!”

“Really?” Song Wei asked.

“I swear to the heavens ...” Xia ruofei raised his hand, but then realized that they were indoors, so he changed his words.”I swear to the lights!”

“Alright! Then I’ll believe you for once!” Song Wei said,”don’t lie to me! Otherwise, I’ll never forgive you!”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly. Why did his words sound so ambiguous?

Song Wei did not notice anything wrong. After she warned Xia ruofei, she returned to her room with a smile.

......

The next day, Xu Yuanyuan came to the hotel early and took Xia ruofei and Song Wei on a tour around Tanzhou.

Zhuang Yan didn’t come because he had to go to work. He only showed up for dinner at night.

As for Xu Yuanyuan, she didn’t need to go to work anymore. Last night, the chief said in person that she could stay at home and prepare for the exam.

The dinner was hosted by Xu Yuanyuan. Firstly, her classmate had come from afar and she had to be a good host. Secondly, it was thanks to Xia ruofei’s help that she was able to get into the postgraduate entrance examination. Therefore, she was also grateful.

After dinner, Xu Yuanyuan drove Xia ruofei and Song Wei back to the hotel in the Polo that she had bought for her wedding.

Xu Yuan Yuan wanted to take them to the nearby attractions the next day, but Song Wei didn’t want to waste any more time in tan Zhou, so she declined.

Xu Yuanyuan knew that Song Wei and Xia ruofei had to fly to Tanzhou on their way back. Hence, when they bade farewell at the entrance of the hotel, she reminded Song Wei to look for her so that they could get together again.

After another night in the hotel, Xia ruofei and Song Wei finally embarked on their journey to Yuezhou the next day.

The two of them rented an off – Road vehicle to Yuezhou. For safety reasons, Xia ruofei even used a fake identity card. All the cars in the taxi rental company had GPS and their tracks were recorded. Xia ruofei had to avoid leaving any clues that might lead people to connect him to the tomb.

Although the possibility of this happening was very low, Xia ruofei would not allow any slip – ups.

Of course, Song Wei did not know that Xia ruofei had rented a car and drove back to the hotel to pick her up.

Yuezhou was built in 505 B.C., On the shore of Dongting. It was an ancient city with a history of more than 2600 years and was only a hundred kilometers away from Tanzhou.

After more than two hours of driving, the two arrived at Yuezhou city.

After the car drove out of the toll station, Xia ruofei asked with a smile,””Song Wei, can you tell me the exact location now?”

“I’ve been wondering when you’ll ask me this the whole time, but it seems like you’re pretty patient!”Song Wei chuckled.

Xia ruofei was speechless. He looked at Song Wei innocently.

“That’s enough!”Song Wei laughed. I’ll set up a navigation system for you, so drive ahead!”

“Yes, sir!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Soon, Song Wei set the destination on the car navigation system. Xia ruofei took a glance and realized that the ancient tomb was located in Hualin County, West of Yuezhou city. It was still tens of kilometers away.

Xia ruofei looked at the time. It was too late to rush to Hualin County for lunch, so he said,””Song Wei, let’s have lunch in Yuezhou before we leave!”

“No problem! I’ll follow your arrangements! I’m only responsible for leading the way!” Song Wei said.

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said.

Song Wei had already set up the navigation system. He did not bother to adjust it. He drove straight to Yuezhou city according to the signs along the way. They found a restaurant that looked relatively clean and had a simple lunch. Then, they got on the car and continued to set off.

Since they were already very close to their destination, Song Wei naturally would not hide anymore. On the way, she introduced the ancient tomb of the Ming Dynasty to Xia ruofei.

The tomb was located on Mount Yu in the South of Hualin County. It was said that Yu the Great once climbed the mountain when he was trying to control the flood. A temple of King Yu was built on the mountain, which was also a local scenic spot.

The ancient tomb was on the other side of the mountain, facing Dongting Lake. It was close to a mountain and a River. From a Feng Shui point of view, it should be a good place.

In addition, Song Wei also explained some of the things that she had learned when she was involved in the archeology work. After all, she had been to the tomb and had experienced many things personally.

After Xia ruofei heard this, he frowned and said,””Song Wei, according to the news I got from Zhuang Yan the day before yesterday, the problem now is ... The ancient tomb has been filled back by the local government. In order to prevent the poison from leaking out when it’s opened again, there should be people guarding it all year round ...”

“When we left, there were armed police guarding the place.” Song Wei nodded and said,”but it’s been more than half a year. The security should not be so tight anymore. However, there are definitely guards.”

“Then, we have to think of a way to enter the tomb ...” Xia ruofei pondered for a moment and asked,”Song Wei, can you draw a sketch from your memory? we can study it together!”
