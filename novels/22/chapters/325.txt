Chapter 326: The overseas team (1)

“Paradise Farm?” Liang Qichao didn’t react for a moment. “It’s the padink farm that I worked with elder Tang on in the Hunter Valley in Australia!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”after our cooperation, we have decided to change the name to Paradise Farm!” “Woof! This name sure is loud!” Liang Qichao said with a smile. Then he asked in confusion,”but ... What can I do at the farm?” “Brother Liang, listen to my analysis!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”compared to living under the old man’s nose in the United States and competing with Liang Xiaojun, wouldn’t you be more carefree in Australia? Just think about it! Australia’s vast farms, the scenery of the countryside, and no one is taking care of you ...” Xia ruofei’s words were full of temptation, and Liang Qichao couldn’t help but show a trace of fascination. However, he quickly regained his senses and said,””Ruofei, that’s not right! If I go to Australia and Liang Xiaojun stays in the United States, won’t I lose for sure? His Foundation is better than mine. If he goes to the old man’s big company and I go to the farm, my starting point will be so much lower than his. How can I compare with him? And I heard that the return on investment for the farms in Australia is very low. It’s hard for me to achieve any results in the past. ” Xia ruofei smiled.”The average farm has a low return on investment. Since I’ve already invested in it and I’m about to introduce paradise vegetables to Australia, do you think it’ll be difficult to produce results?” Brother Liang, let me tell you, even if Liang Xiaojun stayed in the United States, he would still have to start from a basic position. What kind of outstanding results can he produce in a short time?” Xia ruofei paused for a moment and continued,””But you’re different. Think about it. You’ve been running an immortal meat stall for many years, so you must have a natural advantage in running a farm! You said that you didn’t use your strengths and instead did things you weren’t good at. Do you think you can become a Wall Street elite if you go to the United States? A different profession is like a mountain!” “You’re right, but ...” Liang Qichao hesitated.”The situation in Australia is different from our country. Some of my past experiences might not be of use there!” “You’ll have to rely on yourself!” Xia ruofei said,”I think the difference between Australia and China is mainly in the laws and regulations. I heard that they have clear regulations and restrictions on farm management, but these things should not be difficult to grasp as long as you study hard! Besides, you’re not the only one there. Doesn’t elder Tang have a professional team to manage the farm? If you can go over, just point out the general direction. ” Xia ruofei took a sip of his wine and continued,””I can tell you clearly that Paradise Farm will soon enter a stage of rapid development. When my paradise vegetables are introduced to the farm, Paradise Farm’s performance will see a sharp leap, and even elder Tang might be shocked. And at that time, Liang Xiaojun might still be at the bottom of the company! Wouldn’t it be clear who’s better?” Liang Qichao was finally moved by Xia ruofei’s words. He thought over Xia ruofei’s words seriously and felt that they made sense. If he really went to the United States to compete with Liang Xiaojun, who had an MBA from a famous university, he would probably lose without a doubt as he was a graduate from a diploma mill and barely passed his English. If it was like what Xia ruofei had said, and he went to Australia to run a farm, it might really be a great idea! With that thought in mind, Liang Qichao’s attitude changed. However, he soon started to worry about his personal gains and losses. He frowned and said,”ruofei, even if I wanted to go to Australia ... My cousin – grandfather might not agree!” His original intention was to let Liang Xiaojun and I follow him so that he could achieve the purpose of learning, training, and observing. If he lets me go to Australia alone, wouldn’t that go against his original intentions?” Liang Qichao paused and continued,””And as far as I know, paddinke ... Uh, Paradise Farm is an investment in my cousin’s name, not an asset under his company. Would he agree to send me there?” “Brother Liang, you don’t have to worry about this,” Xia ruofei said confidently.”I believe that as long as you bring it up, elder Tang will most likely agree.” “Really?” Liang Qichao said in surprise,”ruofei, why are you so confident?” Xia ruofei chuckled.”If you believe me, you can go and tell the old man. You’ll know when the time comes. I’m not lying to you today.” And I promise, as long as you work hard and manage it well, you will never regret going to the Australian farm!” The reason why Xia ruofei was so confident was not because he wanted to talk to elder Tang about Liang Qichao. He had said these words entirely out of an accurate judgment of the entire situation. As the saying went,”concern is confusion”. Liang Qichao could not see the situation clearly. Xia ruofei was a bystander, but he had already analyzed it thoroughly. Xia ruofei and elder Tang had already signed the contract. Now that he was the major shareholder of Paradise Farm, the management team that elder Tang had previously appointed might not be suitable anymore. After all, Xia ruofei was the major shareholder. If he still used the same team, elder Tang would definitely consider Xia ruofei’s feelings and be worried that Xia ruofei would still think that he wanted to control the decision – making of the farm. Therefore, he definitely needed to make some adjustments to the management team. At the very least, he needed to appoint a new person in charge in Australia and let the new person in charge lead the management team. The person in charge had to be someone that both parties could trust, especially Xia ruofei. Liang Qichao was undoubtedly the most suitable candidate. Although elder Tang’s original intention was to let Liang Qichao and Liang Xiaojun start from the bottom, the farm in Australia only had a total of 40 to 50 million USD in assets. In elder Tang’s eyes, it was no different from the small companies he had casually invested in before. Appointing Liang Qichao as the person – in – charge of a small company of this level was already a very low position in elder Tang’s eyes. So, if Liang Qichao were to take the initiative to go to the Australian farm, elder Tang would most likely agree. Liang Qichao gritted his teeth and said,”alright!” I’ll listen to you!” Then, he pondered for a moment and said,””I’d better go to the United States first and then talk to my cousin about this! Anyway, even if he doesn’t agree, I’ll have already escaped from my dad’s evil clutches. At most, I’ll lose to Liang Xiaojun and lose some face!” “Haha!” Xia ruofei laughed.”It seems like your fear of your fiancée far exceeds your desire for freedom!” “Don’t mention the words “yet ...”” Liang Qichao said with an awkward expression,”I get goosebumps when I hear that ...” Xia ruofei raised his head and laughed. He then raised his glass and said,””Come, brother Liang, let me give you a toast to send you off. I wish you a safe journey and a smooth journey in Australia!” “RUO Fei, I’ll take your blessings!” Liang Qichao said,”come on, brother. Cheers!” “Cheers!”
