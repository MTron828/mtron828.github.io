Chapter 1302: Chapter 783 – funds settled (2)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei did some calculations in his heart. According to the price that Mr. Lin had set last time, 500 grams would be 350000 Yuan. 136 kilograms of Cordyceps sinensis would bring in more than 95 million Yuan of income.

Not to mention that the quality of the wormgrass this time was higher than the wormgrass planted in the experiment.

Last time, the 500 grams of wormgrass was almost 1200 wormgrass per kilogram; this batch of wormgrass could reach 1100 wormgrass per kilogram. Zhang tie estimated that the purchase price would be higher.

In that case, the 100 million Yuan gap was no longer a problem!

Xia ruofei was instantly overjoyed. He patted Xia Qing’s shoulder heavily and said,””Well done! Xia Qing, after you’re done processing the remaining 10000 Cordyceps, weigh them accurately and then pack them all in a sealed bag. I’ll need them soon. ”

“Understood!” Xia Qing replied calmly.

“After processing this batch of wormgrass, harvest the remaining wormgrass.” Xia ruofei said,”then, you’ll have to work a little harder. Use the difference in time flow between the two spaces to divide the Cordyceps sinensis garden into a few parts after expansion. It’s best to split it into 12 parts and stagger the harvesting time. This way, the workload every month can be reduced, and there will be a steady stream of output.”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing said.

This matter was a bit complicated to operate, but it wasn’t too difficult for Xia Qing. It was just a little bit of effort.

Xia ruofei wanted to contact Mr. Lin immediately, so he left the spirit map space after a simple tour of the space.

After he returned to his room, he immediately took out his phone and dialed President Lin’s number.

“President Xia!” Mr. Lin’s voice sounded a little excited.”Is the wormgrass ready?”

“Mr. Lin, are you that eager?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“Little brother! It’s fine if you didn’t mention it. I only have this thought every day. Now that I know you’ve got the wormgrass, I’ve been thinking about it all day!” President Lin said exaggeratedly. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it seems like it’s all my fault!” Mr. Lin, I want to ask ... What’s the maximum amount of goods you can purchase with your current authority?”

President Lin was stunned for a moment and then overjoyed.

Xia ruofei’s question meant that there might be more goods this time.

As for the products of the peach blossom company, whether it was the wild ginseng from before, or the long – term cooperation with the iron – skinned fengdou, or the small amount of Cordyceps, all of them were the best of the best. Such good things, the more the better for Tongren Hall!

President Lin said hurriedly,”President Xia, no matter how much stock there is, we can take it all. Even if I don’t have the authority, I can ask headquarters for the transfer immediately!” The Paradise corporation’s brand is a guarantee of quality. This has already been agreed upon at our headquarters!”

Xia ruofei jokingly asked,”is it that exaggerated?” Then if I take out a few hundred million worth of goods at once, can you buy them all at once?”

President Lin felt that he was having difficulty breathing. He asked in shock,””A few hundred million?”

Then, he gritted his teeth and said,”even if it’s a few hundred million, we’ll take it all!” However, the process might be a little more complicated. ”

The quality of paradise corporation’s products was simply too high. Even if they bought it in large quantities in one go, it would be better than having their competitors buy it. President Lin believed that the headquarters would definitely have the same considerations.

Xia ruofei laughed.”Don’t be nervous, President Lin. I’m just making an analogy. Although it’s not a few hundred million, it’s possible for it to be tens of millions or even more than a hundred million!”

“No problem!” President Lin immediately heaved a sigh of relief and said,”our East China district’s authority can reach up to 100 million. If it’s a little more, we’ll just have to call and ask for instructions. There’s definitely no problem!”

“That’s good!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”CEO Lin, if it’s convenient, please come to Taoyuan farm tomorrow! It’s best to bring a few more people ...”

“Good, good, good! I’ll book the earliest ticket for tomorrow!” President Lin said in a hurry.

“Alright, send me your flight number after you’ve made the reservation. I’ll arrange for someone to pick you up!” Xia ruofei said.

“Then I’ll have to trouble President Xia!” President Lin said politely.

“You don’t have to be so formal, you’re here to give me money!” Xia ruofei joked.

“Hehe, it’s a win – win situation for both of us!” President Lin laughed.

Xia ruofei also smiled and said,”yes, yes, it’s a win – win situation!” A win – win situation!”

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei felt relaxed. 350 million sounded like a lot of money, but after some calculation, it would be gathered in no time.

From another perspective, this also showed that the current development speed of the Paradise pharmaceutical company was simply astonishing, especially the emergence of the jadeshi ointment, which turned the Paradise pharmaceutical factory into a huge cash cow.

If it wasn’t for the fact that bojun real estate was in a hurry to get the money, Xia ruofei wouldn’t even need to use the funds from the sale of the wormgrass. It would be enough to do a few more concentrated sales of the Yushi ointment.

The jaded skin cream had become an absolutely popular product this year. Its price – Performance ratio could be said to be unprecedented and unprecedented. Moreover, this kind of consumable was not a one – time deal. He believed that more than half of the users who had used the jaded skin cream would choose to continue to buy and use it.

In other words, the production of jaded skin ointment was far from reaching its peak, and the supply in short supply might continue for some time.

After a while, Xia ruofei received a WeChat message from CEO Lin. The six of them were taking a flight at 8 am the next day and would arrive at Sanshan airport at around 10 am.

Xia ruofei immediately gave ye Lingyun a call and asked him to send someone to rent a Toyota Coaster tomorrow. He would then head to the airport to pick them up in the morning.

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei was thinking that it was time to buy more cars for the company, such as commercial vehicles and bus – based Coster.

In the future, after the company’s headquarters moved, some employees might still live on the farm for a period of time until they found a place to live in the city. By then, there would still be a need for commuting.

However, the acquisition had almost emptied the company’s foundation, so the plan to buy a car could only be pushed back and considered when the cash flow was more abundant.

With the money problem solved, Xia ruofei had a good night’s sleep.

The next day, he began to slack off again. After getting up and practicing as usual, he went back to sleep. It was not until nineo’ clock in the morning that he got up and washed up. Then, he went downstairs to make a simple breakfast.

It was almost Teno’ clock when they finished eating. Xia ruofei then walked to the general office building.

“Chairman, the colleague who picked us up said that the plane is late.” Feng Jing knocked on the door and entered.”President Lin and the others might be half an hour late.”

Xia ruofei nodded and agreed. Oh right, ask the canteen to prepare a table of food and wine. We’re going to entertain President Lin this afternoon. ”

“I’ve already given the order this morning. ” Feng Jing asked curiously,”Chairman, why is CEO Lin here?” Isn’t the deal with Kaede ito normal?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”him?” They’re here to give us money! Don’t we still have a 100 million gap in funds to buy the building? Whether or not this gap can be filled will depend on today. ”

“A hundred million?” Feng Rao was shocked. Did we get something good again?”

That was Feng Jing’s first reaction. Of course, her first reaction was rather accurate.

Xia ruofei kept her in suspense and said,””You don’t have to worry about that. Just get the finance department to be ready to collect the money!”

He added,”by the way, I’ve settled the 100 million here very quickly. You can’t drop the ball for the remaining 250 million!” Especially the distributors, you have to communicate well with them. If they stand us up, we might breach the contract with bojun real estate!”

“Understood!” Feng Jing said,”I’ll contact them again to confirm!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said.

After Feng Jing left, Xia ruofei locked the door and started to contact the spirit map space ...
