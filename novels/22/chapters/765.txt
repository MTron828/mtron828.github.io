Chapter 766: Xiao hei’s Meritorious Service (1)

Blackie ran very quickly, but Xia ruofei, Guo Zhan, and Tian Feilong were all battle – hardened Special Forces elites and could easily keep up.

Liang Qiming’s laboratory was located in a corner of the campus. There were not many people passing by, so no one noticed the strange scene of three people running wildly with a dog.

However, Blackie stopped after running for about 200 meters. It sniffed in place, as if it was hesitating, not sure which direction to go.

Tian Feilong was slightly breathless. With a disappointed look on his face, he said,”The police dog sent by the Special Forces yesterday also lost its target when it reached this position. Well ... Little black is more than ten meters ahead of the police dog yesterday.”

Xia ruofei said calmly,”it’s possible that the group of people used some method to cover up their scent nearby. But don’t worry, they can’t cover it completely. The smell of the chemical reagents on professor Liang’s body is very strong. Blackie is still working hard!”

“It’s up to little black to see if we can find any useful clues, Blood Wolf ...”Guo Zhan nodded.

The three of them watched Blackie’s movements closely. Blackie hesitated for about half a minute, then finally decided on a direction and continued to run.

But this time, he wasn’t as sure as he was at the back door of the laboratory. He ran a little slower and stopped from time to time to sniff to determine the direction. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Xia ruofei and the other two followed closely behind Blackie. They stopped and walked along the way. Blackie’s speed was getting slower and slower. It was obvious that its scent was fading.

During this period, they had changed directions several times. He felt that the group’s route was completely irregular, and sometimes they even took a short detour.

Just like that, they walked for another 100 meters before Blackie stopped.

In front of it was a manhole cover. It sniffed around the cover for a long time, walked around it a few times, and whimpered at the cover.

Xia ruofei, Guo Zhan, and Tian Feilong looked at each other and said,””Wolf King, it seems that the group of people entered the sewer from here yesterday.”

......

“It’s very likely.” Tian Feilong nodded and said,”there are many surveillance cameras in the campus, including several cameras at the school gate, but none of them have captured the whereabouts of this group. I can’t think of any other way for them except to escape underground!”

After saying that, Tian Feilong came to the manhole cover and squatted down. After carefully examining it for a while, he raised his head and said,”It should be right! This cover was obviously opened and put back in recently, and it doesn’t match the old marks!”

Tian Feilong was also an expert in the field of vestige science. After the manhole cover was opened, even if it was carefully put back, it was impossible to be in the exact same position as before it was opened. Even if there was the slightest deviation, it would leave behind traces.

“Go! Let’s go down and continue tracking!” Xia ruofei said without hesitation.

Guo Zhan stretched out his hand to stop him, saying,”Blood Wolf, let me call the other comrades over first. It’s too dangerous to go down like this!”

Tian Feilong was a little puzzled and asked,”Captain, it’s been nearly 20 hours. Would those people still be hiding in the sewers?” That’s not possible, is it?”

“It’s not impossible. We can’t fight an unprepared war!”Guo Zhan said seriously. Yesterday’s lesson was already profound enough. I don’t want any more comrades to bleed and die!”

It seemed that the death of squad leader old Luo had a great impact on Guo Zhan. In Xia ruofei and Tian Feilong’s eyes, Guo Zhan was a little too cautious.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”Fei Long, the wolf King has a point.” The most dangerous place is the safest. This group of people might have taken advantage of our psychological blind spots and hid in a corner of the campus for the first few days ...”

Guo Zhan heard that Xia ruofei agreed with his point of view, so he nodded and prepared to take out his secret phone to contact the other team members.

However, Xia ruofei suddenly changed the topic and continued,””Wolf King, I think we can’t drag this out. It’s possible that those people are still hiding in the sewers, but it’s very small. We can’t delay the opportunity because of a small probability. Besides, we’re well prepared this time, so we won’t be caught off guard like yesterday, don’t you think?”

After he finished speaking, Xia ruofei looked at Guo Zhan quietly, waiting for him to make a decision.

Now that Xia ruofei had been summoned back to the Army, he still had the official document in his arms! From a legal point of view, Xia ruofei had regained his identity as a soldier. If Xia ruofei met with any mishaps in this mission, he would be considered a soldier who had sacrificed himself in the war. The military flag could be stamped at the memorial service and he would be awarded the title of revolutionary martyr without a doubt.

However, since he had restored his status as a corporal of the lone wolf assault team, he would naturally have to accept the leadership of the highest commander of the lone wolf assault team, Guo Zhan. If Guo Zhan insisted on not going down the well, Xia ruofei could not disobey the order.

Guo Zhan stared at the manhole cover, his expression changing. He was obviously weighing Xia ruofei’s suggestion. Xia ruofei and Tian Feilong stood quietly at the side and did not interfere with Guo Zhan’s thinking.

After a long while, Guo Zhan nodded and said,”Alright! Let’s go down first! But now that we have new clues, the other comrades must hurry over as well. I’ll contact them first, and then we’ll go down the well!”
