1990 Departure (2)

“Not bad, not bad!” Xia ruofei said.

“Brother Xia, do you want to go to the construction site to take a look? He’s been at the construction site since yesterday and hasn’t returned home. ” Lei Hu asked as he stared at the road.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”no, I’m going back.” Since I’ve handed the work over to Xue Jinshan, I must have absolute trust in Him!”

Actually, Xia ruofei was not in the mood to care about the construction of the pharmaceutical factory. He was most worried about Monica and could not wait to fly to Italy.

However, Zhao Yongjun didn’t reply to him. Even if he was anxious, he didn’t use the system. In fact, it had only been two hours. No matter how powerful Zhao Yongjun was, it was impossible for him to settle everything in such a short time.

After returning to the farm villa, Xia ruofei played with little black and the others in the yard for a while. Now, whenever Xia ruofei was not at home, ye Lingyun would personally come over to feed little black and the others.

With Monica’s matter on his mind, Xia ruofei let Blackie and the rest play in the yard while he carried his small suitcase into the villa.

After arriving at his room on the second floor, Xia ruofei first turned on his computer and checked his email.

He didn’t receive a new email from old Blake, but an email from an overseas bank.

With Xia ruofei’s current level of English, listening, reading, and writing were basically no problem for him. Naturally, it was not difficult for him to read such an email.

The mail from the bank was actually a reminder of the change in balance.

After the auction, Xia ruofei’s overseas account had a few more transactions. The bank had also sent an email to inform him immediately.

The 100 million dollars from the auction had all been transferred to the overseas account. Hengfeng group had only received a symbolic fee of two million dollars. Another ten million dollars had been transferred to the company’s account. Xia ruofei had actually received more than 88 million dollars.

There was also the truffles sold to the corner Western restaurant chain and the black family. In addition to the one million euros deposit from a few days ago, he had earned nearly two million euros in total.

Xia ruofei took a look. The funds in his overseas account were close to 250 million US dollars. If converted to Chinese dollars, it would be a few billion.

However, Xia ruofei would not exchange them for Chinese yuan. It was more convenient to put them in an overseas account.

After checking his bank information, Xia ruofei turned off his computer. Since he did not receive any information about the Gehrman family and Toles from old Blake, he was not in the mood to do anything else.

He simply went to take a shower, then went to bed to take an afternoon nap. He checked out and left not long after lunch today, so he didn’t take an afternoon nap at all.

When Xia ruofei woke up, it was already dark outside. This time, he had slept for more than two hours.

If not for the phone ringing, Xia ruofei might have slept for a long time.

He rubbed his drowsy eyes and used his mental power. The phone on the bedside table immediately floated up and slowly floated toward his hand.

Xia ruofei caught the phone and glanced at the caller ID. When he saw that it was Zhao Yongjun, his remaining sleepiness immediately disappeared. He swiped the screen and answered the call.

“Big brother Zhao!” Xia ruofei said.

“Ruofei, I’ve settled your matter for you!” Zhao Yongjun said,”the full set of ID documents, including the database of the GA Department, have all been updated! I owe you a lot of favors, so you have to compensate me with some good wine!”

“That’s great!” Xia ruofei said happily,”brother Zhao, isn’t it easy to drink? I’ll bring you some good wine tomorrow!”

“Mm! You’re going to Beijing. In addition to picking up these identity documents, you have to go to the Italy Embassy. ” Zhao Yongjun laughed and said,”I’ve already contacted the Embassy. When the time comes, you just need to bring the information and go to the Embassy!”

“Alright! Big brother Zhao is so reassuring!” After Xia ruofei threw out the high hat that said it was free, he said,”brother Zhao, I’ll fly to the capital city tomorrow morning. Don’t worry, I won’t be able to find your good wine!”

“I was waiting for you to say that!” Zhao Yongjun laughed and said,”after you’ve booked the ticket, send me the flight details. I’ll pick you up at the airport!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Brother Zhao, I might not be able to give you the flight details. I don’t plan to take a commercial flight to the capital.”

“You’re not taking the plane?” Zhao Yongjun was a little surprised.”Then why did you come? Take the high – speed rail? Could it be that boss Xia wants to experience the speed of our high – speed rail in China?”

“Hahaha!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”there’s no need to pick me up. I’ll get Wuqiang to go. Let’s meet in the capital tomorrow!”

“Alright!” Zhao Yongjun said.

After hanging up, Xia ruofei clenched his fists in excitement. He didn’t expect Zhao Yongjun to be so efficient. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

However, this was also good. He could reach Monica’s side at a faster speed.

Xia ruofei immediately gave Liu An a call and asked him to apply for a flight route today. They would fly to the capital the next morning.

Then, Xia ruofei took out the small suitcase from the closet. He had not taken out the things in it yet, and now it was time to use them.

Xia ruofei’s luggage was more of a cover. In fact, everything he needed was stored in the spirit map space.

He couldn’t help but check his mailbox again, but old Blake still didn’t send him any information about the Grasso family, the Gelman family, or Toles.

Thus, he went downstairs to cook a bowl of noodles for himself to make do with his dinner.

It was a quiet night.

The next morning, Xia ruofei asked Lei Hu to drive him to the airport.

On the way, Xia ruofei called Ling Qingxue and Feng Rao to tell them that he had to fly to Beijing again.

Naturally, Ling Qingxue would not interfere with Xia ruofei’s matters. However, Xia ruofei was not at home. Because there was no condition for joint training, her cultivation speed would slow down by a large margin. Thus, she was a little unhappy.

As for Feng Jing, she was already used to Xia ruofei being a hands – off boss, so she only grumbled a little. After all, the company was getting busier and busier recently, and she had spent most of her energy on dealing with the media and reporters.

After arriving at the airport, Xia ruofei passed through the security checkpoint of the small building next to the terminal with ease and quickly got on the Gulfstream G650 business jet.

The flight from Sanshan to Beijing was very smooth. The traffic control at Beijing’s airport was not serious today. After more than two hours, the plane landed safely at Beijing International Airport.

After the plane stabilized, Xia ruofei went to the cockpit.

“Captain Liu, I’ll be staying in Beijing for a long time.” Xia ruofei said,”you guys rest in Beijing for a day, then fly back to Sanshan with the flight crew! I probably won’t be using a plane in the near future, so you guys can also take a vacation to relax!”

If he were to travel to Italy, Xia ruofei would definitely choose to travel by plane. The Gulfstream G650 was fully refueled, and it was enough for the plane to fly from the Sanshan to Italy. There was no need for any landing to refuel along the way. However, this time, he was likely to have a head – on conflict with the Italian mafia, so naturally, he could not take the plane.

Otherwise, if something big happened and Xia ruofei entered Italy on a private jet, it would be very easy for them to trace back to Xia ruofei.

“Alright!” Liu An quickly replied.

Li Yifu’s Kyushu group had rented a parking space at Sanshan airport and had also ordered some other maintenance and maintenance services. Sanshan airport was equivalent to the base airport of the business jet. If Xia ruofei really did not use a plane for a few days, then the plane would naturally fly back to San Shan airport to be stationed. That would be the most economical way.

Xia ruofei bade Liu An and the others farewell and left the tarmac alone with her luggage.

After walking out of the Forbidden Zone, Xia ruofei saw Wu Qiang who had been waiting there in advance.
