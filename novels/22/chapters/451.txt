Chapter 452: The beautiful County Head (3)

Wu Liqian then added,””Of course, the short – term impact is inevitable.”

Xia ruofei felt that it made more sense.

Ling Qingxue had been a little worried at first, but after hearing Wu Liqian’s words, that worry disappeared.

The lingji F & B had already gotten out of its most difficult stage and was now in a period of development. Not only had it set foot in the hotel industry, but it had also begun to open branch stores in Prefecture – Level cities. It had even gotten the title of a designated reception unit of the municipal Party Committee. It was the time of prosperity. If they adopted a level system like Wu Liqian had said, even if it was affected in the short term, it would definitely not be a serious blow.

Xia ruofei nodded.”Sis Wu is right. Why don’t I get in touch with director ruan from the Dong Keng village and expand the farm?”

Whether it was the new land or the new greenhouse according to the original standards, it would cost a lot of money. However, the money did not need to be taken out all at once. Besides, Xia ruofei earned hundreds of thousands of Yuan every month just by relying on Taoyuan vegetables. He could totally claim land first, then gradually add vegetable greenhouses and expand the production capacity step by step.

“I can help you talk to the people in the town and village,” Wu Liqian said.”There shouldn’t be any resistance.”

“Then I’ll have to thank sis Wu. There definitely won’t be a problem if you personally take care of it!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”actually, I’m just lazy. I’m having a headache thinking about renegotiating the lease contract, looking for people to build the greenhouse, and recruiting new workers!”

“That’s the second suggestion I’m going to give you,”Wu Liqian said with a smile.

“There’s a second suggestion!” Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”sis Wu, tell me! RUO Fei belongs to the type of person who moves with every lash of the whip. He’s very lazy!”

Xia ruofei smiled helplessly. He felt very innocent about Ling Qingxue’s comment.

“Qingxue, my second suggestion is to make it easier for Xiao Xia,” Wu Liqian said with a smile.

Then, Wu Liqian turned to Xia ruofei and said,”Xia, you should set up the company’s framework as soon as possible and leave the management to the professional managers. This is also an inevitable trend. With the development of your company, the evaluation and recruitment of personnel should be managed by someone! “You would need a Human Resources Department, and you would have to go to court if there were contract disputes or infringement of rights when you were discussing contracts with your partners, right? You need to have a legal department, as well as finance, sales, and so on. If there’s a dedicated manager in charge of every work, and a few capable general managers and deputy general managers, you don’t have to take care of everything by yourself. As the boss, you just have to grasp the general direction!”

Ling Qingxue was very much in favor of this. Her family owned a company, and it was a very large food and beverage chain. Naturally, she was very experienced in company management.

However, Ling Qingxue was also a little hesitant as she said,””Sis Wu, the expenses will be much higher this way!”

Wu Liqian said with a smile,”we can set up the framework first. We don’t even have to rent an office building. We can work in this building for the time being. We can slowly recruit more people as the company develops. Actually, the expenses won’t be too high.”

“Hmm, that makes sense.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’m very interested in suggestions that can make me lazy. But ... I don’t know where to find the General Manager and vice general manager! Chubby boy can be the Chief Financial Officer, but the legal department, the Human Resources Department, and the sales department all need someone with the relevant work experience!”

“Ruofei, there are quite a few headhunting companies right now. You can use them to recruit people,” Ling Qingxue said.

“Qingxue’s right,”Wu Liqian nodded and said,”it’s a good idea to go through a headhunting company. Also ... I have a good candidate on my side. She’s my college classmate with good work experience and qualifications. She just recently resigned. ”

Xia ruofei said hesitantly,”sis Wu, your classmates should all be successful people with successful careers now, right?” Would you be willing to work for a small company like mine?”

“I can help build a bridge. You guys can meet up and get to know each other.” Wu Liqian said,”she’s free anyway. I’ll call her. She’ll definitely come.” I’m not sure if she’s willing to stay and work. ”

“Alright! Then I’ll have to trouble sis Wu to contact them and arrange for us to meet up in the next few days. ” Xia ruofei said,”let’s meet here! At the same time, I can also observe the working environment. ”

“No problem!” Wu Liqian nodded.

After that, Wu Liqian stood up and said with a smile,””Alright, I should go back. I’ll be annoying if I stay here ...”

Ling Qingxue blushed and said,””Sis Wu, we won’t despise you!”

Xia ruofei also laughed and said,”that’s right, my farm is still in your land.” I wouldn’t dare to look down on you!”

“I really have to go. There’s still a lot of work to do in the county!” Wu Liqian said with a smile.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue sent her to the door, but she didn’t allow them to do so.

“Alright, you guys don’t have to come out. I can go down myself.” Wu Liqian said.

Xia ruofei did not insist. He watched Wu Liqian walk to the stairs before returning to the office with Ling Qingxue and closing the door behind them.

He didn’t feel anything when Wu Liqian was around, but now that they were alone, an ambiguous atmosphere began to fill the air.

Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei affectionately. Xia ruofei also felt a ball of fire burning in his heart. They had not been together for three days. For a man and a woman who were in love, this was a very long time.

Xia ruofei looked at Ling Qingxue and smiled evilly.””Qingxue, we ... I don’t think we’ve done it in the office before ...”

Ling Qingxue’s face turned pale and she shouted,””No, go ... Go back to your villa ...” She said.

Before she could finish her sentence, Xia ruofei’s lips were blocked by his domineering kiss ...
