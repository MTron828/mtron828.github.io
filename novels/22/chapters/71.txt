Chapter 72: My first kiss (1)

Xia ruofei had indeed given it his all to prepare a sumptuous lunch. The main ingredients were naturally Taoyuan vegetables from the spirit map space. There were also some meat dishes that he had bought from the supermarket when he went to Changping County yesterday. When the two of them were eating, Xia ruofei had prepared seven to eight dishes. With the unique ingredients, even though Xia ruofei’s cooking skills were only passable, the dishes he made still looked, smelled, and tasted great. Especially the ingredients, they were fresh and tender, which made people hungry. Xia ruofei laid out the dishes in the dining room and called for her twice before Ling Qingxue reluctantly put down the plate of all – Creation brocade and went to the dining room to eat. However, the attraction of the peach Garden vegetables quickly diverted Ling Qingxue’s attention. “Mm! It’s so delicious!” Ling Qingxue spoke as she ate, not caring about her image as a lady. Xia ruofei smiled and gave Ling Qingxue some food. He said,””Eat slowly, no one here is snatching it from you!” “Yes, yes ... You should eat too!” Ling Qingxue said. Only then did Xia ruofei pick up his bowl and start eating. He had been eating these vegetables every day, but he did not feel as strongly about it as Ling Qingxue. However, the delicious Peach Garden vegetables still greatly increased his appetite. Ling Qingxue picked up a small piece of cabbage and put it in her mouth. After chewing it carefully, she revealed a surprised expression and said,””This little cabbage seems to be a little different from the other dishes! Hmm...The taste is even more delicious and the texture is much better!” Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, but he quickly remembered that the cabbage was planted in the spirit map space to test the effect of the petal solution. The cabbage seeds had been soaked in the diluted petal solution, so it might have undergone some kind of mutation. He also took a bite of the cabbage and put it in his mouth. Sure enough, it felt slightly different from ordinary vegetables from paradise. The crisp texture and the delicious taste that made one’s teeth taste delicious were all memorable. Ling Qingxue put down her chopsticks and said,”I don’t think there’s any cabbage among the vegetables you supply to our company, right?” Tell me the truth, what’s going on?” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”what else could it be?” This little cabbage is our latest developed species. We only brought a few samples over today! I was thinking of trying it out, but I didn’t expect it to taste so good ...” Ling Qingxue’s eyes lit up and she said,”another new item!” I don’t care, you have to give priority to our company’s supply of this little cabbage!” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”This is really in the research and development stage. We’ve only brought a few samples today.” “Then when can we get the goods?” Ling Qingxue persevered and asked,”I don’t need too much. Just like the other vegetables, 20 to 30 catties a day shouldn’t be a problem, right?” “At least ten days!” Xia ruofei said after some thought. “Alright! Ten days it is!” Ling Qingxue said,”in ten days, our company will be the first to receive this cabbage.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”don’t worry!” But let me make this clear first! The cabbages we ate today were cultivated under the careful care of the laboratory. The quality of the mass – produced products may be slightly worse than this ...” Xia ruofei wanted to gradually plant them in the outside world. When the time came, the first batch of cabbage would be from the batch that was grown in the backyard. Although they had also been soaked in the petal solution, the outside environment was not like the spirit map space. The quality of the vegetables would definitely be reduced. He was also giving Ling Qingxue a heads – up in case her expectations were too high. “It doesn’t matter. I know it won’t be too bad.” Ling Qingxue said,”when I get back, I’ll ask my father to change the contract and add the supply of cabbage.” “Alright, you decide!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. He didn’t even mention the price, and he was completely at ease with Ling Qingxue. Ling Qingxue was very satisfied with this lunch. After eating, the two of them went out for a walk to digest their food. The vegetables in the peach Garden were simply too delicious, and Ling Qingxue was a little full. The two of them chatted as they walked. “Ruofei, when are you going to start your vegetable base?” Ling Qingxue asked,”now that your business has started, if you don’t build your vegetable base as soon as possible, it will still be a small business!” “I’ve been thinking about it, but I don’t have any leads yet!”Xia ruofei said. “Yup! “Starting from zero is indeed a complicated thing ...” Ling Qingxue sighed. Then, she looked at the barren land in front of the villa, and her eyes suddenly lit up.””Actually, this place is pretty good! You see ... Although the land in front of and behind your villa is deserted, it’s very flat. If you use large machinery for construction, it won’t be difficult to build a farm. This piece of land ... Was at least twenty to thirty mu! The early stage was definitely enough! Moreover, there was the sea in front and a mountain forest behind. If they rented it together, it would not be a problem to develop fruit tree planting or marine breeding in the future! By the way, I saw an abandoned pond when I came here. It’s okay to keep fish!” Hearing this, Xia ruofei’s mind started to wander. He took a closer look and realized that it was true. Other than the fact that the land was overgrown with weeds and a little barren, it was the perfect place to build a vegetable base. And with the spiritual pond water and the petal solution, the barren land was not a problem at all! Moreover, there was a road next to it, so he didn’t even have to worry about transportation problems. It was simply tailor – made! If they really took over this land, it would not be as simple as a vegetable base. Xia ruofei had the spirit map space, and there were countless possibilities for his future development. Those priceless flowers, trees, the world’s best food ingredients, extremely expensive medicinal herbs ... All of these needed a base as a fulcrum. This place was undoubtedly very suitable as the starting point of his career. “Qingxue, what you said makes sense!” Xia ruofei said excitedly,”I’ll find out where this land belongs to and find a way to rent it!” “En!” Ling Qingxue was very happy that her idea had helped Xia ruofei. She thought for a while and said,”Oh right, when you’re doing construction work, you can directly look for Liang Qichao.” His family is in the real estate development business, so he has a construction team and construction machinery ready. When the time comes, ask him to find a designer to help you plan!” “Alright!” Xia ruofei said happily,”Qingxue, you’re a Lucky Star! You’ve helped me solve a problem that has been bothering me for a long time!” Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”then you have to thank me properly!” You owe me another meal ... No! How about two meals?” “No problem!” Xia ruofei readily agreed.”Whenever you want to eat Taoyuan vegetables, just come up!” “En!” Ling Qingxue nodded happily. The two of them chatted as they walked. They walked around the villa and took a good look at the piece of land. Then, they walked back to the villa to check on Ling Qingxue. After all, she still had work to do and it was time to leave. Back at the villa, Ling Qingxue went over and carefully carried the pot of nature brocade and walked out. Xia ruofei wanted to help but couldn ‘T. He had to carry it himself. As she walked to the door, Ling Qingxue did not see the small aluminum alloy door sill at the door because of the flower pot blocking her view. She tripped on it and couldn’t help but let out a cry of surprise. Her whole body fell forward, and the pot of all – Nature brocade flew out of her hand. Xia ruofei was right beside Ling Qingxue. His reaction speed was far beyond that of ordinary people. The moment Ling Qingxue tripped over the door frame, his body had already moved as fast as lightning. A hand firmly held the bottom of the flower pot, and then gently turned a circle, using the force – unloading technique of Tai Chi to stop the forward momentum of the flower pot. The flower pot seemed to be stuck to his palm. His other hand was tightly wrapped around Ling Qingxue’s slender waist. Ling Qingxue’s face was still filled with fear, but she realized that she did not fall. Instead, she was being held tightly in Xia ruofei’s arms. At this moment, her body was being pulled by Xia ruofei, and she was leaning back slightly. Xia ruofei was also leaning forward, and their faces were almost touching. Ling Qingxue’s heart skipped a beat, and her face turned red. Under the warm winter sun, Xia ruofei’s face seemed to be covered with a layer of radiance. He asked with concern, “Are you alright?” However, Xia ruofei did not realize how intimate their current position was. Ling Qingxue’s heart was beating fast. She looked at Xia ruofei’s face, which was so close to her, and did something very bold. She reached out and held the back of Xia ruofei’s head, then pressed her tender red lips against Xia ruofei ‘s. No matter how fast Xia ruofei’s reaction was, he did not expect such a situation. He could not avoid it. He was stunned, as if he had been electrocuted. His eyes were wide open, and the two of them looked at each other at such a close distance. Xia ruofei felt two wet and soft lips pressed against his own. It was a wonderful feeling, as if an electric current had passed through his body. However, this strange feeling didn’t last long. Ling Qingxue quickly let go of him. At that moment, Ling Qingxue’s pretty face was as red as a ripe apple. She was like a frightened deer as she quickly walked towards the Porsche 911 that she had parked in the villa’s yard. Xia ruofei was still standing there like a statue. Ling Qingxue was walking halfway when she suddenly turned back. She looked shy and did not even dare to look at Xia ruofei. She took the flower pot from Xia ruofei’s hand and got into the car as if she was escaping. Before Xia ruofei could return to her senses, Ling Qingxue had already driven away in her Porsche 911. Xia ruofei touched his fragrant lips, still in a daze from what had happened. I was actually forced to kiss by this girl? Xia ruofei felt like he was in a dream. After a while, he shouted in grief and indignation,” “Ling Qingxue! This is my first kiss ...” [PS: today is Chinese Valentine’s Day. I especially offer brother Xia’s first kiss. I wish the lovers a happy ending and that the single dog will get rid of his single soon! Steel gun went on a date!
