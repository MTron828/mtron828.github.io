2211 Meeting_” I really didn’t ...” Song Wei said shyly, ” Qingxue, I’ll tell you the truth! The reason why I was so eager to get rid of the peach blossom miasma was that I had made up my mind to stay far away from RUO Fei. I didn’t want to destroy the relationship between you two ...”

Ling Qingxue raised her eyebrows in surprise and asked, ” “Why do you say that? ”

Song Wei sighed and said, ” To be honest, I do have a good impression of RUO Fei. He saved my life back then, and I was grateful to him from the start. As we interacted more and more, I unconsciously developed a good impression of him ...”

Ling Qingxue had gradually accepted this fact, so she didn’t overreact when she heard this. She only said indifferently, ” ” That’s why you’re so concerned about him. He’s going to explore the ancient tomb, and you’re going with him despite the danger? ”

Song Wei nodded her head in embarrassment, but she continued to explain, ” “You know what happened after that. The main reason for the accident was that I was too eager for success. I was in a hurry to get rid of the peach blossom miasma because I wanted to cut off my relationship with RUO Fei as soon as possible. I wanted to get far away from him and gradually forget him ... You may not know this, but after cultivating the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” for a long time, the soul Frequency of the two people who practice together tend to be the same, and the resonance between the souls will be stronger. The more I stay by RUO Fei’s side, the stronger my feelings for him will be. ” At that time, you happened to go to Beijing and attend the groundbreaking ceremony of The Peach Blossom Spring Gathering with ruofei. I also saw the photo of the two of you on Weibo and so many netizens left comments saying that the two of you were a match made in heaven ... My heart was even more tormented. After a long struggle in my mind, I decided to take the risk to remove the peach blossom miasma in advance. I didn’t expect that something like that would happen ...”

Song Wei said everything in one breath and felt much more relaxed. She looked at the screen and said sincerely, “Qingxue, I didn’t even tell RUO Fei about this, so I won’t hide anything from you today ... I know that I caused all of this, and I don’t expect you to forgive me. But please don’t blame RUO Fei, he really didn’t know, it’s all my fault! Don’t worry, now that my sea of consciousness has been cleared and my body no longer has any hidden dangers, it doesn’t matter whether I cultivate or not. I won’t disturb you guys again in the future. I hope that in the long years to come, you will be able to help each other and be happy forever!”

After saying that, a trace of sadness flashed in Song Wei’s eyes and she reached for the hang-up button on the screen.

At that moment, Ling Qingxue suddenly called out, ” “Wait!”

Song Wei’s hand stopped at the top of the screen. She looked at Ling Qingxue on the screen and waited for her to continue.

Ling Qingxue bit her lower lip and said coldly after a long while,””Some things can’t be clearly explained over the phone. Let’s find a time to talk face to face! Can you come to the three mountains?”

Song Wei was stunned for a moment before she nodded.”Good! I’ll try my best to follow ...”

“That’s it then, goodbye!” Ling Qingxue didn’t wait for Song Wei to finish her sentence. She said this coldly and hung up the video call.

……

Yunan Province.

At the foot of a barren mountain.

There were several large tents set up here, and staff members came in and out from time to time.

A half – collapsed tomb had been found not long ago. It should have been dug by grave robbers in the early stage. Later, the rain continued to erode, causing the collapse of the tomb.

The archeological team had been at the site for some time. Their main task was to carry out a rescue excavation of the tomb. Now, the work was in the final stage.

Song Wei was one of the members of this team. Her job was to be an assistant to her postgraduate tutor, sorting out pictures and text materials. It was also because she had almost lost her life in the ancient tomb of Mount Yu that the teacher rarely asked her to go to the scene in person. She spent most of her time working in the tent.

Song Wei had video – called Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue on a Ridge not far from the tent.

After Ling Qingxue hung up the video call, Song Wei didn’t know what to do. She didn’t know what Ling Qingxue’s attitude was.

However, since Ling Qingxue wanted to talk to her face to face, she would definitely go and meet her.

Not only did he want to meet her, but the sooner the better.

Therefore, after Song Wei put away her phone, she immediately went to the biggest tent in the camp.

Many staff members were busy in the tent. An old man with reading glasses was talking to several staff members.

The old man was professor Zhao, Song Wei’s postgraduate tutor.

“Professor.” Song Wei walked up to professor Zhao and greeted him respectfully.

“Song Wei is here!” Professor Zhao greeted him with a pleasant smile.

“Professor, I need to talk to you about something.” Song Wei said.

“Oh?” professor Zhao smiled. Let’s talk outside!”

He could tell that Song Wei was trying to avoid the staff. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The two of them walked out of the tent side by side. Before professor Zhao could ask, Song Wei said,””Professor, I have something urgent to attend to at home. I was thinking ... Can I take a few days off?”

“That’s it!”Professor Zhao replied readily. No problem! Anyway, the work here is almost done, so you can go first! You can just meet us at school ...”
