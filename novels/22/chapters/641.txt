Chapter 642: Chapter 462 – advancing side – by – side_1

Most of Feng Jing’s energy was invested in the registration of Taoyuan pharmaceutical company.

She knew that Xia ruofei placed great importance on this matter, so she tried to be efficient. She even found her old classmate, Wu Liqian, and used her connections in the city to speed up the approval process.

Tian Huixin was still helping to gather the second batch of children with autism who were receiving treatment.

Besides providing Chengcheng with the heart – nourishing soup on time, Xia ruofei’s main energy was focused on the transformation of the farm’s fish pond.

Feng Jing already had a lot of things to do, so Xia ruofei didn’t let her do it this time. Instead, he did it himself, which was rare.

Xia ruofei went to find his future father – in – Law, Ling Xiaotian.

When Ling Xiaotian heard that Xia ruofei was going to try to cultivate wild pomfrets, he was very happy. He immediately mobilized his connections to help Xia ruofei.

Luo Ming, the executive chef of Ling Ji restaurant, was from Jiangnan. In his hometown, there were people who had tried to artificially cultivate pomfrets, but most of them were fertilised eggs from the United States at a high price, then put the fertilised eggs in oxygen bags and transported back by air.

But no matter what, there were still many people who had experience in raising pomfrets.

In the end, it was Luo Ming who had helped Xia ruofei find a suitable candidate.

The man’s name was Jiang Hua, a distant relative of Luo Ming. He used to work at the pomfrets farm for a long time and even became the deputy manager later. He had rich experience in the breeding and management of pomfrets.

However, due to poor management and the boss ‘other failed investments, the farm didn’t manage to operate in the end, and Jiang Hua lost his job.

Xia ruofei immediately asked Luo Ming to call Jiang Hua and ask him to come for an interview at the three mountains.

......

After Jiang Hua lost his job, he did not have a stable job. He was not very happy working in several places. The salary was not as high as before, and it was even more tiring. So, when he heard that a boss in the southeast province wanted to raise Chinese perch and was willing to hire him, he immediately quit his job and took the train South.

Xia ruofei talked to Jiang Hua for a while and found out that he knew a lot about the pomfrets. He even had management experience. He immediately decided to hire him.

Jiang Hua was on the same level as Cao tieshu in Tao Yuan farm, so their salary and benefits were the same. However, Xia ruofei also promised that as long as the sales of the pomfrets were good, the monthly performance reward would be higher than the salary.

In short, the better the results, the better the treatment.

In fact, the salary in the southeast coastal area was higher than that in the Inland cities. Moreover, the farm offered relatively good free accommodation, and a single person could enjoy a single room. The treatment was simply too good.

Jiang Hua naturally agreed with joy.

The baby salamander was in an environment where time was 30 times faster than normal, so it grew very fast.

Hence, once Jiang Hua had completed the employment procedures, Xia ruofei immediately brought him to the fish pond on the farm.

Jiang Hua looked at the environment of the fish pond and immediately frowned. He hesitated for a moment and said,””Boss, you can’t keep an ordinary fish pond like the Chinese perch ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”of course I know. That’s why I invited you here!” You have the final say on how to transform this place. I’m only responsible for contacting the construction company and providing the funds. ” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Jiang Hua nodded.”Boss, pomfrets have very strict requirements for the environment and are very timid, so the breeding place must be closed. In addition, the noise must be very low. Fortunately, this place is not close to the main road of the farm, so it should not be a big problem.”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Take a look at the site first. I’ll call the manager of the construction company later. You guys can make a plan together. How much money do you need, what equipment do you need, just give me a list!”

Xia ruofei’s words also made Jiang Hua very excited. He looked at the fish pond in front of him and said,””Boss, this ready – made fish pond definitely can’t be used. We need to first pump out the water, then use cement to build a few fish ponds. In addition, we need to make a closed greenhouse with a constant temperature device. The water temperature of the fish ponds must be maintained between 15°C and 28°C. In addition, the water quality of the recycled water should meet the standard of straight – drinking water, and there should be strict standards for the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water. These were all slowly figured out over the years on the farm where I used to work. ”

Xia ruofei said happily,”Jiang Hua, it seems that I made the right decision to hire you!” Your experience is very valuable! How about this, I’ll call Manager li from the construction company over right now, and you guys can come up with a plan and budget. You must do it as soon as possible!”

“Alright!” Jiang Hua said excitedly.

Manager li was at the farm, supervising the work. With a phone call from Xia ruofei, he had rushed over on his motorcycle.

Xia ruofei introduced the two of them, then told them about his plan to transform the fish pond.

When manager li heard this, he immediately expressed that he would follow the requirements strictly and ensure that the quality was maintained.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Manager li, the construction of this fish pond is rather tight. Your manpower will be given priority.”

“No problem, no problem!” Manager Li said,”boss Xia, I’ll talk to the river engineering company first. We’ll try to get the budget book out within two days!”

“Alright, thank you for your hard work ...” Xia ruofei said, smiling.

……

Feng Jing was busy with the registration of the pharmaceutical company, and at the same time, the recruitment work was also in progress.
