Chapter 3374: Xiaocherou (2)

Translator: 549690339

Time passed by.

Finally, after Xia ruofei poured the last bit of vital Qi into the elemental storage Pearl, he realized that the elemental storage Pearl was already in a saturated state and could no longer be filled with vital Qi.

Xia ruofei heaved a sigh of relief. He could barely remember how many rounds of vital Qi He had changed in his dantian. The crystals were just as he had expected. One and a half crystals were enough for Xia ruofei to cultivate many times in the past. Today, he had used one and a half crystals in one go. One could see how much energy he had absorbed.

Xia ruofei even took a few breaks along the way. After all, he was not made of steel. Cultivating and injecting energy non – stop was a huge drain on his energy.

Although it was very tiring, he had finally filled up the elemental storage Pearl that had been upgraded.

Xia ruofei weighed the energy storage Pearl in his hand and felt a sense of security that he had never felt before.

With his current consumption, the energy within the energy storage Pearl was enough to support him for a few hours. If he was running for his life, having this energy storage Pearl filled with energy would be more useful than anything else.

Xia ruofei put the unused crystal into the spirit map space, then stood up and walked out of the time formation.

Ling Qingxue quickly came forward and asked,””Ruofei, is it all done?”

Xia ruofei laughed as he threw the energy storage Pearl up and caught it in his hand. He laughed and said,””Yup! I’ve finally fed this gluttonous fellow to his fill!”

Ling Qingxue rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,”Then why don’t you quickly put it away? You actually dare to throw it around in your hands… This thing can save your life at a critical moment!”

Xia ruofei laughed and kept the energy storage Pearl. 1 le then grabbed Ling Qingxue’s hand and said,””Now that the problem of the elemental storage bead has been solved, it’s time to solve your problem!”

“How do 1 solve my problem?” Ling Qingxue asked with a smile,”can you make a bathroom for me? Don’t tell me you want me to take a bath in the open air! Even if no one was here, 1 wouldn’t dare to!”

Xia ruofei laughed.”You’re really smart. You guessed it right!”

Ling Qingxue panicked when she heard that,”you really want me to take a bath in the open?” No, no, no! I’m not doing that…”

Xia ruofei smiled.’Tm talking about making a bathroom for you. Didn’t you guess it right?”

“How is that possible?” Ling Qingxue didn’t believe him.

“What would you say if I can do it?” Xia ruofei smiled and said, “and let me tell you, there’s not only a bathroom but also hot water!”

“I don’t believe it…” Ling Qingxue was very clever.”If you can do it, then at most… I’ll admit that you’re good!”

“You’re not sincere!” Xia ruofei pursed his lips and said,”forget it, forget it. I can’t bear to see you become a dirty girl…”

With that, Xia ruofei’s mind moved slightly, and a small iron House appeared in front of them.

This Iron House was indeed very small, about three meters by three meters. The area was less than ten square meters, and the height was only two meters.

However, even though it was small, it had all the essentials. This small iron House also had a door, a roof, and two frosted glass windows.

Ling Qingxue was startled by the sudden appearance of the metal house. She subconsciously took a step back and pointed at the house.””This … This …”

“Qingxue, let’s go in and take a look!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Ling Qingxue regained her senses and nodded.””There can’t be monsters hiding inside, right? Come with me…”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”you’re overthinking it!” Alright, alright, alright, I’ll go with you!”

Ling Qingxue held Xia ruofei’s hand and the two of them pushed open the door of the iron House.

The moment she entered, Ling Qingxue was stunned.

The small iron House was filled with steam. In the middle of the room was a large Cypress bathtub filled with hot water. There were even rose petals on the water. The hot water must have been mixed with perfume or essential oil. The room was filled with a faint fragrance.

Ling Qingxue was dumbfounded. After a while, she asked,””RUO Fei, you… How did you do that?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”how is it?” Are you satisfied with this bathroom?”

“I’m satisfied! I’m satisfied!” Ling Qingxue said.

Before Ling Qingxue saw these things, she could still bear with it. But now, she couldn’t wait a second longer. She wanted to jump in and take a good bath.

As Ling Qingxue pushed Xia ruofei out, she pouted and said,””I’m going to take a bath, hurry up and get out! Hurry up and get out!”

Xia ruofei laughed as he retreated.””Qingxue, this bathtub is actually quite big, and… I’m not very clean either…”

Ling Qingxue blushed and said,”no!” Hurry up and get out! I beg you…”

Xia ruofei was pushed to the door by Ling Qingxue. He smiled bitterly and said,””1’11 walk on my own, don’t push me … By the way, you have bath supplies and clean clothes in your storage ring, right? Do you want me to get you some?”

“There are both! You can just leave!” Ling Qingxue said impatiently.

Xia ruofei was pushed out of the door by her, and Ling Qingxue closed the door in a hurry.

Xia ruofei shouted from outside.”Open the windows on both sides. Don’t suffocate!”

“I know! I know!” Ling Qingxue said,”help me keep watch outside! Also, don’t peek!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”okay! By the way, I’ll set up a time array around you so you can take a bath slowly. Also, if you don’t have enough hot water, just call!”

“I know!” Ling Qingxue said.

Xia ruofei’s hearing was very sharp. He heard the sound of Ling Qingxue undressing in the room. He could not help but feel an itch in his heart. However, he also knew that in such an environment, it was definitely not suitable for him to do such erotic things.

I le was still very clear about the priority of the matter.

Hence, Xia ruofei took a deep breath to calm his agitated emotions. Then, he took out the time array flag from the spirit map space and skillfully set it up around the small iron House.

This way, Ling Qingxue’s Iron House was more than 8o times slower than the outside world. She could take a bath in peace and comfort.

Xia ruofei paced around the perimeter while looking at the metal house that Ling Qingxue was in. His heart was filled with a sense of achievement.

All of this was naturally what he had instructed Xia Qing to prepare.

The iron House was made of the remaining materials from the free labor dormitory last time.

There were many laborers in the interspace, and many of them used to be top – notch assassins. They had good physical qualities and had gone through a long period of “reform through labor”. The materials and tools were readily available, so it was naturally easy to build a small iron House.

The bathtub was one of Xia ruofei’s previous items.

When he obtained the spirit map space and earned some money, he liked to buy all kinds of things and keep them in the space. This was the same as when Ling Qingxue, Song Wei, and the others first obtained their storage rings. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Hence, Xia ruofei had bought many things that he had no use for, including this bathtub.

Since the space was huge and the items did not take up much space, Xia ruofei just let them be in the corner.

Including the flower petals that were sprinkled in the hot water, Xia ruofei had also bought them casually from the supermarket during his shopping spree. If Ling Qingxue had not suddenly needed to take a shower this time, she would probably never have used them and would have been left in the corner of the space.

As for the hot water, it was naturally the free labor that Xia Qing had organized to boil it.

Right now, they were all boiling hot water in the medium, so that they could take it out whenever Ling Qingxue needed to refill the water.

This time, Ling Qingxue was really scared of being dirty. Even with the time formation, she still took a few minutes to come out of the shower. Counting the time inside the formation, it should have been two or three hours.

She did ask for hot water a few times and Xia ruofei provided it to her in time.

Finally, Ling Qingxue was done with her bath, freshened up, and dressed up. She walked out of the small metal house looking as if she had been reborn.

Xia ruofei’s eyes lit up when he saw Ling Qingxue..
