Chapter 1750: New wine revealed (2)

“I have to wait!” Xia ruofei replied without hesitation,”I don’t think he can invite Zhuo Yiyi to lunch! This kid must have sent them there and then returned dejectedly!”

Zhao Yongjun blinked and said,””I agree!”

Xia ruofei’s guess was right. When it was almost noon, song Rui drove Xia ruofei’s Land Rover to the courtyard house. His plan to have lunch with Zhuo Yiyi had failed.

The brothers sat in a circle in the dining room in the backyard, and the table was filled with dishes ordered directly from a nearby private restaurant.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”everyone, let’s eat first!” I’ll go get two bottles of wine!”

“Oh?” Zhao Yongjun’s eyes lit up.”Ruofei, do you have any good wine?”

Zhao Yongjun could not forget about Xia ruofei’s collection of Drunken Eight Immortals.

Xia ruofei smiled mysteriously.”You guys can try it later. I don’t have the final say on whether it’s good wine or not!”

The more he said this, the more Zhao Yongjun, who loved wine as much as his life, felt his heart itch. He couldn’t wait to say,””Hurry up and go!”

Xia ruofei walked back to the courtyard in the middle. He did not go to the wine cellar in the basement. Instead, he went into his bedroom and took out two bottles of wine from the spirit map space.

What he took out wasn’t the expensive rotten wine, but the expensive rotten sweet wine. Even if time flowed more than 2000 times faster, it would take at least seven to eight days to ripen. Taking it out now was undoubtedly a waste of God’s gift.

Hence, Xia ruofei chose his newly brewed Semillon.

The time for Semillon to ripen was relatively short, and it was in the spirit map space where the spirit Qi was rich. Taking into account the time flow rate of thirty times, it would take one to two months to ripen. In addition, it was already in a ready bottle, so it could be taken directly.

Of course, if it could be ripened for a few more months, the taste might be even better.

However, Xia ruofei was not reluctant to share two bottles with his brothers in advance.

Xia ruofei held a bottle of Semillon in each hand and quickly walked back to the backyard.

Zhao Yongjun looked at the bottle in Xia ruofei’s hand and said disappointedly,””It’s wine ...”

He preferred white wine, especially high – Concentration white wine, but wine was not strong enough for him.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Brother Zhao, if you like to drink white wine, I still have a few bottles of good Drunken Eight Immortals in my wine cellar. Why don’t I get Wu Qiang to bring them over?”

Wu Qiang immediately stood up and looked at Zhao Yongjun.

As long as Zhao Yongjun agreed, he would definitely go to the wine cellar without hesitation.

Zhao Yongjun subconsciously swallowed his saliva when he heard Xia ruofei mention the Eight Immortals of wine. He was about to nod in agreement when he saw Xia ruofei’s half – Smile and suddenly had an idea.

“No need!” He quickly said. No need! I think it’s good to drink white wine occasionally!”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”okay!” Wu Qiang, open the wine!”

Wu Qiang quickly took the bottle of wine from Xia ruofei’s hand and went to the side to open the bottle.

Zhao Yongjun laughed and said,”little guy, you want to trick me?” No way! RUO Fei, your white wine is also not simple, right?”

Xia ruofei said innocently,”it’s just like that!” I only prepared white wine for you because I saw that you seemed a little disappointed!”

“I don’t believe it!” Zhao Yongjun said, pouting.

Just as Zhao Yongjun finished speaking, Wu Qiang had already opened a bottle of Semillon and poured it into a special kettle.

“Wuqiang!” Zhao Yongjun said. Come, come, come, quickly pour everyone some wine!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Yes!” Wu Qiang replied.

Soon, everyone’s glass was filled with half a glass of Semillon white wine. Zhao Yongjun couldn’t wait to gently shake the glass, and then put it to his nose and took a deep breath.

“This fragrance is a little unique!” Zhao Yongjun mumbled to himself,”ruofei, is this from your winery in Australia?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I guess so.” It’s just a limited edition, and there’s only one bucket in total! Everyone, have a taste! Wu Qiang, don’t just stand there! Pour yourself too ...”

“I don’t drink, chief Xia!” Wu Qiang laughed. I might even have to send everyone off later!”

“Nonsense!” Xia ruofei said,”which soldier doesn’t drink? Pour, pour! What’s a little wine to be afraid of? We’ll get a designated driver for them later, or they can just stay here!”

“Alright then!” Wu Qiang could only pour himself a small half cup.

Zhao Yongjun couldn’t help but take a small sip.

Zhao Yongjun closed his eyes slightly. He didn’t swallow the wine directly. Instead, he let the wine stay in his mouth and carefully savored the rich and layered taste of this Semillon.

After a long while, Zhao Yongjun opened his eyes and revealed a stunned expression.””Ruofei, this wine is not bad! I’ve drunk the saimeirong wine you had in the past, and this bottle of wine is much better than the ones you had before! And the taste was richer and more mellow! This is the best wine!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”the winery in Australia has improved the variety of grapes. This barrel was specially brewed for me. The taste might be more unique!” Big brother Zhao, I’m not bad in your eyes, am I?”

“What are you saying? If this wine can’t even enter my eyes, then how high must my standards be!” Zhao Yongjun said,”ruofei, I realized that there are many benefits to hanging out with you. Let’s not talk about other things, just eating and drinking is a top quality enjoyment!”

Song Rui and the others also felt the same way and agreed.

Song Rui, who didn’t invite a beauty, was a little depressed and drank the wine in one gulp. This made Zhao Yongjun’s heart ache and he scolded him for wasting such a good gift. Such a good wine should naturally be tasted slowly. The way song Rui drank it was no different from a cow chewing on a peony.

Xia ruofei slowly savored the wine. To be honest, this Semillon was the highest quality bottle he had ever drunk. However, the bottle was not fully ripened yet. He could imagine that the taste of the Semillon would be even more mature after it was fully ripened.

And this was just a normal Semillon. Xia ruofei was more looking forward to the barrel of expensive rotten wine. That was a good wine that could be called liquid gold!

However, even with the flow of time of more than 2000 years, it would take at least seven to eight days to ripen in the oak barrel. By then, Xia ruofei would have returned to the three mountains, and these brothers in front of him would not be able to enjoy the food for the time being.

If Xia ruofei had not finished the barrel of expensive rotten wine when he came to the capital next time, they might be able to have a few more sips.

Everyone was full of praise for the Semillon that Xia ruofei had brought out. The white wine’s alcohol content was not high, and as everyone drank and chatted, the two bottles were quickly finished.

Zhao Yongjun urged Xia ruofei to take out a few more bottles. Xia ruofei said,””There’s nothing else! Just these two bottles ...”

“RUO Fei, don’t try to fool me!” Zhao Yongjun said,”you just said you had a bucket! How did it become two bottles? This doesn’t make sense!”

“Did I say one bucket?” Xia ruofei asked.

Zhao Yongjun, song Rui, and the others said in unison,””I did! We all heard it ...”

Xia ruofei rolled his eyes and said,””Oh, really? Oh right, I did say that I had specially brewed a barrel of wine, but I came back in a hurry this time and the wine is not fully ripened yet, so I only brought two bottles! We’ve all finished it!”

“Is that so?” Zhao Yongjun’s face was full of disbelief.

“RUO Fei, lying is not a good child!” Song Rui also laughed evilly.”Do you want us to search?”

Xia ruofei said helplessly,”the last bottle!” Really, I only brought three bottles ... Didn’t you guys pick me up at the airport when I came back? I only have so little luggage, how can there be a barrel of wine in it? I only brought three bottles back!”

Xia ruofei’s reason was finally accepted by everyone. The main reason was that no one would have thought that Xia ruofei would carry such a magical space with him. In addition, Xia ruofei had even admitted that he had kept a bottle of it for himself. It sounded even more convincing.

Xia ruofei deliberately returned to the courtyard with a bitter face and brought a bottle of Semillon white wine over for Wu Qiang to open.

At the same time, he heaved a sigh of relief. At least he managed to keep the rest of the wine. Otherwise, it would have been a waste if it hadn’t been fully cooked and drunk ...
