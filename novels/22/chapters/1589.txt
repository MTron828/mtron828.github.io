Chapter 1591: Over a hundred million Yuan (2)

Translator: 549690339

Ma Zhiming thought that Xia ruofei did not know about the situation of the Jade sculptors in Hengfeng jewelry, so he could not help but try to promote it himself.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”There’s no need for that now. I’ll contact you again if I need to!”

“Alright then!” Ma Zhiming said,”if it’s possible, I hope that Mr. Xia can leave me a jade carving of a Bell ...”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei said readily.

After the call with Ma Zhiming, Xia ruofei entered the spirit map space.

He stood at the Archean realm and looked at the head – sized black jade. He couldn’t help but feel rueful.

He only spent three million Yuan on the raw stone, but he got a rare Jade that was worth more than 100 million Yuan. In just two days, the value of the Jade had increased by more than 30 times! It was even more profitable than drug trafficking!

And this was the value of the Jade. If Xia ruofei processed this piece of Jade into a finished product, the value would probably increase a lot.

In particular, when he carved some array patterns on it, he only needed to show the function of the array inside the Jade products in the future. He was afraid that those rich people with assets in the hundreds of millions would go after it like a flock of ducks. It was absolutely possible that the value would be multiplied several times.

However, even though Xia ruofei was very confident in his carving skills, he also knew that he could not rush this matter.

First of all, he had to collect information to determine the shape and size of the person to be sculpted. Then, he had to make a reasonable plan for the Jade according to these.

This step was of utmost importance.

This top – grade black jade was extremely precious. The best plan was to use every bit of Jade as much as possible. In theory, it was best not to leave any leftovers. Of course, this was impossible.

However, if the plan was as perfect as possible, he might be able to make one more bracelet or one or two more pendants. These were all priceless treasures!

Hence, Xia ruofei kept the black jadeite in the spirit map space and returned to the outside world. It was almost evening. He planned to have dinner and then come back to plan.

Xia ruofei went downstairs and took out some ingredients from the spirit map space, mainly live fish, vegetables, and so on. Then, he took out a bottle of exquisite Drunken Eight Immortals Kasaya, the kind that had a small amount of spirit Heart Flower petals added.

Xia ruofei put on an apron and started to cook in the kitchen.

It had been a while since he cooked by himself, and it was quite interesting to cook occasionally.

After a while, ye Lingyun came to the villa after work. Pang Hao and Qian Qian came to freeload a meal after hearing that Xia ruofei was cooking at home.

The two of them saw that Xia ruofei was already busy and quickly went to the kitchen to help.

Very quickly, four dishes and a soup were prepared. The main dish was a boiled fish. The fish head was specially extracted to make tofu soup. There was also some marinade in the refrigerator. Xia ruofei took it out and heated it up. Dinner was ready.

It took too long to cook, so Xia ruofei decided to cook some dumplings.

He had not planned for pang Hao to come along, so while the two of them were eagerly serving the dishes, he went upstairs and retrieved another bottle of Drunken Eight Immortals from the medium.

As soon as he opened the bottle, the rich aroma of the wine filled the villa’s dining room.

Pang Hao couldn’t help but gulp. He immediately decided to stay in the company’s dormitory tonight and not drive home because he could drink to his heart’s content that way.

Ye Lingyun quickly picked up the bottle and poured the wine into the three people’s glasses.

Xia ruofei lifted his cup and looked at pang Hao with a faint smile.””Little fatty, you’re not kind! You didn’t even ask Hiroko to come along?”

“Guanping and his manager went to the city to run some business,” pang Hao said, grinning.”Otherwise, I would have called him along!”

“Business?” Xia ruofei was confused.”Isn’t he in the e – commerce Department? Why are you running a business in the city?”

“It’s like this. Recently, a new online supermarket has appeared in Sanshan.” Pang Hao said,”they mainly operate local businesses. They only have warehouses and no physical stores, so it’s very convenient to place orders online. Moreover, they promise to deliver it within half an hour. On top of that, there are some discounts from time to time, so the number of users has increased very quickly. Some uncles and aunties have even learned to use their APP ...”

At this point, pang Hao paused for a moment and couldn’t help but take a sip of wine. Then, he continued,””This online supermarket is very interested in our Taoyuan vegetables and hopes to cooperate with us. Although it was a local supermarket, it was still an e – commerce store in essence! “That’s why the e – commerce Department followed up. Hirako volunteered to follow their manager and learn ...”

“Oh, so it’s like that!” Xia ruofei said.

He wasn’t too concerned about the specific business. Now that the company had reached a certain scale, if he had to personally take care of everything, he wouldn’t be able to handle it even if he had a clone.

The various departments under him were being expanded, and there were more and more people. These specific matters were naturally handled by people with their own duties.

Xia ruofei asked again,”how’s pingzi doing in the company?” Will you be wronged?”

“You’re thinking too much!”Pang Hao said. Although Hiroko repeatedly said that he wanted to keep a low profile, and not many people in the company know about his relationship with us, Hiroko was originally in the sales industry, and his emotional intelligence is very high. He’s only been here for two or three days, but he’s already very familiar with his colleagues. I think ... He’s born to be in this industry!”

Xia ruofei was very pleased to hear this and said,””That’s good, that’s good ... I was afraid that he wouldn’t be able to adapt!”

“I still need time to get used to it.” Pang Hao said,”but ping Zi will definitely be able to do it! I’m more worried that he’ll feel a sense of disappointment. After all ...”

“I won ‘t!” Xia ruofei said,”pingzi isn’t that kind of person! The fact that he took the initiative to ask to go to the front line to do the basic work shows that he has confidence in himself, and at the same time, he wants to achieve success with his own ability!”

Xia ruofei understood pang Hao’s concern. Back then, the three of them were as close as brothers. Now, Xia ruofei was the big boss of the company and pang Hao was a senior executive in the company. Only Guan Ping was still an ordinary employee.

However, pang Hao had been working with Xia ruofei since the farm was founded. He was one of the first founding members of the company. Now that the company’s personnel system was being reformed and the employee hierarchy system had been implemented, Xia ruofei could not break the rules just for Guan Ping.

“I hope so!” Pang Hao said,”I just feel that it’s not worth it for pingzi. Back then, I persuaded him to come over, but he insisted on staying in that bullsh * t company ...”

“Everyone has their own aspirations!” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”things are hard to predict. No one can predict the future. Only time can tell if a decision is right ...”

“Alright, alright, let’s not talk about this anymore!” Xia ruofei said,”come on! Let’s drink!”

Pang Hao and ye Lingyun raised their glasses as well. The three brothers clinked their glasses and downed their drinks in one go.

The ingredients produced in the spirit map space were all of high quality. In addition, Xia ruofei’s cooking skills were not bad. The glutton pang Hao could not resist the temptation of delicious food. Very quickly, he waved his chopsticks and began to gobble down the food.

The frequency at which ye Lingyun reached out with his chopsticks was obviously much faster as well. He was eating with great relish.

The three of them had a happy dinner together. Two catties of Drunken Eight Immortals white wine were divided among the three of them, and they drank every drop.

After the three of them cleaned up the dishes, they sat in the living room to make tea and chat. It was not until nineo’ clock in the evening that pang Hao and ye Lingyun got up and said their goodbyes. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Xia ruofei was a little tipsy. He returned to his bedroom on the second floor and prepared to make a few size for the figures that he wanted to carve.

He vaguely remembered that among the massive amount of inherited information of the human jade talisman, there seemed to be a volume of visualization pictures. As for whether it had the shape he needed, he did not know.

Hence, Xia ruofei first found the visualization picture in his mind and quickly went through it. As expected, he was not disappointed. Not only did Qianqian’s visualization picture have images of Buddha and Guanyin, but Zhong Kui and Guan Gong were also in it.

However, he couldn’t find the image of Mr. Bao.

Bao Li was from the Northern Song Dynasty. Perhaps this spirit map space already had an age. Perhaps the previous owner of the space lived even earlier than the Northern Song Dynasty! It wasn’t strange that he didn’t have an official image.

These were all inherited information and were stored in Xia ruofei’s brain. Once he took them out, the images of Zhong Yuan and Guan Yu were imprinted in his mind and were extremely clear.

Xia ruofei chose Zhong Kui’s image and concentrated on it with his spiritual will. Suddenly, a magical scene happened ...
