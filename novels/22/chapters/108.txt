Xia ruofei smiled at ye Lingyun and walked over. He flicked his finger, and a half – smoked cigarette accurately flew to the extinguished area on top of the trash can. It was inserted into the small hole, and the cigarette end was immersed in the water, making a sizzling sound. Xia ruofei walked to pang Hao’s side and said with a smile,””Little fatty, what happened? I didn’t even finish a cigarette before I was attracted by your loud voice. ” In fact, Xia ruofei had arrived earlier than this. While Deng Ming and pang Hao were tugging at him, he had already reached the corner of the corridor. However, when he saw ye Lingyun, he stopped in his tracks. He wanted to see how ye Lingyun would handle this. Obviously, Xia ruofei was satisfied with ye Lingyun’s choice. Xia ruofei and ye Lingyun had known each other for five years. At that time, he was a first – term Sergeant, which was a corporal after the military rank reform, while ye Lingyun was a new soldier who had just joined the Army for a few months. At that time, Xia ruofei was already an official member of the lone wolf assault team. Ye Lingyun was a member of the training team and the only private in the entire training team. A first – year recruit could participate in the selection of the lone wolf assault team. It could be seen that ye Lingyun’s military quality was very strong. That training camp lasted for three months, and the elimination process was carried out every day. Xia ruofei was one of the instructors and class monitors of this training team. Although ye Lingyun managed to survive until the third month and became one of the last two eliminated members, he was still selected by the Special Forces of the military Region as if he had received a treasure. If he could stay in the lone wolf Commando selection training for the third month, he would definitely be qualified to be the backbone of an ordinary special forces unit. After three months of interaction, Xia ruofei and ye Lingyun were naturally very familiar with each other. In the following years, the two often crossed paths in work and even fought together several times in actual military exercises. Ye Lingyun was extremely respectful to the instructor who had brought him into the Special Forces. In fact, he had always regarded Xia ruofei as his idol and goal. Xia ruofei was also very surprised that he would run into ye Lingyun in Sanshan city. Based on his understanding of ye Lingyun, this talented warrior would be like a fish in water in the Special Forces. He would stay in the Special Forces for a long time and might even become a Sergeant in the future. How did he suddenly leave the Army and become a private bodyguard? Xia ruofei’s heart was also filled with questions, but now was obviously not the time to reminisce. He planned to ask ye Lingyun what was going on after he came down. Pang Hao explained what had just happened to Xia ruofei, “Are you hurt?” Xia ruofei glanced at Deng Ming nonchalantly and asked pang Hao. “I’m fine!” Pang Hao grinned.”It’s just that they won’t let us go! He said I dirtied his high – end suit and wanted me to pay 8000 dollars!” Xia ruofei nodded and looked at ye Lingyun.””Xiao Ye, is this your boss?” “One minute ago, I was. Now, I’m not!” Ye linyun said. “I know.” Xia ruofei shrugged. Then, he stared at Deng Ming and said indifferently,””Apologize to my friend!” Deng Ming had been holding back his anger for a long time. He immediately shouted,””Who the hell are you? Why are you acting like a big – tailed Wolf? And you want me to apologize? I’ll F * ck you!” As soon as he finished speaking, ye Lingyun suddenly moved. Deng Ming only felt a blur in front of his eyes. Before he could even look down on ye Lingyun’s movements, ye Lingyun was already in front of him. His hand was like an iron Pincher, gripping his throat. Following that, Deng Ming heard ye Lingyun’s cold voice,””Deng Ming, watch your mouth! If you dare to disrespect instructor Xia again, I’ll break your neck!” “Ye Lingyun, are you crazy?” Deng Ming was so frightened that he started wailing. You dare to attack me? Don’t you know who my dad is?” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh,” This person actually doesn’t know who his father is ... Don’t ask us about this! If you really can ‘t, you can ask your neighbor uncle Wang. No... It should be uncle song from next door!” Pang Hao couldn’t help but laugh when he heard that. Even Deng Ming’s scoundrel friends almost couldn’t hold back their laughter. Only ye linyun remained indifferent.”I don’t care who your father is. I only know that I’ll teach whoever disrespects instructor Xia a lesson!” In the shadow of the corner of the corridor, the head of security of the West River Moon Club, Shen Hu, had been closely watching the situation here. The guests in the club were all people of status. Under normal circumstances, when there was a conflict, the club would not immediately step in. After all, both sides had strong backgrounds, and it was easy for the club to be at odds with both sides. Only when the conflict escalated and reached an irreconcilable stage would the club Step in to mediate. Therefore, after Shen Hu received the report, he had been here for a while. However, he had been hiding in the dark and observing closely. Now that he saw ye Lingyun suddenly attacking Deng Ming, Shen Hu’s expression changed slightly. He was ready to go out and separate the two parties in the conflict and then find a way to appease them. Just as he turned the corner, he suddenly saw Xia ruofei’s figure. His face froze and he pulled his foot back. Then, he quickly took out his phone and called President Zheng. “Tiger, what’s the situation?” President Zheng asked. “Boss, it seems a little complicated.” Shen Hu hesitated for a moment before saying,”I just saw Mr. Xia. He seems to be on the opposite side of young master Deng ...” “What?” President Zheng also frowned.”What’s the situation now?” “Not good. It seems like both sides are about to fight,” Shen Hu said.”President Zheng, what should we do?” President Zheng fell into deep thought. Xia ruofei was his strategic partner and had a close relationship with Tian Huilan’s family. President Zheng naturally wanted to rope him in. But Deng Ming was not to be trifled with either! The Deputy Mayor’s son could be considered a rich second generation in Sanshan city. Furthermore, this kind of rich kid had always been incapable of achieving anything, so it was definitely not wise to offend him. President Zheng’s brain was spinning rapidly. Suddenly, he had an idea and quickly said,””Tiger, you don’t have to worry about this. Just stand there and watch. Unless there’s a bloody conflict, you don’t have to do anything!” Then, President Zheng hung up the phone and turned to the lobby manager next to him.””Xiaomeng, isn’t Mayor Wu of Changping holding a banquet for his old colleagues at the bright moon Hall? Go and report this to her immediately. Be quick!” “President Zheng, is this ... Appropriate?” Little dream hesitated. He was the son of the Deputy Mayor! Why would County Head Wu do this? “You don’t need to worry about that!” President Zheng said,”let’s go now. Remember to mention brother Xia’s name.” “Oh, okay ...” Little dream didn’t dare to say anything more and quickly ran out. The two sides were already in a state of mutual hostility. Xia ruofei had a faint smile on his face as he said,”Little ye, let him go first!” “Yes! Instructor Xia. ” Ye linyun replied. Then, he looked at Deng Ming coldly and released his hand. Deng Ming was breathing in the fresh air while rubbing his neck with his hands, looking at ye linyun with a venomous look. However, ye Lingyun turned a blind eye and walked directly behind Xia ruofei, staring coldly at Deng Ming and his gang. Deng Ming looked at ye Lingyun with a little fear. He estimated that he and a few of his scoundrels were not enough to deal with ye Lingyun alone, especially when ye Lingyun’s ruthlessness made him feel scared. Therefore, he also had the intention to retreat. In any case, as long as they were in Sanshan city’s territory, young master Deng would be able to find out the background of those people. When the time came, he would just casually say something and there would be plenty of ways to deal with them. There was no need to risk his life now. After making up his mind, Deng Ming snorted and said,””Damn fatty, you’re lucky! I’ll let you off today. ” “Brothers, let’s go back and continue drinking!” Deng Ming said to his scoundrel friends. After he finished speaking, he looked deeply at Xia ruofei and the other two. He did not hide the hatred in his heart at all. Then, he turned around and walked towards the private room. “Stop!” Xia ruofei’s lips curled into a cold smile.””Did I say you could leave?”
