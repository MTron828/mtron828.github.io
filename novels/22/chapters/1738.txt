Chapter 1739: A leap in improvement_2

Fortunately, there was soon news that the flight had landed in Saipan and there were no casualties. Song Wei was slightly relieved. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

As more and more news came out, Song Wei naturally found out about Xia ruofei’s amazing performance that day.

Unlike Zhao Yongjun and the others who were amazed, Song Wei wasn’t too surprised. After all, she had already entered the threshold of cultivation and knew the huge difference between a cultivator and an ordinary person.

Of course, this was only in terms of combat power. Song Wei still felt that it was unbelievable that Xia ruofei was able to land the plane successfully. Of course, she was still scared.

Xia ruofei chuckled and scratched his head.””Didn’t I make it in time? Well ... You can’t blame me for not informing you in advance! I was surrounded by reporters as soon as I came out of seclusion. When I finally broke out, song Rui and the others took me back to the courtyard house. Then, I went out early in the morning to handle some matters ...”

“In the end, he still doesn’t value me!” Song Wei said coyly,”I’ve been looking forward to the stars and the moon ...”

She was halfway through her sentence when her face suddenly reddened and she stopped. This was because her words were too ambiguous.

Before Xia ruofei could say anything, Song Wei quickly explained,””Don’t misunderstand! I’m saying that I’m looking forward to you coming back to cultivate with me. You don’t know, but when I cultivate alone, my progress is so slow that it’s driving me crazy ...”

The “Scripture of the primogenitor” was originally designed for two people to practice together. Although it was not impossible to practice it alone, the effect would be very slow. Song Wei’s practice these few days could at most maintain her cultivation level. After all, cultivation was like sailing against the current. If she did not improve, she would fall behind. Perhaps she could improve a little more if she was more diligent. However, compared to practicing it together, it was a world of difference.

It was no exaggeration to say that the effect of her one – hour joint training with Xia ruofei was much better than her daily training over the past few days.

Xia ruofei laughed,”why are you in such a hurry to explain?” I didn’t misunderstand! So, you’re here today mainly to cultivate?”

“Aren’t you asking the obvious?”Song Wei replied. As long as I think of that sinister thing in my sea of consciousness, I will be restless and can’t wait to get rid of it immediately ...”

There was another point that Song Wei found hard to mention. She felt that the peach blossom miasma had been influencing her these days, making her body more and more sensitive. Even when she was taking a bath, she would subconsciously have some embarrassing reactions, especially in her sleep.

Every time she had such a dream, the male lead would definitely be Xia ruofei. The scene in the dream would make song Wei’s body go soft and her ears turn red.

Even though she knew that it was the effect of the miasma, Song Wei still had a sense of anticipation towards the dream. It made her feel a little scared, so she could not help but come to see Xia ruofei without saying hello.

However, she did not expect to find Xia ruofei. Fortunately, Xia ruofei did not make her wait too long and they returned to the courtyard.

Xia ruofei said seriously,”you can’t be too impatient!” As long as one’s cultivation continued to improve, it was only a matter of time before they could completely eliminate it! In order to ensure that nothing goes wrong, it’s naturally better to be as prepared as possible. Once you’re impatient, it’s likely to backfire!”

“I understand ...” Song Wei nodded and said,”I understand the logic, but sometimes I can’t wait ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”that’s normal. I’d be anxious too.” But don’t worry, with your current cultivation, it’s not easy for the peach blossom miasma to affect your mind. Even if it can’t be completely removed, it’s not a problem to suppress it. ”

Song Wei smiled bitterly and thought,”I don’t think I can suppress it!”

However, it was a little difficult for a Virgin to say this.

In fact, the miasma itself was not that powerful, but the most sinister thing about it was that it would take advantage of the situation. Just like how Song Wei already had deep feelings for Xia ruofei, plus the two of them were cultivating the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” together, and Song Wei had repeatedly experienced the intimacy from the soul level. This made it even more difficult for her to extricate herself. The miasma was hidden in Song Wei’s sea of consciousness. As long as it was slightly guided, Song Wei would be affected.

Xia ruofei continued,”then let’s not waste any more time. Let’s go and cultivate!” I hope this time it can help you break through to Qi disciple Level 3!”

Song Wei nodded her head and said,”Alright!”

The two of them entered the house. As usual, Xia ruofei locked the door and closed the curtains tightly.

This was supposed to be a normal action, but it still made song Weifang’s heart beat fast. She couldn’t help but think of the scene in her dream. In fact, this was the work of the peach blossom miasma.

Song Wei quickly took a deep breath and forcefully suppressed the distracting thoughts in her heart.

“Have a seat. I’ll go and prepare,” said Xia ruofei.

Other than avoiding Song Wei’s sight and taking out the array flag from the space, he also had to prepare some food and water for the entire afternoon. If the time flow was 90 times faster, it would take several days in the array. The two of them could not go without food and water.

Xia ruofei walked into the cloakroom in his bedroom and quickly took out the array flags from the medium. Then, he took out some instant noodles and bottles of spirit pool water from the medium. After packing these things in a bag, he carried them out.
