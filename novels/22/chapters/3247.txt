“Alright!” Elonmask quickly replied. Thank you, Mr. Xia! You’ve worked hard!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,””We’re just taking what we need. Mr. Masker, you don’t have to be so polite!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded at grams. Then, he walked out of little X’s room and entered the room next door.

It was actually a bit like a small suite in a hotel.

There was an independent dry and wet bathroom, as well as a small living room. There was a closed balcony outside the living room. In addition, the bedroom even had a special cloakroom. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The herbs that the Butler had just bought were neatly stacked in a corner of the living room.

After Xia ruofei entered the house, he habitually used his spiritual power to check the house. He did not find any listening or recording equipment before he started to organize the medicinal herbs.

He placed these different kinds of packed medicinal herbs on the coffee table. Many of them were to confuse the eyes and were completely useless. He also opened the medicine bags and placed them on the coffee table.

Although they were far away, the color of the Chinese medicine was not bad. At least, they met Xia ruofei’s requirements.

He skillfully picked out the required medicinal ingredients according to the prescription he had already formulated in his mind. The small scale that the Butler had bought was completely useless. Xia ruofei could accurately determine the weight with just his hand.

Xia ruofei immediately set up the pot on the balcony and started to boil the medicine.

Elon Musk had also taken a dose of Chinese medicine and was waiting in little X’s room next door. Although he wanted to know how Xia ruofei’s preparations were going, he did not dare to enter the room and disturb her.

After Xia ruofei boiled a pot of medicine, he took out a small bottle of the spirit Heart Flower petal solution from the spirit map space. This was a very low concentration solution. The effective ingredients in it were only about one – fifth of a petal.

He poured the flower petal solution into the pot and stirred it well. Then, he poured a small bowl and placed it on the table.

He then took out a claypot from the spirit map space and poured the rest of the medicinal liquid into the claypot before putting it away in the spirit map space.

This small bowl of medicine was only about 1/4 of the amount that an adult could take. However, that pot of medicine could hold at least 10 bowls like this. Therefore, this small bowl of medicinal soup only contained about 1/50 of the effective ingredients of a petal of the spirit Heart Flower. Naturally, it was a very small amount.

For little X, this amount of medicine would definitely be very effective. It could also prevent the occurrence of overnight recovery due to excessive active ingredients.

Xia ruofei had chosen this quantity after some calculations.

While waiting for the medicinal soup to cool down, Xia ruofei tidied up the Chinese medicinal herbs on the coffee table. He randomly picked some herbs and put them into the spirit map space. Since he had stored a large amount of Chinese medicinal herbs in the spirit map space and the quality of the herbs bought by the Butler was not bad, Xia ruofei added them to his own space pharmacy.

Xia ruofei also took some of each item, including some useless herbs that he had used to pass off as real.

In this way, even if someone sneaked into the room and saw the remaining medicinal herbs, it would be impossible to deduce the actual medicinal herbs and dosage of the prescription.

Of course, Xia ruofei would spend most of his time in this room or in little X’s room next door. No one would be able to sneak into this room under his watch.

He was just maintaining a cautious habit.

Xia ruofei personally wrapped up the medicinal dregs and used his vital Qi to shake them into powder. Then, he flushed them all away with the toilet bowl and washed the medicinal pot clean.

After all the cleaning up, the herbal soup on the table had cooled down to a warm state.

Hence, Xia ruofei carried the bowl of medicine and walked into the room next door.

Elon Musk and grams were both in the room. What they were most concerned about now was undoubtedly little X’s situation. There were a lot of things to deal with at the Elon Musk company, including a few urgent meetings, which he had pushed back.

When they saw Xia ruofei, the two of them quickly stood up and greeted him.

Xia ruofei smiled and handed the bowl to grams. Then he said,””Little X has been drinking his milk for about an hour, right? You can directly drink the medicine now. ”

Grams carefully held the bowl of medicine as if he was holding the hope of life.

She could smell the pungent Chinese medicine and couldn’t help but ask,””Doctor Xia, this medicine ... Should we feed it to the child directly?”

Xia ruofei shrugged and asked,””What else?”

But he immediately realized the reason for gramus ‘question, so he smiled and said,””Considering that the child is relatively small, we can put it in the milk bottle and let him suck on his own. Of course, if you’re afraid that the medicine will be bitter, you can also add some sugar. It won’t affect the efficacy. ”

Grams nodded. She looked at the black medicinal soup in the small bowl in her hand and thought of the scene of adding sugar cubes. She couldn’t help but smile and say,””This sounds like drinking coffee!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”they do look similar, but the taste is completely different!” By the way, I have to remind you of something. ”

“Please speak!” Elonmask and gramus quickly said in unison.

“It doesn’t matter if you feed him with a small spoon, put it in a milk bottle for him to suck on, or add sugar or something. It’s not a problem.” Xia ruofei said,”but you must remember one thing. No matter what, you must not let your body come into contact with the medicine, including using your lips to feel the temperature. This is absolutely not allowed. Also, if your fingers or any other part of your body comes into contact with the medicine, then this bowl of medicine must be thrown away immediately. It can not be given to the child again!”

Xia ruofei was very serious as this was the special characteristic of the spirit Heart Flower petals. If he really touched the temperature of the petals with his lips every time before feeding the medicine, all the medicinal properties would be absorbed by the person who touched the temperature. It would have no effect on little X.

Of course, the effect of Chinese medicine was still there. However, it would take a long time to treat Xia ruofei with only Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture. Besides, Xia ruofei could not guarantee a complete recovery.

Elon Musk and grams did not know the mystery behind it, but Xia ruofei’s request was not particularly strange. At least from the perspective of hygiene, it was very reasonable.

No matter where one touched the medicinal liquid, there was a possibility of contamination. Especially the behavior of using one’s lips to feel the temperature was highly contagious. Hence, it was normal for Xia ruofei to make such a request from the perspective of a doctor.

However, Xia ruofei’s instructions were more serious than the average doctor ‘s, and his expression was more serious. This made elonmask and gramus pay more attention to him.

The two of them quickly nodded and replied,”alright!” We’ll definitely abide by it!”

After that, grams personally operated and explained to the nurses and nannies next to him. He mainly emphasized that no part of the human body should come into contact with the liquid during the process of transferring it.

Xia ruofei watched from the side until glams carefully poured all the liquid into the bottle and threw in two sugar cubes. He smiled and nodded.””Well done! In the future, you must meet this standard every time, or else the effectiveness may be reduced!”

Gryms tightened the milk bottle and shook it while waiting for the sugar to melt. He smiled and said,””We’ll definitely remember the doctor’s advice!”

After stirring it well, grams personally went to feed the child the medicine.

Maybe it was because the Chinese medicine with sugar cubes tasted good, or maybe the child could feel that this strange medicine was his life, so he didn’t reject it and directly took big gulps of it.

Seeing the brown liquid in the milk bottle decrease, gramus couldn’t help but smile.

Very quickly, little X finished more than half the bottle of medicinal soup. Then, he actually burped, making everyone in the room laugh.

The little guy’s eyes were filled with confusion. He looked left and right, then simply closed his eyes and fell asleep ...
