Liang Weimin said,”uncle, this piece of gold Nannan is a small gift from our family to you. You can’t pay for it. I’ve already prepared it!” 10 million US dollars was a lot. It was equivalent to more than 60 million Chinese dollars. Liang Weimin was a little tight on his hands to take out so much money all of a sudden. However, the real estate industry had been very profitable in the past few years, so it was not a big deal to take out this money. This was mainly because Liang Weihua had done the same thing before. Now that Liang Weimin had the upper hand, he naturally wouldn’t let Liang Weihua take the lead in this matter. Elder Tang chuckled and waved his hand,””No need! I understand your company’s situation. Taking out so much money at once will definitely affect your liquid funds. ” “Uncle ...” “Let’s do this! 10 million US dollars is not a lot of money for me. ” Elder Tang said decisively, not giving Liang Weimin any chance to continue fighting. He directly took the checkbook, scribbled down the amount, signed his name, and then tore off the check. However, elder Tang did not pass the check to Xia ruofei. Instead, he passed it to Liang Weihua, who had a complicated expression on his face, and said,””Wei Hua, here’s 8 million Chinese yuan. I’ll use your material to make some furniture. It’s pretty good.” Liang Weihua was stunned for a moment, but when he finally reacted, he quickly said,””Uncle, I gave that material to you as a token of respect. I can’t take the money!” “Take it!” Elder Tang replied indifferently,”I didn’t ask him to pay for the People’s side. Of course, I can’t ask you to pay for the People’s side either. I can’t favor one over the other!” Elder Tang’s words left no room for doubt, so Liang Weihua could only helplessly accept the check. He felt that the check was a little hot. He had made a false price before. He had actually spent less than seven million on the Phoebe zhennan, but now the old man had given him eight million according to the price he had set. If the old man knew about this, the nature of the matter would be completely different. It wouldn’t be too much to say that he was scamming money. If Xia ruofei had not helped Liang Weimin find this piece of Phoebe zhennan material, old master Liang would definitely have used Liang Weihua ‘s. Now that he had failed to please old master Liang, he had even left a bad impression on him. When he thought about how this was all because of Xia ruofei, Liang Weihua’s gaze towards Xia ruofei became even more venomous. Xia ruofei felt something and glanced at Liang Weihua indifferently. Liang Weihua subconsciously avoided Xia ruofei’s gaze because Xia ruofei’s casual glance had actually made him feel a chill from the bottom of his heart. Why is this kid’s gaze so terrifying ... Liang Weihua still had some lingering fear. The corners of Xia ruofei’s mouth curved up slightly and he looked away. Elder Tang signed another ten million US dollars check and handed it to Xia ruofei with a smile. Xia ruofei took the check and thanked her with a smile. At this moment, Liang Weimin came over and said,””Uncle, it’s almost time, let’s go eat! I’ve already reserved the place ...” Liang Weimin had already accepted the task of receiving elder Tang. When he went to inform the master carpenter, he had also decided on a place to eat. Elder Tang nodded.”For the sake of the people, you can rent a warehouse near the Changping Pier and transport this piece of material there first. The cargo ship I’ve arranged will arrive in a few days. You don’t have to worry about the procedures, my people will take care of it. You just have to ensure the safety of this piece of material within these few days!” “Don’t worry! Uncle, I’ll definitely send more capable people. There won’t be any problems!” Liang Weimin said. He then added,”I’ll have little Chao stand guard there 24/7!” Liang Weimin naturally wanted to give his precious son more points, but Liang Qichao’s face immediately turned bitter when he heard that. He didn’t want to show anything in front of the old man! Wasn’t it killing him to guard the warehouse for several days in a row? However, he didn’t dare to refute his father’s words, so he could only put on a pitiful look. Elder Tang nodded with a smile. Liang Weimin said to Xia ruofei,”ruofei, leave the key to the warehouse to Lil Chao!” I’ll arrange for a car to come over and take the material away in a while! Have lunch with me this afternoon!” Elder Tang immediately replied,””Yes, yes, yes, brother Xia, I still have to thank you properly! Let’s have lunch together!” “For the sake of the people,” elder Tang said,”please arrange a better place for us. I’ll have a few drinks with brother Xia!” Liang Weimin smiled and said,”don’t worry, uncle. I’ve booked a private room at the West River Moon Club. Although this club isn’t considered very high – end in the country, it’s very unique. They have a type of Taoyuan brand vegetable. Not only does it look very good, but the taste is also far better than ordinary vegetables. Uncle, it’s not easy for you to come back to the three mountains. You must go and try it!” Xi Jiang Yue’s paradise vegetables had always been sold in the form of an auction. President Zheng knew that rare goods could be kept. However, as Xia ruofei’s vegetable greenhouse began to operate, the supply volume had also increased. With Liang Weimin’s status in Sanshan city, it was not difficult for him to get to eat paradise vegetables even though it was a temporary order. Elder Tang’s eyes brightened up as he said,””Weimin, now that you’ve mentioned it, I really have to go and try this paradise vegetables!” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”old man, if you want to try the taste of the Taoyuan vegetables, I have a better place to go ...” “Oh?” “Brother Xia, do you have any better recommendations?” elder Tang asked with great interest. Liang Weimin also asked curiously,”ruofei, are you Ling Ji restaurant?” As far as I know, although Ling Ji restaurant also provides paradise vegetables, they’re going down the path of mass food, so the exquisiteness of their dishes is far from being able to catch up with the XI Jiang Yue club. ” Xia ruofei laughed.”Old master, uncle Liang, I’m not talking about Xi Jiang Yue. I’m not talking about Ling Ji restaurant.” Liang Weimin was even more curious now. He said, “I’m a little ignorant about this. Is there a third place in Sanshan city where you can eat Taoyuan vegetables?” Taoyuan vegetables had been on the market for some time and was very famous in Sanshan city. Almost everyone knew that only Xijiang Moon Club and Ling Ji restaurant could have such expensive but delicious vegetables. Xia ruofei smiled.”I won’t keep you in suspense. The place I’m talking about is my home!” “Your home?” Liang Weimin was even more surprised. “Old master, uncle Liang, I opened a farm in the suburbs Changping County. I usually live there.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Ling Ji restaurant and West River Moon club’s paradise vegetables are provided by my farm. So ... If you want to eat paradise brand vegetables, the best place is naturally my Paradise Farm. I have an unlimited supply there!”
