Chapter 572: There’s a kind of brother called comrade – in – arms (1)

“Uncle Qian, I’ve already told my friend. Let’s just leave it at that! It’s a happy ending!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Boss Qian’s face was filled with gratitude as he said,””Ruofei, thank you so much. I thought that I would never get back the money in my life.”

Qian Lijun also patted Xia ruofei’s shoulder and said sincerely,””Ruofei, thanks!”

He knew very well that Xia ruofei had done his family such a big favor without saying a word out of camaraderie.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”uncle Qian, Li Jun, you don’t have to be so polite with me. Li Jun and I are good friends who love to fight. Furthermore, it’s all thanks to you guys that master Luo was sent to help. Otherwise, I wouldn’t know what to do with my iron – Skin Dendrobium fresh strips!”

“We’ve only done something so insignificant,” boss Qian lamented.”Ruofei, you’ve helped us so much. This ... There’s no comparison!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”we’re family, so you don’t have to be so formal!” Uncle Qian, we still have two comrades coming over at noon. You just have to accompany us for a few more drinks ...”

“Definitely, definitely!” Boss Qian quickly said.

“Oh, Pan Qiang and the others should be here soon. I’ll give them a call and ask!” Qian Lijun also said.

Qian Lijun took out his phone to call Pan Qiang and Wang Zhihai while boss Qian personally went to prepare lunch. He could only express his gratitude to Xia ruofei by receiving him more warmly.

At around 11 O’ clock in the afternoon, Xia ruofei’s old comrades in the recruit company, Pan Qiang and Wang Zhihai, also arrived at the Qian family’s iron – Skin Dendrobium base.

When comrades met, there was naturally a wave of excitement and sighs.

At noon, boss Qian prepared a sumptuous banquet for Xia ruofei, Pan Qiang, and Wang Zhihai. He also generously said that he had already booked a hotel in Anyue city. Tonight, Xia ruofei and the rest would have a larger gathering of comrades. He would cover all the expenses.

......

During the meal, Xia ruofei, Qian Lijun, Pan Qiang, and Wang Zhihai were toasting each other and talking about the past in the Army. Everyone was very nostalgic.

They had joined the Army when they were 17 or 18 years old. In the iron – blooded military camp, they had laughed and cried, leaving an indelible Green Mark in their youth.

Now, they had all left the camp and entered society, but their camaraderie had not faded with the passage of time. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Boss Qian also frequently toasted the three of them, especially Xia ruofei’s side. Boss Qian even toasted at least a dozen glasses of wine.

Xia ruofei was a guest, so Qian Lijun and the other two naturally drank with him.

However, Xia ruofei’s alcohol tolerance was already very good when he was in the Army. Now, it was even more shocking. In addition, he was in a good mood today, so he did not reject anyone. He drank at least one or two catties of white wine during the meal.

As the banquet was coming to an end, Qian Lijun’s face was flushed red from drinking too much. He was a little tongue – tied when he spoke.

He took a big glass and filled it with white wine. He walked to Xia ruofei and said,””Ruofei, you’ve done me such a big favor. There’s no need to say any more words of thanks between us brothers, it’s all in the wine. I ... I’ll give you a toast!”

After he finished speaking, Qian Lijun raised his head and drank a glass of white wine that was two taels in total.

Xia ruofei chuckled as he picked up his glass and drank a glass of wine as well. He then supported Qian Lijun and said,”Li Jun, are you sure you can do it? No, don’t force yourself, go and sleep for a while, there’s still a fierce battle tonight!”

Qian Lijun’s neck stiffened as he said,”how ... Can ... Men ... Say ... No?” Qiangzi, Zhihai, let ‘s...To......Toast.......RUO Fei!”

Xia ruofei quickly gave Pan Qiang and Wang Zhihai a look, signaling them not to join in the commotion. Then, he helped Qian Lijun to sit down and said,””There are plenty of opportunities to drink, why are you in such a hurry? We’ll continue drinking tonight!”

Then, Xia ruofei said to boss Qian,””Uncle Qian, Li Jun drank quite a lot today. I think we should stop here for lunch!”

Boss Qian naturally wouldn’t object. He quickly said,””Good, good, good! Ruofei, I’ve already arranged the guest rooms. You guys should go and rest for a while. I’ll wake you up in the evening and we’ll go directly to the city!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. He suddenly remembered something and asked,””By the way, uncle Qian, give me your account number! I’ll ask the company’s finance department to send you the processing fee for this tin Kaede fight. ”

“I can’t accept this money, ruofei!” Boss Qian quickly said. You helped me get back more than 80 million Yuan. I’m just doing you a small favor. How can I accept your money ...”

After hearing this, Pan Qiang, who was a little tipsy, asked curiously,””Uncle Qian, what do you mean by 80 million?”

Boss Qian said with emotion,”qiangzi, it’s all thanks to RUO Fei this time!” Didn’t our family get scammed of a large sum of money a few years ago? RUO Fei got the money back through his friends. It’s more than 80 million!”

Pan Qiang and Wang Zhihai were both surprised. Wang Zhihai looked at Xia ruofei and said,””Comrade ruofei, it looks like you’re doing well in the local area! We’ve heard about uncle Qian’s case. Even the court won’t be able to get the money back!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said in a low – Profile manner,””I don’t have that kind of ability! I just happened to have a friend in Xiang Nan Province. He’s quite influential, so I helped uncle Qian out ...”
