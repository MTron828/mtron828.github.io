2502 First time meeting (1)

Wu Lei looked the same as he did on TV and in photos, but in reality, he looked more innocent and shy. His small eyes, short hair, and somewhat honest appearance made it difficult for people to have any bad feelings about him.

However, Wu Lei was clearly a little reserved in front of his Big Boss, Zhou leiyun.

Zhou leiyun was not only the chairman of the RCD Espanyol club, but this club was just a playful investment by him. The scale of his assets was one of the best among the private enterprises in the country.

Usually, Zhou leiyun had a lot of things to do, so he did not come to the RCD Espanyol club often. He would appear on the podium for some key games, or he would attend when the club had a big event.

Throughout Wu Lei’s entire transfer process, including his arrival in Spain this time, he was mostly in contact with the interpreter that the Spanish clubs had arranged for him. He did not even meet Zhou leiyun’s agent, Jiang Xiaochen, often.

Now that he was sitting in front of the big boss, Zhou leiyun, how could Wu Lei not be nervous?

“Don’t be so reserved, Wu Lei,”Zhou leiyun chuckled.”We’re all fellow countrymen overseas.” Oh right, I haven’t introduced you to the one beside you! He is ...”

“Director Zhou, director Xia is a famous internet celebrity. In China, as long as you’re on the internet, there’s probably no one who doesn’t know him.” Wu Lei said with a smile.

“Do you guys go online often?” Xia ruofei asked, surprised. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Wu Lei smiled shyly and said,””In addition to competitions and training, my spare time is also very simple. I spend time with my family. When I have time, I go online to watch videos, play games, and browse Weibo. I’m also a Weibo fan of yours!”

...

“Is that so?” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”then I’ll pay attention to you too!”

Xia ruofei took out his phone. He thought for a while and said,”Come on! Let’s take a selfie first! General manager Zhou, come over and sit! Come sit over here!”

Zhou leiyun was slightly older than Zhao Yongjun. He wasn’t very interested in the things that young people played, but since Xia ruofei had invited him, he still had to show his support.

Hence, Zhou leiyun stood up and walked to the seat opposite him with a smile. Wu Lei quickly squeezed in. The three of them sat side by side in the booth. Xia ruofei raised his phone and took a few selfies.

Then, Xia ruofei opened the Weibo app and followed Wu Lei’s post. Then, he posted another post: I’ve met director in Barcelona. I’m looking forward to Wu Lei’s performance in the top league!

The accompanying picture on Weibo was selected from the few selfies he had just taken.

Both Xia ruofei and Zhou leiyun’s attitudes were friendly and approachable. Wu Lei’s nervousness was reduced by a lot. He smiled and said,””President Xia, you’re still on the hot search list! This time, I can ride on your popularity!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you still need to ride on my popularity!” You’re the most popular person in the domestic football world these days! Everyone is very concerned about your every move! If we’re talking about freeloading, at most, we’re freeloading each other! Hahaha!”

Zhou leiyun had already returned to his seat and sat down. He smiled and said,””Wu Lei, although you’re more familiar with President Xia, I can guarantee that you don’t know about his other identity!”

“Oh?” Wu Lei was stunned for a moment before he said,”director Zhou, then can you tell me what other identity director Xia has?”

Zhou leiyun laughed and said,”a shareholder of the real Espanyol club!” And he was the second largest shareholder! You don’t know about this, do you?”

...

“Ah?” Wu Lei was really shocked this time.”Why haven’t I heard of it before?”

He had done a lot of research before coming to Spain. He had some understanding of the Spanish club’s equity structure, especially the big boss Zhou opposite him. He was the club’s absolute controlling shareholder and the club chairman. He was clear about all these, but he did not know that Xia ruofei was also a shareholder of the club.

Zhou leiyun chuckled and said,”it’s not just you. The number of people who know about this can be counted on ten fingers!” Because the transfer of shares has just been completed, there is no time to change it in Spain!”

“Wu Lei, general manager Zhou transferred a portion of his shares to me.” Xia ruofei explained with a smile.

“Oh! “So that’s how it is ...” Wu Lei obviously had not recovered from this shocking news.

“But don’t worry! I reduced my Holdings not because I was not optimistic about the RCD Espanyol. On the contrary, I was very optimistic about the future of our club, so I gave part of my shares to President Xia. We are friends!” Zhou leiyun said,”therefore, we will continue to support the club’s development. We will also increase our investment when necessary to strengthen the club’s strength!”

Zhou leiyun’s investment in the Spanish clubs was indeed for fun, but it was also because he was optimistic about China’s huge football market, especially after the introduction of Wu Lei. These days, Wu Lei had not officially appeared, but the influence of the Spanish clubs in China had risen sharply. Even the stock Price of Glory World Group had risen because of the stimulation of this good news.

With glory world corporation’s huge size, a slight rise in the stock price would bring huge wealth.

Moreover, Zhou leiyun had already joined hands with Xia ruofei to invest in the Spanish football club. Just based on this point alone, it was even more impossible for him to give up. Even if it meant that he would lose money in the long run, he would continue to invest.
