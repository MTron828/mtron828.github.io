2484 Flying to the Qiantang (1)

Translator: 5496903“What reward plan?” Feng Rao was taken aback.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”we’re going to take over the pharmaceutical group’s team!” Didn’t you say that they’ve worked hard and achieved great merits? I also agree that it’s not enough to give them a big red packet. I’ve decided to arrange for this team to go to Spain a few days! The company will cover all the expenses!”

Feng Rao finally reacted and said with a smile,”Sure! How generous! Then do I get a share?”

“Of course you can go!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”if we’re talking about hard work, my dear sister ran is the one who has worked the hardest in the entire company! You’re more qualified to enjoy this benefit than anyone else!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Feng Rao’s face couldn’t help but heat up as she said in a low voice, “You’re treating me like a child again! Don’t think that you can make me work like a horse for the company! You capitalists, none of you are good!”

“I don’t think I’ll go ...” Feng Jing continued,”you’re not in the company, and there’s a lot of work going on in every department. Someone has to be in charge of the company.” However, the team led by director Dong had indeed worked very hard this time, so it was necessary to reward them. I won’t tell them about this for now. When the time comes, you can announce it yourself and give them a surprise!”

“Thank you, sister Che!” Xia ruofei said sincerely.

After ending the call with Feng Jing, Xia ruofei immediately called Qin Yanan.

“Yanan, help me book a ticket to Qiantang in Jiangsu and Zhejiang for tomorrow morning.” Xia ruofei said.

Paradise had just flown from the capital to the three mountains to send Ling Qingxue back. Xia ruofei didn’t want to bring the crew back from the three mountains. He wasn’t a person who paid too much attention to the enjoyment of life. It was only a total of two hours to fly from the capital to Qiantang. Even if he took Economy Class, it was no big deal, so he simply asked Qin Yanan to book a ticket for him to fly directly.

“Yes, Chairman!” Qin Yanan immediately said.

When Xia ruofei returned to the private room, song Rui and the rest were still singing “fake monk”. He happily opened a can of beer and sat on the sofa alone to drink.

Xia ruofei finished his dinner at the peach blossom banquet and bade farewell to song Rui and the rest. He returned to the courtyard at liuhai Lane.

The next morning, after he had his breakfast, he took Wu Qiang’s car to the airport.

Qin Yanan had booked a flight at around 10 am. She had already sent the flight details to Xia ruofei via WeChat yesterday.

When they arrived at the airport, Xia ruofei asked Wu Qiang to go back. He dragged the small boarding case to the VIP counter to change his boarding pass. Then, he went through the security check and went to the VIP lounge to rest. Qin Yanan had booked him a first – Class ticket.

The traffic at the airport was normal. Xia ruofei’s flight took off on time and landed in Qiantang city, the provincial capital of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, at a little past 12.

When Xia ruofei dragged his boarding box and walked out of the corridor, he saw Qin Yanan and he Yu standing in the crowd of people who were waiting to receive him. Dong Yun was beside them and they were waving at him.

The three of them were all good – looking and could be noticed at a glance in the crowd.

As soon as Xia ruofei walked past the yellow no – go line, Dong Yun and the others who had already come up to him snatched his login case.

Xia ruofei wanted to decline. After all, the luggage was not heavy. It was just for show and there was nothing in it. As a man, how could he let a girl help him with his luggage?

However, when he saw Dong Yun pass her luggage to a tall and strong young man beside her, he retracted his hand.

As long as it wasn’t a lady who helped with the luggage, it was still acceptable.

Dong Yun did not introduce the tall and strong young man to Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei guessed that he was the driver of the insurance company so he did not ask further.

“Yanan, Heyu, why are you here?” he asked.

Qin Yanan deliberately showed an aggrieved expression and said,””Chairman, we’re responsible for your safety! But you’ve only been in the company for a few days, and we’ve been doing nothing every day. We’re afraid that people will say we’re idle!”

In fact, Qin Yanan was exaggerating a little. Even if they stayed in the headquarters of the three mountains, they still had a lot of work to do, including the maintenance of Xia ruofei’s social media account and remote reporting to Xia ruofei for instructions. At the same time, they also participated in some of the daily work in the president’s office. Even if they were not too busy every day, they were not idle every day.

“Isn’t it good to have some free time?”Xia ruofei laughed.

He was just asking casually. Since Qin Yanan’s enthusiasm for work was so high, how could he dampen their enthusiasm? It wasn’t like the company couldn’t afford the travel expenses.

“President Dong, you’ve all worked hard these days!” Xia ruofei continued.

Dong Yun did look Haggard. It seemed that it was really hard on her to take over the pharmaceutical Group at Qiantang.

“Chairman, although the work here is a bit tiring, we’re all full of energy!” Dong Yun said with a smile. When they thought that such a big pharmaceutical Group would be under our company, everyone was so excited!”

“Are you exaggerating?” Xia ruofei laughed.

“It’s true! It’s not an exaggeration at all!” Dong Yun said seriously,”CEO Xue from the pharmaceutical factory still has a renovation project to monitor at San Shan, so he’s been running from one end to the other. He doesn’t even rest for more than three hours a day. I think he’s lost a bit of weight, but he’s still quite energetic!”
