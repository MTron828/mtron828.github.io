2235 Start of recording_Gao Jun and Xia ruofei had a good conversation. Of course, his visit was just to show his attitude. He did not talk about the details with Xia ruofei. After chatting for about an hour, he got up and left. He did not stay for dinner.

“Director Gao,” Xia ruofei said with a smile,”I’ll invite you over after the show is over!”

“I should be the one treating you!” Gao Jun quickly said. The station is very grateful for your selfless support for the festival Group!”

Xia ruofei laughed in his heart. Because of this “selfless support”, Gao Jun almost had a connection with Hou Liang. Although Hou Liang’s father couldn’t just leave Gao Jun alone, it would have a great impact on Gao Jun if he left a bad impression on the leader.

This possibility was very high. After all, Hou Liang was considered a younger brother in Xia ruofei’s small circle, including Wei Jun ‘s. Their families were much weaker than Zhao Yongjun, song Rui, Liu Jian, and Xu Zixuan. Hou Liang’s family was very happy that they could follow Xia ruofei and his group.

If Hou Liang really went back to get some fresh air, his father would definitely pay a lot of attention when he found out that it was because of Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei naturally wouldn’t tell Gao Jun about yesterday’s incident. He just smiled and said,””We’re all friends, so it doesn’t matter who’s treating who!”

“Yes, yes, yes! We’re friends!” Gao Jun said happily,”President Xia, please wait! Please wait!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Alright then. Director Gao, I won’t see you off. Yanan, help me see director Gao off!”

“Yes, Chairman!” Qin Yanan said.

Then, she smiled at Gao Jun and said,””Director Gao, this way please!”

……

After Gao Jun left, Qin Yanan and he Yu went to Xia ruofei’s room and reported to him about the progress of the docking in the past two days.

Xia ruofei listened attentively. After all, the details were related to the filming of the show. He was not like some celebrities who were arrogant. Since he had promised to record an episode of the show, he would do his best to cooperate. After all, it was not easy for the festival team. It was very hard to coordinate so many things.

In the end, Qin Yanan said,”Chairman, that’s the general situation. As for the details, if there are any problems during the recording process, we’ll deal with it at the last minute.” When you’re recording the program, he Yu and I will be accompanying you the entire time. ”

“Alright, you’ve all worked hard!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Oh! By the way, the TV station said that the production crew might be coming earlier tomorrow morning. ” Qin Yanan said,”but they said that you should just follow your normal daily routine. It’s best to pretend that they don’t exist. That way, it’ll be the most natural for the photos to be filmed.”

Many people’s hearts would more or less change when they were in front of the camera. Whether it was the tone of their speech, their expressions, or their actions, they would be different from usual. When it was broadcasted on television, it did not look natural.

Professional actors would not have such a problem. After all, they had been specially trained. They were only afraid of guests like Xia ruofei who had never learned how to act but could not be offended. If they could not get any useful material, the post – editing would be troublesome. After all, they did not dare to ask Xia ruofei to cooperate and re – record.

Xia ruofei laughed,”understood!” It was like the camera did not exist! No problem!”

His mental fortitude had been specially trained by the Army, and with his business growing in the past few years, he had seen all kinds of big scenes. How could he have stage fright in front of a camera?

As they were about to participate in a day and a half of filming, Xia ruofei and the others had a simple chat about the filming tomorrow after dinner. Then, Qin Yanan and he Yu diligently helped Xia ruofei clean up his originally clean room before returning to the front yard to rest.

……

The next day, Qin Yanan and he Yu woke up very early because the xiangnan TV crew would be arriving very early. They had to start filming from the morning until Xia ruofei arrived at the mushroom house.

Very quickly, a business car from xiangnan TV arrived at liuhai Lane. He Yu, who was waiting at the entrance, led the car to the front yard and parked it.

Qin Yanan stood in the courtyard, greeting the editors and photographers of xiangnan TV. These past two days, she and he Yu had gone to the hotel to work with the program team, so they were already very familiar with these staff.

The head of the team, Liu Yan, smiled and said,””Manager Qin, let’s start work right away!”

“No problem!” Qin Yanan smiled.”President Xia has already instructed that you can shoot as many photos as you want today! Come, teachers, this way please! President Xia is staying in the second courtyard ...”

Qin Yanan led Liu Yan and the others to the master’s courtyard in the middle. A few cameramen had already started recording with their cameras.

The courtyard in the early morning was very quiet. Although it was in the city center, it was more than a hundred meters away from the main street of Desheng Gate, which was full of traffic. Moreover, the courtyard was very deep, so the noise from the outside world couldn’t reach here at all. It was really quiet in the midst of chaos.

When Liu Yan and the others arrived at the master’s courtyard, they couldn’t help but tread lightly.

The door to Xia ruofei’s suite was tightly shut. Qin Yanan and the others thought that Xia ruofei was still sleeping. After all, the crew had arrived too early.
