Chapter 1284: Super Sea View House (3)

Translator: 549690339

The building had 23 floors. Xia ruofei’s house took up the 22nd and 23rd floors.

There were two staircases and two households in each unit. Only by swiping the owner card could one reach the corresponding floor, so the privacy was quite high.

On the 22nd floor, the person in charge of the Property Management Office personally entered the facial recognition and fingerprint identification information for Xia ruofei.

This was recorded for the Security Control System of the house and was necessary for Xia ruofei to enter and leave the house in the future.

While Xia ruofei was recording the information, Guo shunian explained softly,””Mr. Xia, the residents of the Emerald Garden community are all high – end people, so we have made a lot of efforts in security. Every house has an integrated security system and also uses smart home technology, which is very convenient to control. The security system is directly connected to the police station and fire station, and it has a very high priority. Once it senses the danger of a fire, it will automatically connect to the fire station’s alarm system. ”

Xia ruofei nodded.

No matter where it was, it was impossible for the privileged class to disappear. Obviously, the residents of the Emerald Home enjoyed a little privilege. Xia ruofei was not surprised by this.

Xia ruofei walked into the house and took a quick look.

Although the building area was only about 160 square meters, it was actually very spacious. Moreover, the living room area of the houses in Hong Kong was very large. Many of the units had a living room that reached one – third or even one – half of the total area.

Therefore, after walking into the living room, it really did look like a luxurious mansion.

Of course, this also had to do with the luxurious decorations of the house itself.

“Mr. Xia,” Guo shunian said,”this was completed at the beginning of the year. Director Guo said that if you’re not satisfied with the style, we can get rid of it and renovate it again. We’ll make sure it’s according to your wishes.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”it’s such a pity to destroy such a good decoration!” I think this is pretty good!”

“Alright!” Guo shunian said respectfully.

Xia ruofei looked up and down and was very satisfied with the layout of the house.

Other than the large living room, there was also a large balcony on the first floor. The kitchen, dining room, bathroom, and other facilities were all on the first floor, as well as two guest rooms.

The Super – large master bedroom on the second floor was about 30 to 40 square meters, with a bathroom with a Jacuzzi and a large cloakroom.

Next to the master bedroom was a study facing the sea. There was also a door in the master bedroom that led directly to the study.

In addition, there were three guest rooms.

In addition, since this was already the top floor, it came with an extra large terrace of more than 20 square meters. From three sides, one could see the unparalleled sea view. Standing on the terrace and looking out into the distance, it indeed gave a relaxed and happy feeling.

Xia ruofei was very satisfied after looking at it. He knew that this was definitely the best location and the best floor plan in the entire community.

He was afraid that the price of 40 million Hong Kong dollars that he had previously mentioned was far from enough.

“Uncle Guo, please convey my gratitude to director Guo when you get back,” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”this gift is really too dreamy!”

“Mr. Xia, you’re too kind.” Guo shunian bowed slightly and said,”I’ll definitely inform director Guo.”

“Mr. Xia, we have just received a call from the flight crew. They said that the wind has changed. According to the current trend, the airport will open again in about 40 minutes. Should we go to the airport now?”

“Then what are we waiting for?” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’ve long been eager to return home! Let’s go!”
