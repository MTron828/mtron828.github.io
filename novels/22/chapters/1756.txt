Chapter 1757: Reunion after a short separation (2)

Wu Qiang had already tactfully returned to his room, and his door was tightly shut.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue went to the kitchen together. In fact, Xia ruofei was the one doing the work while Ling Qingxue was in charge of washing and choosing the vegetables. However, it was still very fun when the two of them worked together.

In a short while, Xia ruofei had made three dishes, one soup, and two braised dishes that he had bought from the supermarket. It was more than enough for two people to eat. He had also bought the rice from the supermarket. He just had to heat it up when he returned.

Xia ruofei also opened a bottle of wine. It was the newly brewed half – Lon. The two of them ate and drank as they chatted. The atmosphere was very warm. After they finished eating, they cleaned up the dishes, the kitchen, and the dining room together. Then they returned to the courtyard in the middle.

In fact, Wu Qiang would naturally clean up the dishes if they were placed in the kitchen. However, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue liked this kind of homely atmosphere, so they did things like washing the dishes.

When they returned to Xia ruofei’s courtyard, the two of them went straight to the main room.

Apart from a living room, there was a large bedroom and a matching bathroom in the main room that spanned across the East and West courtyards. It was equivalent to a large suite.

“Qingxue, go take a shower first!” Xia ruofei said.

“Mm! “I smell on my body ...” Ling Qingxue said.

She had been on the plane for more than two hours and had been cooking in the kitchen with Xia ruofei. Naturally, the smell on her body was a little strong. For someone like her who had slight mysophobia, this was something that was hard to bear.

Xia ruofei looked at Ling Qingxue, who was opening her luggage to look for her home clothes. He smiled and asked,””Do you want to shower together? The bathtub in the bathroom is super big ...”

Ling Qingxue blushed and lowered her eyes.”I don’t want to!”

She quickly found her clothes and shyly wrapped her undergarments in her home clothes. Then she said,””Don’t come over!”

Then, Ling Qingxue walked into the bathroom and locked the door.

It was easy for Xia ruofei to open the door, but he wouldn’t do that. When he heard the sound of water coming from the bathroom, he felt the fire in his lower abdomen slowly rising ...

Hence, Xia ruofei also quickly found his pajamas and walked out of the main room.

The wing – rooms in this courtyard had been renovated into guest rooms, and each room had a matching bathroom.

Xia ruofei randomly found a guest room and took a quick shower. After changing his clothes, he returned to the main room. Ling Qingxue had not come out yet. After all, girls always took a longer time to shower.

Xia ruofei waited impatiently for a while before he finally heard the door open. He turned around and saw Ling Qingxue in her pajamas, drying her hair with a towel as she walked out in her slippers.

Seeing that Xia ruofei had changed into his pajamas, Ling Qingxue could not help but smile and ask,””Why didn’t you take a shower before changing?”

“I’ll take a shower in the guest room next door!”Xia ruofei said.

Ling Qingxue’s face turned slightly red as she said softly,””You can’t wait?”

There was a hint of teasing in her words, and Xia ruofei was immediately aroused. He walked over and held Ling Qingxue’s hand, his breathing a little heavy.”Wife, you haven’t seen the bedroom yet! Let’s go! I’ll take you around ...”

“Just for a visit!” Ling Qingxue said with a smile.

Xia ruofei could not care less. He pulled Ling Qingxue, who was hesitating, and pushed the bedroom door open.

The moment they entered the room, Xia ruofei hugged Ling Qingxue’s delicate body tightly. Then, the two of them fell onto the bed while kissing.

“My hair isn’t dry yet ...” Ling Qingxue chuckled.

“I’ll help you dry it later!” Xia ruofei said as he lowered his head and kissed her.

Ling Qingxue’s resistance was only symbolic. Soon, the warm bedroom was filled with sounds that made people’s faces turn red and their hearts beat faster ...

......

The next morning, the chirping of birds on the pomegranate tree outside the courtyard woke Xia ruofei up from his sleep. He rubbed his eyes and turned to look.

Ling Qingxue was still sleeping soundly. Her Jet – Black hair covered half of her face, and her lips were curled up into a beautiful smile. She seemed to have encountered something very happy in her sleep.

Last night, the two of them, who had not seen each other for a long time, went crazy for the whole night. It was not until two in the morning that Ling Qingxue, who could not bear to be tortured, kept begging for mercy. The two of them fell asleep in each other’s arms.

Xia ruofei looked at Ling Qingxue’s lazy sleeping posture and couldn’t help but feel a rush of excitement. He lowered his head and gently kissed her delicate cheek. Then, he got out of bed quietly.

In order not to wake Ling Qingxue up, Xia ruofei specially found a bathroom in the guest room to wash up and then walked to the backyard.

Wu Qiang had already bought breakfast from the alley and was sweeping the backyard. When he saw Xia ruofei, he quickly stopped and greeted him.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and walked into the kitchen.

He filled up a small bowl of congee, took two sets of bowls and chopsticks, took a few deep – fried dough sticks, steamed buns, and other things. Then, he said to Wu Qiang,””I’ll take the breakfast back to eat! Get ready, we’ll leave at 8:30!”

“Yes, President Xia!” Wu Qiang said. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Xia ruofei returned to the main room in the middle courtyard. All the rooms in the courtyard had floor heaters, so the room was as warm as spring.

Xia ruofei was in the living room. He placed the breakfast on the coffee table and then quietly walked back to the bedroom.

As soon as Xia ruofei entered the room, he saw that Ling Qingxue had already woken up and was reaching for her undergarments on the ground. The clothes from last night were all over the place. After the fierce battle, she had fallen asleep hugging her.

Looking at Ling Qingxue’s half – covered body under the blanket, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel a burst of heat.

He took a deep breath and asked with a smile,””Why didn’t you sleep a little longer? It’s still early!”

Ling Qingxue bent down and put her hands behind her back to button her shirt as she said,””I was in a daze and wanted to hug you, but I didn ‘t, so I woke up ... Where did you go?”

“I’m preparing breakfast for you!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”since you’re awake, get up! The morning air was good! I’ll take you out for a walk!”

“How can the air in Beijing be good? Why don’t I believe you?” Ling Qingxue said with a half – Smile.

“At least the air in our courtyard is quite fresh!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ve brought breakfast. How about we eat in the yard later?”

“Alright!” Ling Qingxue asked as she put on her clothes,”what time does the morning activity start?”

“Teno’ clock sharp!” Xia ruofei said,”we’ll leave at 8:30!”

By the time Ling Qingxue was done washing up, Xia ruofei had already packed the porridge and placed it on the stone table under the grape trellis along with the deep – fried dough sticks, steamed buns, and mantou.

The two of them finished their breakfast together.

Although the items were simple, the two of them felt happy and harmonious, as if they were living at home.

At 8:30 am, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue set off for little Tang town.

Wu Qiang was driving in the front, and the two of them sat in the back seat with their fingers intertwined. Xia ruofei was enthusiastically introducing the scenery along the way to Ling Qingxue. Ling Qingxue tilted her head and leaned on Xia ruofei’s shoulder, her face full of happiness.

It was the morning rush hour when they left, so they had to stop and walk all the way. Fortunately, they had plenty of time. As long as they were not stuck in a traffic jam, they would be fine.

After leaving the city, the car gradually picked up speed and arrived at the construction site in little Tang town at about 9:40.

When Xia ruofei got out of the car, he realized that the land had changed.

First of all, the land had been simply leveled. Then, at the boundary of the land, there was a flag inserted about a meter apart. The flag was of various colors, and on it was printed the symbol of the peach blossom Association.

In addition, a stage was set up at the main venue of the groundbreaking ceremony by the lake, and the background was also a large spray – painted symbol of the peach blossom society. In front of the stage were neatly arranged plastic chairs, and on both sides of the stage and behind the seats, there were construction machinery such as excavators and shovels.

These construction machines were all clean and each machine was hung with a festive red cloth.

On the side of the venue, there was a long table with all kinds of desserts, delicacies, and poured red wine on it. All the food was covered with a transparent cover.

There were also two chefs who were constantly making delicious food in front of the simple operating table at the end of the long table.

“Well done!” Xia ruofei muttered to himself.

Ling Qingxue also looked around with interest. This was the first time she had seen this piece of land.

At the entrance of the venue, there was a large effect drawing that Lu Yifan had worked overtime on. The final design draft might be different from this effect drawing.

“Mini – golf, swimming pool, spa sanatorium ...” Ling Qingxue mumbled to herself as she looked around. Then, she exclaimed excitedly,”found it!” Gourmet House! Look, RUO Fei, there’s even the of our Ling Ji restaurant on it!”
