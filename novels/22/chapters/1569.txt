Chapter 1570: An unexpected surprise (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei said,”Song Wei, you’ve already felt the genuine Qi circulating in your meridians. What you need to do now is to feel it according to the introductory heart technique of the” absolute beginning Scripture “. Only when your dantian forms a wisp of genuine Qi that truly belongs to you can we start cultivating together.”

Song Wei nodded her head and said,”I know, I’ve already memorized the mantra. I’ll work hard next!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”I forgot to tell you. The spiritual Qi on earth is very poor. Besides the two hours of midnight and dawn, we can’t cultivate at any other time.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The process of cultivation was, in fact, to absorb the free spiritual energy in the air and transform it into true Qi in the dantian. If the spiritual energy in the outside environment was too chaotic and violent, it was naturally impossible to absorb it, and there was no need to talk about cultivation.

“Ah?” Song Wei was dumbfounded.”What should we do then? In this case, the time formation is meaningless!”

Xia ruofei chuckled,”don’t you have me?” What I said was under normal circumstances, but now that we have this, we can cultivate without time constraints!”

With that, Xia ruofei flashed the spiritual crystal in his hand.

“What is this?” Song Wei asked curiously as she looked at the crystal.

“You’re lucky. I got this in the underground palace. ” Xia ruofei said,”it’s called a spiritual crystal. It’s the product of the solidification of spiritual Qi after it reaches the extreme concentration ...”

Xia ruofei briefly introduced the crystals to Song Wei and smiled,”What you need to do now is to hold this spiritual crystal in your hand and sense the spiritual Qi in it. Then, use the introductory cultivation technique of the” Scripture of the primordium origin “to absorb the spiritual Qi into your body and transform it into true Qi in your dantian. As long as you can do this, we’re already half – done!”

The introductory manual of the “Scripture of the primordium origin” could cultivate true Qi on its own. This was also in consideration of the needs of beginners who cultivated the “Scripture of the primordium origin”.

However, this beginner cultivation technique was very ordinary. It could only cultivate a small amount of true Qi. If he relied on this cultivation technique to cultivate alone, the efficiency would be so low that it would make one’s hair stand.

Therefore, the correct way to operate it was to start the two – person cooperation after the cultivator had produced true Qi. The same cultivation method, under the situation of two people cooperating, the effect of one plus one was far greater than two. This was also the magic of this cultivation method.

Song Wei nodded her head and carefully took the spiritual crystal.

Xia ruofei stood up and said,”you stay in the formation and study it. I’ll go out and prepare something for you to eat!”

Due to the time formation, even though they only had one morning, Song Wei might actually spend many days in the formation. Xia ruofei naturally had to prepare some food.

When he was in Hunan Province, he bought some biscuits, instant noodles, and other food that were easy to store. He had been storing them in the spirit map space.

Hence, Xia ruofei did not need to go out. He went straight to his bedroom and took out the outdoor backpack from his interspace. After he carried it to the living room, he rummaged through the backpack and found the food. He put it in a plastic bag and returned to the array.

It took Xia ruofei at most two to three minutes to finish all these things.

In other words, Song Wei should have spent more than four hours in the array.

When Xia ruofei entered the array, he noticed that Song Wei was still sitting cross – legged with her eyes closed. She was holding the spiritual crystal in her hand.

Perhaps she had heard the sound of Xia ruofei entering the formation, Song Wei opened her eyes and said with uncertainty,””Ruofei, I ... I think I’ve cultivated a trace of true Qi ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but widen his eyes and cry out,””So fast!”

Even if the spiritual crystal contained a huge amount of spiritual Qi, Song Wei had not even started cultivating it. If one were to look at it alone, the cultivation technique of the “absolute beginning Scripture” was also very ordinary. However, she could actually sense Qi in just over four hours and even cultivate a trace of true Qi. This speed was a little shocking.

“Is there a problem?” Song Wei asked nervously,”I just followed the introductory mantra and focused on sensing it. I seemed to have produced true Qi in a daze. Did I cultivate it wrong?” Will I go crazy?”

“Don’t be nervous. Let me take a look ...” Xia ruofei said.

Then, he grabbed Song Wei’s hand and sent a wisp of true Qi through his body to his dantian.

In the next moment, Xia ruofei looked at Song Wei in shock and was speechless for a long time.

It really was not Song Wei’s imagination, nor was it that she had taken a wrong path in her cultivation. There was indeed a new wisp of true Qi in her dantian. Although it was still very weak, it really existed.

This cultivation speed was even faster than Xia ruofei’s proud disciple, Tang Haoran.

Seeing Xia ruofei’s shocked expression, Song Wei could not help but feel more nervous.

She quickly asked,”ruofei, what’s the situation?” Don’t scare me ...”

Xia ruofei came back to her senses and hurriedly said,””It’s fine, it’s fine! Don’t be afraid, you’ve indeed cultivated true Qi ...”

Then, Xia ruofei looked at Song Wei strangely and said,””Song Wei, you really don’t show your true self! I didn’t expect you to be so talented in cultivation!”
