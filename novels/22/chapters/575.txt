Chapter 576: Chapter 437 – in full swing (3)

“Alright!” Feng ke said.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”since we don’t have any fresh Dendrobium strips now, we should tear down the row of houses and build houses on the spot!” In addition, the clay stove, iron pot, and all the other tools needed to make the iron – skinned maple bucket were also prepared in advance according to high standards. We have to hurry up. In one and a half months to two months at most, the new batch of Ironhide vessel strips will be delivered here. By then, master Luo will bring Xiaojun and the others to make the fengdou!”

“Alright, then I’ll contact manager li tonight and tell him to prepare in advance. We’ll start work tomorrow!” Feng Rao said as she quickly recorded the information.

Xia ruofei was a little embarrassed as he said,””Boss Feng, isn’t it a little unkind of me to give you so much work at once?”

Feng Rao looked at Xia ruofei with watery eyes and said,””I’m already used to being exploited by you, capitalist!”

Xia ruofei raised his head and laughed.”Alright, alright. That’s all I have to do.”

Feng Jing stood up.”Chairman, please wait for a moment. I’ll type out the latest report to you. Then, I’ll report to you about the situation over the past few days!”

Xia ruofei looked at his watch and said,””Time to get off work! There’s no hurry to report. It’s not too late to report after the negotiations tomorrow. Let’s go eat first!”

“I’m not hungry!”Feng Rao said with a smile. Besides, there were still a lot of things to deal with! Chairman, you go ahead and eat ...”

“How can I do that? If I starve you to death, wouldn’t that be insulting one of my generals?” Xia ruofei said,”eating is more important than anything else! The Emperor didn’t lack hungry soldiers! We’ll talk after dinner!”

With that, Xia ruofei dragged Feng Rao out without further ado. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Feng Jing felt that Xia ruofei’s palm was very warm and soft. She blushed and sneaked a glance at Xia ruofei. She only saw that Xia ruofei’s eyes were clear and had no other intentions.

Xia ruofei naturally did not have any improper thoughts. He only pulled Feng Jing a few steps before letting go of her.

......

Feng Jing moved her fingers gently and followed Xia ruofei out of the office.

The canteen was much livelier than before. Many of the administrative team’s employees lived on the farm, so places with many young people were naturally full of vitality.

When the employees saw Xia ruofei, they all greeted him respectfully. Xia ruofei also had a gentle smile on his face and nodded to everyone.

When it came to food, Xia ruofei never made it special. He ate the same as the employees and used his credit card to eat.

Since Feng Jing and Xia ruofei were sitting at the same table, the other employees naturally did not join in the fun.

As Xia ruofei ate, he discussed with Feng Jing about the negotiation tomorrow. He wanted to convey his thoughts to Feng Jing so that she would be more confident in the negotiation tomorrow.

After eating, Feng Jing immediately went back to her office.

Xia ruofei had given her a few tasks in a row. She had to work overtime tonight.

At the same time, Feng Rao also appointed a few young employees to work overtime on the first draft of the design for the exterior of the tin bucket.

After Xia ruofei finished eating, he went straight back to the small villa.

He had been in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province for two to three days, and it was not convenient for him to enter the realm since he was out. Xia ruofei also missed Blackie and the rest a little. Also, counting the days, he could take the pregnancy soup again today.

It had been a few weeks since he had tried to unlock the contents of the making method of the spiritual puppet. Xia ruofei wanted to quickly consume the soup and try to unlock the contents of the making method of the spiritual puppet.

As soon as he got into his room, he closed the door and windows tightly, and even drew the curtains tightly.

Then, he summoned the spirit painting scroll from his palm and disappeared from the room.
