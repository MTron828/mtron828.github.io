2586 A call from the capital city (1)

After the message was sent, Song Wei replied almost instantly with a series of ‘frightened’ emojis. There were as many as seven or eight of them.

Immediately after, Song Wei sent a voice message,””You’re in my house? What’s going on?”

Xia ruofei laughed and pressed the voice button on WeChat.”What other situation could there be? Of course, I’m the one who’s here to propose marriage to uncle and Auntie! We drank and chatted happily, and uncle and aunty even warmly invited me to stay the night! It’s hard to refuse such kindness, so I can only respectfully accept it!”

This time, Song Wei didn’t send Xia ruofei any voice messages. Instead, she sent him a video call invitation.

Xia ruofei accepted the video call and looked at Song Wei on the screen. He smiled and said,””Weiwei, why are you in such a hurry to see me?”

“Don’t mess around!” Song Wei said coyly,”tell me the truth! Why are you in my house? You’re not allowed to talk about marriage ...”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”alright!” Actually, I’m here to check on uncle song!”

“A follow – up?” Song Wei’s expression changed.”Didn’t my dad recover? Could it be that the injury is acting up again?”

“No! No! No!” Xia ruofei quickly said,”don’t worry. Uncle song is in good health!”

“Then what are you going to do?” Song Wei asked in confusion.

“Isn’t this just a way to please my future father – in – Law and mother – in – Law?” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Speak properly!” Song Wei said as she rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei.

“Alright! Alright!” Xia ruofei said,”I did find a reason that uncle song couldn’t refuse, but I didn’t come to propose marriage or to get close to him ... Weiwei, do you still remember what I promised you? I said that I would find a suitable cultivation technique for uncle song, and no matter what price I had to pay, I would help him step onto the path of cultivation ...”

Song Wei’s eyes widened when she heard that. Her voice started to tremble.”Ruofei, could it be that ... You came to my house today just to teach my father some cultivation techniques?”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. Then, he briefly told Song Wei what happened today. Finally, he smiled and said,”I had no choice. He wouldn’t believe me if I told him directly, and you’re far away in Beijing, so you can’t help. In the end, after thinking about it, I decided that only being a doctor would be useful. That’s why I thought of this ...”

Song Wei’s eyes were red. She stared at Xia ruofei on the screen and said softly,”Ruofei, thank you for everything you’ve done for me!”

Xia ruofei grinned and said,”there’s no need to be so polite between us.” This is what I promised you, and I’m just fulfilling my promise. And ... Since uncle song already has the physique to cultivate, if you don’t cultivate, wouldn’t it be a waste of your talent?”

Although Xia ruofei made it sound easy, Song Wei was no longer a newbie. She knew very well that it was difficult to find a cultivation technique that was suitable for song Qiming’s age. Moreover, Xia ruofei could not tell song Qiming the truth. At the same time, he had to guide song Qiming to cultivate correctly. It must have taken a lot of effort.

Song Wei looked at Xia ruofei’s smiling face on the screen. Her heart was filled with warmth and sweetness.

Xia ruofei saw that Song Wei was in a daze and didn’t say anything, so he smiled and said,””Wei Wei, don’t worry. Uncle song’s talent isn’t bad. He only tried it for the first time today, but I’ve already guided him to take the first step! The beginning is always the hardest, so in the future, you just need to persist in your cultivation. ”

Song Wei bit her lower lip. She tried to control her tears. She did not want to show weakness in front of Xia ruofei. She only needed to keep those feelings in her heart ...

After a long time, Song Wei nodded and said,””Mm! RUO Fei, I’m very assured with you there ...”

“Silly girl!” Xia ruofei said affectionately,”it’s late. You should take the time to rest! Don’t worry about uncle song!”

“MMH! Good night!” Song Wei said.

After ending the video call with Song Wei, Xia ruofei went to bed early.

The next morning, Xia ruofei woke up on time. After a simple wash, he went to the study.

When Xia ruofei arrived at the study room, it was five minutes to Sixo’ clock. Song Qiming was already waiting there.

“Good Morning, uncle song!” Xia ruofei greeted him and asked,”why didn’t you sleep for a while longer?”

Song Qiming’s face was glowing and he looked good. He laughed and said,””You don’t sleep as much as you get older. I usually wake up around this time, but you ... You’re not used to waking up so early, are you?”

Actually, song Qiming was so excited that he could not fall asleep last night. Moreover, he had spent half the night with Fang Liyun and regained his long – Lost vigor. He was exhausted by the second half of the night and had to wake himself up with the alarm clock in the morning.

However, it was not convenient to tell this junior Xia ruofei ...

Xia ruofei grinned and said,”I don’t know how to!” When I was in the Army, I’ve already developed a biological clock that goes to bed early and wakes up early. After I retired, although my life isn’t so regular anymore, I don’t usually sleep in unless there are special circumstances!”

“It’s better to sleep and wake up early!” Song Qiming said,”young people like to stay up late these days, including Weiwei. We’ve told her so many times, but she doesn’t listen. Help me talk to her when you’re free. It’s not good for a girl to stay up late too much!”

An unnatural expression flashed across Xia ruofei’s face. He concealed his guilt very well and said,””I’ll talk to her when I have the chance ... Uncle song, time is precious, let’s start!”

“Alright!” Song Qiming said quickly.

At first, he wanted to talk about his daughter, but it was obvious that the ‘health – Maintenance method’ he had just learned the night before was more attractive to him.

In the morning, song Qiming had cultivated for about one and a half hours. Xia ruofei had been watching over him the entire time. However, he did not interfere and guide him today. He did not even give him any reminders. On one hand, he was consciously training song Qiming’s ability to cultivate independently. On the other hand, song Qiming was indeed a fast learner. Towards the end, there was basically no need for Xia ruofei to point out any mistakes.

At around 7:30 am, Xia ruofei asked song Qiming to stop his cultivation.

The hour of dawn was a time when the spiritual energy of heaven and earth was relatively peaceful. Without auxiliary cultivation treasures such as spirit crystals and origin crystals, the cultivators on earth generally chose to cultivate at midnight and the hour of dawn. Only the spiritual energy of heaven and earth during these two times could be absorbed by cultivators. The spiritual energy at other times was very heterogeneous and even violent, and could not be absorbed by cultivators at all. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

During this period of time, the spiritual Qi in the outside world was relatively mild. Moreover, song Qiming had a spiritual crystal that stored a large amount of spiritual Qi, so he basically did not have to worry about spiritual Qi when he cultivated.

Even the upper echelons of the cultivation sects on earth could hardly enjoy such cultivation conditions.

After song Qiming stopped cultivating, Xia ruofei “checked” his body again. The main purpose was to check on song Qiming’s physical condition.

After scanning with his mental power, Xia ruofei realized that the genuine Qi in song Qiming’s dantian had grown stronger. The meridians that were involved in the first level of the modest Sutra had also been widened and strengthened to a certain extent.

The results of song Qiming’s cultivation were obviously very good.

Xia ruofei nodded and opened his eyes.”Uncle song, your body is much stronger than yesterday. It’s obvious that we’re on the right path. From today on, you just have to practice more every day!”

“Good! I’ll definitely persevere!” Song Qiming said, then added,”ruofei, it’s all thanks to you! Otherwise, I wouldn’t have noticed it if my body continued to deteriorate day by day!”

Song Qiming believed Xia ruofei’s white lie without a doubt. Xia ruofei could not help but feel embarrassed.

Fortunately, in addition to the improvement of his cultivation, he seemed to have become more thick – skinned these years. Therefore, he did not reveal anything. He only smiled and said a few words, and then changed the topic.

Xia ruofei had breakfast at song Qiming’s house and then left.

During breakfast, Xia ruofei felt that Fang Liyun’s complexion was much better than yesterday. Her face was ruddy and she was in high spirits. He was not sure if it was just his imagination ...

Song Qiming also had to go to work. The chauffeur had already parked the car at the entrance and was ready to leave at any time.

Hence, Xia ruofei’s Knight XV SUV followed song Qiming’s Audi. The two cars left song Qiming’s house in a short time.

Xia ruofei didn’t return to the jiangbin villa district. Instead, he drove directly to the Taoyuan building.

It was rare for Xia ruofei to be in San Shan these few days, and Feng Jing had mentioned it many times, so Xia ruofei followed her advice. As long as he was free, he would go to the company to make his presence known, in case some new employees had not even seen the chairman before.

...

It would be embarrassing if he, the Chairman of the Board, was stopped by the front desk staff when he returned to the company one day ...

Back at the chairman’s office on the top floor, Xia ruofei asked Qin Yanan to make him a cup of tea before he continued to sign the documents.

Administrative work really didn’t suit him. After reading more than a dozen documents, he felt a little dizzy. Just as he was about to get up and look out the window and smoke a cigarette, the phone on his desk rang.

Xia ruofei glanced at the caller ID and frowned slightly before picking up.

“Secretary Liu, what’s the matter?” Xia ruofei asked indifferently.

“My father’s condition has suddenly started to worsen.” On the other end of the phone, Liu Qunfeng said anxiously,”Mr. Fang, no matter where you are now, I’m begging you to come back to Beijing as soon as possible. My father doesn’t seem to be doing well ...”
