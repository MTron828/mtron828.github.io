Chapter 749: Wails of ghosts and howls of wolves_1

Xia ruofei had also left a Hornet with a miniature camera in the bathroom.

He was also stunned when he saw Hu Lili flash into the bathroom on the surveillance screen. However, he was not a Peeping Tom, so he subconsciously wanted to use his mental power to command the Hornet to change direction.

At this moment, Xia ruofei saw that Hu Lili did not open the toilet lid. Instead, she sat on the toilet lid and took out her phone.

Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat. He stopped directing the hornet’s direction. At the same time, he quickly tapped on the computer and the sound in his headphones immediately changed to the surveillance in the bathroom.

Hu Lili quickly pulled out a number and dialed it. A moment later, Hu Lili’s voice came from the headset.””Sister Mei Mei, are you all in position? Okay, okay, she should be out soon. Follow the plan ... Don’t attract any attention. If you do this well, brother Fei will reward you!”

Xia ruofei’s eyes lit up when he heard this. He stared at Hu Lili on the screen with a cold expression.

After the call, Hu Lili sat on the toilet lid and started playing with her phone, showing no intention of going out.

Thinking back to how Xue Fei had specially brought Hu Lili to meet with two street bullies yesterday, Xia ruofei could already guess Hu Lili’s intentions.

However, he continued to observe quietly. Everything was under his control, so he was not in a hurry.

……

Lin Qiao was a few steps slower than Hu Lili. When she saw Hu Lili enter the bathroom first, she could only stand at the door and wait. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

She felt very dizzy. When she was walking just now, her feet were uneven, and she felt as if she was stepping on cotton.

So, Lin Qiao supported herself against the wall with one hand and waited for Hu Lili to finish using the bathroom so that she could go in and drink the “hangover medicine” that Xia ruofei had prepared for her. At the same time, she could also solve her urgent need for Internal Medicine.

......

However, after Hu Lili went in, there was no movement at all, as if she had fallen into the toilet.

Time passed by, but Hu Lili had no intention of coming out.

Lin Qiao felt that she couldn’t stand steadily. What was worse was that she had drunk a lot of alcohol and mineral water just now. Now, she felt more and more thirsty. She couldn’t help but clamp her legs and then gently knock on the door.

“Hu Lili, are you done?” Lin Qiao asked.

Xia ruofei saw Hu Lili sitting on the toilet lid. When she heard the knock on the door, she looked away from her phone and smiled sarcastically.

“Is it Lin Qiao?” Hu Lili deliberately said loudly,”I’m sorry! I’m having a stomachache ... Please wait a little longer! If you’re really in a hurry, you can go to the washroom outside. I’m sorry ...”

“Oh! “That’s fine ...”Lin Qiao shook her head helplessly.

She waited for another two minutes, but Hu Lili still didn’t show any signs of coming out. She couldn’t hold it in any longer. Xuxu could have directly drunk The Hangover medicine in the private room, but her internal emergency was also imminent. She couldn’t help it.

Therefore, Lin Qiao quickly made a decision and walked toward the door with weak steps.

Xia ruofei immediately sat up straight and spread out his spiritual power. Two Hornet bees with super – tiny cameras were in the lead, followed by ten Hornet bees without cameras. When Lin Qiao opened the door, they quickly flew out.

The lighting in the private room was rather dim, and everyone was busy drinking, chatting, and singing. Many people were already sixty to seventy percent tipsy, so they naturally wouldn’t notice such a small target like the Hornet.

Except for one Hornet carrying a super – tiny camera, which was flying close to the ceiling and not far behind Lin Qiao, the rest of the Hornet were flying forward in the shadows of the light boxes on both sides.

The Hornet bees with cameras took the lead, and the remaining ten without cameras followed behind them. They maintained their formation very well.

The Hornets flew higher than the average person, so the waiters in the corridor and the occasional customers didn’t notice them.

In Room 607, Xue Fei took out his phone and sent an emoji to Hu Lili as Lin Qiao was about to leave. Hu Lili, who was in the bathroom, immediately dialed the number.

“She’s out ...”She said.

Then, Hu Lili hung up the phone, stood up, and walked to the sink. She tidied up her clothes and hair in front of the mirror, then took out a makeup box from her bag and slowly touched up her makeup. After that, she opened the door of the bathroom and walked out.

At this time, Lin Qiao had already left the house. Hu Lili had only done this for one purpose, which was to make Lin Qiao use the public bathroom outside.

Little did she know that her and Xue Fei’s every move was under Xia ruofei’s surveillance.

Xia ruofei was not in the mood to pay attention to Xue Fei and Hu Lili for the time being. His attention was mainly focused on Lin Qiao, who was walking out of the door.

After leaving the private room, Lin Qiao looked left and right and found a sign of a washroom on the right, so she went to the right.

In fact, the room closest to Room 607 was on the left, but it required a turn. There was no sign at the corner, so because of the right sign, most of the guests who were not familiar with the terrain would follow the sign and walk straight to the right.
