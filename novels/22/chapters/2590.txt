2591 The ridiculous truth (1)

“I really hope Mr. Xia’s judgment is wrong!” Liu Qunfeng smiled bitterly and said,”but my rationality tells me that this might be the only answer ...”

Xia ruofei shrugged his shoulders and continued to look at Liu Qunfeng, waiting for him to continue.

Liu Qunfeng sighed and said,””Mr. Xia, please give me some time. I will definitely get to the bottom of this matter.”

Xia ruofei smiled faintly.”Of course, no problem. However ... Elder Liu’s current condition isn’t too good. Although I’ve temporarily suppressed his condition with acupuncture, it’s not a long – term solution.” “Also, I have to make it clear to chief Liu that because there was a problem with the storage of this batch of pills, the previous stage of treatment has been lost. Elder Liu’s physical condition is even worse than before I intervened ...”

“I understand!” Liu Qunfeng quickly said,”Mr. Xia, we will definitely give you a satisfactory explanation! Please try your best to save my father’s life ...”

Xia ruofei smiled noncommittally and said,””Then, chief Liu, check yourself first! I won’t be accompanying you. ”

“Alright! Alright!” Liu Qunfeng said quickly and walked Xia ruofei to the door before returning to the room where the pills were stored.

His expression became very stern, and his eyes revealed a trace of coldness, making the burly Man in Black from earlier subconsciously move away from him.

Liu Qunfeng took out his phone and dialed a number,””Inform the core members of the family in the capital to come over immediately. I have something very important to discuss with everyone!” He said.

After making the call, Liu Qunfeng left the room. Before he left, he patted the Man in Black on the shoulder and told him to guard the room with all his might.

……

More than an hour later, in a small meeting room on the first floor of the house, the last core member of the family in Jing, Liu Qunfeng’s youngest sister, Liu Lifang, rushed into the meeting room and said,””There’s a traffic jam on the road! Brother, why did you call everyone over in such a hurry? I’m busy at the company!”

Liu Qunfeng looked at Liu Lifang with a complicated expression. He didn’t answer her question directly, but stood up and said,””Everyone who can be here is already here. Then ... Please follow me upstairs!”

Although elder Liu’s cousin, Liu Chongli, was older than Liu Qunfeng, his status in the family was far lower than Liu Qunfeng ‘s. Therefore, even in front of his own cousin, he didn’t dare to take advantage of his seniority.

However, Liu Chongli still couldn’t help but ask with a smile,”Qunfeng, what’s the matter? Don’t tell me big brother ...”

“My father’s condition is stable for the time being,” said Liu Qunfeng.”It’s my idea to gather everyone here this time. It has nothing to do with my father. ” As for why I called everyone here ... You’ll find out soon enough. Now, follow me upstairs!”

Seeing Liu Qunfeng’s dark face, no one dared to ask any more questions. They all followed him upstairs with questions in their heads.

Liu Qunfeng led the group to the room next to elder Liu ‘S. He went straight to the refrigerator where the pills were stored and said with a dark face,””We’ve found the reason for the deterioration of the old man’s condition. About seven or eight days ago, someone tampered with the old man’s life – saving medicine, causing the medicine to lose its effect. In other words, the old man has actually stopped taking the medicine for seven or eight days, which is why his condition is getting worse by the day!”

Liu Qunfeng’s words caused the core members of the Liu family to turn pale.

If what Liu Qunfeng said was true, then the nature of the matter was serious. This was no longer a simple problem of treatment. Someone had tampered with the pill, which was murder! Old man Liu was like a pillar of support in the Liu family. Any slight change in his physical condition would have a huge impact.

“Qunfeng, this is no small matter. Can you confirm it?” Liu Chongli asked with a serious expression.

Liu Qunfeng nodded and said,””I’m at least 80% confident. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have gathered everyone here.”

“Then we must investigate thoroughly!” Liu Chongli said in a deep voice,”I’d like to see who has the guts to do this! Who is behind this?”

Liu qunfei, Liu Liru, and the others also expressed their desire to find the murderer. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

On the other hand, Liu Lifang’s eyes flickered and her face turned pale after hearing Liu Qunfeng’s words.

Liu Qunfeng glanced at Liu Lifang and said,””We’ll definitely investigate! It’s just that we’re heavily guarded here, and there are even fewer people who can enter and leave this room. These pills are under 24 – hour surveillance, so who can come into contact with them without anyone knowing?”

“Big brother, aren’t there surveillance cameras here?” Liu Liru asked calmly. Why don’t we just check the surveillance cameras? Don’t tell me ... The surveillance footage from seven or eight days ago has been covered up?”

“The server here can store at least a month’s worth of surveillance data, so the surveillance video from seven or eight days ago must be there.” Liu Qunfeng said,”I just hope that this person can step forward on his own, so that everyone won’t be embarrassed!”

Everyone couldn’t help but gasp. Liu Chongli squinted his eyes and asked,”Qunfeng, you mean ... There’s a mole in our Liu family? And the mole is among us?”
