2887 Dumbfounded_

“No problem!” Li Yifu quickly replied. This batch of firearms had already been delivered to the Hong sect and was stored in the warehouse of the shipping company! I’ll contact them immediately and ask them to find a reliable person to contact you!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”okay!” Just send me the specific address and contact information of the docking person as soon as possible. ”

“Alright, martial granduncle!” Li Yifu said. Then, he hesitated for a moment and asked,”grand uncle – Master, may I be so bold as to ask, how do you plan to transport this batch of firearms back? These weapons and equipment take up quite a lot of space. The brothers from the Freemasonry in Mexico said that they almost filled up a whole container ...” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Hearing this, Luo Qingfeng also said with some difficulty,””Master, are you thinking of using a spatial magic treasure to transport these supplies? Although I have a storage ring, the space is very limited. I wonder ... How big is this container?”

Qingfeng Luo had been living in the sect for a long time, so he had no idea what containers were. However, his storage ring could not hold many things, so he was worried that he would screw up. If he could not bring his things back to Mexico after so much difficulty, he would be too ashamed to face his master.

Xia ruofei smiled faintly and said,”I’m indeed planning to use a storage artifact to carry it, but your storage ring definitely can’t hold a container ...”

“This ...” Luo Qingfeng could not help but freeze.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Don’t worry. Since I’ve proposed this plan, I’ve naturally prepared a storage treasure. You just need to accompany me!”

The secret of the spirit map space could not be revealed to Li Yifu. Even if it was Luo Qingfeng and the other soul slaves, Xia ruofei did not want to let them know unless he had used the spirit map space to subdue Liu chengfeng. However, it didn’t matter if they knew that he only had a storage treasure.

Everyone, including Li Yifu, knew that Xia ruofei was the personal disciple of immortal mountain river. Wasn’t it normal for such a senior expert to leave behind a large – Capacity storage magical treasure?

After listening to Xia ruofei’s words, the pressure on Luo Qingfeng disappeared. Li Yifu also heaved a sigh of relief. He quickly stood up and said,””Since martial granduncle has already made preparations, then this disciple can rest assured! Martial granduncle, if there are no other instructions, this disciple will take his leave first!”

Xia ruofei knew that Li Yifu must be in a hurry to contact the people Mexico, so he nodded with a smile and said,””You go! I’ll be away for a few days, so I’ll have to trouble you with all the affairs on the Peach Blossom Island. Oh, and also, please take good care of Weiwei and Qingxue. ”

“Please rest assured, martial granduncle!” Li Yifu said quickly. Then, he bowed slightly to Xia ruofei and left the room.

The shock in Luo Qingfeng’s heart did not dissipate. He lowered his head and said to Xia ruofei,””Master, you’re the most talented cultivator I’ve ever seen! To be able to convert true Qi into Yuan Qi and construct a Yuan Qi Whirlpool in just over twenty days is simply unheard of!”

Xia ruofei laughed.”Stop flattering me. I really do have some things I want to know from you!”

“Please speak, master!” Luo Qingfeng said quickly.

“Actually, it’s also about the construction of the yuan Qi vortex.” Xia ruofei said,”I heard from Zheng Yongshou that you went into closed – door cultivation for more than a year before you completed the breakthrough process?”

“Master,” Luo Qingfeng said with a look of shame.”I’m not talented enough. I can’t compare to a genius like you ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”That’s not what I wanted to ask. I mean ... Can the construction of the vital Qi vortex be done step by step? can it be completed slowly through grinding?”

“Don’t you know, master?” Luo Qingfeng looked surprised and said,”as far as I know, most cultivators use this method to break through to the early stage of the Golden core realm. Very few people can do it overnight. At least, I have never heard of it.”

Xia ruofei was very confused.”But when I was building the vital Qi vortex, I felt that my dantian was extremely empty. Once the vortex started to spin, it would absorb energy all the time. If I stop cultivating, even the weak vital Qi in my muscles, bones, and meridians would be completely absorbed. How could I stand it?” And you’ve been in closed – door cultivation for more than a year ...”

Xia ruofei found it hard to imagine such a feeling, so he was also full of confusion. Could it be that the cultivation technique practiced by Luo Qingfeng and the others was not so overbearing, and the yuan Qi vortex would not have such a strong suction force?

Luo Qingfeng smiled bitterly and said,””The process is indeed very painful. Once you stop cultivating, the incomplete Yuan Qi vortex will continue to absorb the weak yuan Qi in your body. Once the yuan Qi is completely absorbed, even the energy in your muscles and bones will continue to be absorbed. In the year that this old servant has been in seclusion, I’ve basically been skin and bones like a skeleton. This old servant has been in seclusion for about a year and a half, but in reality, it has only taken me one year and three months to break through. I spent the remaining three months recovering ... I really can’t show my face to anyone. ”

Qingfeng Luo paused for a moment and continued,””In addition, just as master said, I feel a strong sense of hunger in my dantian at all times. Even if I stop cultivating, I can’t fall asleep. When I think back to what I experienced over the past year, it was like a nightmare!”
