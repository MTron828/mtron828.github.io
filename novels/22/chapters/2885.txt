2886 Riding a flying sword (2)

Ling Qingxue’s eyes lit up,’flying on a sword? That’s so cool!”

Her eyes were filled with yearning as she said,””It’ll be great if I can experience it one day. ”

Xia ruofei laughed.”We now have the unique conditions that no other cultivation sect has. Moreover, the martial arts you’re cultivating are all of the best quality. If you can’t reach the Golden core stage even with this, then you should really be locked up in a small black room and reflect on yourself!” Also ... If you just want to experience it, I can take you flying once after I master it, as long as you’re not afraid!”

“That’s a deal!” Ling Qingxue said,”you’re not allowed to go back on your word!”

“I won’t regret it ...” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”wife, the time formation is done. Let’s go in and cultivate!”

“En!” Ling Qingxue nodded her head and said,”I will also work hard to cultivate and try to reach the Golden core stage as soon as possible!”

Xia ruofei stayed in Ling Qingxue’s room for about two hours. Most of the time was spent on “rolling around in bed” after their cultivation. This was because they were cultivating within the time array flag’s range and the time flow was more than 90 times slower than the outside world.

After leaving Ling Qingxue’s room, Xia ruofei sneaked into Song Wei’s room.

The process here was basically the same. First, they practiced the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” together in the time formation. Then, when they were in deep love, they left the formation and fell into the soft bed, hugging each other ...

Xia ruofei was like a hardworking bee, working hard in Song Wei and Ling Qingxue’s room. The morning passed quickly.

When they went to the restaurant downstairs for lunch, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue blushed at the same time when they saw each other. Their eyes met for a moment, then they quickly looked away. They knew that Xia ruofei must have been busy with both sides in the morning. When they thought about the crazy time in bed that morning, their faces blushed and their hearts beat faster.

Luo Qingfeng also appeared in the restaurant on time. When he saw Xia ruofei and the other two, he quickly walked up and bowed respectfully in front of Xia ruofei.””Mr. Xia!”

“Qingfeng, have you recovered your energy?” Xia ruofei nodded and asked.

Luo Qingfeng nodded gratefully and said,””Mr. Xia, the yuan Qi in my dantian has recovered by more than 80%. If you have any orders, you can order me to do so at any time!”

When Song Wei and Ling Qingxue heard this, they were also shocked. This was an Aurous core stage cultivator!

They were even more shocked when they saw how respectful Luo Qingfeng was to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded,”let’s eat first!” After the meal, come to my room with your adopted husband!”

“Yes, Mr. Xia!” “Yes,” Luo Qingfeng replied respectfully.

After lunch, Xia ruofei soon saw Li Yifu and Luo Qingfeng in his room. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Senior granduncle!”

“Master!”

The two of them greeted Xia ruofei with great respect.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”come and sit!”

He first looked at Li Yifu and asked,”Yifu, has the weapons and equipment been prepared in Mexico?”

Li Yifu quickly replied,”senior granduncle!” Everything is ready, but according to your instructions, the goods have not been loaded onto the ship yet. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and asked,”by the way, how much is the equipment?” I’ll transfer it to you later!”

“Senior granduncle, didn’t we have an agreement?” Li Yifu quickly said. I’ll pay for this! I can’t help much with the construction of the Peach Blossom Island. This kind of problem can be easily solved with money, so I ask martial granduncle to give this disciple a chance to show filial piety?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you’ve already put in a lot of effort by using your connections in the Hong sect to do this. How can I let you pay for it?” This is not appropriate ...”

“Suitable! It’s very suitable!” Li Yifu said,”it’s only about a few million US dollars in total, and the people in the Hong sect are my old brothers. The only difficulty in this matter is that the black market arms dealers all require cash transactions. After I transfer the money, they need to find a safe channel to exchange it for cash. But all these things have been done, so you don’t have to worry about it!” Martial granduncle, the problem now is how to transport it back to the Peach Blossom Island. Have you decided?”

Xia ruofei saw that Li Yifu had put it this way, so he didn’t stand on ceremony with Li Yifu. He nodded and said,””Alright, I’ll take this money as your contribution for the construction of the Peach Blossom Island!”

“Thank you, martial granduncle, for your help!” Li Yifu was overjoyed.”I don’t have any strong points, but I’ve indeed accumulated a lot of worldly wealth. In the future, I hope that senior granduncle will not treat me as an outsider!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”I’m an elder of your sect. It’s improper for me to keep using your money.” Besides, I have some savings ... Let’s not talk about this for now. Foster husband, I’ve decided that I’ll personally go and get this batch of firearms!”

“What?” Li Yifu was stunned for a moment.”Great uncle – Master, you ... You’re going to Mexico in person?”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”that’s right!” I’ll try to get it done in three days! I’ve just broken through to the early jiedan stage, so I’m going to practice sword riding. This trip to Mexico will be my training!”

Luo Qingfeng, who was standing at the side, could not help but gasp. He looked at Xia ruofei with wide eyes and asked in a trembling voice,””Master! You ... You ... You’ve already broken through to the early jiedan stage?”

Regarding Xia ruofei’s breakthrough last night, Zheng Yongshou and Li Yifu, who were in charge of picking Luo Qingfeng up, did not dare to tell him much without Xia ruofei’s permission. Since Luo Qingfeng saw Xia ruofei this morning, Xia ruofei had not deliberately released his aura and even restrained it a little. As a result, Luo Qingfeng had not even noticed that Xia ruofei had officially entered the early – Stage golden elixir realm.

There were two things that shocked Luo Qingfeng. The first was that Xia ruofei had completed the formation of the vital Qi vortex in such a short time. He had personally witnessed Xia ruofei break through the bottleneck of the Qi refinement realm. Xia ruofei had completed the breakthrough in the battle with Luo Qingfeng. From that battle that could affect him for the rest of his life until now, it had only been more than 20 days. Xia ruofei had actually crossed two large steps, transformed his vital Qi, and formed a vital Qi vortex.

Luo Qingfeng had spent a lot of time and effort to complete each step. He had spent more than a year to build the vital Qi vortex. In comparison, Xia ruofei’s cultivation speed was unbelievable.

What shocked Luo Qingfeng even more was that he had not noticed that Xia ruofei had broken through to the early – Stage golden elixir realm even though he had met him several times in the past half a day. Generally speaking, a cultivator with a high cultivation level could easily see the cultivation level of a cultivator with a low cultivation level. If Xia ruofei could hide his aura in front of him, didn’t it mean that Xia ruofei’s cultivation was more powerful than his? Or did Xia ruofei cultivate some special secret technique to hide his aura?

The news that Xia ruofei had broken through to the early – Stage golden elixir realm was so shocking that Luo Qingfeng could not help but be a little dazed.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I just broke through last night!” Qingfeng, I’ll have to ask you some things about the early jiedan stage later!”

Luo Qingfeng also came back to his senses and quickly said in awe,””Master, if you have any questions, please feel free to ask. This old servant will definitely answer everything I know!”

Xia ruofei nodded and looked at Li Yifu.””Foster husband, contact the people in Mexico and get the firearms ready. You’ll have to arrange in advance where I’ll go and who I’ll contact after I arrive in Mexico. When the time comes, you can send me the specific location and contact information, and leave the rest to me!”
