Jennifer pursed her lips into a smile and said,”I’m just joking with you!” Look at how scared you are ...”

Lin Qiao blushed and said,”sister Jennifer, I’m also in a dilemma ... But it doesn’t matter. I’m still young, and brother ruofei is not married. Let’s take it one step at a time!”

Jennifer’s love experience was not rich, and after marriage, Tang Yitian loved her even more, so she could not give too many substantial opinions.

The two of them chatted on WeChat for a while. When Lin Qiao and Jennifer finished the video – Chat and went downstairs, she found that Xia ruofei was no longer in the coffee shop. She panicked and quickly called Xia ruofei. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Brother ruofei, where did you go?” Lin Qiao’s voice carried a trace of uneasiness. She was worried that Xia ruofei would return to the hotel in anger because she “chased” him away.

Xia ruofei’s hearty laughter came from Lin Qiao’s phone. “Qiao’ er, you’re done talking to Jennifer?”

“Mm! I’m on the first floor, but I don’t see you!” Lin Qiao said carefully.

“Come to the door!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Lin Qiao walked to the door with her phone but didn’t see Xia ruofei.

However, before she could ask, Xia ruofei said,””Look to the left!”

Lin Qiao immediately turned her head to the left and saw Xia ruofei walking over with his hands behind his back.

She quickly hung up the phone and walked up to him.

Xia ruofei took out something from his back and waved it in front of Lin Qiao. He smiled and said,””Qiao’ er, this is for you. Do you like it?”he asked.

Lin Qiao took a closer look and saw that it was a Peppa Pig doll. She immediately smiled in surprise and held the doll tightly in her hand. She said happily,”So cute! Brother ruofei, you’re the best!”

Xia ruofei touched his nose and said,””Actually, I was bored just now, so I saw it in a small shop on the corner of the street. I thought it was quite cute, so I bought it. As long As You Like It!”

“I really like it!” Lin Qiao held the doll in her arms and looked at Xia ruofei with embarrassment.”I thought you were angry and didn’t want to talk to me, so you went back to the hotel by yourself!”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment and then laughed. He reached out and patted Lin Qiao’s head, saying,”Silly girl, why would I be angry with you? Do I look like such a petty person?”

“Don’t look like it! Brother ruofei is being magnanimous!” Lin Qiao quickly said.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”that’s more like it!” Let’s go! Let’s go back to the hotel and rest for a while before we can have dinner!”

“En!” Lin Qiao nodded heavily.

She held the Peppa Pig doll tightly in one hand and held Xia ruofei’s arm with the other. She said happily,””Let’s go back to the hotel!”

Xia ruofei also knew Lin Qiao’s character. He smiled and let her hold his arm. The two of them walked side by side in the direction of the seaside hotel.

As evening approached, many tourists had already taken the ferry back to Heron Island City. Only a few tourists who stayed in Gulangyu were still wandering around, and the side street was much quieter.

The winter sun shone on their bodies, and their shadows grew longer and longer on the quiet Stone Street. This scene was very warm and harmonious ...

After returning to the hotel, Xia ruofei realized that Zhao Yongjun and the others had already returned, while others were still wandering outside.

They created a new WeChat group, and Zhao Yongjun also called everyone to return to the hotel for dinner at Sixo’ clock sharp.

Xiao Zhang had already returned to the hotel after sending he he and the other two off.

He did not go back to his room to rest. Instead, he waited in the hotel lobby. His most important task for the past two days was to ensure that Xia ruofei and the others received them well. He basically provided them with 24 – hour service.

When Xiao Zhang saw Xia ruofei, he immediately stood up and greeted him. He passed the car keys to Xia ruofei and said,””Brother Xia, I’ve brought the things over. They’re stored in the hotel’s refrigerator!”

“Alright, thank you for your hard work!” Xia ruofei said with a smile and kept the key.

Xiao Zhang was polite and did not bother Xia ruofei too much. He warmly invited Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao back to their rooms to rest.

He also knew that Xia ruofei and Xia Xiaofei must have been shopping for the whole afternoon and must be very tired.

A receptionist had to know how to observe people’s expressions. Basically, the people who were qualified for this position were all good at receiving people and things.

Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao went back to their rooms. They were going to take a shower and rest for a while before dinner.

It was relatively easy for men to take a bath. Xia ruofei quickly finished and changed into a clean set of clothes. He sat in front of the French Bay window in the hotel room and looked at the nearby beach, admiring the sea under the sunset.

However, he didn’t stay quiet for long. After a while, he heard the doorbell ring.

Xia ruofei pulled on his hotel slippers and went to open the door. He saw Lin Qiao standing at the door with her hair still wet. She was drying her hair with a towel.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you’ve been walking all afternoon and you’re not tired?” Why don’t you rest in your room?”

“I can rest here too!” Lin Qiao said with a smile.

In fact, she didn’t want to spend such precious time alone in the hotel room because she had to go back to school early the next morning. She had three or four classes in the morning. He was a well – known professor who was very strict with his attendance. Lin Qiao was a good student. It wasn’t strange for her to skip an elective class occasionally. However, she didn’t want to miss the rare opportunity of a full professor teaching a freshman.
