Chapter 1405: Chapter 833 – a little off topic (1)

Translator: 549690339

The restaurant that Xia ruofei had booked was the Ling’s restaurant. He had even called Ling Xiaotian in advance and asked the Ling’s private kitchen to specially prepare the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ recipe and send it to the Ling’s restaurant. There would be a large portion for each table.

At noon, a total of eight tables were set up, and the other five were still on standby. Because the employees of Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory worked in shifts, it was impossible for everyone to be present at the same time. The workers on duty at noon had to wait for the next shift to take over before they could leave.

However, Xia ruofei did not forget about them. He left five tables for them. The workers would get off work in the evening, so he asked Xue Jinshan to arrange a bus to pick them up from the factory in the evening. At the same time, he asked Xue Jinshan and several factory leaders to have dinner with these hard – working workers.

No matter if it was the eight tables in the afternoon or the five tables in the evening, the Ling Ji private kitchen ‘s’ Buddha Jumps Over the Wall ‘was standard.

Xia ruofei had a lot of face. Otherwise, he would not have been able to order so many servings even if he had ordered them a month in advance.

After the celebration dinner with the pharmaceutical factory staff, Xia ruofei and the others went back in their respective cars.

Feng Jing was still in Xia ruofei’s car. Xia ruofei was driving while Feng Jing sat in the front passenger seat, scrolling through her phone.

Suddenly, Feng Rao burst out laughing. Xia ruofei turned to look at her in confusion and asked,””What’s the situation?”

Feng Rao also looked up at Xia ruofei and was overjoyed. This made Xia ruofei even more confused.

“What’s wrong?” Xia ruofei asked,”is there such a Coke?”

At that moment, the traffic light turned red. When the car stopped, Feng Jing passed her phone to Xia ruofei and smiled.””See for yourself!”

Xia ruofei took the phone and looked at it. He didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

In the afternoon, some online media outlets with a higher time limit had already published the news of the heart – nourishing soup.

The article that Feng Jing showed Xia ruofei was one of them.

However, the main point of this report made Xia ruofei speechless.

The title of the news was “a retired soldier’s feelings for his country.”

Seeing such a big topic, Xia ruofei felt that something was not right. He quickly read the content. As expected, the beginning of the report was quite normal. It wrote some of the important things in the draft, as well as the news of Jiang Liangyu and he kun’s attendance at the press conference. However, it was completely off – topic immediately after.

The reporter began to describe how the outstanding veteran, Xia ruofei, had started the Paradise Corporation from scratch and had repeatedly used high – Quality products to cause a sensation in the market. Among them were the explosive sales of paradise vegetables, Paradise Fruits, Paradise Tea leaves, and Jade skin cream.

Then, he even quoted Jiang Liangyu’s original words and praised Xia ruofei. Even Xia ruofei himself felt embarrassed when he saw it.

Xia ruofei’s photo was attached to the article.

Xia ruofei did not attend many public events. These photos were taken at the press conference today. Because of the angle, most of the photos were taken from the side.

However, the photographer’s standards were not bad. In the few photos, Xia ruofei’s side profile was well – defined, and his posture was straight, which vividly displayed his temperament.

Feng Jing saw Xia ruofei’s expression and couldn’t help but laugh.””RUO Fei, Continue reading the comments. The comments are better than the news ...”

Xia ruofei looked at Feng Jing hesitantly and then opened the comments.

“Waa! He’s so handsome!”

“One look and I can tell that he used to be a soldier. He’s sitting straight on the sofa!”

“You look so righteous! It’s the type I like!”

“After watching the first half of the news, I was still worried that he would bring down paradise corporation’s attractiveness index. But after seeing the photo, I’m completely relieved ...”

“The one above is also’ static electricity ‘! Hahaha! I think President Xia and our beautiful President are the perfect couple!”

“Get together! To be together ...”

Fine! After the news went off topic, the comments were completely off topic. There were countless posts discussing the heart – nourishing soup.

Xia ruofei’s expression was a little strange. He felt that Feng Jing had not seen the last few comments.

Just then, the traffic light turned green. Xia ruofei started the car and passed his phone to Feng Jing. He asked with a smirk,””Sister che, are you talking about these comments?”

“Yeah!” Feng Jing didn’t notice Xia ruofei’s mischievous expression. She took the phone and smiled as she looked at it. “You’ve got quite a few fans now ... Huh? I ...”

At this moment, Xia ruofei finally couldn’t help but laugh. He quickly turned to look at Feng Jing and saw that her face was red. She had already turned off her phone.

Seeing Xia ruofei look over, Feng Rao said unhappily,””What are you looking at?” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Hey! What does the static noise in your house have to do with me?” Xia ruofei said innocently.

“Isn’t it all your fault?” Feng Jing pouted and said,”I’m telling you, I’ll remember this for life! What ‘beautiful President’... It’s so unpleasant to hear!”

Following that, Feng Jing couldn’t help but burst into laughter. To be honest, when she saw the fans cheering that they were a perfect couple, and many of them even called for them to “be together”, her heart had been beating violently.

Her reaction after that was actually to hide the nervousness and shyness in her heart.
