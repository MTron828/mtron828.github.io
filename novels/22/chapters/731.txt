Chapter 732: Loyal and righteous (1)

Liang Weimin said jokingly,””Ruofei, I’ll sell it at this price. If you think that the price is too low for your status, then go next door and buy their high – priced house!”

“Uncle Liang, that’s not what I meant,” Xia ruofei said with a bitter smile. I know the price of your building, and 20000 is too low. Since it’s a commodity transaction, we’ll follow the market price!”

“The market price?” asked Liang Weimin. Then the company should still have the power to set the price, right? I’m the company’s chairman, I can still make decisions for such small matters, right?”

“But ...”

“No buts, ruofei.” Liang Weimin said,”first of all, I’m only giving you the best discount within my authority. I didn’t give you a random price, right? Besides, you’re not a government official, so even if the unit price is 10000 or 5000, or even giving it to you for free, it’s not considered bribery, right?”

The sales manager was stunned. It was the first time he had encountered such a situation. The seller was trying to make it cheaper, but the buyer was trying to increase the price.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile bitterly. This Liang Weimin was so unreasonable that he couldn’t win in an argument!

However, Xia ruofei really liked this house. He couldn’t just give it up just because it was cheap, right?

Xia ruofei thought for a while and finally made a decision.

He wanted it!

He would just treat it as him owing Liang Weimin a favor! At most, he would help Liang Qichao more in the future. The relationship between the two families was so close that he would have a chance to return the favor.

After making up his mind, Xia ruofei nodded and said,”Alright! Uncle Liang, we’ll do as you say! I’m taking this suite!”

Liang Weimin immediately grinned and patted Xia ruofei’s shoulder.””That’s the way! Ruofei, you’re not allowed to be such an outsider with your uncle Liang in the future! Otherwise, I’ll really get angry!”

......

Liang Weimin knew that Xia ruofei was not short of money and would not accept his gift. Otherwise, he would have given this house to Xia ruofei without hesitation.

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile.

The group left the No. 1 building and took the electric car back to the sales office.

After returning to the sales office, Xia ruofei asked,””Oh right, uncle Liang, I bought this house for someone else. I’ve brought her identification card. It’s fine if she doesn’t show up, right?”

Liang Weimin was stunned for a moment. After some thought, he said,”In principle, there’s no problem. However, the owner has to be present to sign the property certificate. If you want to apply for a loan, you also need to sign in person to apply for a loan.”

Xia ruofei replied without hesitation,”full payment!” I’ll pay the full amount for the room today!”

Liang Weimin chuckled and said,”there’s no need to be so anxious. According to the rules, you can just pay a deposit today. With our relationship, it doesn’t matter whether you pay or not!”

Xia ruofei said firmly,”yes!” He had to pay! I’ll have to pay for the house sooner or later anyway, so I’ll just pay for it today to save myself the trouble in the future. ”

The reason why Xia ruofei was so determined to pay the money was very simple. He was worried that Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao would not accept his gift.

After paying all the money, he could tell them that he had paid for the house and that the real estate developer wouldn’t let him check out. By then, he would have to take it.

Liang Weimin didn’t understand, but he knew that Xia ruofei wasn’t short of money. Since Xia ruofei insisted on paying today, he naturally wouldn’t object.

So, Liang Weimin called the sales manager over and explained the situation to him. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The sales manager immediately said respectfully,””Mr. Xia, please give me the identity card of the buyer. I’ll go and handle the relevant procedures.”

“I’ll have to trouble you!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Then, he took out Lin Qiao’s ID card and handed it to the manager.

After manager song took the ID card, he immediately went to prepare a copy of the ID card and some other procedures to purchase the house.

Liang Weimin was sitting opposite Xia ruofei. He caught a glimpse of the young and beautiful girl on Xia ruofei’s identity card and instantly smiled knowingly.

“Uncle Liang, it’s not what you think,” Xia ruofei explained with a bitter smile.”Qiao’ er is the sister of one of my comrades who sacrificed herself ...”

Xia ruofei didn’t want Liang Weimin to misunderstand, so he explained his relationship with Lin Qiao’s family. Of course, he skipped the part about the military secrets.

After Liang Weimin heard this, he couldn’t help but show a look of admiration.

He said,”ruofei, you’re really loyal!” If your comrade’s spirit is in heaven, he’ll be very pleased. ”

Xia ruofei sighed.”It’s enough as long as Auntie and Qiao’ er can live a healthy and happy life. I don’t think too much about other things.”

“Oh yes, uncle Liang, I’ll leave the renovation of this house to you!” Xia ruofei continued.

Liang Weimin laughed heartily and said,”that’s for sure!” I’ll personally keep an eye on them and get them to come up with a few designs for you to choose from!”

“Thanks!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

The company’s president was here in person, and the sales department was very efficient.

Very quickly, they had prepared the relevant procedures. After Xia ruofei signed the papers, he swiped his card and paid for the house. The total amount was more than 2.4 million Yuan.

Then, he took the house purchase receipt from jianda group and bade Liang Weimin farewell. He left the Grand View Real Estate and drove back to the farm.
