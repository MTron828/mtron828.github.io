After explaining, Chen Xuan continued,””Brother RUO Fei, I’ve already severely reprimanded Shen Hu, that muddleheaded bastard! Please be magnanimous and not be so calculative with him. We will definitely punish the water Yuan sect again! In addition, I’ve already asked Shen Hu to return to the country as soon as possible to ask for your forgiveness …”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”brother Chen, there’s no need for that!” There was really no need for that! I’ve already lightly punished that attendant Liu of the water Yuan sect, so this matter can be considered over!”

“That won’t do!” Chen Xuan replied,”how can the dignity of a golden core cultivator be offended! Brother RUO Fei, if Shen Hu doesn’t apologize to you, he won’t be able to eat or sleep in peace! In fact, with the water Yuan sect’s behavior, even if you annihilate them, they wouldn’t have anything to say. If you can let them go, that’s already very kind of you!”

At this point, Chen Xuan couldn’t help but add,””Brother RUO Fei, it may not have been long since you broke through to the Golden core stage. In today’s cultivation world, the status of golden core cultivators is very noble. If anyone can offend them, what dignity would there be? This time, it was Shen Hu and the water Yuan sect. Next time, it might be some other sect that jumped out!”

Chen Xuan’s words could be considered sincere. After all, the water element sect was a subsidiary sect of the first heaven society.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”It’s not that serious. No one would be stupid enough to provoke a golden core cultivator for no reason.”

In reality, even though Xia ruofei had only broken through not too long ago, he was already a cultivator in the intermediate stage of the Golden elixir realm. However, because his spiritual power had reached the spiritualization realm, he had concealed his cultivation aura very well. Even Chen Nanfeng did not notice that he had broken through another level in the trial Pagoda.

It could be said that Xia ruofei already had the highest combat power in the entire cultivation world. If anyone dared to provoke him for no reason, he would not mind teaching them a painful lesson.

“Brother ruofei,” Chen Xuan said,”that may be true but you really can’t weaken the aura of a golden core cultivator. Otherwise, others will think that you’re weak and easy to bully.”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””Brother Chen, since Shen Hu is already preparing to return, let him come back! However, there’s one thing that you need to tell him in advance!”

“Brother RUO Fei, please speak!”

“My friend, Lu You. He doesn’t know that I’m a cultivator,” Xia ruofei said,”I didn’t show my face when I was teaching the disciples of the water Yuan sect a lesson, including when I was giving her spiritual crystals and cultivation techniques. I hope that Shen Hu won’t let this slip.”

“No problem!” “I’ll just let him know!” Chen Xuan replied hurriedly.

Since Xia ruofei did not want his friends to know his true identity, Chen Xuan would naturally remind Shen Hu to keep it a secret. This was a small matter. As long as Xia ruofei accepted Shen Hu’s apology, there should be No more grudges left.

“Alright, then I’ll have to trouble brother Chen.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ll be in the capital for the next two days. 1’11 be staying at the courtyard house in liuhai Lane. You know the place. If Shen Hu wants to look for me, he can go there!”

“No problem!” Chen Xuan said,”thank you, brother ruofei! On behalf of the water Yuan sect, I would like to thank brother ruofei for his magnanimity!”

“Brother Chen, you’re being too serious …”

After Xia ruofei hung up, Song Wei asked curiously,””RUO Fei, Chen Xuan knows about the club?”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””He’s asking about the water Yuan sect. Didn’t he go to the Paradise Club? When the people of the water Yuan sect said that they had sent people to the capital because they found a place for cultivation, they immediately thought of our club, so … They quickly called to apologize!”

“What kind of apology did he make?” Song Wei was confused.

“The water element sect is a subservient sect of the first heaven society. In fact, the sect master of the water element sect is also his subordinate.” Xia ruofei laughed.”! guess he doesn’t want me to have any ill – feelings towards the first heaven society!”

“Hehe! The big sects in the cultivation world are trying to be on good terms with you! It’s not worth it to offend you for no reason because of this!” Song Wei smiled.”Chen Xuan is smart. He can tell which is more important!”

“Actually, I didn’t take it to heart. Even if I were to blame the water Yuan sect, I wouldn’t blame the heavenly sect!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”let’s not talk about this. Let’s go back to siheyuan first!”

“En!” Song Wei nodded.

Xia ruofei pulled Song Wei and jumped onto the flying sword. Then, he started to use the sword technique.

The blue travel immortal sword turned into a stream of light and flew in the direction of the courtyard in liuhai Lane.

The next morning, Xia ruofei gave Zhao Yongjun a call.

“Ruofei, where did you go last night? Why did you get someone to drive the car back to the club?” Zhao Yongjun asked with a smile.

“My friend has something to discuss with me.” Xia ruofei asked,”brother Zhao, is the car still in the club?”

“I was just about to get someone to help you drive it to the siheyuan!” Zhao Yongjun said.

“Then don’t open it.” Xia ruofei quickly said,”I called you because of this! 1 still have to go to the club today, so I’ll leave the car at the club! It’ll be more convenient for me to use the car later!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Alright!” Zhao Yongjun said readily,”are you coming over in the morning? Then I’ll send a car over to pick you up!”

“There’s no need to go through so much trouble!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”there’s a Land Rover in the siheyuan! I’ll get Wu Qiang to drive me over in the morning. Also, don’t make any other arrangements. I should stay for a while and not necessarily have lunch at the club..”
