The black Phoenix flying ship had already returned to the atmosphere, so Chen Nanfeng naturally did not need to transmit his voice. He could just speak directly. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha also nodded in agreement.

They were also very curious about the black Phoenix flying ship’s condition after the previous flight that had exceeded the limits of the blue water flying ship.

They had just seen the terrible state of the Clearwater flying boat. Just the damage to its exterior was enough to make Chen Nanfeng’s heart ache.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Of course, no problem!”

After that, he operated on the console, and the flying boat soon stopped descending and hovered in the clouds.

Chen Nanfeng, Mu Sheng, and Liu Mansha all summoned their flying swords and left the flying boat.

The black Phoenix flying ship belonged to Xia ruofei, so he could use his spiritual power to sense the Flying Ship’s condition. Naturally, he did not need to disembark to check.

Chen Xuan, on the other hand, had yet to fully recover. His face was still a little pale, a clear sign that he had overused his energy. Therefore, he did not leave the swift Boat. Instead, he chose to recover his energy in the cabin.

Chen Nanfeng and the other two looked around and quickly returned to the cabin.

The three of them had strange expressions on their faces.

Chen Nanfeng could not hide his shock and asked,””Fellow Daoist Xia, are you really unscathed?”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded,”indeed!” However, the flight time this time was relatively short, so the reference value was not great. We’ll need more in – depth tests to test if the Flying Ship is suitable for long – term space travel. ”

“This has already exceeded our expectations!” Liu Mansha’s beautiful eyes were filled with unconcealed joy.”We thought that the plan to cross space to the moon by flying boat would be impossible to carry out. I didn’t expect fellow Daoist Xia to give us such a big surprise!”

Chen Nanfeng smiled bitterly and said,”I’ll throw the goods away if I compare them!” Compared to this Black Phoenix flying ship, our first heaven society’s Blue water flying ship is nothing!”

“Sect leader Chen, you’re exaggerating,” Xia ruofei said with a smile. It could only be said that each had their own strengths! I remember master telling me that this Black Phoenix flying ship is made of special materials, so its defensive capabilities are stronger than most flying ships. However, the other covers may not have such an advantage. ”

At this moment, Chen Xuan, who had already recovered a little, spoke up,””Brother Xia, your master is too humble ... I can see that our Clearwater flying boat is completely behind the black Phoenix flying boat! It’s not just in terms of defense, but in terms of speed as well! We’re much slower than the ship!”

“Three seniors, brother Chen, if there’s nothing else, shall we return to the surface?” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Alright!”

“Sure, let’s go back!”

Xia ruofei steered the black Phoenix flying boat and hovered steadily above the courtyard house in liuhai Lane.

The five of them jumped down from the flying boat and Xia ruofei kept the black Phoenix flying boat.

Chen Nanfeng and the others were led to the living room of the master suite, and everyone took their seats.

Xia ruofei was making tea for everyone as he said,””Seniors, our top priority now is to prepare the protective equipment in space as soon as possible. I’ve already sent someone to the United States to get in touch with the spacesuits and related equipment. If everything goes well, we shouldn’t have to wait too long before we can conduct more in – depth tests. I think the day we set off for the moon is not too far away!”

“That’s great!” Mu Sheng said,”little brother Xia, it’s all thanks to you this time! From the moment the token was cracked, you were the one who put in the most effort! If it wasn’t for little brother Xia, I’m afraid we wouldn’t have been able to study it before it disappeared, not even a bit of useful information. ”

“Senior mu, you flatter me.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”we’re all working together! I’m not doing any voluntary work. ”

“That being said, little brother Xia’s contribution is the greatest!” Mu Sheng said,”brother Chen, Valley master Liu, I have a suggestion ... At least we can’t let little brother Xia give for free! For example, the journey to the moon, which was hundreds of thousands of miles long, little brother Xia had allowed everyone to ride this flying boat for free, but the crystals spent on the journey, everyone should at least contribute that amount, right? And that spacesuit, I heard it’s extremely expensive. Although money in the world is nothing, there’s no reason for little brother Xia to pay for it alone! I think everyone should take the initiative to bear this responsibility. ”

“I agree!” Chen Nanfeng nodded. Besides, the first heaven society is willing to offer 20% more. After all, we have a lot of spots!”

“My soaring Flower Valley also has no objections!” Liu Mansha said with a smile.

Xia ruofei forced a smile and said,”what are you seniors doing?” Although I can’t be considered rich, I can still afford a few origin crystals! We’re all working together to explore the mysterious realm, so there’s no need to be so calculative, right?”

“That’s a different matter! In short, I can’t let you put in the effort and suffer losses!” Mu Sheng said,”it’s settled then. Before we officially set off, we’ll gather the crystals and give them to you. Also, we’ll pay for all the spacesuits you need! Little brother Xia, it is reasonable to say that we have to pay you some more remuneration, but I don’t think you will accept it. However, it is better for us to pool the resources together!”

Xia ruofei said helplessly,”if that’s the case, then we’ll do as the seniors say!” The reason I called all of you here today was to tell you that we still have to wait for at least two to three days for the spacesuits! If there was nothing to do these few days, everyone could visit various scenic spots in Beijing to relax. If there’s anything you need to arrange, you can tell me and I’ll get someone to arrange it. If the negotiations in the United States go well ... Actually, no matter if the negotiations go well or not, I should be going to the U.S. In a few days. We should be able to get there quickly on the black Phoenix flying ship!”
