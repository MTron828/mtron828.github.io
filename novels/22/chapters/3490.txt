Chapter 3491: Adjusting the array (1)

Translator: 549690339

“Yes! Master!” Luo Qingfeng said quickly.

The speed of the black Phoenix flying ship was extremely fast. After entering the range of the Taixu xuanqing formation, they arrived on the rooftop of the building in the blink of an eye.

Qingfeng Luo was not slow at all. He had only informed Yifu li through voice transmission, and then he had flown out of the window on his sword, heading straight for the rooftop, so he had arrived almost at the same time as the black Phoenix flying ship.

Song Wei was still cultivating, so Xia ruofei let Ling Qingxue stay by her side while he walked to the deck of the black Phoenix flying ship.

“Master!” “Master!” Luo Qingfeng quickly bowed and greeted Xia ruofei respectfully.

Xia ruofei allowed the black Phoenix flying ship to remain suspended in the air while he jumped off the Flying Ship and arrived at the rooftop.

“Qingfeng, you’re also on peach source Island!” Xia ruofei said with a kind expression.

“Master, you’ve gone far away. I’m worried that there’s no one here to guard the peach source Island, so I returned to the island after I’ve made arrangements for the sect.” “Of course,” Luo Qingfeng said respectfully.”The cultivation environment here is much better than in the star Seizer sect. If not for the sect’s Affairs, I would like to cultivate here all year round!”

Xia ruofei laughed and patted Luo Qingfeng’s shoulder, saying,””The sect’s Affairs can be slowly handed over to the people below, especially some high – Level Qi refining disciples, they can be heavily trained! As long as the star Seizer sect has one more golden core cultivator, you’ll have a much easier time!”

“Yes! “I’m too slow – witted, and the disciples of the sect can’t be trained. I’m really ashamed …” Luo Qingfeng said.

“Don’t worry. Now that the sect’s great array has been improved, I’ll go and adjust it when I have the opportunity. In addition, I’ll give you a batch of cultivation resources. It’s not a problem for you to focus on cultivating a few trustworthy disciples!” Xia ruofei said casually.

He had obtained a large amount of inheritance in the ninth level of the trial Pagoda. During the long journey back to Earth, he had basically sorted out all the new knowledge in his mind. He had directly grasped the inheritance information, and after sorting it out, he had already integrated it. This included a lot of knowledge about array Dao, so his array Dao level had also improved greatly. Now that he was asked to improve the array technique, his vision was naturally different.

In terms of cultivation resources, Xia ruofei had a deep foundation now. Even if he did not count the precious purple origin crystals, his personal wealth was not any weaker than a top – notch sect like the first heaven sect. It would not be a problem for him to take out a small portion of it to support the star Seizer sect. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Of course, Xia ruofei did not need to manage the entire sect like Chen Nanfeng. Even if he were to take out cultivation resources, he would not be able to benefit all the disciples of the star Seizer sect. However, it was not a problem for Luo Qingfeng to pick a few people and focus on training them.

Luo Qingfeng was overjoyed when he heard this. He quickly bowed and said,””Many thanks, master! This subordinate is willing to die for master!”

At this time, Li Yifu appeared on the rooftop, panting heavily.

He did not know how to ride a flying sword, so he had run straight up after receiving Qingfeng Luo’s message. He did not even wait for the elevator. Fortunately, the floor he was on was quite high, and he had only climbed a few floors up.

When Li Yifu heard that Xia ruofei had returned to Paradise Island, he ran at full speed without holding back. Even a Qi refining cultivator was panting from all the running.

“Greetings, martial granduncle!” Li Yifu called out with a face full of joy.

Xia ruofei looked at Li Yifu, who was over 80 years old, and was out of breath. He was really afraid that he would die from running out of breath, so he quickly said,””Foster husband, isn’t there an elevator? Why did you run like this?”

Li Yifu quickly caught his breath and said with a smile,””When this disciple heard that martial granduncle had returned, I didn’t think too much and directly ran up here! Martial granduncle, did your trip go smoothly?”

Xia ruofei nodded.’Tt’s all thanks to you for helping me adjust the spacesuits and the spacecraft. This trip was finally safe and smooth!”

Li Yifu said, somewhat embarrassed,””Martial granduncle, you personally coordinated the spacesuits and spacesuits, so this disciple doesn’t dare to claim credit for it! It’s good that senior granduncle has returned safely. This disciple has been worried about senior granduncle’s safety for the past few days and has been unable to sleep and eat in peace! It’s a pity that I’m slow – witted and can’t share the burden of martial granduncle!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”You’ve already helped me a lot. If it wasn’t for you, I wouldn’t have been able to leave this Paradise Island for so long.”

“Adopted husband, is everything alright on peach source Island?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Everything is normal!” Li Yifu quickly said,”sect master Luo has also been keeping watch here. He patrolled the nearby Sea area every day, but he didn’t find any traces of other cultivators ‘activities. This place should not have been discovered by anyone!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”that’s good!” You’ve all worked hard!”

At this moment, Song Wei had also finished her cultivation and appeared on the deck of the black Phoenix flying ship with Ling Qingxue.

Hence, Xia ruofei smiled and waved at the two of them.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue jumped off the flying boat together. Luo Qingfeng and Li Yifu quickly came forward and greeted them respectfully.

Xia ruofei kept the black Phoenix flying ship and said,””Let’s go! Let’s go down and talk!”

A group of people escorted Xia ruofei down the rooftop and arrived at the top floor suite that had been reserved for Xia ruofei.

Luo Qingfeng busied himself with making tea for everyone. Although he was a golden core cultivator, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue were both Xia ruofei’s cultivation partners. Li Yifu was also a junior of Xia ruofei’s sect. In terms of status, they were all much higher than him. Thus, he did not dare to put on the airs of a golden core cultivator and put himself in a very proper position..
