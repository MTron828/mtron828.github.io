Chapter 1358: You are always too soft – hearted (2)

Translator: 549690339

Of course, the biggest possibility was still surprise.

This kind of opportunity was not something that could be encountered and grasped easily.

After Liu Zhe left, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Brother Zhao, I’ll arrange for you to stay at the hostel on the farm tonight. Don’t mind the simplicity!”

“What do you mean!” Zhao Yongjun said,”it’s my brother’s farm. Who would dare to despise it?”

“That’s right! I think this is the best arrangement!” Xu Zixuan also smiled and said,”where can’t I stay in a hotel? Since we’re already at Mt. Three, it’s more interesting to live on the farm!”

Xia ruofei looked at song Rui with a smile and asked,””What are your arrangements? Are you coming with us or going back to your own home?”

When song Rui came to San Shan to work at the song family’s company, his family bought him a high – end apartment in San Shan.

Song Rui said without hesitation,”we’re definitely going to Taoyuan farm!” RUO Fei, I came here with big brother Zhao and the others, and I’m also a guest. You can’t just leave me alone, right?”

“If you want to go, then go. Why are you talking so much nonsense?” Xia ruofei said mercilessly,”aren’t you just worried that we’ll be eating all the good food?” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Seeing that his thoughts had been exposed by Xia ruofei, song Rui did not feel embarrassed. He just chuckled and said,””In any case, I’m sticking to you ...”

Xia ruofei pretended to be afraid. He looked around and said, “Don’t you harm me, kid! I’m straight! Besides, my wife is right here!”

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue immediately covered their mouths and laughed.

“Nonsense! I’m straight too!” Song Rui said,”I think you’re the one who’s trying to harm me! Song Wei, don’t listen to this guy’s nonsense. If it gets to Yiyi’s side, I won’t be able to clear my name even if I jump into the Yellow River!”

Song Wei held back her laughter and said in a serious tone,”As a responsible friend, I’ll tell her everything I saw and heard. It’s up to her to make her own judgment ...”

“Don’t mind me!” Song Rui quickly said,”I’m considered your uncle, right? Isn’t what you’re doing considered treasonous?”

It was fine if song Rui didn’t mention it, but once he did, Song Wei smiled even more mischievously and said,””Oh, right! We’re still a generation apart!”

“You just found out?” Song Rui said proudly.

Unexpectedly, Song Wei’s tone changed and she said leisurely,”So ... You’re Yiyi’s uncle too? Yiyi and I are the best sisters! Uncle song Rui, do you think ... If you get together with Yiyi, it’ll be considered ... That?”

Song Wei was a girl after all. She was shy and couldn’t say those two words. She could only blushed and give a vague reply.

However, the meaning was already very clear. Song Rui’s hair stood on end when he heard that. He quickly said,””It’s my fault, it’s my fault ... Don’t call me Uncle song Rui, I’ll call you great aunt, okay? Lady song, please don’t do anything bad! This is related to my lifelong happiness!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but find it funny when he saw song Rui’s surprised look.

Of course, he knew that song Rui was acting as well. Otherwise, he would not have such an exaggerated expression. However, Xia ruofei still came out to help him.”Alright, alright! Song Wei was just joking with you! During this period of time, Song Wei has been speaking up for you on Zhuo Yiyi’s side. If you two are together, the first person you should thank is her!”

Only then did song Rui put away his cheeky smile and said seriously,””That’s for sure! No matter what, we still have to thank Song Wei!”

“I didn’t do anything ...” Song Wei waved her hand and smiled.

Song Rui and Song Wei’s joke attracted everyone’s attention.

“By the way, sister – in – Law, are you coming back to the farm too?” Zhao Yongjun asked with a smile.

Ling Qingxue’s face turned red and she quickly said,””I ... I’m not married to ruofei yet. We don’t live together ...”

Zhao Yongjun laughed and said,”brother Xia is still so conservative?” Everyone’s here today, let’s go and have some fun!”

“I still have something to do at home. My dad is still waiting for me to go back!” Ling Qingxue hesitated for a moment before saying,”big brother Zhao, you guys have fun at the farm. I won’t be going ...”

Xia ruofei actually hoped that Ling Qingxue would go back with him. However, he knew that Ling Qingxue was shy. There were so many people present today, so she definitely would not go.

Therefore, although he was a little disappointed, he quickly said,””Qingxue, you should go back early too! By the way, remember to tell uncle Ling about opening a Ling’s private kitchen branch in Beijing and see what he thinks!”

Zhao Yongjun immediately said,”yes, yes, yes. Sister – in – Law, just tell uncle. As long as you’re willing to open a branch in Beijing, we can help you with all kinds of problems. You just have to focus on opening a branch and making the best food!”

“Okay, I’ll tell my dad when I get home,” Ling Qingxue nodded.

“Oh right, you also drank a bit just now, so don’t drive!” Xia ruofei said,”or ask the company’s driver to send you.”

“I brought my chauffeur here, why don’t you come with me?” Song Wei quickly said. I’ll send her home first ...”

“There’s no need to go through so much trouble ...” Ling Qingxue hurriedly said.

“It’s no trouble, no trouble!” Song Wei smiled and said,”it’s just something along the way. This way, RUO Fei can be more at ease!”

Then, Song Wei looked at Xia ruofei.

“That’s good,”Xia ruofei said immediately,” send me a WeChat message when you get home, so I won’t worry ...”

After he said those words, he immediately felt that it was a little inappropriate. If he said it to Ling Qingxue alone, there would definitely be no problem. However, with Song Wei added in, it felt a little ambiguous.

However, in this specific context, he couldn’t possibly say Ling Qingxue directly and not Song Wei. That would give people a feeling of awkwardness.

Therefore, it was almost a slip of the tongue.

Ling Qingxue didn’t feel anything out of the ordinary. She smiled sweetly and said,””Alright!”

Song Wei’s face heated up. She glanced at Xia ruofei and nodded.

Zhao Yongjun and the others were all experienced. After seeing this scene, they couldn’t help but reveal a meaningful look in their eyes.

After sending song Wei and Ling Qingxue to the car, Xia ruofei and the rest took the car to Taoyuan farm.

Song Rui had brought two MPVs along with Xia ruofei’s Knight XV SUV. There was definitely more than enough space for six to seven people.

However, everyone had drunk, so song Rui had hired three drivers. When they returned, they would leave one van at the farm as a backup, and the three drivers could take the other van back to the city.

If he didn’t make the necessary arrangements, it would be impossible for him to get a taxi back to the city at a place like Taoyuan farm in the middle of the night.

Everyone drank to their heart’s content that night, so they had a lot of conversation along the way.

Zhao Yongjun and Xia ruofei were in the same car. It was Xia ruofei’s Knight XV.

The street lights outside the car window flashed quickly. Zhao Yongjun leaned back in his seat and suddenly smiled.””Ruofei, you’re still too low – Key ...”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, then he smiled and asked,””Big brother Zhao, why would you suddenly say that?”

Zhao Yongjun laughed and said,”you see, it’s only been a few days. Before, you were a small fry in Tongren Hall. Today, it’s Tian Xiaojun, an insignificant figure. All of them dare to challenge you. If you were a little more high – Profile, would there be so many bad guys appearing?”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and said,”I don’t like to show my face in public ... But didn’t I ask Tian Xiaojun to go back and do some publicity tonight?” This kind of trouble should be less in the future. ”

Zhao Yongjun shook his head.”With my personality, I wouldn’t let Tian Xiaojun and the others off so easily. Only when you hurt him will the others be afraid. This is called killing the chicken to warn the monkeys ...”

“Come on!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”your names are a little scary. The effect will be the same whether I kill this chicken or not!”

“That’s why I’ve always said you’re soft – hearted!” Zhao Yongjun said with a smile.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile bitterly. If it was lone Wolf’s enemies who heard Zhao Yongjun’s comment, what would their reaction be?

However, they would never know the answer, because they had already gone to hell.

“Ruofei, are you interested in doing something with us?” Zhao asked suddenly.
