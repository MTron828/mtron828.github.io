Translator: 549690339

All the ingredients were ready. After Xia ruofei entered the spirit map space, he immediately rolled up his sleeves and began to cook this extremely complicated Southeast famous dish for the first time in his life.

He washed the Shaoxing wine jar and added about half a kilogram of clear water. The charcoal stoves at the side had already started the fire. Xia ruofei heated the wine jar over the light fire and poured out all the spirit pool water.

Then, he placed a small bamboo grandstand at the bottom of the jar that he had prepared earlier. He then wrapped the Chinese medicinal herbs that he had prepared earlier in gauze and placed them at the bottom.

This was also the essence of the secret recipe of the simmer – fried Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup.

After placing the Chinese medicine packets, Xia ruofei first put in the cooked chicken, duck, lamb, elbow, pig trotters, duck gizzards, pig bellies, mushrooms, and bamboo shoots. Then, he wrapped the shark’s fin, ham slices, dried scallops, and abalone slices in gauze and placed them on top of the chicken and duck ingredients. After that, he poured in the soup of the chicken and duck ingredients.

The first step of placing the ingredients was complete. Xia ruofei used a lotus leaf to seal the mouth of the jar tightly and placed a small bowl upside down.

Then, he placed the wine jar on the charcoal stove and simmered it slowly over a small fire for a full two hours. After opening the jar’s lid, he quickly put the thorny ginseng, chestnut tendons, fish lips, and fish belly into the jar. Then, he immediately sealed the jar’s mouth to prevent the fragrance of ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ from overflowing.

After the other ingredients were added, it was slowly stewed for more than three hours.

The Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup was considered complete.

Although the cooking process was nothing more than a slow stew, the formula of Chinese medicine, the order of stacking of ingredients, the time to add, the control of the fire, and so on ... There were many tricks. If they were not mastered well, this famous dish would lose its color.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power had already reached the late – Stage of the spiritual heart realm, which was equivalent to a cultivator at the sixth level of the Qi refining stage. Hence, his control of the fire could be said to have reached the pinnacle. Furthermore, he did not even need to open the jar lid to clearly detect the changes in each ingredient during the cooking process.

Hence, Xia ruofei was very clear that he had succeeded in making the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall.

Initially, to prevent any accidents, Xia ruofei had prepared three times the amount of ingredients. Now, he had no use for the spare ingredients. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

However, these ingredients would not go bad after they were processed and stored in the interspace. Besides, Xia ruofei was looking forward to the taste of the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ described in the secret recipe. There was not enough time today, and he did not want to ruin his anticipation in advance. He decided to bring this ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ to the Ling Ji private kitchen.

As for the remaining ingredients, he would save them for a few days when he wanted to eat them, and then enter the space to cook and enjoy them.

With a thought, Xia ruofei moved the charcoal stove and the small wine jar that contained the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ into the mountain and sea realm where time flowed at the same rate as the outside world.

Then, he told Xia Qing to take care of the charcoal stove and keep it warm with the smallest fire.

Xia Qing naturally nodded her head in agreement.

Xia ruofei left the medium and kept the painting.

At this time, only 20 minutes had passed in the outside world. It was not even 4:30 in the afternoon. When he was cooking the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup in the interspace, he had dealt with dozens of ingredients. It was inevitable that he would be stained with oil and smoke. Hence, Xia ruofei went to the bathroom to take a shower and changed into a clean and comfortable set of clothes.

Even though it was a meal on the table, Xia ruofei was only wearing a pair of casual pants and a casual shirt. It was not a formal outfit, but it was not too casual.

Xia ruofei looked at the time. It was almost FiveO’ clock. He took his bag and went downstairs, ready to leave.

He had an appointment with song Qiming at 6:30 am, and Ling Qingxue had also asked him to arrive before 6:30 am. However, he could not possibly go on time and make song Qiming and his family wait for him, could he? Moreover, his future father-in-law’s private restaurant was opening, so he had to be there earlier.

This was a matter of attitude.

Xia ruofei got into the Knight XV off – Road vehicle and reached into his pocket for the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ secret recipe that he had copied. Then, he started the car and drove towards the city.

……

In the center of Sanshan city, in the Wanbao Plaza.

Two beautiful girls were sitting on long chairs, each holding a cup of Starbucks matcha star ice cream.

One of them was a tall girl with snow – White skin and wearing a sleeveless chiffon dress. She said with a trace of guilt on her pretty face,””Yiyi, I’m sorry! I have something to do tonight, so I can’t go shopping with you today. I’ll take you shopping tomorrow!”

The other girl was wearing a navy blue Dickie T – Shirt, denim shorts, and a pair of white shoes. She was full of youth. She pouted and said,”Wei Wei, you’re too disloyal! It’s my first day at the three mountains, and you actually didn’t accompany me for dinner. You just left me behind and ran away ...”

The girl in the sleeveless chiffon dress was song Qiming’s daughter, Song Wei. The other girl was her University classmate, Zhuo Yiyi.

The archeology course was basically a monk class, and only Song Wei and Zhuo Yiyi were in their class. They were the two red spots among the green.

As the only two girls in the class, the two of them naturally became very good friends.

Initially, Zhuo Yiyi had planned to make use of the summer break to travel to Heron Island. When she heard that Song Wei had moved to Sanshan city, she had specially come all the way from Heron Island to Sanshan. She had only arrived at Sanshan this afternoon.

When Song Wei heard that her best friend was in her territory, she naturally wanted to come out and meet her. Song Qiming and Fang Liyun were much more relieved now that they had the medical report from 301 Hospital. They were not afraid that Song Wei would faint without any warning, but they just reminded her to be careful when she went out.
