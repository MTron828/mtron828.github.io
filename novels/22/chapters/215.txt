Chapter 216: Dr. Xia’s approach (1)

Xia ruofei took out a porcelain bottle on the far right and deftly unscrewed the cap. Then, he walked to the bed and reached for the oxygen mask that elder song was wearing with his other hand. “Bastard! What are you doing?” Liang Haitao roared and rushed towards Xia ruofei. But his body was stopped by a strong arm. The one who did it was elder song’s personal guard, Xu Wu. He only extended one hand and stopped Liang Haitao. Liang Haitao glared at Xu Wu and rebuked,””Xu Wu, get out of my way! I’m warning you, you’ve seriously violated medical discipline! Don’t keep making mistakes!” Xu Wu’s eyes were calm as he said indifferently,””Director Liang, since you’ve given up on saving the chief, I don’t think it’s a problem to let doctor Xia take over the chief’s treatment!” “Bullshit!” Liang Haitao cursed,”Who Do You Think You Are! Get lost!” Liang Haitao cursed as he pushed Xu Wu with all his might, but Xu Wu was as immovable as an iron tower. Liang Haitao’s small body was simply not on the same level as Xu Wu ‘s. “Dr. Zhao, Dr. Zhong, what are you two doing? Why aren’t you stopping that bastard?” Liang Haitao roared. The other two doctors in the ward were shocked at first, but they only reacted after hearing Liang Haitao’s roar. They quickly ran towards the bed. “Stop them!” Xu Wu shouted sternly. The two soldiers had already rushed into the ward when the conflict broke out. Now that they heard Xu Wu’s order, they didn’t even hesitate for a second. They immediately rushed in front of the two doctors and reached out to stop them. These 2 soldiers were from the Army that elder song had once served as the commander of. This time, their entire Reconnaissance Company had been deployed around the small courtyard, acting as elder song’s personal guard. As elder song’s personal guard, Xu Wu naturally became the direct leader of this company. Thus, the two soldiers did not hesitate to carry out Xu Wu’s orders. Manager Lu also shouted,”no one is allowed to get close to the bed!” Do Not Disturb doctor Xia’s treatment! Xu Wu, get a few more soldiers here!” Manager Lu had a calm personality, but he was not an indecisive person. Before elder song retired from his core leadership position, manager Lu had been his Secretary for a long time. How could a person who had been in the red wall of the palace for so many years be simple? Therefore, when he saw that they had already shed all pretenses of cordiality, he made a decision without any hesitation. “Understood!” “Yes!” Xu Wu replied loudly, then ordered loudly,”squad leader Lu, transfer everyone from your class here! Bring your weapons!” “Yes!” The corporal of the two soldiers immediately responded. Then, squad leader Lu quickly left the ward, while the other soldier held his gun and looked at the two doctors vigilantly. The two doctors were so scared that they didn’t dare to act rashly. Due to Xu Wu’s decisive reaction and manager Lu’s timely decision, the entire situation was under control. Xia ruofei turned around and grinned at Xu Wu,””Thank you! Comrade!” A rare smile appeared on Xu Wu’s usually stern face. However, he did not say anything and only nodded slightly at Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei gave the worried Tian Huilan a reassuring look, then reached for the oxygen mask again. This time, Xia ruofei did not hesitate. He took off his mask and put the porcelain bottle in his other hand to elder song’s lips. Liang Haitao, who had been flying into a rage the whole time, calmed down instead. He looked at Xia ruofei with a dark gaze and thought to himself,”If he takes off his mask, elder song won’t live for more than a minute. At that time, he’ll die in your hands. I’ll see how you end this! Manager Lu, Tian Huilan, and Xu Wu couldn’t help but hold their breaths. The alarm of the monitoring Instrument became more urgent, and the screen showed that elder song’s vital signs were dropping rapidly. Xia ruofei did not panic at all. He fed the petal herbal tea from the porcelain bottle into elder song’s mouth bit by bit. Even if a small portion leaked out from the corner of his mouth, Xia ruofei did not care about the composition of the petals. As long as it was in contact with his skin, it would be directly received by the human body. Xia ruofei fed elder song half a bottle before putting the oxygen mask back on. Then he tightened the bottle stopper and put the porcelain bottle on the bedside table. Then, he pulled a chair over and sat down in front of the bed. He put his hand on elder song’s wrist and began to take his pulse. Xia ruofei was very calm throughout the entire process. He closed his eyes when he felt her pulse and turned a deaf ear to the sharp alarm. The sound of hurried footsteps could be heard. The corporal Lu squad leader from earlier had arrived at the ward with eight or nine soldiers with loaded guns. “Squad leader Lu,” Xu Wu ordered.”Immediately organize a team to stand guard. Without my or manager Lu’s permission, no one is allowed to approach the ward!” “Yes!” Then, Xu Wu looked at Liang Haitao and said,””Director Liang, you guys should leave the ward first! From now on, doctor Xia will be in charge of the chief’s treatment!” “I can’t leave!” Liang Haitao said loudly,”the specialist medical Group was directly established by the central government’s office. What right do you have to remove me from my position as a mere security staff officer? If you’re so capable, then order them to shoot me!” Xu Wu’s face darkened.”Squad leader Lu,” he said,”get a few people over here and ‘invite’ director Liang and the others out!” “Yes!” Captain Lu replied loudly. With a wave of his hand, two soldiers immediately came over and closed in on Liang Haitao. “What do you want? Do you still have any discipline?” Liang Haitao rebuked. It was a soldier’s duty to obey orders. They didn’t care about Liang Haitao’s protests. Two people grabbed Liang Haitao’s arms and dragged him out. At this moment, Xia ruofei, who had been taking her pulse with his eyes closed, opened his eyes and said,””Forget it, let them stay! Aren’t these few people arrogant and looking down on Chinese medicine? Let’s show them the methods of Chinese medicine!” The soldier looked at Xu Wu. Xu Wu looked at Xia ruofei and nodded slightly, indicating that they should do as Xia ruofei said. Hence, the two soldiers immediately let go of Liang Haitao and retreated to the door to stand guard. There were many doctors and nurses from the medical team gathered outside the door, but they were all blocked outside the cordon. They couldn’t see what was happening in the room at all, and they were all talking nervously. Liang Haitao tidied up his white coat, which had been crumpled by the soldiers, and sneered at Xia ruofei.””Hmph! You won’t give up until you’ve reached the Yellow River! Chinese medicine? The Bureau chief’s vital signs have dropped to ...” At this point, Liang Haitao seemed to have been choked by someone and he stopped. His eyes were fixed on the screen of the monitoring device, and his face was full of disbelief, as if he had seen a ghost ...Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels
