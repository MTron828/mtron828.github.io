“Yes!” Xu Yougang and the other three stood up at the same time and answered firmly.

Then, the four of them each wrote down an account number for Xia ruofei and left.

Xia ruofei took the paper with the account number and called Lei Hu over.

“Brother Xia, you’ve arranged everything?” Lei Hu asked as soon as he entered.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” Xu Yougang and the others were not bad! You have a good eye for people, but ... What you said at the end was a little unnecessary. We’ve been comrades for so many years, don’t leave any gaps because of this ...”

“They wouldn’t dare!” Lei Hu chuckled. I’m just a former class monitor, giving them a reminder! But then again, if they really dare to be traitors, I won’t show them any mercy!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”it’s not that ... I’m not any worse than you when it comes to judging people!” Xu Yougang and the others aren’t that kind of people ...”

“Brother Xia is so wise. If you say it won’t happen, then it definitely won’t happen ...” Lei Hu scratched his head.

“You’re flattering me now ...” Xia ruofei laughed and scolded him.”I called you here because I have something for you to do!”

“Your orders!” Lei Hu immediately puffed out his chest and said.

Xia ruofei handed over the paper with the account number and said,””I have to transfer some money to them. You do it, don’t leave any traces!”

“Understood!” Lei Hu said,”I’ll prepare a safe account and send it to you later!”

Lei Hu’s so – called safe account was not his own. Although the real – Name System was very strict, there was always a way to operate it. Xia ruofei did not have to worry about this.

He was going to transfer the money from his overseas account to Lei Hu’s account, and then let Lei Hu transfer the money to Xu Yougang and the others ‘accounts. This way, even if Xu Yougang and the others made a mistake, and Liu haojun found out that they had recently transferred a large sum of money, the final clue would be cut off and would never be traced back to Xia ruofei.

He had always been cautious because he knew that a giant like the Liu family could never be too careful before they could completely overthrow Liu haojun. Once he was involved, he might not be in big trouble with his strong connections in Beijing. However, it was better to avoid trouble as much as possible. It was not appropriate to trouble elder song and the others, so he tried to avoid it as much as possible.

Xia ruofei nodded.”Don’t use your phone. Just write it down for me!”

Lei Hu chuckled and said,”got it!” Brother Xia, don’t worry! When the money comes to me, they’ll definitely withdraw it and transfer it to their account after a few rounds. They won’t be able to find out that it’s me ...”

“Oh right, brother Xia, how much money should we transfer to them?” Lei Hu asked.

Xia ruofei said,”I’ll transfer 100000 Yuan to everyone’s account first. I’ll pay them in advance. After all, their families are in a difficult situation. I’ll give them some money first to solve some of the problems at home.”

“Brother Xia, you’re so thoughtful,” Lei Hu nodded.

“Also ...” Xia ruofei said,”transfer another three million Yuan to Xu Yougang’s account ...”

“What?” Lei Hu’s eyes widened and he asked,”why are you giving so much money? Could it be that Xu Yougang was demanding an exorbitant price at the last minute? I’ll cut him to death!”

“When can you change your fiery temper?” Xia ruofei frowned and said,”you don’t need to buy equipment to help me? This is the money I gave them for their activities. Since you didn’t participate in it, don’t bother about it! Just do as I say and send the money over!”

Lei Hu scratched his head in embarrassment and said,”I see ... I know, brother Xia!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and let Lei Hu go.

Lei Hu was also very efficient. Before he even got off work in the morning, he had already sent a piece of paper with an account number written on it to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei took a look. It was an account under the name of a woman named Geng chrysanthemums. The bank was a branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China’s Sanshan branch, which was quite far from the company’s headquarters.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”okay, I’ll let you know when the money is in!” Get this done as soon as possible! Try to get it in by today!”

“Don’t worry! I guarantee that there won’t be any problems!” Lei Hu said with a smile.

After Lei Hu left, Xia ruofei started working on his computer.

He transferred 600000 USD from his overseas account to the account that Lei Hu had provided.

To be safe, Xia ruofei even used a proxy tool to find a few jumping boards overseas before logging into an overseas bank account.

There was a period of time when he felt that computer knowledge would be useful, so he bought a few hacking books to learn. He also practiced on the computer a few times.

As Xia ruofei’s spiritual power cultivation was getting higher and higher, his brain development was also much wider than ordinary people. The biggest advantage was that he learned things very quickly. Although he had only read a few books and practiced a few times, he could use some of the common methods used by hackers.

Although his level was definitely not comparable to some of the top hackers, he was still very familiar with beginner – Level operations such as avoiding IP tracing and erasing traces of online access.

After transferring the money, Xia ruofei used his phone to call Lei Hu.
