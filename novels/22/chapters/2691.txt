2692 The launch of the plan (2)

Translator: 5496903What he felt the most pressure was the island transformation project.

This was because Li Yifu already knew that although these modifications seemed ordinary, they were actually related to the activation of a natural array, and even related to the problem of life and death. Although the core work was done by Xia ruofei, he was also worried that if there were any deviations in the basic construction work, which would affect the formation, then he would be in deep trouble.

Xia ruofei smiled and said to Li Yifu and Liu Qingfeng,””Alright, you all can go do your own things! I’m leaving!”

After that, he walked straight to the accommodation ladder of the plane. When he saw Captain Liu An and the flight attendant waiting for him by the accommodation ladder, he remembered the recruitment of pilots.

Hence, Xia ruofei turned around and said to Li Yifu,””Foster husband, I suddenly thought of something ... Recently, I’ve been frequently flying from China to peach source Island. I’ve found that it’s really hard for Captain Liu and his crew. I would like to recruit an experienced pilot to form a three – man crew with them. This way, there will be one person who can take turns to rest during the flight. Help me with this!”

Paradise was originally a gift from Li Yifu to Xia ruofei. Nominally, it belonged to a navigation company under Li Yifu’s name. Liu An and the rest of the crew were also employees of this navigation company in name. Even their salaries were paid by Li Yifu.

In fact, this amount of money was nothing to Xia ruofei. If he wanted to enjoy life, he could afford to buy a few private planes. However, Li Yifu was being filial to Xia ruofei. If Xia ruofei did not accept it, Li Yifu would overthink it. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

As far as the recruitment of pilots was concerned, it was definitely more convenient to operate on Li Yifu’s side. It was also more convenient to put the labor relationship under the navigation company under Li Yifu’s name.

After Li Yifu heard this, he naturally agreed in a hurry. He said,””Mr. Xia, some of the pilots in my airline are of the G650 feiwan stream. I will assign the best pilot here right away!”

From Li Yifu’s point of view, Xia ruofei’s kindness to him could not be measured by money. Even if he was asked to give all his assets to Xia ruofei, he would give them out willingly without hesitation. Of course, he knew that Xia ruofei would definitely not accept it. However, he would be happy to do something for Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,””I haven’t decided on my schedule in China yet. After you’ve chosen your men, you can go to Peach Blossom Island with your next group and wait for them. Let Captain Liu and the others work hard for you two more times!”

When Liu An heard this, he quickly said,””No problem! President Xia, it’s not hard on us! There’s no need to increase the number of people!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”We still need to increase the number of people. According to the regulations of China Civil Aviation, every time you Fly to Paradise Island, it’s considered a overtime flight. We still have to respect science.”

Then, Xia ruofei said to Li Yifu,””Then it’s decided!”

“Yes, Mr. Xia!” Li Yifu quickly said respectfully.

Xia ruofei didn’t say anything else and stepped onto the ramp. Captain Liu An and the crew followed Xia ruofei and quickly boarded the plane.

Xia ruofei waved at everyone from the cabin door and walked into the cabin.

Because the flight preparations had been made in advance, and there was no problem with queuing for take – off at Peach Blossom Island Airport, the plane quickly taxied to the runway and took off after the door was closed.

After more than 10 hours of flight, as usual, they landed in BlackBerry to refuel. Paradise finally landed smoothly on the runway of Beijing International Airport in the night.

Xia ruofei did not inform anyone of his return this time. He came out of the office building in a low – Profile manner, then took a taxi and left the airport.

He didn’t return to the courtyard in liuhai Lane, but took a taxi directly to the peach blossom Association in the suburbs town of Xiaotang.

As the major shareholder, Xia ruofei had a room in the peach blossom Association that he could stay in anytime he wanted.

The security guard at the entrance saw Xia ruofei and immediately saluted.””Hello, President Xia!”

“Who’s here today?”Xia ruofei nodded and asked.

“Reporting to President Xia! President Zhao is having a banquet here today, and the other presidents are not here. ” The security guard replied.

“I know.” Xia ruofei said,”there’s no need to inform him. Help me arrange an electric car to send me to the lakeside villa.”

There was a small villa by the lake that was specially reserved for Xia ruofei. It was the core of the formation. Under Xia ruofei’s arrangement, most of the gathered spiritual Qi was locked in the small villa. The spiritual Qi there was very dense.

Xia ruofei didn’t return to liuhai Lane. On one hand, he didn’t want Wang Boshan to know that he had returned. On the other hand, he wanted to adjust his condition to the best state at paradise gathering and then complete the carving of the core array disc.

Because of Xia ruofei’s special instructions, no one would enter the villa, including Zhao Yongjun and the others. Even if they came to look for Xia ruofei, they would wait outside the door. So when Xia ruofei rested here, no one would disturb him.

“Yes, President Xia!” The security guard quickly said.

The security guard quickly called for an electric car and prepared to send Xia ruofei to the small lakeside villa.

Before Xia ruofei got into the car, he said,”I have something to deal with tonight. Please don’t tell President Zhao that I’m back. He has to spend time with his friends. I don’t want to distract him.”

“Understood!” The security guard replied.

Xia ruofei arrived at the lakeside villa in no time on the battery – powered car. He scanned his fingerprint to enter the villa. Xia ruofei instantly felt refreshed. Although this was not the room where the relic was, the concentration of spiritual Qi was much higher than outside.

This was also the reason why Xia ruofei had specially set up a villa to lock up most of the spiritual Qi. If he followed the speed at which the spiritual Qi gathered and evenly distributed the spiritual Qi within the range of the formation, this place would be comparable to the encampment of some small sects. It might attract the attention of cultivators very quickly.

After Xia ruofei closed the door, he walked straight into the room where the formation core was.

Xia ruofei had also set up a spirit locking array around the room, locking most of the spiritual Qi in the room.

In fact, even cultivators with average array skills would find it difficult to break through the array and enter the room, let alone ordinary people.

Of course, this formation was set up by Xia ruofei himself, so it was easy for him to enter.

After entering the room, the concentration of spiritual Qi instantly increased by a large margin.

With a thought, Xia ruofei took out a Jade futon from the space and sat cross – legged on it. He took out a piece of origin crystal and started cultivating.

Recently, he had been busy with the affairs of the Peach Blossom Island and had very little time to cultivate.

His cultivation had already reached refined Qi level 9, and he could faintly feel the barrier. What he lacked now was accumulation.

After all, the difficulty of breaking through a major realm was much higher than before.

Of course, compared to the other cultivators on earth, Xia ruofei already had a unique advantage. He did not lack cultivation resources and the “great Dao technique” he was cultivating was definitely the best kind. Naturally, he was much more efficient.

What he needed to break through to the next major realm was sufficient accumulation. Under normal circumstances, he would not be trapped in this bottleneck for too long.

Therefore, he had a rare moment of free time today, so he quickly sat down to cultivate and adjust his state of mind in preparation for inscribing the core array disc.

The night passed by in a flash. When the sun shone through the window, Xia ruofei finally let out a long breath and stood up from the Jade futon.

At this time, he felt that his whole body was full of strength, and the fatigue brought by the busy days had been swept away.

After a whole night of cultivation, Xia ruofei could clearly feel that his cultivation had steadily improved and he was closer to breaking through to the next realm.

Xia ruofei stretched his arms and legs, took a deep breath, and took out his phone from his pocket ...
