2360 Capturing the Golden Fox (1)

Chapter 1303: the first Prince!

In a short while, the outline of the campsite appeared in front of Xia ruofei.

Although this camp was called a secret training camp, it was not low – Key at all. It occupied nearly half of the land in Basoko town.

Tall walls, electric barbed wire, searchlights that swept through the night, tall watchtowers ... Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Everything here clearly showed that this was a heavily – guarded military fortress.

Xia ruofei was very calm. To be honest, this operation was not difficult for him at his current level of cultivation. However, he still maintained his cautious habit.

Even a Lion would use all its strength to hunt a rabbit.

Xia ruofei sneaked to the edge of the training camp. He hid in the shadows and released his spiritual power to investigate.

According to the statements of pardu and the other captives, the defense of the modr training camp was very tight. Not only was there a high wall installed with live barbed wire, but there were also many infrared cameras installed around the area. Sentries patrolled the training camp 24 hours a day. In addition, there were ten watchtowers at the highest point. It was almost impossible for outsiders to sneak into the training camp without anyone knowing.

Of course, to Xia ruofei, it was only a little troublesome. He was not stumped by these defensive measures.

The results of the investigation quickly formed a three – dimensional structure in Xia ruofei’s mind. He had already known every camera in the area.

Xia ruofei continued to use his spiritual power to investigate patiently, silently memorizing the movement pattern of the mobile outpost.

He calculated a few times in his mind. When his mental power detected that a patrol team had just passed by this side of the wall, he said to himself,””This is the time!”

Xia ruofei did not hesitate. He tapped the ground with the tip of his foot and shot out like lightning. In the blink of an eye, he had arrived at the training camp’s wall.

The location he chose was also very particular. It just so happened that there was a very small blind spot for the camera, and the nearest Watchtower was about 20 meters away from here. Under the cover of the tree shadow, as long as he was fast enough, the Sentry on the Watchtower would not easily find him.

Especially at two in the morning, when people were the most tired. In addition to the notorious reputation of the modr training camp, under normal circumstances, very few people would dare to cause trouble. Therefore, it was almost impossible for the Sentinels to be on high alert at all times.

In fact, Xia ruofei thought that as long as the sentries on the Watchtower did not doze off, they would be considered very professional.

He stopped for a moment under the wall and used his mental power to scan the nearest Watchtower.

Sure enough, the Sentry lazily held his gun and looked around from time to time, as if he was dealing with business.

The Sentry had just turned around, and his back was facing this direction.

Xia ruofei no longer hesitated. He tapped the ground lightly with the tip of his foot and leaped up. When the lifting force was gradually exhausted, he gently tapped on the wall, and his body suddenly rose a little higher.

The next moment, Xia ruofei’s hand grabbed the edge of the wall. He exerted a little force and his body flipped over the wire mesh above the wall. He disappeared into the dark shadows on the other side of the wall.

After Xia ruofei landed on the ground, he rolled forward to dissipate the force. He was as light as a civet cat and did not make any sound at all. He had already easily hidden in the shadows under the wall.

From the moment he came out of hiding to the moment he easily jumped over the wall and landed on the ground, the whole process only took two or three seconds.

After entering the modr training camp, Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to scan the area and quickly locked onto a three – story building.

The three – story building was located on the west side of the training camp. According to pardu and the others, it was where the higher – ups of the training camp and the instructors worked and lived. The person in charge of the training camp, the guy codenamed “Golden Fox,” was likely to be in this small building.

In addition to rows of single – story houses as student dormitories, there were several other buildings in the training camp. The three – story building was located in the middle of these buildings, and there was a very spacious tactical training ground between it and the student dormitories.

There were all kinds of obstacles set up by humans in the tactical training ground. There was also a building about four stories high. The building looked old, especially the walls, which were very mottled. It was specially used for students to train their climbing skills. No one lived in it at night.

If Xia ruofei wanted to reach the three – story building, he had to pass through the tactical training ground.

This was a large open area, and the searchlights on the Watchtower would turn around from time to time, so it was not easy to pass through.

Fortunately, the tactical training ground was not an ordinary field. There were many obstacles set up here, and in many places, in order to simulate the battlefield environment in the wild, some grass was also planted to block the vision.

Xia ruofei kept using his spiritual power to scan the tactical training ground. At the same time, he was silently calculating the pattern of the searchlights on the watchtowers turning.

After a long time, he took a deep breath and jumped out of the shadow under the wall. With lightning speed, he jumped into a single soldier pit in the training ground that was half the height of a person.

Then his figure flashed and moved on the training ground, sometimes using the cover of the training logs to move forward, sometimes jumping into the grass and crawling forward, during which he also deftly rolled to avoid the searchlight.
