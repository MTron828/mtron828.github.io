Chapter 3439: You’re still the ruthless one (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei was also dumbfounded. He said weakly,””I’ve never encountered such a situation before! Why don’t you … Try and see if you can pull your hand out? It can’t be stuck, right?”

“Oh!” Ling Qingxue said adorably.

Then, she really slowly pulled her hand out.

“Stop, stop, stop, stop!” Xia ruofei quickly called out. You’re really pulling it out! I was just joking! What if I can’t reach in later? Really… You’ve already reached your hand into the barrier, and you still need to ask me what to do? Of course we’re going to get that crystal card!”

Ling Qingxue could not help but glare at Xia ruofei and said,””You’re still joking with me at a time like this!”

Xia ruofei chuckled,”you scared me.” Try to ease the atmosphere… Qingxue, slowly reach in and try to take the crystal card off. You must be slow! If there’s anything wrong, immediately retreat!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Xia ruofei felt that the current situation was a little strange. He did not know if Ling Qingxue would be in danger if she went to get the crystal card. Everything had gone so smoothly that it did not seem real.

However, it was impossible for him to give up under such circumstances. Xia ruofei did not have the ability to break the barrier. Otherwise, he would not have let Ling Qingxue take the risk.

Of course, looking at the situation, it didn’t seem like there was any danger.

Xia ruofei thought to himself,”could it be that… This crystal card is not only protected by this barrier?” Otherwise, this would be too easy!

While Xia ruofei was still lost in his thoughts, Ling Qingxue had already reached her hand in and gently grabbed the crystal card.

Then, Ling Qingxue turned to look at Xia ruofei and pulled her hand back from the crystal card.

Xia ruofei’s eyes widened as he watched Ling Qingxue take out the crystal card just like that. It was as simple as eating and drinking.

“This …” Xia ruofei felt like his brain was about to crash.

“This …” In the secret space enshrouded in purple mist, the green – robed elder was dumbfounded. He could not believe his eyes.

Could it be that there was a problem with the barrier? It can’t be! Just now, that little child had exerted a Herculean effort, but he still couldn’t make a single crack appear on the barrier! This girl was only at the Qi layer, how did she do it?

All of this was clearly beyond the green – robed elder’s expectations. Of course, this was not what he had planned in advance.

Previously, Xia ruofei had overcome all the obstacles and passed through one level after another. Although he had performed amazingly, it was basically within his ability. At most, he had performed beyond his usual limits or perhaps he was more talented than the average cultivator. In addition, his reaction time was faster and he could find the appropriate way to deal with it every time. Therefore, the green – robed elder only praised him secretly and did not lose his composure as he did now.

“How is this possible? Even if this girl had the cultivation of the original infant stage, it would be impossible for her to get the control core of the heavenly cloud Palace so easily!” The green – robed elder muttered to himself.

This crystal plate was actually the control core of the entire heavenly cloud Palace. As the main part of the trial Pagoda’s seventh level, the importance of the heavenly cloud Palace could be imagined. For countless years, not only were there Qi refining stage and golden core stage cultivators who came to the trial Pagoda to take the test, but there were also nascent Soul Stage cultivators who entered. Among the cultivators who made it to the seventh level of the trial Pagoda, there was no lack of nascent Soul Stage cultivators.

But so far, no one, including those original infant stage cultivators, had been able to take away the core control of the heavenly cloud Palace.

The wizardry barrier was extremely strong. Even a nascent soul advanced stage cultivator could not break it.

Only immortal soul Stage cultivators had a chance.

However, immortal soul Stage cultivators were no longer within the scope of the trial Pagoda’s test.

Therefore, the core control of the heavenly cloud Palace was very safe. It was usually placed in this Pavilion without any other cover or protection.

The original design was to let the cultivators who had broken through the many obstacles in the cloud Palace understand that there was always someone better.

To put it bluntly, it was deliberately placed there, so that these geniuses who had passed through many obstacles could see it but not touch it. It would dampen their spirit and prevent them from being arrogant and conceited.

But today, this arrangement had an accident with a Qi layer cultivator.

The barrier did not seem to have any effect on Ling Qingxue. She did not even need to break the barrier to be able to take out the control core of the heavenly cloud Palace.

The green – robed old man couldn’t help but be dumbfounded by this unexpected event.

He was stunned for a long time before he muttered to himself, “”There must be a problem with the barrier. But it didn’t matter. The control core couldn’t be stored in a storage treasure anyway. When they went to the 8th floor of the trial Pagoda, the control core would naturally be kept. By the way, she can’t possibly make the cloud heaven Palace recognize her as their master, right?”

At this point, the green – robed old man couldn’t help but laugh and muttered to himself,””What am I thinking? For so many years, even I have not been able to make the cloud Palace recognize me as its master. Until now, I can only reluctantly use part of the cloud Palace’s functions. She is just a little girl in the lianqi stage, how can she do it?”

As soon as the green – robed elder finished speaking, on the seventh level of the Tower of Trials, in the pavilion in the back garden of the heavenly cloud Palace, Ling Qingxue said to Xia ruofei with uncertainty,””Ruoffei…This….This crystal plate seems to contact me on its own initiative!”
