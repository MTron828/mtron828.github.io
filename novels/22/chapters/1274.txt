Chapter 1275: The beginning of spiritual intelligence (2)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei paused for a moment and then said,””You can bring him to the mountain sea realm. Isn’t there a large patch of grass there? Just let it eat the grass!”

“Understood, master!”

“However, I still let it stay at the Archean realm most of the time!” Xia ruofei said,”by the way, you must watch it carefully. Don’t let it destroy the things in the space!”

To put it bluntly, even if the “star of Hong Kong” broke his leg again, Xia ruofei wouldn’t be particularly concerned. He could completely cure it. However, everything in the Archean realm was a precious crop! If the spirit heart tree was destroyed, Xia ruofei’s career would be in jeopardy, not to mention the wild ginseng, iron – Skin dendrobe, and golden Phoebe. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

That’s why he kept nagging at Xia Qing.

Xia ruofei said solemnly,”master, don’t worry!” I’ll definitely keep my eyes on it!”

“Good! Then you’ve worked hard. ” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll go out first!”

“Take care, master!”

Xia ruofei walked over and touched the star of Hong Kong’s mane. He didn’t care if it understood him or not. He gave it a few more instructions and then left the spirit map space.

It was almost midnight. Xia ruofei washed up in the bathroom and went to bed.

There were still six to seven hours left until dawn, which meant that the star of Hong Kong could stay in the spirit map for seven to eight days.

In an environment with such rich spiritual energy, his injuries should have been more or less healed after so many days.

Xia ruofei didn’t forget to use a bit of his spiritual power even when he was sleeping. This way, if there was any movement outside or if Xia Qing urgently contacted him in the space, he would be able to respond immediately.

After lying on the bed, Xia ruofei fell asleep in no time.

Xia ruofei woke up on time at around seven in the morning.

He got out of bed and released his spiritual power to explore the area. There was no movement outside. He didn’t bother to wash up and took out the spirit map scroll. He entered the space with a thought.

Of course, he didn’t forget to leave a trace of mental strength in the outside world. This way, if there was any movement, he could quickly detect that Yingying was not in his home. It was better to be careful.

After entering the space, Xia ruofei felt a gust of wind and the sound of horse hooves.

He took a closer look and saw that it was the “star of Hong Kong” running towards him.

From the way she ran, it seemed that her leg injury had been completely healed, and even the splint had been taken off by Xia Qing.

The “star of Hong Kong” ran to Xia ruofei and immediately lowered his head. He stuck out his tongue and licked Xia ruofei’s hand affectionately.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”Little guy, it seems that your injuries have recovered well!”

Xia Qing also walked over and respectfully said,””Master, I’ve examined the horse. The injury was basically healed on the fifth day, so I took off the splint.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” Well done! Since it’s completely healed, there’s no point in using a splint. ”

The star of Hong Kong kept its head down and rubbed against Xia ruofei’s body. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but like it. He stroked its mane and said with a smile,””This time you’ve saved your life. You’re bound to be blessed after surviving a great disaster. I’m still looking forward to your future on the field! Speaking of which, I’ve bet 10000 Hong Kong dollars on you! Who knew that you wouldn’t give me any strength. This time, I really lost all my money. I still hope to win it back from you in the future!”

Xia ruofei nagged on and on. The star of Hong Kong couldn’t understand what he was saying, but he could feel the closeness between him and Xia ruofei.

After staying in the spiritual Qi – rich space for eight to nine days, it seemed to have become more intelligent. It knew that Xia ruofei had saved it, so it subconsciously became closer to Xia ruofei.

Furthermore, it was a horse’s nature to submit to the strong. The process of taming a horse was actually a process of constantly wearing down their wildness. The scene of Xia ruofei suppressing it with one hand had left a deep impression in its heart. Even if Xia ruofei was strictly speaking a stranger, if Xia ruofei wanted to ride it and run a lap, it would definitely not resist.

Xia ruofei didn’t waste any time. After a few words, he smiled and said,””I’m going to take you out, but I’ll have to tie you up first, or director Guo and the others will be scared!”

To be able to completely heal such a serious injury as a bone fracture overnight, it would really scare people if this was spread out.

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words,”star of Hong Kong” ran to the shelf that was holding him in place. He stepped on the shelf and lay down lazily.

Seeing this, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be stunned. He said to Xia Qing,””It ... It understood what I just said?”

Xia Qing smiled and said,”the environment in the spirit map world is too unique. Most of the creatures here have gained sentience. It’s just that the horse has only stayed here for a short time, so it’s not very obvious. But if it’s simple, it should be able to understand!”

Xia ruofei mumbled.”This is really powerful ... This time, director Guo is really lucky. In the future, the effects of taming and training the ‘star of Hong Kong’ will definitely be much better than before!”

Of course, Xia ruofei was just saying it. He naturally did not care too much about it.

Since they were in Guo Hongjiang’s training base, Xia ruofei didn’t dawdle much. He quickly tied up the “star of Hong Kong” with a rope and beckoned to Xia Qing before leaving the spirit map space with the “star of Hong Kong”.

After returning to the outside world, Xia ruofei had just finished washing up when Guo Hongjiang knocked on the door gently.

“Mr. Xia, I hope I didn’t disturb your rest.” Guo Hongjiang asked with a smile. Then, he couldn’t help but glance at the “star of Hong Kong”.

He didn’t sleep well last night, and he was worried about his personal gains and losses.

Of course, he hoped that Xia ruofei could cure the “star of Hong Kong”. However, he was afraid that the more he hoped, the more disappointed he would be. Besides, he was constantly worried about what would happen to the “star of Hong Kong” at night, so he tossed and turned in bed and only fell asleep after midnight.

Xia ruofei smiled.”No, no. I’ve been up for a long time!”

“Xia Sheng, I’ll get someone to bring breakfast to the room!” Guo Hongjiang said,”I’ll have to trouble you with the treatment of the star of Hong Kong ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you’re welcome, director Guo. After one night, the effects of the ointment that I’ve made have been fully exerted. ‘Star of Hong Kong’ is in a good condition now. The swelling has basically disappeared. I think he will be free by tomorrow at the latest.”

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Guo Hongjiang subconsciously looked at the injured leg of the “star of Hong Kong”.

If not for Xia ruofei’s reminder, he might not have noticed it. Now that he had a closer look, he realized that the “star of Hong Kong” ‘s hind leg was not swollen at all. If he had not seen the terrible state of the “star of Hong Kong” ‘s fracture yesterday, he would have even thought that the “star of Hong Kong” was not injured at all.

In fact, the “star of Hong Kong” was not injured at all. Although it was said that a bone injury was not suitable for strenuous exercise, and his competitive condition would definitely decline, objectively speaking, the fracture had completely healed.

“Mr. Xia, this ... This ...” Guo Hongjiang was so excited that he was incoherent.”This is really a miraculous hand that can bring you back to life!”

“You’re welcome, Mister Guo. We’re only halfway through our recovery!” Xia ruofei said,”after it fully recuperates, it will need to undergo recovery training. It will probably take one or two months for it to be able to compete again!”

Guo Hongjiang was stunned. He said,””Mr ... Mr. Xia, did I hear you wrong? You ... You’re saying that the ‘star of Hong Kong’ can return to the competition?”
