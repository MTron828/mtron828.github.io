“Thank you, young sect master!” Shen Hu quickly bowed and said.

Chen Xuan smiled.”There’s no need to be so polite. You’re our guest. Furthermore, miss Lu is brother ruofei’s friend. I should take care of you even more! Sect Master Shen, you can stay here with peace of mind. If anyone dares to make things difficult for you, you can report to me directly!”

“Yes! Thank you, young sect leader!” Shen Hu bowed and said.

“Thank you, young sect master!” Lu You also said quickly.

At this moment, Chi Qingqing and Lu Yuqing were still tidying up things in their rooms, so they naturally heard everything that had happened in the courtyard. They were so regretful that if Qianqian had known that the water element sect had such a relationship, she wouldn’t have provoked the water element sect on purpose even if they had more guts!

In fact, Lu Yuqing was just unhappy that she was arranged to live with other cultivators, so she used this as an excuse to make a fuss. Lu You did not offend her at all.

If she had known that Lu You’s friend was close to Chen Xuan, she would have been out of her mind to make things difficult for Lu You on purpose. She wouldn’t even have had the time to curry favor with her, alright?

However, there was no medicine for regret in this world. Chi Qingqing and Lu Yuqing could only swallow this bitter fruit. If Chen Nanfeng succeeded in breaking through tomorrow, their luoshen sect’s days would definitely be worse.

Once the first heaven sect rose to its peak, the sects that had offended them or were disliked by Chen Nanfeng and Chen Xuan would not mind hitting them when they were down.

There had always been fewer people who sent charcoal in the snow, more people who added flowers to a brocade, and even more people who hit someone when they were down.

Chi Qingqing sighed and said to Lu Yuqing,””Yuqing, you’ve learned your lesson. You have to pay attention to the way you conduct yourself in the future H

Lu Yuqing said painfully,”master, I know 1 was wrong. I didn’t know that Lu You had such a strong background. Moreover, you saw it yesterday. Shen Hu and his disciple were very cautious. They didn’t seem like people with a strong background. Who knew they had such a relationship …”

Chi Qingqing waved her hand and said,”there’s no point in saying this now. You have to learn from your mistakes in the future. No matter who you’re dealing with, it’s always good for you to be a little more amiable.”

“Yes, I’ll remember that…” Lu Yuqing said with her head slightly lowered. In fact, she didn’t agree with it, but the truth was out there. She was the one who had caused this incident. Of course, Chi Qingqing’s intentional connivance was also an important reason. However, in terms of responsibility, Lu Yuqing was definitely the first to bear the brunt, so she had nothing to say.

However, her talent was considered to be the best among the shorties. Therefore, even though she had caused a big disaster this time, the luoshen sect should not directly send her to the eighteenth level of hell. In short, talent was rare. She just had to pay more attention in the future.

However, in general, at least the recent days were not very good.

Chi Qingqing sighed and said,””Yuqing, let’s go! Don’t let them chase us away again…”

Lu Yuqing lowered her head in humiliation.”Yes, master!” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

When Chi Qingqing and Lu Yuqing came out, Shen Hao and his disciple had already left. The male cultivator packed his things relatively quickly. Since he was sharing a courtyard with someone else, and their positions were very straight, he packed his things cleanly and left.

As the two of them walked out of the room, Chen Xuan was also preparing to leave.

“Thank you, young sect master!” Shen Hu quickly bowed and said.

Chen Xuan smiled.’There’s no need to be so polite. You’re our guest. Furthermore, miss Lu is brother ruofei’s friend. I should take care of you even more! Sect Master Shen, you can stay here with peace of mind. If anyone dares to make things difficult for you, you can report to me directly!”

They were so regretful that if Qianqian had known that the water element sect had such a relationship, she wouldn’t have provoked the water element sect on purpose even if they were given more courage!

In fact, Lu Yuqing was just unhappy that she was arranged to live with other cultivators, so she used this as an excuse to make a fuss. Lu You did not offend her at all.
