Chapter 1587: New spatial ability (2)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei chuckled and continued,””I have a courtyard house in the capital. It’s a stand – alone place, and it’s far away from the three mountains. It’ll be easier for us to cultivate together.”

Song Rui and the others had been working on the club since before the new year. As one of the major shareholders, Xia ruofei could not just sit back and do nothing. Song Rui would probably urge him to go to the capital soon.

When Song Wei heard that Xia ruofei was going to the capital soon, her face lit up and she said,””You’re going to Beijing too! There’s no problem then ...”

However, she quickly said dejectedly,””But this isn’t a long – term plan! You’ll have to return to the three mountains eventually, and you’re only staying in the capital temporarily ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”don’t forget that we have a time formation. If you stay in the capital for a while, it should be enough for you to break through to Qi disciple Level 3. Then, we can try to get rid of the peach blossom miasma!”

However, Song Wei did not feel happy. She asked,””What happens after the peach blossom miasma is removed? What if I still want to continue cultivating?”

Xia ruofei was stunned. He scratched his head and said,””This ... This doesn’t matter. The” absolute beginning Heart Sutra “ultimately requires two people to cultivate together, and it is indeed a little troublesome. When the time comes, I will find you a cultivation technique that is suitable for girls to cultivate. You can cultivate it as your main cultivation technique, and then you can cultivate it alone!”

Song Wei’s eyes flashed with a hint of disappointment. She forced a smile and said,”Alright! You’re very thoughtful ... I’ll go back now ...” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Mm! Think about how you’re going to tell your parents, don’t let anything slip!” Xia ruofei reminded.

“I know!” Song Wei smiled.

“Ruofei, did the diary in my phone scare you?” she suddenly asked.

Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat. However, he quickly revealed a look of appropriate shock and asked with a blank face,””Diary? What diary?”

Song Wei had been observing Xia ruofei’s expression. However, with Xia ruofei’s mental fortitude, he would not reveal any flaws. From the moment he heard Song Wei’s sudden question until now, his reaction had been flawless. It was a normal reaction.

Song Wei sighed in disappointment and said,””Oh, it’s nothing ... Ruofei, I’ll take my leave first!”

“Mm! Be careful!” Xia ruofei said.

He looked at Song Wei’s back through the car window. When she turned the corner of the street, Xia ruofei muttered to himself,””It’s not that easy to trick me into coming out. Song Wei! I don’t know how to face this either, so ... I’ll just pretend I don’t know anything ...”

Xia ruofei sighed and started the car again. He made a turn at the intersection and drove out of the city.

......

Taoyuan farm, a small villa.

Xia ruofei passed pang Hao’s car keys to ye Lingyun as he walked into the courtyard.

At this moment, lightning and Blackie rushed out of their kennels and wagged their tails at Xia ruofei affectionately. Xia ruofei had been away for more than ten days, and these highly intelligent pets missed him very much.

Xia ruofei squatted down and played with the dogs as he said to ye Lingyun,””Ling Yun, I’ll have to trouble you to send the car keys to pang Hao. He’ll definitely need the car after work.”

Now that it was almost time to get off work, Xia ruofei did not want to appear in the office building again. Otherwise, Feng Jing, pang Hao, and the others would have a lot of things to report to him after he had been away for so many days. He was not in the mood to care about the company now. He would think about it tomorrow!

“Alright, brother Xia!” “Your suitcase is in the guest room on the second floor,” ye Lingyun said.”I’ve also brought people to clean up the room.”

“You’re so attentive!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”alright, you can go first! Come over tonight, let’s have a drink together as brothers!”

“Alright!” Ye linyun said.

After ye Lingyun left, Xia ruofei played with Blackie and lightning for a while more before he got up and walked into the villa.

The windows in the villa were clean, even the corners were very clean. It seemed that ye Lingyun not only brought people to clean it just now, but he also came to maintain the cleanliness often.

Xia ruofei went straight to the guest room on the second floor and put the four boxes of raw stones into the spirit map space. Then, he returned to his master bedroom.

Even though he had absolute trust in ye Lingyun, Xia ruofei still checked the room carefully. After making sure that there was no problem, he went to lock the door and pulled the curtains.

He first went to the bathroom to take a shower. After washing away the dust on his body, he changed into loose and comfortable home clothes and went back to the bedroom in his slippers.

Xia ruofei summoned the spirit map scroll from his palm. With a thought, he disappeared from the room and appeared in the spirit map space at the beginning realm.

“Master!” Xia Qing stood by the spatial spirit pond and bowed respectfully to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei nodded and asked,”is everything fine in the spirit map world?” Did that little guy cause any trouble?”

The little guy that Xia ruofei was talking about was naturally the world Fox, the darling of the space.

“I’m fine. It’s just that I was too engrossed in my comprehension and accidentally damaged the herbs I planted ...” Xia Qing said.

When the realm Fox was comprehending the rules of space, it often needed to go to different spatial nodes. Some of these spatial nodes were located in the middle of the herb garden. Sometimes, when it was too engrossed, it would accidentally step on a few herbs. There was even a node in the area where the terrifying Hornet was kept. The realm Fox also wanted to break into it, but it was fortunately stopped by Xia Qing in time.

After Xia ruofei heard this, he said,”it seems like we need to teach it a lesson!” Otherwise, this little guy might take advantage of you!”

Xia Qing smiled and didn’t say anything.

Xia ruofei continued.”I didn’t have a suitable opportunity for a while. I came in today to see if there are any new changes after the space was upgraded.”

The last time, Xia ruofei did not hesitate to upgrade the spirit map space by two levels in order to unlock the spirit Island on the sea and find the heart – concentrating grass to treat Song Wei’s soul injury. He did not have the time to pay attention to the changes in the other parts of the space.

Although Song Wei had woken up, it was not convenient for her to stay in a hotel all the time. Besides, it was not an urgent matter like finding the heart – concentrating grass to save her life. Hence, Xia ruofei did not enter the spirit map space again.

The spirit Qi in the spirit map space naturally became denser. In many places, there was even a drizzle of Liquid Spirit Qi. This Liquid Spirit Qi fell into the earth, soil, mountains, and rivers in the space, then gradually turned into gas and rose slowly. It condensed in the upper half of the space, then turned into liquid and fell down, continuing to nourish the earth. This process was like a cycle of nature.

Xia ruofei felt that if the space continued to upgrade, there would be a day when spiritual crystals would be produced underground.

The area of the mountain and sea realm had doubled again, reaching almost 20000 mu. If Xia ruofei could not cover the entire area with his mind in the space, he would have had to spend a long time calculating this area.

Xia ruofei walked around the space and felt that he was more in sync with the spirit map space. Naturally, his control of the spirit map space was strengthened. He could even feel the basic rules of the space.

Although this feeling was very hazy, it still made Xia ruofei’s understanding and use of space improve by more than one level.

Xia ruofei’s eyes were slightly closed. After a long time, he suddenly opened his eyes. With a slight thought, the reclining chair beside the spiritual pond suddenly disappeared.

In the next moment, the reclining chair appeared about ten meters above the spatial spirit pool and floated steadily in the air.

Xia ruofei’s face could not help but reveal a trace of joy. His heart could not help but feel excited. This was not supported by the invisible force of space. It could be said that Xia ruofei’s successful experiment was something that he could never have done before. This was a new level of control over space, just like a new skill developed in a game.

After thinking about it, Xia ruofei knew how useful this new skill was. Even the steady him could not help but be overjoyed ...
