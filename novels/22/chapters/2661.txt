2662 A decision made in one word (1)

Hearing this, Xia ruofei was overjoyed and said,”that’s great!” Wolf King, you’re simply sending charcoal in the snow! I’m going to set up a guard team on the island, and I’ll need someone to take care of the vehicles, equipment, and fuel. There’s even a super Jaguar on the island! By then, I can get Section Chief Liu to help me manage the entire logistics department!”

Hearing this, Liu mingtian’s heart was put at ease. He had been worried that he was too old, and his military skills were not as good as Ma Jia and the others. Besides, he had not had much contact with Xia ruofei before, so he was worried that Xia ruofei would not want him!

He did not expect Xia ruofei to be so forthright and trust him so much.

Liu mingtian stood up with his cup in hand and said,”President Xia, thank you for your trust! I’ll use this drink in place of wine to propose a toast to you!”

Xia ruofei quickly waved his hand and said,”Section Chief Liu, you’re an old leader. It’s too distant to call me President Xia!” You can call me RUO Fei like old company commander!”

Xia ruofei picked up his glass and stood up. He clinked his glass with Liu mingtian’s and said,””Section Chief Liu, I’ll give you a toast. I hope that after you work in my company, everyone will work together to do a good job! I’ll drink first!”

With that, Xia ruofei clinked glasses with Liu mingtian across Guo Zhan, then raised his head and finished his drink.

Liu mingtian also finished his drink and said,”Ruofei, since that’s the case, you should stop calling me Section Chief Liu. I won’t be able to stay as a Section Chief for long. In the future, I’ll be your soldier! I think you should just call me old Liu!”

“I wouldn’t dare to.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ll call you brother Liu! Having an old man at home is like having a treasure. In the future, with you overseeing my Paradise Island, I will be much more at ease!”

Besides Ma Jia and Liu mingtian, there were two other lieutenants, a first lieutenant and a Lieutenant. Both of their eyes became eager.

Guo Zhan glanced at them and scolded with a smile,”Look at how useless you two are!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Then, he turned to Xia ruofei and said,””Ruofei, there are still two more! Let me introduce you ...”

Of the two lieutenants, the one with the captain rank was Wu Jiasong, the instructor of the security company. The officer with the rank of first lieutenant was called Zhong Lin, the Deputy company commander of the automotive company.

Strictly speaking, the two of them were not official members of the lone wolf assault team, but officers of the logistics support team.

During the military reform, this security team had suffered the greatest impact, and the number of people who had been disbanded was the largest.

Although Wu Jiasong and Zhong Lin were not official members of lone wolf, since they were invited by Guo Zhan to have a meal with Xia ruofei, it meant that their abilities were recognized by Guo Zhan.

After Xia ruofei heard Guo Zhan’s introduction, he thought for a while and said,””The two of you are so young, I don’t think you’ve reached the age limit for choosing your own career, right?”

“I’ve served in the Army for ten years, while Zhong Lin has just served eight years,”Wu Jiasong nodded and said.

Ten years of being the principal and eight years of being the Deputy ... Xia ruofei was speechless. Even with the addition of the four years in the military school, the progress of these two was a little slow.

Guo Zhan said,”both of them studied in the military and went to Junior College. After graduation, they started as second lieutenants. So, although their positions are not high now, their military service is relatively long. Compared to other cadres of the same rank, they are a little older.”

Xia ruofei suddenly realized that most of the soldiers in the Kongtong Army were either first – Class soldiers or corporals, which meant that they had a few years of military service. In addition, the military school even had three years of Junior College, which also counted military service. After graduation, they had started working from the rank of commander. Now, they were deputy commander and commander commander. It was normal for one to have ten years of military service and the other to have eight years.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”since you can’t choose your own career, even if you want to change your career, you can also choose the method of placement!” At least you’ll have a career editor. It’s much more stable than going to my place!”

In Wu Jiasong and Zhong Lin’s case, if they didn’t want to work, they could only choose to be discharged as soldiers. Even if they regretted it in the future, the country would not arrange a job for them. It was a one – time deal, and there was no medicine for regret.

It was not easy for them to get into a military school when they were in the Army and successfully graduate to become an officer of the Republic. This could also be considered as a change in status, and they had the status of cadres. In the end, when he left the Army, he actually took the initiative to give up everything and go according to the veteran treatment. Didn’t that mean that all the efforts he had put in for the entrance examination and after that were in vain? everything would return to its original point?

After all, if they didn’t take the exam and stayed in the Army, they would be sergeants or staff Sergeant now. Even if they were to leave the Army, they would still be treated like soldiers. There was no difference from now.

If the economic accounts were calculated, the officers would be discharged from the Army and the money they received would be less than the soldiers who were directly discharged.

What were they after?

Guo Zhan looked at Wu Jiasong and Zhong Lin and said,”You guys tell me!”

Wu Jiasong smiled embarrassedly and said,””Actually, the reason isn’t that complicated. We’re still young, and we don’t want to live a life where we can see what we’ll be like when we retire on the first day of work. “Moreover, one of us is an Infantry Division commander, and the other is an automobile division commander. Such majors are of no use in other places. Zhong Lin’s is slightly better. At least he has some connection with the local major. What can I do when I go back? As a security guard Captain?”
