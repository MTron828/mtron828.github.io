Chapter 1930 I didn’t make it in time_1

Liu haojun’s reaction was very big. He pulled on the part of his face that had been injured, and it hurt so much that he sucked in a breath of cold air. However, he still got up from the bed and held on to Fang Chenchen tightly. “What’s going on?”

The doctor Who was stitching up a wounded patient on the next bed turned around and said in dissatisfaction,””Lower your voice! This is a hospital, do you think you’re in your own house?” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Shut up!” Liu haojun roared. It’s none of your business!”

“What’s wrong with you, patient?” The doctor was immediately indignant.”If you want to fight, go home!” I’ll call security if you keep doing this!”

Fang Chenchen quickly apologized,”I’m sorry!” I’m sorry! He’s not in a good mood, don’t take it to heart ...”

Liu haojun said impatiently,””Alright, alright! Hurry up and tell me! What’s with the reporter?”

“I don’t know either ...” Fang Chenchen said,”you ... You fainted not long after, and the reporters barged in. They even brought their cameras ...”

“Which unit are you from?” Liu haojun quickly asked,”hurry up and tell me!”

“Provincial ... Provincial station!” Fang Chenchen said,”I have some impression of that reporter. I think he’s from Haixi TV ...”

“My phone!”

“Ah?” Fang Chenchen did not react immediately.

“Give me the phone!” Liu haojun shouted,”where’s my phone? Hurry up!”

“I ... I didn’t take it!” Fang Chenchen panicked.”Maybe ... Maybe I left it at home!”

“You ...” Liu haojun was furious.”What else can you do?” Where’s your own phone?”

“Over here!” Fang Chenchen quickly took out her phone and handed it to Liu haojun.

Liu haojun only remembered the phone number of the driver, old Zhou, and immediately called him.

“Miss Fang, how are you?” Old Zhou said.

“It’s me!” Liu haojun said.

“Secretary Liu! Do you have any instructions?” Old Zhou said respectfully.

Liu haojun lowered his voice and said,”something happened ... Fang Chenchen’s husband is here with his men ...”

“What?” Old Zhou was shocked and quickly asked,”Secretary, are you injured?”

“Can I be fine?” Liu haojun said unhappily,”I’m at the hospital!”

“I’ll be there immediately!” Old Zhou said immediately.

“Don’t come over yet! Old Zhou, there’s an urgent matter!” Liu haojun said,”they even brought reporters with them today. I have to coordinate with them immediately. We can’t let this news be broadcast! But I left my phone at home. Send me uncle fan’s number immediately!”

“Okay, Secretary Liu!” Old Zhou quickly said.

He knew that it was an urgent matter, so he hung up the phone and found uncle fan’s number to send to Fang Chenchen’s phone.

After Liu haojun received the text message, he immediately called.””Uncle fan, I’m haojun ... Yes! I left my phone at home. There’s something I need to trouble you with today, and it’s quite urgent ...”

Then, Liu haojun didn’t dare to hide anything. He told them everything that happened today and said,””Uncle fan, that’s what happened. That reporter is probably from Haixi TV. I hope you can help to coordinate and remove this news ...”

In the provincial capital’s courtyard, a stern – looking old man hung up the phone. He revealed a bitter smile and shook his head repeatedly.

The young master of the Liu family really made people worry!

Before the new year, he was sent to the southeast province because of his lifestyle. By right, he should have learned from his mistakes. However, Liu haojun did not reflect on his actions. Instead, he became even worse because the Emperor was far away.

This time, she had actually gotten involved with a married woman, and was even caught red – handed by her husband, and was even photographed by reporters!

If the old leader were to know about this, he would probably be so angry that his heart would go crazy!

To be honest, fan Tianfeng was really sick of it. He didn’t even want to touch this kind of bullsh * t thing. Could he not care? No matter how good – for – nothing Liu haojun was, he was still the grandson of the old leader!

He sighed to himself, thought for a moment, and picked up the phone on the desk to make a call.

“Hello, is this comrade Xin tai? I’m fan Tianfeng!”

He was calling Zheng Xintai, the Deputy Director of Haixi satellite TV, who was in charge of the provincial station.

Zheng Xintai heard the familiar voice on the phone and quickly said respectfully,””Hello, Governor fan! Do you have any instructions?”

Fan Tianfeng was the Deputy Governor of the southeast province. He was ranked third in the provincial government team, second only to the executive Vice Governor. He was also one of the big shots of the provincial Party.

Although fan Tianfeng was not in charge of the publicity work, Zheng Xintai naturally did not dare to neglect his position and status.

“Xintai,” fan Tianfeng said affably,”I can’t really give you instructions. I have something I need your help with ...”

“Please tell me, Governor fan. I’ll do my best!” Zheng Xintai said.

Fan Tianfeng considered for a moment and said,””It’s like this, a female reporter from Haixi TV went to Xihu mansion today to interview about a family dispute. If possible, I hope that this news can be taken down and not broadcasted ...”

“No problem!” Zheng Xintai said without hesitation.

It was just an ordinary social news. It didn’t matter if it was published or not. The provincial government’s Big Boss personally called and his attitude was so gentle. How could Zheng Xintai refuse?

Fan Tianfeng smiled and said,”thank you, Mr. Xin tai ... By the way, I was asked by someone to do this. There’s nothing wrong with the news itself. Don’t blame the reporters who worked hard to interview. It’s best to persuade them. After all, it’s very tiring to go to the scene. If the news is collected but can’t be broadcasted, it’s easy to dampen their enthusiasm for work!”

“You’re too thoughtful!” Zheng Xintai said,”I will definitely carry out your instructions!”

“You, you!” Fan Tianfeng said,”I already said that it’s not an instruction. It’s just a personal request. Comrade Xin tai, there’s no time to waste. I won’t chat with you any longer!”

“Alright! Alright! “Goodbye, Governor fan ...” Zheng Xintai said.

After fan Tianfeng called Zheng Xintai, he called the director of the provincial Hospital and asked him to arrange the best doctor for Liu haojun’s consultation, as well as a better single Ward for him.

He was in charge of the medical and health field in Xuanji, so this kind of small matter was easy for him to handle.

……

Ten minutes later, Zheng Xintai, the Deputy station head of the provincial station, sat in his study with a worried look on his face.

As soon as he finished the call with fan Tianfeng, he did not dare to delay and immediately called Haixi TV.

Although the information provided by fan Tianfeng was vague, there was a key piece of information, and that was the West Lake Mansion community.

The probability of multiple news events happening in the same neighborhood at the same time was very low, so with this information point, it was easy to lock onto the news video.

But what Zheng Xintai didn’t expect was that his call was already late. The evening news program that ran ran was broadcasting was already broadcast about five minutes ago.

If it was just that, Zheng Xintai’s face wouldn’t be so ugly. After all, Haixi TV was not like xiangnan TV, which had a sky – High viewership rating. In addition, he also knew that when the news was broadcast, both parties were censored. The number of views for the first broadcast and how many people who saw the news would recognize the person in the video should not be a high number.

As long as he remembered to delete this part when he replayed it, there should not be a big problem.

However, what made Zheng Xintai depressed was that a while ago, the official Weibo of Haixi satellite TV had already pushed this news video.

Zheng Xintai took a look at the Weibo platform. The number of views on this Weibo post had already exceeded 100000. The number of views on Weibo was a little high, but the reposts and comments were real. The data of hundreds of reposts and comments made Zheng Xintai’s head hurt.

He quickly instructed Haixi satellite TV to delete the Weibo post immediately. At the same time, before replaying the evening news, they had to remove the news as well.

After that, Zheng Xintai could finally calm down and think about how to reply to fan Tianfeng.

Although he wasn’t responsible for this matter, it was already too late when fan Tianfeng called. But no matter what, this was the first time the big boss of the provincial government had asked him for help, and things had ended up like this. Even if he didn’t say it out loud, he would definitely have a lot of complaints about him in his heart.

Most of the time, the leaders didn’t care who was responsible. They were more concerned about the outcome of the matter.

Zheng Xintai thought hard, but he couldn’t think of any good way. He could only tell the truth.

He sighed and laughed bitterly in his heart.

He had thought that this was a great opportunity for him to get close to fan Tianfeng, but he had not expected that the opportunity had become a hot potato.

……

At the provincial Hospital.

Liu haojun, who had been transferred to a high – Class Ward in the orthopedics department, was anxiously waiting for news. Fang Chenchen was also sitting in front of the hospital bed in a daze.

Fang Chenchen missed her daughter Mengmeng and her husband, Liu Dong, very much. She regretted it so much. If she could turn back time, she would never have made such a choice. After losing it, she realized that the ordinary daily life was the original taste of life ...

Mr. Zhou was still on his way from Changping, and he had to go to the West Lake Mansion to get Liu haojun’s phone.

Therefore, Liu haojun could only use Fang Chenchen’s phone to contact the outside world.

In fact, he couldn’t remember the phone number in the mobile phone’s address book. Fortunately, he had made the most important call, so he wasn’t too worried. He felt that with fan Tianfeng’s help in coordinating the rest of the things, there shouldn’t be too much of a problem.

A melodious ringtone sounded. Liu haojun quickly picked up his phone and saw that it was fan Tianfeng’s number. He quickly answered the call.”Hello, uncle fan? How’s the matter?”

“Haojun, there’s a problem ...” Fan Tianfeng said with a heavy tone.

Liu haojun’s heart skipped a beat!
