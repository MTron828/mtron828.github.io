Chapter 477: One condition (1)

“Oh, I want to buy a piece of white jade, sheep – Fat white jade.” Xia ruofei said.

“Sheep – Fat white jade?” Lu You’s expression was a little strange, and she could not help but ask.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes, and it’s the highest quality sheep – Fat white jade without any impurities ...”

“You can’t buy it in a place like this,” Lu You said with a chuckle.”Unless you’re extremely lucky, you definitely won’t be able to buy it. If you find it, there’s a high chance that you’ve been cheated ...”

Xia ruofei replied gloomily,”yeah!” I’ve been wandering around for half a day and found nothing!”

Lu You glanced at Xia ruofei and asked,””Do you need any help?”

“You can help me buy it?” Xia ruofei quickly asked.

Lu You’s lips curled up slightly and she said,””I can try it on. Do you have any requirements for the size of the Jade?”

Xia ruofei immediately said,”the diameter should not be less than 10 centimeters, and the thickness should be more than one centimeter!” However, the quality must pass the standard, and there can’t be any impurities!”

After he finished speaking, Xia ruofei looked at Lu You with a glimmer of hope. If Lu You could help him buy the Jade he needed, then he wouldn’t have to trouble the MA family ...

Wait a minute! Xia ruofei thought of the MA family and realized something. Wasn’t Wanwan’s MA Zhiming Lu You’s uncle? She said that she could think of a way. Could it be that she was going to look for Ma Zhiming and Tian Huixin? After all, Hengfeng group started out in the jewelry business and had many channels to get the best Jade.

If they still needed the MA family’s help after going around in such a big circle ... Xia ruofei couldn’t help but hesitate. He couldn’t help but ask,””Lu You, you ... Through what channels are you planning to purchase the Jade?”

Lu You chuckled and said,”you don’t have to worry about that!” Why don’t you think about how you’ll thank me if I help you with this?”

Xia ruofei deliberately pouted and said,””Even if you don’t tell me, I can guess that you’re definitely going to ask your aunt for help, right?”

Lu You said,”I’m not that LOW!” What’s the point of asking my aunt for help? Besides, if you want to find them, can’t you find them yourself? Why are you trying your luck in this Jade Market?”

Actually, Lu You was very smart. She thought about it and knew that Xia ruofei definitely did not want to trouble the MA family again and again. That was why he came here to try his luck.

Although the MA family owed Xia ruofei a huge favor, Xia ruofei didn’t want to give people the impression that he was forcing them to return the favor. Of course, if he couldn’t think of a way, he would definitely go to the MA family to help him buy it. After all, the spiritual puppet was very important to him.

Hearing Lu You’s words, Xia ruofei was a little surprised.

He said,”you’re quite smart!” You can even think of this ... Good!”

Lu You’s eyes were smiling. She raised her chin slightly and revealed a smug expression.

Compared to the first time they met, Lu You no longer had the haughtiness of a proud daughter of heaven when she faced Xia ruofei. She also no longer had the coldness that kept people at arm’s length. She had more of a human aura around her, and Xia ruofei’s impression of her was immediately different.

In any case, it was much more pleasing to the eye than before.

Lu You smiled and said,”leave this to me!” It shouldn’t be a big problem. But ... How are you going to thank me?”

“You can state your conditions!” Xia ruofei said readily,”how about ... I treat you to a meal?”

“Tsk ... Nothing new!” Lu You pouted and said,”besides, you still owe me a meal!”

“Then you tell me! How do you want me to thank you?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

Lu You really tilted her head and thought about it seriously for a while. Then, she said,””I can’t think of anything at the moment. How about ... You owe me a condition? When I’ve thought about it, how about you help me with something?”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei agreed without a second thought.

This was not the first day he had known Lu You. He still trusted Lu You’s character.

Although this girl used to be a little arrogant and had a strange temper, she wasn’t a bad person in nature. Now that their relationship had completely eased, she definitely wouldn’t deliberately put forward difficult conditions to make things difficult for him.

Seeing that Xia ruofei had agreed, Lu You smiled happily and said,””Deal! I’ll help you find the Jade right now, you can go back and wait for my news!”

“Then I’ll leave it to you ...” Xia ruofei said.

Xia ruofei alighted from the car. Lu You smiled and waved at him, then drove away from the Jade Market.

Xia ruofei also found his pickup truck and drove back to Taoyuan farm. He was being followed for no reason today. Xia ruofei was still a little worried. Although Lei Hu and the others had the best military quality, he still had to go back to take charge.

Lu You drove in the direction of Sanshan University. Cheerful music was playing in the car, and she had a happy smile on her face as she hummed softly to the music.

Seeing Xia ruofei, especially when he had personally promised to owe her the first condition, Lu You’s mood was as bright as the sun. The traffic jam on the road could not affect her mood.

After the BMW MINI entered Sanshan University, Lu You drove directly to professor Tian’s Villa. Although Tian Huilan was the leader of the Provincial Party Committee and had a villa in the Provincial Party Committee District, Lu You spent most of her time either in the dormitory or at professor Tian’s house.
