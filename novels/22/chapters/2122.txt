2123 Tying the heart and keeping the person (2)

He did not expect Xia ruofei to be so forthright. Not only did he agree to it, but from now on, it would also be Xiao liuzi’s trial period. This made Cao tieshu pleasantly surprised, but he was also very touched. He knew that Xia ruofei had absolute trust in Him, and he also reminded himself that he must not betray Xia ruofei’s trust.

After sending Xia ruofei off, Cao tieshu walked to the side of the fence of the goose House.

The workers who helped had already returned to the vegetable greenhouse. Xiao Liu Zi was standing by the goose House and looking curiously at the Strasburg geese inside, as if he wanted to see how they were different from the geese raised in the countryside.

“Little six, come here!” Cao tieshu shouted.

Xiao liuzi quickly ran over and said,””Uncle tie Shu, you were looking for me?”

Cao tieshu cleared his throat and said,”Xiao Liu Zi, I just mentioned your matter to the boss ...”

“Did the boss agree to it?” Xiao liuzi asked nervously.

He had been unemployed at home for the past six months. When he had just graduated, he had worked in a nearby factory for a while, but it had nothing to do with his profession. Every day, he had to work on the production line. Because he was not skilled, his salary was low, and he soon wanted to quit. Later on, he would occasionally work part – time at home, but he basically didn’t have much income, so he was very concerned about this job.

Cao tieshu looked at Xiao liuzi and said,””With your uncle tie Shu taking action, how could the boss not give him face?”

“He’s agreed!” Xiao liuzi’s face was full of anticipation.

“En!” Cao tieshu nodded his head and said,”the boss said that this period of time will be considered your probation period. If you do well, you can become a regular employee. By then, the farm will have a large breeding farm and you will have to raise at least a few thousand geese. Then, you can start working at the farm!”

“That’s great! Thank you, uncle tie Shu!” Xiao liuzi was so happy that he almost jumped up.

“I’m not done yet!”Cao tieshu said. This child, you’re so impetuous! He had to change this bad habit! Otherwise, you won’t be able to do your job well!”

Cao tieshu was no longer the honest farmer he was before. Now, he had the dignity of a leader. His face turned serious, and Xiao liuzi quickly said,”I understand, uncle tie Shu!”

Cao tieshu nodded and said,””The boss said that during the probationary period, you’ll be paid 70% of the salary of a regular new employee on the farm.”

Xiao liuzi was stunned. He asked with his eyes wide open,””Ah? There’s also my salary!”

“What are you saying! You’re working here, can I not pay you?” Cao tieshu slightly raised his head and said,”does our boss look like someone who lacks money?”

“That’s right, that’s right ...” Xiao liuzi quickly smiled apologetically and then asked,”uncle tie Shu, then ... Seventy percent ... How much is that?”

Cao tieshu cleared his throat and said, “I’m not too sure about the exact standard, but ... It should be around 4000 Yuan!”

“So many!” Xiao liuzi immediately cried out,”uncle tie Shu, you’re not joking with me, are you?” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Cao tieshu’s eyes widened and he said,”When have I ever joked with you? Was 4,000 a lot? Which official worker on our farm has a lower salary than this? Xiao liuzi, I’m telling you, our company now has a tiered salary. The salary for new employees is low, and you only get 70%, so it’s only 4000 Yuan. You have to work hard, and you’ll get much more when you become a full – time employee! Furthermore, the year – end bonus would be a huge sum. In the future, when his salary was raised, he would get even more money! If you win the title of “outstanding employee,” your salary will be directly increased by one level!”

Xiao liuzi was fascinated and couldn’t help but ask,””Uncle tie Shu, then ... Then how much is your current salary?”

“I’m an old employee, so my salary is relatively high,” Cao tieshu said in a reserved manner.”I also have a management bonus. You don’t have to ask me how much it is. In any case, it’s not lower than the county head’s salary!”

The division leaders in San Shan only received about seven to eight thousand Yuan a month. However, civil servants received a spiritual civilization award at the end of the year. In addition to the high Housing Fund and car allowance, their actual annual income was about two hundred thousand Yuan.

As the person in charge of the farm, Cao tieshu’s income was indeed higher than that of the county Head.

Xiao liuzi couldn’t help but open his mouth wide when he heard this. To them, the county Head was a very high official. Cao tieshu, who was in charge of a farm, actually received more than the county Head. This was simply like a fantasy.

However, Xiao liuzi did not doubt Cao tieshu’s words. After all, a probationary intern was given more than 4000 Yuan. There was still a huge difference between an intern and a farm manager!

Cao tieshu said again,”Xiao liuzi, you have to do a good job!” If you don’t perform well and can’t become a permanent employee, you won’t just be embarrassing yourself. I recommended you and picked you up, so I’ll also be embarrassing you!”

Xiao liuzi quickly patted his chest and said,””Uncle tie Shu, don’t worry! I will definitely perform well! Just wait and see! I’ll move the things over today, and I’ll be living on the farm for the next two months!”

“That’s not necessary, we can just take turns to keep watch ...”Cao tieshu said with a smile.

“It’s fine, it’s fine! I’ll be idle at home, so I might as well do more!” Xiao liuzi said,”uncle tie Shu, you have to manage the entire farm, so you can’t keep an eye on this place all day long. If I stay here, I can share your burden!”

Cao tieshu nodded and said,”that’s fine!” By the way, the boss just told me some things to pay attention to when raising geese. Come with me, I’ll tell you ...”

“Alright ...” Xiao liuzi hurriedly followed Cao tieshu into the mobile home.

……

Xia ruofei didn’t know that his small decision had made Xiao liuzi so excited that he was completely devoted to the small farm.

In fact, he had never been stingy with his employees. As long as his employees were loyal and treated the company as their own career, he would not have to worry about them.

As for the extra manpower cost, it was nothing compared to the huge profits of the company.

Take the farm as an example, it was nothing to pay a few tens of thousands of Yuan a month. Perhaps a complete Strasburg foie gras was enough to pay the salary of several workers.

After Xia ruofei had arranged his work, he did not return to the city. Instead, he went to his bedroom in the small villa, locked the door and windows, and entered the spirit map space.

There were still a lot of materials from the last batch of materials for making the spiritual puppet. He finally had some free time today, so he planned to use this opportunity to process as many as possible.

In the afternoon, Xia ruofei did not leave the origin space. He only stopped to eat some fruits before continuing his work. While he was building the orchard, Xia ruofei had also planted a few fruit trees in the Archean realm. For such a long time, Xia Qing would harvest the fruits every time they ripened, so there were quite a few cherries and lychees in the origin space.

The fruits grown in the spirit map space tasted much better than the fruits in the orchard outside. It was truly a mouth – watering experience.

With Xia ruofei’s current cultivation, it was fine even if he did not eat a few meals. He just had to maintain a regular routine and eat a few fruits.

He worked for more than ten hours.

Xia ruofei felt a sense of achievement as he looked at the array runes and the materials that were polished into various shapes.

If he had the time to process some every day, he estimated that he would be able to process all the materials he could in two weeks at most.

The next step was to combine these materials.

Of course, Xia ruofei’s current cultivation was not enough to assemble a complete soul puppet. According to Xia Qing, it was mainly because his spiritual power cultivation was not enough. In the process of assembling, it was not a simple combination of materials. The most important thing was to fuse the array together seamlessly, which required a very high level of spiritual power.

Especially the core formation of the spiritual puppet. It was the most complicated formation that Xia ruofei had ever seen. He could not even process the few materials that made up the formation, let alone successfully assembling it.

Xia ruofei looked at the time. It was already one or twoo’ clock. He felt that his spiritual energy was getting depleted, so he stopped what he was doing.

Just as he was about to leave the medium and go to the outside world to rest, a white light flashed before his eyes. The White realm Fox suddenly appeared in front of him.
