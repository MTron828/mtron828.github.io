Chapter 500: Farm expansion (1)

The next morning, Xia ruofei was woken up by the ringing of his phone.

In a daze, he reached out and gently moved Ling Qingxue’s tender arm away. He reached for the phone on the bedside table and turned it off without even looking at it.

Xia ruofei couldn’t even remember how many rounds he had fought with Ling Qingxue last night. He only knew that when the two of them fell asleep, the sky was already bright outside.

Even Xia ruofei, who had a strong body, felt weak in his waist and knees.

Last night, Ling Qingxue had also changed her usual shyness when it came to sex and had taken the initiative to ask for more. The two of them had even tried all the movements that Ling Qingxue was too embarrassed to try in the past. At the craziest moment, Ling Qingxue had actually straddled Xia ruofei and moaned.

Last night’s madness could be seen.

Xia ruofei tilted his head to look at Ling Qingxue. She was still sound asleep, and there was a faint smile on her peaceful face. The trauma from the kidnapping incident had probably faded a lot after last night’s crazy night.

Xia ruofei reached out and hugged Ling Qingxue. He turned his body and placed his leg on Ling Qingxue’s shockingly elastic long legs. His hands naturally climbed onto Ling Qingxue’s proud body, and his body pressed against her soft and alluring body.

From the moment he hung up the phone to the moment he hugged Ling Qingxue, Xia ruofei was in a state of half – consciousness. After he switched to this comfortable position, he closed his eyes and prepared to continue sleeping.

However, at this time, the phone rang again.

This time, Xia ruofei’s sleepiness was completely chased away. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

He grumbled unhappily and grabbed the phone. Without looking at who was calling, he picked up the call and said in an unfriendly tone,””Hello?”

The person on the other end of the phone was stunned for a moment before asking,””Chairman, did I disturb your rest?”

When Xia ruofei heard that it was Feng Jing, he asked in a gentler tone,””Oh ... It’s President Feng! What’s the matter?”

Feng Jing was sitting in her office at the moment. She was speechless when she heard the news, but she smiled bitterly and said,””Chairman, aren’t we going to Dongkeng village to discuss the land lease today? I wonder when you have an appointment with the village?”

Xia ruofei smacked his forehead and looked embarrassed.

After the series of events from the previous night, coupled with the crazy time he had with Ling Qingxue, he had actually forgotten about this matter.

However, as the company’s chairman, he naturally couldn’t show his weakness in front of his subordinates, or he would lose face!

Hence, Xia ruofei quickly looked at the time on his wrist and said calmly,””Oh ... I have an appointment with director ruan at 10:30. It’s still early, so let’s meet downstairs at 10:00 sharp!”

“Okay, I won’t disturb you anymore, Chairman.” Feng Jing immediately hung up the phone.

In fact, Xia ruofei had not even asked ruan Fugui out yet. However, after attending the opening ceremony of the mixed – use complex and witnessing Xia ruofei’s strength, ruan Fugui had expressed his goodwill to Xia ruofei many times. Moreover, Wu Liqian had personally informed the town about this matter, so Xia ruofei was not worried that he would not be able to get an appointment.

Unless ruan Fugui happened to be away from home.

It shouldn’t be this small, right?

Xia ruofei thought to himself and didn’t dare to delay any further. After he finished talking to Feng Jing, he immediately called ruan Fugui.

He was quite lucky. Director ruan didn’t go anywhere today. She was in the village!

When he heard that Xia ruofei was coming over to discuss renting more land, ruan Fugui was very enthusiastic. He quickly said that he was at the village committee and was waiting for you.

Xia ruofei’s Taoyuan farm brought a lot of rent to the village every year and also provided a large number of jobs for the village. These were all achievements for ruan Fugui! It could be said that Xia ruofei was not even the village’s God of Wealth. Furthermore, Xia ruofei had such a good relationship with the county leaders, so ruan Fugui was naturally very concerned about Xia ruofei’s Affairs.

In fact, after hanging up the phone, ruan Fugui had been planning to do Xia ruofei a favor.

He gave Xia ruofei a discount on the rent. Besides, although the land around the farm was mostly barren, there were good and bad ones. As the village director, he knew the situation of the land like the back of his hand. He might even recommend some relatively fertile land to Xia ruofei when they met later.

Of course, Xia ruofei did not really care if the land was fertile or barren. With the secret weapon of the spirit map space, would he be afraid of barren land? Xia ruofei was more concerned about the planning of the entire farm.

This time, the land to be leased had to be connected to the farm, so that it would be more convenient for the centralized management of the farm.

After calling ruan Fugui, Xia ruofei naturally couldn’t go back to sleep. It was already past nineo’ clock. After washing up a little, it was time to set off for Dongkeng village.

Xia ruofei looked affectionately at Ling Qingxue, who was lying on the bed. Then, he quietly got up, got dressed, and went to the bathroom to wash up.

However, the ringing of the phone had obviously affected Ling Qingxue. When Xia ruofei came out of the bathroom, he saw that Ling Qingxue was already sitting on the bed and getting dressed.

When Ling Qingxue saw Xia ruofei, she could not help but recall the embarrassing scene of her taking the initiative to ask for his love last night. She could not help but feel her face heat up.

“RUO Fei, do you have something to do?” Ling Qingxue asked, blushing.
