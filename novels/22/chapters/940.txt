“Mr. Tang is here. This Chinese man is going to be in trouble!”

“Yamada Jiro is Mr. Tang Hu’s guest, and the two companies are about to have an in – depth cooperation. This Chinese man actually beat him up so badly and even used a gun. He’s too reckless ...”

“Haha, I have to admit that Chinese kid was really cool. But I’m looking forward to seeing him kneel and beg for mercy in front of Mr. Tang Hu!” Someone gloated.

“No matter how powerful an individual is, they can never go against power. Mr. Tang Hu is the true king of the underground world in New South Wales. Those who offend his friends will end up in a terrible state!” Someone echoed.

Lin Qiao, Liang Qichao, tan Lili, and the others were still worried when they saw Xia ruofei easily subduing Yamada Jiro, but they were relieved. At least the immediate crisis was over. However, when Tang Hu appeared, their hearts were in their throats again.

The happiest person in the crowd was none other than Brodie.

From the beginning, he looked down on Xia ruofei, to later on, he was worried about the strong background of Paradise Farm. From hoping to see Xia ruofei humiliated by Yamada Jiro, to seeing Xia ruofei easily control the situation with his own eyes, his mood went through several ups and downs.

When he saw Xia ruofei in the limelight, beating Brodie until he knelt and begged for mercy, Brodie felt all sorts of dissatisfaction.

Tang Hu’s appearance made Brody’s eyes light up. Although Xia ruofei still had a gun in his hand, he couldn’t help but shout in the crowd,””Hey! Chinese kid, aren’t you very good at fighting? Now that Mr. Tang Hu is here, why don’t you show us your best Chinese Kungfu!”

Some people who were gloating also laughed. Even Zheng Peng, who was hiding in the crowd, laughed with a trace of pleasure. This scene happened to be seen by tan Lili, and she despised this shameless scumbag to the bone. When she thought of how she had been so loyal to him and even satisfied his perverted requests in bed, tan Lili felt as disgusted as if she had eaten a fly.

Yamada Jiro also came back to his senses and quickly shouted with a smug look,””If you let me go now, maybe I can plead for you in front of Mr. Tang and give you a quick death! Otherwise, I swear I’ll make you die of pain!”

From Yamada Jiro’s point of view, no matter how reckless Xia ruofei was, he could only obediently surrender when he saw Tang Hu.

Unexpectedly, Xia ruofei’s answer to Yamada Jiro was so simple and brutal. He raised the hand holding the gun and smashed it down heavily. The handle of the gun hit Yamada Jiro’s shoulder. Everyone could clearly hear a crack. Yamada Jiro’s shoulder blade was broken.

Yamada Jiro let out a tragic wail and rolled on the ground in pain.

Tang Hu’s expression changed. He didn’t think that this Chinese youth would actually dare to disobey his orders, even seriously injuring Yamada Jiro after he shouted to stop him.

Tang Hu waved his hand, signaling his top fighters to step forward. At the same time, he pulled out his gun and pointed it at Xia ruofei without hesitation. He shouted,”Put down your guns immediately! Otherwise, I swear I’ll cut off your flesh piece by piece and feed it to the Eagles!”

At this moment, Tang Hu suddenly felt a gust of wind behind him, and then his butt was heavily kicked. Caught off guard, he suddenly fell forward, his gun also dropping a few meters away.

Tang Hu angrily turned his head, only to see Tang Yitian with the same angry face rushing over, aiming to hit him.

Tang Hu was immediately stupefied. He didn’t know why his most respected fifth uncle would suddenly go crazy. Only when the fists and feet hit his body did he cover his head to protect his vital parts while shouting,”Fifth uncle! Fifth uncle! Why did you hit me! I’m tang Hu ...”

The banquet hall was also deathly silent, even Tang Hu’s golden class fighters had stopped, somewhat bewildered at this strange scene.

Tang Yitian was famous in Australia. Almost everyone in the business world knew him. Everyone was surprised to see him at the reception today.

However, what made them even more dumbfounded was that Tang Yitian actually beat up his nephew and his right – hand man, Tang Hu, without saying anything.

It was as if everyone had been cast with a petrifying spell as they looked at the strange scene that was happening.

Tang Yitian cursed as he kicked him,”I’m beating you, you ungrateful thing!” Who gave you the guts to point a gun at Mr. Xia?”

Tang Yitian was just a few steps behind Tang Hu. When he reached the entrance of the banquet hall and saw that Xia ruofei was also present, he was surprised at first, but then he saw that Tang Hu had actually pulled out a gun and pointed it at Xia ruofei. This time, Tang Yitian almost lost his soul. A burst of hot blood rushed to his head, and without hesitation, he rushed up and kicked Tang Hu’s butt.

What kind of person was Xia ruofei? He was little Haoran’s Savior! Besides, the remaining hidden danger in little Haoran’s body was still waiting for Xia ruofei to get rid of! Tang Hu actually pulled out a gun and aimed at his family’s great benefactor, how could Tang Yitian not be shocked and angry?

What made Tang Yitian’s blood turn cold was that he now knew that Xia ruofei’s abilities were far beyond his imagination. It was very likely that he was one of the legendary mysterious men, and his abilities were even stronger than the Hong sect’s legendary li Jiuzhou.

How could such a person be threatened by a small gang leader with a gun?

The reason why Tang Yitian didn’t hold back his strength to punch and kick Tang Hu was because he cared about his family. He hoped that Xia ruofei would see that he had already punished Tang Hu, and that Tang Hu didn’t know about it beforehand, so he wouldn’t blame him.

Otherwise, in Tang Yitian’s eyes, Tang Hu’s life would be in danger.

Of course, this was just Tang Yitian’s own judgment. In fact, Xia ruofei wasn’t a person with a bad personality. He didn’t know much about cultivation, so he didn’t have the mentality to be above the common people.

Tang Yitian’s words were like a bomb exploding on the calm surface of a Lake. Everyone in the banquet hall felt that their brains weren’t enough to process it, because what had happened in such a short time was far beyond their imagination.

At first, they thought that Xia ruofei would be in big trouble since Tang Hu had personally arrived. In fact, the development of the matter was almost the same as what they had imagined. However, in the blink of an eye, the big boss of the Australian retail industry, Tang Yitian, actually came to the venue in person and beat up Tang Hu without saying a word. All of this was actually because Tang Hu had pulled out a gun against that Chinese kid.

This Chinese man even called Ethan ... Why did Tang value it so much? Was he really just the owner of a small winery? Many people couldn’t help but cast suspicious gazes at Brodie.

Brodie’s face was even paler, his heart sinking to the bottom.

Tang Hu also stared blankly, only after a long time did he say in a daze: “Mr ... Mr. Xia?”

At this moment, a happy child’s voice was heard.”Brother RUO Fei!”

Then little Haoran let go of Jennifer’s hand and ran to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei raised his head and saw little Haoran. His cold and emotionless face finally revealed a smile. At the same time, he waved his hand at Tang Yitian, indicating that he should stop hitting Tang Hu.

“Haoran!” Xia ruofei smiled as he squatted down and opened his arms.

Little Haoran immediately threw himself into Xia ruofei’s arms, and Xia ruofei carried him up easily.

Lin Qiao saw Jennifer and immediately greeted her with a smile.

She had already learned from the conversations of the people around her that tonight’s banquet was organized by the Mei ya group. Since Tang Yitian had come to the banquet hall in person, her worries naturally disappeared.

Tan Lili saw that Lin Qiao was so familiar with the superstar Jennifer. She also felt ashamed when she thought of how she had always shown off in front of Lin Qiao.

Liang Qichao’s eyes were wide open. He was just trying to introduce Xia ruofei to the person in charge of the area in Maya, but he didn’t expect Xia ruofei to be so close to Tang Yitian.

“Xia ruofei, you’re so good. You didn’t even tell me that you have such a big relationship. I’ve been doing useless things ...” Liang Qichao laughed and mumbled to himself.

Tang Yitian also walked quickly to Xia ruofei, followed by Tang Hu, who had been beaten up for no reason. Tang Hu’s face was still bruised. It seemed that Tang Yitian really didn’t hold back just now. Even if it was just for Xia ruofei to see, it was enough.

Tang Yitian looked at Xia ruofei with a trace of respect in his eyes. He even slightly bowed and said,””Mr. Xia, I didn’t teach you well. My nephew actually pointed a gun at you. I’m really ashamed ...”

Tang Yitian then glared at Tang Hu and said,”Hurry up and apologize to Mr. Xia!”

Even though Tang Hu didn’t know Xia ruofei’s background, seeing his formidable fifth uncle’s respectful attitude towards Xia ruofei, he naturally didn’t dare to neglect. He hurriedly lowered his head and said, “I’m sorry, Mr. Xia. I was blind to have offended you ...” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Xia ruofei glanced at Tang Hu and said indifferently,””Forget it, those who didn’t know can’t be punished!”

“Thank you, Mr. Xia, for your magnanimity ...” Tang Hu quickly said gratefully.

“Mr. Xia, you’re so open – minded that you don’t hold it against my nephew. I thank you on his behalf ...” Tang Yitian said.

Xia ruofei gave Tang Yitian a strange look. He felt that Tang Yitian’s attitude today was too respectful. Although Tang Yitian was also full of gratitude to Xia ruofei before, he seemed to be more respectful today.

However, Xia ruofei couldn’t be bothered to think too much about it. He just smiled and said,””I’m sorry! I’ve messed up your party ...”

“It’s fine, it’s fine!” Tang Yitian quickly said,”Mr. Xia, what’s going on with this Wei nation guy?”

Xia ruofei turned to tan Lili and said,””Tan Lili, please tell Mr. Tang what happened. He will seek justice for you!”
