2733 Trapped in the trapping array (1)

“Let’s go!” Qingfeng Luo said with a hint of excitement,”we’re going ashore from the west side of the island, right?”

Zheng Yongshou suppressed the excitement in his heart and said,””Yes, master! The place where I found that crystal was near the cliff on the west side of the island!”

Qingfeng Luo nodded.”There are indeed traces of an array set up by a cultivator. Although it has been a long time and the array has lost its effectiveness, it is still of great reference value for us to activate the array.”

After Qingfeng Luo finished speaking, he rode on his flying sword and brought Zheng Yongshou along with him. They drew an elegant arc above the sea and headed toward the cliff on the west side of the island.

He didn’t deliberately use his true Qi to form a protective shield, so the sea breeze made his clothes flutter. Standing on the flying sword, he had the style of a banished immortal, and he looked high – spirited.

The distance of a few hundred meters was covered in the blink of an eye, and in the next moment, Qingfeng Luo and Zheng Yongshou had already arrived at the edge of the cliff.

Luo Qingfeng jumped to the ground in a carefree manner and put away the flying sword with a thought.

At this moment, Xia ruofei had already transferred to the spirit map space. When the ray of light from the flying sword appeared on the surface of the sea, he immediately retracted his spiritual power and transferred it to the Archean realm. Time here was 30 times faster than the outside world. One minute in the outside world was 30 minutes in the Archean realm. This way, Xia ruofei could deal with any changes more easily.

It could be said that as long as he remained in the Archean realm, it was equivalent to his speed increasing by 30 times.

Xia ruofei immediately released a small wisp of spiritual energy. However, he had his spiritual energy locked on Zheng Yongshou and did not dare to directly observe Luo Qingfeng’s level of cultivation. He was very sensitive to the prying of spiritual energy. Even if he did not really detect Xia ruofei’s wisp of spiritual energy, he would still be subconsciously alert.

From Xia ruofei’s point of view, everything was slowed down by 30 times. However, he was very patient. He watched as Luo Qingfeng and Zheng Yongshou slowly approached Paradise Island like a slow – Motion replay in a movie. Finally, they slowly landed on the rock at the edge of the cliff.

Xia ruofei clenched his fists, and a hint of excitement flashed in his eyes. After planning for so long and spending so much effort, he had finally achieved the expected plan step by step.

The moment Luo Qingfeng set foot on the Paradise Island, Xia ruofei was 100% sure that he had entered the range of the array!

Xia ruofei did not hesitate. He extended his spiritual power to the cement room where the core of the array was located and reached into the core array board. He touched one of the spots and the array board immediately produced a strong suction force. It sucked out the spiritual Qi from the origin crystal and poured it into the array board.

The array patterns lit up in an instant. At that moment, the power of heaven and earth was also activated. The nine Jade pillars resonated in different directions. In a breath’s time, the Taixu xuanqing array was successfully activated ...

Qingfeng Luo, who was standing on a rock at the edge of the cliff, was looking at everything on the Peach Blossom Island with joy. His heart was filled with great happiness.

The natural formation on this Island had far exceeded his expectations. It was several levels higher than the star Seizer sect’s current sect – protecting formation. Such a cultivation paradise was of great significance to a sect.

With the Taixu xuanqing formation, over time, the star Seizer sect would be able to continuously nurture talents, and the overall strength of the sect would also take a huge step forward.

Just as Luo Qingfeng was thinking about the future of the star Seizer sect, he suddenly felt a gust of wind blow past him.

As a cultivator in the Golden core stage and having learned a lot about arrays, Qingfeng Luo was very sensitive to the changes in the power of heaven and earth. Generally, this situation would only appear when the array was activated. However, he had clearly felt a huge amount of power of heaven and earth being attracted in an instant. Although the process was very short, it did not escape his perception.

“What’s going on?” Luo Qingfeng said to himself.

However, he did not realize that his disciple had become Xia ruofei’s most loyal servant. He also did not expect that his disciple would lead him into a huge trap. Therefore, his guess was more about the natural array.

After all, after on – Site Investigation, the prototype of the natural array had already been formed and was in a very high state of completion. Moreover, there were many traces of cultivators activating the array on the island, so it could not be ruled out that the natural array had not completely failed and was only activated occasionally.

Just as Luo Qingfeng was carefully sensing the changes in the surrounding aura, a dense fog suddenly surged in from all directions.

Luo Qingfeng’s expression changed slightly, and he subconsciously made a defensive move. He took out a long sword from his storage ring and held it tightly in his hand.

At this time, Zheng Yongshou, who was very close to Luo Qingfeng, seemed to have fallen into a huge dilemma. He was clearly beside Luo Qingfeng, but it was as if he could not see anything. His face was filled with panic as he kept shouting,””Master! Master ... Where are you?”

Qingfeng Luo frowned slightly. With his rich experience, he could tell that Zheng Yongshou’s cultivation level was still relatively weak. After falling into the trap array, he was lost in the fog. Even if he was less than half a meter away from him, he could not see anything. All he could see was the fog.

Qingfeng Luo was also an array master, so he understood the situation very well and did not doubt Zheng Yongshou.

“Yongshou, I’m here! You stand there and don’t move. Don’t run around!” “Yongshou!” Qingfeng Luo shouted as he walked toward Zheng Yongshou.

It was as if Zheng Yongshou could not hear Luo Qingfeng’s voice at all. He was still shouting “master” with a trace of panic and kept walking around.

“Don’t move!” Luo Qingfeng quickly shouted.”Yongshou, don’t move!” The more you move, the deeper you’ll sink!” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Zheng Yongshou was still walking and shouting. Soon, he was getting further and further away from Luo Qingfeng, and finally disappeared into the fog. Even Luo Qingfeng, who had reached the spirit gathering realm, could not sense Zheng Yongshou’s existence.

Qingfeng Luo could not help but slap his thigh in frustration. He did not expect to be caught in the intermittent activation of an array as soon as he arrived on the island. At the same time, he also felt that Zheng Yongshou’s array Dao had been learned in vain. The first principle of being trapped in the fog array was not to walk around! But Zheng Yongshou, who was known as the king of formations among the younger generation of the star Seizer sect, was actually so clumsy when faced with this kind of trapping formation, just like a noob who had never learned formations before.

Of course, Luo Qingfeng did not panic. It was almost impossible to trap him with a trap array of this level. Since Zheng Yongshou had already been separated, he simply didn’t think about it, and instead began to think about how to break out of the array.

What Qingfeng Luo did not know was that after Zheng Yongshou entered the fog and left Qingfeng Luo’s range, he kept moving forward until he was sure that he had completely left Qingfeng Luo’s perception. Only then did he sit on the ground.

After two minutes, Xia ruofei appeared in front of Zheng Yongshou and said with a smile,”Well done! His acting is first – Class!”

“Master, you’re too kind!” Zheng Yongshou quickly said.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”You can rest here. I’ll go and meet you, my master!”
