Chapter 147: Chapter 144 – extremely arrogant (1)

After Xia ruofei finished his call, he sat in the ward and chatted with Cao tieshu and his wife. The two of them were still a little uneasy, so Xia ruofei kept trying to comfort them. After about 20 minutes, the sound of noisy footsteps could be heard from the corridor. Cao tieshu and his wife’s expressions suddenly changed, revealing an extremely worried expression. “Boss, it must be Chen Gang. You ... You should leave first!” Cao tieshu said. Xia ruofei’s expression was still calm. He smiled and said,””Old Cao, don’t be impatient. If he’s coming, then so be it. What’s there to be afraid of?” “Boss, I know you’re good at fighting, but they’re from the government. We can’t afford to offend them!” Cao tieshu anxiously said. If you call again, things will get out of hand. You’d better leave quickly!” At this moment, a resentful voice came from the door,””You want to leave now? It’s too late!” The person was Chen Gang. When Cao tieshu heard Chen Gang’s voice, his face immediately turned pale. He thought to himself, this is really bad. Boss is implicated. Chen Gang was standing at the door with a smug look, but his face was swollen like a pig’s head, and he looked ferocious. “Brat, you really didn’t run. You’ve got guts!” Chen Gang stared at Xia ruofei with hatred. At this time, two people in police uniforms came out from behind Chen Gang. They were two official police officers with police ranks and numbers, completely different from Chen Gang and the other Auxiliary Police officers. One of the police officers, who was tall and thin, looked at Xia ruofei and said,””We are from the criminal Police unit of the county Public Security Bureau. You are suspected of assaulting a police officer and causing trouble. Come with us!” Xia ruofei looked at the policeman calmly and said,””Everything needs evidence. The police can’t arrest people randomly. You said that I attacked the police and provoked trouble. Show me the evidence!” “Evidence?” the tall and thin police officer sneered. You beat up Chen Gang and the other policemen from the West City Police station. The witnesses are here, and the injuries on their bodies are the evidence!” “Those people are Auxiliary Police officers, not official police officers!” Xia ruofei immediately said. The young officer next to the tall and thin officer glared at him and said,””You think you can beat up the auxiliary Police as you please? You’ve eaten the heart of a bear and the guts of a leopard!” Xia ruofei glared at the young police officer coldly and said,””Watch your mouth. Wearing this uniform, you represent the image of the People’s Police. You curse and swear every time you open your mouth. Is this the quality of a police officer?” “F * ck ...” The young police officer rolled up his sleeves and was about to teach Xia ruofei a lesson. “Little Wu!” The tall and thin police officer reached out and stopped him. Then, the tall and thin police officer squinted at Xia ruofei and said,””I didn’t expect you to be so good at talking. But even if you have a glib tongue, you can’t cover up the fact that you beat up Chen Gang and his men. They were injured by you when they were performing official duties. We are summoning you on the grounds of stirring up trouble and assaulting a police officer, which is completely in line with the regulations.” The young police officer, little Wu, also sneered and said in a strange tone,””If you refuse to cooperate, then don’t blame us for not being polite! At that time, you’ll be charged with resisting arrest, and you’ll have to stay in the servant room for several years!” Xia ruofei pouted and said,”I didn’t expect the police to be so good at twisting the truth and turning black into white.” Chen Gang had obviously gathered the auxiliary Police to cause trouble for his family’s private affairs, but it became official business here. They were the ones who started the fight, and I was just defending myself. In your eyes, this is assault on a police officer!” The tall and thin police officer said with a fake smile,””The police will naturally investigate the truth. You’re suspected of assaulting a police officer and of causing trouble. I’m officially summoning you according to the procedure. You must cooperate!” The tall and thin police officer deliberately emphasized the word “suspected.” Xia ruofei snorted and said,”summon?” Alright! Show your police badges and your summons! I’ll definitely cooperate. ” Chen Gang’s round trip only took more than 20 minutes. It was still the first day of the new year. How could they have gotten an official summon? Xia ruofei was sure that these two police officers were Chen Gang’s bad friends. They were here to support him. To put it bluntly, they were doing private work without any formal procedures. Sure enough, the tall and thin police officer’s face darkened and said,””I’m calling you verbally! We’ll make up the relevant procedures after this! Now, please come with us!” “Oh! I forgot there’s a verbal summons!” Xia ruofei pretended to suddenly realize something and then asked with a confused expression,”but I remember that we can only summon verbally under special circumstances. Excuse me, officer, what kind of special situation am I in?” Xia ruofei looked at Chen Gang with disdain and said,””There are signs of escape? After they left, I still stayed here for more than 20 minutes. If I wanted to escape, I would have done so long ago!” “You sure talk a lot of nonsense!” The young police officer couldn’t help but curse,”if you don’t want to suffer, then come with us! Otherwise, you’ll be in for it when you’re in the police station!” “Are you threatening me?” Xia ruofei’s expression turned cold. “Fuck your mother! So what if I threaten you?” The young police officer cursed,”I’m going to hit you!” Then, the young policeman took out his rubber baton and smashed it on Xia ruofei’s head. This time, the thin and tall policeman did not stop the young policeman from teasing him. His patience had run out. In this small county, they rarely talked reason with “suspects.” Sometimes, even if they did not follow the procedures, they would just arrest them without anyone daring to say anything. Xia ruofei’s expression did not change. He just slightly turned his body and stretched out his hand, seemingly moving slowly. However, he avoided the baton and accurately grabbed the young policeman’s wrist. The young policeman suddenly felt as if he was being clamped by a pair of iron pincers. He tried to pull back a few times, but Xia ruofei did not move at all. Xia ruofei only used a little force, but the young policeman suddenly felt as if his wrist was going to split open. He could not help but scream in pain. The tall and thin police officer was on guard. He took a step back, pulled out his gun from his waist, and pointed it at Xia ruofei. He shouted,””Stop! Let go of little Wu immediately! You’re suspected of resisting arrest and assaulting a police officer. If you don’t let go, I’ll shoot!” Xia ruofei faced the black muzzle of the gun and his eyes suddenly became extremely sharp. His whole body released a cold murderous aura, and the temperature of the entire Ward seemed to have dropped by a lot. However, when he tilted his ears to listen, the aura on his body suddenly retracted. Xia ruofei’s hearing was far better than the people at the scene. Hence, when the police were unaware, he had already heard the footsteps and voices outside the inpatient department. Xia ruofei sneered and let go of his hand. The young policeman, Xiao Wu, immediately broke free from his control. Xiao Wu quickly stepped back. The tall and thin police officer was still pointing his gun at Xia ruofei as if he was facing a great enemy. He had heard from Chen Gang that the man in front of him was very skilled, so he had brought a gun. In fact, this was already illegal. “Little Wu, handcuff him!” The tall and thin man said. “Alright!” Lil Wu said with a smile. He massaged his red and swollen wrist, took out a pair of handcuffs from his waist, and walked towards Xia ruofei. He said,””Show me how awesome you can be! Fuck your mother!” Xia ruofei just looked at Lil Wu coldly. He did not resist and let him handcuff his hands. “Boss ...” Cao tieshu, who was at the side, said anxiously. Xia ruofei gave him a consoling smile, indicating for him not to panic. “Take him away!” The tall and thin police officer said proudly. He was very satisfied with the current outcome. So what if you’re good at fighting? I have a gun! If you dare to resist, I’ll shoot you. Even if you die, it’ll be in vain! Seeing that Xia ruofei was cuffed, Chen Gang also became cocky. He walked to Xia ruofei and pushed him, saying,””Run! Damn it, wasn’t he very impressive just now? I’ll see how awesome you can be when we get to the police station!” Xia ruofei sneered and walked out with his hands cuffed. Just then, a group of County cadres and hospital leaders surrounded Wu Liqian and walked to the door of the ward. When Wu Liqian saw the scene in front of her, her pretty face immediately showed an extremely angry expression. She angrily rebuked,””What are you guys doing? Why did you arrest him?” [PS] the monthly votes list has been hit in the ass again. I beg everyone to support me with monthly votes, gifts, recommendations ...
