When elonmask’s girlfriend, gramus, heard the doctor’s judgment, she couldn’t help but sob.

On the other hand, elonmask frowned slightly and said,””In other words, if the surgery and follow – up comprehensive treatment are carried out, the survival rate will not exceed 50%?”

“You can understand it that way.” Mannu said,”in fact, the survival rate indicators include the five – year survival rate, the ten – year survival rate, and so on. However, if little X’s illness reappears, I’m afraid ...”

After saying that, Mannu shrugged his shoulders and did not say anything else, but everyone already understood what he meant.

Elonmask’s face darkened as he fell into a dilemma.

After a long while, he raised his head and said,””Thank you, Dr. Mannu and the other experts, thank you. I think I still have to think about the treatment plan ...”

“Of course! This is very important. ” Mannu nodded and said,”I don’t mean to rush you, but I still have to remind you that you need to make a decision as soon as possible. The longer you delay, the worse it will be for your condition.”

“I know!” Elon Musk rubbed his hair and said,”you can stay here for now! I’ve already arranged a room for you. I need to discuss it with my girlfriend!”

“Alright!” Mannu stood up and said,”Mr. Masker, please inform me as soon as you make any decision! I’ll be at your command!”

Elon Musk nodded and asked the Butler to bring a few medical experts to the guest room to rest.

“What do we do now, Elrond?” Gramus was a little out of his wits.

Elonmask patted grams on the shoulder and said,””My dear, don’t worry too much. We can provide little X with the best medical facilities and the best pediatricians and onomogists in the world to diagnose him. He will definitely be fine. ”

“Dr. Mannu must have considered these factors,” Grims sobbed.”But his estimated survival rate is still so low, which means this disease is really difficult to cure ...”

How could Elon Musk not know about this? he just wanted to comfort his girlfriend, but in fact, he felt that he needed comfort very much.

“What do we do now, Elrond?” gramus asked. Do you need surgery?”

If the surgery failed, needless to say, they would not even be able to get off the operating table. Even if it was successful, there would be a series of problems that would follow, and any one of them could cost the child’s life. Even if they managed to overcome all those difficulties, the probability of a relapse would be extremely high.

In other words, it was very likely that he had suffered a lot of pain that even adults could not bear, and in the end, it was still difficult to keep his life.

If he did not undergo surgery and only went through conservative treatment, it might not be as painful, but it was obvious that his life was already on the line.

The so – called conservative treatment was, in fact, in many cases, just a form of deathbed care. It did not have any real treatment effect.

Elonmask sighed and said,””I’m indeed very conflicted. Little X is still so young. He shouldn’t have to suffer all this ...”

In fact, the moment elonmask heard that his child had a malignant tumor, he subconsciously thought of his first child.

At that time, the child was only ten weeks old. Like all fathers, he wanted to let the child take a short nap and then put the child on his shoulder.

However, when he went to see the child again, he realized that the child was no longer breathing.

Of course, the doctor’s final conclusion was that the child had died of sudden infant death, not because he had held the child in the wrong position, causing the child to suffocate. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

However, Elon Musk still felt great pain. He stayed in the hospital for three days and never talked about the death of his child again.

In fact, the sudden death of the child had been a huge blow to him.

As a result, all five of his children were conceived through test – Tube babies. In the depths of his heart, he believed that only science could ensure the absolute health of children.

Only this time, his girlfriend’s pregnancy was an accident. But since she already had a child, she had to keep it.

When the child was born, Elon Musk was a little nervous. Fortunately, the examination at the time showed that the child was very healthy, and he heaved a sigh of relief.

But the good times didn’t last long, and the nightmare still came.

This child, whom he had named “little X”, had not been able to escape his fate in the end. He had actually contracted such a serious illness and his life was in danger, as if he had been cursed.

The psychological shadow that was hidden in the depths of elonmask’s heart suddenly shrouded him again.

“Elrond! Elrond!” His girlfriend’s voice woke him up from his painful memories.

“Ah?” Elon Musk was a little confused.”I’m sorry, my dear. I was a little distracted ... What did you say?”

“Elrond, your phone is ringing ...” Said Grims.

It was only then that Elon Musk realized that not only was his phone ringing, but it was also vibrating, but he really didn’t notice it.

“Oh! Thank you!”

Elon Musk took out his phone and looked at the caller ID. He could not help but frown slightly.

The call was from Li Yifu.

According to normal procedures, if Li Yifu wanted to contact Elon Musk, he would have to ask his assistant or secretary to make an appointment with his Secretary.

However, the two of them were about the same in terms of family background. They were both very rich. The last time they met, the two of them had exchanged business cards out of courtesy, so Li Yifu had called directly through the private phone number of Elon Mask.
