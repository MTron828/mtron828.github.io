Chapter 1711: the great Tang!

Chen Xuan told Chen Nanfeng everything that they had talked about at Xia ruofei’s house.

On the other end of the phone, Chen Nanfeng was silent for a long time. Chen Xuan didn’t dare to rush him, so he waited patiently.

After a long while, Chen Nanfeng said,””I’ll make the arrangements. We’ll do as Xia ruofei said and set the location at the three mountains.”

“Alright!” Chen Xuan said.

Chen Nanfeng thought for a while and said,”Xuan ‘er, contact Xia ruofei. Tell him ... That he’s more familiar with the three mountains. Ask him if he can arrange the location.”

Chen Xuan was taken aback for a moment, but he immediately understood the signal his father was trying to send. He nodded his head and said,””I know, I’ll discuss it with him.”

“Also ... Tell him that the first heaven society won’t be sending anyone else to participate.” Chen Nanfeng said,”in any case, the two tokens are with you. As for soaring Flower Valley and surging waves sect, I’ll have them keep it simple and try to send only the sect leader with the token personally or an elder. Don’t make a big fuss.”

Chen Xuan knew that everything Chen Nanfeng did was to make Xia ruofei let down his guard.

He didn’t understand why Chen Nanfeng was so sure that with Xia ruofei’s participation, there would be a breakthrough in the research of the five Holy badges. He even had a faint feeling that although his father and Xia ruofei didn’t communicate directly, they seemed to have a silent understanding.

“Alright, I’ll pass on the message!” “Father, do you have any other orders?” Chen Xuan asked.

“There’s nothing else,”said Chen Nanfeng.” You can act according to the situation. Try not to get into a conflict with the soaring Flower Valley and the surging waves sect. Under the condition that it doesn’t affect the first heaven sect, try to protect Xia ruofei’s interests as much as possible. In short, show him as much goodwill as possible. ”

“Understood!” Chen Xuan said in a relaxed manner.

Although Chen Nanfeng did not clearly explain his reason for doing so, Chen Xuan could feel that Chen Nanfeng had no intention of being Xia ruofei’s enemy or coveting his treasures. Instead, he wanted to be on Xia ruofei’s good side.

This was in line with Chen Xuan’s original intentions.

This way, he would be able to avoid being caught in a dilemma.

“That’s right, Xuan ‘er!” Chen Nanfeng said,”since Xia ruofei has revealed her identity, your training in paradise Corporation should end first! You can stay at the three mountains for the time being. ”

In Chen Nanfeng’s eyes, Chen Xuan leaving the company was a gesture of goodwill to Xia ruofei.

To his surprise, Chen Xuan replied after a moment of hesitation,””Father, regarding the training, Xia ruofei and I have come to an agreement. I will continue working at paradise Corporation for a period of time to help his company complete a phase of work before leaving. Xia ruofei has agreed to it himself.”

Chen Nanfeng was slightly taken aback and asked in astonishment,””Is it a job in the secular world?”

“Yes, when I first joined the company, I took on a more important task.” Chen Xuan said,”if I were to leave suddenly, it might have a huge impact on my work. Besides, you also know that I’ve always been a man of my word. Even though it’s just an ordinary job in the secular world, I don’t want to give up halfway. I hope father can understand and agree with this decision of mine. ”

“If Xia ruofei doesn’t have any objections, I’ll agree,” Chen Nanfeng said after some thought.

“Thank you, Father!” Chen Xuan said happily.

After ending the call with Chen Nanfeng, the relaxed Chen Xuan wanted to contact Xia ruofei immediately. However, when he thought of Xia ruofei’s two beautiful Dao companions at dinner and the time now, he suppressed the thought.

Actually, Xia ruofei was struggling to stay in the guest room alone. He was not as happy as Chen Xuan had imagined.

……

The next morning, after Xia ruofei and the other two had breakfast in the villa, Ling Qingxue and Song Wei left the house. Ling Qingxue was instructed to send Song Wei home before going to work.

Although Xia ruofei was still worried about Chen Xuan, he did not want to go to the company so early. He decided to stay at home and make some tea so that he could go to the company later.

In truth, he knew that given Chen Xuan’s cultivation level, unless he were to be by Chen Xuan’s side 24/7, there was no way he would be able to prevent Chen Xuan from pulling any cheap tricks or causing any destruction.

However, whenever he thought about having a golden core expert writing code in his company, Xia ruofei would always feel a sense of fear. He would only be at ease if he went to the company to guard it.

Xia ruofei had just finished boiling the water and was pouring a small packet of wild tea from the spirit map space into the teapot when his phone rang.

Xia ruofei looked up and saw that it was the number that Chen Xuan had used for his training. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

He put down the tea bag, took the phone, and answered the call.

“Brother Xia, I hope I didn’t disturb your rest.” Chen Xuan asked.

Xia ruofei could tell that Chen Xuan was in a good mood. He smiled and said,””I woke up long ago! Brother Chen, did you encounter some happy event? You sound so happy. Did some lady in the company confess to you?”

“Brother Xia, please don’t joke around ...” Chen Xuan replied awkwardly.

“Hahaha! I was just guessing! “I know it’s not possible ...” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”with brother Chen’s family background, all the beautiful female cultivators in the world of cultivation are probably lining up to be your cultivation partner! How could brother Chen be interested in the young ladies in my company?”

“Brother Xia, I haven’t thought about finding a Dao companion for the time being. You’d better not make such a joke.” Chen Xuan smiled bitterly.”The reason I’m here today is because I have something to discuss with you!”

“Oh? I’m all ears!” Xia ruofei stopped laughing and said seriously.

“I’ll tell my father about brother Xia’s suggestion last night when I get home. ” Chen Xuan went straight to the point.”My father thinks that this is a good suggestion. It’s also a good idea to have the meeting place at the three mountains.”

Xia ruofei had already expected this outcome, so he was not surprised at all. He smiled and said,””This is a good thing! When the three of you are studying the five Holy badges, I’d like to join in on the fun and broaden my horizons. I wonder if that’s possible?”

“Of course we welcome you!” Chen Xuan replied hurriedly. It’s great that brother Xia is willing to give us some ideas!”

Chen Nanfeng had made all these arrangements to make it easier for Xia ruofei to participate. He also wanted to reduce Xia ruofei’s wariness as much as possible. What was the point if Xia ruofei did not participate? Hence, even if Xia ruofei did not ask, Chen Xuan would have taken the initiative to invite him.

However, Chen Xuan did not expect Xia ruofei to be so’ cooperative ‘.

“Oh right, brother Xia ...” Chen Xuan hurriedly added,”my father said that you’re more familiar with the area around the three mountains, so we have a presumptuous request. We hope that you can help us arrange the venue and some other security matters. We hope that you’ll be able to help us, brother Xia. I’m not sure if it’s too troublesome.”

Xia ruofei also gave Chen Nanfeng a thumbs up in his heart. He smiled and said,””No problem! I’ll make the arrangements. You just need to tell me how many people are coming in advance. Leave the rest to me. ”

“Thank you so much!” Chen Xuan hurriedly replied,”brother Xia, there shouldn’t be too many people. My father said that I’m the only representative from the first heaven sect. Furthermore, he’ll also ask the soaring Flower Valley and the surging waves sect to arrange as few people as possible. On one hand, it’s to keep a low profile, and on the other hand ... It’s also because he’s taking into account that the more people there are, the greater the strength. The research on the five Holy badges has been going on for many years, but there’s no progress at all. Therefore, this isn’t a problem that can be solved easily with more people. ”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile in satisfaction. He thought,”It seems that this Chen Nanfeng is quite sensible. He set the meeting place at San Shan, and I arranged the venue. He also tried to keep the number of people as low as possible. He’s worried that I’ll be scared ...

“I know.” Xia ruofei said,”you decide on the time first! This way, I can get someone to book a place in advance!”

“I’ll contact you again after I confirm the time. ” “Thank you, brother Xia!” Chen Xuan replied hurriedly.
