2976 One step ahead (2)

This was the complete content of the first volume!

Obtaining this cultivation method, in the future, all of the fallen leaf sect’s Qi layer disciples “spiritual power cultivation would welcome a rapid advancement.

This would be of great help to him in breaking through to the Golden core stage.

It would not be an exaggeration to say that the first volume of the “true glittering jewel technique” was enough to increase the strength of the fallen leaves sect by a large margin. Furthermore, the help it would provide for the development of the sect’s strength would be even more difficult to estimate.

Therefore, Shao Qingyang didn’t need to weigh the pros and cons. After a short moment of silence, he nodded and said,””Fellow Daoist Xia’s offer is very tempting, and it’s very difficult for me to refuse! I agree to it!”

Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng looked at each other, and a relaxed smile appeared on their faces.

On the auction stage, the auction was still continuing. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Now that the auction for this treasure had ended, another treasure appeared. According to the original plan, the second volume of the “glittering jewel true understanding” handwritten copy would be auctioned next.

Therefore, they still had plenty of time.

“Fellow Daoist Xia, sect master Luo,” said Shao Qingyang.”There’s still time. I still have a question to ask.”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Please speak, sect leader Shao.”

“What I’m most concerned about is how your sect is going to prove the authenticity of the” true understanding of glittering jewels,”” Shao Qingyang said.

Xia ruofei was slightly stunned. He smiled and asked,””Then how does the spirit Vulture mountain prove that there is no problem with their” the true glittering jewel Scripture “?”

“The lingjue mountain ‘s’ the glittering jewel true understanding ‘has already been tested in practice,” Shao Qingyang said.”It’s indeed of great help to Aurous core stage cultivators in comprehending the cultivation of mental power!”

“But how can we be sure that their copy of the” truth of the glittering jewel “is the same as the original?” Xia ruofei chuckled and asked,”what if they’re up to no good and make some mistakes at some key positions?”

Shao Qingyang didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”if the spirit Vulture mountain does that, their credibility will be completely broken. They’ll also become The Public Enemy of the cultivation world! No matter which force it is, the person who bid for this cultivation technique is naturally a cultivator in the Aurous core stage. They still have the most basic insight, and the Ling Jue mountain would never dare to risk universal condemnation by doing such a thing. ”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,””The spirit Vulture mountain won’t do this, and we naturally won’t either. Moreover, our cultivation method is right there, so the cultivator who won the bid for it can naturally make an objective judgment. ”

“I’m just afraid that the spirit Vulture mountain won’t agree to such an explanation,” Shao Qingyang said with a bitter smile.”They’ll definitely raise strong doubts.”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said with a smile,””It doesn’t matter. If the spirit Vulture mountain questions me, I can naturally come up with a convincing solution to make them speechless!”

Seeing this, Shao Qingyang could only helplessly say,””If that’s the case, then we’ll do as fellow Daoist Xia says!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Thank you, sect leader Shao. Do you have any other questions?”

“The core of the issue is the issue of authenticity,” Shao Qingyang shook his head and said,”it’s bound to cause controversy. Since fellow Daoist Xia already has a solution, the other problems are naturally insignificant!”

Xia ruofei said happily,”very good!” Sect leader Shao, I hope we can work well together! Then please arrange for the auction as soon as possible! I’m sure you’re already clear about the basic situation of the glittering jewel true understanding. Unlike the lingjue mountain, I’ve provided the complete contents of the first two volumes of this cultivation method. And the first volume of the glittering jewel manual is just right for Qi refining stage cultivators to learn. Combining the first and second volumes will naturally be much more helpful to Aurous core stage cultivators than comprehending the second volume alone. I hope that sect leader Shao will inform elder Hao of this and emphasize on it. ”

“No problem!” Shao Qingyang replied readily.

He then continued,”fellow Daoist Xia, according to the usual practice, the auction items of cultivation techniques are not handled by us in order to avoid suspicion. They will be kept by the deliveryman. After the auction is completed, both parties will hand it over directly. Is there any problem with this?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”of course, no problem!” I’ve already prepared the hand – written copies of the two martial arts manuals. As long as someone buys them, they can hand them over at any time! In addition, since we’ve promised sect leader Shao, then regardless of whether these two volumes of cultivation methods have a deal or not, I’ll let sect leader Shao see the contents of the first volume for an hour as soon as possible!”

Shao Qingyang’s face revealed a trace of joy, and he quickly said,””Alright! I’ll immediately inform Qing Song to add your sect’s item to the auction list! Fellow Daoist Xia, sect leader Luo, you can return to your room and wait for the auction to begin!”

Ever since Xia ruofei had entered the room, he had become the main person in the negotiation. Luo Qingfeng had been standing at the side without saying anything. Moreover, Shao Qingyang had always placed Xia ruofei before Luo Qingfeng in his words. It was obvious that he had already seen that Xia ruofei was the one who had the final say.

Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng cupped their hands at Shao Qingyang. Xia ruofei said,””Then I’ll leave it to you, sect leader Shao!”

After that, the two of them left the room and returned to room 20 through the passage at the back.

Back in the private room, Xia ruofei had just set up a few shielding barriers when he saw that the auction item had finally been settled after many rounds of competition.

This item was very powerful and had bought Xia ruofei and the others a lot of time.

According to the original order, it would be the lingjue mountain’s “glittering jewel true understanding” remnant volume’s turn to appear after the auction of the next item.

However, after the fallen leaf sect disciple took the item that had just been sold off, Hao Qingsong did not immediately arrange for another disciple to bring out a new item. Instead, he stood on the stage and listened attentively. It was obvious that someone was transmitting his voice to him.

A shocked expression appeared on Hao Qingsong’s face, but he quickly regained his calm, and even revealed a trace of excitement.

Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng knew that Shao Qingyang had probably informed Hao Qingsong of this sudden change. The reason why Hao Qingsong was so excited was obviously because he already knew that the fallen leaf sect might have the opportunity to obtain a volume of the “true understanding of the glittering jewel,” and it was the first volume that was suitable for Qi refining cultivators to practice.

Hao Qingsong took a deep breath and then said,”Fellow Daoists, the next item is extremely special. It would be of great help to everyone’s spiritual power cultivation! That’s right, I’m sure many fellow Daoists have already guessed that the auction will begin soon with the handwritten copy of the ‘glittering jewel Wonderland’!”

In room 15, Wu Ming and Luo Feng were slightly stunned.

“Did I remember it wrong?” Wu Ming asked. Our ‘the truth of glittering jewels’ should be in the next batch, right?”

Luo Feng slightly frowned and said,”Maybe the organizers changed the order at the last minute, but it doesn’t matter. The key is that the ‘the glittering jewel Wonderland’ must bring us enough spiritual stones. Otherwise, we’ll have to compete for the storage ring and buy that treasure at the same time. We’ll be short of spiritual stones!”

“Don’t worry, uncle Feng!”Wu Ming said casually. In today’s cultivation world, there were very few inheritances. Even if it was only a fragment of a cultivation technique like the “glittering jewel true understanding”, everyone would definitely go after it like a flock of birds. A conservative estimate would be that it could be sold for at least 50000 spirit stones! We didn’t use much of the spirit stones we brought from the sect, so it should be enough to auction for that treasure. These fifty thousand spirit stones are more than enough for me to compete for the storage ring!”

“I hope so!” Luo Feng nodded.

At this moment, Hao Qingsong’s words on the main auction stage made the two of them unable to help but freeze.

Hao Qingsong was currently introducing the “true linglang interpretation.” He just said,”The ‘the glittering jewel Wonderland’ that is being auctioned this time is a complete hand – written copy of the first and second volumes ...”
