Chapter 864: Lin Qiao’s troubles (2)

Translator: 549690339

Tian Huilan seemed to be in the mood to chat as well. She started to talk about song Qiming’s situation with Xia ruofei.

Strictly speaking, song Qiming was from the same village as elder song. However, everyone in the village was more or less related to each other. According to seniority, song Qiming should be calling elder song “granduncle.”

Song Qiming was actually a poor child. He had an elder brother who was more than ten years older than him. In the border war in 1979, his elder brother, who had just become a platoon leader, sacrificed himself in the war. In the same year, song Qiming’s parents were struck by lightning while they were working in the paddy field. They both died, and song Qiming became an orphan in an instant.

He was only nine years old then.

His brother was a war hero, and the government gave him a certain amount of subsidies. With the help of the simple villagers, song Qiming grew up with a family.

Elder song heard about song Qiming’s situation when he returned to his hometown to visit his relatives. Elder song was a soldier who loved his soldiers as if they were his own children. Naturally, he had a special kind of care for song Qiming, the younger brother of a martyr.

From then on, elder song started to sponsor song Qiming.

Elder song was responsible for song Qiming’s tuition and living expenses.

Song Qiming was also very hardworking. His academic results had always been among the best. In the end, he was admitted to the People’s University as the top student in the county and became a well – known scholar in all the villages.

After graduating from the People’s Congress, song Qiming was assigned to a province in the southwest and became a town Clerk.

Since then, he had been working in the southwest and had slowly climbed up to the position of a Deputy provincial leader. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Of course, this had something to do with elder song’s appreciation.

With Tian Huilan’s transfer, there was a vacancy in the southeast province, and song Qiming, who had enough experience, was naturally promoted.

Xia ruofei listened attentively. He had a deeper understanding of Secretary song.

When the car arrived at the entrance of Taoyuan farm, Tian Huilan did not mention Lu You anymore. Xia ruofei also heaved a sigh of relief.

Xia ruofei got out of the car. Tian Huilan rolled down the window and said to Xia ruofei,””Xiao Xia, I’ll probably be going to Beijing to take office tomorrow or the day after. I’ll take it as a farewell today!”

“Alright, I wish you all the best in your new post!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“I hope you can take care of Youyou,” Tian Huilan said with a smile. I’m most worried about this girl ...”

Xia ruofei looked a little embarrassed and said,””I will. Don’t worry, Secretary Tian. If Lu You needs anything, please let her find me at any time!”

Tian Huilan smiled and nodded, then slowly rolled up the window.

Xia ruofei stood beside the car until Tian Huilan’s Audi turned around and left. He waved his hand and watched the car leave Taoyuan farm before turning around and walking in.

Xia ruofei walked back to the villa.

On the way, he had many thoughts. Tian Huilan’s transfer was a little sudden, but it did not affect Xia ruofei much. Song Qiming, the new Secretary, could still be his strong backing.

Of course, most of the time, Xia ruofei didn’t need to rely on his official connections. The core competitiveness of his business was the spirit map space that he controlled. This was something that no other business could imitate.

When Xia ruofei returned to the villa, Lin Qiao and Hu Zi’s mother were still awake. The two of them were sitting on the sofa in the living room and seemed to be discussing something. It seemed like they had a heated argument.

When they saw Xia ruofei enter, Hu Zi’s mother immediately said,””RUO Fei is back? Come and persuade Qiao’ er. I don’t know what’s wrong with this girl, but she actually wants to apply for Sanshan University! With such a high score, isn’t it a waste to apply to a mere three mountains University?”

Xia ruofei could not help but look surprised.

It was not to say that Sanshan University was bad. In fact, Sanshan University was also a key university, and many of its majors were quite competitive in the country.

However, Lin Qiao had gotten such a high score this year, even when the test paper was more difficult and the overall score was low.

It was really a waste for her to apply to Sanshan University with such a score. She could have applied to a better school, or even a famous one.

Lin Qiao pouted and said,”what’s wrong with Sanshan University?” It was also a 985 high school! And it was close to home! I can still take care of you ...”

“I’m not that old yet, I don’t need you to take care of me!” Hu ‘er’s mother said unhappily.

In fact, Lin Qiao’s grades were usually in the middle. According to the ranking in the mock exam, her score was about enough to get into Sanshan University.

But wasn’t this because he had exceeded his usual performance in the college entrance examination? Now that she had scored more than 600 points, Hu Zi’s mother would naturally not be satisfied with San Shan University. Everyone had such a mentality.

Xia ruofei walked over and said,””Godmother, don’t worry. Is Qiao’ er filling in her application form?”

“Isn’t it? In the past few years, I’ve been filling in the application form as soon as I get the results!” Hu Zi’s mother said anxiously,”how can I not be anxious? This child is disobedient!”

Xia ruofei looked at Lin Qiao and asked,””Qiao’ er, what’s going on with you?”

Lin Qiao lowered her head and said!”It’s nothing.! I feel that Sanshan University is quite good. Besides, haven’t I been preparing to apply for it? This time’s college entrance exam score is higher, so I can just pick a better major!”

“But with your score, you can even get into Fudan University or Beijing Normal University, don’t you know?” Xia ruofei asked.

Hu Zi’s mother also chimed in,”that’s right!” You could have chosen one of the top 30 universities in the country. Why did you choose a university that isn’t even ranked 211?”

Lin Qiao wrinkled her nose and said,”mom, didn’t I just tell you?” I really just want to be closer to home. Besides, it’s pretty good for me to intern at brother ruofei’s company. If I go to college in Sanshan city, I can continue to intern. I can really learn a lot there!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”It’s close to home. I can do my internship ... How can this be a reason for me to choose a university?” You should be able to tell which is more important, right? Qiao’ er, if you want to learn something, you’ll have plenty of opportunities in the future. You only have one chance in your life to go to college, so you can’t be willful!”

On this issue, Xia ruofei firmly supported Hu Zi’s mother. He felt that Lin Qiao’s decision was a little irrational.

It was obvious that he had made the decision on the spur of the moment.

Lin Qiao’s eyes turned red and she said with a wronged expression,””Why are you all like this? I just can’t bear to leave my mother and you, brother ruofei! Brother ruofei, if I go to another place to study, my mom won’t have anyone to talk to. How lonely would that be?”

“I already said you don’t need to worry about this!” Hu ‘Zi’s mother said,”your task now is to choose the best and most suitable University for you and study well! Besides, how come I don’t even have anyone to talk to? Isn’t RUO Fei at the three mountains?”

Xia ruofei patted Lin Qiao’s head and said,””Qiao’ er, we’re not forcing you to make a choice that you don’t like, but your reason is indeed not very good. I believe that no matter what major you choose at Sanshan University, you will definitely be able to find the same major in other better universities. Obviously, it will be more competitive than Sanshan University!”

Lin Qiao lowered her head and didn’t speak.

Xia ruofei shot a look at Hu Zi’s mother, signaling her to keep quiet.

Then, he sat down beside Lin Qiao and said,””Qiao’ er, actually, I don’t want to be too far away from godmother, and I don’t have to choose Sanshan University. ”

Lin Qiao suddenly raised her head and asked,””What other schools are there? Sanshan University was the best in Sanshan city? Are you going to Southeast Normal University?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”why do you have to choose in Sanshan city?” Actually, I think that Heron Island University is not bad! It was a famous brand in the country, and it was only a few hundred kilometers away from Sanshan city. With the convenience of the bullet train, it could reach the destination in two hours. Basically, it could be a round trip on the same day! It’s no different from going to school in Sanshan city!”
