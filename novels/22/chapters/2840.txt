2841 An unintentional Willow (1)

The group of them chatted and laughed in the training base. Naturally, it was not convenient for Song Wei and Ling Qingxue to enter the team’s locker room. They strolled around the base while Xia ruofei and Wu Lei went to the locker room to change into their training uniforms.

Although Xia ruofei did not appear often in Dani Halk base, the first team’s locker room always had his own cabinet. In it hung the washed training clothes and the shoes were also neatly arranged so that he could take them out at any time.

The two of them quickly changed their clothes. Wu Lei tied his shoelaces and said,””Brother Xia, after the training ends, can you accompany me to the women’s ladder team?”

Although the Spanish clubs could only be regarded as a middle – lower level team in La Liga, their ladder team was still very robust and stronger than many of the giant clubs in China. Espanyol clubs not only had men’s football teams and reserves of all ages, but they also had women’s football teams, which also had players of all ages.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”what’s the situation?” Don’t tell me you’ve hooked up with a female girl? Kid, you have to control yourself! Xiaobei is such a good girl, you can’t do anything that will let her down!”

Wu Lei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”what are you thinking! It was a thirteen – year – old girl! I promised to give her a pair of sneakers!”

“Why did you give her a pair of sneakers out of the blue?” Xia ruofei asked curiously.

He was just joking just now. Wu Lei and his wife were very loving, and the two even had a pair of children. Their feelings were unbreakable. How could he really seduce the female football team? And even if there was something ambiguous, it couldn’t be with a 13 – year – old player!

“It’s a bit of a coincidence,”Wu Lei said with a smile.” This group of young players sometimes come to watch us train and ask us for autographs during breaks. A few days ago, this little girl asked me for her signature. After I signed it for her, she directly said ‘thank you’ to me in Chinese, which gave me a shock. Later, I chatted with her in Chinese and found that the little girl’s Chinese was quite good. She said that she had started Chinese lessons when she was five years old. I think we’re fated to meet, so I’ve prepared a small gift for her, a pair of assassin sneakers. Since you’re here today, brother Xia, I’d like to invite you to meet this little girl with me!”

Xia ruofei also raised his eyebrows and said,””Does this girl have Chinese blood?”

Wu Lei shook his head and said,”no, her parents are Spanish. They just like Chinese culture very much, so they sent her to learn Chinese when she was five years old. She still insists on attending Chinese classes.” It’s also because of this that I find it even more valuable. ”

“Interesting!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sure! I’ll go with you to see her after training!”

Wu Lei quickly changed into his shoes. He tidied up his training suit while waiting for Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat and he said,””Lei Zi, you go to the training ground first! I still have something to do, so I’ll go over later!”

“Alright!” Wu Lei nodded. Brother Xia, I’ll see you at the training ground!”

“En!”

After Wu Lei left, Xia ruofei took out his phone and played the video that he had taken at the entrance of the training base.

It was taken from the side when the Chinese students were asking for Wu Lei’s signature. Although the distance was not very close, Xia ruofei had zoomed in and his hands were very steady. It could be said that there was no shaking at all, so the shot was quite good.

Xia ruofei watched the video from the beginning to the end. He felt that Wu Lei’s refusal to sign on the national flag was very positive.

He pondered for a while and opened a video editing software on his phone. This software was definitely not as professional as the PR software on the computer, but it had no problem with simple editing and adding subtitles. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

When Wu Lei was taking a photo with the International students, he found Xia ruofei standing not far away. He called out “brother Xia” excitedly. This part was also recorded, but Xia ruofei used a software to edit it out.

Then, he added a few subtitles to the video of Wu Lei refusing to sign on the national flag. Because the scene was noisy and the phone’s audio recording effect was not particularly professional, that scene was the focus and core of the entire video. The subtitles were also the dialogue between Wu Lei and the fans, without any editing.

After editing the video, Xia ruofei clicked on the “generate video” button. Then, he took his phone and walked out of the changing room to meet up with Song Wei and Ling Qingxue.

The video was only 30 to 40 seconds long, so it was generated rather quickly. Xia ruofei had just seen Song Wei and Ling Qingxue near the changing room when his phone rang. The video had been generated.

Xia ruofei continued to walk towards Ling Qingxue and Song Wei while checking the effect of the video on his phone.

After confirming that there were no problems, Xia ruofei opened the Weibo app and used his own Weibo account to post the video. He added a short paragraph of text: #Wu Lei refuses to sign on the national flag #”you can’t sign on the national flag!” Give Wu Lei a like!

Wu Lei said that they could not sign the national flag.

The whole incident was shown in the video, so Xia ruofei did not describe it too much.

He clicked “publish” and the video entered the review stage.
