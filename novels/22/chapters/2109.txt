2110 The optimal solution_2

“By the way, do you have any ideas on the renovation?” Xia ruofei asked.

“I do have some ideas, but I’ve never studied design before. I don’t know if they’re unrealistic,” Feng Jing said with a smile.

“This is simple! I’ll ask uncle Liang to send their best interior designer over. You can describe your ideal interior design to him, the more detailed, the better. ” Xia ruofei said,”then, let the designer get the proposal. After you have a look, you can modify it according to your opinion!”

“En!” Feng Rao happily replied. This is good!”

Xia ruofei said,”I’ll give uncle Liang a call now. We have to hurry up. Otherwise, it’ll be hard to find workers if we delay it until the Spring Festival. It’s best to finish it before the festival!” After all, it will take some time for the house to be ready for living. ”

Even if the most environmentally friendly materials were used, the decoration would inevitably produce harmful gases such as formaldehyde. The only way was to strengthen ventilation and let it dry for a while.

After Xia ruofei finished speaking, he gave Liang Weimin a call and told him about the situation.

When Liang Weimin heard that the peach blossom company’s CEO Feng wanted to renovate the house, he immediately patted his chest and promised that he would hire the best designer and renovation workers to complete the project beautifully.

Xia ruofei expressed his gratitude and the two chatted for a while more before hanging up.

Xia ruofei put his phone in his pocket and smiled.””Sister che, we’ve already agreed on this. Tomorrow, the gold – medal designer from jianda group will come to the company to look for you. At that time, you can communicate with him in detail. If you have any ideas for the renovation, you can also think about them today.”

“Okay, I know!” Feng Jing nodded and said with a smile,”don’t just think about me! Although your house doesn’t need to be renovated, you still need to buy some daily necessities, right? We can’t just use the original bedsheets and blankets, can we?”

Ling Qingxue, who was standing at the side, said with a smile,”Sister che, leave these to me! I’ve already thought about it. I’ll throw away all the daily necessities and bedding in that house and buy new ones tomorrow!”

Feng Jing immediately realized that his girlfriend was here, so she didn’t need to care about these things! There was a slight sourness in her heart, but she concealed it very well and did not show it at all. She only smiled and nodded.”With Qingxue taking care of the house, RUO Fei doesn’t have to worry.”

“Let’s go! Come to my house for dinner!” Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”today, my dad came back to cook personally. You guys are in for a treat!”

“You guys can eat as a family!” Feng Rao quickly said. I’m not going ... I still have to think about the renovation!”

“Sister ran, let’s go together!” Ling Qingxue said. We’re not outsiders ...”

“No, no...” Feng Jing declined.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sister ran, uncle Ling is not an outsider. You’re very familiar with him. Besides, we’ll be neighbors in the future. We should see each other more often!” Let’s go together! Let’s go together!”

“Yeah, yeah!” Ling Qingxue said,”sister che, my dad rarely cooks personally these few years. It’s a pity to miss it ...”

Feng Rao couldn’t stand the two’s constant persuasion and finally nodded in agreement.

When Ling Xiaotian came back from the company and found out that Xia ruofei and Feng Rao had settled the transfer of the house, he was overjoyed. He put on his apron and went to the kitchen to prepare dinner.

Feng Rao was a little reserved in Ling Qingxue’s house. She didn’t know if it was because of her psychological factors, but she felt like she didn’t fit in.

Ling Xiaotian’s culinary skills were naturally unquestionable. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to develop a small restaurant into the restaurant chain it was today. One had to know that he didn’t hire these chefs back then. He was the one in charge.

Everyone enjoyed the meal. Under Ling Xiaotian’s persuasion, Xia ruofei also drank a lot of white wine.

Since Feng Jing was also here today, Xia ruofei could not possibly let a girl like Feng Jing go home by herself. Hence, he did not stay over at the Ling family villa.

Of course, Feng Jing was the one driving while Xia ruofei sat in the passenger’s seat.

……

For the next two days, Xia ruofei started to slack off again. He almost did not go to the company. He would only show up once in a while but would leave quickly.

On the other hand, Ling Qingxue had been shopping with Xia ruofei for the past two days. They had bought all the daily necessities in the jiangbin villa, changed all the beddings to new ones, and bought a lot of pots, bowls, ladles, and pans in the kitchen.

From now on, Xia ruofei could live in the villa and did not have to rush back to the farm every day.

Under Xia Qing’s careful cultivation, the second batch of test geese had also successfully matured.

Initially, Ling Qingxue had hoped that Xia ruofei would stay at the jiangbin villa tonight. That way, she would have more opportunities to cultivate with Xia ruofei. However, Xia ruofei thought that it would be more convenient for him to enter the realm if he stayed at the farm, so he found an excuse and said that he had to go back to the farm because he had some things to pack.

In the small farm villa, Xia Qing quickly brought the five new test geese over after Xia ruofei entered the spirit map space. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

With the previous experience, Xia ruofei was more familiar with the process this time. After a while, five foie gras were taken out and placed on the numbered trays.

When he was killing the Strasburg goose for the foie gras, Xia ruofei had already felt it. He weighed the foie gras in his hand and was clear about the approximate weight. It was obvious that it had been increased after the improvement.

After weighing and recording, Xia ruofei also kept each sample of the foie gras in a vacuum bag.

In terms of weight, texture, and other factors, the best solution had been chosen.

When Xia ruofei was in the medium, he had already done an in – depth analysis of the medicine and had optimized it to the theoretical limit.

Of course, whether the foie gras produced by the optimal plan could reach the standard or even the high quality in taste still needed further verification.

The next morning, Xia ruofei drove to a Western restaurant at the corner of the city.

Last night, he had already contacted the Western restaurant’s manager, Bastian, and said that he would bring some foie gras samples today to ask him to identify it. When Bastian heard that this might be a new product of paradise company, he was overjoyed and immediately agreed.

He already owed Xia ruofei a big favor. Furthermore, any Western food business owner would deliberately try to get on good terms with a supplier who had a large number of high – Quality truffles. Even if he had no interest in the goose liver of paradise Corporation, he would agree to help without hesitation.

The Western restaurant was not open in the morning, so Bastian had The French Chef of the restaurant wait with him in the restaurant early.

It was not even 8:30 am when Xia ruofei’s car arrived at the restaurant. Bastian personally stood at the entrance of the restaurant to welcome him.

Xia ruofei jumped out of the Knight XV off – Road vehicle with a thermal box in his hand.

“Mr. Xia, welcome, welcome!” Bastian said enthusiastically. Then, he looked at the thermal container in Xia ruofei’s hand and said with a burning gaze,”your company is launching a new product again? I’m really looking forward to it!”

“It’s just a preliminary idea,” Xia ruofei said humbly.”We still don’t know what quality our foie gras can reach!”

Bastian said,”the Paradise Corporation is already synonymous with high – Quality food ingredients. I have no doubt about that!” Mr. Xia, please come in!”

“Please!”

The two of them walked into the Western restaurant around the corner. Bastian led Xia ruofei directly to the kitchen where a Westerner with a tall white chef’s hat was preparing.

“Mr. Xia, let me introduce you to our Western restaurant’s French chef, Gore!” Bastian said,”Gore’s French foie gras is the best!”

Xia ruofei immediately said,”Mr. Gore!” I’ll have to trouble you this time!”

“You’re welcome, Mr. Xia,”Gore said with a smile. I have a deep impression of your company’s truffles! I believe that the foie gras you brought will not disappoint!”
