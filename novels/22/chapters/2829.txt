After the chief editor of Maca saw the video posted by Xia ruofei’s alternate account, he made the decision without any hesitation.””Immediately write an article! Attach this video and push it to the first important news on the website’s front page! At the same time, synchronize it to the APP and display it at the top!”

Although marca was a traditional media in the truest sense and mainly operated in the vertical field of football, after so many years of development, especially after the rise of the internet, they also followed the trend and withdrew from their own website. In recent years, they launched their own APP and began to involve other sports fields.

Compared to traditional newspapers, websites and apps had an unparalleled time advantage.

Newspapers were limited by their publication time. Even the daily newspapers could only publish one issue a day. If news that happened on the same day was missed, it could only be published in the next issue, which would completely lose the time limit of the news.

However, websites and apps were different. They could be updated in real time.

Therefore, although marca still had many loyal subscribers, more young fans were still used to getting news through the internet. A considerable part of their current user composition came from the internet, and many of them obtained the latest news through mobile apps.

Such explosive news naturally had to be published on websites and apps as soon as possible.

Fernandes quickly said,”understood!” I’ll get it done right away!”

As an editor on duty, he naturally had to personally write the article when he encountered this kind of breaking news material. Also, an editor on duty was usually a senior writer. Fernandes often went out to run the news in his early years. Reporters and editors were often in the same industry, so it was not difficult for him to write a press release like today.

“I’ll give you half an hour, can you finish it?”the chief editor asked.

Fernandes hesitated for a moment and said,””No problem! I promise to finish it on time!”

The editor – in – chief said,”the informant definitely didn’t just send this to our media company, so we have to hurry!” So as not to let his peers beat him to it. I believe that our old rival, as, has also received the news. So ... The first press release doesn’t have to be too comprehensive. Just briefly describe what happened, and then hang the video. That’s the key!”

“Understood!” Fernandes said.

“After the first draft is sent out, immediately write the second one. First, collect screenshots, videos, and other material related to this time. I’m worried that Pablo will immediately delete his Facebook post if he notices it, so we have to be quick!” The editor – in – chief was very experienced. He instructed,”the comprehensive draft must contain the ins and outs of the whole incident and string them together with a timeline. All the videos, screenshots, and other evidence must be attached, including the speech video of the Spanish manager, Ruby, at the press conference. It must be easy for the audience to see everyone’s performance in this incident!”

“Alright!” Fernandes quickly jotted down the information in his small notebook.

“Hurry up and get it done!” The chief editor said,”I’ll be in the office the whole time. Send me the draft directly to my email after you’re done!”

“Yes, chief editor!” Fernandes quickly jogged back to his desk with his laptop.

He immediately created a new Word document and began to write the manuscript.

Fernandes knew almost everything about the fountain incident. The editor – in – chief asked him to write the first draft as simple as possible, so he didn’t need to look up any information. He just wrote it quickly like a press release.

About 15 minutes later, fernández had finished a simple news article. He quickly checked the typos and corrected a few inaccurate words. Then, he saved the manuscript and sent it to the editor – in – chief via an internal email.

It took Fernandes twenty minutes to complete the task given by the editor – in – chief. He did not leave his desk but reported to the editor – in – chief directly on the phone, telling him that the manuscript had been sent. Then, he immediately began to prepare the material for the second article according to the chief editor’s instructions.

The second article was a comprehensive draft, which required a clear understanding of the timeline of the whole incident, as well as the remarks made by both sides in the past few days. The focus was naturally on the posts and videos posted by Pablo on Facebook, as well as the situation of the reposts by several media outlets that were close to Barca, such as sports daily.

Of course, it was also necessary for the Chinese netizens to spontaneously organize a group to challenge Facebook.

Fernandes kept taking screenshots and saving videos, nervously collecting all the material related to the fountain incident. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Before the work was completed, the editor – in – chief called. He had made some slight changes to the manuscript and sent it back to fernández’s email. He also asked him to publish it as soon as possible.

Fernandes quickly stopped what he was doing, opened his email, and downloaded the draft. Then, he opened the back end of his website and quickly pasted the draft that the editor – in – chief had edited.

Fernandes skillfully reformatted the video and then pasted the most important video into the manuscript editor at the back of the website.

Maca news’s website’s back – end had just been upgraded this year. It had more functions and was very convenient to operate. For example, Xia ruofei’s video was posted on Facebook. When the website reposted the video, they didn’t need to download it and upload it to the website server. They only needed to click on the video in the manuscript editor and paste the original video’s website address on it. After the video was posted, a video frame would be automatically generated and the Facebook address would be used to upload the video.
