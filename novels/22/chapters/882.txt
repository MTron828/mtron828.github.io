Seeing Guangzhi Cao’s sincere attitude, Xia ruofei nodded and said,””Brother Cao, it’s nothing much. I just wanted to remind you that your identity is a little sensitive now. You have to be more careful when interacting with others. Otherwise, it’s easy for the outside world to misunderstand you and it’s easy for you to have a bad impression of yourself ...”

Xia ruofei’s words were tactful, but Guangzhi Cao understood. He looked thoughtful and said,””Brother Xia, thank you for your reminder! Don’t worry, I’ll be careful in the future. I won’t have anything to do with people like yang Jianren ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””I’m just saying. Brother Cao, you just have to grasp it. ”

At this time, he Feng laughed and said,””Director Cao, Mr. Xia has really opened his heart to you! Otherwise, he wouldn’t have said these words. In my opinion, yang Jianren is a good – for – nothing who can’t do anything good. Nothing good will come out of being related to him!”

He Feng had already fallen out with yang Jianren just now, so he didn’t have much scruples when he spoke.

Although the people in the officialdom were particular about being smooth and smooth, and being stable, they also paid attention to decisiveness in killing. Since he had already offended yang Jianren, he Feng didn’t expect to repair their relationship. He knew very well that yang Jianren was a very narrow – minded person, and it could be said that he would seek revenge for the smallest grievance.

Instead of humiliating himself and currying favor with yang Jianren, it was better to seize the opportunity in front of him. If he could really rely on Secretary song, not to mention yang Jianren, even yang Jinsheng himself would have to think twice if he wanted to touch him.

“That’s true, that’s true. ” Guangzhi Cao nodded and said,”thank you, brother Xia.”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Brother Cao, don’t be so good. You still have a long way to go!” We’ll have more opportunities to communicate. ”

At this moment, President Zheng knocked on the door and walked in. He personally led two waitresses to serve the dishes.

The clubhouse was not as busy in the afternoon as it was in the evening. With President Zheng personally supervising the kitchen, the efficiency of the entire kitchen was maximized. Furthermore, the dishes in the moonlight private room at lotus pond were prepared first, so it didn’t take long for the dishes and wine to be served like running water.

President Zheng didn’t serve the dishes according to he Feng’s menu. Instead, he made some changes. It was rare for Xia ruofei to visit the clubhouse, so he had to spend more time on the dishes to satisfy Xia ruofei.

All the signature dishes of the West River Moon Club were ordered, and President Zheng even ordered many dishes that used Taoyuan vegetables as ingredients. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

A box of the three – month – old quality Drunken Eight Immortals was also brought in.

Xia ruofei smiled and invited he Feng and Cao Guangzhi to the Round Table. The waiters opened Drunken Eight Immortals, while President Zheng personally poured wine for the three of them.

This made the waiters secretly speechless. President Zheng was not an ordinary restaurant owner. The people who entered and left the West River Moon Club were all people of status, but they had never seen President Zheng entertain guests so attentively.

When some of the higher – ups came to visit, President Zheng would at most go over to give them a toast. It was the first time he had directly gone down to greet the waiters.

Therefore, those beautiful female waiters also secretly reminded themselves to serve the distinguished guests well and not neglect them.

Under Xia ruofei’s suggestion, the three of them raised their glasses and drank a cup of wine in the midst of the rich aroma of wine. Then, they began to taste the cooking of the chef from Xi Jiang Yue.

The three of them drank and chatted, and the atmosphere was very harmonious.

……

It was a joyous occasion in the moonlight lotus pond private room, but the other group of people’s atmosphere was more depressing.

Yang Jianren’s face had been gloomy ever since he left the Lotus pond Moonlight Box. He didn’t have the mood to stay for dinner at all. He left the club with a few followers and drove away.

Along the way, he Dong carefully sat in the last row of the business car, guiltily paying attention to yang Jianren’s expression.

Yang Jianren, on the other hand, sat in the car without saying a word. His face was as black as a pot.

Soon, the car returned to his Mountain Villa in the northern suburbs.

Yang Jianren got out of the car with a cold face and quickly walked into the villa.

He Dong and the rest naturally did not dare to speak, and hurriedly followed closely inside.

After entering the villa, he Dong took two quick steps and explained with a smile,””Young master yang, I really don’t know that Xia ...”

He Dong was only halfway through his sentence when yang Jianren suddenly stopped in his tracks, turned around, and gave him a vicious kick.

Yang Jianren’s body had long been hollowed out by wine and women, and the speed of his kick wasn’t fast, but he Dong didn’t dare to Dodge at all, and could only watch helplessly as this kick landed on his stomach.

“Wu ...” He Dong let out a muffled groan and fell to the ground, clutching his stomach. His face had also turned pale.

Although yang Jianren’s body was a little weak, his kick was still very powerful since it was so close and full of anger.

He Dong felt as if his stomach was being twisted by a knife. His stomach was also churning like rivers and seas, and he almost vomited on the spot.

Yang Jianren stood there and stared coldly into he Dong’s eyes.””You’re quite bold, to actually dare to play with me ...”

Earlier at the West River Moon Club, if he Dong had not ‘reminded’ him in time that Xia ruofei was just a vegetable farmer who opened a small farm in the suburbs, he would not have been so unscrupulous in mocking Xia ruofei.

This way, even if there was some unhappiness between the two sides, it would not be as irredeemable as it was now.

Yang Jianren had long hated he Dong to the core, and he wished he could throw him into Min River to feed the fish.

Yang Jianren didn’t say a word along the way, but the anger in his heart kept building up.

After entering the villa, he Dong came to explain with a thick face, and yang Jianren’s anger finally exploded.

He Dong clutched his stomach and said pitifully,””I’m innocent, young master yang! I wouldn’t dare to lie to you ... I really didn’t expect that kid to be so close to chief Cao ... I ... When I was working at Ling’s F & B, he was really just a vegetable farmer with a small farm ...”

Yang Jianren’s anger grew when he heard the word “farmer.”

In the Lotus pond under the moonlight, yang Jianren had mocked Xia ruofei more than once for being a “vegetable farmer”, but what was the end result? Even Secretary song’s Secretary, the most popular official in the three mountains, Guangzhi Cao, had to be polite to him.

Not only had he offended such a powerful person and played the role of a funny clown, but he might also cause his father a lot of trouble. Thinking of this, yang Jianren was even more furious.

He kicked he Dong’s chest heavily again, completely kicking him to the ground.

Then, yang Jianren took two steps forward and stomped hard on he Dong’s face. The bottom of his rough leather shoes rubbed heavily against he Dong’s fair and clean face.

Yang Jianren’s veins were bulging as he stared at he Dong, who was lying on the ground like a dead dog, and said in a sinister tone,””Grandson! Because of what you said, not only did I offend master Xia, but I also angered director Cao. Tell me, how should I ‘thank’ you?”

He Dong’s soul was at its wits ‘end, and he repeatedly begged,””Young master yang, please spare me, young master yang, please spare me ...”

He was so regretful that his intestines were turning green. He felt that Xia ruofei was his nemesis. Nothing good ever happened to him.

Last time, he had lost his job. This time, he was even more unlucky and might even lose his life.

Yang Jianren’s other followers were also scared pale, and they stood aside timidly, not daring to speak.

There were also a few burly Men in Black in the villa’s Hall, all standing next to yang Jianren with their arms crossed, staring at he Dong like tigers watching their prey.

Yang Jianren snorted and retracted his foot. He said indifferently,”Beat him up hard, just leave him with one breath ...”

After saying that, yang Jianren turned around, walked to the real leather sofa in the living room, and sat down. His hands were spread out on the back of the sofa, and he was half – lying with his legs crossed as he coldly looked at he Dong.

A few Men in Black immediately surrounded him.

He Dong repeatedly begged for mercy,”young master yang, please let me go!” I know I was wrong ...”

The eyes of those few black – clothed men didn’t have the slightest bit of emotion, and one of them grabbed he Dong’s collar and lifted him up before fiercely punching he Dong’s face.

Following that, the burly men swarmed up and started punching and kicking he Dong. Muffled plopping sounds and he Dong’s agonized cries rang out one after another ...
