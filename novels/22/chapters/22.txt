Chapter 23: Instant Effect

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Lin Qiao came over with a glass of water for Xia Ruofei. When she saw Xia Ruofei take out a mineral water bottle, she couldn’t help but ask curiously.

“Brother Ruofei, is this Chinese medicine?”

Xia Ruofei smiled and said.

“Something like that! Qiao’er, go get a cup. Hurry!”

Lin Qiao hurriedly found a small glass and came out. It was the kind of glass meant for drinking beer.

She cleaned the cup and heated it with boiling water before handing it to Xia Ruofei.

Xia Ruofei unscrewed the cap of the mineral water bottle and poured out a cup of diluted petal solution. He said to Hu Zi’s mother.

“Auntie… quickly drink the medicine…”

Hu Zi’s mother actually did not have any hope in her heart. She knew very well that if she did not have a kidney transplant, her illness would worsen day by day. It was impossible for there to be any remedies to treat it.

However, Xia Ruofei had come all the way to deliver the medicine, so she could not brush off his good intentions. Hence, she nodded with difficulty and said weakly.

“Thank you… Ruofei, you’re so thoughtful!”

“Auntie! Hu Zi and I have a life-and-death relationship. Stop being polite and quickly drink your medicine!” Xia Ruofei said.

Then he went forward and supported Hu Zi’s mother’s back with one hand. With the other hand, he held a cup and carefully fed a cup of petal solution to Hu Zi’s mother.

After feeding Hu Zi’s mother three cups of petal solution in a row, Xia Ruofei felt slightly more at ease.

He couldn’t take his eyes off Hu Zi’s mother.

At the side, Lin Qiao said in amusement.

“Brother Ruofei! My mother just finished drinking the medicine. Even if it’s the right medicine, it can’t be effective so quickly…”

Xia Ruofei smiled and did not refute Lin Qiao’s words.

Hu Zi’s mother, however, looked puzzled. She said.

“Qiao’er, this… this medicine seems to be really effective! I feel much better than before…”

“Ah? No way! It really worked so quickly?” Lin Qiao’s eyes widened in shock.

While Lin Qiao was making a fuss, Xia Ruofei had already carefully observed Hu Zi’s mother’s condition. After drinking the petal solution, he realized that her face had clearly begun to turn red, and her edema was slowly fading.

Seeing this, Xia Ruofei was finally relieved.

“Ruofei, Qiao’er, I think my stomach feels warm. I feel much stronger and less uncomfortable!” Hu Zi’s mother said.

She was obviously talking with a lot more energy.

Lin Qiao also realized that her mother’s face was starting to turn red and she was clearly more energetic. She was only surprised at first, but then her face turned pale and her eyes turned red.

She tugged at Xia Ruofei’s sleeve and gestured for him to go out and talk. Seeing that Xia Ruofei did not react, she simply pulled Xia Ruofei’s hand and walked out.

Xia Ruofei originally wanted to observe Hu Zi’s mother’s condition again, but he did not expect Lin Qiao to pull him out. He could only follow her out of the house in confusion.

As soon as he went out, Xia Ruofei saw that Lin Qiao’s eyes were red and tears were about to flow. He hurriedly asked.

“Qiao’er, what’s wrong?”

“Brother Ruofei… my… my mother’s situation doesn’t seem right!” Lin Qiao choked. “She… she can’t be…”

“What is it?” Xia Ruofei said in confusion. “I think she’s doing great! The medicine is obviously taking effect!”

Lin Qiao said anxiously.

“It’s not that! I… I’ve heard people say that… patients suddenly become spirited before… before they die. Then…”

Xia Ruofei could not help but laugh.

“You mean the last radiance of the setting sun?”

Lin Qiao’s face turned even paler and she said with a crying voice.

“Even you think so?”

Xia Ruofei couldn’t help but pat Lin Qiao’s head gently and say.

“Girl, what are you thinking about all day long? You are even talking about the last radiance… Auntie is clearly fine, don’t curse her!”

“It’s really not?” Lin Qiao’s eyes revealed a trace of hope.

“If I say it’s not, then it isn’t! Don’t you trust Brother Ruofei?” Xia Ruofei said. “Please have some confidence in the medicine I brought, okay…”

Then from inside the house came the voice of Hu Zi’s mother.

“Qiao’er, what are you talking about with Brother Ruofei? Come in and get me a glass of water!”

When Lin Qiao heard her mother’s voice that was full of energy and since Xia Ruofei had already guaranteed it, she smiled through her tears. She stuck out her tongue playfully at Xia Ruofei and replied loudly.

“Coming!”

With that, she skipped happily into the house to get water for her mother.

Xia Ruofei looked at Lin Qiao’s youthful back and could not help but laugh.

When he returned to the house, he saw Hu Zi’s mother sitting by the bed, gulping down water.

When she saw Xia Ruofei enter, she handed the cup to Lin Qiao and asked.

“Ruofei! What medicine did you bring? The effect is too good…”

Xia Ruofei smiled and said.

“Auntie, it’s a good thing that it’s effective! I’ll send you more after you finish this bottle of medicine. You have to drink three glasses every day, one in the morning, one in the afternoon, and one in the evening. It won’t be long before you completely recover.”

In the past, Hu Zi’s mother would never have dared to think about treating her illness without a kidney transplant. However, after drinking the medicine that Xia Ruofei had brought, she inexplicably felt confident. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Because the effect of this medicine was really too good.

Hu Zi’s mother smiled and nodded. At this moment, Lin Qiao finally believed that her mother’s condition had improved greatly because she had taken the medicine brought by Xia Ruofei. She looked at Xia Ruofei gratefully.

Then, Lin Qiao thought of Zhong Qiang and her expression changed slightly.

“Brother Ruofei, there’s nothing else here. You should leave quickly!”

Hu Zi’s mother could not help chiding her.

“Qiao’er, why are you so rude? Brother Ruofei came all the way here to deliver medicine to me. He didn’t even drink any hot water, yet why are you chasing him away?”

Lin Qiao was so anxious that her face turned red.

“Mom, you’ve misunderstood. It’s not that I want to chase Brother Ruofei away. It’s… Aiya, I’m dying of anxiety. Brother Ruofei, if you don’t leave now, it’ll be too late…”

Hu Zi’s mother was even more confused. She was about to ask when an arrogant voice came from outside the door.

“Leave? Where to? No one in Little Island Village can leave after hitting me!”

“It’s Zhong Qiang!” Hu Zi’s mother’s expression changed drastically. She asked, “Ruofei, did you have a conflict with Zhong Qiang?”

“They were pestering Qiao’er at the entrance of the village. I casually taught him a lesson,” Xia Ruofei said nonchalantly with a faint smile on his lips. It was obvious that he did not take Zhong Qiang seriously.

Hu Zi’s mother immediately struggled out of bed and said.

“Ruofei, I… I’ll go talk to him. After all, I’m his elder…”

Xia Ruofei hurriedly stopped Hu Zi’s mother and said.

“Auntie, you’re still very weak. You mustn’t get out of bed.”

With that, Xia Ruofei looked at Lin Qiao and said.

“Qiao’er, take good care of Auntie!”

Lin Qiao nodded, then looked at the door worriedly and said.

“But…”

At this moment, Zhong Qiang was still clamoring outside the door.

“Kid, weren’t you very arrogant just now? Why are you hiding like a tortoise now? If you don’t get out, I’ll kick the door open! Haha, don’t tell me you’re having a threesome with the mother and daughter…”

“Then this kid is in trouble. After being frightened by Brother Qiang, he’ll probably have become impotent in the future. Hahahaha…” The hooligans brought by Zhong Qiang also joined in the teasing.

A cold glint flashed across Xia Ruofei’s eyes, but he quickly restrained it. When he looked at Lin Qiao, his gaze became gentle again.

“It’s fine. They’re just a few small fry. I’ll go out and send them away…”

With that, he walked out the door.

Lin Qiao also wanted to follow, but she was stopped by Xia Ruofei’s gaze. She looked at Xia Ruofei’s back as he walked out unhurriedly. At this moment, that back seemed to have become very tall and lofty. The fear and uneasiness in her heart disappeared in an instant.
