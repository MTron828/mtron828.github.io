2988 The last bit of stubbornness (1)

After hearing Luo Feng’s words, Wu Ming was like a defeated rooster, and his previous imposing manner was instantly dispelled.

Seeing this, Luo Feng also heaved a sigh of relief. He knew Wu Ming’s temper too well. If Wu Ming really became stubborn, he wouldn’t be able to stop him. Even if his cultivation base was much higher than Wu Ming ‘s, he couldn’t just tie him up, right?

While Luo Feng and Wu Ming were explaining patiently, the price of the ring had slowly risen to around 28000 spirit stones.

Wu Ming looked at the price on the big screen and sat back in his seat in anger.””This time, things really didn’t go smoothly!”

At this moment, the big screen above the main auction stage flickered and displayed the latest price.

30000 spirit stones.

The price had been raised by 2000.

Wu Ming immediately noticed the bidder’s box. It was Box 20, where the star Seizer sect cultivators were!

He jumped up at once and shouted,””Motherf * cker! That Xia guy is trying to anger me on purpose, right? I can’t take it anymore!”

Xia ruofei had just won 50000 spiritual stones from the spirit Vulture mountain and now he was bidding for the ring. This gave Wu Ming a feeling that Xia ruofei was trying to use his spiritual stones to buy what he wanted the most.

If losing 50,000 spirit stones was already depressing, then seeing room 20 participating in the bidding, his depression was undoubtedly doubled.

After Wu Ming finished speaking, he reached out and pressed the increase bid button on the bidding device.

The price on the big screen changed to 30500 spirit stones. Each bid must be no less than 500 spirit stones. He pressed the bid button, and the system increased the bid by default according to the minimum bid.

Luo Feng didn’t even have time to react before Wu Ming had already added the price.

“Young sect master!” Luo Feng was unable to stop Wu Ming, so he could only smile bitterly and say,”stop messing around! Our spirit stones are still of great use, don’t forget the sect leader’s instructions ...”

Luo Feng wasn’t worried that Wu Ming would really spend the 30000 spirit stones in one bid. Since the mysterious young man in room 20 had made a bid, he definitely wouldn’t lose so easily. He would definitely compete for a few rounds. Moreover, the other cultivators hadn’t completely given up on the competition. There were still a few wealthy sects that insisted on bidding.

Therefore, Luo Feng felt that his top priority was to persuade Wu Ming to stop bidding crazily.

Wu Ming straightened his neck and said,”uncle Feng, don’t try to persuade me!” Even if it wasn’t for Yiyi and Xiaoxiao, I wouldn’t be able to take this lying down. They’re clearly using our spirit stones to deliberately anger me! He must’ve heard that I really want to buy this pair of storage rings. Isn’t he just mocking me for not having enough spirit stones to pay?”

Luo Feng couldn’t help but be speechless. He felt that his young sect leader’s brain circuit was really strange, especially when he was still thinking about “Yiyi” and “Xiaoxiao,” which made him not know whether to laugh or cry.

“Young sect leader, maybe he just likes this pair of storage rings?” Luo Feng said,”besides ... If we really compete, we can’t beat them ... He earned more than 70000 spirit stones by selling the ‘truth of the glittering jewel’. With our 50000 spirit stones, that’s 120000. Oh right, they were the ones who put the Qi – gathering pills up for auction, so it’s even more ... We only have around 80000 spirit stones in total ...” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Hearing this, Wu Ming flew into a rage. He shouted,””Uncle Feng, you’re boosting his morale! Even so, he shouldn’t let him win so easily! Even if I have to spend all my spirit stones, I have to bear it! If he had the ability, he would have spent over 80000 spirit stones to buy this pair of rings! Then I’ll admit it!”

If Xia ruofei really spent over 80000 spiritual stones to buy this pair of storage rings, he would probably be the one making a fool of himself instead of Wu Ming. This was because it had far exceeded the premium range and was simply an unbelievable price.

Before the auction, everyone had estimated that the transaction price of this pair of storage rings would fluctuate around 30000 spirit stones. However, considering that it was personally refined by layman Yuntai and had a historical origin, the price might increase a certain amount, but it was impossible to increase several times at once, since layman Yuntai was not a God.

“Have you ever thought of him quitting halfway?” Luo Feng said,”if we spend all our spirit stones and end up buying a pair of rings, the sect master ...”

Luo Feng didn’t finish his sentence, but he felt that Wu Ming should be able to imagine that no matter how much Wu Tiancheng pampered his son, he would probably want to personally peel off his son’s skin!

Wu Ming seemed to have a special attribute, which was that when his rage points increased, his intelligence would also decrease.

After he heard Luo Feng’s words, he only hesitated for a moment before saying, “We’ll talk about the future later! It would be good if he could buy this pair of rings! In any case, it’s unlikely that we’ll be able to get that treasure even with 80000 spirit stones!”

“You ...” Luo Feng didn’t know what to say.

Facing the impervious Wu Ming, Luo Feng had no other choice.

He was even thinking about whether he should first knock out his young sect leader and tie him up, then wake him up after the storage ring auction.

However, he immediately eliminated this terrifying thought from his mind. If he really did that, Wu Tiancheng might not say anything, but the sect leader’s wife, Ren suling, would probably really kill him. Usually, no matter how much trouble Wu Ming caused, Ren suling would not bear to punish him. Sometimes, when Wu Tiancheng spoke a little too harshly, it would immediately stimulate Ren suling’s nature to protect her child and protect Wu Ming.

In just a short while, the price on the big screen jumped a few more times and finally reached 32500 spirit stones.

However, the previous few rounds of bids were all added by cultivators from other sects. After the person from room 20 made a bid of 30000 spirit stones, there was no more movement.

Seeing this, Luo Feng quickly said,”young sect master, look, the star Seizer sect’s people have stopped bidding!” Maybe they’re just testing the waters with a price. If they can get it, it’ll be good, but if the price continues to rise, they’ll back out. ”

As soon as Luo Feng’s voice fell, the price on the big screen was updated to 35000 spirit stones. The bidder was from room 20 again.

Luo Feng couldn’t help but sigh in his heart. You’re all sent by the heavens to play with me! Why did you guys have to wait for me to finish speaking and increase the bid by 2500 spirit stones in one go? isn’t this adding fuel to the fire?

Luo Feng felt that he definitely wouldn’t be able to suppress Wu Ming.

Sure enough, when Wu Ming saw that Suite 20 had made another bid, his eyes seemed to be spitting fire. He stood up with a bang and directly entered a price in the bidding machine. Then, he pressed the “submit” button heavily.

Luo Feng looked up at the big screen helplessly. He had already given up trying to persuade them. He could only pray in his heart that the star Seizer sect’s people were determined enough to buy it, even if it meant 70000 or 80000 spirit stones.

Was there such a possibility? Luo Feng wasn’t confident either.

At this moment, the price submitted by Wu Ming was already displayed on the big screen: 38000 spirit stones.

Didn’t Xia ruofei just increase the bid by 2500 spiritual stones? Wu Ming decided to add another 3000 spirit stones. No matter what, he couldn’t be outdone by the star Seizer sect!

As for the consequences of his impulsiveness, Wu Ming had long forgotten about them.

This price scared off a few competitors. These people were also calmly following up with a higher price, but when this price was shown, many people stopped bidding.

After the bid of 38000 spiritual stones was announced, there was a brief silence. For a while, no one continued to raise the bid, and Luo Feng’s heart couldn’t help but jump into his throat.

If they were to close the deal at this price, they would only have around 40000 spiritual stones left. If they were to compete for that treasure with such a small amount of spiritual stones, they might not even be able to reach the starting price.

In room 20.

Xia ruofei sat calmly on the sofa, the corners of his mouth curved up. He said indifferently,””Interesting! The spirit Vulture mountain seemed to be very determined! He’s really a little willful!”

“It’s probably that idiot of a young sect leader! Luo Feng definitely isn’t that crazy. ” Luo Qingfeng frowned slightly and said,”but I hate this kind of hotheaded young man the most. He comes out to mess things up at the critical moment!”

Luo Qingfeng naturally knew that Xia ruofei had come to the auction this time mainly for the two storage rings and had made sufficient preparations in advance. Now that Wu Ming had joined in, it was unlikely that he would be able to buy the pair of storage rings at a relatively low price.

Although Luo Qingfeng knew that Xia ruofei had an abundance of spirit stones, he did not want his master to spend money in vain!

Xia ruofei waited for a while. When he saw that no one was willing to increase the bid, he muttered to himself for a while and then pressed the increase button on the bidding machine.

38500 spiritual stones.

This time, Xia ruofei bid according to the minimum bid.

...

Of course, he only wanted to test the waters.

As expected, Wu Ming in room 15 followed up without thinking. Xia ruofei’s bid only stopped for a second before it was updated to 39000 spiritual stones.

Xia ruofei raised the bid unhurriedly, and the price became 39500 spiritual stones.

Not to be outdone, Wu Ming immediately raised the bid, and the price of the storage ring finally broke through 40000 spirit stones.

In the next few rounds, all the other cultivators had basically given up. Only Xia ruofei and Wu Ming were bidding 500 each.

However, Xia ruofei was always calm when he raised the bid. Wu Ming, on the other hand, would raise the bid immediately after Xia ruofei raised the bid, showing his crazy attitude.

Although they only increased the bid by 500 spiritual stones each time, the speed at which they increased the bid was too fast! In just a short while, the price of the Rings had already approached the Great Barrier of fifty thousand spirit stones.
