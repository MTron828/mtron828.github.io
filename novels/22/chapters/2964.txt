2965 The mysterious ore (2)

Chen Xuan was the only son of the sect master of the first heaven sect, Chen Nanfeng. He was also one of the elders of the sect and had reached the early gold core realm. He was only around forty years old, which was considered very young among the early gold core realm cultivators.

If Chen Nanfeng could be said to be at the top of the cultivation world, then Chen Xuan was already the leader of the second generation of cultivators.

A cultivator with such a powerful cultivation base and a prominent family background naturally had unparalleled influence and speaking rights.

Everyone had a strong premonition that Chen Xuan had his reasons for submitting the ore to the auction.

As soon as Hao Qingsong finished speaking, a deep and steady voice rang out from Box 1. It was Chen Xuan.

He laughed and said,””Fellow Daoists, the matter is actually very simple. I found this ore two years ago in an ancient cultivator ruin in the eastern sea. I’ve flipped through the sect’s ancient records but couldn’t find out what this ore is. In the past two years, I’ve studied it whenever I have time, but I’ve never found anything. It doesn’t have any spiritual Qi fluctuations and it’s not any kind of artifact refining material we know of. If it hadn’t come from an ancient cultivator ruin, I would’ve even thought it was an ordinary stone.”

At this point, Chen Xuan paused for a moment before continuing,””Of course, strictly speaking, two years of research still made some small discoveries.”

Initially, all the cultivators were a little disappointed after hearing Chen Xuan’s words, and their interest in the ore had been greatly reduced. However, after hearing Chen Xuan’s last sentence, they could not help but perk up again.

“Perhaps this is the only discovery I’ve made!” Chen Xuan continued. I’ve studied it for a long time without any progress. Not long ago, I asked patriarch Gu of our craftsmanship Hall to try to refine this ore, but we found out that our crafting furnace couldn’t melt it at all. Patriarch Gu also did some experiments and found that this ore is extremely hard. Even Supreme – grade flying swords can’t cut it at all. ”

Chen Xuan paused for a moment before continuing,””That’s all I’ve found. It can be said that it’s of no use ... Later on, I thought that the auction was going to be held today, so I simply sent this ore to the auction. Secondly, I feel that this ore might not be fated to be mine! Perhaps it could find the right person at the auction! So, I’ve decided to auction it today. As for the price, I’ll leave it to fate! Well ... The starting price of this ore is zero. Everyone can bid freely! My only request is for the fellow Daoist who successfully bid for it to share with me what you’ve managed to discover. ”

The moment Chen Xuan finished, the cultivators were enlightened.

It was obvious that Chen Xuan was not in need of spirit stones at all. The reason he had sent the ores to the auction was not to earn money.

On one hand, it was just as Chen Xuan had said. He hoped that other cultivators would share their findings with him to satisfy their curiosity.

On the other hand, they were probably here to support the auction. After all, the heavenly sect was a leading force in the cultivation world, and this auction had been held many times in the cultivation world. It had a deep history, so it was reasonable for the heavenly sect to support the auction with their actions.

However, even though everyone understood Chen Xuan’s actions, they were still uninterested in the ore.

The reason was simple. With the resources and strength of the first heaven society, if they couldn’t figure out anything from this ore after two years of study, what could the other cultivators figure out after they bought it?

Furthermore, according to Chen Xuan, other than its toughness and the fact that it couldn’t be melted by high temperatures, there was nothing special about it. As such, it was basically useless.

The hardness was so high, and it couldn’t be melted. Even if he wanted to add a little bit of ore to the artifact for an experiment, he couldn’t do it. Could he buy it back as a decoration? Or ... Could he use it to smash people during a battle?

Anyone who used their brain to think about it would know that this was indeed a useless item.

Of course, one person was an exception.

After hearing Chen Xuan’s introduction, Xia ruofei was overjoyed.

Naturally, he could guess what the other cultivators were thinking. In that case, there shouldn’t be many people who would jump out to compete with him for this ore. Even if someone was willing to bid, it would most likely be to give face to the first heaven sect, so as to avoid the things being thrown around and embarrassing Chen Xuan.

As long as he raised the price a few more times, most people would give up.

At the thought of this, Xia ruofei could not help but want to bid.

However, he still forced himself to calm down. At this time, he couldn’t show any urgency. These cultivators were all smart people. If he showed a strong desire to buy it, he would immediately be noticed.

These cultivators would quickly think that this person was in such a hurry to buy it. Could it be that he recognized this ore and that this ore was very precious? Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

When the time came, the price he might have to pay wasn’t the most important thing. He was more afraid that Chen Xuan of the first heaven society would have the same idea.

Chen Xuan had been researching this for two years. He would definitely want to know the secret of this ore. If there was a secret to it ...

Therefore, if Xia ruofei was not careful, he might attract a powerful enemy like the first heaven society. That would not be worth it.

In reality, no matter how careful Xia ruofei was, as long as he was the one who won the bid, he would definitely attract Chen Xuan’s attention. However, since this piece of ore could cause the spirit map to shake so violently, Xia ruofei felt that it was worth the risk.

At this moment, Hao Qingsong had already announced the start of the auction.

Xia ruofei took a deep breath. He decided to bide his time and observe the situation.

Although Chen Xuan of the first heaven society was famous, everyone’s spirit stones didn’t come from nowhere. So, there was indeed an awkward silence at the beginning.

The cultivators who had come to the auction had all seen the treasures that they wanted in advance, so their spirit stones were naturally prepared to compete for the treasures that they had their eyes on. Unless there were very practical medicines and treasures like the Qi gathering pill or the spirit gathering talisman that Xia ruofei had provided, they would not easily change their plans.

At the very least, Chen Xuan’s name alone wouldn’t cause everyone to spend spirit stones to show their support.

Of course, this was with the exception of those who had a favor to ask of the heavenly sect or those who wanted to get on Chen Xuan’s good side.

After a few seconds of silence, a burst of laughter came from room 15. Someone said loudly,””This is the ore that young sect Master Chen found in the ancient cultivation ruins! Even if there were no results from the research, the value would definitely be extremely high. Since fellow Daoists are so modest, then our spirit Vulture mountain will take up the responsibility! I bid 1000 spirit stones!”

Xia ruofei had been waiting for quite a while. Just as he was about to make a bid, he was interrupted by the person from room 15. He could not help but raise his eyebrows.

After hearing the cultivator’s words, Xia ruofei frowned and asked,””Ling Jue mountain? Qingfeng, the person who spoke ...”

“Master,” Luo Qingfeng said quickly,”it sounds like the young sect master of the spirit Vulture mountain, Wu Ming. He’s one of the cultivators you’ve heard about who’s interested in storage rings!”

Xia ruofei laughed,’this Wu Ming is too obvious in currying favor with me! If you want to bid, then bid! You actually reported your name!”

Luo Qingfeng smiled.”Spending 1000 spirit stones on a useless piece of ore? Wu Ming isn’t a spendthrift, so he has to tell Chen Xuan his name to gain Chen Xuan’s favor. Otherwise, wouldn’t the 1000 spirit stones be wasted?”

Li Yifu said from the side,”great uncle – Master, this is a good thing!” Wu Ming had spent 1000 spirit stones on a single ore. Now that the storage ring was going to be auctioned off, wouldn’t he be short of 1000 spirit stones? It would be even better if someone were to raise the price with him! Tell him to spend as much money as he can!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile bitterly ...
