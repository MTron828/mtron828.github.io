Furthermore, Xia ruofei did not know much about them. He did not even know if there were any other people from the star Seizer sect who had come to the capital with them other than Wang Boshan and martial uncle Zheng. If the other party were to set up an ambush at the meeting point, it would be difficult for him to deal with it.

According to common sense, the star Seizer sect would not offend Xia ruofei before the deal was made if they wanted to use the secular world’s methods to purchase the Peach Blossom Island. However, it was always better to be safe than sorry. It was not wrong to be a little more cautious. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

When Wang Boshan heard that, he pondered for a moment and said,””Alright! Then ... I’ll let President Xia pay for it. ”

“What’s the price of a meal?” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”if our business talks go well, a few billion US dollars would be more than enough to last us a lifetime!”

“Hahaha! That makes sense!” Wang Boshan smiled and said,”President Xia, then ... I’ll see you the day after tomorrow?”

“I’ll see you the day after tomorrow!” Xia ruofei said and hung up.

……

Jianguo’s inner street, Beijing International Hotel, top floor luxury suite.

After Wang Boshan hung up the phone, Zheng Yongshou frowned and said in dissatisfaction,””Boshan, why do we have to wait until the day after tomorrow? You’re too inefficient! No wonder you’re so weak ...”

Wang Boshan felt as if he had eaten a fly, but the star Seizer sect had always emphasized respect for teachers, so he didn’t dare to talk back to Zheng Yongshou. He could only smile apologetically and said,””Martial uncle Zheng, we’re asking for a favor. We can’t force them to meet us immediately, can we? What if this kid is disgusted with us and doesn’t want to sell the island no matter how much we offer? Please forgive me ...”

Zheng Yongshou snorted and said,”he dares!” If the soft approach doesn’t work, then we’ll use the hard approach! He’s just an ordinary person. He’s a piece of cake to deal with. ”

“Yes, yes, yes!” Wang Boshan quickly echoed,”junior uncle Zheng, our conditions are so tempting, he can’t possibly reject it.” He had gotten the Paradise Island for free. If he could exchange it for three billion US dollars, he would definitely agree unless he had a problem with his brain. We’ve been waiting for so long, so we can’t let a small detail ruin everything, don’t you think?”

Zheng Yongshou waved his hand impatiently and said,””Alright, alright, alright! We’ll do as you say, we’ll just wait one more day!”

“Thank you for your understanding, junior uncle Zheng!” Wang Boshan quickly said,”uncle – Master, there’s nothing much to do today. Do you want me to show you around the capital?” There are quite a few famous places of interest here!”

“The air here is so turbid, I don’t have the mood to go out!” Zheng Yongshou said,”you don’t have to keep me company. I’ll go back to my room and rest for a while!”

“Yes! Then take care, martial uncle!” Wang Boshan said.

After Zheng Yongshou left the room, Wang Boshan sat on the sofa with a satisfied smile on his face.

In fact, the main reason why Luo Qingfeng, the sect master of the star Seizer sect, sent Zheng Yongshou over was because he valued his array Dao strength. In terms of social experience, Zheng Yongshou, who spent most of his time cultivating in the sect, was definitely far inferior to his martial nephew Wang Boshan.

From Wang Boshan’s point of view, he naturally didn’t want to use force at every turn. Following the rules of the secular world was only one aspect. More importantly, only by taking down the Paradise Island without shedding a drop of blood could he reflect his value! If he were to send a group of cultivators over and occupy the island by force, then how would his importance be reflected?

Once he used extreme methods, his “KPI” would plummet. After all, he was not good at fighting and killing. There were many people in the sect who had higher cultivation and strength than him.

And if he bought the Peach Blossom Island with money, then Wang Boshan would undoubtedly be the main contributor. Perhaps the sect leader would be happy and bestow him with some cultivation resources.

Therefore, in this matter, Wang Boshan was the most hardworking. He wanted to complete this mission through negotiations and transactions the most.

Through the short exchange just now, Wang Boshan felt that this young President Xia should be interested in this “billion US dollars” big project.

Wang Boshan felt that when they meet the day after tomorrow, as long as he slowly threw out the conditions here, even if Xia ruofei didn’t want to sell Peach Blossom Island at first, he would eventually agree to it because he couldn’t resist the temptation of benefits.

Wang Boshan stood up and walked to the room outside. He picked a bottle of red wine from the wine cabinet and opened it. He drank it alone.

……

After Xia ruofei called Wang Boshan, he called Li Yifu to ask about the progress of the project.

Li Yifu reported to Xia ruofei that the overall situation was not bad. They had exceeded the task in one day. At the current speed, they would be able to complete it in about two or three days.

In addition, the second batch of personnel recruited by Li Yifu had also arrived on the island. At the same time, Robert, a senior pilot from the navigation company under Li Yifu’s name, also arrived on the island.

Robert was a mixed – Blood Chinese. His father’s surname was Luo, and his mother was from Italy.

Although his face was slightly westernized, Robert had been learning Chinese under his father’s influence since he was young, so he had a good understanding of China traditional culture.

Therefore, although Robert had the face of a Westerner, he had a pure Chinese heart. This was also an important reason why Li Yifu had sent Robert over to strengthen the pilot team.

As the second group of people had not been screened by Xia ruofei, Li Yifu had restricted their area of activity, including when they were working. He only arranged for them to be at some less important points and had sent people to watch them quietly.

Of course, the newly – joined pilot, Robert, was also restricted.

After Xia ruofei heard Li Yifu’s arrangement, he expressed his approval and appreciation. At the same time, he also advised Li Yifu to speed up the progress of the project and work three shifts at night if necessary. After all, they had more manpower now.

Of course, the premise was that the quality and quantity had to be maintained.

After ending the call with Li Yifu, Xia ruofei went out again to the Paradise society’s main building. He told the security not to report to Zhao Yongjun that he had arrived at the club last night. However, since the night had passed and the security guard did not see Xia ruofei leave, he would definitely report to Zhao Yongjun. Otherwise, it would be a dereliction of his duty.

If he came to the peach blossom Association but hid in the small villa for an entire night and an entire day without coming out, his brothers would also have some opinions.

Xia ruofei asked the manager in the lobby and found out that Zhao Yongjun had been drinking with his friends until two in the morning. Zhao Yongjun was still sleeping in his room.

As for song Rui and the others, they didn’t come here last night. It was still so early, so they must not have woken up yet. Naturally, they wouldn’t come to the club.

Hence, Xia ruofei ordered the lobby manager to report to Zhao Yongjun after he woke up.

Then, Xia ruofei asked the lingji private restaurant to prepare a table of food and wine. He was going to have a few drinks with Zhao Yongjun in the afternoon.

After giving his orders, Xia ruofei returned to the small villa. Since Zhao Yongjun and the others were still asleep, Xia ruofei naturally did not want to waste time there.

He still had to inscribe the core array disc, and time was of the essence.

After returning to the villa, Xia ruofei meditated for a while to adjust his state. Then, he started to practice drawing the core array disc.

Of course, as usual, Xia ruofei didn’t start carving on the materials. Instead, he used his fingers to draw in the air, practicing the carving of the core array disc.

These days, Xia ruofei had been observing the formation, designing the activation and shutting down methods, and so on. His skills in the array Dao had improved significantly. At the same time, his understanding of the Taixu xuanqing formation had deepened. In addition, he had personally designed and improved the core array disc according to the actual formation, so he was very familiar with it. He could simulate it even with his eyes closed.

What he lacked now was nothing more than the proficiency and accuracy of the technique. There were no shortcuts in this area, and he could only improve through repeated practice.
