“It seems like this spacesuit has some resistance to corrosion, but it won’t last long in the clouds …” Xia ruofei frowned.

Xia ruofei had just submerged the spacesuit into the clouds, but it only stayed there for a few seconds before he picked it up.

Looking at it now, the outer appearance of the spacesuit had been damaged to a certain extent, but it had not been completely corroded.

If it had been a little longer, the spacesuit might not have been able to withstand the corrosive power of the cloud and would have been pierced through. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Ling Qingxue had also noticed this problem. She furrowed her brows and said,””Yup! What should he do? We can’t go down at all…”

Xia ruofei pondered for a moment and said decisively,””I’ll use this spacesuit!”

“Ah?” Ling Qingxue’s eyes widened as she said,”ruofei, you can’t do this recklessly! I don’t think this spacesuit will last more than a minute. Once the clothes are damaged, the corrosive mist will enter the spacesuits and the person will be dead!”

Xia ruofei said calmly,”! didn’t expect the spacesuit to be completely resistant to corrosion. It’s just an extra layer of protection.” I’ll try it out first, it should be able to use Yuan Qi to open up the protective cover and isolate the corrosive mist inside. The spacesuits function is double insurance, and the most important thing is that it can ensure that we can breathe in safe oxygen!”

Xia ruofei could indeed use his vital Qi to create a protective shield, but he was not sure if it could completely block out the corrosive mist. Besides, in the mist, if one did not have a spacesuit, they would have to hold their breath. Otherwise, if they accidentally inhaled the corrosive mist, they would not be able to survive.

However, it would be different with the spacesuits. He and Ling Qingxue both had a large number of oxygen supply modules. This was a completely closed circulation system, and they could directly absorb oxygen from the oxygen bags on their backs.

This way, he could at least ensure that he could breathe freely.

Even though cultivators could hold their breath for a long time, it would still affect their movements. Furthermore, if they held their breath for more than half an hour, Ling Qingxue would definitely be the first to collapse.

Therefore, the spacesuits were still very important.

Ling Qingxue’s face revealed a worried expression.'”‘RUO Fei, you must be careful! We’d rather not complete the mission than be in great danger!”

Xia ruofei patted Ling Qingxue’s shoulder and said with a smile,””Definitely! I’m not stupid! He had already gained a lot this time, so it didn’t matter if he couldn’t complete the mission. But we’ve already come this far, and I won’t be satisfied if I don’t try! You just wait here obediently and be careful. I’ll go down and try, and I’ll be back soon!”

“En!” Ling Qingxue nodded as she helped Xia ruofei put on the spacesuit.

Soon, Xia ruofei put on the spacesuit and looked very bloated.

He checked the oxygen supply module and the seal of the spacesuit. After everything was fine, he gestured to Ling Qingxue, then grabbed the rope and jumped down.

Ling Qingxue took two steps forward and leaned on the edge of the platform. She stared nervously at Xia ruofei who was sliding down.

After putting on the EVA suit, Xia ruofei became a little clumsy.

This EVA suit was designed to be used in space. It had to be airtight and isolated from radiation, high temperatures, and other harsh environments, so it was very complicated. Space was a weightless environment, so the weight of this EVA suit was quite heavy. However, the astronauts would only use this EVA suit in a weightless environment, so the weight basically didn’t affect the astronauts.

On the 6th floor of the Tower of Trials, the gravity was the same as on earth. Xia ruofei’s spacesuit made him look particularly cumbersome.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei was already a cultivator in the Golden core stage. His physical strength and control were many times better than ordinary people. Hence, even though the spacesuit was very heavy, he could still control his posture very well.

Xia ruofei followed the rope and descended slowly. Soon, he was very close to the cloud.

Ling Qingxue held her breath and looked at Xia ruofei nervously.

Xia ruofei immediately released his vital Qi and formed an invisible protective shield around his body. Then, he exerted force and continued to press down.

In fact, Xia ruofei was a little nervous.

However, he wasn’t worried about his own safety. He was worried that the yuan Qi protective shield wouldn’t work.

If the yuan Qi Shield could not block the clouds, Xia ruofei could use the protection of the spacesuit to escape from the clouds in a short time and dispel the danger alarm.

However, Xia ruofei was really at his wit’s end. He could not think of any other way to enter the clouds if this plan did not work.

His intuition told him that the goldthread nether snake was hiding in the clouds. As long as he was able to survive in the clouds, he would have a high chance of finding the snake.

The bottom part of the spacesuit was the first to enter the cloud.

Xia ruofei saw that the clouds had dispersed when they were one or two meters away from the spacesuit. When Xia ruofei, who was wearing the spacesuit’s boots, sank into the clouds, the clouds dispersed..
