Chapter 1691: Hello, lady boss (3)

“If I sleep in, won’t I miss the beautiful morning scenery?” Feng Rao giggled and said,”the scenery here is so beautiful! I really have a feeling that I don’t want to leave after staying here!”

The two of them turned their gazes forward. The surface of the lake was still covered by a thin layer of gauze, making it seem like a paradise on earth. Taking a deep breath, they felt that the air was filled with a faint fragrance of grass, making them feel relaxed and happy.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”then we’ll stay a little longer!” Or just accept my suggestion and take a month off! Don’t worry about the company’s matters!”

“That won’t do!” Feng Rao said,”I don’t want to lose my ambition so early! By the way, how long are you going to stay in Australia? I still have to go back to China to work!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but rub his forehead and smile bitterly.”Again ... I don’t know how many days I’ll have to stay! No matter what, he had to wait until this batch of wine was finished! Anyway, just stay here in peace! If I’m really worried about the company, I’ll call everyone for a remote meeting or something!”

“Alright then!” Feng Jing nodded and said,”Oh right, I’ll go with you today! I’ve never seen how wine is made!”

“Sure! Since you don’t have any mission this time, hurry up and have breakfast if you want to go!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Alright!” Feng Rao said happily.

The breakfast was prepared by Liang Qichao himself, and it was quite sumptuous.

After everyone finished eating, Xia ruofei asked Liang Qichao for his car keys and drove Feng Rao out of Paradise Farm to West Winery.

As for Liang Qichao, he wasn’t interested in brewing wine. He was focused on the farm, so Xia ruofei didn’t let him join in the fun.

After getting off the car at the West Winery, Feng Rao looked at the vintage door and the nameplate on it and asked,””Ruofei, so this is your winery! It looks like it’s been a few years, right?”

“This is one of the wineries. It’s a century – old shop!” Xia ruofei said,”didn’t we pass by a vineyard when we drove here just now? That’s the property of the winery!”

“It’s so big!” Feng Rao said in surprise,”this winery doesn’t look big! I thought it would be one of those small wineries!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”isn’t there a lot of land in Australia?” The West Winery isn’t that big in the Hunter Valley area. Alright, let’s go in!”

Both old West and Kelly were wearing shirts and overalls today. They were directing the workers when they saw the two of them come in. Old West immediately put down his work and came forward. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Xia! Feng! Hurry and come in!” Old West smiled and said,”I was just about to call the farm! We’re about to start brewing the wine!”

“It’s better to come at the right time than to come early!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Xia, I’ll go get you something to eat!” Said cabbili as she walked over.

“Don’t be busy, Auntie cabalie!” Xia ruofei quickly replied,”we had breakfast at the farm and came over! You guys go ahead, we’re just here to watch the fun!”

Then, Xia ruofei pointed at the workers and asked,””What are they busy with?”

“Oh! We’re currently taking the grapes out of the constant temperature warehouse and preparing for the first step!” Old West laughed and said,”before making wine, you have to break the skin and remove the stem!”
