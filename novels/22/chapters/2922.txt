2923 The soul is gone (2)

However, despite his doubts, Goodman did not dare to neglect Pierre. He quickly gestured for his assistant to bring the phone over.

After the assistant handed over the phone, he immediately retreated to a distance.

Goodman said with enthusiasm,””Dear Mr. Pierre, how are you? I’m Goodman!”

“Mr. Goodman, the head of the Coch family, the respected Mr. Charlie Coch, wishes to speak to you directly. Are you free now?” Pierre said seriously.

Goodman was even more surprised when he heard that. He was already very surprised that pilter had contacted him. He did not expect the head of the Coch family to talk to him in person. The status of the two could be said to be as different as heaven and earth. To make an analogy that was not particularly appropriate, it was like in the football world, Messi suddenly wanted to talk to an unknown player in the Chinese second division in person.

After a short moment of shock, Goodman quickly said,””Convenient! It was convenient! Mr. Pierre, I’m free anytime!”

“Then please record Mr. Coch’s satellite phone number!” Pierre said with satisfaction. Right now, Mr. Cohe is waiting for your call!”

“Alright! Alright!” As Goodman spoke, he gestured for his personal assistant to come over and make a record gesture. He then said to the phone,”Mr. Peter, please speak!”

Pilter gave the satellite phone number of Charlie cohe to Goodman, who quickly jotted it down and passed the number to him.

Goodman then checked with Pierre to make sure the number was recorded correctly.

“Mr. Goodman,” pilter said,”Mr. Coch seems to be looking for you urgently. I hope you can call him back as soon as possible.”

“I’ll call Mr. Cohe right away!”Goodman said quickly.

“I’ll have to trouble you then!” Peter said.

Although he spoke rather courteously, his tone did not have the slightest hint of gratitude. On the contrary, it carried the reserved manner of a superior.

“Where? Where! I should!” Goodman said.

After he ended the call with Pierre, he immediately dialed the number that he had just recorded and waited for the other party to pick up. At this moment, his heart couldn’t help but beat faster.

Soon, a steady voice came from the phone,””Hello, I’m Charlie Koch!”

Goodman quickly said,””Mr. Cohe, Hello! I’m Goodman from the Mexico Bay group. Your assistant, Mr. Pierre, just said you were looking for me?”

Hearing this, Charlie cohe snorted and said,”Goodman, your Bay group has been getting a little carried away, hasn’t it?”

Goodman’s flattering smile froze. He shivered as if he had been doused in a bucket of cold water.

He quickly said,”Mr. Ke he, we don’t know if we have offended you in any way. Please tell us!” I will definitely give you a satisfactory explanation!”

“Hmph, did you have a conflict with a Chinese shipping company in kuachakuros?” asked Charlie cohe coldly. I heard that ... It was your people who wanted to take over the other party’s property, and even had some conflicts with them!”

“Ah? “I don’t know about this ...” Goodman said, confused.

Originally, this matter was only handled by the Bay group’s quachakus branch, and the person in charge was Madel. Even ERAD was involved because he just happened to be in quachakus for business, and he was tricked by Madel. Such a small matter, as the leader of the Bay group, Goodman naturally didn’t need to ask or understand. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to do anything all day long. He wouldn’t be able to finish listening to the reports from his subordinates.

However, since Charlie cohe personally asked about this matter, it meant that it was definitely true. Otherwise, why would a super big Shot like him have nothing better to do and come looking for you? He was the one who could really earn millions of dollars in a second! Where would he find the time?

Hence, Goodman immediately said,””Mr. Cohe! I’ll immediately order a thorough investigation of this matter! Punish those who are responsible!”

“Goodman, your Bay group is really famous now!” Charlie cohe coldly said. After my Chinese friend had a conflict with you, he didn’t even dare to pack up and ran away! I’m thinking ... Should I bring them to the United States? I wonder if my friends will be assassinated by the people you sent if they hide in the Koch family?”

These words were a little harsh. Goodman’s back was drenched in cold sweat, and beads of sweat appeared on his forehead. He was so scared that he almost lost his soul.

Goodman could hear the strong resentment in Charlie Coch’s words. It was obvious that Charlie Coch cared a lot about his Chinese friend, and now his friend was being threatened by the Bay group ...

With that thought in mind, fear appeared in Goodman’s eyes.””Mr. Cohe, you’re being too serious! How would we dare to go against the great cohe clan? The matter you’re talking about, it must be that the people under you don’t know the rules and offended your friend. I will definitely find out who was so bold! And I’ll give you a satisfactory answer!”

If it were any other billionaire, Goodman might not have been so scared.

The Coch family was really too terrifying. This family’s influence in the U.S. Political and military circles was quite shocking. Goodman had no doubt that as long as Charlie Coch wanted to, he only needed to make a phone call to get the U.S. Military to send elite troops across the border to Mexico and eliminate the entire Gulf group’s upper echelons.

Although the combat power of the Gulf Group was also very high, that was only in comparison to the weak military and police of Mexico. If the armed forces of the Gulf Group encountered a powerful UA military, especially the Special Forces of the UA military, they would not be able to hold on for long.

In other words, with just a word from Charlie Koch, the Bay group could be annihilated.

How could Goodman show any disrespect to such an existence? He even wished he could worship her. Of course, with such a huge difference in their levels, they would not have any interactions usually.

Hearing this, Charlie cohe’s tone became slightly gentler. He said,”Since you don’t understand the situation, then maybe it was done behind your back!”

“Yes! Yes, I am!” Goodman quickly said,”Mr. Cohe, it must be the people below who made the decision! Don’t worry, I’ll find out soon! Your friend will not be in any danger!”

“I hope your way of handling things is to my satisfaction!” Charlie cohe said,”by the way, my friend said that your people from the Bay group also committed racial discrimination in their shipping company and verbally attacked the Chinese people! I want to know that our cohe family has a very friendly attitude towards China. Many of my good friends are Chinese. Your people’s mouth is too dirty, it makes me very angry!”

Although Charlie cohe did not curse out loud, his words were actually very heavy.

Goodman shuddered in fear and apologized again. He promised that once he found out who the culprit was, he would punish them severely.

“Mr. Cohe,” Goodman said,”from now on, the Gulf Group will treat all Chinese in Mexico with the best attitude. Of course, I can also guarantee that the Chinese will be safe in Mexico!” “When they are threatened, they can directly ask any of our Bay group’s branches for help! I’ll pass on the message as soon as possible and have all the branches place the Chinese’s request for help as the highest priority!”

Charlie cohe was finally quite satisfied after hearing this. He nodded and said,”Goodman, I hope you’ll keep your word! Please settle it as soon as possible! If there’s any progress, no matter what time it is, you must contact me immediately! I’ll keep the satellite phone with me until this matter is finally settled properly!”
