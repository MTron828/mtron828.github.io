Chapter 683: Miracle doctor Xia conquered a new field (3)

Jin Feng hurriedly called for a capable soldier and told him to carefully bring the bowl of medicine to Zhao Cheng. Jin Feng then personally led Xia ruofei back to her room.

The bedroom that Zhao Cheng had prepared for Xia ruofei was on the third floor. It was a very spacious room with a huge balcony. There was also a separate bathroom in the room and even a large bathtub.

“Doctor Xia, is this room okay?” Jin Feng asked,”if you’re not satisfied, I’ll adjust it for you.”

“No need, no need!” Xia ruofei quickly waved his hand and said,”this is good enough. This one!”

“Alright, doctor Xia, you’ve worked hard. I’ll call you when it’s time to eat!” Jin Feng said, then saluted and left.

After Jin Feng left, Xia ruofei gave he kun a call to ask about the situation. He kun told him that Zeng Kewen had summoned him in the afternoon.

Xia ruofei told he kun that he had moved out of the Rongcheng hotel and had other matters to attend to with song Rui. He asked he kun to return to the capital after he was done with his business and not to worry about him.

Hearing that Xia ruofei had already moved out of the hotel, he kun felt that it was a little sudden. However, his mind was focused on meeting him with Zeng Kewen, so he only said a few polite words. He then made an appointment with Xia ruofei to have a good gathering after returning to San Shan.

After the call with he kun, Xia ruofei called Feng Jing and Ling Qingxue to inform them that the project for heart – nourishing soup was going smoothly. However, he had other matters to attend to in Beijing and would be delayed for about a week.

After he was done, Xia ruofei took off his coat and leaned on the bed, closing his eyes to rest. After a while, there was a knock on the door. Xia ruofei shouted,””Please enter!”

It was Colonel Jin Feng who came in. He saluted Xia ruofei and said,””Doctor Xia, the chief asked me to invite you to dinner!”

“Thanks for your hard work, Colonel Louis!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”let’s go!”

When the two of them arrived at the dining room, a sumptuous luncheon had already been prepared. The military style was very obvious. It was all big and rough bowls, and the number of dishes far exceeded that of the restaurants outside.

......

Zhao Cheng stood up and took two steps forward, saying,”Doctor Xia, come and eat!”

At noon, there were only Xia ruofei and song Rui as guests. In addition to the host, Zhao Cheng, and Jin Feng, who was accompanying him, there were only four people in total. There were at least 18 to 19 dishes on this big round table, and the amount of each dish was shockingly large.

Zhao Cheng warmly invited Xia ruofei to sit on his right. Song Rui was naturally on his left.

Then, he unscrewed a bottle of precious twenty – year – old Chen Maotai and served Xia ruofei and song Rui the wine. He poured himself a glass and put the bottle on the table.”Doctor Xia, Xiao Rui, I’d like to give you the first toast! I, old Zhao, was already in despair. It was you who gave me New Hope! Regardless of whether this will work out or not, old Zhao is grateful to the two of you from the bottom of his heart! Come, let’s drink first!”

After that, Zhao Cheng raised his head and toasted.

Xia ruofei and song Rui naturally did not say anything and drank with him. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

After finishing his glass of wine, song Rui couldn’t help but frown and say,””Ruofei, after drinking your Drunken Eight Immortals recently, I can’t even taste the alcohol in Maotai anymore ...”

When Zhao Cheng heard this, he couldn’t help but reveal a look of disbelief. He said,”What? Xiao Rui, this is a twenty – year – old Maotai. I took it out especially for the guests today! What kind of wine is that? Compared to this, my twenty years of Chen Maotai has no smell of alcohol?”
