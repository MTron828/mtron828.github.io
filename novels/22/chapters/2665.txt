Lin Yue was very surprised. She was stunned for a while before asking,””Brother Guo, then ... I’m going to quit my work at the meteorological station?”

“That’s for sure,” Guo Zhan said,”however, ruofei’s company is also a legitimate one. After you join, you can continue to pay the five insurances and one fund. It’s a seamless link. And because the salary is higher, the base amount will definitely be much higher than what you’re paying now. ”

Lin Yue muttered to herself for a moment before saying,””Alright! Then I’ll resign and go over!”

Guo Zhan couldn’t help but feel surprised, “You’ve agreed so quickly? I haven’t even said how much the salary is!”

Lin Yue smiled and said,”I’ll still say the same thing. It’s recommended by big brother Guo. It’s definitely not wrong!” Since you’re suggesting that I resign, then I’ll definitely be better off after that! So ... I don’t need to think about it! I’m going to resign tomorrow!”

Guo Zhan couldn’t help but raise his thumb and say,”Good! Sister – in – Law, I’ll let Ma Jia tell you the details later! Let’s do this first!”

“Mm! Thank you, brother Guo!” Lin Yue sweetly said,”when there’s a chance, Ma Jia and I will treat you to a drink!”

After hanging up the phone, Guo Zhan threw the phone to Ma Jia and said,””Did you see? Even your wife is more straightforward than you!”

Ma Jia laughed and scratched her head.

Xia ruofei stood up and said,””Wolf King, can I say a few words?”

Guo Zhan nodded and made a gesture of invitation.

Xia ruofei cleared his throat and said,”everyone here is an old leader. Since you trust me and are willing to work for my company, I welcome you with open arms! Now that we’ve basically decided, I’ll talk about the work situation and the salary issue. ”

Ma su, Liu mingtian, Wu Jiasong, and Zhong Lin all looked at Xia ruofei. As what Xia ruofei was going to say next was closely related to their work, everyone listened very carefully.

Xia ruofei said,”maybe the wolf King has already told us some things, but he didn’t go into detail.” I personally purchased an Island in the South Pacific, which is about seven square kilometers in size. There is an airport on the island, as well as a small deep – Water dock. Some of the basic infrastructure construction has also begun to take shape. Currently, the security of the island is handed over to an international mercenary group. I hope that the next step is to replace this mercenary group with someone we can trust. This is the original intention of forming the guard team. Training and Daily Alert after landing on peach source Island will be your main tasks. Of course, brother Liu is an expert in logistics, so you may have to take on more responsibilities. The resources, equipment, logistics, and so on on on the island will be handed over to you in the future. ”

“No problem! I’ll do my best!” Liu mingtian declared without hesitation.

Ma su, Wu Jiasong, and Zhong Lin also expressed that they would devote themselves to the defense of Peach Garden Island.

Xia ruofei said,”for the composition of the guard, other than the few people here who are the backbone, Wolf King will also help me recruit some veterans who have retired from lone wolf in the past few years. I have also recruited some retired Scouts and special Forces through other channels. It can be said that the entire guard is basically made up of retired veterans.”

Xia ruofei took a sip of his drink and continued,””I’m planning to place the guards at the three mountains for a period of training and cooperation. During this period, I’ll also purchase the equipment and weapons that everyone needs and store them on the Paradise Island. After the training and assessment were completed, this guard team would be deployed to Paradise Island and replace the International mercenaries to begin the duty of island defense. So when the wolf King gives everyone a leave of absence, you can just go to the three mountains to find me. ”

Xia ruofei considered that it would be inappropriate for so many people to train together in the capital. After all, the capital was the political center of the country. This place was too sensitive. Gathering so many people would easily attract the attention of the relevant departments.

Things were much better in San Shan. Xia ruofei had circled out a lot of land in San Shan for the expansion of the farm. After the company’s headquarters moved, the staff dormitories in Tao Yuan farm were much more empty. The farm’s cafeteria was also much more deserted. After the ex – soldiers went over, they had a place for training, food, and lodging.

“Alright! After this shift is over and the troops have settled down, the four of us will take a break!” Ma Jia said.

Xia ruofei nodded and continued,””Old company commander, after sister – in – Law resigns, ask her to go to San Shan first. You can meet up there.”

“Alright!” Ma Jia said with a smile.

Xia ruofei continued,”as for everyone’s salary, during the period of working on Peach Blossom Island, everyone’s starting salary will be 10000 US dollars. According to the position and responsibility, the actual salary will be between 10000 to 30000 US dollars. In the future, it will continue to increase according to the number of years of work and contribution! In addition, considering that you’ve just left the Army, the company will give you a home allowance of 30000 US dollars!”

The four of them were all officers, and their commanding skills had been tested. Once they were appointed to the guard, they could directly take on the responsibility of commanding. To Xia ruofei, they were talents that could not be bought with money. For such talents, Xia ruofei was not stingy with the benefits. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

He now had more than two billion dollars in his overseas account. Giving his comrades in his old army thirty thousand dollars as a settling – in allowance was not even a drop in the bucket.

However, this sum of money was not a small amount for Ma Jia and the others.

When they were transferred to another profession, the country would also give them a sum of settling – in allowance, which was a part of the transfer allowance. According to their military age, the settling – in allowance would definitely not be as much as 30000 US dollars.

“Ruofei, you’re giving us too much!” Ma Jia said,”you can’t give so much money just because we’re old comrades! This was not appropriate. We know you’re rich, but you earned it with your own abilities ...”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Old company commander,” he said.”You didn’t think that I was deliberately giving everyone more money, did you?”

Ma Jia smiled but didn’t say anything. It was obvious what she meant.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you’re undervaluing yourself!” Do you know how high the salary of those international mercenaries is? What was the most valuable thing these days? A talent! If you were in a mercenary group, you would get a lot more money than what I give you! So, I’ve earned a lot from this!”

Guo Zhan looked at it for a long time before finally saying,”Since RUO Fei is giving you this treatment, it means that you are worth it! I think it’s quite suitable. Who made the rule that soldiers had to live a poor life? Who said that soldiers can’t get a high salary? You guys need to be confident!”

“The wolf King is right!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’ve also told everyone that the guards will definitely have an Elimination System. If you don’t meet the requirements, you will definitely be eliminated. Of course, the elimination only means that you can’t work in the defense of peach source Island anymore. I can still arrange suitable positions for you in the country. ”

At this point, Xia ruofei smiled at everyone and said,””But ... The pay won’t be as high if you’re working in China.”

“There’s still more!” Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”the island defense work is not without risks. Some of the island countries in the South Pacific are more chaotic. The ponaattu nation, where Paradise Island is located, has frequent civil strife. If there are rebels or pirates who want to land on the island, our guards must be able to get out! And there might even be sacrifices. So ...”

“We know all of this, and we’re mentally prepared!” Ma su smiled and said,”if there is no danger, why are we still in charge of security? That’s a vacation!”

Ma Jia’s words made everyone burst into laughter. Almost all the soldiers of the lone wolf assault team had participated in actual combat and seen blood. They had a clear advantage over the Veterans from ordinary troops in this regard.

Xia ruofei also saw this point, so he invited them to be the backbone of the guards as if he had obtained a treasure.
