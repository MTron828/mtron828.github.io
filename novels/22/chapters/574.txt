Chapter 575: Chapter 437 – in full swing (2)

“Then I’ll be counting on your blessings!” Feng Jing smiled and asked,”what’s the matter? Chairman, don’t keep us in suspense. ”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”don’t worry!” It’s a good thing!”

After speaking, Xia ruofei took a sip of the tea that Feng Jing had just made and asked,””Boss Feng, I asked a master from Jiangsu and Zhejiang to help me make the iron – skinned maple bucket some time ago. Do you know about it?”

“En,” Feng Rao nodded,”didn’t you also send Qin Xiaojun and the others to study in Jiangsu and Zhejiang? The matter you wanted to talk about today is related to this?”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I brought the iron – Skin maples that master Luo made for us to Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province. Qiantang city’s Tongren Hall asked Jiangsu and Zhejiang Medical Research Institute to do a test. This batch of iron – Skin maples contains ten percent more dendrobe glucose than the best special products on the market. It’s a treasure among treasures. This batch of iron – Skin maples brought in a total income of more than 20 million ...”

Feng Rao’s beautiful eyes and mouth were wide open. After a while, she said in shock,””A 100 – kilogram Kaede’s for 20 million?”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Of course, this is not the most important thing. The most important thing is that this is not a one – time deal. I have a way to get a stable supply of materials of the same quality, which means ...”

“That means our company will have one more product!” Feng Jing continued excitedly,”and it’s a phenomenal product that can sweep the market!”

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile.”Yes. I’ve also reached a verbal agreement with CEO Lin of Qiantang Tongren Tang. Tongren Tang will be the sole distributor of the Ironhide maples produced by our company. At the same time, they’ve agreed to keep the trademark of paradise Corporation. We still need to discuss the specific cooperation model and other details.”

Xia ruofei took another sip of tea and continued,””So, there are two things that must be done immediately.”

Feng Rao sat up straight and said seriously,”Please speak, Chairman.”

Xia ruofei said,”the first thing is the negotiation. President Lin of Qiantang Tongren Hall has been authorized by the main branch to be in charge of this cooperation. He will fly to Sanshan tomorrow and come to our company to discuss the details of the cooperation. I’m going to let you be in charge of the negotiation this time. You should get ready tonight.”

Feng Jing nodded.”No problem, Chairman. You set the general principles. I’ll try my best to fight for the company’s interests within the framework of the principles!”

......

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’m confident in you!” There are two types of cooperation. One is to sell it to Tongren Hall at a fixed price, and the market behavior after that has nothing to do with us. The other way is to sell on behalf of others. We supply Tongren Hall with goods and use their channels to sell the goods. Then, we give them a certain percentage of Commission. ”

Xia ruofei looked at Feng Jing, who was taking notes seriously, and continued,””That’s because the demand for iron – skinned fengdou is higher than the supply, especially for high – Quality fengdou. There’s a price but no supply, so we can actually accept both models.”

“Chairman, can you elaborate?” Feng Jing nodded. What’s our bottom line for the two modes?”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”if you want to resell it, I’ll sell it at 150000 Chinese dollars per kilogram. If we use this model, it definitely can’t be lower than that.”

Feng Rao nodded and recorded the number seriously. She then asked,””Where’s the sales commission?”

Xia ruofei pondered for a moment and said,”if it’s for retail, we have to participate in the pricing. We can’t let Tongren Hall decide the price. This can be further refined during the negotiation. As for the Commission ... It’s acceptable if it’s within 20000 Yuan per kilogram. After all, they have provided a ready – made and perfect channel!”

“Understood!” Feng Rao said straightforwardly.

Xia ruofei smiled and continued,””The second thing is to design a set of packaging for our Ironhide Kaede Dou as soon as possible. There’s no need to divide it into too many levels because our products are all the highest end, so the packaging can be appropriately luxurious, but it must have good taste. It must highlight the trademark logo of peach blossom company. I don’t know much about the specific design, but I’ll leave it to a professional company to do it!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Alright,” Feng Jing nodded.”I’ll get someone to come up with a preliminary plan tonight. I’ll show it to you tomorrow.”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you’re asking your employees to work overtime again?” Isn’t it too hard on you?”

“Now that the company has enough manpower, everyone doesn’t have to work overtime much. Everyone is holding back their energy to achieve a good performance! No problem!” Feng Rao said with a smile.

She then added,”many of the employees live on the farm. There aren’t many entertainment facilities around here. Many of them go online in the office at night. It’s nothing to do while they’re at it.”

“Alright! “You have the confidence ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Feng Rao jotted it down in her notebook, then raised her head and asked,””Chairman, do you have any other instructions besides these two matters?”

Xia ruofei said,”the last time master Luo came over to help us make the iron – skinned maples, it was a temporary temporary temporary house. Since our company is going to make this a permanent business, we must build a few special houses.” Boss Feng, please tell the construction team’s manager li that the farm is also under construction, so we’ll build a row of bungalows over there, specifically for the production of iron maples in the future. ”
