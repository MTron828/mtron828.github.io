Chapter 329: Three women for a drama (1)

Actually, Jiang Yue and Lu You had already guessed Ling Qingxue’s identity when they first saw her. However, when Xia ruofei introduced Ling Qingxue as his girlfriend, both of them were stunned. Jiang Yue’s beautiful face had turned pale with a tinge of resentment. Lu You also felt an inexplicable sense of panic in her heart. For a moment, neither of them took the initiative to go forward and greet him. Ling Qingxue took note of the two beautiful women’s expressions. She glanced at Xia ruofei with a half – Smile, then took two steps forward. Ling Qingxue extended her hand to the two of them with a confident smile on her face.””Hello!” Lu You was the first to snap out of her daze. She tugged at Jiang Yue’s arm gently, and only then did Jiang Yue reveal a trace of panic. She reached out to shake Ling Qingxue’s hand and said in a very low voice,””Hello!” In comparison, Lu You’s expression was more natural. She also shook hands with Ling Qingxue and greeted her. Although Lu You and Jiang Yue could be considered beautiful, they were still university students. Compared to Ling Qingxue, who had been in the company for many years, the two of them appeared to be a little inexperienced. It was just a simple greeting, but the air was filled with awkwardness. Jiang Yue lowered her head slightly, not daring to look at Xia ruofei or Ling Qingxue. She was like a child who had been caught red – handed by her parents. The smile in Ling Qingxue’s eyes deepened. She turned around and said,””Ruofei, I heard that you’re going to show your two sisters around the farm! Let’s go together ... I’ve been here so many times, but I’ve never properly visited the farm!” Not a ghost! “Is there anything on this farm that you haven’t been to ...” Xia ruofei cried out in his heart. Jiang Yue’s expression was awkward as she bit her lower lip. After some thought, she said weakly,””Brother Xia, sister Qingxue, we won’t disturb you any further ... Youyou, let’s go back first!” After she finished speaking, Jiang Yue turned around and walked towards the car. Lu You, however, grabbed Jiang Yue and looked at Xia ruofei with a half – Smile before saying to Jiang Yue,””Yueyue, didn’t you always want to come to the farm to see? Since you’re already here, why are you in such a hurry to leave? Besides, don’t you still need Xia ruofei’s help?” Jiang Yue looked puzzled and said,””I’m not ...” “What do you mean by no!” Lu You held Jiang Yue’s hand and said,”what’s there to be embarrassed about? Xia ruofei even saved your life before. He won’t reject this small favor. ” Jiang Yue clearly did not know what Lu You was up to. With a blank expression, she said,””Youyou, what are you saying? I ... What do I need brother Xia to help me with?” At this moment, Ling Qingxue caught the important information in Lu You’s words. She glanced at Xia ruofei and said,””RUO Fei, you saved Yueyue’s life? Why didn’t I hear you mention it before?” “It happened a long time ago. If you didn’t mention it, I would have forgotten about it ... Besides, it wasn’t as exaggerated as saving her life. It was just a few hooligans who harassed Jiang Yue and I chased them away.” Xia ruofei said, a little embarrassed. A hint of disappointment flashed across Jiang Yue’s eyes. She said softly,””Sister Qingxue, it happened last semester. Maybe brother Xia didn’t take it to heart ...” “Yueyue,” Lu You said,”I heard that Xia ruofei was slashed by a hooligan in order to save you. He must have lost a lot of blood!” Jiang Yue’s face reddened slightly, but she did not say anything. Ling Qingxue gave Xia ruofei a meaningful look, then smiled and asked,””By the way, Youyou, you said you needed Xia ruofei’s help? I wonder what it is? Is it convenient for me to listen?” Lu You hesitated for a moment. First, she looked at Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue, who looked like a perfect couple. Then, she gritted her teeth and revealed a cute smile. She said to Ling Qingxue,””Sister Qingxue, what’s so inconvenient about this?” Lu You then looked at Xia ruofei and said,””Xia ruofei, the medicine you gave me last time was really effective. Yueyue’s condition is similar to mine. Can you prescribe her some medicine too?” Hearing this, Xia ruofei almost covered his face and burst into tears. Did the heavens send Lu You to play with me? Why did he dare to say anything! The medicine that Lu You was talking about was the one that Xia ruofei had given her after they had returned from Shen Cheng city. It was actually a diluted flower petal solution. That day on the plane back to Sanshan from Shen Cheng, Xia ruofei saw that Lu You was in great pain because of her period pain. Furthermore, the two of them had experienced the turbulence in the clear sky together and Xia ruofei was injured because of it. After returning to the farm, Xia ruofei thought of Lu You’s pained expression when she first got on the plane and felt a little bad for her. Thus, he gave her a bottle of diluted flower petal solution. He had originally forgotten about this matter, but he had not expected Lu You to bring it up in front of Ling Qingxue today. Wasn’t this asking for his life? Jiang Yue was obviously aware of this matter as well. Her face turned red and she revealed an expression of embarrassment that made one feel tender and protective towards her. When Ling Qingxue saw this, she was naturally curious. She asked,”Youyou, I didn’t expect RUO Fei to prescribe medicine for people.” He couldn’t have randomly opened it, right? You really dare to eat it?” “Sister Qingxue, you don’t know about this!” Lu You smiled and said,”Xia ruofei’s medical skills are amazing. My grandfather had acute myocardial infarction the last time and it was all thanks to him that he managed to save him in time! He has also cured many people, all of them with difficult – to – treat diseases. “nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
