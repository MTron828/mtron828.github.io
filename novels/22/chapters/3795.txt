Chapter 3796  Returning to the manor (2)

  If he had completely refined the mansion - guarding wooden token, his control over the green immortal mansion had greatly strengthened, then it could be said that he could now have absolute control over this precious immortal mansion. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

  Bi youzi's last video ended, and all the light gathered on the mansion - guarding wooden tablet, completely removing all the restrictions.

  Xia ruofei stood below the throne, quietly comprehending the essence of "blue sword technique". This kind of direct memory inheritance could even transfer some of bi youzi's cultivation insights into his mind, so it was relatively easier to learn.

  Besides, Xia ruofei's cultivation level was no longer the same as before. His cultivation level might be much lower than bi youzi 's, but in terms of vision and comprehension, he might not be much worse. After all, he had received too many martial arts inheritances. Even if he might not necessarily practice most of the martial arts, he would be able to comprehend them by analogy once he integrated his cultivation insights.

  All the great DAOs had the same destination.

  This was the logic.

  Xia ruofei quickly gained a preliminary understanding of the 'blue sword technique'. He couldn't help but be secretly shocked. This sword technique was indeed very sharp and vicious. No wonder bi youzi had specially emphasized that even if the Jade void temple were to be imparted with some cultivation techniques, it would not include this 'blue sword technique'. Compared to the 'Noble Sword' that Xia ruofei had cultivated, the 'blue sword technique' was more than one level higher.

  Especially if it was used with the blue immortal sword, the power of this Sword Art would be even greater.

  There was another advantage, that was, using the "blue sword Art" to control the blue immortal sword to fly on the sword would make it more flexible. Obviously, the blue immortal sword was specially made for this set of Sword Art.

  Of course, with the black Phoenix flying ship, Xia ruofei did not have many opportunities to use the blue travel immortal sword to fly.

  After he had roughly understood The Blue Sword Art, he began to study how to use the mansion - guarding wooden token to control the blue immortal mansion.

  If he had completely refined the mansion - guarding wooden token, his control over the green immortal mansion had greatly strengthened, then it could be said that he could now have absolute control over this precious immortal mansion.
