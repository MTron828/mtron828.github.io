Chapter 759: Return if there’s a battle summons (1)

“It’s old Luo ...” Guo Zhan’s voice was extremely low.

Xia ruofei’s mind was blown. He was in a daze and could not believe his ears.

There were several officers with the surname Luo in the lone wolf assault team, but only one was called “old Luo.”

He was Luo Zhicheng, the taxi officer of the lone wolf assault team.

This old soldier, who was affectionately called “old Luo” by the soldiers, was the most senior member of the lone wolf assault team. Even Wolf King Guo Zhan was once a soldier under his command.

Old Luo used to be the squad leader of Guo Zhan’s recruits. Later, after Guo Zhan was promoted, he was promoted all the way to the position of lone wolf assault team captain because of his outstanding ability. Old Luo, on the other hand, had not been promoted because of his academic qualifications and other factors. Now, he was already a class two Sergeant Major, equivalent to a class six Sergeant before the sergeant rank reform.

The lone wolf assault team had welcomed a batch of newcomers over the years and also sent away a batch of veterans. However, old Luo had always been a member of lone wolf.

From soldier, squad leader, Acting Squadron Leader to Sergeant, he had become a living specimen of lone Wolf’s commando team. He was also the one with the highest prestige in lone wolf apart from Guo Zhan. Even the officers respectfully called him “squad leader Luo.”

In fact, although old Luo had always regarded himself as an ordinary soldier, Guo Zhan still respected the person who had led him to the beginning of his Army.

Over the past 20 years, old Luo had gone through countless missions, big and small. He had also risked his life countless times. He had five gunshot wounds on his body and had been awarded second – Class merits many times. It could be said that he was honored and was the true “Soldier King.”

As the sergeant of lone wolf, old Luo was the one who organized and implemented the devil’s training for the newcomers almost every year. Xia ruofei was no exception.

During training, old Luo was like the incarnation of the devil. All the new members were trained to the point of death. Whether it was the officers or the soldiers, they all respected and feared old Luo.

Xia ruofei still remembered what old Luo had said in the training camp,””The more cruel I am to you now, the more you will thank me in the future! Because on the battlefield, the enemy won’t show you mercy!”

......

In fact, in addition to training, old Luo was usually like a loyal elder. He had smiling lines on his face all day long and took care of everyone.

Xia ruofei would never forget how many times old Luo would come in quietly with a flashlight covered with a red cloth in the middle of the night to check on the patients and tuck everyone in.

Xia ruofei would never forget the first time he took part in a real battle. When the gunshot was heard, it was as if all the blood in his body had frozen and his mind was completely blank. It was old Luo who was by his side, constantly encouraging him until he bravely fired the first shot. During the entire mission, old Luo kept a close distance from Xia ruofei. It was this big brother who was protecting his new comrade who had just joined the team.

At the “old age” of 40 years old, old Luo could still serve in the top special combat unit, and he was in very good condition. Whether it was physical fitness, tactics, shooting, or other special combat professional assessments, many young men could not compare to him.

The team’s 20 – kilometer cross – country record was still maintained by old Luo when he was young, and no one had been able to break it.

After Xia ruofei found out that a comrade had died in this mission, many possibilities popped up in his mind. However, he never thought that the one who had died would be old Luo.

This old Sergeant who had taught him special combat skills step by step, this loyal senior who was both a teacher and a friend, his voice, smile, and the bits and pieces of the past few years suddenly surged into Xia ruofei’s heart.

His eyes turned red in an instant. It wasn’t because of the tears in his eyes. The lone wolf assault team had always been bleeding and sweating without tears. It was because of the boundless murderous intent.

Xia ruofei took a few deep breaths and asked in a hoarse voice,””Where’s the class monitor now?” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Guo Zhan slightly raised his head and looked at the night sky, as if he could see the squad leader old Luo smiling at the two people on the sky screen. He said in a low voice,”Follow me ...”

The two of them returned to the building in silence. Guo Zhan came to a window next to the stairs. A doctor on duty sat upright and immediately stood up and saluted Guo Zhan after seeing him.

“We’re going to take a look at our fallen comrades. Please contact them,”said Guo Zhan with a slight nod.

“Alright, please wait a moment!” The doctor on duty picked up the phone on the table and dialed a number. After saying a few words, he called a nurse and said to her,”take these two to the mortuary on the first underground floor. I’ve already coordinated with them!”

“Alright!”

Under the guidance of the nurse, Xia ruofei and Guo Zhan took the elevator to the basement.

As soon as they got out of the elevator, everyone felt a special cold aura. Although they were indoors, they had the illusion of a cold wind blowing on their faces. Even the nurses working in the building could not help but tremble slightly.

However, Xia ruofei and Guo Zhan did not feel any discomfort. Mountains of corpses and seas of blood had come. They were all people who were used to seeing life and death. They were not even afraid of the most vicious enemies, so why would they be afraid of corpses?

The nurse led the two of them down the cold corridor. Everyone’s footsteps were particularly loud in the empty corridor. At the end of the corridor, there was a double iron door. Under the dim yellow light, they could see three red words above the iron door: “mortuary.”

The nurse pressed the button in front of the iron door, and the door of the room next to the iron door opened. Two security guards on duty walked out.
