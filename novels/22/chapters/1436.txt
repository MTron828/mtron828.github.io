Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei could see the uneasiness in the manager’s heart. He smiled and said,”My conditions are very simple. First, I hope you won’t hold this young man and the Auntie responsible. After all, this is an accident that no one wants to happen. Secondly ... I hope you can give that Auntie some medical subsidies or something like that. It’s considered a work injury!”

The apprehension on the store manager’s face turned into surprise. He said,””No problem! No problem! Sir, you’re a really good person!”

“Alright, alright! You don’t have to give me the good guy card!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it’s the new year. It’s good that everyone is fine!”

“Yes, yes, yes!” The store manager said,”Sir, Madam, please wait a moment. I’ll arrange for a few signature dishes immediately. Take it as a small token of our store! Please don’t reject it, or we’ll really feel bad ...”

Xia ruofei had scalded his own hand so that his employees would not get hurt. Furthermore, he did not even ask for any compensation after the incident. The manager was extremely touched.

Xia ruofei turned to look at Ling Qingxue, asking for her opinion.

Originally, Xia ruofei had been injured in this shop. Even if he did not ask for compensation, Ling Qingxue did not want to stay any longer. However, she saw that Xia ruofei seemed to have the intention to stay, so she nodded her head in understanding.

“I’ll have to trouble you then!”Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“No trouble at all! No trouble at all! Please wait for a moment, the dishes will be ready soon!” The store manager said quickly, and then ran all the way to make arrangements.

The waiter, who had caused trouble, also thanked Xia ruofei gratefully. Xia ruofei waved his hand nonchalantly and let him go to work.

At this moment, there was a burst of sparse applause in the shop.

Although there were fewer customers as the Spring Festival approached, it was still mealtime, after all, so there were still many customers here.

Many people had witnessed what had just happened. They were full of admiration for Xia ruofei’s noble character and unquestionable integrity.

Xia ruofei had already sat down, but he had no choice but to stand up and cup his hands in greeting to the diners who were applauding him.

Ling Qingxue sat in the seat opposite her, looking at her boyfriend with a strange light in her eyes.

Although she felt sorry for Xia ruofei’s injury, she was proud of Xia ruofei’s heroic performance.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue did not notice that a young girl had taken a picture of the scene with her phone.

Yuan Xin was the editor of the nearby Sanshan Evening News agency. She had come to this grilled fish shop for lunch with her sister and nephew.

Just now, she had been using her phone to take pictures of her nephew eating his salad. She had been facing Xia ruofei and the others, so the entire process of Xia ruofei catching the stone pot with his bare hands had been captured.

Her professional sensitivity allowed Yuan Xin to stabilize the camera at once and turn the focus of the video from her nephew to Xia ruofei’s side.

After that, Xia ruofei treated his own wound, pleaded for mercy on behalf of the waiter involved, and watched the diners clap spontaneously. All the scenes were recorded by Yuan Xin.

The three mountains Evening News had always been dedicated to the spread of the land, and would report all kinds of news that happened in the three mountains at the first moment.

Yuan Xin realized that she had captured a very good piece of news material. She didn’t even bother to eat and hurriedly told her sister, picked up her bag, and rushed back to the newspaper office.

Sanshan Evening News agency.

Yuan Xin rushed directly to the editor-in-chief’s office of the social Affairs group. After knocking on the door, she pushed the door open and walked into the office without waiting for the editor – in – chief to let her in.

The editor – in – chief, Lin Cheng, was spreading out his wire bed and preparing to take a nap in the office when Yuan Xin barged in.

“Yuan Xin, when can you be more mature?” Lin Cheng said with a bitter smile.

He was still making the bed. It would be awkward if he took off his clothes.

It had been two years since Yuan Xin joined the company, but sometimes, it was as if she hadn’t grown up yet. However, her professional skills were very strong, and Lin Cheng was having a headache.

“I’m sorry, chief editor!”Yuan Xin stuck out her tongue and said. I just took a photo of a very good piece of news material, so ... I didn’t even finish my meal before I rushed over to report it to you!”

“What news material? Why would an experienced editor be so anxious?” Lin Cheng asked with a smile as he made the bed.

“You’ll know after you see it!” Yuan Xin said.

Then, she took out her phone and started playing the video that she had just recorded.

“I accidentally took it. The main point isn’t my nephew. Please pay attention to the back ... The exciting part is here!” Yuan Xin explained.

The waiter walked over with the tray. The cleaning lady straightened her body and the two of them collided. Xia ruofei held the tray without thinking and then reached out to grab the stone pot without hesitation ...

At this moment, the camera swayed a few times and then zoomed in, focusing on Xia ruofei ...

Lin Cheng quietly watched the video, and he looked a little excited as he asked,””Yuan Xin, this material is pretty good! Did you interview the young couple after the incident? Have you confirmed their identities?”

Yuan Xin couldn’t help but be stunned. She had just been thinking about sending the video back to the newspaper office, but she didn’t expect to make a common sense mistake ...

Lin Cheng saw Yuan Xin’s expression and already knew the answer. He didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”Yuan Xin, Yuan Xin! What do you want me to say? How could you miss out on such an important part?”

“I ... I’ll go back now!” Yuan Xin said,”they’re still eating there. Maybe they haven’t left yet!” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“What if he leaves?” Lin Cheng asked.

Yuan Xin was at a loss for words, but her brain worked quickly and she immediately had an idea,”Then, we can organize an event to search for heroes in the entire city! Mobilize the netizens to find this young man! In addition, we can also interview the waiters and cleaners involved to enrich the material!”

Lin Cheng didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”you’re quite quick – witted!” Why was he so impulsive just now? Alright, alright, you should go back first! Don’t forget to send me the video!”

Now that traditional media was transforming, the subscription count of paper media continued to decline. Evening News was also taking the path of integrated development and had developed its own official website and app. This way, the time – efficiency of news promotion would be greatly increased, and it could also be added with pictures, audio, video, and so on, making the form more diverse.

Because of the advantages of being in the land, the evening news website and APP still had a good number of users.

This video was naturally going to be posted on the internet.

“I got it, chief editor!” When Yuan Xin’s voice was heard, she was already outside the corridor.

Lin Cheng shook his head with a bitter smile. He went over and carefully locked the office door, then took off his clothes and began to take a nap.

When Yuan Xin rushed back to the stone – pot grilled fish shop, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue had already finished their meal and left. Her sister and nephew were still eating the steamed buns, so it was more troublesome to eat with the children around.

When Yuan Xin heard from her sister that Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue had just left, she quickly ran to the door and looked around. In the end, she still could not find them and could only return to the restaurant in disappointment.

Yuan Xin then went to the store manager and showed her reporter’s pass, saying that she wanted to interview the waiter and the cleaning lady.

The store manager was a little unwilling. After all, this was a problem with the management of the store, and it was completely the store’s fault. Since the big issue had been reduced to a small one, why would he still want to publicize it?

However, he didn’t dare to offend the media, so he could only call the waiter over. As for the cleaning Auntie, the store manager let her go home to rest after applying the medicine.

Xia ruofei had given him specific instructions, so he didn’t make things difficult for the two of them. In fact, he even promised to give her an extra compensation for work injury as per Xia ruofei’s request.

After Yuan Xin interviewed the waiter, she returned to the newspaper office reluctantly and began to write her manuscript without stopping.

The video was not edited out, and only her little nephew’s face was pixelated as a basic sense of protection.

Soon, a report titled “sudden accident at the grilled fish restaurant, mysterious young man caught the hot stone pot with his bare hands to save people” was out of the oven.

Yuan Xin posted the video and the article draft on the newspaper’s review platform, then called the chief editor Lin Cheng to report.

Lin Cheng also immediately reviewed the article on his office computer.

It had to be said that although Yuan Xin’s personality was a little out of place, her professional quality was quite good. Lin Cheng looked at this draft that was almost done in one wave and couldn’t help but secretly admire it.

The text was very smooth, and it was readable.

Lin Cheng only made some minor changes to the draft and basically didn’t make any changes to the framework before directly stamping the approval stamp on the review platform.

The editor on duty immediately received a notification that a new draft had passed the review. He immediately sent the draft to the newspaper’s news website and pushed it to the APP at the same time. He even used the notification function.

In general, there was a limit to the number of notifications per day on apps, mainly because frequent notifications could easily annoy users.

However, Lin Cheng had specifically noted that this article had to be sent to the APP for a push notification. As a senior editor – in – chief, he had the authority to do so.

Soon, all the users who had installed the evening news APP received a push notification about this news on their phones.

On the website, the news was also refreshed, and the click rate began to rise.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue knew nothing about this. At first, Ling Qingxue was no longer in the mood to shop and wanted Xia ruofei to go home early to rest and recuperate. However, Xia ruofei felt that it was rare for him to come out and did not want to dampen the mood, so he told Ling Qingxue in a very relaxed manner that his injury was not serious.

At last, under Xia ruofei’s insistence, the two of them returned to Wanda Mall.

Just as Xia ruofei was shopping with his girlfriend, Feng Jing, the CEO of paradise Corporation, arrived at San Shan city.

In a secluded coffee shop on Shanghang road in the Laocheng District of three mountains, Feng Jing was sitting with a short – haired girl who looked very capable. The two stirred the coffee in front of them as they talked.

“Boss Feng, I don’t think today’s meeting is necessary.” The short – haired girl said straightforwardly,”actually, I’ve already made it clear on the phone that I’m not interested in your company.”
