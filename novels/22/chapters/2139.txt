2140 A pool (1)

“Yes, yes, yes!” Puyol quickly said,”Lord deity, seven years ago, I already ruled Sam ... Uh, this small island ...”

At this point, Puyol showed a slightly embarrassed expression before he continued,””Usually, it’s the other survivors who go fishing, hunting, picking fruits, and so on. That day, I was bored, so I climbed the mountain behind to stroll around ...”

Puyol began to narrate the experience he would never forget that day.

Perhaps it was the guidance of the unknown, but that day, Puyol went deep into the mountain forest where other survivors had never set foot in to collect living supplies, and accidentally came to a pool.

In Puyol’s words, the pool emitted a slight chill, and the water was dark blue, like a sapphire decorating the ground.

What made him even more surprised was that no matter how he walked, when he was about one meter away from the pool, he could not get any closer. There was nothing there, but there was an invisible resistance.

He went around the pond and tried many different locations, but he just couldn’t get close.

Just as he was about to make one last attempt and was about to give up if it really didn’t work, he didn’t know why, but he actually walked one meter away from the pool.

Of course, he only took one or two steps forward. Before he could really reach the side of the pool, the resistance appeared again, and he could no longer move forward.

At this moment, Puyol saw a dark red fruit hanging on a branch beside him. This branch had grown horizontally from the side of the pool, and the fruit was emitting an alluring fragrance.

Puyol, who had been busy for half a day, was already famished. He could not control his appetite at all when he smelled the fragrance. He even forgot to consider whether the fruit was poisonous or not. He just picked it and stuffed it into his mouth.

He couldn’t remember what the fruit tasted like. It wasn’t just because the fruit immediately turned into liquid and flowed down his throat. More importantly, the moment he plucked the fruit and put it in his mouth, the water in the pool suddenly changed!

With a splash, a very thick Python suddenly leaped out of the water, spitting out a scarlet red Yuuko as it bit at him fiercely.

Puyol was trained in combat, so his reflexes were still considered agile. He almost subconsciously rolled to avoid the snake and did not end up in its stomach.

The Python that missed its attack did not stop at all. Its tail swept over with a whooshing sound. This time, Puyol could not Dodge it completely in time. He only raised his arm to block it out of reflex.

Puyol felt as if he had been hit by a truck. With a crack, his arm was broken. Then, his entire body flew up as if he was riding on clouds and mist. He fell out of the one – meter range of the pool and crashed heavily into a tree. He felt as if his internal organs had been shattered.

Puyol’s vision went black at that time. His last thought before he fainted was that he was done for this time and would definitely become the Python’s dinner.

That night, Puyol slowly woke up.

He thought he was dead, but the pain on his body and arms made him know that he was still alive.

Puyol felt like he had just survived a disaster. He lay under the tree and turned his head with all his might to look at the pool. He was almost scared out of his wits.

The Python was swimming in the pool, its cold eyes looking over from time to time.

Puyol was so scared that he didn’t dare to move. In fact, he couldn’t move either. Not only did he break his arm, but he also broke several bones when he hit the tree at the last moment.

That night was torture for Puyol because he didn’t know when the Python would pounce on him and swallow him.

Fortunately, the Python did not seem to leave the one – meter radius of the pool. Although it was eyeing him covetously, it did not come out.

What was even more amazing was that Puyol felt a warmth in his lower abdomen. The warm current gradually spread throughout his body. It was the kind of warmth that one would feel at the last moment when they were having sex with a woman.

After the warm current passed through him, the fractures in his body began to recover quickly.

The next morning, Puyol found that the fractures in his arms and body were almost healed. This was simply unimaginable.

He had been lying under the tree for three days. On one hand, his fracture had not fully recovered, and he was worried that moving his body would cause his bones to be dislocated; On the other hand, he also considered that if he returned to the camp in such a state, he was likely to be killed by the survivors who plotted to usurp the throne.

The Python didn’t seem like it would come out anyway, so Puyol just lay there to recuperate.

For three days, he lay there almost motionless, relying on the dry food and water he had brought with him when he went out.

Then, he found that the fracture had completely recovered.

His injuries, which would have taken at least three months to heal, had actually completely healed in three days.

Moreover, Puyol quickly discovered that his strength had increased by many times. He was originally a strength – Type fighter, and it was a terrifying thing for his strength to increase by several times on this basis.

Speaking of which, the reason Puyol could find that his strength had become stronger was because when he returned to the camp after staying outside for three days, he found that there was a new “King” in the camp. The group of survivors thought that he had died in the forest. After a battle, three people died, and a Portuguese man named olis successfully ascended the throne.
