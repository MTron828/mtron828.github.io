Chapter 285: Is your head stuck between the door (1)

Elder song could not help but frown when he heard the commotion below. Xia ruofei stood up and said,””Chief, I’ll go down and take a look!” “Alright,” he said. Elder song nodded. “I’ll go with you!”Song Rui quickly said. This kid was someone who craved for the world to be in chaos. He would definitely not miss the opportunity to join in the fun. Xia ruofei and song Rui went downstairs and saw a fierce – looking man in a black suit and sunglasses strangling Niu Yusheng’s neck. He said fiercely,””Old man! You’d better call li Zhifu out immediately and make him cooperate with us obediently. Otherwise ... Hehe, the day before yesterday was just an appetizer. We won’t be so polite in the future!” Xia ruofei’s expression turned cold and he shouted,””Stop! Let him go!” With that said, Xia ruofei rushed forward and grabbed the man’s wrist. With a slight shake, the man immediately lost all feeling in his arm and let go of his hand. Xia ruofei snorted coldly and swung his arm. The Man in Black immediately took a few steps back. His arm drooped limply and there was a sharp pain in his joints. The black – clothed man’s expression changed. He cried out in pain and asked,””You ... What did you do to me?” Xia ruofei didn’t even look at the burly Man in Black. Instead, he turned to Niu Yusheng and asked with concern,””Uncle Niu, are you alright?” “I’m fine ...”Niu Yusheng replied while rubbing his neck. Xia ruofei furrowed his brows and asked,”who are these people?” Why did they come to your shop to make trouble?” Niu Yusheng’s eyes were filled with anger as he said,””This is a group of hoodlums! They’re here to find my father – in – Law!” The burly Man in Black saw that he was being ignored by Xia ruofei and was already fuming with anger. In addition, Niu Yusheng called them hoodlums and scoundrels. He couldn’t help but glare at Xia ruofei and shouted fiercely,””Old man, be careful with your words! Believe it or not, I’ll bring my men and smash this little shop of yours tomorrow!” This black – clothed burly man was aggressive, but one of his arms hung limply by his side, which made him look less imposing and instead looked a little comical. Seeing this, song Rui picked his nose and said,””You’re so fierce even when your hand is dislocated, you’re really big – hearted!” Xia ruofei coldly glanced at the Man in Black and his men. He took two steps forward and said,””If you don’t want your other hand to be crippled, then get lost immediately!” The black – clothed man snorted and said,”Little brat, I don’t see your face. You must be a foreigner! It’s best not to meddle in some other people’s business, or else you’ll get into trouble!” Xia ruofei’s face revealed a mocking smile. He crossed his arms in front of his chest and asked,””Oh? Then can you teach me what I should do?” Song Rui also stood beside Xia ruofei with a smile on his face, as if he was watching a good show. Although this kid’s combat strength was weak, he was not nervous at all. He had personally seen Xia ruofei challenge ten Scouts and easily win, so he knew that these three to five hooligans in front of him were not enough to deal with Xia ruofei. The big man in Black said proudly,”kid, you listen clearly. We are brother de’s people. If you don’t want your body to be exposed in the wilderness tomorrow, you’d better kneel down and apologize to me now. Then, compensate me with 50000 Yuan for medical expenses. Then, this matter will be over. Otherwise ... Hmph!” Xia ruofei and song Rui looked at each other and laughed. Xia ruofei pretended to be surprised and said,””So you’re brother de’s man!” “Hmph Hmph! Are you afraid now?” The Man in Black said,”if you’re afraid, kneel down! Obediently pay for my medical expenses!” After saying that, the Man in Black said to his underling proudly,””See? As long as you mention brother de’s name, no one will not be afraid!” The three or four underlings also nodded and held their heads high. It was as if they also felt honored because of their relationship with brother de. Xia ruofei and song Rui couldn’t help but laugh. “What are you laughing at?” the black – robed man asked with a dark expression. “Who is brother de after all this talk?” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I don’t even know if he looks like a pig or a monkey. Why should I be afraid of him? I even have to kneel down and apologize to you, and compensate you with 50000 Yuan? I think your brain was either kicked by a donkey or caught by the door!” “It must have been caught in the door!” Song Rui chimed in and laughed.”Where do you get donkeys from in the South?” “That makes sense ...” The black – clothed man’s expression became extremely unsightly. He gritted his teeth and said,””Kid, are you playing with me?” “Yeah! “I’m just toying with you ...” Xia ruofei looked at the man in Black and said sincerely. “Motherf * cker!” The Man in Black was furious. He waved his hand that had not dislocated and shouted,”brothers, beat him to death! If something happens, brother de will cover for you!” The burly Man in Black had a total of four underlings with him. Then, he took a steel pipe from one of his underlings and ‘went to battle with injuries’. A total of five people rushed towards Xia ruofei. Seeing this, Niu Yusheng’s expression changed drastically. This 60 – year – old man subconsciously picked up a bench in the shop and was about to rush over to help. Song Rui quickly pulled Niu Yusheng back and said in a relaxed manner,””Uncle Niu, quickly put it down! They’re just a few small fries, not even enough for RUO Fei to take care of!” “This ... Will he be able to do it?” Niu Yusheng clearly didn’t quite believe it. Xia ruofei didn’t look very strong, especially after absorbing the petals of the strange flower and practicing the strange posture demonstrated by the little golden man in the stone tablet. His body had discharged a lot of impurities and he looked even whiter and purer, a little like a weak scholar. No matter how Niu Yusheng looked at Xia ruofei, he didn’t seem like the kind of person who could fight. “Uncle Niu, you can just remove the ‘mo’!” Song Rui said with a smile. As the two of them spoke, Xia ruofei’s expression turned cold and he took the initiative to welcome them. The Man in Black who was at the forefront felt his vision blur and Xia ruofei’s figure disappeared from his sight. Then, he heard a loud crack. He felt a sharp pain in his intact left arm and the steel pipe fell to the ground with a clang. Then, he found that he had lost feeling in his left arm. Then, the Man in Black heard screams one after another. When he came back to his senses, his four underlings were already lying on the ground and wailing. He was the only one standing, but his two hands hung limply by his side. He looked rather comical, just like a servant in the Qing court. Xia ruofei looked at the man in Black indifferently and took a step towards him. The Man in Black was so scared that his face turned green, and he couldn’t help but kneel on the ground ...ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels
