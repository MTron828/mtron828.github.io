Chapter 459: The General Manager is in place (3)

“Brother Xia!”

“Lei Hu, from today onwards, miss Feng Jing will be the General Manager of our paradise Corporation.” Xia ruofei said.

“Hello, President Feng!” Lei Hu quickly said.

Feng Rao also nodded at Lei Hu in a friendly manner.

Xia ruofei pointed at the stack of documents on the desk and said,””Lei Hu, move all these documents to the general manager’s office next door. Then, pack up the easternmost suite on the third floor and give the key to President Feng.”

“Yes!”

Lei Hu left the office with the documents. Xia ruofei smiled at Feng Jing and said,””Chief Feng, the company’s resources are limited. We will first assign you a two – bedroom apartment upstairs. This way, it will be more convenient for you to go to work and get to work. Also, there is an employee cafeteria on the first floor for meals. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are provided. Of course, you can also choose to cook at home.”

“Thank you, Chairman.” Feng ke said.

“When can you start work?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Anytime!” Feng Rao’s eyes lit up.

Indeed, she couldn’t wait to get back to work. After resting for more than two months, she was full of anticipation for this new job.

“Alright, I’ll take you to the office!” Xia ruofei said.

When the building was first designed, there were already many offices reserved on the second floor. Before Feng Jing arrived, Xia ruofei had already asked Lei Hu and the others to tidy up the office next door and set up all the office facilities.

When they arrived at the general manager’s office, Feng Jing was very satisfied with the clean and bright office environment. After walking around the office, she said to Xia ruofei,””Chairman, do you have any instructions for the company’s development?”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”There’s no hurry, CEO Feng. Take a look at the information first. We can have a chat after you’re done. I mainly want to hear your thoughts.”

Feng Jing also knew that her understanding of paradise Corporation was only superficial. If she wanted to quickly get into work mode, reading the information and understanding the situation was a necessary preparation.

“Yes, Chairman, I’ll finish reading the documents as soon as possible,” Feng Jing nodded. If you don’t have any other instructions, I would like to start looking at the information now. ”

Xia ruofei was a little stunned. Was he asking the chairman to leave just like that?

However, Xia ruofei was impressed by Feng Jing’s professional attitude. If the capitalists wanted to make money easily, they had to rely on these professional employees.

“Alright, I’ll be leaving then.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”President Feng, you can take your time to read these documents. There’s no rush.”

By then, Feng Jing had already sat down behind her desk and was flipping through the document at the top. Without looking up, she said,””I understand, Chairman.”

Seeing that Feng Jing was already in her work mode, Xia ruofei did not want to disturb her and left the office.

Xia ruofei heaved a long sigh of relief when he returned to his office.

If nothing went wrong, the General Manager of the company was finally selected. Of course, Xia ruofei had to do some research on Feng Jing. If she was not capable enough, she would be fired even if she was introduced by Wu Liqian.

This was because Xia ruofei’s goal was to be lazy. A general manager with insufficient ability would definitely affect his ability to be a hands – off manager.

When Xia ruofei thought about how he would be able to leave all the troublesome matters to Feng Jing, he felt a sense of relief.

He estimated that it would take Feng Jing a few days to finish reading the information and then think about the necessary things.

Hence, Xia ruofei returned to the villa after sitting in the office for a while. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

To Xia ruofei’s surprise, Feng Jing called him in the evening and said that she wanted to see him.

When Xia ruofei arrived at the office, he saw Feng Jing waiting at the door with a document that was more than ten pages long. As soon as she saw Xia ruofei, Feng Jing immediately handed the document to him and said,””Chairman, these are my thoughts on the company’s development. Please take a look!”
