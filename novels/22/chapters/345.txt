Chapter 346: Destroying the evidence (1)

Xia ruofei had specifically asked for such a private room, and the person he was receiving was a beautiful woman. President Zheng naturally knew what he meant. From the beginning to the end, no one came to disturb him. He did not even arrange for anyone to come in and clean up the leftovers outside. …… “RUO Fei ...” Ling Qingxue murmured softly. “What?” “You’re not allowed to bully me in the future!” “En!” “I’m bullying you, you’re not allowed to resist!” “Alright ...” “You’re not allowed to provoke other women!” “Oh ...” Ling Qingxue saw that Xia ruofei seemed to be hesitating and immediately pouted.””You don’t seem to be willing?” Xia ruofei immediately replied seriously,”no, no, I was a little distracted ... Who asked my wife to be so beautiful?” When I’m with you, I can’t help but feel like I’m on cloud nine ...” Ling Qingxue’s face blushed slightly. Although she knew that Xia ruofei was just making an excuse, she still felt as sweet as honey. Xia ruofei calmly put on his clothes piece by piece. Ling Qingxue also started to put on her clothes under the blanket. Although their positions were a little awkward, they were finally dressed. At this moment, Ling Qingxue seemed to have recovered from her shyness. She glanced at Xia ruofei coquettishly and got out of bed to tidy her clothes. Xia ruofei watched from the side with a smile. Ling Qingxue’s movements were very delicate, and there was a different kind of beauty in her unhurried and unhurried movements. Ling Qingxue felt Xia ruofei’s burning gaze and blushed. She walked over and adjusted Xia ruofei’s collar naturally. She even said,””You’re already an adult, but you can’t even put on your clothes properly ...” She looked like a wife who tidied up her husband’s clothes before he left. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but gently pull Ling Qingxue into his arms. He put his mouth close to her ear and smelled the faint fragrance of her hair. He said softly,””Qingxue, I’ll definitely give you a lifetime of happiness, trust me ...” His words were neither fancy nor romantic, but Ling Qingxue’s entire body trembled slightly. She was surrounded by happiness. She nodded her head heavily, then took the initiative to tip – toe and kiss Xia ruofei on the lips. The two of them continued to be affectionate for a while before they smiled at each other and separated. At that moment, Ling Qingxue’s gaze fell on the big bed. In the middle of the white bed sheet, a red flower in full bloom was particularly eye – catching. Ling Qingxue was both embarrassed and anxious,”ruofei, this ... What should we do?” We’ve dirtied the bedsheets ...” Xia ruofei said nonchalantly,”what are you afraid of?” Elder Zheng was such a Big Boss, how could he not be able to afford a bed sheet? At most, I’ll ask chubby boy to give him an extra cabbage tomorrow morning as compensation for the bed sheet ...” “It’s not about the money, okay?” Ling Qingxue didn’t know whether to laugh or cry as she said,”this ... This is too embarrassing ...” “Simple!” Xia ruofei said after a moment of silence. Then, he walked to the bed and tore the bedsheet off. He folded it in half and folded it again until it was a small square piece. Then, he put the bedsheet into his small backpack without a change in expression. “You can’t tell now, can you?” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Ling Qingxue subconsciously looked at the big bed. Although there was also a faint mark on the mattress, it was impossible to see it without looking carefully. At least it was definitely not as obvious as before. “I can’t tell now, but ... The bed sheets ...” Ling Qingxue said. Xia ruofei chuckled as he walked to the cabinet next to him. He opened the cabinet and saw stacks of bedsheets, duvet covers, pillow covers, and other beddings neatly arranged inside. “Come on! Do it yourself!” Xia ruofei grinned at Ling Qingxue as he spoke. The two of them worked together to quickly change the bed sheet into a new, snow – White one. “I can’t tell at all now!” Xia ruofei smiled proudly. Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei with a half – Smile and said,””You look very familiar with it! Do you come to this place often?”Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels
