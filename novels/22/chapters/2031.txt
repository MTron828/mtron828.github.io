2032 A huge amount of wealth (2)

Because her brother Rousey could not move freely, Monica wanted to go and watch the show, but in the end, she chose to be with Rousey.

Unlike the design of ordinary secret passages, the entrance of this secret passage was about two meters high. Moreover, after entering the secret passage, there was a flight of steps that led up. No matter how one looked at it, it seemed to be designed in an anti – human way. It was unknown what the Moore family had thought back then.

Xia ruofei and the other two walked up a dozen steps along the secret passage. After pushing open a door, they entered a room.

The room wasn’t big, only about a dozen square meters.

However, to be able to separate a space of three to four meters in both length and width among the many rooms, and to be undetectable from the outside, the design was actually very delicate.

The room only had two hidden doors and no windows, so it was pitch black when they entered.

However, Xia ruofei’s eyesight was much better than ordinary people. When Lu zhengfeng and Lu hai were about to turn on the light function of the phone, he had found a rope switch on the wall.

Xia ruofei walked over and pulled on the light. A hanging light from the ceiling lit up.

After a short period of adjustment, lui hai and lui zhengfeng finally saw the whole room clearly. But they still couldn’t help rubbing their eyes as if they couldn’t believe what they saw.

The two uncouth men didn’t know the value of the oil paintings on the four walls, so they didn’t mention it for the time being. There were also two rows of shelves with a dazzling array of antiques. They ignored all of them and just looked at the large boxes in the room.

These boxes were stacked in a corner of the room, and there were at least twenty to thirty of them.

The two boxes at the top were still open, and they were filled with gold coins.

The only thing missing from this scene was a flag with a skull in the middle of the gold coins. Otherwise, it would be like a pirate’s treasure like in the movies!

Lui hai had lived in Europe for many years, so he had a good eye. He walked over and took a handful of gold coins, then exclaimed,””It’s the gold coins of Byzantine ...... There are so many of them!”

The Byzantine gold coins were called “medieval US dollars,” and they were the common currency in that era.

If these 20 or 30 large boxes were all filled with this kind of gold coins, even if the collection value was not high due to the large number of gold coins in the world, the value of gold alone would be difficult to estimate.

Lyu hai and Lyu zhengfeng’s breathing became rapid. In contrast, Xia ruofei was much calmer. With the increase of his cultivation, he was more and more indifferent to worldly wealth. He was more interested in the exquisite antiques and oil paintings on the two rows of shelves on the other side and enjoyed them with great interest. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Mr. Xia, what ... What should we do with these gold coins?” Lui hai asked.

Xia ruofei said casually,”do as you see fit!” These are your spoils of war!”

“That won’t do!” Lui hai said hurriedly,”you’re the one who killed the Gelman family this time. We’re just assistants. We can’t take these things!”

The Hong sect valued loyalty the most. Those who were greedy for money would be despised by everyone. Moreover, Xia ruofei’s identity was not ordinary and his ability was beyond their imagination. No matter how valuable these gold coins were, they did not dare to covet them.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”let’s count first!” He still didn’t know if there were gold coins in those boxes! Also, now is not the time to decline, we have to transport these things back first!”

“Yes!” Lui hai agreed with Xia ruofei. Although the Gelman family could no longer pose a threat to them, it was hard to say whether old Gelman had asked for help from the glory society or whether the Turin police would come. Therefore, he couldn’t stay in this troublesome place for long. He had to quickly take everything away and return to his own base camp.

Lyu hai and Lyu zhengfeng immediately checked the boxes.

Of course, they couldn’t count the gold coins one by one. They just opened each box and confirmed what was inside to have a rough idea in their hearts.

At the same time, Lu zhengfeng immediately called a few of his most trusted brothers and arranged for a van to drive downstairs so that they could also enter the secret room to move things.

One by one, the boxes were opened and closed.

Gold coins, gold coins ... The boxes of gold coins were really visually shocking.

He opened more than a dozen boxes in a row, and all of them were gold coins from the Byzantine era.

When there were only about ten boxes left, they were filled with cash when they were opened again, all in euros.

No matter how indifferent Xia ruofei was to fame and fortune, he could not be numb to the sight of boxes of gold and euros.

He couldn’t help but ask,”does this guy like the feeling of being a nouveau riche?” Why are you hiding so much cash at home?”

Based on the size of the boxes, if ten boxes were full of such large banknotes, it would probably be hundreds of millions of euros.

“I can understand ...” Lui hai smiled,”these mafia families have a lot of money that can’t be exposed to the public. Although their money – laundering channels are very developed, it’s normal for them to keep some cash that hasn’t been laundered yet!”

There were tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of euros in money that had not been laundered? This was just a small Mafia family. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be secretly speechless.

Lu zhengfeng’s men were still waiting outside. He told Lu hai to check all the boxes before moving them out. Although these brothers could be absolutely trusted, it would be better if they didn’t see the things in the box.

One box, one box, another box ... He opened ten boxes in a row, all full of euros.

There was only one box left.

This box was placed in the corner of the wall, under the other boxes. It was only after they were all moved away that it was revealed.

Lu zhengfeng was already a bit numb to gold and euros. He went to open the box as usual. After taking a look, he couldn’t help but exclaim, “It’s not money ...”

Xia ruofei also took a look and couldn’t help but laugh.”Although it’s not in euros or gold coins, it seems to be more valuable!”

It was filled with jewelry, including pearls, diamonds, marnaw, and gemstones of all colors. Although it was only half a box, it was obviously worth much more than a box of euros.

“Zhengfeng, close the box!” Lui hai said. Tell the brothers to come in and move it! Right, let them bring in a few more boxes and take away all these antiques, oil paintings, and the like!”

“Alright!” Lu zhengfeng said.

Just as he was about to close the box, Xia ruofei suddenly said,””Wait a moment!”

Lu zhengfeng stopped what he was doing and looked at Xia ruofei. He asked,””Mr. Xia, is there a problem?”

Xia ruofei walked to the box and removed the Pearl agate covering it, revealing a gray box.

“There’s another box here?” Lu zhengfeng was also a little surprised.”I didn’t notice it just now ...”

“Mr. Xia, please open it!” Lui hai said with a smile,”since it’s put together with these jewelries in a special box, the value of the things inside should be high!”

Xia ruofei nodded. He had also taken a quick glance at the box through the gaps of the jewelry and was curious.

He tried to use his mental power to probe it and found that his mental power could not penetrate the surface of the box. He then called Lu zhengfeng to stop.

“Stand further away. What if there’s a trap or something ...” Xia ruofei said.

He wasn’t joking. The material of this box couldn’t even be penetrated by his spiritual power, so it was obviously not an ordinary item.

The information from the secular world was not much of a threat to him, but if it came from the world of cultivation, it was a different story.

He might be able to avoid the possible threats with the protection of his genuine Qi and his sensitive nerve reaction, but Lyu hai and Lyu zhengfeng would not be able to escape.

Seeing Xia ruofei being so serious, lui hai and lui zhengfeng stepped back.

“Forget it. For safety’s sake, you should all retreat into that passageway!” Xia ruofei said.

Although the two of them felt that he was making a mountain out of a molehill, they still carried out Xia ruofei’s order without hesitation.

Seeing that both Lyu hai and Lyu zhengfeng had retreated to the outside of the room, he started to operate his genuine Qi to protect his vital parts. Then, he concentrated and slowly opened the box ...
