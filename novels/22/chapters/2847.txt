Xia ruofei made an ‘OK’ gesture and smiled at the three of them. Then, he walked towards the press conference hall.

Espanyol club’s press conference hall was not very big. When Xia ruofei came out, he saw that the stage was already full. There were also many photojournalists in the aisle and the front desk. When he and Jiang Xiaochen came out, there was a flash of light.

Xia ruofei walked to the seat behind his name tag and sat down. There were three seats arranged for the press conference today. Xia ruofei naturally sat in the middle. On his left was the club’s press officer, and on his right was the club’s Executive Vice President, Jiang Xiaochen.

Initially, the reporters were all whispering to each other. However, when Xia ruofei walked out, everyone immediately stopped talking and the conference hall fell silent.

The club’s press officer in charge of the press conference turned on the microphone. He didn’t waste any time and directly said,””Thank you, media friends, for being here. Next, we would like to invite the club’s Executive Vice President, Mr. Jiang Xiaochen, to make a statement on behalf of the Royal Spanish club!”

Jiang Xiaochen took out the press release that he had prepared earlier. After clearing his throat, he started reading,””Recently, after the end of the away game by the real Espanyol club against the Barcelona Football Club, our club’s players were rudely treated by the home staff. After that, a few media outlets ignored the facts and deliberately smeared the real Espanyol Football Club ...”

Jiang Xiaochen’s press release was well – behaved, and in his statement, he once again emphasized that the “fountain” incident that the Spanish players and coaches encountered at nokapu Stadium was simply incredible. At the same time, he strongly condemned the small number of Catalan media that participated in framing the Spanish manager, Ruby, for lying, and expressed strong shock and indignation at the blatant lies of some club fans in media interviews.

The media reporters were not surprised by the Espanyol club’s official statement, which was basically in line with their judgment. The reporters did not even record it because they would each get a copy of such a statement after the press conference.

Only the photojournalists took a few photos that might not be useful for the news.

In fact, the reporters were more interested in Xia ruofei. As a shareholder of the club, Xia ruofei’s appearance at the press conference was enough to raise the reporters ‘attention. Moreover, Xia ruofei was also the witness of the game and the “fountain” after the game. Was he attending the press conference to fire at bar?a or The Sports Daily?

Therefore, when Jiang Xiaochen was reading the news article, the reporters ‘minds were no longer on this. They were all eager to ask Xia ruofei questions.

When Jiang Xiaochen made this statement on behalf of the club, all the reporters seemed to be controlled at the same time. They raised their hands in unison, indicating that they wanted to ask questions.

Xia ruofei adjusted the microphone’s angle. Before the press officer could speak, he said,””I’m sorry, there’s no Q & A session for today’s press conference, but I’ll still release two more pieces of news. I believe that all of you will have a worthwhile trip!”

When Xia ruofei said that there was no Q & A session, the reporters felt disappointed. After all, this kind of standard statement was not new at all. They could have just reposted it on the club’s official website. Why did they have to make a trip?

Fortunately, Xia ruofei immediately said that he had new news to release, which made the reporters feel a little better. At the same time, their curiosity was piqued.

Xia ruofei paused for a moment. The reporters in the audience quieted down and all eyes were on Xia ruofei.

This was also a very useful little trick. Teachers often used this trick in class. When the discipline in the class was a little bad, many teachers would stop the lecture and look at the students without saying a word. As soon as the teacher’s voice disappeared, the students who were looking at their mobile phones or chatting in low voices would immediately notice and look at the teacher on the podium.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’d like to talk about the fake news that happened in the past two days.” I noticed that The Sports Daily issued a statement, claiming that the reporter Pablo did not keep a close watch and did not detect Mayers ‘lies, which led to this mistake. It sounds perfectly logical. The reporter who failed to fulfill his duty has already resigned and the daily sports news has no responsibility at all. The reporter can even change media and continue to work in the news industry after the limelight has passed. ”

The excitement in the reporters ‘eyes grew. They could tell that Xia ruofei was going to fire at The Sports Daily!

This is what you call news! Previously, Jiang Xiaochen’s statement was full of official rhetoric, and not many readers would be interested in it.

Xia ruofei paused for a moment and changed the topic.””But last night, I received a video from an anonymous netizen and found out that the truth seems to be a little different from what The Sports Daily said in its statement! I would like to invite everyone to watch this video together!”

Xia ruofei turned to the control room and said,””Staff, please play the video!”

The technician, Darco, who had been waiting for a long time, quickly operated the computer. A few seconds later, a video began to play on the big TV in the press hall.

The reporters were naturally staring at the screen, and some of them even pointed their cameras at the screen. Even though they knew that the Spanish clubs would definitely take the initiative to provide a copy of the video, they still did it subconsciously.

When the video appeared, everyone’s eyes were wide open because the person in the video was Mayers, who had been at the forefront of the storm for the past two days. The background of the video seemed to be in Mayers ‘home. Because Mayers was wearing a loose and fat sleepwear, and some tabloid reporters had secretly taken photos of his home yesterday, many reporters who were concerned about the matter still had an impression of it.

Mayers looked at the screen and said calmly,””First of all, I would like to apologize to my friends from all walks of life who are concerned about this matter, and to the Royal Spanish club, which has been slandered. I lied during the interview and caused a bad impact. I also set a bad example for minors. I would like to express my sincerest apologies here!”

After saying that, Mayers immediately changed the topic and said,””However! I also have to say that the statement of The Sports Daily is a complete lie! I did lie in the interview, but it was Pablo, a reporter from the daily sports, who paid me 500 euros and prepared the script in advance for me to memorize. I was completely following his script in the interview! I won’t shirk my responsibility, and I admit that I’ve made a big mistake, but the main culprit of this should be Pablo, The Sports Daily! They were the ones who should be condemned by the public! I will take full responsibility for my above remarks!”

When the reporters saw this, their hearts were almost boiling. However, they suppressed their excitement and didn’t dare to breathe loudly, afraid that they would miss the most crucial information.

As expected, at the end of the video, Mayers said,””By the way, I’ve also kept all the recordings of Pablo’s discussion with me about this matter. I also welcome all reporters to find me to collect evidence! I’m willing to cooperate unconditionally!”

The video ended there.

The moment the video finished playing, the reporters could not hold back anymore. They did not even raise their hands as they threw all kinds of questions at Xia ruofei like a cannonball.

“Mr. Xia, may I ask how you got this video?”

“Mr. Xia, what do you think of Mayers ‘statement?”

“Will the Spanish club file a lawsuit against The Sports Daily?”
