2712 Falling into a trap (2)

Speaking of this, Zheng Yongshou’s face also revealed a strange expression, and said,””And ... Boshan, do you really want someone to share our credit?”

The expression on Wang Boshan’s face changed a few times. He gritted his teeth and said,””Martial uncle Zheng is right! If it wasn’t for the rules, we would’ve dealt with this long ago! Now that we’ve decided to use the methods of cultivators, a few ordinary people can’t threaten us at all! There’s no need for the sect leader to worry!”

“This is right!” Zheng Yongshou revealed a satisfied smile and said,”aren’t you going to book the tickets?”

“Yes!” Wang Boshan quickly replied.

If Li Yifu saw this, he would definitely admire Xia ruofei even more. The development of the situation was almost exactly as Xia ruofei had expected.

Xia ruofei had even considered Zheng Yongshou’s headstrong character. The phone call to Wang Boshan seemed to be risky, but in fact, everything was under control.

Stars Corporation also had a public jet, but it was not so convenient to apply for a flight route, and it was impossible to land directly on Peach Blossom Island like Xia ruofei’s plane. Therefore, for Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou, the most convenient way was to take a civil flight. Even if they needed to transfer flights, one day was enough for the entire flight.

The two of them flew from the capital to Australia’s Brian and transferred two flights before finally arriving at Evarts Island, the capital Island of carnade, in the evening the next day.

For the past two years, Wang Boshan had been keeping an eye on the Paradise Island, which was still called green cloud Island at that time. He didn’t even care much about the business of Stars Group and left it to the professional managers below.

He’d been to Evarts Island for the past two years and had even bought a property there, so he was quite familiar with the situation here.

Soon, Wang Boshan rented a diesel – powered fishing boat. The rent he paid was so high that he could even buy a new fishing boat. His only request was that he had to drive the boat himself and not allow the boatman to follow him.

The boatman had so much money that even if Wang Boshan sailed the boat to the open sea and blew it up, he would not lose anything. Therefore, he naturally agreed without hesitation and handed the boat over to Wang Boshan.

After Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou made some preparations, they got on the fishing boat and sailed out of the civilian dock on the east side of Evarts Island, heading straight for Paradise Island.

It was still early, and the sun was hanging over the sea in the West, slowly setting.

Therefore, Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou did not directly attack Paradise Island. When the outline of Paradise Island gradually appeared in their sight, Wang Boshan turned off the engine of the fishing boat and threw the anchor.

Zheng Yongshou squinted his eyes and looked at the Peach Blossom Island in the distance. He said,””Boshan, to be on the safe side, we’ll sneak onto the island at midnight. We’ll take care of the ordinary people first, then deal with the mercenaries!”

“Alright, martial uncle Zheng!” Wang Boshan replied.

“After we get on the island, find a way to find your mole and give him more benefits so that he can lead the way for us!” Zheng Yongshou said,”after all, he is more familiar with the situation on the island.”

“Alright!” Wang Boshan said,”this guy is the most greedy. As long as we give him enough benefits, he will definitely work for us!”

“En!” Zheng Yongshou said indifferently,”after we take over the island, this person will be useless. We can just dispose of him at that time!”

“Alright, martial uncle Zheng!” Wang Boshan replied.

They didn’t take benilatti’s life and death seriously and thought it was a matter of course. Ordinary people were no different from ants in their eyes.

Moreover, this bainilatti actually dared to keep this rare commodity and continuously increase the price of the information. Wang Boshan had long wanted to deal with him.

“Martial uncle Zheng, which direction should we go to get on the island?” Wang Boshan asked.

Zheng Yongshou closed his eyes and thought for a while, then said,””Didn’t that benilatti say that the rainbow light would appear on the west side of the island? Let’s go to the island from the West! If he remembered correctly, there should be a cliff there. It was a natural barrier that normal people could not climb up. Xia ruofei would not have set up a strong defense in that direction. We can enter the island from that side without anyone noticing and check out the place where the spiritual object is born. ”

“Yes!” Wang Boshan said.

Then, he took out some dry food and mineral water from his backpack and handed them to Zheng Yongshou respectfully.

The two of them had a simple meal and rested on the fishing boat.

Time passed by, and the fishing boat swayed gently with the waves on the sea. The two of them sat cross – legged on the deck. Although the world Energy was very mixed at this time, and they couldn’t cultivate at all, it was good to be able to close their eyes and rest. After all, it was quite exhausting to control so many ordinary people at night.

Finally, Wang Boshan saw that the hand on his watch had passed midnight. He said softly,””Martial uncle Zheng, it’s almost midnight.” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Zheng Yongshou opened his eyes and said,””Let’s go! Be careful not to get too close! To prevent the sound of the engine from exposing our whereabouts!”

“Yes!”

Wang Boshan started the engine of the fishing boat and headed in the direction of Peach Blossom Island.

When they were still 600 to 700 meters away from the west side of Peach Blossom Island, Wang Boshan turned off the engine of the fishing boat. Then he put down a small rubber boat at the stern, sat in the rubber boat with Zheng Yongshou, and rowed hard in the direction of Peach Blossom Island.

Although Wang Boshan’s cultivation was low, only at refined Qi Level 3, he was still a cultivator. Therefore, it was very advantageous for him to row the rubber boat. The speed of the small boat was very fast, and it silently headed towards the west side of Peach Blossom Island.

Soon, they arrived at the submerged reef area. Although the rubber dinghy was relatively small, it could not continue forward.

Therefore, Wang Boshan brought the rubber dinghy closer to a slightly larger reef, and jumped on the reef with Zheng Yongshou.

Wang Boshan also tied the rubber boat’s rope to the reef. Although he felt that the rubber boat was most likely not needed, out of his habit of being cautious, he felt that he should leave a way out for himself. Otherwise, if he really had to leave Peach Blossom Island in an emergency, he could only choose to swim back to the fishing boat.

Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou’s figures flew, using the reef that was exposed above the sea as a foothold, and quickly came to the bottom of the cliff.

The two of them looked at each other and nodded at the same time. Then, they quickly climbed up.

The cliffs here were hit by the waves all year round, and it could be said that not even a blade of grass grew here. It was impossible for ordinary people to climb up from here, but for the two cultivators, there was no difficulty. They grabbed the protruding parts of the cliff and climbed up very agilely. Their speed was so fast that even the top rock climbing Masters could not compare.

In a short while, the two of them had already flipped over the cliff.

Zheng Yongshou quickly glanced around and said in a low voice,””There’s no one here as expected!”

“Martial uncle Zheng, the spiritual Qi here is obviously denser than outside the island. It should be the spiritual Qi leaking from the spiritual objects!” Wang Boshan said.

Zheng Yongshou nodded his head, and his eyes revealed a trace of fire as he said,””I don’t know what kind of luck that kid Xia ruofei has to be able to get a spiritual item! However, the treasures should be kept by the virtuous. He’s just an ordinary person like an ant. What right does he have to obtain the treasures?”

“Martial uncle Zheng, this kid was happy for nothing. In the end, he’s still making a wedding dress for us!” Wang Boshan laughed.

Zheng Yongshou also revealed a rare smile and said,””Let’s go! Let’s search to the East and see if we can find the place where the spiritual object appeared. If we meet anyone along the way, we’ll knock them out and tie them up!”

Wang Boshan’s backpack was mostly filled with ropes, which were used to tie people up.

The two of them lowered their bodies and sneaked toward the east side of the island.

The two of them walked for more than ten minutes, but they still didn’t meet a single person. It was as if the entire Peach Blossom Island had become empty, and the surrounding environment was unusually quiet.

Zheng Yongshou suddenly stopped in his tracks and frowned.””Wait! Boshan, why do I feel like something is wrong?”
