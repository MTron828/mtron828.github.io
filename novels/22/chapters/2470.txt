2471 Liu Dong’s predicament (1)

Liu Dong looked a little embarrassed. He glanced at Xia ruofei unnaturally and asked with a strange expression, ” “Haven’t you been watching the news recently? ”

Xia ruofei was slightly stunned. He had been so busy recently that he did not pay much attention to the news. Could it be that everyone knew about Liu Dong’s incident?

At the thought of this, Xia ruofei smiled bitterly. ” I’ve been busy these days. I didn’t pay much attention to the news. ” Boss Liu, what happened? Is there anything I can do to help? ”

Liu Dong could tell that Xia ruofei was not pretending and his tone was sincere. He knew that Xia ruofei really did not know about him.

However, when he thought about the chaotic situation, Liu Dong could not help but sigh. “Thank you for your kind intentions, President Xia, but I’m afraid you can’t help much with this ...”

Xia ruofei saw that Liu Dong did not want to say more, so he did not intend to pursue the matter. After all, everyone had their own secrets. Since Liu Dong was reluctant to talk about it, it must mean that he did not want to talk about it.

At this moment, Ma Yun, who was sitting on the other side of him, smiled and said, ” “President Xia, President Liu has had some bad luck recently.”

Following that, Ma Yun looked at Liu Dong and asked, “Boss Liu, is it okay if I talk about this? ”

“If you want to say it, then say it!”Liu Dong laughed bitterly. The news is all over the world. Even if you don’t say it, President Xia will know after looking at the news on his phone.”

Ma Yun laughed and said,” boss Liu, don’t think too much.” There’s always a way out, difficulties are only temporary!”

Liu Dong’s eyes gleamed as he said, “That’s for sure! Since I started my business in Zhongguancun, I’ve encountered a lot of difficulties, but I’ve still made it all the way here. ”

Ma Yun gave Liu Dong a thumbs up and said,”Although our two families are competitors, I admire your drive!”

Liu Dong waved his hand helplessly and said,””Boss Ma, don’t flatter me to death ...”

Ma Yun smiled and did not explain further. He turned to Xia ruofei and said,””President Xia, you’ll know once you open the headlines or take a look at Weibo. President Liu’s luck hasn’t been very good recently ... To put it simply, he was set up in Italy some time ago and is now in a Whirlpool, facing problems both internally and externally.”

As Ma Yun said this, he smiled at Liu Dong and asked,”Boss Liu, I’m not wrong, right?”

“Very objective!” Said Liu Dong with a wry smile.

Italy? Xia ruofei was slightly moved.

However, Ma Yun was clearly not giving a clear answer because Liu Dong was also present.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said with a smile,””President Liu, I’m really curious to see what’s making you so worried ...”

Liu Dong said helplessly,”use your phone and see for yourself!” The news is all over the place. Although some of them are true and some are false, and most of them are exaggerated, the overall situation is more or less the same. ”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

He took out his phone and opened the news app, and as expected, he saw news about Liu Dong on the first screen.

Xia ruofei opened the news and read it carefully.

Liu Dong looked a little embarrassed. He stood up and walked to the sofa across from him. He sat down and started chatting with MA Huayi, Cheng Hao, and the others.

There was a lot of news about Liu Dong on the headlines, but the quality of the articles from the media was mixed. They were not as credible as the authoritative media. Xia ruofei read many articles with the mentality of understanding the situation.

Soon, he had a general understanding of the situation.

In fact, the ins and outs of the matter were not complicated. A few days ago, Liu Dong went to Rome, Italy on a business trip for business negotiations. As a result, he encountered a Badger game and was in a very sorry state. Moreover, the storm had not subsided until now.

Xia ruofei had been in charge of the Paradise Corporation for a long time. He was no longer the veteran who knew nothing. Naturally, he would not see the problem so simply.

Now, kyokuboku group was clearly having some internal problems, and there were even more storms in the capital market, causing its market value to shrink.

The most important thing was that for a very simple case, the Roman police and prosecution had not come to a conclusion for a long time, allowing all kinds of news to fly around.

This was obviously not a simple case of extorting money. Someone must have been manipulating this.

After Xia ruofei understood the general situation, he gradually came to a conclusion that the crux of the whole incident was related to Rome. If the police could handle it efficiently, things would be much simpler. The earlier they gave a conclusion, the earlier Liu Dong could free up his hands to solve all kinds of internal and external problems. He might even take the opportunity to clean up the internal affairs. Perhaps, a bad thing could turn into a good thing.

After all, for a behemoth like kyokuboku group, it was inevitable that there would be a place where they would hide their dirty deeds. If they could take this opportunity to clean up their own mess, it might not be a bad thing.

Xia ruofei actually had a good impression of Liu Dong. This legend in the Internet industry started from scratch and was a generous person. Liu Dong had personally attended the launch of the jaded skin cream and even pulled several buses of employees to support him. Although this was for the sake of song Rui’s little brother, Zheng bang, Xia ruofei still had to accept this favor.

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei stood up and said with a smile, ” “Dear CEOs, please Make yourself at home. I’ll excuse myself for a moment.”

Xia ruofei nodded to everyone and walked to the side door of the banquet hall. After leaving the banquet hall, he asked the service staff to open a quiet lounge for him and walked in.

Xia ruofei found the phone number of lui hai, the person in charge of the Italian branch of the Hong sect, and dialed it.

After several rings, lui hai, who was far away in Milan, finally answered the phone. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

His voice was filled with fatigue and a hint of anger. ” “Hello? Who is it!”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, but he quickly realized that Italy was six hours earlier than China. It was ten in the morning here, which meant that in Milan, it was only three or four in the morning, the time when a person was in deep sleep.

To be woken up by the phone ringing at this time, anyone would be angry.

Xia ruofei guessed that lui hai didn’t open his eyes. He picked up the phone in a daze, so his voice was full of resentment.

“Ah hai, it’s me, Xia ruofei!”Xia ruofei said.

Hearing that, lui hai quivered, and his sleepiness disappeared instantly.

He immediately sat up on the bed and said in a respectful tone, ” “So it’s Mr. Xia! I’m really sorry, I wasn’t fully awake just now, so my tone was a little ...”

“I should be the one saying sorry!” Xia ruofei laughed and said, ” I didn’t consider the time difference. I’m sorry for disturbing your sweet dream! ”

“I’m fine! I’m fine!” Lui hai said quickly, ” Mr. Xia, it’s my honor to work for you! If you have any instructions, just say it!”

Xia ruofei had a very high status in lui Hai’s heart. When Xia ruofei flew to Italy, Li Yifu had revealed that he was more distinguished than ” Xia Tian. ” Lui hai, who had long admired ” Xia Tian’s ” fighting skills, had more respect for Xia ruofei.

What was more, when Xia ruofei was in Italy, he had given a big gift to lui hai and his brothers in the Turin branch. It was a jade pendant engraved with basic protection arrays. With this jade pendant, they could stop a fatal attack.

Even though the jade pendant was engraved with the most basic defensive formation and would break when it was triggered, it was still a priceless treasure for lui hai and the others, especially for these brothers who had been living a life on the edge of a knife. It was equivalent to having one more life!

Therefore, lui Hai’s respect for Xia ruofei came from his heart.

Hearing this, Xia ruofei stopped beating around the bush and asked directly,””Ah hai, do you know about the Chinese businessman, Liu Dong?”

“Mr. Xia,” lui hai smiled,”it’s explosive news in Italy, especially in the Chinese circle. How can I not know about it?”

“It’s good that you know. That saves me the trouble of wasting my breath!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Then, he said seriously,”Ah hai, Liu Dong is my good friend, and it’s obvious that he was set up by someone this time, so I want to help him.”

Since Xia ruofei had spoken, lui hai felt it was his duty to do so.

“Mr. Xia, what do you need me to do?” he asked without hesitation.

Xia ruofei said calmly,”as for Italy ... I hope that they can close the case as soon as possible. Of course, the conclusion should be in Liu Dong’s favor.” Ah hai, the Italy Roman police and the prosecution are deliberately delaying the time. How is the influence of the Hong sect on the official level?”

“Close the case as soon as possible, is it?” Lui hai thought for a while and said,”it shouldn’t be a problem. After the last incident, the Hong sect’s influence in Italy is much greater than before. We also have some friends like the Senators. We can ask them to exert some pressure.”

“Then I’ll have to trouble you all!” Xia ruofei said.

“You’re too kind!” Lui hai said straightforwardly,”we’re all Chinese. President Liu fell into a trap in Italy, so we should help him.”

In fact, if Xia ruofei didn’t ask, lui hai wouldn’t have used his resources to help Liu Dong just because he was from Huaxia.

As for Xia ruofei, lui hai was Li Yifu’s trusted subordinate. He didn’t have any psychological burden to use the resources of the Italy branch of Hong sect, and he didn’t need to worry about owing Xia ruofei a favor. Speaking of favors, lui hai was the one who really owed Xia ruofei a huge favor.

The Italy branch’s current situation was inseparable from Xia ruofei’s defeat of the Gelman family, not to mention the magical Jade.

The two of them chatted for a while before hanging up.

Xia ruofei went back to the banquet hall but didn’t tell Liu Dong about this. He wasn’t sure how long lui hai would take to settle this. It was unnecessary to tell Liu Dong now. If things didn’t go well, he would be overjoyed.

Xia ruofei did not mention it, and Liu Dong would not bring it up either. Everyone leaned back on the sofa and chatted casually, as if they had forgotten about it.

Soon, the cold dinner party to celebrate the opening of the Paradise gathering began with a round of applause.

Zhao Yongjun, who looked like a bridegroom, held a wireless microphone in his hand and stepped onto the small stage at the front of the banquet hall with a red face.
