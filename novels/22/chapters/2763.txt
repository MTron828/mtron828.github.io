2764 We won’t go home until we’re drunk (2)

Translator: 5496903“Alright!” Lei Hu replied.

In fact, Lei Hu and Xu Yougang were familiar with many of the Veterans, but he did not drink much tonight because he knew he had work to do.

In a sense, these ex – soldiers were all considered guests today, and he, Lei Hu, was first and foremost an employee of the Paradise Corporation. His task today was to ensure that he could provide good service. This was something that Lei Hu was very clear about.

Xia ruofei personally carried Ma Long to the dormitory to settle down. He then went to each room to let the Veterans rest early. At the same time, he also reminded them to take care of the drunk veterans.

After Lei Hu finished his arrangements in the canteen, he rushed to the dormitory.

Xia ruofei gave him a few more instructions before going downstairs alone. He went straight back to his small villa in Taoyuan farm. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Although he hadn’t lived here for a while, the company had arranged for people to clean it regularly, so the cleanliness was maintained very well. He didn’t have to clean it overnight and could move in directly.

After Xia ruofei took a hot shower, he still felt a little dizzy. He had drunk too much tonight. By a conservative estimate, he had drunk more than three bottles of high – Concentration white wine! Even though he had a strong physique, he still couldn’t take it.

However, Xia ruofei only needed to slightly circulate his genuine Qi, and the alcohol in his stomach and blood instantly evaporated. He quickly regained consciousness.

Xia ruofei locked all the doors and windows of the bedroom and drew the curtains. He then summoned the spirit map scroll from his palm and entered the medium.

He first went to the mountain and sea realm. The time here was synchronized with the outside world. It was already around 11 pm, and the laborers in the realm were already resting in their temporary rooms.

However, Xia Qing was a spiritual puppet, so he didn’t need to sleep. Those free laborers were sleeping, but he was still busy working.

After seeing Xia ruofei enter, Xia Qing quickly came forward to greet him.

Xia ruofei nodded.”I’m fine. I’m just here to check on the progress of the construction.”

Xia Qing replied,”master, with this batch of labor, the progress of a lot of work has been greatly accelerated. You see, the area of the medicine garden has been expanded to more than a hundred mu. There are also dozens of mu of rice fields over there. If I were to take care of it alone, I definitely wouldn’t be able to manage it.”

Xia ruofei was the absolute master of this space. He could see the situation clearly with just a sweep of his spiritual power.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”well done!” Xia Qing, the performance of these free laborers is not bad, right? Is there anyone who’s not behaving?”

“No one here dares to be dishonest!” Xia Qing smiled and said,”now they are already used to your point system. Every day, they will put in their best effort to perform, hoping to exchange for as many points as possible.”

Xia Qing paused for a moment and continued,”you promoted a few team leaders, and the results are good. I intend to give points to these people. Now, in addition to satisfying their food and clothing, they can also enjoy some cigarettes, wine, and drinks. So, they are very motivated!” “The others saw that they were doing so well, so they also tried their best to perform, hoping to get an official position ...”

Xia ruofei laughed.””Where there are people, there will be competition. As long as we don’t engage in egalism and eat from the big pot, we can always maintain vitality!”

“Oh, right ...” Xia ruofei said,”Didn’t I tell you to use the time difference at the Archean realm to cultivate some oak trees? How’s this matter going?”

The last time Xia ruofei brought out a few pieces of oak to make wooden barrels in Australia, Old West was full of praise for the new wooden barrels. He had already urged Xia ruofei several times, hoping to buy more oak as soon as possible.

This was also what Xia ruofei had promised him, so he had asked Xia Qing to consciously cultivate more oak trees.

Xia Qing answered without hesitation.”Master, I personally completed this task. There are already around 150 of them. They were all cultivated at the Archean realm using the difference in time flow before being transplanted here.”

Xia ruofei followed the direction of Xia Qing’s finger and sensed it. He saw a lush Oak Forest. These oak trees were growing very well in an environment rich in spiritual energy. The smallest one was twenty to thirty centimeters thick, which was enough to make oak barrels.

Xia ruofei nodded in satisfaction and said,””Well done! Xia Qing, in the next two days, organize some people to cut down this batch of oak trees, remove all the branches and leaves, and saw off the thinner parts of the tree branches. I only need the parts with a diameter of more than 20 centimeters!”

“Yes! Master!” Xia Qing immediately responded.

“That’s right. I can bring some large branches to the Archean realm to continue cutting and cultivate oak saplings. They will be useful in the future.” Xia ruofei said,”however, after cutting down this batch of trees, we shouldn’t be in such a hurry. After nurturing them at the Archean realm for a period of time, we can directly transplant them here.”

After all, the space at the Archean realm was limited. Xia ruofei couldn’t use the precious space to plant the oak tree. However, he could use some space for cutting. After the saplings survived, it wouldn’t be a problem to transplant them to the Archean realm. If there were a lot of them, he would just need to do a few more cuts and be patient.

What Xia Qing lacked the least was patience. He did these cumbersome tasks every day without sleep or rest, but he never got annoyed, nor did he quit halfway.

Xia Qing replied without hesitation,”Yes, Master. I’ll send a group of people to complete the logging tomorrow morning.” I’ll personally cultivate the new saplings. ”

The importance of the Archean realm far exceeded that of the mountain sea realm. Even though the area of the Archean realm was less than 1% of the mountain sea realm, Xia Qing would never let anyone else do the work that needed to be completed by someone at the Archean realm.

“Mm! There’s a lot of tools like a saw and rope in the space. You just have to arrange them accordingly. ” Xia ruofei nodded.

“Yes! Master!” Xia Qing said.

“Alright then! You can go!” Xia ruofei said,”I’m going to the mountain to cultivate for a while.”

With that, Xia ruofei appeared at the mountainside of the mountain in the mountain sea realm.

After several space upgrades, the small hill had now become a steep mountain. The top of the mountain was shrouded in clouds and mist, giving it a Fairyland feeling.

Of course, the clouds at the top of the mountain were actually formed by extremely dense spiritual Qi, which was fundamentally different from the clouds in the outside world.

Although the mountain kept growing, the caves and stone rooms on the mountainside did not change much.

Xia ruofei sat cross – legged on the platform outside the cave. He closed his eyes and started to practice the second level of the “great Dao technique”.

The concentration of spiritual Qi here was far higher than that of the outside world. Even the Peach Blossom Island’s spiritual Qi concentration was much inferior compared to this place.

As soon as Xia ruofei activated his cultivation technique, a steady stream of spiritual Qi poured into his body.

The true Qi in his body was also slowly transforming into vital Qi, and the efficiency of his cultivation was much faster than directly using Origin crystals in the outside world.

When he was cultivating, he could not feel the passage of time. When Xia ruofei stopped, he realized that it was already nineo’ clock in the morning the next day. He sensed and realized that about 30% of the genuine Qi in his body had been converted into Yuan Qi. After cultivating all night, the results were very obvious.

Xia ruofei let out a breath of air and stood up to stretch his muscles.

With a sweep of his mental power, Xia ruofei discovered that the free labor of the mountain sea realm had already started working. However, Xia Qing was probably worried that using a saw to cut wood would affect Xia ruofei’s cultivation. Thus, although she had organized a group of over ten people, she only distributed the tools to everyone and did not start cutting wood.

Xia ruofei used his mind to tell Xia Qing,””Xia Qing, I’m going back to the outside world! Organize the workers and start working!”

“Yes! Master!” Xia Qing hurriedly bowed in Xia ruofei’s direction and responded.

With a thought, Xia ruofei returned to the outside world.

He kept the spirit painting scroll in his body and went to the bathroom to wash up. Then, he threw the clothes that reeked of alcohol into the washing machine and changed into a set of clean and refreshing clothes. He then left the room and went straight to the staff dormitory where Ma Jia and the others were staying.
