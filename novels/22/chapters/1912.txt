Chapter 1913 Xia ruofei’s counterattack 2

Xia ruofei laughed.”To deal with someone like Liu haojun, simple methods won’t work.”

At this point, Xia ruofei rubbed his chin and said,””According to the information you provided, I have some ideas. Let’s discuss them ...”

“Brother Xia, please tell me!” Xu Yougang said quickly.

……

Half an hour later, Xu Yougang looked at Xia ruofei with admiration. He had received Liu Dong’s information before Xia ruofei, but Xia ruofei had only looked at it for a few minutes and had come up with such a flawless plan. If it were him, he would not have thought of all the possibilities.

At the same time, Xu Yougang felt a chill in his heart. He was glad that he was on Xia ruofei’s side. If he was Xia ruofei’s enemy, it would be a nightmare for the rest of his life ...

“Why are you looking at me?” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”do you remember everything I’ve said?”

Xu You just came back to his senses and quickly said,””I’ve remembered it, I’ve remembered it. Brother Xia, I’ll repeat it to you!”

“No need, just remember it in your heart!” Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”when the plan is carried out, there may be other unexpected situations. You will have to adapt to the situation!”

Xu Yougang thought to himself,”you’ve already considered all possible situations. If we follow your plan, the possibility of an accident is almost zero!”

However, he still replied respectfully,”I understand, brother Xia!” If there are no other instructions, then I’ll go back and prepare!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded,” When it’s being implemented, send me a message. I might go and take a look ...”

“Alright!” Xu Yougang stood up, bowed slightly to Xia ruofei, and then left the room quietly.

……

In the next few days, Liu haojun and Fang Chenchen would sometimes go to the West Lake Mansion for dates at noon. However, old Zhou’s car was always waiting downstairs, so Xu Yougang and the others did not act rashly. They only collected more erotic material.

On the evening of the third day, Zhang Aijun, who was in charge of monitoring Fang Chenchen, sent news that Fang Chenchen had already driven out of the city TV station and was heading to the West Lake Mansion. He was very sure that Fang Chenchen would be spending the night there.

Over the past few days, Xu Yougang had found a place to install a micro – listening device in Fang Chenchen’s car. The device was powered by a high – density lithium battery and could work for about a week. As long as it was within the signal range, it could transmit sound signals to the receiver any time.

Fang Chenchen had called her husband in the car earlier that day. She told him that she had to work overtime to record a show and that it might be very late. She also had some material that needed to be sorted out overnight, so she was staying at the office for the night.

Combined with the fact that she drove directly to the West Lake Mansion before it was time to get off work, Xu Yougang and the others naturally made the judgment easily.

At about the same time, Wang Chong, who was in charge of keeping an eye on Liu haojun in Changping County, called to inform him that Liu haojun’s car had already left the county party committee’s compound and was heading in the direction of the city.

Xu Yougang and Zeng Liang immediately perked up. They had been waiting for so many days just for this adulterous couple to spend the night at the West Lake Mansion!

The two of them looked at each other and said in unison,””Begin the plan!”

Xu Yougang felt like he was walking to the work desk. He felt like a brilliant director, while Liu haojun, Fang Chenchen, Liu Dong, and even Liu Da were all putting on a good show at his request.

To be more precise, Xu Yougang felt that he was more like an Executive Director because the real Executive Director was Xia ruofei, who had never shown up but knew the situation well and had been planning strategies.

……

Liu Dong was busy preparing dinner in the kitchen with an apron on, while his four – year – old daughter, Mengmeng, was watching cartoons on her iPad in the living room.

In fact, he knew that it was not good for a child to look at mobile phones and tablets at such a young age. Not only did it affect their vision, but it also affected their concentration greatly. Children who often played with mobile phones would be very distracted and have a hard time concentrating in the future.

However, Liu Dong had no choice. His mother had been taking care of the child, but not long ago, her heart condition acted up. Although she was discovered in time and handled well, and her life was not in danger, her health was greatly affected. The doctor had also specifically told the old man not to overwork or stay up late. Under such circumstances, Liu Dong could no longer let the old man pick up the children or cook for them.

The old man couldn’t stay idle and wanted to help out with any work, so Liu Dong had sent his mother to pingzhang’s hometown last week to recuperate. He had a few brothers and sisters in the hometown, so the old man would have someone to take care of him.

In this case, he could only take care of the child himself.

His wife, Fang Chenchen, was getting busier and busier. Not only did she get off work late every day, but sometimes she would even work overnight and live in the office. The heavy responsibility of taking care of the child fell on Liu Dong.

Their daughter, Mengmeng, had almost forgotten what her mother looked like. When Fang Chenchen returned home, Mengmeng was already asleep and she had to rush out to work early in the morning. In fact, the little fellow might not see her mother for a few days.

It was the same today. Fang Chenchen had just called to say that she would be working late again and would not be coming home.

Liu Dong sighed as he prepared dinner.

When the two of them had just graduated from University, although life was tough, they had a very good relationship.

Fang Chenchen was a little delicate, and he always gave in to his wife in life, but there was no doubt that they were very loving. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

In the past few years, Fang Chenchen had been a foreign reporter and often ate and slept in the open. He was also very distressed. In the past few months, Fang Chenchen’s luck had been on the rise, and her career could be said to be skyrocketing. It had only taken a few months for her to transform from a penniless reporter to a famous female live streamer.

Fang Chenchen’s career was becoming more and more successful, and her income was getting higher and higher, but Liu Dong could not find the feeling he had in the past. He always felt that there was a barrier between him and his wife. The two of them seemed very close, but there was always an insurmountable distance between them.

In fact, when it came to married life, Fang Chenchen would often reject Liu Dong’s idea on the grounds that she was too tired after a long day of work.

Sometimes, Liu Dong even thought that if he had known this would happen, he would have let Fang Chenchen get into the Environmental Protection Bureau with him! In this day and age, it didn’t matter if the profession was right or not. He didn’t major in Environmental Protection back then, but he could do technical work now, right?

This job did not feel like it had any real power, but it was very relaxing! What was the point of working so hard? Wasn’t it just a happy and healthy family?

Just as Liu Dong was lost in his thoughts, his phone, which was placed beside the stove, rang. He had received a new text message.

Liu Dong was cooking some vegetables, which required a lot of heat control, so he didn’t pay attention to it for the time being.

After all, more and more people were using WeChat now, and the frequency of text messages was very low. In most cases, the text messages they received were either all kinds of notification messages, such as bank deductions, housing loan amounts, etc., Or all kinds of junk messages.

Liu Dong poured the stir – fried vegetables into a plate and washed the pot. He then remembered the text message, so he wiped his hands on his apron and took out his phone to take a look.

“It’s a multimedia message ...” Liu Dong mumbled to himself,”people still send multimedia messages these days?”

It took some time to load the multimedia message. While Liu Dong was waiting for it to load, he was wondering if it was another advertisement poster or something. However, since he was using the internet at home, he didn’t turn it off.

After a while, the multimedia message was loaded. Liu Dong clicked on it and looked at it. Suddenly, he looked as if he was struck by lightning. His eyes were fixed on the phone screen, and the expression on his face was completely stunned ...
