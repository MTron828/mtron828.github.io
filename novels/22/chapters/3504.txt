“Mm! Everything has been handed over clearly!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”from now on, we’ll do the handover on a regular basis. Such a situation will not happen again.” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“It’s not that serious. It’s not a big deal that the winery is closed. Although it’s profitable, I still prefer to develop the gastronomic industry!” Ling Xiaotian laughed and said,”of course, it’s also because of the huge profits from the winery. Otherwise, the expansion of Ling’s food and beverage wouldn’t have been so smooth this year.”

“Don’t worry, uncle Ling. I’ll take care of the winery.” Xia ruofei said,”but Qingxue… She wants to gradually move away from the company’s Affairs. What do you think…”

Ling Xiaotian looked at Ling Qingxue and sighed,””Qingxue has told me a few times … 1 was too stubborn in the past and wanted to train her to be my successor. In the beginning, I wanted her to take over her father’s business, but she didn’t have any talent in cooking. Later, I thought that even if you couldn’t be a chef, you should at least be able to manage this food and beverage group, right? But she was still not happy. Forget it! I won’t force you in the future, but it’s a pity that I’ve worked so hard to build this Foundation …”

Ling Qingxue’s eyes revealed a hint of joy, and she quickly said,””Dad! You’re still young, and your body is so strong. You can still helm the helm for many years! And even if you want to retire, you can just hand the group over to a professional manager team! This Foundation must still be there! As for your cooking skills, you already have so many apprentices, are you still afraid that your cooking skills can’t be passed down?”

Ling Xiaotian smiled bitterly and said,”you’re really determined to leave the

Ling Ji F & B group, aren’t you?” You’re giving me so many reasons …”

Ling Qingxue felt a little guilty, but she could not explain the reason to Ling Xiaotian. She could only lower her head and say,””Dad! 1 just want to live happily with ruofei now. I really don’t want to be busy every day…”

“Ruofei has to manage such a big company himself,” Ling Xiaotian joked,”how can he be with you all day?” He’ll be busy with his career every day, and you’ll have nothing to do. Won’t you feel even more empty?”

“Ruofei is also preparing to leave the company. Our dream is to travel the world!” Ling Qingxue chuckled.

Ling Xiaotian’s eyes widened. He looked at Xia ruofei and asked,””RUO Fei, is what Qingxue said true? You’re not joking, right?”

Xia ruofei was only in his twenties. It was not easy for him to start a business like this. Normally, he would be devoted to the company’s business. Even if he retired at the peak of his career, he was still too young!

Xia ruofei chuckled.”! do have such thoughts, but I can’t completely retire. I only said that I’ll hand over the daily affairs of the company to the professional team. 1 basically don’t care about the company’s Affairs.”

Ling Xiaotian only regained his senses after a long while and sighed,””Even an old man in his fifties or sixties like me doesn’t dare to dream of retirement. You guys are already living a retirement life in your twenties. This … Is simply unreasonable!”

“Uncle Ling, we’re all after different things. I’m not that ambitious in my career. I’m sorry to have embarrassed myself.” Xia ruofei said.

Ling Xiaotian waved his hand and said,”everyone has their own aspirations. There’s nothing to laugh about.” To be honest, I’m quite envious of your lives!”

Ling Xiaotian then said,”alright!” Qingxue, during this period of time, hand over your work to Vice President Guo! He’ll be in charge of the work you’re in charge of.”

“Alright! Thank you, dad!” Ling Qingxue said happily.

“If other vice presidents had their power cut, they would definitely feel like they were struck by lightning. Only you would be this happy…” Ling Xiaotian said with a bitter smile.

“She’s your daughter!” Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”even if I don’t become the Vice President, I’ll still be the little princess of Ling Ji F & B.”

“Who would say that about themselves?” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but chuckle.”Little princess…Haha!”

“None of your business!” Ling Qingxue glared at Xia ruofei.

Ling Qingxue’s mood was naturally very good now that Ling Xiaotian had relented. She even made an exception and allowed Ling Xiaotian to drink a few more glasses of wine. She also poured some white wine for herself and accompanied Ling Xiaotian to drink a glass.

Naturally, Xia ruofei happily drank with him. The three of them finished their dinner in a very relaxed atmosphere.

After sitting at Ling Xiaotian’s house for a while, Xia ruofei got up and left.

Ling Xiaotian even jokingly asked Ling Qingxue if she wanted to leave with Xia ruofei. Ling Qingxue could not help but roll her eyes at her father, then ran straight to the boudoir on the second floor.

Xia ruofei waved goodbye to Ling Xiaotian and left the Ling residence. He walked towards his family’s Villa.

On the way, he kept thinking that he had to make arrangements for the peach blossom company as soon as possible.

So, he took out his phone and called Li Yifu. Because of the time difference, it was still morning on Peach Blossom Island, so the call was connected very quickly.

“Senior granduncle!” Li Yifu greeted him respectfully.

“Foster husband, have you contacted Zheng Yongshou? When will he be here?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Reporting to grand uncle – Master, I’ve sent a plane to the airport near the star Seizer sect to pick up Zheng Yongshou. If everything goes well, he should be able to reach the three mountains tonight… No, at the latest, by tomorrow morning.” Li Yifu quickly said,”the arrangements at San Shan have been made. He’ll settle down first when he arrives, and then he’ll familiarize himself with the situation in the secular world with the people from our branch company..”
