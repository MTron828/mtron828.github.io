tao yuan farm, under the hillside of the orchard.

ye lingyun unloaded the cage from the pickup truck. cao tieshu was already waiting there with a few workers. they quickly came to help when they saw the situation.

cao tieshu took the two cages, and the two workers he brought also took the two cages from ye lingyun.

“xiao liu zi, slow down! This thing is precious!” Cao tieshu saw that a worker was so impatient that he almost tripped, and quickly reminded him.

He led the workers to carefully take the 6 Strasburg geese out of the cage and placed them in the new Goose House. Then, he jogged to Xia ruofei.

“Chairman!” Cao tieshu smiled as he greeted him.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded at Cao tieshu, saying,””Brother Cao, not bad! You’re very efficient, this place has been completely renewed!”

Although this area was not big, it looked very clean and neat. It was surrounded by a bamboo fence. The goose House near the hillside was about half a meter above the ground, and it still maintained the original color of bamboo. The green Goose House was refreshing. Not far from the goose House was a newly dug pond. A lot of green grass was transplanted beside the pond, which were the most common kinds of grass in the countryside.

Of course, the Strasburg goose was still very small at the moment, so it was mainly fed.

“Hehe! “In fact, there’s not much work ...” Cao tieshu laughed,”don’t worry!” I’ll definitely take good care of these geese!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I’ll tell you the things you need to pay attention to!”

“Alright, Chairman, let’s talk over here!” After Cao tieshu finished speaking, he led Xia ruofei to the wooden house next to the fence.

Xia ruofei walked in to take a look. The place had been tidied up. There was a single bed like those in the student dormitory on the left and right side of the window. The bedsheets and blankets had been laid out.

In the remaining space of the mobile temporary house, there were bags of cornmeal.

“Chairman, we bought quite a lot of cornmeal this time. This is only a portion. The rest is in our warehouse,” Cao tieshu said with a smile.

“Not bad, not bad!” Xia ruofei said,”the main food for the Strasburg goose is cornmeal and the batch of Chinese medicine from the manufacturer ...”

Xia ruofei explained the key points of feeding Cao tieshu one by one, including the feeding frequency, the ratio of Chinese medicine to cornmeal, and other things to take note of.

Cao tieshu was also very serious. He took down everything that Xia ruofei had said and even repeated it to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”that’s about it. Brother Cao, don’t be too nervous. Just treat it as a normal goose.” How many people in the countryside had never raised a goose? It’s not difficult at all!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Cao tieshu laughed and said,”that won’t do!” The geese in the countryside could be reared freely, but these geese were precious! That was a foreign goose that was specially imported from abroad! If I don’t take good care of them, I won’t have the face to work here anymore!”

“It’s not that bad ...” Xia ruofei said,”just follow the instructions I gave you. Feed them on time every day and pay attention to them. Don’t get sick. That’s all!”

“Alright, I got it!” Cao tieshu said,”Chairman, I’ve already arranged the manpower. Xiao liuzi, who was moving things with me just now, is also from the same village as me. Although this kid is a little rash when doing things, he is a proper graduate of an agricultural school. It’s just that it is difficult to find a job after graduating from secondary school. It has been half a year since he graduated, and he has not had any serious work to do. So, I brought him here to give it a try.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”sure!” Just treat it as an internship here! He would be put on probation and his salary would be 70% of that of a regular worker. The next step is to start the breeding of goose in Strasburg, and we need a lot of manpower in this area. If the young man’s work is good, we’ll officially hire him. ”

“Chairman, there’s no need for the salary, just food will do!” Cao tieshu quickly said. He’s been idle at home, and now he has the opportunity to work in our company, which is already very good!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”since he’s working, of course he has to be paid!” However, whether he could become a full – time employee or not would still depend on his own performance. Big brother Cao, it’s settled then. Remember to report to the company that the finance department wants to make a salary statement. ”

“Okay, okay, then I’ll thank you on behalf of Xiao liuzi!” Cao tieshu said happily.

They were all from the same village, so they were more or less related. Xiao liuzi was Cao tieshu’s distant nephew. When he had just graduated from secondary school in June and July, Xiao liuzi’s family had asked Cao tieshu for help, hoping to bring their son into the Tao Yuan company to work.

Now, the living conditions of the villagers who worked for the Paradise company were obviously much better than others. Their high income also made everyone very envious.

However, the farm had been well – staffed for the past six months. Although Cao tieshu was the person in charge of the farm, he could not simply put in people. Xia ruofei trusted him so much. He was also extremely loyal to the company and would not do anything that would harm the company’s interests.

This time, Xia ruofei wanted to develop the breeding of Strasburg geese. Coincidentally, Xiao liuzi had graduated from an agricultural school, so Cao tieshu wanted him to work here first. When the large – scale breeding began, he could arrange for him to work here.
