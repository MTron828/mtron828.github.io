Of course, Xia ruofei had not dealt with these intentions for cooperation yet.

His idea was to deepen his business in the domestic market and wait for the company to expand and increase production before he attacked the overseas market.

In any case, the good products were there, and now that their reputation had been established, there was no need to worry about not having a market.

It was the same for the Paradise card, Da Hong Pao.

With the peach blossom company’s reputation as the foundation and the preconceived impression of “peach blossom products are definitely of high quality,” even if the company only put up a promotional banner in its online store and made a routine notice on the company’s official website, there would still be a large number of people willing to try the new products of the peach blossom company.

Nowadays, there were people opening the official website of paradise Corporation, the flagship store of heavenly cats, the self – operated stores in North Capital, and so on every day. The purpose was to not miss the new round of sales of jaded skin cream.

Therefore, as soon as peach blossom company’s new tea product was put on the online store, someone immediately discovered it.

There were even some online media reporters who saw it and posted online reports, which was equivalent to advertising for paradise Corporation for free.

The tea leaves from paradise Corporation were not cheap.

The standard price of a 500 grams was 18888 Yuan. Although it was a far cry from the price of the mother tree Dahongpao that was sold for two, it was still mass – produced after all. Moreover, the mother tree Dahongpao was more expensive because it was rare. The rarer something was, the more expensive it would be!

In other words, if all 500 catties of tea leaves were sold, it would bring in a revenue of nearly 10 million Yuan.

Of course, the marketing department had designed a detailed sales strategy. There were various specifications of tea leaves to choose from on the online store, including 50 grams of experience tea to one pound of standard gift boxes. There were five to six grades for consumers to choose from. Those who could not afford it could buy small packages to try the taste.

However, no matter which grade it was, the unit price was the same, about 18000 Yuan. As for the one 500 grams, it was sold for 18888 Yuan. The remaining 800 Yuan was actually the money for the packaging.

Although the price was very high, the users who were waiting to buy the jaded skin cream were basically financially well – off.

Therefore, after the Taoyuan Da Hong Pao was put up on the online store, they began to receive orders one after another.

There were people who bought from 50 grams to 1 pound. Although there was no bombarding order flow like the jaded skin cream, they still sold 20 to 30 pounds in a very short time.

Xia ruofei was not worried at all after getting the data.

The reputation of the peach blossom company was there, and the quality of the peach blossom Da Hong Pao was also there. He was not afraid that these tea leaves would not be able to sell.

On the contrary, he was worried that the production capacity could not keep up in the future.

This was because he believed that there would soon be returning customers who could recognize the goods. Moreover, the internet was so developed now, and perhaps paradise Brand Da Hong Pao would become an internet celebrity product again. At that time, the number of orders would surge.

These few days, Feng Rao had been going to the city frequently. The matter of the Taoyuan Da Hong Pao was basically handled by Xia ruofei.

What made Xia ruofei feel strange was that Feng Jing had not reported to him the progress of the purchase of the Hengli building project.

......

That afternoon, Xia ruofei flew to the sales office to check the data of the blogshop’s back – end. On her way back to her office, she happened to see Feng Jing walking over from the opposite side of the corridor.

Just as Xia ruofei was about to greet Feng Jing, his phone rang.

So he took out his phone and looked at the caller ID. It was an international call from Australia, Old West.

Hence, Xia ruofei answered the phone and gestured to Feng Jing to follow him back to his office.

Feng Rao looked exhausted. She nodded at Xia ruofei and followed him.

Xia ruofei walked in front and put the phone to his ear. He smiled and said in English,””Uncle Carter, how are you? It should be evening in Australia now! Is there something you need?”

Old West’s excited voice came from the phone.””Boss, I feel that there is something wrong with the seedlings in the vineyard!”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment and frowned. He opened the office door and said,””Something’s wrong? What happened? Could it be that the saplings are dying on a large scale?”

Xia ruofei felt that the possibility was very low! Those seedlings were all cultivated in the spirit map space, and their mother tree was the grape Tree of West Winery! The possibility of acclimatization should not be high.

And even if they were not acclimatized, Xia ruofei had poured a lot of precious spirit Heart Flower petal solution into the irrigation water towers of the two wineries. How could these seedlings be in trouble?

“No,” Old West quickly replied. Boss, you don’t have to worry. ”

Xia ruofei heaved a sigh of relief and asked,””Then what’s wrong?”

“Boss,” Old West said,”I’ve been patrolling the vineyard every day. I realized ... I realized that these grapes are growing too fast. It’s so fast that it’s terrifying ...”

Xia ruofei heaved a long sigh of relief. He didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”Uncle Carter, can you please finish your words in one breath next time? You stopped talking halfway ... I was almost scared to death by you ...”

Old West said nervously,””I’m sorry, boss ... But I think it’s not normal to grow too fast! According to my estimation, the growth rate of this batch of grape seedlings is at least three times that of normal seedlings! There shouldn’t be any problem with this batch of seedlings, right?”

Xia ruofei replied indifferently,”uncle Carter, there’s nothing abnormal about this!” I’ve carefully improved these grape seedlings, and they’re already growing very fast. You’ll see next year that not only are they growing fast, but the quality of the grapes they produce is absolutely first – Class!”

“Next year?” Old Wester was stunned for a moment. He said in disbelief,”boss, you mean ... Our grape trees can bear fruit in less than half a year? This ... This is too unbelievable!”

The growth cycle of grapes varied according to the species. Under normal circumstances, it was possible for newly – planted Semillon grapes to bear fruit in one to three years, depending on the growing environment. However, the grape – picking season in Australia usually started in March, which was only five months away from planting the grape seedlings. It was completely beyond Old West’s knowledge that the grapes could be picked in such a short time.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”although I can’t guarantee it, there’s still hope.” Uncle Carter, I hope you can take good care of these precious grape seedlings. We might have a surprise next year!”

“Definitely, definitely! Don’t you worry!” Old West said happily,”boss, then ... Is there anything we need to pay special attention to in the maintenance of these grape trees?”

Xia ruofei smiled and shook his head.””No, just like how you took care of those Semillon grapevines!”

“I understand, I understand!”

“Uncle Carter,” Xia ruofei said,”I still have something to do here. Let’s call it a day!” I’ll leave the vineyard to you!”

“Alright! Boss, I’ll report to you in time if anything happens!” Old West hung up the phone happily as if he had just taken a calming pill.

Xia ruofei placed his phone on the office table and leaned back on the soft chair.

“Is it from the Australian vineyard?” Feng Jing asked.

Feng Jing knew that Xia ruofei had acquired a winery in Australia. She even knew that Xia ruofei had acquired the winery under the name of an offshore company.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded,”yeah!” He’s a very dedicated old man and the original owner of the winery. ”

“Why does it sound like there’s something wrong with the vineyard over there?” Feng Rao asked.

“Hey! I brought some improved grape seedlings to plant last time. ” Xia ruofei laughed.”But it grew too fast and scared uncle Carter.”

Feng Rao couldn’t help but laugh.

As a founding member of the Paradise Corporation, Feng Jing naturally knew about Xia ruofei’s capabilities. The various vegetables and fruits in the Paradise Farm not only grew much faster than their own kind, but their quality was also much higher.

She was already used to it.

Xia ruofei also laughed and said,”let’s not talk about this. President Feng, I called you here today to ask you about the situation of the acquisition of the Hengli building. It has been a week. Is there any progress?”

Feng Rao’s expression turned helpless. She shook her head with a bitter smile and said,””Chairman, the reason I didn’t report to you in time was because there hasn’t been any substantial progress ... Sigh! We’ve encountered some unexpected resistance!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Tell me! I might have a way to solve it ...”
