Translator: 549690339

Soon, the doctor from the provincial People’s Hospital arrived at song Qiming’s house. He took a blood sample from Song Wei and put it in the refrigerator. Then, he rushed to the airport without stopping.

The flight from San Shan to Jing was about to be pushed out of the waiting area, but because of this incident, they had to wait for another ten minutes in the parking area. It was not until a doctor and a nurse from the provincial People’s Hospital, who had been added to the passenger list, hurriedly boarded the plane that the flight was pushed out.

However, because the waiting time was not very long, and the regulations also gave priority to the release of the plane, the flight was not delayed.

Two hours later, the doctors and nurses from the provincial People’s Hospital left with Song Wei’s blood sample through a special passage. They boarded a 301 Hospital Ambulance that was already waiting at the entrance of the passage.

In less than three and a half hours, Song Wei’s blood sample had been successfully transported from San Shan city to the laboratory of a research team in 301 Hospital.

The expensive and sophisticated blood analysis instrument in the laboratory had already been turned on and warmed up in advance. As soon as the blood sample was delivered, the experts and doctors of the research team immediately began to get busy.

After more than an hour of intense work, the data of Song Wei’s three blood samples were all out. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

……

San Shan city, Southeast province.

At the villa district of the Provincial Party Committee by the crescent Lake.

It was already past midnight, but song Qiming’s family was still awake. The three of them were waiting in the living room.

The popular soap opera of the season was playing on the television, but even Fang Liyun, who loved to watch dramas, was not in the mood to watch it. She would ask song Qiming every few minutes to know if the results from the capital were out.

Song Wei was also very nervous. Although she did not say anything, her fingers were constantly moving. The hem of her clothes was wrinkled from her pinching.

Song Qiming could not stand Fang Liyun’s constant urging. He could not help but say,””Liyun, can you stop and watch TV? I’ve already told you that professor Zhu will inform me as soon as he has any results. ”

“Can’t you just call and ask?” Fang Liyun said.

Song Qiming smiled bitterly.”Professor Zhu is also in the laboratory doing a blood test for Weiwei. Do you think it’s appropriate to call him now?”

Fang Liyun felt that it made sense. She smiled embarrassedly and said,”Then forget it, let him focus on his work!”

Although she said that, Fang Liyun was still restless. She stood up and paced around from time to time. Song Wei, who was a little nervous, couldn’t help but laugh,”Mom ... Can you stop for a while? Sit down and drink some water!”

Fang Liyun could not help but roll her eyes at her daughter and said,””You child ... How can you say that! You’re so rude ...”

Song Qiming took a sip of hot tea and said,””I think Weiwei is right. You ... You should stop for a while. I’m getting dizzy from all the spinning!”

“AI! “Old song, you’re getting bolder ...” Fang Liyun could not help but feign anger.”Do you think that if you become the Provincial Party Committee’s Deputy Secretary, you’ll ...”

At that moment, song Qiming’s phone rang. He quickly stopped Fang Liyun from continuing. “It’s professor Zhu. I think the results are out. ”

“Quickly answer it!” Fang Liyun said anxiously.

Song Qiming nodded. He took a deep breath and answered the call.”Professor Zhu, how are you?”

“Secretary song, it’s so late, I hope I didn’t disturb you,” professor Zhu said excitedly.

“Our family is waiting for the results from your side!” Song Qiming asked,”professor Zhu, are the test results out?” How’s the situation?”

“Secretary song, the situation is far beyond our expectations!” Professor Zhu said. There shouldn’t be any problem with the blood sample collected by the People’s Hospital of the southeast province, right?”

Song Qiming frowned and said,””That’s not very likely. The director of their Laboratory Department came to my house personally to collect a blood sample for Weiwei and then sent it to Beijing without stopping. Professor Zhu, is there a problem with the results?”

Fang Liyun and Song Wei were nervous when they heard that. Fang Liyun was even more anxious because she could not hear what professor Zhu was saying on the other end of the phone. She kept signaling song Qiming to turn on the speaker.

Song Qiming shook his head helplessly and turned on the speaker. He then placed his phone on the coffee table. Fang Liyun and Song Wei immediately came over.

He heard professor Zhu’s voice from the phone,””Secretary song, the situation is a little complicated ... We detected that the trace elements in Song Wei’s blood are close to normal levels. Although there are some abnormalities, the deviation is not much. Even compared to the blood samples that Song Wei had when she was hospitalized, the indicators are much better. This may mean that we have taken a wrong turn in our previous work. The proportion of trace elements may not be able to be a definite indicator of the infection of this poison ...”

“No, no, no! Professor Zhu, I believe that your previous results are correct!” Song Qiming said agitatedly,”based on the condition of Weiwei’s blood sample, it’s very likely that her infection level is decreasing. Her condition has improved!”

Fang Liyun and Song Wei were also surprised.

On the other end of the phone, professor Zhu was quite shocked.””Secretary song, you ... You must be joking! How could this be ...”

At this point, professor Zhu also realized that he had made a mistake and quickly explained,””I’m sorry, Secretary song. I don’t mean anything else. Of course, I hope that Song Wei can recover as soon as possible, but this poison is very strange. Many experts in 301 have been studying its pathogenic mechanism and infectivity, but there has been no progress. Also, from the previous cases, the possibility of self – Healing is almost non – existent! So ...”

Song Qiming chuckled.”Professor Zhu, I understand, I understand. You don’t have to explain ... Actually, after Weiwei was discharged from Room 301, we have been trying to give her traditional Chinese medicine treatment. The recent treatment should be effective. She has not been in a coma for more than twenty days ...”

Professor Zhu was even more surprised.””Chinese medicine? This ... This is unbelievable!”

“Professor Zhu, how about this?” song Qiming said with a smile. Weiwei may need to see the Chinese medicine doctor for a follow – up examination in the next two days. I’ll ask her to go to Beijing in two days, and you can help her check carefully again! Do whatever you want, as long as you don’t treat her like a lab rat!”

Song Qiming’s mood became much more relaxed when he saw that Song Wei’s condition had improved greatly from the blood test. He even joked with professor Zhu on the phone.

Professor Zhu couldn’t help but laugh. Song Wei was the daughter of a provincial government official. Who would dare to use her as a lab rat?

“Secretary song, if I may ask, can you tell me which Chinese medicine master treated Song Wei?” professor Zhu asked. I hope to invite him to 301 to help us overcome this poison ...”

“Professor Zhu, this doctor has always kept a low profile and doesn’t like to show his face in public. I’m afraid ...” Song Qiming said.

“Secretary song, if you really can’t do it, I can call your provincial health department through the central Health Bureau and ask this Chinese medicine master for help!” Professor Zhu said.

He was very confident. He was an expert at the central Health Bureau. In his opinion, as long as they were doctors, they would definitely be under the jurisdiction of the health department. They couldn’t disobey the orders of the health department!

When song Qiming heard that, he immediately said seriously,””Professor Zhu, I’ll communicate with this doctor as soon as possible and ask for his opinion. But if he’s not willing to show up, I don’t want to see any forced actions like an administrative order!”

At this point, song Qiming paused for a moment and said meaningfully,””What I can tell you is that even if it’s an executive order, it doesn’t have any effect on this doctor.”
