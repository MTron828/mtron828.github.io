3052 Gathering at peach source Island (2)

Translator: 5496903This Guiyuan Scripture was comparable to the complete and advanced version of the Guiyuan Scripture that Li Yifu had practiced for most of his life. After Li Yifu got the Guiyuan Scripture, he could naturally link it seamlessly. Moreover, some of the confusion in cultivation caused by the loss of the cultivation method before could be easily solved after he got the Guiyuan Scripture.

Xia ruofei taught Tang Haoran the third level of the “fierce yang Scripture” in front of everyone.

After Tang Haoran started cultivating, his memory was much better than ordinary people ‘s. Xia ruofei had only explained the obscure cultivation technique two or three times and he had basically memorized it.

Xia ruofei did not expect Tang Haoran to be able to recite it backwards. Seeing that he had memorized most of the content, he began to explain the third level of the cultivation technique. He analyzed it word by word for Tang Haoran.

That way, on the basis of understanding, Tang Haoran’s memory of the third level of the cultivation method would naturally be more solid.

After Xia ruofei finished, he let Tang Haoran comprehend it on his own and answered a few of his questions.

Then, Xia ruofei asked Tang Haoran to recite the third level of the technique again. He was indeed very familiar with it and there were no mistakes.

At this time, the water on Li Yifu’s side was already boiling.

Xia ruofei patted Tang Haoran’s head and said approvingly,””Haoran, you really didn’t let master down! You don’t need to cultivate the third level right now. You just need to remember it and understand it. After you break through, everything will fall into place naturally and you can just change to cultivating the third level of the cultivation technique!”

“Understood!” Tang Haoran said,”don’t worry, master! I’ll remember it all!”

“En!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”everyone, come and sit here! Let’s have some tea first!”

Ling Qingxue saw that Xia ruofei really took out a small bag of tea leaves and started to fiddle with the tea set. It looked like he really wanted to make tea. She could not help but laugh.

However, since Xia ruofei wanted to keep her in suspense, Ling Qingxue let him be. She knew that since Xia ruofei had gathered everyone together and said that he had a surprise for everyone, the truth would be revealed sooner or later.

Xia ruofei used the boiling water from the spirit pool to heat up the tea set. Then, he poured the wild tea that Chen Xuan had given him into a lid bowl. After that, he poured the spirit pool water into the lid bowl.

Immediately, a strong fragrance of Tea Rose in the cabin.

Even Tang Haoran couldn’t help but sniffle.””Master! It smells so good!”

The wild tea could be drunk directly from the first brew, and there was no process of washing the tea.

Moreover, the first brew was the essence of the wild tea. Hence, after a few seconds, Xia ruofei placed the tea container on the public cup and poured the brewed tea into the public cup.

Then, Xia ruofei poured the tea from the public cup into the tea tasting cup smoothly. There were exactly five cups.

To be honest, even song Wei and Ling Qingxue, who had seen a lot of good tea, felt that the tea was extremely tempting. As soon as Xia ruofei poured the tea, Ling Qingxue could not wait to try it.

However, Xia ruofei raised his hand to stop her and said,””Before I taste the tea, let me say a few words ...”

Everyone’s eyes were on Xia ruofei. He then said,””After drinking this cup of tea, everyone may have some wonderful experiences. Remember, don’t try to resist, just follow your heart! For example, if he wanted to cultivate, he could immediately sit down and cultivate. The spiritual Qi here is extremely dense, enough to sustain your cultivation. In addition, each of you should take a spiritual crystal in your hand in case you run out of spiritual energy!”

With that, Xia ruofei flipped his hand and took out four spiritual crystals. He gave one to each of them.

The flying boat was parked in the Taixu xuanqing formation, and the spiritual Qi was naturally very rich. Under normal circumstances, it would be enough to sustain cultivation. Xia ruofei asked everyone to take a spiritual crystal in case of emergency. After all, the four of them were Qi refining cultivators. After drinking wild tea, they would definitely be able to advance one level. Several Qi refining cultivators broke through at the same time, and it might consume a lot of spiritual Qi instantly. It was naturally safer to have a spiritual crystal in hand.

Besides, Xia ruofei was also worried that Li Yifu and Tang Haoran would not be able to let go. For example, Li Yifu felt that it was strange for him to sit down and cultivate all of a sudden with the elders present. If he forced himself to hold back, it would be a waste of the wild tea.

Of course, this was also a precaution. It could be considered as a preventive measure! Actually, from Xia ruofei’s experience, after drinking wild tea for the first time, he could not help but enter a state of cultivation. It was difficult for him to control himself.

Ling Qingxue’s eyes lit up when she heard that.””Ruofei, this means that your tea leaves are a little different! It can improve cultivation?”

Xia ruofei smiled but did not answer directly. Instead, he looked at Song Wei and Ling Qingxue and said,””You two ... Follow me to the cabin next door and bring some tea over!”

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue looked at each other and felt their faces heat up. However, they were even more certain that the tea was the tea that could help them improve their cultivation. After all, the most efficient way to cultivate the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” was to practice with Xia ruofei. Moreover, the state of cultivation was a little embarrassing. This was why Xia ruofei had asked them to go to the cabin next door.

“I know!” Ling Qingxue and Song Wei’s eyes revealed a hint of joy as they spoke at the same time.

Xia ruofei looked around and asked,””Do you all remember what I just said?”

“I’ll remember! Master!” Tang Haoran answered.

“Senior granduncle, this disciple will remember!” Li Yifu quickly added,

Ling Qingxue giggled and said,””Don’t worry! I have you here, don’t I?”

“Mm! Then each of us will get a cup of tea!” Xia ruofei said.

After he finished speaking, he also picked up one of the glasses and drank it in one gulp. Then, he revealed a reminiscing expression and said,””It’s really good tea ...”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but open her eyes wide and say,””You gave me so many instructions, so why did you just drink it so casually?”

“Because I’m an Aurous core stage cultivator!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”this is just normal tea to me! Hurry up and improve your cultivation, then you’ll be able to drink this tea like it’s water, just like me!”

Xia ruofei was just teasing Ling Qingxue because she didn’t know about wild tea. Of course, that wasn’t the case.

“I’m so angry!” Ling Qingxue clenched her fists. If the “junior” wasn’t present, she would have pounced on Xia ruofei and punched him.

Li Yifu and Tang Haoran obediently waited for Song Wei and Ling Qingxue to bring their respective tea before they each took a cup.

Xia ruofei brought Ling Qingxue and Song Wei to the cabin next door. Before he left, he looked at Li Yifu and Tang Haoran and said,””Don’t be nervous, just drink it in one gulp!”

“Yes! Senior granduncle!”

“Yes! Master!”

The three of them went to the cabin next door. Xia ruofei set up the time array flag and said,””You can’t drink tea at the same time. You can discuss who will go first!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Weiwei, you go first!”

“Let Qingxue drink first!”

The two of them spoke almost at the same time, and then immediately looked at each other and smiled.

Xia ruofei crossed his arms in front of his chest and stood at the side without participating. He would let them discuss how to solve Wanwan’s problem on their own. They couldn’t be biased, or they would be seeking their own deaths.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue discussed for a while. In the end, Song Wei convinced Ling Qingxue to drink the wild tea first.

Ling Qingxue held the teacup and asked nervously,””Ruofei, how do we drink it?”

“Use your mouth to drink!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”do I need to teach you how to drink tea?”

“This is tea that promotes cultivation! I’ve never drunk it before!” Ling Qingxue pouted.

However, with Xia ruofei’s teasing, she was not as nervous as before. She raised her head and finished the tea in one gulp.
