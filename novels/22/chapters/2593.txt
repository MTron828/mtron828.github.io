Liu Lifang was immediately indignant when she heard that. She shouted in exasperation,””What do you mean by that! He’s relying on me!”

Liu Lifang didn’t dare to act rashly in front of Liu Qunfeng because of the prestige he had built up in the family over the years. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that even though Liu Lifang was elder Liu’s daughter, Liu Qunfeng could easily take away everything she had now, including power, status, wealth, and even freedom ...

In front of Xia ruofei, Liu Lifang’s unruly behavior as a Princess from a wealthy family could not help but reveal itself.

“Shut up!” “You’re the one who caused all this trouble,” Liu Qunfeng yelled.”Do you still think you’re in the right?”

Liu Lifang’s body trembled slightly, and her overbearing Shrew – like arrogance was immediately restrained. She lowered her head in fear and did not dare to speak anymore.

Xia ruofei laughed and waved at Liu Qunfeng. Then, he said to Liu Lifang,””You’re probably still very unconvinced, right?”

Liu Lifang raised her head, but when she felt Liu Qunfeng’s unkind gaze, she immediately retracted her gaze. However, the anger in her eyes did not diminish.

“I don’t dare!” She finally said. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

She was cursing madly in her heart,”if it wasn’t for big brother backing you up, you little Shrew would be nothing!”

Xia ruofei looked around with a faint smile on his face and said,””I think, just by touching the surface of the pill with her hand, the medicinal effect of the pill was completely lost. This kind of thing is not only unconvinced by her, I think everyone here also thinks that the credibility is very low, right?”

“No, no, no!” Liu Qunfeng quickly said. Mr. Xia, it’s very clear that Liu Lifang was the one who caused this! It has nothing to do with the quality of the medicine you provide!”

Xia ruofei shook his head and said,”it’s better to make things clear so that everyone won’t have a knot in their hearts.” The more you argue, the more clear it becomes!”

“This ...” Liu Qunfeng looked at Xia ruofei hesitantly. He did not know how Xia ruofei was going to explain this.

To be honest, Liu Qunfeng did have some doubts. After all, it was a little unreasonable for the drug to be lost just by touching it. However, old master Liu’s life was hanging by a thread. The only person who had the ability to pull old master Liu back from the gates of hell was Xia ruofei.

If he had a choice, Liu Qunfeng would not want to offend Xia ruofei no matter what. Even if this matter became a mess or Liu Lifang was at fault, it would be better than letting Xia ruofei have a grudge or even quit.

If Xia ruofei really left now, they would not be able to say anything. As long as Xia ruofei said “he’s too sick and helpless”, they wouldn’t be able to force him to help. Furthermore, with Liu Lifang’s brainless behavior, even if Xia ruofei backed out now, the Liu family could not blame Xia ruofei for the failure of the treatment.

With the song family backing Xia ruofei, the Liu family could not openly denounce Xia ruofei in this situation.

Xia ruofei was well aware of Liu Qunfeng’s intentions, but he had no intention of letting this matter become a mess. If he didn’t clear things up, how could he ask for benefits from the Liu family? The early healing effects had all been reduced to zero, and so many pills had lost their effectiveness. The petals of the spirit Heart Flower were very precious, so who was going to make up for these losses?

“I have a few questions to ask Ms. Liu,” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Liu Qunfeng sighed and said,””No problem, Mr. Xia, if you have any questions, please ask!”

Then, Liu Qunfeng turned to Liu Lifang and said,”Just answer whatever Mr. Xia asks you! You’re not allowed to hide anything, understand?”

Liu Lifang unwillingly nodded and said in a muffled voice,””I know ...”

Xia ruofei glanced at Liu Lifang and asked,””Eight days ago, you touched my pill for the first time. I think the effect should be very obvious, right? Otherwise, you wouldn’t have been so eager to come back the next day. ”

Liu Lifang’s eyes flickered as she said,”My rhinitis symptoms did improve. At that time, I thought it had something to do with the pill, so I came over the next day to verify it. But now, I think that it’s just my imagination. The improvement of my rhinitis is the result of my long – term medication ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh,”don’t you know whether it’s the effect of the pill or not?” Seven days ago, you touched every pill once. How could you not feel the obvious effect? If I’m not wrong, you used to have serious gastritis and gout, but these symptoms have disappeared now, right?”

Liu Lifang could not help but widen her eyes. The young man in front of her was like a demon to her. His eyes were so sharp that they seemed to be able to see through her heart. In front of him, she felt as if she had been stripped naked and had no secrets at all.

Liu Qunfeng’s eyes were sharp as he stared at Liu Lifang.”Answer Mr. Xia’s question! Don’t even think about hiding it! We all know that you have gastritis and gout. As long as you go to the hospital for a checkup, everything will be clear!”

Liu Lifang’s face was a little pale. In the end, she made up her mind and raised her head to meet Xia ruofei’s playful gaze. She straightened her neck and said,””Yes! My gastritis and gout symptoms have disappeared, but what evidence do you have to prove that it was because I touched the effects of the pill?”
