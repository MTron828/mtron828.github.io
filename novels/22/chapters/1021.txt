Translator: 549690339

The best way was to get one or two from Xia ruofei before the auction started.

After seeing the pictures and videos of the abalones, MA Xiong’s heart was already itching. As a native of Hong Kong and a super – rich man, MA Xiong had no resistance to the temptation of these high – Quality one – Head abalones.

Before he made the call, he was still thinking about how to phrase his words. After all, Xia ruofei’s abalones were going to be auctioned. He didn’t expect that before he could say anything, Xia ruofei would take the initiative to leave two for him. He was really good at dealing with people!

That was why MA Xiong was overjoyed.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Old master Ma, you’re too kind. This is what I should do. You’ve helped me so much!”

“It’s a win – win situation, a win – win situation ...” MA Xiong said with a bright smile.

“Haha, right, right, right, it’s a win – win situation!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Mr. MA, why don’t you pick some dried abalones when I come to Hong Kong?”

“Alright, alright.”

In fact, MA Xiong wanted to fly to San Shan to pick abalones right away. However, Xia ruofei would be going to Hong Kong with the abalones in a week or two. Besides, MA Xiong was a billionaire. It would damage his image if he was too impatient. So, he agreed to Xia ruofei’s suggestion.

After ending the call with MA Xiong, Xia ruofei took the initiative to tell Hu Zi’s mother about the situation.

When she heard that the abalones were sold for three million Chinese dollars each, she couldn’t help but be dumbfounded.

Hu Zi’s mother could imagine how precious these abalones were, but the sky – High price still overturned her understanding of prices. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Of course, after she came back to her senses, Hu Zi’s mother was happy for Xia ruofei. She really treated Xia ruofei like her own son now. She was genuinely happy that Xia ruofei’s career was booming.

Xia ruofei chatted with his godmother for a while. Seeing that it was still early and his godmother was about to start preparing lunch, he picked up his bag and walked towards the general office building not far away.

Since the abalones were going to be auctioned, the packaging would have to be redesigned. Although MA Xiong’s publicity team was very professional in this, Xia ruofei still wanted to train the designers in his company.

Xia ruofei did not look for Feng Jing. Instead, he went straight to the big office in the marketing department.

At the moment, the marketing department was in charge of advertising, sales, e – commerce, and other businesses. There was a special art team responsible for product packaging, promotional posters, online shops, and all other work related to graphic design.

As soon as Xia ruofei entered the office, he saw that everyone was working hard in the various booths. Some employees were in a hurry with folders in their hands.

Taoyuan company was a new agricultural product company. The average age of the employees was very low, and the company’s welfare benefits were very good, so everyone was very motivated, and the entire company’s internal atmosphere was very motivated.

Many employees were stunned when they saw Xia ruofei. Then, they immediately greeted him respectfully.

In the company, especially in the big offices of the lower departments, the employees were very surprised to see this Big Boss who was usually elusive.

“President Xia!”

“Hello, President Xia!”

Xia ruofei also smiled and nodded at them.

He went straight to the art design team’s office area. The marketing director, Xiao Qiang, quickly came out of his small cubicle and walked quickly to Xia ruofei.

“President Xia!” Xiao Qiang greeted him from afar.

The big boss almost never came down to the ground, so his sudden visit this time made Xiao Qiang a little nervous.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Director Xiao, it’s nothing. Go on with your work. I have a small design for the art team to help with.”

Xiao Qiang immediately heaved a sigh of relief and quickly shouted,””Little Zhong, come here!”

The head of the art team, Zhong Lingling, was a girl in her late twenties. She was working in front of a computer. She stood up and walked over quickly.

Zhong Lingling was wearing a simple T – Shirt and jeans, and her hair was tied into a ponytail. She still looked like a child.

However, she had a lot of experience in graphic design. She had been working in this field for four or five years after she graduated from secondary school.

She was also Lin Qiao’s mentor.

In fact, many people who worked in graphic design might not have a high educational background, and many of them were from secondary or technical schools. However, if they had strong professional skills, their salary would still be very good.

Zhong Lingling was the head of the art design team at paradise Corporation. With the bonus and benefits, she could earn at least seven to eight thousand Yuan a month, which was a high level that was hard for most of the secondary school graduates to reach.

Zhong Lingling came up to them and greeted,”Hello, President Xia! Hello, director Xiao!”

Xiao Qiang said,”little Zhong, President Xia has a design job for your art team. You must transfer the most capable people and bring out your unique skills. Do you understand?”

“Alright!” Zhong Lingling quickly replied.

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”it’s not that exaggerated. It’s just a small task. It’s very easy.” I’ll just take a look around and talk to Lingling about work. ”

Xiao Qiang definitely wanted to accompany Xia ruofei, but since the boss had spoken, he could only nod and say,””Alright, President Xia. Call me if you need anything!”
