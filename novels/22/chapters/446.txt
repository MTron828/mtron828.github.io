Chapter 447: Elder song’s big gift (1)

“Sis Wu, so you know song Rui!” Xia ruofei was surprised.

Xia ruofei did not introduce song Rui to the guests during the event. The guests thought that song Rui was just Xia ruofei’s brother from a rich family.

He did not expect Wu Liqian to recognize song Rui.

Wu Liqian smiled.”I went to Hunan Province with Secretary Tian in my early years. I met the family of the provincial head judge, Song Jin, once. But I’m sure you don’t remember me anymore.”

Xia ruofei suddenly realized that song Rui’s identity in Xiang Nan Province was the top son of the rich and powerful! To put it bluntly, even the son of xiangnan’s Secretary wasn’t as impressive as him. After all, he was the eldest son and grandson of the song family! Therefore, song Rui had countless social events all year round. He had only had a meal with Wu Liqian once, so it was normal for him to not remember.

“Before the ceremony began, I accidentally overheard your conversation,” Wu Liqian continued.”I know that this painting was specially created by elder song for you. I couldn’t help but be curious and want to take a look.”

This time, it was Ling Qingxue’s turn to be confused.

“County Head Wu, the elder song you mentioned ...” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“You should ask your boyfriend!” Wu Liqian said with a smile. He knows such a powerful chief, but he didn’t report to you. This shouldn’t be!”

Wu Liqian glanced at Xia ruofei with a half – Smile and Xia ruofei could only laugh awkwardly.

Ling Qingxue had been subconsciously hostile towards Wu Liqian at first, but after a few words, the hostility gradually disappeared, especially after Wu Liqian’s joke. Ling Qingxue was very pleased.

Ling Qingxue smiled at Wu Liqian and said,””County Head Wu, he never tells me these things. Why don’t you tell me? Which bureau chief is this elder song?”

“Qingxue, did you watch the news a few years ago?” Wu Liqian asked.

Ling Qingxue was stunned for a moment before she nodded and said,””I do occasionally.”

There were only a handful of people in China who had never watched the news broadcast. Although many people did not have the habit of watching it on time every day, they would definitely have seen it on different occasions.

“Then you should have seen the chief I just mentioned on TV ...” Wu Liqian said.

Ling Qingxue was also a smart girl. Since she would occasionally see that chief on the news, it must be one of the top few Chiefs in the core. There were only a dozen Chiefs in the core leadership in the two terms, and only one of them had the surname song ...

Ling Qingxue’s mind raced, and she opened her mouth wide in surprise.””Could it be song ...”

“Stop guessing, it’s him!” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and said,”elder song has been recuperating in Sanshan city. I’ve met him a few times.”

Wu Liqian thought to herself,”it’s not as simple as just meeting him a few times. Elder song would not personally write an inscription for a young man he has only met a few times.”

However, Wu Liqian naturally wouldn’t reveal it, and Ling Qingxue didn’t think there was anything wrong with her words. After all, she didn’t know how precious elder song’s inscription was.

But that was the head judge of the Central District! Meeting a few times was already a very amazing thing! Moreover, the chief had even written an inscription for Xia ruofei. Ling Qingxue could not help but feel proud of her boyfriend.

At the same time, she subconsciously held the paper box tighter.

Ling Qingxue then thought of another matter and couldn’t help but ask,””Ruofei, does this mean that song Rui ...”

Ling Qingxue felt like she was in a dream. Song Rui’s mental age was probably younger than Xia ruofei ‘s, and he was not arrogant at all. He was always smiling and polite to people. She couldn’t believe that the young man who called her sister – in – Law just now had such a prominent identity.

In fact, Ling Qingxue had never seen the other side of song Rui. He only hid his naughty side because of Xia ruofei. After all, it was the ribbon – cutting ceremony for Xia ruofei’s new company building! In fact, song Rui was quite famous among the red disciples in the capital. He was just a bad boy who didn’t know how to get along.

“He is elder song’s grandson.” Xia ruofei said casually and then jokingly said,”don’t look like that! Actually, this grandson is quite a good person ...”

Ling Qingxue and Wu Liqian couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

Ling Qingxue rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,””Why do your words sound so bad? He’s elder song’s grandson!”

Xia ruofei shrugged innocently.””I didn’t say that he’s my grandson!”

Wu Liqian was laughing so hard that she could barely stand up straight. Ling Qingxue could not help but secretly pinch Xia ruofei and said,””How can you be so bad! Song Rui will be furious if he hears this ...”

“He’s elder song’s grandson!” Xia ruofei said in all seriousness. Then, he looked at Ling Qingxue with a smirk and said,”besides, I don’t even have a son! How could he have such an old grandson? You’re the one who thought of that!”

Ling Qingxue blushed and said,””I know you’re good at talking! I can’t be bothered to talk to you ...”

Wu Liqian couldn’t stand it anymore. She said,””Alright, alright! If the two of you want to flirt, can’t you wait until I’m gone? Why don’t you consider my feelings as a single person ...”
