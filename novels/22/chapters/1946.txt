1947 Showing off their acting skills (2)

They consoled themselves by thinking,”even if I didn’t succeed this time, I’ll definitely be able to succeed next time. As long as I’m still on the working group, I’ll definitely have a chance!”

“President Xia, we’ll take our leave first!” Wu Liqian said,”we’ll come up with a new preferential policy as soon as possible. I hope both sides can reach a consensus by then!”

“Then I’ll wait for the good news!” Xia ruofei stood up and smiled.

He personally sent Wu Liqian and the others downstairs, which could be said to be full of etiquette.

Xia ruofei watched as Wu Liqian’s car left the peach blossom mansion. He couldn’t help but think of the scene in the morning ...

As soon as he arrived at the office on the 15th floor of Taoyuan building, he received a call from Wu Liqian.

“Sister Qian, why are you up so early?” Xia ruofei joked,”you were so tired yesterday. You should have a beauty sleep today, right?”

“You’ve given me so many things to do, how can I sleep!” Wu Liqian smiled and said,”ruofei, I’m going to call for a meeting with the members of the working group later. Let’s cut to the chase!”

Xia ruofei stopped joking and asked,””Sister Qian, why did you call me so urgently? is there something wrong?”

“Today, I’ll officially start to get involved in the project to bring in the Paradise pharmaceutical factory.” Wu Liqian said,”I’ll mobilize the team and divide the work. Then I’ll get someone to contact your company and request a meeting to discuss!”

Xia ruofei replied casually,”no problem!” I’ve already informed the people below, just bring your people over! Since sister Qian is back in charge of this work, it doesn’t matter if we talk about it or not. We’ll just go through the motions, sign the letter of intent, and you can just wait to receive your political achievements!”

“I knew you would be like this,” Wu Liqian said coyly.”I called you first!”

“What’s wrong? Is there something wrong?” Xia ruofei asked in confusion.

“Of course it’s wrong!” Wu Liqian said. I’m telling you, during our meeting today, you have to express your dissatisfaction with Changping’s offer. It’s best if you compare it with the offers from other places, and then I’ll fight for a bigger offer for you!”

“Ah?” Xia ruofei was stunned.”To be fair, the preferential policy that Changping County has given us is actually quite good!”

“If I were in charge of the negotiations from the start, I would also think that this preferential policy plan is not bad!” Wu Liqian said,”but the situation is changing every day. Based on the current situation, you can totally ask for more benefits and support! And Secretary Zeng and County Head Zhu will definitely do their best to make it happen!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh and teased,””Sister Qian, this isn’t your style! You’ve always had a high level of awareness, why are you helping an outsider today?”

Wu Liqian could not help but ask,””So you’re treating yourself as an outsider! RUO Fei, what you said makes me very sad!”

“I didn’t mean it that way!” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.

Wu Liqian laughed and said,”I’ll get you more discounts.” Pretentious!”

“Of course, the more preferential policies, the better!” Xia ruofei said,”but you’re now in charge of bringing in this investment. The smaller the cost, the better your results will be, right?”

“You don’t have to worry about that! As long as I can successfully complete this project, it will be my greatest achievement! “As for the price, there’s basically no difference in the system. This is not a private company, so there’s no KPI or anything!” Wu Liqian said,”it’s mainly because there was a problem with what Changping County did. If Secretary Zeng had been more determined from the beginning, I think the pharmaceutical factory would have already started construction! Therefore, we have to pay a little more price to teach them a lesson and make them remember!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”sure!” I quite agree with this! We’ll do as you say!”

Hence, Xia ruofei and Wu Liqian’s question and answer session in the conference room of the Tao Yuan building in the morning had actually been discussed over the phone and even rehearsed. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The two of them put on a show together. Other than Shi Qingyuan and the other members of the Changping County Task Force, Feng Jing, Xue Jinshan, and the others were also kept in the dark.

They followed Xia ruofei to see Wu Liqian off.

After the car left the Tao Yuan building, Feng Jing smiled and said,””Chairman, you’re taking advantage of the situation! Aren’t you afraid that Changping County will be eliminated and not play?”

Xia ruofei shrugged and laughed.””I don’t care! Even if they don’t want to play, there are plenty of people who are willing to play with us! Moreover, it’s not like we’re taking money out of their personal pockets to subsidize the company. They won’t be angry. They’ll only do their best to help us fight for it in a higher level organization! After all, they’re more eager to get this project than anyone else!”

“You’re right!” Feng Jing said,”but Mayor Wu is your friend! You’re even taking advantage of your friends ...”

“How am I scamming her! I’m clearly helping her, okay?” Xia ruofei said,”at first, Changping County was already eliminated. Now that she’s back, I’ve given them another chance to enter the arena. This is the greatest result!”

“Fine, fine, fine. You’re right anyway!” Feng Rao smiled and said,”by the way, Chairman, don’t forget about the Hong Kong auction the day after tomorrow! That’s the most important item of all, and all of our auction items are prepared by you! The promotion has been going on for a few days now, and everyone in Hong Kong is watching us with wide eyes! If you screw up at the critical moment, you’ll be embarrassed!”

“AI! CEO Feng, I don’t like what you’re saying!” Xue Jinshan said,”why is it that you lost a great deal because of a small gain? The pharmaceutical factory is also a big deal, okay?”

Feng Rao couldn’t help but burst into laughter.”I forgot that factory manager Xue is here too ... Right, right, right, the pharmaceutical factory is a big deal too. We must take it seriously!”

“Why do I feel like you’re being perfunctory ...” Xue Jinshan said with a depressed expression, causing everyone to burst into laughter.

Actually, Xue Jinshan was mostly joking. He also knew that the pharmaceutical factory project would most likely fall in Changping. The previous inspection was just a smokescreen. Now that the negotiation for this project was very close to success, his mood was naturally quite bright.

……

It turned out that Wu Liqian’s analysis was quite accurate.

After she went back, she reported to Zhu zhihang and Zeng jianzhang that the leader and vice leader of the Changping team quickly decided to give paradise company more preferential policies. They were really eager to introduce this project.

The three of them had a small meeting in Zeng jianzhang’s office and roughly decided on a new discount plan.

In this new plan, the preferential rate of land transfer would be increased from 30% to 50%. In other words, the Paradise company could use 50% of the base price of industrial land in that year to get the land they needed.

The tax preferential treatment was directly reduced from a complete exemption for the first three years, and a 40% discount for the next two years to a complete exemption for five years.

In terms of basic facilities, Changping County had once again given them preferential treatment. As a result, the profits of the power companies and water companies might decrease a lot, but they couldn’t care so much now.

Of course, in the previous plan, Changping County would be responsible for the basic facilities, but this required the peach blossom company to pay for the construction. If the price in this area was discounted, the amount of funds that the peach blossom company needed to pay would naturally be less.

The land transfer fee could also be paid for a long time, divided into three years.

Zeng jianzhang even proposed that if the Paradise company was still not satisfied, they would promise to give preferential electricity prices within three years.

One had to know that once the Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory was built, with their snowflakes of orders, they would basically be working 24 hours a day. With so many production lines running together, the consumption of electricity was also huge. Even if the electricity was discounted by 10 cents and 50 cents per kilowatt – hour, it would still be a rather large figure in a year.

This was equivalent to cutting a piece of meat from the power system. Only a senior secretary like Zeng jianzhang had the ability to coordinate it successfully!

Although this was not included in the new plan, they had a “mole”, Wu Liqian, among them. This electricity bill discount policy was most likely inevitable ...
