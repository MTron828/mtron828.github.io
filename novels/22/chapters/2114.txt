Seeing this, Xia ruofei laughed and said,””Then ... Everyone, write down the order in your mind! From left to right, they’re No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3!”

The plates were long and had some patterns on them. Gore’s plate placement was fixed, so even though they were sitting face to face, the foie gras in front of them and the corresponding position of the sample were the same.

Bastian, who was sitting opposite Cheng Xiaoxiao, personally ran to the cashier to get a few pens and paper notes, and handed them out to each of them.

Xia ruofei jokingly said,”everyone, do it on your own!” You’re not allowed to look around ...”

“Of course! Food tasting is a very serious matter!” Gore said seriously.

The four of them already had an answer, so they quickly wrote it down.

Xia ruofei put the four people’s conclusions together and everyone came over to take a look.

The foie gras with the best taste, the four people voted for No. 3 at the same time.

As for those ranked second and third, their opinions were not so unified.

The second place had three votes for foie gras No. 1 and one vote for foie gras No. 2.

The third place was naturally foie gras No. 1 with one vote and foie gras No. 2 with three votes.

With that, the ranking was out.

From the first to the third place, they were No. 3, No. 1, and No. 2. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Moreover, No. 3 was “elected by all votes”, which could be said to be well – deserved.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Mr. Gore, can you reveal your answer now?” Which samples did these three foie gras come from?”

“Haha!” Goer laughed and said,”Mr. Xia, I believe you’ve already guessed it. This No. 3 foie gras is the best and heaviest sample No. 8!” Foie gras No. 1 is from sample No. 6, and foie gras No. 2 is from sample No. 9!”

Bastian immediately smiled and said,”Mr. Xia, congratulations! “Obviously, your company’s cultivation experiment has achieved perfect results. Sample No. 8 is almost flawless in terms of appearance, taste, weight, and all other aspects! I believe we’ll be able to see your company’s new product soon!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”This is just the preliminary test. There’s still a long way to go before we can start large – scale breeding.”

Xia ruofei wasn’t being modest. The foie gras were grown in the spirit map space which was rich in spiritual energy. Large – scale cultivation had to be carried out in the outside world. By then, it was still unknown whether the data would be so perfect and whether the taste would be so good. Moreover, the Chinese medicine had to be mass – produced to ensure the requirements for large – scale cultivation. All these had to be completed step by step.

“Hahaha! The most important core technology has been solved, it’s only a matter of time!” Bastian said,”when your company’s foie gras goes on sale, you must remember our corner Western restaurant!”

“Of course!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I won’t forget the help that Mr. Bastian and Mr. Gore provided me during the research and development process!”

Cheng Xiaoxiao, who was listening on the side, was confused and only came back to her senses now. She asked in surprise,””President Xia, was this foie gras produced by the Paradise Corporation?”

“Yup! We’re trying to develop high – Quality foie gras. We’ve just had some results, so we wanted to come and verify it!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Xiaoxiao, you’ve finally participated in our experiment!”

“President Xia, you’re amazing!” Cheng Xiaoxiao didn’t hide her admiration at all.”Jade skin cream, heart – nourishing soup, top – grade abalone, truffle, tea leaves, Cordyceps ... All of them are high – end luxury products. Now, there’s foie gras, which is also known as the ‘gold on the table’. You’re trying to monopolize the high – end food market!”

Cheng Xiaoxiao was indeed Xia ruofei’s die – hard fan. She had a deep understanding of the peach blossom company and knew its products like the back of her hand. Moreover, as a girl, she didn’t hesitate to put the jaded skin cream as her first priority.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it’s not that exaggerated!” In fact, I just learned about the production process of goose liver, so I had an idea. I hoped to find a way to make the goose not experience that kind of pain in the process of growing. So I tried to study it, and I didn’t expect the effect to be so good!”

Xia ruofei and Cheng Xiaoxiao were communicating in Chinese, so Gore naturally couldn’t understand, but Bastian could hear it clearly. He was stunned for a moment, then asked in shock,””What? Mr. Xia, you’re saying ... The foie gras samples today were not produced by traditional feeding methods?”

“Of course, I just can’t stand this kind of production process, so I want to improve it!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”otherwise, what’s the point of adding another product like foie gras? It’s just that more geese will have to suffer such a tragic life!”

“How ... How is this possible?” Bastian was dumbfounded.”Foie gras can’t be so fat if it’s fed normally ...”

Of course, he knew very well that Xia ruofei had no reason to lie to him, so he immediately sighed.””Mr. Xia, this is really amazing!”

Cheng Xiaoxiao was confused and couldn’t help but ask,””Mr. Bastian, what’s the stuffing method? How is it cruel?”

“It’s nothing ...”Xia ruofei quickly replied.

However, Bastian was already the first to speak.”Xiaoxiao, foie gras is known as the cruelest delicacy, mainly because of its production process ...”

Xia ruofei could not help but smile bitterly as he watched Bastian describe the tragic experience of a goose from birth to being slaughtered.

Xia ruofei’s guess was not wrong. Although Cheng Xiaoxiao had learned a lot about Western food, it was obvious that the books she had read did not describe the production process of foie gras.

After hearing this, Cheng Xiaoxiao’s face became paler and paler, and then she suddenly covered her mouth and retched.

Xia ruofei quickly stopped Bastian from continuing, then said,””Xiaoxiao, you definitely didn’t use this method when you ate foie gras today! It’s from a normal farm ...”

Only then did Cheng Xiaoxiao feel a little better. She grabbed the cup and took a sip of water, then said,””I won’t eat foie gras anymore ... No, I’ll only eat the foie gras produced by paradise Corporation!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”Then I’ll thank you for your support ...”

Xia ruofei stood up and said,””Mr. Bastian, Mr. Gore, thank you very much for your help. I’ll take my leave first. By the way, please keep our company’s attempt to cultivate foie gras a secret, as well as our different production process from the traditional ones. ”

“Of course, of course ...” Bastian quickly said.

Xia ruofei smiled and looked at Cheng Xiaoxiao, who was still a little pale.””Xiaoxiao, there are still a few samples of our foie gras in the kitchen. You can try them again in the next two days. Otherwise, according to what you said, if you don’t eat other foie gras, I’m afraid it will take at least a few months for our company to start selling foie gras.”

Cheng Xiaoxiao said, a little embarrassed,””I understand. Thank you, President Xia!”

Xia ruofei greeted Cheng Xiaoxiao and the others, then left the Western restaurant around the corner and drove the Knight XV off – Road vehicle to the Taoyuan building.

In his chairman’s office, he used his mobile phone to call the factory director of the pharmaceutical factory, Xue Jinshan.

“Chairman!” Xue Jinshan quickly picked up the phone.

Xia ruofei heard the background noise from Xue Jinshan and asked with a smile,””Kanayama, are you at the factory site?”

“Yup!” Xue Jinshan said,”we have to keep an eye on this side. My main energy is on the construction of the sub – Plant!”

The manufacturing factory was not far from Taoyuan farm. Xia ruofei muttered to himself, then said,””How about this ... At 2:30 p.m., Come to the farm for a while ... In the small meeting room we used to have! I have something to talk to you about!”

“Okay, Chairman. I’ll be there on time!” Xue Jinshan immediately said.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”also, tell Cao tieshu that he’s going too!” I won’t call to inform you anymore!”

“Alright! Don’t worry!” Xue Jinshan said.
