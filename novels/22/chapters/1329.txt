Chapter 1330: The first appearance of the pomfrets (2)

Translator: 549690339

Whether it was the growing influence of Taoyuan vegetables, the popular Jushi cream, the top – grade abalone, or the Ironhide maple and Cordyceps that Tongren Hall was cooperating with, almost every product was of the highest quality and was at the peak of their field.

It was just that some of them had a smaller audience, while some faced a wider range of people, so society’s reactions were different.

Tang weiran realized that this young company had great potential in the future.

Xia ruofei was not just a young man with a strong background. He was definitely capable.

“You’re too kind, President Tang. ” Xia ruofei said humbly,”compared to a giant company like Tongren Tang, we are just a small company ...”

Tang weiran couldn’t help but feel that Xia ruofei was actually a very gentle young man most of the time. It was very comfortable to be with him. Of course, the premise was that they didn’t become his enemies.

Thinking of Chen shun and Chen Weinan, Tang weiran couldn’t help but feel a chill in her heart. This young man in front of her seemed harmless, but he was absolutely cold and ruthless to his enemies.

Even if they couldn’t be friends, they should never go against such a person.

Of course, it would be even better if they could become friends.

Just look at the current Lin Zhongming.

Tang weiran even envied Lin Zhongming, who was much lower in rank than him in the group. It was really a stroke of luck for him to be favored and taken care of by Xia ruofei!

Just as everyone was chatting, Tang weiran’s phone vibrated.

Tang weiran apologized to Xia ruofei and walked out of the conference room to answer the call.

After a while, Tang weiran returned to the meeting room.

He said to Xia ruofei,”Mr. Xia, I just received a call from the company. We’ve basically confirmed that Chen shun was negligent in his duties during the negotiation. In addition, he also confessed that in the past two years, he had asked for commissions from the suppliers and accepted commercial bribes. Our initial punishment is to fire him. According to the follow – up investigation, we will decide whether to report this to the economic Investigation Department.”

Tang weiran paused and continued,””Chen shun’s uncle, Chen Weinan, also has to take the main responsibility as the leader in this incident. He also used his position to benefit his relatives and broke the rules to solve Chen shun’s staff problem. We’ve basically confirmed this, but his punishment will still need to be further investigated before the group will decide.”

“President Tang, your Discipline Inspection department is very efficient!” Xia ruofei smiled.

“President Xia, it’s just a matter of making up for it. No matter how well we do it, it can’t cover up the problem of poor internal management in our group,” said Tang weiran. I still have to represent the corporation here, yes ...”

“President Tang, it’s not a big deal. You don’t have to keep apologizing.” Xia ruofei waved his hand and interrupted Tang weiran.”We’re partners now! In the future, we’ll still need everyone to work together and cooperate sincerely!”

“Yes, yes, yes! Let’s work together!” Tang Wei Ran quickly said.

A huge weight had finally been lifted off his chest. It was obvious that Xia ruofei was very satisfied with this result. Moreover, the collaboration between Tongren Hall and peach blossom company was not affected. He even established some personal relationships with Xia ruofei. He had exceeded the task that Wei Jianming had given him.

In this happy atmosphere, everyone naturally chatted very enthusiastically.

It was almost lunchtime when Liu Qian walked to Xia ruofei’s side and whispered a few words into his ear.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. He stood up and said,””President Tang, big brother Lin, the cafeteria is ready. Let’s go over and continue our chat!”

“Oh? I’ve been itching for President Xia’s new product for a long time!” Tang weiran laughed and stood up.”President Xia, you’re still keeping us in suspense ...”

Everyone laughed in cooperation.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Appropriate suspense is good for increasing curiosity. The facts have shown that I have been very successful. I believe that everyone will taste it more carefully and give us better suggestions!”

After a while, Xia ruofei and the others entered the staff canteen on the first floor.

Xia ruofei didn’t like to put on airs. Besides, he didn’t have to do things like welcoming and sending people off. Hence, there weren’t any private rooms in the staff cafeteria. Customers would eat in the main hall as usual, but there would be a round table in the corner of the cafeteria. The other employees would also eat in the main hall. Everyone was used to this way and didn’t interfere with each other. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

In fact, Xia ruofei was also excited.

Because the suspense he had prepared for everyone today was the wild Chinese perch.

The breeding of pomfrets had been going on for a long time, and the first batch of pomfrets could be sold.

Before this, Xia ruofei had never tasted Chinese perch. He had only learned about this legendary food that was on the verge of extinction and its history of being praised by scholars and poets through literature.

Pure wild species breeding, simulated wild environment breeding, precious spirit Heart Flower petal solution cultivation ... Under these conditions, could the Chang Jiang Kun fish be as delicious as described in the literature?

Xia ruofei was not confident.

Hence, Xia ruofei decided to give it a try before it went on sale.

Coincidentally, Tang weiran, Lin Zhongming, and the others were also there. Xia ruofei had made arrangements yesterday to let everyone have a taste today.

Moreover, he had specially called Ling Xiaotian and invited Su Yu, the Executive Head Chef of the lingji food and beverage group, early in the morning to personally cook this “King of fish.”

Su Yu was Ling Xiaotian’s old buddy. He had been employed when the lingji F & B group was still a small restaurant. Now, he was also a senior executive of the lingji F & B group and had even been given a small number of the group’s shares. He basically no longer participated in the front line of work.

However, he was from Sunan and had his own unique experience in cooking anchovy and pomfrets. Moreover, he had tasted the taste of wild Chinese perch when he was young and had learned how to deal with it from an old local chef. Therefore, he was the most suitable person to cook the Chinese perch.

Xia ruofei invited everyone to take a seat.

Tang weiran noticed that there were lots on the table and everyone was seated according to their names. He was arranged to sit on Xia ruofei’s right, while the seat on Xia ruofei’s left was empty. Lin Zhongming, Feng Jing, Zheng Xu, and the others were seated behind him.

Although Tang weiran felt a little strange that there was a space left, he didn’t say anything.

After everyone had taken their seats, Cao tieshu’s wife led the restaurant’s service staff to serve the cold and hot dishes. The Drunken Eight Immortals wine was also opened and poured into the wine divider. Everyone had a small pot in front of them.

To everyone’s surprise, Xia ruofei did not ask them to pour him wine or raise his glass. Instead, he sat in his seat and chatted.

Even Feng Jing didn’t know what Xia ruofei was up to. When Xia ruofei arranged for Su Yu to come over, he had directly informed the cafeteria and asked them to fully cooperate. As for Feng Jing, she had put almost all her energy into signing the contract with Tongren Hall, so she naturally wouldn’t take the initiative to ask about the matters in the cafeteria.

Hence, Feng Jing shot Xia ruofei a look, signaling for him to start the conversation.

After all, Xia ruofei was the host. If he didn’t say anything, no one would be able to move their chopsticks. Wouldn’t it be awkward if they continued to sit like this?

Xia ruofei just smiled and talked to everyone. Fortunately, the awkwardness didn’t last long. Soon, they heard footsteps.

Xia ruofei turned around and immediately smiled.””Uncle Su, come here! You’ve worked hard today!”

Su Yu was wearing a white chef’s uniform and a tall chef’s hat. He was personally carrying a large oval plate and walking over with a smile.

Su Yu said,”little Xia, you’re still being polite with me!” Besides ... It’s a great surprise for me to be able to make the Chinese perch again in my lifetime! There’s no such thing as hard work!”

Su Yu said as he placed the plate on the empty space reserved in the middle of the turntable on the table.

Everyone’s eyes fell on the steaming hot plate at the same time ...
