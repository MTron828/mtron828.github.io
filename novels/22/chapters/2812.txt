2813 Meeting for negotiation (2)

Ling Qingxue and Song Wei stopped at the same time when they saw Xia ruofei trying to hold back his laughter. Ling Qingxue said,”Weiwei, let’s not continue. Look at how smug a certain someone is.”

Xia ruofei quickly put on a straight face and said,””No, no! Qingxue was right, I’m a cultivator, what’s there to be proud of for winning against a group of ordinary people? Although ... I didn’t cheat with my true energy in the game, and it’s not certain that you can play football well as long as you practice, not to mention that it’s impossible to kick such a beautiful Barb without a little foundation ... But there’s really nothing to be proud of! Not surprising! It’s not surprising ...”

Although Xia ruofei said that there was nothing to be proud of, he could not help but show the pride on his face. Ling Qingxue and Song Wei could not help but laugh at the sight.

“Go back to your room!” “What are you doing in a girl’s room in the middle of the night?” Ling Qingxue said unhappily.

“Alright! The two beauties should rest early! I’m also going back to my room!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

He walked to the door and stopped. He turned around and said,””By the way, there’s a lunch party tomorrow afternoon. You guys can come with me!”

“Dinner? You have a dinner in Spain?” Ling Qingxue said,”you have quite a wide circle of friends!”

“What? The people from the Chinese Football Association are discussing with me about joining the national team!” Xia ruofei said,”I guess you’ll be watching the game in the same room today! He was received by Zhou leiyun this time. ”

Only then did Song Wei and Ling Qingxue remember the middle – aged man in the private room. Song Wei suddenly realized and said,””It’s him! If I remember correctly, that person should be the Vice President of the Chinese Football Association, Zhao Zhenghao!”

“That’s right!” Xia ruofei said,”she came all the way to Spain. It’s not appropriate if we don’t even meet, so I agreed. You two can come with me tomorrow!”

“RUO Fei’s face is quite big! Even the Vice President of the Chinese Football Association came to talk to you in person. ” Ling Qingxue said with a smile.

“It’s just like that! It’s not worth being proud of. ” Xia ruofei laughed as he scratched his head.

He walked out of the Two Women’s Room and went straight back to his own room.

In the away team’s locker room in nokapu, Xia ruofei had only taken a simple shower because he had to attend the press conference. After returning to his room, he went to the bathroom to take a hot bath, then changed into a sleeping robe and went to the bedroom, feeling comfortable. He took out another origin crystal and held it in his palm, then sat cross – legged and began to cultivate.

During this period of time, whenever Xia ruofei had free time, he would use it to cultivate. After all, there was no bottleneck in the stage of transforming genuine Qi into vitality. It was all about grinding.

Xia ruofei was looking forward to the improvement of his strength after he entered the Golden core stage. Therefore, he could not help but cultivate whenever he had time.

With his current cultivation base, he basically wouldn’t feel very tired after playing a match like tonight. He didn’t consume much energy, so sitting down to cultivate was naturally no problem.

……

The next morning, Xia ruofei woke up in high spirits and washed up. After having breakfast with Ling Qingxue and Song Wei, he took them out to shop.

They had just played a match yesterday and won an unexpected victory, so Ruby gave the whole team a day off. Even if Xia ruofei wanted to train with the team, he could not find anyone at the training base.

He had been here for so many days, but he hadn’t had the chance to spend time with Song Wei and Ling Qingxue in Barcelona. He was free this morning, so he took the two girls out.

They didn’t take a car, nor did they have a clear goal, because they didn’t need to go to all the famous attractions to clock in. They just wandered aimlessly on the streets of Barcelona, very relaxed.

To Xia ruofei’s surprise, there were many Spanish fans in the nearby area. As the three of them walked on the street, they met several groups of Spanish fans. They all recognized Xia ruofei, who had only appeared twice, and greeted him warmly. Some people politely asked for autographs and photos, and Xia ruofei satisfied all their requests.

The culture of the fans here was more mature. The fans did not rush up like a swarm of bees. After seeing Xia ruofei sign several names in a row, the other fans took the initiative to step back. They did not want to cause trouble for Xia ruofei.

However, it was Xia ruofei’s first time experiencing the troubles of being famous abroad. Even if the fans did not come up to disturb him, he could still feel all kinds of gazes. Some were curious, some were idolizing, some were admiring, some were happy ... Of course, there were also some gazes with a trace of hostility, probably the bar?a fans.

Xia ruofei brought Ling Qingxue and Song Wei around for a while. After buying clothes for each of them, Ling Qingxue and Song Wei took the initiative to suggest that they return to the hotel. It was indeed a little weird that there were people watching Yingluo everywhere she went.

The three of them returned to the hotel room and chatted for a while. Zhou leiyun then gave Xia ruofei a call.

After Xia ruofei picked up, he said,””Director Zhou ... Okay, we’ll come down now!”

“Zhou leiyun and Zhao Zhenghao are already here. Let’s go down as well!” Xia ruofei put away his phone.

“Alright!”

Xia ruofei, Ling Qingxue, and Song Wei took the elevator to the floor where Zhou leiyun’s private room was. The waiter brought them to an elegant room and knocked on the door. After getting an affirmative response from the room, the waiter pushed the door open and gestured for Xia ruofei and the other two to enter.

Xia ruofei took out a ten – dollar bill and handed it to the waiter. The waiter quickly bowed in thanks.

Xia ruofei brought Ling Qingxue and Song Wei into the private room.

The decoration of the private room didn’t look luxurious. It was similar to the style of this hotel and gave off a sense of history.

Zhou leiyun and Zhao Zhenghao were walking out to welcome them. Xia ruofei also took two quick steps and came in front of them.

“Mr. Xia, I’ve heard a lot about you!” Zhao Zhenghao extended his hand to Xia ruofei and said with a smile.

“Vice – President Zhao, actually, regarding the meeting, let’s just set a time in China.” Xia ruofei smiled.”I’m sorry to have troubled you to fly all the way here.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Where? Mr. Xia is the hope for the rise of Chinese football!” Zhao Zhenghao said exaggeratedly,”since ancient times, respect has been paid to talents. Liu Bei invited Zhuge Liang to visit him three times! I just flew to Spain it’s not hard!”

“Director Xia, Vice President Zhao, let’s sit down and talk!” Zhou leiyun said. Let’s chat while we eat!”

“Good, good, good!”

After everyone took their seats, the steaming hot dishes were quickly served. The waiters also began to pour red wine for everyone.

After Zhou leiyun said a few words that could be used anywhere, everyone raised their glasses and drank together.

“Try the craftsmanship here first!” Zhou leiyun said,”I heard that the chef here used to work at a Michelin restaurant. The taste should be good!”

After drinking three glasses of wine and eating some dishes, they had finished the “prescribed action”. Next was the “optional action”.

Zhao Zhenghao picked up his glass and said to Xia ruofei,””Mr. Xia, let me offer you a toast! Thank you for your help to Chinese football!”

“I’ll toast you!” Xia ruofei smiled.”I really haven’t made any contributions to Chinese football.”

“Mr. Xia’s dazzling performance itself is a huge contribution.” Zhao Zhenghao smiled and said,”not only can it boost the morale of the national football team, but it will also greatly promote the growth of our football population! Especially after last night’s game, I think for a long time in the future, there will be people who will have the idea of playing football after watching the video of Mr. Xia’s goal! Maybe among these people, there are our own Chinese C.O. And Messi!”
