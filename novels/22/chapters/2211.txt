2212 Appointment_“Thank you, professor!” Song Wei said gratefully. I’m so sorry ... I haven’t finished my work here, so I ...”

“I’m fine, I’m fine!” Professor Zhao waved his hand and said with a smile,”there’s only some finishing touches left. You’re mainly responsible for the entry work. Just leave it to your junior brothers and sisters!” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

For this trip, professor Zhao not only brought a few of his graduate students, but also a few undergraduate students who performed well. Song Wei’s job this time was not very technical. She mainly needed to be serious and meticulous, so it was not a problem to leave it to the undergraduate students.

“Alright!” Song Wei replied. Thank you, professor! I’ll hand over the work. ”

“Yeah!” Professor Zhao smiled and nodded. You can go back to school after you’ve settled the things at home. Don’t worry. ”

The study time of graduate students was generally flexible, especially when they followed the professor to do research. A few days of leave was just a word from the professor.

“Alright, alright!” Song Wei said.

Professor Zhao thought for a moment and said,”we have a car going to the county to buy things in the afternoon. You should hurry up and hand over your work to Xiao Qian. It’ll be just in time to follow the car in the afternoon.” We’ll be able to board the plane in the provincial capital Tonight. ”

“Understood, thank you, professor!” Song Wei said sincerely.

Professor Zhao called out the undergraduate student, little Qian. After giving a few instructions, he had Song Wei take little Qian to hand over the work at hand.

In the afternoon, Song Wei left the campsite with the archeological team and took a bus to the provincial capital.

She had already booked a plane ticket on the way. As soon as she arrived at the provincial city Station, she immediately took a taxi and went straight to the airport.

At around 8 pm, Song Wei boarded the plane to Sanshan.

Before she turned off her phone, Song Wei sent Ling Qingxue a WeChat message. The plane will land at around 10:30 pm. Shall we meet tomorrow?

Before Song Wei could turn off her phone, Ling Qingxue’s WeChat message came in. Let’s do it today! I’ll pick you up at the airport.

Song Wei was stunned for a moment. She didn’t expect Ling Qingxue to be in such a hurry. However, this was exactly what she wanted. The longer this matter dragged on, the more uncomfortable it would be. She would have to face it sooner or later anyway, so it was better to solve it earlier.

Hence, she replied with an “okay” and turned off her phone without waiting for Ling Qingxue to reply.

In reality, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue had already returned to land.

They were no longer in the mood to play on the sea. After lunch, Ling Qingxue asked Xia ruofei to drive the yacht back.

The two of them didn’t talk much along the way, and the atmosphere was very dull.

When Ling Qingxue and Song Wei sent WeChat messages, Xia ruofei did not look at them but he used his spiritual power to spy on them clearly.

He was also a little nervous. He didn’t know what would happen after the two women met. Now he felt like a prisoner waiting for his sentence, and his heart was very tormented.

However, Xia ruofei could not say anything. Since Ling Qingxue had no intention of telling him, he could only pretend that he did not know.

Now, Xia ruofei had let go of his worries. Anyway, he had said what he needed to say. As for the specific outcome, he would leave it to fate.

Xia ruofei was driving the Knight XV off – Road vehicle towards the Riverside Villa area. Ling Qingxue put away her phone and said lightly,””Send me to the company.”

“Ah? You’re back at the company so late?” Xia ruofei asked in surprise.

Ling Qingxue didn’t say anything. She just leaned back in her seat and closed her eyes to rest.

Xia ruofei touched his nose awkwardly and said,””Alright then!”

After saying that, he turned the car around and drove in the direction of the Ling Ji restaurant headquarters.

In fact, Xia ruofei had already guessed Ling Qingxue’s intentions. Recently, Xia ruofei had been the one who picked Ling Qingxue up and sent her to work. Ling Qingxue’s own car had always been parked in the underground parking lot of the company’s headquarters.

Now that Ling Qingxue was going to the company, it was obvious that she was going to get her car. Wasn’t she going to the airport to meet Song Wei?

Naturally, Xia ruofei could only pretend that he did not know anything. He sent Ling Qingxue back to the Ling Ji F & B headquarters and watched her enter the building. Then, he smiled bitterly and drove back to the Riverside Villa area.
