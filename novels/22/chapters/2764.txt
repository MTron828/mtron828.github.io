The Veterans had also woken up, but they didn’t organize any training. Most of them had drunk too much yesterday, so they were a little dispirited today. Ma Jia simply let them rest for half a day.

Ma Jia’s face was still pale from The Hangover. When he saw Xia ruofei, he smiled bitterly and said,””RUO Fei, how did your alcohol tolerance become so high? Last night, I was so drunk that I blacked out ...”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”I’ve already told you that I can hold my liquor well. I was letting you have your way in the Army. But you didn’t believe me!” If you insist on competing with me, don’t blame me if you get drunk!”

“I didn’t say anything when I was drunk last night, did I?” asked Ma Jia.

Xia ruofei laughed evilly and said,”I’ve said a lot!” I’ve recorded it. I’m going to play it for sister – in – Law the next time I see her ...”

“Nonsense!” Ma Jia’s face was full of disbelief.”I usually sleep soundly when I drink too much. I never talk nonsense!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’m not joking with you!” Old company commander, I see that everyone’s condition isn’t very good, so I’ll make some hangover soup for everyone to drink later!”

Ma Jia waved her hand and said,”the canteen has already sent over some hangover soup. However, it will take some time for him to recover. Drinking The Hangover soup is useless.”

Xia ruofei smiled.”My hangover soup is different. It’s definitely effective!”

“Don’t you dare brag!” Ma Jia said,”I wanted to organize a five – kilometer run this morning, but my physical condition was really bad. I felt a little light when I walked, so I gave up on it after thinking about it.”

“You guys, wait a moment!” Xia ruofei said.

He originally wanted to talk to Ma Jia about the follow – up work arrangements, but when he saw that Ma Jia and the other veterans were listless, he also knew that the feeling of a hangover was very uncomfortable. So, he decided to prepare a special “hangover soup” for everyone first.

Xia ruofei arrived at the canteen. Cao tieshu’s wife was leading the staff to prepare lunch.

Xia ruofei called out,”sister – in – Law, do you still have The Hangover soup we prepared for the Veterans?” If you don’t have any, please cook another pot!”

“There’s still quite a bit left!” Cao tieshu’s wife smiled and said,”they are all over there!”

She pointed at a large stainless steel bucket in the corner of the canteen and asked,””Boss, do you want to drink some too? I saw that you drank quite a bit yesterday! You should have a bowl of hangover soup!”

Xia ruofei walked towards the stainless steel bucket with The Hangover soup and smiled.””I’m not drinking it. It’s for the Veterans!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“They’ve already drunk it twice. ” Cao tieshu’s wife said,”this thing doesn’t have much effect even if you drink too much of it. You can’t drink too much wine. Otherwise, it will definitely take you a few days to recover!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s okay. It’s not bad to drink anyway.” Let them drink it again!”

As he spoke, he lifted the lid of the soup barrel and saw that there was still more than half a barrel of hangover soup that exuded a faint medicinal fragrance. It should be enough for everyone to drink a small bowl.

Xia ruofei said,”sister – in – Law, help me prepare the bowls and spoons. Also, bring the three – wheeled cart from the canteen here. I’ll send it over for everyone to drink another bowl!”

Cao tieshu’s wife didn’t think much of it, but Xia ruofei was the boss. She didn’t dare to refute her boss’s words, so she quickly got the staff to prepare the stainless steel bowls and spoons.

These things were always in the cafeteria’s disinfection cabinet, so they didn’t need to be specially prepared.

“Boss, I’ll have someone send it over. You don’t have to do it yourself!” Cao tieshu’s wife said.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it’s okay, I’ll just take it as training!” Hurry up and get ready!”

Most of the staff in the canteen were female. Xia ruofei was embarrassed to let them do such physical work. Most importantly, he had to add something to the food, so he had to deliver it personally.

“Alright then!” Cao tieshu’s wife said,”then wait a moment, I’ll go push the cart!”

Just as everyone was busy preparing, Xia ruofei used his body to block everyone’s view. He took out a few drops of the spirit Heart Flower petal solution and some spirit pond water from his spatial pocket and poured them into The Hangover soup. Then, he pretended to be curious and stirred the soup with a stainless steel ladle, letting it mix evenly.

Soon, everything was ready. Xia ruofei lifted the soup bucket easily and placed it on the tricycle. The employees also moved the plastic boxes with stainless steel bowls and spoons onto the tricycle.

Xia ruofei rode on his three – wheeled motorcycle and headed towards the staff dormitory.

“Old company commander, here’s The Hangover soup!” Xia ruofei shouted from below the dormitory.”Get everyone down!”

Ma Jia stuck her head out from the corridor on the second floor and took a look, then quickly gathered everyone downstairs.

“Ruofei, how come you’re so fast?” Ma Jia looked at Xia ruofei and said with a smile,”you didn’t bring The Hangover soup that Mrs. Cao made, did you?”

“How is that possible? I used my own secret recipe to make this!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”the effect is not something that a normal hangover soup can compare to! Hurry up, one bowl for each of you! Everyone has to drink it!”

“Alright! You’re the boss now, so we have to follow your orders!” Ma Jia said with a smile.

He was the first to walk over. He used a long ladle to scoop a bowl of hangover soup and directly gulped it down.

After a while, Ma Jia finished the bowl. He wiped his mouth and said,””And you still say that it wasn’t made by sister – in – Law Cao? Even the taste is the same!”
