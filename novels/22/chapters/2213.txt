2214 Feeling the same (2)

Only then did Xia ruofei come back to his senses. He quickly lifted the blanket and got out of bed. He didn’t even put on his slippers and walked to the door. He smiled and said,”Two beautiful ladies, please come in!”

After his shower, he had just casually put on a sleeping robe. He had gotten out of bed earlier, so the belt had long been loosened. His chest was exposed, and his strong pecs and well – defined eight – Pack ABS were all exposed in front of the two.

Song Wei was already embarrassed. Seeing Xia ruofei like this, she turned her face away.

Ling Qingxue was even angrier and said,””Please, can you put on your clothes properly?”

Xia ruofei quickly tidied up his sleeping bag and carefully tied the ribbon around himself. He wrapped himself up tightly and then made an inviting gesture.”Is it okay now? Let’s talk inside!”

Ling Qingxue gave Xia ruofei a sidelong glance before she walked into the room.

Song Wei followed closely behind Ling Qingxue. She did not even dare to look at Xia ruofei as she walked in hurriedly.

Seeing Song Wei acting like a little wife, Xia ruofei felt pity for her.

This was not an ordinary girl. She was the daughter of the top leader of San Shan and had connections with the song family. She was one of the top figures in the circle of the second generation in Beijing. She had a prominent family background, good upbringing, good looks, and a hot body. She was definitely a proud daughter of heaven.

It could be said that she had a large number of young masters pursuing her.

But now, she had to put herself in such a low position.

Xia ruofei sighed in his heart,’what did I do to deserve this? To be able to make a proud daughter of heaven like Song Wei fall for him ...

Ling Qingxue did not stand on ceremony and sat down on the edge of Xia ruofei’s bed. Then, she pointed at the lazy sofa beside the bed and said to Song Wei,””Wei Wei, you can sit here!”

Then, Ling Qingxue glanced at Xia ruofei, who was about to sit down on the bed, and said,””You just stand there!”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, and a bitter smile appeared on his face.

This was the rhythm of a joint trial of three halls!

However, he also knew that he had to lower his attitude today. This was a hurdle. If he could get over it, he would naturally have a bright future. If he couldn’t get over this, he would lose one of them or even both.

Hence, Xia ruofei did not take it to heart. He straightened his back and stood aside obediently.

However, Song Wei’s heart ached when she saw this. She said in a low voice,”Qingxue, let him sit down and talk! I’m still not used to him standing so tall!”

Ling Qingxue then turned to Xia ruofei and said,””Since Wei Wei interceded, then you should sit down! It saves us the trouble of having to look up and talk to you ...”

“Thank you! Thank you!” Xia ruofei smiled apologetically and sat down at the end of the bed. He continued,”then ... Why did you guys come here together? Isn’t Wei Wei out of town doing field research?”

Although Xia ruofei already knew that Song Wei and Ling Qingxue had arranged to meet, he still had to put on an act. If he did not act surprised, Ling Qingxue would be suspicious!

When Ling Qingxue heard how Xia ruofei addressed Song Wei so intimately, she could not help but feel a little sour. However, she quickly adjusted her mood and said,””Aren’t you the one who provoked them? Wei Wei rushed back day and night, and has been on the road since this afternoon!”

“Oh ... Thank you for your hard work.” Xia ruofei said.

He placed his hands on his knees like an obedient child. He looked at Ling Qingxue, then at Song Wei, and said hesitantly,”Then ... You’re here to ...”

To be honest, it would be a lie if she wasn’t nervous. However, the three of them had already met and Xia ruofei couldn’t pretend to be confused. He had to ask.

Ling Qingxue looked at Song Wei and said,””Wei Wei, why don’t you say it?”

Song Wei blushed and quickly said, “It’s better if you say it!”

“That’s good ...” Ling Qingxue did not decline. She glanced at Xia ruofei and said,”I met with Weiwei tonight and we have come to an agreement. I’m here to let you know.”

Even though Xia ruofei was mentally strong, he could not help but feel his heart beat faster at this moment. He took a deep breath and said,””You say it! I’m all ears ...”

Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei with a half – Smile and asked,””RUO Fei, what do you hope to be the result?”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly,”isn’t that asking the obvious?” My great aunt, don’t keep me in suspense. Can you just tell me if you’re Dead or Alive?”

Ling Qingxue and Song Wei looked at each other, and a hint of a smile appeared in their eyes.”So our overbearing Chairman can also be nervous sometimes!”

“Concern makes you confused!” Xia ruofei said shamelessly,”this shows that I care about you!”

This was supposed to be a good word, but the word “you” sounded a little harsh to Ling Qingxue.

She felt a burst of anger and bitterness. She bit her lower lip and then said indifferently,””Then I’ll be direct. Ruofei, after discussing with Wei Wei, we’ve decided to ...”

At this point, Ling Qingxue paused slightly and glanced at Xia ruofei, who was obviously nervous. Then, she continued,””Neither of us will be with you. We’ll let you, you greedy ghost, get nothing!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Hearing this, Xia ruofei felt a buzz in his head, and an inexplicable emotion welled up in his heart.

Even though he was already mentally prepared for such an outcome, when Ling Qingxue said it herself, Xia ruofei still felt a stab of pain in his heart. The pain was hard to describe in words, but it was deeply engraved in his heart.

He tried his best to control his emotions, not wanting to show his weak side in front of the two.

After a long while, Xia ruofei finally squeezed out a smile that was uglier than crying. He said with difficulty,””Oh ... This is indeed my fault. I ... Will respect your decision. I ... I also wish you ... Happiness in the future!”

Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei quietly. Although Xia ruofei did not cry or look as if he had lost his parents, she could clearly feel the pain hidden in his seemingly calm expression. Especially when his eyes suddenly lost their light, it made her heart hurt.

“I can’t feel bad for him!” Ling Qingxue said to herself,”I have to let this greedy bastard feel the pain. Otherwise, things will get out of hand in the future!”

Therefore, not only did Ling Qingxue not say anything, but she also used her eyes to stop Song Wei from speaking.

Xia ruofei took a deep breath and suppressed all his emotions. Then, he said calmly,””So ... You’re here to say goodbye to me tonight?”

Ling Qingxue’s white and neat teeth bit her lower lip lightly. She looked straight at Xia ruofei and only spoke after a long while. “Isn’t this feeling uncomfortable? But do you know how I felt when I heard you personally tell me that there was another woman who wanted to share a man with me? My cultivation just broke through and I was still immersed in great joy, but your words made all the joy disappear. My mood was even worse than riding a roller coaster ...”

“Qingxue, don’t say anymore!” Xia ruofei waved his hand and frowned.”I know it’s all my fault! “So ... Today’s outcome is my own fault. Since you’ve decided, I’ll definitely respect it ... Perhaps I need time to adapt, perhaps this wound will never heal, but don’t worry, I definitely won’t pester or disturb you ...”

Speaking of this, Xia ruofei suddenly remembered something and quickly said,””That’s right, your foundations are quite good, and your cultivation is also quite good. It’s not easy to embark on the path of cultivation, so it’s a pity to give up halfway. However, the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” wasn’t suitable for individual cultivation. The efficiency would be too low. I’ll try to find a suitable cultivation technique for you as soon as possible and teach it to you. I’ll also prepare enough cultivation resources for you. This is the last thing I can do for you ...”

Ling Qingxue and Song Wei’s eyes turned red when they heard Xia ruofei’s words. Song Wei’s tears started to fall.

Ling Qingxue’s heart trembled. She gritted her teeth and glared at Xia ruofei “viciously.””What good things are you thinking about? It wasn’t easy for us to get to where we are today, and you actually want to wash your hands of this? He even wants us to choose a new cultivation technique and start from the beginning? Don’t even think about it! Who told you to lure us onto the path of cultivation? You have to take full responsibility!”

Xia ruofei was stunned and asked weakly,””Then ... What do you mean by that?”
