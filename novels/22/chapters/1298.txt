Xu Jiahui criticized in his heart,’no one can say that they’re looting a burning house in such a fresh and refined way ...’

But on second thought, he realized that Xia ruofei was kind compared to those greedy people in the real estate industry. At least, he offered a higher price. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“President Xia, I admit that the group is facing some difficulties in the operation of funds.” Xu Jiahui said sincerely,”however, this difficulty is temporary. In addition to the cash – out of the Heng Li building, we also have many means to raise funds. If the price does not meet the expectations of the group’s senior management, we would rather not sell it.”

At this point, it was meaningless to hide the cash flow problem. Xu Jiahui simply changed his strategy.

Didn’t you keep saying that we have problems with funds? I admit it, but we’re not forced to a dead end. We’re selling the assets of the balance power building for cash, but it’s not our only way.

This set of words seemed to be open and honest, but in fact, it was also a hint to Xia ruofei to not overdo it so that the cooked duck would not fly away.

Xia ruofei just smiled and said,””I know. Your company’s director Zhou found a sum of money in Hong Kong!”

Xu Jiahui broke out in a cold sweat again. President Zhou had gone to Hong Kong in person to raise 200 million Hong Kong dollars, which had relieved the financial pressure to a certain extent. At present, the gap in funds was about 500 million. If another sum of money could be successfully transferred to the account, it was basically about 350 million less.

This was the reason why the group’s high – Level meeting set the bottom line for the assets of Hengli building at 350 million.

If everything went well, the nine floors of the balance power building must be sold for more than 350 million Yuan to solve the crisis this time.

General manager Zhou had already succeeded and raised about 20 million Yuan more than expected. The other Vice President had led a team to Beijing to seek help and now had some progress. Only the sale of the Hengli building had not made any progress.

Before Xu Jiahui could say anything, Xia ruofei said indifferently,””Boss Xu, as far as I know, one of your loans in the construction Bank is already overdue ...”

Xu Jiahui’s mind buzzed and he looked at Xia ruofei in shock.

Seeing Xia ruofei’s smiling face, Xu Jiahui’s expression changed quickly. He quickly pretended to be calm and said,””President Xia, you know our group’s situation very well! “However, the cooperation between real estate companies and banks is very close. Occasionally, the loans are overdue, and the banks are more understanding. This time, the construction Bank also trusts us very much and did not give us too much pressure ...”

Xia ruofei remained calm and said,””President Wu is the one who understands you better, right? However, from what I know, President Wu will be reaching his retirement age next month!”

Xu Jiahui’s expression changed. This was the core secret of bojun real estate.

Even among their peers, very few people knew that bojun real estate’s biggest backer in the construction industry was Deputy President Wu. This was because the Deputy President rarely dealt with bojun real estate, but in reality, he secretly took great care of bojun real estate when it came to loans.

The crisis of bojun real estate started two months ago.

Like many local companies, bojun real estate had been trying to expand.

Their first step was a little too big, and they directly chose the International metropolis, Shen Cheng.

He spent a huge price to buy a piece of land in Shen Cheng city and then quickly developed it.

This was also the future strategic Center of bojun real estate.

Then, there was a problem with the land. First, there were two consecutive accidents at the construction site, and even a construction worker was killed. Then, a series of problems occurred. They had invested a large amount of money, but they had not been able to get a pre – Sale certificate.

If this was San Shan, these problems could be easily solved. However, in Shen Cheng, as an outsider, bojun real estate had a shallow foundation. To put it bluntly, they could not even pray to Buddha.

These problems were the result of a few real estate companies in Shen Cheng ganging up on bojun real estate. Coupled with some official relations, bojun real estate had gone through several changes, but they still could not get the pre – Sale certificate.

The opening was far away, which meant that the two to three billion Yuan invested in the early stage could never be recovered.

In addition, there were two other real estate developments in San Shan, which required a large amount of money to be invested every day.

The debt rate of real estate companies was extremely high to begin with. After a period of time, bojun real estate’s capital chain had serious problems.

If they couldn’t solve it in a short time, several construction sites would face the danger of stopping work.

Once the work was stopped, the chain reaction caused would be serious.

The construction party would start to recover the construction funds, the bank would go to the house to recover the loan, and the owners who had bought the house would also go to the house to demand an explanation.

The brand that he had worked so hard to build for so many years could be destroyed.

In addition, a 300 million loan from jianhang had already matured. Vice President Wu could help delay it for a while, but after he retired, many things would be beyond his reach.

Moreover, Vice President Wu had also hinted that his successor was parachuted from the head office. Such gilded officials cherished their feathers the most and were mostly impervious to anything. Moreover, the new official was quick to act. If the money was not returned in time, bojun real estate was likely to become the sacrifice for his flag.
