Chapter 1014: Chapter 651 – a scare (2)

Translator: 549690339

In the eyes of these super – rich people, money was endless, and no one could monopolize all the industries.

Tang He quickly adjusted his mentality and said with a smile,””RUO Fei! I heard that you later bought a winery in Australia, and it’s not a small one at that?”

Tang He knew about Xia ruofei’s acquisition of West Winery and had even loaned some money to Xia ruofei. He even gave him some advice to set up an offshore company.

Later on, Xia ruofei’s Robinson’s Golden Oak winery was in a desperate situation. In the end, they begged Xia ruofei to buy it. It was Liang Qichao who mentioned it in passing when he reported to Tang He.

“It’s a little bigger than West Winery, but it’s definitely not worthy of your attention!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Our shengbang group also has some red wine sales business,” Tang He said with a smile.”We have good channels. We can work together if there’s a chance!”

Xia ruofei nodded happily and said,””That’s great! Mr. Tang, the wineries under my name may undergo a transformation. West wineries mainly produce Semillon white wine, and Golden Oak wineries should also focus on Semillon before they have a better choice. ”

“Alright! The Hunter Valley’s Semillon is world – renowned. ” Tang He said with a smile,”I heard from Qi Chao that you’re going to improve the quality of your grapes. I’m looking forward to your wine!”

After seeing Taoyuan vegetables, Tang He was very confident in Xia ruofei’s company’s ability to improve crops. He also believed that Xia ruofei would not remove the grapes that had been growing in the winery for many years and re – Plant them. He knew that Xia ruofei must be very confident.

“I’ll invite you to try the first batch of wine next year!”Xia ruofei smiled.

“Hahaha! “Good, good, good ...” Tang He said happily.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and went straight to the point.””Mr. Tang, I’ve already made arrangements for the warehouse. What time are you free tomorrow? Let’s meet at the warehouse!”

” 9 a.m. Then!” Tang He nodded. I’ll head over after I’ve had breakfast. RUO Fei! I really can’t wait! I really want to go there overnight to see the wood you helped me find. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”don’t worry!” The wood won’t fly away in the warehouse, so we’ll be able to see it more clearly tomorrow, right?”

“Hahaha! Alright, I’ll listen to you!” Tang He said with a bright smile.

Xia ruofei chatted with Tang He in his Presidential Suite for a while before he got up and returned to Paradise Farm.

......

The next morning, Xia ruofei finished the breakfast that Hu ‘Zi’s mother had prepared for him. After saying goodbye, he drove away from the farm.

Xia ruofei arrived at the warehouse he had rented in the city at around 8:30.

With a thought, he took out two pieces of Phoebe zhennan wood that he had prepared earlier from the medium.

To Xia ruofei, this warehouse was like a transit point, including the Drunken Eight Immortals wine and other large items that were not convenient to take out from the space. It was a good cover for him to transit here.

That day, after Xia ruofei brought the truck to transport the Ironhide vessel strips back to the farm, he returned to the warehouse in the afternoon and stored the new wine sent by the winery in the space.

Therefore, the warehouse was now empty, and there was no problem in storing two thick and strong pieces of Phoebe zhennan wood.

Three days in the outside world was equivalent to three months in the Archean realm.

Xia ruofei took out a tape measure and measured it. In the past three months, the diameter of the core had increased by another two centimeters, reaching 1.02 meters. The state of the entire wood was almost perfect.

He raised his hand and looked at his watch. There was still about half an hour before the appointed time.

Xia ruofei had an idea. He took out a tea set, a picnic chair, a power strip, and other things from the medium. He plugged in the power from the wall and connected the electric kettle. Then, he took out a drinking bucket from the medium. It was filled with the Spirit pool water.

After stuffing the water pipe into the bucket, Xia ruofei pressed the switch and the spiritual pool water was automatically drawn into the kettle to heat up.

He took out a small box of top – grade Da Hong Pao from his storage space.

After the water was boiled, Xia ruofei first used the boiling water to heat up the tea set. Then, he used a wooden spoon to scoop an appropriate amount of tea leaves and put them into the purple clay teapot. He began to make tea in this simple warehouse.

Xia ruofei was already very familiar with the process of making tea. In a short while, the warehouse was filled with the alluring fragrance of tea.

Xia ruofei sipped his tea as he waited.

After a few baths, Xia ruofei poured out the tea leaves from the pot, washed them with hot water, and added new tea leaves.

Just then, the sound of a car was heard from outside the warehouse.

The door of the warehouse was not closed. Xia ruofei calmly poured the hot water into the purple clay teapot and then looked up.

An extended Bentley slid to the entrance of the warehouse. A middle – aged man in a suit and leather shoes got out of the car and opened the door. Tang He and another middle – aged man in his fifties, who was also wearing a Tang suit, got out of the car.

Xia ruofei poured away the first cup of tea and then stood up to welcome him.

“You’re very punctual, old Mr. Tang. ” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Tang He also laughed and said,”punctuality is one of the most important qualities of a businessman!” RUO Fei, the wood is ready ... Eh? This tea is so special!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I was making tea here alone!” Mr. Tang also studied tea leaves? How about coming over to have some tea together?”

“Great!” Tang He said happily. This should be the fragrance of Da Hong Pao!”

“Please come in!” Xia ruofei made an inviting gesture.

After entering the warehouse, Tang He’s eyes first fell on the two thick logs of wood. His eyes lit up and he asked,””This must be the Phoebe zhennan wood that you helped me find! It doesn’t look much different from the last one ...”

“These two pieces of material took a lot of effort to find. I hope you’ll be satisfied!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Tang He nodded slightly, then turned to look at the middle – aged man beside him and said lightly,””Ah – Zhong, go and take a look at the material!”

“Yes! Master Tang!” The middle – aged man in the Tang suit, ah – Zhong, said respectfully.

Then, he put on white gloves, took out a flashlight, a magnifying glass, and other tools, and walked straight to the two pieces of material.

Tang He smiled and said to Xia ruofei,””Come, come, come, ruofei, let me try your Da Hong Pao first. When I smelled the aroma just now, I already felt that your tea leaves were not ordinary!”

“Please take a seat, old Mr. Tang!” Xia ruofei smiled and made an inviting gesture.

Just now, Xia ruofei had considered that Tang He would also need to sit when he came in, so he took out three chairs for the picnic at once.

The two of them sat down around the dining table. Xia ruofei poured the boiling water into the purple clay pot.

The tea had been washed just now, so Xia ruofei waited for a few seconds to pour the tea from the purple clay teapot into the filter pot and then into the small teacup.

When Tang He entered the door, he only smelled the tea fragrance that Xia ruofei had left behind when he drank the tea. Now that Xia ruofei had made his first tea with new tea leaves, the fragrance was much stronger. Tang He could not help but sniffle when he smelled the tea fragrance.

“Thank you!” Tang He said. Then, he impatiently picked up the teacup with his thumb and middle finger. He gently blew on it a few times and smelled the fragrance of the tea. Suddenly, he revealed a look of enjoyment and closed his eyes slightly.

When the temperature of the tea dropped a little, Tang He opened his eyes and drank it in one gulp with a trace of expectation.

The tea stayed in his mouth for a while before Tang He swallowed it.

A look of reminiscence appeared on his face, and his expression was also very rich. After a long while, he sighed in admiration,””Ruofei, this is probably the best quality Da Hong Pao I’ve ever tasted ... I’ve had the honor of tasting the tea leaves from the mother tree, but your tea leaves seem to be better in terms of fragrance, color, and sweetness!”

“Mr. Tang, you’re too kind. This is a local tea that I made myself. How can it compare to the mother tree, Da Hong Pao?” Xia ruofei said humbly.

“Oh? Self – made?” Tang He suddenly looked interested and asked with anticipation,”ruofei, do you still have more of these tea leaves? I’m taking them all! The price is not a problem!”
