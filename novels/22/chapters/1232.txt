Obviously, the other party’s wealth was far from being comparable to his own, but Ma Zhiming often had a feeling of being in a higher social class.

Ma Zhiming’s family of three stayed in Xia ruofei’s room for about an hour. Considering that Xia ruofei was tired from the long journey, they also got up and left.

Even though Huan Huan was a little reluctant, Xia ruofei was in Hong Kong and she would be able to see him again during dinner. Hence, after Tian Huixin coaxed her, she obediently bid Xia ruofei farewell.

After Ma Zhiming and the other two left, only Feng Rao and Xia ruofei were left in the house.

Feng Rao looked at Xia ruofei with a smile and asked,””Chairman, would you like to rest for a while, or would you like to listen to my report?”

Xia ruofei leaned back on the sofa and said lazily,””I don’t think there’s anything to report. I’m 100% confident in you, you can make the decision anyway!”

Feng Rao could not help but glare at Xia ruofei and said,””Hey! You’re such an incompetent boss! At least put on an act!”

Xia ruofei sat up straight and said in a serious tone,””Alright then! Boss Feng, tell me about your work these few days!”

Feng Rao didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. She shook her head and said, “You’re not acting like one at all! Forget it, forget it, I’m too lazy to argue with you. Otherwise, I’ll be so angry that I’ll die sooner or later. ”

Xia ruofei was already on the verge of breaking down. Hearing this, he immediately smiled and said,””That’s the way! Haven’t we always been working well together? You just need to grasp the details!”

“No problem!” Feng Rao helplessly dragged out her words,”but let me make this clear first! I’m not going to show my face in public! This time, we’ll leave it all to the Hengfeng auction house ...”

After the Jade skin cream’s launch, Feng Jing’s popularity on the internet had reached a peak. Now, in San Shan, she was easily recognized by many people on the streets. This made Feng Jing extremely nervous every time she went out. She even had to wear sunglasses and a face mask. It was almost like she was being treated like a celebrity.

Therefore, before coming to Hong Kong this time, Feng Jing had expressed her unwillingness to appear on stage again.

In her own words, she was a professional manager, not an artiste.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”our paradise Corporation should at least send a representative, right?” You don’t need to host for a long time. The main characters of the auction are our top – grade truffles, and the one on camera is also the auctioneer!”

“No! You go up yourself!” Feng Jing was determined.

“Alright, alright, alright, then we won’t show our faces!” Xia ruofei said,”it’s an auction anyway. We’ll take the money and leave after we’re done! “As for taking the opportunity to promote the company and improve the company’s image, it doesn’t matter ...”

Feng Rao was dumbfounded. After a long while, she looked at Xia ruofei and said,””No way ... How can you be so irresponsible?”

Xia ruofei said nonchalantly,”I’m just thinking for you.” Since you don’t want to show your face in public, I have to follow your advice! Boss Feng, as a boss, I still respect the opinions of my employees ...”

“But you have to go up!” Feng Rao said,”what a great opportunity! Do you know how many socialites are here this time? Our company just so happens to be taking the high – end route ...”

Xia ruofei grinned.”I can’t ... I’m not good with words, and I’ve never been to a big scene. I’m easily nervous. No, no, no. Since you don’t want to go on stage, forget it. You’ll still have this opportunity in the future ...”

Feng Rao snapped out of her daze. She looked at Xia ruofei with a half – Smile and pouted.”Chairman, you’re so mean!”

Feng Jing stomped her feet helplessly and said,””Alright, I’ll go on stage, alright?”

“That’s the way! We still have to rely on you at the crucial moment, right?” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you said you were useless last time. Now you know how useful you are, right?”

Feng Rao glared at Xia ruofei and said,””You only know how to bully me ...”

Even though Feng Jing said that, she still reported her work over the past few days to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei sighed from the bottom of his heart after hearing the story. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

All of this work was very cumbersome, and there were many steps that needed to be coordinated. Feng Jing, along with Liu Qian and another young female employee in the marketing department, worked late into the night almost every day to manage these cumbersome tasks in an orderly manner. She was indeed quite capable, and her sense of responsibility was unsurpassable.

Xia ruofei said to Feng Rao sincerely,””President Feng, you’ve worked hard! Thank you!”

Feng Jing felt her face heat up as Xia ruofei stared at her. She avoided his gaze and said,””Chairman, every time you tell me how hard it has been, I always have an ominous feeling. Are you going to cheat me again?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but roll his eyes and said,””Is my image in your mind that bad?”

“Yup!” Feng Rao nodded seriously.

Feng Jing couldn’t help but burst out laughing when she saw Xia ruofei’s defeated look.””I’m just joking with you!”

“I’m getting such a high salary and bonus, so of course I have to do my best. ” Feng Rao said seriously,”this is my job.”

“No, it’s not.” Xia ruofei said,”you’ve done so much for the company. I know what you’re doing! Director Feng, as long as the company exists, as long as you don’t want to leave, you will always be the General Manager of the Paradise company!”

Feng Rao also looked touched. A gentleman would die for his bosom friend. Moreover, she still had some unclear feelings for Xia ruofei.

Feng Rao didn’t say anything, but the atmosphere in the room became a little ambiguous.

Feng Rao was the first to break the silence. She blushed and stood up, saying quickly,”Chairman, I’ll go to Liu Qian’s place to go through tomorrow’s schedule again. You should rest for a while!”

After she finished speaking, she quickly walked towards the door.

Xia ruofei felt a little strange, but he did not think too much about it. He called out from behind Feng Rao,””You’ll be attending the banquet with me tonight. Don’t forget!”

“I know!” Feng Rao said without turning her head. She then opened the door and walked out.

Xia ruofei kept the truffles back into the spirit map space. Only in the spirit map space could the truffles be kept fresh. In the outside world, no matter how well – protected they were, they could not stop the truffles from going bad.

The cold cabinet in the room had a password, and only Xia ruofei could open it. He just had to put the truffle in before the auction tomorrow.

After that, Xia ruofei went to take a shower and then lay down on the soft bed to sleep for a while.

In the evening, MA Xiong’s family invited Xia ruofei and Feng Jing to a banquet.

MA Xiong even cut a small piece of white truffle excitedly and asked the hotel’s Michelin chef to make an Italy riskie with thin slices of white truffle.

In MA Xiong’s words, only the simplest way could reflect the most original taste of the top white truffle.

Before the auction for the truffle started, Xia ruofei and the others had already enjoyed the deliciousness of the top – grade white truffle.

The MA family seemed to love truffles. Not only MA Xiong, but Ma Zhiming, Tian Huixin, and even Huan Huan also seemed to be enjoying the White truffle while eating the Italy risotto.

Obviously, Feng Rao loved the taste of white truffles and ate them with great relish.

Perhaps Xia ruofei was the only one who did not feel anything for the expensive white truffle tonight. In fact, he was not used to the strange taste.

Xia ruofei saw that Feng Jing almost swallowed her tongue and was secretly amused. He decided that when he returned to the three mountains, he would pick two small truffles for Feng Jing so that she could eat her fill.

He would treat it as an employee benefit.

After dinner, Xia ruofei sat on the yacht with Ma Zhiming’s family of three and enjoyed the beautiful night view of Port Victoria. This was, of course, little Huanhuan’s suggestion. She liked to stay with Xia ruofei. Every time she saw Xia ruofei, she wanted to stick to him.

It was almost 10 pm when he returned from the night tour.

Xia ruofei took a shower and prepared to go to bed.

At this moment, pleasant and light music rang out from the bedside. Someone was ringing the doorbell outside.

Xia ruofei turned to look at the LCD screen on the bedside table. When he saw the visitor at the door, he couldn’t help but open his mouth slightly ...
