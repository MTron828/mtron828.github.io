Translator: 549690339

This person ... Really seemed to be Secretary song!

At that moment, inspector Wu was so dejected that he almost fainted.

At this time, Tian Mingyi was still proudly saying,””There are really all kinds of people these days, there’s even someone who impersonates the city’s Secretary ...”

“Shut up!” Inspector Wu was so scared that he immediately shouted to stop him.

Tian Ming Yi was also shocked by inspector Wu. He looked at inspector Wu with a strange expression and said,”Brother Wu, what’s wrong?”

However, inspector Wu did not have the time to explain to Tian Mingyi. He almost rolled and crawled to song Qiming and stuttered,”Song ... Hehe ... Secretary ... Song ... Hehe ...”

His teeth couldn’t help but chatter, and he couldn’t even speak properly. His back was also drenched in cold sweat.

After inspector Wu said that, the kitchen suddenly became quiet. Even the sound of a needle dropping could be heard clearly.

Everyone’s mouth was wide open as they looked at Superintendent Wu and song Qiming in disbelief. Panic slowly spread in the dead silence.

Was this person really a Secretary of the municipal government? Tian Mingyi couldn’t believe it, but he had to believe it. Unless director Wu suddenly lost his mind, how could he be so scared?

Tian Mingyi felt as if a bucket of ice water had been poured over his head, chilling him from head to toe. His legs couldn’t help but tremble, and he even felt the urge to pee spreading ...

Just now, he had spoken rudely to Secretary song and said a lot of sarcastic words! It was really a moment of pleasure to ridicule, but now even his intestines were about to turn green with regret.

When he thought of the unscrupulous words he had just said to the Big Shot of the Provincial Party Committee and the head of the three mountains, Tian Mingyi almost fainted.

Perhaps it would be easier if he fainted. Every second was torture to him now!

Song Qiming remained silent as he scanned the group of people with his cold eyes. No one dared to meet Song Qiming’s stern gaze. They all lowered their heads guiltily.

Inspector Wu gathered his courage and said,””Secretary song, we ... We are a joint inspection team formed by the health, Environmental protection, safety supervision, Industry and Commerce, tax, urban management, and other departments. We are conducting a surprise inspection of this restaurant. Just now ... Just now, we didn’t recognize you, so ...”

Song Qiming looked at inspector Wu and asked,””A surprise inspection? Did you find any problems?”

Inspector Wu hesitated for a moment, and his eyes flashed with a difficult look.

Even a fool could tell that song Qiming was on the hotel’s side. Moreover, the “problems” that they had found were not valid at all. If the other party had no power or influence, they could still find fault with them no matter how ridiculous the “problems” were. However, if they still brought it up now, they would be treating Secretary song as a fool.

Seeing this, Ling Xiaotian blinked his eyes at manager Lu without saying anything.

Manager Lu, who had been holding back his anger for a long time, immediately understood and came forward. He said loudly,””Secretary song, they found 17 major and minor problems. They issued a fine for every problem and even gave us a notice to close down for two months.”

Manager Lu handed the stack of tickets and notice to song Qiming with both hands.

Song Qiming took it, and inspector Wu quickly said,””Secretary song, these questions ...”

Song Qiming raised his head and looked at inspector Wu coldly. Inspector Wu swallowed back his weak explanation.

Song Qiming started to look at the ticket in his hand. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“There’s oil on the stove, the rag isn’t clean, and the ingredients aren’t fresh ...” Song Qiming read as he read.”There are so many problems!”

Song Qiming’s lips curled into a mocking smile.

Tian Mingyi and the others were all silent, so director Wu could only bite the bullet and say,”Secretary song, our law enforcement standards might be a little strict. The city is recently building a civilized city, and the higher – ups have instructed us to vigorously rectify the food and beverage industry ...”

“So you guys can pick bones from an egg?” Song Qiming raised his head and stared into inspector Wu’s eyes. He asked coldly,”you think you can create problems without any problems? Can you explain to me what’s with the condiments and cooking oil on the stove?”

Inspector Wu’s body trembled and he stammered, unable to say a word.

It was the scene where his gang of scoundrels had overturned the seasoning Box in front of manager Lu, then poured some vegetable oil on it, and made it manually.

When song Qiming arrived at the entrance of the kitchen, he happened to witness the ugly scene.

Seeing was believing.

He had heard so much from Ling Xiaotian along the way, but the anger in his heart was not as great as when he had witnessed the scene with his own eyes.

“I ... I ... We ...” Director Wu was completely at a loss.

Song Qiming snorted and looked at Tian Mingyi. He asked indifferently,””Which unit are you from?”

It was Tian Mingyi who was the most arrogant just now. Even after Cao Guangzhi revealed song Qiming’s identity, he was still sneering at him, so song Qiming remembered him first.

Tian Mingyi was so scared that his soul almost flew out of his body. Under song Qiming’s imposing gaze, he said in fear,””Re ... Report ... Secretary song, I ... I’m ... I’m ... The Vice – Principal of the primary school ...”
