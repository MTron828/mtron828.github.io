The southeast province Flower Fair was held in the new campus of the southeast Agriculture and Forestry University in the University City in the western suburbs of Sanshan city. The Agriculture and Forestry University had the home – court advantage, and they had the advantage of their major, so they were determined to win the gold Prize of the fair. After Xia ruofei left Taoyuan farm, he quickly got on the highway. He followed this road and went around half of three mountains city, only getting off the highway when he reached the exit of western suburbs university town. After getting off the swirling highway, the car quickly arrived at the University town. This was where all the universities in Sanshan city were located. Of course, this place was given the name “new campus” because, in the early years, there was no unified planning. The universities in Sanshan city were scattered in different parts of the city. Later, the government unified and acquired a large piece of land in the suburbs, and these universities gradually began to move here. The University of Agriculture and Forestry was located in a relatively remote area. Xia ruofei drove past the normal University, the medical University, and the Sanshan University. Finally, he could see the entrance of the Agriculture and Forestry University from afar. It was very lively at the university today. From time to time, buses with different University emblems would drive in and out. These were all people who came to participate in the flower exhibition. Not only would the universities in Sanshan city participate, but universities from other parts of the southeast province, such as the famous Heron Island University, would also send students to participate. Xia ruofei didn’t drive to join in the fun. There was a long row of parking spaces by the road outside the school gate. He found an empty space and parked his car. After swiping his card, he carried the pot of orchids and walked to the main gate of the University. Xia ruofei, Lu You, and Jiang Yue had agreed to meet at the East Gate of the Sanshan University. Today, the entrance of Agriculture and Forestry University was also very lively. In addition to Xia ruofei, there were also many students carrying all kinds of flowers into the campus. Before Xia ruofei could spot Lu You and the rest, Jiang Yue was the first to spot Xia ruofei. She waved her hands excitedly and shouted,””Brother Xia! We’re here ...” Xia ruofei followed the sound and saw Lu You, Jiang Yue, Xia Cheng from the landscaper club, and a few other students standing together. They were obviously waiting for him. Hence, he quickly walked toward Lu You and the others. There were several pots of flowers that Sanshan University had brought to the exhibition this time, but those pots were basically there to make up the numbers. Only the pot of Molan in Xia ruofei’s hands was their trump card. That was why even Xia Cheng, the president of the gardening club, was waiting for Xia ruofei at the school gate. Because the entire gardening club’s hope was pinned on Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei realized that other than the core members of the horticultural church, Peng Hui and you Jun had also followed him. When the two of them saw Xia ruofei, their faces were cold and their eyes were deliberately looking elsewhere. Xia ruofei smiled and ignored Peng Hui and you Jun. He greeted Lu You and the others. The temperature was very low today. Although the three mountains of Xuanji were located in the South, it was still cold in the late spring. Therefore, Lu You was wearing a light yellow down jacket, a hat of the same color, a scarf, and gloves today. She was wearing a pair of washed blue jeans and pink cotton boots. It could be said that she had wrapped herself up tightly. Jiang Yue, on the other hand, was wearing a light yellow long cotton jacket, a wool hat, a scarf, and gloves. After standing in the cold wind for a while, the two girls ‘Small Faces blushed, making them look even more beautiful. In addition, the clothes they were wearing matched well, like two sisters blooming in the cold wind. The college students walking back and forth couldn’t help but look stunned, especially the boys. The timid ones couldn’t help but sneak a few more glances, while the bold ones directly came forward to strike up a conversation. However, they were all coldly rejected by Lu You. They could not even say a word. Xia ruofei was also an ordinary person. The moment he saw Lu You’s Jiang Yue, his eyes naturally lit up. Xia ruofei’s stunning gaze was captured by Jiang Yue’s sharp senses. Her face blushed slightly, but her heart was as sweet as if it had fallen into a jar of honey. “Big brother Xia, how’s the pot of Mo Lan?” Jiang Yue pouted and asked,”can you beat yang suhe from Agriculture and Forestry University?” Xia ruofei had wrapped the flower pot with a large black plastic bag so Jiang Yue and the others could not see what Mo Lan had become after Xia ruofei had nursed her back to health for three days. Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ve tried my best. As for whether I can beat Yang Su He from Agriculture and Forestry University ...” The Garden Club president, Xia Cheng, heard this and quickly said,””It doesn’t matter, Mr. Xia. Whether you win or lose, just do your best!” Xia ruofei glanced at Xia Cheng and said,””President Xia, I’m not done yet ... I want to say that I’m not sure what grade this pot of Black Orchid has reached, but as for whether it can be compared to yang suhe from Agriculture and Forestry University ... I don’t think it’s a big problem!” “Hmph! What big words!” A cold voice rang out from behind Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei didn’t need to turn around to know that the voice belonged to Chen Song from Agriculture and Forestry University. He was also the senior Chen that Peng Hui had invited to court Lu You. Xia ruofei rolled his eyes and ignored Chen song’s words without even looking back. “Let’s go in!”He said to Lu You and the others.
