Chapter 747: Flower Guardian (2)

After the eight surveillance hornet’s bees were in position, Xia ruofei sat up straight and stared at the laptop screen. He was a completely different person from his lazy self just now.

After about ten minutes, Xia ruofei heard messy footsteps and laughter coming from the corridor outside. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The sound insulation of this private room was very good. If Xia ruofei’s hearing was not better than the average person ‘s, he would not be able to hear the sound coming from outside.

He guessed that Lin Qiao and the others had arrived.

Sure enough, a moment later, the surveillance footage on the laptop showed that young men and women were entering the neighboring Room 607 one after another.

Xia ruofei quickly found Lin Qiao in the crowd.

He released his spiritual power and directed a few of the Hornets to adjust their position and direction. He aimed the camera at Lin Qiao’s position.”This must be the main monitoring position tonight.”

The lights in the private room were also turned on. The colorful lights and the slowly changing spotlights gave the room a grotesque feeling. The monitoring screen also switched from night vision mode to visible light mode, and the quality of the picture was better than before.

After the students entered the box, some of them quickly ran to order songs, and more people sat down on the sofa and chatted in twos and threes. Some people even picked up the dice cup and ran to the small bar to play games.

Two waiters walked in. One of them was carrying a large shopping basket. He took out peanuts, melon seeds, fruit plates, marinade, nuts, and other snacks from the basket and placed them on the table. The other was carrying three cans of beer and placed them on the table.

Lin Qiao was considered a quiet girl in the class. She didn’t rush to sing like the other girls. Instead, she sat down in a corner and chatted with a few girls she was close to.

She had originally planned to come over to play for a while and leave at nineo’ clock. This way, her classmates would not think that she was acting alone, and her mother and Xia ruofei would not worry.

The students began to sing one by one, and some even opened beer bottles. The entire box was filled with toasts to each other, and the atmosphere became more and more lively.

......

These students had just experienced the unbearable life of their third year in high school. Now that the college entrance examination was over, they could finally relax. This kind of relaxation after the heavy pressure made these students more or less let loose and drink. This kind of behavior was absolutely impossible in high school.

This was a very normal behavior.

There might have been some restraint in the restaurant just now, but in an environment like a nightclub, under the setting of the red and green lights in the private rooms, many people slowly let go.

The three boxes of beer were quickly finished, and someone immediately called for another three boxes.

Under the persuasion of others, many girls also picked up the cans of beer.

In contrast to Room 607’s heated atmosphere, Room 605 was very quiet. Xia ruofei had even turned off the stereo. He sat alone in front of his laptop, staring intently at the screen.

At this time, his eyes focused, and two rays of light shot out from his eyes.

Hu Lili appeared on the screen with a beer.

Xia ruofei plugged in his headphones and put them on. A noisy sound immediately came from the headphones.

Xia ruofei made some settings on his computer and set the sound source to the Super – tiny camera closest to Lin Qiao.

Xia ruofei’s super hearing came into play at this time. He quickly identified Hu Lili’s voice among the noisy sounds.

“Lin Qiao, why are you just sitting there and not drinking?” Hu Lili asked Lin Qiao with a smile. Come, come, come, I’ll toast you!”

“Hu Lili, I can’t drink. Let me toast you with juice ...” Lin Qiao said with a friendly smile.

“Who can’t drink?” Hu Lili enthusiastically sat beside Lin Qiao.”Let me tell you, you’re born with the capacity for alcohol. It’s up to you how much you can drink. Besides, the alcohol content of this beer is so low. You’ll be fine just by taking a sip!”

“I’m really sorry, I’ve never drunk alcohol before ...”Lin Qiao said.

“Are you looking down on me because of my poor grades?” Hu Lili pretended to be angry.”Lin Qiao, you’re not such a snobbish person, are you?”

“No, no...” Lin Qiao quickly waved her hand.

“Then have a drink with me!” Hu Lili said,”how about this? I’ll do this, you can do whatever you want!”

“Alright! Hu Lili’s really bold!”

“She’s a heroine!”

“Applause!”

The students around them also started to kick up a fuss.

Under such circumstances, Lin Qiao couldn’t refuse. She reluctantly nodded and picked up a can of unopened beer from the table. She opened the can ring and clinked it with Hu Lili ‘s. She said,”You too! It’s not good to drink too much ...”

Xia ruofei nodded to himself. This girl still knew how to take out an unopened bottle of wine. This meant that she was still on her guard.

“I’m fine! What’s this little bit of wine?” Hu Lili said forthrightly,”Lin Qiao, you’ll be a famous university student in the future. You have to take care of us unemployed people!”

After that, Hu Lili raised her head and gulped down the can of beer. Under such circumstances, Lin Qiao could only take a big sip.

The bitter cold beer made Lin Qiao, who rarely drank, blush. She couldn’t help but cough and almost choked.

The students all applauded and cheered. Hu Lili also gave Lin Qiao a thumbs up in satisfaction and then went to find someone else to drink with.
