“Understood!” Zheng Yongshou said sternly,”this subordinate will never forget his duty! The island will be where the people are!”

Xia ruofei nodded in satisfaction and said,””Alright, let’s go! You guys should go back and cultivate as well!”

With that, Xia ruofei brought Song Wei and Ling Qingxue onto the black Phoenix flying ship.

“Farewell, martial granduncle!”

“Farewell, master!”

Li Yifu and Zheng Yongshou both bowed respectfully, and only when the black Phoenix flying ship disappeared into the horizon did the two of them straighten their bodies and return downstairs.

After Li Yifu and Zheng Yongshou completed the necessary handover, they returned to their room and officially began their closed – door cultivation.

Zheng Yongshou also took over the control of the Taixu xuanqing formation and officially took over the defense of the Paradise Island.

After flying for more than two hours, Xia ruofei’s Black Phoenix flying ship had returned to the skies above the three mountains.

Xia ruofei quickly found the villa district by the river. He steered the black Phoenix flying boat across the night sky and hovered above the villa’s rooftop.

It was already night time when they arrived, and the next day was New Year’s Eve, so Song Wei and Ling Qingxue didn’t go home. Instead, they stayed in the jiangbin villa community.

The next day, on New Year’s Eve, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue went home.

Song Wei wanted to go home to spend the Spring Festival with her parents, but Xia ruofei, who was alone, could spend the Spring Festival with Ling Qingxue and Ling Xiaotian. However, in order to not favor one and discriminate against the other, he decided not to go to Ling Qingxue’s house. Instead, he went to Hu Zi’s mother’s place to spend the Spring Festival with his godmother and Lin Qiao.

Early in the morning on New Year’s Eve, after Song Wei and Ling Qingxue went home, Xia ruofei drove to Hu Zi’s mother’s neighborhood.

He took the elevator to the duplex unit on the top floor. As soon as he rang the doorbell, he heard urgent footsteps coming from inside, and then the door opened.

When Lin Qiao saw Xia ruofei, she immediately smiled in surprise and shouted,””Brother ruofei! You’re finally here! Hurry and come in!”

Lin Qiao was wearing a milk – patterned fardown jacket with a pair of cute bear Cotton Slippers. Her hair was let down casually, and she looked youthful and energetic with a touch of playfulness.

Xia ruofei had not seen Lin Qiao for a long time. This time, he realized that Lin Qiao was even more beautiful than when she was in high school. She was even more attractive without her immaturity.

“Qiao’ er, Happy New Year!” Xia ruofei said with a smile as he changed into his slippers.

“Today is New Year’s Eve, the last day of the year. Tomorrow is the new year!” Lin Qiao chuckled and said,”brother ruofei, it’s too early!”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, then he laughed and said,””When we were young, we felt that New Year’s Eve was even more lively than the Spring Festival! The New Year’s Eve dinner is on New Year’s Eve, right? The Spring Festival Gala is on New Year’s Eve, right? And he changed his clothes on New Year’s Eve! Chinese New Year’s Eve is the most beautiful day of the year!” “That’s true!” Lin Qiao said,”I used to look forward to the new year, but later …”

Lin Qiao stopped, but Xia ruofei already understood what she meant.

After Lin Hu’s death, the family had been in grief. As time passed, the pain in their hearts was gradually sealed. So, it might be fine on normal days, but when it came to Chinese New Year and festivals, other families would be happy. Only in her family, there were only the mother and daughter. It was inevitable that she would be reminded of the scene.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Qiao’ er, let’s not talk about this anymore. We’ll be lively during the new year in the future!” See, I’m here to spend the new year with you guys, aren’t I?”

“En!” Lin Qiao nodded heavily. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Where’s godmother?”Xia ruofei asked.

Chapter 1929: the first Prince!

In the next few days, Xia ruofei’s days of cultivation were finally not so boring.

Although he spent more time on the spirit body joint cultivation every day, because he used the time array, his own cultivation time was not affected. Instead, he had a lot more time.

Of course, the extra time could not be wasted. Hence, Xia ruofei was very busy every night.

In the beginning, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue could not let go of this. However, after a few days, the two of them gradually became more and more excited. Xia ruofei, on the other hand, was so happy that he had forgotten about his home.

Other than the day when Luo Qingfeng had finished consolidating his cultivation and was preparing to return to the star Seizer sect on his flying sword, Xia ruofei had gone out and personally sent off his most capable subordinate. The rest of the time, he had been staying in the luxurious suite with his two girlfriends.

Seven days passed in the blink of an eye.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue’s cultivation improved by leaps and bounds every day. After more than ten days, the two of them had actually touched the bottleneck of refined Qi level 8.

As Xia ruofei’s cultivation level increased, the effect of the combined spirit and body cultivation improved.

Xia ruofei’s own cultivation had also improved greatly. Other golden core cultivators could not even imagine him using purple origin crystals to cultivate without caring about the cost.

In fact, Xia ruofei did not know that even during the peak of the cultivation world, only the geniuses of the big sects could enjoy such treatment.

Hence, after more than ten days of cultivation, although Xia ruofei did not show any signs of breaking through to the advanced stage of the Golden elixir realm, he had improved a lot compared to when he had just broken through in the trial Pagoda. His Foundation was also extremely solid.

Xia ruofei, Song Wei, and Ling Qingxue all wished to continue cultivating like this, but they still had to leave for a while.

It was because the Spring Festival was in two days.

It was New Year’s Eve tomorrow, so both Song Wei and Ling Qingxue had to spend it with their families.

On Xia ruofei’s side, although his own family was no longer around, his godmother, Lin Qiao, and many friends were still at the three mountains.

The Spring Festival was definitely the most important Festival for Chinese people.

Hence, Xia ruofei decided to make a trip back to the three mountains.

He had also considered whether Li Yifu needed to return to the United States for the Spring Festival. After all, although Li Yifu had no children, he still had nephews, nieces, and other younger generations. Now that they were all living in the U.S., They would definitely want Li Yifu to return home.

Xia ruofei had already made preparations to let Zheng Yongshou take charge of the Peach Blossom Island.

Zheng Yongshou’s array Dao level was not bad, and he had also learned the basic control of the Taixu xuanqing formation, so there was no problem for him to stay and guard the Peach Blossom Island.

Moreover, Zheng Yongshou was already all alone, and he was currently cultivating on the Paradise Island, so there was no need to specially transfer him over.

However, when Xia ruofei asked for Li Yifu’s opinion, Li Yifu unexpectedly said that he would not be going back for the new year.

Li Yifu had already started to break through the bottleneck of the Golden core stage. In the past few days, he felt that the hope of breaking through was getting greater and greater. He was preparing to strike while the iron was hot and go into seclusion for a period of time. Therefore, even though the Spring Festival was a very important Festival, he did not want to delay his cultivation because of it.

Naturally, Xia ruofei would respect and support Li Yifu’s decision.

And he still let Zheng Yongshou stay.

Zheng Yongshou had just finished dealing with the trivial matters at the peach blossom company. He could at least return to the three mountains after the Lantern Festival. There was still enough time.

If Zheng Yongshou stayed on the Peach Blossom Island, Li Yifu would be able to break through in seclusion without any distractions.

Zheng Yongshou naturally obeyed Xia ruofei’s decision. After experiencing the effects of the Taixu xuanqing formation and Luotian formation, Zheng Yongshou couldn’t stop. He couldn’t wait to spend every second in the Yanhuang building. He didn’t want to waste a single second. Therefore, he happily accepted the task Xia ruofei gave him.

After the arrangements on the peach source Island were made, Xia ruofei and the other two were ready to return to the three mountains.

Li Yifu and Zheng Yongshou sent the three of them to the rooftop of the Yanhuang building.

Xia ruofei released the black Phoenix flying ship, then turned around and smiled at Li Yifu.””Foster husband, since you’re not planning to go back for the new year, then you should peacefully cultivate in seclusion on the Paradise Island. Leave the other trivial matters to old man Zheng to handle, including the safety of the Paradise Island, the control of the array formation, and so on. You don’t have to worry about them and just focus on cultivating!”

“Alright! Thank you for your care, martial granduncle!” Li Yifu said respectfully.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,””I hope I can hear the good news of your breakthrough the next time I come.”

“This disciple will definitely do his best!” Li Yifu said..
