Xia ruofei frowned when he heard that. However, before he could say anything, pang Hao, who was beside him, said unhappily,””Liu Hang, what do you mean? Can’t RUO Fei leave the Army earlier?” Liu Hang spread his hands innocently and said,””I didn’t mean anything else! I’m just concerned about Xia ruofei! If there was any stain in the Army, the file would have to be brought to the local area. My dad works in the Civil Affairs Bureau, so he has some say in this. If RUO Fei really gets punished, it’s best to think of a way to get rid of it, or it’ll affect her future ...” Xia ruofei could tell that Liu Hang was probably unhappy that Jian Jia was the former class monitor after he became the center of attention. After all, he had always been the center of attention. That was why he deliberately spoke ill of Xia ruofei and secretly showed off his father’s power. Of course, it could also be that Liu Hang did not like Xia ruofei because of the grudges they had in school. However, Xia ruofei felt that Liu Hang’s behavior was ridiculous. He had no intention of competing for the limelight, but Liu Hang treated him as a threat. How petty. Pang Hao’s eyes widened as he said,”do you look like you’re going to help RUO Fei?” You ...” “Chubby boy, that’s enough ...” Xia ruofei interrupted pang Hao and looked at Liu Hang.”Thank you for your concern, class monitor. I’ll look for you if I need anything.” “MMH! You don’t have to be polite with me!” Liu Hang said with a fake smile on his face. At the same time, he looked at the students around him with a sense of superiority. Xia ruofei looked at him indifferently and then turned to Yuan Lili. He asked with a smile,””Oh right, why don’t I see your fiancé?” Yuan Lili could tell that Liu Hang and Xia ruofei did not get along. As the host, she was thinking about how to resolve the awkwardness. Seeing that Xia ruofei had changed the topic, she immediately smiled and said,””My husband is still in New York! He’s very busy with his investment bank work, so he could only rush back on the day of the engagement. Today is just a small gathering between us classmates, and it’s also my bachelor party. We’ll hold our wedding in the United States. ” “So it’s like this! “It’s not easy for successful people like you ...”Xia ruofei said with a smile. “What successful person! “I’m just trying to make a living abroad ...” Yuan Lili said humbly, then continued,”by the way, since everyone is here, let’s not stand here and talk. Let’s go to the hotel!” “Yes, yes, yes. Let’s talk at the hotel!” Liu Hang immediately said,”my car can fit four people. Lili, you can sit in my car!” “Alright!” Yuan Lili said with a smile. “I came in RUO Fei’s car, let’s get in his car later!” Guan Ping said. Hearing that, pang Hao immediately said,”ruofei, you’re driving!” Then I’ll take your car too ...” Liu Hang was stunned for a moment and then asked,””Ruofei, you just left the Army and you’re already buying a car! I’ve been working for more than three years, and I only bought a Toyota Ruizhi last year ... Sigh, I spend a lot, so I can’t save money!” “By the way, what car did you buy?” he asked. “Great Wall pickup truck,” Xia ruofei said with a faint smile. “A pickup?” Liu Hang showed an exaggerated expression and said,”who still drives a pickup truck these days? RUO Fei, you’re not joking with me, right?” “What’s there to joke about?” Xia ruofei shrugged his shoulders and said indifferently,”I think the pickup is quite convenient! It’s also very practical for work. ” “What?” Liu Hang immediately asked. Ruofei, have you settled your work? Where do you work? Why do you need a pickup?” Xia ruofei felt that Liu Hang was really annoying. However, since it was Yuan Lili’s treat today, he did not want to make the atmosphere too stiff. So, after thinking for a while, he said,””I didn’t plan to settle down. I’m now planting my own vegetables in the suburbs!” “Grow vegetables? You went to suburbs to be a farmer?” Liu Hang’s expression was very exaggerated.”Why didn’t you come to me earlier? My dad is the chief of the Civil Affairs Bureau, so our family can help with the resettlement after retirement!” “I think it’s good to start your own business.” Xia ruofei said with a slight frown, his face showing a trace of impatience. Liu Hang showed a look of understanding and said,””That’s true. The placement of retired soldiers is worse than that of changed military officers. Moreover, you have a high school diploma, so it’s not easy for you to be authorized! So you don’t have to settle down, it’s actually quite wise to get more retirement fees ... Besides, it’s not a bad time to grow vegetables! If you work hard, it’s not a problem to earn a few thousand Yuan a month. ” He seemed to be thinking for Xia ruofei, but in fact, he was belittling Xia ruofei. Guan Ping and pang Hao couldn’t stand it anymore. Seeing this, Yuan Lili quickly said,””Let’s not chat here. Who else is driving? Let’s split up and go to the hotel!” Another two students who had driven over also tried to smooth things over and invited everyone to sit in their cars. There were only twelve or thirteen people in the group, so four cars were naturally more than enough. Liu Hang’s words seemed to have an effect. The girls who were very friendly to Xia ruofei did not ask to ride in his car after hearing that he was a “vegetable farmer”. In the end, only Guan Ping and pang Hao were in Xia ruofei’s pickup truck. Along the way, Guan Ping and pang Hao criticized Liu Hang for being unkind. Xia ruofei, on the other hand, did not take it to heart. In his eyes, Liu Hang’s sense of superiority was not worth mentioning at all. In fact, it was very ridiculous. Very quickly, Xia ruofei followed the car in front and arrived at a restaurant by the min River. Xia ruofei looked at the sign. This restaurant was called Hong Tian restaurant. Xia ruofei, who had grown up in Sanshan city, had heard of it. It was considered a long – standing brand that specialized in authentic min cuisine. As Xia ruofei’s car was the last to enter, he was led to a parking lot further away. When Xia ruofei parked the car and walked into the restaurant with pang Hao and Guan Ping, they heard Liu Hang’s loud voice. “What are you guys doing? I clearly said on the phone that I want to book Lakshmi Pavilion, and now that my guests have arrived, you’re telling me that Lakshmi Pavilion has already been booked?” Liu Hang slapped the front desk angrily. The front desk manager carefully explained,”supervisor Liu, I’m really sorry. After I received your call, I immediately went to the front desk to confirm the reservation. However, Lakshmi Pavilion has indeed been reserved. So, I arranged for you to go to Ru Yi Pavilion, which is opposite. I also sent you a text message.” “A text message?” Liu Hang immediately took out his mobile phone. Sure enough, there was a text message from the manager. He had been visiting the campus of No. 2 middle school with Yuan Lili and the others just now, so he did not notice the text message. “I don’t care about your text messages.” Liu Hang closed his phone and said,”we only get together once every ten years, and you arranged a trashy room like the Ruyi Pavilion for me? Do you still want to keep your hotel? Go and coordinate a change of private room for me immediately! I’m determined to get this Lakshmi Pavilion tonight!”
