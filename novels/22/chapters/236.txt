Chapter 237: The power of the blood Red Dragon (1)

Ling Qingxue’s eyes widened and she asked,”dad, what are you saying?” What shield! RUO Fei is my boyfriend!” “Really?” “Of course, he was going to visit you!” Ling Qingxue said,”it’s precisely because I haven’t told you about this that I told him to wait!” At first, Ling Xiaotian was a little suspicious. After all, Ling Qingxue had always said that she didn’t want to go on blind dates. Later on, she had no choice but to tell him that she had a boyfriend. No matter how he looked at it, she seemed to have moved out at the last minute as a shield. But now that Ling Xiaotian saw his daughter’s solemn vow, his heart wavered. Ling Qingxue saw that Ling Xiaotian still did not seem to believe her and could not help but say,””Dad, why do you not trust me? How about I call ruofei and ask him to come over tomorrow morning?” “Don ‘t, don’ t, don ‘t! I believe you!” Ling Xiaotian quickly said. How could I not trust my precious daughter ...” Ling Qingxue shot a glance at her father, who was grinning hideously. She pouted and said,””I think you just don’t believe me. Ruofei and I were thinking of preparing a surprise gift for you! Since you don’t trust me anyway, I might as well call ruofei and tell him that it’s fine to give him a present. I’ll keep the blood Dragon for myself ...” The moment Ling Xiaotian heard the words ‘Blood Red Dragon’, he could not sit still any longer. He stood up and said,””What? Blood – Red Dragon? Daughter, where did you find the Blood Red Dragon?” How big is it? How’s the quality?” Ling Qingxue deliberately avoided looking at Ling Xiaotian and said,””Did I say Blood Red Dragon? Did you hear it wrong?” Ling Xiaotian’s heart felt like it was being scratched by a cat. He walked in front of Ling Qingxue and said with a smile,””Qingxue, you can’t just say half of what you want to say! By keeping him in suspense, aren’t you asking for your father’s life? Tell me, how is the blood Dragon?” Only then did Ling Qingxue put on a look of reluctance and said,””I didn’t see it either! RUO Fei called today to say that he’s ready. It’s a pair of top quality blood red Dragons!” “Top – grade? Or a pair?” Ling Xiaotian asked in disbelief,”Qingxue, did little Xia really say that?” Ling Qingxue nodded and said,”yes, RUO Fei would definitely not lie to me.” “But ... You said that he’s my shield, so forget it ...” Ling Qingxue said.”He’s already helped me ‘block arrows’. How can I get a pair of top – tier blood red Dragons? Wouldn’t that be a huge loss?” Ling Qingxue deliberately emphasized the words “top quality Blood Red Dragon”. The flesh on Ling Xiaotian’s face couldn’t help but tremble. He quickly said,””Don’t forget it! Qingxue, when did daddy say that I don’t believe you? My good daughter wouldn’t lie to me, right? Since you’ve already prepared a gift for me, then ...” At this point, Ling Xiaotian rubbed his hands and chuckled,””Then hurry up and send it over! Qingxue, let me tell you, there’s a lot to pay attention to when it comes to Raising Dragons. The water temperature, the pH ...” “Stop, stop! Dad, don’t talk to me about your fish farming Scriptures. I don’t understand!” Ling Qingxue said hurriedly. Then, she glanced at Ling Xiaotian and asked,””Dad, does this mean that you agree with me and ruofei?” “This ... I’ll think about it again!” Ling Xiaotian sneered. “Dad ...” Ling Qingxue pouted. “Choosing a son – in – Law isn’t like buying vegetables in the market. You have to give me some time to consider!” Ling Xiaotian said,”I have business dealings with Xiaoxia. You have to give me some time to adapt to the sudden change in role, right ...” “Oh ...” Ling Qingxue pouted and said unhappily. Seeing this, Ling Xiaotian smiled and said,”how about this!” Qingxue, let little Xia come over for a visit these two days, is that okay?” Ling Qingxue rolled her eyes at Ling Xiaotian and said,””What do you mean by” okay “? I think you’re just thinking about that pair of high – Quality blood red Dragons!” Seeing that his thoughts had been seen through by his daughter, Ling Xiaotian smiled awkwardly and said,””I do miss him a little ... But I’m mainly here to test my son – in – Law!” Ling Qingxue’s face blushed slightly, but she felt a hint of sweetness in her heart. She nodded gently. Finally, she told her father about her relationship, and it didn’t seem like her father had any strong objections. Ling Qingxue felt her entire body relax. At this moment, Ling Xiaotian furrowed his brows and muttered,””But Qingxue ... Tomorrow ... Can you still go to the appointment?” Ling Qingxue’s expression changed slightly, and she frowned.””Dad!” “Qingxue, let daddy finish.” Ling Xiaotian hurriedly said,”don’t worry, dad will definitely not force you to do anything you don’t like. As long as you appear tomorrow, you will be able to get over it with your face.” Ling Qingxue was confused and asked,”why?” Can’t we just reject him?” Ling Xiaotian said,”Qingxue, you also know that the company is starting to enter the hotel industry this year. Some time ago, the reception unit designated by the municipal Party Committee began to re – bid, and our Lingyun hotel also participated in the competition. The success of this bid is crucial to the development of our entire company!” “I know that!” Ling Qingxue said. I’ve attended the company’s senior management meeting, but what does that have to do with tomorrow’s event?” Ling Ji restaurant had always been developing in the mass food and beverage industry. Last year, they began trying to enter the hotel industry. Their first hotel in Sanshan city, the ethereal Lingyun hotel, was built according to the four – Star standard. All the facilities were first – Class, and it was basically a five – Star hotel. For the lingji F & B group, which had just entered the hotel industry, it was a great opportunity to gain a foothold in the hotel industry. Ling Xiaotian naturally wouldn’t let go of such a good opportunity, so he immediately organized his forces to fight for a spot in the municipal Party committee’s designated reception unit. “The municipal Party Committee led the bidding this time,” Ling Xiaotian said with a bitter smile.”The person in charge is Deputy Secretary Lin, who is also the Deputy Director of the municipal Party Committee Office. He’s also Lin Feng’s father. Secretary Lin called me yesterday and said that Lin Feng admires you a lot and wants to be friends with you. I thought that Lin Feng was a young man, and even if you don’t like him, it wouldn’t be a bad thing for you to make more friends, so I agreed first. ” At this point, Ling Xiaotian looked at his daughter in embarrassment, then continued,””You didn’t tell me that you had a boyfriend yesterday! Qingxue, if we reject him now, Secretary Lin will definitely hold a grudge against us, and the possibility of us winning the bid will be non – existent ... So, I’m thinking that even if you go over tomorrow, it’ll be fine as long as it’s not embarrassing. ” “Father, this kind of social event ...” Ling Qingxue frowned. “You can just treat it as a normal business social interaction.” Ling Xiaotian said,”don’t worry. I’ll give Secretary Lin a reply in two days. I’ll say that I’ve asked for your opinion and that you don’t want to consider your personal feelings for the time being. Consider it a tactful rejection! If he’s still against our company, then there’s nothing we can do. Even if we don’t win the bid, I, Ling Xiaotian, won’t be so cheap as to sell my daughter!” Ling Qingxue saw that her father had already put it this way, so she couldn’t bear to reject him anymore. Thus, she nodded reluctantly and said,””Okay then ... But you have to call Secretary Lin as soon as possible!” Ling Xiaotian also felt relieved and quickly said,””Definitely! Don’t worry!” After returning to her room, Ling Qingxue was considering if she should tell Xia ruofei about tomorrow’s matter. After thinking for a long time, she sighed and said to herself,””Forget it, I’d better not tell him ... Anyway, I’m just going to deal with it tomorrow. Telling him would only add to his troubles ...” Very quickly, Ling Qingxue put the matter aside and started to look forward to bringing Xia ruofei to see her father in two days. Naturally, her mood became better. Soon, she fell into a deep sleep with a sweet smile ...
