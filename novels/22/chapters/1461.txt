Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei glanced at store manager Liu and Bai Jingjing with a faint smile and walked straight to the door of the Knight XV.

Xia ruofei’s sneer seemed to have provoked Bai Jingjing, but she was no longer as arrogant as before. She mumbled,””So what if you have some stinky money ...”

Store manager Liu wanted to give him a tight slap. She didn’t even plan to argue with him, so what’s the point of talking so much?

Although Bai Jingjing’s voice was soft, Xia ruofei’s hearing was sharp. He gently closed the car door and turned around.””There’s nothing great about being rich. There are many rich people in the world, and I don’t feel that I’m superior to them, but ...”

At this point, Xia ruofei changed the topic and his tone became a little cold.””I remember that you said that my brother would live on the streets after leaving pioneer real estate. You just wanted to use money to threaten my brother and make him stay in your company even if he had to endure the humiliation. Now you’re telling me that you think you’re so great just because you’re rich? Are you even worthy?”

Bai Jingjing gritted her teeth and her face turned red, but she couldn’t refute.

Xia ruofei didn’t seem to be in a hurry to get in the car. He looked at Bai Jingjing and smiled.”Right, besides money, there’s also power, right? Just because your position is higher than my brother ‘s, you can pick on him and find all kinds of reasons to make things difficult for him and suppress him, right?”

Bai Jingjing seemed to have gone all out. She raised her head and said coldly,””So what if I am? I’m going to suppress such an ungrateful thing! So what if you have money? Wouldn’t he be kicked out of pioneer real estate with his tail between his legs?”

Guan Ping’s eyes were burning with rage, his hands clenched into fists, his heart filled with humiliation.

Xia ruofei patted Guan Ping’s shoulder and said,””Ping Zi, don’t be impatient ...”

With that, Xia ruofei turned to look at Bai Jingjing. This time, there was a hint of mockery in his eyes.

“Well said! A higher rank can crush a higher rank, so you have the right to not cancel it, right?” Xia ruofei said sarcastically,”that’s a good logic. Simple and crude. I like it!”

Bai Jingjing had a bad feeling, but she still snorted and said,””Hmph! You’re deliberately mystifying!”

Store manager Liu tugged at Bai Jingjing’s clothes and said,””Manager Bai, please stop talking!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

By then, manager Liu had completely sobered up. He could tell that this friend of Guan Ping’s was not an ordinary person. Other than the two moves earlier, Xia ruofei seemed to be very friendly. However, he had an aura that made people look up to him. He was definitely not an ordinary person.

Xia ruofei looked at the two of them with a half – Smile on his face. He took out his phone and dialed Liang Weimin’s number without hesitation.

It wasn’t too late yet, and Liang Weimin hadn’t gone to bed yet, so he picked up the call very quickly.

“Happy New Year, ruofei!” He said with a bright smile.

The third day of the first month of the lunar year wasn’t over yet, so everyone basically greeted each other with New Year’s greetings when they met or called each other.

“Uncle Liang, it’s so late, I hope I didn’t disturb your rest!” Xia ruofei chuckled.

“No, no, I’m just watching TV!” Liang Weimin said,”Qi Chao didn’t come back for the new year either. His house is cold and empty. Other than watching TV, there’s nothing to do ...”

“Uncle Liang, you’re criticizing me!” Xia ruofei said,”brother Liang can take a break anytime. I didn’t restrict him!”

Liang Weimin laughed and said,”it’s this kid who didn’t want to come back!” He was so carefree overseas! Why would he be willing to come back and listen to our nagging!”

“He’s mainly busy with his business. The farm business has been busier during this period. Please understand!” Xia ruofei smiled and explained on Liang Qichao’s behalf.

Liang Weimin was also in a good mood. How could he not know what Liang Qichao had been doing in Australia? Because of this, Grandpa Tang He even called Liang Weimin and praised Liang Qichao, which made Liang Weimin very happy.

“Hahaha! I’m just saying. We’re so happy that Qi Chao can do his business properly! It doesn’t matter if I don’t go home for the new year!” Liang Weimin said.

“Mm! When uncle Liang isn’t too busy, you can bring Auntie to visit brother Liang. ” Xia ruofei smiled gently and said,”Paradise Farm’s environment is not bad. You guys can take it as a vacation!”

“Good, good, good! I’ll definitely go there when I have the time, mainly to check if that kid is slacking off!” Liang Weimin smiled and asked,”by the way, ruofei, why are you calling me so late at night?”

Xia ruofei looked at Bai Jingjing and store manager Liu.

Actually, when the two of them saw Xia ruofei take out his phone, they had a bad feeling.

However, they heard Xia ruofei talking about his daily life on the phone and did not know what he was up to.

Most importantly, Xia ruofei had addressed him as uncle Liang. There did not seem to be any leader with the surname Liang in the company.

Bai Jingjing was the company’s famous social butterfly. She quickly scanned through the company’s top management and confirmed that there was no one with the surname Liang. She could not help but feel more at ease.

When she saw Xia ruofei looking at her, she snorted.””You’re bluffing ...”

Xia ruofei glanced at Bai Jingjing and asked,””Uncle Liang, I’d like to ask how much authority you have over Xianfeng real estate.”
