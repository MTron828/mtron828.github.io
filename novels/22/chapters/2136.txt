2137 Black Sam (2)

Xia ruofei stopped in his tracks. He slowly turned around and looked at the group of savages.

The Barbarian could actually speak the language of the human society, and it was English? Xia ruofei was quite surprised, but he didn’t take the other party’s threat seriously.

The barbarians quickly made a path for a white man with a big beard. He walked in front of them. He was wearing a pair of jeans, a pair of tattered leather boots, and an old jacket.

However, he could at least tell that the bearded man’s clothes were from a civilized society. He also spoke English, which surprised Xia ruofei. At least this man had a way to communicate. He wanted to know more about the island.

Xia ruofei smiled as he put down the bag of bread in his hand. Then, he stood up and walked towards the bearded man.

“stop!””Stand there and don’t move!” The bearded white man shouted.

The bearded white man saw Xia ruofei smiling and stopped in his tracks. He felt embarrassed for being so nervous just now.”What happened to me just now? Could there be a man more powerful than me, Black Sam, in this world? He’s just a lucky kid who managed to save his life in the sea disaster ...”

Thinking of this, the bearded white man snorted and said,””Stand there and don’t move!”

Then, he turned to a “Savage” who had an animal skin around his waist and said,””Carson! Go and get his backpack ...”

“Yes! Your Highness!” The “Savage” replied.

Xia ruofei looked at this “Savage” called Carson in surprise. Even though his skin was tanned and his hair and beard were messy, he could still tell that he was Caucasian from his facial features. He had also spoken in English very clearly.

So these weren’t savages! “This is getting more and more interesting ...” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile, especially when he heard Carson call the bearded man “His Highness.” He almost burst out laughing.

If the bearded white man in front of him was really a Prince, he would probably be the most down – and – out Prince in the world!

Carson walked over to Xia ruofei. The bearded man grinned and said,””Instant noodles, carbonated drinks, bread, ham sausage ... I haven’t eaten these things in so many years. I really miss their taste!”

The few “savages” beside the bearded white man couldn’t help but gulp. Obviously, they were also very envious, but they knew very well that they would never have the chance to enjoy these things.

Carson walked up to Xia ruofei and grabbed a few bags of bread from the beach. He stuffed them into his backpack.

Xia ruofei smiled and did not stop him.

When Carson put everything into his backpack and was about to pick it up, he suddenly felt a blur in front of his eyes. A hand reached out and pulled the backpack over. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Carson turned around and saw Xia ruofei smiling as he put on his backpack.””Thank you for helping me pack my things!”

Seeing this, the bearded white man was furious and shouted,””How audacious! Kid, how dare you disobey my order? Are you tired of living?”

Black Sam? Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment and couldn’t help but smile. After hearing the bearded man’s self – introduction, he finally understood why Carson had called him “Your Highness.”

There was a legendary pirate named Sam berami, who was also known as the “pirate Prince.” In the 18th century, he built a pirate base on a small island in Venezuela and hid many treasures on the island. These treasures were not discovered until 1984, and all of them went to the Venezuela government.

So this guy considered himself The Pirate Prince! No wonder he called the island “Sam Island.” It must be his own name.

‘This big – bearded man is quite narcissistic ...’ Xia ruofei thought to himself.

The bearded white man saw Xia ruofei ‘s’ strange ‘smile and was even more exasperated. He shouted,””Eastern kid! It seems that if I don’t teach you a lesson, you won’t know fear! Carson! Pop! And you! You! All of you, attack him together and show him the power of the soldiers of Sam Island!”

The “Savage” that the bearded white man had pointed out immediately stepped out. There were about six or seven of them, all holding their primitive weapons, and surrounded Xia ruofei.

Carson, who was the closest to Xia ruofei, beat him to it and threw a heavy punch at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei smiled and took a light step to the side. Then, he pulled on Carson’s arm and he stumbled a few steps forward.

The other “savages” had also rushed over. Xia ruofei was like a tiger in a flock of sheep. He took them down in a few moves without even breaking a sweat.

To be honest, these barbarians who had been malnourished for a long time had terrible combat power.

Of course, Xia ruofei was not too harsh on them. To him, they were just pitiful people who were trapped on the island.

Seeing this, the bearded white man’s face turned even uglier. He snorted and said,””You have some ability! It seems like I have to do it myself ...”

After saying that, he strode forward, counting his fingers as he walked, making a crackling sound.

When the “barbarians” saw that the bearded white man had personally made a move, they all revealed looks of respect. At the same time, some of them looked at Xia ruofei with sympathy.

In their eyes, this Eastern kid was clearly going to be out of luck.

Mr. Sam wasn’t someone ordinary people could mess with. This big bearded white man’s years of abuse of power had long made these “barbarians” have no heart to resist, and everyone had a psychological shadow.

Xia ruofei was still standing there calmly. He looked at the strong, bearded white man in front of him and smiled.

The bearded man shouted when he was three to four meters away from Xia ruofei. He sped up and charged at Xia ruofei, swinging his big fist at Xia ruofei’s face.

Xia ruofei easily reached out his hand to block it. The moment their arms touched, Xia ruofei’s expression changed and his eyes revealed a look of surprise.

“Eh?” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but cry out.

Then, he suddenly increased his speed and appeared behind the bearded man like a ghost. At the same time, he stretched out his hand and twisted the bearded man’s thick arm behind him.

Xia ruofei pressed down lightly and the bearded man immediately bent down involuntarily, wailing in pain.

Xia ruofei had already locked his acupuncture points, so he could not exert any strength at all. He could only cry out in vain.

The savages were dumbfounded. They had never thought that the God of War, Mr. Sam, would be so vulnerable. It was an unbelievable scene, but it had actually happened in front of their eyes.

“Tell me! What’s your name?” Xia ruofei asked indifferently.

“Sam ...”

“Tell me your real name!” Xia ruofei interrupted him and shouted.

The bearded white man trembled and quickly said,””Puyol ...”

“Isn’t that a nice name? What’s his name, Sam?” Xia ruofei said with a smile,”don’t you know that pirate Prince Black Sam only lived to 28 years old? Using such a short – lived name, aren’t you afraid of being unlucky?”

This big – bearded pjoll was a Westerner, so how would he know if it was auspicious or not? In his eyes, the legendary pirate Sam Bellamy was a great hero, so he called himself Black Sam.

Xia ruofei immediately asked,””Tell me the truth, who did you learn your Kung Fu from?”
