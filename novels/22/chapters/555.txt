Chapter 556: I’ll give you ten feet of respect (1)

Xia ruofei looked it up on the internet. The person who cheated was called Liu Jinsheng. This incident was really exposed on the news at that time.

But the strange thing was that Liu Jinsheng not only cheated boss Qian of tens of millions, but many people also invested in it. However, he did a good job in avoiding the law, all in the name of investment. In the end, although the court ruled that boss Qian and the others won, Liu Jinsheng actually did not have to bear any criminal responsibility.

Moreover, Liu Jinsheng’s assets were almost all negative, so he could not afford to pay these hundreds of millions of Yuan.

The final result was that boss Qian and the other victims won the lawsuit, but they couldn’t get any compensation at all.

Liu Jinsheng had already found a way out. He had no assets under the law. Even if he was forced to do it, he could not find a project that could be executed. In the end, he could only let him get away with it.

The most infuriating thing was that Liu Jinsheng couldn’t pay a single cent. Then, there was a media company that did an in – depth report, saying that he had returned to his hometown in xiangnan province and spent all his time drinking and drinking. There were even reporters who followed Liu Jinsheng and reported on him.

However, it was useless. Boss Qian and the others applied for enforcement in court, but they still did not recover any money.

This guy had already thought of a way out. He didn’t have any assets or savings under his name. On the surface, all his expenses in xiangnan province were paid by others. Even if boss Qian and the others knew that there was something wrong with Liu Jinshan, they couldn’t do anything to him.

He had no choice but to swallow his broken teeth.

The internet was so advanced nowadays that Xia ruofei could basically understand the ins and outs of the matter through the online reports.

Xiangnan province was a key word. If Liu Jinsheng was a local tyrant born and raised in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province, Xia ruofei might really need to consider it. After all, he had no connections in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province. However, Liu Jinsheng was from Hunan Province. After the incident, he was basically only active in Hunan Province. In that case, Xia ruofei would have room to operate.

However, it was almost time to board the plane. Xia ruofei did not say much and just kept quiet.

He and master Luo boarded the plane according to the normal procedures. The plane was slightly later than usual before it took off from Xiaoshan airport and flew to Sanshan city.

More than an hour later, the plane landed at the Yongle International Airport in Sanshan city on time.

Xia ruofei had given Lei Hu a call before they left. Hence, when Xia ruofei and master Luo walked out of the departure hall, Lei Hu was already waiting outside with his Mercedes – Benz.

By the time he returned to Tao Yuan farm, the sky had already turned dark.

Xia ruofei arranged for master Lei to have dinner at the farm’s canteen and then arranged a reserved room for master Luo at the mixed – use building.

Xia ruofei had specially instructed Lei Hu to provide master Luo with the best food and accommodation during his stay at the three mountains.

After returning to the villa, Xia ruofei told Ling Qingxue that he was safe. The two of them talked on the phone for a long time, saying endless sweet words.

Then, Xia ruofei, who had been on the road for the whole day, felt a little tired. He did not enter the spirit map space again and just lay down to sleep.

The next day, Xia ruofei invited master Luo to have breakfast at the farm canteen. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Master Luo had also received instructions from boss Qian, so he was also quite anxious. After eating, he said impatiently,””Mr. Xia, can you show me those iron – Skin Dendrobium fresh strips? This matter can’t be delayed!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”my friend still has the Dendrobium No. 1 strips!” Master Luo, don’t worry, I’ll show you around the farm first. You’re the most experienced in making iron – skinned maples, so tell me what you need first, and I’ll ship the fresh strips over when I’m done. ”

“Boss Xia, there’s no need for any special preparation to make the iron Kaede bucket.” Master Luo said,”as long as we have enough space and some equipment, it will be enough!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”master Luo, I’ll let Lei Hu show you around the farm first. I’ll go and contact the fresh iron – Skin Dendrobium strips now. If you need anything, just let Lei Hu know! I’ll get him to cooperate with you!”

“Alright!” Master Luo said.

Xia ruofei called Lei Hu over and said,””Hu, take master Luo on a tour of the farm first. If he needs anything, do your best to cooperate with him. If he really can’t do it, get manager Li’s construction team to cooperate with you. There’s only one condition anyway. Master Luo’s requests must be met with all your might, understand?”

“Let them in, brother Xia! I know what I’m doing!” Lei Hu said.

Xia ruofei returned to the villa after giving his instructions. He was not in a hurry to prepare the fresh iron – Skin Dendrobium strips. Instead, he took a good nap in the villa for half a day and only called Lei Hu in the afternoon to ask about the situation.

Master Luo’s requirements were not very high. He just needed a special venue, some pots and stoves made with mud magic, and some other tools.

According to master Luo’s request, Lei Hu had already asked manager li to immediately organize people to build a row of mobile houses. He had also arranged for the mud workers to build the pot and stove under master Luo’s guidance. As for the site, there was a lot of open space on the farm. As long as the construction team made some shelves to dry the iron – skinned Dendrobium according to the requirements, everything would be done under Lei Hu’s coordination.

Xia ruofei asked. It was a simple task and everything should be ready by noon tomorrow.
