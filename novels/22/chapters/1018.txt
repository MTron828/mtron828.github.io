Chapter 1019: Tang He is also tempted_1

Translator: 549690339

The employee of the auction house was fine, but Guo Song was a senior in the industry. He had dealt with almost all kinds of seafood in the first half of his life. After joining the Hengfeng group, he had come into contact with many high – end seafood, so just a glimpse of it had already made him dumbfounded.

“Mister Guo! Mister Guo!”

Guo Song only came back to his senses after Xia ruofei called out to him. He had already forgotten about MA Xiong’s instructions and did not care about his manners. He rushed over in a few big steps and grabbed the dried abalone in his hand like a hungry tiger pouncing on its prey.

The saleswoman who had come with Guo Song was at a loss. Xia ruofei patted him on the shoulder and gestured for him to sit down. Then, he looked at Guo Song with a smile.

Guo Song was naturally more professional than Tang He in the identification of dry sea products.

He looked at it over and over again for a long time, and his expression became more and more excited.

Guo Song raised his head and asked in a trembling voice,””Mr. Xia, may I ... Open the sealed package and take a look?”

Xia ruofei smiled and made a “please” gesture. The abalones did not need to be sealed in the spirit map space. Xia ruofei had just added them according to the normal storage method of dried abalones. Moreover, if they were to be auctioned in a few days, the packaging would definitely have to be changed.

Even if it was a simple sealed bag, it had to be designed so that it could match the grade of the precious one – headed abalone. Furthermore, it had to be printed with the LOGO of paradise Corporation.

After getting Xia ruofei’s permission, Guo Song immediately opened his suitcase and took out a pair of delicate scissors. He carefully opened the sealed package.

Then, he took out a pair of white gloves from the suitcase and put them on. He then carefully picked up the one – headed abalone.

Guo song’s suitcase was like a treasure chest, with all kinds of tools.

Guo Song moved closer to smell the abalone and then observed the shape, meat quality, and the layer of frost on the surface of the abalone.

He also took out a strong flashlight from his suitcase and observed the meat quality and the permeability of the abalone under the strong light.

There was even a small, delicate scale in Guo song’s suitcase. After repeatedly identifying the abalone for a long time, he took out the extremely accurate scale and weighed the dried abalone.

When the final weight was 623 grams, Guo song’s hands trembled uncontrollably, and his excitement was beyond words.

“It’s really a top – grade one – headed abalone!” Guo Song mumbled to himself,”the body shape is perfect. It’s plump and full, and it has a fresh luster ... It’s simply perfect ...”

Another Hengfeng auction house employee, Luo Jiahao, couldn’t help but remind him in a low voice,””Manager Guo ... Manager Guo ...”

Guo Song came back to his senses and quickly showed an apologetic smile to Xia ruofei, saying,””I’m sorry, Mr. Xia. I was too excited to see such a beautiful and perfect abalone and lost my composure for a moment ...” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s okay!” Mr. Guo, Chairman MA asked you to appraise our abalones. Are you satisfied with them?” Is there a problem with our dried abalones going to the auction?”

“I’m satisfied! Of course I’m satisfied!” Guo Song said without thinking,”by the way ... Mr. Xia, Mr. MA said that your company is auctioning 20 to 30 abalones? May I ask if the quality is the same?”

In the beginning, Guo Song did not think much of it. However, the big boss had personally pointed it out and told him to be polite and respectful to Xia ruofei, so he had maintained the necessary courtesy. In reality, he still did not believe that such rare one – Head abalones could appear in batches.

After seeing the dried abalone, Guo song’s heart wavered a little. At the same time, he also had a faint expectation.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”this batch of abalones is all here. Mr. Guo, you can take a look for yourself!”

Only then did Guo Song realize that the two unremarkable paper bags also contained dried abalones.

He hurriedly went up to open the paper bag. When he saw the heavy abalones in the paper bag, his breathing couldn’t help but become rapid.

Guo song’s performance was very similar to Tang He ‘S. He first looked through the abalones quickly. After confirming that all the abalones were very big and heavy, at least more than one Jin, Guo Song began to pick up one abalone repeatedly, and then put it down to take another.

He looked at them fondly for five to six minutes, as if they were beautiful women.

In fact, Guo Song had been in this industry for half his life. His love for such precious dried sea products might be no less than that of a beautiful woman.

Xia ruofei was also very patient. He just sat there and waited with a smile.

After a long while, Guo Song reluctantly put the abalone into the paper bag, raised his head, and said,”Mr. Xia, this batch of abalones can be put up for auction. Thank you for choosing Hengfeng auction house. I believe this auction will become a grand event for the upper class of Hong Kong!”

Guo Song still felt a little regretful. He wasn’t sure about the relationship between MA Xiong and Xia ruofei, so in his opinion, the best plan was to find a way to get Xia ruofei to agree to sell the abalones to Hengfeng seafood trading company.

If they were to auction it off, Xia ruofei and the Paradise Corporation would naturally gain both fame and fortune. The Hengfeng auction house that hosted this event would also gain a lot of attention, while the seafood trading company would miss a good opportunity to become famous.
