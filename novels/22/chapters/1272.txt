Chapter 1273: A sudden thought (2)

Translator: 549690339

“I understand, Chairman MA,” Guo Hongjiang said gratefully.”Thank you!”

“Hahaha! You’re too polite!” MA Xiong nodded at Xia ruofei and walked towards the exit of the horse track with his bodyguards.

At this moment, the staff had already secured the carriage. Xia ruofei immediately jumped into the carriage without hesitation.

The container truck had been modified to transport horses. Naturally, the smell inside the truck was not pleasant. However, Xia ruofei did not care that Youyou had experienced environments ten to a hundred times worse than this when she was undergoing her sniper training. She had even been soaked in a cesspit for a few hours. This was nothing to her.

Guo Hongjiang was touched, but he didn’t say anything. He just remembered it in his heart. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Guo Hongjiang’s car was a Maybach. However, he did not get into that car. Instead, he opened the door of the container truck and sat in the driver’s seat.

Xia ruofei was a guest he had invited. It was not the right way to treat a guest if he stayed in the stinky carriage. However, today was a special day. He had no other choice but to do this.

However, if Guo Hongjiang took the Maybach, he would not be able to get over it.

Guo Hongjiang sat in the container truck, which gave the driver a shock. He felt very uncomfortable.

Guo Hongjiang glanced at him indifferently and said,””Drive! What are you doing?”

The container truck driver started the car in a hurry. His legs were shaking. The person sitting next to him was a billionaire! If there was an accident on the way, he wouldn’t be able to afford it even if he sold himself!

Guo Hongjiang looked at him and could not help but smile bitterly. How could he drive like this? He dared to drive, but she didn’t dare to sit!

Hence, Guo Hongjiang quickly said,”forget it, you may leave!” You can sit in my bodyguard’s car!”

The driver of the container truck nodded repeatedly as if he had been pardoned. Without a word, he unbuckled his seat belt and jumped out of the car.

Then, he stuck his head out of the window and shouted,””Ah Biao! You’ll drive this car!”

One of Guo Hongjiang’s bodyguards quickly ran over and replaced the driver of the container truck.

Guo Hongjiang’s bodyguards were also worried! They couldn’t even guarantee their safety on the road. Now that the driver was one of their own, they felt a little more at ease.

After some chaos, the convoy left the horse track.

There was a black Mercedes – Benz at the front, back, left, and right of the container truck. Guo Hongjiang’s bodyguards were sitting in the cars. There was also a Maybach at the back. The convoy looked a little strange.

Fortunately, the journey was safe and sound. About 20 minutes later, the team arrived at the horse training base that Guo Hongjiang had specially built near the horse racing field.

It covered an area of about 50 mu, with a special training track and a complete set of auxiliary facilities. The team that served the horses was also stationed here all year round.

In addition to the “star of Hong Kong” who enjoyed the best treatment, there were five other horses in the training base. They were all of good bloodlines and were naturally good for horse racing. They were also undergoing scientific training.

On the way, Guo Hongjiang had informed the training base and had someone specially clear out a large room.

Xia ruofei had said that he would be staying with the star of Hong Kong for the next few days to treat him. Naturally, he could not let him stay in the stables.

As soon as the car stopped, he immediately jumped out of the car and went to the back of the car. After the staff opened the container, he immediately asked,””Mr. Xia, are you alright?”

Xia ruofei laughed.”Director Guo, I’m fine. The ‘star of Hong Kong’ is in good condition too. Don’t worry!”

Guo Hongjiang heaved a sigh of relief. He was naturally concerned about the “star of Hong Kong” ‘s condition. However, he could not ask about it under such circumstances. He could only ask about Xia ruofei’s condition first. Otherwise, he would be neglecting his guest.

The staff entered the carriage one after another. Everyone worked together to move the star of Hong Kong into a large room that had been prepared in advance.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”director Guo, please get someone to prepare some more Chinese medicinal herbs according to the list I gave today. It’s best if there are more of them. I need them tomorrow!”

“No problem!” Guo Hongjiang said without hesitation,”the medicinal herbs will be delivered tomorrow morning.”

Although Guo Hongjiang could not see what was so special about the black ointment, at least the “star of Hong Kong” was in good condition and his emotions were stable. The situation that he was worried about did not happen. This meant that Xia ruofei’s treatment might be effective.

The hope in Guo Hongjiang’s heart grew.

Xia ruofei said,”there’s nothing else. Just leave this to me!” I’ll sleep here tonight ...”

Guo Hongjiang was touched and said,””Mr. Xia, I’ve really neglected you! I’ll definitely thank you properly after this matter is over!”

“You’re welcome, director Guo. Since I’ve accepted this task, I’ll do my best.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”by the way, there’s no need for so many people to gather here from tomorrow onwards. I need some peace and quiet here. Also, the treatment process has to be kept a secret ...”

“I understand! I understand!” Guo Hongjiang quickly said,”no one will disturb you here, but I will have them wait at the training base. If you need anything, you can just look for them!”

“Alright, director Guo, it’s getting late. You should go back and rest!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll let you know if anything happens here.”

“I’ll be staying at the training base tonight. ” Guo Hongjiang looked tired and said,”I’ve handed over the work matters to someone else. If there’s nothing particularly urgent, I’ll be at the training base these few days.”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but sigh when he heard this. Guo Hongjiang was the head of a billion – dollar Corporation! He was busy with work every day. Although he could handle some work at the training base, it was enough to show how much Guo Hongjiang valued the “star of Hong Kong.”

Of course, Xia ruofei could be one of the reasons. After all, Xia ruofei was a guest and had stayed for the “star of Hong Kong”. As the host, Guo Hongjiang could not go back to work.

No matter what Guo Hongjiang was thinking, Xia ruofei would not try to persuade him. He just smiled and said,””Director Guo, I’ll do my best, don’t worry!”

“Then I’ll leave it to you, Mr. Xia!” Guo Hongjiang said sincerely,”I’m staying next door. Mr. Xia, if you need anything, call me anytime!”

“Alright, rest early, director Guo!” Xia ruofei said.

Guo Hongjiang looked at Xia ruofei deeply and did not say much to thank him. He just nodded and left the room with his men.

The room was spacious and had a large bed. Xia ruofei could rest on it.

After closing the door, he walked to the star of Hong Kong and checked his injury again with his spirit.

Although it had been less than an hour, the fracture seemed to have recovered a lot. Basically, the calf bone had grown back together, with only a small crack at most.

Xia ruofei was overjoyed. If it wasn’t for the fact that the wound hadn’t fully healed, he would have untied the star of Hong Kong. After all, if it was tied up for a long time, it wouldn’t be good for the blood circulation and would be bad for the body.

This was also one of the reasons why a horse could only be euthanized after it suffered a fracture. Youyou couldn’t always tie the horse up like this. One or two days was the limit. Compared to the recovery period of more than three months, this was meaningless.

Considering that his broken bones had not fully healed, Xia ruofei eventually gave up on the idea of unsealing the “star of Hong Kong.”

He kept using his spiritual power to calm the “star of Hong Kong” down. The “star of Hong Kong” was also very calm, even calmer than usual. He sneezed from time to time and would sometimes turn his head to look at Xia ruofei with a trace of affection in his eyes.

Xia ruofei hesitated. He was worried that if he went to sleep, the “star of Hong Kong” would kick his legs a few times at night in a bad mood. He might touch his wounds. After all, he was still in pain.

However, if he didn’t sleep and just stayed up all night, it would be better to avoid staying up all night even though it wasn’t a big problem for his physical fitness.

At that moment, a strange thought suddenly popped up in his mind ...
