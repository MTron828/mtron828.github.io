3363 Tower of Trials “5th floor -Translator: 5496903It was like a bug in a game. Of course, it was a very good feeling.

Ling Qingxue said,”I feel like my mind has become much clearer, and my control of true Qi seems to have become more refined!” It’s also much easier for me to store and retrieve items from my storage ring and control my flying sword with my mental power! Ruofei, this yellow jade Spirit is too powerful!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”aren’t I amazing?” How did the yellow jade Spirit become the powerful one?”

“You’re also very powerful! How did you manage to find such a powerful yellow jade Spirit?” Ling Qingxue said with a smile. Then, she said dejectedly,”look at me ... It took me more than ten hours to find a piece of yellow jade essence. It’s so embarrassing!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. Ling Qingxue’s luck was extremely bad. She didn’t have a cheat – like device like the sensory mirror, and she was sent to a barren area where there was almost no Topaz essence. It could be said that she was already very lucky to have found the only Topaz essence in that area within the mission time.

Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”you’re not allowed to tell Weiwei about this when you get back!” Otherwise, I won’t let you off!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I understand, I understand!” I promise I won’t tell!”

Then, Xia ruofei said seriously,””Qingxue, when we move around in this small space, you must remember not to leave my side. If there is any danger, you must not take care of it on your own. However, you must call for help and remind me immediately!”

Ling Qingxue nodded and said,””I know!”

“Also, when I remind you, you must remember one thing. You must never resist!” Xia ruofei said,”I will use a special Dharma Treasure to protect you. Just don’t resist the force of the Dharma Treasure!”

Xia ruofei had made it clear to Ling Qingxue in advance that if there was any danger that could not be resisted, he would ensure Ling Qingxue’s safety first and put her into the spirit map space.

Xia ruofei’s control of the spirit map space had reached a very high level, so he could easily open up an independent small space in the space. Even if Ling Qingxue entered the spirit map space, she would only be in this small space and could not see the whole space.

That way, Ling Qingxue would only know that Xia ruofei had a special protective magical equipment and would not see the other secrets of the spirit map space.

To Xia ruofei, the spirit map space was the foundation of his life. Hence, he did not want to expose her even if she was his closest girlfriend.

Although Ling Qingxue did not know what was going on, she had always trusted Xia ruofei. Hence, she nodded without hesitation and said,””I understand! Don’t worry! I’ll listen to you!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”that’s good!” Let’s start exploring and see what secrets this wasteland has!”

“En!” Ling Qingxue nodded her head.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue held hands. They randomly chose a direction and carefully walked forward.

The two of them walked for about 20 meters. When they passed by a pile of camel thorns, Xia ruofei suddenly felt a sense of danger. He pulled Ling Qingxue’s hand and retreated a few steps.

Almost at the same time, the pile of camel’s thorns suddenly exploded. Countless tiny thorns flew towards Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue.

As Xia ruofei retreated, he had already summoned the qushuang flying sword and the traveling Jade immortal sword. He pulled Ling Qingxue and jumped on the qushuang flying sword, speeding up their retreat.

Under the control of Xia ruofei’s spiritual energy, the blue travel immortal sword formed a protective light screen. The camel thorns bounced off it.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue were unscathed, but they broke out in cold sweat.

Especially when he saw that the camel’s thorn was not cut into pieces when it touched the blue travel immortal sword, but merely bounced off, his heart sank.

This seemingly ordinary plant’s hardness had already exceeded his imagination.

Ling Qingxue was also a little shocked.””RUO Fei, why is this thing so strange? I’ve seen quite a few of them before and even walked past them many times, but nothing like this has ever happened!”

Xia ruofei said seriously,”Qingxue, you must remember that although the environment here is very similar to the trial Pagoda’s fourth level, you can’t treat it as the same as the trial Pagoda’s fourth level!” Otherwise, it’s very likely that an unremarkable little thing will be able to take your life!”

At this moment, Xia ruofei saw new content on the mission bar in his perceptual mirror. He immediately looked at it with a serious expression.

Lines of text appeared in the quest prompt.

Congratulations, you’ve broken the record for the trial Pagoda’s fourth level mission. You’ll receive an additional reward, and the reward content can be chosen from one of the two ...

When Xia ruofei saw the familiar words, he felt as if he had returned to the third level of the Tower of Trials. The additional reward he received was almost the same as the one he received on the third level. He could also choose to upgrade the elemental storage Pearl or randomly send a companion over.

Now that Xia ruofei had successfully met up with Ling Qingxue, he naturally would not choose to teleport another companion. After all, he had already learned from Shen tianfang’s experience and had some psychological trauma. This kind of environment tested human nature. Moreover, Ling Qingxue’s presence had made him more apprehensive. It was obviously not a wise choice to teleport another companion over under such circumstances.

Furthermore, the upgrade of the energy storage Pearl was extremely attractive to Xia ruofei. The first two times, he had given up on this reward option because he was obsessed with bringing Ling Qingxue to his side as soon as possible.

Now that Ling Qingxue was by his side, Xia ruofei did not hesitate any longer. He immediately chose to upgrade the energy storage Pearl.

In the reward options provided this time, when upgrading the energy storage Pearl, he could also get an additional 1000 origin crystals. To Xia ruofei, this was a small surprise. Origin crystals were still quite precious, especially to golden core cultivators.

After Xia ruofei made his choice, the reward for completing the fourth floor’s regular mission appeared in the mission bar.

The contents of the reward also made Xia ruofei a little surprised. It was five hundred pieces of Topaz essence.

There was no doubt about the value of the Topaz essence. It could be said that if it was brought to the cultivation world on earth, any piece of Topaz essence would cause everyone to fight crazily for it, let alone 500 pieces.

However, the mission prompt bar also stated that the Topaz essence could only be used in the secret realm and could not be taken out of the secret realm.

This meant that it was impossible to use the yellow jade essence to exchange for spiritual stones in the cultivation world on earth.

Of course, no one would exchange the yellow jade essence for spiritual stones unless they were out of their minds.

It was even more impossible for a ‘nouveau riche’ like Xia ruofei, who had no lack of spiritual stones.

Therefore, this restriction had no effect on him.

After the announcement of the reward, a dot of light appeared in the field of vision of the perceptual mirror, along with a guiding arrow.

Clearly, that should be the place to receive the reward.

Ling Qingxue saw that Xia ruofei suddenly stopped talking and stood on the qushuang flying sword in a daze. She couldn’t help but ask,””RUO Fei, what’s wrong?” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Oh!” Xia ruofei said. It was nothing! The reward for completing the mission should be ready. Let’s go and get it!”

“Mission reward?” Ling Qingxue asked curiously,”the fourth level of the trial Pagoda has already given us so many benefits. Are there more rewards?”

“Of course, since it’s a mission and we’ve completed it, and we’ve even broken the record, of course we’ll be rewarded!” Xia ruofei acted as if it was a matter of course. He smiled and said,”let’s go! Let’s go receive the award! Don’t leave my side on the way, it seems that this wasteland has become dangerous!”

“Yes, yes!” Ling Qingxue nodded.

Xia ruofei pulled Ling Qingxue along as they rode on the qushuang flying sword. They followed the direction of the arrow on the perceptual mirror’s map and carefully flew towards the location of the marked light spot.
