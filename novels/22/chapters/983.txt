When Ling Xiaotian heard this, he subconsciously looked at Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei had a relaxed smile on his face as he nodded at Ling Xiaotian and said,””Uncle Ling, Song Wei isn’t an outsider. Just say what you have to say.”

Ling Xiaotian nodded his head and told him everything that had happened. He didn’t try to hide anything, and he didn’t exaggerate anything. He just told him everything objectively.

Song Wei’s expression became uglier and uglier after hearing this. She had thought that it was a normal spot check, but the law enforcement officers ‘working attitude was a little rough.

Now that she heard Ling Xiaotian’s words, Song Wei finally understood that this so – called ‘joint inspection’ was actually a temporary gathering of Tian Mingyi and inspector Wu’s scoundrels.

This was a restaurant opened by Xia ruofei’s girlfriend’s family. Xia ruofei had set the dinner at Ling Ji private kitchen to help this restaurant build connections.

And now, these people had caused the shop to close down right under Xia ruofei’s nose.

Moreover, the entire matter was based on the Ling Ji private kitchen. Director Wu, Tian Mingyi, and the others were already arrogant to the point that it made one’s hair stand on end!

“Chairman Ling, I really didn’t expect them to be so lawless!” Song Wei said to Ling Xiaotian. Don’t worry, I’ll definitely get justice for you!”

“Thank you, miss song!” Ling Xiaotian said gratefully.

“Speaking of which, my dad should be thanking you guys!” Song Wei said with a straight face. If he didn’t come here to eat today, how could he have the opportunity to see such a real situation?”

At song Qiming’s level, every time he went to a lower unit, even if he did not say hello and dressed in plain clothes, he could hardly hide from the countless pairs of eyes. It was not easy to see the truth.

Song Wei nodded at Ling Xiaotian, then took out her phone and called song Qiming.

Song Qiming and his wife were already on their way.

The Audi drove smoothly on the road. Song Qiming took out his phone and looked at the caller ID. He picked up the call and asked with a smile,””Wei Wei, where are you? I’m telling you, don’t be late!”

“I’m already here!”Song Wei replied. Dad, where are you guys?”

“They should be here soon.” Song Qiming asked,”why? My precious daughter is getting impatient? Is little Xia here?”

“He’s here, but ... If you don’t come, we won’t be able to have this meal!”Song Wei said jokingly.

“What’s going on?” Song Qiming asked with a slight frown.

Song Wei thought for a while and said,”let’s wait until you’re here!” Seeing is believing, I’ll wait for you at the door later ...” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Girl, you’re keeping me in suspense ...” Song Qiming laughed and scolded.

“Alright, I won’t talk to you anymore!” Song Wei said with a smile. Please hurry up ...”

Song Wei hung up the phone and said to Ling Xiaotian,””Chairman Ling, my father is about to arrive. I’ll go to the door to pick him up, don’t worry! I will definitely give you a satisfactory explanation for this matter!”

How could Ling Xiaotian not be at ease? Secretary song was there in person, and his precious daughter had already made her stand. What was there to worry about?

“Then let’s go out and welcome them together!” He said quickly.

“No need, no need!” Song Wei replied with a smile. I’ll just wait outside!”

Even though Song Wei said so, the person who came was the official from San Shan city, the third most important person in the entire Southeast province. How could Ling Xiaotian just sit in the private room and wait? No matter what Xia ruofei’s relationship with the family was, he still had to be polite.

Therefore, after a few rejections, everyone still walked out together.

Very quickly, the group of people arrived at the first central room. Ling Xiaotian did not see the people from the inspection team. He called a waiter over to ask about the situation. Only then did he find out that after the group of people had found a lot of problems from an egg, they were now all in the restaurant’s kitchen. It looked like they were prepared to make things worse.

The kitchen was a very important place in a restaurant. At the same time, it was also a place where problems could easily occur. Tian Mingyi and director Wu had called everyone to the kitchen together to find all kinds of faults.

“Hmph!” Song Wei snorted and said,”President Ling, let them be!” I’d like to see how lawless they can be!”

Ling Xiaotian smiled and said,”that’s good too. We can’t delay the welcome of Secretary song for this kind of person!” Let’s go out first!”

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue were the last to leave. They could not help but secretly give Ling Xiaotian a thumbs up.

Everyone arrived at the entrance of the private restaurant. After waiting for a while, they saw a black Audi driving over steadily.

The car stopped in front of the private restaurant. Secretary Guangzhi Cao got out of the car first and opened the door of the back seat. Zhang opened the door on the other side almost at the same time.

Song Qiming and Fang Liyun got out of the car.

They had already seen Xia ruofei and the others standing at the entrance from a distance, so they quickly walked over as soon as they got out of the car.

Song Qiming chuckled.”Xia, I’m treating you today. As the host, I’m late. I shouldn’t have come!”
