2771 Duty – bound (1)

A bitter smile appeared on Xia ruofei’s face. He didn’t expect that playing a game would bring so many aftereffects. He had always been a person who was afraid of trouble.

Seeing Xia ruofei’s bitter face, Feng Jing couldn’t help but smile and said,””The most interesting one is the Chinese Football Association. They have always been criticized for pretending not to see the voices of the fans and acting like ostriches in the sand. This time, they reacted very quickly, but because they couldn’t contact you, the company has been replying to them that you haven’t returned to the company during this period of time, so they also shouted on the internet, hoping to meet you and discuss how you’re serving the country. ”

“Ha?” Xia ruofei could not help but raise his eyebrows.

“That’s true!”Feng Rao said. So, if you don’t come back this time, I’ll have to call you. After all, if this matter was not handled properly, it would cause a huge negative impact. “Your image on the internet has always been very sunny, positive, and full of positive energy, including the traffic jam on the Weibo server last time, you gave an signed jersey to the programmer who worked overtime in the middle of his illness, and so on. You’ve won a huge wave of likes on the internet. Now that the Chinese Football Association has sent out an invitation, it’s just that there hasn’t been an official letter yet. But the influence of the Weibo platform can’t be underestimated, so we still have to respond appropriately. ” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Feng Rao looked at Xia ruofei and asked,””I need to know your thoughts first.”

Xia ruofei smiled.”So, you’re saying that no matter whether I personally agree or disagree, our public relations department has a corresponding plan?”

“That’s for sure. That’s their job!” Feng Jing continued,”but everyone, including me, is inclined to think that you should accept the invitation. After all, you should reject the offer to join the national team ... Although your situation is special and the PR department and New Media Department have come up with a relatively safe response, it’s not a good idea. The damage to your image is inevitable. All we can do is to minimize the losses.”

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said,””Although I don’t really care about all this, there’s one thing I’m sure of. If I refuse, I’m afraid our public relations staff will have a hard time! Hahaha ...”

Feng Rao shrugged and said,”that’s the money they’re taking!” Therefore, the decision will naturally be based on your personal opinion! You can only have one voice in paradise Corporation. No one can force you to do something you don’t want to do. ”

Xia ruofei said seriously,”thank you, sister ran!” But you’re right. If the national team really needs it, I shouldn’t refuse. It’s just that I still have a lot of things to do recently. I’m afraid ... By the way, the national team doesn’t have any particularly important matches recently, right?”

Feng Ye nodded and said,”after the incident with the Chinese Football Association, we immediately looked up the relevant information. In fact, the most important event for the national team is naturally the World Cup qualifiers next year. There might be a series of warm – up games or cup or friendly games to warm up before that. I heard that these games are also very important.”

“What do you mean?” Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and asked.

“It should be related to the national team’s international ranking.” Feng Jing said,”as long as it’s an international A – Level event, there are points. The number of points determines the ranking. The International ranking will affect the level of the national team in the drawing of lots in the Asian Qualifiers. If they can be listed as a first – tier team, they can naturally avoid some of the strong Asian teams in the first stage of the group stage. Now the national football team’s ranking just happens to be hovering between the first and second – tier, so even if it’s a warm – up match, we must strive for as many victories as possible. ”

“Of course, compared to the World Cup qualifiers, these warm – up matches are much less important.” Moreover, the Chinese Football Association will carefully choose their opponents for the warm – up match, neither too weak nor too strong. If the team is too weak, they won’t have many points, and if the team is too strong, the Chinese Football Association can’t take them down ... So in fact, a lot of work is done outside the field. Even if you are called up to the team, you don’t have to participate in such a game. ”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly,”for the national football team, the Chinese Football Association has been so worried!” It’s just that sometimes I don’t seem to be using my strength in the right place, and I often mess around ...”

Feng Rao couldn’t help but burst out laughing. The Chinese Football Association’s foreign aid policies and U23 policies had been criticized by people in recent years. Even people who didn’t care much about domestic football could see such news from the news or online forums from time to time.

Xia ruofei continued,”in principle, I can accept the recruitment of the national team. However, I can’t be like other professional players. I can’t be on call or even train with the team in closed – door training. I can participate in some important games as much as possible when the time allows.” Therefore, I really need to talk to them face to face, but I believe that we can come to an agreement. ”

After all, the Chinese Football Association was only an Industry Association in name. In reality, it was under the leadership of the general Administration of sports. With Xia ruofei’s connections in the capital, it would not be a problem to settle the Chinese Football Association as long as his conditions were not too outrageous.
