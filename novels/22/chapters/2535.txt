“RCD Espanyol suspected of bringing in Chinese players again.”

“The mysterious owner of the number 25 Jersey, is he a fellow Countryman of Wu?”

“Before the winter window closes, the Spaniards sign in again.”

……

Many media outlets had reported on this matter. Of course, this news wasn’t very big, so it wasn’t placed in a very striking position. The report wasn’t very long either. It was basically a third or fourth – Page tofu block.

However, after Wu Lei joined La Liga, he also attracted the attention of a large number of Chinese sports media to Spain. Some major media even sent reporters to Barcelona, mainly to collect news about Wu Lei.

Whether it was the domestic sports media or The Sports Reporters stationed in Barcelona, they were used to looking for news about Wu Lei in the local Spain media. As long as it was about Wu Lei, they would translate it into Chinese, regardless of the size, extract the main points, and then give a more gimmicky title. Basically, one report was enough.

Moreover, readers preferred to read such reports. After all, it was a report and evaluation of Wu Lei by a well – known foreign sports media.

Therefore, these sports media would have people keeping an eye on the major local sports media in Spain every day in order to find reports about Wu Lei immediately.

As a result, the news about the Spanish team’s suspected re – Introduction of Chinese players quickly entered the sights of the Chinese sports media.

The Chinese sports reporters were naturally very excited when they saw this news.

Many of them even went on the official website of the Spain football Association to check it out immediately. The results were completely consistent with the reports of the Spanish media such as the daily sports and Maca.

The Chinese sports reporters could almost confirm that the name was indeed in Chinese Pinyin.

The reporters couldn’t suppress their excitement. Once this piece of news was confirmed, it would be big news! Although the Spanish team still had a Chinese young player, Zhang aojie, it was still a youth team after all. And this No. 25, XIA RUOFEI, was a real first – tier player, Wu Lei’s teammate!

However, the name made the reporters very confused. They searched the Internet in China, but they did not find a professional player with the pinyin of “XIA ruofei.”

It wasn’t that no one thought of Xia ruofei, but it didn’t make any sense. Many people only had this thought for a moment before they immediately denied it.

After all, the names published on the Spain Football Association’s website were in pinyin and had no tones. There were countless possibilities for the Chinese characters corresponding to this pinyin, such as “Xia yingfei,””Xia ruofei,””Xia RUO ...” If the more common surname “Xia” was excluded, there were people in China with surnames like “Xia” or “Xia”. It was just that these rare surnames were relatively rare.

The reporters would rather believe that a professional player with the name “XIA RUOFEI” had joined Espanyol than consider the possibility of Xia ruofei joining.

After all, Xia ruofei was a billionaire and no one had ever heard that he could play football. It was simply a fantasy for him to join the top league and become a first team player!

No matter how brave a sports reporter was, he would not make such a guess.

The Spain Football Association’s website only published the name and did not have any information such as photos. On the Spanish club’s official website, there was no update at all about the signing, and there was no information about number 25 in the player’s information.

As a result, the Chinese sports reporters went to the press officials of the Spanish clubs to verify it, but the answer they received, without exception, was “no comment for the time being.”

Some reporters who were close to Wu Lei looked for him, hoping to get some inside information from Wu Lei, but Wu Lei was naturally tight – lipped and did not reveal a single word. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

There must be something wrong with this unusual situation. The mysterious No. 25,”XIA RUOFEI,” had joined the club without a press conference, a fan meeting, an official announcement, and no updates on the official website. Even the club’s press officer and Wu Lei seemed to have received a gag order and were silent in front of the media.

As a result, the Chinese sports reporters were naturally even more interested. They retold the Western media’s report and added in their own process of verifying it, writing reports and sending them back to China.

Wu Lei’s decision to stay abroad had already caused a sensation. Now that the Spanish club was very likely to bring in another Chinese player, the Chinese fans were suddenly excited.

Soon, a “guess who the mysterious Spanish No. 25 is” event was launched on the internet, and the netizens ‘imaginations started to run wild.

Some netizens found the names of all the registered players of the Chinese Football Association and used software to change these names into pinyin. Then, they did an automatic comparison and found that none of the names had the pinyin of “XIA ruofei.”

This meant that the mysterious new player of RCD Espanyol was not a registered player of the Chinese Football Association at all.

However, this was not a big deal. Many professional players went abroad to study and live since they were young. They all became registered players in the country. In recent years, there were many such situations in China. Of course, with the rise of the Chinese Super League’s gold yuan football, some Chinese players who were on the edge of the foreign League had also exported to sell internally, returning to the domestic league to make a lot of money as “overseas returnees.”
