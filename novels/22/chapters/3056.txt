3057 Gift (2)

Xia ruofei controlled the flying boat and started to descend.

The area where the Tang family’s Manor was located was a rich area, and its biggest feature was that it was vast, sparsely populated, and full of vegetation, so it was easy for him to find a secluded place near the manor and land the flying boat.

The four of them left the swift Boat.

After Xia ruofei kept the swift Boat, he brought Tang Haoran, Song Wei, and Ling Qingxue to the main entrance of the Tang family manor.

It was around eighto’ clock in the evening in Sydney, so the manor was brightly lit. As soon as Xia ruofei walked to the door, he saw the Butler of the manor waiting there. It was obvious that Tang Yitian had arranged for the Butler to be there.

Although Xia ruofei had only said that he would try his best to send Tang Haoran back by tonight, Tang Yitian had made the necessary preparations.

When the Butler saw Xia ruofei and his group, he quickly walked up to them and said,””Young master is back! Mr. Xia, ladies, you’ve worked hard! Mr. Tang is already waiting for you in the manor. Please come in!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Thank you for your trouble!”

The group took the electric car at the entrance and quickly arrived at the main building of the manor.

On the other side, Tang Yitian and Jennifer had already received the report from the door and were standing in front of the door in advance to welcome him.

“RUO Fei!” Tang Yitian greeted him with great enthusiasm. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Hahaha! Big brother Tang, I’ve brought your precious son back!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”hurry up and check. You’re not missing a single hair!”

“Haha!” Tang Yitian laughed.”The child has already acknowledged you as his master. That means he can be beaten or scolded by you. We won’t have any complaints!” Besides, do you think I can’t trust you?”

“Haoran is so obedient. How can I bear to hit and scold him?” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Come on! Let’s go inside!” Tang Yitian said,”the supper is ready. We’re just waiting for you to arrive!”

Xia ruofei looked at Ling Qingxue and Song Wei and said,”Big brother Tang, we still have something to do tonight, so we won’t stay ...”

“It’s so late. Aren’t you going to stay at the manor for a night?” Tang Yitian asked in surprise.

Jennifer also said,”Xia, even if there’s something, you can do it tomorrow, right?” Let’s just stay for one night! Let’s do our part as the host!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know what to say. After all, he had good intentions. He couldn’t possibly say that he had to send his two girlfriends back to China in the middle of the night ...

“Daddy, mommy, master really has something to do. He can’t stay here for the night. But ... Master, you can stay and have something to eat before you leave. You can still make it in time, right?” Tang Haoran said.

Xia ruofei ruffled Tang Haoran’s hair and said with a smile,””Haoran has personally asked us to stay, so let’s have a few bites before leaving!”

They had already set up a banquet and they had waited for an entire night. If Xia ruofei did not even enter the room and left after sending Tang Haoran off, it would be a little unreasonable.

Hearing his son’s words, Tang Yitian hesitated for a moment, then reluctantly said,””Alright then! If you don’t want to stay, then don ‘t, but we’ve agreed that you have to accompany me for a few drinks later!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”no problem!” I’ll accompany you tonight!”

“How can I not know your alcohol tolerance?” Tang Yitian forced a smile. This is giving up my life, right?”

After everyone heard this, they couldn’t help but burst out laughing.

The group walked into the exquisitely decorated restaurant and took their seats on both sides of the long dining table.

Under the Butler’s arrangement, all kinds of delicious food were quickly served. There were also two bottles of red wine from Tang Yitian’s collection. They were all opened and poured into the decanter.

As expected, Tang Yitian and Jennifer didn’t ask where Xia ruofei had taken Tang Haoran or what he had done. They only chatted about family affairs, including some things in the Chinese circle in Australia and some business matters.

Tang Yitian and his wife were more cheerful and easy – going, so the atmosphere of their conversation was always good.

Before he knew it, he had finished the two bottles of red wine and the small jar of yellow rice wine.

Xia ruofei’s expression didn’t change, but Tang Yitian was already a little tipsy.

Xia ruofei looked at the time. They had been having supper for almost two hours. It was almost 10 p.m. Local time. Tang Haoran should be resting.

Thus, he decisively got up and left.

Tang Yitian was a little tipsy as he asked,””Ruofei, it’s so late ... At least let me send you a car! This Manor is in the wilderness ...”

“Don’t worry about it, daddy. Master has his own way!”Tang Haoran quickly said.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Haoran is right. You guys should rest!” Don’t mind us ...”

Although he said that, Tang Yitian’s family still took the electric car and sent Xia ruofei’s group of three to the entrance of the manor.

Xia ruofei reminded Tang Haoran to train harder. Then, he waved goodbye to Tang Yitian’s family of three and walked into the night with Song Wei and Ling Qingxue.

Xia ruofei took out the black flying boat as soon as they entered the small forest near the manor. The three of them boarded the flying boat and flew back to Huaxia.

Song Wei asked Xia ruofei to bring out the tea set and the tea leaves while she boiled water for everyone.

“Ruofei, it’s not a big deal to stay a night in Sydney. We’ve all taken leave. There’s no need for us to travel overnight!” Song Wei said with a smile.

Ling Qingxue pursed her lips into a smile and said,”he probably wants to send us back earlier!” I don’t want to affect his fun outside ...”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”I didn’t think that way.” However, there’s a reason why I insisted on rushing back tonight. ”

“I told you!” Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”tell me the truth!”

Xia ruofei blinked at the two of them and said,””Because I’ve also prepared gifts for you! I can’t wait to take it out and give it to you. It’s not convenient for you to spend the night in big brother Tang’s Manor ...”

“Really?” Ling Qingxue looked into Xia ruofei’s eyes and asked,”don’t tell me you came up with an excuse on the spot!”

“Where’s the most basic trust between people?” Xia ruofei pretended to be angry and said,”look! Isn’t this a gift that I’ve carefully prepared?”

With that, Xia ruofei flipped his hand and two storage rings appeared in his palm.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue were stunned when they saw him. Then, they realized who he was.

“Is this the storage ring you bought from the auction?” Song Wei asked in surprise.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”that’s right!” Just nice, one for each of you! The storage space of the two rings is the same, but the style is slightly different. You can choose!”

With that, Xia ruofei placed the storage ring on the coffee table.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue immediately gathered together, holding a storage ring in their hands. They couldn’t bear to part with it.

...

In the end, the two of them each chose one.

Ling Qingxue tested the storage ring on her finger as she asked,””RUO Fei, how do I use this storage ring?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”this shows the importance of cultivating spiritual power!” There’s a miniature formation on each storage ring. When you use it for the first time, you’ll need to brand it with your spiritual power. This way, only you can open the storage ring. ”

This was the simplest use of spiritual power. Song Wei and Ling Qingxue’s spiritual power cultivation was more than enough.

After Xia ruofei finished, he taught them how to place a spiritual mark on the miniature formation of the storage ring. Both of them succeeded in one try.

Then, Ling Qingxue immediately sensed the space within the storage ring. She cried out in surprise,””Waa! Such a large space, and he could store and withdraw things at will? That’s too convenient!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”a friendly reminder. In theory, you can’t store living things.” Of course, you can store it if you want, but the living thing will die after you store it ...”
