Chapter 1301: Chapter 783 – capital settled_1

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei did not answer Feng Jing’s question. Instead, he asked,””Under the condition of ensuring normal operation funds, how much money can the company raise in a week at most?”

Feng Jing was more familiar with the financial situation of paradise Corporation, so she said without much thought,””If we don’t consider the 170 million from the SASAC, we can probably take out another 150 million, mainly from the cash flow from the two purchases of Yushi cream.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”don’t worry about the 170 million from the state – owned assets Supervision and Administration Commission. Three months is enough for us to raise funds.” By the way ... When’s the next release of the jaded skin cream?”

“Two days later!” Feng Jing said,”if nothing goes wrong, we should be able to buy all of them in a short period of time. If the quantity is the same as before, we should be able to get around 100 million Yuan after deducting the channel fees. However, we might not be able to get the payment in time ...”

“Contact our cooperation channel. We’ll try to get back the 100 million within five days!” Xia ruofei said,”the sales of the jaded skin cream are so hot. I think the distributors will give us face!”

“Alright, I’ll arrange for people to contact them separately tonight.” Feng Jing said,”I think it shouldn’t be a big problem.”

Xia ruofei laughed,”that’s 250 million!” There’s still a gap of 100 million Yuan ...”

“You’re going to transfer the overseas funds back?” Feng Rao asked with interest.

She knew that Xia ruofei had an offshore company overseas. For example, the more than 15 million US dollars he had earned from the truffle auction in Hong Kong had been transferred to the offshore company’s account. If the money were to be sent back to China, it would be enough to pay for the acquisition.

Although Xia ruofei had transferred some of the money to his overseas account, Feng Jing did not have any complaints. This was because, strictly speaking, this money was all Xia ruofei’s own earnings. The company had only sent people to cooperate with him. If she still hoped that this money would go into paradise corporation’s account and be counted as year – end dividends, that would be insatiable greed!

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I don’t have such plans for now.” Let’s just wait and see, maybe there are other ways to make money? I don’t want to transfer the money back unless it’s absolutely necessary. ”

“That’s the best!” Feng Jing chuckled.”If you’re investing in the company, wouldn’t my shares be diluted again?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”yeah!” Be careful or I’ll kick you out and won’t play with you!”

“It doesn’t matter!” Feng Rao said nonchalantly. I’ll be able to earn a large sum of money from the transfer, enough for me to travel around the world!”

“You’re really willing to leave the company?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

Feng Rao smiled but did not say anything. However, she quickly glanced at Xia ruofei and thought to herself,”If I really leave, it’s not just the company that I can’t bear to leave ...

The two of them were just joking and did not continue the topic. After chatting for a while downstairs, the two of them bade each other farewell. Xia ruofei strolled back to the villa.

A one – hundred – million gap in a week’s time was not a small problem for Xia ruofei.

If Mr. Lin of Tongren Hall had not called him today to talk about aweto, he might have had to use overseas funds or borrow from his friends for a short time. However, Xia ruofei did not want to owe anyone, so it was more likely that he would transfer the money directly from his overseas account.

But now, he was thinking about the aweto in the space.

He didn’t know how much aweto Xia Qing had harvested, and he didn’t know how much more Mr. Lin could buy. But considering that Mr. Lin had been promoted to the Deputy Director of the region, his authority should have been much greater. Besides, those aweto were of the highest quality. No matter how much it would cost, Tongren Hall wouldn’t be willing to miss it.

With these questions in mind, Xia ruofei went straight upstairs, locked the doors and windows, and took out the spirit map.

With a thought, he entered the spirit map space.

“Xia Qing!” Xia ruofei didn’t see Xia Qing when he was at the Archean realm. He immediately used his spiritual will to transmit his voice.”Come over!”

At the next moment, Xia Qing’s figure appeared at the Archean realm.

“Master!” He greeted Xia ruofei with a bow.

Xia Qing’s clothes were still stained with quite a bit of dirt, and so were his hands. It was clear that he had definitely been busy harvesting aweto in the mountain and sea realm.

“You’ve worked hard these past few days. ” Xia ruofei asked gently,”how many Cordyceps sinensis have you harvested so far?”

Xia Qing immediately said without hesitation,””There are about 140000 of them that have been processed. The other 10000 can be processed very quickly.”

The most time – consuming part of harvesting the Cordyceps was the excavation. The other processing work was done in the Archean realm, which had a time flow rate of 30 times. In addition, Xia Qing didn’t need to sleep or rest, so the time cost was very low.

“Then let’s take 150000. Xia Qing, you’re pretty fast!” Xia ruofei said happily.

“The total harvest is less than a third ...” Xia Qing said with some shame.

“This is beyond my imagination!” Xia ruofei calculated quickly.”Our wormgrass is of average size. About 1100 wormgrass is 1000 grams in weight. That means 150000 wormgrass can weigh about 136 kilograms!”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing had obviously weighed it before, so she immediately nodded and said.
