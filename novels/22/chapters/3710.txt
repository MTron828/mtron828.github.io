3711 RUO Fei in closed - door cultivation (2)

"Brother Chen is right!" Mu Sheng nodded and said, "I really should be more open-minded ... Let's not talk about this. Come on! Let's drink! Today's biggest harvest is little brother Xia and valley master Liu, you two must drink a few more cups!"

"No problem! This junior is willing to risk his life to accompany the gentleman today!" Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Liu Mansha, who was in a good mood, also pursed her lips and smiled."The heavenly sect's fine wine is not something that can be easily tasted. Even if sect leader mu didn't say it, I would definitely drink a few more cups!"

Chen Nanfeng laughed heartily and said, "everyone must have a good time today! Wine! I'll have enough!"

This meal was a happy one for both the host and the guests. Everyone sat together and chatted about the past and the present while drinking. Even Xia ruofei felt very relaxed and carefree.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

After the meal, Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha took their leave first. They were prepared to set off and return to the sect today.

However, Chen Nanfeng had left Xia ruofei alone. Even Chen Xuan had left.

Xia ruofei was a little nervous, but he still appeared calm. However, he was more or less on guard. After all, Chen Nanfeng was a nascent soul cultivator, and Xia ruofei had killed the first heaven society's elder Shen tianfang in the mystic Luna realm. He had to be extra careful.

Chen Nanfeng smiled and invited Xia ruofei to sit down at the coffee table. Then, he personally made the tea. Xia ruofei could tell at a glance that the tea Chen Nanfeng used was the most precious wild tea of the first heaven society.
﻿
When cultivators drank wild tea for the first time, there was a high chance that they would enter a mysterious state similar to enlightenment and start cultivating involuntarily. Moreover, their cultivation would improve by a large margin. The production of this wild tea was extremely limited, so it was naturally extremely precious.

Chen Nanfeng must have known that Chen Xuan had treated Xia ruofei with wild tea before, but he still did not think it was a waste. It was obvious that Xia ruofei had a very high status in his heart. Chapter 2005: the final battle!

Everyone raised their glasses and drank. After Xia ruofei finished his glass, he smiled and said,"Sect leader Chen, I should be the one to thank you! This time, I've witnessed the wonders of the seven Star Pavilion. It will be of great help to my future cultivation path!" "Talent may sound illusory, but it has a vital influence on cultivation. 

Moreover, it's innate and there's almost no way to improve it. I have to say that the seven Star Pavilion is really a wondrous treasure! The senior who created the seven Star Pavilion is even more impressive!" Mu Sheng sighed.

Then, he couldn't help but sigh,'it's a pity that we didn't get the approval of the artifact Spirit! I'm already an old bag of bones, and that good-for-nothing son of mine is also ... Sigh!"

Liu Mansha smiled and said,"sect leader mu, didn't my disciple also fail to improve his talent?" This more or less depended on a bit of luck! Get over it!"

"That's easy to say!" Mu Sheng said dejectedly,"it's true that Valley master Liu's personal disciple didn't get the artifact Spirit's approval, but you took in an in- Name disciple! It's obvious that miss Lu's talent has improved greatly. You've struck it rich! Moreover, your talent has also been improved in the seven Star Pavilion. Compared to you, we've gained nothing!"
﻿
Chen Nanfeng was in control of the seven Star Pavilion at the time. He more or less knew about Mu Sheng and the others, so he was very clear about everyone's gains in the seven Star Pavilion. As for Lu You's situation, Chen Xuan had also reported it to him after the incident.

Chen Nanfeng chuckled." Brother mu, there's no need to be dejected over this. It's my fate if I get it or if I lose it. Although cultivators fight against the heavens and the earth and pay attention to going against the flow, sometimes an open mind is actually beneficial to cultivation."

"Brother Chen is right!" Mu Sheng nodded and said," I really should be more open-minded ... Let's not talk about this. Come on! Let's drink! Today's biggest harvest is little brother Xia and valley master Liu, you two must drink a few more cups!"
