Chapter 1863: Reaching an agreement (3)

Translator: 549690339

“Alright!” Wu Liqian stood up and smiled.”County Head, I’ll take my leave then!”

Zhu zhihang personally sent Wu Liqian to the door of the office, then turned around and went back excitedly.

Zhu zhihang couldn’t even wait for the next day. He paced back and forth in the office a few times, then quickly walked over to pick up the phone on the desk and dialed Secretary Zeng jianzhang’s cell phone.

“Secretary Zeng, I’m sorry to bother you so late.” Zhu zhihang’s voice had a hint of excitement.”Just now, County Head Wu reported something to me. I think it’s necessary to report to you immediately ...”

“Oh? Comrade zhihang, what’s the matter that you can’t even wait for a night?” Zeng jianzhang asked, half – jokingly.

“This is great news! Secretary Zeng!” Zhu zhihang said,”County Head Wu said that paradise Corporation plans to open a manufacturing factory branch. Their initial intention is to land this project in our Changping ...”

At this time, Zhu zhihang’s Secretary walked in quietly with a kettle in her hand. It seemed that she was going to fill his glass with water.

Zhu zhihang waved his hand at him, indicating that he didn’t need it. The Secretary quickly left and closed the door.

Zhu zhihang then continued to report the information he had just obtained to Zeng jianzhang.

Zeng jianzhang was also very excited after hearing this. He said,””Comrade zhihang, this is a huge surprise! He had to seize the opportunity of the peach blossom company and not let this project run away! Come to my office tomorrow at work, let’s meet up and try to form a Standing Committee as soon as possible to discuss attracting investment!”

“Okay, Secretary Zeng!” Zhu zhihang replied.

The next day, Zhu zhihang came to Zeng jianzhang’s office early in the morning. The two of them talked for more than an hour, completely revolving around the Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory project. Regarding some preferential policies, the two of them quickly reached an agreement.

In order to bring in this project, Changping County had invested a lot of money. First, the land acquisition side had completely agreed to the peach blossom company’s request and agreed to 70% of the transfer price of the industrial land, which was equivalent to a 30% discount. In terms of tax, the first three years of tax and value added tax on County – Level assets would be completely exempted, and the next two years would also be 60% exempted.

In addition, Zeng jianzhang had also made the decision to let the local government undertake the construction of some supporting facilities. Of course, in view of the county’s financial situation, this part of the construction needed to be funded by the peach blossom company, which would then be deducted from the land transfer fee.

Zeng jianzhang also said that if peach blossom company was still not satisfied with these preferential policies, Changping County could still make some concessions in land transfer fees, but this would require approval from the city.

Zhu zhihang was also full of confidence. He felt that paradise Corporation would definitely be satisfied with such conditions. The probability of this project being successful was very high.

The two of them discussed for a while and decided to hold a meeting with the Standing Committee in the afternoon to study this matter. They would also pass the preferential policies they had just agreed on. After it became a collective decision, these promises would take effect immediately.

Wu Liqian naturally received the notice from the county party Committee as soon as possible. When she learned that the Standing Committee would be discussing matters related to attracting investment in the afternoon, she knew that this matter was basically a success. When the other Standing Committee members saw this topic, they would definitely not associate it with the Paradise company. After the meeting, it would be almost impossible for Liu haojun to stop it.

Wu Liqian was very excited. She even wanted to tell Xia ruofei the good news immediately. However, on second thought, she realized that the matter had not been completely settled. Moreover, she was not sure about the preferential policies in the county yet, so she held back and did not call Xia ruofei.

The Standing Committee was to be convened at 3:30 in the afternoon.

Just after threeo’ clock, Zhu zhihang received a call from Zeng jianzhang.

“Comrade zhihang, are you free now?” Zeng jianzhang asked.

“I’m free! Secretary, do you have any instructions?” Zhu zhihang asked.

“I’ll have to trouble you to come to my office!” Zeng jianzhang said,”let’s meet and talk!”

“Alright!” Zhu zhihang’s heart was beating like a drum. He couldn’t help but ask again,”Secretary, could it be that the incident at Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory has something to do with ...”

“Comrade zhihang, don’t think too much!” Zeng jianzhang said with a smile,”this project is of great significance to Changping County. I will definitely support it fully! If it’s something else, let’s talk when we meet! We’ll head straight to the meeting room after we’re done. ”

Zhu zhihang heaved a sigh of relief when he heard that the Standing Committee was holding a meeting as usual and that Zeng jianzhang had expressed his full support. He was afraid that there would be more changes at this critical moment. From the bottom of his heart, he was hoping that the Tao Yuan pharmaceutical factory project could be successfully introduced, even more so than Zeng jianzhang.

This was because Zeng jianzhang would definitely retire from the B – list after this term. Whether he could successfully take over the role would depend on his political achievements in the remaining year. If he could bring in the Tao Yuan pharmaceutical factory project, it would definitely be a huge bonus for him.

Therefore, Zhu zhihang even had some insomnia last night. He tossed and turned until two in the morning before he fell asleep. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

He stood up, took his notebook and teacup, and left the office.

Just like that, Zhu zhihang entered Zeng jianzhang’s office about half an hour in advance, while the other members of the Standing Committee entered the party Committee meeting room at about 3:20. Everyone waited until about 3:40 before Zeng jianzhang and Zhu zhihang entered the meeting room one after another.

Zeng jianzhang sat down and said with a smile,””Comrades, I’m sorry. I was discussing work with County Head Zhu just now and was delayed for a while ... All the Standing Committee members should be here now, right? Then let’s start the meeting!”
