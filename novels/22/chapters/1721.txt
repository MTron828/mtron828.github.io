Chapter 1722: Huaxia’s whirlwind (2)

Only then did Xia ruofei realize that from Li Yifu’s point of view, it was really a desperate thing to break through two levels in a short ten years.

After all, the current cultivation environment was so harsh, and he was almost 90 years old. Even if he was a cultivator, this kind of beginner level cultivation was simply unable to prevent his body from aging.

Xia ruofei’s judgment was based on the spiritual Crystal’s assistance and the premise of the entire Guiyuan Scripture. Li Yifu had no idea about this.

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei said seriously,””Foster husband, cultivating is a heaven – defying act. Even if you die tomorrow, you can’t lose your unyielding will! Otherwise, you’d rather not cultivate and just sit around and wait for your death!”

Li Yifu felt as if he had been hit in the head and quickly said,”Martial granduncle, this disciple knows his mistake! Don’t worry, senior granduncle, this disciple will definitely practice diligently! On the path of cultivation, even if I can’t defeat time in the end, at least I can die without regrets!”

Xia ruofei nodded in satisfaction.””It’s good to think like this! Foster husband, if you have nothing to do in two days, you can go back to United States first! If I find the origin returning Scripture, I’ll contact you immediately!”

Xia ruofei did not want to give the Guiyuan Scripture to Li Yifu yet.

He was well aware of the destructive power a cultivator could bring to the secular world, so it could be said that Li Yifu was in an observation period. If Li Yifu could pass his observation, Xia ruofei would not be stingy with precious cultivation resources like spiritual crystals, let alone the Guiyuan Scripture.

After all, Li Yifu was his master, and he had more than 100 spiritual crystals, which he couldn’t use up at the moment.

Although Li Yifu wanted to stay by Xia ruofei’s side, he did not dare to disobey the orders of his sect elders. He could only lower his head and say,””This disciple will obey!”

......

The content of the press conference was reported in the newspapers the next day.

Although the media reported from different angles, Xia ruofei was a key figure. Basically, every media had spent a lot of time and effort on him.

“A superhero from the eastern world!”

“He saved quohang alone.”

“He created a miracle in the world’s aviation history!”

......

In order to attract attention, the media used all kinds of exaggerated headlines and basically accompanied with large photos of Xia ruofei at the press conference. The article also had a high evaluation of Xia ruofei and he had become an influential figure.

At the same time, some media outlets also reported from another angle.

For example, the article by the “sajutani Morning Herald” named “Xia let us re – recognize the Chinese” was a very typical report.

This was a report that was similar to a reporter’s note. The reporter from the morning pioneer had written this report based on his own intuitive feeling of Xia ruofei.

In the article, Xia ruofei was described as a humble, polite, humorous, and funny person who could speak fluent English. He was very different from the stereotype of Chinese people.

At the end of the article, the reporter wrote,””More and more Chinese people appeared all over the world, and some people still have colored glasses and look at them from a hundred years ago. In fact, most of the new Chinese people are like Xia. They are hardworking, simple, and polite. And the speed of development in Huaxia is beyond our imagination. I’ve been to the capital of Huaxia two years ago, it’s a modern metropolis even more advanced than the tadpole ...”

There were several similar reports. Some television media also focused on Xia ruofei’s answers to questions. For a time, Xia ruofei, a Chinese man, had an unprecedented number of fans in Australia, causing a whirlwind in China.

The Chinese in Australia also felt honored. Originally, due to political reasons, Australia was somewhat xenophobic. The Chinese in Australia also gathered together to help each other. But now, it seemed that the attitude of the local people in Australia had become much friendlier.

When the Chinese walked on the streets, they would even encounter white people who gave them a thumbs up.

Guo Xiaoxiao was an Australian Chinese. After she graduated from University, she came to Australia to study a master’s degree. After she finished her studies, she did not choose to return to China. Instead, she worked for a top 500 company in Australia. She first obtained permanent residence rights and then successfully obtained Australian citizenship through an examination.

Although Guo Xiaoxiao’s career in the company was doing well and she later met her husband, who was also a Chinese student, their salaries were considered middle – Class in Australia and they had their own property in tautani. They could be said to have no worries about food and clothing and could even travel during the holidays, she still had no sense of belonging to Australia spiritually.

This sense of alienation mainly stemmed from Australia’s intentional or unintentional discrimination against Chinese.

In the past few days, after the news of the forced landing of the Australian Airlines came out, Guo Xiaoxiao saw that the hero who turned the tide was her own compatriot and paid more attention to the news.

This time, after the media concentrated on Xia ruofei, Guo Xiaoxiao felt that something was different. In the company, the supervisor, who used to be arrogant, was much more friendly to her.

The supervisor even took the initiative to talk to her about Xia ruofei.””Your compatriot is a great hero!”

Guo Xiaoxiao was very excited. It was the first time she felt so proud of her own country and fellow countrymen in a foreign country.

Although Guo Xiaoxiao had already settled down in Australia, she was still used to the internet world in China. She often visited forums such as Tianya and Mao PU, new media platforms such as Sina Weibo, and even the emerging Short Video platforms such as TikTok and Kuaishou.

After she got off work and went home, she excitedly collected all the news reports about Xia ruofei from the major media and the videos about Xia ruofei from TV shows. Then, she posted them all on Tianya forum.

Guo Xiaoxiao’s Tianya forum account was also quite famous, mainly because she often posted travel posts. One of them was about her and her husband taking a car rental car to travel across Australia with their three – year – old son, which even made the Tianya headlines.

Guo Xiaoxiao carefully took screenshots of the media reports about Xia ruofei and the netizens ‘comments about the Chinese. She also carefully highlighted the key points, translated them into Chinese, and attached them below, then uploaded the pictures.

As for the videos, Guo Xiaoxiao patiently typed in Chinese subtitles.

Her post also became popular in the country.

For reasons that everyone knew, it was more troublesome for domestic netizens to see the content of foreign websites.

It was very convenient for Guo Xiaoxiao to access the domestic websites in Australia.

Most of the domestic netizens were seeing the content she had uploaded for the first time.

Even if someone occasionally climbed over the wall to see it, it was impossible for them to organize it as systematically as Guo Xiaoxiao.

Moreover, the article was full of foreigners praising Xia ruofei and the Chinese. The netizens in China were all excited.

It was nothing to praise oneself, but it was truly good when others praised you.

In the past few years, the Western world had often reported on China as a demon. No matter what China did, there would always be a bunch of Western media criticizing it.

This time, it was completely the opposite. The Australian media sang praises for a Chinese person in unison, and many media outlets reflected on their arrogance and prejudice against the Chinese. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

This made the domestic netizens feel as comfortable as if they were eating iced sour plum soup in summer.

Xia ruofei was already very popular on the internet in China, and now Guo Xiaoxiao’s post added to his popularity.

Very soon, these screenshots were spontaneously spread on the domestic internet by netizens.

Weibo, WeChat, Tieba, forums ...

Reports about Xia ruofei being “praised” in Australia could be seen everywhere. Xia ruofei’s reputation in China had reached a new high.

There were even netizens who called Xia ruofei a “national hero.” If Xia ruofei were to see it himself, he would definitely feel ashamed. Although he felt that he had done a good job, he was still far from being a national hero.

Just as everyone was in a heated discussion, China Daily’s WeChat official account also pushed an article ...
