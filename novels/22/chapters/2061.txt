2062 Reward (1)

“Okay, I’ll take you to your room first!” Monica said with a smile. Then, she glanced at Xia ruofei flirtatiously.”Don’t lock the door after you see the two of them!”

Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat. He asked,””Why?”

“You’ve worked so hard to treat my brother,” Monica said.”As his sister, shouldn’t I reward you?”

“That’s what you said ...” Xia ruofei chuckled.”Am I free to choose that position?”

Monica pouted and pinched Xia ruofei’s arm. Her face was red as she said, “I’ll go get ah Yong and the others!”

After she finished speaking, she walked straight to the other end of the corridor. Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Hey! You haven’t brought me to my room yet!”

“The one at the end of the corridor on the left!” Monica said without turning her head.

Xia ruofei watched as Monica left with flirtatious steps. Then, he dragged his small suitcase and walked back to his room. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

After he returned to his room, he had just sat down for a while when there was a knock on the door.

“Come in!” Xia ruofei said loudly.

Ah Yong and Ah Hua pushed the door open and walked in.

As soon as they entered, the two bowed to Xia ruofei respectfully and said,””Mr. Xia, you were looking for us?”

Xia ruofei nodded and pouted.””Sit down!”

“Thank you, Mr. Xia!”

Ah Yong and Ah Hua sat down on the sofa opposite Xia ruofei, looking a little reserved.

Xia ruofei looked at the two of them and asked,””Your boss is here in Turin?”

“Mr. Xia, brother hai ...” Ah Hua quickly stood up and said.

“Sit down and talk!” Xia ruofei said.

“Yes!” Ah Hua sat down again and said,”brother hai heard that Mr. Xia came to Turin, so he rushed over from Milan overnight ...”

Xia ruofei said,”tell him not to come to the Grao family. I don’t want Monica to think that I have anything to do with the Hong sect.”

“Yes, we have contacted brother hai immediately after you gave us your instructions.” Hua said respectfully,”he’ll be staying at the Hong sect’s Turin branch. He’ll be at your command.”

Xia ruofei nodded. He knew that lui hai must have reported it to Li Yifu, but he didn’t know if Li Yifu would tell lui hai that Xia Tian and Xia ruofei were the same person. According to Xia ruofei’s speculation, Li Yifu wouldn ‘t.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””Actually, I’ll be fine here. I should be returning to China in a few days. Your brother hai doesn’t have to stay in Turin all the time. He can go back to Milan if he has something to do. ”

“We’ll let big brother hai know,” Ah Hua replied.

“There’s something I need your help with,”Xia ruofei nodded.

“Please give me your orders!” Ah Hua quickly said.

“Is there any Traditional Chinese Medicine clinic in Turin?” Xia ruofei asked.

“There are.” Ah Hua thought for a moment and said,”the Chinese medicine in Huichun Hall, Lingzhi Hall, and Chinese medicine Hall are all good. The doctors in charge of the hall are very good. Many local Chinese people often go to them for treatment.”

“Are their medicinal herbs authentic?” Xia ruofei asked.

After all, this was Europe. It was impossible for anyone to grow Chinese medicinal herbs. Therefore, foreign Chinese medicine clinics probably bought medicinal herbs from China. With tariffs and international shipping, the cost would be very high. This did not rule out the possibility that some unscrupulous merchants would buy inferior medicinal herbs.

“Mr. Xia, Lingzhi Hall has a close relationship with the Hong sect and they have a good reputation. There should be no problem with the herbs.” Ah Hua said,”whatever medicinal herbs you need, just leave it to us. Even if the Lingzhi Hall really has low – Quality medicinal herbs, they would never dare to sell them to us.”

“That’s true ...” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ll make a list. If possible, please prepare the medicinal herbs for me as soon as possible.”

“Yes!” Ah Hua said respectfully,”the medicinal herbs you need will be delivered tomorrow morning!”

It was already Teno’ clock in the evening. If the herbs could be delivered tomorrow morning, they must have prepared for it overnight. The clinic was almost closed at this time. However, for the Hong sect, it was easy to prepare a few sets of herbs at any time.

Xia ruofei nodded and grabbed a piece of paper from the table. He picked up his pen and listed more than ten kinds of medicinal herbs, even noting down the amount of each herb.

Then, Xia ruofei passed the note to Hua and said,””That’s it. We can relax on the time, but we must ensure the quality of the medicinal herbs!”

“Don’t worry!” Ah Hua stood up and said,”if there’s any problem with the medicinal herbs, I’ll be the one to answer for it!”

“Then I’ll have to trouble you!” Xia ruofei said amiably,”that’s all. You guys should go back and rest early!”

“Yes!” Ah Hua said,”Mr. Xia, we’ll take our leave then!”

The taciturn ah Yong also said to Xia ruofei,””Mr. Xia, good night!”

After they left Xia ruofei’s room, they immediately called lui hai and asked the Grasso family to fax the list of herbs that Xia ruofei had written down.

Lyu hai attached great importance to Xia ruofei’s request. He immediately asked Lyu zhengfeng to call the manager of Lingzhi Hall.

When the manager of Lingzhi Hall heard that it was lui hai, the boss of the Italy Freemasonry, who wanted to buy some medicinal materials, he dared not to delay. He hurriedly got out of bed and rushed to the Ling Zhi Tang Chinese medicine Hall in person. On the way, he also called medicine master and woke him up.

Half an hour later, the herbs that Xia ruofei needed had been packed and labeled. They were then sent to the Hong sect’s branch in Turin.

Considering that the Hong sect needed a lot of these herbs, which were obviously not to be boiled and taken at once, the manager of Lingzhi Hall considerately prepared an exquisite scale to measure the weight of the herbs. At the same time, he also gave a clay stove and three claypots to the Hong sect’s branch in Turin.

Lyu hai immediately arranged for someone to pack these herbs and tools into a box and told Lyu zhengfeng to send them to the Grasso family’s Manor in the suburbs.

If Xia ruofei didn’t emphasize twice that lui hai was not allowed to meet him at the Grasso family, lui hai would have sent him there personally.

Although it was already midnight, the Grao family did not dare to neglect the Hong sect’s brothers ‘visit. Their Butler, Rotie, personally welcomed them.

Lu zhengfeng didn’t stay for long. He directly handed the things to his Butler, Rotie, and told him to pass them to Ah Hua as soon as possible. Then, he took a deep look at the interior of the Grasso family’s Manor, got into the car, and left.

When ah Yong and Ah Hua received the box, Monica had already sneaked into Xia ruofei’s room.

Both of them were at their most energetic age and the afternoon’s lingering was not really satisfying. Monica locked the door and immediately threw herself into Xia ruofei’s arms. The two of them hugged and kissed passionately.

The endless Spring in this luxurious room only reluctantly came to an end at one or two in the morning.

Xia ruofei was still full of energy and didn’t look tired at all. Monica, on the other hand, was so tired that she felt like she was floating in the clouds. She had yet to recover from the strong impact on her senses.

“Xia, thank you!” Monica muttered,”I have never seen Rousey so happy. It was you who gave him a new light of hope in his life ...”

Xia ruofei gently kissed Monica’s forehead and said,””Monica, he’s your brother. It’s my duty to do anything for him. Besides, it’s only within my power. Also, you and I should never say thank you to each other. That’s too distant ...”

“I know ...” Monica was already surrounded by a thick sense of happiness.”But I just want to thank you. Other than thanking you, I really don’t know how to express my current feelings ...”

“There are many ways to thank someone, such as ...” Xia ruofei chuckled.

With that, Xia ruofei’s demonic claws began to move restlessly again. Monica was shocked and quickly said,””God ... Are you not tired at all? How could there be such a strong man ...”

Xia ruofei answered with his actions.

Suddenly, the heart – shaking voice in the bedroom started to echo again ...

The next morning, Xia ruofei and Monica were in bed for a long time before they reluctantly got out of bed and got dressed.

It was already past eighto’ clock when the two of them finished washing up and walked out of the room.

If Ling Qingxue and Xia ruofei lived in such a big family and slept in the same room last night, even if they were tired from rolling around in the sheets the whole night, they would definitely wake up early and sneak back to their own room.

However, European girls were different from traditional Chinese girls. Monica didn’t care about these things. She was always open when she was with Xia ruofei. After a night of hard work by Xia ruofei, Monica, who had been nourished, was glowing. She held Xia ruofei’s arm and walked out of the room openly.

When they arrived at the dining room, Luo Si was already seated at the table. Ah Yong and Ah Hua were also there. They did not eat first and chose to wait for Xia ruofei.

When Xia ruofei and Monica walked into the restaurant, Rousey immediately greeted them with a smile. Ah Yong and Ah Hua hurriedly stood up and greeted Xia ruofei and Monica.

Xia ruofei nodded slightly and walked straight to the table to sit down.

“Mr. Xia, we’ve prepared everything you need,” Hua stood up and said.

“So fast? You’ve worked hard!” Xia ruofei said happily,”please bring the things to my room after we finish eating!”

“Alright!” Ah Hua replied.

“Xia, what did you ask Mr. Hua to prepare?” Monica asked curiously.

“It’s the herbs I need for the next step of my treatment.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’m not familiar with the place in Turin. Considering that ah Yong and Ah Hua are Chinese, they might know where to buy the most authentic Chinese medicine, so I tried to ask them for help. I didn’t expect them to be so efficient. It’s beyond my expectations!”
