Chapter 689: The ocean in the space (1)

Xia ruofei’s expression did not change. He unbuckled his seat belt and stood up steadily. He laughed and said,””Vice – Captain Zhang, your flying skills are excellent! The most important thing is that it can fly fast!”

“Yes!” Zhang shiguang laughed and said. The key was to fly fast! I just can’t stand those Civil Aviation pilots, they’re so sissy when they fly the plane! If a war were to break out, it would be too late to rely on those people to transport strategic materials!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”deputy commander Zhang, you’re too extreme!” It was just a different division of labor! The passengers would not be happy if they were to fly a plane like you!”

Zhang shiguang chuckled and said,”doctor Xia, please!” The car to pick you up is already waiting on the tarmac!”

“There’s a car to pick me up?” Xia ruofei said in surprise.

“It was arranged by Colonel Louis.” Zhang shiguang said with a smile.

“He’s really thoughtful. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”let’s go!”

Xia ruofei picked up his backpack and stepped out of the cabin.

When he came down from the simple ramp, he saw a camouflage cheetah off – Road vehicle parked next to the plane. A major of the Air Force was standing next to the car and waiting.

“Hello, doctor Xia! I’ve been ordered to send you off in a car!” The Air Force Major saluted Xia ruofei and said.

“Thank you for your hard work!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Xia ruofei thanked Zhang shiguang and the rest of the crew. Then, he got into the cheetah SUV and left the military airport.

Along the way, the Air Force Major was also silent. After asking for the location of Tao Yuan farm, he said a few words to the driver, then sat upright in the front passenger seat, looking straight ahead.

......

Xia ruofei wouldn’t try to get close to people for no reason. He knew that Jin Feng had coordinated with the local Garrison to send him a car. Xia ruofei naturally wouldn’t reject such a kind offer.

Moreover, he could not wait to return to the farm and absorb the world stone in his backpack!

Xia ruofei was also worried that the spirit map scroll would produce some kind of strange phenomenon when it absorbed the world stone, so he had been holding back from absorbing it directly. He wanted to return to the farm first.

The leopard car drove out of the military airport and went straight to the expressway around the city. Then, the speed of the car gradually increased. After about half an hour, Xia ruofei could see the gate of the farm from afar.

Xia ruofei did not let the car drive straight to the farm. After all, it was a military vehicle. Xia ruofei did not want to be too ostentatious. He asked the driver to stop when they were about a hundred or two hundred meters away from the farm.

Xia ruofei expressed his gratitude to the Air Force Major and the driver of the military vehicle. Then, he took his bag and walked back to the farm.

“Brother Xia!” An old soldier on duty at the entrance was very surprised to see Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Da gang, are you on duty today?” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“That’s right!”Da gang grinned. Brother Xia! You’ve been out for quite a long time this time!”

“Is everything fine on the farm?” Xia ruofei threw a cigarette to da gang and asked casually.

“I’m fine! Everything is normal!” Da gang said with a smile after receiving the cigarette.

“Alright! You stand guard first!” Xia ruofei said,”I’m going home!”

“Brother Xia, I’ll drive you in with my scooter?” Da gang quickly said.

“No need, no need. I’ll take a look around ...” Xia ruofei waved his hand and refused.

Xia ruofei walked into the farm. When he passed by the greenhouse, he did not go in to take a look. Instead, he went straight back to his small villa.

After playing with lightning for a while, Xia ruofei grabbed his bag and quickly returned to his room upstairs.

After locking the doors and windows and drawing the curtains, Xia ruofei casually summoned the spirit map scroll from his palm. With a thought, he entered the spirit map world.

Xia Qing was standing straight beside the spatial pond, her eyes closed.

However, when Xia ruofei appeared in the space, Xia Qing immediately opened her eyes and came to life.

In fact, Xia Qing was in a state of deep sleep just now when she was not working. Xia Qing was in a deep sleep most of the time, so that she could save energy.

“Master!” Xia Qing called out respectfully.

“I obtained a world stone today!” Xia ruofei said.

“That’s great!” Xia Qing said happily,”master, I can sense that the spirit map world is very close to its next breakthrough. With this world stone, it will definitely be able to break through!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I’ll send the world stone in a while and let the spirit map world absorb it.” Xia Qing, are you sure that you won’t be affected during the process of absorbing and breaking through in the spirit map world? Do you need me to make any preparations for you?”

Xia Qing had helped Xia ruofei a lot, so Xia ruofei was very cautious, afraid that Xia Qing would be hurt.

“It won’t have any impact!” Xia Qing said with a smile. Master, those dogs in the mountain sea realm should have been in there for quite a long time, right? When the spirit map world broke through before, didn’t nothing happen to them?”

Xia ruofei thought about it and felt that Xia Qing’s words made sense.

Xia ruofei’s understanding of the spirit map world was not as deep as Xia Qing ‘s, so since Xia Qing was so sure, he was relieved.

“Alright, I’ll go out and get the world stones!” Xia ruofei said.

“Master, hurry up! I can’t wait!” Xia Qing said excitedly.
