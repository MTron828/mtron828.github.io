2884 Night and Star Journey (2)

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”that’s not necessarily the case ... The guards are used to deal with ordinary people’s invasion. The defense of Paradise Island mainly depends on the Taixu xuanqing formation!” Besides, this isn’t your fault. It’s not realistic to transport such a large batch of firearms by air ...”

“There’s actually a way, but the risk isn’t small. ” Li Yifu said,”grand uncle – Master, should I contact the Hong sect and try to send this batch of goods to the nearby airport by air?”

Li Yifu could tell that even though Xia ruofei said that the safety of Peach Blossom Island mainly depended on the Taixu xuanqing formation, he still hoped that the firearms could be transported here as soon as possible.

In fact, Xia ruofei did not want to wait for more than a month. He was not worried about the safety of Peach Garden Island. The main thing was that the Veterans had already gathered and were even undergoing some intensive training. He was going to let them station on the island in the next few days. If everyone was in place and the equipment had to wait for more than a month, he would feel a little embarrassed in front of his old comrades. After all, he had already made it clear.

However, Xia ruofei knew the risk of transporting the firearms by air. He did not want his brothers from the Hong sect to take the risk. After all, they were helping.

Hence, Xia ruofei shook his head and said,”we don’t have to take the air transport.” However ... Tell them not to load the ship for the time being. I’ll deal with it. Also, tell the cargo ship not to wait and tell them to set off first. Don’t waste too much of their time because of us. ”

He already had a preliminary plan in mind, but it was not convenient to tell Li Yifu for the time being.

Li Yifu had never hesitated when it came to Xia ruofei’s decisions. He immediately nodded and said,””Fine, grand uncle – Master, I will contact the people Mexico a short while!”

Xia ruofei nodded and asked,”adopted husband, how’s your cultivation recently?”

“Thank you for your concern, Grand – martial uncle,” Li Yifu said.”I’ve been living on the Peach Blossom Island for a while, and the spiritual energy environment here is really good. Cultivating here for a day feels better than cultivating outside for a month!” All of this is thanks to martial granduncle, and this disciple will never forget martial granduncle’s great kindness!”

“The only help I can give you is the external environment,” Xia ruofei said with a pleasant expression. “In the end, you still have to rely on your own efforts to cultivate.” Foster husband, you’re a bit old, and you’ve been delayed by the cultivation environment in the early stages, so you have to double your efforts and not relax for even a moment. Otherwise, it’ll be difficult for you to have any great achievements on the path of cultivation. ”

“Yes! This disciple will definitely remember martial granduncle’s teachings in my heart. ” Li Yifu said,”actually, grand uncle – Master gave me a complete cultivation technique and allowed me to cultivate in such a unique environment. How could I not cherish it? During this period of time, as long as I have free time, this disciple will work hard to cultivate and strive to improve my cultivation. In the future, I will be able to share more of martial granduncle’s worries!”

Xia ruofei nodded with relief and said,””You and I are from the same sect, so I will definitely spare no effort in cultivating you. As for what kind of height you can reach, it will depend on your own fortune!”

“Yes! Thank you, senior granduncle!” Li Yifu said with a grateful expression.

Then, Xia ruofei and Li Yifu talked about the daily management of peach source Island, including the barracks of the guards after they landed on the island, the scope of their inspection, the recruitment of ordinary staff, management, and so on.

Xia ruofei had decided to let Li Yifu recruit some reliable staff who were willing to work on Peach Blossom Island through his channels. It would be even better if they or their families had the Hong sect’s background.

Of course, these people would be “interviewed” by Xia ruofei alone before they were hired. Under his spiritual hypnosis, those with ulterior motives would never be able to get in.

Li Yifu also shared some of his thoughts and reported to Xia ruofei some of the work he was working on.

Just as the two of them were about to finish their conversation, there was a knock on the door. Xia ruofei scanned with his spiritual power and found that Zheng Yongshou was standing at the door with a respectful face. He said indifferently,””Yongshou, come in!”

“Yes!” Zheng Yongshou then pushed the door open and walked in.

When he saw that there were only Xia ruofei and Li Yifu in the room, he immediately greeted the two of them respectfully.””Master! Senior li!”

“What’s the matter?”Xia ruofei nodded.

“Reporting to master! He’s already near the Peach Blossom Island. ” Zheng Yongshou said respectfully,”master would like to ask for your permission. Can we go to the island to meet him now?”

Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and said in surprise,””He’s already here?”

“After this subordinate contacted master last night, he immediately rushed over on his flying sword through the starry night,” said Zheng Yongshou. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Qingfeng Luo had been to the peach source Island once. For a cultivator in the beginning stage of the Golden elixir realm, it was easy to find this place again. Therefore, he did not need anyone to lead the way this time, nor did he need to take a plane. Especially when Xia ruofei personally summoned him, he put down everything at hand and immediately came on his flying sword.

Xia ruofei silently calculated the time and smiled.””It seems like the speed of sword Kinesis flight is much faster than that of an Airplane!”

Then, Xia ruofei immediately said,”since we’re here, what are we waiting for?” Let him get on the island quickly! I just happened to have something to talk to him about! Foster husband, go with Yongshou and see which direction Qingfeng is coming from. Open a hole in the defensive formation and let him in. Also, guide him. ”

“Yes! Senior granduncle!” “Yes, master!” Li Yifu quickly replied. Then, he and Zheng Yongshou bowed to Xia ruofei and left his room.

Half an hour later, a tired – looking Luo Qingfeng appeared in Xia ruofei’s room. After Zheng Yongshou led Luo Qingfeng here, he respectfully left. As soon as Luo Qingfeng saw Xia ruofei, he immediately bowed deeply and said,””Master! Qingfeng is here to report to you!”

“Qingfeng, you must have had a hard journey, right?” Xia ruofei said with a pleasant expression.

“It’s not hard,” Luo Qingfeng quickly said.”It’s just some vital Qi. It’s not hard!” I’ll be fine after recovering for a while! If master has any orders, please let me know!”

In fact, Luo Qingfeng had not only consumed ‘some vital Qi’, but almost all the vital Qi in his body. He had been flying at high speed all the way and did not care about the consumption of vital Qi at all. Halfway through, he could not hold on any longer and landed on an uninhabited island to recover.

Xia ruofei was already in the beginning stage of the Golden elixir realm. He could tell that Luo Qingfeng was almost at the end of his rope. He smiled, took out a piece of crystal, and handed it to Luo Qingfeng, saying,””I’ll use this to meditate and recover my Yuan Qi first!”

Luo Qingfeng looked at it and could not help but widen his eyes. He asked with a trembling voice,””Master, these are ... Origin crystals?”

Now that the cultivation environment on earth was so harsh, spirit crystals were already very precious, let alone origin crystals, which were even more precious. When the cultivation environment was good, origin crystals were the standard of golden core cultivators. It was the most convenient way to recover Origin Energy. However, Luo Qingfeng had never even seen an origin crystal before. When he saw the origin crystal in Xia ruofei’s hand that was emitting dense spiritual energy, he did not even dare to confirm.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Hurry up and recover. If you stay in this state for too long, you will hurt your Foundation!”

“Master!” Luo Qingfeng said fearfully,”master, I’ll just adjust my breathing for a while!” The spiritual Qi on the Paradise Island is rich ...”

He suddenly stopped and looked embarrassed. Xia ruofei had almost absorbed all the spiritual Qi on the island yesterday. Although there was some increase after a night’s recovery, to an Aurous core stage cultivator, the concentration of spiritual Qi was not much different from the outside world. No matter what, it was definitely not rich in spiritual energy.

Xia ruofei smiled and stuffed the crystals into Luo Qingfeng’s hands. He said,””You dare to disobey my master? Just take it if I tell you to! Don’t talk so much nonsense, quickly sit down and regulate your breathing! In addition, this isn’t a gift for you. You can return it to me after you’ve recovered a portion of your vitality!”
