After using all his strength, Xia ruofei finally fell at a position of 68 meters. When a wobbly Halo approached Xia ruofei, its speed suddenly increased by more than ten times. It did not attack Xia ruofei directly but turned around. When Xia ruofei was dodging another Halo, it twisted its body and bumped into the Halo.

Game over!

Xia ruofei was sent to the departure line.

Although he had failed to break through the array and his score was not much better than the last time, Xia ruofei was still full of joy. In the last eight meters, Xia ruofei had gained a new understanding of the floating steps under the pressure.

He got up from the ground and rushed out of the Linglong tower without hesitation. He quickly practiced in the open space in front of the tower.

This practice lasted for more than ten hours. In these ten hours, Xia ruofei almost did not stop. He practiced the floating steps over and over again, but he still could not reach his ideal state. It was only when he practiced to a certain position on the last practice that Xia ruofei suddenly had a trace of enlightenment.

His eyes brightened, and his body seemed to speed up a bit. When he practiced the drifting steps again, his whole person seemed to have a more refined temperament. His footwork was clearly the same as before, but it gave people a feeling of drifting.

Xia ruofei did not even wait for his spiritual energy and genuine Qi to recover. He drank a pot of spiritual pond water in big gulps. At the same time, he held a crystal in his hand and rushed into the Linglong tower while absorbing the spiritual Qi in the crystal.

In the spirit map world, which was filled with dense spiritual Qi, using Origin crystals to replenish true Qi was a very extravagant act. However, Xia ruofei did not want to waste this flash of inspiration. He had to enter the Jade pillar array immediately to maximize the effect of this enlightenment.

After entering the Linglong tower, Xia ruofei did not stop at all. He rushed straight into the Jade pillar array.

Ten meters, twenty meters, thirty meters, forty meters, fifty meters ...

The Halos did not seem to exist. They did not stop Xia ruofei’s high – speed advance at all. In the blink of an eye, he had rushed to the position of nearly 60 meters with irresistible force.

Xia ruofei had completely forgotten himself. The lights in his eyes seemed to have slowed down.

This was, of course, an illusion. In reality, his movement technique’s speed had increased by a large margin.

Clusters of light gathered from all directions like moths attracted by the bright lights in the dark night. Xia ruofei’s figure shuttled through the tiny gaps between the light.

Right now, he had completely forgotten that he was challenging the array. Instead, he was immersed in that magical feeling of comprehension. The distance of every step, the height of every jump, the angle of his turn, and even the changes in his muscles ...

This comprehension was so clear that it made him feel extremely satisfied.

It was not until he was hit by the Halo and flew out of the formation’s range that Xia ruofei shouted in a carefree manner,””Cool!”

Although he had been in A State of Trance, every detail of the challenge seemed to have been imprinted in his mind. Xia ruofei tried to recall and calculated the distance he had covered.

This time, even he was shocked. He couldn’t believe it, so he did the calculations again, and the result was still the same.

“What the ... Isn’t this a little too much?” Xia ruofei exclaimed.
