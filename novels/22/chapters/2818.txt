2819 The media’s reaction (2)

Xia ruofei did not find it strange at all. When he said those words at the press conference, he was already prepared to be taken out of context by the media.

That night, he asked Zhou leiyun to arrange for the club’s staff to post the complete video of the interview on the Espanyol’s official website, especially the part where Xia ruofei answered Pablo. It was edited separately and placed in an eye – catching position.

The RCD Espanyol fans were not three – year – old children. They naturally had the ability to distinguish right from wrong, especially after watching the interview video. Naturally, they would not misunderstand Xia ruofei.

Sports daily also questioned Ruby’s words.

It was the part where Ruby complained about nokapu’s chaotic management. The players had not even left the field, but the turf had already been sprayed and the lights had been turned off.

Pablo wrote in the report,”The reporters were at the scene at the time and did not discover the situation that Mr. Ruby had mentioned. Bar?a’s strength was outstanding in La Liga, and they would encounter similar doubts every season because people were used to sympathizing with the weak ...

When Xia ruofei saw the report, he felt angry and amused at the same time.

Shouldn’t a news reporter pursue authenticity the most? How could this reporter speak without thinking and distort the truth?

In fact, Xia ruofei had underestimated the bias of these regional media. The readers of The Sports Daily were mainly in the gatai region, and they were mainly bar?a fans. Their newspaper philosophy naturally had to be liked by the bar?a fans. Otherwise, wouldn’t it affect the sales?

As for news ethics, it was nothing compared to the euro.

Back to Ruby’s complaint, The Sports Daily reported it like that, so what could you do? Jumping out to argue with him was equivalent to helping them stir up the topic, and they were more than happy to do so!

Xia ruofei furrowed his brows, thinking about whether he should respond to this.

At that moment, the doorbell rang. Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to check and found Song Wei and Ling Qingxue standing at the door.

Hence, Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to turn the doorknob and open the door. His spiritual power had improved a lot, and he could control small items as easily as his arms and fingers.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue saw that the door had opened on its own. They could see Xia ruofei sitting in front of the desk in the corner of the living room, staring at the computer screen.

The two of them did not make a fuss. Xia ruofei had shown them many times how to use his spiritual power, so they were well aware of his ability to control objects through space.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue walked into the room. Ling Qingxue grinned and said,””We were a little bored, so we came to chat with you! RUO Fei, why don’t we go out in the afternoon?”

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said,””Qingxue, Weiwei, I won’t be going out in the afternoon. If you guys want to go shopping, I’ll ask director Zhou to arrange a car and a few people to follow you.”

Song Wei looked at Xia ruofei and said,””Ruofei, you don’t seem to be in a good mood.”

“No way! Weren’t they all fine during lunch?” Ling Qingxue asked,”RUO Fei, what’s wrong?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s no big deal!” It was just that he saw an article and felt a little unhappy! But I can’t do anything to them at the moment, so I’m even more upset!”

“What report?” Ling Qingxue came over to take a look.

The Spanish language that filled the screen made her dizzy. Fortunately, the accompanying pictures were not bad. Most of them were related to Xia ruofei. There were pictures of him dribbling the ball, passing the ball, and shooting the goal. Especially the fatal Barb, which was the biggest and also included in the article.

“What exactly is written in this?” Ling Qingxue said with a frown.

Song Wei also looked at him, asking for his opinion. Xia ruofei smiled and explained the whole situation to them, then said, “That’s the general situation. What did this mean? Sometimes, when a person with a pen becomes shameless, he’s even more ruthless than those people with machetes!”

Ling Qingxue said angrily,”this is simply distorting the truth!” Pointing at a deer as a horse! So many of our Spanish fans are at the scene and everyone can testify!”

Song Wei was calmer. She didn’t say anything in the beginning and only thought to herself. After Ling Qingxue finished explaining angrily, Song Wei said,””Ruofei, although it’s a little discouraging to say this, I still have to say it. According to the traditional way of dealing with this, we can’t do anything about this kind of report ...”

“I know ... It’s just a little infuriating ...” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.

Xia ruofei then clicked on the link to the author’s name on the website. It was directly linked to the reporter Pablo’s Facebook page. As expected, Pablo had also refuted Ruby’s accusation in a sarcastic manner on his Facebook. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

He wrote on Facebook,”actually, I can understand Ruby’s ecstasy as the manager of a small club when the team was lucky enough to beat bar?a.” Although it’s a little impolite to say this, I still feel that the most appropriate metaphor is ‘nouveau riche’. Yes, it’s completely the face of someone who became rich overnight. This is not the first time Ruby has complained about Barcelona’s home ground, but he has never provided any evidence!

“Even if Ruby said that there was something going on, I have enough reason to believe that it must be that Espanyol’s celebration was too long and had affected the maintenance work of nokapu Stadium. Maybe the staff had to turn on the water spray switch after many reminders were ineffective!

In addition, as everyone knew, Xia ruofei, who scored the kill goal in this game, was also a shareholder of Espanyol. At the press conference, Xia ruofei also said that he wanted to buy Messi from Barcelona! Oh my God! How arrogant must he be to say such stupid words? There was nothing wrong with calling them upstarts! The Chinese have become a little rich in the past few years, but their Foundation ...”

Xia ruofei translated Pablo’s words to Ling Qingxue and Song Wei. Ling Qingxue was so angry that she felt like her lungs were about to explode. She said,”How can there be such a shameless person? It’s as disgusting as eating a dead rat!”

Song Wei, on the other hand, was still calm. She seemed to be deep in thought as she asked,”RUO Fei, his post should be quite popular, right?”

Xia ruofei took a look and nodded.””Yup! His fan page has quite a lot of followers. Look, there are hundreds of comments!”

If this number was placed on China’s Weibo platform, it would actually not be much. After all, there were so many netizens in China, and there were many so – called fake accounts among them. However, it was already a very popular blog post on Facebook.

Xia ruofei continued,”but it’s obvious that these were left by the bar?a fans. Look at the content of their messages ...”

“Don’t translate it for us,” Ling Qingxue said hurriedly.”It’s definitely not good!”

Xia ruofei and Song Wei could not help but laugh.

Xia ruofei said,”yes!” It’s not anything good, so you don’t have to listen!”

Song Wei said thoughtfully,”based on my experience, if we overreact, we’ll fall into their trap.” If you don’t respond at all ... Staying silent doesn’t seem like your style!”

“Weiwei, do you have any good suggestions?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“I’ll show you something first, then you can figure out how to deal with it!”Song Wei smiled.

Song Wei took out her phone and found a video in her gallery. She played it and passed it to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei took the picture confusedly and realized that it was a picture of the Spanish players celebrating on the field after yesterday’s game.

In the video, the RCD Espanyol players were cheering and celebrating on the turf of nokapu and constantly waving to the away team’s stands. The RCD Espanyol fans also responded enthusiastically in the stands and kept shouting. The loudest one was Xia ruofei’s name.

At this moment, the main light in the stadium went out at once. Immediately after, the hidden faucet under the grass began to rise and quickly sprayed water out ...
