Chapter 1151: A confession that caught me off guard (1)

Translator: 549690339

After a while, Lu You also arrived at the courtyard house.

She had obviously dressed up well today. She was wearing a black and white striped shirt with tight – fitting ripped jeans, which made her look very capable and experienced. Her shoes were also the same color as her pants, and she wore pointed Martin Boots, which made her look even taller than she was.

Moreover, Lu You’s face was covered in delicate light makeup. Her fair skin was rosy, making her look even more tender and moving.

“This courtyard is not bad! How much did you buy it for?” Lu You asked as soon as she saw Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”a hundred million!” I bought it when the opportunity was right!”

Lu You’s eyelids could not help but Twitch. He had spent more than 100 million so casually. This guy’s business had been very big in the past one or two years!

She still remembered the first time she met Xia ruofei. It was when Xia ruofei saved her grandfather, professor Tian, on the street. Then, professor Tian and Tian Huilan held a banquet to thank Xia ruofei.

That meeting wasn’t very pleasant. Lu You still remembered that Xia ruofei’s business had just started and he seemed to only sell a small amount of Taoyuan vegetables.

How long had it been? Xia ruofei’s company was already so popular ... Lu You couldn’t help but feel a little dazed.

“Miss Lu, you’re here!”

Feng Rao walked over to greet Lu You with a smile. The spokesperson of heart nourishing soup, Daphne, was with Feng Rao.

“Hello, Sister Feng!” Lu You smiled and greeted him.

“Deer, is your head really fine?” Duff asked, concerned.

During the accident at the set, Duff had witnessed the terrifying scene of the crane falling down with her own eyes. She had been scared out of her wits.

When she heard from Feng Rao that Lu You was not injured, Duff could not believe it.

Seeing Lu You alive and well today, and without a single wound on her forehead, da Fu finally believed Feng Rao’s words.

“I’m fine!” Lu You looked deeply at Xia ruofei and smiled.”I’m quite lucky!”

There was a deep curiosity in Duff’s eyes.”Do you know Chinese Kungfu? I’ve heard that Chinese monks know a very powerful Kung Fu called the iron head technique ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you’re right, miss Duff!” Lu You is a martial arts expert from China. Not only does she know the iron head technique, but she also knows the Golden Bell and iron Shirt. She’s invulnerable! People in the pugilistic world call her Abbess Miejue ...”

Lu You was embarrassed and embarrassed. She pinched Xia ruofei and said,””Damn it! What Abbess Miejue? she’s making it sound so ugly ...” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Xia ruofei raised his head and laughed as he ran away.

Feng Rao didn’t know whether to laugh or cry as she looked at Xia ruofei, who had run to the side. She thought to herself,”this guy is really ... She’s obviously a delicate beauty, but she has to call her Abbess Miejue ...”

She went forward and held Lu You’s arm. She said to Duff,””Don’t listen to our Chairman’s nonsense, Duff. He’s just joking with you!”

Then, Feng Rao said to Lu You,”miss Lu, ignore him!” Let’s go and roast something!”

Lu You pouted and turned to look at Xia ruofei. When she saw the unconcealed smile on Xia ruofei’s face, she couldn’t help but glare at him coquettishly. Then, she followed Feng Rao and Duff to the barbeque.

Wu shuheng was supposed to be the host today, but other than paying the bill to the chef and the hotel, he was very low – Key. He just sat on the side and chatted with Zhao Yongjun.

Because the real protagonist was Xia ruofei, and the guests today were all Xia ruofei’s friends.

As Xia ruofei was taking pictures of his friends in the yard with his phone, song Rui walked over and said,””RUO Fei, why hasn’t Yiyi arrived yet?”

Xia ruofei kept his phone and smiled.””How am I supposed to know about this!”

“She can’t be unable to find the place, can she?” Song Rui said,”this girl has no sense of direction ...”

“Isn’t there a GPS?” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

“Even with navigation, we can still get lost!” Song Rui said,”no, I have to go out and take a look. I’ll go to the entrance of the alley to welcome him ...”

“Calm down ... Calm down ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile.”Isn’t it still early?”

As long as Zhuo Yiyi’s matters were involved, song Rui seemed to become a little uneasy.

“I think I’ll go out and take a look ...” Song Rui said.

At this moment, a girl in a trench coat appeared from behind the screen wall. She looked at her phone with a confused expression, as if she was confirming that she had found the right place.

Song Rui was overjoyed. He waved his hand and shouted,””Yiyi, over here!”

The person who had just arrived was Zhuo Yiyi, who had made song Rui fall head over heels in love with her. She looked up when she heard the voice and finally heaved a sigh of relief when she saw song Rui. She patted her chest and said,””This time, I didn’t find the wrong place ... The two courtyards I found just now were all other people’s houses. One of them even had a big wolfdog. I was scared to death ...”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. So song Rui wasn’t overly concerned. Zhuo Yiyi was really a direction idiot!

Song Rui had already walked up to him. As the host, Xia ruofei naturally had to go up to welcome him.

“Xia ruofei, I heard you bought a courtyard house. You’re really rich!” Zhuo Yiyi said casually,”at least you still have a conscience and can still think of me!”

Xia ruofei glanced at song Rui and said,””Song Rui specially ...”

Song Rui’s face tightened when he heard this and he quickly gave Xia ruofei a look.

Xia ruofei smiled and changed his words,””Song Rui reminded me that you’re working in Beijing too. He asked me not to forget to invite you!”
