Tang Yitian handed the wine glasses to Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao, and said with a smile,””Ruofei, since Lin Qiao likes yachts so much, I’ve ordered a Ferretti Yachts 960, which should be delivered soon. Why don’t I transfer it to Lin Qiao’s name? It just so happens that the three mountains is a coastal city, so it’ll be very convenient for you to go to sea from within the country. ”

Xia ruofei quickly waved his hand and said,””She’s just a young lady, why would she need such an expensive yacht? No need, no need, no need ...”

Lin Qiao also smiled and said,”big brother Tang, don’t scare us anymore, you rich guy!” Even if you give me that luxury yacht, I can’t afford it!”

“I’ll pay for the yacht, of course. “Tang Yitian laughed,”Faraday’s yacht isn’t expensive. It’s about 80 million Chinese dollars!” The custom version is a little more expensive, but it’s only about 100 million. ”

Lin Qiao patted her chest and said,” 100 million is not expensive? My entire net worth is only ten to twenty thousand Yuan ...”

Jennifer and Tang Yitian couldn’t help but burst into laughter when they saw Lin Qiao’s cute appearance.

In their eyes, Lin Qiao had a powerful brother like Xia ruofei. Let alone 100 million, even if she asked for a few hundred million or even a few billion, it would be nothing.

To a God – like figure like him, money was just a number.

In fact, they did not know that Xia ruofei was not as rich as they had thought. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Of course, this was also because Xia ruofei did not want to accumulate wealth through certain means. Otherwise, he could make a fortune just by relying on the spirit map’s ability to identify jadeite and stone gambling. There were also the countless hundred – year – old mountain ginsengs and the large forest of jinsi nanmu in the interspace. If he were to sell them all, he would make an immeasurable amount of wealth.

However, all these could expose the secret of the spirit map space. It was a hidden danger and Xia ruofei would definitely not do that.

Besides, Xia ruofei was enjoying his current life.

Keeping a low profile, being carefree, and earning money step by step seemed to give him a greater sense of achievement.

Xia ruofei caressed Lin Qiao’s hair and said,””Big brother Tang, don’t mention giving us a yacht, a house, or anything else in the future. We definitely can’t accept it,”

Tang Yitian’s eyes revealed a trace of disappointment. Xia ruofei continued,””But if we come to Australia, we won’t be polite with you. We’ll have to trouble you.”

Tang Yitian immediately revealed a happy expression and said,””Of course! If you don’t come to me, then you’re treating me as an outsider! Don’t forget that you’re Haoran’s master ...”

“Yes, yes, yes. We’re all family. I definitely won’t be polite with you.” Xia ruofei said.

Tang Yitian was overjoyed.”Yes, yes, yes! We’re family! We’re family!”

The yacht came to the open sea and anchored. As the waves gently rose and fell, everyone sat on the observation deck, drinking wine and chatting. In the distance, where the sea and the sky connected, a bright moon slowly rose, sprinkling a little brilliance on the sea.

Jennifer could not help but sigh.”Xia, Lin, the culture of your country is indeed broad and profound. Just like the beautiful scenery in front of us, I know how to describe it in English. But you have already had very appropriate poems since hundreds of years ago ...”

At this point, Jennifer turned her eyes to the sea and recited in non – Standard Chinese,””The bright moon above the sea, the ends of the world at the same time ... What beautiful words!”

“Jennifer,” Xia ruofei said with a smile,”I’ve realized that you’re really talented. If you have the time, I really suggest you study the Chinese Language and Literature systematically!”

“My wife was influenced by me. She couldn’t even speak the simplest Chinese before. She only signed up for Chinese cram school after we got married!” Tang Yitian said proudly.

“Do you want to praise the power of love?” Jennifer asked with a smile.

“Of course!” Tang Yitian laughed. Actually, I’m also influenced by you. Although I started an entertainment company before, I didn’t know much about the entertainment industry, but now I know it like it’s a family treasure ...”

Jennifer laughed,”in Chinese, this is called” the closer you are to the Vermillion, the redder you will be. “I’m influenced by you, and I’m the one who gets influenced by you ... Hahaha ...”

Tang Yitian didn’t expect that his wife would actually put what she had learned to good use. He couldn’t help but show a bitter smile.

Lin Qiao couldn’t help but feel envious when she saw Tang Yitian and Jennifer being so loving. She couldn’t help but glance at Xia ruofei.

She didn’t expect Xia ruofei to turn around at this time. Lin Qiao quickly looked away, her heart beating fast like a deer.

Xia ruofei didn’t notice Lin Qiao’s embarrassment. He smiled and said,””Qiao’ er, these two people are showing off their affection! Don’t you think we should leave?”

Lin Qiao was secretly relieved. She smiled and said,”Do you regret not bringing sister – in – Law along? Otherwise, you guys can compete to see who’s the one who’s spreading the dog food!”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly,”I wish!” But she’s been busy with opening branches and running a hotel, so it’s impossible for her to be away for so many days!”

“Yup! Sister Qingxue seems to be getting busier and busier. ” Lin Qiao said.

“Who said it wasn ‘t?” Xia ruofei was a little depressed because Ling Qingxue had been so busy recently that she could not even squeeze out time for a date.”Ever since she became the Vice president of the company, my future father – in – Law has been giving her more responsibilities. I suspect that he’s thinking of an early retirement ...”

Lin Qiao chuckled and said,”isn’t that better?” By then, you can marry a rich woman!”

“I would rather Qingxue not be so busy.” Xia ruofei said,”isn’t it good to be more carefree?”

Lin Qiao couldn’t help but roll her eyes at Xia ruofei.”Do you think everyone has a good life like yours? You’re the boss, but you don’t show up at the company for ten days to half a month, and your subordinates take care of everything for you. What’s even more unreasonable is that your business is getting better and better by the day!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”that’s why!” A truly capable person is definitely not one who works hard ...”

After everyone chatted for a while, Tang Haoran felt a little sleepy, so he decided to go back to his room to rest.

Since Lin Qiao wanted to enjoy the sunrise on the sea, Tyrannosaurus would not return tonight. Everyone would stay on the yacht.

Originally, Tang Yitian wanted to leave the spacious master bedroom for Xia ruofei, but Xia ruofei firmly declined.

Tang Yitian was the master, and they were a family of three, so the master bedroom was the most suitable.

Helplessly, Tang Yitian could only agree. He personally took Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao back to their rooms and then went back to the bedroom.

At night, Xia ruofei sat on the bed in the guest room. He absorbed all the innate pure Yang Qi that he had absorbed from Tang Haoran’s body in the morning and turned it into his own genuine Qi.

Although the amount of innate pure Yang Qi He absorbed this time was much less than the previous two times, it still allowed Xia ruofei’s cultivation to improve by a large margin. He could already faintly feel the bottleneck of Qi disciple Level 4.

From now on, even if there was no more innate pure Yang Qi to absorb, Xia ruofei was confident that he could break through to Qi disciple Level 5 within two to three months. Of course, the premise was that he had to cultivate in the spirit map space without damaging the foundation.

At eleveno’ clock at night, Xia ruofei sat cross – legged on the bed and began his first cultivation in the outside world.

At midnight, Xia ruofei could clearly feel that the spiritual Qi between heaven and earth had become much more active. He immediately used the great Dao technique and began to absorb the free spiritual Qi in the air.

When he started to use the cultivation method, the moonlight on the ocean surface seemed to shiver slightly and then gathered towards the yacht. At the same time, Xia ruofei could clearly feel the spiritual Qi in the surroundings slowly increasing. He was happy and started to focus on the cultivation method again, swallowing the spiritual Qi of heaven and earth and the moonlight that he had attracted.
