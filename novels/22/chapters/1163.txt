“Oh! He was just taking a shower! “I heard my phone ringing as soon as I went out ...” Xia ruofei said,”I was just about to call you after I took a shower!”

“Good girl ...” Ling Qingxue chuckled, then asked,”you’ve been out for so many days, did you miss me?”

“I want! Of course I want to!” Xia ruofei blurted out,”it’s simply too much!”

“You’re so glib!” Ling Qingxue couldn’t handle such sweet talk. She spat and said,”my father wants you to come over for dinner tomorrow!”

“Only father – in – Law is treating me?” Xia ruofei smiled cheekily and asked,”you don’t want me to go over?”

Ling Qingxue didn’t joke around this time. She only said softly,””I also want to ... Are you coming?”

Xia ruofei suddenly felt that the softest part of his heart had been touched. He said without thinking,””Of course I’m going! Even if it’s raining knives outside tomorrow, I’ll definitely rush over!”

“This is more like it!” Ling Qingxue chuckled.

“I have something to give you!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”my dear wife, why don’t you come over to my place tonight and we can go back to your house together tomorrow?”

Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”I’m not going!” You’re thinking of doing bad things again, right?”

Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat. He said,””How could it be bad? We haven’t seen each other for so many days, and you won’t let me miss my wife? Hehe ...”

Ling Qingxue was silent for a moment, then said softly,””Ruofei, I have to work overtime today, so I won’t be going. Let’s meet tomorrow!”

Xia ruofei was slightly disappointed, but he quickly smiled and said,””That’s fine. You can’t drive properly in the middle of the night. I’ll see you tomorrow then!”

“I’m sorry ...”

“Silly girl, why are you apologizing to me?” Xia ruofei said,”remember to rest early and don’t work too late. Your health is more important!”

“I understand ...” Ling Qingxue said,”ruofei, see you tomorrow!”

“Give me a kiss before hanging up!”

“MMH!”

“Good girl. Good night, wife!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

When he heard the busy tone from the phone, he hung up. When Qianqian was talking to Ling Qingxue, he was used to letting Ling Qingxue hang up first because he didn’t want Ling Qingxue to hear the cold busy tone. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

After hanging up the phone, the phone returned to the WeChat interface.

Xia ruofei had nothing to hesitate about this time. He took a deep breath and quickly typed on his phone: “I’m sorry! I have plans for tomorrow. Let’s change the time!”

After typing, Xia ruofei quickly pressed the send button and sighed.

Xia ruofei had just sent the message when he heard a ‘ding dong’. Lu You had replied to his WeChat message. It was obvious that she had been keeping an eye on the messages on her phone.

“Girlfriend? That’s right, I’ve been out for so many days, I understand!”

“I’m sorry ...”

“It doesn’t matter, I believe we will meet soon! ‘Mischievous’.”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. In reality, even if he had not arranged to have a meal with Ling Qingxue, he would have rejected Lu You tactfully. That was because he had not thought of how to face Lu You, especially how to not hurt her.

Xia ruofei did not expect to meet Lu You again so soon. He was more or less surprised.

However, this was all for the future. After Xia ruofei replied to Lu You’s WeChat message, he took out his phone and read the news for a while before going to bed early.

The next morning, Xia ruofei got up on time to cultivate.

After having breakfast in the company’s cafeteria, he went to his office and sat there for a while. Feng Jing, the General Manager, was not in her seat. As the chairman, even if he was just putting on an act, he should still work for a while.

Of course, other than some financial matters that required him to sign, he did not need to personally get involved in some overly specific matters, so he was still relatively idle.

At around 10:30, Xia ruofei left the office and drove the Knight XV SUV to Ling Xiaotian’s jiangbin villa in the city.

As the car was driving on the winding highway, his phone on the center console rang.

The phone was connected to the car’s Bluetooth. Xia ruofei glanced at the message on the LCD screen and realized that it was a call from Song Wei.

Xia ruofei was trying to find an excuse to look for Song Wei!

On one hand, it was because of song Rui. Although that guy was a little unreliable, Xia ruofei still wanted to get it done as soon as possible since he had promised him.

On the other hand, Xia ruofei was still thinking about the realm stone that had caused Song Wei to be in danger. Xia ruofei was almost certain that there was a realm stone in the ancient tomb, so he had always wanted Song Wei to bring him to the scene to take a look.

Xia ruofei pressed the answer button on the steering wheel and asked with a smile,””Song Wei, what’s the matter?”
