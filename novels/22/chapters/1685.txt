Chapter 1686: Chinese Kungfu (2)

Xia ruofei also saw a familiar face.

The air traffic police who was on the plane at that time was standing at the door of the simulation cabin, looking a little reserved.

Professor Aris, an expert from the United States Transportation Safety Committee, whispered to the staff member of qaustro and said,””Let’s start!”

The staff of quodan nodded and made a gesture to the air traffic police.

The air Marshal bent over nervously and picked up an explosion – proof axe, which was exactly the same as the one on the plane, and walked into the simulation cabin.

Xia ruofei was confused and quickly called out,””Wait! That ... Wasn’t I the one to break down the door today? What is this for?”

Director li quickly explained,”director Xia, didn’t this air traffic police cut the cockpit door with an explosion – proof axe before you went over?” This is also to simulate the real situation to the greatest extent ...”

Then, director li lowered his voice and said,”And wouldn’t it be helpful for you if he gave you a few slashes first?”

“Director li, there’s no need for that ...” Xia ruofei laughed.

Xia ruofei strode forward and said in English,””Everyone, I don’t think we should waste any more time. Let me do it!”

The air traffic police also stopped and looked back at the experts.

He really didn’t want to do such a silly thing. An explosion – proof axe couldn’t open the cockpit door at all, even if he used all his strength. His hand had been injured by the shock on the plane, and now he had to do it again, and he couldn’t hold back. He simply didn’t have the energy to complain.

Professor Aris hesitated for a second and asked,””Mr. Xia, Are you sure?”

“I’m very sure!” Xia ruofei said,”didn’t you just want to verify if a qualified cockpit door can be broken down by force? As long as I can open the hatch, there’s no need to add this meaningless segment. ”

Professor Aris thought for a moment and said,””That’s good, thank you for your trouble, Mr. Xia!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. He walked up the stairs and reached the door of the simulator.

The air Policeman gratefully handed the axe to Xia ruofei and then left the simulation cockpit as if he had been pardoned.

Xia ruofei weighed the axe in his hand and walked to the cabin door that had just been installed.

The door was locked. Everyone held their breath and stared at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei took a deep breath and raised the axe in his hand. Then, he shouted and hacked at the cockpit door.

Xia ruofei’s movements were full of strength and beauty. His shout was even more imposing. The members of the investigation team who were watching from the side could not help but nod in approval.

In fact, Xia ruofei was just putting on a show for them. He was able to break the door mainly because he had poured his essential Qi into it, which doubled the power of his slashes. As for the accumulation of power and the release of force, it was not that important.

However, if he deformed the cabin door with a light swing of his axe, wouldn’t that be even more shocking?

Everyone focused their eyes and saw that a clear dent appeared on the cockpit door.

The engineers from the Airbus and the members of the investigation team who had come to supervise the experiment preparations could not help but widen their eyes and mouths. They were shocked beyond words.

How was this possible? It had completely exceeded the limits of human strength, right?

Xia ruofei didn’t give them any time to react. He quickly raised his axe and hacked down again.

Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!

The loud noise echoed in the hangar. The cockpit door quickly became broken. The whole process was filled with violence and aesthetics. The onlookers were silent.

Xia ruofei grinned and threw the axe aside. He took a few steps back and rushed toward the cockpit with a loud shout.

Just like on the plane, Xia ruofei gathered all the Qi in his body and slammed into the cockpit door with a mountain lean.

With a loud bang, the cockpit door opened, and the locking mechanism that was designed to be extremely strong was directly turned into scrap metal.

The hangar was dead silent.

This was especially true for the engineers from the Airbus company. Their mouths were so wide open that a light bulb could fit in.

Professor Aris, who was in charge of this experiment, also opened his eyes wide and muttered,””This is unbelievable ...”

He had expected Xia ruofei to be able to break through the cockpit door. After all, it had happened on the flight. However, he did not expect it to be so easy. It was as easy as crushing dry weeds and smashing rotten wood.

The prior test report also showed that the cockpit door used for the test was better than the standard value in all aspects and was completely qualified.

Xia ruofei glanced at the cockpit door that had suffered an unexpected disaster and walked out of the simulator with a relaxed smile on his face.

He jumped down the stairs and walked in front of professor Aris. He asked,””Professor, is the experiment complete?”

Professor Aris nodded and couldn’t help but ask,””Xia, how did you do it?”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”I don’t know!” Maybe I’m born with more strength than others!”

Another investigator beside him asked curiously,””Mr. Xia, have you practiced this before?”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment before he nodded and said,””It can be considered so! I did receive strength training when I was in the Army. ”

The investigator suddenly came to a realization and said,””It must be Chinese Kungfu! The magical Chinese Kung Fu!”
