Chapter 1732: Winemaking (1)

Even though Zhao Yongjun and the others had been anxiously waiting for Xia ruofei to return, they felt a little embarrassed when they saw Xia ruofei agree so readily.

Song Rui smiled embarrassedly and touched his nose.””Ruofei, this matter isn’t that urgent. After all, you’ve been flying for more than ten hours. It’s no big deal to rest for a day or two.”

“Then ... I’ll rest for a few days. Since there’s no rush, we’ll wait for ten days to half a month ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Don ‘t!” Song Rui quickly said,”you should go tomorrow! Anyway, you’re as strong as a bull. How can you be tired from a few hours of flight?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,””I know you’re not sincere, young master Song! And you’re still being so pretentious ...”

Zhao Yongjun cleared his throat and said,””Ruofei, stop teasing Xiao Rui. Well ... Do we need to prepare anything in advance to deal with this tomorrow?”

“No need. I’ll go by myself tomorrow morning,” Xia ruofei said easily.

“You’re alone?” Zhao Yongjun said in surprise,”you don’t need us to help you?”

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”It’s not that troublesome. I’ll be fine by myself. You guys will suffer if you follow me.”

Song Rui still remembered the experience of setting up the formation that day. Although he was not as afraid as before after Xia ruofei ‘s’ hypnosis therapy ‘, the memory was still there.

After he heard Xia ruofei’s words, he could not help but feel his heart skip a beat. Then, he asked curiously,””You’re going tomorrow morning? Shouldn’t it be in the second half of the night?”

Xia ruofei rolled his eyes and said,”If I don’t sleep for the second half of the night, why would I go and suffer by myself? Besides, didn’t you guys already say it? Now that everyone else is avoiding that piece of land, isn’t it the same if I go there at some other time?”

Actually, what Xia ruofei did not mention was that in order to change the formation into a Yin formation, it was naturally easier to complete it when the yin Qi was at its strongest. If he wanted to change the nine rotations heaven and earth formation into the returning sun formation, he would have to be out of his mind to do it at midnight.

One had to know that the yin Qi was dense at midnight, and the power of the formation was also the strongest. Wouldn’t he be asking for trouble if he went at that time? Even though Xia ruofei could turn the formation around at midnight, why would he make it more difficult?

Xia ruofei didn’t want to explain to song Rui and the others about the formation in detail. They didn’t care too much either. As long as Xia ruofei could settle the formation tomorrow, everyone would be satisfied.

After that, everyone chatted about the anecdotes of the Beijing rich kids ‘circle. Then, Wu Qiang and the other two returned, so they began to make arrangements for the evening’s gathering.

In reality, Xia ruofei and Wu Qiang were the main ones doing the work, including Zhao Yongjun. This group of hedonistic young masters were not good at cooking and were more of a troublemaker. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

In the end, Xia ruofei simply chased them out of the backyard. Feng Rao, who had taken a short break in the afternoon, came to the backyard to help when she heard the noise. Feng Rao might be a standard career woman, but her many years of overseas experience had trained her ability to live independently. After she joined, Xia ruofei and Wu Qiang had a much easier time.

Soon, the three of them prepared a table full of delicious dishes. What Xia ruofei felt a little regretful was that the ingredients were very ordinary. Although they were also high – Quality ingredients bought from the sold well, they were still inferior to the ones produced by Taoyuan.

However, this was the only way. He had a lot of stock in his space, but he couldn’t take them out at this time!

The sky was getting dark. Xia ruofei asked Wu Qiang to call Zhao Yongjun and the others who were playing pool in the entertainment room over. Everyone sat together and started eating.

Even though she said that she would not leave until she was drunk, everyone knew that Xia ruofei had been on the plane for a long time. Furthermore, she had business to attend to tomorrow, so she was more restrained.

Xia ruofei offered the bottle of red wine that the captain of the A.I. Had given him. Then, he asked Wu Qiang to get a few bottles of Semillon from the small wine cellar in the basement. Everyone had a taste of it and did not compete with each other.

There was a large wine cellar in the basement of the courtyard house. However, Xia ruofei had the spirit map space and had no use for it. Hence, when they were renovating it, it was reduced to a smaller size. The extra space was used to add some fitness equipment.

The small wine cellar was naturally to store some wine in the courtyard all year round. This way, even if there were guests, they could use the Kasaya at any time. He couldn’t always hide from people and then take the wine from the space!

After dinner, Zhao Yongjun and the rest chatted with Xia ruofei for a while, then they got up and left.

Wu Qiang served Xia ruofei and Feng Rao tea and then went back to the backyard to clean up the leftovers, leaving Feng Rao and Xia ruofei in the middle courtyard.

When the two of them were alone, Feng Jing couldn’t help but feel a little nervous and awkward. She didn’t know what to say, and the atmosphere was a little awkward.

It was Xia ruofei who asked first,””Sister che, have you booked the plane tickets back to Mt. Three?”

“I’ve asked Liu Qian to book a flight for me. It’s at 9 a.m. Tomorrow,”Feng Jing said with a nod.

Xia ruofei nodded.”Sure. Rest early tonight. I’ll send you off tomorrow!”

“It’s fine. You can get Wu Qiang to drive me to the airport. ” Feng ke said.
