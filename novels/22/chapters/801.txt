Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” Although I was a little unwilling, I still agreed!”

“That’s great!” Qin Xiao Yu called out happily.

Xia ruofei said,”si Mao, don’t make such a sad face!” You’ll be able to see me in the future if you follow Miss Cop. When she’s free, she’ll take you to the farm to reunite with fluffy one, fluffy two, and the rest!”

After hearing this, si Mao shook the fur all over his body and no longer looked listless.

“It’s so smart!” Qin Xiao Yu said in surprise,”Xia ruofei, it’s ... Called si Mao?”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” The names of their siblings are fluffy one to fluffy six ...”

Qin Xiao Yu couldn’t help but roll her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,””You’re such a lazy master! It’s even given such a casual name ... I have to change its name. Hmm ... Its fur is pure white. I can’t get little black, so you’ll be called little white!”

After that, Qin Xiao Yu touched si Mao and called out: “”Little white! Little white ...”

Si Mao didn’t even raise its head, it was lying on the ground and ignored Qin Xiao Yu.

Xia ruofei laughed.”I already said that it’s called si Mao. How could it accept your random name?”

Qin Xiao Yu was depressed,”what a good dog!” You actually gave me such a low name ... Forget it, forget it, forty cents it is!”

Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”officer Qin, is everything alright?” Can I go now?”

Qin Xiao Yu said,”Xia ruofei, thank you!” By the way, how much is 40 cents? I’ll give you money ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”I’ll give it to you. Just don’t look for trouble with me in the future. Also ...”

Xia ruofei looked at si Mao with some reluctance and said,””Be nice to si Mao. Take him to the farm more often when you have the time. He has been with his siblings since he was born. He must be very lonely now that they are separated.”

“I know, I will!” Qin Xiaoyu said,”don’t worry, I will take good care of si Mao!” I’ll bring it to the farm whenever I’m free ...”

“En!” Xia ruofei nodded and waved his hand. Blackie, Da Mao, and ER Mao all looked at si Mao and barked at him as if saying goodbye. Then, they jumped into the back of the pickup truck.

Xia ruofei got into the car, waved at Qin Xiao Yu and drove away from the Public Security Bureau.

Qin Xiao Yu watched the car disappear from her sight, then squatted down and looked at the lonely si Mao and said,””Si Mao, don’t be sad. I will definitely treat you very well in the future! Let’s go to the farm when we have time and play with fluffy one and fluffy two!”

Si Mao barked at Qin Xiao Yu twice, as if it was a kind response to her.

Si Mao had already gained sentience, so it would naturally follow Xia ruofei’s orders unconditionally. It could also feel Qin Xiao Yu’s love for it from the bottom of her heart. There was nothing to be picky about with such a master.

“Si Mao, it turns out that I quite hate your master.” Qin Xiao Yu said with a smile,”but he gave me a good feeling today, he doesn’t seem to be as annoying as before ...”

Si Mao whimpered in dissatisfaction and Qin Xiao Yu said gloomily,””Alright, alright, I won’t speak ill of your master anymore! Your master is a very good person, okay?”

Si Mao then wagged its tail at Qin Xiao Yu.

Qin Xiao Yu chuckled and said,”let’s go!” Si Mao, I’ll find you something good to eat first. I’ll take you home after work!”

After that, Qin Xiao Yu waved at si Mao and the smart si Mao immediately followed.

……

“You’re always too soft – hearted, too soft – hearted ...”

On the way, Xia ruofei hummed the old song and drove the pickup truck towards the direction of the city. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Xia ruofei’s heart softened when he saw Qin Xiaoyu’s dejected look, so he gave si Mao to her. He was still a little reluctant to part with her. After all, he had been raised in the spirit map space for almost a year and had developed feelings for her.

However, since he had already given it away, there was no reason for him to go back on his word. Furthermore, it did not mean that they would not be able to see each other again in the future. They would both be in Sanshan city, so there would be plenty of opportunities for them to meet in the future.

Besides, there were seven dogs on the farm, including lightning and Blackie, so it would not make a difference if they lost one dog.

Hence, Xia ruofei quickly gathered his thoughts and focused on driving.

When they returned to the farm, the sky was already dark. Xia ruofei let Blackie, Da Mao, and ER Mao spend the night in the villa’s yard.

He first asked Hu ‘Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao to come out and let the dogs recognize the people. Then he told them to stay in the yard and not fight with lightning. He also told them not to leave the yard for a walk. He was worried that these fierce dogs would scare the workers when they wandered around the farm.

After settling the dogs, Xia ruofei entered the villa.

Lin Qiao saw that Xia ruofei had brought back so many dogs and naturally couldn’t help but ask all sorts of questions. Xia ruofei answered perfunctorily, saying that he had bought them a few days ago and was raising them at a friend’s house. Now that the farm had expanded, he brought them back to look after the house.

Then, Xia ruofei got rid of the little girl’s pestering and quickly went upstairs to his room, using the excuse of taking a bath as an excuse. He still had a lot of things to deal with in the spirit map space!

After returning to his room, Xia ruofei carefully locked the door to prevent Lin Qiao from barging in without warning.

Then, he locked the aluminum window and drew the curtains. He then summoned the spirit map scroll from his palm and entered the space with a thought.
