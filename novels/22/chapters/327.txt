Chapter 328: Even embarrassment is acting up (1)

Xia ruofei hugged Ling Qingxue’s body, which was getting hotter and hotter. He felt that his self – Control was infinitely close to zero. Ling Qingxue’s mind was also gradually becoming more and more delirious. Her small hands subconsciously rubbed Xia ruofei’s broad back. Xia ruofei had already drunk a lot in the afternoon. Under the influence of alcohol, he picked Ling Qingxue up by the waist and walked quickly to the bed in the bedroom Under Ling Qingxue’s delicate exclamation. Xia ruofei gently placed Ling Qingxue on the bed. Ling Qingxue’s beautiful eyes were tightly shut, but her long eyelashes were trembling slightly, showing how nervous she was. Xia ruofei looked at Ling Qingxue, who was sleeping like a beauty on the bed. Her flawless face and her shy expression, how could he hold back? Xia ruofei kicked off his shoes and pressed down on her. Ling Qingxue opened her eyes. Her face was red, and she bit her lower lip. She looked at Xia ruofei with her watery eyes, full of seduction. “You’re not allowed to bully me in the future ...” Ling Qingxue said softly. Xia ruofei nodded heavily. Ling Qingxue’s words were like a horn to charge. Xia ruofei, who was already restless, no longer hesitated. His slightly trembling hand reached out to Ling Qingxue’s already messy collar ... Just then, Xia ruofei heard a voice from downstairs.””Brother Xia!” Ling Qingxue also heard the shout and trembled. She quickly said,””RUO Fei, I think ye Lingyun is calling you ...” “Ignore him!” Xia ruofei said,”this kid is usually quite sensible. Why is he always causing trouble at critical moments?” With that, Xia ruofei bent down to kiss Ling Qingxue. At that moment, ye Lingyun shouted again from downstairs,””Brother Xia, come down for a moment. Someone’s here looking for you!” Ling Qingxue twisted her body and said,”RUO Fei, go down and take a look!” Maybe it’s an emergency!” Xia ruofei was so angry that he sat up from the bed and said,””F * ck ... I’m going to skin this kid alive!” Seeing Xia ruofei’s flustered and exasperated look, Ling Qingxue could not help but cover her mouth and laugh. She also sat up on the bed with a red face. As she tidied up her messy clothes and hair, she said,””Ruofei, what does this have to do with ye Lingyun? He doesn’t even know that you’re ... Doing bad things ...” Xia ruofei sighed,”why is it so difficult for me to get close to her ...” Ling Qingxue blushed and said in a low voice,””You can leave first! I’ll ... I’ll stay tonight ...” Xia ruofei’s eyes brightened and the dark clouds on his face disappeared. He smacked a kiss on Ling Qingxue’s cheek and said,””Wife, I’ll go down first!” Ling Qingxue’s face was slightly red, and she nodded her head. Xia ruofei chuckled and quickly left the room. He jogged down the stairs. As soon as they walked out of the villa, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but call out,””Ling Yun, are you itching for a beating? Are you calling for your soul?” “Boss Xia, you’re quite impressive!” A clear voice said in a ridiculing tone. Xia ruofei’s expression couldn’t help but freeze. It was only then that he saw two more pretty girls in the courtyard. The one who had just spoken was Tian Huilan’s daughter, Lu You. Beside her was the shy girl, Jiang Yue. She was the girl that Xia ruofei had saved when he was renting a place in the shanty town. “Lu You, Jiang Yue ...” Xia ruofei’s expression was unnatural.”Why are you here?” Lu You raised her eyebrows and said,””We’re not welcome? Then let’s go!” After saying that, Lu You pretended to turn around and leave. However, Jiang Yue, who was beside her, took it seriously. She quickly grabbed Lu You’s arm and said,””Youyou, you ...” Jiang Yue then turned to Xia ruofei and said,””Brother Xia, I’m so sorry. Did we disturb you?” Xia ruofei replied,”no, no. How could I disturb you?” I can’t wait to welcome you! Lu You said that she wanted to visit the farm with you the last time, but you guys didn’t come. I was wondering if you guys had forgotten about it!” The corners of Lu You’s mouth curled up into a beautiful arc as she mumbled,””This is more like it ...” Lu You continued,”Xia ruofei, aren’t you going to invite us in?” Is this how you treat your guests?” “Enter the house? “Uh ...” Xia ruofei’s expression was a little awkward. Ling Qingxue was still in the villa! Although she was on the second floor, if she heard the noise and came down to see him talking and laughing with two young and beautiful girls, it was inevitable that she would misunderstand. Even though Xia ruofei had a clear conscience, there were many things that could not be explained clearly. Women always believed what they saw, and even if they tried to explain, it would be a lot of trouble. Xia ruofei’s mind raced, and he quickly said,””There’s nothing fun to do in the house! Didn’t you come to visit the farm? Why don’t ... I bring you around? The environment of my farm is quite good!” “Alright!” Jiang Yue immediately replied happily,”thank you, big brother Xia!” She looked at Xia ruofei with admiration and shyness. When Lu You saw this, she couldn’t help but sigh and shake her head secretly. This silly girl ... Lu You muttered in her heart. Xia ruofei saw that Lu You didn’t say anything and quickly said,””Let’s go. I’ll take you to the back of the mountain. The scenery there is not bad. You can look out at the sea and enjoy the view of the entire farm. I’ve also planted quite a few lychee trees there not long ago ...” With that, Xia ruofei took the lead and walked out. He couldn’t wait to bring the two of them out of the villa to avoid any trouble. Just then, a voice came from behind Xia ruofei.””Ruofei, you have guests?” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile bitterly. He urged Ling Qingxue to come downstairs ... Ling Qingxue walked out of the house and naturally held Xia ruofei’s arm. She smiled sweetly at Xia ruofei and asked,””Why didn’t you call me when your friend came? Right, you haven’t introduced me yet! Who are these two beautiful ladies?” When Jiang Yue saw how intimate Ling Qingxue and Xia ruofei were, her face turned pale and tears welled up in her eyes. Lu You bit her lower lip lightly and frowned. The atmosphere suddenly became a little awkward. Xia ruofei could only bite the bullet and say,””I ... I’ll introduce them to everyone. Qingxue, this is Lu You. You’ve met her mother before. She’s Secretary Tian. This is Lu You’s good friend, Jiang Yue. She is also ... My friend!” Xia ruofei then said to the two girls,””Lu You, Jiang Yue, this is my girlfriend. Her name is Ling Qingxue.”
