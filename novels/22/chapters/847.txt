Chapter 848: Tri – elements jade talisman (2)

Translator: 549690339

In the stone chamber.

There were four green halos on the stone platform.

Originally, there were five halos here. Each Halo was an extremely tough protective shield. The first Halo on the left contained that booklet. This had already given Xia ruofei a lot of surprises.

The elixirs such as the nourishing spirit soup, the body tempering soup, and the Jade skin cream all came from that mysterious booklet. More importantly, Xia ruofei also obtained the spiritual puppet Xia Qing through the booklet, which gave him the best assistant to manage the spirit map space.

Xia ruofei stood in front of the stone platform and looked at the four remaining halos. His eyes could not help but reveal a look of anticipation.

He regularly took the body tempering soup and the spirit nourishing soup, and his physical quality and mental power were improving day by day. He would come to the stone room every once in a while and try to break the Halo protective shield, but he had not succeeded even once so far.

This time, the spirit map space had absorbed a new world stone. Xia ruofei could clearly feel that his compatibility with the space had increased. In addition, he had been out for a while and had not tried to break the protective Halo for a long time. Hence, he was full of anticipation and was ready to try again.

From left to right, the first three of the four light barriers each contained a Jade tablet, while the last one contained a Jade box.

The first three Jade tokens looked almost the same, but Xia ruofei could not see the details because of the layer of green protection.

He stood in front of the stone platform and took a deep breath. After adjusting his state, he slowly reached out to the leftmost halo shield. He knew that the energy of the shield was getting stronger and stronger from left to right. Now, even the weakest one had not been able to open it, so he didn’t even need to try to open the remaining three.

As soon as Xia ruofei’s hand touched the surface of the protective shield, a soft but extremely tenacious repulsive force appeared out of thin air, as if it wanted to bounce his hand away.

He would come over to test it once in a while, so he was no stranger to this kind of rejection force.

Xia ruofei used his spiritual power and directed the invisible force of the space to gather in his palm. Then, he slowly but firmly pushed forward.

The protective Shield’s Halo started to shake slightly, and the repulsive force grew stronger as Xia ruofei increased his strength.

Xia ruofei’s physical fitness had reached an unimaginable level. However, in the face of this protective shield that could not be broken by brute force, he had no choice but to rely on his strong spiritual power.

The stronger one’s spiritual power was, the higher one’s compatibility with space would be, and the stronger the invisible spatial power one could use.

As the force increased, the force of rejection became more and more terrifying. Xia ruofei felt that his palm was being pushed out by a huge force while the spatial five elements force was pressing in. His palm bone seemed to be about to crack under such a terrifying force.

His body trembled slightly, and he gritted his teeth. His eyes revealed a determined look as he continued to increase his strength.

The shaking of the protective Halo was also becoming more and more intense.

The Halo also began to fade slowly, like a lonely boat in the wind and rain, about to capsize at any time.

Beads of sweat started to form on Xia ruofei’s forehead as he poured out his spiritual energy like it was free.

In the end, Xia ruofei shouted and used all his strength to push the door. The invisible spatial force exploded with a huge force.

A “Weng” sound was heard!

The extremely flexible ball of light finally cracked, turning into spots of light and disappearing into the stone room.

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, then he was overjoyed.

He had finally cracked it!

It had been more than half a year since he took out the booklet to crack the protective shield. During this period, Xia ruofei had tried countless times but to no avail. This time, his efforts paid off and he successfully cracked the second protective Halo!

Xia ruofei impatiently picked up the Jade token that was placed on the stone platform.

This Jade token looked unremarkable and very simple. Even the quality of the Jade could not be compared to the best mutton – Fat white jade that Xia ruofei had used to inscribe array disks. However, Xia ruofei knew that this item’s value could not be measured by its appearance. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

How could something that the previous owner of the spirit map space so carefully protected in the Halo be an ordinary item?

Even the booklet on the far left had given Xia ruofei so many surprises. This Jade token was placed in the second Halo, so it should be more valuable than the booklet.

Xia ruofei carefully examined the Jade token in his hand.

It was warm to the touch, and there were engravings on both sides, with the word “human” engraved on one side.

Xia ruofei looked at it for a long time and tried to use his spiritual power to investigate, but he found nothing.

After a long time, Xia ruofei patted his head and muttered to himself,””I’ve really been muddleheaded recently, and have abandoned what’s near and sought what’s far away!”

After he finished speaking, Xia ruofei immediately used his spiritual will to inform Xia Qing to come over immediately.

Xia ruofei knew that Xia Qing was very familiar with this Jade tablet, the remaining two Jade tablets, and even the items in the last Jade box.

He had once asked Xia Qing about this information, but unfortunately, Xia Qing had told him that before his strength was enough to open the Halo protective shield, he could not tell him.

It was like a program built into a robot, and the priority of this rule was even higher than the command of the master.

Xia Qing was only a spiritual puppet, not a real life. Thus, he would only strictly follow the rules that had been pre – Set in his body. Xia ruofei had no way to deal with him.

Now that Xia ruofei had successfully opened the protective Halo, he could naturally ask Xia Qing about the information of this Jade card.

The moment Xia ruofei sent out his divine sense, Xia Qing’s figure flashed and appeared in the stone chamber.

He saw the Jade token in Xia ruofei’s hand at first glance and cried out in surprise,””Master, you’ve already taken out the tripartite jade talisman?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”so it’s called the Tri – elements jade talisman!” So you can tell me about it now?”

“Master’s strength has already met the requirements, so I will naturally tell you everything I know,”said Xia Qing with a serious nod.

Xia ruofei nodded and waited for him to continue.

“Master,” Xia Qing said,”actually, the Tri – elements jade talisman is a set. There are three pieces in total.”

Xia ruofei’s eyes immediately fell on the remaining three halos. They were the two Jade tokens on the far left. He asked,””The remaining two pieces are in there?”

“Yes!” Xia Qing nodded. Master, the Tri – elements jade talisman is divided into three parts, heaven, earth, and human. The one you took out is the human character. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,””Let’s talk about the Tri – elements jade talisman!”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing said respectfully,”there is a cultivation technique recorded in the Tri – elements jade talisman. It is called the ‘great Dao formula’...”

“Great Dao Arts?” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but interrupt Xia Qing’s words and asked,”it sounds like a cultivation technique? Is there any difference between this and the strange posture of the little golden men I cultivated before?”

Xia ruofei had not stopped practicing the postures demonstrated by the Golden midgets during this period of time. Now, he was able to successfully perform the fourth set of movements.

Xia Qing smiled and said,”master, you used to cultivate a body – tempering technique, while the ‘great Dao Arts’ is a Qi – cultivating technique. One focuses on the internal and the other on the external. Only by cultivating both the internal and the external can they complement each other and bring out the best in each other!” Congratulations, master!”

Before Xia ruofei obtained the spirit map space, he felt that lone Wolf’s assault team members were already close to the strongest individual combat power. However, after obtaining the spirit map space, his strength had broken through the limits that he had previously thought were impossible to reach.

Therefore, he already had enough expectations for the cultivation techniques that only existed in legends. It was not like he had heard a fantasy.

After Xia ruofei heard Xia Qing’s explanation, he quickly threw out his question,””You said that this jade talisman contains this cultivation technique, but I looked at it for a long time just now and couldn’t see anything special about it! I can’t find anything with my spiritual power. Is there something else?”
