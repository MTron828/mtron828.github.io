Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”Oh? Tell me about it ...”

Xu Yougang hesitated and said,””Chairman, after some discussion, I ... I want to stay in China. The three of them are willing to work in Australia.”

Xia ruofei pondered for a while and understood the reason. He remembered that Lei Hu had told him that the reason he had chosen Xu Yougang and the other three to help him deal with Liu haojun was that they were in a difficult financial situation. Lei Hu had said that Xu Yougang’s parents and daughter – in – Law were in poor health and had to take medicine all year round to maintain their health.

Xu Yougang must have chosen to stay in the country because he had to take care of his family.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Of course, I respect your choice. But old Xu, I have a suggestion. What do you think?”

“Please say it, Chairman!” Xu Yougang quickly said.

Xia ruofei said,”the four of you were originally from the same Combat Team. Everyone had their own duties and worked well together. It would be a pity if you were to split up ... Actually, you could also go to Australia to work with Zeng Liang and the others. After all, you’re going to work, not be exiled. You can come back anytime when you have a holiday or something at home. Also ...”

Xia ruofei paused and looked at Xu Yougang before he continued,””Considering your family’s situation, I can talk to the Australian farm and ask your family to go with you.”

Xu Yougang was stunned for a moment. He did not expect Xia ruofei to be so thoughtful.

Xia ruofei said,”of course, the elderly may not be able to adapt to life abroad, but you can bring them to live outside for a while. The medical standards abroad are better than in China. Your family can go there for treatment for a period of time. If the elderly get better and want to live in China again, you can send them back. You can come back when you have a holiday anyway.”

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Xu Yougang was really tempted.

The money he earned from working so hard for Xia ruofei was mainly used for the treatment of his parents and wife. However, the old man was old and had many chronic diseases. He needed time to recuperate, which was not a problem that money could solve.

It might be even better if the two elders could really be brought to Australia for treatment. Moreover, Xu Yougang had also heard that the environment in Australia was very good, which should be more conducive to the recovery of the elderly.

“Old Xu,” Zeng Liang said,”the chairman has already thought so much about you. What are you hesitating for?”

“Yes!” Wang Chong replied. Squad leader Xu, we brothers don’t want to be separated from you either!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Don’t rush old Xu. After all, this matter concerns his family. Let him think about it!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Xu Yougang raised his head and said with a touched expression,””Chairman, thank you! I know you’re thinking about me ... But I have to ask my family for their opinion on this. Can you give me some time?”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”of course, there’s no hurry!” Go back and have a good discussion with the old man and your wife. I’ll still say the same thing, I treat you as my brothers. No matter what decision you make, I’ll respect it!”

“I know! Thank you, Chairman!” Xu Yougang said,”I will give you an answer in three days! Then ... We’ll take our leave!”

“Mm! You can go back and rest for a few more days, especially Zeng Liang and the other two. Since you’ve decided to go overseas to work, you should spend more time with your family. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”of course, when you have a certain amount of financial power, you can also take your family out! The houses in Australia aren’t too expensive, so it’s not impossible to settle down there!”

Zeng Liang and the others also expressed their gratitude. Then, the four of them bowed slightly to Xia ruofei and left the office.

After Xu Yougang and the others left, Xia ruofei gave pang Hao a call to ask about the situation. He learned that pang Hao had already completed the procedures for the dividends and Feng Jing had signed the papers. They were just waiting for the finance department to transfer the money to Feng Jing at the bank during work hours tomorrow.

In the afternoon, Xia ruofei was in his office dealing with some documents that had accumulated over the past few days. Most of them were reports that required his signature. Of course, if it was something urgent and required Xia ruofei’s approval, Feng Jing would usually call him to report it and get his approval before doing it. Signing it now was just another step in the process.

After work, Xia ruofei did not drive. Instead, he followed a few young employees who were still living on the farm and experienced the company’s commuting bus.

Xia ruofei did not put on any airs and could chat with the ordinary employees happily. The atmosphere in the car was very relaxed.

When the bus arrived at the farm, it stopped directly at the complex. Xia ruofei and the employees went to the cafeteria for dinner and then strolled back to his small villa.

After he locked the door and windows, he took out the spirit map and entered the space.

“Master!” Xia Qing immediately came over to greet Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei nodded slightly.”I’ve basically prepared all the materials needed to refine the spiritual puppet. I can bring them to the spirit map world tomorrow.”
