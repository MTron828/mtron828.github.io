This was the most time – saving method. Otherwise, downloading the video, uploading it to the server, and encoding it would take a lot of time. When he needed to fight for time with his peers, Fernandes naturally chose the most convenient way.

Of course, there was a drawback to this. Once Xia ruofei deleted the video on Facebook, the video frame on the Maca newspaper website would not be able to load the video. This was because it was basically a video window on the content page, and the video window came from Facebook.

Fernandes chose the most convenient method. At the same time, he had already downloaded the video from Xia ruofei’s Facebook account. When he was free, he could upload it to the website server for a decoder. Then, he could replace the video frame with the embedded link, and it would be foolproof.

Fernandes quickly checked it one last time. After confirming that there were no problems, he immediately released the press release.

Then, he pushed the article to the first headline on the website’s front page, which was the most eye – catching position besides the website’s headlines. At the same time, the article was also synchronized to the app.

The website and the APP used the same background. Fernandes opened the APP’s background menu and set the manuscript that he had just synchronized to the top.

He finished all the operations in two minutes and heaved a long sigh of relief.

Then, he immediately refreshed his own website and saw that this news had already appeared as the first article in the important news section. He clicked on it to take a look. There was no problem with the text, and the video was playing as usual. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Then, Fernandes opened the Maca APP on his phone and found that the manuscript had been pinned to the top. Everything was normal after he clicked on it.

Fernandes was relieved. He picked up the phone on his desk and dialed the internal number of the chief editor’s office.

“Chief editor, I’ve already published it!” Fernandes said respectfully.

“I already saw it! Good job!” The editor – in – chief said,”Fernandes, don’t be busy preparing the second article. Now push this news to our official Facebook page and Twitter account!”

In the age of the mobile internet, some powerful social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, had amazing communication power, so many traditional media outlets had opened official accounts on these platforms.

With their professionalism and authority in content, these traditional media outlets were more likely to attract the audience’s attention than pure self – Media.

This was the case for the official Facebook and Twitter accounts of the Maca newspaper. The influence of these two accounts even exceeded the official website and app. After all, fewer and fewer people used the web to browse the news nowadays. There was a cost to download an APP and use it often. Facebook and Twitter were different. Most people used it every day. As long as they followed the account of the Maca newspaper, they would naturally receive new push notifications while using it. The effect of this dissemination was actually stronger than that of the official website and app.

Therefore, the editor – in – chief naturally did not miss out on social media platforms. He immediately asked Fernandes to follow up.

“Understood!” Fernandes said.

As an editor on duty, the first thing he had to do was to log into all of his back – end, public e – mails, and social accounts, so Fernandes could operate directly on the computer.

The content was already there, so it didn’t take long to post it. Two minutes later, the official accounts of the two social media platforms, marca news, had already pushed the news.

Then, Fernandes went on to write a second, more comprehensive draft.

Because he needed to prepare a lot of material, it took him almost 40 minutes to sort out the context. Then, he spent another half an hour writing the manuscript.

After he was done, he sent the draft to the editor-in-chief’s email. He then stood up and stretched his sore neck before walking to the editor-in-chief’s office.

Fernandes knocked on the door and walked into the office. He said,””Chief editor, the draft has been sent to your email!”

The chief editor nodded and said,”okay, let me see!” You just wait here for a moment!”

“Understood!”

The editor – in – chief downloaded the manuscript in his email and said while reading it,””By the way, the layout of the newspaper needs to be adjusted. This comprehensive draft needs to be on the front page tomorrow! You can consider which article to remove from the front page and how to adjust the layout according to the length of the article. ”

Fernandes could not help but complain secretly, but he also knew that such explosive news would definitely make the front page of the newspaper, and he was mentally prepared for it. He was on duty tonight! Moreover, to be able to beat his old rival, The Sports Daily, even if it was a little harder tonight, he would feel very good.

Therefore, Fernandes immediately replied,””Alright! I’ll make the adjustments immediately after I send this article!”

Fernandes ‘article was wonderful, and the timeline was very clear. The editor – in – chief was very satisfied after reading it. He basically did not make any changes, only adjusted a few words, and then sent the manuscript to Fernandes.

He raised his head and said,”the manuscript is very well written!” Fernandes, your writing skills have improved again!”

“Thanks for the compliment!” Fernandes said,”then ... I’ll go and publish the manuscript now?”

“Yeah!” The editor – in – chief nodded. I’ve already sent you the revised manuscript, so you can publish it directly! Place this article on the second most important article on the front page and add a link to the previous article. ”

This was how in – depth reports were usually done, and Fernandes was familiar with it. He replied,””Understood!”

Fernandes immediately published the second draft to websites, apps, Facebook, and Twitter at the same time. Without taking a break, he pulled up the design draft of tomorrow’s newspaper and began to think about how to add this article to the front page and which page to change the replaced articles to.

This was how newspapers were. An article about “cutting the line” might cause a chain reaction. The front page would be changed to the second page, and the second page would be changed to the third page ... There might be many articles that needed to be adjusted.

Fortunately, Fernandes was also experienced. He quickly came up with an adjustment plan according to the length of the manuscript. After he reported it to the chief editor and got his approval, he immediately contacted the relevant personnel and sent the manuscript and adjustment plan to them. The professional technical staff would then make adjustments to the newspaper.

It had been more than two hours since he received the e – mail. Fernandes didn’t even have time to take a sip of water, and the coffee he made had gone cold.

Similar scenes were playing out in several other sports media editorial departments in Spain that had received e – mails.

The editors of as and world Sports, like Fernandes, were writing the news as fast as they could. Unsurprisingly, these media outlets also chose to publish the explosive news on the internet as soon as possible.

In fact, Pablo was just a small figure. If it was only because of him, Xia ruofei’s exposure might not have received such attention. However, behind Pablo was one of the four major sports media in Spain, sports daily, and the so – called universal team, Barcelona. It was a completely different story.

From the perspective of media competition, any news that could disgust sports daily would be treated as a treasure by the other media. From a news perspective, all news related to bar?a were hot topics pursued by the media.

This incident happened to occupy both points, so the other media outlets were like cats that smelled fish, celebrating collectively.
