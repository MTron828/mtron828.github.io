Chapter 3375: Star Fern thorn soul essence (1)

Translator: 549690339

The beauty came out of the bath like a lotus out of the water.

Ling Qingxue’s face was still blushing because she had been in the hot bath for a long time. Her hair was still wet, and it hung down beside her face, making her look even more attractive.

She had changed into a light purple Han Chinese clothing, and a belt with complicated and beautiful patterns was tied around her slender waist. A section of her white and tender forearm, which was like a lotus root, was exposed from the wide sleeves. As she walked, her robe fluttered gently, and she was as moving as a fairy.

Xia ruofei could not help but stare at Ling Qingxue in a daze. He mumbled,””Graceful like a startled Swan, graceful like a Wandering Dragon. The autumn chrysanthemums of glory and the spring pine. The misty Xi is like the closed moon in the light clouds, the drifting Xi is like the snow returning to the wind …”

Ling Qingxue’s face turned even redder. She rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,””You’re talking nonsense again! I can’t compare to luoshen…”

“Qingxue, 1 don’t think even luoshen is as good as you!” Xia ruofei said with a serious face.

“You have a glib tongue…” Ling Qingxue said in a low voice, but her heart was filled with joy.

Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”do you feel comfortable now?”

Ling Qingxue held Xia ruofei’s arm and leaned her face on his shoulder.””Thank you, ruofei! You’re so good to me!”

Xia ruofei reached out and touched Ling Qingxue’s face. He smiled and said,””Isn’t this what 1 should do? If I don’t treat you well, who will?”

“Since you’re done here, we should go on with our mission!” Xia ruofei continued.

In fact, when Ling Qingxue was taking a shower, Xia ruofei had already seen the second part of the chain mission through the perceptual mirror.

The mission was simple. Collect ten star Fern thorn soul essences.

This time, it was not bad. Besides the mission content, it also provided information about the star Fern thorn soul essence.

The so – called star Fern thorn’s soul essence was naturally the soul essence extracted from a plant like the star Fern thorn. In reality, as long as the star Fern thorn died, there was a possibility of the star Fern thorn’s soul essence appearing. However, the probability was rather low. As for how low it was, Xia ruofei did not know because the mission prompt on the perception mirror did not explain in detail.

However, judging from the fact that the mission only required him to obtain ten star Fern soul essences, the probability of this happening was probably so low that it would make one’s hair stand on end.

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but say anxiously,””Ah? You’ve already received the second part of the mission? Why didn’t you call me? It’s a waste of time to take a bath!”

Xia ruofei caressed Ling Qingxue’s face lovingly and smiled.””We have the time formation! No matter how long you shower, it’s only a few minutes. It’s not a big deal! It’s not easy for you to take a hot bath, so of course you have to enjoy it. How could I bear to interrupt you?”

In fact, this mission did have a time limit. It had to be completed within ten hours, or else it would be considered a failure.

This segment did not mention the quest record, so naturally, there was no reward for breaking the record.

Xia ruofei did some analysis and knew that this mission was more or less a test of luck. If he was lucky, he might be able to get the soul essence by destroying the first Star Fern thorn. If he was unlucky, he might not be able to get a star Fern thorn soul essence even after destroying hundreds or thousands of star Fern thorns.

Hence, Xia ruofei did not think that it was a big deal for Ling Qingxue to waste a few minutes in the shower.

Ling Qingxue felt a little guilty as she said,”it’s all my fault!” RUO Fei, let’s hurry up and complete the mission! What was the second part of the mission? Forget it, let’s talk while we walk!”

Xia ruofei laughed and waved his hand.”No rush! No rush!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

With that, Xia ruofei put away the array flags, array techniques, and the temporary bathroom. Then, he brought Ling Qingxue to the star Fern thorny ring belt, which had been burnt to ashes, on the bent Frost Flying sword.

Seeing that Xia ruofei had stopped, Ling Qingxue could not help but ask in confusion,””Ruofei, why did you stop again? We should hurry up!”

Xia ruofei said,”the second part of the mission is to collect the star Fern thorn soul essence. The star Fern thorn soul essence is formed after the star Fern thorn dies. I’m thinking that since we’ve burned so many star Fern thorns, will we be able to leave behind a few soul essences?” If we can find the star Fern thorn’s soul essence directly, wouldn’t it be faster than us looking for the star Fern thorn?”

Ling Qingxue was dumbfounded and asked,”that works?” Is it against the rules?”

Xia ruofei said nonchalantly,”there’s nothing against the law. It’s not stated in the rules. We’re not breaking it!” Let’s try it first! If it doesn’t work, we’ll talk later!”

Xia ruofei’s perceptual mirror could tell the mission’s completion status at the first moment, so whether this method was feasible or not, he would know once he tried it.

It was fine if he could not find the star Fern thorn soul essence in the ashes of the star Fern thorn ring. If he could find it, he could check if there were any changes to the mission progress and everything would be clear.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue rode on the qushuang flying sword and flew past the ashes of the star Fern thorn belt. His spiritual power constantly swept across the ashes.

The ring had a radius of one kilometer and a depth of about 50 meters. There were many star Fern thorns scattered around, and the ashes had also formed a thick ring.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei’s spiritual power had improved by leaps and bounds. He was able to search through the complicated ash zone in a short time.

Xia ruofei brought Ling Qingxue and flew through almost half of the ashes before they suddenly stopped..
