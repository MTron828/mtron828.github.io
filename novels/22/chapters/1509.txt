Translator: 549690339

After Xia ruofei fired, he did not care about the puppets anymore. He was 100% confident in his marksmanship. He immediately turned his gun and aimed at the two puppets that were clumsily getting up from the ground.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Without a doubt, before the two puppets could even get up, they were killed by Xia ruofei’s spear.

Xia ruofei blew at the muzzle of his gun and ignored the few puppets that had been completely destroyed. He continued to walk forward.

The surroundings grew brighter and brighter. Xia ruofei realized that he was in a ten – meter wide tunnel that extended straight ahead. He had no idea where it led to.

He couldn’t find the way out, and he didn’t know where Song Wei was. He could only follow this path and move forward.

Along the way, Xia ruofei encountered many puppets. Fortunately, he had good marksmanship and enough bullets, so he passed them easily.

In just ten minutes, he had destroyed at least forty to fifty powerful puppets, all of which were headshotted with one shot.

As they walked, Xia ruofei’s sharp senses detected something approaching. He raised his gun subconsciously.

However, unexpectedly, the opponent’s speed was extremely fast this time. Xia ruofei felt a white light flash by. He had no time to shoot and could only subconsciously Dodge to the side.

Xia ruofei felt a gust of wind blow past his face. Then, two more puppets appeared in front of him and were charging towards him.

Xia ruofei couldn’t be bothered to think about what that white light was and quickly fired two shots.

This time, the pursuing puppets seemed to be much more agile than the ones he had encountered before. They dodged at the same time, and one of the bullets missed slightly and brushed past the face of one of the puppets, blowing off one of its ears. The other bullet missed.

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. At this time, the two puppets had already arrived in front of him. Xia ruofei quickly lowered his body and swept his leg. With a bang, Xia ruofei felt as if he had kicked an iron plate. The puppet only shook a little but did not fall.

F * ck! Xia ruofei cursed.

At this moment, the two puppets had already swung their hard fists at him. Xia ruofei’s center of gravity was very low, so he rolled on the ground and dodged the fierce attack. At the same time, he fired another shot.

One of the puppets lost its balance after missing the shot and staggered forward. Xia ruofei’s bullet arrived just in time and accurately penetrated its forehead.

Pfft! A hole appeared in the puppet’s head. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

However, to Xia ruofei’s shock, the puppet was not completely dead. It only moved a little slower and its behavior seemed to be a little abnormal. It directly attacked its companion beside it.

Xia ruofei did not have time to think. He took the opportunity when the two puppets were fighting and fired a few more shots.

This time, he didn’t hold back on his bullets and fired several shots in a row.

After the gunshots stopped, the two powerful puppets finally lay on the ground and stopped moving.

Xia ruofei stood up with some lingering fear. He glanced at the two puppets that were obviously much stronger than the others.

If the next puppets they encountered were all this powerful, it would be a bit difficult to deal with them.

At this moment, Xia ruofei thought of the white light that had just appeared. He could not help but look in the direction that the white light had flown in.

Xia ruofei’s eyes widened.

He saw a pure white little beast staring at him with its black eyes. The pure white little beast looked a little like a civet cat. It was a little afraid of Xia ruofei’s pistol and there was a trace of fear in its eyes.

“Xia Qing, what animal is this?” Xia ruofei clenched his gun and looked at the little Beastie vigilantly while asking Xia Qing with his divine sense.

He had almost fallen for the magical beast’s trap before, so he didn’t dare to take this kind of small and cute animal lightly.

“Master, I can’t tell what kind of creature this little beast is ...” Xia Qing said with some uncertainty.

Xia ruofei did not feel the little beast’s murderous intent and felt slightly relieved. He walked towards the White beast.

The little white beast quickly retreated, its eyes filled with fear. As long as Xia ruofei had the intention to hurt it, it would run away without hesitation.

Xia ruofei noticed that its hind legs seemed to be injured. Its white fur was stained with blood and it was limping as it retreated.

Even after the little white beast was injured, its speed was still so fast. Xia ruofei did not see anything clearly at all. He only saw a white light flash past his eyes, which made him speechless.

Sensing the little white beast’s fear, Xia ruofei smiled gently and said,””Don’t be afraid, I won’t hurt you. ”

Xia ruofei had a strong affinity with the beast and the little white beast seemed to have a high level of intelligence. It could feel that Xia ruofei did not have any hostility towards it, so its guarded look gradually disappeared.

Xia ruofei continued,”you seem to be injured. If you don’t mind, I can help you treat your injuries.”

Xia ruofei said as he walked towards the little white beast. Soon, he was in front of it.

Being so close to Xia ruofei, the little white beast started to show fear again.

Xia ruofei squatted down and comforted her.””Don’t be afraid. I don’t have any ill intentions. I just want to check your injuries.”

With that, Xia ruofei took out a small box of ointment from the spirit map space. It was an ointment concocted with the petals of the spirit Heart Flower and was very effective for external injuries.
