Chapter 704: Super – doping drug (1)

The first subject was Chinese, which took about two and a half hours.

Xia ruofei did not go anywhere. He returned to the car and lay down in the driver’s seat. He took out his phone and casually scrolled through the news.

After watching the news for more than ten minutes, Xia ruofei suddenly had an idea. He immediately started the car and drove out of the parking space.

He considered that Lin Qiao’s house was too far away from the exam site. It would take about half an hour to drive and one hour to and fro. The two – day exam would take more than four hours on the road.

Moreover, the exam would start at three in the afternoon. If he went home later, the lunch break would be very tight.

Therefore, Xia ruofei immediately considered going to a nearby hotel to book two rooms and check out the next afternoon. This would save a lot of time and Lin Qiao could get a better rest.

Xia ruofei drove around Chengnan high school and realized that all the business hotels and Express Hotels were full of people. The parents of the other candidates had already thought of the same thing.

Many of the hotels near the examination venue had already been booked out by the parents of the examinees many days in advance.

The hotels near Xia ruofei were the same. In the end, he could only give it a try. He drove to a Kempinski Hotel about five minutes away from Chengnan middle school.

Xia ruofei thought that a five – Star hotel was so expensive, and there were more than 20 floors in Kempinski Hotel with hundreds of rooms. It couldn’t be that they had booked all of them!

After asking at the front desk, Xia ruofei found out that Kempinski only had a Business Suite that cost 2888 a day and a Presidential Suite that cost 88888 a day. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The other rooms were basically reserved by the examinees ‘parents.

Xia ruofei could not help but smile bitterly – it seemed that he had underestimated the importance parents placed on the college entrance examination!

......

At this critical moment, as long as it was beneficial to their children’s exams, even the most frugal parents would not hesitate to spend money.

Xia ruofei didn’t dare to delay and quickly booked the business Suite for two days.

After getting the room card, Xia ruofei went upstairs to take a look at the environment. Overall, he was quite satisfied.

The room was located on the 18th floor. The sound from downstairs could not reach this height, so the environment was relatively quiet.

Moreover, the room in a five – Star hotel was very comfortable. It even came with a small living room and a small study room. Lin Qiao could have a very good learning environment here.

In order to let Lin Qiao rest well, Xia ruofei went to the front desk and asked for a single bed in the living room. Yingying had prepared this for Hu Zi’s mother so that Lin Qiao could sleep in a big bedroom by herself.

Five – Star hotels all provided extra beds, but they had to pay more.

Xia ruofei went to the front desk to swipe her card, and the staff quickly laid out a simple single bed.

Xia ruofei looked at the time. There were still about an hour before Lin Qiao’s exam was over. He took out his phone and called Hu Zi’s mother.

“RUO Fei!” Hu ‘er’s mother was a little nervous.”Is there something wrong with Qiao’ er?”

“It’s fine, Auntie. Qiao’ er has entered the exam hall on time. ” Xia ruofei said,”it’s like this. I drove here today and calculated the time. It would take more than half an hour to drive from your house to the exam venue. It’s basically through the entire Urban area. It’s a waste of time to go back and forth like this.”

“Yup! But there’s no other way, the exam venue is randomly assigned. ” Hu Zi’s mother said helplessly.

“Auntie, I’ve already booked a room at a hotel near the exam hall.” Xia ruofei said,”you and Qiao’ er can stay in the hotel for the next two days! I’ll text you the hotel’s address in a while. Once you’re done preparing lunch, put it in a thermal container and take a taxi over. I’ll pick Qiao’ er up from the examination hall. ”

“Good, good, good! Ruofei, you’re so thoughtful!” Hu Zi’s mother said,”lunch is ready. I’ll pack up and leave immediately!”

This was related to Lin Qiao’s college entrance examination, so Hu Zi’s mother didn’t reject Xia ruofei politely.

“Alright! I’ll send you the address immediately!” Xia ruofei said,”Auntie, the room card is with me. Please wait in the hotel lobby for a while when you arrive. I’ll pick up Qiao’ er and we’ll go upstairs together!” Oh right, Auntie! Don’t forget to bring over Qiao’ er’s revision materials for the other subjects!”

“Alright, alright, alright. I know. RUO Fei, you should go quickly!” Hu Zi’s mother said.

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei sent the Kempinski hotel’s address to Hu Zi’s mother. Then, he went to the hotel’s parking lot to get his car and drove to Chengnan high school.

Xia ruofei found a parking space not far from the school gate and parked his car. Then, he sat in the car and waited.

At a little past 11 am, Xia ruofei got off the car and walked to the entrance of Chengnan high school.

The exam ended at 11:30 pm. At this time, many parents had gathered at the entrance of the exam hall. Their faces were full of anticipation and anxiety. Many of them could not help but pace back and forth.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but sigh,”even though the admission rate of the college entrance examination has greatly increased, I still feel the tension of a thousand troops crossing a single – Log bridge. This is the most important test in life. Not only is it testing the children, but it is also testing the parents!”

The summer sun was scorching. Xia ruofei found a shady spot under the shade of a tree and waited.

At 11:30, the bell rang from the examination hall, and the parents who had been waiting for a long time began to move towards the school gate.

In a short while, the examinees had formed into groups and were walking out.
