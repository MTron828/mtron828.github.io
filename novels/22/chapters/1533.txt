In fact, when Xia ruofei found out that there was a large – scale public bid for raw jade stones in Rui Zhou, he was already slightly moved.

Although there was no equipment that could see through the stone Skin and detect the Jade content inside, Xia ruofei had a way to determine whether there was Jade and how much Jade content there was in a raw stone. He could even roughly judge the quality of the Jade.

This method was naturally to use the spirit map scroll.

Xia ruofei had used this trick when he was at the three mountains. As long as he touched the raw jade stone with his hand, the scroll would tremble slightly if the raw jade stone contained the Jade needed for the spirit map scroll. The more Jade it contained and the higher the quality, the more intense the reaction would be.

In fact, Xia ruofei had also obtained the world stone by accident. This was also the time when the spirit map scroll had the most intense reaction. He did not even need to touch the world stone and the scroll would tremble on its own. It seemed to be very urgent.

As the saying goes,”even the gods can’t see through an inch of Jade.” Even an experienced stone gambling consultant like he Ping could only make an estimate based on the appearance, color, cracks, or the “window” of the material. At most, the probability of winning was just a little higher than the average person.

Even the best stone gambling consultant couldn’t guarantee 100% accuracy. If it was really so magical, who would be a consultant for others? Wouldn’t he be rich if he bought it?

On the other hand, Xia ruofei’s spiritual map scroll was like a cheating device. Even if he knew nothing about stone gambling, he could still win every bet. Those stone gambling experts and stone gambling consultants could not compare to him.

Take a good gamble!

This thought became even more intense after Xia ruofei entered the public Jade bid.

Buying Jade and raw stones was the same. In comparison, the raw materials that had already been cut out were much more expensive.

Moreover, gambling on raw gemstones was likely to be a bargain.

Perhaps he could get enough Jade to upgrade the spirit map space with a small amount of money. Xia ruofei’s mind was still filled with the idea of upgrading the space as soon as possible. After all, Song Wei was still unconscious!

There were still more than two hours before the bidding would end. Although there were countless raw gemstones on the spot, Xia ruofei did not need to think about it. He could get the answer immediately by touching the raw gemstones. A raw stone could be appraised in less than a second, so there was still enough time.

As for using one’s hands to touch the raw stone, naturally, no one would care. The stone gambling experts had to use a spray bottle, wet cloth, and a strong flashlight. They all wished they could lie on top of the raw stone. To appraise a raw stone, contact was naturally necessary.

These raw stones were not precious antiques. As long as they were not taken away secretly, the security guards at the scene would definitely not interfere.

The only problem now was that these raw gemstones were not being sold through bidding. Instead, everyone would write down their own prices and put them in the bidding box. There was a great deal of coincidence in this.

It was very likely that the raw stone that Xia ruofei had high hopes for would also be favored by many people. It would be hard to say if it would win the bid.

After all, Xia ruofei knew nothing about this line of work. He did not understand the people in the industry at all. He could not judge the price at all and could not guess the approximate price others would offer.

If Xia ruofei also had a stone gambling consultant, it would be fine. After all, there was someone who knew the industry to provide professional advice. However, he was alone now, and he couldn’t let He Ping help him to help Yu mingdong. Time was a little tight.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei quickly thought of a solution and this problem was solved.

He stood in front of a bidding box and tried to use his spiritual force to check it out. He immediately revealed a trace of joy. The list in the bidding box was completely read. Naturally, the price written on it could not escape Xia ruofei’s spiritual force.

This was like opening another cheating device. Nothing could stop Xia ruofei from stirring up trouble at the public Jade bid today!

Xia ruofei pondered for a moment and said to Yu mingdong,””President Yu, you guys are helping you. I’m just looking around!”

Yu mingdong’s mind was also filled with the few raw stones that He Ping had his eyes on, so he immediately nodded and said,””Good! Mr. Xia, if you want to buy a few pieces to play with, don’t bid so easily. I’ll ask old he to help me check!”

“No need, no need.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you’re so busy. Even if I wanted to buy something, I’d just buy it for fun. I don’t want to trouble old he.”

Yu mingdong and he Ping really didn’t have time, so he said readily,””That’s fine, but you’d better not compete for raw stones that are too expensive. The waters in this industry are very deep!”

Xia ruofei knew that Yu mingdong had good intentions. He smiled and nodded.””I know, President Yu!”

Yu mingdong continued,”Mr. Xia, if there’s really a raw stone that you like, you should sell it. The organizer of the duelists has already registered it. I have already paid the deposit. You just have to fill it out and put it in the bidding box. It will definitely be valid!”

In fact, to participate in the public Jade bid, one had to pay a certain amount of security deposit. This was to prevent people from bidding maliciously and disrupting the order of the trade. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Yu mingdong was very thoughtful. When he entered the door just now, he specially took an extra double order book and registered it under his name. It was prepared for Xia ruofei.

Anyway, even if Xia ruofei could not afford it, Mr. MA from Hong Kong would not let him suffer a loss.
