3060 A night in the capital city (1)

Xia ruofei skillfully maneuvered the flying boat to a stop on the rooftop of his villa.

Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei with some reluctance and said,””Ruofei, I’ll go back first!”

“Take care of yourself when I’m not around,” Xia ruofei nodded.

“I know!” Ling Qingxue said,”remember to pick a cultivation technique for us as soon as possible. Otherwise, we won’t be able to cultivate when we’re not with you ...”

“Mm! I’ll carefully choose a cultivation technique that suits you!” Xia ruofei nodded seriously.

Then, Xia ruofei looked at Song Wei and asked with a smile,””Wei Wei, do you want to play here too? I’ll also visit your parents. ”

Song Wei thought for a while and shook her head with a smile,”Forget it. If I suddenly appear in front of them, won’t they be shocked? I thought something had happened to me, running home from Beijing so late at night ...”

Xia ruofei smiled.”You’re right. I’ll let it go this time. I’ll send you back to the capital!”

“En!” Song Wei nodded.

Ling Qingxue said,”then I’ll be leaving!” Bye Bye!”

Xia ruofei and Song Wei sent her off to the deck. They watched as Ling Qingxue jumped off the airboat and stood on the rooftop of Xia ruofei’s house. The two of them waved at Ling Qingxue before Xia ruofei returned to the cabin and steered the airboat to the capital.

It only took about half an hour to fly from the three mountains to the capital.

Xia ruofei and Song Wei were chatting in the control room. Song Wei was a very gentle girl. Xia ruofei could feel calm and peaceful when he was talking to her.

Before he knew it, he had arrived at the capital.

“Wei Wei, the dormitory is closed, right?” Xia ruofei said,”it’s the middle of the night ... Why don’t we spend the night on this flying boat?” You’ll go down when the sun rises?”

“I won’t waste your time,” said Song Wei with a smile.”Aren’t you going back to Peach Blossom Island?” Let’s head straight to Yujing heaven city!”

Seven years ago, when Song Wei was admitted to Capital University, song Qiming and his wife had bought her a single apartment in Yujing Sky City, which was near the school. However, Song Wei spent most of her time living on campus, so the apartment was basically empty.

Of course, she would go back for one or two days a week, so the hygiene was well maintained and there was no problem with moving in directly.

“Then why don’t you just take me in!” Xia ruofei stretched lazily and said,”I’ve been running here and there the whole day. The total distance I’ve flown is enough to circle the earth once. I’m so tired ...”

Song Wei blushed and asked,””Aren’t you in a hurry?”

“There’s nothing urgent!” Xia ruofei looked at Song Wei and said,”besides, we haven’t been together for a long time. Don’t you miss me?”

Song Wei lowered her head and looked at her feet. She said in a low voice,””I want to! But, I’ve made an appointment with Qingxue ...”

“Your agreement has long since ceased to exist except in name!” Xia ruofei muttered.

“What are you talking about?” Song Wei raised her head and stared at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei quickly said,”no, no, no!” What I mean is ... This is also a form of subjugation! I don’t have anywhere to go in the middle of the night. Do you have the heart to let me travel alone at night? Just treat it as taking in a poor person like me for a night, is that okay?”

Song Wei burst out laughing and said,””This man’s mouth! People who didn’t know you would think you were really that pitiful! If you really want to find a place to sleep, liuhai Lane is such a big siheyuan! You can sleep in whichever room you want, right?”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Don’t mention the siheyuan. Just tell me. Are you going to take me in or not?”

“I’m scared of you!” Song Wei pursed her lips and said,”if you want to go, then follow me! You have legs, and your cultivation is higher than mine. Do you think I can stop you?” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Yes, sir!” Xia ruofei called out happily.

He hummed a song as he steered the flying boat towards Yujing Tian city, which was near Capital University.

After a while, the airboat stopped above the rooftop of Song Wei’s apartment. The two of them jumped off the airboat. Xia ruofei kept the shrunken airboat into the spirit map space, then held Song Wei’s hand and walked to the exit of the rooftop.

Soon, the two of them returned to the apartment on the 19th floor.

Although it was a single apartment, the layout was quite good. Because the floor was designed to be higher, it was separated by half a floor, forming a semi – Open bedroom on the second floor.

Below the bedroom was the kitchen, bathroom, and so on. Further in was a small living room that was connected to a balcony.

It could be said that even though a Sparrow was small, it had all the essentials.

“I’m going to take a shower. You can rest in the living room. There’s some drinks in the fridge. Take them yourself!” Song Wei said as she entered the house.

Xia ruofei put his arm around Song Wei’s shoulder and smiled.””That ... Why don’t we shower together? To increase efficiency ...”

Song Wei blushed and glared at Xia ruofei. She said, “Don’t even think about it! Go to the living room obediently and wait! By the way, I didn’t prepare any clothes for you. You have your own storage space, so you should have some clothes, right?”

“What if there isn ‘t?” Xia ruofei smirked.”Can I wear yours?”

“Why are you so bad!” Song Wei said coyly,”you settle it yourself! If you really can ‘t, I can lend you my nightdress, hehe ...”
