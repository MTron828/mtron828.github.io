3098 Tea – testing (2)

Luo Qingfeng knew that this matter was of great importance. Xia ruofei was using hypnosis to confirm the loyalty of his two disciples.

Although Luo Qingfeng was very sure, he did not think that Xia ruofei’s actions were unnecessary. Instead, he felt that it was necessary.

After all, one could never know a person’s true nature. If there was something wrong with these two disciples and the news was leaked, it could cause a chain reaction. Even the first heaven society would turn their attention to the star Seizer sect.

Therefore, it was necessary to hypnotize them again.

“Yes! Master!” Luo Qingfeng said.

Soon, Xia ruofei saw one of the disciples, Tao Wu, and another person waiting on the first floor of star – picking tower in the quiet room where Luo Qingfeng was cultivating.

Luo Qingfeng did not stay in the quiet room but waited outside the door.

“This disciple greets elder Xia!” The forty – year – old, rough – looking disciple quickly bowed and greeted Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Are you sect leader Luo’s personal disciple? What’s your name?”

“Elder, my name is Liu Hong, and I have the honor of cultivating under the sect leader’s master,” the disciple replied hurriedly.

“Oh ... Liu Hong!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”raise your head ...”

Liu Hong obediently raised his head. When his eyes met Xia ruofei ‘s, he suddenly felt as if he had fallen into the endless starry sky ...

As Xia ruofei’s spiritual power cultivation had been greatly improved, he was more comfortable with this kind of hypnosis.

To Qi layer cultivators, they simply had no power to resist.

Liu Hong quickly entered a state of hypnosis. Xia ruofei asked him a few questions, and Liu Hong answered them honestly.

These questions were all related to Liu Hong’s loyalty, and they were directly related to his true thoughts.

For example, Xia ruofei had designed a question that said,”if sect leader Luo is in danger and only you can save him, but at the same time, you will be in a very dangerous situation and may even lose your life. What would you do?” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Liu Hong, who was under hypnosis, answered without thinking,””As long as I can help sect leader, master, to turn the tide, what’s the harm in sacrificing my life?”

The other questions also revolved around loyalty.

Xia ruofei was very satisfied with Liu Hong’s answer. Xia ruofei could see that although Liu Hong’s talent was average, he was loyal from the bottom of his heart to the star Seizer sect and Luo Qingfeng. He was absolutely loyal and could not be a spy sent by other sects.

Xia ruofei skillfully got Liu Hong out of the hypnosis. Liu Hong had no idea that he had been hypnotized. His memory of this period was completely blank, so he did not notice the passage of time.

Of course, Xia ruofei’s questions were simple, so it did not take long.

Xia ruofei asked a few more questions without changing his expression. Then, he asked Liu Hong, who did not notice anything strange, to leave and ask him to send another disciple.

The other disciple was also Luo Qingfeng’s direct disciple. His name was Wang Shan, and he was already 46 years old.

Through hypnosis, Xia ruofei had finally confirmed that both Liu Hong and Wang Shan were loyal to the star Seizer sect and were even more loyal to Luo Qingfeng.

He was finally relieved and asked Luo Qingfeng to call Liu Hong into the quiet room.

Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng sat on the futon, while Liu Hong and Wang Shan stood with their hands by their sides. They were both slightly nervous.

They also knew that their talents were not as good as the other junior brothers. This time, the sect leader, master and elder Xia had called them all to zhaixing tower. They did not know if it was a blessing or a curse.

Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng exchanged a look.

Then, Xia ruofei nodded at Luo Qingfeng, indicating that he could start.

Luo Qingfeng cleared his throat and said,””Liu Hong, Wang Shan ...”

“This disciple is here!” The two of them replied in unison.

Luo Qingfeng sat up straight and said indifferently,””I called you here for a special mission.”

“What are master’s instructions? This disciple will not hesitate to go through fire and water!” Wang Shan, who was relatively quick – witted, quickly said.

Liu Hong was a little slow, but he immediately said,””Master, disciple is willing to go through fire and water for you!”

“I don’t need you to go through fire and water for this mission,” Qingfeng Luo said with a smile.”You might even benefit greatly from it!”

Qingfeng Luo paused for a moment to observe the expressions of Liu Hong and Wang Shan, then continued,””Elder Xia has found a type of spiritual tea that can promote cultivation, but its effects have yet to be verified. Today, he asked you to come to verify the effects of the spiritual tea.”

At this moment, Xia ruofei also said,””Liu Hong, Wang Shan, I have to make this clear to you. If this spiritual tea is effective, then your cultivation will probably increase by a large amount. But if there is a problem with the spiritual tea ...”

After Liu Hong and Wang Shan heard this, their faces turned pale.

Wang Shan’s voice trembled as he said,””Master, elder Xia, I am willing to test the tea with my own body. Even if I unfortunately die after drinking it, it will be due to my poor luck. I will definitely not have any complaints!”

“Master, elder, this disciple is willing to try the tea!” Liu Hong quickly said. This disciple is not afraid of death!”

It was obvious that the two of them were still a little afraid of Yingying being used as a lab rat. Who wouldn’t be afraid? Not to mention that they were already at lianqi level 8. Even if their cultivation didn’t improve in the future, they would definitely live much longer than ordinary people. Now that their lives were in danger, how could they not be afraid? Xia ruofei couldn’t help but find it funny. He deliberately said in a serious tone,””The sect leader and I won’t force you to take this test. You have to think carefully. Once you’ve decided, you can’t go back on your word! If there’s a problem with the spirit tea, the consequences might be very serious. ”

Liu Hong and Wang Shan exchanged a look, and then their expressions became determined.

“I’ve thought it through!”Wang Shan said. I won’t go back on my word!”

“I won’t change my mind!” Liu Hong said.

Then, Liu Hong changed his impassioned expression and asked weakly,””Elder Xia, if there’s a problem with the spiritual tea, what are the consequences?”

Xia ruofei almost laughed out loud. Liu Hong and Wang Shan were actually very scared now, but they still tried to maintain their posture until the end. However, Liu Hong’s last sentence revealed that he was a little scared.

Xia ruofei said with a straight face,”the consequences are indeed very serious. If there is a problem with the spiritual tea, it means that you will lose the chance to directly advance one level after drinking the spiritual tea in the future. This is because everyone can only drink this spiritual tea once in their life!” It’ll be ineffective if you take it multiple times!” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but find it funny. He deliberately said in a serious tone,””The sect leader and I won’t force you to take this test. You have to think carefully. Once you’ve decided, you can’t go back on your word! If there’s a problem with the spirit tea, the consequences might be very serious. ”

Liu Hong and Wang Shan exchanged a look, and then their expressions became determined.

“I’ve thought it through!”Wang Shan said. I won’t go back on my word!”

“I won’t change my mind!” Liu Hong said.

Then, Liu Hong changed his impassioned expression and asked weakly,””Elder Xia, if there’s a problem with the spiritual tea, what might be the consequences?”

Xia ruofei almost laughed out loud. Liu Hong and Wang Shan were actually very scared now, but they still tried to maintain their posture until the end. However, Liu Hong’s last sentence revealed that he was a little scared.

Xia ruofei said with a straight face,”the consequences are indeed very serious.
