2379 African cultivator.Therefore, if he died here, it meant that there was no possibility for his body to be buried. His body would gradually rot in this dark underground secret room, and in the end ... He might become a skeleton! Manzila thought in fear.

Just then, Xia ruofei spoke.

“I still have a few questions to ask you,” he said indifferently.

“Please ask!” Manzila quickly replied. Ask away! I’ll definitely tell you everything I know!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you’re actually using Chinese idioms!” It seems like your Chinese isn’t as bad as you said!” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

After teasing him, Xia ruofei immediately said seriously,””I have to hypnotize you before I ask you questions. Otherwise, who knows if you will deliberately use false information to disrupt my thoughts?”

“I wouldn’t dare ... I wouldn’t dare ...” Manzila said in fear and trepidation. He had completely lost the reserved manner of the leader of the Morde organization and the high priest of arulei.

“It’s your business whether you dare or not. I definitely won’t take such a risk!” Xia ruofei said,”so, you have two choices now. One is to continue resisting, and the other is to cooperate and enter the state of hypnosis as soon as possible. ”

Manzila pondered for a moment and sighed,”Alright! You can hypnotize me, I promise I won’t resist!”

Manzilla had also let it go. Anyway, even if he resisted with all his might, he would not be able to escape in the end. Moreover, he was still injured and could not escape at all.

Instead of being tortured by the other party’s mental strength and then hypnotizing him after his mental strength was exhausted, it was better to cooperate and suffer less.

“A wise man submits to circumstances!” Xia ruofei smiled.

Then, he walked to Manzila and said,””I’m going to start the hypnosis. Remember, don’t try to resist!”

“I know ...” Manzila said in frustration.

Xia ruofei then followed the spiritual hypnotism technique and used all his spiritual power to cover Manzila.

As expected, Manzila did not resist. Xia ruofei easily hypnotized him.

Xia ruofei checked Manzila’s condition and confirmed that he was really hypnotized. He then asked,””Manzila, how did you learn our Chinese martial arts?”

“Our mercenaries found a cave in a Valley in South Sudan Sutan. Inside ...” Manzilla immediately replied.

As Manzila explained, Xia ruofei roughly understood the ins and outs of the matter.

The cave in South Sudan Sutan should be the abode of a cultivator. As for why this cultivator came to the distant continent of Africa to open up an abode to cultivate, it was unknown.

However, it was certain that this cultivator must have existed for a long time, because the protective barrier he had set up was already in ruins. A group of ordinary people without any cultivation Foundation had actually broken the protective barrier with the attack of firearms.

There were some things left behind by the cultivator in the cave, including a cultivation technique, a few medicinal pills, and the black “big stone.”

The mercenaries found that there was an invisible barrier in the cave and bombarded it several times before it was blown open. They thought that there must be something valuable inside, but they did not expect that there was only a book, a few porcelain bottles, and a black “big stone”.

In the end, all these gains were handed over to Manzila, who was already the leader of the modr organization.

At first, Manzila did not take these gains seriously, until one time he mistakenly took a pill, and his whole body was extremely hot. Finally, he mistakenly tried according to the meridian circulation diagram drawn in the manual, and actually succeeded!

After the successful training, Manzila could clearly feel the change in his physique and the increase in his strength. Only then did he realize how precious these spoils of war were.

Thus, he couldn’t wait to start cultivating.

However, the manual was written in Chinese, so he couldn’t just look at the pictures.

So Manzila started to learn Chinese again.

It was just that the Chinese he learned now was very different from the classical Chinese used by the ancient people. He had suffered a lot and really “translated” the text of the cultivation method into arulei’s text. However, no one knew how accurate this was.

What made Manzilla even more mad was that those mercenaries did not pay much attention to this thing at the beginning, especially this martial arts book full of foreign characters. No one would treat it as a treasure. There was actually a guy who could not find any paper in the wild and tore two pages to use!

Therefore, this cultivation technique was missing two pages.

Under such circumstances, Manzila’s cultivation was still fine, and he had even reached refined Qi Level 3. His spiritual power was even higher, which was a miracle.

Of course, this also meant that Manzila was very likely to be a cultivation genius, and his talent was definitely very suitable for cultivation.

Otherwise, how could he have stepped into the third level of the Qi refining realm with just a book that was missing two pages, a half – baked translation of the cultivation method, a few bottles of medicinal pills, and the fact that he had missed the best age to practice? He probably wouldn’t even be able to cross the gates of cultivation.

With the increase in his cultivation, Manzila felt that the power he could control was even more powerful. Especially after his mental power increased, he found that he actually had the ability to take things from a distance, which made him even more fanatical about cultivation.

In order to carry forward the cultivation method from the mysterious East, Manzila also selected a few people as a high priest and taught them the cultivation method.

The high priest’s identity was a bit mysterious, so it was appropriate to use this identity to do this.

However, the physique for cultivation was one in a hundred or even one in a thousand. Not to mention, there was a certain difference between the physique of African people and Chinese people. There were even fewer people with the talent for cultivation. Therefore, in the past few years, only Dhaka had barely stepped into the door of cultivation. The teachings of other students had eventually come to an end.

Hence, Manzilla began to train Daka and sent him to China to study. He also gave him a very glorious mission to search for ancient Chinese books, especially those related to Daoist health cultivation. He wanted as many as he could find.

When Dhaka was studying in China, and after he started working, he bought a lot of ancient books for Manzila.

This time, he learned from the internet that someone in China was selling an ancient book that was said to be an immortal cultivation technique. He immediately flew from arulei to Ethiopia and flew to China. He traded it at a very high price. Of course, the money was Manzi ‘s.

It was a pity that cultivation techniques could not be bought on the market. In the end, Manzilla came with hope and left in disappointment.

After Xia ruofei heard Manzila’s story, he was dumbfounded.

How could he become a third Qi layer cultivator like this? This talent was a little too awesome!

He had grabbed Manzila out of the space to ask him about cultivation. It seemed that the so – called African Black cultivators had actually inherited the legacy of the Huaxia cultivators. It was likely that there were no real cultivators on the African continent.

After Xia ruofei had clarified, he threw Manzila back into the medium.

He also used his mental power to carefully search the secret room. Then, he took out the spirit map scroll.

Xia ruofei was prepared to use the secret room, which was a hidden and safe place, to enter the spirit map space.

This time, they had captured quite a number of prisoners, and these people were all locked up in the space cage! He had already been locked up for a day. If he continued, he might really drive a few of them crazy. This was his free labor, and he couldn’t waste it.

Xia ruofei stuffed the spirit map scroll into a hidden corner and entered the spirit map space.
