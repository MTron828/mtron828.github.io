3023 Ocean of resources (Part 2)

Obviously, Yuntai layman was a craftsman with a rich creative spirit.

Xia ruofei carefully kept the weapon refining manual in the stone room of the cave. He was prepared to read it when he had time.

In addition to these books, as a weapon refiner, master Yuntai naturally left behind many magic weapons he had refined.

The five flying swords were the more outstanding ones.

The quality of each flying sword was no lower than Xia ruofei’s Blue immortal sword. A special mark was printed on the body of each flying sword. A Lotus platform was faintly visible among the White clouds. It was obviously the exclusive mark of master Yuntai.

Xia ruofei did not expect that in the ancient cultivation world, refiners already had brand awareness and would even print logos on their works. He could not help but find it interesting.

There were about twenty different types of magical treasures and weapons. Xia ruofei did not look at them carefully and kept them in the stone room. Compared to spiritual stones, these things were more precious to Xia ruofei, so he had to preserve them.

What surprised Xia ruofei was that he found a flying boat in the pile of Dharma Treasures.

When the auction ended, Chen Xuan of the first heaven society personally sent Xia ruofei back to the star Seizer sect on a blue water flying boat.

After riding on the Clearwater flying boat once, Xia ruofei had started to dislike sword Kinesis flight. He had once thought that it would be great if he could have such a flying boat.

However, this kind of flying boat was a relatively high – Level magical treasure. Not everyone in the ancient cultivation world could build it. And now, the inheritance had been cut off, so it was not possible to build it. The only way was to excavate it from the ruins of ancient cultivation.

This was something that could only be encountered but not sought.

Hence, Xia ruofei did not have much hope.

However, he did not expect a flying boat to be hidden in the nested space of the storage ring.

Now that he thought about it, he had spent 50000 spiritual stones and 10 firecloud pills to buy these two storage rings. He had really made a big profit.

There were hundreds of thousands of spirit stones in the nested space of the storage ring, and this was the lowest value of these treasures and resources. The value of the other items added up was even more difficult to estimate.

From this point of view, the vast waves sect, which had sold the storage rings, had really suffered a huge loss.

However, Xia ruofei would not feel guilty over this and would even compensate the surging waves sect.

The trading in the cultivation world was similar to the antique trade in the secular world.

Treasures in the cultivation world were often unique, and their values were naturally different. This was a test of one’s vision.

Not to mention Mu Sheng from the surging waves sect, he didn’t notice anything strange about the pair of storage rings. Even Xia ruofei didn’t notice anything strange when he bought the pair of rings.

In this kind of transaction, one would always leave after buying.

Xia ruofei must be very capable to be able to discover the nested space in the ring and obtain such a great benefit. Even if Mu Sheng knew about it, it was impossible for him to go back on his words.

The virtuous should occupy it. This was the logic.

The flying boat in the nested space was also branded with the exclusive symbol of master Yuntai.

Xia ruofei could imagine that in the ancient cultivation world, treasures with the mark of the cloud platform were all high – Quality, similar to the famous brands in the secular world.

Xia ruofei was very interested in testing the flying boat in the spirit map space.

The control of the flying boat was very simple. Xia ruofei only needed to fumble around for a while before he could master it.

This flying boat was more than twenty meters long after it was enlarged. It was much larger than Chen Xuan’s Clearwater flying boat.

It was unknown what precious material the matte black body was made of, but when combined with its angular shape, it gave off a futuristic feeling.

The space inside the airboat was very spacious. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The control of this flying boat was similar to Chen Xuan’s Jade water flying boat.

Most likely, the flying ships of the ancient cultivation world were all controlled in the same way.

However, this black flying boat could use spiritual stones as its energy source and could also use spiritual crystals as its energy source.

When the spirit crystals were used to power the Flying Ship, the speed of the Flying Ship was more than doubled. Compared to Chen Xuan’s flying ship, it was several times faster.

Xia ruofei did a quick calculation. At this speed, most of the Golden core cultivators would not be able to catch up even if they were to ride on flying swords.

This was simply a divine tool for escaping!

Xia ruofei was like a child who had just gotten his favorite toy. He controlled the flying boat to rise and fall in the mountain and sea realm of the spirit map space. Sometimes he accelerated, swooped down, and turned sharply. He was having a lot of fun.

In the distance, the free laborers working in the fields and herb gardens were dumbfounded when they saw the aircraft in the sky that didn’t fit the aerodynamic design at all. The mercenaries thought they had seen an alien spaceship.

It was only under Xia Qing’s scolding and the supervision of the team leaders that everyone began to work again. However, the shock in everyone’s heart was probably difficult to erase in a short time.

Xia ruofei played for more than 10 minutes and checked the crystals that were used as the energy source. He realized that the consumption was not too high and was completely acceptable.

He shrunk the black flying boat with satisfaction and kept it in the stone room of the cave. Then, he continued to sort out the gains he had obtained this time.

Xia ruofei sorted out the cultivation resources by category. He stored the spirit stones, spirit crystals, and origin crystals in an independent space that he had specially opened up for the mountain and sea realm.

As for the magic treasures that were easy to store, they were all placed in the stone room of the cave.

Other than some magical weapons and flying swords made by master Yuntai, Xia ruofei also found an ancient crafting furnace and a set of crafting tools. There were mottled marks on this set of crafting equipment. One look and one could tell that it had been used often.

Xia ruofei guessed that it was a tool used by master Yuntai when he was refining, so he kept it carefully in the stone room of the cave.

In the future, when he had time, he would naturally study the personal letters left behind by Yuntai scholar. These were all long – Lost refining methods, and if he could learn them, there would naturally be many benefits.

Finally, Xia ruofei had finished organizing all the cultivation resources he had obtained from the storage ring’s nested space.

The harvest this time could be said to be greater than any previous time. Xia ruofei felt like he was rich.

Just the spiritual stones, spiritual crystals, and origin crystals were enough for Xia ruofei to build a top – tier sect.

It could even be said that in the current cultivation world, no top – notch sect could have as much wealth as Xia ruofei.

Of course, Xia ruofei did not have any ambition to fight for hegemony. With so many resources, what made him most pleased was that from now on, the people around him would not be short of cultivation resources. As long as their cultivation progress could keep up, there would be no limit to the supply of resources!

After Xia ruofei kept all the cultivation resources, his eyes finally fell on the ordinary – looking spiritual stone.

Bai Qingqing, who had been waiting by the side, was about to fall asleep.

...

In its opinion, there was no need to sort out the spirit stones and crystals. They could just put them away. It’s not like it’s anything valuable! This spirit stone was the most interesting one!

Seeing that Xia ruofei had finally remembered about the spiritual stone, Bai Qingqing’s spirits were lifted.

It got up from the ground and walked to Xia ruofei’s side, saying,””Boss, is it finally this spirit stone’s turn?”

Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”Xiao Bai, since you can tell that this spiritual stone is not ordinary, why don’t you tell us first?” But let me make this clear first! If you want to share the profits with me just because you’re telling me your opinion, then just pretend I didn’t say anything! And there’s really nothing to split in these spirit stones. ”

Bai Qingqing pursed her lips in disgust and said,””Boss, do I look like such a petty person ... A realm Fox? I know that you’ve already seen through the mystery of this spirit stone, and you’ve seen it much more clearly than I have. How could I still dare to ask for a share? I still want my face, okay?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’ve underestimated you!” Little white, tell me first! There’s no need to be afraid of making a mistake, just treat it as a discussion!”
