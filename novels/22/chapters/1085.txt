Chapter 1086: Chapter 687 – completely shut down_1

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei used “very” twice in a row. Song Rui could not help but laugh.”Woof! What did this unlucky child do to make you angry?”

In song Rui’s impression, Xia ruofei had always been a very peaceful person. He did not put on airs with his subordinates and was very loyal to his friends. As long as others did not provoke him, he would not be too calculative. Today, Xia ruofei’s tone was so heavy. It was obvious that this small star named Dong Xinyu had greatly offended Xia ruofei.

“You don’t have to worry about that. Just tell me if you can do it or not,” Xia ruofei said.

“Nonsense! This isn’t a big deal!” Song Rui said indifferently,”it’s something that can be settled with a phone call. Leave it to me!”

“Good! I’ll be waiting for your news!” Xia ruofei said,”thanks!”

“Hey! Why are you being so polite with me!” Song Rui said,”alright! I’ll make a call first!”

“Yes, the sooner the better!” Xia ruofei said and then hung up.

In a big house in Beijing, song Rui began to look for a number in his contact list after hanging up the phone.

As he was looking, he suddenly stopped and muttered to himself,””F * ck! I haven’t said anything yet! That kid hung up the phone ...”

However, he quickly waved his hand and said,”Forget it, forget it! Let’s help him first ... This Lord is really hard to serve!”

......

Zola’s restaurant.

After Xia ruofei finished his call, Dong Xinyu immediately smiled and said,””What are you pretending for? Do you think you can scare me with a phone call? How childish!”

Dong Xinyu did not believe Xia ruofei when he said over the phone that he wanted to shut her out completely. She felt that if Xia ruofei really had this ability, would he need to go through so much trouble to find a spokesperson? If she had such powerful connections in the entertainment industry, she could easily find a celebrity ten times more popular than her to endorse her.

Dong Xinyu did not know that Xia ruofei did not have many connections in the entertainment industry. It was just that his connections were all people who managed the entertainment industry.

Xia ruofei did have a way to find celebrities who were more popular than her to endorse his company. However, Xia ruofei did not want to do that. Most of the time, he wanted to run his company through normal business operations.

Xia ruofei didn’t respond to Dong Xinyu’s sarcasm. He didn’t even glance at Dong Xinyu from the corner of his eyes. He directly said to Tang Yitian,””Big brother Tang, this place is too noisy! Let’s go!”

“Sure!” Tang Yitian laughed. We’ve already eaten!”

After that, Tang Yitian made a gesture to the waiter who had been paying attention to them. The waiter quickly came over with a tray, on which was today’s bill.

Tang Yitian took out a credit card and put it on the tray with a smile. Then, he took out a hundred – dollar bill from his wallet and put it on the tray.”Thank you for your hard work!”

The 100 dollars was for the waiter.

“Thank you, sir!” The waiter quickly bowed.

Although Zola’s restaurant was very high – end, and the waiters received a lot of tips every day, there were not many generous customers who gave 100 dollars in one go, which surprised him.

The waiter took Tang Yitian’s credit card to the cashier to pay the bill, while Xia ruofei and the others ignored Dong Xinyu and the other two, chatting with each other while waiting.

No one responded to Dong Xinyu’s unreasonable behavior. She felt a little bored as well. She snorted coldly and said, “I’m going to the media! The media will definitely be interested in the news of the Australians suppressing the Chinese actors. When the Chinese come to boycott this movie, I’ll see how much you can sell at the box office!”

Tang Yitian and Jennifer didn’t even bat an eye. They were still smiling as they chatted with Xia ruofei and Feng Jing about the taste of the main dishes of the night.

Dong Xinyu’s threat did not cause any psychological fluctuations to Tang Yitian and Jennifer, not to mention that they had absolute confidence in Xia ruofei.

They would not be as stupid as Dong Xinyu to think that Xia ruofei’s phone call was just a Bluff to regain some face or to scare Dong Xinyu.

Tang Yitian and Jennifer had witnessed Xia ruofei’s magical ability with their own eyes. How could such a strange person do such a boring thing?

Dong Xinyu gritted her teeth and walked out.

Fang Hongli also stomped her feet anxiously and quickly caught up.

Li Yao was the most embarrassed one. He was in a terrible situation today! He looked at Tang Yitian and the others with an embarrassed expression and apologized again.

Xia ruofei didn’t have a good impression of Li Yao either, not to mention that Li Yao was working for a Japanese company in the Wei nation, which made Xia ruofei even more disgusted, so his attitude towards Li Yao was also very cold.

Tang Yitian didn’t bother to feign civility with Li Yao. He just replied with a few words. Li Yao knew that today’s grudge had been formed. If he wanted to remedy it, he could only do it in the future.

So he had no choice but to slightly bow to Tang Yitian, and then quickly left Zola restaurant.

......

Dong Xinyu walked out of the Western restaurant and quickly made her way to the parking lot.

Fang Hongli caught up with him and said worriedly,””Xinyu, you were too impulsive today ... Tang Yitian is a rich man, and we can’t afford to offend him ...”

Dong Xinyu stopped in her tracks, her eyes widened as she said,””Sister Fang, why are you blaming me too! Do you think I want to offend them? They’re the ones who went too far and didn’t give me any chance at all. What’s the difference if I don’t offend them?”

There was a type of person in this world who would only look for the reason on others when something happened and would never see the problem with themselves.

Dong Xinyu was obviously such a person.

Fang Hongli shook her head helplessly. She was different from some strong managers. Fang Hongli did not have much experience, and only Dong Xinyu was slightly more outstanding among the artistes under her. Therefore, she had always been very accommodating to Dong Xinyu, and Dong Xinyu was always the dominant one in her work.

Just then, Fang Hongli’s phone rang.

She took it out and looked at the caller ID. Then, she raised her head and said to Dong Xinyu,””Xiangxi TV’s producer Liu ...”

“Quickly answer it!” Dong Xinyu said,”he must be asking me to film some show!”

Fang Hongli nodded and answered the call. She greeted him warmly,”Hello, producer Liu!”

“What?” No one knew what producer Liu said on the other end of the phone, but Fang Hongli’s face changed.”Producer Liu, didn’t we arrange this job last month ... We ... Okay, I got it ...”

After hanging up the phone, Fang Hongli looked at Dong Xinyu and said in a low voice,””Xinyu, that award – winning singer from Xiangxi TV can’t go to the concert tour!”

Dong Xinyu had stood out on a singing talent show by Xiangxi television station. The television station had specially arranged nine concerts for the top eight winners.

This was also to take advantage of the popularity of these talent show stars and continue to promote them.

These nine concert tours were also the key work arrangements for Dong Xinyu for the second half of the year.

Dong Xinyu’s expression changed when she heard this. She said,””What’s going on? The concert was canceled? How could they do this? We’ve already filmed the promotional video, so why don’t we just shut it down!”

Fang Hongli’s expression was a little strange.””Xinyu, the concert is still open, but you won’t be able to go ...”

“What!” This time, Dong Xinyu was even more stunned, as if she had been struck by lightning.

Fang Hongli sighed,”producer Liu said that it was an emergency notice from the higher – ups ... Xinyu, do you think that Mr. Xia ...”

“Impossible!” Dong Xinyu’s expression turned extremely ugly.”He’s just a small boss from the countryside. How can he have so much power?” It must be a coincidence ...”

Before Dong Xinyu could finish her sentence, Fang Hongli’s phone rang again.

A minute later, Fang Hongli said with a serious face,””Xinyu, the television talk show that we agreed on last week has been canceled ...”

Before Fang Hongli could finish, another call came in.

Fang Hongli’s phone didn’t stop ringing. In just a few minutes, she had received at least eight or nine calls, and every call brought bad news.

The MV was taken down by the website, the advertisement that was half – shot was postponed indefinitely, and the reality show organizers retracted their invitation ...

It was as if the entire world had abandoned Dong Xinyu.

Dong Xinyu felt as if she was about to go crazy. At the same time, she felt a sense of fear that came from the bottom of her heart.

Could it really be him? This thought began to grow uncontrollably.

Soon, the phone rang again. Dong Xinyu could not help but tremble. She was now a little afraid of the ringtone of a mobile phone.

This time, it was her own phone.

“It’s ... It’s President Xu!” Dong Xinyu looked at the caller ID and could not help but say in a trembling voice.

It was the president of star brilliance media, who was also Dong Xinyu’s Big Boss.

“Quickly answer it!” Fang Hongli had a bad feeling, but she still urged in a low voice.

Dong Xinyu answered the phone in trepidation.

Before she could speak, President Xu’s roar came from the phone,””Dong Xinyu! Who the hell did you offend? Even the head of the headquarters personally called to warn me!”

Dong Xinyu’s mind went blank. She had been blown away by the bad news that came one after another. She could only subconsciously say,”President ... President Xu ... I don’t know anything ... I don’t know anything ...”

Director Xu said impatiently,”stupid B * tch!” Even if you want to die, don’t drag the company down! I’m telling you, from now on, you’re completely banned! There are still five years left in your contract with the company. If you appear on camera for even a second in these five years, I’ll F * cking change my surname to yours!”

After that, President Xu hung up the phone angrily.

“How could this be ... How could this be ...” Dong Xinyu muttered to herself, looking as if she had lost her soul.

The phone was already busy, but Dong Xinyu was still holding the phone in a daze. Her eyes were dull, and her mind was in a mess ...
