Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”sure.” However, I must remind them that the scale of this purchase doesn’t need to be too large. I still have other supply channels, so there’s no need to worry about the problem of raw materials in the future. ”

Now, there were already hundreds of people working for Xia ruofei in the spirit map space. The speed of opening up the herb garden was also very fast. Moreover, the large herb garden was used to grow the herbs needed for the heart nourishing soup and jaded skin cream.

It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that even if they didn’t rely on purchasing at all, the vast mountain and sea realm in the spirit map space would have enough medicinal herbs to supply the needs of the pharmaceutical factory.

Because the environment in the space was really too unique, the medicinal herbs that were planted would grow rapidly, and they didn’t need much maintenance. One person could manage a large medicinal garden.

“I understand. I’ll report your opinion to chief Feng and send the approval to the pharmaceutical factory as soon as possible.” Qin Yanan said.

“Yanan, if there’s nothing important, wait for me to come to the company.” Xia ruofei said,”I’m taking a day off today. I’ll probably go over tomorrow.”

“Alright, Chairman. I won’t disturb you any longer!” Qin Yanan said.

After hanging up, Xia ruofei called back his elders and friends one by one.

Everyone was shocked by the news yesterday, so they couldn’t help but call to ask about the situation.

Xia ruofei’s explanation to everyone was similar. He had liked to play football since he was young. This time, he had bought a certain percentage of the Spanish club’s shares and simply registered it with the Spanish football Association. It was purely for fun, and it could be considered as fulfilling his football dream when he was a student.

As for his performance in the game on Saturday, Xia ruofei laughed and said that he was lucky. He also said that his focus was still in China and would not really play in the professional league.

One hour passed by after the phone calls.

Xia ruofei smiled at Ling Qingxue, who was watching dramas on her iPad and said,””Wife, look at how popular we are!”

Ling Qingxue laughed and said,”look at you!” If you didn’t play a game, who would call you for no reason!”

As if he was trying to anger Ling Qingxue, Xia ruofei’s phone rang again.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh out loud. Ling Qingxue, on the other hand, glanced at Xia ruofei unhappily. She wrapped herself tightly in the blanket and looked at the iPad again.

Xia ruofei glanced at the caller ID. It was Liu Qunfeng. He had returned a few calls, but he had forgotten to return Liu Qunfeng’s call.

Since the other party had already called, Xia ruofei did not pick up. He waited for a few seconds before he swiped the answer button and said calmly,””I’m sorry! My phone was on silent just now, so I didn’t pick up your call. ”

On the other end of the phone, Liu Qunfeng laughed and said,””It doesn’t matter! It didn’t matter! I know that Mr. Xia is very busy, and I’m embarrassed to disturb you. ”

“Is there something you need me for?” Xia ruofei asked directly.

“Mr. Xia, I would like to ask, when will you return to the capital?” “I want to treat you to a meal to express my gratitude,” Liu Qunfeng said. In addition ... My father’s medicine is also fast ...”

The last time Xia ruofei left the capital, he had left enough pills for old master Liu to eat for a month. Now, he had used up more than half of them.

After seeing the news about Xia ruofei yesterday, Liu Qunfeng was a little scared. He was afraid that Xia ruofei would really settle down in Spain. What would happen to old man Liu’s illness?

During this period of time, old man Liu had been taking the pills every day, and his body was getting better day by day.

However, Xia ruofei controlled the dosage very well. Although elder Liu’s condition had improved, he still had a long way to go before he could fully recover.

If it was in the past, they would have already prayed to the heavens if they could stop her condition from worsening.

But now, he could see the hope of recovery, although the speed of recovery was a little slow. Liu Qunfeng was starting to get a little greedy again.

Besides, he was more worried that if Xia ruofei really did not come back, his father’s condition would worsen if he did not get a timely supplement after he finished the batch of pills.

If Xia ruofei were to stay in Spain they would not be able to do anything to him.

That was why Liu Qunfeng couldn’t wait to get in touch with Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei smiled and asked,””I’ve counted the days. Elder Liu’s medicine should be able to last for at least half a month ... You didn’t give him an overdose, did you? I’ve told you before that you can’t take too much of this medicine!”

“No, I didn ‘t! I don’t have any!” Liu Qunfeng quickly said,”we gave it to my father according to your medical advice.” There are only 14 pills left. Mr. Xia, we’re not sure if you’ll be able to take care of things in Beijing, so we hope that you’ll be able to stay here. ”

“Of course, this is only a request from the Liu family. We will not interfere with your personal freedom. If you have some unfinished business, you can take care of it first. We are not in a hurry!”

Xia ruofei remained calm and said,””I know! Please tell elder Liu not to worry and that he can rest at home. Since I’ve already promised him, I definitely won’t go back on my word. ” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“I understand, I understand, I understand!” Liu Qunfeng quickly said,”of course we trust you, Mr. Xia. It’s just that the pills are getting less and less, and I’m worried that once we stop taking them, my father’s condition will worsen. That’s why I took the liberty to disturb you, Mr. Xia. I hope you don’t mind.”

“Hahaha!” Xia ruofei said,”that’s not necessary. If there’s anything, let’s communicate immediately! If there’s anything wrong with elder Liu’s body, please contact me immediately. I’ll rush over as fast as I can. ”

“Alright! Alright!” “Thank you, Mr. Xia,” Liu Qunfeng said.

After hanging up the call with Liu Qunfeng, Xia ruofei threw his phone on the bed and sprawled on it. “”The world is finally peaceful!”

The two of them stayed in bed until it was almost noon before they got up.

As usual, Xia ruofei cooked personally. The two of them had lunch together and after the meal, they worked together to wash the dishes.

Nowadays, the company’s lunch breaks from nine to five in the morning weren’t very long. It was basically just enough for the employees to order takeaway and have a meal. At most, they would just lie on the table and take a short nap before getting up to work.

Hence, Ling Qingxue did not stay at Xia ruofei’s place after she finished eating. She politely declined Xia ruofei’s suggestion to let her rest for a while. She smiled and kissed Xia ruofei on the cheek.”Be good! Have a good rest at home in the afternoon. I’ll come back to accompany you in the evening after work!”

“You’re treating me like a child!”Xia ruofei said, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.

“Yup!” Ling Qingxue smiled.”Why don’t you call me mom?”

Xia ruofei rolled his eyes and said in a childish voice,””Mother! I want to drink granny ...”

Ling Qingxue’s face immediately turned red. She pouted and said,”The milk is in the fridge, take it yourself!”

After she finished speaking, she ran away from Xia ruofei’s laughter.

After Ling Qingxue left, Xia ruofei went straight to the bedroom upstairs. After locking the doors and windows and drawing the curtains, he took out the spirit map scroll from his palm and entered the medium with a thought.
