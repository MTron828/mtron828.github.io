Chapter 479: A condition (3)

“Alright, brother Xia!”

Xia ruofei continued to drive after giving his instructions. He parked the car in the courtyard of the villa.

……

Kempinski Hotel, luxury suite.

The house was in shambles. The expensive tea set that had just been replaced had once again turned into a pile of ceramic fragments on the ground.

Liang Haiming’s eyes were red, and he looked ferocious. Not far from him, the middle – aged man stood trembling, not even daring to breathe.

“You tell me what the f * ck is going on!” Liang Haiming glared at the middle – aged man and asked fiercely,”why is Zhao he in the police station?!”

The middle – aged man said carefully,”young master Liang, we’ve found out from our acquaintances in the police station that Zhao he was caught by the police this afternoon. I heard that he was subdued by a passerby. So, we’re guessing that Zhao he made a mistake.”

“Fuck! How could he have missed?” Liang Haiming shouted,”that Xia ruofei has such a small body. Zhao he can probably flip him over with one slap!” What’s going on?”

The middle – aged man forced a smile and said,””Young master Liang, I feel that ... We might have underestimated Xia ruofei’s skills. If I’m not wrong, the Army he’s been serving in all these years shouldn’t be simple. ”

Liang Haiming frowned, thought for a while, and said,””Is there any way to get Zhao he out?”

In the past few years, Zhao he had become Liang Haiming’s right – hand man. Zhao he was quite powerful, and Liang Haiming was not willing to lose a capable man like this.

“Young master Liang, the police have verified Zhao he’s real identity. I heard that there is a squad of armed police guarding Zhao he’s ward. The Public Security Bureau is taking him seriously!” The middle – aged man said with embarrassment.

“Could it be that the Public Security Bureau can’t find a breakthrough?” Liang Haiming asked with a frown, then continued,”if you really can’t do it, just spend some money!”

“Young master Liang, the southeast province isn’t under the family’s traditional sphere of influence, after all.” The middle – aged man lowered his head and said,”the people we can use at the moment aren’t very high – ranked. “Also ... I heard that after the Public Security Bureau caught Zhao he, they started to report it to the higher – ups after verifying his identity. Now, they might have reported it to the Department. There’s almost nothing we can do ...”

Liang Haiming was the son of the two families, and with the help of Jin Yuan, he could indeed win over a group of people, including his people in the Public Security Bureau. However, Zhao he was an A – Class wanted criminal in the Ministry of Public Security, and the case he had committed had caused a great impact in the country. It was a great achievement for the leaders of the Public Security Bureau to arrest such a vicious family extermination suspect, so they reported it immediately.

Obviously, compared to money, the Public Security Bureau’s leaders were more interested in the appreciation of the Department leader and a real black gauze hat.

This was human nature.

Liang Haiming’s face darkened even more, but he still held back his anger. After a long while, he asked helplessly,”Is there no other way?”

The middle – aged man shook his head and said,””Young Liang, as long as there’s a glimmer of hope, we’ll try our best to get Zhao he out. But this time, we really have no other way ...”

Liang Haiming waved his hand and said,”Then forget it!”

“He didn’t say anything he shouldn’t have, did he?” Liang Haiming asked again.

“According to the information we have, the police interrogated him as soon as he finished his operation,” the middle – aged man said quickly.”But he didn’t say anything other than that he was the one who committed the murder.”

Liang Haiming nodded and said, Think of a way to pass him a message, tell him to watch his mouth! Also, tell him that as long as he doesn’t say anything, I’ll help take care of his child!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Okay, young master Liang ...” The middle – aged man immediately responded.

Liang Haiming reached out and picked up the stack of documents on the coffee table. The first page was Xia ruofei’s photo.

Xia ruofei was smiling brightly in the photo.

Liang Haiming stared at Xia ruofei’s photo, his expression turning ugly.
