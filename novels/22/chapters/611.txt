Chapter 612: Special cigarettes (2)

Li Zhifu chuckled and said,”little song, be content!” It’s not easy to find tea Green of this level. This kid only brought about one Jin of Tea Green to Mount Wu Yi yesterday. He probably has at most half a Jin in his hands now ...”

Elder song laughed and said,”others might not be able to get more tea leaves, but little Xia can!” Xiao Lu, give that kid a call tomorrow and tell him to send me more next time. I won’t let him in if it’s less than half a pound!”

Manager Lu’s eyes lit up and he immediately nodded.””Yes, chief ...”

An official of manager Lu’s level would naturally not look at the surface of the problem.

Elder song’s words sounded unreasonable, and half a catty of this tea leaf might be worth one or two million, but that wasn’t the point.

China was so big, and there were countless people who wanted to give elder song a gift. When had elder song ever accepted a gift from someone else? Xia ruofei was definitely an exception.

From elder song’s tone, it was obvious that he did not treat Xia ruofei as an outsider. Manager Lu even felt that elder song would not be so close to Xia ruofei, even to his own nephew.

Xia ruofei didn’t know that he had become much more important in manager Lu’s heart. He was driving down the mountain.

After the car made a turn on the mountain road, the two of them heaved a sigh of relief.

Xia ruofei and ye Lingyun were both from the Special Forces. Xia ruofei had served in the famous lone wolf assault team, so they were more sensitive to their surroundings than ordinary people.

After turning the corner, the two of them felt their bodies relax. It was obvious that they had left the range of elder song’s guards.

Ye Lingyun, who was sitting in the front passenger seat, also felt much more relaxed. He curiously opened the black plastic bag and said,””Brother Xia, let me see what good cigarettes elder song gave you!”

......

Xia ruofei just drove with a smile and didn’t care about ye Lingyun.

“Eh? Why is there nothing here?” “White packaging?” ye Lingyun exclaimed in surprise. What kind of cigarette is this?”

Xia ruofei turned his head and glanced at the cigarettes in ye Lingyun’s hands. They were both wrapped in white without any logo or pattern.

“Won’t you know when you open it?” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Then I’m going to tear it down!” Ye linyun said.

“Tear it down!” Xia ruofei said,”aren’t cigarettes for smoking? What’s the point of tearing it down?”

Hence, ye Lingyun tore open the package in no time.

“Hey! There are also white boards inside!” Ye Lingyun exclaimed in shock.

He took out all the cigarette boxes. The ten packets of cigarettes were all white in packaging, without any logo or patterns.

“Open it and see!” Xia ruofei said.

Ye Lingyun immediately opened a pack of cigarettes and took one out. He turned on the front car lights and looked around.”Brother Xia, there’s no logo on the cigarettes. The chief wouldn’t give you three – no – none products, would he?”

Xia ruofei rolled his eyes and said,”do you think that’s possible?”

“This ... Seems a little ... Unreasonable ...” Ye Lingyun laughed.

“Nonsense!”

At this moment, Xia ruofei thought of a rumor and suddenly had an idea.

At this time, the car had already reached the foot of the mountain. The intersection was the winding Expressway. Xia ruofei drove the car to the side and stopped. He turned on the double flashing lights.

“What’s wrong, brother Xia?”

“Lingyun, give me the opened pack of cigarettes,” Xia ruofei said to ye Lingyun.

Ye Lingyun handed the pack of cigarettes to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei took the cigarette box, took out all the cigarettes, and put them aside. Then, he carefully removed the foil inside.

Xia ruofei took the empty box and shone it under the light. As expected, there seemed to be a pattern inside the box.

Ye Lingyun also came over to take a look and mumbled,””Brother Xia, What is this?”

Xia ruofei opened the soft cigarette box and spread it out.

The lights in the car were very bright. Ye Lingyun could tell at a glance. “Isn’t this Panda smoke?”

The inside of the cigarette box was a picture of two pandas, including a cigarette factory, tar content, and a quit smoking slogan.

In fact, it was the outer packaging of Panda cigarettes that could be seen on the market. However, it was packaged in reverse, so the white side could be seen on the outside.

“Brother Xia, why are these cigarettes packaged in reverse?” Ye linyun asked.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ve guessed it just now. This is a special supply of cigarettes for the leaders and directors of the state. I’ve heard that special cigarettes are packaged in the reverse side of the ordinary cigarette box. I didn’t expect to see it today!”

“Is this the legendary special supply of cigarettes?” ye linyun’s eyes lit up.

“Most likely ...” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”come, come, come, one cigarette ...”

With that, Xia ruofei grabbed two cigarettes and threw one to ye Lingyun. Then, he took one in his mouth, flicked the lighter, and lit the cigarette.

The two of them took a deep puff at the same time. The feeling was really different from ordinary cigarettes. It was slightly light, but the fragrance was rich.

“This is a good cigarette ...” Ye linyun praised.

Then, he looked at the remaining 18 cigarettes and chuckled,””Brother Xia, you’ve already opened the cigarette box, so these cigarettes ...”

“You can take it and draw!” Xia ruofei said nonchalantly,”do you have anything?”
