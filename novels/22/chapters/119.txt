Chapter 120: It’s time to go on stage, let’s talk about what’s on our minds (1)

Steel Spear’s first book,”rebirth: long wind and waves”, was released on May 28,2006 on Qidian Chinese website. He remembered that the domain name at that time was still “CMFU.” It had been going around for more than ten years, during which he had suspended writing for a period of time due to work reasons. Later, he followed his old team to write 4.6 million words “super top – grade popinjay” in the creation world. This time, he finally released a new book on Qidian. Speaking of which, steel gun could be considered an old driver of Qidian. However, ten years had passed, and everything had changed. That’s why steel gun wrote his new book with the mentality of a newbie. Just like what I signed on QQ: Not impetuous, not slacking off, not forgetting his original heart. Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye,”God – Level farm” had been released on Qidian for nearly two months. After its new book period, it would welcome an important moment to be put on the shelves the next day. If a new book was a process of accumulating popularity, then putting it on the shelves was a test of the new book’s results. Subscription and monthly votes were undoubtedly the two most important indicators. At this moment, steel spear was both excited and nervous. They were excited because their two months of hard work was finally beginning to pay off, while they were nervous because of the uncertainty of the results after the publication. A book, a few months of preparation time, a lot of effort, steel spear couldn’t help but worry about the gains and losses. Therefore, today, steel spear didn’t complain or stir up emotions. He only sincerely asked for help. Please support the original reading. Every word in a book was the blood, sweat, and tears of the author. To you, a chapter is only a few cents, and you might finish it in a few minutes, but to the author, it’s a few hours of hard thinking and thousands of times typing on the keyboard ... Let’s take a monthly update of 200000 words and 5 points for 1000 words (this is the highest price on Qidian) as an example. If you want to support the original book, you only need to pay 10 yuan a month, which is an average of 30 cents a day. If it was a high V with 3 points per 1000 words, it would only cost 6 Yuan a month, an average of 20 cents a day. From time to time, Qidian would also engage in top – up discounts, which would further reduce the cost. With the price of goods skyrocketing, this amount of money was not even enough to buy a pack of cigarettes! And the authors had to rely on this 32 cents a day to make a tower of sand and earn their living. Steel gun believed that most of his readers would not care about a few cents. However, a considerable number of people felt that it was troublesome to top up money. After all, it was not difficult to find “free resources” on the internet. However, if everyone read the so – called “free resources”, how would the authors who couldn’t earn any royalties support their writing to complete millions of words? If the author could not continue writing, it would damage the interests of all the readers who loved the book. Wasn’t it a simple logic? Moreover, after yuewen group had integrated all the resources, it was really not troublesome to top up. QQ Wallet, WeChat Wallet, Alipay ... You could choose from all kinds of channels. A red packet that you randomly grab on WeChat can be topped up with Qidian coins and you can read many VIP chapters. Back to the matter of a new book being published, the number of chapter subscriptions in 24 hours was a benchmark for a book to a large extent. It determined how high the book could reach and how much potential it had. Without a doubt, if the 24 – hour subscription data was extremely low, it would be a devastating blow to the author’s confidence. Hence, steel gun once again implored everyone to subscribe and support his VIP chapter as soon as possible. On the first day of release, gunslute would update six chapters. In the new month, many brothers and sisters have guaranteed monthly votes. Steel gun also hopes to have some achievements on the monthly votes ranking. If you’re satisfied with watching tomorrow, please support steel gun with your monthly votes! We’ll see you at noon tomorrow!CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
