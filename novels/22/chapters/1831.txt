Translator: 549690339

Ling Qingxue suddenly became nervous. After she extended her right hand, she stared at Xia ruofei without blinking. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Xia ruofei’s eyes were still closed. He looked like he was not moving, but in reality, his spiritual power had already entered Ling Qingxue’s body.

After a long time, Xia ruofei finally opened his eyes.

There was still no change in his expression, but there was already a great disturbance in his heart.

It wasn’t because the medicine didn’t work. On the contrary, the effect was so good that Xia ruofei could not believe it.

Now, Ling Qingxue’s cultivation talent had obviously increased by a large margin. The rarest thing was that her affinity with spiritual Qi had also increased by a lot.

If Ling Qingxue had been considered a “good – for – nothing” before she had taken the heart concentrating grass, which meant that she had been completely unable to cultivate, then after the first time she had taken the medicine, she had basically evolved into a “mediocre” person. She had barely been able to cultivate, but her talent could only be said to be barely satisfactory.

However, after taking the medicine for the second time, Ling Qingxue could barely be considered a “genius.” Now that she was in contact with cultivation, she would definitely be able to achieve twice the results with half the effort when compared to those with ordinary talent.

According to Xia ruofei’s judgment, Ling Qingxue’s talent in cultivation was even higher than Song Wei ‘s.

In other words, the second time he took the heart concentrating grass, the effect would be even better than the first time.

This was somewhat illogical. He had also asked Xia Qing, but even Xia Qing couldn’t figure it out.

Xia ruofei even had the thought of continuing to cultivate the heart concentrating grass for Ling Qingxue to consume. However, he had just opened his mouth when Xia Qing persuaded him bitterly.

“Master, you can’t do that!” Xia Qing said. Miss Ling’s talent was already very good. Even if she took more heart concentrating grass, her improvement would be very limited. It’s said that the several nature – defying physiques can’t be obtained by taking the heart – concentrating grass. They’re all innate. If you continue to take the heart – concentrating grass, the only result will be a waste of five spiritual crystals. ”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and felt that the price of five spiritual crystals was indeed a little high. After all, if he used up the five spiritual crystals, there was a high possibility that there would be no effect at all. There was no need to take the risk now.

Ling Qingxue’s talent had already made him very satisfied.

In the future, if he could find more spiritual crystals or even better spiritual herbs, Xia ruofei was willing to give it another try. After all, even if Ling Qingxue started cultivating, her talent would not be solidified and she would not be able to improve anymore.

After making up his mind, Xia ruofei turned to look at Ling Qingxue.

Ling Qingxue was obviously a little nervous, and her voice trembled slightly.””RUO Fei, how is it?”

Xia ruofei’s eyes revealed a trace of a smile as he deliberately sighed.

Ling Qingxue’s heart sank, and she asked in disappointment,””Still not working? RUO Fei, could it be that my physique is that bad? After recuperating for so many days, you still can’t meet the cultivation requirements?”

Xia ruofei finally couldn’t help but laugh.”When did I say I can ‘t? Qingxue, your body is fine now. You can start cultivating at any time!”

Ling Qingxue was stunned for a moment, but then she immediately realized that Xia ruofei’s pained expression and sighing were just a trick.

She glared at Xia ruofei and bit her lower lip. She punched Xia ruofei and said,””Hey! How can you be so bad! Can’t you see how nervous he is? he’s still in the mood to joke!”

Xia ruofei didn’t Dodge. He laughed and said,”I didn’t say anything!”

“Then what do you mean by frowning and sighing?” Ling Qingxue asked in a bad mood.

“Wife, you’ve misunderstood me!” Xia ruofei smiled and explained,”I’m just wondering why my wife is so outstanding. His physical condition was simply too good. Once he started cultivating, wouldn’t he advance at a tremendous pace? He might surpass me soon! What would I do then? Your husband is weak!”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but burst out laughing.””You’re so glib! I don’t believe your nonsense!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Qingxue, you’re really talented!” Although I’ve missed the best age to cultivate, talent can make up for it a little. There should still be enough time to start cultivating now. ”

“Really?” Ling Qingxue asked, full of anticipation.

“Why Would I Lie to You?” Xia ruofei asked. You’re indeed very talented in cultivation. It doesn’t matter if I’m older. I’ve only started cultivating for about a year, and I’m already at Qi disciple Level 6, right?”

“Qi disciple Level 6?” Ling Qingxue’s interest was immediately piqued.”Is this the hierarchy of cultivators?” Isn’t Qi disciple Level 6 already very powerful?”

A few days ago, Ling Qingxue had seen with her own eyes that Xia ruofei had slashed in the air and even split the waves in half. She was also dazzled by his ability to teleport.

Xia ruofei smiled.”I’ll tell you about this cultivation knowledge in the future. There’s no rush to understand so much now!”

“En!” Ling Qingxue nodded and said,”I’ll listen to you!”

“Why do you believe my ‘nonsense’ now?” Xia ruofei jokingly asked.

“I’m being serious!”Ling Qingxue was embarrassed and annoyed.

“Actually, I’ve always been very serious. You’re the one who thinks I’m not serious!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Seeing that Ling Qingxue was about to flip out, Xia ruofei quickly said,””Back to the main topic! Back to the main topic! Qingxue, I’ll officially teach you the cultivation technique today! Of course, before you start cultivating, you need to first feel the spiritual energy. This is the key step in entering cultivation!”
