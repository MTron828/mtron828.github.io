Chapter 3436: Out of expectations (2)

Translator: 549690339

“That’s reasonable!” Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”however, my cultivation level is low. I’ll be counting on you!”

Xia ruofei pretended to be generous and waved his hand.””No problem! With me here, you can just wait for your cultivation to advance by leaps and bounds!”

Ling Qingxue laughed so hard that she was bent over.

The two of them passed through the hall and continued walking.

The heavenly cloud Palace was indeed a test of comprehensive strength. Following that, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue encountered wave after wave of enemies.

Basically, all the tests that he had encountered in the previous levels of the Tower of Trials appeared here.

Sometimes, they would even come out in a group. For example, Xia ruofei had encountered a Mirage beast hidden in the star Fern thorn bush. He was concentrating on setting up the array and almost fell into an illusion.

Besides, when Xia ruofei was fighting the Mirage beast, he had just fallen into an illusion. It was not too dangerous. As long as it was not a high – Level Mirage beast, he would be able to wake up quickly even if he fell into an illusion. However, this time, as soon as he fell into the illusion, there were extremely fast star beasts that immediately attacked Xia ruofei.

He didn’t want to kill Xia ruofei with the illusion, but hoped that the Star Beast would appear when Xia ruofei was in a daze and end the battle quickly.

Fortunately, after Xia ruofei’s spiritual power was greatly improved, the illusion’s effect on him was much smaller. He woke up in time before the astral beast’s attack landed on him and avoided the fatal attack by a hair’s breadth.

There were more than ten waves of tests like this, and Xia ruofei had a hard time dealing with each one.

However, Xia ruofei’s actual combat experience had improved greatly after he had experienced various attack combinations. He combined flying swords, formations, and the use of the spirit map space very flexibly. He was able to turn danger into safety every time. No matter how the patterns changed, he became more and more familiar with these techniques and the more he fought, the more he was able to adapt to them.

Finally, after eliminating the last group of star beasts, Mirage beasts, and golden core stage puppets, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue arrived at the back garden of the palace.

This back garden was much larger than the garden between the two halls that they had passed before. There were also much more spiritual plants and the scenery was more beautiful. Everything seemed to be one with nature, very close to the way of nature.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue strolled around the back garden. The air they breathed in was rich with spiritual energy, making them feel relaxed and happy.

At this moment, Xia ruofei did not have any warning signs. He felt that there should be no more danger, so he was much more relaxed than before.

In fact, as soon as he stepped into the back garden, Xia ruofei felt comfortable all over, as if he was living in the Spirit map space.

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but take a deep breath and said,””RUO Fei, how nice it would be if we could live here forever! I don’t think even the environment of Paradise Island is as good as this place!”

The Peach Blossom Island was now considered a Holy Land for cultivation. It was just that it had not been exposed to the world of cultivation. Otherwise, even Chen Nanfcng of the first heaven society would be jealous. Although his cultivation base was almost the number one in the world, there were still so many disciples under him! The cultivation environment of the first heaven society was far inferior to that of the Paradise Island. Of course, the peach source Island couldn’t accommodate a sect as big as the first heavenly sect. However, the spiritual Qi concentration in the back garden of the heavenly cloud Palace was much higher than that of the Paradise Island. In addition, the environment here was more beautiful. It was the most basic thing to change the scenery with a step. This kind of garden that was close to the way of nature could not be found on earth, let alone an Island full of man – made traces like the Paradise Island.

It should be known that peach source Island was just a backup plan set up by the Liu family in case of a major crisis in the future. The scenery on the island could only be said to be unsatisfactory, but there were reinforced concrete buildings everywhere.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”then take in a few more breaths of the air here. It’s free anyway!” As for the peach source Island … Didn’t we get a set of allheaven formation flags this time? I’ll go back and make some arrangements. It’ll be of great use to improving the cultivation environment. As for the natural environment, that’s the only way. It’s definitely incomparable to this place.” “However, the Peach Blossom Island is our home!” Ling Qingxue smiled sweetly and said,”no matter how good this place is, it’s still someone else’s. Nothing is better than home!”

“I like to hear that!” Xia ruofei said,”from now on, we’ll settle down on Peach Blossom Island. We’ll watch sunrise and sunset together, listen to the ebb and flow of the tide together, enjoy the sea breeze together, and work hard on cultivation together…”

Ling Qingxue nodded and said,””Mm! They only envied mandarin ducks, not Immortals! I think this sentence is very incisive!”

“Hahaha! I also feel the same way!” Xia ruofei said,”Qingxue, let’s go! Let’s take a look at this garden, or we won’t have the chance in the future. I’m sure that the Imperial garden in the palace is simply a small vegetable garden compared to this!”

Ling Qingxue looked at the beautiful scenery in front of her and did not think that Xia ruofei was exaggerating. She held Xia ruofei’s hand and said,””It’s a pity that Vivi didn’t have the chance to see such beautiful scenery…”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. “There’s no other way. We can’t bring this back garden! Why don’t we take some videos for her to enjoy?” “Don’t! Don’t! Wouldn’t that be more exciting for her?” Ling Qingxue quickly said,”she was already in a bad mood when she couldn’t come with us this time II

“I’m just joking…” Xia ruofei quickly replied.

The two of them walked together in the back garden, smelling the unique fragrance of the surrounding spiritual flowers and grass. They strolled along the winding path between the pavilions and water pavilions. Unconsciously, their bodies and minds relaxed.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue made two rounds and came to a Pavilion.

The design of this octagonal pavilion was simple and unsophisticated, and the eight pillars were engraved with complicated and exquisite patterns. Most importantly, there was an octagonal pillar in the middle of the pavilion, and at the top of this Octagon pillar was a barrier that emitted a faint light. Through the barrier, a crystal – like sign could be faintly seen standing quietly in the center of the barrier.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue’s attention was naturally attracted. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“It’s so beautiful!” Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but exclaim,”RUO Fei, can you tell what that thing is?”

Xia ruofei shook his head.”I don’t know. But it must be something good. Let’s go in and take a look!”

“En!”

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue stepped up the steps and walked towards the pavilion.

Xia ruofei also stopped playing and focused on being on guard. After all, the crystal card protected by the barrier was not an ordinary object, so he did not know if there would be any danger in the pavilion. Generally speaking, there would be secret mechanisms in such an important place.

However, to Xia ruofei’s surprise, the two of them entered the pavilion easily.

From the steps up to the front of the Octagon Prism Stone platform, he didn’t encounter any obstacles, nor did he suddenly shoot arrows or anything like that. In short, it was calm and peaceful.

This was completely out of Xia ruofei’s expectations.

However, this was not a big deal. After all, the crystal card was still under the protection of the barrier.

Xia ruofei was not unfamiliar with this kind of barrier. When he was in the stone room in the mountain sea realm in the spirit map space, he had continuously benefited from the barrier. The Jade talisman of inheritance was protected inside the barrier.

That was why he knew very well that while these barriers looked the same, they were very different in terms of their toughness. Some of them could be broken by Qi refining stage cultivators, while some could not even be broken by golden core stage cultivators. He guessed that barriers that even nascent Soul Stage cultivators could not break existed, but Xia ruofei had not encountered one yet.

He looked at the translucent barrier in front of him and the crystal card inside the barrier, which was obviously something good, and muttered in his heart,”How strong was the barrier? It couldn’t be the kind that even nascent soul cultivators couldn’t do anything to?
