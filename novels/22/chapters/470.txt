Chapter 471: The missing military dagger (1)

“That ... Officer Qin ...” Xia ruofei softened his tone and said,”this dagger means a lot to me. Can you ... Not confiscate it?”

This bug& & Strider 888 was a trophy that Xia ruofei had obtained from his first cross – Border Battle after he became an official Special Forces member. He had carried it with him for many years.

This military dagger carried too much of Xia ruofei’s military memories. When he retired last year, the Army had specially approved Xia ruofei to leave the Army with this military trophy, which symbolized the honor of the soldiers.

To Xia ruofei, it was more like a Medal of Honor with iron – blooded loyalty than a sharp killing weapon.

Qin Xiao Yu saw that Xia ruofei’s attitude had softened and she felt a sense of comfort. A faint smile appeared on her face as she shook her head firmly and spat out two words,””No!”

Xia ruofei said with a bitter face,”I helped you guys subdue a dangerous person!” Can’t you just give me some face?”

Qin Xiao Yu shrugged her shoulders innocently and said: “”I’ve already stopped pursuing the issue of your possession of a controlled knife. Isn’t that giving you enough face?”

Xia ruofei gritted his teeth in anger, but he couldn’t do anything to Qin Xiao Yu. She was representing the authorities, and the reason for confiscating the military dagger was also high – sounding. In this matter, Qin Xiao Yu occupied the moral high ground.

Xia ruofei looked at the police officers beside him and said in a low voice,””Qin Xiao Yu! What do you want? I don’t have any grudges with you, right? That dagger has an extraordinary sentimental value to me, but to you, it’s just a dagger. Is there a need to be so serious?”

Qin Xiao Yu’s heart bloomed with joy. She glanced at Xia ruofei, wrinkled her nose and said with a smile,””Is this the attitude you should have when you’re asking for help? ‘You’re speaking so stiffly. Hmph ... Why should I be lenient?’ Are they close to you?”

The few policemen looked at each other with a strange expression. It was the first time that they had seen such an expression on Captain Qin’s face. At this moment, Qin Xiao Yu did not look like an impartial policewoman, but more like a little girl who was angry with her boyfriend.

Xia ruofei suppressed the dissatisfaction in his heart and softened his attitude.””Officer Qin, what do I have to do to make you return this dagger to me? You have to state your conditions first, right?”

Qin Xiao Yu held back her laughter and said with an exaggerated expression,””Conditions? Aiya ... Someone’s attitude just now was so bad that I’m a little confused. I can’t recall it for a while ... Why don’t we wait a few years for me to remember?”

“You ... If I hadn’t thrown that dagger, you might have been shot! And now you’re confiscating my dagger? “Ungrateful, burning the bridge after crossing the river, killing the donkey when the millstone is done, uproot...That heartless ...” Xia ruofei was at his wit’s end when it came to this policewoman who had seized his weakness but refused to listen to anything. He could only mumble to her.

Although it was only a dagger, it was of great significance to him. Qin Xiao Yu must have also seen this point, that’s why she could manipulate him like this ...

Qin Xiao Yu was in a very good mood under Xia ruofei’s “blood and tears complaint”. Even when Xia ruofei said “pull ... That heartlessness”, her face only blushed slightly, but she still looked at Xia ruofei with a smile. No matter what Xia ruofei said, she was not moved.

At this moment, a police officer in charge of contacting the rear quickly walked over and said excitedly,””Captain Qin, I’ve found it! We’ve caught a big fish!”

Qin Xiao Yu didn’t bother to tease Xia ruofei and quickly asked,””What’s the situation?”

The police officer was so excited that his face turned red. He said loudly,””Captain Qin, the guy we caught is an A – Class wanted criminal from the Ministry of Public Security. He’s Zhao Zhixi, the suspect on the run for the Liaodong case five years ago!”

Xia ruofei pouted and said weakly,””I was the one who caught him ...”

“yes!”Xia ruofei’s words were directly ignored by Qin Xiao Yu. She waved her fist in excitement and said,”well done!”

They were still waiting for the ambulance, so Qin Xiao Yu simply pulled the police officer to ask about the specific situation.

“Are you sure? Is there a mistake?” Qin Xiao Yu was a little worried at this time. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Capturing an A – Class wanted criminal from the Ministry of Public Security, a case that had been unsolved for five years, was a great achievement! He would definitely be able to add a highlight to the animation.

“Captain Qin, this guy probably went for plastic surgery. He’s a completely different person from the photo in the file, but he got into a fight and was detained when he was young, so his fingerprints are in the system. We just sent the fingerprints we collected back for comparison, so you can rest assured!” It can’t be wrong!”

“That’s great ...” Qin Xiao Yu said excitedly.

When luck comes, it really can’t be stopped! He was actually able to catch an A – Class criminal when he was out on patrol ...

The police were also discussing excitedly. At this time, Zhao he, who was already cuffed, suddenly let out a scream. Qin Xiao Yu and the others were shocked and quickly turned their heads.

“What’s wrong with you?” Qin Xiao Yu asked with a frown.

“My ... My hand ...” Zhao he’s voice trembled from the pain.

Qin Xiao Yu’s face changed slightly, she turned Zhao he’s body around and saw that his hand that was handcuffed behind his back, the military dagger had disappeared, and there was a penetrating wound that was bleeding.
