Chapter 1753: Another gift of ink (3)

Xia ruofei thought to himself,”for a high – ranking officer like you, the government is in charge of your daily life. Do you still need to think about this?”

In fact, a provincial – Level cadre could already enjoy the treatment of a villa, and the other aspects of security were also quite good.

“Manager Lu, please come in!” Xia ruofei extended his hand and made an inviting gesture. He brought manager Lu into the courtyard house through the main entrance.

Meanwhile, Wu Qiang directed the driver to drive the car in from the side door.

Manager Lu had obviously done some research on the architecture of the former Qing Dynasty. As he walked in, he looked around with great interest and even gave a few words of praise from time to time.

The two of them went straight to the courtyard where Xia ruofei lived.

“Manager Lu, shall I show you around?” Xia ruofei asked.

“No need!” Manager Lu waved his hand with a smile. I didn’t dare to take a closer look, or else I’ll be jealous to death ... When I was your age, I was still a propagandist in the village commune! But you already own such a big courtyard in the capital where every inch of land is worth its weight in gold, and it’s even in the prime location ...”

Xia ruofei chuckled and scratched his head.””Times have changed ...”

“Yup! “Times are different ...” Manager Lu sighed and said,”let’s get down to business! Hey! This is a gift from the Bureau chief. I’m giving it to you personally! This is considered a completed mission!”

Manager Lu said as he handed the long paper box to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei took it carefully and asked,””Manager Lu, what’s inside?”

“Why don’t you open it and see for yourself?” manager Lu said with a smile.

Xia ruofei nodded and opened the paper box. Inside was a piece of rice paper rolled into a cylinder.

Xia ruofei thought to himself,”could it be elder song’s calligraphy?” Why did the old general suddenly give me this?

He slowly unfurled the piece of rice paper with doubt in his heart. Then, his gaze suddenly froze, and a hint of surprise appeared in his eyes.

Because on this piece of paper, there were three large words “,” and at the back, there was elder song’s signature and seal. It looked like he had written it yesterday.

These three words were written in silver and iron, with force penetrating through the back of the paper. It gave people a feeling of Majesty. At the same time, Xia ruofei felt that it was slightly different from elder song’s words in the past. It lacked the murderous aura of the Army and had a sense of otherworldliness.

‘I’m afraid his mentality has changed after retirement ...’ Xia ruofei thought to himself.

Manager Lu saw Xia ruofei’s confusion and explained with a smile,””Xiao Rui went back yesterday morning. The chief asked about the details of your project. Then, the chief wrote this piece of calligraphy personally in the evening and asked me to send it to you. Xiao Xia, the chief really values you too much ...”

Manager Lu’s words were filled with envy. Xia ruofei also felt that this gift was too precious and too timely. He had never thought that elder song would take the initiative to inscribe words for the club.

Previously, when elder song wrote a piece of calligraphy for Tao Yuan company, Xia ruofei was already very surprised. However, that was a physical enterprise after all. Besides, the pharmaceutical factory was considered to be beneficial to the country and the people. Although Xia ruofei was very surprised when elder song gave that piece of calligraphy to an enterprise, it was completely different from this time.

This was a clubhouse project! Under normal circumstances, a leader of elder song’s level wouldn’t write an inscription for the club to avoid suspicion. However, elder song did it and didn’t hide his deep love for Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei was touched and said,””I really don’t deserve it! The chief is too good to me ...”

Manager Lu patted Xia ruofei’s shoulder and said with a smile,””Then you guys do well! Don’t let the chief down, especially remember what he told you before. Do things in an upright manner, be a clean person, and pay special attention to this clubhouse project!”

“Thank you for your reminder, manager Lu,” Xia ruofei said seriously.”I’ll always remember it!”

Xia ruofei carefully rolled up the inscription and put it back in the paper box.

Manager Lu chuckled and said,”alright, my mission is complete!” I still have to rush to the Chinese Political Consultative Conference soon, so I’ll take my leave first!”

“Manager Lu, please wait for a moment!” Xia ruofei quickly said.

After he finished speaking, he took the paper box and quickly walked back to the bedroom. He first put the paper box into the spirit map space, then picked up the two bags he had prepared before his afternoon nap from the table and walked back to the yard.

“Manager Lu, these two bottles of white wine are from my winery in Australia. They are limited edition!” Xia ruofei said,”please let the chief have a taste. It’s good for his health to drink one or two glasses of wine every day!”

“No problem!” Manager Lu agreed without hesitation.

If it was someone else who asked him to bring a gift to elder song, he would not have dared to agree no matter what. Others might not know elder song’s temper, but how could he not know?

However, if the person giving the gift was Xia ruofei, there would be no problem.

Xia ruofei then handed another bag to manager Lu and said,””This is a little gift from me to show my respect to you. The tea leaves are the best Da Hong Pao tea produced by our farm. You can keep it and drink it slowly. These two sets of Jade skin cream are for Auntie. I also prepared a bottle of sameirong white wine for you.”

“Woof! I’m here to beat up a tycoon!” Manager Lu joked,”Xiaoxia, are you trying to make me make a mistake?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Who are you?” The most loyal warrior of our party! Do you think I can corrupt them by roping them in? It’s just a little gift from junior to senior, please don’t reject it!”

Manager Lu was just joking. As long as Xia ruofei’s gift wasn’t as expensive as a few million Yuan, he would still dare to accept it. Most of the time, the Secretary’s Code of Conduct was on par with the chief.

“Then I won’t be polite!” Manager Lu took the bag with a smile and said,”thank you, ruofei! By the way, I also thank you on behalf of my lover!”

“You’re welcome!” Xia ruofei said,”tell aunty to let me know when you’re almost done. I’ll arrange for someone to send it over immediately!”

“Okay, okay ...” Manager Lu laughed and said,”ruofei, I’ll take my leave!”

Xia ruofei personally sent manager Lu to the front yard and watched as the Hongqi sedan left liuhai Lane. Then, he quickly returned to the middle yard. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

As soon as he entered the room, Xia ruofei couldn’t wait to take out elder song’s inscription from the spirit map space. He spread it out and admired it for a while. Then, he took out his phone and sent a message to his brothers ‘WeChat group: “Brothers, stop your work for a while and gather at the courtyard house!”
