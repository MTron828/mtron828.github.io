2975 One step ahead (1)

Seeing Shao Qingyang’s expression, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel like laughing.

Naturally, he did it on purpose.

Actually, when Xia ruofei arrived at the auction house, he had already noticed that many of the cultivators in the private rooms were like them. They had set up all sorts of shielding barriers. However, out of curiosity, he tried to test them out and realized that the barriers set up by these cultivators were generally average. In his eyes, they were full of loopholes. He could completely penetrate them with his spiritual power without anyone knowing.

This was also the reason why Xia ruofei had the confidence to give the set of boundary talismans to Luo Qingfeng so that he could save the situation when time was tight. The quality of Xia ruofei’s barrier was much higher than the various shielding barriers that almost all the sects had. The effect was also much better.

The same was true for the barrier that was set up in the room that Shao Qingyang and Luo Qingfeng were in. Xia ruofei only had to give it a try and he was able to break through the barrier.

He had only wanted to find out where Luo Qingfeng was, but he happened to hear the second half of their conversation.

Xia ruofei did this to give Shao Qingyang a little shock and make himself more mysterious in his eyes.

A young man whose cultivation level could not be seen through at all, who could ignore the barrier’s shielding, and who seemed to have more authority in his words than the sect leader, Luo Qingfeng, would naturally shock Shao Qingyang.

In addition, Xia ruofei had given a discount on Shao Qingyang’s conditions. He had only agreed to let him read the contents of the first volume, and he had even cut the time by half. The purpose was very simple – he did not want Shao Qingyang to feel that they were in a hurry to reach an agreement. He also did not want Shao Qingyang to feel that it was easy to make conditions.

Asking for a sky – High price and paying back on the spot was the logic of doing business.

After a brief moment of shock, Shao Qingyang turned to look at Luo Qingfeng.

“Sect leader Shao, this is my Junior Brother, Xia Tian,” Luo Qingfeng quickly said.”His words represent the star Seizer sect’s stance as well.”

Shao Qingyang muttered in his heart,’it seems like his status this summer is even higher than Luo Qingfeng’ s!’

A thought suddenly flashed through his mind. Could it be that this Xia Tian was the disciple of a hidden nascent soul old monster? If that was not the case, it would be difficult to explain Luo Qingfeng’s attitude toward him!

Thinking of this, Shao Qingyang couldn’t help but feel a chill down his spine, and he broke out in a cold sweat.

If this guess was true, then it meant that there was probably a Yuanying expert behind the star Seizer sect.

This was something that they had never heard of before!

The fallen leaf sect was the host of the auction, so Shao Qingyang was very familiar with the situation of all the auction items. The star Seizer sect, which had always kept a low profile, had brought out all the treasures that would make people’s eyes burn with envy. Whether it was the exquisitely designed spirit gathering talisman or the shockingly effective protective jade talisman, they were all considered small top – grade treasures. Especially such a high quality Qi gathering pill, it subverted the knowledge of many cultivators.

If all of this was because there was a nascent Soul Stage old monster behind the star Seizer sect, then it would all make sense.

Countless thoughts flashed through Shao Qingyang’s mind. At this time, Xia ruofei had already greeted Shao Qingyang with a smile,””Sect leader Shao, I’ve long heard about you!”

Shao Qingyang came back to his senses and quickly said,””Fellow Daoist Xia is truly young and promising! With such a young talent like fellow Daoist Xia, the Chinese cultivation world will be able to revive!”

“Sect leader Shao, you’re too kind! Xia Tian can’t afford that. ” Xia ruofei said neither humbly nor arrogantly. He continued to ask,”time is tight, so I’ll get straight to the point. Sect leader Shao, are you satisfied with our conditions?”

Shao Qingyang also knew that if he delayed any longer and allowed the handwritten copy of the spirit Vulture mountain to be auctioned first, he would not only completely offend the two people in front of him, but also, as Luo Qingfeng had said, he would not be able to stop the star picking sect’s “the true understanding of the glittering jewel” from being auctioned. Then, the cultivators who had spent a high price to bid for the spirit Vulture mountain’s remnant would also hate the host, the fallen leaves sect, to the core.

Besides, Xia ruofei’s offer was not bad.

The glittering jewel truth was quite famous in the world of cultivation. The spirit Vulture mountain only had the second volume, and there was a missing page, but they could still comprehend a lot of experience in the cultivation of spiritual power from it. This made the Aurous core stage cultivators of the spirit Vulture mountain much more powerful than cultivators of the same level in terms of spiritual power.

This time, as long as he agreed to auction off the star Seizer sect’s transcript of the “true understanding of the glittering jewel array,” he would be able to study the contents of the first volume for free.

To the falling leaves sect, there was basically no cost. The only disadvantage was that they would offend the spirit Vulture mountain.

But if he didn’t agree, he would undoubtedly offend even more people, especially the star Seizer sect.

In the past, the star Seizer sect’s strength was not much weaker than the spiritual Vulture mountain ‘s. Now that there was a suspected nascent soul old monster behind them, in Shao Qingyang’s mind, the star Seizer sect’s power was naturally higher than the spiritual Vulture mountain’ s.

If he had to choose between the two, Shao Qingyang would rather offend the spirit Vulture mountain than the star Seizer sect, which was becoming more and more mysterious in his eyes.

Furthermore, the first volume of the “glittering jewel Wonderland” would undoubtedly be a cultivation technique for Qi refining cultivators to train their spiritual power.

For a cultivator of Shao Qingyang’s level, an hour was more than enough for him to memorize the first volume of the glittering jewel true understanding.
