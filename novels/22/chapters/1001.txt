For the sake of his good friend’s health, Xia ruofei did not feel too bad even though he knew it was “using a cannon to kill a mosquito”.

Moreover, he had made a few more pills for Song Wei. It would be a waste if he did not use them. He might as well give them to song Rui.

Song Rui took the porcelain bottle as if he had found a treasure and carefully put it in his arms. He said with joy,””You’re indeed a good friend! Good brother!”

Xia ruofei rolled his eyes and said,”if you don’t serve the food soon, your good brother is going to starve to death ...”

Song Rui patted his head and said in embarrassment,””Blame me, blame me, I’ll get them to serve the dishes immediately!”

“Waiter!” Song Rui shouted.

The waiter waiting at the door immediately pushed the door open and asked,””Sir, what do you need?”

Song Rui’s dejection was swept away and he said in high spirits,””Inform the kitchen to serve the dishes! Hurry up!”

“Yes, sir!”

Song Rui then looked at Xia ruofei and asked,””Oh, ruofei, do you want to order a few more dishes?”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”no need. It’s just the two of us. Let’s make it simple.” By the way, you haven’t fully recovered from your cold yet, so let’s not drink at noon!”

“We have to listen to the doctor’s orders!” Song Rui laughed and said to the waiter,”take the wine away! Also, hurry up and serve the dishes!”

“Alright!”

......

In the liberation Square.

Song Wei and her best friend Zhuo Yiyi walked out of a Western restaurant and stood by the side of the road, waiting for a taxi.

Song Wei’s car was still in the southwest, and song Qiming was very strict with himself. Song Wei would never use her own car for personal use just because her father was a high – ranking provincial official. Therefore, she had been traveling with Zhuo Yiyi in Sanshan city for the past two days. They had mostly taken a taxi, and they would even take the public bus or subway occasionally.

It sounded a little unbelievable. The daughter of a Secretary of the provincial government and a member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee actually took the bus and subway when she went out. However, it was normal for this to happen in song Qiming’s house.

Song Qiming would only use his power when it concerned Song Wei’s safety. However, he would only do so within the rules.

The last time he sent Song Wei’s blood sample to Beijing for a test, song Qiming’s influence only made the flight wait for a few minutes. The departure time was not affected. All the expenses of the medical staff in the provincial People’s Hospital to Beijing were paid by song Qiming personally.

After a few days of fun at San Shan, Zhuo Yiyi was ready to go home. Hence, Song Wei accompanied her for lunch to send her off.

The two of them had been roommates for four years in University. They were also the only two girls in their entire year majoring in archeology, so they were naturally quite close.

The two of them stood at the taxi stop under the shade of a tree. Song Wei said reluctantly,””Yiyi, are you really not going to play for a few more days?”

Zhuo Yiyi giggled.”Little girl, could it be that you’ve taken a fancy to this young master? you can’t bear to see me leave?”

Song Wei rolled her eyes at Zhuo Yiyi and said,”Go to hell! You’re not serious!”

Zhuo Yiyi laughed out loud, then said mischievously,”I suddenly thought of a very interesting question ... If we become lesbian ... Will the boys in the archeology Department be heartbroken?”

They were the only two girls in the entire grade of archeology, and the rest were boys. If the only two girls ‘held hands’, it meant that the boys in archeology were failures!

Song Wei couldn’t help but burst out laughing and said,”What kind of nonsense are you thinking about all day long?”

“We’re just discussing it! “Did you put it into practice ...” Zhuo Yiyi said nonchalantly.”Let me make this clear first! This sister is a pure girl! I’m not interested in women!”

When Song Wei heard the word “pure girl,” she almost burst out laughing. She held her stomach and laughed while pointing at Zhuo Yiyi and said, “You’re such a weird guy ...”

Zhuo Yiyi blinked her big eyes and said,””Seriously, we haven’t even solved our personal problems yet! If you have any good boys, you must remember to introduce them to me!”

“Then you’re asking for too much!” Song Wei pouted and said. You, beauty Zhuo, are the goddess of all the boys! As long as he beckoned with his finger, there would probably be a strong row of pursuers!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“You’re speaking as if you’re not a goddess ...” Zhuo Yiyi mumbled.”Who asked the archeology Department to have more yang than Yin?” They don’t have a choice, okay?”

“That makes sense ... The guys in our Department are so pitiful ...” Song Wei pursed her lips and laughed.

The noon sun was very hot, and the road on this side of the square seemed to be melting. The two of them stood under the shade of the tree and talked for a while, but there was no empty taxi passing by.

However, the two of them weren’t in a hurry. Zhuo Yiyi’s flight was in the evening, and they weren’t in a hurry. They only needed to take a taxi to the hotel to pick up their luggage.

Moreover, the two girls always had endless things to talk about when they were together. In addition, they were about to part soon, so the two of them hoped to chat for a while longer.

However, while Song Wei and Zhuo Yiyi were chatting, they didn’t notice that on a motorcycle not far away, two young men wearing helmets were constantly looking in their direction.

The motorcycle slowly drove toward the two people on the side of the road, but the two of them didn’t realize that danger was approaching.

When the motorcycle passed by them, the person behind suddenly reached out and grabbed Song Wei’s bag. Then, the person in front stepped on the gas and the motorcycle sped up.

Song Wei did not expect a street racer to steal her bag in broad daylight. She was quite shocked and did not have any defense at all. When the motorcycle accelerated, she was even pulled by the bag strap and staggered.

Although Song Wei grabbed her bag subconsciously, she could not win against the biker due to the momentum of the motorcycle. She felt the weight in her hand lighten and her bag was taken away.

At this moment, Song Wei had yet to react, but Zhuo Yiyi reacted even faster. She shouted,””This is robbery!”

Then, he ran after the motorcycle.

“Yiyi, forget it ...” Song Wei came back to her senses and said.

However, Zhuo Yiyi had already run a few meters away. It was as if she had not heard Song Wei’s words as she continued to chase after the motorcycle.

Song Wei did not plan to chase after them. Although she did not expect the public security in Sanshan city to be more chaotic than she had imagined, she was still the daughter of the Secretary of the municipal government. Since these two guys had stolen her, there was no way she could escape.

With song Qiming’s words, there was no way such a petty thief could hide.

However, Zhuo Yiyi had already given chase, and the other party was two strong men! Song Wei was worried that Zhuo Yiyi would be at a disadvantage, so she didn’t even have the time to call her and quickly chased after her.

......

At the entrance of the Shangri – La hotel, Xia ruofei and song Rui, who had eaten and drunk to their heart’s content, had just stepped out of the hotel when they heard someone shouting “robbery” not far away.

Xia ruofei turned his head and saw a motorcycle speeding along the road south of the square in their direction. The person in the back of the motorcycle would turn his head back from time to time.

The man was holding a handbag that was obviously designed for women.

Behind the motorcycle, a girl in a T – Shirt and jeans was running wildly.

“F * ck! What’s the situation?” Song Rui couldn’t help but call out.

The motorcycle was moving very fast and was about to reach Xia ruofei and song Rui’s location.

The motorcycle was on the opposite Lane, and there was a guardrail in the middle.

To Xia ruofei, it was not difficult to stop him directly. It was just the width of a road. He could fly over it with a light tap. However, this would inevitably be a little shocking.

Xia ruofei looked left and right and did not find anything useful, so he called out,””Song Rui, take off your shoes!”

“Ah?” Song Rui was stunned and didn’t react for a moment.

Xia ruofei grabbed song Rui’s right leg and shook it lightly. His shoe fell off his foot.

Xia ruofei did not wait for the shoe to land on the ground. He did a ball – like action and threw song Rui’s shoe up about half a meter. Then, he turned sideways and kicked song Rui’s shoe with his right foot.

A volley shot!

The shoe flew out with a Swoosh, drawing a parabola across the middle of the road, and then fell rapidly.

Just as the motorcycle passed by, the shoe happened to fly there and hit the rider’s helmet ...
