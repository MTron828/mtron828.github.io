Although the exploration team did not have a clear leader, Xia ruofei was undoubtedly the leader now.

After everyone had changed their oxygen supply modules, Xia ruofei said,””Let’s start landing on the moon! Brother Chen and I will lead the way, while elder Shen, elder yang, and elder mu will bring up the rear. The four Qi condensation cultivators will be in the middle. Does everyone think this arrangement is acceptable?” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“No problem!” Chen Xuan was the first to speak up.”Let’s do as brother Xia says!”

Seeing that the young sect leader had agreed, Shen tianfang naturally did not have any objections. Furthermore, he would not be at a disadvantage even if he were to cover the retreat. After all, everything down there was still unknown. Thus, he said very readily,””I agree!”

Since the two golden core cultivators of the first heaven society had no objections, the rest of the people naturally didn’t have any objections either. Everyone expressed their agreement to this arrangement.

Hence, Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan exchanged a look. Then, they stepped lightly on the deck at the same time. The two of them flew over the side of the ship and landed on the surface of the moon.

The moon’s gravity was only about one – sixth of earth ‘s, and ordinary people could be as light as a swallow on the moon. People who had watched Apollo program – related movies knew that when the Americans landed on the moon, even though they looked clumsy in their bulky spacesuits, they could easily pick out the level of Earth’s sports Masters. As a result, the astronauts preferred to jump like kangaroos on the moon’s surface.

Ling Qingxue, mu Jianfei, Yu Xin ‘er, and Xu yurou followed behind Xia ruofei and the others. They jumped out of the black Phoenix flying ship and landed on the surface of the moon.

Shen tianfang and the other two did not waste any time and quickly left the black Phoenix flying ship.

Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan were the first to land.

After the two of them landed on the surface of the moon, they jumped more than a meter high and took another step forward with inertia, leaving two pairs of clear footprints on the moon.

Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan stood still and turned around to wait for the others.

Looking at the footprints he had left, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””I suddenly thought of Benjamin Armstrong’s famous quote.”

“A small step for me is a big step for humans?” Chen Xuan asked with a smile.

“Yup!” Xia ruofei said,”I’m thinking, if humans were to land on the moon again in the future and come to the crater on the back of the moon, would they be scared to see these footprints ...”

As sound could not be transmitted in a vacuum, everyone was communicating through the radio. Naturally, everyone could hear Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan’s conversation clearly.

Elder mu Hua of the surging waves sect, Shen tianfang, and Yang Liu had just jumped off the Flying Ship. They had just landed on the surface of the moon and left behind a pair of footprints.

When mu Hua heard this, he laughed and said,”the dust on the moon is so thick. The footprints will soon disappear!” How can it scare people?”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”elder mu, you may not know this.” On the moon, footprints would not disappear easily. The first time that Americans landed on the moon was in 1969, which had been decades since then. However, the footprints left by Armstrong still existed to this day, and there were almost no changes. If you’re interested, we can go around to the other side of the moon to take a look when we return!”

The moon was much smaller than earth. At its fastest speed, the black Phoenix flying ship could circle the moon once in an hour. Therefore, it was not particularly troublesome to visit the historical footprints. However, everyone was now focused on unraveling the ultimate secret of the rising Dragon Token, so they naturally did not have the mood to visit it.

After Xia ruofei finished speaking, even the elder of the flying flower Valley, Yang Liu, was very interested. She couldn’t help but ask,””Why is that? Could it be that the footprints will solidify?”

Yu xiner had a series of education experiences in the secular world. She even had a master’s degree, so she naturally knew some common sense questions. When she heard an elder from her own sect ask such a trivial question, she couldn’t help but be a little stunned. Before Xia ruofei could reply, she hurriedly explained,”Martial uncle Liu, there is no air or water on the moon, so there will be no wind or rain. The dust on the moon’s surface will not be washed away by rain or blown away by wind. As long as no one destroys it, the footprint will never disappear.”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”It’s not that absolute. The moon will occasionally shake slightly, just like the earthquakes on earth. However, the magnitude of the tremors is very small. It basically won’t affect the footprints. In addition, solar wind and cosmic particle flow could also cause wear and tear on the moon’s surface, but one millimeter of wear and tear would take tens of millions of years, so it could be ignored. Therefore, unless someone deliberately damaged the footprints, or a meteorite or asteroid happened to hit the location of the footprints, it would naturally be destroyed. Of course, the probability of that happening is too small. ”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but roll her eyes at Xia ruofei.””Xin ‘er, this guy is just bickering!”

“But there’s nothing wrong with it!” Yu xiner laughed. The logic behind it is very strong!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’m just joking!” Everyone, get your spirits up! The token’s Secret is right in front of us, whether or not we can solve it will depend on us!”

“Fellow Daoist Xia, I think the key is still the eight spots of light that we’ve all seen. They should be the key to solving the secret and opening the door!” Shen tianfang said as he walked forward.

The few people who had landed on the moon that day had all passed the music selection. Everyone had experienced that wonderful illusion and clearly remembered that in this Valley, there were spots of light that lit up one after another. They lit up three times in total, and then a gourd – shaped instrument made of ceramic appeared. Then, the door appeared. They could even feel the drooling spirit Qi through the door and see the beautiful scenery that was like a paradise.

The most direct way to understand it was naturally the eight light spots in the music illusion. They were demonstrating the way to open the door to the secret realm for everyone, and they were even demonstrated three times in a row.

Xia ruofei nodded.”My suggestion is to use your spiritual power. Follow the order shown in the illusion and stab at the eight spots of light. See if there will be any reaction.”

“Agreed!” Mu Hua nodded. Let’s stand on the outside and use our spiritual power to control it from a distance. We’ll see if it works so that we can avoid danger in time!”

Yang Liu and Chen Xuan also expressed their agreement. With that, the five golden core cultivators were of the same opinion.

“In order to ensure smooth operation, I suggest that it should be done by one person,” said Xia ruofei.

For a golden core stage cultivator, it was not a particularly difficult thing to use their mental power to probe the eight positions according to the order of the illusionary realm demonstration. At least, the five of them could do it.

Therefore, no one had any objections to Yingluo’s smooth completion of the task as a few people working together. Since the ability could be achieved, why would they deliberately increase the difficulty?

“Since no one has any objections, I’ll give it a try first?” Xia ruofei said,”if it doesn’t work, I’ll ask the other fellow Daoists to help!”

Shen tianfang was the intermediate stage golden core cultivator with the highest cultivation in the expedition team. He had planned to do it himself, but Xia ruofei suggested to try it out before he could say anything. This way, Shen tianfang could not reject her, or it would be too offensive.

Shen Tian said with relief,”there’s no harm in letting him try first. If he really can’t do it, I’ll make my move.”

As for Chen Xuan and the rest, their cultivation levels were about the same as Xia ruofei ‘s. At least, mu Hua and Yang Liu thought so. Chen Xuan knew that he had been left far behind by Xia ruofei.

Therefore, they naturally did not have any objections.

Hence, Xia ruofei adjusted his breathing and adjusted his condition to the best. Then, he decisively released eight wisps of spiritual power to explore the position of the light spot in the illusion ...
