2011 Checks and balances_3

Xia ruofei left the gun to Monica and got out of the car with his bare hands. When facing ordinary people, Xia ruofei did not need a gun.

It was very dark in the bushes at night, but Xia ruofei could see very clearly. He dodged the thorns with agility and quickly made his way out.

At this time, the car opposite them had already slowly turned into this small road.

This road was narrow and overgrown with weeds. They had been in the bushes for a long time, but no car had passed by. Now, a car had come. There were basically two possibilities. One was that lui hai had arrived, and the other was that the German family had sent people to chase them here.

The second possibility could not be ruled out. Perhaps Monica or Rousey had a tracking device on them. Xia ruofei had not checked them carefully just now.

Xia ruofei looked over and felt a little relieved. Although the headlights of the car were a little glaring, he could still see the situation inside with his super eyesight.

There were four people in the Ford SUV, all of whom were Asian. The person sitting on the left side of the back row also looked like the person in the photo Li Yifu had sent.

......

In the off – Road vehicle, a strong man in the front passenger seat turned around and said,Big brother hai, who are we going to meet tonight You actually personally rushed over from Milan overnight! And this meeting place was too strange! He actually chose such a desolate place in the middle of the night!

Big brother hai was a brawny man in his forties with a full beard. He looked a little rough, but his bright eyes showed a hint of cleverness from time to time. It was obvious that he was not as simple and honest as he looked.

Brother hai was lui hai, the leader of the Italy branch of the Hong sect. Of course, he was not a boorish man. Otherwise, how could he have taken such an important position

Lui hai said lightly,Ali, don’t ask what you shouldn’t ask. Don’t you know the rules Also, the guests we’re meeting tonight are very distinguished, so be more alert and don’t make any trouble! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

I understand, big brother hai! Ah li nodded.

Lui hai was still in a daze. Two hours ago, he received a call from Li Yifu and received such a task. Li Yifu’s serious tone had left a deep impression on him.

Li Yifu asked lui hai to obey Xia Tian unconditionally and to respect him as much as he respected Li Yifu.

Although lui hai was confused, he still took three of his best underlings and rushed to Turin from Milan.

Actually, it wasn’t just ah li. Even lui hai was curious about this distinguished guest.

The car was getting closer and closer to the standard position on Google Maps when a figure suddenly appeared 20 to 30 meters in front of the car. The driver quickly stepped on the brakes and finally stopped the car steadily just as the car was about to hit the person.

Before the driver could scold him, the man had already walked to the side of the car and asked,Is lui hai here

Ah li immediately frowned and shouted,impudent! Big brother Hai’s name is you ...

Ah li, shut up! Lui hai had seen the man’s face clearly and knew that he was Mr. Xia, the man Li Yifu had been talking about. Therefore, lui hai stopped ah li, opened the door and got out of the car ...
