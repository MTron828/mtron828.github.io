Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue were not married, so there was no reason for her to give in. Although it seemed like an unfair victory in this situation, there was no such thing as gentleness, humility, and humility in love. Perhaps this was destined?

Song Wei had been giving herself such psychological hints, and it was indeed effective. She felt much better.

“How long do you want to hug me?” Song Wei asked softly.

“I’ll hug you until you promise me that you won’t run away anymore ...” Xia ruofei whispered in Song Wei’s ear.

“Rascal!” Song Wei said coyly.

However, she was secretly happy and said,””Let me go! I’m not leaving ...” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Xia ruofei let go of her but he turned Song Wei’s body around. They were now facing each other.

Song Wei panicked and avoided Xia ruofei’s gaze.

After a long while, Song Wei sighed and asked,””What about Ling Qingxue?”

Xia ruofei’s expression darkened.””Song Wei, give me some time ...”

“I’m not forcing you, so don’t feel pressured ...”Song Wei quickly said.

“I know, it’s me who can’t get over this hurdle in my heart!” Xia ruofei said in a low voice,”and ... We have to face this problem!”

“I’m sorry ...” Song Wei lowered her head and sobbed.

“Why are you saying sorry!” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and said,”we didn’t expect this situation. It was a complete accident ...”

“If I didn’t force you to get rid of the miasma in advance, this wouldn’t have happened. I was too stubborn ...” Song Wei said.

Xia ruofei shook his head and said,”actually ... I’ve underestimated the strength of the peach blossom miasma. Now that I think about it, even if we had all broken through at that time, we wouldn’t have had much confidence in dealing with the peach blossom miasma in that situation. If the battle situation was unfavorable, my only choice would be to hide in the island in my sea of consciousness. Perhaps the result would be the same.”

“You don’t have to comfort me ...” Song Wei said dejectedly,”we ... After we cultivated like that, we each broke through a level, and then the peach blossom miasma was swept away, right? Your previous judgment was correct. It was caused by my willfulness ...”

Xia ruofei patted Song Wei’s hand and said,””Since it has already happened, don’t think too much about it ... I’ll say the same thing again, give me some time, I’ll handle it!”

Song Wei bit her lower lip and thought for a long time. Then, she raised her head and asked,””You ... Love Ling Qingxue very much, don’t you?” he asked.

Xia ruofei’s body trembled and he said in a low voice,””She’s my first love, we ...”

Song Wei looked into Xia ruofei’s eyes and said,””You don’t have to say anymore, I know ... First love is very beautiful! Furthermore, Ling Qingxue is such a good girl. She loves you with all her heart and soul. This is so unfair to her ...”

Xia ruofei sighed and said,””It’s all too sudden. I’m a little confused right now. I hope you can understand!”

“I understand! I’ve never blamed you. If I want to blame someone ... I can only blame myself!” Song Wei laughed at herself and said,”I’m the shameless third party. And ... Before this happened, I already liked you! I think ... You’re not so slow that you didn’t notice it at all, right?”

Xia ruofei smiled awkwardly but did not say anything.

Song Wei lowered her head and was silent for a while. Then, she seemed to have made up her mind. She looked up at Xia ruofei’s eyes and said,”Ruofei, let me give you a suggestion to solve this matter!”
