“Thank you, Mr. Yang!” Wu Liqian also said.

“You’re welcome! You’re welcome! It’s no trouble at all!” Yang Wanxin chuckled and said,”President Xia is a big customer of our airport. It’s our duty to provide you with the best service!”

Wu Liqian handed the itinerary to the flight attendant and looked at Xia ruofei strangely. She could not understand why Xia ruofei had become a big client of the airport. Did his company have any business dealings with the airport?

Could it be that the airline’s side dishes were all Taoyuan vegetables? Wasn’t this too extravagant? Besides, the production capacity of Tao Yuan farm couldn’t reach that! Wu Liqian couldn’t understand.

Xia ruofei did not explain too much to Wu Liqian. The staff on duty quickly completed the upgrade procedures and stamped Wu Liqian’s boarding pass with a special stamp for the upgrade.

After that, the check – in staff took the initiative to arrange for a VIP ground service and led Wu Liqian directly through the empty VIP passage to go through the security check. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Wu Liqian stood in front of the yellow prohibition line and said to Xia ruofei,””Ruofei, thank you ... For this!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sister Qian, you don’t have to be so formal with me. You don’t have to think about anything. Just focus on your training when you go to the capital. Don’t worry about things in Changping!”

Wu Liqian opened her mouth and hesitated for a moment before saying,””Ruofei, you have to be more careful when dealing with Liu haojun. He doesn’t play his cards according to common sense, and his style is very overbearing ...”

“Yes, I will!” Xia ruofei nodded as if he had learned something.

Wu Liqian rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,”Alright! Don’t play dumb with me, I know you didn’t take it seriously!”

“How can that be? I’ll definitely remember County Head Wu’s instructions!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“You’re so glib!” Wu Liqian glanced at Xia ruofei and said,”I’m going in. Remember, don’t be impulsive. Think twice before you act!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”don’t worry, sister Qian!” I will definitely remember your words! Oh right, I heard that Liu haojun threatened you just now. Don’t worry, I have a few brothers in Beijing, and they’re no worse than Liu haojun! If you have any problems, you can go to them directly. They will definitely do their best to help you! I’ll send the contact information to your WeChat later!”

Wu Liqian’s heart felt warm and she said,”yes!” I know ...”

She couldn’t bear to see Xia ruofei for two months. She couldn’t help but say,”Ruofei, if you’re going to the capital, remember to come and find me!”

“I will!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ll be going there soon. Please come to my house then!”

“Your family ...” Wu Liqian was stunned for a moment, then she giggled and said,”I almost forgot that you have a big rich man’s courtyard in Jing city. I’ll remember what you said. If you dare to forget, don’t blame me for not being polite to you!”

“No, it won ‘t!” Xia ruofei smiled.”Sister Qian, it’s almost time. You should go in ...”

The two of them waved goodbye at the airport. Xia ruofei watched as Wu Liqian’s figure disappeared from the VIP waiting room. Then, he turned around and walked out.

At the parking lot.

Xu Yougang’s van was no longer in the parking lot. He must have left the airport with Liu haojun.

Xia ruofei didn’t call Xu Yougang again. Anyway, the task had been handed over to them. He didn’t ask about the process but only the results.

Xia ruofei found his Knight XV and left the airport.

Since it was already two in the afternoon, Xia ruofei did not make another trip to the city. Instead, he returned to Taoyuan farm.

……

On the airport Highway, Liu haojun’s crown car was driving smoothly. His expression was a little ferocious.

With his temper, Xia ruofei had disrespected him time and time again. He would have used all means to deal with Xia ruofei.

However, Liu haofan’s words made him waver.

Even though he didn’t care about them, just Zhao Yongjun, song Rui, and the others were enough to make Liu haojun afraid, especially Zhao Yongjun, who was very famous in the circle. Although his family background wasn’t as prominent as song Rui and Liu haofan, Liu haojun didn’t dare to look down on him at all.

In fact, Zhao Yongjun, song Rui, and the others had formed a strong circle of connections. This circle supported Xia ruofei, so Liu haojun could not use his familiar methods on Xia ruofei.

However, it was impossible for him to swallow this.

Liu haojun was the kind of person who would seek revenge for the smallest grievance. The superior environment he grew up in had led to a flaw in his personality. He could not tolerate others being disrespectful to him.

Liu haojun’s hand unconsciously tapped on the armrest of his chair. He couldn’t think of a reliable way to deal with Xia ruofei at the moment. In the end, he returned to the project. Liu haojun dreamed of getting that project and turning it into a shining achievement.

Therefore, Liu haojun couldn’t help but think of Liu haofan’s suggestion.

After much consideration, he finally took out his phone and dialed a number.

As soon as the call connected, Liu haojun said enthusiastically,””Uncle fan! I’m haojun! How have you been recently? It’s like this, I have something to report to you. I don’t know if it’s convenient for you ... Okay, okay! Then I’ll come to your office now ... Uh – huh! I won’t leave until we meet!”

After hanging up the phone, Liu haojun said to the driver,””Change to the provincial government!”

“Okay, Secretary Liu!” The driver replied respectfully.

Liu haojun and the driver did not notice that they had been watched for a long time.

Xu Yougang and the other three used two cars. One was the inconspicuous van that Xia ruofei had seen, and the other was a black Jetta. The two cars had been modified by them. The van was large and had a lot of equipment.

Xu Yougang’s tracking skills were very good. They did not follow him closely, but followed him from a distance with a few cars between them. They also changed positions from time to time to avoid being noticed by the experienced drivers.

Liu haojun’s car was supposed to enter the ramp and exit the highway when they arrived at Changping exit. However, the car did not slow down at the exit, nor did it change lanes. Instead, it drove straight ahead and continued in the direction of the city.

“Wang Chong, record this down!” Xu Yougang turned around and said. At 14:38 p.m., The target did not return to Changping County as planned. He is currently driving in the direction of the main city. ”

“Understood!” Wang Chong immediately jotted down the information in his notebook.
