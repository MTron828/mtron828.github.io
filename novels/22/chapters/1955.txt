“This plane was given to me by the chairman of the Kyushu group, Li Yifu.” Xia ruofei said,”but it’s still under the Kyushu group’s name. It’s just for my long – term use.”

“I see ...” Feng Jing said.

There was still a difference between giving away an airplane and giving away the right to use an airplane.

However, Xia ruofei’s next words made her gasp.

Xia ruofei said,”so, Captain Liu and the others are actually all employees of the Kyushu group. All the expenses incurred by this plane are borne by the Kyushu group. In fact, I only have the right to use it.”

‘That’s all ...’ Feng Rao and the others couldn’t help but curse in their hearts.

Wasn’t this even better than giving it away for free? Even if an ordinary person was given an airplane, he would not be able to afford it. Even if the plane did not fly for a day, the daily rental and maintenance costs generated by the airport were not something that ordinary people could afford.

But now, the Kyushu group had covered all the expenses, and Xia ruofei could use it at any time without having to pay a single cent. There was actually such a good thing in the world.

Could it be that Xia ruofei was really the illegitimate son of the chairman of the Kyushu group, Li Yifu? The age didn’t seem to match, right? Li Yifu is quite old ... Feng Jing couldn’t help but Mutter in her heart.

Xia ruofei saw Feng Jing’s strange look and knew that she must have misunderstood.

He didn’t know whether to laugh or cry as he said,”don’t look at me like that!” “The reason why Mr. Li Yifu gave me an airplane is because there are some hidden reasons. Anyway, it’s not what you think. Let’s put it this way ... The help I gave him is no less valuable than an airplane ...”

Feng Jing could understand Xia ruofei’s explanation.

She knew that Xia ruofei had good medical skills. He was the one who had developed the jaded skin cream and the heart – nourishing soup.

Although Xia ruofei was being tactful, Feng Jing guessed that Xia ruofei had used his medical skills to help Li Yifu. After all, world – Class tycoons valued their lives very much. If he really did save their lives, what was a plane worth?

Although Feng Rao’s guess was wrong, it was not far from the truth. Xia ruofei did not save Li Yifu’s life, but it was equivalent to giving him a Second Life. In the eyes of cultivators, how could money in the secular world compare to the help and support on the road to cultivation? Moreover, Xia ruofei was Li Yifu’s grand uncle – Master, so it was only natural for him to be filial to his elders.

Xia ruofei said,”Alright, alright. Let’s not waste time here. Let’s get on the plane!”

“Let’s go! Let’s go up and take a look!” Pang Hao shouted.

If it was a rented plane, no one would be too interested. After all, it was someone else ‘s. Although the rent was more expensive, it could only be used once or twice. Even if they rented it again, it might not be this plane anymore.

However, this was Xia ruofei ‘s’ private plane ‘, so it was a different feeling.

The group boarded the plane one after another, with Xia ruofei at the back. Before he stepped onto the ramp, he turned back and asked,””By the way, have you packed the things that Tao Yuan farm sent over?”

Before Xia ruofei set off today, he had already packed all the auction items into boxes and asked ye Lingyun to personally escort them to the airport with three cars and more than ten veteran soldiers.

After all, the overall value of these items was quite high. The key was that the press conference would be held tomorrow. Xia ruofei did not want any accidents to happen during the delivery process.

“Yes!” Liu An replied immediately.”They’re all in the plane. According to your request, we’ve installed a freezer. The boxes 01 and 02 are already in the freezer!”

Xia ruofei placed the truffle and one – Head abalone, which needed to be frozen, in two thermal containers. They had been kept fresh with ice during the transportation process. After they were sent to the plane, they were directly placed in the freezer.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”that’s good!” Captain Liu, let’s leave as soon as possible!”

“Alright, director Xia!” Liu An accompanied Xia ruofei to board the plane.”The airport usually gives priority to small business jets like us. I also contacted the air traffic control department yesterday. As long as we close the doors and get ready, we won’t have to wait too long!”

After everyone boarded the plane, the stewardess retracted the accommodation ladder and closed the cabin door.

In the cabin, Feng Jing, Dong Yun, and pang Hao were still looking around the plane with great interest, occasionally letting out sounds of praise. Even Dong Yun, who had a rather cold personality, revealed a look of envy.

This plane could have been customized by a Mexico tycoon, but the order was later canceled, and Li Yifu bought it. Although Li Yifu was worried about the difference in Eastern and Western aesthetics, so he made some changes to the interior design, he was sure that he made better changes. It would not be lower than the original Mexico tycoon’s standard.

Therefore, the interior of the plane could be said to be extremely luxurious. The entire cabin was decorated with warm colors, and the decoration was made of mahogany with a strong contrast, giving a very modern feeling. In addition, some of the more prominent parts were decorated with red sandalwood strips, which made it even more high – grade.

There were a total of four single seats in the front area, all of which were handmade leather sofas from the aeristio brand. The color matching matched the double – colored leather ceiling and the leather walls of the side cabin.

The metal part glowed with a silver light. The floor was covered with a hand – made Italy wool carpet, which made it look noble and luxurious.

The lights on the top of the cabin emitted a soft light, making the entire cabin space seem even more dreamy.

“It’s so good to be rich ...” Pang Hao couldn’t help but Mutter,”Chairman, I saw a single room at the back of the plane! There’s even a double bed ...”

Xia ruofei looked at pang Hao’s perverted eyes and knew that he must be thinking of something like “vibration” in his mind. He couldn’t help but glare at him and said,””Do you want to go up and lie down? It’s only two hours to fly to Hong Kong from here, is it enough for you to sleep?”

When pang Hao heard Xia ruofei’s unfriendly tone, he quickly waved his hand and said,””I’m just envious, I don’t have that kind of intention! Brother Fei, I’m in the wrong, okay?”

“Director pang, the chairman is inviting you to go to bed with him ...” Feng Jing said with a smile.

Xia ruofei almost vomited blood. The air stewardess beside him who was preparing for take – off was also trying very hard to hold back her laughter.

Xia ruofei said,”everyone, pick a seat!” Put on your seat belt, the plane will take off soon!”

There were four single – seater sofas in the front area. Xia ruofei’s group also had four people. Everyone chose their own seats and sat down.

Pang Hao’s body almost sank into the sofa. He let out a comfortable moan,””This is so enjoyable ... When I have money, I’ll have it too ...”

“You want to buy a plane like this?” Feng Rao asked with a smile.

Pang Hao’s expression froze for a moment before he said,””I want to buy a sofa of the same style and sit on it every day at home!”

“Hahaha!” Xia ruofei and the others burst out laughing.

At this moment, two air stewardesses came over to serve everyone. They brought red wine and drinks. At the same time, he brought the menu.

“We can even order food?” Pang Hao said.

“There aren’t many choices. Everyone can choose.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”but don’t eat too much. I’m guessing that after the plane lands, Chairman MA will treat us to a meal!”

“Then I’ll save my stomach for a big meal!” Pang Hao said.

“As you wish!” Xia ruofei shrugged.

Having said that, the four of them still looked at the menu and each ordered a meal.

At this moment, the plane trembled slightly and began to push outward. Captain Liu An’s announcement was also heard from the cabin.
