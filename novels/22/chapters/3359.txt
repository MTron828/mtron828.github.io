Ling Qingxue nodded and said,”Oh!” I know ...”

Suddenly, she was stunned. She stared at Xia ruofei with wide eyes and said in a trembling voice,””So, you ... You’re really RUO Fei?”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry as he said,”silly girl, are you still doubting my identity?” Please, is there such a realistic inner demon? Let’s hurry up and find the yellow jade essence, we shouldn’t waste any more time!”

Ling Qingxue’s delicate body trembled slightly, as if she had just confirmed that the person in front of her was indeed her boyfriend and not the demon in her heart that had appeared in the illusion.

She looked at Xia ruofei with her eyes wide open and threw herself into his arms. After feeling his familiar breath and warm embrace, she sobbed,””RUO Fei, I ... I’m really scared. I’m suddenly the only one left after entering the secret realm. I’ve been looking for you everywhere, but I couldn’t find you ...”

Xia ruofei gently patted Ling Qingxue’s back and said,””It’s fine now! He was fine now! Now that we’ve finally met up, I’ll be behind you, so you won’t be in any danger!”

Xia ruofei continued,”Qingxue, Speaking of which, you were able to enter the third level of the trial Pagoda in such a short time. Your performance is already very outstanding!” I was worried that you would encounter danger in the Tower of Trials! Finally, the heavens have blessed you. Not only are you not in danger, but your results are also so good!”

Ling Qingxue snuggled into Xia ruofei’s arms and said,””I don’t know either. I was muddleheaded until I reached the third level of the Tower of Trials. However, just as I entered the third floor, I encountered a very realistic illusion. I almost fell into it and couldn’t get out. Later, I received a mission to kill a beginner – Level Mirage beast, but I only killed one. When I met the second one, I suddenly changed my environment and came to this wasteland. I thought I had fallen into the Mirage beast’s illusion! I couldn’t find the way out in this wasteland at all, and I searched for more than ten hours. Just now, I saw that piece of Topaz lying on the ground, so I dug it out out out of curiosity. I didn’t expect you to appear so soon ...”

Xia ruofei nodded.”No wonder ... It’s a good thing you picked up that piece of Topaz. Otherwise, it would be difficult for me to locate you accurately!”

Xia ruofei had found more than 2000 pieces of yellow jade essence on the fourth level of the trial Pagoda. Naturally, he knew that most of them were buried underground. There were a few pieces of yellow jade essence that were half – exposed above the ground, but they were rare. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

There was only one yellow jade essence in the area where Ling Qingxue was located. The probability of finding the yellow jade essence by chance was very low, and it just so happened that the yellow jade essence was half – exposed to the ground, so the probability was even slimmer.

However, Ling Qingxue had encountered it and had even picked up the yellow jade essence.

It had to be said that there seemed to be a mysterious force that determined that Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue would meet here today.

Ling Qingxue asked curiously,”RUO Fei, what’s going on?” Why was I teleported to the fourth floor before I even completed the mission on the third floor? Why is it that I’m still in the same training space as you?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it’s a long story!” We don’t have much time, so let’s talk while we walk!”

“En!” Ling Qingxue nodded her head.

After regrouping with Xia ruofei, Ling Qingxue felt at ease. Ever since she had entered the secret realm and parted ways with Xia ruofei, she had a strong sense of danger. Her heart had been hanging in the air, but now she could finally relax.

Xia ruofei reached out and grabbed Ling Qingxue’s flying sword. He smiled and said,””Put away the flying sword first, we’ll set off now!”

After Ling Qingxue put away her flying sword, Xia ruofei immediately summoned the bent Frost Flying sword. Then, he gently put his arm around Ling Qingxue’s slender waist and the two of them stepped onto the bent Frost Flying sword.

He silently activated his sword technique. The qushuang flying sword instantly rose into the air. However, it was not flying at a high altitude. It was basically sticking to the ground and adjusting its altitude according to the ups and downs of the terrain. The two of them rode their flying swords and flew towards the direction that Xia ruofei had chosen.

Ling Qingxue was only in the Qi refining stage and did not know how to fly on a sword. She also did not know that in the Tower of Trials, the original sword technique for sword flight would be ineffective and there was no way to fly on a sword. So when she saw Xia ruofei carrying her on a sword to fly, she was not too surprised.

After all, it was not her first time flying on a sword. Xia ruofei had carried her on a flying sword several times.

On the way, Xia ruofei briefly explained to Ling Qingxue how he had broken the record and completed the trial mission. He had also received the reward of being able to be teleported to the same trial space as his companions.

Of course, Xia ruofei did not mention that it was his second time choosing this reward, nor did he mention that he had killed Shen tianfang, who had been sent to the same trial space on the third level of the Tower of Trials.

Xia ruofei did not want Ling Qingxue to worry. At the same time, he did not want her to come into contact with the dark side of the cultivation world.

When the two of them were flying together, their speed would be somewhat affected.

About ten minutes later, Xia ruofei flew to a place where the Topaz was buried.

He lowered his flying sword but did not rush to dig. Instead, he took out the time array flag from the spirit map space and skillfully set up a time array around the position.
