Chapter 1639: The power of the array (2)

Then, he started to regret his decision. He would rather chat with Xia ruofei until dawn than stay in a room alone.

However, he soon realized that he wasn’t as afraid as before.

Although what had happened in the array was still vivid in his mind, he didn’t feel the chill he had just felt.

It was as if this matter had happened a long time ago.

People who had watched horror movies should have experience. If they were timid, they would feel scared at night after watching it for a day or two. They would always feel that there was a ghost quietly watching them from the bed or outside the window. Even the slightest movement or shadow would make them suspicious, and they couldn’t help but think of the plot in the movie.

However, as time passed, this feeling of fear would gradually fade. Perhaps the plot of the horror film was still fresh in his memory, but he would no longer feel that kind of fear.

Song Rui’s current state was like this. He shook his head in puzzlement and tried to walk towards the first courtyard.

This was the old courtyard house. In addition, it was the darkest time before dawn. Walking in the courtyard would definitely make one feel uncomfortable. However, song Rui found that he was not so afraid anymore.

He was still in disbelief when he walked to his room under the light of the street lamp, pushed the door open, and sat down by the bed.

Song Rui wasn’t stupid. He knew that this change must have something to do with Xia ruofei calling him out. However, he couldn’t figure out why he suddenly became so bold after a few minutes of meaningless conversation with Xia ruofei.

Fortunately, song Rui was a big – hearted person. Since he couldn’t understand, he might as well not think about it. He quickly washed up and fell asleep.

He slept all the way until late in the afternoon. After he woke up, song Rui felt refreshed. The nightmare he was worried about before going to bed did not happen at all.

Only then did he believe that he seemed to have gotten rid of that huge psychological shadow.

......

For the next few days, Xia ruofei had nothing to do.

Zhao Yongjun and the others were keeping an eye on Liu haofan’s situation, so he didn’t have to worry at all.

In fact, he had already done everything he could. All he could do now was wait.

Hence, Xia ruofei contacted Song Wei again and cultivated with her in the courtyard house twice.

Because she ate the heart concentrating grass, Song Wei’s cultivation talent seemed to have improved greatly. Especially when she was cultivating the absolute beginning Heart Sutra, this talent was even more obvious.

This was because the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” itself required the assistance of mental power. The ultimate state was that the soul frequencies of the two cultivators were completely synchronized.

After two rounds of cultivation, Song Wei’s cultivation had completely stabilized at the peak of Qi disciple Level 2.

She could clearly feel the bottleneck to the third level of the Qi refining stage.

Just like the last time, Xia ruofei did not rush to help Song Wei break through. He continued to cultivate step by step to make her Foundation as solid as possible.

However, Xia ruofei estimated that even if she did not deliberately break through, the next time they trained together, or at most the next time, Song Wei should be able to enter the third level of the Qi refining stage.

In this way, they were one step closer to completely eliminating the peach blossom miasma. Xia ruofei and Xia Qing both judged that when Song Wei’s cultivation reached the peak of Qi disciple Level 3, or even better, when she broke through to Qi disciple Level 4, she would be able to safely solve the hidden danger of the peach blossom miasma.

Song Wei’s homework this semester was heavy. Besides, Xia ruofei did not want to rush things and cause her Foundation to be unstable. Hence, the two of them were not in a hurry to start their next cultivation.

After the second round of training, Xia ruofei had just asked Wu Qiang to send Song Wei back to school when he received a call from Zhao Yongjun. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Ruofei, Tang real estate is ready to enter the market.” Zhao Yongjun said.

“Is that so?” Xia ruofei was surprised.”They’re pretty fast!”

“From what I know, Liu haofan and the Tang real estate company are really planning to hoard land.” Zhao Yongjun laughed and said,”this time, they don’t even want to level the site. They’re just going to build some simple buildings.”

“That’s great!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”brother Zhao, I’ll have to trouble you to keep an eye on that land. If anything happens, we have to promote it for young master Liu at once!”

“No problem!” Zhao Yongjun laughed. We’re good at this!”

......

Chen Dazhuang was sitting in a minibus, holding a quilt tightly in his hand. There was a big melting bag at his feet, which contained his luggage. There was bean paste made by his mother, a few pairs of handmade cloth shoes, and a large bag of clothes ...

It was his first time in Beijing, and he was very curious about everything in this super big city, even though he had never really been to the downtown area of Beijing.

Chen Dazhuang was a young farmer from the Sichuan Province. This time, he came to Beijing to seek shelter with his distant uncle.

His uncle had gone out to work more than ten years ago and was now a small contractor. He heard that he had made a lot of money. The last time he came home, he drove a Buick SUV that was said to cost more than 300000 Yuan.

After graduating from high school, Chen Dazhuang had been doing nothing at home. He used his connections to find his uncle, Zheng Hua, and said a lot of good things to him. Only then did Zheng Hua agree to take him to work in Beijing with him, working in Zheng Hua’s construction team.
