2072 Retreat after success (1)

When Monica and Rosey heard that, they let out an “ah” at the same time. They both felt that it was very sudden.

Especially Monica, who had just been together with Xia ruofei for a few days. The two of them had been fooling around every night. When she suddenly heard that Xia ruofei was going back to China, she suddenly felt a strong reluctance.

“Xia, why do you suddenly want to go back?” she asked.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ve been out for quite a long time. I even have a company in China!” We can’t just leave them behind. ”

“You’ve only been in Turin for a few days,” Rousey said in surprise. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment before he came back to his senses. Indeed, he had only been in Turin for four days, but he had actually made a trip to Italy as Xia Tian. It had been more than half a month since he came back. He had not realized this problem earlier.

Xia ruofei’s brain was spinning fast.””Oh ... I was on a business trip for a few days before I came. After I saw Monica’s email, I came to Italy directly. I haven’t been back to the company for almost a month.”

“I see ...” Rousey said.

In that case, they couldn’t keep him any longer. After all, his business was very important.

Monica’s heart was filled with warmth. Xia ruofei had not replied to her email before because he had not read it. However, the moment he saw the email, he rushed to Italy even if he was on a business trip. This showed that Xia ruofei cared about her very much.

Xia ruofei looked at Monica and then said to Rousey,””Rousey, have a good rest first! When your legs are fully recovered, you can go anywhere you want. You’re always welcome to come to China to play with me!”

“It’s a deal!” Rousey said with a bright smile.

“It’s a deal!” Xia ruofei said. Then, he turned to Monica and said,”Monica, come out with me. I have something to discuss with you.”

“Oh ... Okay!” Monica was a little distracted after hearing that Xia ruofei was going back to China.

The two of them left Rousey’s room one after another. Xia ruofei said to Monica,””I’m sorry! I can’t stay with you for a few more days this time ...”

Monica smiled and said,”it’s okay ... You’ve already done a lot for me!” Xia, I’ve just taken over the family’s Affairs recently, so I might be a little busy. After I’ve sorted things out on my side, I’ll go to China to see you when I’m free!”

Xia ruofei could see Monica’s deep affection for him. In fact, their relationship had unknowingly developed from purely physical needs to mutual admiration. Seeing the reluctance in Monica’s eyes, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel a little lost.

Monica saw this and quickly said,”Xia, I know you have a girlfriend in China. Don’t worry. I won’t ruin your relationship. But ... I also hope that you don’t leave me ... I ... It’s enough as long as I can occupy a little place in your heart ...”

Seeing this, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel pity. He quickly hugged Monica’s shoulder and said gently,””You’ve misunderstood. It’s not that I don’t welcome you to China. I just suddenly thought of something. Monica, you’re always welcome to go to China. Just let me know in advance and I’ll send a plane to pick you up!”

Monica pursed her lips and smiled.”There’s no need to go through so much trouble. When I’m free, I’ll buy a ticket and fly over!”

“Xia, when do you plan to return to China?” Monica asked.

Although Xia ruofei knew that Monica wanted him to stay for a few more days, he also knew that even if he stayed in Turin for a few more days, he would still have to go back eventually. Parting was inevitable.

Hence, Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””The initial plan is to meet with the physical therapist tomorrow and leave. The morning of the day after tomorrow at the latest! This will depend on my crew’s application for the flight route. ”

“In other words, we have at most 40 hours left ...” Monica said. Then, she glanced at Xia ruofei and said,”let’s go. Take me to my room!”

“Ah?” Xia ruofei was stunned.

“I must treasure every minute and second that I have with you.” Monica whispered into Xia ruofei’s ear,”and I hope you can remember every inch of my skin and every breath ...”

Her lazy voice and deadly seductive eyes made Xia ruofei’s heart burn with passion. Without a word, he pulled Monica and ran to his room ...

The next day, Xia ruofei and Monica accompanied Rousey to a famous local Rehabilitation Center in Turin.

Monica had already contacted everything in advance. In fact, Rossi had also received treatment at the rehabilitation Center over the years, but he was in a bad condition at the time. Rehabilitation training could only slow down muscle atrophy, but it could not do anything about his leg injury.

Therefore, when Rousey’s former attending doctor saw his current condition, he was also shocked beyond words.

Monica followed Xia ruofei’s instructions and did not reveal anything about Rousey’s treatment.

Rousey received a comprehensive examination at the rehabilitation Center. His condition was quite optimistic. His originally deformed leg bone had now been completely corrected. Most importantly, the necrotic nerves in his leg had also been restored to full vitality, like a withered tree coming back to spring.

Muscle atrophy could be recovered through gradual training. Also, after so many years without walking, Rossi might still have some psychological barriers.
