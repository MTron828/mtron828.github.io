Chapter 155: High – altitude conclave (1)

There were many people having lunch at noon, and the long dining table in the restaurant was not big enough to fit everyone. Xia ruofei and ye Lingyun moved the long dining table to the side and went to the garage to bring out the Round Table that the landlord had kept as a spare. There were not enough dining chairs, so they used all the plastic stools and folding chairs in the house. The dining environment was simple, but MA Xiong and the others didn’t care. They sat around and started eating. The dishes were all home – cooked. There was fish head tofu soup, braised carp, sweet and sour ribs, tomato fried eggs, stir – fried spinach ... There were more than a dozen dishes in total, and most of the ingredients were produced in the spirit map space. The dishes were all ordinary, and Hu Zi’s mother’s cooking skills were naturally not as good as the top Chef hired by the MA family. However, MA Xiong was very satisfied with the ingredients. Professor Tian, Ma Zhiming, and the others who had tasted the vegetables from paradise before were even more so. Even Lu You did not care about her image and ate heartily. After the meal, MA Xiong was even more determined to work with Xia ruofei. In the beginning, he more or less had the intention of helping Xia ruofei. After all, if these ingredients could enter Michelin – starred restaurants and global chain five – Star hotels, it would greatly improve the brand image of paradise Corporation. However, after tasting the ingredients from paradise, MA Xiong felt that these ingredients were fully qualified to enter the food and beverage companies under Hengfeng. He even believed that in time, Paradise’s ingredients would definitely become the first target of all the major food and beverage Giants. In this sense, Hengfeng had seized the first opportunity. After lunch, MA Xiong, professor Tian, and the others bade farewell and left. Naturally, little Huanhuan was reluctant to leave. When she heard Tian Huixin say that she would be able to see Xia ruofei again the next day and that Xia ruofei would go to Shen Cheng city with them, Huanhuan’s mood improved a little. After seeing MA Xiong and his men off, Xia ruofei started to make arrangements for the next few days. First, he contacted the West River Moon Club and Ling Ji restaurant, asking them to send a car to transport all the vegetables that needed to be supplied in the next few days. Then, Xia ruofei gave Cao tieshu a call. They had previously agreed to start transplanting the vegetable seedlings on the fourth day of the new year. Although Cao tieshu’s wife was currently recuperating, Xia ruofei still entrusted this matter to Cao tieshu. However, he had repeatedly reminded Cao tieshu not to come over on the fourth day of the new year. It was enough to just organize the manpower. Xia ruofei even hung up on pang Hao and asked him to come down on the fourth day of the new year to help keep an eye on the farm. With ye Lingyun and lightning around to ensure the safety of the farm, Xia ruofei was very assured. He only gave ye Lingyun a few simple instructions and left him a few thousand dollars in cash in case of emergency. The online Taoyuan roaty had put up a notice to close before the Spring Festival, so Xia ruofei didn’t need to care about it. However, he still used the night to enter the spirit map space and cut the mother plant that had almost recovered. When he returned from Shen Cheng, these seedlings could be sold. The next morning, Xia ruofei carried a small suitcase and said goodbye to Hu Zi’s mother and the rest. He got into a Mercedes – Benz that Hengfeng group’s Sanshan office had sent and went straight to Sanshan International Airport. They took the private jet Lane. After the symbolic security check, Xia ruofei was led into the restricted area by the airport’s VIP customer service. MA Xiong’s family had just arrived at the airport. What surprised Xia ruofei was that other than MA Xiong’s family, he also saw Lu You. Lu You was wearing a black double – breasted long coat with a white shirt on the inside. Her pencil – Gray skinny jeans accentuated her tall figure and long legs. She was wearing a pair of big sunglasses and had her hands in the pockets of her coat. She still had a cool expression. Xia ruofei was only stunned for a moment, but he immediately came back to his senses. Lu You probably had nothing to do during the winter break, so she followed Tian Huixin and the others to Shen Cheng city to relax! He greeted MA Xiong and the rest, then smiled and nodded at Lu You. For a super – rich man like MA Xiong, even after he returned to the mainland, he still had to deal with all kinds of Affairs every day, and his schedule was very tight. Compared to civilian flights, private planes were much more comfortable. For business people, efficiency was also very important. This kind of public jet had a flight route that could be applied in advance. Basically, the take – off time could be precise to the minute, and the passenger only needed to arrive on time. There was no need to be like taking a civil flight, which required at least an hour in advance to change the boarding pass at the airport, and boarding half an hour in advance. Then, there was the possibility of facing the flow control that would end at any time, and sitting on the plane and waiting all kinds of times. Time was precious to high – end business people. Xia ruofei and the rest arrived at the luxuriously decorated VIP lounge. After exchanging a few words, they boarded the plane. It was still the Gulfstream G650. This was also the Gulfstream company’s latest model of the commercial plane. It was definitely the top among the medium – sized jet commercial planes. Although Xia ruofei had already experienced it once, the luxury of the Gulfstream G650 was still shocking to him. Not long after everyone boarded the plane, the plane was allowed to take off. After taxiing on the runway of Sanshan International Airport for a while, the Gulfstream plane took off lightly and went straight into the cloudless blue sky. Tian Huixin and Lu You brought Huanhuan to the seats near the back of the plane while MA Xiong, his son, and Xia ruofei sat in the middle of the plane. The three of them sat on the wide, soft, handmade leather seats and talked about work while drinking coffee. The flight from San Shan to Shen Cheng was about an hour and a half by a civilian flight, while the Gulfstream business plane only took a little more than an hour. Within an hour, Xia ruofei and MA Xiong had finalized many details of the cooperation. The supply was set to be a month later. By that time, Tao Yuan farm would definitely be in full production. Every day, Tao Yuan company would provide 100 kilograms of various vegetables to Hengfeng group with a floating price of 15 times the average market price on that day. Hengfeng group’s Sanshan office would send vehicles to Tao Yuan farm every three days to transport the vegetables to their special cold storage warehouse. Then, relying on their developed own logistics channels, they would air transport the vegetables to restaurants and hotels around the world according to the rations. Xia ruofei roughly estimated that the cooperation with Hengfeng group would bring in at least 500000 Yuan of income for paradise Corporation every month. Considering the low cost, the net profit would be more than 400000 Yuan per month. Of course, to a super – rich man like MA Xiong, such a small business was not worth his attention. He was more interested in future in – depth cooperation. Therefore, the two sides also agreed that in the future, after the Peach Blossom Farm expanded its scale and increased its production, they would increase the supply accordingly. At the same time, MA Xiong also specifically mentioned that the future paradise Farm should also give priority to Hengfeng group when developing new top – grade ingredients. Xia ruofei was more than happy to work with the world’s richest man, MA Xiong, so he agreed without much consideration. MA Xiong’s business Secretary quickly printed out the memorandum of this discussion through the automatic office system on the plane for both parties to sign. The formal contract would naturally be signed after the end of this trip to Shen Cheng city. There were still many details that needed to be finalized by both parties. Of course, MA Xiong wouldn’t participate in the rest of the discussion. There would be a professional team to handle the matter. He was able to attend the meeting in person mostly because of Xia ruofei. Otherwise, any small manager in the Hengfeng group’s many subsidiaries could make the decision. The discussion at an altitude of 10000 meters ended in a relaxed and happy atmosphere. At this time, the Gulfstream business plane also slowly descended. From the porthole, they could already see the rows of high – rise buildings in Shen Cheng.
