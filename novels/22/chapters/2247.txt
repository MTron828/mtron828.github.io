2248 The advanced version of “three Immortals return to cave”(1)

He Jiong and Huang Lei were both slightly surprised when they heard this. If Qianqian was just singing a song or something on the spot, she could come anytime and anywhere. However, magic tricks usually required preparation in advance, and it was more professional. After all, there were cameras at all angles in the room, and there were also cameramen carrying machines to film. If the technique was not professional, it would be easy to be exposed.

Even though this was a pre – recorded show, and even if the performance failed, it would definitely not be broadcasted, they felt that Xia ruofei would definitely feel embarrassed. And from the performance of the station’s leader, it could be seen that the station’s attention to Xia ruofei was unprecedented. This made He Jiong a little cautious.

Was he really going to let Xia ruofei perform magic? He Jiong was a little hesitant.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Teacher he, I’m just performing a little magic trick to liven things up. If I’m exposed, just don’t laugh at me.”

After listening to Xia ruofei’s words, He Jiong also felt more relaxed. He thought for a while and said,”Since you’re so interested, President Xia, let ‘s...Give you a round of applause!”

“Alright!” Peng Chang was the first to clap in response.

Then, Huang Lei and Zhang Xing also started to clap.

Xia ruofei laughed and stood up. He made a pressing gesture with both hands and said,””Everyone! Everyone! I’m just a magician hobbyist, I can’t compare to a professional magician. Don’t make a fool of me!”

“I won ‘t! I won ‘t!” He Jiong smiled and said,”President Xia, we’re all looking forward to it!” Please start your performance!”

Xia ruofei nodded. After a moment of silence, he looked at the small table where everyone was sitting. He wanted to find a temporary prop. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Actually, Xia ruofei didn’t know magic. It was just that he had the spirit map space and as a cultivator, if he really wanted to conceal it, how could he Jiong and the others see through it?

Very quickly, Xia ruofei’s gaze landed on a can of tea leaves in the middle of the table. It was the peach blossom Brand Da Hong Pao. The festival team had placed the peach blossom Da Hong Pao at several places. The Big Peach blossom LOGO was facing the camera in order to help the peach blossom company increase its exposure.

Xia ruofei immediately came up with a plan.

He opened the can of tea leaves with a smile and said,””This is a can of Taoyuan Dahongpao. Although it’s a product of our company, it was provided by the production team. Before this, I had no contact with this can of tea leaves. Teacher he, please check it first!”

He Jiong took the can of tea leaves and the cameraman immediately came forward to take a close – up shot.

He Jiong said with a smile,”this is indeed a can of tea leaves that hasn’t been opened yet. Everyone, look. The plastic seal on the outer packaging is still intact!” I can testify that there’s nothing fishy about this pot of tea!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Teacher he, please open it!”

“OK!”He Jiong said as he tore open the plastic seal. He then lifted the lid of the can of tea leaves with force and asked,”what’s next?”

“Take out three packets of tea leaves.” Xia ruofei said.

The Taoyuan Dahongpao sold to the public was in small packages. One small packet was used to make tea each time, which was very convenient. There were about 20 packets of tea in the tea can. He Jiong took out three packets at random, then looked at Xia ruofei.

“Teacher he,” Xia ruofei said with a smile,”just put the tea leaves on the table ... Pengpeng, can you please go to the kitchen and get two bowls?”

“Alright!” Peng Chang stood up immediately and walked quickly to the kitchen. After a while, he came back with two bowls.

“Thank you!” Xia ruofei took the bowl and said with a smile.

He first tore a small hole in each of the three packets of tea leaves to distinguish them from the remaining tea leaves in the tea can. Then, he placed the two bowls behind the three packets of tea leaves and sat down cross – legged.

He Jiong, Huang Lei, Peng Chang, and Zhang Xing naturally gathered around as well. The cameramen also followed to take close – up shots.

Xia ruofei laughed as he turned the bowl over. He said,””Everyone, look. These two bowls were brought over by Pengpeng from the kitchen just now. They are just ordinary ceramic bowls and there are no mechanisms on them. You can check them!”

“There’s no need to check,” Peng Chang said, raising his hand.”One of the bowls was the one I used for dinner today!”

Everyone burst into laughter.

Xia ruofei asked Huang Lei to check the two bowls. After confirming that there were no problems, he said,””Well, here are two bowls and three packets of tea leaves. I will take one packet of tea leaves and cover the bowls ...”

Xia ruofei explained as he did. After covering a packet of tea leaves under the bowl, he took another packet of tea leaves and covered the bowl. Finally, he used his hand to grab the third packet of tea leaves.

Then, Xia ruofei blew at the bowl on the right and flipped it open. There were two packets of tea leaves in the middle. Then, Xia ruofei covered the bowl again and blew on it.

At this moment, Xia ruofei opened the bowl on the left and everyone gasped in surprise. There should have been a packet of tea in the bowl, but it was empty.

Xia ruofei smiled and opened the right bowl. There were already two packets of tea leaves. When he opened the bowl again, all three packets of tea leaves were moved to this side. It was as if Xia ruofei had teleported them over after blowing on them.

“Alright!” Zhang Xing was the first one to praise and then started clapping.

Huang Lei and the others also applauded.

He Jiong was clapping as he said with a smile, “I’ve heard of director Xia’s magic trick before. It’s called ‘three Immortals return to their caves’ and is a very traditional magic trick. However, the performer usually uses a sponge ball, which is easy to hide in the palm of the hand. And I’ve observed it carefully just now, and I really didn’t find any flaws. President Xia’s technique is very brilliant!”

“Thank you for your praise, teacher he,” Xia ruofei said with a smile.”However, my magic is a little different from the traditional ‘three Immortals return to cave’!”

He Jiong revealed a puzzled expression and asked,”I think the whole process just now was like the magic of the three Immortals returning to their cave ...”

“Then I’ll perform it for everyone again!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Xia ruofei’s movements were too fast during the first round. Huang Lei and the rest did not manage to see it clearly. Although the secret of the magic of the three Immortals returning to their caves had been revealed a long time ago and he Jiong had also watched the related videos, he really could not see any flaws in it just now. That was why Xia ruofei was willing to perform it again. Everyone also stared at Xia ruofei’s hands with wide eyes.

Xia ruofei unhurriedly placed the three bags of tea side by side and lifted the two bowls.

The previous process was exactly the same as before. Each bowl covered a bag of tea leaves, and then he picked up the last bag of tea leaves with his hand, blew on it, opened the right bowl, and found two bags of tea leaves inside.

“Teacher he, how many packets of tea do you think I have in the bowl on my left?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

He Jiong had seen the video of the revelation, so he was sure that Xia ruofei had used some technique when he covered the left bowl first. In fact, he did not put the packet of tea leaves in the bowl, but hid it in his palm. Then, he took the opportunity to put the packet of tea leaves in when he covered the right bowl. That was how the effect of having two packets of tea leaves under the right bowl appeared.

In this way, the bottom of the bowl on the left should be empty, because the tea leaves were not put in at all.

He Jiong did not intend to reveal it at first. After all, if he had not seen the video that revealed the secret, he would definitely not have been able to see the secret behind it.

However, Xia ruofei had actually taken the initiative to ask. Besides, Xia ruofei had already successfully performed this magic trick before, so He Jiong did not have so many concerns. He answered without thinking,”It should be empty inside!”

“That might not be the case!” Xia ruofei smiled.

Xia ruofei blew on his palm and pointed at the bowl on his left.””Can I trouble teacher he to open it and take a look?”

This time, Xia ruofei simply did not touch the bowl directly. Instead, he let He Jiong do it for him.

He Jiong saw with his own eyes that Xia ruofei had taken the third packet of tea leaves during the entire process. After that, he did not touch the bowl on the left anymore. The bowl on the right had already been opened, and the remaining two packets of tea leaves were there.

Under such circumstances, Xia ruofei had no chance to put the tea leaves into the bowl. Even if he was good at hiding the tea leaves, he could not put the tea leaves under the bowl in front of everyone.

So, He Jiong lifted the bowl with full confidence.

However, he was stunned to see that there was also a packet of tea under the bowl to Yingying’s left!

In fact, Xia ruofei did not use any magic techniques. He just covered the two packets of tea leaves with a bowl. When he grabbed the third packet of tea leaves, he kept it into the medium and took it out immediately. He made it appear under the right bowl.

At such a close distance, a packet of tea leaves was so small and light. With Xia ruofei’s level of spiritual power and the spiritual connection with the spirit map space, he could naturally hit where he pointed without any deviation.

This time, even the staff on the outside couldn’t help but show an amazed expression.

In front of so many people, Xia ruofei’s magic was obviously more exciting than the traditional ‘three Immortals return to their cave’.

Xia ruofei smiled and placed the bowl and tea leaves back in their original positions.

Then, he performed a series of dazzling operations. The process was exactly the same as the first magic trick. He was getting more and more familiar with it.

When he showed the two bags of tea under the right bowl, he reached out to cover the bowl and blew on it. Then he smiled and asked,””Everyone, guess how many packets of tea leaves are in the bowl on my right?”

According to the flow of the traditional magic of the three Immortals return to cave, the bowl on the right naturally had three packets of tea leaves, while the left bowl had none.

However, He Jiong was not so confident this time. He said with some uncertainty,”Three packets?”

Xia ruofei smiled and opened the bowl.

It was empty!

There wasn’t even a single packet of tea!

He Jiong was a little dumbfounded. He only spoke after a long while,”Is it all in the bowl on the left? This is impossible!”

“Teacher he, please open it,” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

He Jiong flipped the bowl open. Huang Lei and the rest immediately let out a cry of surprise. There was not a single packet of tea leaves here either!

“That’s amazing ...” Zhang Xing couldn’t help but ask,”Mr. Xia, where did the tea go?”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”That’s hard to say ... Maybe one of us here really likes our company’s Taoyuan Da Hong Pao and has hidden it away!”

If he didn’t show his results now, when else would he be able to get some exposure for his Peach garden’s Red robe?

“Then there’s only one possibility,” Peng Chang grinned and said,”the three bags of tea are all hidden on CEO Xia!” It’s just that his hands were moving too fast, we didn’t see it!”

Xia ruofei laughed and patted Peng Chang’s shoulder.””I think Pengpeng is the biggest suspect! This is called a thief crying thief!”

“Impossible!” Peng Chang stood up and said. President Xia had guessed wrong this time! I’m sure I didn’t take any tea leaves! If you don’t believe me, you can search my body!”

Peng Chang patted his chest as he spoke, looking very confident.

However, he noticed that He Jiong, Huang Lei and the rest had a strange expression on their faces. They were all looking at the same spot and tidying up his right pocket.

There seemed to be a bulge there ...
