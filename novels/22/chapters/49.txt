    Xia ruofei immediately took out the scroll and entered the spirit map space.

  There were still four - fifths of the petal solution left in the bottle, which was placed quietly in the space. Xia ruofei picked it up and walked to the succulent plant. He carefully poured a little into each pot. After each pot was finished, there was only half of the petal solution left.

  Most of the fleshy parent plants had been cut last time, so they were full of scars. After days of maintenance in the spatial space, they had almost recovered. However, if he wanted to cut them again, he would have to wait a few more days.

  There were also a few more pots that Xia ruofei had selected from the succulent seedlings. They had grown a lot since they had been in the spirit map space.

  After watering them with the petal solution, the succulent mother plants were clearly more energetic and full of vitality.

  Xia ruofei felt that there was hope. The petal solution would definitely help the plants grow.

  However, time would tell how effective it would be.

  He carefully placed the rest of the petal solution away, and then left the spirit map space with a thought.

  After returning to his room, Xia ruofei first replied to every comment and expressed his gratitude to everyone for their positive comments. At the same time, he told them that the new seedlings were in the cultivation process and that he believed that he would be able to meet everyone soon.

  In the afternoon, Xia ruofei rested in his room. He only entered the spirit map space after dinner.

  Calculating the time, two or three days should have passed in the space.

  Xia ruofei first went to the place where the succulent mother plant was placed and was overjoyed!

  These precious succulent plants were all in high spirits. The mother plant that had been cut once before had completely recovered, and was ready to cut at any time.

  As for the succulent seedlings left in the pots, they had almost grown a huge circle. It was believed that they would grow into adult plants in a few days, and they could be used for cutting.

  By a rough estimate, the growth rate of the meaty plants was at least ten times faster than before. Combined with the space's ten times time acceleration, the effect was simply terrifying.

  This proved that the petal solution had an obvious effect on the growth of plants. It also gave Xia ruofei more confidence in the cabbages that had been soaked in the solution.

  Xia ruofei, who was in a good mood, went to the nursery. All the seeds in the interspace had sprouted and grown to the point where they could be planted.

  Especially the cabbages that had been soaked in the petal solution. They were growing much better than the hollow cabbages next to them, which further confirmed Xia ruofei's judgment.

  He hummed a song as he began to fix - Plant the vegetable seedlings into the ridged vegetable field that had been cultivated in advance.

Suan ni were too precious, and the production wasn't high. At the moment, he didn't need it to grow vegetables in the interspace. As long as the ordinary spirit pool water was compatible with the   He had done this job countless times during this period of time, so he was very familiar with it.

  After a few hours, all the hollow vegetable seedlings and cabbage seedlings were planted.

  Then, Xia ruofei took out the other seeds and started to soak them in different containers.

  But this time, he didn't use the petal solution. He only used the spirit pool water. The petals of the Suan ni were too precious, and the production wasn't high. At the moment, he didn't need it to grow vegetables in the interspace. As long as the ordinary spirit pool water was compatible with the environment of the interspace, it was enough to produce high - Quality vegetables. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

  In the future, if he wanted to plant it on a large scale, he would definitely need a large amount of petals. In addition, the succulent mother plant and the succulent saplings would need a petal solution to grow quickly. Hence, it was best to save as much as possible.

  After soaking all the seeds, Xia ruofei went to harvest the ripe vegetables and packed them separately before leaving the spirit map space.

  Xia ruofei returned to his room and went online to order a large number of plastic flower pots and ordinary succulent plants. The delivery point was chosen to be a courier collection point in Changping County.

  He planned to start a new round of cutting breeding after receiving the goods in a few days.

  ……

  The next morning, the small truck from the "West River moon" club arrived at the holiday villa on time. To Xia ruofei's surprise, President Zheng from the club also came in person today. He was in a black Mercedes - Benz.

  "President Zheng, why did you come here personally?" Xia ruofei went up to him and said half - jokingly,"you're going to personally make a trip to a business that costs a few thousand Yuan. You're a Big Boss, aren't you going to die of exhaustion?"

  The manager from yesterday was with them. He directed the workers to the garage to move the vegetables with ease.

  The chubby President Zheng walked towards Xia ruofei with a smile and said,""Brother Xia, I'm here to tell you good news!"

  The day before yesterday, he had addressed Xia ruofei as "Mr. Xia". Today, he had addressed Xia ruofei as "brother Xia". The way he addressed Xia ruofei was more intimate and revealed President Zheng's intention to be on good terms with Xia ruofei.

  Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and asked,"

  "Oh? Could it be that the registration of my company has been settled?"

  President Zheng immediately scratched his head awkwardly and said,"

  "This ... We'll have to wait for a few days. Some procedures are necessary ... Of course, if brother Xia personally talks to Mayor Tian, the business license will definitely be issued on the same day!"

  Xia ruofei smiled and did not reply to President Zheng. Instead, he asked,"

  "Then what good news is President Zheng going to tell me?"

  "Of course it's the Paradise brand vegetables that we're working on!" President Zheng said excitedly,"when we got the first batch of vegetables yesterday, we immediately organized a new dish tasting meeting in the evening. All the guest members at the tasting meeting were full of praise for our Taoyuan brand vegetables! The response was better than expected!"

  Xia ruofei was very happy to hear that. He did not expect President Zheng to take action so quickly. He said,"

  "Oh, really? It seems like President Zheng's strategy is very effective!"

  President Zheng laughed and said,

  "It's because the ingredients provided by brother Xia are too good! Even the chef of our club praised it, saying that he had never processed such beautiful and delicious vegetables before!"

  Then, President Zheng said,"

  "Brother Xia, after yesterday's warm - up, it can be said that our paradise brand vegetables have a resounding name in the upper circles of Sanshan city!

  I'm going to officially launch the Taoyuan series of vegetables as our new signature dish from today onwards. Except for a small part of these signature dishes that are reserved for some special guests, the rest will be sold through auction. Of course, we also accept reservations, but members can only make reservations after three days, and ordinary guests can only make reservations after a week at the latest! What do you think, brother Xia?"

  When Xia ruofei heard this, he couldn't help but secretly give President Zheng a comment in his heart: Cunning old fox.

  A small portion was naturally reserved for big shots like Tian Huilan. In case these customers who couldn't be provoked had a need, they naturally had to be able to provide it at any time.

  As for the remaining parts, there was a need to pay attention to them.

  It was needless to say that the gimmicks of auctions could raise one's value and increase one's influence. Even reservations were arranged in different ranks to highlight the identity of the guests. At the same time, it naturally made the identity of a member of "West River moon" more valuable.

  After the name of the Paradise brand vegetable was announced, the business of "West River moon" would probably become more and more popular, especially the high - end customers, especially the rich upstarts, who would definitely rush to apply for membership.

  At that time, even if President Zheng collected membership fees, it would be enough to earn back the money he spent on buying vegetables at a high price.

  President Zheng chatted with Xia ruofei for a long time. He hoped that Xia ruofei would increase the supply appropriately. However, Xia ruofei did not respond to him and just pretended to be confused. President Zheng could only smile bitterly and give up.

  Soon, the vegetables were loaded into the truck. It was still more than 6500 Yuan, and the manager who accompanied President Zheng paid in cash.

  Before he left, President Zheng invited Xia ruofei to participate in the first auction for a new dish tonight. However, Xia ruofei rejected him tactfully after some thought.

  At this time, he didn't want to join in on the fun. As long as President Zheng could push it according to his ideas, the influence of his paradise brand vegetables would continue to expand, and the plan he had previously thought of would be half successful.

  Not long after President Zheng left, Xia ruofei left the villa in his pickup truck.

  Xia ruofei's back was filled with some new vegetables. Ran ran had promised professor Tian to send him some vegetables the day before yesterday. Xia ruofei did not want to go back on his word.

  It just so happened that he didn't have anything to do these few days, so he decided to visit professor Tian's house today.
