Chapter 524: Immortal land farmyx2

In comparison, Paradise Farm’s conditions were simply too good.

Of course, its price was also much more expensive. The price of more than 40 million Australian dollars for the 6000 – hectare area would intimidate many buyers.

The small villa on the farm had been left behind by the previous owner. It had a few decades of history, but the maintenance was quite good. Although it looked a little old on the outside, it was actually very comfortable to use.

On the first floor of the villa, there was a huge glass window on the side facing the man – made Lake. Next to the window was a small reception area. Guests could sit in this super – Bright area and enjoy tea while enjoying the unparalleled scenery.

Now, Xia ruofei and the rest were sitting in the guest area. Liang Qichao was making tea for everyone.

Xia ruofei took a sip of the hot tea and asked,””Brother Liang, our farm is so big, there should be a lot of workers, right? If you’re the manager here, you’ll be in charge of a lot of people ...”

“You’re wrong,” Liang Qichao said with a smile.”There are only eleven employees in the entire Paradise Farm, including me. Four of them are from the purebred horse breeding base. There are only seven people who really work on the farm ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but exclaim.

“Actually, there’s nothing strange about it. The farm is very modern, and the labor cost in Australia is expensive, so we have been very careful in hiring workers.” Liang Qichao smiled and said,”the manpower is just right for now. However, if we adjust our business strategy, we might need to recruit a few more people.”

Since they were already talking about this, Tang He smiled and asked,””Brother Xia, you’ve taken a look at the conditions of the farm. Do you have any thoughts on the next step of our farm’s management adjustment?”

Actually, Xia ruofei had been thinking about this question on the way here. After a slight pause, he said,””Elder Master Tang, brother Liang, the purpose of our cooperation back then was to introduce high – Quality paradise vegetables to Paradise Farm, so there is no doubt that the next step of vegetable cultivation is to be developed.”

Tang He nodded slightly and continued to listen to Xia ruofei’s opinion.

After Xia ruofei took a sip of tea, he continued,””Whether Peach Garden vegetables can be successfully planted and whether they can open a market in the Australian market after production, I think we need to explore all these step by step in actual work. So, my opinion is to start with small – scale planting in the early stage, with less than 500 hectares. While testing the planting, we can also test the reaction of the Australian market. If everything is as we expected, then we can start to expand the scale in half a year to a year. They even slowly shifted their focus from animal husbandry to farming. ”

“It’s the right thing to do steadily and surely. I agree with you. “Tang He nodded.

Liang Qichao added,”I’ve done some market research on vegetable cultivation after I arrived in Australia. The average vegetable intake of the Australians is insufficient. In other words, the Australians generally don’t like to eat vegetables. This is a disadvantage.”As for the advantage, the common vegetables in the Australian market are actually similar to those in China, but there are more varieties. In other words, the mature common vegetables such as tomatoes, cabbage, spinach, and onions developed in China can be directly tested and grown on our farm!”

Tang He looked at Liang Qichao with appreciation. Apparently, he was also very satisfied with Liang Qichao’s quick response to his role.

Back then, his original intention was to let Liang Qichao and Liang Xiaojun work at Sheng bang together United States it was a little like he wanted the two to fight each other. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Liang Qichao’s application to work in Australia was a little unexpected, but Liang Qichao had made a great contribution to the purchase of the Phoebe zhennan. Tang He finally agreed to his request, which was not too much.

However, in terms of importance, Tang He obviously valued Liang Xiaojun, who was trained in shengbang in the United States more. After all, Australia was just a farm, and the scale was too small.

But today, he had seen Liang Qichao take care of the farm in a short period of time. He was also quite farsighted and had done some market research in advance. This had also increased his impression of Liang Qichao by a lot.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Australians don’t like to eat vegetables. That’s because their local vegetables are too unpalatable!” I believe that after our paradise vegetables enters the Australian market, they will soon fall in love with eating vegetables. Maybe the diet structure of the Australians will change because of our market behavior!”

Xia ruofei’s words were full of confidence, but Tang He and Liang Qichao, who had personally tasted the peach Garden vegetables, felt that it was somewhat natural and did not think that he was boasting.

Of course, the premise was that Paradise Farm must also successfully grow Peach Garden vegetables of quality not lower than China.

Tang He was also most concerned about this question, so he immediately asked,””Brother Xia, now it seems that the key is to successfully grow paradise vegetables in Australia that are not inferior to those in China! Do you have any thoughts on this?”

“Mr. Tang, I’ve been thinking about this for a long time,” said Xia ruofei. “I think the best solution is to import vegetable seeds from paradise Corporation under the name of Paradise Farm. “Our paradise vegetables is an improved variety. At present, only our paradise company has this technology. In theory, as long as there are high – Quality seeds, we can grow paradise vegetables! Of course, whether these seeds can adapt to the soil and water in Australia still needs to be tested. ”
