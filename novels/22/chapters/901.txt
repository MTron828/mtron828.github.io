Chapter 902: Nowhere to hide (2)

If he used his spiritual power to investigate, would he find anything? Xia ruofei said to himself.

When Xia ruofei thought of this, he immediately focused and calmed down. He slowly released his spiritual power from his fingers and slowly probed into Song Wei’s meridians.

Spiritual energy was invisible to begin with, so Song Wei did not feel any discomfort.

However, she felt that Xia ruofei took a long time to check her pulse. Even the old Chinese medical doctors with white beards did not take as long as he did.

However, Xia ruofei did not retract his hand. She did not dare to move and sat stiffly on the sofa.

As they were checking his pulse, their bodies were closer to each other. Song Wei could even feel Xia ruofei’s breath. She felt her face burning and wanted to twist her body.

Xia ruofei did not notice Song Wei’s embarrassment. He was completely immersed in a whole new world. It was the first time he realized that he could use his spiritual power in this way.

After his mentality entered Song Wei’s meridians, it was like a holographic camera. Everything that was detected was fed back to Xia ruofei’s mind and an incomplete Meridian diagram was formed.

He could see the flow of the qi and blood in Song Wei’s body, the size of the meridians it flowed through, and whether there was any delay in each Meridian.

Xia ruofei then corroborated these situations with the Chinese medicine theories that he had learned on his own. Many of the doubts that he had in the past seemed to have been cleared up.

Traditional Chinese Medicine doctors also hoped to judge the patient’s condition by the ups and downs of the pulse. How could this be compared to Xia ruofei’s direct “inner vision” of the patient’s qi and blood circulation to be more direct and accurate?

Xia ruofei was completely immersed in this new discovery. He subconsciously compared the Chinese medicine knowledge he had learned by himself with what he had seen through his spiritual power.

Simply put, Song Wei had become Xia ruofei ‘s’ teaching tool ‘.

Song Qiming, Fang Liyun, and the rest had been watching Xia ruofei nervously. They were all nervous as well. They felt that Xia ruofei took a long time to feel his pulse. He would frown and relax at times. Sometimes, he would even be beaming with joy. His expression was very varied.

Luckily, Xia ruofei was recommended by Master Song. Song Qiming and Fang Liyun trusted him. Otherwise, they might have misunderstood Xia ruofei’s intention.

However, the longer Xia ruofei took to check her pulse, the more anxious they became. Could it be that her condition was very complicated, and the treatment plan they had thought of before might not be effective? Otherwise, why would Xia ruofei be in such a difficult position?

They were worried and anxious, but they didn’t dare to disturb Xia ruofei. They could only wait at the side.

Xia ruofei was lost in the ocean of Chinese medicine theories. He only came back to his senses after a long time. He quickly ignored the changes in yin and yang, five elements, and essence and started to examine Song Wei’s body.

Xia ruofei focused his attention on the cunning poison and quickly made a new discovery.

His psyche could sense that there were some small black particles floating in Song Wei’s meridians. They followed the flow of her qi and blood. There were also many small black particles attached to her meridians, especially in her heart meridian of the hand’s shaoyin. There were many of these small black particles. About half of the inner walls of her meridians had turned black.

Xia ruofei also noticed that the black particles seemed to be reproducing. He even saw one of the black particles break down into two, and the two particles slowly grew stronger by absorbing the qi and blood energy ...

I’ve finally found you! Xia ruofei said to himself.

Even the most advanced medical equipment could not detect the poison, and neither could many famous Chinese doctors. However, under Xia ruofei’s spiritual power, there was no way to hide it.

After Xia ruofei made this discovery, he tried to use his spiritual power to influence the black particles.

Xia ruofei realized that when he wrapped the black particles with his spiritual power, he could move them and change their trajectory.

This meant that even without the petals of the spirit Heart Flower, Xia ruofei could still get rid of this troublesome poison.

However, Xia ruofei’s current spiritual power was far from enough and there were too many black particles. Hence, even if he knew the principle, he would not use such a stupid method.

However, Xia ruofei was not satisfied with just finding the poison.

Although he couldn’t completely use his spiritual force to remove the poison, he could still bring out a few black particles.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power wrapped around a dozen of the black particles and circulated them through song Wei’s meridians. Soon, they passed through the meridians on her wrist and were taken out of Song Wei’s body by Xia ruofei. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

At this moment, Xia ruofei heaved a sigh of relief and retracted his finger.

No one noticed that there was an almost undetectable black dot on Xia ruofei’s fingertip. It was so small that it was only the size of a needle when dozens of it were gathered together.

Xia ruofei wanted to study the poison, so he had taken some samples.

He knew that once he started using the medicine, the poison in Song Wei’s body would be slowly removed. Once the poison was eliminated, it would be difficult to find a sample again.

This poison was invisible, colorless, and odorless. Even modern instruments and Traditional Chinese Medicine that had been passed down for thousands of years could not detect its existence. It even had the ability to reproduce. Xia ruofei was very interested in all these.

After collecting the sample, Xia ruofei let go of the spiritual power that wrapped the black particles.

After the black particles were freed from their restraints, they quickly entered Xia ruofei’s body.

If Xia ruofei did not have his spiritual power, the black Poison would spread in his body. Eventually, he would be like Song Wei and the others. He would start to faint and might even lose his life.

However, Xia ruofei was not worried at all. Once the poison entered his body, he immediately wrapped it up with his spiritual power and controlled it to a very small area around his fingers. It could not cause any trouble at all.

Even if he were to take a step back, even if he was really infected with this terrifying poison, he only needed to consume some spirit Heart Flower petal solution to get rid of it. Hence, Xia ruofei was still very confident.

Seeing that Xia ruofei had retracted his hand, Fang Liyun asked worriedly,””RUO Fei, what’s the situation?”

“Has his condition become more complicated?” Song Qiming asked with concern.

Xia ruofei knew that they were worried because he had taken too long to check her pulse. He felt guilty but quickly put on a confident smile and said,”Uncle song, Auntie Fang, don’t worry. Everything is under control. The poison has only invaded Song Wei’s hand’s shaoyin heart meridian. That’s why Song Wei fainted before.”

Song Qiming was stunned for a moment, then he was overjoyed.””RUO Fei, you ... You detected that poison?”

Song Wei was also in disbelief. Even 301 Hospital, which had so many world – Class equipment, could not detect anything unusual. How could Xia ruofei really detect the poison that was like a nightmare to her?

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Although the poison is very cunning, I was still lucky to find them.”

At this point, Xia ruofei paused and took out a small porcelain bottle from his bag.”Now that I know the cause of the illness, I’m more confident in the treatment.”

He passed the small bottle to Song Wei and said,””There are 15 pills that I’ve concocted in here. Take one pill a day. Your condition should be greatly improved after the first course of treatment. You won’t fall into a coma again. After three consecutive courses of treatment, the poison should be completely removed!”
