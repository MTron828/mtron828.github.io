Chapter 633: Heart – nourishing soup (3)

At this moment, Xia ruofei suddenly had an idea.

Previously, because of Huanhuan, Xia ruofei had specifically looked up children with autism in Chinese medicine when he was learning about Chinese medicine. From the perspective of Chinese medicine, there were a few types of autism symptoms: Heart and spleen deficiency, spleen and kidney yang deficiency, liver and kidney yin deficiency, heart aperture blocked by phlegm, brain blocked by blood stasis, and so on.

According to the description of the prescription, the effect of the heart – nourishing soup seemed to be very effective in all of the above situations!

Now, Xia ruofei had a certain Foundation in the theory of Chinese medicine. Although he could not analyze the composition of the prescription, the description of the medicinal effect seemed to be very accurate.

Xia ruofei took another look at the prescription – foxglove, Chinese yam, polycorum root, peony skin, Poria Cocos, corneal...There were more than ten types of medicinal herbs, all of which were relatively common. Although one or two of them were relatively expensive, they could be bought in pharmacies!

Xia ruofei’s heart was getting more and more excited. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Putting aside the fact that the heart nourishing soup would be of any help to him, if this prescription could have an obvious effect on treating autism, the significance would be incomparable.

The general conclusion of the world’s medical community was that autism could not be treated with medicine. A large number of families of autistic children used Behavior Therapy to carry out rehabilitation training in the form of behavioral correction. They tried their best to ensure that the patient could take care of himself and integrate into society.

Nowadays, the incidence of autism continued to increase. Every year, there were a large number of children with autism, and behind each child was a family in pain.

Xia ruofei had seen rich families like Tian Huixin and poor families like Xue biru. They were undoubtedly the epitome of the thousands of families with autism.

If the heart – nourishing soup could become a special medicine for treating autism, it would definitely become an epoch – making medical achievement!

Xia ruofei’s Grand wish of ‘helping the world’ began to’ stir ‘.

It just so happened that there was a very good opportunity for Xuanji Chengcheng to receive his treatment. If he gave up on using the spirit Heart Flower petal solution and switched to heart nourishing soup instead, it should be easy to test whether this prescription was effective in treating autism.

......

This was because Chengcheng’s case was very representative. His condition was more serious than Huanhuan ‘s, and he even had symptoms of epilepsy. If the heart – nourishing soup was effective on Chengcheng, then it meant that there was hope for curing almost all of the autistic people.

Of course, there were a series of complicated procedures and steps to introduce a drug to the market. They also had to recruit volunteers to carry out drug experiments, from small to large.

However, as long as he took the first step, the subsequent events would not be a problem!

He thought for a moment and made the decision to test the effects of the heart nourishing soup on Chengcheng!

There were definitely risks in the experiment, but Xia ruofei had the solution of the spirit Heart Flower. Even if there were any problems, he was confident that it would not cause a big disaster.

Of course, before that, Xia ruofei had to brew a heart – nourishing soup for himself. Although he was confident in the contents of the booklet, he was still quite cautious as it was for children.

The medicinal herbs needed to brew the heart nourishing soup were all stored in the original space.

Hence, Xia ruofei did what he said. With a thought, he disappeared from the stone room with the booklet.

The next moment, he appeared in the original space.

With a trace of excitement, Xia ruofei rushed to the medicine Shelf and began to pick the herbs according to the prescription ...
