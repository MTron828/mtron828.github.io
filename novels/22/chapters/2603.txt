2604 Light at the end of the tunnel (1)

Xia ruofei’s room was on the second floor, two rooms away from old master Liu ‘s. This way, he could look for Xia ruofei immediately if he needed help.

Xia ruofei asked Wu Qiang to return to the courtyard house while he rested in the guest room for a while. It was almost time for dinner.

Liu Qunfeng personally came to invite Xia ruofei to the dining room, and Liu Chongli accompanied him. The three of them prepared a large table of food and wine, making it very Grand.

During the meal, Liu Qunfeng kept expressing his gratitude to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei said calmly,”chief Liu, it’s too early for you to thank me ... Elder Liu’s condition is very complicated now. Furthermore, we don’t have all the medicinal herbs. So, I’m not very confident.” As for the effect of this treatment, it will still depend on luck!”

“I know! “I know ...” Liu Qunfeng quickly said.”No matter what the result is, our gratitude will not change! I admire your character, Mr. Xia! We can also see that you’ve truly spared no effort in this matter!”

Liu Chongli also raised his glass and said,”Mr. Xia, I’d like to propose a toast to you too.” I’m ashamed to say this ... When you took away the pharmaceutical Group, I was quite dissatisfied in my heart ... The facts have proven that we have judged the heart of a gentleman with the heart of a villain! Mr. Xia is a true gentleman!”

The reason why Liu Chongli’s attitude had changed so much was because of the “sky’s will parasite”, which was the Amethyst blood radish on Xia ruofei’s list. Just one herb was worth 200 million US dollars. How much would the list of herbs that even the Chinese Medicine Research Institute’s experts had never heard of be worth?

Furthermore, even if he had the medicinal herbs, he still had to master the right prescription! The value of this knowledge was hard to estimate. After all, it was a life – saving medicine.

With all these! It was not expensive for Xia ruofei to take away a Pharmaceutical Group! Even the Liu family had taken advantage of it.

Xia ruofei was a little embarrassed by Liu Chongli’s praise. After all, the actual cost he paid was not that exaggerated.

The medicinal herbs on the list were all randomly listed by him. They were all medicinal herbs that could only be found in the cultivation world. Some of them were so precious that even some high – Level cultivators might not have them. Even ordinary medicinal herbs, such as the Amethyst blood radish, would be considered an extraordinary treasure in the secular world. If this was the case, the cost of those pills was really high.

However, Xia ruofei did not use the herbs on the list!

He had not expected that the Liu family would really find information on the medicinal ingredients on the list after digging three feet deep. A stalk of purple crystal blood radish was actually auctioned for 200 million US dollars. This immediately caused the Liu family to misunderstand the value of the previous batch of pills.

However, even the purple crystal blood radish could be auctioned for 200 million US dollars ... Xia ruofei thought of the dazzling array of spiritual herbs in his realm Heart island’s herb garden. There were countless herbs that were more expensive than the purple crystal blood radish. How much was that herb garden worth?

Of course, the precious herbs in the world of cultivation could not be measured by money. During the most prosperous time of the cultivation world on earth, the truly precious natural treasures were also bartered.

Only a fool would exchange spirit herbs for money. Which cultivator would be a fool?

Xia ruofei coughed and said,””President Liu, you flatter me. I’m just doing my duty as a doctor! Since I’ve accepted this task, I’ll do my best. ”

“To be able to do this is already admirable!” Liu Qunfeng raised his glass and said,”Mr. Xia is very generous! Come, I’ll toast you again!”

……

Xia ruofei stayed in the Liu family’s residence.

He had prepared six bags of medicinal soup. If he took the medicine twice a day, the medicinal soup would last him for three days.

The rest of the Chinese medicine was still stored in the refrigerator in the room next to elder Liu ‘s. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

With the previous experience, Liu Qunfeng placed great importance on the safety of the medicine.

Not only did he arrange for two people to stand guard 24 hours a day, but he also installed several cameras and had someone to watch the surveillance footage all day long.

Liu Qunfeng had also strictly ordered that only Xia ruofei was allowed to touch the bags of Chinese medicine. No one else was even allowed to go near the fridge.

Once bitten by a snake, twice shy!

That evening, Xia ruofei asked the nurse to put a bag of Chinese medicine into elder Liu’s stomach through a nasal feeding tube with an infusion set.

Starting from the second day, he would take the medicine every morning and night.

Every time he took the medicine, old man Liu’s condition would improve. It could be clearly seen through the vital signs monitoring equipment that his various indicators were developing in a good direction.

Although he was still unconscious, Liu Qunfeng and the others felt a glimmer of hope and were very excited.

After all, Xia ruofei had said from the start that this was an alternative prescription that he had developed himself. It was hard to say whether it would be effective or if there would be any side effects.

So, at first, Liu Qunfeng was very nervous. He was afraid that elder Liu’s condition would suddenly worsen and he would die.

Now, it seemed that Xia ruofei’s medical skills were still absolutely trustworthy. In the absence of medicinal herbs, the substitute formula that he had developed in two days still played a good role in the treatment.

On the morning of the third day, Xia ruofei personally watched the nurse inject the fifth bag of Chinese medicine into elder Liu’s stomach before returning to his room to rest.

He sat in front of the computer and was going to watch a movie to kill time. For the past few days, he had nothing to do except to personally supervise the nurse feeding the medicine into old man Liu’s stomach and to do a routine check on the old man’s physical condition. It was quite boring to stay here.
