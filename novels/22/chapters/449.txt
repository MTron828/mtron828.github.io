Chapter 450: The beautiful County Head (1)

“Yay!” Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but cheer.

Although Ling Qingxue didn’t know much about politics, she didn’t need to know anything about it. Even an old farmer in the village would know what elder song’s personally written inscription meant.

Even Wu Liqian couldn’t help but look excited. She was really happy for Xia ruofei.

Naturally, Xia ruofei could not suppress his joy. He quickly picked up the phone on his desk and made a call in front of Ling Qingxue and Wu Liqian.

“Little fatty! How’s the progress with your finance department?” Xia ruofei asked.

Pang Hao had been working in a guest room on the first floor of Xia ruofei’s Villa. Sometimes, he would sleep in the office when he was late. The living conditions were rather tough. With the completion of the new building, the finance department now had a spacious, bright, fully equipped office. Considering that pang Hao’s family lived in the city, Xia ruofei had even reserved a single apartment for him. He could live on the farm now and return to the city on weekends.

“I’ve moved more than half of it,”said pang Hao over the phone. It’s mainly some bills and accounts that I want to sort out before moving, so as not to mess them up and make it difficult to file. ”

“Bring the scanner to my office first,” Xia ruofei said directly.

Xia ruofei had specially equipped pang Hao with a scanner because the farm now had to provide a large amount of Taoyuan vegetables to the business partners every day. In the beginning, it had been a daily payment, but now it had been changed to a weekly payment. However, there was still a lot of receipt and receipt payment. Xia ruofei had requested that all the receipts had to be scanned and saved into an electronic file. This way, it would be more convenient to manage and check. That was why he had specially bought a scanner.

“Alright! I’ll be right there!”

After a short while, pang Hao arrived at Xia ruofei’s office with a scanner in his arms, panting.

Xia ruofei took the scanner and quickly connected it to the computer in the office. Then, he picked up the four words “Peach Blossom Farm” and put it into the scanner.

This question wasn’t too big. Xia ruofei scanned it into the computer in two tries and quickly used a software to piece the entire question together into a complete picture.

Actually, there was a special instrument for scanning calligraphy outside. However, elder song’s calligraphy was not big and it was not a complicated Chinese painting. It was easy to piece it together, so Xia ruofei decided to do it himself. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Pang Hao asked curiously from the side,”ruofei, these words are really nice!” Who gave you the questions?”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”You don’t have to worry about who did it. Anyway, it’s an amazing person!”

Then, Xia ruofei sent the generated image file to pang Hao’s email and said,””Little fatty, I have a temporary task for you.”

“Go ahead,”

“I’ve already sent this piece of calligraphy to your email. Go back to the city immediately and find a reliable advertising company to help us create a signboard for Tao Yuan farm.” Xia ruofei said,”these four words will be hung on our farm’s Gate. Go to the gate and take a few photos later. As for the specific design, let the advertising company come up with a plan. My request is that it must be beautiful and Grand. Of course, the most important thing is that these four words must be perfectly copied without any changes.”

“Understood!” Pang Hao immediately said,”I have a relative who works in Lido advertising. I’ll definitely do a good job for you!”

“Alright! Then you go now!” Xia ruofei said,”let them come up with a few more proposals. It doesn’t matter if they are more expensive!”

“Alright!” Pang Hao said. Then, he chuckled and said,”ruofei, I’ve been wasting time riding my motorcycle back and forth. What do you think ...”

Xia ruofei immediately took out the pickup key and threw it to pang Hao.””Be careful on the road!”

Pang Hao had just gotten his driver’s license recently, and his car addiction was at its peak. He took the key and said with a smile,””Don’t worry! Although I’m a new driver, I’m good at driving!”

After he finished speaking, he ran out.

Xia ruofei then said to Ling Qingxue,””Qingxue, uncle Ling knows a lot of people. I would like to ask him to help me get someone to frame that calligraphy and hang it in the office.”

“Alright! I’ll bring it back in a while. ” Ling Qingxue said without hesitation.

“Try to find the best framing master.” Xia ruofei said and then added,”keep your mouth shut.”

Elder song’s signature and seal were on the piece of calligraphy. Although Xia ruofei was going to hang it in his office after he framed it, he did not want the news to spread during the framing process and for everyone to know.

“Okay, I’ll remember that.” Ling Qingxue replied obediently,”I’ll tell my dad.”

Xia ruofei nodded. He rolled up the words carefully and put them into the paper box. Then, he put it aside.

As for the “Taoyuan farm” painting, Xia ruofei naturally would not hang it up, but he cherished it very much. He called Lei Hu to get a few pieces of rice paper, a preservation film, and a sealed bag.

Then, he covered the calligraphy with blank xuan paper, rolled it up carefully, and wrapped it with a layer of preservation film. Finally, he put it in a sealed bag and put it in the safe in the corner of the office.

Most of the time, mounted paintings were harder to preserve. Since the words would not be hung out, Xia ruofei’s current method was the most appropriate. If he folded it casually, it would leave marks or even damage after a long time. He rolled it up with paper as a base, wrapped it in a plastic wrap, and put it in a sealed bag. This could basically isolate the words from the air and prevent it from being oxidized over time.
