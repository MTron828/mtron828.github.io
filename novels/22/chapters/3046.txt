3047 Don’t envy the immortals (1)

Translator: 5496903At this moment, the black flying boat had already begun to accelerate. However, the acceleration process was very stable and could not be felt from the cabin. As soon as they arrived on the deck, Ling Qingxue immediately experienced what it meant to be as fast as lightning. The altitude of the airboat was also rising steadily. At this time, it was passing through the clouds. All that hit them was the lingering clouds. However, when they encountered the barrier, they immediately split into two sides. The airboat was like cutting through the waves in the clouds.

Moreover, on the deck of the airboat, there was basically no blind angle at all. The shield layer was also invisible to the naked eye, so it gave people the feeling that they were directly outside.

It was a completely different feeling from when he was on the plane and looked out through the narrow porthole.

Moreover, the speed of the airboat had far exceeded that of an ordinary civilian airplane.

Ling Qingxue was so excited that she kept shouting, like an innocent and lively child.

Ling Qingxue only returned to her cabin after the flying boat had completely passed through the clouds and the view below could no longer be seen.

“Ruofei, this airboat is too cool!” Ling Qingxue said excitedly,”is this really made by a cultivator? It’s simply unimaginable!”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”don’t you feel the fluctuations of the formation?” This flying boat is completely dependent on a formation to maintain its flight, and it’s also constantly consuming energy. There ...”

Xia ruofei pointed at the spiritual crystal on the control panel and smiled.””You should know about the crystals, right? This flying boat doesn’t burn oil, but spirit crystals!”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but stick out her tongue and said,””This is too extravagant!”

Xia ruofei said nonchalantly,”it’s alright. One spiritual crystal can last for a long time. I can still afford it now!”

After setting the course and speed, the airboat could keep flying forward in this state.

Hence, Xia ruofei decided to walk out of the cabin with Ling Qingxue. They sat down on the deck and enjoyed the view while chatting.

From the three mountains to the capital city, it would only take about two and a half hours by ordinary commercial aircraft, but the speed of the airboat was much faster than that of a commercial plane. Moreover, the airboat did not need to fly according to the established route, but in a straight line, so the distance was naturally much shorter.

In this way, they were close to the capital Area after flying for about half an hour.

Of course, Xia ruofei and Song Wei had agreed to meet in an hour. In reality, Ling Qingxue had taken more than 20 minutes to return to the villa area, so the time was just right. They arrived at the capital University Library and did not have to wait too long.

After entering the capital, Xia ruofei did not return to the cockpit. Instead, he used his spiritual power to control the console and lowered the black airboat below the clouds. At the same time, he slowed down.

In fact, as the political and economic center of China, Beijing was very strict in air traffic control.

All the air routes actually bypassed the sky above the Main City. Normally, if one took a civil flight or private plane, they would not be able to enjoy the scenery of the capital’s main city. As for flying over the Forbidden City, it was completely impossible.

However, since they were on an airboat this time, they naturally didn’t have so many concerns.

Xia ruofei simply steered the black flying boat and made a small turn. He flew slowly over the Forbidden City and took a good look at the magnificent city from this special angle.

90 am was the time when the Forbidden City had the most tourists. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The black flying boat flew at an altitude of about 50 meters, and the tourists below could be clearly seen from the flying boat.

As for the ordinary people, they did not notice the black flying boat that flew over their heads at all.

At Ling Qingxue’s request, Xia ruofei steered the flying boat and flew over the Forbidden City twice from two diagonal directions. Then, he turned around and headed towards Capital University.

Because they had spent some time flying over the Forbidden City, when the black flying boat slowly stopped above the roof of the library of Beijing University, Song Wei just opened the door of the roof and walked out.

As a cultivator, Song Wei could naturally see the black flying boat.

She was stunned for a moment. It was obvious that the scene in front of her was different from what she had imagined. She had thought that she would see Xia ruofei flying over on a flying sword, but she did not expect to see such a big ship.

However, Song Wei was calmer than Ling Qingxue and did not make a fuss.

Of course, this was also because Ling Qingxue had stuck her head out of the deck and waved at Song Wei.

Song Wei felt more at ease after seeing Ling Qingxue. Initially, she was worried that Xia ruofei was not the one who drove the airboat here. Although the probability was low, it was not impossible.

“Weiwei, come up quickly!” Ling Qingxue called out.

Song Wei was wearing a white T – Shirt and blue jeans. Her hair was tied into a ponytail and she was holding a stack of books in front of her chest. She was dressed like a student.

However, after hearing Ling Qingxue’s words, she raised her head and smiled. Then, with a light push of her feet, her body jumped up nimbly and landed lightly on the deck, looking quite like a heroine.

Xia ruofei also walked out of the cabin with a smile.

Ling Qingxue held Song Wei’s hand and asked,””Wei Wei, this is RUO Fei’s new flying Dharma Treasure. It’s not bad, right?”
