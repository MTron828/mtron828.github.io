2625 The star Seizer sect (1)

How to take over, how to transform, how to manage ... These were all matters that would be taken care of after obtaining the island.

Xia ruofei only thought about it briefly and formed a few options in his mind. Then, he stood up and strolled towards the project department building.

In the evening, Liu Qingfeng prepared a sumptuous dinner for Xia ruofei and Liu Kuan, and the middle management of the Qingyun Island project also arrived.

After a night’s rest on green cloud Island, Xia ruofei and Liu Kuan left green cloud Island in paradise and flew to Australia early in the morning.

Although Xia ruofei and the rest had left, the people in charge of the green cloud Island project had their own plans.

Liu Kuan did not deliberately hide the news. On the contrary, under the instructions of old master Liu, he had already revealed the news that the owner of cyan Cloud Island might change to Liu Qingfeng and the others. He also clearly told everyone that the next owner of cyan Cloud Island was very likely to be Xia ruofei.

After all, most of the people who participated in the construction of Qing Yun Island were the capable men of the Liu family. Over the years, they had invested a lot of time and energy in the construction of Qing Yun Island. Old master Liu had asked Liu Kuan to let them know in advance so that they could be mentally prepared in case Xia ruofei really chose this plan to collect the medical fees, and the people on Qing Yun Island were caught off guard.

Of course, old man Liu still had a scrutinizing mentality. He also wanted to see how the people in charge of the blue cloud Island project would react after they learned that the island was about to change hands. Usually, only at this time could a person’s true side be revealed.

Some of these project managers were very depressed, some had an indifferent attitude, and even more people were busy making calls back home, asking for help from acquaintances in their families to operate a new position. Obviously, most people thought that once Xia ruofei took over the green cloud Island, they would be kicked out of the house, so many people had begun to find a way out, including Liu Qingfeng.

However, Liu Qingfeng was not as anxious as the others. After all, his position in the family was still very high. Otherwise, he would not have been entrusted with the important task of building the blue cloud Island. Therefore, Liu Qingfeng was only concerned about where his next position would be. For a backbone of the Liu family like him, once Xia ruofei took over the green cloud Island, he would definitely not stay.

At the same time, Liu Qingfeng also had a deep regret in his heart. It could be said that under his witness, the blue cloud Island was built little by little. Now, more than ten years of hard work had ended up in someone else’s hands. For Liu Qingfeng, who had been in charge of this project for many years, there was a strong sense of frustration in his heart.

……

Evates Island was the island where the capital of ponattu was located. It was also the largest island in ponattu’s territory, covering an area about ten times the size of Qingyun Island.

It was the only five – Star hotel on the island, the Kenu Holiday Hotel.

In one of the luxury suites in the hotel, two people were sitting on the sofa in the living room and having an intense discussion.

Both of them had Chinese faces. The older one was about 60 years old and was wearing a light green robe. It was rare even in China, not to mention in an island country far away in the South Pacific. The other man was slightly younger, about forty years old. He was dressed quite normally, wearing a beige casual suit, and his hair was combed back neatly.

“Martial uncle Zheng, I still feel that we can’t rush this matter!” The middle – aged man with slicked – back hair played with his jade ring and said,”now that the island has been in their hands for more than ten years, and they are not short of money, what do you think we can do in a short time?” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Martial uncle Zheng, who was wearing a light blue long robe, frowned and said,””Boshan, can you put down that thing in your hand first? The sect made you in charge of worldly affairs, not for you to learn to be like those nouveau riche!”

The middle – aged man with slickback hair awkwardly took off the Jade ring and put it in his pocket. He laughed and said,””Martial uncle Zheng, I ... I’m just trying to better integrate into the secular world, right? Tell me, if I dress like you all day and look like an immortal, how can I make friends with people in the secular world? How was he going to do business? How do I complete the mission given by the sect?”

“You have so many reasons!” Martial uncle Zheng glared at him and said,”there’s only the two of us here. Who are you acting for? I think you’re addicted to this colorful world and have forgotten your home!”

The middle – aged man with slickback hair quickly cried out,””Martial uncle Zheng, you’ve wronged me! No matter how good the secular world was, could it be better than the sect? Not to mention anything else, this impure spiritual energy was enough to choke him. There was no way for him to cultivate properly! If it wasn’t for my poor results in the competition, I wouldn’t have been sent here! If they could return to the sect to cultivate, who would be willing to stay here?”

The middle – aged man with slicked – back hair was called Wang Boshan, and the old man in the long robe was called Zheng Yongshou. The two of them came from the star Seizer sect. Zheng Yongshou was a disciple of the Yong generation of the star Seizer sect, while Wang Boshan was one generation lower than Zheng Yongshou. He was considered a third generation disciple of the star Seizer sect.
