2495 Playing with the lucky draw (2)

When the employees in the group saw that the chairman had directly sent red packets without saying a word, they all hurriedly opened the red packets.

Everyone thought that the Chairman’s Red packet would definitely not be small.

He didn’t expect that one by one, he would get one or two Yuan at the most, a few cents at the least, and even a penny at the most.

Xia ruofei was usually more easy – going, and this was not a formal work group, so a bold employee could not help but complain,””Chairman, you’re too stingy! He only sent ten Yuan and strongly requested the chairman to issue it again ...”

This guy was the “unlucky guy” who only got one cent.

“It is! That’s right!” Another employee jumped out and said,”although I’m the luckiest, it’s only 2.30 yuan!”

“Refire!”

“Additional discussion!”

“+10086 reissues!”

Dong Yun opened the red packet curiously and looked at the amount that everyone had received. Then, she looked at Xia ruofei with a smile. She wanted to see how Xia ruofei would respond to his employees.

Xia ruofei was busy typing on his phone. Soon, a message from Xia ruofei popped up in the group.

“Instead of focusing on the amount of red packets, why don’t you focus on your own ranking? Because I’m going to Spain this time, there are still 6 seats left in my plane. The red packet snatching was just a lucky draw, so I’ve already decided to give these 6 seats to the 6 people who received the least amount of red packets. As for the 4 people who are more lucky, I’ll have to trouble you to take the commercial plane!”

After Xia ruofei said that, the group suddenly quieted down. Everyone hurriedly opened their red packet records to check their ranking, especially those who had a moderate amount of money. They were extremely anxious.

Only the “unlucky guy” who had only managed to get a penny was very confident. He sent a laughing emoji and said,””Thanks for letting me win! Thanks for letting me win!”

As for the one with the ‘best luck’, he didn’t even need to look to know that he had no chance, so he immediately sent a crying emoji.

“Chairman, you’re really going all out!” Dong Yun couldn’t help but say. It’s not cheap to fly an official jet to Spain, right?”

“Since we’re going out to play, of course, it’s more important to be happy!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s a pity that there are too many people. The plane is too small to fit.”

At this time, everyone had already checked their own rankings. Those in the bottom six were naturally ecstatic. For these ordinary employees, having public expenses for a vacation was already a super good benefit, and to be able to travel by public jet was an even bigger surprise.

Some people were happy, while others were disappointed. The four people who got the highest amount of money all sent a crying emoji.

At this moment, Xia ruofei sent a message.”It seemed that someone had just suggested re – publishing it, right?

At the same time, he also tagged the girl named shi wen, Jian Jia, who had snatched a penny. She was the first one who jumped out to ask Xia ruofei to send a big red packet.

“Don ‘t!” Shi wen quickly sent out a message.

Very quickly, the group chat was filled with messages. Those who managed to get a spot in the official jet naturally begged for it while the other four were the loudest and actively responded to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but send a laughing emoji, followed by another message,”What a joke, this was the final result. However, don’t be discouraged if you didn’t get it. We’ll draw again on our way back, and it’ll still be six spots. In addition, although you didn’t get to board the Paradise business plane, the company will book you a business class ticket, so the comfort is still guaranteed!

After Xia ruofei’s message, the employees in the group finally stopped and expressed their support.

The four employees who didn’t get the spots thought that they still had a chance to come back. The probability of three in five was still very high. In addition, the chairman had even booked expensive business class tickets for the four of them. How could they still complain?

Dong Yun, who had been silent all this while, saw this message and could not help but give Xia ruofei a thumbs up.”The chairman is really generous! I can’t say for sure about other things, but at the very least, this batch of employees will have a much stronger sense of belonging to the company!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’ll leave the rest to you!” By the way, the second batch of employees will definitely know the news soon. Why don’t you tell everyone that there will be seven slots for the public jet, and they will be drawn out using the same method as today!”

Paradise could carry eight passengers. This time, Xia ruofei and Dong Yun would have to take a seat each, so there were still six seats left. In the second batch, Xue Jinshan would definitely take the public transport as well, so there were only seven spots left.

“Chairman, there’s no need for the next batch, right?” Dong Yun asked in surprise. Now, commercial planes are also very convenient. There’s a direct flight to Barcelona from Beijing, and the flight is about 11 hours. There’s no need to waste money on a commercial plane to fly again!”

Dong Yun felt that it was reasonable for Xia ruofei to use the plane since he wanted to go on his own. However, the next time, other than Xue Jinshan who was part of the company’s management, the rest were all ordinary employees. There was no need to use the plane. In her opinion, it was a waste.

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.”It won’t cost much. The most important thing is to be fair. The second batch of employees are still staying at Qiantang. Speaking of which, they’re working harder. We can’t let them be disappointed.”

“It’s not that bad ...” Dong Yun hurriedly said.

“It’s decided then!” Xia ruofei said,”by the way, I’ve decided to leave the day after tomorrow. Arrange for the remaining four employees to book their tickets in advance! Since there’s a direct flight to Beijing, then let’s fly from Beijing!”

“Alright!” Dong Yun stood up and said.

“By the way, is the Spain team done with the docking?” Xia ruofei asked.

Dong Yun nodded and said,”the RCD Espanyol has made very thorough arrangements. They have arranged everything after we landed in Barcelona. We don’t have to worry about the hotel, transportation, food, and even the tour in Barcelona.”

“That’s good!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”President Dong, you can go and do your work! By the way, I won’t be coming to the company tomorrow if I don’t have anything to do. I’ll come to the company early in the morning the day after tomorrow to go to the airport with everyone!”

“Alright!” Dong Yun said.

……

When Xia ruofei returned home from work in the evening, he specially asked Ling Qingxue out for dinner.

Ling Qingxue knew that Xia ruofei was going to Spain, so she stayed behind to accompany Xia ruofei. Now, Ling Qingxue was no longer as resistant as when Xia ruofei had first revealed his relationship with Song Wei. In reality, both Song Wei and Ling Qingxue were well aware that their agreement had long been “in name only.” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The next day, Ling Qingxue even took a day off and did not go to the office. She accompanied Xia ruofei at the jiangbin villa. The two of them chatted, cooked together, cultivated together, and happily rolled in the sheets together ...

On the morning of the third day, after Ling Qingxue and Xia ruofei had breakfast together at the jiangbin villa, Xia ruofei picked up the small registration case and was ready to leave.

The two of them went to the courtyard. After Xia ruofei placed the box into the trunk of the Knight XV off – Road vehicle, Ling Qingxue carefully helped Xia ruofei tidy up his clothes and said softly,””Be careful when you go out!”

Xia ruofei grinned and said,”wife!” Don’t you worry! Don’t forget that I’m a cultivator of refined Qi level 9. Ordinary people are not my opponent at all! Even if someone wanted to take advantage of me, it wouldn’t be easy to kill me!”

“Pei Pei Pei!” Ling Qingxue quickly said,”can you not talk about this kind of toxic healer in the future? It’s very inauspicious!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but rub Ling Qingxue’s face. He smiled and said,””I didn’t expect my wife to be so superstitious! Alright, alright, alright! I won’t say anymore, don’t worry, don’t worry! I’ll be careful!”

“Go! Don’t let your staff wait too long!” Ling Qingxue said,”I’ll help you clean up the villa!”

Xia ruofei kissed Ling Qingxue’s pretty face and said,””Then I’ll have to trouble my wife! I’ll bring you a present!”

With that, Xia ruofei opened the car door and got in. He waved at Ling Qingxue and drove the Knight XV out of the jiangbin villa district, heading in the direction of the Tao Yuan building.
