“Alright, I’ll remember that!” Fang Liyun nodded.

“Mom, RUO Fei brought a lot of stuff here, and I was just saying that!” Song Wei said. I thought he moved his house here ... I’ll take you to see it!”

After that, Song Wei pulled Fang Liyun to the guest room that was arranged for Xia ruofei.

“This child ...” Fang Liyun rebuked.

Even though Fang Liyun sounded a little reproachful, she was still curious. Besides, the things that Xia ruofei brought must be related to song Qiming’s rehabilitation, so she really wanted to take a look. Thus, she followed Song Wei into the room with a half – heartedly.

Fang Liyun was stunned for a moment when she saw the large and small bags piled in the corner of the wall and the eye – catching small Plastic Sealing Machine. She then smiled and said,”There are quite a lot of things!”

Xia ruofei smiled and explained,”Auntie!” These are all useful for the treatment, and I’m going to Beijing in two days. Before I leave, I have to boil the medicine that uncle song has been using recently! Wasn’t this? I even brought the Plastic Sealing Machine over. After the Chinese medicine is sealed, it should be stored in the refrigerator for ten days to half a month without any problem!”

Xia ruofei had told song Qiming and Fang Liyun about his trip to the capital. Song Qiming understood the reason behind it. Although Fang Liyun was not too sure, she knew that it was related to elder song. Hence, she was worried that Xia ruofei’s departure would affect song Qiming’s recovery. However, she did not object to it.

Seeing that Xia ruofei had arranged for his treatment in the capital, Fang Liyun was very pleased and said,””Ruofei, you’re so thoughtful!”

She continued,”ruofei, rest for a while. I’ll go and see your uncle song!” He can’t get out of bed now, and he can’t be without someone by his side!”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”you can go!” Don’t worry about me, I also need to prepare in advance. I’ll start treating uncle song after lunch. ”

Fang Liyun nodded and said to Song Wei,”Wei Wei, you stay here and see if RUO Fei needs any help. You can help too.”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but cheer in his heart, and his impression of his future mother – in – Law rose sharply.

Song Wei sneaked a glance at Xia ruofei and knew that he was secretly happy under his serious appearance. She could not help but feel her face heat up. She quickly pretended to be calm and said,”I know ...”

Fang Liyun bade Xia ruofei goodbye and left the guest room.

Xia ruofei and Song Wei looked at each other. Song Wei couldn’t help but laugh and said,”What are you planning?”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”what wicked idea can I have?” I just feel that mother – in – Law is too cute!”

“You’re not allowed to call me that!”Song Wei said in a low voice. Who’s your ... That?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”that’s true!” What if this was a habit and he said it in front of her? that would be terrible ... Alright! I’ll just keep this respectful address in my heart!”

“Not even in my heart!” Song Wei looked like a little girl who was throwing a tantrum. She looked very cute.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but hug her and said,””Weiwei ...”

“Hmm ...” Song Wei let out a soft moan through her nostrils and leaned her head against Xia ruofei’s broad chest. She mumbled as if she was sleep talking,”if only time could stop flowing ...”

Xia ruofei was also mesmerized by the beauty of this moment. He gently stroked Song Wei’s hair and said,””Weiwei, everything will be fine. In the future ... Your parents will definitely accept me. I won’t let you continue to live without a title ...”

“This ...” Song Wei frowned.”This is too difficult!”

With Xia ruofei’s excellence, he was definitely a good match for Song Wei. The problem was that he had two women at the same time. This was unacceptable in today’s society. Moreover, song Qiming was a high – ranking leader. If this was exposed, it would definitely be a big family scandal!

How could they possibly accept it? Song Wei did not even dare to think about it.

Xia ruofei’s eyes were firm as he said,”people think of ways. I always believe that strength determines one’s status.” If I can’t let you guys be with me openly for the time being, it must be because I’m not strong enough. I believe that one day, we will be able to ignore all worldly customs!”

“En!” Song Wei was also affected by Xia ruofei’s emotions. She nodded heavily. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,””You just said that you wanted time to stop. I can’t do that for now, but it’s not a problem to slow down time! Should I? I set up the array flags? This way, you can hug me for as long as you want!”

Song Wei’s face heated up and she struggled out of Xia ruofei’s arms. She said coyly,”Who wants to hug you! Let’s get down to business! You’re not serious!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”being intimate with our Weiwei is the most important thing!”

“You still dare to say that!” Song Wei acted as if she wanted to fight.

After the two of them had a good time, Xia ruofei started to work.

This time, Xia ruofei had brought a complete set of things. Not only did he bring enough medicinal herbs, but he also had the tools for decocting the medicine and even charcoal prepared.

The guest room that Fang Liyun had prepared for Xia ruofei had a door that led to the small garden at the back. It was the best room on the first floor.

This made it easier for Xia ruofei to do things. He directly left the work of brewing the medicine outdoors. If he were to boil the medicine in the room, the smell would not go away for a long time.

Xia ruofei was preparing for the treatment at noon, so he did not have much work to do.

After he started the fire, he skillfully picked out the medicinal herbs and put them into the claypot to boil.

The water was also from the spirit pool. He filled a 2.5 – liter large bottle of mineral water.

Xia ruofei had already considered that he would have to complete these tasks in the song family. Hence, he had prepared everything he could think of in advance and tried not to use the spirit map space here.

Song Wei stood at the side and helped. Of course, she was mainly Xia ruofei’s helper, such as passing things and Fanning the fire.

It was not tiring for a man and a woman to work together, let alone a couple who loved each other. Therefore, the two of them enjoyed the boring process of boiling the medicine.

The pot of medicine ended up with a small bowl of paste – like ointment. Xia ruofei took out a small mineral water bottle from his bag and poured some water in. He mixed it well and then sealed the bowl with a preservation film.

This small bottle of water was naturally filled with the petal solution of the spirit Heart Flower, and the concentration was not low.

“Success!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Song Wei took out a tissue and wiped the sweat off Xia ruofei’s forehead. “You’ve worked hard!”

Xia ruofei laughed and grabbed Song Wei’s hand.””Then give me a reward!”

Song Wei blushed and asked in a low voice,””What kind of reward?”

Xia ruofei pointed at his face and winked at Song Wei.

Song Wei was a little shy, but at the same time, she looked nervously in the direction of the door. Finally, she mustered up her courage.

She stood on her tiptoes and slowly moved her lips closer to Xia ruofei’s cheek.

Although they had tried all kinds of embarrassing positions when they were in the spirit body joint cultivation, Song Wei rarely had any intimate actions with Xia ruofei in the outside world. Moreover, they were in her own home. She was more or less shy and could not help but close her eyes tightly.

At first, Song Wei wanted to give him a light kiss, but Xia ruofei turned his face away and ...

Their lips were locked in a kiss. Song Wei felt something was wrong and opened her eyes.

Song Wei’s beautiful face instantly turned red. She subconsciously wanted to retreat and escape. However, the experienced Xia ruofei had already grabbed her delicate waist and held her tightly in his arms ...
