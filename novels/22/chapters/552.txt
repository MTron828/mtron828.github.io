Chapter 553: Chapter 429 – respect me (1)

When boss Qian heard this, he couldn’t help but say in surprise,””Boss Xia, so you’re Li Jun’s comrade after all the talking! Hey, this whole thing is ...”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Boss Qian ... No, uncle Qian, I haven’t seen Li Jun in five to six years. I don’t really dare to recognize him now that we’ve just met.”

“Five or six years?” boss Qian asked, puzzled. Our Li Jun has only been discharged from the Army for four years!”

Qian Lijun said with a smile,”dad, ruofei was selected to join the Special Forces not long after he joined the company. Hi!” You won’t understand even if I tell you this. Anyway, RUO Fei was our company’s big star back then! When he was transferred away, the company commander and the instructor personally organized a Grand farewell ceremony!”

“That’s all in the past,”Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.

“I remember it very clearly!” Qian Lijun said again. Among our batch of recruits, you’re the most promising one! I heard from the platoon leader that you’ll be promoted in a few years. ”

When he said this, Qian Lijun revealed a strange expression and asked, “That’s right, ruofei. Why did you leave the Army too? Back then, everyone said that you would definitely be promoted. Maybe our company would even have a general!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”It’s a long story. I only completed my second rotation. I came back before I completed my second rotation.”

Qian Lijun’s expression changed slightly as he asked, “What’s wrong? You ... Did you make a mistake?”

“No, I didn ‘t!” Xia ruofei said,”I asked for it ... It’s a long story. I’ll tell you more about it when I have time.”

Qian Lijun smiled and said,”sure! Now that we’re in contact, let’s keep in touch more in the future! RUO Fei! Don’t leave today, I don’t have anything else here, but I have enough wine! I’ll ask them to get some game later. Today, I’m going to drink all the wine that I haven’t drunk in all these years!”

When boss Qian heard this, he quickly said,””Yes, yes, yes! Boss Xia ... Well, you’re Li Jun’s comrade, so I’ll have to call you Xiao Xia ...”

“Alright, uncle Qian, that’s called friendly!”

“Okay, Xiao Xia and President Lin, since you’re here today, Xiao Xia and our Lijun are good comrades. You should let me do my part as the host, right?” Boss Qian laughed and said.

President Lin thought for a moment and said,”okay!” Then let’s have a good chat today!”

Xia ruofei and Qian Lijun were reunited and had a lot to talk about. Naturally, he didn’t have any objections.

“Come on, President Lin, ruofei, let’s talk inside!” Qian Lijun said excitedly.

The group of people followed boss Qian and his son into the small building and took their seats in the large living room on the first floor. Qian Lijun made tea for everyone and asked with a smile,””Oh right, ruofei, what business did you come here to discuss with my dad?”

“I’m here to look for uncle Qian for technical support,”Xia ruofei said.

Boss Qian briefly explained to Qian Lijun what they had just discussed. Then, he said to Xia ruofei,”Xia, since you’re Li Jun’s comrade, we can’t accept the processing fee. We have plenty of manpower now anyway. We’ll send you an experienced master to help you tomorrow. Don’t mention the money!”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”no way!” Uncle Qian, these are two separate matters. People say that there’s no father and son in business! This is normal business behavior. You don’t have to do this. ”

Qian Lijun placed the teacup in front of Xia ruofei and pretended to be angry.”RUO Fei, aren’t you slapping your brother’s face? It’s not a big deal! Isn’t it just a technician? Do you think our family can ask you for money?”

Although Qian Lijun had only been in the same unit as Xia ruofei for about half a year, including the three months he had spent in the recruit company, Xia ruofei had always taken care of him. So many years had passed, and Qian Lijun was still very grateful.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Li Jun, you can’t say that. Since it’s business, we should follow the rules of business!” Besides, don’t you have to pay your technicians?”

“Ruofei!” Qian Lijun said. You don’t have to argue with me about this. Do we need to be so clear about the relationship between us old comrades? It’s fine if we don’t have enough manpower during the Dendrobium harvesting season, but our family’s Dendi is basically done, and the technicians in the factory are free, so it’s no big deal to give you some help!”

“I know,” Xia ruofei said. How about this! Uncle Qian, Li Jun, this time, we will settle the processing fee as we have just agreed. Didn’t I tell you after that? From now on, I will have iron – Skin Dendrobium that need to be processed into maple leaves all year round. After your old master is there, please help me train a few skilled workers. When our people can take charge of a region, I won’t have to trouble you! Before that, it doesn’t matter if it’s a processing fee or a technical consultation fee, we’ll just settle it normally. What do you guys think?”

“No... Ruofei, if your people want to learn skills, send them directly to my factory!” Qian Lijun said,”I’ll definitely arrange for the best master to teach them! It’s not that hard to make a maple fight, the key is the technique and the heat control. As long as you’re not stupid, you’ll definitely be able to learn it!”

Boss Qian also smiled and nodded.””Yup! Ruofei, if that’s the case, why don’t you just send someone over to learn!”
