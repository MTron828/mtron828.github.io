Chapter 484: Core rune_2

Xia ruofei greeted Cao tieshu, who was having his meal, and asked his wife to help him make a few dishes. Then, he brought Feng Rao and Qin Xiaojun to an empty table and sat down.

Of course, Xia ruofei also paid for his meals. The entire company was his. He would put food in his left pocket and take out food from his right pocket. Naturally, he was happy to set an example.

Very quickly, Cao tieshu’s wife served a few home – cooked dishes. Xia ruofei, Feng Rao, and Qin Xiaojun chatted as they ate.

“By the way, President Feng, I remember that we still need to recruit two directors, right?” Xia ruofei asked,”did you find anything in the past two days?”

“It’s not easy to hire someone at the director level in the talent market,”Feng Jing said. However, I’ve worked in several big companies before and have some connections. I’ve been contacting around these few days and have a few suitable candidates, but it’s not easy to make them make up their minds. ”

Xia ruofei nodded in understanding. He knew that paradise Corporation was not attractive enough. There was no need for a director to work in a small company like this.

“Thank you for your hard work, President Feng.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”just do your best! If it really doesn’t work, we’ll look for a headhunting company. In short, we’ll first set up the framework of the company’s administrative team, and it’ll be much more convenient for us to work in the future. ”

“Alright,” he said. Feng ke said.

“Chairman, when are we going to the village committee to talk about renting land?” she asked.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””We’re all old acquaintances in Dongkeng village, so we can meet up at any time. Let’s do this! You should go to the job fair as usual tomorrow. Isn’t the interview the day after tomorrow? Then let’s go to the village council the day after tomorrow and try to finalize the land lease within a day!”

“Alright!” Feng Jing nodded.

After dinner, Feng Jing informed Xia ruofei and went upstairs to her office.

Although it was already late at night, Feng Jing had no intention of resting. She had to organize the resumes she received today and check out the online recruitment. She also needed to get in touch with the director candidate and prepare for the interviews in a few days.

Feng Jing was a standard strong woman who worked day and night. Moreover, she was now living in an apartment on the third floor. It could be said that the company was her home.

Xia ruofei was very pleased with Feng Jing’s enthusiasm. He did not say anything about not working at night. At the beginning of the company, it was normal to work overtime. Xia ruofei would not try to dampen Feng Jing’s enthusiasm at this time.

After Feng Jing left, Xia ruofei pulled Qin Xiaojun aside and asked him about the recruitment fair in detail. Of course, he was mainly asking about the safety issues.

Qin Xiaojun told Xia ruofei everything he knew.

Xia ruofei understood that Feng Rao and her group did not encounter any problems during the day. He pondered for a moment and then asked Qin Xiaojun to call Lei Hu over.

“Hu Zi! Tell Hong Tao to retreat!” Xia ruofei said,”you guys will have to work hard tonight. Strengthen the patrol!” During the day ... Pay attention to any suspicious people around the farm. If you find anything, don’t alert the enemy and report to me at any time!”

“Yes, brother Xia!” Lei Hu immediately said.

Xia ruofei patted Lei Hu’s shoulder, then walked out of the staff canteen and returned to his small villa.

After Xia ruofei returned to his room, he did not rush into the spirit map space.

He first took out the small booklet from the stone room in the new space, then calmed his mind and began to study the third page about the refining of the core of the spiritual puppet.

Especially the mysterious runes that had to be carved by himself. Xia ruofei studied them repeatedly and did not miss any details.

His mental power was already very condensed, and the corresponding brain development was also far beyond the average person. If it was an ordinary book, even if he didn’t have a photographic memory, he could at least read it two or three times, and he would definitely remember every detail.

However, the contents recorded in the booklet were very mysterious, especially the core runes. Sometimes, two runes that looked the same might have many differences in the depth, curvature, and other details.

The core rune was divided into several independent parts, and each part needed to be carved in one stroke. Otherwise, the whole piece of material would be wasted. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

With such high requirements and difficulty, Xia ruofei naturally did not dare to let his guard down. He spent two hours and finally managed to engrave every detail and angle of the core rune in his mind.

Next, he could start carving.

However, Xia ruofei was not a hotheaded person. The sheep – Fat white jade was so precious that he naturally could not use it to carve right away. He would definitely need to practice a little at the start.

Xia ruofei was prepared for this.

When he was strolling around the Jade Market today, he had bought some cheap ordinary Jade. In order to practice better, he had chosen some white jade as much as possible. He believed that once he was familiar with white jade of similar materials, the chances of failure would be minimized when he tried to carve on the highest quality sheep – Fat white jade.

Other than buying ordinary white jade, Xia ruofei also bought a few good carving knives.

He didn’t enter the spirit map space, but started practicing in his room.

Xia ruofei was sitting on a chair. There was a cloth bag on the coffee table beside him. It was filled with white jade that was about 10 centimeters in diameter. As for the booklet, Xia ruofei had already put it back into the spirit map space. He had already memorized the core runes of the spiritual puppet, so he naturally did not need the booklet anymore.
