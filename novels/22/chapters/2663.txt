2664 A decision made in one word_3

Xia ruofei said happily,”that’s even better!” The old leader was very thoughtful! With the old company commander, brother Liu, and the others, the guard team’s training work was like adding wings to a Tiger! It’s decided! I’ll give everyone my phone number later. After you’re done with your vacation, you can come to San Shan to find me!”

Guo Zhan thought for a moment and said,”I suddenly thought of a problem!” RUO Fei, you said that your Paradise Island is overseas, but Ma Jia and the others are active soldiers. They can’t leave the country at will before completing the transfer procedures. And even after changing jobs, according to our unit’s confidentiality level, the period of confidentiality is at least five years ... It seems that working abroad is not possible!”

“There shouldn’t be a problem,” Xia ruofei said with a smile. That Paradise Island was a little special. In terms of sovereignty, he belongs to the agate map of the South Pacific island, but he has transferred his permanent ownership, or the right to use, to me. Also, there are docks and airports on Paradise Island, so we don’t need to go through any entry procedures to go to Paradise Island. It was a bit like an enclave in some Western countries, but this land belonged to me and not the country. Therefore, strictly speaking, even though Paradise Island is tens of thousands of miles away, going there isn’t considered going out of the country, so it shouldn’t be considered a violation of the policy. ”

Guo Zhan raised his eyebrows in surprise and said, “There’s such an operation? I thought I was being thoughtless just now ... But considering how big your business is in the country, it’s not a problem to arrange a few old comrades. At most, we can just go to your peach source Island. ”

“Of course, I’ve considered all these factors before coming to you to ask for her.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“That’s good!” Guo Zhan said happily,”come, ruofei, I’ll give you a toast! Thank you for solving my problem!”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”Wolf King, I should be the one toasting you!” You should be the one who helped me solve the big problem!”

“Hahaha! It didn’t matter who he respected! Let’s go!” Guo Zhan said with a hearty smile.

Xia ruofei and Guo Zhan clinked their glasses, raised their heads, and drank the drink in their glasses.

Guo Zhan glanced at ma su beside Xia ruofei and saw that his expression seemed to be a little conflicted. He couldn’t help but say,””Little ma! What are you still worried about?”

“Captain ... This ... Going to such a far island ... Is it really not considered a violation of the rules?” Ma Jia asked with hesitation.

“What are you worried about, kid?” Guo Zhan cursed,”ruofei has already made it very clear. It won’t violate the policy at all! Besides, don’t you know what kind of person you are? Even if you’re outside the country, will you betray your country and sell out your secrets?”

“Of course not!” Ma Jia didn’t even think about it and said,”even if I, Ma Jia, leave the Army, I will never forget the oath I made in front of the military flag when I joined!”

“Then isn’t it settled?” Guo Zhan said,”you’ve only been a political cadre for a few years. How did you get the bad habit of being so fussy?”

Xia ruofei almost laughed out loud. Wu Jiasong, who was sitting opposite him, did not know whether to laugh or cry. He was the political instructor of the company, a standard political cadre. Guo Zhan’s attack had affected him too.

“Understood!” Ma Jia raised her head and said. Great captain, I was wrong!”

“Don’t think about those things! If there’s a problem, I’ll be responsible for it!” Guo Zhan said.

“I’m just worried that you’ll be implicated!” Ma Jia immediately said,”if you transfer to a new unit, everything will be unfamiliar. If anything happens, you won’t be able to handle it ...”

“Nonsense!” Guo Zhan said without mercy,”if you guys are worried that I will be implicated, then work hard at RUO Fei’s place. As long as you don’t cause any trouble, I will be fine, understand?”

“Yes!” Ma Jia and the other three replied in unison.

They didn’t say anything more, but their eyes showed that they were touched. Everyone could feel Guo Zhan’s care and love for them.

Guo Zhan glanced at ma su and said,”I think that Ma Jia is the only one who is wavering! How about this ... Didn’t RUO Fei just say that he had arranged work for your family? Call Xiao Lin now! Tell her about this and ask her to quit her job in her hometown as soon as possible!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Ah? Are we going to fight now?” Ma Jia said,”this ... Isn’t this a little too rushed?”

“Let’s fight now!” Guo Zhan said without any room for discussion.

Guo Zhan’s authority in the lone wolf assault team was Supreme. Ma Jia didn’t dare to say no. He obediently took out his mobile phone and called his wife.

When everyone saw Ma Jia making the call on the spot, they all quieted down.

The call was quickly connected. Ma Jia said with a nervous look,””Wife, what are you doing? You’re off work, right? I’m having lunch. Is everything okay at home?”

Guo Zhan saw that Ma Jia didn’t talk about the main topic for a long time, so he directly stretched out his hand and said,”Give me the phone!”

“Wife, wait a moment!” Ma Jia quickly said. Captain Guo will tell you!”

With that, Ma Jia obediently passed the phone to Guo Zhan, Xia ruofei in between.

Guo Zhan didn’t stand on ceremony. After taking it, he directly turned on the speaker and put the phone on the dining table. Then, he shouted in his loud voice,”Sister – in – Law, I’m Guo Zhan!”

Ma Jia’s wife’s voice came from the phone,””Brother Guo, Hello! Did Ma Jia make a mistake in the Army? Don’t be polite, if he makes a mistake, you can hit and scold him however you want!”

Xia ruofei was busy dealing with a piece of red braised meat. It was the best red braised meat for the fat pursuer. Xia ruofei had not eaten it for a few years and missed the taste. After he heard Ma Jia’s wife’s words, he almost laughed out loud. He quickly swallowed the meat in his mouth and then took two tissues to cover his mouth. He interrupted and laughed silently.

Wu Jiasong, Zhong Lin, and Liu mingtian didn’t make a sound either, but their bodies were also trembling. It was obvious that they couldn’t hold it in any longer.

Xia ruofei had never thought that the old company commander’s wife would have such a fierce side. In his impression, Ma Jia had always been an awe – inspiring company commander, but now his image was completely destroyed ...
