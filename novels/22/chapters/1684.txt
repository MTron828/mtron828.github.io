Chapter 1685: Chinese Kungfu (1)

The next morning, Australian Airlines arranged for a bomber business jet to send Xia ruofei, Feng Jing, and some of the investigation team members to Australia.

Director li was a little worried and personally accompanied Xia ruofei.

Sitting on the comfortable leather seat of the business jet, Feng Rao looked at the blue sky outside the cabin and smiled at Xia ruofei.””I thought we could have some fun since the heavens arranged for us to land in Saipan! I didn’t expect you to leave so soon ...”

Xia ruofei teased,”weren’t you in a hurry yesterday?” Why don’t we turn the plane back?”

“You think you’re taking a taxi?” Feng Rao chuckled. Do you think the plane can turn around just like that? Besides, I’m just casually complaining. I’m here for work, not for sightseeing!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”then we’ll come to Saipan when we’re done with our work in Australia.” You can play for as long as you want, and the company will reimburse you!”

“You said it yourself!” Feng Rao said with a smile.

After the plane entered the cruising stage, Alex walked over with two glasses of wine. He handed one to Xia ruofei and smiled.””Mr. Xia, try the most famous Semillon wine in the Hunter Valley area of Australia!”

Tony, the Senior Vice President of Australian Airlines, was in charge of the investigation in Saipan. Since Xia ruofei had landed, Alex had been receiving him. Therefore, Tony had sent Alex to accompany Xia ruofei throughout the trip.

Feng Rao couldn’t help but chuckle and said,”Mr. Alex, Mr. Xia has a farm and two wineries in the Hunter Valley area. His wineries are rich in Semillon!”

Alex was stunned for a moment before he laughed awkwardly.””Mr. Xia, you have a business in Australia! I have to say ... There are a lot of rich people in China these days. You can see Chinese people waving checkbooks everywhere in Australia to buy farms and wineries!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”in recent years, China’s economy can be said to be the only one in the world. When the people are rich, they will naturally go out of the country to look for investment opportunities. This is very normal!” However, I’m in the agricultural industry in China, and I have my own farm in China. Investing in the Hunter Valley area can be considered an industrial expansion!”

Xia ruofei knew that many Chinese people who came to Australia to buy farms were either nouveau riche or had been tricked by the agency. Many people were deceived by the low price and ended up buying a lot of low – Quality farms.

In Australia, all the crops grown on a farm had to be strictly approved. If it was a Ranch, there was even more to it. The number of livestock per acre on a Ranch was regulated by the relevant government departments. If the livestock exceeded the land’s capacity, the owner could even be charged with animal abuse.

Therefore, a farm’s climate, soil, geographical environment, precipitation, and so on had a very important impact on its nutrient capacity. This also led to a huge difference in the price of farms, ranging from thousands of Australian dollars per acre to a dozen or even a few Australian dollars per acre.

There were even farms that sold the entire farm at a symbolic price of one Australian dollar, which was basically barren land and far away from the populated areas.

There were some Chinese tycoons who did not understand the market. After buying the ranches for a cheap price, they found out that according to the rules, only one cow could be raised for every 200 acres of the ranches. There were too many examples of them crying without tears when they suffered a loss.

However, in front of a foreigner, Xia ruofei naturally could not expose the shortcomings of his own people. Thus, he only glossed over Alex’s obviously teasing words.

“Mr. Xia, you’re so young, but you’re already so successful in your career. I’m impressed!” Alex raised his glass to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei clinked his glass with his and started to talk about other topics.

However, the fact that Xia ruofei had a farm and two wineries in Australia did make Alex’s heart skip a beat. He didn’t show it, though, and only kept his thoughts to himself. After all, there were some things that he couldn’t make the decision on.

After about seven hours of flight, Xia ruofei’s official jet landed smoothly at Kingford Smith Airport in sutteni, Australia.

The group did not leave the restricted area of the airport. Instead, they boarded a shuttle bus prepared by quis on the tarmac and headed to a hangar.

Qintani’s Kingsford Smith Airport was the main base of qintais. It had their own exclusive hangar and the best support facilities. Today’s strange experiment was held in one of qintais ‘hangars.

In a short while, the shuttle bus arrived at the entrance of the garage.

Xia ruofei did not see the familiar Airbus A350. The Australian Airlines were not crazy enough to carry out the experiment on the plane. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

This was because once the cockpit door was violently damaged, not only would the door have to be repaired, but the aircraft would also have to undergo a comprehensive inspection to prevent metal fatigue or circuit problems. The amount of work required would be huge.

Therefore, the engineers of Quto and Airbus took turns working overtime last night to dismantle the door from the plane and then installed it in a one – to – one simulation cabin in the morning.

All the installation standards were the same as real airplanes.

Xia ruofei and the others walked into the hangar. The first thing they saw was a simulation cabin fixed on a shelf.

This cabin only had the front part of the cockpit, and the aircraft’s skin had not been installed, directly exposing the skeleton. Standing outside, one could also see the test process.
