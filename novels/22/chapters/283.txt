Elder song’s face changed when he saw the White gauze on the back of li Zhifu’s head, and some blood was faintly visible. From the moment elder song entered the shop, the two of them had been standing face to face. In addition, the light in the shop was not very bright. The only light source was the old table lamp on Niu Yusheng’s work desk, so elder song did not notice it at first. Li Zhifu turned around and walked a few steps. There was a street lamp on the door that led to the stairs at the back of the shop. Elder song saw it clearly. In addition to the White gauze, elder song also found some small bruises on li Zhifu’s face and arms. He frowned slightly and asked anxiously,””Brother Fu, what’s wrong? Why are you injured?” Li Guizhi’s eyes turned red when she heard that. She couldn’t help but say,”Uncle song, my dad ...” “Little song, I accidentally fell down yesterday!” Li Zhifu interrupted Li Guizhi and said,”it’s not a big deal. They’re just external injuries.” After saying that, he looked at Li Guizhi sternly. Li Guizhi bit her lower lip and didn’t say anything in the end. Elder song had been in the system all his life and had reached the top position of a civil servant. How could he be bad at observing people? He could tell at a glance that li Zhifu was hiding something. However, elder song didn’t point it out. He looked at li Zhifu and Li Guizhi thoughtfully, then said,””Brother Fu, you must be careful! You’re over ninety this year, right?” “Hehe, my virtual age is 93!” Li Zhifu said with a smile. “Yup! He’s already in his 90s, and his body can’t be compared to a young man ‘s. What if something bad happens to him from the fall?” Elder song said. “I see, little song. I’ll be careful in the future.” Li Zhifu chuckled. Let’s go upstairs and sit!” The group of people went upstairs. This shop belonged to Niu Yusheng’s family. It was a three – story building. The first floor was used as a shop, while the second and third floors were for people to live in. There was a small living room and a bedroom on the second floor. For the convenience of the elderly, Niu Yusheng and Li Guizhi gave the master bedroom on the second floor to li Zhifu, while the two of them stayed on the third floor. Li Zhifu happily asked everyone to sit down. Then, he personally opened the box and took out a tin can from the bottom of the box. He smiled and said,”Little song, I’ll treat you to a taste of my handmade Da Hong Pao!” “Alright!” Elder song said happily,”brother Fu, I haven’t tasted the tea you made in 30 years. I can’t stop thinking about it!” “Then you’ll have to taste it today!” Li Zhifu said,”I can’t even bear to drink this tea myself! Little song, although my Da Hong Pao didn’t come from one of the six mother trees, it was the first generation of Da Hong Pao, which was grown by cutting from the branches of the mother tree. It’s still very precious. ” Elder song laughed and said,”brother Fu, no matter how precious the tea is, it’s not as precious as your craftsmanship!” This high – quality tea leaves, when matched with your ancestral tea – making skills, that’s called bringing out the best in each other!” Li Zhifu chuckled. He carefully took out some tea leaves from the tin can and began to make tea with great familiarity. Xia ruofei watched from the side and couldn’t help but ask curiously,””Old Mister li, these tea leaves are curved and look a little like dragons. However, why is it that the tea leaves are all black in color, but why is it called Da Hong Pao?” Before li Zhifu could say anything, elder song laughed and said,”Little Xia, the red in Da Hong Pao doesn’t refer to the color of the tea leaves. There’s a story behind it!” Then, elder song said to li Zhifu,””Brother Fu, why don’t you tell Xiaoxia about it?” Li Zhifu nodded and began to explain. It turned out that there was a rumor that a scholar had gone to the capital to take an examination. When he passed by Mount Wu Yi, he fell ill. He was coincidentally met by an Abbot who brought him back to the temple to be treated. The abbot plucked the leaves of the tea tree from the Jiulong nest and made tea for the scholar to drink. After a few days, the scholar recovered and entered the capital to take the examination for being the top student in high school. Therefore, he came back to repay his abbotship. At the same time, he brought tea leaves to the capital to offer to the Emperor. It just so happened that the Emperor was sick at this time and couldn’t be cured no matter what. Later, he drank this tea and his illness was cured. So the Emperor bestowed a red robe and asked the scholar to wear it on a tree. At the same time, he gave it the title of Imperial tea and offered it as tribute every year. Later on, this tea was known as Da Hong Pao. Xia ruofei and song Rui were both fascinated by the story. When li Zhifu finished, Xia ruofei sighed.””I didn’t expect the Dahongpao tea leaves to have such a story ...” Elder song laughed and said,”there is no way to verify the authenticity of this legend. However, Dahongpao is extremely precious. When the chairman met the American president who visited China, he once gave 4 taels of Dahongpao as a gift. At first, the American thought that the chairman was stingy. He only gave 4 taels of Dahongpao tea! Later, the Prime Minister explained that this high – Quality Da Hong Pao only produces 8 taels a year, and giving him 4 taels is equivalent to giving him half of the country!” Although elder song had not been a high – ranking official in the past, he was very familiar with these anecdotes, which were very fascinating. Li Zhifu also smiled and said,”speaking of Da Hong Pao, it was a tribute tea in the past!” It’s also said that in one of the gongna Qianlong’s gift lists, there was a record of ‘Biluochun 20 Jin, Longjing 30 Jin, and Dahong Pao 8 taels’. From this, we can see how precious Dahong Pao is. ” Although li Zhifu was an old farmer who didn’t speak much, when he talked about his ancestral tea business, he could speak like a river. Xia ruofei chimed in.”Old Mr. Li, I’ve also heard that a few years ago, a 20 – gram Da Hong Pao was auctioned for a sky – High price of 208000 Yuan!” “That’s right. “Li Zhifu nodded with a smile. “However, the Da Hong Pao tea leaves we are talking about are the true Da Hong Pao parent trees. After 2007, in order to protect the six parent trees, the government had ordered a stop to harvesting them. Therefore, we can no longer drink such high – quality tea leaves.” “But brother Fu’s Da Hong Pao was the first generation of Da Hong Pao, which was reproduced asexually from the mother tree. With brother Fu’s own handiwork, I’m sure it’s not much worse than the mother tree’s Da Hong Pao!” Elder song said with a smile. “We can’t compare, we can’t compare ...” Li Zhifu said modestly. While everyone was chatting, li Zhifu’s hands didn’t stop. Soon, the tea was ready. He poured a small cup for everyone, then smiled and said,””Come, come, come, have a taste! If you taste it carefully, you will find that the tea of our Wu Yi mountain has a ‘rock rhythm’, which other tea leaves don’t have!” At that moment, there was a sudden knock on the door downstairs. Li Zhifu slightly frowned and said,””Yusheng, can you go down and see what’s going on?” “Alright!” Niu Yusheng immediately stood up and went downstairs. “Come, come, come, Let’s Drink Tea!” Li Zhifu continued to greet him. Xia ruofei and the others picked up their teacups and took a sip. Even if he didn’t know much about tea, he could still feel that this Da Hong Pao was extraordinary. It was slightly bitter in the mouth, but the sweetness returned very quickly and it was quite rich. Just as everyone was tasting the tea, the sound of quarrels came from downstairs. Niu Yusheng’s angry and loud voice was especially obvious ...
