2358 Cleaning up_Bao Guijun only felt the world spin and then he was shocked to find that he was no longer in the mobile house and his surroundings were very dark.

There was no day or night in the spirit map space. Ever since they were captured into the spirit map space, they had never seen the sky turn dark. Even when they were sleeping, it was still bright outside. So Bao Guijun was not used to it.

However, he soon found out that he was very familiar with the environment here. When Youyou first joined the modr organization, he had undergone a long period of demonic training in the training camp in Basoko town, so he was very familiar with the surrounding environment.

“Don’t be surprised!” Xia ruofei’s calm voice came from behind him.”Hurry up and start working!”

Bao Guijun turned around and realized that Xia ruofei was standing behind him.

“Master!” He quickly bowed respectfully.

At this time, Bao Guijun’s heart was surging with excitement. In fact, during the days they had lived in the spirit map space, they had faintly felt that the place they were in seemed to be isolated from the outside world. Even though the environment there was more beautiful, it looked no different from the outside world. There was even a boundless sea, but they could still feel a slight difference from the outside world. For example, there was no day and night there.

In reality, the construction rules of the spirit map’s space were definitely different from the outside world. After all, this was a small space that was man – made, while the outside world was the work of the heaven Earth Law. However, Bao Guijun and the others were ordinary people. They had lived there for a long time and had some vague feelings. However, it was impossible to grasp this feeling and express it accurately.

The experience that night made Bao Guijun even more sure of this.

He had been caught in Sanshan city in Huaxia. In a moment of distraction, he had arrived at that paradise – like place. After shifting the stars again, he had arrived in the African continent, which was thousands of miles away.

In reality, if Bao Guijun were to shout loudly now, it would definitely alert the other sentries on the outer perimeter. However, he didn’t have any such thoughts at all.

He had already betrayed the organization, and if he returned to the organization, he would be punished countless times more severely than death. Furthermore, Xia ruofei’s magical skills had already surpassed the limits of an ordinary person. Bao Guijun could not even muster the will to resist.

Xia ruofei pointed at the two black men who had fainted on the ground and said,””I’ll wake one of them up, and then you’ll help me question them!”

Bao Guijun then noticed the two black men leaning against a tree. Because the visibility was not very high tonight and the two men’s skin was dark, it was not easy to find them without looking carefully.

Bao Guijun took a closer look and exclaimed in surprise,”Pardu?”

“You know these two?” Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and asked.

Bao Guijun pointed to a black soldier on the left and said,”I know this one. He’s called pardu, a permanent guard of the training camp. The other one should be a student. At that time, we were on duty at the outer perimeter. It was also a guard with a student. ”

“Can you communicate?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Yes! Pardu is a local of arulei. I can communicate with them in their native language!” Bao Guijun said without hesitation.

“That’s great!” Xia ruofei said. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Then he gently patted pardu’s head, and he immediately woke up.

Of course, before he could react, Xia ruofei’s majestic spiritual energy attacked him again and he fell into a state of confusion.

“Let’s start!” Xia ruofei said indifferently,”ask for his name first!”

Bao Guijun quickly asked in his local language and looked at pardu curiously.

He was very familiar with Pasu’s state. At that time, they had watched their teammates being interrogated by Xia ruofei. Bao Guijun and the others also guessed that it was a very advanced hypnosis technique. However, after the hypnosis, would it be effective if someone else was questioned?

Bao Guijun quickly got the answer. After listening to Bao Guijun’s question, pardu didn’t hesitate to mumble a long string of strange syllables.

Xia ruofei looked at Bao Guijun.

“Master,” said Bao Guijun awkwardly,”the names of the people here are very long and their pronunciation is very strange. We all called him pardu at that time.”

Xia ruofei nodded. The “spirited Chinese” Dhaka that he had met at Ethiopia’s airport also had a very good name. He thought that Bao Guijun would not dare to lie.

“Continue asking!” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

Then, Bao Guijun acted as Xia ruofei’s translator and continued to ask questions to pardu.

In this state of hypnosis, pardu would tell him everything he knew and would not hold anything back.

In a short while, Xia ruofei had asked all the questions he wanted to ask.

Then he woke up the other black man and finished the interrogation.

Xia ruofei was satisfied with the information he got. He nodded and said, “That’s right ... Old Bao, I hope you’re not lying to me,”

“Master, I promise I’ll translate it word by word. Even if you give me a few more guts, I wouldn’t dare to lie to you!” Bao Guijun quickly said.

Xia ruofei nodded slightly and said,”go back and rest!” When you go back, you can think about what you should say and what you shouldn’t say. “
