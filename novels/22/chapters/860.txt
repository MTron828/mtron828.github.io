Hu Zi’s mother waved her hand.”I’m not going, I’m not going ... I can’t even speak Mandarin, let alone a foreign language. I’ll make a fool of myself ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Godma, there’s no need for foreign language skills to travel overseas these days. Besides, don’t you have me and Qiao’ er?” You can just follow us!”

“I still won’t go!” Hu Zi’s mother smiled and said,”I’ll stay at home. If you’re free, you can take Qiao’ er out ...”

Actually, on one hand, Hu Zi’s mother was a little afraid of the foreign environment. At the same time, the more important reason was that she wanted to save some money for Xia ruofei.

She knew that since Xia ruofei had suggested it, he would definitely bring Lin Qiao out. Besides, Lin Qiao was so happy, so she didn’t want to dampen her daughter’s spirits.

However, a plane ticket to another country would cost ten to twenty thousand Yuan, and the expenses abroad were also very high. That was why she insisted that she didn’t want to go.

“Godmother! Now that Qiao’ er has been admitted to University, you don’t have anything to worry about anymore. It’s time to go out and take a look!” Xia ruofei advised,”many old people travel every year. They’re busy when they’re young, but it’s time to see the beautiful scenery of the world after retirement!”

Hu Zi’s mother waved her hand with a smile.”I don’t want to see any beautiful scenery. I just like to stay at home.” Ruofei, don’t try to persuade me. I really don’t want to go. You can just bring Qiao’ er along!”

Seeing that Hu Zi’s mother was so determined, Xia ruofei turned to Lin Qiao, hoping that Lin Qiao could persuade her.

However, Lin Qiao didn’t try to persuade her mother. She held her mother’s arm and said,””Mom! Then brother ruofei and I will bring back a lot of delicious food for you!”

Hu’s mother chuckled.”Okay, okay, okay. You guys go out and have fun. Just be careful!”

Seeing that the mother and daughter had reached an agreement, Xia ruofei could only shrug his shoulders and stop trying to persuade them.

Lin Qiao quickly glanced at Xia ruofei. Thinking that she would be traveling abroad with Xia ruofei in a few days, and that it would be just the two of them, her little heart began to beat faster and her pretty face became slightly hot.

“Qiao’ er, you’re not angry with me anymore, are you?”Xia ruofei asked.

Lin Qiao was thinking about her own matters when Xia ruofei suddenly spoke. She was shocked and glanced at Xia ruofei guiltily. Then, she waved her hand as if nothing happened.

She said,”Alright, alright, I’m not blaming you!” Serious matters are more important!”

“Hehe, long live your understanding ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Lin Qiao couldn’t help but roll her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,”I won’t talk to you anymore. Everyone is showing off their scores in the classmate group! There are hundreds of messages, I have to go chat with my classmates!”

After that, Lin Qiao went back to her room while scrolling through her phone.

After she closed the door, she put down her phone and let out a long sigh of relief. Then, she gently patted her thumping chest and laughed in embarrassment.

Xia ruofei and Hu Zi’s mother talked for a while before everyone went back to their own rooms. However, Hu Zi’s mother was so excited that she probably could not fall asleep.

Xia ruofei went back to his room and rested for a while. When he woke up at threeo’ clock, he started to think about what gift to give elder song.

After some consideration, Xia ruofei prepared a box of iron maple and two bottles of Drunken Eight Immortals wine with the spirit Heart Flower petal solution.

Xia ruofei had bought these wines from Dingfeng winery before the merger and acquisition. Not only did they have a longer storage time than the Drunken Eight Immortals wine that the winery had sent over later, but they had also added a spirit Heart Flower petal solution. Whether it was the taste or the health effect, the Drunken Eight Immortals wine on the market could not compare to them.

Xia ruofei had considered giving elder song a wild ginseng of the highest quality. However, on second thought, he had already given elder song a wild ginseng of the highest quality. Furthermore, the value of this wild ginseng was too high. Even the head of a hundred – year – old wealthy family, elder song, might not accept it.

In the end, Xia ruofei decided on the Ironhide Kaede bucket and the Drunken Eight Immortals wine as gifts. These couldn’t be bought on the market, and they were very good for the elderly, so they were suitable for elder song.

When it was past FiveO’ clock, Xia ruofei brought the gifts, informed Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao, and left the farm in Knight XV.

Xia ruofei walked along the third ring Road and arrived at the intersection at the foot of Gu Ling. Then, he walked up the mountain road and arrived at Gu Ling courtyard in a short while.

Along the way, there were many sentries who were already familiar with Xia ruofei’s car. In addition, manager Lu had probably given special notice to them, so they let them pass without any checks.

After Xia ruofei parked the car, manager Lu, who had been informed by the Sentry, came downstairs. The two of them exchanged a few words and walked into the building where elder song lived.

Xia ruofei carried the gift and followed manager Lu to the second floor.

Manager Lu brought him to his office and said with a smile,””Xiao Xia, please sit here for a while. The chief is receiving a guest. The chief has instructed us to go directly to the dining room later!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”okay!” Manager Lu, you can go ahead! Don’t mind me. ”

“Alright,” manager Lu nodded.

However, he didn’t leave Xia ruofei behind. Instead, he made Xia ruofei a cup of tea and sat down to chat with him.

From this detail, Xia ruofei could also feel how much elder song valued him. The Secretary was like a weather forecast for the Bureau chief. Manager Lu’s attitude towards him reflected elder song’s impression of him to a large extent.

For someone close to the chief who enjoyed the treatment of a Deputy Department to put down his work and chat with him so that he wouldn’t feel neglected, this already explained the problem.

Xia ruofei arrived at Gu Ling courtyard at around 5:30 in the afternoon. The two of them chatted for a while in the office. Then, a staff member knocked on the door and came in.”Manager Lu, the restaurant is ready. The chief would like to invite Mr. Xia to the restaurant for a meal!”

Manager Lu nodded and smiled at Xia ruofei.””Little Xia, let’s go!”

Xia ruofei also stood up quickly and said with a smile,””Yes, yes, yes, we can’t let the Bureau chief wait for us!”

The two of them walked quickly to the restaurant on the first floor.

When Xia ruofei arrived at the first floor, he saw elder song walking out from another staircase. There was another person accompanying elder song. The two of them were talking as they walked.

Xia ruofei was stunned. The person beside elder song was Lu You’s mother, Tian Huilan.

“So elder song invited Secretary Tian ...” Xia ruofei thought.

Elder song and Tian Huilan also saw Xia ruofei and smiled at him. Xia ruofei quickened his pace and walked over.

“Chief, Secretary Tian!” Xia ruofei greeted him politely.

Tian Huilan smiled and nodded at Xia ruofei. Elder song looked at the gift in Xia ruofei’s hand and said with a smile,””Comrade little Xia, you’re corrupting this old man with gifts again!”

Xia ruofei scratched his head.”With your wisdom, you could have kept the cloak and returned the Cannonball to me.”

Eccentric song couldn’t help but burst into laughter. He stretched out his index finger and pointed a few times, saying,”You little Xia! Speak! What good stuff did you bring this time?”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”They’re all produced by our company. A box of tin can and two bottles of Drunken Eight Immortals wine. They’re not worth much.” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The Ironhide fengdou’s packaging still had the LOGO of the Paradise Corporation, and the Dingfeng winery that produced the Drunken Eight Immortals had half of Xia ruofei’s estimated score. Elder song was also aware of this.

Naturally, he was only joking at the start. After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, he nodded and gestured for the staff to take Xia ruofei’s gift.

“Put the tin bucket away,” elder song said.”Don’t take the wine down. Let’s drink the wine Xia brought for lunch!”

“Yes! Chief!” The orderly said immediately.

The group of people arrived at the restaurant and took their seats. The waiters quickly served the dishes while manager Lu personally opened the Drunken Eight Immortals wine that Xia ruofei had brought.

The alluring aroma of the wine immediately filled the dining room.

“Good wine!” Elder song sniffled and said,”little Xia, if you still have more of this Drunken Eight Immortals, bring me more! After I return to the capital, it’s just right to entertain my old comrades. Those old guys will definitely die of hunger after drinking it, hahaha ...”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei agreed without hesitation.

Then, he froze for a moment and asked in surprise,””Bureau chief, you ... You’re going back to Beijing?”
