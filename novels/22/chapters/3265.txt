This time, the people sent to the moon by the sects were all elites of their respective sects. These people’s psychological quality was not worse than the astronauts, so even though they were in deep space, everyone did not feel too nervous.

In a state of zero gravity, there was no such thing as up or down. Chen Xuan was standing at the entrance of the cockpit. His body was perpendicular to Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue. He peeked at Xia ruofei from the entrance and said with a smile,””Everyone can’t wait. Let’s go!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”everyone, sit tight!”

As he spoke, Xia ruofei’s spiritual power had already extended out. He remotely controlled the black Phoenix flying ship, leaving the 400 – kilometer orbit and continuing to fly higher.

The black Phoenix flying ship was activated, and the five leaslines that connected the Dragon ship’s mass slowly tightened.

Xia ruofei and the rest felt a slight tremor in the spaceship. Then, the spaceship began to move to a higher orbit under the pull of the black Phoenix flying ship.

Under Xia ruofei’s intentional control, the black Phoenix flying boat’s acceleration process was relatively slow. Hence, the pulling rope did not exert too much force.

In the history of human exploration of the Moon, whether it was a manned moon landing or an unmanned exploration, the process of going to the moon was basically the same. It was to change the orbit of the aircraft in the process of revolving around the Earth, so that the orbit would become higher and higher, and the circle would naturally become larger and larger, and finally, it would enter the Earth – Moon transfer orbit. Only then would it decelerate and enter the moon’s orbit.

The black Phoenix flying ship’s journey to the moon was similar. However, as the Earth’s gravity did not affect the black Phoenix flying ship much, the process of raising its altitude was much faster, and the curve was naturally more steep.

Of course, in terms of time, the black Phoenix flying ship had taken more time to reach the moon than any moon exploration in human history.

The reason was very simple. It was simply his speed.

Using a rocket to send a probe or an astronaut to the moon was a continuous acceleration process. For the Apollo 11 manned moon landing mission, in order to enter low – Earth orbit, the rocket had already accelerated to 7.67 kilometers per second, and when it entered earth – Moon transfer orbit, the speed had reached 10.5 kilometers per second. Hence, it took Apollo 11 three to four days to send the astronauts to earth.

On the other hand, although the black Phoenix flying ship was much faster than ordinary commercial aircraft, it was still much slower than the high – thrust rocket. Its advantage was that the array had already offset the influence of gravity, so it did not need to travel at an extremely fast speed to get rid of the Earth’s gravity. It could even fly directly to the moon at a constant speed.

However, no matter what, the straight – line distance of about 300000 kilometers still had to be covered by flying, so it naturally took a little longer.

After the black Phoenix flying ship was activated, all the exploration team members in the Dragon Ship had to do was wait patiently.

There was nothing much to do in the cabin. Many people chose to fix themselves on the wall and take out spiritual crystals to cultivate.

Although Xia ruofei had to control the black Phoenix flying ship, he only had to use a trace of his spiritual power to monitor the flying condition most of the time. This was because the black Phoenix flying ship only had to fly at a constant speed in the direction away from earth.

In fact, from the 400 – kilometer orbit, the black Phoenix flying ship would need more than ten days to reach the traditional earth – Moon transfer orbit at its current speed, which was about 60000 to 70000 kilometers from the moon. In traditional space flights, the further away from earth, the less the effect of the Earth’s gravity. When the spacecraft was about 60000 to 70000 kilometers away from the moon, the moon’s gravity would take the lead. The spacecraft would be captured by the moon’s gravity and fly around the moon. After continuous adjustments, it would finally fly around the moon steadily, in preparation for the next step of landing on the moon.

The black Phoenix flying ship’s array ensured that it would not be affected by gravity, so the journey to the moon was not that complicated. However, the route was basically the same.

In other words, the black Phoenix flying ship would have to drag the Dragon ship’s combined body for more than two hundred thousand kilometers in these ten days.

This process was, of course, very boring.

Moreover, there was nothing in space, so there was no need to choose a flight route, so the control was very simple.

Xia ruofei only needed to make sure that the black Phoenix flying ship was at its maximum speed. It was similar to the ‘cruise control’ of a car, or even simpler, as there was no need to control the steering wheel.

Of course, for safety reasons, they still had to monitor the flight status. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

In fact, although the Dragon Ship had been reduced by a lot, the technology was still very advanced. After a period of learning and practice, everyone was very familiar with the basic control of the spaceship, so everyone had arranged the duty schedule in advance. When the time came, two people would take turns to guard the cockpit and monitor the flight state.

Xia ruofei, on the other hand, had to take care of the black Phoenix flying ship. He had to split a small portion of his mind power at all times.

Of course, to Xia ruofei, this was not tiring at all. He could even divert his attention to other things.

In the initial stages of the flight, considering that they were still relatively close to earth and that there were various satellites, space stations, and experiment modules in orbit, the situation would be more complicated than later. Thus, on the first day, Xia ruofei decided to be on duty personally, and his partner was naturally Ling Qingxue.
