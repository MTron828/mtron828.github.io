“Eh? What’s the matter?” Xia ruofei asked, raising his eyebrows. “Sir, according to our country’s current policies and regulations, all – terrain vehicles are prohibited from getting a license,” the saleswoman said carefully. “In other words, this type of vehicle can only be used in certain situations and can’t be driven on the road. Are you sure you want to buy more?” The saleswoman was also feeling uneasy. She was afraid that the business she had just received would fail again, but she could not hide it from the customer. If she did not fulfill her obligation to inform in advance, there would be disputes and it would be more troublesome. Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Oh, just here?” It doesn’t matter, I didn’t buy it for the road anyway, you can help me get the bill!” The saleswoman was overjoyed and quickly said,””Alright! Please wait a moment, Sir!” Soon, the saleswoman finished writing the bill for Xia ruofei. He went over and paid for the car with his card. The saleswoman immediately led Xia ruofei to the large warehouse behind the store with the receipt. “Sir, I can’t give you a discount because this is a new model.” The saleswoman said as she walked,”but I’ve already tried my best to get it for you within my authority. We’ll give you a set of high – Level outdoor equipment and a full box of diesel.” “Okay, thank you,” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Then, Xia ruofei thought of something else and asked,””By the way, since this car can’t be used on the road, How do I drive it back?” “Sir, we will be responsible for the delivery!” The saleswoman quickly said,”we have a Special Vehicle for transporting all – terrain vehicles.” “I see! Can you arrange it immediately?” Xia ruofei said,”I want to take the car away today.” “No problem!” The saleswoman said,”I’ve already made the arrangements. After you’ve inspected the car, I can help you transport it at any time!” Xia ruofei nodded. Soon, he saw a brand – New mrtr g in the warehouse. The yellow paint was exactly the same as the vehicles used by the US military in the Middle East desert. The warehouse staff, who had been informed in advance, was filling the fuel tank with diesel, and the open cargo hold at the back of the car had been tied with a full set of outdoor equipment, which also had the appearance of desert camouflage. Xia ruofei took a quick look. There were tents, sleeping bags, backpacks, mats, and so on. There were also headlights, bright flashlights, light sticks, windproof lighter, thermos flask, and other small gadgets. Moreover, they were all products from a top international brand. This gift was very sincere. “Sir, would you like to try the car first?” The female sales assistant asked,”we have a small test field here. It’s specially used to test the performance of all – terrain vehicles.” Xia ruofei smiled and shook his head.””There’s no need to try, just load it up! I’m in a hurry. ” Since he had already bought it, what was the need to test it out? Xia ruofei was good at driving all – terrain vehicles in the Army. After seeing the model’s specifications, he had a general understanding of the vehicle’s performance. He had driven it in real battlefields many times. This so – called professional test field was not attractive to Xia ruofei at all. It was the first time the saleswoman had met such a straightforward customer. She quickly called for a car. Soon, a transport vehicle arrived at the entrance of the large warehouse. It was a small transport vehicle, a bit similar to the trailer of the traffic Department, but it had been modified to transport all – terrain vehicles, and the protective measures were more in place. The sound of an electric motor could be heard as the two guide rails of the transport vehicle slowly lowered. The carriage also slowly raised a small slope. A staff member jumped onto the UTV and started the car. He slowly drove it along the guide rails to the transport vehicle’s carriage. Then, a staff member immediately went to fix it and protect it. The carriage was lowered slowly, and the guide rail retracted. The saleswoman handed a bag of information to Xia ruofei and said,””Sir, this is the information, receipt, after – Sales certificate, and spare key related to the purchase of the car. Please keep it well.” “Thank you!” Xia ruofei took the file and said,”I’ll drive in front. You can just get the driver to follow me. The delivery place is not far, not even to Changping County.” “Alright!” Xia ruofei drove the Knight XV out of the parking lot in front of them. The transport truck had also arrived. The two cars left Huaxia Car City one after the other and headed towards Changping County. After leaving the Urban area, Xia ruofei drove and observed the surroundings. At the same time, he looked at the GPS. Soon, Xia ruofei found a suitable place. There was a country road not far ahead. There were mountains on one side and dense bushes on the other. It was a good place to hide. Xia ruofei slowed down and turned on the turn signal in advance. At the intersection, he turned the steering wheel and drove in. Through the rearview mirror, Xia ruofei saw that the transport vehicle was following them. After driving for a few hundred meters, Xia ruofei found an open space and stopped the car. The transport truck naturally stopped as well. The driver rolled down the window and asked,””Sir, why aren’t you moving?” “Let’s unload the car here!” Xia ruofei laughed and gave the driver a cigarette.”It’s not far from here. My people will be here soon. There are no traffic police on this road, so you don’t have to work hard.” The driver was naturally happy and relaxed. He immediately called the two staff members in the car to start working. The carriage slowly rose to an angle and the two guide rails slowly lowered. A staff member climbed up to untie the fixation device and slowly reversed the UTV to the road. The road where they stopped was wider. After the driver gave Xia ruofei a list to sign, he drove the transport truck away. Xia ruofei jumped onto the UTV and drove for a short distance before turning into a small ditch in the forest. This was a piece of cake for the all – terrain vehicle. He carefully observed his surroundings. After making sure that there was no one nearby, he summoned the spirit map scroll from his palm. Xia ruofei held the painting in one hand and pressed the other on the car engine. Then, he used his mind to communicate with the new space. He issued an order. The 4500 – pound lightweight UTV trembled slightly before it disappeared into thin air. Xia ruofei’s mind was constantly sensing the situation inside the new space. When he “saw” UTV land steadily on a flat ground in the new space, he was relieved and kept the spirit map scroll in his palm. Then, he walked back to the village Road, returned to the Knight XV off – Road, and drove back to Paradise Farm. After returning to the villa, Xia ruofei parked the car in the garage and then quickly went upstairs to his room. After locking the door and windows, Xia ruofei summoned the spirit map scroll from his palm and entered the new space with a thought. He couldn’t wait to experience driving an all – terrain vehicle in this new space ... [PS] after 12 o’ clock tonight, the battle of double monthly votes will begin. One vote counts as two votes.
