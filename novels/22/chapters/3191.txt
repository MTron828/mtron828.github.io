3192 The mysterious array_

The technician on duty knew that Xia ruofei’s time was precious, so he did not waste any time. He quickly turned back to the control room, copied the algorithm program from the portable hard disk, and ran it on the supercomputer.

Then, he took the hard disk out of the control room and handed it to Xia ruofei. He smiled and said,””President Xia, we’ve started running the program. You still have four hours. As long as the calculations aren’t too complicated, it shouldn’t be a big problem!”

The technician had made this judgment based on Xia ruofei’s previous program, which had taken more than three hours to complete the calculation. If Xia ruofei did not make too many changes to the program, there should not be too much of a change in the calculation.

In fact, after Xia ruofei’s modification, the calculation volume was much less than before.

Therefore, if nothing unexpected happened, there would be enough time. Xia ruofei was confident about this.

He smiled and said,”then I’ll have to trouble you!” Worker he, I’ll be waiting in the reception room downstairs. Once the results are out, please give me a call!”

“Alright!” The technician, he Gong, smiled and said,”President Xia, I think you might as well go back to the guest house and rest for a while! You can’t even lie down in the reception room. I estimate that it will take at least three to four hours for the results to be out. It’s enough for you to sleep!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”I won’t go back and forth. I’m still young anyway. It’s not a big deal to stay up all night!” Besides ... We’ve already slept for a while in the first half of the night!”

“Alright then!” The technician, he Gong, said,”once the results are out, I’ll call the reception room immediately!”

“Good! Hard work! It’s been hard on you!” Xia ruofei replied politely and left the engine room. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Of course, Xia ruofei was still using his spiritual power to monitor the control room.

The rising Dragon Order was too important, and any negligence was not acceptable.

After returning to the reception room, Xia ruofei explained the situation to Chen Xuan. Then, the two of them used their spiritual power to cover the monitoring room and observe the movements of the guards.

Time passed by.

Every second, the Super computer, the light of Taihu territory, was doing countless calculations.

The sun slowly rose from the East.

At around 7:30 in the morning, the phone in the reception room rang.

Xia ruofei had already used his spiritual power to check. The technician on duty, he Gong, was on the phone. He was slightly happy and walked over to grab the phone.”Hey! He Gong?”

“Yes! President Xia, you’ve completed all the procedures!” The technician, he Gong, said,”the result is a package of encrypted data. I made a copy of it without any changes!”

Xia ruofei had been watching gong he’s every move. He knew that gong he did not do anything unnecessary, nor did he try to save a copy of the data.

“Alright! I’ll be right there!” Xia ruofei said,”what trouble?!”

“You’re too polite!” He Gong said,”I’ve already put it on the work computer outside the control room. You can check or copy it directly. I’ve also cleared the data on the control computer. You can rest assured that it’s confidential!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said.

He called Chen Xuan, Mu Sheng, Liu Mansha, and the others and headed to the computer room.

At this time, the Supercomputing Center hadn’t started work yet, but people who had a shift or were in charge of the next project that required the use of supercomputers had arrived in advance. When everyone saw this large group of people walking in the Supercomputing Center building, they couldn’t help but cast curious looks.

At this time, in addition to engineer he, there were other technical personnel in the control room. Everyone was taking advantage of this short period of time to check the equipment parameters.

Worker he saw Xia ruofei and the others enter through the large glass window. He immediately put down his work and walked out of the room.

“President Xia!”

“Worker he, thank you for your hard work!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Where? The calculation data is already in the shared folder of this computer!” He Gong smiled.”You can just handcuff him!”

As he Gong spoke, he opened the shared folder and pointed at one of the compressed files.

The compressed file was named automatically. Xia ruofei had written the program himself, so he could recognize it at a glance.

Moreover, his power of the will had been covering the control room, which meant that he had seen he Gong operate it with his own eyes. Therefore, there was definitely no problem.

“Thank you!”

Xia ruofei took out a portable hard drive and copied the compressed file onto it. Then, he ran the data – crushing program that he had written on the hard drive and completely deleted the original data on the computer.

Xia ruofei pulled out the hard drive and said,””He Gong! Thank you again! It’s been hard on you last night!”

“You’re welcome!” He Gong said with a smile.

He didn’t say anything about looking for him if there was a problem with the data because the data was automatically generated and compressed by the program. Due to the principle of confidentiality, he couldn’t open the Kasaya without permission. Of course, it wasn’t that easy to open it either. There was a high chance that Xia ruofei would have found out when he tried to open it.

He had also deleted the compressed file on the computer in the control room.

The light of Taihu territory, established by Shenwei, often took on some high – Level confidential business, so there was a fixed process for the processing of sensitive data. Yesterday, the director of the Center, Cai Songlin, personally instructed that the confidentiality of the data must be kept to the extreme, so he Gong also strictly followed the process and destroyed the data.
