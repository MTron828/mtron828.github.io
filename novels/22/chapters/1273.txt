Xia ruofei quickly checked the room.

Although he believed that Guo Hongjiang would not install a camera in his room to monitor him, it was not wrong to be cautious, especially when it involved the most confidential spirit map and painting. Even if it was at home, Xia ruofei would be extremely careful.

With the power of the will, Xia ruofei’s experience in the military was useless. With the power of the will, even the most advanced pinhole cameras and bugs would be exposed. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

After checking the room, Xia ruofei was sure that there was no audio or surveillance equipment in the room. Then, he checked the door and windows.

After locking the door and windows and closing the curtains, Xia ruofei immediately summoned the spirit painting.

Then, with a thought, he brought the star of Hong Kong into the spirit map.

Xia Qing was currently drying the Cordyceps in the Archean realm. Recently, Xia Qing’s focus had been on the Cordyceps.

When he saw Xia ruofei enter the medium, he quickly stopped what he was doing and came over to greet him respectfully.””Good day, master!”

Xia ruofei nodded and asked,””How’s the collection of aweto coming along these few days?”

Xia Qing said with a bitter tone,””Master, I’m useless. Although I’m already working hard, I’ve only harvested a very small area. It may take a lot of time to harvest all of them.”

Xia ruofei said gently,”don’t worry, slow work makes fine work!”

He had no other choice. The spirit map space was his top secret. Otherwise, he could have hired a few hundred workers to finish it in a few days.

Xia ruofei looked at the Cordyceps that had already been dried on the shelf. There were roughly thousands of them, not including the ones outside. It was clear that Xia Qing had been working very hard these two days.

“Xia Qing, this horse’s hind leg is broken.” Xia ruofei said,”I used a spirit Heart Flower petal on it and it has recovered by more than half. However, its injuries have not fully recovered. I plan to leave it at the Archean realm. Don’t collect the Cordyceps for now. Help me look after this horse.”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing replied respectfully.

The “star of Hong Kong” was taken aback when he was suddenly brought to a completely unfamiliar environment.

However, the spirit Qi here was so dense that it had formed a mist in the air. Although the star of Hong Kong did not know much about this place, he subconsciously liked this environment very much. Therefore, he did not show any anxiety. Instead, he turned his horse around and looked around curiously.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Little guy, I’ll untie you now. But you have to promise me that you’ll stay here obediently. You can’t run around or go crazy. Your leg injury hasn’t healed yet!”

“Star of Hong Kong” naturally did not understand, so Xia ruofei just thought that he was talking to himself.

If it really went out of control, with Xia ruofei’s current cultivation, he could easily control it alone. So, he decided to try and untie it. After all, it was not a good idea to keep it tied up and it was harmful to his health.

Xia ruofei started to untie the rope after he finished speaking.

However, he thought about it and stopped. He looked around and took two boards from the shelf. He modified them with a military dagger and made them into simple splints.

Xia ruofei fixed the two splints on the star of Hong Kong’s injured leg and then continued to untie the rope.

The star of Hong Kong subconsciously wanted to run away, but he immediately felt a huge force pressing down on him, and his whole body could not move.

In fact, Xia ruofei had only used one hand to press on the horse’s back. He had only used a little vital energy and the “star of Hong Kong” was already unable to struggle.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Little guy, don’t run around. Otherwise, I’ll tie you up again!”

Xia ruofei finally let go of her hand.

The “star of Hong Kong” was much more obedient now. It tried to take a step forward and when Xia ruofei didn’t stop it, it followed with its other foot and got off the shelf in two steps.

It tried to walk a few steps after getting off the bed. Because its leg injury had not fully recovered, and there was a splint, its posture was not very natural, but the pain was already very light.

The star of Hong Kong started to act up after trying it out. However, before it could start running, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Now you can only stand, at most take a few steps. If you don’t listen, I’ll tie you up again!”

Although “star of Hong Kong” couldn’t understand Xia ruofei’s words, he understood the threatening look in Xia ruofei’s eyes. It was also shocked by the scene of Xia ruofei’s hand pressing on it, so it immediately became obedient and stopped.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. “You’re quite smart, kid! You can stay here for now! This place will be good for your recovery!”

Then, Xia ruofei turned to Xia Qing and said,””Xia Qing, your task is to take care of it. You must not let it run, and you must pay attention to the injury on its leg.”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing replied without the slightest hesitation.

Although it was only a spiritual puppet used to assist in planting, Xia Qing’s strength was still very great. It was not a problem for her to control a horse.

However, Xia ruofei was still worried. He said,””If you can’t control it, you can contact me with your spiritual sense at any time! It shouldn’t have been here for a long time, probably just a few days! Also, if you need to feed ...”
