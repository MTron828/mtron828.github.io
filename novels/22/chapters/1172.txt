Translator: 549690339

At this moment, the Knight XV SUV drove past. Xia ruofei rolled down the window and asked with a smile,””I saw you two sisters chatting so happily from afar! What are you talking about?”

This time, Lu You and Song Wei both blushed and said in unison,””It’s not your fault!”

“Heh ... I didn’t have to ask ...” Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment.

The two of them burst into laughter at the same time.

The two of them didn’t choose the front passenger seat and sat in the back seat.

The Knight XV SUV roared and left the Chen family restaurant.

After a while, Song Wei looked outside and said,””RUO Fei, you’re going the wrong way, right? If you drive east from jiangbin road, can’t you go to the municipal committee’s family housing area first?”

Xia ruofei’s expression didn’t change as he replied,”really?” I’m not familiar with the road! I’m following the GPS. I thought it was closer to Sanshan University! So ... I navigated to Sanshan University first ...”

Lu You’s eyes revealed a trace of resentment. She bit her lower lip and looked at Xia ruofei’s back. Then, she smiled and said,””Sister Weiwei, Xia ruofei wants to send me back to school so that he can have some time with you ...”

“Don’t talk nonsense!”Song Wei blushed and said.

Actually, that was what Xia ruofei really thought. However, he did not want to use this opportunity to get close to Song Wei. The main thing was that he did not want to be alone with Lu You. He really did not know how to resolve the awkwardness.

Of course, if he had the chance, he could also mention song Rui and the ancient tomb. It was the best of both worlds.

Xia ruofei said innocently,”I’m more wronged than Dou E!” I’m really not familiar with this area. Why don’t we not use the GPS? How about this, you guys show me the way, and we’ll send whoever’s closest to us off first. That should work, right?”

Lu You was both angry and amused as she said,””We’re almost at Sanshan University, what’s there to change? Let’s do this!”

“Yes, sir!” Xia ruofei chuckled to himself and felt his foot stepping on the accelerator lighter.

They arrived at Sanshan University very quickly. Xia ruofei drove directly to the female dormitory where Lu You was staying. He even got out of the car and opened the door for Lu You, looking like a Lackey.

Lu You looked at Xia ruofei with a half – Smile and said in a low voice,””There’s no use hiding from me! You can’t hide forever, hehe ...”

After saying that, Lu You turned around and walked into the dormitory building with light steps.

Xia ruofei shook his head with a bitter smile and returned to the car.

After restarting the off – Road vehicle, only Xia ruofei and Song Wei were left in the car. Lu You had said those half – joking words earlier, so the atmosphere seemed even more awkward.

“Then ... Thank you!” Xia ruofei broke the silence.

Song Wei sat in the back seat and lowered her head slightly. She said softly,””You’re welcome ... I don’t know if I can help you. ”

“I can! Your friends are really capable!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”my company’s headquarters is in Sanshan city. I’ll need their help sooner or later!”

“That’s good ...” Song Wei said.

“Oh, that’s right!” Xia ruofei said,”I still have something to ask you!”

“Speak!” Song Wei raised her head and said.

“Your uncle song Rui ... He’s taken a fancy to your best friend and classmate, Zhuo Yiyi. You should’ve noticed this long ago, right?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Yeah ...” Song Wei pursed her lips and smiled.

“Then I won’t beat around the bush!” Xia ruofei said,”this kid returned to the capital some time ago and is always trying to get close to Zhuo Yiyi. You don’t say, their relationship has really gotten closer, but it seems to be a little off – Track ...”

“He ran off course?” Song Wei was confused.

“Your silly best friend seems to be a little slow when it comes to relationships ... When song Rui came to look for her, she thought that he was her best friend! There’s no sign of them becoming a couple at all, and the hope is getting slimmer and slimmer!” Xia ruofei said with a bitter smile.

Song Wei burst out laughing.

Based on her understanding of Zhuo Yiyi, this was indeed something that this silly girl would do.

Xia ruofei’s expression turned serious as he said,””Song Wei, I know song Rui quite well. He’s not a bad person at heart, just a little spoiled. It’s not a big problem. According to my observation, he’s really in love with Zhuo Yiyi, and he even has the intention of getting married ...”

“I believe you, so you mean ...” Song Wei nodded.

“I’m just thinking that if song Rui continues to chase us like this, it’ll probably be difficult to get any results.” Xia ruofei said,”aren’t you on good terms with Zhuo Yiyi? Besides, you guys usually keep in contact, right? That’s why I wanted to ask you to help me, or to make fun of her and song Rui in that aspect, and then say more good things about song Rui ... You know. ”

“So you want me to be the matchmaker?” Song Wei laughed.

“Oh, right! This is what it means!” Xia ruofei asked,”how is it? Are you going to help me with this?”

Song Wei leaned back in her seat and said with a smile, “What’s in it for me to help? In the end, I didn’t even get any benefits and even turned my best friend into my aunt. Wouldn’t that be a huge loss for me?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”You really reminded me. “If song Rui really ran out of ideas, I think we can let him confess to Zhuo Yiyi. If he’s rejected, I’ll let him tell Zhuo Yiyi that once she’s with him, she’ll become Song Wei’s aunt. That’ll raise their status. I think Zhuo Yiyi might agree to song Rui because of this!”
