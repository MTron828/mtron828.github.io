Chapter 778: Chapter 516 – a turtle in a jar (1)

This buckamp&; The Strider 888 was Xia ruofei’s first cross – Border Battle. He had obtained it after killing an international mercenary hired by a drug trafficking organization.

After he retired, this military dagger, which had drunk the blood of countless enemies, was often used by Xia ruofei for fleshy cutting and Ironhide vessel cutting. It could be said that it was a Pearl covered in dust.

Today, it could finally do what it was supposed to do.

Xia ruofei grabbed kappei Shani’s hair and lifted him up from the ground. Then, he walked a little into the road and into a Bush.

Kappei Yamaguchi, the elite of the intelligence team who had been registered in the military intelligence agencies of various countries, was like a dead dog, unable to resist at all.

After they entered the bushes, Xia ruofei smacked him onto the ground.

Kappei Yamai groaned and quickly glared at Xia ruofei. He said fiercely in broken Chinese,””Chinese! Don’t even think about getting any information from me!” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Xia ruofei sneered and said,””You think too highly of yourself ...”

Shouhei Yamaguchi was stunned for a moment. Before he could understand what Xia ruofei meant, he suddenly felt a chill in his heart.

He slowly lowered his head and saw a military dagger deeply embedded in his chest, leaving only the handle outside.

Kappei Shani’s face was full of disbelief as he looked up at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei then said calmly,””I just want to kill all of you Japanese. What kind of bullsh * t information do you have in your head? what does it have to do with me?”

With that, Xia ruofei reached out and pulled out the dagger.

......

The wound caused by the sharp military dagger split open. When the nerves transmitted the pain to kappei Shani’s brain, he could no longer speak. He could only stare at Xia ruofei.

Kappei Shani felt all his strength being sucked out of his body in an instant. He didn’t even have time to scream before he fell to the ground and fell into eternal darkness.

A large pool of dark red blood formed under his body ...

This Bush was very well hidden, and he did not have to worry about the body being discovered in a short time.

Xia ruofei frowned as he looked at kappei Shani’s body, puzzled.

Why did Yamai kappei kill him without hesitation?

Xia ruofei was sure that he had not given himself away. He was acting like a normal villager. Why would the Japanese be so determined to attack him?

Xia ruofei was deep in thought. Suddenly, his eyes fell on Blackie, who was lying quietly at the side. Suddenly, an idea flashed through his mind and he found the key point.

The problem was most likely with little black!

Kappei Shani was the only Japanese whose face had been captured by the surveillance camera because he had been sitting in the front passenger seat when the van left Sanshan University. He had not left the van until the end.

In other words, after the other Wei nation agents changed cars, kappei Yamai stayed behind.

It was very likely that he had stayed in the city, including killing the unlucky driver and cleaning up the mess.

Moreover, it was possible that kappei Shani had stayed near the scene to Scout for information.

Blackie had appeared frequently in the search and capture. It was hard to say that kappei Yamai had not seen Blackie, so when he saw Xia ruofei walking around with Blackie, he immediately attacked without hesitation.

Even kappei Yamai might have been hiding near the scene of the van to persuade Xia ruofei to come to the scene in person. If that was the case, perhaps kappei Yamai had already remembered Xia ruofei’s appearance.

That was the only possible reason.

If kappei Shani had not discovered anything, he would not have killed an ordinary villager. This would not be conducive to their continued hiding. It did not make sense.

In fact, Xia ruofei’s speculation was basically the truth.

Kappei Yamai had just rushed over from the city. When he saw the police find the van, he knew that the police had found the right direction. He was not sure how long they could hide from the police by changing cars halfway.

Therefore, kappei Yamai immediately came back to report the situation and reminded his companions to speed up the interrogation, find the core experimental data as soon as possible, and leave Huaxia.

The head of the Wei nation Special Agent team, Junyan Inoue, was also very nervous. While increasing the intensity of the interrogation, he also sent out kahei Shani to keep watch.

Kappei Yamai was preparing to find a secret location next to National Road 218 outside and keep an eye on the intersection leading to Xiayang village.

He did not expect to meet Xia ruofei face to face before he even walked out of the farming road.

Kappei Yamai and his team were very smart in hiding their scent. The police could find the truck so quickly, not even an ordinary police dog could do it.

Therefore, the Black Dog that the police had brought had left a deep impression on Kappei Yamaguchi. Of course, he also remembered Xia ruofei’s appearance, who had brought Blackie along for the inspection.

Therefore, kappei Yamai had recognized him as soon as he saw him.

Under such circumstances, no matter how Xia ruofei pretended to be a villager, it would be useless.

On the other hand, kappei Yamai played along and pretended not to notice that something was wrong with Xia ruofei, who was acting as if nothing had happened. After Xia ruofei walked past the intersection, he suddenly launched a sneak attack.

Everything had been perfect.

Unfortunately, shouhei Yamaguchi had miscalculated one thing, which was that Xia ruofei’s reaction ability and intuition for danger were far beyond his estimation.

Not only did Xia ruofei Dodge the DART, but he also used absolute force to subdue him in a very short time. Then, he dragged him to the bushes and killed him with a knife.
