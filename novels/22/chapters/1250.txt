Chapter 1251: It’s too exciting (2)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei followed Feng Rao’s gaze and looked around. He almost fainted from shock.

He glanced at the bed in the bedroom. There was a touch of pink under the duck down quilt, and he could vaguely see a little lace edge.

Xia ruofei rushed out like a spring and stuffed the ‘fish that escaped’ under the blanket. Then, he looked at the surprised Feng Rao and laughed dryly.”The room is too messy. The clothes before the bath are all thrown around ...”

Actually, Feng Jing didn’t see it clearly, but after Xia ruofei said that, she immediately thought of what Xia ruofei was hiding. It was probably something close – fitting, and her face couldn’t help but heat up. She quickly looked away and didn’t dare to look in the direction of the bedroom.

Xia ruofei was a little anxious.”Madam, you gave me a bag and I’ve accepted it. If there’s nothing else, you can go back and rest!” Or go deal with the mail! Aren’t you that dedicated to your work? What are you doing in my room?

Seeing Feng Jing looking around the suite, Xia ruofei’s heart started to race. Especially when Feng Jing’s gaze swept past the room where Monica was hiding, his heart almost jumped out of his throat.

However, what he was afraid of came.

Perhaps it was because the auction had ended and it was a huge success, Feng Jing was very relaxed and had no intention of going back immediately.

She laughed as she read,””I used to live in this Presidential Suite too! I think I’m staying in this room ...”

Feng Rao said as she walked towards a room.

Xia ruofei was so shocked that he almost screamed. The room that Yingying was in was the room that Monica was hiding in.

In such an emergency, Xia ruofei casually pointed at the room. Unexpectedly, it was the room that Feng Rao had stayed in the last time.

Monica did not have the time to think so much. She must have subconsciously followed Xia ruofei’s directions and hid in the room.

As Feng Rao walked towards the door, Xia ruofei quickly called out,””President Feng!”

Xia ruofei’s voice was trembling. Feng Rao stopped and turned around.”Chairman, what’s wrong?”

Xia ruofei forced himself to remain calm and laughed dryly.”Oh, it’s nothing ... You ... Didn’t you say you had a few emails to deal with during dinner?”

“Yup!” Feng Jing smiled and said,”I’m just here to give you my bag. I’ll be back soon ...”

Feng Rao took a few more steps forward and said,””By the way, I’ll take a look at the room I stayed in last time and relive the feeling of being in a Presidential Suite ...”

Feng Jing had already reached the door and was stretching out her hand.

“President Feng!” Xia ruofei was so shocked that he called out again.

Feng Rao was also shocked by Xia ruofei. She retracted her hand and asked,””What’s wrong?”

“Uh ...” Xia ruofei racked his brain and said,”what ... What kind of bag did you buy?” Open it and give me an introduction ...”

Feng Jing couldn’t help but laugh,”Chairman, why are you so jumpy today?” It’s just a small LV handbag, a woman’s handbag. You won’t understand even if I tell you!”

Tonight, Feng Rao seemed to feel uncomfortable if she did not go back to her room. After being interrupted by Xia ruofei twice, she still reached for the door handle.

Xia ruofei was so nervous that his heart was about to jump out of his throat. The scene of Monica wrapped in a bath towel being seen by Feng Rao appeared in his mind.

Feng Rao’s hand was already on the doorknob.

Kada, kada ...

She wrung her hands twice and frowned.””Eh? Why is the door locked from the inside?”

Xia ruofei’s soul, which was about to leave her body, seemed to have returned to its original position. He secretly heaved a sigh of relief. Thank God Monica remembered to lock the door from the inside.

“I’m not too sure!”He quickly replied. When I first checked in, I walked around the apartment. Did I accidentally press the lock button and close the door?”

“I see ...”

“It’s fine, it’s fine. If you want to go in and take a look, I’ll call the waiter to open the door. ” Xia ruofei said immediately.

The room card of the Presidential Suite could be used to open the door of the entire suite, but the doors of the rooms in the suite were not opened by card.

Most people who lived here wouldn’t lock an empty room from the inside. If they made a mistake, they could make a phone call and the waiter would come to open the door.

Although Xia ruofei was straightforward, he had no intention of taking action.

He was also praying that Feng Jing wouldn’t insist on entering the house to take a look.

Unless Feng Jing realized that something was wrong, she would definitely give up on that idea.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel nervous.”He wondered if Feng Jing had discovered something. For example, the pink lace bra, the smell of Monica’s perfume in the room, or something else that he hadn’t noticed ...

Fortunately, none of his worries turned into reality.

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Feng Jing laughed and said,””No need, no need! So what if it’s locked! Why did they bother the waiter so late at night? There are so many rooms here, you won’t be able to stay in all of them, right?”

Xia ruofei felt a weight lifted off his chest and quickly said,””That’s true, that’s true! Then, let’s not open it ...”

In fact, Xia ruofei was acting like a snake. Feng Jing did not notice anything wrong. She had only wanted to enter the room on a whim. After all, she had stayed here before.

The bag had been delivered, and the door couldn’t be opened. Feng Jing’s strong woman nature quickly returned as she started thinking about the few emails that she had yet to deal with.

Hence, she quickly bade Xia ruofei farewell and left. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei personally sent Feng Jing to the door as if he had been pardoned and thanked her for the gift.

After Feng Jing left and Xia ruofei closed the door, he heaved a long sigh of relief and leaned against the door as if he had collapsed.

Xia ruofei realized that his back was drenched in sweat.

It had only been a few minutes since Feng Jing had entered and left, but Xia ruofei felt like a long time had passed.

After leaning against the door for a while, Xia ruofei looked around guiltily. After confirming that there was no one outside the door, he walked to the door of the room where Monica was hiding.

Xia ruofei gently knocked on the door and said,””Monica, come out! They’ve already left ...”

The door opened with a click, and Monica, who was still wrapped in a bath towel, walked out of the room.

The two of them stood at the door, looking at each other. A few seconds later, the smiles on their faces slowly bloomed, and then they laughed.

Those few minutes were too exciting, especially when Feng Jing’s hand went to turn the doorknob. Xia ruofei almost thought that the whole thing had been exposed.

Fortunately, in the end, he was not in danger.

It had to be said that this feeling of being a thief could actually bring an inexplicable excitement.

The two of them laughed for a while before slowly stopping. Then, they looked into each other’s eyes in unison.

Both of them could see a small flame in each other’s eyes.

Without any words, Xia ruofei and Monica hugged and kissed each other tightly. Soon, the cumbersome bath towel and bathrobe were thrown far away, and a charming and charming battle began again.

The flames of war burned from the living room to the study, and then from the study to the bedroom. Finally, the final battle was carried out in the bathroom with an extra – large Jacuzzi.

Unknowingly, more than an hour had passed.

When the two of them slowly recovered from their crazed state, they remembered that they had not seen the White truffle.

Xia ruofei looked at Monica, who was drenched in sweat. The two of them took a couple’s bath, changed into a clean bathrobe, and walked out of the bathroom.

“Xia, it was crazy tonight ...” Monica said as she held Xia ruofei’s arm.”If you don’t show me the White truffle, I’m afraid I can’t help but ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”baby!” Let’s look at the truffles first! The night is long, we have a lot of time! I promise I’ll make sure you’re full tonight ...”
