Chapter 419: Chapter 370 – directly cripple_3

One, two ...

Fang Luo’s other hand was smashed by Xia ruofei as he screamed in pain.

Xia ruofei threw the bottle away and picked up the military dagger that had accompanied him for many years. He wiped the blood on Fang Luo’s clothes slowly and then smiled innocently. He asked,””Now, do you still want to be my friend?”

“Demon ... You ... You demon ...” Fang Luo said weakly,”if you have the guts ... Kill me ...”

Xia ruofei whispered into Fang Luo’s ear,””I think it’s more interesting to make you suffer a fate worse than death ... Don’t you like to play with women? I think it’s an illness, so I’ll cure it for free today ...”

Fang Luo’s expression changed drastically, and he cried out in a trembling voice,””You ... What do you want to do?”

Xia ruofei’s lips curled into a cruel smile. Then, the military dagger in his hand slowly slid down Fang Luo’s chest, past his lower abdomen, and finally stopped between his legs.

Xia ruofei used a little force and the military dagger easily cut Fang Luo’s pants.

Fang Luo could feel the cold blade on his skin, and he could not help but shiver. He shrieked,””No... No... I beg you ...” She begged.

He had already guessed what Xia ruofei was going to do. He was scared out of his wits and this was the first time he had begged for help today. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”I’m sure you’ve defiled quite a number of girls over the years.” Today, I’ll seek justice for them ...”

“No... Don’t ...” Fang Luo shouted crazily.

Xia ruofei’s eyes did not even waver. With a twist of his wrist, he cut down ruthlessly.

“Ah ... Ah ...” Fang Luo screamed hysterically. In the end, his head tilted to the side, and he fainted as he had wished.

Xia ruofei carefully wiped the blood off the dagger on Fang Luo’s clothes. After putting the dagger away, he stood up and walked to the bed to carry Lu You. Then, he walked out of the room that reeked of blood.

A few Men in Black were still unconscious at the door. Xia ruofei walked down the stairs step by step.

The burly men who had been beaten by Xia ruofei also heard Fang Luo’s screams from the second floor. They were so scared that they kept quiet out of fear. When Xia ruofei came down, they all avoided him like the plague.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and went to grab a big man. He asked him to bring him to the surveillance room in the corner of the first floor.

The screen in the control room showed the images from all the cameras in the bar, including the one at the door. These images were recorded repeatedly, and could be kept for at least a few days.

Xia ruofei carried Lu You on his shoulder and gave her a hard kick. The metal case exploded from Xia ruofei’s kick, and sparks flew everywhere. The server that stored the video recording could not be more useless.

Xia ruofei easily found the hard drives in the wreckage of the case. The burly man had been chased away by Xia ruofei. He immediately put the hard drives into the spirit map space with a thought. Then, he carried Lu You out of the monitoring room and left the bar.

As he walked out, in addition to the few burly men he had injured, there were more than a dozen burly men who were not injured. However, no one dared to stop him, who was full of killing intent. Wherever he went, those people hurriedly made way for him, each and every one of them silent like cicadas in winter.

Xia ruofei walked to the door, turned around, and said,””If you don’t want your boss to bleed to death, you’d better call 120 now.”

With that, Xia ruofei put Lu You down from his shoulder and carried her in a Princess carry. Then, he walked out of the bar.
