Even though Luo Qingfeng was a shrewd person and had been pretending to be calm, he could not help but raise his eyebrows after hearing Zheng Yongshou’s words. His eyes flashed and he said in a deep voice,””Tell me the details!”

“Yes! Master!” Zheng Yongshou said respectfully,”this disciple came out of the mountain to supervise this matter. I originally wanted to order junior nephew Wang Boshan to give up the secular means and directly seize the island by force. After all, this matter has been dragged on for so long ... However, just as we began to plan, things suddenly took a turn for the better.”

“Oh? What do you mean?” “What is it?” Luo Qingfeng asked indifferently.

“I’ll report to you about the possession of peach source Island ... Oh, I mean the blue cloud Island. ” Zheng Yongshou said calmly,”the secular family that originally owned this Island suddenly transferred the ownership of the island to a young man. It was also him who changed the name of the island to Paradise Island.”

“Continue.” Luo Qingfeng said.

“This young man’s attitude is different from the Liu family ‘S. He’s not that insistent on the ownership of the Peach Blossom Island.” Zheng Yongshou said,”martial nephew Boshan has made some small achievements in the secular world over the years, so I made the decision to buy the island from this young man with money that exceeded the value of the Paradise Island. When we increased the price to 4.5 billion US dollars, he finally couldn’t resist the temptation and agreed to sell the island!”

“That’s great!” Luo Qingfeng’s eyes revealed a hint of excitement.

As for Zheng Yongshou’s 4.5 billion US dollars, he didn’t take it to heart at all. Some worldly wealth was no different from floating clouds to him. Let alone 4.5 billion, even if it was 45 billion, if it couldn’t be exchanged for cultivation resources, it was no different from waste paper in his eyes.

However, the peach source Island was a top – notch cultivation resource that could directly enhance the overall strength of the entire sect. How could it be exchanged for money?

Zheng Yongshou continued respectfully,”honored master, before I returned to the sect, I had already completed the transfer of ownership of the island with junior nephew Boshan. Now, the Peach Blossom Island belongs to the stars Corporation of the secular world. In other words, the island with the natural formation is already our star Seizer sect ‘s!”

“Very good!” Qingfeng Luo said happily,”Yongshou, you’ve done a great job! Speak! Whatever reward you want, I will definitely satisfy you!”

“Master, it’s disciple’s honor to be able to share master’s burden. It’s just a small contribution, how would I dare to ask for any reward?” Zheng Yongshou quickly said.

“It’s not my style to not reward someone for their contributions!” Luo Qingfeng waved his hand and said,”just say it. As long as the sect can provide you with resources, I can make the decision to reward you!”

“Thank you, master!” Zheng Yongshou said respectfully. However, it is already a great blessing for me to be able to cultivate in the sect these years. I really don’t dare to ask for any reward. If master agrees, this disciple wants ... To follow master and learn the array Dao. Master’s array Dao level is something that this disciple can only look up to. ”

Qingfeng Luo could not help but laugh. He knew that his disciple was very obsessed with arrays, which was also one of the things that he was proud of. Zheng Yongshou’s words had just scratched his itch, making him feel very happy.

“What’s so difficult about that?” Luo Qingfeng said,”in the future, I will teach you everything I know about array formations. Our sect also needs a capable array formation expert, so that I don’t have to take action personally when it comes to array formations!”

“Thank you, master!” Zheng Yongshou revealed an overjoyed expression as he said. Then, he hesitated for a moment and said,”master, this disciple still has a presumptuous request!”

“Speak!” Qingfeng Luo was in a good mood at this time, so he raised his hand and said indifferently.

“Yes!” Zheng Yongshou first bowed slightly, then said,”the success of this matter is inseparable from the efforts of martial nephew Boshan. This disciple implores master to reward him with some cultivation resources. After all, it wasn’t easy for him to make a living in the secular world, and the cultivation environment in the secular world is harsh. With some cultivation resources, he can improve his cultivation and self – Protection ability, and serve the sect better. ”

“No problem!” Luo Qingfeng said,”although this Wang Boshan is a little lazy, he is really a talent in the secular world!” With such a great contribution, it wouldn’t have been a problem for him to request to return to the sect. Since he’s willing to stay in the secular world, I’ll reward him with some cultivation resources and ... Personally guide him so that his cultivation can improve a little!”

“Disciple Thanks teacher on behalf of martial nephew Bo Shan!” Zheng Yongshou said hurriedly. Then, his eyes widened as he asked,”master, you mean ... You want to make a trip personally?”

“Haha!” Luo Qingfeng laughed and said,”if I don’t go over ... Can you activate that natural array?”

Zheng Yongshou revealed a trace of confusion, lowered his head and said,””Disciple’s array skills are inferior. I’m still not strong enough to deal with a natural array of that level ...”

“That’s why! I’m the only one who can handle this matter personally!” Luo Qingfeng said,”it just so happens that I’ve been staying in the sect for the past few years. It’s time to go out and take a breather!” Yongshou, you’ll come with me this time. First, you’ll lead the way, and second, you can learn more about arrays from me. Activating such a natural array is a great opportunity to learn!”L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎
