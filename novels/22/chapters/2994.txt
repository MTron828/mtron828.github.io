2995 The five Holy badges (1)

Luo Qingfeng’s body trembled when he heard this. He muttered,””It’s really the five Holy badges? Why would someone take out the five Saints token to auction?”

Xia ruofei turned to look at Luo Qingfeng and asked,””Qingfeng, do you recognize this token?”

Luo Qingfeng quickly replied respectfully,”master, most people in the cultivation world know about the five – Saint token. In fact, there are five pieces of the five – Saint token. It is said that when the five tokens are combined into one, a big secret can be unlocked. It is even related to the reason behind the worsening environment of the cultivation world. Some say that the five – Saint token can open a complete ancient cultivation cave abode, and some say that the secret of a huge treasure is contained in the five – Saint token. In short, there are many different opinions ...”

Xia ruofei asked with interest,”so exciting?” It doesn’t sound like it’s true. ”

“The Legend of the Five Holy badges has been around for more than three hundred years. This old servant also learned about it from the sect’s ancient records. I reckon that the major sects in the cultivation world are also the same.” Luo Qingfeng said,”as for whether it’s true or not, I really don’t know. This kind of news gets more and more bizarre the more it spreads. Anyway, we still can’t prove it.”

“That’s reasonable, three people make a Tiger!” Xia ruofei touched his chin and nodded.”But ... Since we have to gather all five tokens, this one won’t be of much use?”

“Master,” Luo Qingfeng said,”in fact, the cultivation world has already confirmed that there are three tokens, and they are all in the hands of the major sects. One is in the first heaven sect, which is the sect that auctioned the ore. The other one is in the hands of the soaring Flower Valley. As you know, the owner of the third token is sect leader Mu Sheng of the surging waves sect ... If this token is not put up for auction by these three sects ...”

“That’s not very likely. I’ve observed that the three sects you mentioned today were more restrained in the first part of the auction. They basically didn’t make any moves, so why would they keep spirit stones? They’re probably here for this token!” Xia ruofei analyzed.

“Yes!” Qingfeng Luo said. Master’s words make sense. In that case, this token might be the fourth five sages token!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s possible.” Qingfeng, do you think ... We should try to bid for this token?”

Luo Qingfeng also fell into deep thought.

All these years, the Legend of the Five sages medallion had been circulating in the cultivation world. Although it was not the most bizarre and exciting one, the five sages medallion was right in front of them now. It might be related to a huge secret. If they could get a piece of the cake ... This kind of temptation was very difficult to resist.

“Master, this old servant is Luo Qingfeng said cautiously,”currently, the three sects that have the five – Saint token are all very powerful. They have the ability to keep the five – Saint token in their hands. However, if we also get a piece, I don’t know if it will be a blessing or a curse!”

Xia ruofei said,”we can’t avoid it. Since we’ve encountered it, we might as well fight for it!” In any case, the star Seizer sect has already become the center of attention, right?”

“This old servant will listen to master’s orders!” Luo Qingfeng said with a slight bow.

Since Xia ruofei had made his decision, Luo Qingfeng would not object to it. Even if this would bring disaster to the star Seizer sect or even cause the sect to be destroyed, he would not hesitate.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”don’t be nervous. We don’t have many spiritual stones. It’s hard to say whether it’s enough to compete for this five – Saint token.” Moreover, even if we managed to buy the five sages token, we are not pushovers. Even if we are temporarily weak, we can still use some connections to balance things out! For example, now that everyone knows that we are likely to refine Qi gathering pills and fire cloud pills, then the forces that need these pills may become our help, right? I heard you say that Medicine King’s Valley was in such a situation. Their strength was not outstanding before, but no one had ever dared to find trouble with them. ”

“Yes! Master is right!” Luo Qingfeng said excitedly,”nowadays, supplementary drugs such as the Qi gathering pill are a scarce resource. If we can make them in batches, they will definitely be very popular in the cultivation world! Even if the superpowers attack the star Seizer sect, as long as we don’t reveal the formula, they won’t be able to take it. Therefore, those superpowers who want the medicine will most likely cooperate with us ...”

“Mm! Let’s just wait and see!” Xia ruofei said.

On the main auction stage, Hao Qingsong had already begun to introduce the five sacred badges.

However, his words were very short, as most people knew about the Famous Five sacred badges and did not need him to introduce them.

The only thing Hao Qingsong had emphasized was that this token was not put up for auction by those three sects. In other words, it was confirmed that this was the fourth five sages token to appear in the world of cultivation.

He was getting closer and closer to collecting all five tags. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

In fact, there was a number on the back of each token. This five Saints token had the word “si” engraved on it, which was obviously the number 4 token.

Everyone knew that the heavenly sect’s five Holy badges were number two, the soaring Flower Valley’s number three, and the surging waves sect’s number five.

It was indeed the first time this token number four had appeared in the world of cultivation.

Those cultivators who were familiar with the Legend of the Five sacred badges couldn’t help but feel excited after confirming that it was a brand new badge.

The major powers who had received the news in advance and had prepared sufficient spirit stones also rubbed their fists and wiped their palms, preparing to fight for it.
