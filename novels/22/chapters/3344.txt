3345 Harvest (1)

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but let out a long sigh of relief when he saw the message. He then realized that his back was drenched in sweat.

He had been on high alert for the entire hour, and he had not relaxed for a moment.

In the beginning, he only dealt with one Mirage beast, which was the 25th intermediate level Mirage beast he had killed since he entered the third floor of the Tower of Trials. It was not a big deal to him, as he was already familiar with it.

However, after killing this intermediate – Level Shen beast, Xia ruofei had not even had the time to put away the trap and kill array. Fortunately, he had not put away the trap and kill array before he had already met Shen tianfang.

What happened next was Xia ruofei’s most nervous moment. From the start, he had to run with all his might, then he used the trap and kill array to turn the situation around, and finally, he killed Shen tianfang. Then, he immediately entered the spirit map space to avoid the five – colored light. The entire process could be said to be extremely tense.

Especially when he was waiting for the five – colored light to dissipate in the spirit map space, Xia ruofei could only watch helplessly as there was only one Shen beast left in the task that he had not killed. The time to break the record was getting shorter and shorter while he could only hide in the space and do nothing. That feeling was really tormenting.

When the five – colored light finally dissipated, he only had less than nine minutes left to break the record.

Xia ruofei had almost given up on trying to break the record, but in the end, there was a glimmer of hope and a middle – Level Shen beast jumped into the trap and kill array.

In the end, Xia ruofei used the trap and kill array and successfully killed the Shen beast when there was not much time left to break the record. In the end, he achieved his established goal without any danger.

Xia ruofei, who had relaxed all of a sudden, felt as if he had lost all his strength.

He took out a chair from the spirit map space, sat down on it, and slowly closed his eyes.

In fact, Xia ruofei did not use up much of his energy during the whole process. However, he had been very tense. Now that he was completely relaxed, he felt weak all over.

After a long while, Xia ruofei let out a long breath and stood up. He kept the chair into the spirit map space.

He didn’t hurry to put away the trap and kill array. What happened to Jian Jia just now had left a shadow in his heart. Only by leaving the trap and kill array here would he feel a little safer.

Xia ruofei shuttled through the array skillfully. The trap and kill array did not affect him at all. He soon arrived beside Shen tianfang’s body.

Shen tianfang’s entire body was dark, and his face still maintained the look of unwillingness and ferocity from before his death. His eyes were wide open, staring at the sky angrily, but they had long lost their light. Part of his body had been carbonized by the flames. He had been tall when he was alive, and his body was twisted in an irregular way.

Xia ruofei looked at Shen tianfang’s dead body and sighed.

He did not want to kill Shen tianfang, but Shen tianfang had the intention to kill him. There was no way to turn things around.

It was either Shen Tian or him who died.

The cruelty of the world of cultivation was once again displayed in front of Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei’s feelings were very complicated. At least, he was not happy at all. Looking at Shen tianfang’s body, he felt a faint sorrow in his heart.

However, Xia ruofei was not a pedantic person. It was not the first time he had killed someone. He was moved but he did not feel any fear or discomfort.

After a moment of silence, Xia ruofei walked to Shen tianfang’s body and started searching.

Shen tianfang’s face was ferocious, and his body was as black as charcoal. His eyes were also distorted. An ordinary person would feel fear at the sight of such a corpse, but Xia ruofei did not feel any fear.

He had seen more than one corpse that was much more terrifying than this.

In order to not miss any details, Xia ruofei bent down completely, his face almost touching Shen tianfang’s ferocious face. His heart was not moved at all.

Soon, Xia ruofei found a belt on Shen tianfang’s body.

In fact, most of Shen tianfang’s clothes and personal belongings had been burned. The only things that were intact were his close – fitting clothes and belt. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Xia ruofei knew that the undergarments must be a treasure.

However, he had no interest in Shen tianfang’s clothes. Besides, the grade of this magic treasure must not be high. Although the burning flames did not hurt it much, the black light could easily penetrate it. This magic treasure was already badly damaged and had no value at all.

As for the belt, Xia ruofei was sure that it was Shen tianfang’s storage treasure.

He held the belt in his hand and used his mental energy to scan it.

As expected, he immediately sensed that there was a rather large space inside.

Since Shen tianfang was dead, the storage belt had no owner.

Xia ruofei easily recognized the belt as his owner.

Then, he used his mind power to check the storage space and the situation inside was presented to Xia ruofei.

The storage belt had quite a lot of space. It was almost as big as the storage rings that Xia ruofei had given to Ling Qingxue and Song Wei.

Shen tianfang was the number two master of the first heaven society, a cultivator who could break through to the late – Stage of the Golden core realm at any time. Such a storage belt suited his status.
