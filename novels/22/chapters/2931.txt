2932 Retreat after success (1)

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.”There’s no rush. We’ll deal with it slowly later.” Brother Zhang, I called you here to tell you that you don’t need to arrange an evacuation. I’ve already dealt with the Bay group for you. ”

Zhang Chao was stunned. He didn’t know what Xia ruofei meant.

In fact, he couldn’t believe his ears. After a moment of shock, he quickly asked,””Mr. Xia, why...Don’t we need to evacuate?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Bay group won’t dare to cause trouble for you in the future, so of course, there’s no need to evacuate!” Are you willing to run to an unfamiliar place and start over?”

“This ... How is this possible?” Zhang Chao was dumbfounded.”The Bay group has always been very domineering. We have offended them this time. How can they not pursue the matter?”

“It’s not that I won’t pursue the matter, but I don’t dare to cause you any more trouble. ” Xia ruofei smiled.

Luo Qingfeng, who was watching from the side, saw that Zhang Chao actually doubted Xia ruofei’s words and could not help but feel a little displeased. He could not help but interrupt,””Mr. Zhang, Mr. Xia has done a lot of work to help you solve this problem. How can you still doubt his words?”

Zhang Chao came to his senses and quickly said,””You’re mistaken! How would I dare to doubt Mr. Xia! It’s just that this matter is really too unexpected, I’m a little confused for a moment ...”

Xia ruofei used his eyes to stop Luo Qingfeng, then smiled and said,””It doesn’t matter! Brother Zhang, you can rest assured. Even if you bring your brothers back to work at Huafeng shipping now, it’s absolutely no problem! This is what Goodman promised himself, and he’ll never go back on his word, or someone’ll teach him a lesson!”

Zhang Chao was dumbfounded. After a long while, he stammered,””Gu...Goodman? The boss ... Of the Bay group? Personally ... Personally promise?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”come, come, come!” I’ll show you something!”

The Bay group was too notorious. Even if Xia ruofei tried to convince him, Zhang Chao would still have all kinds of doubts. He would not be completely at ease, so it was better to see for himself.

Zhang Chao followed Xia ruofei to the desk, confused.

Xia ruofei opened his laptop and opened the most direct photos.

When Zhang Chao saw this, he couldn’t help but exclaim,””Isn’t this that ERAD? He ... He’s dead?”

Zhang Chao’s impression of ERAD was too deep. In the morning in the big courtyard of Huafeng shipping in kuachakuarkos, he had really felt boundless despair when he faced ERAD. The feeling of heavy pressure was engraved in his heart. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Xia ruofei played the video of Manino executing ERAD and said with a smile,””This video is a little gory. If you don’t feel comfortable, don’t watch it.”

“Mr. Xia, you’re joking,” Zhang Chao said awkwardly. Even if I’m not strong enough, I’m still a disciple of the Hong sect. I’ve fought on the streets before, so how can I be afraid of blood?”

In Mexico, gangs were rampant. All kinds of bloody fights and killings happened every day. Zhang Chao had been working hard in Mexico for many years, but he didn’t get to where he was today overnight. In his early years, he was only a disciple of the Hong sect at the bottom level. In order to fight for territory and interests, he had experienced all kinds of fights.

The video had already started playing. The video had been edited, and only the part where Manino conveyed Goodman’s words to ERAD and then shot ERAD to death was retained. It was only about a minute.

Zhang Chao had been in Mexico for many years, so he had no problem listening to Spanish. Naturally, he could understand the conversation between Manino and irade in the video.

He said in shock,”Mr. Xia, it’s actually ... Goodman who personally ordered the execution of ERAD?” Just because he ... Offended someone he shouldn’t have offended?”

At this point, Zhang Chao looked at Xia ruofei in a different light.

Obviously, the “person you can’t afford to offend” in Goodman’s words was Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei had just said that he was the one who helped to coordinate and solve the problem with the Bay group. The video and photos were sent to Xia ruofei immediately. It was obvious.

Xia ruofei smiled and did not say anything. Instead, he played the last video, which was the one that Goodman had recorded.

While watching the video, Zhang Chao’s mind was in a daze. He didn’t realize that his mouth was wide open. He even felt like he was dreaming, or that the Goodman in the video was someone else.

This notorious drug lord in Mexico actually apologized to Huafeng shipping so sincerely, and even to all the Chinese! In addition to expressing his apology, he also promised to severely punish the parties involved and promised that all Chinese people in Mexico would receive preferential treatment and protection from the Gulf Group.

This was simply too outrageous!

It was like an ordinary person beating up the “small target” ‘s “nation’s husband”, the son of the richest man. The “small target” not only did not get angry or retaliate, but also sincerely apologized to the ordinary person and said that in the future, if the ordinary person’s townsman bought a house at their company, they would give him a 50% discount ...
