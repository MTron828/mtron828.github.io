2899 The eastern immortal (2)

Hence, when he saw Xia ruofei’s dazzling appearance, Charlie recovered from his shock and his first thought was that he had really met an Eastern deity!

That was the only explanation!

Not to mention, riding the clouds and flying in the sky were the “standard” of Chinese immortals!

Xia ruofei glanced at Charlie with great interest and asked in Chinese,””You know about the eastern deity?”

Xia ruofei’s voice carried a trace of spiritual power. Even though his tone was calm and his voice was not loud, it was deafening in the ears of Charlie, Davis, and the others. Everyone felt that Xia ruofei’s voice was directly ringing in their ears with a special rhythm and was filled with magical power.

Charlie had studied Chinese culture before and naturally had some knowledge of Chinese. He stuttered,”I ... I ... Have read the” Classic of Mountains and Seas ...”And the” God – searching record ...”May I ask ... Are ... Are you ... An Eastern immortal?”

Xia ruofei had a mysterious smile on his face. He didn’t answer Charlie’s question directly, but looked at Davis and the others.

When Xia ruofei appeared, Davis and the others wanted to run away instinctively because everything seemed to be out of their control.

Even though the yacht was in the middle of the vast ocean and they had nowhere to run to, they still subconsciously wanted to stay as far away from Xia ruofei as possible.

However, Davis and the others sadly discovered that not only were they unable to pull the trigger or shake off their guns, their legs seemed to be nailed to the deck, unable to move an inch.

Xia ruofei’s gaze was very calm, but when Dai Weisi and the others were swept by his gaze, they felt as if there was a dagger on their backs and goosebumps all over their bodies.

Xia ruofei looked at Davis and said in Chinese,””For your own benefit, you even wanted to kill your own blood brother. This is a crime that can not be punished!”

Davis could not understand Chinese but he was afraid of Xia ruofei. He asked in English,”Excuse me...What can I do for you, Sir?”

Charlie’s face was full of hatred, and he took the initiative to translate for Davis.”Davis, this Eastern deity said that you tried to kill your own brother for your own benefit, and he sentenced you to death!”

Xia ruofei could not help but smile. Charlie’s translation was correct. Although “unforgivable” did not mean the death penalty, from Charlie’s point of view, since the eastern deity had said that Davis “unforgivable”, then Davis was dead for sure. The deities in Chinese legends all had absolute power!

Davis’s expression changed and he cried out in horror,””No! He’s not a judge. Even if I’ve committed 100 first – degree murder cases, I’ll still be sentenced to death by the federal judge!”

Xia ruofei could understand English, but he did not say anything. He only looked at Davis with interest.

Charlie sneered,”Davis, have you forgotten what you just said?” This was international waters, and it was a competition of whose fist was tougher! The Federation’s laws can’t control this! Since the eastern deity has sentenced you to death, you’re dead!”

Just now, Charlie really had no response at all! He didn’t expect that karma would be so bad. Just when he was about to lose his life in the sea, an Eastern immortal suddenly appeared from the sky, and it seemed that the immortal was on his side. It was simply a ray of light at the end of the tunnel! 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Eastern deity!” Davis said hurriedly,”please don’t kill me! I ... I have a lot of money ... My net worth is more than 100 billion US dollars. I can contribute all of it to you. You ... If you kill Charlie, the entire wealth of the cohe family will be yours ...”

Charlie’s face changed slightly, but he thought about it and realized that the eastern deity probably wouldn’t understand Davis’s words, so he felt a little more at ease.

“Davis, stop struggling!” Charlie said. The hundreds of billions of dollars you said is mine! That will was illegal! Besides, I’m not dead yet! The eastern deity saved me, so my life is his, not to mention my property! If anyone wants to contribute their assets, I should be the one contributing. What does it have to do with you?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile. He had thought that Charlie would think that he didn’t understand English and deliberately hide Davis’s words. After all, some people were willing to sell their lives for tens of thousands of Yuan, let alone hundreds of billions of dollars. There were many people who wanted money more than their lives.

Xia ruofei was satisfied with Charlie’s performance. Although he would not covet the Koch family’s wealth, at least it seemed that this guy knew how to repay kindness.

Charlie immediately said to Xia ruofei in Chinese,””Great Eastern deity! Davis had just said that he was willing to use 100 billion dollars to buy his life! But I told him that the hundred billion US dollars of assets were all mine. In order to thank you for saving my life, I’m willing to give all my assets to you, master immortal! And not in his name!”

Xia ruofei replied in fluent English,””I can understand what you’re saying ...”

Davis and Charlie were both stunned. Charlie thought about it, that’s right! The moment this Eastern deity appeared, he didn’t even ask any questions and immediately knew that Davis had murdered his brother. He must have heard their conversation! How could the eastern deity not understand English?

Charlie was also secretly feeling a lingering fear. If he had been feeling lucky just now, thinking that this Eastern deity didn’t understand Davis’s words and was hiding something, then everything would be over.

Fortunately, Charlie was full of respect for Xia ruofei from the bottom of his heart. After tonight’s incident, the ecstasy of finding a way out of a desperate situation made him look down on money. When he said that he would offer up all his assets, he was not faking it. It came from the bottom of his heart.

Davis didn’t think so much. He saw that the other person could understand English and hurriedly said,””Sir, I have no enmity with you, so why must you kill me? As long as you can let me live, I’m willing to turn over a new leaf and never have any other thoughts. As long as my brother gives me a little money to live, I’m willing to leave the United States and never appear in front of him again!”

Following that, Davis anxiously said to Charlie,”Big brother! We’re Blood Brothers! I know I was wrong. Please help me beg this gentleman to spare my life for the sake of my parents! Charlie ... Have you forgotten that when I got into trouble when I was young, you would always plead for me in front of my father ... I still remember that time when I scratched my father’s favorite sports car. At that time, my father was furious, and it was you who spoke up for me, so I didn’t get beaten up ...”

Davis was very smart and knew that he had to use his emotions to win.

He saw the situation very clearly and understood that the key to this matter was actually Charlie. As long as Charlie was willing to let it go, this so – called Eastern deity who was passing by would not care so much, although he still could not understand how this person could fly out of thin air and appear in such a remote Sea area.

Hearing this, Charlie hesitated. Davis had indeed brought back his childhood memories.

When they were both children, they were still very harmonious. As an older brother, he was also very protective of his only younger brother, Davis, and their brotherly relationship had always been very good.

Xia ruofei looked on coldly and revealed a playful smile.

Although this Davis had hidden it well, he could not hide it from Xia ruofei’s eyes. When Davis had said those words, his eyes had flashed with hatred, which Xia ruofei had already noticed.

He was certain that if Davis had escaped this time, he would have done everything he could to get rid of Charlie. He would have even used money to open a path, trying to find him and kill him at all costs.

Even though Xia ruofei was a cultivator and was not afraid of Davis’s revenge, he was not used to letting a venomous snake Escape.

Since he could solve the problem once and for all, why would he waste so much time?

Of course, Xia ruofei did not use a simple and brutal method to kill Davis. He had an idea in his mind.

Xia ruofei looked at Charlie and asked with a faint smile,””Charlie, I’ve decided to give you the right to choose. In other words, the lives of Davis and the others are in your hands ...”

Before Charlie could come back to his senses, Xia ruofei jumped onto the deck lightly after finishing his sentence. Then, the blue immortal sword let out a long cry and flew out like a dragon ...
