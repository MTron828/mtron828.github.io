Chapter 1137: MA Xiong’s trip to the capital (2)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei drove to the family housing area. Lu You stuck her head out and greeted the security guard. The security guard immediately let Wanwan through. Although Lu You rarely came to the capital, her mother was the managing Deputy Director. Hence, the security guard had already remembered this beautiful director’s daughter from the first day she came.

Under Lu You’s guidance, Xia ruofei drove song Rui’s Phaeton to a ten – story apartment building.

“I’m here. ” Lu You looked at Xia ruofei and asked,”do you want to go up and sit?”

“No, I won ‘t.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Auntie Tian is so busy. It’s not good to disturb her.”

“There’s no one at my house,” Lu You blurted out.”My mother must be at the office at this time!”

After saying this, Lu You’s face heated up. She realized that this sentence was a little too ambiguous and hurriedly said,””I ... I’ll go up first ...”

Xia ruofei was also a little embarrassed and quickly said,””Okay, I’ll contact you in advance if I return to Sanshan. Oh, right, send me your ID number later. I’ll take care of the plane tickets. You don’t have to worry about it!”

“En!” Lu You nodded quickly. Then, she pushed open the car door and got out of the car with the paper bag full of jaded skin ointment. She ran into the apartment building as if she was escaping.

Xia ruofei looked at Lu You’s graceful back and felt a little confused. After a long silence, he sighed, started the car, and left the National Development and Reform Commission’s family residence.

......

It was already FiveO’ clock in the afternoon when they returned to the hotel. Xia ruofei was not in a hurry to return the car to song Rui. Instead, he went straight to his room.

He took out his phone and pondered for a moment. At first, he was going to call Ma Zhiming, but after thinking about it, he decided to call MA Xiong directly.

The phone rang twice before it was picked up. MA Xiong’s hearty laughter came from the other end,””Hello, Xia Sheng!”

“Good day, old Mr. MA!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I hope I’m not disturbing your work.”

“Hahaha! I’m in a semi – Retired state now, so I’ve handed most of the company’s matters to Zhiming to handle!” MA Xiong smiled.”Is there anything I can help you with, Xia Sheng?” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Mr. MA, I recently got a pretty good jade square plate.” Xia ruofei said,”I don’t have a hobby of collecting Jade. I want to sell it.” Originally, my friend suggested that I go through the auction channel, but I thought that your company has been in the jewelry and Jade business for a long time, so I wanted to ask if you are interested in taking over. ”

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, MA Xiong replied without hesitation,””Of course I’m interested. Anything that Xia Sheng sells must be of the highest quality!”

Xia ruofei didn’t even tell him about the Jade square plate, but MA Xiong had expressed his desire to buy it. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel touched by his unconditional and blind trust.

“Mr. MA, how about this ... I’ll take a few pictures of the Jade cards and send them to you. You can decide after you’ve seen them!”

“There’s no need to look, I trust you, Xia Sheng!” MA xiongkai laughed and said,”just name a price. I won’t haggle!”

“Let’s take a look at the item first!” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”You can decide for yourself how much it’s worth.”

“Alright then!” MA Xiong said,”Xia Sheng knows my email address. I’m in the study now. Just send me the photos after you’re done.”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said happily.

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei took out his laptop, SLR camera, and the king’s Green jade square plate from the medium.

He first pressed the power button of the laptop, then took the Jade square card to the balcony with better light.

There was a bouquet of flowers on the coffee table on the balcony. Xia ruofei placed the Jade square on the coffee table, pointed the DSLR at it, and took a few photos from different angles.

Then, he held the Jade square plate in one hand and pointed it at the sunset in the distance, while he took a few photos with a single – lens reflex camera in the other hand to show the transparency of the Jade.

This action was a little awkward, but Xia ruofei still completed the shoot easily.

If Zhao Yongjun saw Xia ruofei doing such a dangerous move, his heart would beat wildly. There was no carpet on the balcony. If his hand slipped, the king’s Green square card worth more than 100 million would definitely break.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power cultivation was extremely high. It would not be a problem for him to make the Jade square card float in front of him. Naturally, he would not slip and fall.

Soon, he had taken the photos and put the king’s Green square card into his storage space. Then, he took out the SD card of the DSLR camera and went back to his room to insert the card into the computer.

Xia ruofei exported the photos and sent them to MA Xiong by email without editing.

After sending the email, Xia ruofei packed up his camera and computer and put them back into the space. Then, he walked to the balcony, lit a cigarette, and blew smoke into the bustling capital.

Before he could finish his cigarette, MA Xiong called.

Xia ruofei had expected this to happen. No one in the entire city could resist the mesmerizing beauty of the king’s Green. Furthermore, MA Xiong had been in the jewelry industry for most of his life.

“Old Mr. MA.” Xia ruofei answered the call.

MA Xiong’s voice was excited.”Xia Sheng, I’ve seen the photo. This ... This is a high – Quality glass King’s Green square plate?”
