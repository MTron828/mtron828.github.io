She looked at Xia ruofei with a bitter smile and said,””Ruofe...You’re too impulsive. It’s not worth it ...”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Sister – in – Law, squad leader Luo is the God of War in our hearts. This grandson dared to slander him like this. Even if the wolf King was here today, the result would be the same!”

Lin Yue ‘e heaved a long sigh when she heard this.

She naturally knew the position of squad leader Luo Zhicheng in the hearts of her comrades. To be honest, she was very pleased with Xia ruofei’s performance today, but at the same time, she couldn’t help but feel deeply worried for him.

Xia ruofei laughed nonchalantly.”Sister – in – Law, I’ll take care of things here. You don’t have to worry about it, just go and settle aunt Luo’s funeral! Don’t miss the time ...”

“But ...” Lin Yue ‘e asked worriedly,”how are you going to resolve this?”

“You don’t need to worry about that!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”in any case, nothing will happen! Everyone’s waiting, you can go back first! I won’t be going up the mountain after aunt’s funeral. ”

Seeing that Lin Yue ‘e was still worried, Xia ruofei smiled and said in a relaxed tone,””Sister – in – Law, don’t worry! By the time you come down from the mountain, the matter here will have been resolved ...”

Squad leader Luo’s older sister also tried to persuade her. Lin Yue ‘e also knew that the matter of her mother-in-law’s funeral couldn’t be delayed, so she could only follow her relatives back to the courtyard with deep worry.

Soon, the sound of blowing could be heard from inside again. There were still some rituals to be done before the funeral. Soon, aunt Luo’s coffin would be carried up the mountain. The tomb had been dug and was just waiting for the right time to be buried.

In the open space at the entrance, Huang Zhenyu and the two cameramen were surrounded by the villagers.

The two cameramen had never seen such a scene before. They were so frightened that their faces turned pale. Huang Zhenyu was sitting on the ground in a sorry state, gritting his teeth in pain. His legs were swollen, and the bones of his calves were twisted in a strange way. It was a shocking sight.

After Xia ruofei finished talking to Lin Yue ‘e, he walked towards Huang Zhenyu and the other two.

When the villagers saw Xia ruofei walking over, they immediately parted to make way for him. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

When Huang Zhenyu saw Xia ruofei, he immediately glared at Xia ruofei and said in a hoarse voice,””If you have the ability, then kill the three of us! Or lock us up for life! Otherwise, we’ll definitely call the police! You will soon pay a painful price for your atrocities!”

“Don’t try to provoke me. I’ve killed many people ...”Xia ruofei sneered.

The two cameramen were already scared to death. Just now, when Huang Zhenyu said those harsh words, they couldn’t help but shrink their necks back. In their hearts, they were cursing Huang Zhenyu like a fountain. In such a situation, it was fine to just stay put. Wasn’t it courting death to provoke the god of death?

When Xia ruofei said that, the two cameramen couldn’t help but shiver and their faces turned pale.

“Who doesn’t know how to brag?” Huang Zhenyu sneered.

Naturally, Xia ruofei would not explain so much to such an unscrupulous person. He said indifferently,””Don’t think that I don’t dare to kill you. The reason you’re still alive is because I don’t want to dirty my hands!”

“And ...” Xia ruofei squatted down and stared into Huang Zhenyu’s eyes. He said word by word,”do you think I’ll let you go after I beat you up?”

“You ... What else do you want?” Huang Zhenyu’s heart trembled, and he asked sternly.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Don’t be impatient. You’ll find out soon.”

Xia ruofei stood up and took out his phone. He found song Rui’s number and dialed it.

The phone rang for more than ten times. Just as Xia ruofei was about to hang up, the call finally connected.

Song Rui’s sleepy voice came from Xia ruofei’s phone.””Xia ruofei, you bastard! Do you even have a little bit of public morality? What’s going on, you’re disturbing my sleep so early in the morning!”

Xia ruofei raised his hand and looked at his watch. It was just past Seveno’ clock, which was indeed too early for song Rui.

Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”you must have overworked yourself last night.” Why do you sound so weak?”

Xia ruofei was just teasing her, but he really heard a sweet voice from the other end of the phone.””Young master Song, who’s this annoying person?”

Then, the voice on the phone became muffled. It was obvious that song Rui had covered the phone. However, Xia ruofei’s hearing was better than ordinary people ‘s. He could still hear song Rui say,””It’s none of your business, go to sleep!”

Then, song Rui chuckled awkwardly and said,””I’m just putting on an act! All men understand ... What are you looking for me for?”

“There’s something urgent. Find a more convenient place to talk!”Xia ruofei said seriously.

“Give me two minutes!” Song Rui said immediately and then hung up.

Xia ruofei shook his head helplessly and kept his phone.

After about a minute, Xia ruofei’s phone rang. It was song Rui who called back. He must have sent the woman away.

However, he only gave her a minute to get dressed and leave. Young master Song was really something.

“Can you say what you want to say now?” Song Rui said,”because of you, I did one less ‘morning exercise’. You have to compensate me!”

“No problem. We’ll talk about it when I return to the three mountains.” Xia ruofei said. He did not beat around the bush and went straight to the point.”Does your family have any reliable people in Ganjiang province? it would be best if they were leaders of a certain level.”
