Chapter 146: Deputy County Head Wu’s decision (1)

The phone rang a few times before Wu Liqian picked it up. “Happy New Year, Xiao Xia!” Wu Liqian said. Xia ruofei heard some noise on the other end of the phone and asked,””Sis Wu, did I disturb you from work?” “It’s nothing, I’m just visiting some units in the county!”Wu Liqian smiled lightly. We were in the meeting room just now, but we’re out now. If you have anything to say, just say it. It’s more convenient to talk now. ” During the new year, the leaders of several groups in the county would go to various units to visit and express their condolences. They would pay their New Year’s greetings to the cadres and people who still insisted on their posts during the new year. This was already a tradition in China. Party parties and governments at all levels had this tradition. As the fourth – in – command in the leadership team, Wu Liqian was definitely very busy today. She had to go to all the units and work the whole day. Hence, Xia ruofei didn’t stand on ceremony and said directly,””Sis Wu, there’s something I need your help with.” Then, Xia ruofei told Wu Liqian everything that had happened that day, including how he had beaten up a few police officers after he had arrived at the hospital. In fact, Xia ruofei had even beaten up the Deputy Director of the county Public Security Bureau in front of Tian Huilan at the Changping County’s Linhai town police station. Wu Liqian had been there as well, and she had been Tian Huilan’s Secretary at the time. After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Wu Liqian said angrily,””There’s such a thing? This was simply lawless! Xiao Xia, are you still in the hospital?” “Yes, I’m worried that after I leave, Chen Gang will do something bad to the CAO couple!” Xia ruofei said,”they are all honest farmers. They are already out of their minds after such a thing happened on the first day of the new year.” “Don’t worry, just wait for a while in the hospital. I’ll definitely give you a satisfactory explanation!” Wu Liqian said without hesitation. “Okay, thank you, sis Wu ...” Xia ruofei said,”I’m sorry!” It’s the new year and I’m giving you trouble ...” “You even have to do this with sis Wu?” Wu Liqian said with a smile,”develop your business well, and create more taxes and jobs for our County. That’s the best way to thank me!” “Definitely, definitely!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Since Wu Liqian still had to deal with this matter, the two didn’t talk much and hung up the phone quickly. The county Water resources Bureau. Wu Liqian put her phone away, a thoughtful look on her face. She glanced at Xu Jianbo, the director of the county Public Security Bureau, who was sitting on the side. During the spring Festival visit, several groups in the county were divided into several groups and acted separately. Xu Jianbo happened to be in the group led by Wu Liqian. Basically, the leader would walk around and thank the staff on duty for their hard work. He would then give them some gifts and the leader would say a few words to them. The greetings at the water conservancy Bureau had basically ended. However, Wu Liqian had just gone out to take a call, so everyone was still waiting here. Wu Liqian nodded to everyone, then said to the Deputy Director of the government office,””Our next stop is kuake City Hospital.” In fact, health, water conservancy, and public security were all under Wu Liqian’s jurisdiction, so she had to visit these places during the spring Festival this year. The county government office’s Deputy Director was stunned for a moment before he reminded her in a low voice,””Mayor Wu, according to our plan, our next stop is the Public Security Bureau. The county hospital is arranged to be in the afternoon ... The notice has already been sent out. If we go now, I’m afraid the hospital won’t be prepared ...” Wu Liqian frowned and said,”what do we need to prepare?” It’s new Year ‘s, so we’ll go and visit the front – line medical workers. It’s fine as long as they work normally. It’s not like we’re going to inspect them!” “Alright, I’ll inform them immediately!” The Deputy Director of the government office saw that Wu Liqian was a little unhappy and quickly agreed. The director of the Public Security Bureau, Xu Jianbo, asked in a half – joking, half – serious manner,””Mayor Wu, why did you suddenly change to the county hospital? Is the tea in our Public Security Bureau not good?” Xu Jianbo was a member of the visit and comfort Group, but if they were to go to the Public Security Bureau, he was also the host, so what he said was not considered out of line. “Director Xu,” Wu Liqian said with a smile,”our colleagues in the Public Security Bureau are all working very hard. We have more time in the afternoon. We can talk more with everyone!” “Haha!” Xu Jianbo laughed and said,”I feel much better now that you’ve said that, Mayor Wu!” Wu Liqian’s eyes were clouded. Xu Jianbo had indeed been showing signs of a bad trend recently, and this was also directly reflected in his words and actions. His words just now seemed casual, but in reality, there was a faint sense of challenge. However, Wu Liqian had already cultivated to the point where she could not show her emotions. She just said indifferently,””Let’s go!” The group of people left the water conservancy Bureau and got into their own cars. The motorcade then headed in the direction of the county hospital. At the county hospital, before Wu Liqian arrived, a group of menacing people came ... [PS] the monthly votes list has been hit in the ass again.
