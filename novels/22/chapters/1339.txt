Chapter 1340: The arrival of the luxury tour group (2)

Translator: 549690339

The main reason was that these two companies combined monopolized at least 80% of the country’s e – commerce market. They were the two most powerful channels, and the production of pomfrets was not high to begin with, so there was no need to distribute the goods all over the internet.

When the two e-commerce’s seafood managers heard that paradise Corporation was about to launch the almost extinct Yangtze River pomfrets, their interest was also very strong. They happily accepted the inspection invitation sent by paradise Corporation and would fly to San Shan in the next few days to personally inspect this project.

Of course, Xiao Qiang would be the one to receive them. At most, Feng Jing would show her face at an appropriate time. Xia ruofei did not need to show up in person.

After all, although the size of the other company far exceeded that of paradise Corporation, they were only the category Manager of the level 2 business department. Xiao Qiang’s appearance was absolutely in line with the principle of reciprocity.

Hence, Xia ruofei’s main focus was on receiving Zhao Yongjun and the others.

In the blink of an eye, it was the day that Zhao Yongjun and his group came to the three mountains.

Other than Zhao Yongjun, song Rui had also returned to the three mountains. However, what made him regret was that even though his progress with Zhuo Yiyi had gone quite smoothly, it wasn’t enough to trick her into coming to the three mountains to play. Therefore, his wish to take the opportunity of traveling to improve himself and even go straight to third base had come to nothing.

The rest were Liu Jian, Hou Liang, and a group of people. Xia ruofei had drunk with them before, so they were familiar with each other.

Before boarding, Zhao Yongjun gave Xia ruofei a call.

Xia ruofei stood on the balcony of the small villa and laughed.”Brother Zhao, I’ve already prepared everything. When everyone arrives, we’ll go straight to the city for dinner and stay at my farm for the night! I’m telling you, we’ve cleaned the reception room several times ...”

Zhao Yongjun snorted and said,”you really welcome me with open arms!” Isn’t this a little too Grand?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s rare for you guys to come here. It’s necessary to be fully prepared!” I must make you feel at home!”

“Hehe, then I’ll have to trouble you!” Zhao Yongjun said,”will it affect your work?”

“My most important task now is to welcome the arrival of our brothers!” Xia ruofei joked.

“I really don’t deserve that!” Zhao Yongjun said,”ruofei, we’re just wandering around the world when we have nothing to do. If you have time, you can accompany us. If you don’t have time, you don’t have to care about us. You know that no matter where we go, we’ll always have someone to welcome us.”

“I know what I’m doing, don’t worry! It won’t affect my money making. ” Xia ruofei laughed and asked,”your flight will land at 4:30 pm, right? I’ll go to the airport in advance to wait. ”

“There’s no need to pick us up,” Zhao Yongjun said immediately.”Song Rui has already arranged a car for us.”

“How can I do that? No matter what, this is your first time coming to the three mountains! As the host, I have to show some enthusiasm!” Xia ruofei said.

Zhao Yongjun laughed and said,”ruofei, we’re brothers. Why do we care about these red tape?” Just do whatever is convenient! Why did he have to go to the airport on such a cold day? Besides, didn’t you say that we would have dinner together? You can just wait at the dining area!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while. It was good that he went to Ling Ji private kitchen in advance. He could meet up with Ling Qingxue there and check out the situation in the private room. He had also ordered a few dishes in advance, including the secret Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup, steamed kun fish, and so on. He would only be at ease after seeing them for himself.

Moreover, he had to personally deliver the pomfrets to the lingji private kitchen. He had specially invited Su Yu to cook just to make this pomfrets.

If he went to pick them up, he would not be able to make it.

Besides, the song family’s power was deeply rooted in the southeast province. Song Rui had personally arranged for the pick – up, so there was nothing to worry about. In fact, any ‘tour group’ brought by Zhao Yongjun would be welcomed by a large group of people when they arrived in the southeast province. He didn’t have to worry so much.

At the thought of this, Xia ruofei said,”alright, I’ll go and prepare for dinner. I’ll treat you to two dishes. I guarantee that you won’t be able to eat anything in the capital!”

“Hahaha! Then I’ll be looking forward to the surprise you’ll give us!” Zhao Yongjun said.

“Alright! I’ll send you the location in a bit. ” Xia ruofei said,”come here immediately after you get off the plane!”

“Alright! See you tonight!”

“See you tonight!”

After Xia ruofei hung up the phone, he called Jiang Hua and asked him to prepare three Chinese perch. With Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue, there would be more than ten people eating tonight. Two catties of Chinese perch might not be enough, so Xia ruofei decided to prepare three at once.

At around 3:30 am, Xia ruofei drove the Knight XV to the beluga breeding workshop to get the beluga that Jiang Hua had prepared. Then, he drove straight to the lingji private restaurant.

At around fouro’ clock, before Zhao Yongjun’s plane reached the three mountains, Xia ruofei had already arrived at the Ling Ji private kitchen.

After he met up with Ling Qingxue, he first brought the Chinese perch to the kitchen and handed it to Su Yu. He also expressed his gratitude to Su Yu for being the Executive Head Chef of the Ling Ji food and beverage group. If it were not for Xia ruofei’s relationship with the Ling family, it would be impossible to get him to cook personally no matter how much money he offered.

Then, he asked the head chef of Ling Ji’s private kitchen about the preparation of the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall.

The head chef was Ling Xiaotian’s first disciple. He knew that this was his Junior sister’s future husband. He also knew that the secret recipe of ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ was actually provided by Xia ruofei. Hence, he was very enthusiastic towards Xia ruofei.

The preparatory work for the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup was very cumbersome. Many ingredients had to be processed a few days in advance. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The Ling’s private kitchen ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ was the best – selling dish, and the reservation number was a month away. Only someone like Xia ruofei, who had an internal relationship, could have it whenever he wanted.

After walking around the kitchen, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue went to the private room to make tea and wait.

Although it was called a private room, it was actually a small courtyard reserved for the Ling Ji private kitchen. It was basically not open to the public. Last time, Xia ruofei had used this private room to receive song Qiming and his family.

Xia Qing’s space red robe. After the tea was brewed, the fragrance of the tea spread. Behind the screen, there was a woman in a cheongsam playing the guzheng. Beautiful music, a quiet courtyard, the alluring fragrance of tea, and a beautiful girlfriend ... Xia ruofei felt that this was simply the ideal life.

He even had the urge to bring Ling Qingxue to a place with a beautiful environment, build a small courtyard, and live a carefree life, no matter what kind of business or career he had.

Of course, this kind of wish was not too realistic at the moment. Ling Qingxue still had Ling Xiaotian’s career to rely on, and Xia ruofei’s paradise Corporation was not just his own paradise Corporation. With an ever – expanding employee team, it was not easy to just abandon them.

Ling Qingxue stood behind Xia ruofei and gently massaged his shoulders. Xia ruofei was so comfortable that his eyes were half – closed, enjoying his girlfriend’s gentle service.

The two of them chatted casually, and the atmosphere was very warm and pleasant.

Xia ruofei felt that it was about time, so he opened his eyes and opened the Feichang quasi – APP to check on Zhao Yongjun and the others ‘flight status. After confirming that the plane had just landed, he sent the location of Ling Ji’s private kitchen to Zhao Yongjun.

Xia ruofei guessed that they were getting ready to get off the plane and would have to take their luggage later. It would take more than ten minutes for them to come out, and Zhao Yongjun might not even have turned on his phone! So he didn’t rush to call Zhao Yongjun. After sending the location, he put his phone aside.

After a few minutes, Xia ruofei’s phone vibrated.

As he picked up his phone, he turned around and smiled at Ling Qingxue.””They should be on their way here. Tell the kitchen to prepare the free – range chickens and ducks in advance. It’ll take a lot of time.”

Ling Qingxue responded and was about to go to the kitchen when she heard Xia ruofei’s “huh?”. She turned around and saw that Xia ruofei was slightly surprised.

However, Xia ruofei quickly picked up the phone and said with a smile,””Liu Zhe, why are you suddenly looking for me today?”
