Chapter 1805: A coincidental encounter at the restaurant (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei first visited Feng Jing’s CEO office. It was already an eye – opener for him. His first impression was that it was quite spacious. Compared to the office on the farm, the conditions were simply too good.

However, when Xia ruofei saw his own office, he finally understood what luxury was.

He pushed open a pair of dark red double doors. The first thing he saw was a corridor and a Chairman’s secretary’s office. Just this office alone was much bigger than Xia ruofei’s office at Paradise Farm.

Next to the secretary’s office, there was a door that led to Xia ruofei’s office. In the secretary’s office, there was another door that led directly to Xia ruofei’s large office.

Xia ruofei walked into his office and an idiom appeared in his mind.

In reality, it wasn’t that exaggerated. It was just an illusion that appeared in his mind when he suddenly entered a very empty space.

What did it feel like to have a big office of 300 square meters?

The decoration didn’t look particularly resplendent, but it had a low – Key luxury. This could be seen from the details of the decoration materials, which were very exquisite.

Standing in this empty office, even his words would echo.

On the side near the glass wall, there was a huge office desk. All the office supplies were already in place. Xia ruofei sat on the leather chair and felt it. It really felt different from the big office on the farm.

Turning the chair around, one could look down at the three mountain City through the glass wall. Although the 15 – story building was not considered high, it was considered a high point in the Main City where old buildings were piled up. The view was quite good.

However, this large office was only one part of the chairman’s office.

In reality, Feng Jing’s office only took up less than one – third of the floor. The rest of the space was occupied by Xia ruofei’s office.

In addition to this large office of more than 300 square meters, there was also a special lounge, which was more spacious than the luxury suites in the hotel.

In addition, it was also equipped with a meeting room, a reception room, a gym, a tea room ...

It could be said that if Xia ruofei wanted to, he could even live in this big office for the rest of his life. It had all the functions that he needed. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Moreover, for the sake of aesthetics and overall planning, many passages and doors had been designed to be hidden. The walls looked regular, but one of them was a hidden door. When it was pushed open, it was a different world.

After looking around, Xia ruofei felt that the design of the huge office was complicated.

“Boss Feng, I think I’ll get lost in my own office in the future ... This is too big!” He said with a bitter smile.

“You’re exaggerating,” Feng Rao grinned.”You’re just not familiar with the environment. You won’t be able to use it after a few days ...”

“Didn’t I tell you not to be so dramatic?” Xia ruofei said helplessly,”you’re ... A little too wasteful ...”

“I’m just following your orders!”Feng Rao replied innocently. My original intention was to use the entire floor as your office! That’s the only way to show the strength of our company!”

Xia ruofei glanced at Feng Rao and said,””What’s the difference between this and the entire floor? How much space does your office take up?”

“Chairman, I actually agree with CEO Feng’s opinion. As the company’s leader, your office represents the face of the company. You can even say that it’s a window to the outside world ... In the future, when you’re receiving friends and doing interviews, your office really can’t be too shabby ...”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly,” Anyway, I’ve already put it in place. I just think it’s a waste ...”

“You’re the one who said you’d spend a few million just to get a car for the higher – ups!” Feng Rao chuckled.”Why are you so frugal now?”

“Are they the same thing?” Xia ruofei said,”Alright, alright. That’s it!”

Feng Jing chuckled.”Chairman, I’ve already looked around. The headquarters now meets the company’s requirements for moving in. Do you think ... We should pick a date to move in?”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and asked,””Moving is not a small matter. It involves so many people and resources. We have to plan it in advance! The company’s operations can’t be messed up!”

“Don’t worry!”Feng Rao laughed. President Dong has already prepared a complete relocation plan and he’s taking full responsibility for it. When the time comes, we’ll definitely be busy but not in a mess. The company’s operations will also be on the right track very soon!”

It was obvious that Feng Jing was quite satisfied with Dong Yun’s position as the Executive Director. In fact, Feng Jing had high hopes for Dong Yun back then and thought that she was the best candidate for the company’s vice president.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”sure!” Then prepare to move! As for the date ... Give me some time to think about it. I’ll let you know as soon as I’ve decided. ”

“It’s already lunch time. We won’t have anything to eat even if we go back to the farm. Let me treat you guys to a meal!” Xia ruofei said.

“Sure!” Feng Rao laughed. Since the chairman is treating us, we won’t stand on ceremony with you!”

After all, Dong Yun was not very familiar with Xia ruofei, so she expressed her gratitude to Xia ruofei very seriously.

So the three of them took the elevator to the parking lot, then got into Xie Bing’s Mercedes – Benz and left the Tao Yuan building.
