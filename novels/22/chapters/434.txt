Chapter 435: Grasshoppers on a rope (2)

Lu You had also thought it through. She smiled and said,””Let’s not talk about this. Xia ruofei, I don’t have a car, right? I’ll give you a ride!”

“There’s no need to go through so much trouble, right?” Xia ruofei said,”it’s tens of kilometers to and from here! I’ll just take a taxi ...”

“No trouble at all! I don’t have class today anyway!” Lu You said.

Xia ruofei hesitated and said,””Alright then ...”

“Get in the car!” Lu You immediately said happily.

The two of them got into the car, and Lu You started the BMW MINI and drove in the direction of the city exit.

It was very quiet in the car and the atmosphere was a little awkward. Lu You’s personality was a little cold, especially since she rarely spent time alone with a guy like this. Although she had been wanting to see Xia ruofei for the past few days, when Xia ruofei was really sitting beside her, she could not find anything to talk about.

Moreover, her heart was beating so fast that her driving became a little stiff.

Xia ruofei sitting beside her made her a little nervous. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

It was Xia ruofei who broke the silence and asked,””Lu You, have you been well these two days?”

Lu You’s face turned red for no reason. She said guiltily,””It’s pretty good ...”

“Oh! That’s good!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I was worried that you would have a nightmare after going through that kind of shock!”

Only then did Lu You realize that Xia ruofei was asking about this. She felt a slight warmth in her heart and quickly turned to look at Xia ruofei.””I had a good night’s sleep. I didn’t have any nightmares ...”

She added in her heart,’I dream of you every time ...’

Of course, Lu You did not dare to say this out loud.

At this moment, Lu You’s phone rang. As she slowed down the car, she took out her phone and took a quick look. Her expression changed slightly as she said,””My mom called ...”

Xia ruofei said,”you can take it first ... Since it has happened, there’s no point in running away. At most, you can just apologize to her and promise that you won’t do it again!”

“En!” With Xia ruofei’s encouragement, Lu You seemed to be more confident. She nodded, took out her Bluetooth Earphone, hung it up, and pressed the answer button.

“Mom!” Lu You called out guiltily.

“Lu You, where are you?” Tian Huilan asked.

Although her tone was very calm, Lu You knew her mother quite well. Every time Tian Huilan spoke in such a seemingly calm tone, a storm was brewing. Only when Tian Huilan was truly angry to a certain extent would she speak in such a tone.

Lu You looked at Xia ruofei nervously and then said,””I ... I’m driving! Xia ruofei is going back to the farm, I ... I’ll send him there. ”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but widen his eyes and smile bitterly.

He thought to himself, this girl is too honest! You sold me out with just two sentences ...

Tian Huilan was also slightly taken aback after hearing this. She said in surprise, “You’re with Xiao Xia?”

Without waiting for Lu You’s reply, Tian Huilan immediately continued,””Then come to my office with Xiao Xia. I have something to talk to you about!”

Lu You was so scared that her face turned pale. She had only been to Tian Huilan’s office a few times in her life. Even if there was something, Tian Huilan would go home and talk to her. This time, she actually asked her to go to the office directly and even brought Xia ruofei along. It was clear that Tian Huilan was really angry.

Lu You stopped the car by the side and covered the microphone with her hand. She whispered to Xia ruofei,””What do we do? My mom wants us to go to her office together ...”

Xia ruofei forced a smile and said,”what else can we do?” Go!”

“I’m sorry ...” Lu You said weakly.

When Tian Huilan had asked her where she was, she didn’t know what was wrong with her, but she had directly said that she was with Xia ruofei. Not only would she be criticized, but Xia ruofei would also be kidnapped. She felt extremely guilty.

On the other end of the phone, Tian Huilan saw that Lu You had not said anything and could not help but ask,””Youyou, did you hear that?”

“Oh! “I got it. I’ll be right there ...” Lu You said quickly.

After hanging up the phone, Lu You looked at Xia ruofei nervously. Seeing that Xia ruofei didn’t seem angry, she started the car again and drove towards the municipal Party Committee compound.

On the way, the two of them were silent for a long time before they said in unison,””In a while ...”

“You go first ...” Lu You said, a little embarrassed.

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”nothing. I just wanted to tell you that no matter what Secretary Tian says later, you must not talk back to her. No matter how angry she is, it’s all because she cares about you.”

“I know ...” Lu You asked timidly,”what about you?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Secretary Tian, you’re only looking for me to verify some things, right?” Perhaps ... You’ll charge me with the crime of not reporting the information? I don’t know if they’ll seal off my Tao Yuan farm ...”

Lu You was shocked.”That won’t happen. If my mother dares to take revenge, I ... I ... I will run away from home!” She said.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”Look at how nervous you are ... I was just joking with you! Your mother is such a big leader, she doesn’t need to go that far! And ... What enmity do I have with her? It’s nothing like using public office to take personal revenge, okay?”

“Why are you so bad!” Lu You couldn’t help but roll her eyes at Xia ruofei.
