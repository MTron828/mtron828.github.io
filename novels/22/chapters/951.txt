When they arrived at the room, Xia ruofei locked the door and windows. Then, he smiled at Tang Haoran.””Haoran, sit down first. Master will help you completely destroy the flaming monster in your body.”

“Yes, master!” Tang Haoran said obediently.

Then, he sat down on the carpet with his legs crossed. He had already received Xia ruofei’s treatment on the plane. He was smart enough to sit properly without Xia ruofei’s teaching.

Xia ruofei went behind Tang Haoran and sat down cross – legged.

Then, she placed her palm on his Xinyu acupoint. Her mental power seeped out of her body and entered his body through the Xinyu acupoint.

There was not much innate pure Yang Qi left in Tang Haoran’s body, so it was easy for Xia ruofei to deal with it.

He wrapped the innate pure Yang Qi with his psyche and brought it to his heart through his meridians. He then absorbed it into his body through his palm.

Xia ruofei was focused on absorbing Tang Haoran’s innate pure Yang Qi, so he did not cultivate it directly. Instead, he used a technique to temporarily suppress the innate pure Yang Qi in his dantian.

The innate pure Yang Qi in Tang Haoran’s body was decreasing bit by bit, and his face gradually revealed a relaxed expression.

Although Tang Haoran was not clear about the situation in his body, he could feel that his body seemed to be getting lighter as the time bomb – like innate pure Yang Qi, which contained a huge amount of energy, continued to decrease.

In the end, Xia ruofei stopped absorbing after leaving behind about one – tenth of the innate pure Yang Qi that Tang Haoran originally had.

Xia ruofei stood up with a smile and said,””Haoran, master has eliminated most of the flaming monsters, but he still left a little bit. Do you know why?”

“Why?” Tang Haoran asked in confusion.

Xia ruofei said seriously,”that’s because a man should rely on his own strength to solve problems. The flaming monster in your body was too strong. You couldn’t defeat it with your own strength. But now, I have left a small point for you. I hope that you can defeat them on your own.”

Xia ruofei paused and continued,””Haoran, you’ve grown up. You have to learn how to solve problems by yourself. I’ll teach you some powerful skills and let you deal with those flaming monsters by yourself. Do you have the confidence to defeat them?”

When Tang Haoran heard Xia ruofei say that there was still a small part of the “flaming monster” in his body, he was in a difficult position and his face was bitter.

However, Xia ruofei’s next words gave him confidence again. He puffed out his chest and said,””I’m confident!”

Xia ruofei patted Tang Haoran’s head approvingly and said,””That’s right, this is how a man should be!”

Xia ruofei did not simply tell Tang Haoran that leaving a little innate pure Yang Qi in his body was for his cultivation. Instead, he used this method of encouragement to achieve a better effect.

After all, Tang Haoran was still young, and he did not have much concept of cultivation. He might not be able to understand the benefits of the innate pure Yang Qi.

“Haoran, look into my eyes!” Xia ruofei said seriously.

Tang Haoran didn’t know what his master’s instructions meant, but he still looked up subconsciously and looked into Xia ruofei’s eyes.

At this moment, Xia ruofei activated his spiritual power skill. Tang Haoran felt that Xia ruofei’s eyes were like two bottomless pools. They became extremely deep. Then, he slowly closed his eyes and tilted his body.

Xia ruofei stepped forward and held Tang Haoran’s body.

This was the first time he had used his spiritual power to hypnotize someone, but his spiritual power had already reached the late stage of spirit palpitations. Such a simple technique was still very powerful. Tang Haoran fell into a deep sleep without any resistance.

At this time, even if someone set off firecrackers next to him, it would be impossible to wake him up.

Xia ruofei summoned the spirit map scroll from his palm. Then, with a thought, he brought Tang Haoran into the spirit map’s space and entered the primal realm.

Xia ruofei felt weird for the first time when he returned to the familiar spiritual Qi – rich space.

This wasn’t the first time he had sent someone into the space.

Last time, Liang Haiming had sent Heibao to kidnap Ling Qingxue. Xia ruofei wanted to kill Heibao and the others, so he had put the unconscious Ling Qingxue and the pickup truck into the medium.

However, this was Xia ruofei’s first time bringing someone into the medium.

Xia Qing wasn’t at the Archean realm. Xia ruofei called out to him with his mind, and he immediately returned to the Archean realm from the mountain sea realm.

Seeing that Xia ruofei was hugging Tang Haoran, who was fast asleep, Xia Qing asked,””Master, is this your new disciple?”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”you should confirm his physique first!”

“Yes, master!”

Xia Qing took Tang Haoran from Xia ruofei’s hands and laid him flat on Xia ruofei’s recliner. Then, she began to examine him.

After a while, Xia Qing revealed a trace of joy. She raised her head and said,””Congratulations master, your disciple does indeed have an innate pure yang body, and his cultivation talent is very good. If he were to cultivate a pure yang attribute cultivation technique, his speed should be very fast!”

Xia ruofei brought Tang Haoran into the medium mainly to confirm that he had a strong Constitution. After all, in terms of cultivation experience, Xia Qing had her own “database” and was much stronger than him.

After hearing Xia Qing’s judgment, Xia ruofei was also very happy.

“Alright,” he said with a smile.”Then I’ll pick a pure yang cultivation method suitable for building a foundation and teach it to Haoran!”

Xia Qing smiled and said,”master, I suggest you choose the <<fierce yang Scripture>>. This cultivation technique is simply tailor – made for people with pure yang attributes. Especially for your disciple who has an innate pure yang body, it is the most suitable for him to cultivate this cultivation technique!”

Xia ruofei naturally trusted Xia Qing’s judgment, so he said without hesitation,””Then let’s go with the” fierce yang Scripture “!”

Xia Qing looked at the sleeping Tang Haoran and said,””This child is really lucky to have a master like master, and a cultivation method like the ‘fierce yang Scripture’ that is extremely compatible with his physique. His achievements in the future will be limitless!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”that depends on whether I’m qualified as your master!” To be honest, I don’t feel confident at all! After all, it’s my first time teaching a disciple, and I’m teaching him how to cultivate. ”

Xia ruofei had been a squad leader for five to six years and had even been an acting platoon leader. He had led at least a hundred soldiers before, but leading soldiers and teaching disciples were two different things. He was not very confident now.

Xia Qing consoled him.”Master, just teach him according to the method I mentioned before. I believe that with this child’s talent, he should be able to master the first level of the” fierce yang Scripture “very soon!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”sure!” You can go back to your work! I need to familiarize myself with the incantation of the “fierce yang Scripture.””

“Alright, master. I won’t disturb you any longer.”

After Xia Qing said that, she quietly left the Archean realm.

Xia ruofei quickly found the mental cultivation method of the blazing sun Sutra in his mind. As the information was not purely written, it also contained the sequence of the meridian circulation, the flow of genuine Qi, and even some cultivation insights. All of this information was completely engraved in his mind, so he quickly understood the blazing sun Sutra.

Of course, it was one thing to learn it. It did not mean that Xia ruofei had to practice this technique. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

However, it was more than enough to teach Tang Haoran.

Xia ruofei carried Tang Haoran and left the spirit map space.

After he returned to his room, he casually put the spirit map scroll into his palm, and then released a stream of mental power to gently stimulate Tang Haoran. Tang Haoran immediately opened his eyes in a daze.

Tang Haoran was a little embarrassed.””Master, I don’t know what happened just now, but I suddenly feel so sleepy ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I was helping you to clear the flaming monster in your body. Your body’s functions have been damaged. That’s why you’re feeling a little tired. Don’t worry. It’s normal.”

“Oh ...” Tang Haoran did not have any doubts.

Xia ruofei asked,”how do you feel now?” If there’s no problem, I’m going to teach you how to cultivate!”

Tang Haoran immediately perked up. He puffed out his chest and said, “I’m feeling great!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”come!” Sit down cross – legged!”

“Yes, master!”

After Tang Haoran sat down, Xia ruofei continued to place his palms on his Xinshu point.

Then, he carefully released a wisp of mental power and guided a wisp of true Qi into Tang Haoran’s dantian.

“Haoran, how do you feel now?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Master, I feel something warm in my stomach. It’s like a wave of heat ...” Tang Haoran said.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”that place is called the dantian. The heat is the genuine Qi. However, I transferred this into your body. Your first task is to cultivate the genuine Qi.” Next, I’ll teach you the true Qi circulation route, you must remember it by heart!”

“Yes, master!” Tang Haoran replied solemnly.

Next, Xia ruofei followed the meridian circulation route of the first level of the “sun Scripture” and used his spiritual power to guide his true Qi to start circulating in Tang Haoran’s meridians.

Tang Haoran was also concentrating on feeling the true Qi flow while memorizing the entire route.

Xia ruofei circulated it more than ten times and asked,””Haoran, do you remember it?”

“Master, it should be fine!” Tang Haoran said without much confidence.

Hence, Xia ruofei retracted his Qi, stood up, and turned on his computer. He downloaded a map of the human meridians and acupuncture points and printed it out.

Then, he took the map and pen and handed them to Tang Haoran.””Try to mark out the route of the circulation of true Qi for me.”

“Yes, master!” After Tang Haoran took the pen, he looked at the meridian and acupuncture point distribution map and thought for a while. He accurately found the position of the dantian and then began to connect the lines.

The first level of the cultivation method would pass through three main meridians in the human body and involve more than forty acupuncture points. Tang Haoran spent more than ten minutes and hesitated a few times during the process before he finally completed it.

He handed the Qi circulation route to Xia ruofei without confidence and said,””Master, I’ve finished.”
