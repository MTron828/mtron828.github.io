Chapter 1763: The groundbreaking ceremony (1)

Liu haofan was caught in a dilemma. His face turned red and then white. He also realized that the old man he had just scolded seemed to have a powerful background.

Speaking of other industries, whether it was the political or business world, even if he really had some background, he would not care if he offended them. With the Liu family’s power, he really had the right to not care about these.

However, Xu lang was a person from the field of metaphysics. The older generation had more respect for these seniors from the field of metaphysics, such as Shen Zhongliang, who he had brought with him today.

Judging from Zhao Yongjun and song Rui’s words, Xu Lang’s status in the field of metaphysics was much higher than Shen Zhongliang ‘s.

This gave Liu haofan a headache.

However, it was impossible for him to admit defeat on the spot. How could a popinjay like him admit defeat in front of his arch – enemy? How could he continue to live in the future if this news spread?

Liu haofan stood there, frozen.

At this moment, Xu lang, who was quite angry, asked,””Master Lu, which family is this young man from?”

Lu Shengsi didn’t dare to hide anything and directly said,””Uncle Xu, Mr. Liu’s grandfather is old master Liu Shanhe. Please don’t take the young man’s unintentional offense to heart. It’s not worth it to get angry and harm your body ...”

Xu Lang’s status in the field of metaphysics was somewhat transcendent. His title of “uncle Xu” did not refer to his seniority, but rather a form of respect. From the richest man in his eighties to the young people in their twenties, everyone called him “uncle Xu”. Lu Shengsi was no exception.

Xu lang said calmly,”Speaking of which, I’ve met master Liu a few times. My impression of him is that he’s a modest gentleman. His demeanor is impressive. By right, he should be brought up in a very strict family ...”

After he finished speaking, Xu lang glanced at Liu haofan. The meaning behind his words was already very obvious.

Liu haofan was filled with regret when he heard that. Xu lang was friends with his grandfather. What was worse was that Xu lang was a Hong Kong citizen. All these made him feel extremely passive.

Xia ruofei saw that the situation was in a deadlock and it was almost time for the groundbreaking ceremony. After thinking for a while, he stood up and said,””Young master Liu, if there’s nothing else, please leave! The auspicious time is about to arrive ...”

Although Xia ruofei was chasing him away, in a sense, he had helped Liu haofan out of his predicament.

Liu haofan opened his mouth. He wanted to admit defeat to Xu lang, but his ridiculous pride prevented him from doing so. In the end, he turned around and walked to his car without saying a word.

He didn’t even say goodbye to Shen Zhongliang and du Qinghong, and just got into his car and left.

To Liu haofan, this was already embarrassing enough. He didn’t even say a single harsh word and could be said to have returned home dejectedly.

Seeing Liu haofan leave so directly, song Rui wanted to mock him a little more but was stopped by Xia ruofei’s eyes.

Liu haofan returned in defeat. Xia ruofei walked to Xu lang and smiled.””Uncle Xu, I’m sorry! You’re a guest we invited, but you were insulted by Liu haofan for no reason. It’s US who didn’t do our job well as the host ...”

“It’s fine,” Xu lang said with a pleasant expression.”The groundbreaking ceremony is more important. It won’t be good if we miss the auspicious time.”

“Don’t worry, we’ll definitely make him give you a satisfactory explanation. ” Xia ruofei said.

Xia ruofei was not boasting. In fact, there were so many people here today. Other than the media reporters and a few seniors from the metaphysics world, most of them were people from the upper class of the capital. The Liu family would soon hear about what happened today.

By then, Xia ruofei and the rest would not even need to exert any pressure. The Liu family would definitely give Xu lang an explanation. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Xu lang laughed.”I’m angry at a junior. I’m not cultured enough. Let’s not talk about this ...”

Then, Xu lang looked at Xia ruofei with bright eyes and asked,””Young man, you must be Xia ruofei, right? As expected, he’s an indescribable noble!”

Xia ruofei was stunned and asked in surprise,””Uncle Xu, do you know me?”

Xu lang laughed.”I’m good friends with Mr. MA from Hengfeng, Mr. Guo from the Hong Kong horse race, and Mr. Yang from the Royal entertainment. When they found out that I was coming to the mainland for an exchange, they even talked to me about you. Mr. MA is even more fond of you!”

Xia ruofei finally realized that MA Xiong and the others had mentioned him to Xu lang.

After the truffle auction, Xia ruofei had built a good relationship with some of the rich people in Hong Kong, especially Guo Hongjiang of the horse race. Xia ruofei had helped him cure the famous horse race “star of Hong Kong” and Guo Hongjiang had even given Xia ruofei a mansion in Repulse Bay.

“I see ...” Xia ruofei said.

Xu lang was obviously very close to Xia ruofei. He laughed and said,””Mr. Xia, next time you auction a one – headed abalone, please leave one or two for me! I don’t have any other hobbies in my life except for good food. I can’t forget the one – headed abalone I tasted at Mr. Ma’s House last time!”

“No problem, I’ll definitely reserve it for you!” Xia ruofei quickly replied.

“Thank you! Thank you!” Xu lang said happily.

Although Xu lang was very famous in the field of metaphysics, he was a very gentle person and did not put on any airs. Liu haofan was indeed a talent to be able to anger him.
