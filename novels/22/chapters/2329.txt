2330 The situation is optimistic (1)

Fang Liyun’s mind was in a mess because of her concern.

In fact, Xia ruofei had already told Song Wei that song Qiming was fine. However, when Fang Liyun came in and saw so many doctors in front of the bed, and all of them were working excitedly, she could not help but feel nervous.

However, Song Wei believed Xia ruofei’s words. If he said that she was fine, she was definitely fine.

Her gaze fell on the bed. Before Xia ruofei could explain, she cried out in surprise,””Eh? The ventilator had been removed? RUO Fei, has my father regained his ability to breathe?” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

For the past few days, song Qiming had been lying in the ICU. As his family, Fang Liyun and Song Wei had been worried sick. They had also done a lot of research on brain trauma and brain death. Although they were not experienced doctors, Song Wei had at least learned some common knowledge.

She immediately saw that song Qiming’s nasal tube had been removed.

“Ah?” Fang Liyun was stunned.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”aunty Fang, Song Wei, I have good news for you. Uncle song’s condition has improved greatly. His spontaneous breathing and heartbeat have recovered. His nerve reflexes have also appeared. From the results of the electroencephalogram, he has returned to normal. I think he should be able to wake up soon if nothing unexpected happens!”

“Really?” Fang Liyun could not believe her ears.

Professor Chen, who was busy in front of the bed, also stood up and said,””Mrs. Song, Mr. Xia is right. Secretary song’s condition has improved a lot. We’re also optimistic about his recovery.”

Professor Chen did not dare to be too sure. After all, song Qiming was in a vegetative state. Although he could breathe on his own and his nerve reflex function was normal, the human brain was too complicated. In this era of medical prosperity, the research on the brain was very limited. According to the usual cases, some might wake up on the same day, while others would lie in bed for more than ten years.

However, even though it was a cautious optimism, it sounded like a heavenly sound to Fang Liyun.

She couldn’t help but cover her mouth, and tears flowed out of her eyes.

Song Wei held her mother’s arm tightly and consoled her,””Mom! It’s a good thing that dad’s health is getting better. He should be happy! Why are you still crying ...”

Fang Liyun wiped away her tears and said in embarrassment,””I’m just excited ...”

Then, she quickly thanked professor Chen.

“Madam song, to be honest, I didn’t do anything about Secretary song’s treatment ...” Professor Chen said with a guilty look.”With our current medical standards, Secretary song’s condition was indeed quite dangerous. We were basically helpless. This is all thanks to Mr. Xia, so ... If you want to thank someone, thank my little martial uncle!”

This was the first time professor Chen had called Xia ruofei “senior uncle”. Although he was half – joking, he was indeed impressed by Xia ruofei’s amazing medical skills.

Fang Liyun looked at Xia ruofei and said emotionally,””Ruofei, any words of thanks are too weak. Our family owes you too much. Last time, it was Weiwei, and this time, it’s Qiming. If it wasn’t for you, our family might have already fallen apart. I ...”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”aunty, you and uncle song are both respectable elders in my eyes. My parents passed away when I was young. I treat you like my own parents. Please don’t treat me as an outsider!”

Xia ruofei’s words made Song Wei’s face heat up, but Fang Liyun did not find anything wrong with it.

Because of their relationship with elder song, song Qiming took great care of Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei had always been close to his family. Besides, Xia ruofei said that his parents had passed away early, which triggered Fang Liyun’s maternal instinct. A child without parents was always particularly lovable. Moreover, Xia ruofei had pulled song Qiming back from the gates of hell by himself, so there was no need to mention the closeness between them.

Therefore, Fang Liyun immediately replied,””Ruofei, Qiming and I have always wanted another son when we were young! It was just that the National policy at that time did not allow it. If you don’t mind us, why don’t we become God – relatives?”

Xia ruofei was dumbfounded. He had wanted to get closer to them, but he had never thought of acknowledging them as godparents! How could he turn his godparents into his in – laws after he acknowledged them as his godparents?

Song Wei, who was standing at the side, was a little shy at first, but she could not help but burst out laughing. She was mainly amused by Xia ruofei’s dumbfounded expression.

Song Wei glanced at Xia ruofei and said to Fang Liyun,”Mom! Who would acknowledge godly relatives in the ICU? We’ll talk about this later! Dad hasn’t woken up yet ... You should at least discuss it with dad, right?”

Fang Liyun smiled in embarrassment and said,””Oh yeah! I’m a little impatient ...”

“Aunty, Song Wei is right. We should focus on uncle song’s matter.” Xia ruofei said as if he had been granted Amnesty.

In order to change the topic, he immediately asked,””Professor Chen, how’s uncle song’s condition?”
