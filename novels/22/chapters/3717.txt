Chapter 3718: Magical pill veins (1)

Translator: 549690339

What made Xia ruofei apprehensive, other than the hunger he felt from the purplish – Gold golden elixir, was that he did not feel like he had been reborn like he had in the past when he had a breakthrough.

Xia ruofei muttered to himself and decided not to think too much. Since the purplish – Gold golden elixir was giving him a vague sense of hunger, he would just continue to absorb spiritual energy and cultivate.

Just like when a person was hungry and wanted to eat, the body would give out a signal.

At Xia ruofei’s level of cultivation, he could also sense it.

He did not lack cultivation resources now. He used purple origin crystals for cultivation, so why would he need this little bit of spiritual Qi?

Furthermore, he needed some time to consolidate his cultivation after his breakthrough. He would just treat this as consolidating his cultivation.

At the thought of this, Xia ruofei took out the purple crystal that he had not finished absorbing and held it in his palm. Then, he took a deep breath, sat cross – legged, and continued to absorb spiritual energy to cultivate.

The rich spiritual Qi in the purple Yuan crystal and the spiritual Qi in the surroundings were immediately transported into Xia ruofei’s body.

Naturally, he circulated his spiritual energy according to the meridian circulation diagram of the later stage of the Golden core stage in the great Dao Arts.

Soon, he completed a large circulation. A wisp of vital Qi was produced in Xia ruofei’s dantian and quickly integrated into his purplish – Gold golden elixir.

Xia ruofei didn’t feel any change in the congealing degree of the purplish – Gold golden elixir. The congealing degree of the Golden elixir had already reached 100%. Naturally, there was no way to increase it further. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Xia ruofei didn’t care so much. He didn’t have any distracting thoughts. He just circulated his Qi one by one and the vital Qi in his dantian increased.

All of this vital Qi was absorbed into the purplish – Gold golden core without a trace.

In fact, the cultivation of a late – Stage golden core cultivator was more like a compression process.

Their golden cores had already completely solidified, and the Golden cores were actually formed from a large amount of Yuan Qi. The cultivation of late – Stage golden core cultivators was in fact constantly compressing this Yuan Qi.

The size of the Golden core itself would not change, but the yuan Qi within it would be continuously compressed.

When this kind of compression was carried out to the extreme, one would obtain the opportunity to break through to the Yuanying stage.

Because of this, the yuan Qi in the body of a cultivator in the early stage of the nascent soul realm had begun to transform into a liquid state. This was the result of continuous compression.

Of course, from Jindan to Yuanying, it was a qualitative leap, not just a change in Yuan Qi.

Xia ruofei was also cultivating non – stop. Even if his guess was wrong and he had completely broken through, it didn’t matter. After all, the cultivation of a late – Stage golden core cultivator was like this. He wouldn’t waste his time and would compress the yuan Qi in his golden core..
