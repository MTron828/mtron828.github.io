“Aunty, I’ll toast you on behalf of class monitor Lin!” Ye Lingyun said,”class monitor Lin is no longer around. Brother Xia and I will take care of you on his behalf!” “Good ... Good child ...” Hu ‘Zi’s mother raised her wine glass with red eyes. “Come, come, come, Qiao’ er, let’s have a drink too!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”from now on, we’re a family!” “En!” Lin Qiao’s eyes were also a little wet. In her memory, she had never had such a warm spring Festival since her brother’s death. Every New Year, it was just her and her mother. When she heard the laughter from other people’s houses and the sound of firecrackers in the distance, her house seemed especially cold and lonely. Therefore, ever since her brother’s death, Lin Qiao was particularly afraid of festivals, especially when the whole country was happy and celebrated like the Spring Festival. This year was different. She felt the warmth of a family and the joy of the new year. After everyone clinked their glasses and drank, they ate and chatted. From time to time, laughter could be heard in the dining room. Even ye Lingyun, who was not good with words, said a lot. After the Chinese New Year’s Eve dinner, Xia ruofei wanted to help Hu Zi’s mother with the dishes but was stopped by Hu Zi’s mother. She said that with her around, Xia ruofei did not need to do anything. Lin Qiao, on the other hand, couldn’t wait to set off some firecrackers. In fact, the sky had just turned dark, but seeing that Lin Qiao was so excited, Xia ruofei didn’t want to dampen her spirits. He laughed and called ye Lingyun along. The three of them carried a large pile of firecrackers to the farm outside. The dazzling fireworks bloomed in the night sky, illuminating the three’s smiling faces and bringing a festive atmosphere to the relatively quiet farm. After a while, more than half of the fireworks were set off. Lin Qiao wanted to continue, but Xia ruofei hurriedly told her to save some for the New Year’s Eve. Only then did she reluctantly stop. The Spring Festival Gala was about to begin, so everyone went to the living room and sat in front of the TV. There were fruits and snacks on the coffee table in the living room. The four of them chatted and watched TV as they ate, and the atmosphere was harmonious. Hu ‘Zi’s mother was also in good spirits. She didn’t go back to her room to rest until the new year Bell rang on TV. In the distance, the sound of firecrackers could be heard. In the direction of San Shan city, the entire night sky was lit up. Xia ruofei, Lin Qiao, and ye Lingyun also took the remaining fireworks and went out to set them off. Half an hour later, Xia ruofei and the rest had finished setting off all the fireworks. From afar, they could still see colorful fireworks blooming in the sky. Xia ruofei, ye Lingyun, and the unsatisfied Lin Qiao returned to the villa. Lin Qiao went back to her room to sleep under Hu Zi’s mother’s urging, while Xia ruofei and ye Lingyun went back to their respective rooms. After Xia ruofei returned to his room, he took out his phone and started to make new Year calls. Of course, he guessed that professor Tian, Tian Huilan, MA Xiong, and the other elders had already gone to rest, so he mainly called the younger ones. Liang Qichao, President Zheng of Xi jiangyue, Guo Zhan of lone wolf Commando, Niu Meng of the provincial Military Region, Wu Liqian, the executive Deputy County Head of Changping County ... Xia ruofei’s social circle was not complicated after he retired, so he didn’t have to make many calls. The leader of the lone wolf assault team, Guo Zhan, was very happy to receive Xia ruofei’s call. He even asked about his condition over the phone. Xia ruofei told him that he had been using Traditional Chinese Medicine therapy after he retired and his condition had been effectively controlled. Guo Zhan was also very happy when he learned about it. Xia ruofei also told him about ye Lingyun. Guo Zhan had an impression of this soldier who had performed outstandingly during the group training. After listening to him, he was deeply moved and expressed his appreciation for Xia ruofei’s help to his comrades. Xia ruofei and Guo Zhan talked about many things in the Army and both of them sighed. As for Liang Qichao and the others, Xia ruofei greeted them out of courtesy. He hung up the phone after a short chat. After making a round of calls, he was ready to call Ling Qingxue. In Xia ruofei’s heart, Ling Qingxue was still different from the others. The two of them had not yet broken through that layer of window paper, but they were far more intimate than ordinary good friends. That was why Xia ruofei had left his call to Ling Qingxue for last. Just as Xia ruofei was about to make the call, his phone rang. He looked at the caller ID and saw that it was an unfamiliar number. “It’s already midnight, who would call?” Xia ruofei muttered to himself. “Hello, who is this?” he answered the call. A shy voice came from the other end of the phone.””Brother Xia?” “I’m Xia ruofei. ” Xia ruofei felt that the voice was familiar, but he couldn’t recall who it was. He asked,”may I know who you are?” “Big brother Xia, I’m Jiang Yue!” The voice on the other end of the phone had a hint of joy.”Youyou’s classmate ... The last time at the pharmacy in front of the school ...” “Oh! So it was you! Hello, hello!” Xia ruofei suddenly remembered that easily embarrassed girl. A few days after he left the military, he had saved her in an alley in the shanty town. “Hello, brother Xia!” Seeing that Xia ruofei had recalled, Jiang Yue was elated.”I ... It’s nothing much. I just called to wish you a Happy New Year and wish you a Happy New Year ...” “Thank you! I wish you a Happy New Year too!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “I heard from Youyou that you have a farm in the suburbs?” Jiang Yue asked,”big brother Xia, can we come and take a look after school reopens?” “No problem!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”but our farm has just been completed. We haven’t planted anything yet! You’ll probably be disappointed if you come ...” “No, no, I just wanted to come and see you ...” “Ha?” “Uh ... Look at your farm ...” Jiang Yue said in a flustered manner. “Alright! Give me a call when you feel like it!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. He thought to himself,”why is this lady panting when she’s talking?” “Mm! Goodbye, big brother Xia!” Jiang Yue quickly replied. “Goodbye!” Xia ruofei ended the call. In a small mountain village in gan Nan Province, a few hundred kilometers away, Jiang Yue’s face was flushed red. She held her phone to her chest with a shy smile on her face and her bright eyes were shining with joy. After Xia ruofei ended the call with Jiang Yue, it was almost oneo’ clock. However, he considered that Ling Qingxue should still be awake on New Year’s Eve, so he gave her a call. The call was picked up after One Ring. Then, Xia ruofei heard Ling Qingxue’s voice. “Why do I always have to call you? Is it because there are too many girls and you’re too busy to call for New Year greetings?” Ling Qingxue asked teasingly. Xia ruofei broke out in a cold sweat. A girl’s sixth sense was really scary. Fortunately, he had a clear conscience! He didn’t call the girl. It was the girl who called ...
