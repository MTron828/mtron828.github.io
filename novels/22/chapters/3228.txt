3229 A dangerous disease (2)

Translator: 5496903Xia ruofei smiled and said,”of course!” When we arrived in the United States, my adopted husband was the host, and we were all rich people! Brother Chen, miss Xin ‘er, go back to your rooms and rest for a while. I’ll call you when it’s time to eat!”

“Then I’ll accept your invitation!” Yu Xin ‘er said with a smile.

Chen Xuan and Yu xiner returned to their respective rooms. Li Yifu also stood up and bade them farewell. He went to make arrangements for his upcoming trip to Los Los Angeles and contact more private detectives to find out more about masker’s family.

In the evening, Li Yifu hosted a banquet for Xia ruofei and his group.

Because the things they had to do in the U.S. Had not been settled yet, everyone naturally did not have the mood to drink. After dinner, they went back to their rooms to rest.

The next morning, Li Yifu took everyone to the hotel’s buffet restaurant for breakfast, and then everyone was ready to go directly to Los Angeles.

Naturally, Li Yifu did not have to personally check out. After breakfast, they went straight to a relatively quiet place. After Xia ruofei released the black Phoenix flying boat, everyone quickly jumped onto the flying boat.

Xia ruofei asked as he controlled the flying boat to increase its altitude,””Foster husband, did you manage to find out any concrete information?”

“No one has replied to me yet,” Li Yifu said with a guilty expression.

Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s okay. We don’t have much time. Let’s go to Los Angeles first!”

From San Francisco to Los Angeles, an ordinary civil aircraft would take about an hour and a half, but the black Phoenix flying boat was even faster. It only took them about twenty minutes to arrive in Los Angeles.

Xia ruofei followed Li Yifu’s instructions and found a relatively secluded place near the famous Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles to land the airboat slowly.

Xia ruofei quickly kept the black Phoenix flying ship after everyone had jumped off.

The Beverly Hills Hotel was not far ahead, and Li Yifu had already booked a room there in advance.

Li Yifu’s people had already made arrangements in advance, and the rooms were also booked under other people’s names, so they didn’t need to check in at all when they arrived at the hotel. They directly got the room card from Li Yifu’s company staff and went straight to the room.

This was the most famous Five – Star hotel in Los Angeles and had a long history.

Although the hotel was old, the facilities were still very advanced. In recent years, it had been upgraded many times and maintained a rather high standard.

Xia ruofei and the rest first went to one of the luxury suites. Then, Li Yifu started to make phone calls to understand the situation.

Xia ruofei took out a tea set and the Taoyuan Da Hong Pao from the spirit map space. He sat around with everyone, making tea and chatting. It was impossible to find good tea leaves in the hotels in America. There would not be any kungfu tea sets either unless he specifically asked the hotel for it.

Even the tea was made with the spirit pool water that Xia ruofei had taken out from the spirit map space.

The spirit pond water was stored in a five – liter water bottle.

Many people paid particular attention to the quality of the tea they made. Hence, it was not strange for Xia ruofei to store some tea – making water in his storage artifact. No one paid much attention to it, but they were full of praise for the taste of the peach blossom Da Hong Pao.

After a while, Li Yifu walked over and said,””Master granduncle, we’ve basically done a thorough check. Masker’s child was diagnosed with Strigoi yesterday. This type of tumor has a higher degree of malignant, and the prognosis is not very ideal.”

“Strigoi Carnivus?” Xia ruofei said as he took out his phone to search for information.”Is this illness very troublesome? Even someone as rich as masker can’t cure it?”

Chen Xuan and Yu xiner couldn’t help but exchange a look. Yesterday, Xia ruofei had confidently said that there was no problem with his medical skills. Why did it seem like he had never heard of this illness before? why did he have to look it up on the spot? Did he really use Baidu to see patients? Was this guy reliable or not?

Xia ruofei raised his head and saw Chen Xuan and Yu Xin ‘er’s strange looks.

He immediately guessed what the two were thinking and couldn’t help but smile.””Brother Chen, miss Xin ‘er, my medical skills are mainly in the field of Chinese medicine. This thing called’ sarcoma ‘is what Western medicine calls it. I have to check what’s going on first ...”

In fact, although Xia ruofei’s medical skills had reached a very high level, he still used a simple and brutal method to treat some malignant or difficult diseases. He directly applied the petals of the spirit Heart Flower and it was a tried and tested method.

However, this was not something that outsiders could know.

Chen Xuan and Yu Xin ‘er nodded their heads doubtfully.

No matter how good Xia ruofei’s medical skills were, there was no harm in trying. If this method did not work, they had other means to force masker to give in.

Xia ruofei quickly checked on the condition of the sarcoma and found out that it was a malignant tumor that appeared mainly in childhood. According to Western treatment methods, it was usually removed by surgery, combined with radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

Xia ruofei quickly browsed through the relevant information and said,””This disease is quite serious, but it seems that the recovery rate is not bad! Masker is so rich, the child shouldn’t lose his life, but he will definitely suffer a lot. ”

Li Yifu said,”martial granduncle, according to the situation we’ve grasped, this child’s Strigoi is one of the more malignant types. It grows on his arm. When he was just born, he thought it was a red birthmark. I didn’t expect it to be such a serious illness.” It was said that the disease had affected the kidney and some other important organs. Also, under normal circumstances, his survival rate for this type of Strigoi is less than one – third, so it’s still quite dangerous for him. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”understood!” In other words, he should be able to keep his life for the time being, but the probability of a relapse is very high. ”

“Yes, I am!” Li Yifu nodded and said.

“Foster husband, contact masker!” Xia ruofei said,”we must make him agree to meet us!”

“Yes! Senior granduncle!” Li Yifu replied.

Los Angeles, Bellaire.

In a somewhat retro Spain – style mansion, Elon Musk was discussing with his private doctor and a few Children’s Oncology specialists.

Beside him, his girlfriend, glams, looked Haggard, and he himself was frowning.

He said somewhat impatiently,”so, the only plan now is surgery?” But little X is still so young, can he handle this kind of surgery?”

Elon Musk named his newborn son Little X. It was a very unique name. It was said that it was not only because his company was called SpaceX. Of course, this was also part of the reason, but it seemed to have more meanings.

The personal doctor of Elon Musk, Mannu, exchanged a look with several experts, then nodded cautiously and said,””Mr. Masker, in order to prevent the condition from worsening, we suggest that you have surgery as soon as possible. Of course, because the patient is too young, some risks are inevitable during the surgery. However, we can make sufficient preoperative preparations through scientific means to reduce the risk of the surgery as much as possible. ”

“Dr. Mannu, can you tell me what the success rate of the operation is?”

Manu immediately hesitated. He muttered to himself for a while before saying,””The success rate of the surgery itself should be more than 80%. What we need to pay attention to is the postoperative infection problem, as well as the problems of the immune system brought about by the subsequent radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Of course, the most important thing is the probability of recurrence ... From a macro perspective, these are the standards to measure the success or failure of the surgery when put together.”

“Then, according to this standard, what are the chances of the surgery being successful?” asked Elon Musk.

“About thirty percent.” “If postoperative infection can be avoided and comprehensive treatments such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy are successfully completed, the survival rate should increase to 40 to 50 percent ...” Manu said.
