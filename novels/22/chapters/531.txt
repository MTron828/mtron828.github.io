Chapter 532: Monica’s promise (1)

The night in Hunter Valley was very quiet, and Paradise Farm had long fallen into a deep sleep.

In the quiet and peaceful small villa, mang Zhan was like a raging fire.

It was a crazy night.

The two of them were so exhausted that they didn’t even take a shower. They just hugged each other and fell asleep ...

In the morning, the crisp chirping of birds outside the small villa woke Xia ruofei up.

He felt an itch on his neck. He twisted it gently and found Monica beside him. She was sleeping comfortably in his arms with a satisfied smile on her face.

Xia ruofei’s head ached slightly. It was a normal reaction after a hangover.

He couldn’t help but reach out to rub his temples, a complicated expression on his face.

Xia ruofei finally remembered what had happened last night. Actually, he wasn’t so drunk that he had blacked out. Everything that had happened last night had a lot to do with the restlessness in his heart.

He naturally wouldn’t let wine take the blame for this.

After extreme pleasure, there was more or less a sense of emptiness, and at the same time, there was a sense of guilt. This kind of emotion was very complicated.

Monica was undoubtedly a very attractive woman. Last night’s sex was the most perfect time in Xia ruofei’s life.

However, Xia ruofei asked himself honestly. Even though he had a good impression of Monica, it was far from love. However, they had sex yesterday.

Hence, Xia ruofei naturally felt guilty.

Some were directed at Ling Qingxue, while others were directed at Monica.

Just as Xia ruofei was lost in his thoughts, Monica moved slightly and slowly opened her eyes.

Their eyes met, and Monica’s beautiful face had a faint blush. She then revealed a charming smile and said lazily,””Good Morning, Xia!”

Xia ruofei said awkwardly,””Good ... Good Morning ...” He said.

Monica was still a little shy when she woke up, but it had completely disappeared now. She chuckled and said,””Xia, you didn’t lie to me. I’m really impressed by your performance ...”

Xia ruofei immediately complained in his heart,”a foreign girl is a foreign girl, she’s too open – minded!” This means that not only did I not raise China’s prestige last night, but I was also pushed down by her ...

Seeing Xia ruofei’s awkward expression, Monica couldn’t help but burst out laughing.

At this moment, Xia ruofei was staring straight ahead with his mouth wide open in an ‘O’ shape.

Monica followed Xia ruofei’s gaze and looked over. Her pretty face instantly blushed and at the same time, she looked a little disappointed.

At the end of Xia ruofei’s vision, there was a red blood stain on the white bed sheet. It was like a blooming flower, beautiful and dazzling.

Xia ruofei’s heart trembled.

Before he saw this blood – colored flower, he had always treated last night’s experience as a beautiful encounter. A pair of empty and lonely man and woman, both of whom were quite pleasing to the eye. The man and woman were alone in the long night, so naturally, everything that should have happened happened.

That was all.

However, the blood was like a heavy hammer that hit Xia ruofei’s heart, making him a little dazed.

Things didn’t seem to be the same as he had imagined!

After a long while, Xia ruofei stammered,””Monica ... This ... Last night ... Was it your ... First time?”

Monica’s disappointed expression had long disappeared. She still had a faint smile on her face. She nodded as if she didn’t care and said,”Yup!”

His tone was as relaxed and casual as if he had just had a glass of milk for breakfast.

Monica straightened her body and the blanket on her body slid down. However, Xia ruofei was not in the mood to admire the boundless spring scenery.

He could feel the pressure.

“Xia,” said Monica,”don’t you find it strange?”

Xia ruofei nodded heavily.

Monica was two or three years older than him. Among Western girls, it was rare for them to have no experience in this area. At least, in Xia ruofei’s opinion, Western girls were not conservative in this aspect. It was quite common for them to fall in love in middle school and offer their first time.

Thus, this was something that he had never thought of before. Otherwise, he would not have been so impulsive.

It wasn’t that he didn’t want to take responsibility, but he already had Ling Qingxue.

A night’s short – term relationship was still fine, but if he found another girlfriend, wouldn’t it be a mess?

Monica said easily,”the reason is very simple!” I’ve never met a man who could move my heart before! I’m not an easy woman ...”

Xia ruofei’s expression was a little strange. Monica had been so proactive last night that he thought that she was very open in this aspect. He did not expect the opposite.

“Xia, what are you thinking about?” Monica wrapped her arms around Xia ruofei’s neck and asked.

Xia ruofei hesitated.”Monica, you know. I ... I already have a girlfriend.”

“Uh – huh!” Monica shrugged and asked,”so?”

Xia ruofei considered his words and said,””So, I’m really sorry about what happened last night...If I had known that it was your first time ...”

Monica interrupted Xia ruofei and said,”“stop! Xia, why are you apologizing? We had a great night, didn’t we?”

“Of course, you’re a very charming girl!” Xia ruofei said without hesitation.

Monica smiled happily and said,””Thank you for your praise! You’re also the best man I’ve ever seen! Of course, you’re the only one I’ve tried it with so far ...”

Xia ruofei could not help but smile bitterly.

Monica laughed and said,”Xia, I know what you’re worried about!” In your hometown, if you have a girl’s first time, you must be responsible for her and even marry her, right?”

Xia ruofei smiled awkwardly and said,””Uh ... Actually, not everyone is like this, but I ... The education I received is indeed like this ...”

Monica laughed and said,”okay!” Xia, don’t worry, I’m not a Chinese girl and I’ve never planned to get married! I just want to enjoy the present happiness, it’s that simple!”

To be honest, Xia ruofei did feel a sense of relief after hearing this, but at the same time, he felt a sense of loss.

However, Monica didn’t give Xia ruofei any more time to think.

Exhaling, she said,”Xia, don’t you think the morning is very precious?” Instead of discussing the issue of our first time, why don’t we ...”

At this moment, Xia ruofei’s self – Control was close to zero.

It was another fierce battle.

Monica lay on the bed like a pool of mud, panting as she said,””Xia, you’re the best ...”

“Are you convinced?”

“I’m impressed ...” Monica said softly. She then rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,”Xia, if I remember correctly, your flight is in the morning ...”

Xia ruofei came back to his senses and sat up immediately. He looked at his watch and sighed in relief.””Captain Johnson’s flight route is scheduled to take off at 11 a.m. There’s still nearly three hours left, enough time for me to get to x – n ...”

Although there was enough time, it was obvious that the two of them did not have the time to be intimate. They took a couple’s bath in the bathroom. If it was not for the fact that they had to catch a plane, Xia ruofei definitely would not be able to resist and would have done Monica on the spot again. This Little Vixen was too seductive.

After washing up, changing clothes, and packing their luggage, Xia ruofei and Monica walked out of the room.

The two of them walked down the stairs side by side and saw that Liang Qichao was already waiting for them in the living room.

Liang Qichao smiled when he saw the two of them coming down. Xia ruofei was embarrassed, but Monica giggled and held Xia ruofei’s arm. She greeted Liang Qichao.

Liang Qichao had already prepared a simple breakfast. Xia ruofei and Monica finished it quickly and left Paradise Farm in the Mercedes – Benz that Liang Qichao had prepared.

On the way back to xxx from Paradise Farm, they would pass by the resort hotel that Monica had booked.

The car drove for about 20 minutes before they arrived at the resort hotel.

Monica opened the door and got out of the car. Xia ruofei also got out from the other side. He walked with Monica in the direction of the hotel and said,”Monica, I’ll send you off here. Let’s meet again if fate allows!”

Monica nodded with a smile and said,””Xia, I think ... I’ll probably miss ... Your body!”

“That’s what I wanted to say!”Xia ruofei nodded.

“Goodbye!”

“Goodbye!”

Xia ruofei waved at Monica. Monica took a few steps forward and turned back. She leaned close to Xia ruofei’s ear and whispered,””Xia, you’ve really screwed me over this time ...”

“What’s wrong?”Xia ruofei asked, confused.

Monica laughed and said,”compared to you, all the men I know are weak chickens!” How can I be interested in other men in the future?”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He didn’t know if he should be proud of this. It sounded like a compliment, but why did he feel so strange?

Monica looked at Xia ruofei’s dumbfounded expression and could not help but giggle.

She whispered into Xia ruofei’s ear,””So ... I’ve decided to follow the example of you Huaxia women and temporarily keep my body pure for you, unless there’s a man stronger than you who can move my heart!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”Monica, then you’re definitely going to be alone. I’m sure!”

Monica laughed and said,”I can call you when I need you!” At most, I’ll reimburse you for the plane tickets to and from Italy?”

“Then wouldn’t I be a call boy?” Xia ruofei said with a depressed expression on purpose.

“Are you willing?” Monica asked with a smile.

Xia ruofei said seriously,”okay!” Although I really want to say that I’m not willing, in fact ... I can consider this!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

To be honest, Xia ruofei felt a sense of achievement when Monica said “chastity”. Although he was not a traditional male chauvinist, he could not tolerate the woman who had slept with him sleeping with another man.

Of course, he did not have any status with Monica, so he had no right to ask Monica to do anything.

However, it was a different story now that Monica had taken the initiative to say it.

Monica gently kissed Xia ruofei’s cheek and said,””Xia, goodbye!”

“Goodbye, Monica!” Xia ruofei said.

He watched Monica turn around elegantly and walk further and further away. He also felt a little lost.

Xia ruofei only turned around and walked back to Liang Qichao’s Mercedes – Benz after Monica’s figure disappeared from the hotel entrance.
