2029 Treasure hunt (1)

Old Gehrman’s face was filled with madness, while the others were horrified. Monica couldn’t help but close her eyes, her face filled with despair.

However, after a few seconds, the violent explosion that everyone had imagined did not happen. The scene was dead silent.

Monica couldn’t help but open her eyes. She saw that everyone was equally shocked. Old Gehrman looked as if he had seen a Ghost as he kept pressing the button on the remote control. Xia ruofei, on the other hand, was still smiling and looking on calmly.

When they first found out that there was a large amount of explosives buried under the house, everyone except Xia ruofei felt their hearts Twitch when they saw old Gelman’s fingers move.

However, now that she saw his exaggerated actions, she felt that it was comical no matter how she looked at it. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Old Gelman’s heart was also broken.

He wasn’t bluffing, nor was he reluctant to die at the last moment. The actual situation was that no matter how hard he pressed, the button didn’t move at all.

Was this not a ghost?

Xia ruofei looked like he was watching a show. He crossed his arms and looked at old Gelman with a smile. After a while, he walked toward him.

Seeing this, old ghelman shouted in horror,””Don’t come over! If you come any closer, I’ll press it!”

Monica couldn’t help but burst out laughing and said,””Haven’t you already pressed it a few times? Why isn’t it exploding?”

The brothers of the Hong sect couldn’t help but burst into laughter. The originally tense and tragic atmosphere was suddenly destroyed.

Xia ruofei walked in front of old Gelman and said as if he was coaxing a child,””Be good, this thing is very dangerous, let me take care of it!”

With that, Xia ruofei easily removed old Gelman’s fingers and took the remote control from him.

Old Gehrman was like a person who had been cast with a petrifying spell. He stood there in a daze without any resistance. It was only when Xia ruofei turned around and left that he collapsed limply on the ground as if his spine had been pulled out.

Xia ruofei put the remote control in his pocket. In fact, he put it in the spirit map space to cut off the signal.

He knew very well that old Gehrman was not bluffing. There was indeed a large number of explosives buried underground. He had just used his mental power to control objects remotely to lock the button. So, even if old Gehrman used all his strength, he would not be able to press the button.

Now that he had the remote control, if he accidentally touched it, it was likely to cause an earth – shattering explosion. Even if he was a Qi cultivation stage cultivator, it would be difficult for him to escape.

Therefore, it was safer to keep it in the space.

Xia ruofei turned to Lu zhengfeng and asked,””Zhengfeng, what’s the situation outside?”

“Sir, the Gelman Manor is already under our control!” Lu zhengfeng looked excited.”From tonight onwards, the name of the Gelman family can be said to be removed from Turin!”

He couldn’t control his excitement. Ever since he followed lui hai, lui zhengfeng had been operating in Duling city for several years, but his achievements were not as good as tonight.

It could be said that after tonight, the Hong sect’s branch in Turin would be the real boss of the underground world. Their power and territory would double.

This feeling was too good!

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”tell your men to hurry up and clean up the battlefield!” Let’s evacuate as soon as possible! Maybe the police will come and join in the fun, who knows?”

“Yes!” Lu zhengfeng said.

“Right, you don’t have to clean up the surveillance cameras!” Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”pick something valuable and useful to you. We’ll leave after you take it!”

Lu zhengfeng was stunned for a moment, but out of his fanatical admiration for Xia ruofei, he had definitely become Xia ruofei’s die – hard fan after tonight’s incident. He would definitely carry out Xia ruofei’s words without hesitation.

Therefore, Lu zhengfeng immediately passed down the order. The brothers of the Hong sect began to clean up the battlefield in the spacious Manor. There were even small – scale battles in some places. Some people hid in the beginning and did not escape in the chaos.

But overall, the situation was set.

On the other side, Lu zhengfeng’s trusted brothers had also arrested old Gelman and his butlers and bodyguards.

Although old Gehrman was still alive, he was like a walking corpse. No matter how the brothers of the Hong sect tied him up, he did not resist.

While the brothers of the Hong sect were cleaning up the battlefield, Xia ruofei was not idle. He squatted in front of old Gelman and said with interest,””Mr. Gelman, I’ve heard that the big families in Europe have their own treasure rooms. I’m very interested in your family’s treasure room! I wonder if you can take us on a tour?”

Old Gehrman shot a cold glance at Xia ruofei and closed his eyes without saying a word. It was obvious that he had lost all desire to live.

Xia ruofei felt bored. He looked at Rousey, who was sitting in the wheelchair, and asked with a smile,””Rousey, if there’s a treasure vault in this house, where do you think it’s most likely to be?”

Old Gehrman had closed his eyes tightly, looking as if he had nothing to live for. However, after hearing Xia ruofei’s words, he could not help but open his eyes and look at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei did not seem to see old Gehrman and continued to smile at Rossi.
