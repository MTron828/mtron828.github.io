Chapter 1667: Flying genius (2)

Captain Brook often flew on this route, so he could roughly determine the location of the plane. Of course, since Wilkinson had deliberately deviated the plane from the route, Brook’s judgment might not be very accurate, but only a rough area.

Fortunately, with the guidance of the ground radar, the plane would not lose its direction in the vast sea.

Captain Brook thought quickly and finally made a decision considering that QSO had a base at Saipan airport, which might be relatively convenient for ground coordination. In addition, he was relatively more familiar with Saipan airport.

“We’ve decided to force Saipan to surrender! QF108?”Captain Brook said decisively,”please provide us with radar guidance! In addition, due to the loss of cabin pressure, we request to maintain a height of ten thousand feet!”

Xia ruofei heard intermittent voices from his earphones.””QF108, agreed to maintain 10000 feet. I will guide you back to the route to Saipan. Please turn left to 150!”

Xia ruofei saw that Brook was trying his best to press on his headphones and was dumbfounded. He knew that he must not have heard what the other party said. Hence, he acted as a mouthpiece again and repeated the administrator’s words.

“Please confirm the order. Maintain a distance of 10000 feet and turn left to 150! QF108!”Brook repeated the officer’s order.

“Your retelling is correct!” The administrator said.

“Understood, QF108!” The order was short this time, and Brook responded quickly.

Then, he started to guide Xia ruofei on how to use the control stick and the steering wheel to turn the plane.

The turning of the plane seemed simple. It was just stepping on the rudder or turning the control stick. Both methods could make the plane turn, but in fact, if only the control stick was used to control the ailerons to make the plane turn, the plane would tilt. However, the direction of the nose was actually not turned, so the whole turning process was very slow and the resistance was particularly large. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

If only the rudder was used to control it, the nose of the plane would suddenly turn without the fuselage tilting, and the direction of the airflow on the wings would change drastically. The lift would drop, and the force on the fuselage would increase, which would lead to the rapid descent of the plane.

The correct way to do this was to coordinate the control stick and the rudder so that the aircraft would tilt and turn at the same time. Only in this way could the aircraft draw a smooth, round, and perfect curve in the air without any change in height.

To an experienced pilot, this might be an instinctive action. However, to a rookie like Xia ruofei, it was very difficult.

Hence, after Brook had explained the way to turn the corner to Xia ruofei, he did not have much hope for Xia ruofei’s operation. He did not expect stability or perfection. It would be good as long as he could turn the corner.

Xia ruofei was indeed a little flustered at the beginning. Either he pushed the rudder too hard and the control stick didn’t work well, or the control stick turned and the rudder didn’t keep up. The plane’s height fluctuated up and down as it turned.

However, Xia ruofei’s learning ability was also very strong after he had cultivated the great Dao Arts. He mastered it very quickly, especially in events that required a high level of physical coordination.

After a while, Xia ruofei had figured it out. During the next turn, the plane tilted slightly to the left and the nose turned left. The plane drew an arc in the air and the altitude meter maintained the same number throughout the entire process.

Brook couldn’t help but be a little dumbfounded. This talent for learning was too strong! This simple turning action might take a pilot several hours of practice and still not be so perfect. However, Xia ruofei had only used one or two minutes and already had the feeling of a veteran pilot.

If not for Xia ruofei’s previous performance as a complete newbie who knew almost nothing about passenger planes, Brook would have thought that Xia ruofei was joking. She was just an experienced pilot!

Brook quickly recovered from the shock as they had arrived at 140. He quickly said,””Xia! We’ll start slowly leveling the plane now!”

Actually, there was no need for Brook’s reminder. Xia ruofei had already reduced the slope turn slowly. The traffic control requested for the plane to change course 150. He definitely could not wait until course 150 to take action. The plane needed a response time to change from a turn to a direct flight. By then, it would definitely turn around.

If the plane was controlled on autopilot, the whole process would definitely be quite smooth and accurate. When it reached course 150, the plane would just turn straight. The people in the plane would not feel the change that was too big or too rapid.

However, if it was manually operated by a pilot, it would naturally not be as precise as computer control. There would be some left and right adjustments.

However, Xia ruofei’s turn seemed to be on an autopilot. When the plane reached 150, the plane’s attitude became flat and it started to fly in this direction.

Brook was even more surprised. He would rather believe that this was a blind cat that had found a dead rat. Otherwise, it was too shocking for a rookie who had only been in contact with transport helicopters to be able to fly a large jet to this extent.

Brook believed that even if he was not injured and was personally piloting the plane, this was probably the best he could do.

The next flight would be under the guidance of the air traffic control. During this period, two air traffic control areas were switched. Along the way, the air traffic control along the way placed this aircraft, which had declared a state of emergency, as the first row. They cleared the airspace early, and the route was smooth and unobstructed.

Brook also got in touch with quaohang base in Saipan.

When the flight deviated from the route from the radar, qindustan received the news immediately. It could be said that the entire company was worried. Now that they had finally contacted each other, and although the plane was damaged, there were no casualties, it could be said that it was a blessing in disguise.

Qinba also quickly took action, coordinating with Saipan’s airport, customs, Inspection and Quarantine, hospitals, and other aspects.

Saipan airport had also transferred other planes to clear the airspace for flight QF108.

Throughout the flight, Brook had to admit that Xia ruofei was a genius at flying. It could be said that he had learned the manual control of the plane from scratch. However, he was so fast that it was shocking. Xia ruofei’s progress could be seen with every turn and altitude adjustment of the plane.

As the plane approached Saipan airport, an area was drawn out on the ground for the plane to drain oil. The flight was heading for Australia. It was not even halfway through the flight, and there was still a large amount of Aviation Oil in the fuel tank. If it landed directly, the plane’s landing gear and structure might be damaged.

Especially when the pilot was a rookie who had never received one minute of training on an empty plane, a heavy landing would be even more dangerous.

Fortunately, there was an experienced captain, Brook, on the plane. Although he could not control the plane due to his arm injury, he could take on the task of air – to – ground communication and give Xia ruofei guidance at any time.

Hence, the entire process of releasing the oil went very smoothly. After some calculations, Captain Brook decided to release 10 tons of Aviation Oil. This number was less than the theoretical number. Considering that Xia ruofei had no flying experience, Captain Brook did not dare to expect a successful landing.

Since he was planning to go back, he naturally had to leave some Aviation Oil.

Soon, the plane gradually descended under The Command of the Air traffic controller. This time, the landing did not follow the standard entry procedures, because the ground already knew the current condition of the plane. At the same time, the other planes had been directed to hover in different airspace, so everything was naturally simple.

Under Captain Brook’s constant reminder and guidance, Xia ruofei gradually approached Saipan airport. Brook’s heart was in his mouth as well. It was finally time to test if Xia ruofei was a true flying genius ...
