Chapter 663: Spirit map world’s tea house (3)

Making money was secondary. Increasing the brand’s popularity had always been Xia ruofei’s goal. Taoyuan meat workshop could provide the best succulent seedlings and become an important chain for Taoyuan’s brand to become high – end.

Moreover, the price of the succulent seedlings in Taoyuan butcher shop was not cheap. If the quantity was large, the profit would be quite considerable.

No one would be against money.

Just as Xia ruofei was about to leave the medium, Xia Qing suddenly said,””Master, the tea leaves are ready to be picked. Do you want me to pick them and make tea? The tea leaves from the previous round have already been wasted ...”

Xia ruofei asked in surprise,”you know how to make tea?” Have you learned how to make Da Hong Pao?”

“Master, I don’t need to learn it,” Xia Qing said with a smile.”I’ve been born with the craft of making Da Hong Pao in my mind.”

Only then did Xia ruofei realize that he had unconsciously treated Xia Qing as a living person.

After this period of interaction, Xia ruofei had already figured out that Xia Qing’s soul puppet was actually a high – Level intelligent robot. The interaction between human and machine could definitely pass off as the real thing. If she went to take the Turing test, she would definitely pass with a full score without a doubt.

The skills that Xia Qing had mastered were equivalent to the built – in program when producing Intelligent Robots. Without this program, he naturally wouldn’t have this skill.

However, as an advanced mech, Xia Qing could also learn new skills.

Xia ruofei roughly understood that Xia Qing’s main ability was in the field of spiritual plants, which was equivalent to an “agricultural assistance robot”. However, the “agriculture” here was quite high – end.

Xia ruofei also asked Xia Qing a few questions about the origin of the spirit map world, the situation of the previous master, and so on. Xia Qing also didn’t know anything.

As for the cultivation and care of spiritual plants, and even the breeding of spiritual beasts, he was very proficient in them.

......

“Since you have the ability, you don’t have to ask me for instructions when the tea leaves ripen. Just pick the tea leaves directly!” Xia ruofei said.

“Alright! Thank you for your trust, master!” Xia Qing said happily.

“By the way, you should need some tools to make the Da Hong Pao, right?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Master, I can cut down most of the tools at the Archean realm to make them myself ...” Xia Qing said.

“Don ‘t!” Xia ruofei quickly interrupted him and said,”I’ll prepare whatever you need from the outside world and send it to you!”

What a joke. The wood here was the priceless gold Phoebe nanmu. The oak tree in the new space was also filled with the highest quality truffles. If any one of them was cut off, Xia ruofei would be heartbroken for a long time.

Xia ruofei carefully asked Xia Qing what tools she needed.

From Xia Qing’s description, Xia ruofei found that the tools used were similar to the ones used by li Zhifu last time. It seemed that li Zhifu’s tea – making skills had been passed down for many years.

After he was confident, Xia ruofei asked Xia Qing to pick the tea leaves and store them well. Anyway, in the spirit map world, things could be kept for a long time and there was no need to worry about going bad.

After leaving the spirit map world, Xia ruofei gave ye Lingyun a call and asked him to help buy a set of traditional tea – making tools at Mount Wuyi.

Ye Lingyun carried out Xia ruofei’s orders very quickly.

He quickly found an old craftsman on Mount Wuyi and made a set of the tools and utensils that Xia ruofei needed. Then, he hired a truck to transport them to Sanshan city.

After Xia ruofei received the goods from the rented warehouse, he directly sent them into the spirit map space. Then, he bought some red bricks, charcoal and the like according to Xia Qing’s request and sent them into the spirit map space as well.

The spirit map world’s Red robe workshop was thus established.

However, Xia ruofei had asked Xia Qing to leave the tea – making to the mountain sea realm. After all, the Archean realm only had an area of eight mu, and there were many precious crops. Space was very tight. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Meanwhile, the mountain and sea realm was extremely spacious, and there was no need to worry about not having enough space.

Xia Qing was full of energy as she started to take care of the spiritual plants and make Da Hong Pao. Xia ruofei left the medium and returned to the outside world.

After a few more days, the ten children with autism had recovered after a few treatments.

The ten families shed tears of gratitude and ended the drug test.

As for Chengcheng, he had already fully recovered. However, Xue Biyun did not return to Hong Kong and was still helping Xia ruofei with the drug testing.

Xue bi Yun’s family was originally from the three mountains. Now that Chengcheng had recovered, she didn’t want to return to Hong Kong, which had hurt her so much. She was prepared to settle down in the three mountains.

Xue Biyun’s family was still in a difficult situation. At the same time, because she had taken care of Chengcheng all year round, Xue Biyun had a deep understanding of autism. Hence, Xia ruofei had simply recruited her into the pharmaceutical company. At the moment, her main role was to assist in drug testing and to act as a helper for Xue Jinshan and the rest.

The second stage of the experiment had ended, and Xue Jinshan’s team had also officially completed their application report for the new drug.

With the data from this experiment, many of the contents of the report were supported by arguments.

After Xia ruofei and Feng Jing looked at it and felt that there were no problems, they asked Xue Jinshan to bring the two of them to the capital city to begin the long road of approval for the new medicine.

Xia ruofei couldn’t stay idle either. The approval of the new medicine was very important, so he decided to visit Tian Huilan.

She believed that with her as a provincial leader, at least the provincial Drug Administration department’s first review should not have any problems.
