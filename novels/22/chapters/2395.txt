2396 Long – distance raid (2)

The set of radio equipment was just a spare. There was another set in a building in the training camp. At that time, Xia ruofei thought that it was too troublesome to dismantle and it was not very useful, so he did not take it. The set in the warehouse was packed and had a complete set of spare parts, so Xia ruofei kept it in the warehouse.

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei immediately immersed his mind into the spirit map space and quickly found the batch of resources from the barsoco training camp that he had stored.

As expected, a whole set of radio equipment was among the supplies.

Xia ruofei was overjoyed. He quickly asked manchila telepathically,””What about the codebook? Could it be in that villa?”

Under normal circumstances, the radio and the password book would not be placed together. Otherwise, in the event of an accident, the two things would fall into the hands of the enemy, and the other party would be able to pass off their identity to send messages to the mercenary group, and also monitor the messages sent by the mercenary group.

Manchila heard the anger in Xia ruofei’s voice and replied in fear,””Master, the password book is an electronic version, stored in the computer on the island in the secret room. When I need to contact the mercenary group, there’s a special messenger. He only knows how to send and copy the news. I personally completed the translation work. ”

In other words, the messenger of manchila could only send and receive the contents of The Telegraph, but he did not understand the meaning of these numbers. Every time he received the content, manchila would translate it through a codebook. After receiving it, he would also hand over the original content to manchila, and manchila would translate the electricity himself.

This ensured the safety of information to a large extent.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but admire the strict and cautious nature of the modr organization. As for manchila’s Messenger in arulei, Xia ruofei didn’t care too much.

Anyway, the messenger probably didn’t know who he was contacting and he didn’t have the password book. Even if he found out that Xia ruofei was missing, he couldn’t use the radio to inform the mercenary group.

At that time, there were two laptops in the secret room. One was used to connect to the internet, and the other was an isolated computer that was physically isolated from the internet. Xia ruofei had kept both laptops.

In other words, the password was with him, and he didn’t need to return to arulei to find it.

Xia ruofei secretly heaved a sigh of relief. After asking for the location of the password book, he carefully asked about the habit of sending messages when contacting the mercenary group.

Manchila was not hypnotized, but his life was in Xia ruofei’s hands. He did not dare to have any thoughts about Xia ruofei’s question and told him everything without hiding anything. He even took the initiative to tell Xia ruofei the questions that he had not considered.

For example, when manchila sent a message to the modr mercenary group, he would add a string of meaningless numbers at the end of the message. This string of numbers would also change according to the different dates. As long as this string of numbers was seen at the end of the message, it must be manchila’s own message.

This was equivalent to an anti – counterfeit logo. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Manchila had completely given up. In his eyes, Xia ruofei was an invincible God. Since Xia ruofei had set his eyes on the modr mercenary group, then the mercenary group would not be able to escape. In that case, he did not dare to hold back. He only hoped to perform well and get Xia ruofei’s appreciation.

Otherwise, when Xia ruofei was done with the mercenary group and found out that he was hiding something, he would have a terrible ending.

As for the life and death of the mercenary group, manchila did not even consider it. These people had always been cold – hearted.

Of course, as for the anti – counterfeit symbol, because the algorithm was more complicated, there was a small software saved in the computer. As long as you entered a date, it would automatically generate the string of codes of that day.

This software was like a password book that was stored in a folder. Xia ruofei would find it when he looked for it.

Instead of waiting for Xia ruofei to find out and then asking, it was better to take the initiative to say it so that Xia ruofei would have a good impression of her.

Now that Xia ruofei’s spiritual power had broken through a major realm, his memory was much better than ordinary people. Although manchila’s words were complicated, Xia ruofei could remember them all after listening to them once.

With a thought, he took out the isolated island laptop from the space. After turning it on, he followed the hidden path provided by manchila and quickly found the codebook document. There was also a small software in the folder that specialized in generating anti – counterfeit string codes.

There was also a similar software in the modr mercenary group, controlled by Douglas.

The algorithm of this codebook was very complicated, and it didn’t seem to be fabricated to fool people.

However, Xia ruofei was cautious by nature. He would not easily believe manchila’s words when he was not hypnotized.

He muttered to himself for a moment, and then used his mind to mobilize the invisible spatial force to suppress manchila.

Manchila was caught off guard in the space and almost instantly fell into a state of unconsciousness.

When he lost consciousness, he was shocked. His last thought was,”Did I say something wrong that made master angry? Or is it because I didn’t take the initiative to tell you about the radio station? Did he make his master unhappy?

The next moment, Xia ruofei moved manchila out of space and threw him on the passenger seat.

Then, he slapped the unconscious manchila awake and immediately released his mental power at full force, shrouding manchila.

Manchila woke up with a dazed look on her face. Before she could come to her senses, she was directly attacked by Xia ruofei’s spiritual power and entered a state of deep hypnosis.

That day at arulei temple, manchila still had the intention to resist, but now he was disheartened. Furthermore, he had not cultivated for a few days and was injured. He was in a very weak state, so he was hypnotized by Xia ruofei in an instant.

Under the surveillance of Xia ruofei’s spiritual power, manchila could not pretend to be hypnotized.

Xia ruofei started to ask questions one by one, and the content was what manchila had told him just now.

Manchila, who was in a state of hypnosis, naturally would not hide anything. He repeated what he had just said like pouring out beans from a bamboo tube.

Xia ruofei made a comparison and confirmed that manchila was not playing any tricks this time. He did not hide anything or deceive anyone. He then withdrew his spiritual force and threw manchila back into the spirit map space.

Manchila felt the world spinning around him. When he woke up, he found himself on the bed in the mobile house again. At this time, everything that had happened during the hypnosis also appeared in his mind.

Xia ruofei’s calm voice was heard in manchila’s ear.””Not bad, you didn’t hide anything from me. Rest well!”

Manchila’s back broke out in a cold sweat. He did not expect Xia ruofei to be so cautious despite his strength. At the same time, he was secretly glad that he did not play any tricks. Otherwise, what awaited him now would not be Xia ruofei’s light words.

Xia ruofei thought for a moment, then started the car and continued West according to the route he had just planned.

He was still a few hundred kilometers away from the poeta region. If he contacted the modr mercenary group now, they might have already left by the time he arrived. Wouldn’t he have to contact them again then? Moreover, if he asked about the location of the mercenary group frequently in a day, it would raise Douglas ‘vigilance.

Hence, Xia ruofei decided to contact the modr mercenary group when he reached the poeta region.

That night, Xia ruofei drove at full speed through the war zone. He used his spiritual power to avoid danger several times and avoided the marching troops twice. Xia ruofei did not know if the other party was the government army or the anti – Government armed forces. Anyway, he sensed that there was a large group of troops moving and avoided them in advance.

Xia ruofei finally arrived at a small town called Debra in the poeta region when the sky was slightly bright. It was only about ten kilometers away from the place where the modr mercenary group had been stationed.
