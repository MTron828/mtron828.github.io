“What do you mean by fine?” Dong Yun’s tone was a little excited.”What else can I do? If you weren’t injured, would the store let you go home early to rest?”

At this point, Dong Yun asked in anger and heartache,”Mom, where are you hurt? Are you okay?”

“There’s a little burn on my back. It’s no big deal!” Zheng Shuying said.

“Let me see!”

Dong Yun walked over and carefully lifted up Zheng Shuying’s clothes. When she saw the red Burn marks on her mother’s back, Dong Yun’s tears couldn’t help but fall.

“Little Yun, mom is really fine!” Zheng Shuying quickly put down her clothes and comforted him,”the medicine that the young man gave me was very effective. It doesn’t hurt anymore!”

Dong Yun had just seen the news and naturally knew about this detail. She asked doubtfully,””Really? I think it’s quite serious. Do you want to go to the hospital to deal with it?”

“There’s really no need, I’m much better!”Zheng Shuying quickly said.

At that time, the heating in the shop was more sufficient. In addition, she had been working, so Zheng Shuying only wore a thin layer of clothes. The temperature of the hot soup was lowered after passing through the layer of clothes, so her injury was not as serious as Xia ruofei ‘s.

However, if she had not used the ointment that Xia ruofei had given her in time, there was a high possibility that there would be blisters. After using the medicine once, her injury was much better. Moreover, after applying the medicine, there was a cool feeling on the wound instead of the burning feeling that came from the burns.

Hearing her mother’s words and seeing that there was no blister or pus on the burn, Dong Yun nodded and said,””Alright, I’ll listen to you.”

“However, you have to listen to me this once. Let’s not do this job anymore. Can you resign tomorrow?” Dong Yun continued.

“Why did you resign out of the blue?” Zheng Shuying disagreed.”I told you it was just an accident. I usually do the cleaning in the shop, how could there be any danger?”

“No matter if it’s dangerous or not, I don’t want you to do it anymore.” Dong Yun said,”we’re not short of money now. Why do you have to work so hard? You’re already at this age, but you’re still working hard outside. People who don’t know you would think that I’m unfilial!”

Zheng Shuying rebuked,”you silly child, what are you saying!” Mom isn’t old enough to need you to take care of her!”

“Mom ...” Dong Yun held her mother’s hand and dragged out her words,”just listen to me this once!”

Zheng Shuying, who was used to her daughter’s fiery style, had goosebumps all over her body. She said helplessly,””Alright, alright, alright ... Let’s put this matter aside for now, okay? It didn’t matter if he wanted to resign or not, at least he had to finish it in the few days before the new year! Otherwise, where are you going to recruit people at this time?”

As the Spring Festival approached, it was common for migrant workers to return to their hometown. Now that Zheng Shuying was resigning, the grilled fish shop really couldn’t find any cleaning staff in a short time.

Dong Yun also knew that this was her mother’s stalling tactic, but she also knew that she couldn’t force her too much. In the past, it was because she was far away in the United States and couldn’t do anything. Now, since she was at home, she would nag her in her ear when she had nothing to do. She had to pester her until she agreed!

This was only the first step of Dong Yun’s plan. Her ultimate goal was naturally to hope that her mother would follow her to live in the city where she had just taken up a new job.

If he could make his mother resign, he would be closer to his next goal. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Alright, you go back to your room and rest for a while!” Zheng Shuying said,”I’m going out to buy some groceries. I’ll make you a good meal tonight!”

It had been a few days since her daughter returned to the country. As she had been eating during her working hours, she had not had a proper meal with her daughter. Zheng Shuying was filled with guilt.

Today, he would take advantage of the half – day leave he had from his injury to make it up to his daughter.

“Mom, you’re injured. Don’t move!” He said. Dong Yun quickly said,”I’ll take care of dinner, okay?”

Zheng Shuying looked at her daughter with a faint smile and asked,””How are you going to settle this? Order delivery? Don’t tell me you’ve learned how to cook now ...”

Dong Yun said with some embarrassment,”Actually, take – out isn’t that bad these days. It’s quite formal and not as bad as you say ... By the way, doesn’t the grilled fish shop you work at also provide online order services?”

“Alright, alright!” Zheng Shuying smiled and said,”it’s fine if I have a little burn on my back. I’ll cook tonight, so you don’t have to worry about it. Rest well at home, I’m going to buy some groceries!”

“Alright! Then I’ll have to trouble mom!” Dong Yun said in embarrassment.

After Zheng Shuying went out to buy groceries, Dong Yun went back to her room and turned on her computer. She opened the PC website of the Sanshan Evening News and couldn’t help but click on the front page of the news to read it again.

After the post – editing by the newspaper, the video showed Xia ruofei’s two quick reactions and the process of catching the boiling stone pot with his bare hands in slow motion. Dong Yun was even more frightened after watching it.

She couldn’t imagine how serious the damage would be if the stone pot had hit her mother’s back.

If that was the case, her mother would not have suffered a minor injury like she did now. She would have been able to go out to buy groceries and cook at home. She might have even seen her mother in the hospital.

At the same time, Dong Yun was filled with gratitude for this brave young man.
