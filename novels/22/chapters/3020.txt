3021 Ocean of resources (Part 1)(2)

The storage ring’s space was limited, and it was not easy to count all these things when they were all piled up together.

These things almost filled up the space that was the size of a basketball court.

Of course, what occupied most of the space was the large pile of spirit stones and a few other pots and jars.

At this time, Bai Qingqing had also come back to her senses.

It looked at Xia ruofei’s back, which was at the foot of the mountain, in shock.

With its understanding of space rules, it could tell that Xia ruofei’s attainment in space rules had surpassed its by a lot.

Under normal circumstances, even if Bai Qingqing was extremely talented, it was impossible for her to make such a huge leap in progress, unless she had some kind of fortuitous encounter.

At the thought of this, Bai Qingqing’s eyes lit up, and she quickly followed him.

Xia ruofei said without turning his head,”don’t look ... I cracked it alone, so it’s all mine!” Even if you see it, you’ll only be envious ...”

Bai Qingqing glanced at the items and said indifferently,””We don’t have any world stones. These cultivation resources might be precious to you humans, but they aren’t attractive to me. If you don’t want to give it to me, then don’t give it to me!”

Xia ruofei turned to look at Bai Qingqing in surprise and said,””You’re actually so free and easy this time?”

Based on Xia ruofei’s understanding of Bai Qingqing, even if she had no use for these things, even if Xia ruofei solved it on his own, as long as both parties had agreed on the split, she would not let it go easily.

It wasn’t an exaggeration to describe Bai Qingqing as a goose that plucked its feathers.

However, it did not get any advantage from Xia ruofei. Every time, Xia ruofei would eat it up.

Bai Qingqing said,’I’ve always been this free and easy! You still have a great use for these things, so why waste them for me?”

Xia ruofei shook his head and stared at Bai Qingqing.””That’s not like you. There must be a reason for this abnormality, speak! What are you trying to do?”

Bai Qingqing smiled obsequiously and said,”I wouldn’t dare to have any ulterior motives!” I’m just here to watch the fun, go do your thing, don’t mind me ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”really?” I’ve given you a chance to say it, but you didn ‘t. There won’t be such a shop after this village!”

With that, Xia ruofei turned around and prepared to organize the cultivation resources.

Seeing this, Bai Qingqing quickly came to Xia ruofei and said,””Boss! Boss! Don’t be like this ...”

“Now you’re willing to tell me?” Xia ruofei asked with a faint smile.

Bai Qingqing smiled apologetically.”Actually ... I just want to know why boss’s spatial mastery has suddenly become so high. Even I have to look up to you. We are in the same boat. If anything good happens, don’t forget me, boss!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be speechless. He couldn’t tell before that this little guy was actually so cheap. When he needed help, he would call him “boss”. Before this, he had called him “Xia ruofei” without any politeness. He didn’t have any awareness of living under someone else’s roof.

Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”you want to know?”

“I want to, I want to!” Bai Qingqing nodded her head like a chicken pecking at rice, and even wagged her tail, as if she had suddenly become a docile pug.

Xia ruofei said,”you want to know why my spatial skills have become so powerful? the reason is simple. It’s just two words. I’m working hard!”

Bai Qingqing was stunned. She never thought that Xia ruofei would give such an answer.

Xia ruofei continued,””Little white! There were no shortcuts to success. You only saw the success of others, but you didn’t see the sweat and blood behind it! The reason why I’m able to study the laws of space so deeply is because of my tireless efforts to comprehend them day and night!”

Only then did Bai Qingqing come back to her senses. A hint of disdain flashed in her eyes as she mumbled,””I’m not a three – year – old child ... I know very well how good your spatial comprehension is! How long has it been? Even if you’ve comprehended it without rest since you were born, it’s also impossible to reach your current achievements!”

Bai Qingqing felt insulted and finally put down her pride to ask for advice, but Xia ruofei had actually given her Chicken Soup for the Soul ...

Xia ruofei said seriously,”I’m not lying!” My current comprehension of the laws of space is all from my own personal comprehension. If you don’t believe me, then forget it. ”

“Really?” Bai Qingqing did not believe that.

“It’s up to you to believe it or not. ” Xia ruofei said,”I can tell you clearly that I didn’t take any shortcuts in comprehending the spatial rules. However, that’s all I can tell you. If there’s a suitable opportunity in the future ...”

Bai Qingqing’s spatial perception was too terrifying. Xia ruofei did not dare to show Bai Qingqing the mysterious ore. At least for now, he did not have the intention to do so.

Otherwise, Bai Qingqing could become an unstable factor that would escape his control, especially since it could affect the safety of the spirit map space.

For the spirit map space, which was the most important, Xia ruofei would never allow any unstable factors to appear.

In the future, when Xia ruofei had completely comprehended the spatial laws within the ore, he would consider Bai Qingqing. Of course, the premise was that it was safe and controllable.

Bai Qingqing could tell that there was something unusual in Xia ruofei’s words. She quickly called out,””Don’t come in the future! Boss! Boss! Why don’t you tell me now! I’m ... I’m just thirsty for knowledge!”

Xia ruofei smiled and did not continue Bai Qingqing’s conversation. Instead, he began to sort out the supplies that had been excavated from the small nested spaces.

The meaning was already very clear. There was no room for discussion at all.

Bai Qingqing followed Xia ruofei obsequiously, begging him non – stop, but Xia ruofei ignored her.

Bai Qingqing knew that there was no room for negotiation.

It couldn’t help but feel a little dejected, but at the same time, it was very unwilling.

In fact, although Xia ruofei had told it with certainty that all his understanding of the rules of space was gained through his own efforts, it firmly believed that Xia ruofei must have a special method. Otherwise, no matter how hard he worked, he could not have achieved such an achievement in such a short time.

Besides, Xia ruofei did not give a definite answer in the end, which further explained the existence of this special method.

It was a pity that Xia ruofei was too tight – lipped. No matter how it tried to beat around the bush, he did not say a word. It could be said that he was unmoved by force or persuasion! Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The boundary Fox was a natural – born pet of space. It was extremely talented in the laws of space, and at the same time, it was very close to the laws of space.

So, when Bai Qingqing found out that there was a way to quickly improve her spatial mastery, but the method was clearly there for her to know, the feeling of being unable to hold back was unbearable.

Bai Qingqing felt like her heart was being scratched, and she was not even interested in learning the spatial rules of the spirit map.

However, it also knew that since Xia ruofei had made up his mind not to tell it, it would be useless no matter how much it pestered him.

Anyway, Xia ruofei didn’t make a promise. There would definitely be more chances in the future.

Bai Qingqing could only think this way.

Bai Qingqing, who was a little unwilling, also turned her attention to the mountain of cultivation resources.

Suddenly, it stared at the small mountain of ordinary spirit stones, and its eyes lit up.

...

Bai Qingqing quickly looked at Xia ruofei and realized that he was still sorting the resources into different categories. It was as if he did not notice that he was in a daze.

Bai Qingqing heaved a sigh of relief. She cleared her throat and said,””That ... Boss, the harvest this time is not small!”

Naturally, Bai Qingqing was trying to find a topic to talk about. Xia ruofei did not have time to respond to her, so he just hummed in agreement.

Bai Qingqing immediately said,”boss, you were the one who solved this nested space. I shouldn’t have asked you to share the benefits.” But this time, I’ve gained so much, and as the saying goes, everyone who sees it will have a share. Can you symbolically share a little with me? It means the same thing, even one Spirit stone is fine!”
