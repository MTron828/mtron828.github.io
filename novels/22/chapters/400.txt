Chapter 401: I’m still a child (1)

When song Rui was about to reach Tao Yuan farm, he called Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei informed the security guard at the entrance. He thought that song Rui came alone. However, when the black Mercedes – Benz arrived at the villa’s courtyard, Xia ruofei was shocked to see a middle – aged woman with an air of nobility getting out of the car.

However, he quickly reacted and walked forward with a smile.””You must be Mrs. Song, right? Welcome, welcome!”

Xia ruofei glared at song Rui. He did not say that he would bring his mother along.

Song Rui chuckled and said,””Mom, this is Xia ruofei, my good brother!”

Mrs. Song immediately revealed a warm smile and said,””You’re RUO Fei! I’ve heard old song mention you so many times, and he’s full of praise for you! After meeting you today, you’re indeed a man of striking appearance!”

Perhaps it was because of the Jade skin cream, Madam song was very kind to Xia ruofei. She did not put on any airs as a wife of a government official. She was even Kinder to Xia ruofei than to her son, song Rui. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Of course, Xia ruofei had always been very calm. He wasn’t overwhelmed by the favor. He just smiled and said,””Madam song, you’re too kind.”

“RUO Fei! “I’ve heard from elder song that the old man’s illness was very serious. If it wasn’t for your miraculous treatment, I’m afraid ...” Mrs. Song said,”our family is very grateful to you.”

As the two of them were talking, li Zhifu carried a basket of leaves and brought ye Lingyun into the mansion.

When song Rui saw li Zhifu, he immediately stepped forward and called out,””Hello, Grandpa li!”

When li Zhifu saw song Rui, a smile appeared on his rigid face. He said,””Xiao Rui, you’re here!”

Seeing this, Mrs. Song immediately stepped forward and said,””You must be uncle li! Hello, Hello, I’m Zhengping’s lover, you can call me little Qin. ”

Li Zhifu was slightly taken aback. He had known elder song and song Rui for quite some time, so he was more familiar with them. However, song Zhengping only knew this name, so he only reacted after a moment of shock.

“Oh!” Li Zhifu said. So you’re song’s daughter – in – Law! Hello ...”

“Uncle li, it’s not convenient for dad to come out, so he asked Xiao Rui and I to come and visit you,” Mrs. Song said enthusiastically.

“Thank you,” Li Zhifu said,”little song is very thoughtful. Please tell him not to worry about me. I’m doing well with Xiao Xia. ”

Mrs. Song nodded and gestured for song Rui to take out the nutritional supplements from the trunk. She said,””I’ll definitely pass on your words. Uncle Li, I see that you’re looking good. Is your body recovering well?”

Li Zhifu’s eyes flashed with a hint of sadness, but he quickly smiled and said,””It’s pretty good. The environment of Xiao Xia’s farm is pretty good. I’m quite comfortable living there.”

Li Zhifu had always thought that since he had a mid to late stage cancer, his life was already in a countdown stage, so he didn’t mention his body’s recovery.

Mrs. Song didn’t know that li Zhifu already knew about her condition, so she smiled and said,”Uncle li, RUO Fei’s medical skills are very good. With him by your side to treat you, you’ll definitely recover very quickly.”

Li Zhifu smiled and nodded. He didn’t continue the conversation.

Xia ruofei looked at the basket in li Zhifu’s hand and said,””Old man, you brought Ling Yun to collect leaves again?”

“Yeah!” Li Zhifu said. Ling Yun’s technique isn’t good enough, he needs more practice!”

Li Zhifu told ye Lingyun to go back to his room to practice. He knew that since there were guests, it would be inconvenient to practice in the courtyard.

After ye Lingyun returned to his room, the group went to the stone bench in the courtyard and sat down to chat.

After a while, Xia ruofei’s phone rang. He excused himself from Madam song and the others, then picked up his phone and walked out of the villa.

The call was from Lu You.

Xia ruofei estimated that Lu you should be here soon. The allure of the jaded skin cream had been proven many times over the past few days. He did not believe that Lu You would wait until tomorrow after accepting Tian Huilan ‘s’ mission ‘.

Hence, Xia ruofei was not surprised by the phone call.

“Miss Lu.” Xia ruofei answered the call with a smile.

“Xia ruofei, my mom asked me to come and get some Jade skin cream.” Lu You went straight to the point. Then, she asked,”are you at the farm now?”

“I’m at the farm, but I have a guest at home ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“What does that matter? I’ll leave after I take my things. ” Lu You said,”could it be sister Qingxue again?” Don’t worry, I won’t ruin your plans this time ...”

Xia ruofei said,”it’s not Qingxue ... But it’s fine if you come over. You should know him too. It’s song Rui. He’s the child of Xiang Nan province’s Chief Judge, Song Jin. Song Jin’s wife is also here.”

Xia ruofei originally thought that with Lu You’s personality, she wouldn’t care about having guests at home. Moreover, she had just said that she would leave after taking her things.

Unexpectedly, after Lu You heard Xia ruofei’s words, she was silent for a moment and then said,””Then I won’t go in ... You can give me the thing! I’ve already left the city and will be at the farm soon. ”
