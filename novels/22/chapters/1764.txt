Chapter 1765: A dream start (1)

When everyone heard this, they were immediately interested.

Zhao Yongjun was even more surprised. He knew that what Xu lang was going to say next would be beneficial to them, because Xu lang had already refuted Liu haofan. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

To Zhao Yong Jun’s surprise, Xu lang was giving his full support. He had invited these seniors from the field of metaphysics to the event in the hope that they would show up. It was already a form of support in itself. He did not expect these Feng Shui masters to stand up and support him.

To her surprise, Xu lang took the initiative to step forward.

Xu Lang’s status in the field of metaphysics was very high. It was already a coincidence that he could attend the groundbreaking ceremony. Even if Lu Shensi, the Vice President of the Huaxia mystical society, stood up, Zhao Yongjun would not be so surprised.

Everyone held their breath and looked at Xu lang on the stage.

Xu lang had a gentle smile on his face. He said,””First of all, I agree with Mr. Zhao’s words. You said that this land is a Yin gathering place and is only suitable for building a Yin residence. Either they don’t have any common sense about Feng Shui, or they have other motives!”

Shen Zhongliang and du Qinghong blushed when they heard Xu Lang’s words. Weren’t they the ones who came to this conclusion first?

However, the two of them also felt very wronged. It had only been ten or twenty days, but the same piece of land had two completely different Fengshui. Moreover, when they looked at it at that time, it was simply a dead end that no man could solve. Who knew that such a big change would suddenly happen?

They believed that if the situation was still the same as before, even if Xu lang were to make a move personally, he might not be able to break out of the situation.

Xu lang continued,”as a Fengshui master, the first thing we pay attention to is the aura. It’s the most intuitive feeling for a Fengshui master. The aura of this piece of land ... How should he put it! I can’t quite see through it ...”

This time, even Lu Shengsi and Hong shenyuan found it unbelievable.

Even Uncle Xu couldn’t see through it? However, according to their initial observation, although this land could not be a Yin gathering place, and the overall Feng Shui was quite good, at least they could gather wealth here. But other than that, there was nothing they couldn’t see through!

Lu Shengsi was not stupid enough to think that it was because of Xu Lang’s poor standard. He knew that there was only one possibility, and that was that the Feng Shui of this piece of land was very special. There was something mysterious about it that he and Hong shenyuan had not noticed.

Thus, Lu Shengsi and Hong shenyuan couldn’t help but perked up their ears.

Xu lang continued,”at first glance, the Feng Shui pattern of this land is very obvious. The mountains and rivers are surrounded, and the Jade belt is wrapped around the waist. It’s undoubtedly a place with good feng shui, but there’s nothing special about it.”

Lu Shengsi and Hong shenyuan couldn’t help but secretly nod in agreement. This was the conclusion they had come to after a rough look.

When Xu lang said this, he changed the topic and said,””But the aura of this land is quite special. Even in a chaotic environment with many people and cars, I can still feel that the aura is very stable, and there is a faint vitality gathering. This is obviously the effect that the Feng Shui pattern I mentioned above can’t achieve ...”

When Lu Shengsi and Hong shenyuan heard this, they simultaneously calmed down and felt it. They instantly revealed surprised expressions. They were convinced that Xu lang was right.

While they were secretly amazed, they were also full of admiration for Xu lang.

This Hong Kong Fengshui master truly lived up to his reputation. Even a Fengshui master like Lu Shengsi had overlooked this detail, but he had keenly grasped it.

Lu Shensi also sighed inwardly. Due to some practical reasons, the Feng Shui industry in Hong Kong was far more prosperous than that of the mainland. Although the number of Feng Shui masters in Hong Kong could not be compared to that of the mainland, their level was admirable.

Xia ruofei had been listening attentively. When Xu lang talked about aura, he was surprised.

It was obvious that Xu Lang’s judgment was quite accurate. The aura and vitality that Xu lang mentioned were naturally the effects of the nine rotations heaven and earth formation’s yang formation. That was why Xu lang was so confused.

It was already very impressive for Xu lang to be able to make such a judgment.

Strictly speaking, the nine rotations heaven and earth formation was not in the category of Fengshui. Unless Xu lang was also a cultivator, he would not be able to see through it.

Xu lang said from the stage,”therefore, I’m guessing that the Feng Shui of this land must be very special. It’s a pity that I’m not skilled enough and my level is limited, so I couldn’t see it.” However, there is one thing that is beyond doubt, and that is that this piece of land is a treasure land with excellent Fengshui!”

Xu lang paused for a moment before he explained,”Some of you may have doubts about the aura problem that I mentioned and think that it’s illusory, so I’ll explain it to you in layman terms ... Although the aura can’t be seen with the naked eye, it’s everywhere. The aura of a place will affect the people there to a great extent.”

“Everyone, feel it. After you entered this land, did you feel happy? And their mentality will unconsciously become a lot calmer?” Xu lang asked with a smile.

This was very common. The guests and reporters in the audience thought about it carefully and realized that it was really as Xu lang had said.

Especially some news reporters, who were usually under a lot of work pressure and were in a state of anxiety for a long time.
