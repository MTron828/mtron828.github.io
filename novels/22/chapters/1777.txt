Chapter 1778: A hundred turns and a thousand turns (1)

Seeing Song Wei like this, Xia ruofei could not help but feel helpless. Especially when he saw the tears in Song Wei’s eyes, Xia ruofei did not know what to do.

After a long silence, Xia ruofei patiently persuaded,””Song Wei, I’m not joking. I’m just giving you advice as a friend. I’m not trying to change your mind. It’s too risky ...”

Tears rolled down Song Wei’s delicate cheeks. She felt wronged and wanted to give Xia ruofei a hard time. However, when she saw Xia ruofei’s dazed look, she could not bring herself to do it.

Xia ruofei struck while the iron was hot and said,”Song Wei, you see ... You’re a little emotional today. It’s even more inappropriate for you to take such a dangerous risk. It’s not a joke to get rid of the poison in your sea of consciousness. With your current condition, I think the success rate won’t even exceed 50%...”

Song Wei wiped her tears, raised her head and said,”I know. I’ll go back first today!”

Xia ruofei was overjoyed and quickly said,””That’s the way!”

Song Wei glared at Xia ruofei with her red eyes and said,”I haven’t finished yet! I do need to calm down. You have other things to do tonight, so ... I’ve decided to come and find you tomorrow!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be dumbfounded. Why was this lady so determined to remove the miasma when she wasn’t prepared? what exactly happened?

Xia ruofei did not pursue the matter further as he knew that it would be a waste of time. If Song Wei wanted to say something, she would have done so long ago. Why would she wait until now?

Although Song Wei looked weak, she was actually a very independent girl. No one could force her to say it if she didn’t want to.

Xia ruofei thought about it. It was good to let Song Wei go back first. At least she could calm down. Who knew if she would change her mind after she calmed down?

Although he knew that the possibility was very low, it was better than taking the risk now, wasn’t it?

Hence, Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and said,””Alright, I’ll send you off first ...”

Xia ruofei stopped in the middle of his sentence as he remembered that Wu Qiang had driven the car out.

“You don’t have to send me, I’ll take a taxi back!” Song Wei said.

Then, she walked out. Xia ruofei quickly put away the time formation flag and followed her.

At the entrance of the courtyard house, Song Wei stopped and turned around,””Ruofei, don’t send me off. I’ll just take a taxi at the entrance of the alley!”

Xia ruofei smiled,”I’ll send you out!” It’s getting late, and this alley is quite dark. What if there’s any danger?”

In fact, Song Wei was already a Qi disciple Level 3 cultivator. Although she had not learned any combat spells, just based on her physical strength, a few ordinary burly men would not be her opponent. What danger would there be?

Xia ruofei was still worried about Song Wei’s mental state.

Song Wei opened her mouth but did not reject Xia ruofei’s good intentions. She nodded silently.

The two of them walked out of liuhai Lane side by side, and neither of them spoke along the way.

On the road outside, Song Wei was wearing a down jacket and standing under the pedestrian tree. Xia ruofei was waving at her to stop a car.

It was busier to go out during the evening peak hour, and a few of the cars that passed by were all occupied.

Song Wei saw Xia ruofei standing by the roadside and waving at her. Her heart was in turmoil. The more Xia ruofei cared about her, the more conflicted she felt.

More than a dozen cars passed by, and after waiting for about seven to eight minutes, an empty car finally stopped at the side. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei quickly opened the back door of the car and motioned for Song Wei to get in. After Song Wei got in, Xia ruofei closed the car door and stuck his hand in through the window.”Song Wei, be careful on the road. I’ve already noted down the car plate number. Remember to send me a WeChat message when you reach school.”

Seeing Xia ruofei’s distrusting attitude in front of him, his brother rolled his eyes.

“I know, you can go back now!” Song Wei nodded and said.

Xia ruofei then straightened up and said to his brother,””Sir, please drive slowly to Capital University and be careful!”

“Don’t worry, brother!”The taxi driver replied lazily.

The car started moving slowly and Xia ruofei waved at Song Wei. He only turned around and walked back to liuhai Lane after the car had merged into the busy traffic.

In the car, Song Wei sat in the back seat. The streetlights that flashed past her face flickered.

The eloquence of the Beijing brothers was well – known throughout the country, and this man was obviously a typical Beijing man.

His mouth didn’t stop moving as he drove.”Young lady, that was your boyfriend, right? He’s really concerned about you!”

Song Wei was stunned. She shook her head and said,”No, we’re just ordinary friends.”

The taxi driver laughed and said,”I don’t think so.” Even if we’re just ordinary friends, I think we’ll have endless possibilities in the future! This bro’s eyes are very accurate! You and that young man just now look like a perfect match, and his concern for you is definitely from the bottom of his heart ...”

“I’m sorry, master!”Song Wei’s brows furrowed. I’m a little tired and want to rest for a while. Please call me when we reach the place ...”

After she finished speaking, she leaned back in the back seat and closed her eyes to rest.

Having lost someone to chat with, the taxi driver could only stop talking. The car became much quieter, and only the radio was playing the famous Beijing Opera song “spring and autumn pairing” on an unknown channel.
