2433 Linglong tower (2)

Xia ruofei’s heart could not help but beat rapidly. It had been a long time since there were any changes to the Archean realm. The Linglong Pagoda that suddenly appeared this time definitely did not appear for no reason. It must have a very important function!

Although he really wanted to find out what was going on, Xia ruofei did not rush over. Instead, he sent a telepathic message to Xia Qing, asking him to come over immediately.

After Xia Qing received Xia ruofei’s orders, she immediately flashed and arrived at the Archean realm.

When Xia Qing saw the Linglong tower in the middle of the pool, she revealed a smile and said,””Congratulations, master! The Linglong tower has evolved in the spirit map world, which will be a great help to master!”

Xia ruofei’s face was filled with joy as he asked,”Xia Qing, give me a good introduction to this Linglong Pagoda!” It’s located at the center of the Archean realm, and it’s obvious that it’s not an ordinary item. I’m filled with anticipation!”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing said,”actually ... The appearance of the Linglong Pagoda is a dividing line for the spirit map world ...”

“Oh?” Hearing this, Xia ruofei’s interest was piqued. He quickly asked,”why do you say so?”

“Master, although the spiritual Qi in the spirit map world was very rich, did you feel that it was lacking in some spiritual movement?” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”and you must remember that I reminded you not to cultivate in the spirit map world for a long time to avoid damaging the foundation of the spirit map world, right?” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Of course I remember!” Xia ruofei nodded.

Xia Qing smiled and said,”the reason why there is such a restriction is that the spirit map world has not evolved enough. In the past, although the spirit Qi in the spirit map world was getting richer and richer, it was actually consuming the foundation of the spirit map world itself.” Fortunately, master didn’t plant too many spirit grasses and spirit medicines. The crops and medicines of the secular world don’t consume too much of the spirit map world. ”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows and ask,””So ... After the space evolved, this situation has changed?”

“Yes, I am!” Xia Qing pointed to the Linglong Pagoda in the center of the spirit pool and said,”the Linglong Pagoda is actually the center of the array of the entire spirit map world. The appearance of the Linglong Pagoda means that the spirit map world’s formation has been further activated. ”

“There’s an array in the spirit map world?”Xia ruofei asked curiously.

Xia Qing smiled and said,”of course. The entire spirit map world is shrouded in a large array. This array contains an extremely complex time and space Array. This array is gradually activated, so the space of the spirit map world will continue to expand.”

Xia ruofei nodded.”I understand now ... So, the appearance of the Linglong tower means that a part of the key formation has been activated?”

“Yes!” Xia Qing nodded. Master, the appearance of the Linglong Pagoda means that a key function of the spirit map world has begun to resume operation. ”

“What function?” Xia ruofei asked.

He had a faint feeling that the “key function” that Xia Qing had mentioned should be related to spirit Qi.

“Master, this part of the function of the formation, simply put, is that the spirit map world has restored its energy exchange with the outside world. Now, the spirit map world can absorb energy from the outside world and transform it into spiritual Qi.” Xia Qing said.

“The outside world?” Xia ruofei subconsciously frowned and said,”but the cultivation environment outside is already very poor. The spiritual Qi is very thin.”

“Master, the outside world I’m talking about isn’t the outer space you live in, but the chaotic region outside the spirit map world,” Xia Qing said with a smile.

Xia Qing paused and continued,”the chaotic region is full of chaotic Qi. This is the most original Qi. However, in most cases, the chaotic Qi can not be directly absorbed and utilized.” This part of the formation that was activated in the spirit map world could continue to absorb the chaotic Qi in the chaotic region and transform it into spirit Qi to maintain the concentration of spirit Qi in the space. This means ...”

Xia ruofei’s eyes brightened as he continued Xia Qing’s words,””This means that I can cultivate in the spirit map world from now on!”

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile.”Yes. At least with master’s current cultivation, the speed at which the spirit map world’s formation converts and absorbs the chaos Qi is sufficient. Master should be able to replenish the spiritual Qi in time if you cultivate in the space.”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile bitterly. Was he being looked down upon because of his low cultivation level?

No matter what, being able to cultivate directly in the spirit map space was definitely a great thing for Xia ruofei.

Although he could use spirit crystals or origin crystals to cultivate in the outside world, he would try to save such precious cultivation resources as much as possible. After all, for the sake of safety, he couldn’t bring Song Wei, Ling Qingxue, Li Yifu, Tang Haoran, and the others into the medium to cultivate in the short term. It was naturally the best choice to leave spirit crystals and origin crystals for them to use.

Secondly, with the density of the spiritual Qi in the space, if Xia ruofei cultivated directly in the spirit map space, the effect would be better than cultivating with crystals.

As for the third point, he could naturally use the 30 times faster time flow at the Archean realm to rapidly increase his cultivation level.

After learning about the situation in the cultivation world, Xia ruofei felt a sense of urgency and realized that time was precious.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,””Xia Qing, the upgrade of the realm this time is really timely!”

“Master has done very well,” Xia Qing nodded with a smile,”the spirit map world’s evolution has always been very fast. That’s right, the appearance of the Linglong Pagoda not only marks the activation of the spiritual energy conversion formation in the spirit map world, but it also has infinite wondrous uses. As for the specific functions, I’ll leave it to master to discover them yourself!”

Xia ruofei laughed,”you’re still keeping me in suspense!”

Xia ruofei didn’t mind. Since Xia Qing didn’t say anything, he naturally wouldn’t force her. Moreover, although Xia Qing didn’t clearly tell him about the tower of delicacy’s function, since he was asked to discover it himself, it at least meant that the tower of delicacy was safe for him, and it was unlikely that any dangerous accidents would happen.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”good!” Then I’ll try out the magical effects of this Linglong Pagoda!”

With that, Xia ruofei lifted his legs and walked towards the Jade Bridge in his direction. Xia Qing, on the other hand, stood on the shore and watched with a smile.

Xia ruofei reached the Jade Bridge in a few steps. He took a deep breath and stepped on it.

Nothing strange happened. The Jade Bridge was still connected to the exquisite Jade Pagoda in the center of the pool.

The Jade Bridge was in the shape of an arch bridge. Xia ruofei had to go up nine steps, walk forward, and go down another nine steps to reach the Linglong tower.

Xia ruofei did not stop and continued to walk up the stairs.

However, he soon realized that something was wrong. With every step Xia ruofei took, he felt that the Jade Bridge seemed to widen.

Originally, this Jade Bridge could only accommodate one adult. If two people were to walk opposite each other, they would have to walk sideways to cross.

After Xia ruofei had taken three or four steps, the Jade Bridge had grown to more than two meters wide. It was enough to accommodate three or four people walking side by side.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but click his tongue in wonder. He continued to walk up the stairs.

After he had finished the ninth step, the width of the Jade Bridge had reached about six meters.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but look back. He suddenly realized that the Kasaya didn’t seem to have become wider because of the Jade Bridge. It was because he had become smaller.

He saw that the shore of the pool was at least a dozen meters away from him, but in fact, he felt that he had only moved forward two or three meters. In addition, he saw Xia Qing standing on the shore. At this moment, she was like a giant in his eyes. Everything, including the grass by the pond and the Da Hong Pao tea trees in the distance, had been magnified several times in his eyes.

Xia ruofei quickly came back to his senses. Perhaps it was not that the Jade Bridge had widened or that he had become smaller, but that the space had changed.

The space within the painting was so large that it was not surprising that the Jade Pagoda and Jade Bridge within the space had been integrated with the laws of space.

Therefore, the Jade Pagoda, which looked like it was only one meter tall from the shore, might actually be much higher.

Xia ruofei could not help but admire the owner of the spirit map space, master Shanhai. At the same time, he could not help but think,”Was this painting really created by venerable Shanhai?
