Chapter 1039: Chapter 662 – surprise and joy (2)

Translator: 549690339

Feng Rao could not help but glance at Xue Jinshan and asked,””Jin Shan, what are you and the chairman up to? You pulled me here for no reason ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Mr. Feng, please calm down!” You’ll know in a while ...”

After that, Xia ruofei beckoned for everyone to enter the workshop.

The production line for the trial production of the jaded skin cream was ready. The medicinal herbs were prepared in advance, and the workers were in position.

Xue Jinshan cast a questioning look at Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei nodded slightly, so Xue Jinshan said in a clear voice,”Begin!”

A worker in the central control room pressed a button, and the workers on the production line immediately added the first batch of medicinal materials into the feed port. The entire production line began to run.

Feng Rao was a little confused and couldn’t help but ask,””Chairman, you specifically called me over just to watch them produce the heart – nourishing soup?”

In fact, the process of producing Yangxin soup and jaded skin ointment was quite different. However, Feng Jing didn’t know much about the production process of pharmaceutical factories. After all, Yingying wasn’t in the technical field. So far, she hadn’t thought about jaded skin ointment at all. She had completely assumed that they were producing Yangxin soup because these two production lines produced Yangxin soup every day.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”chief Feng, don’t be so anxious!” Since you’re already here, why don’t you take a look at the workers ‘operations and check the workshop environment? you’re the company’s general manager, so you should come and inspect more often!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Feng Jing didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. She still had to pack her luggage in the morning! Moreover, she still had a lot of ideas about the preparation of the auction. She wanted to sort them out before she set off so that she could contact Dong Jiajun as soon as she arrived in Hong Kong. How could she have the time to “inspect” the pharmaceutical factory now?

What was wrong with the chairman today? Feng Rao couldn’t help but Mutter in her heart.

However, Xia ruofei was her superior, and Xia ruofei was right. The pharmaceutical factory was under the company. As the General Manager, she had to pay attention to it. Since she was already here, she couldn’t show her impatience. Otherwise, Xue Jinshan and the others would think that she didn’t value the work in the pharmaceutical factory!

This was very demoralizing!

Hence, Feng Jing could only look at Xia ruofei helplessly and nod.””I understand, Chairman ...”

Xia ruofei laughed in his heart, but he did not point it out. He just stood in the workshop and watched with a smile.

Sometimes, Xia ruofei would even go to the workers and look at the instruments and screens on the panel. It was like a leader doing an inspection. He could not understand it, but he had to pretend to be interested.

Feng Rao followed behind Xia ruofei, confused.

The production line was running in an orderly manner. The production process had been repeated dozens of times in the past seven days, and the workers had long been familiar with this process. The stability of the production line had been adjusted to a high level, so no one had any psychological pressure.

In the midst of the dull rumbles, time passed by.

The workers there were fully focused on their own duties, and all kinds of indicator lights lit up from time to time. Some parts that required manual operation were also accurately completed by the workers under the guidance of the indicator lights.

About an hour later, the last large bag of raw materials that had been ground into powder was put into another feeding port. The production of jaded skin ointment had entered the final stage.

This big bag of powder – like medicinal materials was a mixture of several medicinal materials, including the green maple vine, after grinding.

In the future, after production, Xia ruofei would give the green maple vine powder to the pharmaceutical factory and the pharmaceutical factory would mix it in according to the ratio.

After a while, the indicator light at the discharge port of the production line turned green.

After another two minutes, a stainless steel container was transported out.

Xia ruofei laughed and said to Feng Rao,””President Feng, let’s go! Let’s go and take a look!”

Feng Jing followed Xia ruofei to the stainless steel container.

When she was about six meters away, Feng Rao suddenly stopped. She sniffed hard, and her beautiful eyes gradually widened.

Because she had already smelled a familiar fragrance.

Seeing that Feng Jing had stopped, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but stop. He turned around and smiled.””Boss Feng, come here!”

Feng Rao’s face gradually became excited as she muttered,”Jadeshi ointment ... Jadeshi ointment ... It must be jadeshi ointment!”

After she finished speaking, she dashed past Xia ruofei and pounced on the stainless steel container.

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, but then a smile slowly appeared on his face. He quickened his pace and walked over.

Feng Rao came to the stainless steel container. The unique fragrance of the jaded skin ointment became stronger. She became even more excited when she saw the brown ointment – like substance inside.

She didn’t even care that the jaded skin ointment was still a little hot. She directly reached out and touched a little, put it to her nose, and took a few deep breaths. Then, she carefully applied it on the back of her hand.

The jaded skin ointment was applied evenly, and a familiar cool feeling came from the back of her hand. Soon, the small amount of jaded skin ointment was absorbed by her skin.

Feng Rao took out a tissue and wiped away the layer of jaded skin cream on the back of her hand. She then reached out and gently stroked the back of her hand. The smooth feeling was very familiar to her. Every time after Yingluo used the jaded skin cream, her face would feel the same.

Feng Rao suddenly turned around and looked at Xia ruofei.””Chairman, has the jaded skin cream been mass – produced?”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

“What’s the quality of the product? Is it any different from the artificial jaded skin cream?” Feng Rao asked.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”After almost a week of testing, the quality of the products has stabilized. Basically, it can reach the upper – Middle grade. There’s no problem selling it in bulk.”

The biggest difference between manual brewing and mass production was the stability.

If the Jade skin cream was brewed manually, perhaps the control of the fire was a little more accurate, or the state of the brewing was a little better, then the quality of the final Jade skin cream would be very high. If it was the opposite, it would be a little worse.

As long as the parameters were in place, the quality of each batch of products would be stable.

Feng Rao was stunned for a moment, then she let out a scream of surprise. She couldn’t help but rush forward and hug Xia ruofei. She excitedly said to Xia ruofei,””Chairman, you’re too awesome! That’s too awesome!”

Xia ruofei was shocked by Feng Jing’s reaction. He did not expect her to be so agitated. He did not know how to react.

Xue Jinshan and the others couldn’t help but widen their eyes. Then, they revealed a meaningful smile.

“Boss Feng, calm down ... Calm down ...” Xia ruofei quickly whispered.”Jinshan and the others are right there!”

Feng Rao realized that she had lost her composure. She quickly let go of Xia ruofei and her face flushed.

Feng Rao was a little embarrassed as she glared at Xia ruofei and said,””Chairman, why did you deliberately hide the mass production experiment from me?”

“I just wanted to give you a surprise!” Xia ruofei shrugged.

“Surprise? “It’s more like a shock ...” Feng Jing couldn’t help but whine,”the company’s most important phenomenal product is being developed, and I, the General Manager, have no idea about it. Chairman, you’re too much ...”

Xia ruofei laughed dryly,”hehe ... Weren’t you busy with the auction these few days?” Besides ... I didn’t expect the mass production experiment to go so smoothly. I thought it would take at least ten days to half a month!”

Although Feng Rao was a little embarrassed, her strong woman nature made her quickly immerse herself in excitement.

“Chairman,” she said impatiently,”once the jaded skin cream is launched, it will definitely be a domineering product in the skincare industry. I suggest that we immediately gather the company’s key leaders for a meeting and fully deploy the production, sales, and publicity of this heavyweight product!”

Xia ruofei laughed.”There’s no hurry. President Feng, let’s go to the lounge and sit down. I’ll tell you the results of the experiments over the past few days!”
