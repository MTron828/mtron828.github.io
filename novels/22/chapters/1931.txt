Chapter 1932 Prostrating on the ground (1)

“This ...” Xu Yougang hesitated for a long time, then raised his head and said,”then I’ll thank you on behalf of my brothers, brother Xia!”

Xia ruofei finally showed a satisfied smile and said,””That’s the way! Old Xu, take your brothers to Sanya to relax. Don’t worry about the money, and adjust your body and mind to the best state. I’m still waiting for you to come back and help me with my work!”

“Yes!” Xu Yougang said,”brother Xia, we’ll give you our lives! In the future, if you have any instructions, we’ll definitely go wherever you point us to!”

Xu Yougang knew very well that Xia ruofei gave them so much money to shut them up. After all, if this matter were to be disclosed, it would be a big deal.

Of course, this didn’t prevent Xu Yougang from being grateful to Xia ruofei. The four brothers were really at their wits ‘end. Their families were extremely short of money in various situations. Xia ruofei’s money could be said to be a timely help.

Xu Yougang, Zeng Liang, and the others were ready to die for Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’m not a Bandit who takes over a mountain. I don’t need you to help me conquer the world.” It’s just that in the future, as the company grows bigger and bigger, it’ll be inconvenient for me to show my face in some matters. When the time comes, I’ll need you to show your skills!”

Xu Yougang understood tacitly and nodded.””Brother Xia, don’t worry!”

Then, Xu Yougang hesitated and said,””By the way, brother Xia, before I left, I saw that the official Weibo of Haixi satellite TV had deleted that post. I’m afraid Liu haojun has already started to use his own connections to remedy the situation ...”

“Liu haojun may be a bastard, but he’s not an idiot.” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”this is within my expectations ...”

Xu Yougang said anxiously,”then we have to think of a way to deal with it!” “I took a look. Although that Weibo post is quite popular, with hundreds of reposts and comments, once the original Weibo post was deleted, those reposts on Weibo can’t see the specific news video anymore. It’s equivalent to cutting off the source! And needless to say, when the evening news rebroadcast, that news will definitely be removed ...”

“So?” Xia ruofei shrugged and asked.

Xu Yougang gritted his teeth and said,”brother Xia, we still have a lot of Liu haojun’s videos. They are not censored like the news videos. Why don’t we ...”

Without waiting for Xu You to finish, Xia ruofei immediately said,””No, we can’t use those videos unless we have to! Once we use it, we can’t guarantee that it won’t leave behind any traces. If the Liu family really finds out, it’ll be evidence that we plotted against Liu haojun!”

Xia ruofei emphasized,””You’re not allowed to use the videos you’ve taken these days without permission, and you’re not allowed to leave any backups. Before we set off tomorrow, give me the laptop that stores the videos! Do you understand?”

“I see, brother Xia ...” Xu Yougang nodded and said,”but we have to think of something, right? Otherwise, wouldn’t our efforts these past few days have been in vain?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,””Don’t worry! You’ve done your job well, and I’ll take care of the rest. It’s impossible for Liu haojun to get away so easily. This time, even if he doesn’t die, he’ll be skinned alive!”

Xu Yougang’s eyes lit up.”Brother Xia, you’ve already thought of a solution?”

After this incident, Xu Yougang had a blind admiration for Xia ruofei. The image of Xia ruofei’s flawless plan had been established in his heart. Subconsciously, he felt that no problem could stump Xia ruofei. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Xu Yougang was deeply involved in this matter, so Xia ruofei did not plan to hide anything from him. He smiled and opened the laptop he brought on the table, waving at Xu Yougang.

Xu Yougang immediately stood up and went behind Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei showed him a page on the computer screen.

Xu Yougang took a look and was surprised. He said to himself,””So many posts!”

“This is just one of the forums ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Then, he opened a few pages that had been opened for a long time and refreshed them to show Xu Yougang.

Tianya, Mao po, Weibo, today’s headline, TikTok ... Almost all of the largest forums, news convergence platforms, and Short Video platforms in the country were covered.

In just half an hour, many posts about this news suddenly appeared on these platforms. The video in the post was extracted from the Weibo post posted by Haixi satellite TV on the Weibo platform.

When Xu Yougang saw the content of these posts, he could not help but widen his eyes. These posts were not just reposts of censored videos. The post clearly pointed out that the person lying on the ground like a dead dog was the Deputy Secretary of Changping County, Liu haojun, and the person trembling and squatting next to him was the married woman, the head female anchor of Sanshan TV station, Fang Chenchen.

Liu haojun could be considered a leader, and Fang Chenchen appeared on camera a lot. There were also many photos of the two of them on the internet in the posts, and they were compared to the people in the videos. After all, the news video only covered their faces with a thin layer of mosaic, and many of their physical features were not covered.

Even the cell phone, watch, and clothes scattered on the coffee table in the video were circled in red. Photos of Liu haojun and Fang Chenchen at other events were found, and the corresponding items were also circled.
