Chapter 188: Chapter 184 – one buy one sell

Xia ruofei thought for a while and decided not to go to Lingyu house. In the past few months, he had bought too many jades from spirit Jade house. It was fine if he didn’t buy a lot in the early stages, but now, the Jades he needed to upgrade the spirit map space were easily in the tens of millions, or even tens of millions. Spirit Jade house might not be able to provide them. In addition, he had been buying a lot of Jade, which was quite abnormal in itself. It was easy to arouse suspicion after a long time. Xia ruofei was thinking as he drove. He suddenly remembered that MA Xiong had started his business by selling jewelry and jades. He was still known as the king of jewelry. Jewelry and jades were still an important business of Hengfeng group. The difference between spirit Jade house and Hengfeng group was like the difference between a small beetle and a giant mammoth. The two were not on the same level at all. The Jade that Xia ruofei needed might be a big deal to spirit Jade house. They might need to transfer goods everywhere to meet Xia ruofei’s needs, but to Hengfeng group, it was insignificant. Thinking of this, Xia ruofei took out his Bluetooth headset and put it on. He dialed Ma Zhiming’s phone while driving. “Nice to meet you, Xia Sheng!” Ma Zhiming was very enthusiastic. “Mr. MA, you were in a hurry to return to Hong Kong two days ago. How did things go?” Xia ruofei asked. “Oh, everything is going well. It’s already been settled.” Ma Zhiming smiled gently and said,”thank you for your concern, Xia Sheng.” “That’s good, that’s good,” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Mr. MA, I’m looking for you today because I need your help with something.” “Xia Sheng, please speak. No matter what happens, we will do our best!” Ma Zhiming said without any hesitation. “It’s like this. A friend of mine has recently started a Jade and jewelry business, but he doesn’t have any channels for raw materials, so he would like to ask you for help.” Xia ruofei said,”the main thing is that the quality of the Jade has to be of the ice glutinous type.” This was the excuse that Xia ruofei had thought of in advance. Of course, it was also out of careful consideration. “That’s not a problem,” Ma Zhiming agreed without even thinking.”Our Hengfeng jewelry has been in the jewelry and jade industry for decades. We have a rich supply of raw materials.” Hengfeng group couldn’t guarantee that they would have the king’s Green, which was a rare top – grade Jade. But if it was the icy glutinous type, it was no problem. “Then I’ll thank you on behalf of my friend!” Xia ruofei said,”Mr. MA, the price will be according to the market price, including the transportation and storage costs. In addition, you will also have to include the profits that you deserve.” Ma Zhiming smiled and said,”xiasheng, since it’s your friend’s business, how are we going to earn his money?” We’ll just give him the cost price. ” Xia ruofei said,”Mr. MA, I’m already very grateful for your help. Let’s set the price according to the market price!” My friend hopes that we will mainly purchase Jade from your company in the future. This is a long – term cooperation, how can we not make a profit?” “This ...” “Mr. MA, it’s decided!” Xia ruofei said,”otherwise, I wouldn’t dare to ask for your help!” “Alright then!” Ma Zhiming said helplessly,”xiasheng, we’ll do as you say!” “MMH! Mr. MA, if it’s convenient, we hope that we can get the supply as soon as possible. ” Xia ruofei said,”I need Jade that is worth about 10 million Chinese dollars. Do you have any problems with that?” “Yes, I can.” Ma Zhiming said casually,”the branch in the southeast province should have enough Jade. If they don’t have enough, I can transfer the goods directly from Hong Kong. The latest by tomorrow will be ready.” If Xia ruofei were to look for boss Chen of the spirit Jade house, he would be shocked. Even if he tried his best to coordinate, it would take more than two to three days to gather ten million worth of Jade. After Ma Zhiming heard it, he didn’t have any emotional fluctuations at all, as if it was no different from a thousand Yuan business. This was the foundation of a super Financial Group. “Thank you so much! Mr. MA, just get someone to contact me directly after the goods are ready. ” Xia ruofei said happily,”if I need your help in the future, I’ll still have to trouble you!” “It’s just a small matter! Xia Sheng, you don’t have to be so polite! If you need anything, just look for me. ” Ma Zhiming chuckled and said,”by the way, xiasheng, my daddy is also here. He has something to tell you.” Soon, MA Xiong’s hearty laughter was heard from the phone.”Happy New Year, Xia Sheng!” “Happy New Year, Happy New Year!” Xia ruofei asked,”what is old Mr. Ma’s order?” “I’m not worthy of your orders!”MA Xiong laughed. Xia Sheng, I just want to ask if you still have any of the truffle that was auctioned in Shen Cheng a few days ago?” Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”there should be the last batch of goods for this year in the near future. However, I’m afraid that it won’t be easy to find the highest quality items that weigh more than 500 grams like the ones at the auction.” “It doesn’t matter if it’s light. I’m more interested in the quality of the truffle.” MA Xiong said,”the quality of your truffles is extremely high. The Western restaurants under Hengfeng are in great need of them. Xia Sheng, how about selling all of this truffles to our Hengfeng?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”no problem!” It doesn’t matter who I sell it to. I’m more than happy that old Mr. MA takes care of our business!” “Thank you, Xia Sheng!” MA Xiong said happily,”xiasheng, when can we make the deal?” “In two days!” Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said,”old Mr. MA, there shouldn’t be too many truffles left. After all, it’s the end of the season!” “We’ll take as many as you have!” MA Xiong said,”as for the price ... 5000 dollars per kilogram of white truffle and 900 dollars per kilogram of black truffle. If it’s over 400 grams, we’ll refer to the prices from the auctions this year. We’ll settle the bill separately. What do you think, xiasheng?” “No problem, we’ll do as you say!” Xia ruofei said without hesitation. This year was a high – yield year for truffles, and the International market price had dropped slightly compared to last year. MA Xiong’s purchase price was much higher than last year’s price, and he was definitely sincere. “Then it’s a deal!” MA Xiong said happily,”I’ll send someone to your farm to pick up the goods the day after tomorrow!” “It’s a deal!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “By the way, Xia Sheng, I’ve just dealt with some small problems regarding Blake the other day, and I’m about to contact a few friends who were there that day to put pressure on Blake’s catering group and make Blake apologize publicly.” MA Xiong said,”xiasheng, I’ll let you know if there’s any news. Anyway, you don’t have to worry about this.” “Alright! I’ve troubled you!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. As Xia ruofei was still driving, he did not talk much after they were done. He hung up the phone after informing MA Xiong. It seemed that he had to go back and tidy up the remaining truffles today. Xia ruofei said in his heart. Although the remaining truffles were generally smaller than the truffles in the last auction, there was a lot of them. If he sold all of them to the Hengfeng group, he should be able to make a good profit.
