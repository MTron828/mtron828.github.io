Xia ruofei jogged down to the courtyard of the villa. Ling Qingxue was still leaning on the Porsche. Under the afternoon sun, her face had a lazy expression, which made her look very charming. When Xia ruofei saw her, he could not help but think of that sweet kiss from the other day. He greeted Ling Qingxue awkwardly,””Qingxue, long time no see ...” Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei with a half – Smile and asked,””Are you not going to contact me if I don’t come to your house?” Xia ruofei laughed drily and scratched his head.””Isn’t this that day’s ...” “Don’t mention what happened that day!” Ling Qingxue’s face turned red as she interrupted Xia ruofei. “Okay, I won’t mention it ...” Xia ruofei said.”Qingxue, you ... Are you looking for me?” Ling Qingxue pursed her lips and said,”my father received news from President Zheng that your company has been registered. Also, today, when our purchaser went back and reported that you are carrying out a large – scale construction project here, comrade Ling couldn’t sit still. Didn’t he send me here to use my beauty to seduce you?” So that you can sign the official contract with us as soon as possible. ” At the mention of the “honey trap,” Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but burst out laughing. This laugh broke the awkward atmosphere between the two of them. Xia ruofei also felt relieved and quickly said,””Of course, there’s no problem with signing the contract. Even if you didn’t come and look for me, I was prepared to go to your company to settle this matter in the next two days.” Then, Xia ruofei said,”why don’t we do it today?” Are we going back to the city now?” Ling Qingxue chuckled and said,”there’s no need to be in such a hurry, right?” It’s almost mealtime. Don’t you understand that I’m here at this time?” Ling Qingxue paused for a moment, then said slowly,””I remember someone still owes me two meals!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”that’s even more of a problem!” I’m also preparing to cook! Let’s go in and sit!” Ling Qingxue cheered and went up to hold Xia ruofei’s arm. She stuck close to him and the two of them walked into the villa together. Xia ruofei did not greet Ling Qingxue and just let her watch TV in the living room. He went to the kitchen to prepare lunch. The ingredients were naturally the vegetables from the spirit map space, and it would be fine to pair it with one or two meat dishes. Xia ruofei had been cooking for himself these days, so he was more skilled. When he was preparing the meat dishes, Xia ruofei suddenly thought of the grass carp in the fish pond in the interspace. The grass carp there were basically about half a catty, so it was very good to get two of them to braise or steam. However, the problem was that Ling Qingxue was in the living room outside. Xia ruofei definitely could not enter the spirit map space to fish. At this moment, Xia ruofei had an idea. Ever since the space evolved, he could directly take out items from the space through telepathy. In theory, he could also take out the grass fish directly. However, he had only taken ordinary items in the past, and the grass carp was constantly swimming in the spatial fish pond, so it might be very difficult to actually do it. However, Xia ruofei still wanted to give it a try. Not only was it to add a dish for lunch, but he also wanted to test his own idea. Xia ruofei looked around and saw that Ling Qingxue was focused on a variety show. Her long legs were placed on the coffee table, so she would not suddenly come to the kitchen. With a thought, the spirit painting appeared in Xia ruofei’s hand. He held the spirit map scroll in his hand and began to connect with the spirit map space. Every blade of grass and every tree in the space was clearly reflected in his mind. In the past, when he took something out, he only needed to lock his mind on the item he wanted to take, and then give an order, and the item would be taken out of the space. Hence, Xia ruofei focused all his attention on the fish pond in the space. He quietly looked at a grass carp in the fish pond and was highly focused. However, the moment he gave the order, the grass carp wagged its tail and swam forward. It burrowed into a Bush of seaweed and Xia ruofei missed. However, Xia ruofei was not discouraged. Instead, he persevered and tried again. This was indeed much harder than taking things out normally. Xia ruofei tried three times in a row, but none of them succeeded. On the fourth attempt, Xia ruofei finally found the right time. He locked his mind on a grass carp and gave the order. The next moment, a grass carp appeared out of thin air and landed on the sink. The grass carp was obviously confused about the situation. It didn’t understand why it was swimming freely in the fish pond a moment ago, but the next moment, its environment had suddenly changed. Therefore, it was very flustered and flapped its tail in the sink, making a banging sound. Xia ruofei quickly kept the spirit map space into his body and then threw the grass carp onto the anvil. He patted it flat with the knife and the grass carp immediately became dizzy and obediently lay on the anvil. Xia ruofei went to the kitchen door and sneaked a look. Seeing that Ling Qingxue did not come over because of the commotion in the kitchen, he took out the spirit map space again and tried the same thing twice. Once again, he successfully took out a grass carp from the space fish pond. Xia ruofei was very satisfied. It was obvious that he had a closer connection with the spirit map space during this period of time. He was also more familiar with the use of the spirit map space. He deftly processed the two fish, and in a short while, two fragrant braised grass carp were out of the pot. The Golden braised fish was sprinkled with tender green coriander, and a fragrance assailed the nose, making people’s appetite increase. Very quickly, Xia ruofei had prepared lunch. He served the dishes he had cooked, one by one. He had especially placed the plate of braised grass carp in the middle. Then, he brought out two more bowls of rice, before calling Ling Qingxue to wash her hands and eat. Ling Qingxue had eaten Taoyuan vegetables a few times, so she naturally couldn’t resist the temptation of good food. She immediately got up to wash her hands and sat at the table. “What a sumptuous feast!” Ling Qingxue exclaimed in surprise when she saw the dishes on the table. Then, she pretended to be mature and said,”comrade Xia ruofei, you did well this time. Yup! It’s worthy of praise!” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh,”thank you for your praise, Your Highness!” Your ladyship, may I ask if we can eat now?” Ling Qingxue’s expression changed, and she said sternly,””It’s approved! Little Feizi, serve bengong my meal!” “So you’re treating me like a eunuch!” Xia ruofei said angrily,”do you think I won’t cook for you next time?” Ling Qingxue giggled and begged for mercy.”I won’t dare to do it again. I won’t dare to do it again. You’re the Emperor, okay?” “This is more like it!” Xia ruofei snorted. However, after thinking about it, he felt that it was a little inappropriate. He was the Emperor, and Ling Qingxue was the Empress. This ... Wasn’t this just a perfect couple? Xia ruofei looked at Ling Qingxue and saw that her face was also slightly red. She avoided his gaze and changed the topic. “Let’s start! I’m here to try and see if your cooking has improved ...” “I suggest you try this braised grass carp first,” Xia ruofei quickly said. “Oh? Is there anything special about it?” Ling Qingxue asked. Xia ruofei smiled mysteriously and said,””Why don’t you try it first and you’ll know?” In fact, even he himself had never tried the taste of the grass carp produced by the space fish pond, so he was also very excited about it. Ling Qingxue’s interest was immediately piqued. Her chopsticks reached directly for the plate of braised grass carp, and she picked up a small piece of fish and put it in her mouth ...
