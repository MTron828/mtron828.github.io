Chapter 577: Another breakthrough (1)

Xia ruofei first arrived at the new space.

In addition to the sound of running water, the sound of Blackie and fluffy one and two playing could be heard from time to time in the new space, which brought some vitality and vitality to the space.

As soon as Xia ruofei appeared, Blackie was the first to react. It pounced on Xia ruofei like a Black bolt of lightning and bit Xia ruofei’s pants affectionately while wagging its tail at him.

Da Mao, er Mao and the rest were not willing to fall behind. They circled around Xia ruofei and whimpered from time to time. They shook their heads and wagged their tails very meekly.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and a big bag of dog food floated over. Xia ruofei took out the dog food and poured it into a plate. As he fed Blackie and the rest, he smiled and said,””Just bear with it for a little longer. When my farm is completed, I’ll take you to the outside world!”

Blackie, fluffy one, fluffy two, and the rest had been in this spiritual Qi – rich space for many years. Their intelligence was no longer the same as before. They could understand simple words, so they ran around Xia ruofei excitedly, as if they were looking forward to the outside world that Xia ruofei had mentioned.

After Xia ruofei played with Blackie and the rest for a while, he drove the all – terrain vehicle to the giant metal fence that Xia ruofei had built personally in the Hornets ‘habitat.

The hornet’s peak was still moving in and out of the huge beehive. Each Hornet was huge, and their bright stingers were filled with killing intent. Even Xia ruofei felt a chill rising from the bottom of his heart when he saw them.

A stable ecosystem had formed within the huge metal fence. The insects that Xia ruofei had brought in previously had grown and reproduced rapidly in the rich spiritual energy environment, providing an endless supply of food for the Hornets.

Xia ruofei closed his eyes and sensed that there were almost 3000 Hornets inside the iron fence. The 200 or so Hornets that he had lost to Liang Haiming last time had been replenished, and the number had increased by a lot.

After an actual battle, Xia ruofei was more and more fond of these hidden and lethal Hornets.

He tried to control it. As he had been constantly drinking the spirit nourishment soup to enhance his mental strength, he could now control more than 400 Hornets, which was a lot better than before.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help grinning as he imagined the scene of more than 400 Hornets swarming across the sky. If anyone were to be blind and provoke him in the future, these Hornets would be his ultimate killing weapon.

......

After driving the all – terrain vehicle around the new space, Xia ruofei parked the car back to its original spot and teleported back to the original space.

Compared to the spacious new space, the original space was much smaller. In addition, there was a large area filled with large wine jars, which made it look even more crowded.

However, the Ling qi here was also extremely rich, and the air was filled with foggy ling qi. Although it was relatively narrow, taking a deep breath was still relaxing.

The harvested iron – Skin Dendrobium had begun a new round of growth, and a new round of harvesting should be ready in a month at the latest in the outside world.

The other crops, including wild ginseng, Phoebe zhennan wood, and the most authentic Dahongpao tea trees, were growing quite well under the nourishment of the spiritual energy.

The red Arowana in the big fish pond had grown a lot. Xia ruofei looked at the more than 70 Red Arowana and felt a sense of achievement.

At first, there was only one dying Red Arowana. Later on, Xia ruofei spent a lot of money to buy another one to mate with it. After that, it laid eggs and formed such a large school of fish.

Each of these top – grade Red Arowana was extremely precious. Red Arowana that were born and raised in the spirit map space were perfect in all aspects, so their price would definitely not be low.

Xia ruofei noticed that these red Arowana were around 60 to 70 centimeters long, which was slightly bigger than the pair he had given to Ling Xiaotian.

‘It’s time to sell some ...’ Xia ruofei thought.

Each of these precious ornamental fish could easily cost up to a million, or even several million, so it was naturally impossible to sell too many at once.

Xia ruofei thought that it would be best to get five or six of them the first time.

However, even if there were only five or six of them, it was already shocking enough. If he wanted to sell these blood red Dragons, he would need Ling Xiaotian’s help. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ling Xiaotian had a group of fish friends, and these people were all very financially capable. Five or six fish were easily digested.

More importantly, he could make a name for himself in the circle. Everyone would know that Xia ruofei had the means to get high – Quality Blood Dragons. In the future, he could sell these fish slowly. As long as he kept a small number of reproduced fish, he could still earn a steady stream of income.

After making up his mind, Xia ruofei did not rush to do this because he had more important things to do.

The period of consumption for the body tempering soup and the spirit bearing soup was different, but today, it just so happened that both of them were ready to be consumed.

Earning money was indeed important to Xia ruofei. After all, he still needed a steady stream of money to buy the Jade Pixiu. He had high expectations for the spirit map space, and the number of jade stones needed to upgrade the space was getting more and more terrifying.

Of course, if Xia ruofei could obtain the mysterious black stone from last time, it might be easier to upgrade the space.

But after all, it was something that could only be encountered and not sought, and there was no fixed channel to buy it.
