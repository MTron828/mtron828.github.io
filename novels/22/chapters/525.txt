“Come on!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s not bad to get a taste of Australia, but we don’t have the Fortune to enjoy Australian girls ...”

“Why is miss Ling so strict?” Liang Qichao smiled slyly and said,”this place is thousands of miles away from home. If you don’t relax, you’re not a man!”

“I’m not interested!” Xia ruofei pouted.

Liang Qichao shrugged his shoulders regretfully and looked down on Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei’s room was the master bedroom in the small villa. Liang Qichao had prepared it long ago. The bedsheets were brand new and had obviously been exposed to the sun. There was the smell of sunshine.

The night on the farm was very quiet, and it made people feel very relaxed.

He had just used his computer to video call Ling Qingxue back in China and had a brief conversation with Feng Jing. After that, he lit up a cigarette and walked to the balcony of his bedroom.

It was the end of summer in Australia, which was located in the Southern Hemisphere. Xia ruofei stood on the balcony of his bedroom. The cool breeze blew against his face, giving him an indescribable sense of comfort.

This trip was called an inspection, but in fact, it was more for leisure and relaxation. Xia ruofei’s mind was completely empty as he enjoyed the leisure of the holiday.

After finishing his cigarette, Xia ruofei returned to his bedroom. After locking the door and windows, he took out the White jade piece and the carving knife from the spirit map space.

He had to continue practicing the drawing of the core rune to maintain the feel.

The remaining white jade slips were relatively large. Xia ruofei had already mastered the 17 independent runes. Next, he would try to engrave the entire core rune after the combination in one go.

Xia ruofei planned to practice for a few more days. After returning to the country, he would officially start to engrave the runes on the Supreme – grade suet white jade.

Xia ruofei held the White jade in one hand and the carving knife in the other. After taking a deep breath, he released his spiritual power slightly and the carving knife steadily drew an arc on the White jade. Whether it was the angle of the arc or the subtle changes in depth, it was just right.

Xia ruofei’s knife flew as the White jade fragments fell continuously. Mysterious runes appeared on the White jade pieces.

After a short while, Xia ruofei lifted his carving knife and blew on the White jade. After all the fragments were blown away, a rune appeared on the surface of the White jade.

Xia ruofei sighed and mumbled to himself,””The last stroke of The Eighth Rune is one millimeter deep, and the arc of the thirteenth rune is not smooth enough ...”

This was Xia ruofei’s first time carving a complete set of core runes. In fact, it should be considered a success as the small flaws were within the range of error. However, Xia ruofei was not satisfied with just this. He had higher expectations for himself.

After a short break, Xia ruofei flipped the White jade piece over and picked up the carving knife to continue his second practice.

That night, Xia ruofei had carved four sets of core runes and used two pieces of white jade.

Three of them had some minor flaws, and only one was close to perfection.

Xia ruofei was not discouraged. He had already mastered all the runes. The only thing he lacked was practice. He believed that after a few days of practice and the day of the official engraving, he would be in his best condition and should be able to carve the core rune that he was satisfied with.

Xia ruofei kept the White jade and the carving knife. He carefully swept the shards together and put them all into the spirit map space. Then, he went to take a shower and sleep.

The next day, Liang Qichao showed Xia ruofei around.

They first went to Sydney, which was more than 160 kilometers away. Most Chinese people only knew of the Sydney Olympics and the Sydney Opera House. In reality, Sydney was the capital of New South Wales and the oldest city in Australia. It was an important economic, political, and Cultural Center.

In addition to the well – known Olympic Park and Opera House, there was also the world’s most beautiful port, the Sydney Harbor, the Sydney Tower, which allowed one to enjoy the panoramic view of Sydney from 360 degrees without any dead angle, the historical Harbor Bridge, the ocean world Aquarium, the Baylon Watchtower, and so on.

With Liang Qichao as a tour guide, Xia ruofei spent the entire day touring Sydney. He enjoyed the colorful streets of Sydney, enjoyed the scenery on the cruise ship in Sydney Harbor, tasted food, and enjoyed the sun, sand, and waves on the beautiful Pacific Coast ...

In the next few days, Liang Qichao brought Xia ruofei around the Hunter Valley.

The Hunter Valley was a famous tourist spot in Australia. There were many famous wineries and all kinds of entertainment. Tourists from all over the world came to visit. Xia ruofei lived in Paradise Farm and was close to the water. Naturally, he enjoyed the moonlight in the Hunter Valley.

Xia ruofei also experienced the Hunter Valley’s classic attraction, the hot air balloon.

It was a wonderful experience to watch sunrise in a hot air balloon.

Xia ruofei arrived at the gathering place at five in the morning. After having breakfast with the group of tourists, he took the tour company’s car to the hot – Air balloon’s departure point.

This project wasn’t cheap either. Including the breakfast, it was about 1300 Chinese dollars. However, with Xia ruofei’s current wealth, he naturally wouldn’t care about this little money.

As it turned out, the 1300 Yuan was well spent.

Xia ruofei saw the most beautiful sunrise he had ever seen. When the red sun rose from the horizon, Xia ruofei, like the other tourists, could not help but grab his DSLR camera and take pictures.
