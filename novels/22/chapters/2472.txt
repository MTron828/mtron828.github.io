2473 A shot to fame (2)

As a Cantonese man, MA Huayi loved to eat and had his own unique views on food.

He smiled at Xia ruofei and said,”CEO Xia, your” Buddha Jumps Over the Wall “is amazing!” I’ve tried the most authentic Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup at the three mountains, but it was far from as fragrant as the one made in the big jar today. ”

“Our Jiang Nan club also wants to bring in this dish ...” Ma Yun couldn’t help but say,”President Xia, your private kitchen can work with us!”

Without waiting for Xia ruofei to speak, MA huasu smiled and said,””I also want to add this dish to the staff cafeteria of our Penguin Group!”

“Low – end!” Ma Yun scoffed.

“Everyone is equal in the face of delicious food!” “Don’t think that you can deprive others of their right to taste good food just because you have some money!” MA huasu retorted sarcastically.

MA huasu’s words caused Liu Dong, Cheng Hao, and the others to burst into laughter.

If one were to say “how much money”, everyone here was within the range of “how much money”. MA Huatong’s words even included himself in the scolding.

Seeing this, Xia ruofei spread his hands and said,”Boss Ma, brother MA, the one providing ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ is Ling Ji’s private kitchen. This is also specially invited by our Paradise Club. We have a cooperative relationship, so if you want to cooperate, you can discuss it with Ling Ji F & B group. I believe they will be very happy to have such a cooperation.”

“Ling’s restaurant?” Liu Dong, who had been silent the entire time, mumbled to himself. Then, he slapped his forehead and said,”President Xia, that seems to be your girlfriend’s family’s business, right?”

Anyone who paid attention to entertainment news would know about the relationship between Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue.

Ma Yun laughed and pointed at Xia ruofei,””President Xia, you’re not kind! He actually wanted to get away with it! Fortunately, boss Liu gave us a reminder! President Xia, since it’s your girlfriend’s family’s business, you’re not an outsider! You have to help facilitate the cooperation, it’s all up to you!”

MA Huayi also nodded seriously and said,””Yup! President Xia, I’m also very sincere in bringing in such a high – Quality food and beverage company to our staff cafeteria. ”

Xia ruofei joked,”it’s not a problem for me to help you pull the strings!” But if I succeed, how are you going to thank me?”

“Why don’t ... I get brother MA to top up some Q coins for you?” Ma Yun asked, scratching his head.

Everyone burst into laughter upon hearing this. Even MA huasu couldn’t help but burst out laughing.

Xia ruofei looked helpless. He spread his hands and said,””He really didn’t pluck a single hair!”

In fact, whether it was in the Jiangnan club or in the staff cafeteria of Penguin Group, if Ling Ji’s private kitchen could really be introduced, the effect on the promotion of reputation would be immeasurable. Moreover, Ling Xiaotian had always been planning to expand, so he would definitely be more than happy to cooperate with him.

Hence, although Xia ruofei looked very reluctant, he still agreed in the end. He said that he would try his best to mediate and facilitate cooperation.

The influence of Ma Yun and the others in China was not inferior to some of the middle – Class wealthy families. Hence, people would come over to greet them and hand their business cards to them from time to time.

When they saw familiar friends, they would also pick up their glasses and walk over to chat.

Ma Yun and the rest had already experienced such social events countless times. They were all like fish in water and were very familiar with the place.

Xia ruofei, on the other hand, didn’t like to socialize much, so other than getting food from the table, he spent most of his time sitting in the corner, watching Zhao Yongjun and the others work around while he himself enjoyed the leisure. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

After the opening ceremony ended, Ma Yun and the rest bade Xia ruofei farewell and left together.

Many guests stayed behind to experience the various leisure and entertainment programs of the Paradise gathering.

The experience naturally led to consumption. The Paradise Club’s first income after its opening quickly produced a few of song Rui’s friends to play at the small golf course. Using such a venue naturally required payment.

Initially, Xia ruofei wanted to bring Ling Qingxue and Song Wei back with him. However, after the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ was revealed today, many customers had gone to book the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ for the night. The other signature dishes were also very popular, so Ling Qingxue was also busy with the staff at the private restaurant.

Hence, Xia ruofei, Song Wei, Zhuo Yiyi, and song Rui decided to go to the filming location of the life I yearn for and take a walk by the lake.

Just as they were taking a walk along the lakeside, Zhao Yongjun called.

Xia ruofei picked it up and said with a smile,””Big brother Zhao, you should drink slowly! Please don’t drink the fragments!”

Zhao Yongjun was a little tipsy and laughed,””I don’t think so. I know how much I can drink ... Ruofei, brother Zhou came to me just now. He wants to talk to you about something. Are you free now?”

Zhou leiyun? Xia ruofei was a little suspicious. Zhou Yuan’s matter had already been resolved, so why was Zhou leiyun still looking for him?

However, he had to give face to Zhao Yongjun. Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””Brother Zhao, I’m fine. Since he wants to see me, get someone to arrange a small reception room for him! I’ll be there in a while!”

“Alright!” Zhao Yongjun said,”leave it to me! Make the arrangements immediately!”

Xia ruofei could hear the excitement in Zhao Yongjun’s voice. He wasn’t completely drunk, but he must have drunk a lot.

After Xia ruofei hung up the phone, he said to Song Wei and the rest,””I have to go. Brother Zhao is looking for me. You guys can play here first! I’ll come find you guys later!”

“Go!” Song Rui waved his hand. Go! We’re happier without you ...”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Yiyi, please educate your song Rui. This kid is getting more and more arrogant!”

At this time, Song Wei also smiled and said,””I won’t stay here to be a third wheel, let’s go together! I’ll go find sister Qingxue!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei nodded.

Hence, he brought Song Wei to the main building of the club, Leaving Song Rui and Zhuo Yiyi some space.

Song Wei went to the Ling’s private kitchen to look for Ling Qingxue, while Xia ruofei went to the small meeting room that Zhao Yongjun had just arranged for him. He pushed the door open and walked in.

Zhao Yongjun and Zhou leiyun were sitting inside and chatting. When they saw Xia ruofei walk in, the two of them stood up at the same time and walked out to welcome him.

“President Xia!” Zhou leiyun had an apologetic look on his face as he said,”I’m apologizing to you again! Previously, it was my nephew Zhou Yuan ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”director Zhou, it’s all in the past now. Brother Zhao knows me well. I’m not the kind of person who would do things in front of others but plot behind their backs. So, let’s not talk about this matter anymore, okay?”

“Good, good, good! I thank you on behalf of Zhou Yuan for your magnanimity, general manager Xia!” Zhou leiyun said.

Zhao Yongjun smiled and said,”brother Zhou, I told you!” RUO Fei is a very magnanimous person, and he won’t beat around the bush. Let’s just forget about this matter, and don’t mention it to anyone in the future. ”

“I know, Yongjun!” Zhou leiyun said.

Xia ruofei looked at Zhou leiyun and asked with a smile,””General manager Zhou, I don’t think you’re meeting me again just to apologize, right? If there’s anything, why don’t we just get straight to the point? I’m a straightforward person and I don’t like to beat around the bush, so let’s just be straightforward. “
