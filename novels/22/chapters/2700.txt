2701 Chapter 1477 – in full swing (1)

After leaving the Wang family’s private restaurant, Xia ruofei went to the Liu family’s courtyard.

Old master Liu was still recuperating in the room. Xia ruofei did a routine check on his body. Since he had accepted the payment, he naturally had to do his job well.

Old man Liu was in good spirits. After the examination, Xia ruofei also found that the tumor in his body had shrunk a lot. He was recovering well.

This was not surprising. After taking over peach source Island, the ingredients of the spirit Heart Flower petals in the pills that Xia ruofei had given to old man Liu had increased by quite a bit. Naturally, the healing effect was much better.

Xia ruofei chatted with old master Liu for a while and also put in a good word for Liu Qingfeng. His words naturally revealed his hope that after the Peach Blossom Island incident was over, the Liu family would arrange a better place for Liu Qingfeng.

For such a small matter, old man Liu naturally agreed.

In fact, as long as Liu Qingfeng’s work could satisfy Xia ruofei, the Liu family would not mistreat his Qianqian. Whether it was old master Liu or Liu Qunfeng or other core members of the Liu family, they had all deeply felt Xia ruofei’s magical ability. Other aspects aside, just his superb medical skills were enough to make them work hard to be on good terms with Xia ruofei.

How could a person not get sick after eating five grains? The richer and more powerful a person was, the more they would care about their health. Otherwise, if they really died of an incurable disease, all their wealth would become floating clouds.

Now that Xia ruofei could take the initiative to put in a good word for Liu Qingfeng, it proved that Liu Qingfeng’s work was excellent, and he even had a certain personal relationship with Xia ruofei. Under such circumstances, how could the Liu family mistreat Liu Qingfeng?

Maybe in the future, when he had to deal with Xia ruofei, he could even use Liu Qingfeng!

Xia ruofei stayed at the Liu family’s house for an hour or two until he received Liu An’s call. He was informed that paradise was ready and the flight route had been approved. He stood up and left.

Before he left, Xia ruofei left behind some of the pills that he had made last time.

Although there were enough pills for him to take for a while, Xia ruofei thought that since he was already here, he should leave some for him. He didn’t know how long it would take to go to peach source Island. If things didn’t go well, he might be in danger.

Xia ruofei had even borrowed a chauffeur from the Liu family. The car he was driving was from the Paradise Club. He couldn’t just leave it at the airport! He needed someone to help him return it.

The Liu family’s chauffeur drove Xia ruofei to the Capital International Airport and then drove to the Paradise gathering in Xiaotang town to return the car.

Xia ruofei, on the other hand, passed through the security check of the public transport and arrived at the parking ground where paradise was located.

Captain Liu An and a flight attendant stood at the bottom of the plane’s accommodation ladder to welcome them.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Captain Liu, I’ll have to trouble you again!” After this trip to the Peach Blossom Island, the future should be much better. The pilots arranged by boss li are already waiting to meet you on peach source Island. In the future, we’ll use a three – man crew for long – distance flights!”

“Thank you for your concern, Mr. Xia!” Liu An bowed slightly.

Xia ruofei nodded, stepped up the ramp, and entered the cabin.

A while later, paradise took off from the runway of Beijing International Airport and jumped into the sky full of sunset.

After the plane entered the cruising altitude, Xia ruofei ate something and went to the bedroom in the back cabin to rest.

The voyage was more than ten hours long, and it was a night voyage. They couldn’t see anything outside the porthole, so sleeping was naturally the best choice.

Although the flight crew had to work through the night, Xia ruofei was sleeping in the rear cabin. He felt a little embarrassed. However, he thought about it and realized that he could not share their burden if he stayed in the cabin. He might even increase the workload of the flight crew.

Xia ruofei felt much more at ease when he thought of this.

He had stayed in the bedroom in the back cabin for the entire flight, including during the takeoff and landing phase in rainboas. He did not go out to check on the seat belt in the back cabin, so he did not need to leave the bedroom during the take – off and landing phase. However, Xia ruofei did not need any of that. He was sleeping soundly in bed.

As the sky brightened slightly, paradise finally landed steadily on the runway of Paradise island’s airport and slowly slid to the tarmac in the morning light.

This time, Xia ruofei returned to Peach Blossom Island with a big fanfare.

Therefore, Liu Qingfeng had been waiting at the airport with the remaining middle management personnel. On the other side, Li Yifu, Tang Hu, and a few leaders of the Freemasons had also been waiting on the tarmac.

As soon as the plane landed, everyone went up to greet it.

The door of the peach origin opened, and Xia ruofei appeared. He stepped down the ramp and waved to the crowd with a smile.

“Mr. Xia! You’ve had a long journey!” Li Yifu took a step forward and said.

“You guys have worked even harder!” Xia ruofei smiled.”Work is so intense. There’s no need to come to the airport to pick me up! Let’s get back to business!”

“Don’t worry! The construction work has been arranged, and our brothers are working hard! It won’t delay anything!” Tang Hu hurriedly said from the side. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Xia ruofei looked at him and smiled.””Tiger, it’s all thanks to you guys this time! Otherwise, I don’t know how long it’ll take to finish!”

In Australia, Tang Hu, who was all – Powerful and feared by the underworld, was like an obedient baby or a primary school student in front of Xia ruofei. He revealed a bashful and silly smile and scratched his head. “You’re too kind!”
