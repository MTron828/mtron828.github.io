“It’s fine as long as the official is high enough! Otherwise, you’ll be wasting my precious time!” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”brother Zhao, when are you coming to the three mountains? I’ve already swept this side of the bed three times ...”

Zhao Yongjun laughed.”Soon, Liu Jian still has some things to deal with. In two or three days at most, we’ll be here!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said,”then I won’t talk to you anymore. I’m going to take an afternoon nap.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Then just turn off your phone and go to sleep!” Zhao Yongjun said,”in case the people from Tongren Hall come over and disturb your sleep.”

“Hahaha! That makes sense!” Xia ruofei said.

After hanging up, Xia ruofei thought for a while and called Mr. Lin, who was staying in the temporary accommodation on the farm. He asked him to refund the return ticket and stay for one more day. As for his retinue, they could go back first.

Although President Lin did not understand Xia ruofei’s intentions, he agreed readily because he trusted Xia ruofei and did not want to face a lot of things when he returned to Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province.

After the call with CEO Lin, Xia ruofei really turned off his phone and went to bed to sleep.

Xia ruofei woke up naturally at around four in the afternoon. He got up from his bed, put on his clothes slowly, washed his face, and then went back to his bedroom to turn on his phone.

As soon as he turned it on, he received several text notifications for missed calls.

An unfamiliar number from Beijing, as well as Feng Jing and Liu Qian ‘s, had called him.

A smile appeared on Xia ruofei’s face. After some thought, he used his phone to call Feng Jing back.

“Chairman!” Feng Jing immediately asked,”can you come to the office for a while? Tongren Hall ...”

“Tongren Tang Group sent a Vice President over to discuss the acquisition of aweto, right?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

Feng Rao was stunned and said, “You’re really good at reading ...”

“Have they arrived?” Xia ruofei laughed.

“They arrived at our farm half an hour ago!” Feng Jing said,”this is President Tang. He wants to restart the negotiations for the acquisition of the Cordyceps and wants to personally appraise the quality of the Cordyceps. Since I couldn’t contact you, I didn’t dare to make a decision on my own. I told them to rest in the reception room.”

“Okay, I got it.” Xia ruofei replied calmly,”I just woke up and am a little hungry. I’ll make a bowl of noodles and come over after I’m done ...”

“Chairman, isn’t it a bit inappropriate to keep them waiting?” Feng Jing couldn’t help but ask.

She was just short of saying that the God of Fortune had taken the initiative to come and visit, and he still had the mood to eat instant noodles?

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I haven’t settled the score with them yet!” What’s the big deal with making them wait for a few minutes? Boss Feng, don’t worry about it, I know what I’m doing!”

“Alright then!” Feng Rao could only say helplessly.

She felt that Xia ruofei had his reasons for doing so.

As she did not know how long Xia ruofei would take to’ eat instant noodles ‘, Feng Rao could only reply ambiguously when she returned to the waiting room,””President Tang, I’m really sorry. Our President Xia has some matters to attend to. He said that you can wait for a while. He will rush over as soon as he is done with his matters.”

Feng Rao didn’t know if Tang weiran would feel neglected by her words.

That was why she was a little nervous.

However, to her surprise, Tang weiran immediately stood up and said,””In that case, let’s go downstairs to welcome President Xia! Otherwise, it would be too rude ...”

“This ...” Feng Jing was dumbfounded.”President Tang, you’re a guest, so there’s no need to welcome you. You can just rest here!” If our President Xia comes, I’ll invite him here immediately. ”

“It’s necessary, it’s necessary!” Tang Wei Ran said,”President Feng, please lead the way. I’ll go downstairs now ...”
