Chapter 774: Original form (3)

“Could it be because this bus is full?” asked Deputy bureau chief Lu.

Xia ruofei shook his head.”That doesn’t make such a big difference.”

Xia ruofei’s eyesight was far better than that of ordinary people after being strengthened by the pregnancy soup and the body tempering soup many times. Hence, he was able to detect the problem with the car.

“Then what could be the reason?” Guo Zhan asked thoughtfully.

“I think there are two reasons. First, as director Lu said, the car is full, and these people are all carrying guns and ammunition, which is quite heavy. ” Xia ruofei paused and continued,”secondly, this car might have been modified to be heavier than before!”

A light flashed in Guo Zhan’s mind and he loudly said,”Ruofei, you’re saying that ... Professor Liang might have been hidden in a modified hidden space in the car?”

“Yes, I am!” Xia ruofei said,”these people are all new faces. The police’s main target is professor Liang. As long as professor Liang is hidden well, they can easily get away with it. There’s a high possibility that the car’s chassis has undergone major surgery, and professor Liang is hidden inside!”

“That is to say ...” Guo Zhan said with a solemn expression,”this group of Japanese people is very likely to have kidnapped professor Liang and jumped out of the encirclement we set at the intersection of the city?”

Tian Feilong asked worriedly,”Could they have already gone out to sea? If that’s the case, it’ll be difficult for us to catch them ...”

Xia ruofei calmly analyzed,”there’s a possibility, but it’s not high.” First of all, we have a lot of patrols near the sea, and all the villages and towns have been notified to guard it tightly. Those illegal immigrants don’t dare to commit crimes at this time, so it’s better for them to find a place to hide and wait for the news to die down before leaving. ”

“They could totally modify the boat and leave China with professor Liang without anyone knowing!” Tian Feilong said.

Xia ruofei laughed.”Don’t forget that there are coastguards, public security border guards, and comrades from the Navy patrolling the sea. These Japanese know that they might be listed in the military and don’t dare to take the risk.” It happened so suddenly yesterday, and the people who set up the checkpoint were mainly the police officers. They were confident that we wouldn’t be able to find too many clues in a short time, so they dared to leave the city. ”

Guo Zhan, Deputy Director Lu, and the others also nodded slightly. They felt that Xia ruofei’s analysis was very reasonable.

......

Xia ruofei continued,”there’s one more thing. Let’s think from the Japanese’s point of view. They want the experimental data, and the core data has been hidden by professor Liang in a secret place. Even if we take professor Liang away now, even if professor Liang surrenders and is willing to cooperate with them, what if professor Liang can’t repeat the experiment? After all, the human brain isn’t a computer. I don’t think professor Liang can remember all the core data in his brain, right?”

“So, they just want to find a safe place to force out the whereabouts of the core data as much as possible, and then take the data away!” Guo Zhan nodded his head repeatedly. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Yes, I don’t think they’ll leave easily before they get the core data.” Xia ruofei said,”after all, it’s not easy to sneak into Huaxia. It’ll be difficult to come back after you leave. Once they get the data, it won’t be so tense anymore, and they can easily use illegal immigration ships to escape to the high seas, and then take the ship back to the Wei nation!”

Xia ruofei’s analysis was reasonable. Guo Zhan, Tian Feilong, and the others all nodded silently, thinking that this was the analysis that was closest to the truth.

Xia ruofei smiled and stood up.””Wolf King, now that the area has been reduced to a very small size, it’s time for our brothers to make a move! Let’s let these Japanese have a taste of our power!”
