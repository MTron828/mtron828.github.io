“Yes, master!” Xia Qing replied respectfully.

Xia ruofei muttered to himself and asked,””Xia Qing, how much do you think Qingxue’s cultivation talent will grow after she takes the medicine made from the heart – condensing grass? How does she compare to Song Wei?” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Xia Qing revealed a difficult expression and said,””Master, the effect of the heart concentrating grass is related to everyone’s physique. It’s hard to judge the specific effect. But ... Miss Song Wei’s talent for cultivation is higher than miss Ling ‘s. If they both take a dose of heart – concentrating grass ... I’m afraid miss Ling’s talent for cultivation ...”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I understand!” Then ... If I continue to take the same medicine, will the effect be reduced?”

“Of course,” Xia Qing answered seriously,”the medicinal effect is definitely not as good as the first time you take it, but if you can take a spiritual herb like the heart concentrating grass continuously, it will still be of great help to the improvement of your cultivation physique!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I understand!” Xia Qing, after you harvest this batch of heart – concentrating grass, you can continue to cultivate it with the time array and the spirit gathering array. I want to harvest new heart – concentrating grass in the shortest time possible!”

Xia Qing couldn’t help but be stunned. She quickly said,””Master, it will cost at least four to five spiritual crystals to cultivate a heart concentrating grass! Why don’t ... We take a look at the effects of miss Ling’s medicine before we decide?”

Spiritual crystals were extremely precious. An ordinary cultivator would not be able to collect one or two in their entire life. To cultivate a heart concentrating grass, it would require at least four to five spiritual crystals. Even Xia Qing could not help but feel a little heartache, let alone Xia ruofei.

Furthermore, Ling Qingxue was not even sure what the effects of the heart concentrating grass would be after consuming it. It was too risky to spend four to five spiritual crystals to cultivate another one!

However, Xia ruofei’s attitude was firm. He said,””No need to wait, just cultivate the second one. I’ll set up the time array, and you can start adjusting the spirit gathering array. After that, you can mix the herbs!”

Xia ruofei had always felt that he owed Ling Qingxue. If Ling Qingxue’s cultivation talent was not as good as Song Wei’s after consuming the herbs made from the heart – concentrating grass, it would take a long time for Ling Qingxue to reach Song Wei’s cultivation level. On the other hand, in the long run, Ling Qingxue’s cultivation path would be more difficult.

Since that was the case, Xia ruofei felt that he should try his best to improve Ling Qingxue’s talent in cultivation. Even if the heart – concentrating herb could not achieve the effect he wanted, at least he would not have any regrets.

Seeing Xia ruofei’s firm attitude, Xia Qing immediately said,””Yes, master!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”when the second heart condensing grass is cultivated, transport some abalones from the mountain sea realm. Use the time array flag and raise them as fast as possible until they meet the standard of a one – headed abalone. Then, turn them into dried abalones. The number ... Should be at least 15 to 20!”

The one – headed abalone that Xia ruofei had given Xu lang was from his previous stock. It had been a long time. Xia ruofei wanted to contact MA Xiong after he was done with his work. He wanted to hold an abalone auction in Hong Kong. MA Xiong would be very happy to have it.

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing said,”after the second heart concentrating grass is cultivated to maturity, I will start to work on the abalone!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”you’ve worked hard. My company in the outside world is collecting materials. As long as I have all the materials, I’ll try to make the puppet. This way, I can help you with a lot of pressure!”

“Master, I’m not tired!” Xia Qing said,”I can still handle it now!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”I can’t let you be busy alone. Anyway, I’ll get the puppet done as soon as possible. You should put more effort into the heart – concentrating grass and the abalone. It will be much easier in the future!”

Xia ruofei also considered that they still had to harvest the Cordyceps in the second half of the year, which was the most labor – consuming task. Even if Xia Qing did not sleep or rest, it would be difficult to harvest all the Cordyceps in a short time. Therefore, even if he were to create more puppets, it was already an arrow on the bow and could not be delayed any longer.

After giving Xia Qing instructions, Xia ruofei left the medium.

He kept the painting in his body, then took out his phone and gave Ling Qingxue a call.

“What’s wrong? Are you done with the guests?” Ling Qingxue picked up the phone and asked with a smile.

Ling Qingxue was well aware that Xia ruofei had always served Xu lang at Ling Ji’s private kitchen.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”yeah!” He just got on the plane! Wife, did you miss me?”

Ling Qingxue chuckled and said,”so what if I miss you?” So what if I don ‘t?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I missed you!” If you miss me too, come to the farm now ... We haven’t done that in a long time, have we?”

Ling Qingxue spat and said,””What are you thinking about?”

“Then, are you coming?” Xia ruofei chuckled.

“I’m not coming!”Ling Qingxue replied without hesitation.

“You said it yourself!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”if you miss out on something good, don’t regret it ...”

“I won’t regret it ... Wait!” Ling Qingxue suddenly came to a realization and asked,”RUO Fei, what do you mean?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”nothing much!” I just miss you and I want to see you!”
