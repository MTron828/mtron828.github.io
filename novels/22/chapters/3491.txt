Chapter 3492: Adjusting the array (2)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei did not completely treat Luo Qingfeng as a servant, so after he made the tea, he waved and said,””Qingfeng, don’t be busy. Let’s sit down and have a chat!”

“Yes!” “Yes!” Qingfeng Luo said respectfully.

After everyone sat down on the sofa, Xia ruofei said,””The harvest from this trip to the secret plane is not bad! Qingxue and 1 have also brought back some cultivation resources, hoping to improve everyone’s cultivation … Qingfeng, adopted husband, it’s been more than two months, and your cultivation has improved quite a bit! It seems that you’ve put in a lot of effort during this time!”

Xia ruofei was already in the intermediate stage of the Aurous core stage and his spiritual power had reached the spiritualisation boundary of the nascent Soul Stage. Therefore, he could tell the situation of the two of them with just a glance.

Li Yifu’s cultivation was already infinitely close to refined Qi level 8, and he was probably stuck at a bottleneck.

Although Luo Qingfeng was still at the early – Stage golden elixir realm, his cultivation had improved greatly since Xia ruofei had first taken him in as a soul slave. He was not far from the mid – Stage golden elixir realm. Of course, this was partly due to the cultivation resources that Xia ruofei had given him, but it was also partly due to his own efforts.

“Senior granduncle, I’m slow – witted and haven’t been able to break through the bottleneck,” Li Yifu quickly said.

Luo Qingfeng was very surprised that Xia ruofei could easily see through his cultivation. He could not help but ask carefully,””Master, have you already broken through?”

Xia ruofei smiled faintly.”! had some opportunities in the secret realm. Now, I’ve broken through to the intermediate stage of the Golden elixir realm.”

Luo Qingfeng’s mouth was wide open when he heard this. This was simply unbelievable to him because Xia ruofei had just broken through to the Golden core stage. The scene of Xia ruofei’s breakthrough was still vivid in his mind. In the blink of an eye, Xia ruofei had surpassed him and reached the mid – Stage golden core.

This was even easier than eating and drinking!

Li Yifu, on the other hand, was overjoyed and said,”Martial granduncle is indeed a heavenly talent! From the looks of it, even if he’s at the nascent Soul Stage, he’ll still be able to wait for a long time for martial granduncle!”

Li Yifu’s words were somewhat exaggerated. After all, Earth’s cultivation environment had been so dilapidated that no nascent soul cultivators had appeared in two to three hundred years. An expert like Chen Nanfeng had been stuck in the late – Stage of the Golden core for decades, even hundreds of years, and still could not break through to the nascent Soul Stage. It could be seen how difficult it was to reach the nascent Soul Stage.

However, to Xia ruofei, the original infant stage was not difficult at all. Hence, he only smiled and did not say anything humble.

Ling Qingxue, on the other hand, laughed after hearing Li Yifu’s words.””lf we’re talking about breaking through to the nascent Soul Stage, RUO Fei might still need some time. However, his spiritual power has already reached the spiritualisation boundary, so he’s considered to have the strength of the nascent Soul Stage!”

Ling Qingxue’s words almost made Luo Qingfeng and Li Yifu’s jaws drop. The two of them were dumbfounded.

After a long while, Luo Qingfeng asked in a trembling voice,””Master, are you … Are you serious? Has master’s spiritual power really reached the spiritualisation boundary?”

“Oh?” Xia ruofei smiled faintly.”! happened to have a fortuitous encounter in the secret realm of trials. My spiritual power broke through to the spiritualization realm by luck!”

With that, Xia ruofei released a bit of spiritual pressure, and Luo Qingfeng immediately confirmed it.

If Li Yifu did not quite understand what the spiritual power of the spiritualization realm was, then Luo Qingfeng, who was an experienced golden core cultivator, clearly knew it.

The pressure just now made him feel breathless and that aura was obviously not something a golden core cultivator could have. He had come into close contact with Chen Nanfeng before and felt that Chen Nanfeng’s aura was almost beyond the scope of a golden core cultivator. However, compared to the pressure that Xia ruofei had just released, Chen Nanfeng’s aura was insignificant.

Without a doubt, this was the pressure of a nascent soul cultivator. It was a suppression that transcended realms!

“Master is truly a genius!” Luo Qingfeng was full of admiration.”With the cultivation of the intermediate stage of the Golden core realm, possessing the spiritual power of the spiritualisation realm, this may be an unprecedented miracle!” Master, it seems like it’s only a matter of time before you reach the nascent Soul Stage!”

Now, Luo Qingfeng’s admiration for Xia ruofei could not be any greater. After all, he was at the nascent Soul Stage! It was a legendary existence.

Xia ruofei laughed and waved his hand.”As long as you work hard, the Yuanying stage is not a distant dream! There will only be more and more cultivation resources in the future. I’m just afraid that your cultivation is not enough and you won’t be able to enjoy it!”

“Thank you, master!”

“Many thanks, grand uncle – Master!”

Xia ruofei stood up and said,”I’ve also brought back a set of array flags. It can greatly improve the cultivation environment. I’m preparing to set it up near this building. This will further improve everyone’s cultivation efficiency.” “There’s such a precious formation flag?” Luo Qingfeng was both surprised and delighted.”It seems like master’s exploration of the mystic realm this time has really yielded great results!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s a good harvest indeed!” 1’11 study the Taixu xuanqing formation first to prevent the two formations from clashing. All of you can go and cultivate!”

“Yes! Master!”

“Martial granduncle, this disciple will take his leave first!” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Xia ruofei nodded and said to Ling Qingxue and Song Wei,””Qingxue, Weiwei, you two cultivate in your rooms first. I’m going out for a walk. I’ll be back soon!”

With that, Xia ruofei stepped on the Azure immortal sword and flew out of the balcony.

The Taixu xuanqing formation had been set up by Xia ruofei himself. He was very familiar with the principles and every detail of the formation.

Although Xia ruofei had not fully studied the set of array flags called the highest heaven array that he had obtained from the Tower of Trials, he had a basic understanding of its principles and effects.

Therefore, what Xia ruofei had to do was actually very simple. He only needed to make some minor adjustments to the Taixu xuanqing formation and shift the effects of some of the formations within a small area of the building. He only needed to retain and strengthen the function of gathering spiritual energy.

In the past, it would not have been easy to complete this task.

However, the current Xia ruofei had comprehended the array Dao in the trial Pagoda, especially some of the array Dao inheritances on the ninth floor. His current array Dao level was on a completely different level compared to when he had set up the Taixu xuanqing formation.

Hence, this adjustment was not difficult for Xia ruofei.

He circled around the formation and quickly came up with a draft.

Actually, there weren’t many places that needed to be changed. Just slightly adjusting two or three array foundations would be able to achieve the effect of using four Liang to divert a thousand Jin.

Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to control the core of the Taixu xuanqing formation and stopped the entire formation from operating.

Then, he controlled the blue travel immortal sword and flew through the array. After a while, he finished the adjustment. In order to make the adjusted array more stable, Xia ruofei specially added two more Jade talismans to the two array bases.

It was actually very dangerous to add and delete at will like this. If the adjustment was wrong, it could cause the formation to collapse.

However, Xia ruofei’s array skills had already reached such a high level. He could use very delicate ideas easily. If a cultivator with a certain level of array skills saw Xia ruofei’s adjustments, he would definitely be shocked.

Xia ruofei didn’t even simulate the entire formation in his mind. He adjusted it according to his own thoughts and finished the adjustment very quickly.

After that, he confidently reactivated the Taixu xuanqing formation. The entire process took less than half an hour.

After the Taixu xuanqing formation was reactivated, it was still very stable, as if it had not been affected at all.

In fact, Xia ruofei could have made some improvements to the current formation and increased the power of the Taixu xuanqing formation in terms of gathering spiritual energy, trapping enemies, and killing enemies. However, he placed more importance on the Luotian formation now, so he did not have the time to adjust the Taixu xuanqing formation.

When he was free, he could try to improve the formation..
