Chapter 1515: A great harvest (2)

Translator: 549690339

“I understand.” Xia ruofei’s breathing became chaotic and he was very excited.

He subconsciously turned his head to look at the White realm Fox.

The little fellow was eating happily. Perhaps it felt Xia ruofei’s gaze, it turned its head and looked over. Its eyes even swept past the box of crystals, but it showed a disdainful expression. It was not interested in them at all.

Xia ruofei also heaved a long sigh of relief and said,””It seems like I made the right decision to come here. I’ve gained a lot this time!”

With that, Xia ruofei was ready to put all the spiritual crystals into the spirit map space.

At this time, Xia Qing reminded him,”master, I suggest that you put this box in as well.” If I’m not wrong, this box should be made of thousand – year ebony. It can shield spiritual power and is a pretty good treasure. Moreover, the spiritual crystals can be stored in boxes made of thousand – year ebony to prevent the loss of spiritual energy. ”

“Understood!” Xia ruofei said.

Then, he closed the box and put the entire box into the spirit map space with a thought.

His spiritual force sensed that the box had appeared out of thin air in the spirit map space. Only then did he feel completely at ease. These precious spirit crystals truly belonged to him now, and there were no side effects.

Xia ruofei then turned his eager gaze to the other slightly smaller box.

The smaller box was also made of thousand – year ebony. The big box had already given Xia ruofei such a big surprise. What kind of treasure could there be in this small box?

Xia ruofei was filled with anticipation.

He reached out to open the box that was also unlocked and looked up impatiently.

“What is this?” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but Mutter to himself.

Eight small flags lay quietly in the small box, each with a different pattern drawn on it.

These patterns looked a little like formation patterns, and the seemingly messy lines formed a mysterious pattern.

Xia ruofei said with uncertainty,””Could this be an array flag?”

He had just learned about array Dao, and when he was cracking the array on the stone wall at the entrance, his array Dao level had also improved by leaps and bounds. Therefore, the first thing he thought of was array flags.

The array flag was also a tool for setting up arrays. It was specially made by array Masters to set up special arrays. However, this method was relatively ancient and had gradually been lost in later generations. Hence, the array books that Xia ruofei had come into contact with only mentioned it but did not introduce it in detail.

Hence, Xia ruofei could only guess.

The array path ancient book in the earth character jade talisman didn’t have a detailed introduction, so Xia Qing naturally didn’t know what these small flags were. Everything could only be explored by Xia ruofei.

He picked up one of the small flags and looked at it. There was no doubt that it was an array pattern. However, this array pattern was different from all the basic array patterns that Xia ruofei had learned. It seemed to be of a completely different system, making Xia ruofei unable to study it even if he wanted to.

The material of the small flag was neither silk nor cloth. It felt a little rough to the touch, but it was very tough. It must not be an ordinary item.

Xia ruofei picked up another small flag. At this moment, his eyes narrowed. He put down both small flags and searched the box.

Then, a jade talisman appeared in his hand.

It turned out that the Jade talisman was at the bottom of the box and was hidden by the eight small flags. Xia ruofei did not notice it at first.

Xia ruofei had only noticed it when he picked up the second flag and revealed a corner of the talisman.

Xia ruofei was no stranger to such Jade talismans.

Essentially, it was no different from the human jade talisman and the earth jade talisman. They were all used to store information and were equivalent to the ‘mobile hard disk’ of the cultivation world.

The only difference was that there were no lines on the Jade talisman. Xia ruofei tried to inject his spiritual power into the Jade talisman and immediately read the information inside.

This jade talisman must be the ‘standard’ version, while the human and earth talismans he had come across before were probably ‘custom – made’. The purpose was to prevent people with insufficient spiritual power cultivation from encountering danger when accepting the inheritance. The lines were equivalent to a threshold.

Xia ruofei read the information in the Jade talisman and the joy on his face grew.

Through the introduction of the Jade talisman, Xia ruofei found out that these eight small flags were a set of array flags. With them, one could set up a very magical array.

The only use of this formation was to change the flow of time.

To Xia ruofei, this kind of array that could change the flow of time was extremely profound. In fact, the spirit map space was an enclosed space with a time array. With Xia ruofei’s current level of array Dao, he could not even understand the basic array patterns of this array, let alone successfully set it up.

However, with these 8 array flags, Xia ruofei only needed to set up the array flags according to the directions in the Jade talisman and he would be able to set up the time formation.

This formation could accelerate time by a hundred times at most.

Xia ruofei even wondered if the effects could be stacked if he used these 8 array flags in the primal realm.

If he could, that would be too terrifying.

The time flow at the Archean realm was already 30 times faster than normal. If a time array was added to it, the time flow would reach a terrifying 3000 times. In other words, a day in the outside world was nearly 10 years in the array!

Of course, this was only the maximum effect that eight array flags could achieve.

In fact, the effect of setting up a time formation with this set of formation flags was inversely proportional to the range of the formation.

The time formation set up by these eight formation flags could cover a radius of two miles at most. Of course, in this case, the time inside the formation could only be accelerated by ten times.

However, if the area of the formation was only about three feet in radius, it could basically reach the limit of 100 times the time flow.

This was very useful to Xia ruofei.

First of all, if he were to plant any spiritual medicine that required a large amount of time to grow, this time formation would simply be a super ripening agent!

In addition, this time formation could also be used in the outside world, which made it even more meaningful.

What was even more amazing was that if the positions and methods of setting up the eight array flags were slightly changed, they could instantly become a time – decelerating array with the opposite effect.

It could be said that if used properly, the effect of this set of array flags could be simply too great.

“Treasure!” Xia ruofei’s eyes lit up. He put the array flags and Jade talismans into the wooden box without any hesitation.

He then waved his hand and the wooden box was also kept into the spirit map space.

Using array flags to set up an array also required a certain amount of practice. However, Xia ruofei obviously did not have the time to familiarize himself with it now. It was better to keep it first. It would not be too late to study it slowly after leaving the underground palace.

Xia ruofei did not expect that other than the world stones, his harvest this time would be so great.

He turned his gaze to the statue holding the halberd, and even thought of taking the statue with him.

However, Xia ruofei subconsciously felt that this statue was very dangerous, especially its eyes, which seemed to be able to see through one’s soul. If one looked into its eyes, he felt as if his soul was going to be sucked away.

Taking a step back, the two boxes that Xia ruofei had received today should be related to this statue. Since he had obtained such a great benefit, Xia ruofei would naturally not be disrespectful to this statue. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

He bowed three times in front of the statue and said,””Thank you for your gift, senior! I’ll definitely treasure these cultivation resources and work hard to reach a higher realm!”

Xia ruofei looked at the white fox after he finished speaking.

The remaining world stones had already been eaten by it. Xia ruofei really could not imagine that this world Fox looked like a little kitten. How could its stomach contain so much food?

After eating all the world stones, the realm Fox’s stomach only bulged slightly, and it didn’t look like it was full at all.

Moreover, after eating so many realm stones, the White realm Fox did not show any signs of evolution. It was just smacking its lips as if it had not had enough.

Xia ruofei walked in front of the white fox and asked,””Little guy, now that I’ve helped you get what you wanted, can you help me find my friend? Do you know where she is?”
