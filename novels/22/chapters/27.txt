Chapter 28: The Chief’s Rage

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

At the Joint Office of the Jinling War Zone.

There was a sharp squeal of brakes and a mud-spattered SUV command vehicle screeched to a halt.

A colonel in woodland camouflage, with his face still painted, jumped out of the car and hurried into the staff office building.

In the Joint Staff Operations department.

The colonel, covered in mud, came straight to the minister’s office. “Report,” he shouted energetically. When he received permission, he pushed open the door and went in.

“Chief!” The colonel called out with a crisp lean-to as he entered the room.

There was a middle-aged man of about 50 year old sitting behind the desk. He had a gold-flecked rank of major general on his crisp uniform. The major general was slightly surprised to see the colonel. He asked.

“Guo Zhan? Shouldn’t you be training with the wolf cubs at the Green Cloud Mountain base? Why did you suddenly come back?”

Guo Zhan was the captain of the Lone Wolf Commando Team, codenamed “Wolf King.”

He said.

“Chief, I have an emergency to report to you. One of our brothers who retired this year has run into a little trouble…”

“Retired this year? I remember that during this year, you only recruited people and didn’t have anyone who retired…” the major general said in confusion, but then he reacted and raised his eyebrows. “You mean the Blood Wolf? The Blood Wolf who voluntarily withdrew from active service because he was terminally ill?”

“Yes, Chief!” Guo Zhan said.

“What happened to him? Did he encounter some problems?” the major general asked, sitting up a little straighter.

For Guo Zhan to rush over from the training base in the suburbs in such a hurry, without even having time to change out from his muddy camouflage uniform, this matter must not be small.

As the head of the Lone Wolf Commando, the major general knew that his soldiers were all killing machines. If they were to be treated unfairly when they retired to the local area, it was very likely that their killing intent would be aroused and cause serious social harm.

Even though the soldier was terminally ill, the major general did not doubt his lethality.

“Chief, this matter has something to do with Wild Wolf,” Guo Zhan said.

“Wild Wolf?” The major general looked wistful. “You mean Comrade Lin Hu, who died at the border two years ago?”

“Yes!” Guo Zhan said. “Lin Hu and Xia Ruofei are from the same hometown and are best brothers. Moreover, Lin Hu sacrificed himself to save Xia Ruofei, so Xia Ruofei has deep feelings for Lin Hu and his family. After he retired, he went to the small island village where Lin Hu’s family lived to visit Lin Hu’s mother…”

Guo Zhan briefed the major general on what had happened.

The Major General’s face grew uglier as he listened. When he heard that the deputy director of the small police station had actually spoken rudely and said, ‘How much is the family of a martyr worth?’ he finally couldn’t hold back his anger. He slammed the table and stood up.

“Bastards! My soldiers sacrificed their lives at the border to protect these lawless bastards? If the Wild Wolf knew about this in the underworld, how disappointed would he be?”

“Chief, calm down!” Guo Zhan quickly stood up and said.

“I can’t calm down!” The major general was furious, his face cold and murderous. He said, “Guo Zhan, I’ll handle this matter personally! If the local authorities don’t give me a satisfactory explanation, I’ll personally go over and destroy that bullshit police station!”

“Yes!” Guo Zhan said, saluting.

There was a hint of excitement in his eyes. He was very clear about the background of the chief. He was definitely more than just a major general in the military. This time, the chief was really angry, and he was going to take action personally. Li Zhengyi, Zhong Qiang, and the others were going to be in deep trouble this time.

The major general made several calls in front of Guo Zhan.

Guo Zhan did not know who the chief had called, but he could infer from the few words he had heard that the people on the other end of the line were of extraordinary status. Some were from the local area and some were in the military.

The chief, who only had the rank of major general, was also very solemn in his conversation. He was obviously very angry.

After the telephone call the Major General leaned back in his chair and said.

“Go get yourself a glass of water! Stay here and wait for the news. If I’m not satisfied with today’s matter, I’ll go to the Southeast Province with you!”

“Yes! Thank you, Chief!” Guo Zhan puffed out his chest.

…

The major general’s phone calls had already caused an uproar in Southeast Province.

In the Three Mountains City Government Office Building. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Mayor Tian Huilan was signing a document with a slight frown when the red phone on her desk rang urgently.

Tian Huilan put down her pen and reached for the phone.

“Hello… Secretary Lin, hello… Yes… Yes… Yes… Understood… I’ll be right there!”

After hanging up the phone, Tian Huilan’s expression became extremely solemn. Secretary Lin of the Provincial Party Committee had personally called, and it even involved a military conflict. Most importantly, it had happened in the jurisdiction of her Three Mountain City. How could this matter be small?

She pressed the internal intercom and said.

“Little Wu, come in for a while!”

There was a soft knock on the office door. Secretary Wu Liqian pushed it open and said.

“You wanted to see me, Mayor?”

“Little Wu, inform Comrade Chen Bo from the Municipal Public Security Bureau and Commissar Wu Huai from the garrison to come to the municipal government immediately. It’s an urgent matter! Also, get Little Zhang to prepare the car. When Director Chen and Commissar Wu arrive, we have to set off immediately. Tell them that I’ll tell them in detail on the way!”
