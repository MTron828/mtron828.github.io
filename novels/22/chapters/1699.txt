“Brother, you’re already in Australia, so I’ll naturally arrange everything,” Tang Yitian said with a smile.”I’m so embarrassed that you have to drive yourself to Sydney. ” It’s settled then, I’ll get Tiger to pick you up at the Hunter Valley!”

Xia ruofei said helplessly,”alright!” We’ll listen to big brother Tang’s arrangements!”

“That’s the way!” Tang Yitian said happily.

After Xia ruofei hung up, he said to Feng Jing,””Sister ran, let’s go to Sydney together this afternoon! Big brother Tang already knows that I’m coming, so he called me just now to blame me ...”

“Are you President Tang of the Meya group?” Feng Rao asked.

She had a brief contact with Tang Yitian and his wife when they were in the capital. At that time, Jennifer took the initiative to endorse the jaded skin cream for free, which solved Feng Jing’s urgent need.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” Let’s not go out in the afternoon! Big brother Tang will send someone to pick us up!”

“Alright, I’ll follow your arrangements.” Feng Jing nodded.

At noon, Xia ruofei took a short nap. At twoo’ clock, the guard at the door reported that Tang Hu had arrived at Paradise Farm. Xia ruofei immediately ordered the guard to let him through, then called Feng Rao to pack up and go downstairs.

Soon, they saw an extended Bentley slowly driving over. Before the car stopped, Tang Hu, who was dressed in a Black Tang suit, quickly opened the door and got out of the car. He quickly walked to Xia ruofei and bowed to him. Then, he said respectfully,””Hello, Mr. Xia! I’m here on fifth uncle’s orders to take you to the sutsuni!”

The fifth uncle Tang Hu was talking about was Tang Yitian, who was the fifth brother in the family. Tang Hu’s father had passed away early, and Tang Yitian had always treated this nephew as his own son. Tang Hu also had a lot of respect for Tang Yitian.

Last time, when Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao went to the Mei ya group’s reception, Tang Hu unknowingly offended Xia ruofei and was beaten up by the Furious Tang Yitian in public. After knowing the whole situation, Tang Hu not only didn’t dare to have the slightest resentment towards Xia ruofei, but also respected and feared him.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”thanks for your hard work, Tiger!” Then let’s go!”

“Mr. Xia, please!” Tang Hu jogged over to open the car door, respectfully saying.

If anyone saw master Hu of the righteous Association and the underground King of New South Wales being so respectful to a young man in his twenties, they would probably be shocked.

However, Tang Hu and Tang Yitian’s secular identity didn’t give Xia ruofei any psychological pressure. He accepted Tang Hu’s courtesies with ease.

After Xia ruofei and Feng Rao got into the car, Tang Hu quickly closed the door and jogged around the front of the car to sit in the front passenger seat.

The Bentley started slowly and left Paradise Farm.

On the way, Xia ruofei asked,”Tiger, brother Tang said he wanted to introduce a friend to me. Do you know who he is?”

“Mr. Xia, I’m not sure about this ... But fifth uncle said that an important guest will be coming to Australia in the next two days. I wonder if he’s the one he’s going to introduce you to ...”

“Oh, I know ...” Xia ruofei nodded.

Tang Hu saw that Xia ruofei had nothing to ask, so he said,””Mr. Xia, please take a rest in the car! If there’s anything you need, you can call me through the communication device in the car. ”

Finished speaking, Tang Hu pressed a button, and a partition slowly rose, separating the front and back of the car.

This was the standard configuration of the extended Bentley. The partition could not only block out sound and sight, but it was also bulletproof, which could create a safe and private environment for the passengers in the back.

The car’s shock absorption was quite good, and the quality of the Australian roads was not bad, so the car was quite stable when driving. Many times, if you didn’t look out the window, you wouldn’t even feel the car moving.

In such an environment, it was easy for people to feel sleepy. Xia ruofei and Feng Jing chatted for a while and then leaned back in their seats to rest.

It was not until night fell that Xia ruofei opened his eyes. He looked out of the window and realized that they had entered the city. He gently nudged Feng Jing and said,””Sister che, get up! Don’t sleep ...”

“Have we arrived?” Feng Rao rubbed her sleepy eyes and asked.

“Not yet!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”but soon ... I woke you up to let you enjoy the night view of the suttani!”

At this time, the car just passed by the harbor Bridge, and the famous opera House could be seen in the distance. In the night, the lights of various colors changed, making the unique outline of the Opera House look magnificent.

Feng Jing was quickly entranced by the beautiful night view and leaned against the car window to admire it.

Tang Yitian’s Manor wasn’t far from the harbor Bridge. It was located in the wealthy area of tautiny, Vaucluse. From his home, he could see the Sydney Harbor, the harbor Bridge, and the Opera House. He even had a private beach, covering an area of more than 15 acres. In the wealthy area of tautiny, where every inch of land was worth its weight in gold, it was definitely a first – Class luxury mansion.

Not long after the car drove off the harbor Bridge, they arrived at the luxurious Manor.

The extended Bentley drove directly to the six – story main building of the manor and slowly stopped. Tang Yitian, his wife, and Tang Haoran were already standing at the door waiting. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Tang Hu quickly got out of the car and opened the door for Xia ruofei.
