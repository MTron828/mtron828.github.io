Chapter 1615: Liu er_1 nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Zhao Yongjun pointed at the barren land and said,””There’s a hot spring resort less than three kilometers West of this location, and there’s a large outdoor amusement park in the South. If we develop this place, according to the development speed of little Tang town, it will soon be connected with those places. “Moreover, every inch of land in the city center is worth its weight in gold. The air, environment, and so on are getting worse and worse. The rich people come to the suburbs for leisure. It’s only an hour’s drive from the city center to here. This location is still very good.”

Xia ruofei nodded and pointed to a small lake in the distance.””Big brother Zhao, where does this land stretch to? Is that Lake within the area?”

Zhao Yongjun smiled.”The boundary of this plot is on the lakeside. Of course, if we develop it into a high – end club, we can use the lake.”

Song Rui said,”I’ve already thought about it. We’ll build a few holiday villas by the lake. We can build a mini – golf Course on the hillside. The main building of the club will be in front. It’ll be convenient to come from the main road!”

Xia ruofei laughed.”It sounds good. If we can get this land, we won’t lose anything just from the increase in value of the land!”

“Yup!” Zhao Yongjun said,”the profits of the real estate industry these few years are really high. Although we’re not in the real estate industry, the value of these dozens of acres of land can indeed increase by a lot. This location is really good!”

Song Rui also said,”by the way, the northern part of the land hasn’t been developed yet. It’s estimated that it will be sold in the next two years. If we manage it well, we can buy the land there and connect it with the clubhouse. Then, we can add more entertainment facilities. It’s even quite good to build a racing track!”

This kid still couldn’t forget about the race track. And it wasn’t just song Rui. Even Liu Jian, Xu Zixuan, and the others were eager to give it a try. This group of young masters still liked those passionate activities.

Xia ruofei, Zhao Yongjun, and the rest got into the car again and walked around the plot of land. When there were no roads in some places, Xia ruofei would get out of the car and walk over to check. After looking around, Xia ruofei was quite satisfied.

This place had beautiful mountains and clear waters, pleasant scenery, and a quiet environment. It was indeed very suitable to build a high – end club.

Just as everyone was about to get into the car and leave, a Knight XV off – Road vehicle drove over from a distance.

The Knight XV was an impressive off – Road vehicle with a very small audience. There were only a few of them in the country. Xia ruofei happened to have one, so he couldn’t help but take a second look.

Xia ruofei didn’t notice that Zhao Yongjun, song Rui, and the others ‘expressions changed when they saw the car.

The car reached Xia ruofei’s group in no time. However, it did not stop immediately. Instead, it sped past them at a high speed. Then, it slammed on the brakes, bringing up a cloud of dust.

Zhao Yongjun couldn’t help but frown, and song Rui’s eyes also showed a trace of anger.

After the car stopped, Xia ruofei saw a young man with shiny hair and wearing an exquisite, custom – made suit jump out of the back seat. The doors of the driver’s seat and the passenger’s seat opened quickly. Two brawny Men in Black suits were two steps behind the young man, one on the left and one on the right.

When the young man saw song Rui and the others, he showed a faint smile from afar and said,””I was wondering who it was! It’s young master Song!”

There was a hint of cynicism in his tone, and then his gaze fell on Zhao Yongjun.””Yo! Brother Zhao is here too! What a coincidence today!”

Looking at his behavior, he seemed to have a bit of respect for Zhao Yongjun, but he didn’t care much about song Rui. As for Xia ruofei, Liu Jian, Xu Zixuan, and the others, they were completely ignored by him.

Song Rui snorted coldly and said,”Liu er, you’re really arrogant!” Can’t you see that we’re here? Who are you trying to intimidate with all this dust?”

Xia ruofei was not familiar with the rich men in the capital. His social circle was only limited to Zhao Yongjun and song Rui’s friends.

However, the capital was so big, and there were countless big and small noble families. Xia ruofei naturally could not know everyone.

At the very least, he had no impression of this young man, who song Rui called Liu er.

Xu Zi Xuan seemed to see it, he came over and said in a low voice: “Ruofei, this guy is Liu haofan. He’s from the Liu family and is ranked second in the family ...”

“Which old Liu family?” Xia ruofei was confused.

“It’s that old Liu’s family!” Xu Zi Xuan said in a riddle.

Then, he moved closer to Xia ruofei’s ear and said a name.

Xia ruofei suddenly realized that the old man’s name was like thunder to his ears.

No wonder Liu haofan was so confident in front of song Rui. It turned out that the one in his family was on par with elder song. Even in the capital, where there were many powerful people, he was definitely one of the top nouveau riche.

Sure enough, Xu Zi Xuan whispered: “The Liu family and the song family are on par in terms of strength. They’re both top – tier rich families in the capital ... Song Rui and Liu er have never gotten along since they were young. It can be said that the two of them grew up fighting ...”
