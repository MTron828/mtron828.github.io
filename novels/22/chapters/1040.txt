Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”I’m very relieved to have capable subordinates like you!” Besides, I’ve already completed the core work, so there’s no need for me to do the rest by myself, right?”

“Fine, we’re already used to it,” Feng Rao said helplessly.

Then, Feng Rao couldn’t help but say,””Chairman, are you doing this on purpose? I’m about to leave for Hong Kong, but you’re making such a big move ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”just go on your business trip as usual!” It’s not a matter of one or two days from approval to production anyway. ”

“How can I do that?” Feng Jing replied,”there are many things to do in the early stages of marketing! Before the soldiers and horses moved, the rations would go first! The advertising will definitely be a step ahead!”

Feng Jing couldn’t sit still anymore. She stood up and said,””Why don’t I change my ticket? Delay your trip to Hong Kong for two days and gather our colleagues in the marketing department to discuss the overall plan. Otherwise, I won’t be at ease ...”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”don ‘t, don’ t, don’t ... CEO Feng, you’ve already set a time with Hengfeng. It’s not good to stand them up.” You should hand over the preliminary work of the Jade skin cream to Xiao Qiang first!”

“But I’ve been using the jaded skin cream, so I have the most comprehensive and direct understanding of this product ...” Feng Rao frowned.

Xue Jinshan’s eyes suddenly changed. Before this product was launched, director Feng had already used it for a long time. Needless to say, it must have been given to her by director Xia. Their relationship was indeed not ordinary!

Xia ruofei also noticed Xue Jinshan’s gaze and couldn’t help but say,””Kanayama, what’s with your expression? How noble and fearless is it to experience the product development process personally, President Feng?”

“That’s right, that’s right. Leaders, please continue ...”Xue Jinshan said while trying to hold back his laughter.

Feng Rao blushed and said,””I think I should have the most say in this product. I’m a little worried about letting the marketing department handle it ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”President Feng!” You’re going to Hong Kong, not Mars! At most, I’ll let director Xiao and the others come up with an overall plan first and then pass it to you for you to look through! If you really can’t do it, you can have a video conference, you can just do it in Hong Kong ...”

Feng Rao was also confused. She placed too much importance on the jaded skin cream.

She nodded helplessly and said,””That’s the only way! President Xia, there’s still some time left. Let’s hurry back to the farm! I want to gather Xiao Qiang and the others for a short meeting!”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,” Jinshan, I’ll go back with President Feng first.” Keep an eye on the factory ... Right, clean that production line first and continue producing the heart – nourishing soup!”

“Yes, President Xia!” Xue Jinshan quickly replied.

Feng Jing thought for a moment and reminded him,”Jinshan, the heart – nourishing soup will pass the vetting process very soon. When the jaded skin ointment is put into production again, our two production lines will definitely be stretched thin. I’ve read the report you made last time about increasing the production line. Two more lines are definitely not enough. We’ll increase it by six!” By then, three of them will be used to produce the heart – nourishing soup, and five will be used to produce the jaded skin ointment. It should be enough for the early stage. ”

Obviously, Feng Jing was quite optimistic about the market prospects of the jaded skin ointment.

“Alright, I’ll revise the report immediately and submit it again!” Xue Jinshan said happily.

The better the pharmaceutical factory’s development was, the higher his position in the company as the director. His income was also linked to the benefits of the factory. Of course, he welcomed such a good opportunity with both hands.

“By the way, Chairman, the raw materials for the jaded skin cream ...” Feng Jing asked after some thought.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”other than one key ingredient, I’ve already handed over dozens of other ingredients and their ratios to Kanayama. I’ll personally provide the last ingredient. Furthermore, the production process and parameters have already been sealed and solidified into the program. Therefore, there’s no problem keeping the prescription a secret!”

Feng Jing heaved a sigh of relief. Although intellectual property protection was much better than it had been a few years ago, when the profits were so huge that it could drive people crazy, the protection of the law would always be weak. Most of the time, one had to rely on themselves.

Feng Jing was very confident in Xia ruofei. Since Xia ruofei said that there was no problem keeping it a secret, the probability of a leak was very low.

“Then, Jinshan, you have to start stocking up on the raw materials and medicinal herbs now. I think the approval for the jaded skin ointment will be approved very soon. Once it’s on the market, there will be a wave of people snatching it. You must prepare for a rainy day!” She said to Xue Jinshan.

“Alright, CEO Feng!” Xue Jinshan replied seriously.

Xia ruofei and Feng Jing said a few more words before they left the pharmaceutical factory.

On the way back to Taoyuan farm, Feng Jing kept jotting down something in her notebook.

Xia ruofei guessed that she must have written down the important points to emphasize in the meeting later.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be secretly speechless. This strong woman was really crazy when she got into work mode.

Luckily, she had to leave for Hong Kong in the afternoon. Otherwise, Xia ruofei could imagine how she would feel when this unforgettable product was released. The employees in the marketing department would probably have to work overtime as well.

After returning to the farm, Feng Jing knew that Xia ruofei would definitely not be attending their meeting. Hence, she bade Xia ruofei farewell and hurried upstairs.

Xia ruofei only found out that Feng Jing had brought them to a meeting until two in the afternoon when she met Xiao Qiang, who had just come out of the cafeteria after lunch, while she was walking around in the evening. Even lunch was packed up by the administrative staff from the cafeteria.

Feng Rao made use of every minute to voice out her thoughts and assign tasks.

After the meeting, Feng Jing returned to her room to grab her luggage before heading to the airport.

As for Xiao Qiang and the others, they began to work according to Feng Rao’s arrangements.

Although Feng Jing had gone to Hong Kong, Xiao Qiang and the others still had a lot of work to do. They would probably have to work overtime for the next few days.

In Xiao Qiang’s half – joking words, even the canteen was caught off guard. After all, there were not so many people who had dinner at the company in the past. Today, the entire marketing department had stayed behind, and the food in the canteen was a little insufficient. In the end, Cao tieshu’s wife even specially cooked a large pot of noodles for everyone to eat their fill.

Xia ruofei felt that it was both funny and helpless. He could only give Xiao Qiang a few words of encouragement. He told him that the company placed great importance on the jaded skin cream and that his colleagues in the marketing department had worked hard. He would definitely give everyone a bonus after the product was launched.

Time passed day by day.

The employees of the company’s marketing department were working at full capacity, including the art team where Lin Qiao was. They were also full of tasks.

The packaging design for the dried abalone was completed quickly. Xia ruofei personally picked one out of the three designs. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

According to Xia ruofei’s request, the art team had sent him the three design drafts without a signature. Xia ruofei did not want to be affected by his own subjective factors.

Under such circumstances, the one that Xia ruofei was most satisfied with was actually designed by Lin Qiao.

The little girl was so happy that she almost jumped up.

Of course, Xia ruofei chose this design mainly because of its creativity. In terms of art design and software usage, Lin Qiao was naturally not as good as Zhong Lingling and the others.

Therefore, even though Xia ruofei had chosen this design, Zhong Lingling was still the one who beautified Lin Qiao’s draft and produced it outside.

Xia ruofei had bought a vacuum – sealing machine before and kept it in his interspace. Hence, after he took out the vacuum – sealing machines, he quickly changed the packaging of his dried abalones.

Lin Qiao’s design was simple, elegant, and fresh. At the same time, it highlighted the brand characteristics and LOGO of paradise Corporation. After the abalone was changed into the new packaging, it really felt different.

Xia ruofei was also very satisfied.

Five days passed by in the blink of an eye. The auction for the top – grade one – headed abalone was to be held in the grand banquet hall of Hengfeng Jiahua Hotel in Hong Kong the next day.

Xia ruofei received a call at noon.

“Hello, Mr. Xia. I’m Xue Ming from the Hengfeng group’s San Shan office. I’m at the farm’s entrance.” A voice said respectfully.

“Okay, thank you for your hard work, manager Xue!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”pass the phone to the security guard at the entrance!”

Xia ruofei ordered the old soldiers on duty at the door to let them in and asked them to point the way for Xue Ming.

Then, he picked up the large thermal box that he had prepared earlier and walked out of the villa.
