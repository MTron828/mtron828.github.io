2209 Face to face_“Oh!” Song Wei said,”then I’ll go back to the capital directly after the field trip! I’ll see you in Beijing then!”

“Good, good, good!” Xia ruofei said.

Ling Qingxue saw that Xia ruofei and Song Wei had been talking for a long time and did not get to the point. She could not help but frown. She went around to Xia ruofei and quickly wrote on the paper,”stop talking nonsense and get to the point!” He picked it up and showed it to Xia ruofei with a threatening look.

“Ruofei, why did you video call me today?” Song Wei asked.

Xia ruofei smiled awkwardly and said,””That’s true ... That ... Qingxue’s cultivation has been progressing rather quickly recently. She has already reached the peak of refined Qi Level 3.”

“Is that so?” Song Wei was pleasantly surprised.”That’s really fast progress! Then, did you ...”

“We’ve already tried to combine our spirit and body once!” Xia ruofei gave a definite answer.

“That’s great!” Song Wei said happily. Then, she asked nervously,”ruofei, then ... Did you tell her what happened between us?”

Xia ruofei raised his head and looked at Ling Qingxue with a questioning gaze.

Ling Qingxue quickly wrote a few words on it and showed it to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei took a look and saw that it said,”I didn’t agree. You’ve decided to leave me and be with her!”

Xia ruofei’s eyes widened and he looked at Ling Qingxue in shock.

Ling Qingxue quickly gave Xia ruofei a look and glared at him at the same time.

On the other end of the video call, Song Wei had already noticed that something was wrong with Xia ruofei. She could not help but ask,””RUO Fei, what’s wrong? Why are you in a daze?”

Xia ruofei quickly replied,”oh, oh, oh! It’s fine, it’s fine ... I just saw a whale spraying water in the distance. It’s the first time I’ve seen something like this. By the way ... What did you just say?”

Although Song Wei wanted to see the whale as well, she was more concerned about their relationship. So, she quickly asked again,””I asked you if you told Qingxue about us.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but look at Ling Qingxue again. Then, he said helplessly,””I ... Told her after I finished cultivating ... Her reaction was stronger and more agitated, and she also expressed that she was determined not to agree to such a ridiculous thing ...”

“Ah?” Song Wei was disappointed again. She bit her lower lip and asked,”why?” Did you not make yourself clear? Qingxue has experienced what it’s like to cultivate a spirit body together, so she should be able to understand us ...”

“I’ve made it very clear to her!” Xia ruofei looked at Ling Qingxue and said,”I’ve explained the entire incident in detail, but she didn’t agree!”

Song Wei let out a long sigh and said,”Ruofei, it seems that I’ve thought too simply of this matter ... I’m sorry! It’s all my bad idea, but you didn’t get it done, and instead, you’re facing a difficult situation ... It’s all my fault ...”

Although Xia ruofei’s heart ached when he saw Song Wei’s sad look, he was secretly relieved after hearing her words. It proved that he was not lying. Song Wei was the one who suggested this.

He couldn’t help but look at Ling Qingxue, meaning: I didn’t lie to you!

Ling Qingxue glared at Xia ruofei and pointed at the paper. Then, she made a hand gesture to Xia ruofei to grab it.

Xia ruofei saw that Ling Qingxue’s finger was pointing at the words ‘decided to leave me and be with her’.

Only then did he realize that he had not conveyed the message that she wanted to tell Song Wei, and that had made her angry.

Xia ruofei quickly said,”Weiwei, don’t blame yourself ... I’ve already decided. Since Qingxue is so determined, it seems that this matter is over. We can only blame it on our fate!” I’ll leave her and choose to be with you ...”

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but carefully walk to the blind spot behind Xia ruofei. She wanted to see how Song Wei would react when she heard the news.

To Ling Qingxue’s surprise, Song Wei didn’t show any signs of joy. On the contrary, after hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Song Wei’s expression changed and she said excitedly,””RUO Fei! What are you saying? You and Qingxue are a match made in heaven! You’ve known each other since junior high school. Was it easy for you to come this far? It’s not your style to give up just like that!”

Xia ruofei felt helpless. However, Ling Qingxue had already given him this setting. In order to avoid further dissatisfaction from Ling Qingxue, he could only act according to this setting. He could not take the initiative to reveal any flaws and let Song Wei find out. Otherwise, he believed that Ling Qingxue would really do as she said and ignore him forever.

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and said,”this isn’t a matter of whether I want to give up or not!” Wei Wei, it’s Qingxue who’s not willing to forgive me. She wants to break up with me! I can’t hold her back and not let her go! That’s just how she is. Once she has made up her mind, no one can shake her decision ...”

Xia ruofei paused and continued,””So ... You don’t have to talk about this anymore. Let’s just forget about Qingxue’s story ...”

“I don’t agree!” Song Wei said agitatedly,”ruofei, if you leave Qingxue, I will never forgive myself for the rest of my life. I will live in guilt for the rest of my life. There will always be a voice reminding me that I am a dishonorable third party! You two were childhood sweethearts, and then you fell in love with each other. How can you break up just like that?”

Xia ruofei could not help but glance at Ling Qingxue from the corner of his eyes.

He could clearly see the tears in Song Wei’s eyes in the video. It was all because of Ling Qingxue’s settings.

On the other side, Song Wei only paused for a moment before she took a deep breath. Her eyes revealed a determined look and said,””RUO Fei, I’ve thought it through. Since Qingxue can’t accept me, then ... I’m the one who should leave! You two are a match made in heaven, and I only entered your life because of an accident! I’m the one who should leave ...”

As Song Wei spoke, her tears fell uncontrollably. She looked like a Pear Blossom in the rain, and anyone who saw her would pity her.

She was still sobbing as she said,”ruofei, I hope to have the chance to explain to Qingxue face to face. If she’s not willing to see me, then forget it.” In short ... I won’t contact you again, and I hope you don’t come looking for me again! Quickly go and coax Qingxue back! Put all the blame on me, and tell her that you will never look for me or contact me again. Try to get her forgiveness!”

Xia ruofei’s heart ached for Song Wei.

Ling Qingxue, who was standing in the blind spot behind Xia ruofei, looked at the pitiful Song Wei on her phone screen and her heart softened.

Ling Qingxue’s heart trembled when she heard Song Wei’s words.

She was the most familiar with the intense attraction and pleasure that came from the soul after the soul and body combined cultivation. She knew that Song Wei had the same experience.

Under such circumstances, it was definitely not an easy decision to leave Xia ruofei. It must have been a very difficult decision!

When Ling Qingxue saw this scene, her mind was filled with a myriad of thoughts.

Just as Song Wei was about to hang up the video call with tears streaming down her face, Ling Qingxue suddenly stood beside Xia ruofei and said loudly,””Song Wei, why are you so stupid! What’s so good about Xia ruofei that you’re willing to sacrifice so much for him? In my opinion, we should both ignore him and let this greedy man go alone!”
