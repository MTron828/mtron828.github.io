3025 Master Yuntai (2)

Bai Qingqing nodded and said,”I believe in boss!” Then ... What exactly was hidden inside? He actually hid it so deeply!”

The nested space itself was hidden in the storage ring, which was very well hidden. Ordinary cultivators could not detect the existence of the nested space at all.

This spatial stone, on the other hand, was disguised as a spiritual stone and buried in a small mountain of hundreds of thousands of spiritual stones, then hidden in the nested space.

This was simply hiding to the extreme.

So, what was stored in such a well – hidden space Stone?

Xia ruofei said,”we can only know after we open it. I’ve said it before. I can’t see everything inside the spatial stone!”

Bai Qingqing nodded and asked,””Boss, what method are you going to use to open this spatial rock? The method you used to crack the nested space just now was simply a stroke of genius. It pointed straight to the origin of space!”

From Bai Qingqing’s point of view, the structure and rules of the spatial rock were very primitive, and the difficulty of cracking it was much lower than that of the nested space. Even if it made it itself, it would not be difficult.

However, the more she thought about it, the more Bai Qingqing was looking forward to seeing if Xia ruofei would use any ingenious methods to crack it.

This was like the simpler the dish, the more it tested one’s culinary skills.

The logic was the same.

Almost everyone knew how to cook egg – fried rice, but there was a huge difference between cooking by a star chef and cooking by an ordinary person.

To be able to make a taste that ordinary people couldn’t make with simple ingredients, that was what skill was.

Xia ruofei looked at Bai Qingqing, whose eyes were filled with anticipation, and smiled.””There’s no need to be so complicated. Isn’t there an early warning array on this Space Stone? Can’t you just trigger it?”

“Ah?” Bai Qingqing’s eyes were wide open, and she looked incredulous.

Bai Qingqing could think of several ways to crack this spatial stone, and it was not difficult for her to perfectly avoid the warning array.

In that case, why would Xia ruofei, who was more skilled in spatial manipulation than Bai Qingqing, use such a simple and crude method?

After Bai Qingqing came back to her senses, she quickly said,””Boss, don’t make a rash decision! We don’t even know what will happen after the alarm array is triggered! What if it really is a big explosion?”

“Xiao Bai, don’t forget where we are ...” Xia ruofei said confidently,”we’re in the spirit map space, there’s no need to be afraid of a big explosion. ”

With Xia ruofei’s current level of control over the spirit map space, even if there was some danger hidden in this small space Stone, he could absolutely imprison it in the spirit map space. There was no need to worry at all.

Bai Qingqing had obviously thought this through. She nodded and said,””That’s true! But ... We clearly have a better idea, and we don’t have to take any risks ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Xiao Bai, since this ancient cultivator, Grand cloud, left behind such a small mechanism, he must have his own intentions.” In any case, we don’t have to worry about safety in the spirit map space, and I’ve already kept all the cultivation resources. We can be said to have no worries. Since that was the case, why not choose to fulfill her wish? Let’s see what this Yuntai senior originally wanted to do, isn’t that good?”

Bai Qingqing didn’t agree with Xia ruofei’s strange thinking. She felt that he was asking for trouble.

However, on this matter, it was only a spectator and had no say. Since Xia ruofei had already decided, what else could it say?

So, Bai Qingqing said gloomily,””Alright then! Who asked you to be more powerful than me? You’re right ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”then let’s start!” ‘Little white, although it’s not dangerous, it’s just a precaution!’ You’d better hide further away!”

Hearing this, Bai Qingqing immediately retreated a dozen meters away.

After listening to Xia ruofei’s analysis, it also felt that the space rock was not dangerous. However, who could say for sure what had happened to the ancient cultivators? What if this cultivator of the cloud platform had such a bad taste and deliberately let the junior who got the nested space see a huge amount of cultivation resources first, and then destroy them all?

Therefore, safety was the most important.

If it wasn’t for her curiosity about what was hidden in the spatial rock, Bai Qingqing wouldn’t even want to join in the fun. She would rather stay as far away as possible!

But it really couldn’t hold back its curiosity!

Xia ruofei laughed as he placed the spatial stone that was disguised as a spiritual stone on the grass. Then, he took three steps back and waved his hand. A wave of vital Qi was sent towards the spatial stone.

Bai Qingqing’s eyelids twitched. It was indeed simple and brutal!

It could see that after Xia ruofei’s vital Qi was released, it was immediately divided into several streams and then accurately blasted at the nodes on the spatial rock.

In this way, the warning array of the space Stone would definitely be triggered.

In fact, one could also activate the formation with spiritual power.

However, Xia ruofei chose a simpler and crueler method. He used his vital Qi to bombard it. Not only would the warning array be triggered, but the spatial stone would also be destroyed.

Bai Qingqing could tell that Xia ruofei had not held back at all.

Bai Qingqing didn’t have time to complain. She stared at the space Stone, afraid to miss a single detail.

Of course, Xia ruofei was also focused on the spatial rock.

Although he said it casually, he didn’t dare to take it lightly. He had already mobilized the invisible spatial force. If the spatial stone disguised as a spirit stone showed any abnormalities, he would immediately imprison it.

When the yuan Qi touched a few nodes on the surface of the space Stone, the space Stone seemed to light up slightly.

Then, under the effect of the yuan Qi, the spatial stone made a cracking sound and a few cracks appeared on the surface. The stable space inside could not be maintained for long.

At the same time, a faint shadow floated out of the spatial stone and quickly condensed into the image of an old scholar in an ancient costume.

As soon as the old scholar appeared, he raised his head and laughed,””Wahahaha ...”

However, his laughter only lasted for less than a second. It was as if someone had grabbed his throat, and his laughter naturally stopped.

The old scholar looked around with a confused expression. Then, he looked at Xia ruofei, who was dressed in modern clothes.

“Little kid, where is this?” he asked.

“Senior, where do you think we are?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

The apparition of the old man dressed as a scholar looked around and muttered to himself,””The spiritual Qi here is so dense! When did such a treasure land appear in the cultivation world?”

Then, the old scholar saw the space Stone on the grass that had been split into several pieces, and his expression changed slightly.

He turned to Xia ruofei and said,””Little child, you must have obtained my storage ring, right? Did you take out everything from the hidden space? It didn’t touch the spatial rock?” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Xia ruofei nodded and asked with a smile,””So, you are senior Yuntai?”

“Wahaha! I didn’t expect a little kid like you to have heard of this old man’s name!” The old scholar said with a proud smile.

...

Then, the illusory figure of scholar Yuntai couldn’t help but ask,””Little kid, you’re only at the early Aurous core stage, how did you do it?”

“Do what?” Xia ruofei asked in confusion.

The illusory figure of scholar Yuntai pointed to the space Stone fragment on the ground and said,””Without touching the space Stone, we can directly open the hidden space! This old master believes that this arrangement is quite exquisite. Unless it’s one of those old geezers in the cultivation world who personally made a move, how could it bypass this old master’s early warning array?”
