Chapter 1917 Going all out (2)

The two of them looked at each other. It was indeed Da Liu’s phone number.

“I hope you’re not lying to me, or else ...” The man on the right said.

After that, he looked at Liu Dong deeply, then pushed the door open and walked into the private room.

The soundproofing of the private room was very good, and it was not as noisy as the outside at all. Soft music was playing here, and expensive red wine was placed on the coffee table. Da Liu and several of his subordinates were sitting on the sofa with their legs crossed, drinking and chatting. There were two enchanting women sitting beside each of them.

The big man went straight to Da Liu’s side, bent down, and whispered in Da Liu’s ear,””Da, there’s someone outside looking for you. He says his name is Liu Dong, and he’s your relative ...”

A strange look appeared on Da Liu’s face as he said to himself,””Uncle Dong?”

Da Liu and Dong Liu were about the same age, and they had a good relationship when they were young. Although they were a generation apart, they were basically of the same generation. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

However, after Liu Dong got into university, and Liu Da came to San Shan to work, the two gradually lost contact.

After that, Liu Dong was admitted to the Sanshan Environmental Protection Bureau, and Da Liu had made his own name. They were in the same city, so they kept in touch more often than before.

However, the two had very different personalities. Liu Dong was an honest family man, while Da Liu had been through so many years of fighting and killing, so he had an unruly temperament. The two of them naturally did not have much in common.

In fact, when Liu Dong was invited to the night bar with Da Liu, he felt out of place. Later on, Da Liu invited him out to drink and sing a few times, but he declined.

Da Liu didn’t expect Liu Dong to come to him. He thought for a while and said,””Invite him in!”

The burly man heaved a sigh of relief. He was afraid that Liu Dong was bluffing. If Liu Da did not know this ‘relative’, then he would be in trouble.

“Yes, sir!” The burly man quickly replied in a low voice.

Then, he bowed slightly and quickly left the private room.

“Brother da wants you to go in!” The burly man said as he looked at Liu Dong and stepped aside.

“Thank you!” Liu Dong said quickly as he pushed the door open and walked into the private room.

Da Liu saw that it was really Liu Dong, so he stood up and greeted him with a smile,””Uncle Dong! What wind blew you here? Why didn’t you call me in advance? I can send someone to pick you up!”

Liu Dong seemed to be a little absent – minded. He looked at Da Liu and asked,””Xiao da, where did you find out about Chenchen’s matter?”

“What are you talking about, uncle Dong?” asked Liu Da, confused.

“You don’t know?” asked Liu Dong with his eyes wide open.

Da Liu laughed and said,”what’s wrong with my little aunt?” I knew that she’s been appearing on screen a lot recently, and she’s already a popular person on the City Channel! Are you talking about this?”

Liu Dong’s face changed. The mysterious man who had sent him the photo had given him a very strong hint that this was Da Liu’s idea, and that was why he had rushed over in a hurry.

However, from Da Liu’s expression, it was clear that he had no idea that Fang Chenchen had cheated on him.

Liu Dong’s mind raced. Since Liu Da didn’t know, he couldn’t tell him. Although he had been cuckolded, at least the scandal wouldn’t spread to the clan. It was a blessing in disguise!

“Oh ... It’s nothing ... It’s nothing ... I made a mistake ...” Liu Dong quickly said.

Having been in the underworld for so many years, how could Da Liu be bad at observing people? The anxiety was written all over Liu Dong’s face, and he didn’t know how to hide his emotions at all. Da Liu could tell at a glance.

He looked into Liu Dong’s eyes and said,””Uncle Dong, you can’t write two” Liu “in one stroke, not to mention that we are relatives of the same clan. If you have any difficulties, you must not hide it from me ... Tell me, what happened to little aunt? Was someone bullying her? Tell me a name, and I’ll bring some people to beat the sh * t out of him!”

Liu Dong avoided his eyes and said,”da, it’s really nothing ... Chenchen is fine!” The leaders in the unit think highly of her now ...”

Just as Liu Dong was about to give up, his phone rang.

Liu Dong picked up the phone in a panic. It was that familiar number again, and his heart skipped a beat.

He looked at Da Liu, walked to the side with the phone, and pressed the answer button.

“What do you want?” “Liu Da doesn’t even know about this,” Liu Dong said in a low voice.”What are you up to, luring me here?”

In the rented house, Xu Yougang was listening to the live audio signal sent back by Wang Chong with his earphones. At the same time, Liu Dong’s voice was on speaker mode on his phone.

Because the signal in the earpiece was transmitted over the network, there would be a delay of one to two seconds, which sounded a little strange.

Xu Yougang quickly typed a line of words on another computer. Soon, a mechanical male synthetic voice came out of the speaker connected to this computer. Xu Yougang put the phone close to the speaker.

This was the electronic voice that Liu Dong had heard in the private room of the night bar.

“Does it make a difference whether Liu Da knows about this or not?” The cold, mechanical voice said at a constant speed,”you’re not so naive as to think that we can’t find Da Liu’s mobile number, are you? Is it that hard to send him a few photos or even a few videos?”
