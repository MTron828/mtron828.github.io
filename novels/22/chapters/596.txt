Chapter 597: The purple red Dragon (3)

When Xie Xun said this, even yang Dahua and Ling Xiaotian were tempted.

No one was short of money. This Blood Red Dragon was extremely rare to begin with. In addition, it had a layer of purple hair color, making it even more difficult to come by. Even Ling Xiaotian couldn’t help but want to snatch it away from him.

“Don’t even think about it!”Li Zongheng quickly said. You’ve already bought the fish, so don’t even think about eating the fish in the bowl and thinking about the fish in the pot! Also, old Ling, don’t join in the fun. You’re the host today, so you have to act like one. Don’t fight with us!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,””Uncle Ling, please don’t participate ... Also, Mr. Xie, Mr. Yang, since we’ve agreed that each person can only buy one pair, let’s follow the rules of the game!”

Li Zongheng immediately said proudly,”this Arowana is Xiao Xia ‘s, we’ll all listen to him!” I say, Xie laosan, old Yang, it’s your own fault for having bad taste. You can’t blame me for that ...”

At this moment, Xu Desheng suddenly said,””I haven’t bought it before, so I can also participate in the bidding!”

“Didn’t you already quit?”li Zongheng asked, stunned.

“If it’s the same pair of blood red Dragons as the previous two, I’ll definitely back out at eight or nine million!” Xu Desheng smiled and said,”but isn’t this a purple red Dragon? I might have to fight with you guys for it!”

Xu Desheng didn’t wait for li Zongheng and Guo Qinglin to speak and announced the price first,””I’ll round it up to 10 million!”

Then, Xu Desheng asked Xia ruofei with a smile,””Little Xia, I don’t think I’m breaking the rules, right?”

The more intense their competition was, the happier Xia ruofei was. Hence, he immediately smiled and said,””It doesn’t count, it doesn’t count. You can bid!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Li Zongheng and Guo Qinglin had no choice but to accept this reality.

However, they were not going to be conservative with the price. Li Zongheng pondered for a moment before saying,”Eleven million!”

......

” 12 million!” Guo Qinglin followed up with an even higher bid.

Now, they were all raising the price by one million, and the pair of Red Arowana reached an average price of six million each, breaking the previous record of five million Yuan.

” 13 million!” Xu Desheng said after some thought.

Li Zongheng smiled and said,”I’ll round it up again!” 15 million!”

Xia ruofei’s heart shook as he watched from the side. It was just two fish, but they had already bid 15 million!

Both Guo Qinglin and Xu Desheng looked serious. It was obvious that this was close to the highest price they had in mind.

“15.5 million. I don’t want any higher ...” Xu Desheng said after a long time of consideration.

Guo Qinglin furrowed his brows and looked at li Zongheng before saying,” 16 million!”

Xu Desheng smiled bitterly. He looked at the Arowana in the plastic box reluctantly, then shook his head and stepped aside.

Li Zongheng gritted his teeth and said,”elder Guo, I bid 17 million!” You’re a senior, if you can offer a higher price, I can only bear to part with it ...”

“Thank you, boss li!” Guo Qinglin smiled.

Then, he looked at Xia ruofei with clear eyes and said,””Little Xia, I’ll make up an auspicious number! 18.88 million!”

Xia ruofei looked at li Zongheng and Xu Desheng, who were still qualified to bid. Seeing that they had no intention to continue bidding, he smiled and nodded.”Deal! Congratulations, old Guo, for finally getting your wish!”
