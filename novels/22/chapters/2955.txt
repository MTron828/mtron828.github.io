2956 A gathering of heroes (1)

As there was more time, Xia ruofei did not use the array flags and started to work in the spirit map space.

When he left the spirit map space and returned to the outside world, it was almost noon.

Xia ruofei had been hiding in his room the entire morning. Luo Qingfeng and Li Yifu did not dare to come and disturb him. In order to avoid any complications, Luo Qingfeng had gone to see Shao Qingyang in the morning. After submitting his item, he had returned to his room and did not interact much with his fellow cultivators.

Actually, the purpose of submitting the item was to let Shao Qingyang have a preliminary appraisal of it before Luo Qingfeng kept it away. He just had to hand the item over to the person hosting the auction before the auction started. This included the items in the auction manual. After all, the treasures were precious. Even if the auction had been going on for many years, the fallen leaves sect would not dare to cheat, but everyone was still more cautious.

When Shao Qingyang saw the three items that Luo Qingfeng had put up for auction, he couldn’t help but feel a wave of emotions in his heart.

In terms of preciousness, the items Qingfeng Luo submitted were not the best, but they were very practical. Especially in the worsening environment of the cultivation world, these three items were especially precious.

Shao Qingyang could imagine how popular these three items would be at the auction. Even he himself was drooling over the Qi – gathering pill and the spirit – gathering formation, and the idea of bidding for them came to mind.

Of course, Shao Qingyang naturally welcomed this. The more good things there were in the auction, the greater the influence. This was naturally a good thing for the falling leaves sect. Apart from gaining fame, the work of the auction was not in vain. For every item, the falling leaves sect would receive a 5% commission.

Naturally, the more good things that he had, the better.

As such, Shao Qingyang readily agreed to all of Luo Qingfeng’s requests, and everyone came to an agreement in a happy and friendly atmosphere.

Since Xia ruofei had been staying in his room, Luo Qingfeng and Li Yifu did not dare to disturb him. Therefore, Luo Qingfeng simply stayed in his room and guided Li Yifu in his cultivation.

Of course, in order to prevent ears from eavesdropping, Qingfeng Luo and Yifu li addressed each other as brothers.

However, there was no order in learning, and the one who had achieved it came first. It was not unusual for Luo Qingfeng, a Junior Brother in the Golden core stage, to guide Li Yifu in his cultivation. This was also a very common thing in the cultivation world.

As an Aurous core stage cultivator, Qingfeng Luo was naturally qualified to guide Li Yifu in his cultivation. He could also answer many of Li Yifu’s questions.

However, Li Yifu, who had also received Xia ruofei’s guidance, could clearly feel that his senior granduncle’s guidance was more profound and simple. A few simple words could point to the great Dao, making him feel enlightened every time. In comparison, although Luo Qingfeng’s cultivation was profound and his guidance on cultivation could benefit him greatly, he still seemed to be inferior to Xia ruofei.

However, no matter what, the Enlightenment of a golden core cultivator was enough for a Qi refining cultivator like Li Yifu to learn. Therefore, he was still very humble and humbly asked for Luo Qingfeng’s advice.

After Xia ruofei left the spirit map space, he raised his hand to look at his watch and then put away all the barriers in the room.

He walked out of the room and came to the door of Luo Qingfeng’s room at the other end of the corridor. He raised his hand and knocked on the door.

Luo Qingfeng quickly got up and opened the door. When he saw Xia ruofei, he subconsciously wanted to bow and greet him, but Xia ruofei raised his hand to stop him.

“Let’s talk inside!”Xia ruofei said.

After entering the room, Xia ruofei set up a soundproof barrier and asked with a smile,””You didn’t go out this morning?”

“Master,” Luo Qingfeng said respectfully.”Senior li and I have been in the room the whole time. We were exchanging our experiences in cultivation this morning.” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Senior granduncle, it’s actually sect leader Luo who is guiding the disciples in their cultivation,” Li Yifu quickly said.

Originally, Li Yifu and Xia ruofei would call him “Qingfeng”. However, after receiving his guidance today, it was not appropriate for him to call him that anymore. After all, even if he was Xia ruofei’s servant, he was still an Aurous core cultivator and the sect leader of the star Seizer sect.

In contrast,”sect leader Luo” was not a respectful title, but it was more polite, so Li Yifu naturally changed to this title.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Qingfeng, please give your husband some advice when you have time. Although his cultivation level is low now, his Foundation is very solid. As long as he has enough cultivation resources, he will be able to make great progress.”

“Master is right!” Luo Qingfeng said,”senior Li’s Foundation is indeed very solid. This will be very helpful for his future cultivation.”

Xia ruofei smiled.”I’m not looking for you guys for anything. It’s almost time for lunch. How about we order a meal?”

There were many cultivators in the Grand Duke Hotel. If it was not necessary, Xia ruofei did not want to have too much contact with them. Before the auction started, he wanted to reduce the number of times he showed his face in public.

“I’ll do as you say!” “Yes!” Qingfeng Luo said respectfully.

“Good! Foster husband, call the front desk to send three sets of lunch over!” Xia ruofei said,”just bring it to Qingfeng’s room. We’ll eat together today!”

“Yes! Senior granduncle!” Li Yifu quickly said.
