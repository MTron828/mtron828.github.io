“Who ... Who are you?” Fang Luo asked with much effort.

Xia ruofei pointed at Lu You on the bed expressionlessly and asked,””Do you know who she is?”

Fang Luo’s mouth twitched, and a lot of blood flowed out again. However, he did not care at all and chuckled.”A woman ... And ... A top ... Top beauty ...”

“Scumbag!” Xia ruofei coldly spat out these two words.

Fang Luo started to laugh, and it became more and more hysterical. As he laughed, he started to cough violently, and blood kept coming out of his mouth.

“You don’t have to say anything ... I know ... You must be this girl’s friend ...” Fang Luo said.

Xia ruofei looked at Fang Luo quietly without saying a word.

“You don’t have to look at me like that,” Fang Luo continued.”I ... I haven’t had the chance to touch her yet ...”

“So?” Xia ruofei asked coldly.

“So ... We ... Actually ... Don’t have any irreconcilable hatred ...” Fang Luo said with much difficulty,”if you let me go, maybe ... We can still ... Be friends! The name of Master Luo in the southern city ... You should have heard of it ... That’s me!”

“Friend?” Xia ruofei’s lips curled into a mocking smile.

“Yeah ... You’ll know the benefits of being my friend in the future ...” Fang Luo said nonchalantly,”I know you’re good at fighting, but most of the time ... Fighting skills are useless ... A few of my men are better at fighting than me, but I ... I’m still ... Their boss, right? Brother ... Leave a way out, and we’ll be on good terms in the future ... If you go too far today ... Our Iron Fist club will definitely make you pay a painful price ...”

Fang Luo’s breathing became smoother as he spoke. Although he was still lying on the ground like a dead dog, his tone was more confident.

However, when he spoke, the viciousness in his eyes did not escape Xia ruofei’s eyes.

Xia ruofei picked his nose and asked,””What if I don’t want to?”

Fang Luo laughed and said,””Young man, don’t be too impulsive. You’ve already vented your anger ... Don’t tell me you still dare to kill me?”

Xia ruofei’s expressionless face gradually revealed a harmless smile. If anyone who knew him saw this scene, they would immediately know that Xia ruofei had a strong killing intent in his heart.

Fang Luo, however, did not notice it at all. He smiled and said,””That’s right, he who understands the times should act ...”

“It’s true that I don’t dare to kill you directly ...” Xia ruofei interrupted Fang Luo and said calmly,”but ...”

At this point, Xia ruofei suddenly raised his foot without warning and stomped down hard.

Crack! Crack! Two terrifying sounds were heard. Fang Luo, who was caught off guard, let out a heart – wrenching scream. Xia ruofei had just crushed his knees.

This time, Xia ruofei did not hold back. Fang Luo’s weak kneecaps were crushed under his heavy stomping. His legs were bent at a strange angle.

Even a ruthless person like Fang Luo couldn’t help but lose his mind and soul when he saw his leg in such a terrible state. The bone – piercing pain almost drove him crazy.

Xia ruofei had no intention of letting Fang Luo off the moment he saw how fragile Lu You was.

Even if he couldn’t kill him directly, he would cripple him and make him suffer like hell.

Fang Luo’s screams lasted for a while before they gradually stopped.

He panted heavily and stared at Xia ruofei. The muscles on his face trembled in pain but he still forced a smile that was uglier than crying and said,””You ... You’ve got guts! Come on! Again ... Again ... It’d be best ... It’d be best if you could kill me ... Ha ... Haha ...”

“As you wish,” Xia ruofei said expressionlessly.

Then, he looked around the room and happened to see the empty wine bottle on the bedside table. The wine in the bottle had all been poured into Lu You’s stomach.

Xia ruofei picked up the wine bottle and held the thinner part of the top. He weighed it in his hand and walked to Fang Luo. He squatted down and slowly pulled Fang Luo’s hand that was pierced by the dagger. Then, he raised the wine bottle and smashed it down.

“Ah ...” Fang Luo could not help but let out a terrible roar again.

Xia ruofei didn’t even blink. Once, twice, thrice ... Every time, it was very precise. The interval was exactly the same, just like an automatic machine.

Soon, all five of Fang Luo’s fingers had been smashed into a bloody mess. All the bones had been shattered, and his fingers were as thin as a piece of paper, lying on the ground.

Then, Xia ruofei slowly pulled Fang Luo’s other hand.

An ordinary person would have fainted under such pain. However, Fang Luo was always conscious, perhaps due to his special physique. At this moment, he would rather have a weaker tolerance than faint. This kind of heart – piercing pain made him wish he could die immediately.

In Fang Luo’s eyes, Xia ruofei was like a demon, even scarier than a demon.

“Kill ... Kill ... Kill me ... Just kill me ...” Fang Luo’s bloodless lips trembled as he spoke.

Xia ruofei was still expressionless. He slowly raised the wine bottle that was already stained with blood.
