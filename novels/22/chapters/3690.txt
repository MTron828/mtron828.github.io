They clearly felt that it was difficult for them to understand the content of Chen Nanfeng’s lecture.

These golden core cultivators couldn’t help but be secretly shocked. It seemed that Chen Nanfeng had really left them far behind.

Chen Nanfeng’s understanding of Dao was naturally formed over the years. It would not change in quality just because he had broken through to the nascent Soul Stage.

Therefore, even before his breakthrough, Chen Nanfeng’s understanding of Dao had clearly surpassed these golden core cultivators by a large margin.

Xia ruofei was still immersed in Chen Nanfeng’s explanation and was constantly comparing it with his own understanding. He listened with great interest.

Chen Nanfeng had a panoramic view of everything on the grandstand, so he was actually observing everyone’s situation when he gave his lecture.

Xia ruofei’s eyebrows were dancing with joy, and he was deep in thought. Chen Nanfeng also saw this scene.

He couldn’t help but sigh inwardly,”fellow Daoist Xia is indeed astonishingly talented. The content is already very in – depth, but he can still understand it. Moreover, it seems that he has gained a lot from it!”

Chen Nanfeng then thought of the fact that even he could not see through Xia ruofei’s cultivation. It was clear that Xia ruofei’s spiritual power was much higher than his actual cultivation. This made Xia ruofei even more mysterious in Chen Nanfeng’s mind.

Of course, Chen Nanfeng was also multitasking right now. He didn’t stop explaining.

On the grandstand, as Xia ruofei listened, he seemed to have understood something. He could not help but sit cross – legged on his seat, take out a crystal, and start to cultivate the “great Dao Sutra”.

He usually used purple origin crystals when he cultivated, but today, he was in public. He had to keep a top – tier cultivation resource like purple origin crystals a secret. Otherwise, even the first heaven sect might covet it.

Chen Nanfeng had also noticed Xia ruofei’s actions. Although he did not show any change in expression, he was actually quite shocked.

It was obvious that Xia ruofei had gained a lot and resonated with them. That was why he started to cultivate in public. His purpose was naturally to grab hold of that fleeting inspiration.

Even Chen Nanfeng could not help but envy Xia ruofei’s talent.

He didn’t stop his lecture. Instead, he explained his understanding of the heavenly Dao in a very calm tone. He didn’t care if the cultivators on the grandstand could understand him. His attention was mainly focused on Xia ruofei.

Unknowingly, Chen Nanfeng’s lecture had ended.

At this moment, everyone suddenly realized that the sky had already darkened.

An entire day had passed without him realizing it.

Even though some cultivators had long since lost the ability to understand Chen Nanfeng’s words, his voice seemed to have a magical power. His tone and tone seemed ordinary and gentle, but when combined together, it made people involuntarily listen.

Even until the end of the lecture, everyone still had a feeling of wanting more.

At this time, Chen Nanfeng said,”fellow Daoists, please remain silent. Don’t disturb nephew Xia’s cultivation.” Fellow Daoist mu, fellow Daoist Liu, I’ll have to trouble the two of you to protect nephew Xia.”

At this moment, everyone realized that Xia ruofei was sitting upright on the high grandstand. He was cultivating wholeheartedly and holding an extremely precious origin crystal in his hand.

Naturally, Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha were not too affected by Chen Nanfeng’s voice, so they had already noticed that Xia ruofei was cultivating. Their hearts were filled with envy.

Without a doubt, Xia ruofei had gained the most from today’s lecture.

The two of them didn’t dare to hesitate and quickly nodded.””Alright!”

The two golden core cultivators stood guard on both sides of Xia ruofei. The other cultivators on the grandstand naturally did not dare to act rashly. They did not even dare to breathe loudly, afraid that they would disturb Xia ruofei’s cultivation.

Naturally, the crowd could not leave immediately. Everyone turned back to look at Xia ruofei, who was cultivating on the highest grandstand.

Xia ruofei had entered a state of complete oblivion. He did not know that his spontaneous cultivation was being watched by all the cultivators.

On the grandstand below, Lu You looked at Xia ruofei, who was sitting cross – legged and cultivating with his eyes closed. He felt that Xia ruofei was really radiant at this moment, even more dazzling than Chen Nanfeng, who was on the high platform on the cliff.

Chen Nanfeng smiled and said,”I still have to continue consolidating my cultivation. 1’11 take my leave.” Tomorrow morning, fellow Daoists, please come to the Empyrean one Pavilion. I’ll give you an opportunity, and as for how much you can gain, it will depend on your luck!”

With that, Chen Nanfeng flicked his wide sleeves and jumped up. He flew up to the cliff and disappeared from everyone’s sight.

Chen Xuan, on the other hand, did not leave. Instead, he summoned his flying sword and landed on the highest grandstand.

Under everyone’s watchful eyes, Chen Xuan walked behind Xia ruofei and sat down cross – legged.

Everyone was dumbfounded. It was obvious that Chen Xuan was protecting Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei had only gained some enlightenment after listening to the Dao lecture! So he started to cultivate at the last minute! However, he had three golden core cultivators protecting him at the same time. Two of them were leaders of first – Class sects, and the other one was the young leader of the first heaven society! This lineup was not even comparable to a golden core breaking through! Nascent soul! Without a doubt, Xia ruofei had gained the most from today’s lecture.

The two of them didn’t dare to hesitate and quickly nodded.””Alright!”

The two golden core cultivators stood guard on both sides of Xia ruofei. The other cultivators on the grandstand naturally did not dare to act rashly. They did not even dare to breathe loudly, afraid that they would disturb Xia ruofei’s cultivation.
