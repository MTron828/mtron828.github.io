Zheng Yongshou smiled slightly, giving off the feeling of a master from beyond the world,””I’m sure we’ve already walked out of the trap array’s range. The magnetic field in the array earlier was obviously more chaotic, but look, it’s back to normal now!”

After Zheng Yongshou finished speaking, he showed the compass in his hand to Wang Boshan.

How could Wang Boshan understand it! However, he knew that Zheng Yongshou was one of the star Seizer sect’s top formation experts. Since Zheng Yongshou had said so, there should be no problem.

Wang Boshan was overjoyed and quickly flattered,””Fortunately, martial uncle Zheng is here. Otherwise, we would be in real trouble ...”

“Uncle sect leader sent me here to deal with this kind of situation.” Zheng Yongshou said indifferently,”we’ve already wasted a lot of time just now. Let’s hurry up and work!”

“Yes! Junior uncle Zheng!” Wang Boshan replied excitedly.

Zheng Yongshou put away the compass, identified the direction, and then said,””This way!”

In a flash, the two of them headed quickly in the direction of the airport warehouse. According to the information provided by benilatti, Xia ruofei and his subordinates were all near the airport warehouse. To catch the bandits, one had to first catch the leader. To control Peach Garden Island, the most important thing was to capture Xia ruofei.

Moreover, bainilatti was also at the airport warehouse. They also needed to find bainilatti as soon as possible and let him be their guide.

Zheng Yongshou suddenly saw a figure flash in front of him while he was moving quickly, and he quickly stopped.

Wang Boshan did not know what was going on, so he naturally stopped as well.

“There’s someone in front!” Zheng Yongshou said in a low voice.

Wang Boshan squinted his eyes and tried his best to look forward, but he didn’t see anyone at all. However, he didn’t dare to raise any doubts. After all, Zheng Yongshou’s cultivation was much higher than his. Even if he couldn’t see it, it didn’t mean that martial uncle Zheng couldn ‘t.

Wang Boshan didn’t know that in Zheng Yongshou’s line of sight, that figure was standing five meters in front of them, with his back facing them.

Zheng Yongshou coldly snorted and said,””You’re acting like a ghost!”

The people on this Paradise Island were all ordinary people. Even if they discovered his whereabouts, it wouldn’t have much of an impact.

So, Zheng Yongshou relied on his seventh Qi layer cultivation and didn’t have too many scruples. He directly took advantage of the situation and hit the back of the figure with his palm.

Just as his hand was about to touch the other person’s body, the figure suddenly shifted a foot away, slowly turning around while dodging his attack.

A pale face appeared in front of Zheng Yongshou.

When Zheng Yongshou saw this face, his eyes suddenly became round and his face revealed an extremely shocked expression. His own face also became pale.

“Luo ... Luo ... Senior brother Luo ...” Zheng Yongshou’s teeth chattered uncontrollably, making a gurgling sound. He was obviously in a state of extreme fear.

He had never dreamed that he would meet his senior brother Luo, who had been dead for many years, on an island in the South Pacific Ocean, thousands of miles away from the sect.

Most importantly, Luo Wenxuan was the one who had pushed Luo Wenxuan off the cliff.

That year, when they went to pick herbs together, they were very lucky to find a 300 – year – old misty star grass on a cliff. In order to monopolize this spiritual grass that was enough for him to break through a small realm, Zheng Yongshou found an opportunity to seriously injure Luo Shixiong, who was completely unprepared for him, and pushed him off the cliff.

After returning to the sect, Zheng Yongshou also relied on this star Mist Grass and successfully broke through to refined Qi Level 7.

There was still blood on the corner of Luo Wenxuan’s mouth. He smiled at Zheng Yongshou and said,””Junior Brother Zheng, you’re really a good Junior Brother that I’ve taken extra care of ... Back then, you kicked my back, and it still hurts even now. Look, the footprint you left behind is still there ...”

After saying that, Luo Wenxuan slowly turned around.

The strange thing was that his face was still facing Zheng Yongshou, even when his back had completely turned, his face was still facing Zheng Yongshou, and he continued,””Junior Brother Zheng, do you still remember? When you first entered the sect, I was the one who brought you up the mountain. That day, I even lent you my clothes to wear ... Every time you were scared when you were on duty in the ancestral hall, I was always with you ... Is this how you repay me?”

The footprint on Luo Wenxuan’s back was very eye – catching, as if it was reminding Zheng Yongshou of the crime he had committed back then.

Zheng Yongshou’s soul was in a daze at this moment, and he shouted,””No! You’re not senior brother Luo! I’ve killed senior brother Luo with my own hands. How could he be here? Say ... Who are you? Who the hell are you? Why did he pretend to be senior brother Luo? You don’t want to say it? I’ll kill you! I’m going to kill you!”

Zheng Yongshou shouted crazily while hitting Luo Shixiong’s face, who had turned 180 degrees. He used his fiercest killing move at the beginning, not holding back at all.

However, Zheng Yongshou’s attacks seemed to have all fallen into the air. Even several times, his palm directly passed through Luo Shixiong’s body without any resistance.

Luo Wenxuan looked at Zheng Yongshou and said,””I’ve already been killed by you. How can you kill me again?”

“No! Get lost! Get lost!” Zheng Yongshou shouted hysterically,”‘get lost ...’

As he shouted, he attacked Luo Wenxuan crazily, not caring about the rapid consumption of his true Qi.

Wang Boshan was already stunned and did not have any reaction at all.

He only saw Zheng Yongshou suddenly hit the air with his palm, and then crazily attacked the empty space in front of him. This scene was extremely strange, and it made his heart tremble.

At this moment, Wang Boshan suddenly felt someone patting his shoulder. He screamed in shock and jumped up as if his tail had been stepped on.

Wang Boshan quickly turned his head around, his eyes immediately revealing extreme fear.

In front of him, there were five to six girls around the age of 14 to 15. Each of them was dressed in rags and their hair was disheveled. Some of them even had scars on their faces. They all had strange smiles on their faces as they looked at Wang Boshan in unison.

Wang Boshan sat on the ground, paralyzed. He kept moving backward, trying to get away from those girls.

“You ... You ... Don’t come near me ... I was wrong ... I shouldn’t have forced you ... Ah ...” He kept saying.

Before he could finish his sentence, he saw all the girls pouncing on him.

Wang Boshan’s soul was shattered and he fainted after letting out a blood – curdling scream.

……

Xia ruofei and Li Yifu were standing less than ten meters away from them, looking at them quietly.

In fact, from the moment Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou stepped onto Peach Blossom Island, they had never left Xia ruofei’s surveillance.

The last time they tested the formation, Xia ruofei and Li Yifu were both standing outside the attack range of the formation, so they could feel all kinds of strange phenomena.

Today, Xia ruofei had specially used the spirit gathering array to gather some spiritual energy in the Western area of the island, which made Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou more certain of their judgment.

Using Origin crystals to activate the formation was extremely fast, so the two of them didn’t notice any abnormalities at all and directly fell into the formation.

Moreover, the two of them weren’t trapped in the trap formation that Zheng Yongshou thought they were, but another even more terrifying formation, the misty illusory formation.

Therefore, Zheng Yongshou and Wang Boshan had already fallen into the illusion.

Xia ruofei and Li Yifu were not far away from them, watching them running in circles within a radius of more than ten meters.

Later on, Zheng Yongshou thought that he was breaking a trapping array and had even succeeded. In reality, this was all their own illusion.

...

It was only when they relaxed their minds that the inner demons in the illusory formation took advantage of the opportunity to enter and completely destroy their will.

Li Yifu revealed a shocked expression and said,””Martial granduncle, is this illusory formation so powerful? To be able to scare people like that ...”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Actually, I don’t know what the illusory formation has created. I only know that the illusory formation of the Taixu xuanqing formation can directly attack the things that people fear the most and are most unwilling to face. It can also infinitely magnify this fear.” It’s already beyond my expectations that Zheng Yongshou could last this long!”
