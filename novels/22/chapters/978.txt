Tian Mingyi sat on the sofa and glanced at manager Lu, waiting for him to come up and “report.”

Manager Lu came over with a polite smile and went straight to him. He even bowed slightly and his attitude was very respectful.

Tian Mingyi couldn’t help but be secretly proud,”these businessmen can’t be too polite to them, so what if they have some stinky money?” Everything had its weakness!

Just as Tian Mingyi was reveling in his own self – satisfaction, manager Lu bit the bullet and said,””Vice – Chancellor Tian, director Wu, I’m really sorry. We really can’t make any more private rooms available ...”

The smile on Tian Ming Yi’s face froze.

Director Wu was also furious. He pointed at manager Lu’s nose and said loudly,”Old Lu, F * cking say that again!”

Manager Lu’s heart couldn’t help but tremble. However, even Ling Xiaotian had given him clear instructions, so he could only endure it to the end.

The smile on manager Lu’s face became even more humble as he said,””Inspector Wu, we’re really trying our best to coordinate, but we really can’t make room for you. How about this ... The two leaders come visit us at another time, and I’ll make the decision to give you a free meal ...” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Manager Lu still didn’t want to offend these two’ kids ‘. After all, he was the manager of this private kitchen, and he would be in charge of the operations of the restaurant in the future. If trouble came knocking on his door every day, even if Ling Xiaotian didn’t blame him, he would also feel bad!

Tian Mingyi said eerily,”old Lu, do you think we’re here for free?” Do I owe you money for this meal or something?”

If it was a normal meal, it would be fine to change the restaurant, but Tian Mingyi was going to invite his boss’s boss, the leader of the city’s education Bureau. He had already informed him of the location, and now he was changing the venue at the last minute. Wasn’t that a slap in his own face?

“I wouldn’t dare ... Principal Tian, I ... I just wanted to express my sincerity ...” Manager Lu quickly said.

“Sincerity!” Tian Mingyi sneered,”this is your sincerity? Good! Very good! Old Lu, your Ling Ji dining hall is a big business, but you don’t respect me, a small vice – Principal!”

“Principal Tian, what are you saying! “How could we dare to look down on you ...” Manager Lu said quickly.

However, Tian Mingyi was already really angry. Even if manager Lu lowered his attitude, how could he calm down?

Tian Mingyi didn’t pay any attention to manager Lu and directly said to director Wu,””Brother Wu, there are a lot of problems with this private kitchen! The health Inspection Bureau had better perform their supervision duties well! I think we can organize some people to come over and check it out!”

Director Wu glanced at manager Lu and said with a sinister smile,””Principal Tian, I don’t think the health supervision office alone is enough. The safety supervision, Environmental Protection, and urban management departments should be there too! Why don’t we have a joint law enforcement today!”

Superintendent Wu’s health Inspection Bureau often participated in joint law enforcement operations, so he was quite familiar with some of the related departments, especially those who participated in the inspection. Many of them called each other brothers. Today, he wanted to do his best to perform well in front of the young master he led, so he spared no effort.

After Tian Mingyi heard this, he laughed and said,”This is good! Brother Wu, what are we waiting for? let’s make the arrangements now ...”

Manager Lu couldn’t help but feel dejected when he heard this and quickly begged,””Two leaders, let’s talk this out, let’s talk this out ...”

As director Wu took out his phone, he glanced at manager Lu and said,””Old Lu, I’ll give you a piece of advice. People give you face. If you don’t give us face, you can blame us for not giving you face! I’ll ask you one last time, can the matter of the box still be resolved?”

Manager Lu secretly sighed and gritted his teeth,””I’m sorry ...”

Director Wu’s face darkened. He had already said so much, but manager Lu still didn’t take the bait. Then, he couldn’t be blamed for being ruthless. He stared at manager Lu without saying a word and then began to make a call.

Manager Lu felt a deep sense of powerlessness. He could only watch as director Wu called for people. He could imagine what kind of chaos the store would be in after the people from the safety Bureau, hygiene Bureau, Environmental Protection, urban management ... Arrived.

To encounter such a thing on the first day of business, first of all, it was a bad sign, not to mention offending this group of grandsons. How difficult would it be for the business in the future?

Director Wu was gathering people, and manager Lu didn’t dare to neglect.

Manager Lu didn’t have any hope of dissuading the two “brats” who were determined to mess with Ling Ji’s private kitchen, Tian Mingyi and director Wu. He could only carefully run to the side and secretly give Ling Xiaotian a call. Although Ling Xiaotian was in the backyard, he didn’t dare to leave for even a second.

Ling Xiaotian quietly listened to manager Lu’s report before he said indifferently,””Let them be! Let’s see who will have the last laugh!”

With that, Ling Xiaotian hung up the phone. Manager Lu was also dumbfounded. He did not know why Ling Xiaotian had such confidence.

However, since the boss had spoken, manager Lu didn’t have to worry so much. He put away his phone and went back to the bar counter.

Director Wu had already finished his call. When manager Lu walked over, Tian Mingyi and director Wu both looked at manager Lu coldly. However, to their disappointment, manager Lu didn’t show any fear. He didn’t even come over to beg. He just calmly and methodically arranged the work.
