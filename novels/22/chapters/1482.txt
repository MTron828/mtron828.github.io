Translator: 549690339

Song Wei glanced at Xia ruofei and said,”Alright, I’ll try my best to remember! However, I’m not very familiar with the terrain here, so I might not be accurate. I hope it will be of help to you!”

“Song Wei, no matter what the result is, thank you!” Xia ruofei nodded.

“I’m just curious,”Song Wei said with a smile,” why do you have to go to the tomb again?” Let’s not talk about the danger, other than professionals like us, I don’t think anyone would like this kind of eerie place, right?”

Xia ruofei was in a difficult position. He didn’t want to lie to Song Wei, but the matter of the world stone was related to the spirit map space. He couldn’t reveal it even to his closest family.

Seeing Xia ruofei’s reaction, Song Wei immediately smiled and said,””Forget it, forget it! I won’t force you if you want to tell me, but you have to promise me that you won’t leave me behind and secretly run over. I only have this one request!”

Xia ruofei nodded without hesitation.””I promise!”

He felt that with him by her side, Song Wei’s safety should not be a problem. Furthermore, Song Wei had already followed him here. If he did not bring her down to the tomb, it would be more dangerous for her to barge in on her own.

Then, Xia ruofei looked at Song Wei gratefully and said,”Thank you for your understanding!”

Song Wei smiled and did not say anything. Instead, she took out a pen and a piece of paper from her bag and began to draw a sketch of the tomb according to her memory.

Xia ruofei did not rush her. He pulled the car to the side of the road and stopped slowly so that the bumps on the road would not affect Song Wei.

While he was waiting quietly, Xia Qing’s voice suddenly sounded in Xia ruofei’s mind. Xia Qing was actively communicating with him through spiritual will.

“Master, before exploring the ancient tomb, I suggest you try to break the seal in the spirit map world.” Xia Qing said. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Ever since they set foot on the journey to the ancient tomb, Xia ruofei had asked Xia Qing to pay attention to the situation outside through divine sense. This time, Xia Qing took the initiative to contact Xia ruofei and gave him her own suggestion, so Xia ruofei naturally attached great importance to it.

“The seal of the spirit map world?” Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, then he remembered the human – shaped jade talisman that had benefited him greatly.

In the mountain and sea realm of the spirit map space, there were still three things sealed. Two of the Jade tokens were probably the earth and heaven Jade talismans. Xia ruofei didn’t know what was in the jade box, but it was sealed in the strongest transparent boundary. This meant that it was more valuable than the Tri – elements jade talisman, which stored a large number of precious books and the “great Dao technique.”

Xia Qing wanted Xia ruofei to try to break the seal on the earth jade talisman.

Ever since he had started cultivating the great Dao formula, Xia ruofei would persist in cultivating at midnight and dawn every day unless there were special circumstances. Under Xia Qing’s planning, he would also enter the spirit map space from time to time to absorb the spiritual Qi. The spiritual Qi here was too dense, and the cultivation speed was at least several times faster than the outside world.

Through this period of hard work, Xia ruofei’s cultivation had also broken through to Qi disciple Level 5.

However, the most important thing to break the seal was still his mental strength. The strength of his mental strength was related to his compatibility with the entire spirit map space, and naturally, it was also related to the scale of the invisible spatial power he could use.

Of course, Xia ruofei seemed to be more talented in terms of spiritual power. Now, his spiritual power had successfully broken through from the spirit throbbing stage to the spirit evolution stage. He was now in the middle stage of the spirit evolution, which was equivalent to a cultivator at Level 7 of the Qi refining stage.

It had been a while since Xia ruofei tried to break the seal, so there was no harm in trying.

However, Xia ruofei still had some questions. He used his spiritual sense to communicate with Xia Qing,””Xia Qing, do you want me to take out the earth jade talisman?”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing said.

“But ... I remember you saying that the earth and heaven Jade talismans only have the cultivation techniques for the last six levels of the great Dao Arts.” Xia ruofei said,”with my current cultivation, I can’t use the last six levels of the technique at all!”

As a Supreme cultivation technique, the first three levels of the “great Dao Arts” were enough for Qi cultivation stage cultivators to use. The last six levels could only be cultivated by high – Level cultivators.

Xia Qing explained,”master, although the earth jade talisman only records the cultivation methods of the fourth, fifth, sixth, and third levels of the” great Dao Arts “, there are also some ancient books that can assist in the cultivation of these levels. However, compared to the massive inheritance in the human jade talisman, the auxiliary inheritance in the earth jade talisman is only a few, almost negligible.”

Speaking of this, Xia Qing changed the topic and said,””But it just so happens that among these supplementary inheritances, there should be something that master needs for this tomb exploration ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but narrow his eyes. As long as his cultivation wasn’t at a level where he could understand the secrets of the spirit map space, Xia Qing would definitely keep her mouth shut.

For example, Xia ruofei was very curious about what was in the jade box in the last Halo protective shield. He had asked Xia Qing about it, but Xia Qing kept her mouth shut and refused to reveal any information.

This time, Xia Qing took the initiative to remind him, so Xia ruofei naturally took it seriously.

“Alright,” he said to Xia Qing with his divine sense,”I’ll find an opportunity to enter the spirit map world as soon as possible. I hope I can successfully open the seal!”

“Master’s spiritual power cultivation has already reached the middle stage of spirit Yan,” Xia Qing said with a smile.”There’s still a great chance of opening the seal.”

After Xia ruofei ended the spiritual communication with Xia Qing, he looked at Song Wei who was drawing a sketch seriously and said,””Song Wei, how about this? Let’s first find a place to settle down in Hualin County. Tonight or tomorrow, we can find time to check out the scene and then discuss the next step of the plan, is that okay?”
