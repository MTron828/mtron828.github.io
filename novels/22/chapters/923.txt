Chapter 924: Friendship (1)

Translator: 549690339

Old Wester was stunned for a moment and said with a bitter smile,””Xia, although I’m in a hurry to sell this winery, if the transaction price is lower than 1.8 million Australian dollars, it doesn’t mean much to me, so ...”

Lin Qiao also looked at Xia ruofei in confusion. She had the impression that Xia ruofei was good at doing business, but he was not a profiteer! Xia ruofei had just said that those who deliberately lowered the price were taking advantage of the situation!

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”uncle Carter, you’ve misunderstood.” What I mean is ... The price of 1.8 million Australian dollars is too much of a loss for you. Just now, lawyer heinte also said that the evaluation report is still relatively objective. Your winery is worth 2.4 million Australian dollars. I don’t think this does not include the invisible brand value. ”

Although the West winery’s wine was not well – known, it was still a well – known winery with more than a hundred years of history. It was quite famous in the Hunter Valley area.

Old West was a little confused.””Xia, you mean ...”

“Uncle Carter, I mean ... I’m willing to buy your winery for 2.4 million Australian dollars!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Hiss ...

Everyone present gasped at the same time. Mr. And Mrs. Wests, as well as lawyer heinte, had incredulous expressions on their faces, as if they couldn’t believe their ears.

In the view of Westerners, business was business. Even if they were very good friends, when it came to business problems, most of the time they would be business – like.

Hence, it was hard for them to understand Xia ruofei’s way of raising the price.

“Xia, you ... You’re not joking, right?” Old West was dumbfounded.

On the contrary, Liang Qichao and Lin Qiao felt that this was the normal Xia ruofei. Lin Qiao’s eyes softened as she looked at Xia ruofei. She even felt a little guilty because she had obviously misunderstood Xia ruofei.

“Mr. Xia, although I can get more Commission if the transaction price is higher, I still can’t understand your decision.” Heinz shrugged and said,”I’ve been in the business for so many years and this is the first time I’ve seen a buyer raising the price ...”

Xia ruofei revealed a faint smile and said to Old West,””Uncle Carter, we’re friends, aren’t we? There’s a saying in China,’a good man has three gangs’, which shows the importance of friends. In the eyes of us Chinese, friends should help each other and not take advantage of each other. You’re in a temporary crisis now, and if I take the opportunity to buy your winery at a low price, it’ll be against our friendship!”

Old Wester looked touched. Xia ruofei was just their neighbor and Xia ruofei did not live in Australia often. He had only come here once a few months ago.

Old West had recently contacted a few old friends of many years, and all of them had shown interest in the West Winery without exception. However, their offers were getting lower and lower. It was obvious that they wanted to take advantage of the situation to make a profit.

Compared to them, Xia ruofei was simply a Saint with a noble character!

Actually, Xia ruofei’s idea was not that noble. It was just that a few hundred thousand Australian dollars was not a big sum to him. To put it bluntly, he could earn that by selling a piece of wild ginseng.

More importantly, Xia ruofei had the intention to hire old Wester and his wife to continue running the winery. He needed to make use of their rich experience. Under such circumstances, he had to pay them more money to win their favor so that they would put in their best efforts in running the winery in the future.

This business was profitable no matter how one looked at it.

Besides, the West Winery was indeed worth 2.4 million Australian dollars. Xia ruofei did not deliberately increase the price or give out charity. He was just giving Old West a fair chance to trade.

Of course, this opportunity was also precious to Old West’s family.

Old West’s lips wriggled a few times before he said,””Xia, you’re such a good person ... However, I can’t agree to a deal of 2.4 million Australian dollars because you’re right, we’re friends! As you’ve heard, our bottom line is 1.8 million Australian dollars, which is the bottom line for my trading company in Melbourne to deal with the aftermath, so when I offered to others, I offered two million Australian dollars. If you’re willing, we’ll trade for two million Australian dollars!”

Old West actually took the initiative to lower Xia ruofei’s bid again. Unknowingly, he was treating this merger with the mindset of the Chinese.

Xia ruofei hesitated and said,”but you’re making a huge loss ... You have to know the value of your winery ...”

“The value is not constant. It’s like a stock. If you’re in a hurry to sell it, you have to sell it at a price lower than the real – time share price.” Old West said,”the West Winery is the stock I’m eager to sell, so ... Two million Australian dollars! Any more and in your words, I’ll be going against the friendship ...”

Heinte shook his head, not knowing whether to laugh or cry. He swore that this was the most bizarre merger and acquisition negotiation he had ever experienced in his life.

Seeing Old West’s firm attitude, Xia ruofei thought for a while, then smiled and nodded.”“OK! Since that’s the case, I’ll respect your opinion! Two million Australian dollars, deal!”

Xia ruofei reached out his hand to Old West.

Old West shook Xia ruofei’s hand tightly and even hugged him. He was touched.”Thank you, my friend!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Uncle Carter, this is business. We’re just taking what we need.”

Seeing that Xia ruofei, who had just been talking about “friendship,” was now saying that this was a business deal, Liang Qichao, Lin Qiao, and the others couldn’t help but smile.

Seeing that his employer had already agreed on the price, heinte said seriously,””Mr. Xia, Mr. West, since you’ve agreed on the deal, I’ll start preparing the merger and acquisition documents!”

“Alright, thank you for your trouble!” Xia ruofei said.

“You’re welcome. This is my job!” Lawyer heinte took out his laptop and said to Old West,”Mr. West, I need the original property rights documents of your winery.”

“Please wait a moment, I’ll go get it for you!” Said Madam cabalie. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

As they were preparing to sell the winery during this period of time, they had already sorted out the documents related to the ownership of the winery. Auntie Capella quickly took them out and handed them to Heinz.

Lawyer heinte carefully checked the relevant documents, then put them aside and began to draft the merger and acquisition contract on his computer.

He was undoubtedly professional and efficient. No wonder he was a lawyer who specialized in M & A services. He quickly drafted the M & a contract and printed two copies with the winery’s printer. One was given to Xia ruofei and the other to Old West.

Considering that Xia ruofei was Chinese, lawyer heinte’s merger and acquisition contract had a Chinese and English version.

Of course, because many Chinese people had come to Australia to buy farms, wineries, and villas in the past two years, as a lawyer who specialized in this line of work, heinte had a professional translation software on his computer, so it was not difficult for him to create a Chinese and English contract.

Xia ruofei quickly read through the contract and passed it to Liang Qichao.

After all, Liang Qichao had lived in Australia for a longer time. He was more familiar with the local laws and regulations than Xia ruofei. Hence, he asked Liang Qichao to check on them.

Very quickly, everyone had finished reading the contract. Since both parties had no objections, Xia ruofei signed his name on the contract and took out his personal seal from his bag to stamp it.

Old West was naturally very happy to sign it. Not only did he get the company’s funds for the aftermath, but he also sold it 200000 Australian dollars more than expected. At this time, he felt a sense of relief.

Old West and Auntie kaberli looked at each other and smiled knowingly.

Xia ruofei and old West exchanged their signatures on the contract and shook hands.

Xia ruofei said in English,”uncle Carter, it’s a little late today. I still need a day or two to process the relevant funds. You know that China’s financial policy is relatively closed. I still need to think of other ways to transfer the money in the country.”

“No problem!” “There’s no rush for the company,” Old West said.”There’s still a series of delivery procedures to be done, which will take time.”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Mm! I’ll have to trouble lawyer heinte with the follow – up matters. ”

Lawyer heinte bowed slightly in a gentlemanly manner and said,””I’m willing to serve you!”

Just like that, in less than an hour, Xia ruofei closed a deal worth ten million Yuan and even signed the contract.

In a sense, although there were still some legal procedures that had not been carried out, he was now the real owner of this winery.

Old West and his wife were very happy and warmly invited Xia ruofei and the others to stay for dinner.

Auntie caitley had already put on her apron and was rubbing her hands in preparation for a sumptuous dinner.

Xia ruofei naturally couldn’t refuse such an invitation, so he, Lin Qiao, and Liang Qichao all stayed.

Uncle Wester went to the wine cellar to find two bottles of good wine to entertain the guests.

Liang Qichao pulled Xia ruofei over and asked quietly,””Ruofei, you probably won’t be able to transfer the money you have in the country in a short time, right?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”yeah!” It’s said that each person can only transfer 50000 dollars a year, so it’s impossible to transfer it directly. We have to think of other ways. ”

Xia ruofei was not too worried about the money needed for the merger and acquisition. Whether it was Grandpa Tang He or MA Xiong, a mere two million Australian dollars could be easily solved.

Moreover, there was also Tang Yitian, who he had met on the plane. He was a local tycoon with assets of tens of billions.

Just as Xia ruofei and the others were discussing the acquisition, they heard the roar of an engine at the entrance of the winery. Then, they saw a modified Ford Raptor driving into the winery.

A fat white man with a funny rosacea nose got out of the car clumsily and then shouted,””Carter, cabeli! Are you guys there?”
