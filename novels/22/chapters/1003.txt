Translator: 549690339

Song Wei’s face also turned red. She quickly tugged on Zhuo Yiyi’s sleeve and said,”Yiyi, uncle song Rui is only of higher seniority. He’s only in his twenties! There’s no need to act young!”

“Is he really in his twenties?” Zhuo Yiyi’s voice couldn’t help but grow louder. She pointed at the unshaven song Rui and said,”it looks like he’s indeed more of a good – looking man, right, uncle?”

Song Rui couldn’t help but roll his eyes. His heart was filled with grief and indignation.

Song Wei looked at song Rui, who looked like a decadent otaku. She wanted to laugh, but she did not dare to. Her face was red from holding it in.

Seeing this, Xia ruofei laughed and said,””Alright, alright! Don’t make fun of song Rui. We were able to catch the thief just now because he contributed the shoe!”

Song Rui’s face darkened. He looked at Xia ruofei resentfully and thought to himself, are you speaking up for me? Why do I feel like I’ve been hurt even more?

Xia ruofei ignored song Rui and passed his bag to Song Wei. He smiled and said,””This is your bag, right? Be more careful next time and see if you’ve lost anything!”

“Thank you, ruofei ...” Song Wei said softly.

She took the bag and checked it. Her phone and documents were all there. She thanked Xia ruofei again.

The two unlucky thieves were still lying on the ground. One of them was motionless, and it was unknown whether he was Dead or Alive. The other one was groaning and moaning like a bloody gourd, looking very scary.

Xia ruofei was well aware of the strength he had used. Besides, the unconscious biker was protected by a helmet. He knew that his life would not be in danger.

Xia ruofei took out his phone and called the police. Soon, the police cars from the nearby police station arrived at the scene.

Before the police arrived, Song Wei called her father, song Qiming, and told him what had happened.

Song Qiming was shocked when he heard that. He quickly asked Song Wei if she was injured.

Song Qiming heaved a sigh of relief when he found out that his daughter was fine, and that Xia ruofei happened to pass by and helped to apprehend the street racer gang. There was also no loss of property.

At the same time, he couldn’t help but feel a little emotional. It seemed like his family was owing Xia ruofei more and more favors ...

Song Qiming was very dissatisfied with the public security of Sanshan city. Even the daughter of the Secretary of the municipal government was robbed by a street racer gang. How chaotic was the public security?

Therefore, he immediately called Chen Bo, the Deputy Mayor and director of the Public Security Bureau of Sanshan city. On the one hand, he asked him to inform the police station in the liberation Square. On the other hand, he wanted to severely criticize the public security situation in Sanshan. He also asked the Public Security Bureau to immediately take action and increase the inspection of human gathering places such as stations, subways, and urban complexes to crack down on all kinds of illegal crimes.

It was conceivable that with the words of the Secretary of the municipal Committee, Sanshan city was bound to launch a large – scale crackdown on illegal and criminal activities. The days of the snakes, insects, rats, and ants living in the dark were becoming more and more difficult because of two little thieves who did not have eyes.

The police had received instructions from their superiors, so they were very polite to Xia ruofei, Song Wei, and the others. They did not ask them to go back to the station. They took a simple statement at the scene and let them leave.

Then, the police investigated the scene, preserved the evidence, and called an ambulance to take the two unlucky people to the hospital.

Of course, these things had nothing to do with Xia ruofei and the rest.

Knowing that Song Wei and Zhuo Yiyi did not have a car, Xia ruofei offered to give them a ride.

When Xia ruofei drove the Knight XV off – Road vehicle out of the hotel’s parking lot, Zhuo Yiyi could not help but whistle and exclaim excitedly,””The Knight the fifteenth!”

Then, she grabbed Song Wei’s hand and jumped up and down.”Wei Wei, it’s the Knight XV! And it’s a limited edition! How domineering!”

Song Wei said to Xia ruofei awkwardly,””Ruofei, I’m sorry ... Yiyi really likes cars ...”

“I’m fine ...”Xia ruofei chuckled.

Then, Xia ruofei waved at Zhuo Yiyi and said with a smile,””Get in the car!”

Zhuo Yiyi was still in a state of excitement as she mumbled,””I can actually ride on Knight XV once ...”

At the side, song Rui couldn’t help but roll his eyes again with a look of disdain.

In fact, song Rui had driven here, but he did not leave alone. Instead, he reached for the door of the Knight XV’s passenger seat.

Zhuo Yiyi was the first to open the car door, and she said with a smile,””Uncle, can you let me sit in the front passenger seat?”

Facing Zhuo Yiyi, whose eyes were full of stars, song Rui shrugged helplessly and gestured for her to leave.

“Thank you, uncle!” Zhuo Yiyi said happily.

“Sister, can you not call me big ...” Song Rui said helplessly.

Before he could finish his sentence, Zhuo Yiyi had already deftly grabbed the handle of the car and climbed up in two steps, entering the car.

After she closed the car door, she stuck her head out of the window and asked innocently,””Uncle, what did you just say?”

Puchi ...

Song Wei could not help but laugh again.

“It’s nothing ...”Song Rui said helplessly.

“Oh!” Zhuo Yiyi immediately retracted her head. Then, like Granny Liu entering a Grand View Garden, she looked up and down, left and right, sizing up everything in the car.

Song Wei and song Rui also got into the car. Xia ruofei looked at Zhuo Yiyi and said,””Can you put on your seat belt first?”

Zhuo Yiyi stuck out her tongue in embarrassment and hurriedly unbuckled her seat belt. Then, she said to Xia ruofei,””Alright! Let’s drive ...”

Along the way, Zhuo Yiyi looked at Xia ruofei’s car as if it was a piece of art. She loved it so much that she could not bear to part with it. Xia ruofei could see from the corner of his eye that Zhuo Yiyi was touching the interior of the car as if she was touching her lover. He could not help but feel a chill in his heart.

Fortunately, the hotel that Zhuo Yiyi was staying at was not far from Liberation Square, so they arrived there in no time.

Under Song Wei’s urging, Zhuo Yiyi got out of the car reluctantly.

“RUO Fei, song Rui ... Uncle, thank you for today!” Song Wei said politely.

Xia ruofei laughed and waved his hand. “It’s a small matter, no need to be so polite! Then we’ll be leaving first!”

“Drive slowly ...” Song Wei smiled.

“Wait!” Zhuo Yiyi called out,”brother ruofei, you’ve helped us so much today. Let me treat you to a meal ... Oh, right, uncle, you should come too!” In any case, you contributed a shoe ...”

Song Rui almost lost his temper when he heard that. This was too much of a difference in treatment! If that kid ruofei becomes “brother ruofei,” then I’m just an “uncle”! Also, can you not mention a sore spot? Besides, I’m going to get mad at you about the shoes ...

Zhuo Yiyi did not notice the murderous look in song Rui’s eyes. She was still looking at Xia ruofei expectantly ... To be more precise, she was looking at the Knight XV.

“Yiyi, your plane ...” Song Wei reminded her softly.

Zhuo Yiyi replied nonchalantly,”the flight is in the evening!” Let’s have dinner earlier! There’s still time ... Brother ruofei, do you have time?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”I don’t have anything to do today. But you don’t have to be so polite.”

“Of course, of course, I’ll repay your kindness!” Zhuo Yiyi hurriedly said,”then it’s a deal!”

Song Wei looked at her best friend helplessly and shook her head with a bitter smile.

At this moment, Zhuo Yiyi smiled in embarrassment and said,””Since we’re going to have dinner together ... Why don’t we go out in the afternoon? I have to catch a plane, so I’ll have to eat early!”

Xia ruofei was stunned and asked,”play?” Where are you going?”

“Anything! You can go for a ride too!” Zhuo Yiyi blurted out, then awkwardly said,”that ... Don’t misunderstand, it’s not because of the car ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I know, I know ... Okay!” We’ll follow your arrangements!”

Zhuo Yiyi said happily,”yay!” That’s great ... Why don’t you guys wait for me? I’ll go check out of my room and get my luggage. I’ll be done soon! This way, we can go directly to the airport after dinner!”

“Alright then!” Xia ruofei said,”slow down! There’s no hurry ...”

Zhuo Yiyi nodded her head heavily and walked into the hotel quickly. Song Wei also quickly greeted Xia ruofei and song Rui before quickly following them.

Xia ruofei and song Rui got out of the car. Xia ruofei took out the special cigarette that elder song had given him and flicked one for song Rui. Then, he took one for himself.

The two of them lit up their cigarettes and took a puff. Xia ruofei laughed and said,””Song Rui, this girl is quite interesting.”

Song Rui pursed his lips and said,”why didn’t I see that?” He’s like a love – struck fool ...”

Xia ruofei laughed,”this shows that he’s real!” At least it’s better than those women who put on a show with you and flatter you!”

“That’s true ...”Song Rui took a puff of his cigarette and said.

Then, Xia ruofei said awkwardly,”by the way, didn’t you drive today?” Why are you in my car?”

Song Rui was stunned for a moment and then immediately said,””There’s a problem with my car’s ability to avoid shock ... I ... I asked the repair shop to fix it! Why? You don’t want to get in your car?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”no problem!” It’s my honor to have you, young master Song, ride with me!”

“Don’t give me that ...”Song Rui pouted and said.

Then, song Rui asked shyly,””Ruofei, do you have a razor in your car?”

“What’s the matter?”Xia ruofei asked with a faint smile.

“I ... Don’t I think it’s not good to have an unkempt beard?” Song Rui said,”I didn’t have the mood to take care of it a few days ago, but I’m fine now, aren’t I? Of course I have to pay attention to my image!”

Xia ruofei glanced at the entrance of the hotel and said with a smile,””I really do have some ... Just you wait!”

With that, Xia ruofei walked to the back of the car and opened the trunk. He bent down to block song Rui’s view and took out an electric shaver from the space. After some thought, he took out a clean shirt and casual pants.

Xia ruofei tucked his clothes under his arm and passed the razor to song Rui. He asked,””I think you’re dressed too casually. Do you want to change? I happen to have a spare set of clothes and pants here. Our figures are similar, so you should be able to wear it. ”

“Why would I change out of the blue?” Song Rui asked, his eyes evasive.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”didn’t Zhuo Yiyi call you” uncle “?” Don’t you want to give her a good scare?”

“That makes sense!” Song Rui immediately said,”thanks, brother! I’ll shave first!”

After saying that, song Rui immediately climbed into the car and lowered the sunshade in front of the passenger seat. He shaved his beard in front of the small makeup mirror and then tidied up his messy hair.

Xia ruofei smiled as he passed the clothes to song Rui. Song Rui changed his clothes in the car.

Not long after he got out of the car, Zhuo Yiyi and Song Wei came out of the hotel, each pushing a suitcase.

“I’m sorry for the long wait ...” Zhuo Yiyi said as she pushed her luggage to the back of the car.

“It’s okay. Give me your luggage!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Then, he took the large suitcases from Zhuo Yiyi and Song Wei, opened the trunk, and placed them inside. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Thanks!” Zhuo Yiyi said with a smile.

Then, Zhuo Yiyi curiously asked,””Eh? Where’s uncle? Did he leave in anger?”

At that moment, song Rui, who had just shaved and changed his clothes, was standing beside Zhuo Yiyi. However, Zhuo Yiyi actually ignored him. Song Rui could not help but feel speechless ...
