2272 Family meeting (2)

Then, he said to his brothers and sisters,””Everyone, lower your voices. Don’t disturb the old master’s rest!”

“I know!” Liu Lifang said. I know! Big brother, hurry up and go in!”

Liu Qunfeng looked at Liu Lifang helplessly and walked into the ward.

As soon as he entered the house, he saw the caretaker, Mrs. Zhang, walking towards him.

Before Liu Qunfeng could say anything, Mrs. Zhang gestured for him to keep quiet. She then pointed inside. Obviously, old Liu was still sleeping.

Liu Qunfeng stopped and said in a low voice,””Mrs. Zhang, keep a close eye on him. When my father wakes up, let me know immediately.”

“Alright, chief Liu.” Mrs. Zhang said softly.

Liu Qunfeng turned around and walked out of the ward. Liu Shanshan, Liu qun Yan, and the others quickly surrounded him. Liu Lifang couldn’t wait to ask,””Big brother, how is it?”

“The old man is still sleeping. Let’s wait outside for a while!” “Don’t make too much noise,” Liu Qunfeng said.”The old man doesn’t think it’s a big deal!”

“I know!” Liu Lifang said, a little disinterested. Then, she went straight to the bench and sat down. She took out her phone and played with it in boredom.

Everyone had something on their minds, so the waiting time seemed particularly long.

About half an hour later, the caretaker, Mrs. Zhang, finally opened the door. She looked at Liu Qunfeng and said,””Chief Liu, the chief has woken up. He asked everyone to go in.”

“Good! Good! Good!” “Mrs. Zhang,” Liu Qunfeng said.”You can rest outside for a while and help keep an eye on the area. Don’t let anyone in.” If they’re medical staff, please ask them to wait. ”

“I got it, chief Liu!” Mrs. Zhang said.

Liu Qunfeng beckoned everyone to follow him into the room.

“Daddy!”

“Big brother!”

“Uncle!”

Everyone respectfully greeted the skinny old man Liu who was lying on the bed.

Old master Liu was in good spirits, thanks to the “friendly massage” that Xia ruofei had given him. Now, old master Liu’s face looked much Ruder than before.

With a faint smile on his face, he slightly nodded to everyone and said,””All of you, find a stool and sit down!”

Liu Chongli, Liu Qunfeng, and the others sat around the bed, their eyes on elder Liu. They couldn’t wait to know how the discussion between the elder and Xia ruofei had gone.

However, what they did not expect was that elder Liu did not talk about his condition or his negotiation with Xia ruofei. He said calmly,””Now I can basically confirm that the haojun incident was planned and executed by Xia ruofei.”

“What?” Liu Qunfeng stood up immediately.”Dad, did he admit it himself?”

Liu haojun was Liu Qunfeng’s son. He had a promising future, but after this incident, he was unable to recover.

The incident at the three mountains was obviously a trap. It was just that Xia ruofei’s arrangement was too meticulous, and the Liu family could not find any clues.

However, this did not stop Liu Qunfeng from hating the person who had caused this.

So, when he heard that Xia ruofei was the one who planned and executed Liu haojun’s incident, Liu Qunfeng’s eyes turned red.

Old Liu glanced at Liu Qunfeng with dissatisfaction and said,””Sit down!”

Liu Qunfeng was also a powerful figure outside, especially in the important Ministry he served in. He was the second – in – command and had a lot of power in the unit. However, in front of elder Liu, Liu Qunfeng was like an obedient little sheep, and he didn’t dare to disobey.

Liu Qunfeng quickly sat back in his seat and looked at elder Liu.””Dad, what’s the exact situation?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Qunfeng, you’re already a Minister, so why can’t you keep your cool?” old man Liu asked. How can I trust you with the Liu family in the future?”

“Yes ... Dad, I was wrong!” Liu Qunfeng said, his head lowered.

Old man Liu looked around at the crowd and said,””Since little Xia has admitted to this matter, it means that he is completely fearless. Moreover, he said those words when we met in private. Even if he admits it, do we have any evidence?”

Then, old man Liu looked at Liu Qunfeng and said,””Why did the equipment that you and your men fiddled with in the morning malfunction all at the same time? there was only the time when I met him, and nothing was recorded. Do you think this is a coincidence?”

“Even if we don’t have any evidence, as long as we know he’s the one who started it, it won’t make a difference to us, right?” Liu Qunfeng mumbled.

Old man Liu sneered and said,””The difference is huge! If he didn’t have full confidence, would he dare to come to meet me alone? Qunfeng, although Xia ruofei is 30 years younger than you, he gives me the feeling that he’s much more steady than you! You have to keep strengthening your Qi – nurturing skills!”

“I know, dad ...” Liu Qunfeng said bitterly.

Old man Liu looked at Liu qun Yan and said,””Last time, haofan suffered a loss in the acquisition of land. Although Xia ruofei didn’t admit it personally, one thing is for sure. He played a crucial role in it. Haofan was a sucker this time!”

Liu qun Yan was Liu haofan’s father, so when he heard the news, he couldn’t help but frown.

However, his reaction wasn’t as intense as Liu Qunfeng ‘s. After all, Liu haofan had only lost some money and then became a laughing stock in the aristocratic circle during that period of time. Overall, the impact wasn’t big, unlike Liu haojun, who had his entire career ruined.

After Liu Chongli heard this, he couldn’t help but frown and said,”Big brother, this kid with the surname Xia has a deep grudge against our family!”

“I’m sure we all know what our own children are like,”said old man Liu indifferently. Although Xia ruofei is as cunning as a Fox, he never takes the initiative to stir up trouble. If only fan haojun and haofan had worked harder, they wouldn’t have had conflicts with Xia ruofei and caused us to be in such a passive position!”

If Xia ruofei had heard that old master Liu’s evaluation of him was “as cunning as a Fox”, he would not know whether to laugh or cry.

Of course, in all fairness, he really did not show any mercy to his enemies, and his means were quite rich. It was not an exaggeration to say that he was as cunning as a Fox.

Liu Chongli laughed dryly.”That’s true ... But we’ll discipline our own children. This Xia brat clearly doesn’t care about the Liu family!”

Old man Liu waved his hand and said,”we’re not here to discuss this today!” Let’s talk about my treatment ...”

“Dad, has Xia ruofei agreed to treat you?” Liu Qunfeng asked.

“Almost!” Old man Liu said,”we have basically reached a consensus.”

Everyone heaved a long sigh of relief when they heard that. Liu Lifang even patted her bulging chest exaggeratedly and said,”This kid is quite tactful!”

“Foolish!” Old man Liu said mercilessly,”he’s already in an undefeatable position. He can attack and retreat at will. He doesn’t need to care about what we think of him at all. If he really refuses for the sake of treatment, what can you do to him?”

Liu Lifang shrunk her neck and did not dare to speak anymore.

At this time, old man Liu looked at Liu Chongli and said indifferently,””Chongli, there’s something I need you to hurry up and do.”

“Big brother, please speak!” Liu Chongli quickly said.

“Transfer all of our Jiangnan Pharmaceutical Group to Xia ruofei as fast as possible!” Old man Liu said,”that kid won’t do anything until he sees the rabbit. He will never help us until he receives the real money for the treatment.”

“What? The entire Pharmaceutical Group will be transferred to him?” Liu Chongli revealed a shocked expression.

“That’s right. I promised him myself. Is there a problem?” Old man Liu asked indifferently.

Liu Chongli’s heart couldn’t help but clench, and he quickly said,”No problem! No problem! Big brother, I’ll definitely settle this matter as soon as possible!”
