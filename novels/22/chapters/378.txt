Chapter 379: The spirit nurturing soup (2)

Xia ruofei’s forehead was covered in sweat.

The Golden stripes were still moving at a steady pace, and their various decomposition and regrouping processes were all rather slow.

Words began to appear on the page, but they did not appear regularly from the first word of the first line. Hence, in Xia ruofei’s eyes, these were meaningless words that did not match up.

One minute, two minutes ...

Xia ruofei started to feel a headache. It was a sign of overexertion.

However, only a few words had appeared on the page, and a large number of golden stripes were still moving slowly.

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.

It seemed that this time was destined to end in failure. He did not dare to force out more spiritual power because no one had taught him this knowledge. He did not know if there would be any sequelae if he continued, or if it would cause irreparable damage to his brain.

Hence, Xia ruofei gave up at the right time.

When Xia ruofei retracted his spiritual power, the words that had formed and the Golden stripes that had shifted positions immediately returned to their original positions. The page quickly returned to its original state.

Xia ruofei laughed bitterly. His last hope of trickery had been dashed.

Originally, he thought that since his mental power was not enough, he could restore a small part at a time. Given some time, he could still restore the entire content of the third page.

However, the reality was that an entire page of content had to be restored at once. Otherwise, even if the content had been restored before, it would disappear. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

He couldn’t just cancel it by chance. He could only restore the contents of the third page by deepening his spiritual power.

However, Xia ruofei was not discouraged.

This was because the spirit nourishment soup was used to strengthen one’s mental power. Once he made the spirit nourishment soup, his mental power would not only be upgraded by the space. He believed that he would be able to restore the contents of the third, fourth, and fifth pages very soon.

There was nothing else in the stone chamber. Xia ruofei quickly left the cave and went outside.

He was worried that Blackie and the others would break into the stone room, so he called them over to give them some instructions.

However, Xia ruofei was overthinking. He soon realized that Blackie and the rest could not get into the cave.

The mischievous er Mao rushed to the entrance of the cave just as he was about to give the order. However, it was as if there was an invisible force around the entrance of the cave. Er Mao could not move a single step forward.

Seeing this, Xia ruofei was a little curious. He went over to try and found that it was unimpeded.

He asked Blackie and the other dogs to try, but they were in the same situation as er Mao. They couldn’t get in at all.

“It seems like only the owner of the spirit map space can enter and leave this cave freely,” Xia ruofei thought.

This way, Xia ruofei was much more at ease.

He then used his mind to inspect the wordless stone tablet again, but he didn’t find anything new. It was still the little golden man demonstrating the set of nine movements over and over again.

However, no matter how hard Xia ruofei tried to remember, as long as his mind left the stone tablet, he would forget the remaining seven sets of movements completely. After taking the body tempering soup, he could successfully pose for the second set of movements. Now, he could remember two sets of movements in his mind.

After patrolling around the space, Xia ruofei gave Blackie and the rest some food. Then, with a thought, he returned to the outside world from the new space.

Xia ruofei returned to his room and took a look. It was already past twoo’ clock in the afternoon. By the time he got home, it was almost time for lunch. He spent most of his time in the new space. The time flow there was the same as the outside world. Without realizing it, a few hours had passed.

However, Xia ruofei did not feel hungry at all. He thought that it was probably because of the body tempering soup.

Xia ruofei decided not to eat lunch. He put on his coat and walked down the stairs.

Li Zhifu seemed to have gone for an afternoon nap. Ye Lingyun was alone in the courtyard, diligently practicing the tea – making skills that li Zhifu had taught him.

Seeing Xia ruofei come down, ye Lingyun quickly put down the large dustpan in his hand and came forward to greet him respectfully.

Xia ruofei nodded in satisfaction and smiled.””Ling Yun, how have you been these past few days? Old master Li is a master of tea – making, so you must learn everything he teaches you!”

“Yes! Brother Xia, I will definitely work hard to learn from teacher. ” Ye linyun said,”but I’m a little stupid, so I can’t meet teacher’s requirements ...”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”It’s impossible to become a fatty in one go. Learning anything is a gradual process, especially this ancient tea – making method. You have to practice countless times before you can slowly find the feeling. You don’t have to be anxious.”

Ye linyun nodded and continued,”Brother Xia, I understand ... But I feel that the teacher’s emotions seem to be a little irritable ...”

Xia ruofei understood immediately. Li Zhifu must have felt that he did not have much time left, so he wanted to pass on his skills as much as possible. It was inevitable that he would be a little impatient.

However, Xia ruofei didn’t want to reveal it so early. Xia ruofei actually liked old man Li’s state. At this time, he would definitely teach ye Lingyun all his skills without reservation.
