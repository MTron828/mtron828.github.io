After Shen fangjian spoke a long paragraph in one breath, he quickly took a breath and immediately said excitedly,”This ball was so beautiful! It was really too beautiful! It was like a piece of art! I really can’t believe that this was kicked out by us Chinese players ... Please forgive my words, but this is indeed how I feel at this moment!”

“Xia ruofei was very calm with that shot!” Jia Tianning said from the side,”and after he deftly dodged the other side’s rush, he didn’t even look at the goal and directly shot a high – Quality drop shot! This meant that he had been observing the situation throughout the game and had a very good field of vision. He immediately noticed that the goalkeeper was standing closer to the front, so he did not hesitate to shoot! There was no doubt that Xia ruofei’s vision and awareness were much better than the domestic players! Just this goal alone was something that many big – Name European star players might not be able to achieve! This goal is destined to be remembered for a long time!”

Shen fangjian’s emotions had calmed down a little. He smiled and teased,””Tianning, the netizens are saying that you’re the Vice – Leader of ‘wuchui Hall’. I think you should be promoted and directly become the leader of ‘xiachui Hall’!”

Upon hearing Shen fangjian’s words, many fans who stayed up late to watch the game almost spat on the computer monitor. No one had expected Shen fangjian, who was from the National television station, to have such a mischievous side.

“I dare say that if Xia ruofei continues to play professional football, his achievements will definitely be beyond our imagination!” Jia Tianning didn’t mind Shen fangjian’s teasing. He said,”but considering Xia ruofei’s identity, I don’t think he’ll really become a professional player!”

Perhaps Shen fangjian thought of the current situation of the national football team and felt a little heavy, so he directly changed the topic and said,””Let’s just enjoy happy football! I believe that a month ago, we wouldn’t have dared to imagine that two Chinese players would score in the top league. Tonight’s game is simply a Chinese – only game!”

“I’ve even thought of the headlines for tomorrow’s press,”Jia Tianning laughed. China’s Twin Stars, dazzling West a!”

It was indeed a familiar smell! Whether it was wuchui Tang or xiachui Tang, Jia Tianning was indeed a very competent Hall Master.

……

Back on the field, the Spanish players were celebrating wildly at Valencia’s home ground. The home fans in the stands were unusually quiet. They were shocked by Xia ruofei’s brilliant shot. Some fans even applauded the beautiful goal.

Football was never just about confrontation. When pure fans saw such a goal, even if it was scored by an opposing player, they would also express appreciation from the bottom of their hearts.

It had only been a minute since they had watched the game, and the players from both sides had returned to their own half to prepare for the kick – off. The difference was that this time, it was the valentian team who kicked off, and the score on the field had already been rewritten to 2:2。

The referee blew the whistle and the game resumed.

The valentian team did not press on and attack wantonly just because they were equalized by their opponents at home. After they kicked off, they kept passing the ball in the middle and backfield, sending safe passes. They would rather return the ball if they did not have a good opportunity to attack.

Before they knew it, they had already passed the ball more than 20 times and had always firmly controlled the ball under the feet of their own players.

It was not that Valencia’s players did not want to win on their home ground. Against the Spanish team, who were obviously not as good as them, and on their home ground, Valencia would definitely want to score all three points.

However, these players were very experienced. They knew that after Xia ruofei’s wonderful long shot, the Spaniards ‘morale must have been greatly improved. In contrast, the mentality of their own players would be more or less affected. In addition, they still had a lot of game time, so they decided to stabilize their position first.

As a result, after a lightning – fast goal in the first ten seconds, the game gradually entered a calm period.

The players on both sides were mainly focused on the midfield. Once they lost the possession of the ball, both sides would launch a counter – grab on the spot, which naturally led to more fouls. The referee’s whistle rang continuously, and the game was cut into pieces.

The fans at the venue were a little drowsy, not to mention the Chinese fans who were watching the live broadcast on TV or in front of the computer. It was now past fouro’ clock in China time. Fans who had the experience of staying up late to watch the game knew that if the pace of the game was fast and smooth, it was fine. But once the game reached a deadlock and became dull, the sleepiness could not be suppressed even by a few cans of Red Bull.

Just as many Chinese fans were yawning, the situation on the field suddenly changed and another goal was scored!

However, the goal was scored by the Valensia team.

The loss of the ball this time was due to the opponent’s high – Post rush. After successfully intercepting the ball in the Spanish backfield, they counterattacked on the spot. With a simple inverted triangle Pass, Valencia’s No. 9 forward, Gamero, faced most of the empty goal and easily pushed the ball into the net.

Ruby’s lungs were about to explode on the sidelines. It was not easy to equalize the score, and the team saw the hope of taking away a point in the away game. They did not expect that after holding on for more than 20 minutes, the goal was lost again.

And the reason for conceding the goal was, to be honest, an old habit of Spain.

Espanyol was a team that paid attention to pass control and did not easily use long balls or long passes.
