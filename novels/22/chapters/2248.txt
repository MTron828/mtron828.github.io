Peng Chang was a little scared by everyone’s gaze and couldn’t help but ask,””Why are you all looking at me?”

“Pengpeng, what’s that in your pocket?” Zhang Xing asked with a smile.

“I’m not pretending at all!” Peng Chang said as he reached into his pocket. Then, his face froze and his expression became very rich.

Huang Lei laughed and said,”Pengpeng, stop hiding!” What’s that in your pocket? take it out and let’s see!”

Peng Chang looked as if he had seen a ghost. He stared at Xia ruofei for a long time before he took his hand out of his pocket and slowly opened it up in front of everyone. There were three bags of tea in his hand.

Xia ruofei smiled as he watched from the side.

He Jiong took a step forward first and picked up the three packets of tea leaves in Peng Chang’s hands to take a closer look. He exclaimed, “It’s those three bags of tea leaves! There’s a mark on it from when I tore it just now!”

After he finished speaking, he showed the tea bag to the camera.

The cameraman naturally zoomed in. Not only was the tea bag with a small opening clearly visible, but the LOGO of paradise Corporation was also captured in the video.

Huang Lei and the others applauded, and even the staff at the side couldn’t help but clap. Xia ruofei saw Qin Yanan and he Yu in the crowd and was so excited that his face turned red.

It wasn’t just because the magic show was very exciting. More importantly, they saw that during the magic show, the peach blossom Big Red Robe appeared in the close – up shot again and again. This kind of advertising effect was undoubtedly quite gratifying.

Peng Chang came back to his senses and looked at Xia ruofei with admiration. He said,””President Xia, how did you do it? I ... I don’t feel anything at all! Teach me! I want to learn this magic trick!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Pengpeng, the rule of the magic world is not to reveal secrets. Otherwise, magic will lose its appeal.”

Xia ruofei wasn’t trying to shirk responsibility. There was indeed such an unwritten rule in the magic world. After all, magic was just a cover – up. Once the secret was revealed, people might be enlightened at the time, but they would slowly develop a feeling of “so that’s all there is to it.” In the long run, this would be very harmful to the industry.

Peng Chang still didn’t give up and said enthusiastically,””President Xia! Brother Xia! Then you can teach me in private! I really want to learn this magic trick ...”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He saw Peng Chang coming out to talk, so he moved the three bags of tea into Peng Chang’s pocket on the spur of the moment. He even patted Peng Chang’s shoulder on purpose to make sure that there was physical contact between them. This way, it wouldn’t be suspicious. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be a magic trick but a fantasy.

How could he teach such ‘magic’?

Facing Peng Chang’s “passion for learning”, Xia ruofei didn’t know how to reject him. After all, they were still recording the show! If his words and actions weren’t appropriate, it would easily cause a heated discussion, especially when he was likely to be criticized by Peng Chang’s fans.

Although xiangnan TV would probably edit out the content that was not beneficial to him, as long as it was recorded, there was a possibility that it would not be leaked.

Fortunately, at this moment, the phone rang, which helped Xia ruofei out of the situation.

He Jiong and Huang Lei had very high emotional intelligence. They could tell that Xia ruofei was not very willing to teach this magic trick and were thinking about how to phrase it! After the phone rang, He Jiong quickly said, “Let’s answer the phone first! Maybe it’s the guest who’s coming tomorrow!”

Xia ruofei also said,”yes, yes, yes!” Answer the phone first! Pengpeng, if you want to learn magic, let’s have a private exchange!”

Peng Chang saw that Xia ruofei didn’t give a definite answer and immediately said happily,””Good, good, good!”

Zhang Xing stood up and walked over when he heard the phone ring. Xia ruofei and the rest surrounded him, interested in the phone call.

“Hello, this is mushroom hut. Who is this?” Zhang Xing picked up the phone.

“You can order here, right?” A strange – sounding male voice said. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

He Jiong’s ear was also pressed against the outside of the microphone. He turned his head immediately after he heard the whole story and said with a smile, “He’s actually using a voice changer! This year’s special guests are getting harder and harder to guess ...”

Huang Lei’s face was full of contempt as he said,””Teacher he, stop acting. You’re the only one here who knows the guest list!”

Even though Xia ruofei was not standing as close as He Jiong, his hearing was much better than the average person. He could still hear the voice coming from the phone. However, the other party had used a voice changer and there was no accent. It was just Standard Mandarin. Furthermore, he was not very familiar with celebrities, so he naturally could not guess who the guest was.

“It’s fine. What do you want to eat?”Zhang Xing said.

“Little Star, let me ...” Huang Lei said.

“Oh!” Zhang Xing passed the phone to Huang Lei.

Huang Lei chatted with the other party on the phone for a while, trying to get the other party to say a few more words to determine the other party’s identity.

However, once the voice changer was used, unless it was someone who was very familiar with the other party’s usual tone, it was impossible to guess.

In the end, Huang Lei couldn’t figure out the other party’s identity. Instead, the other party ordered Yuxiang shredded pork, Kung Pao Chicken, and twice – cooked pork. He directly pointed out that the food expenses of ivory flower cricket were limited. To prepare these three dishes with a meal fee of 100 yuan was a test of the guest’s ability to run a house.

After the call, everyone sat down and chatted for a while before they prepared to go upstairs to rest.

After all, this was a Leisure Program for a slow life. It definitely had to advocate a healthy lifestyle. He couldn’t stay up late at the mushroom house to brand himself or look at his phone.

Moreover, there was only one bathroom, so everyone had to take turns to shower.

As a guest, Xia ruofei was also given special treatment and was the first to use the bathroom.

After he took a shower and changed into his home clothes, he greeted He Jiong and the rest before returning to his room to rest.

He was the only guest on this episode, so he could choose any of the two rooms and stay in a single room. The guests who would come later would not receive such treatment. There would definitely be a few people coming for each episode, so everyone would have to share a room.

Even though there was a camera in the bedroom, Xia ruofei did not care. After climbing into bed, he used his phone to browse the news for a while before lying down and sleeping.

Within the array, the spiritual Qi was abundant. The environment here was beautiful and quiet. Xia ruofei could not cultivate under such circumstances, so he fell asleep very quickly.

Outside, after he Jiong and the rest took turns to shower, they returned to their rooms to rest. The four regular guests were staying in one room. According to the program’s tradition, they would sleep on the same shared bed.

Qin Yanan and he Yu had gone to the adjacent building to rest. Most of the staff members had also retreated to the building, leaving only two staff members on duty.

While Xia ruofei was fast asleep, the sound of snoring could be heard from the shared bed on the other end.

Xia ruofei woke up at six in the morning the next day.

The chirping of birds came from outside the window, which was particularly crisp in the quiet morning.

He got out of bed and walked over to open the window. Looking at the lake shrouded in mist in the distance, he suddenly felt much better.

Xia ruofei took a deep breath and stretched his chest in front of the window. He felt full of energy.

First, he meticulously folded the blanket and smoothed out the bedsheets.

Although he had left the Army, Xia ruofei still maintained many of the habits he had in the Army. For example, he folded his blanket according to the Army’s method of folding tofu blocks.

Although it was difficult to fold the new blanket into distinct corners, it was still very neat and comfortable to look at.

After tidying up the bed, Xia ruofei took his bag and went to wash his face and brush his teeth.

After returning to his room, he walked to the camera and hung a piece of clothing on it to block the camera. Then, he took off his home clothes and changed into the casual clothes he wore yesterday.

Xia ruofei walked out of the room after he was done packing.

When he went downstairs, he would pass by the room where he Jiong and the others were staying. He looked inside and realized that two people were still sleeping soundly under the blankets, while the blankets had already been folded on the other two beds.

“There’s actually someone earlier than me ...” Xia ruofei smiled and mumbled to himself.

Just as he walked down the stairs, he saw Huang Lei poking his head out of the kitchen. He smiled and greeted him,””Good Morning, President Xia!”

“Thank you for your hard work, teacher Huang!” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”you’re up so early to prepare breakfast ...”

“Hahaha! It wasn’t hard at all! I’m still having fun!” Huang Lei laughed heartily and said,”because of this program, my work and rest have become more regular. I go to bed early and wake up early every day!”

“Alright! This is a healthy lifestyle!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Isn’t that so!” Huang Lei smiled and said,”young people nowadays are used to sleeping and waking up late. Teacher he and I are already up. Pengpeng and Xiaoxing must be sleeping soundly now!”

“Teacher he, you’re up too!” Xia ruofei said.

It seemed that Zhang Xing and Peng Chang must be in the two beds that were still occupied.

“Yup! He should be taking a walk outside!” Huang Lei said.

“Alright then! Teacher Huang, I won’t disturb you any longer!” Xia ruofei smiled.”I’m going to talk to teacher he ...”

Xia ruofei walked into the courtyard. The fresh air assailed his nose, making him feel relaxed and happy.

As expected, He Jiong had already woken up. At this moment, he was talking to two mountain goats at the sheep pen.

Hearing the sound of footsteps, He Jiong turned around and took a glance. Then, he waved at Xia ruofei happily and said,”President Xia, here ...”

Xia ruofei walked over with a smile and said,””Teacher he, you’re up early!”

He Jiong chuckled and said,”I’m getting older, so I don’t sleep as much ... I’m like this now. No matter what time I sleep on the first day, even if I stay up late and work until two or threeo’ clock, I’ll definitely wake up on time at Sixo’ clock the next morning!”

Xia ruofei looked at He Jiong and said with a smile,”Teacher he hasn’t reached that age yet!”

The two of them chatted as they fed the sheep the apples in the basket.

After a while, Zhang Xing and Peng Chang finally woke up. They took the initiative to pick up the brooms and clean the yard.

Meanwhile, Huang Lei was busy preparing breakfast for everyone.

Soon, his voice came from the kitchen,””A few people, help to bring the breakfast out!”

Xia ruofei and he Jiong put down the apples in their hands and walked towards the mushroom hut.

Everyone worked together, and breakfast was quickly moved to the long table under the pergola.

Huang Lei’s breakfast was quite sumptuous, but of course, that was under the condition that the daily food allowance was limited to 100 yuan. Outside, the sumptuous breakfast could only be considered ordinary.

Xia ruofei did not have high material requirements. He could enjoy a meal that cost tens of thousands of euros and a skewer that cost a few dollars.

He Jiong and Peng Chang had also participated in the recording of the first two seasons of the show. They had long been used to this kind of hardship, so they also ate with great relish.

Zhang Xing was known to be a good boy, so he was naturally not picky about breakfast.

Everyone sat around the table and chatted as they ate breakfast.

At this moment, there was a knock on the wooden door. Then, a familiar voice rang out.””Is there anyone at home?”
