Chapter 3478: Secret spaceship converse.2

Translator: 549690339

Mu Hua wasn’t the only golden core stage elder in the surging waves sect, but mu Hua was the youngest and the most talented one. He was the one Mu Sheng had high hopes for.

The most important thing was that mu Hua and Mu Sheng were from the same family. According to seniority, mu Hua should be mu Jianfei’s uncle, so this relationship was naturally closer than the average elder.

Mu Jianfei had been pampered since he was a child, and mu Hua loved and took care of this little nephew of his very much. Mu Jianfei and mu Hua had a very deep relationship.

When mu Hua’s grievous news came, mu Jianfei felt that the sect had suffered a great loss, but he also fell into great grief, unable to extricate himself.

Xia ruofei could understand how they felt, including the first heaven society. Even though Shen tianfang deserved to die, he was Shen tianfang and Chen Xuan was Chen Xuan. As long as the first heaven society did not find out, Xia ruofei would definitely keep it to himself. He did not even mention Ling Qingxue.

However, Ling Qingxue knew that he could summon his companions to his side, so he didn’t know if she had any guesses.

But no matter what, Ling Qingxue was definitely on his side.

Considering the actual situation of Chen Xuan and the rest, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue took the initiative to take on the duty for the first day, while Yang Liu and Yu Xin ‘er would take on the second day. From the third day onwards, the first heaven society and the Cang lang society would be assigned to take on the duty.

Even though the black Phoenix flying ship was the main driving force, the ship itself was still equipped with a lot of sophisticated equipment, including equipment that could provide oxygen at any time. The seal of the cabin was also very important. Once there was an explosion and the pressure was lost, it could be fatal to a refinement stage cultivator. Everything that Xia ruofei had experienced in the illusion could really happen in reality.

Therefore, during the return trip, everyone took turns to be on duty to ensure that there was someone in the return cabin monitoring the status of the entire spaceship.

However, without Shen tianfang and muhua, everyone’s living space was a little bigger, but they had to take more shifts.

After everyone had settled down, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue sat in the small return cabin of the spaceship. Ling Qingxue adjusted the frequency on her spacesuit and smiled.”Ruofei, we’re finally on the return journey! This experience was really too exciting!”

The communication system of the spacesuit was actually a normal radio system. The spacesuit provided by masker could listen to two frequencies at the same time, and only one frequency could be transmitted.

In other words, if someone were to speak on two frequencies, they could be heard in the headset of the spacesuit, but if he were to speak on one frequency, he would have to manually adjust it.

Xia ruofei and the others would listen to the same frequency, which was equivalent to the public frequency of the exploration team. Just now, Ling Qingxue had adjusted the frequency to another preset frequency. Only she and Xia ruofei were on this frequency, so the privacy of the call was guaranteed.

It was similar to a wide – range public channel and a small – range channel. In fact, Chen Xuan and the others were the same. Cultivators from the same sect would also set up a private channel for communication.

Xia ruofei was about to change out of his EVA suit. After all, the return cabin was narrow and it would make him look clumsy in it.

In fact, even during rocket take – off and return capsule landing, astronauts didn’t wear spacesuits.

However, Xia ruofei saw that Ling Qingxue was using the walkie – talkie system to talk to him. To ensure privacy, he also adjusted the transmission frequency of his spacesuit to a private frequency.

The sound was transmitted through the air. The air pressure in the spaceship was the same as on earth, so it was full of air. Therefore, even though the sound insulation of the cabin door was very good, it was still possible for cultivators to hear it if they really wanted to eavesdrop.

If they were speaking through the thick EVA suit and the airtight hatch between the return cabin and the living cabin, it would be impossible for anyone to eavesdrop.

Ling Qingxue had probably considered this point as well, which was why she was in no hurry to take off her EVA suit. She was still not very familiar with telepathy, and if she didn’t do it well, it would become a live broadcast.

“Qingxue, do you have something to say that you’re trying to avoid me?” Xia ruofei smiled.

Ling Qingxue giggled and said,”so smart!” RUO Fei, 1 just want to tell you that although 1 was eliminated at the heavenly stairs, 1 still survived and received a very generous reward! Can you guess what the prize is?”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”how can 1 guess?” But seeing how happy you are, the prize must not be simple, right?”

Ling Qingxue chuckled and said,”why don’t you guess?” You’ve come into contact with it in the trial Pagoda!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”I’ve come into contact with it in the trial Pagoda?” That was none other than … The Vermillion Jade Fruit? Origin crystals? Yellow jade Spirit?”

“Correct!” Ling Qingxue said happily,”RUO Fei, Did you know? When I was teleported out of the trial Pagoda, 1 found a storage ring in my hand. There were 8oo yellow jade essence in it! And the prizes are directly stored in the storage ring. This ring must be worth a lot!”

“Look at you, you’ve never seen the world!” Xia ruofei teased.

“Don’t make fun of me!” Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”l just haven’t seen the world! The yellow jade essence was a good thing! Isn’t your spiritual power still one step away? These yellow jade spirits should be of some help! But… I’m still wondering if 1 can leave the yellow jade essence to Wei Wei! With the Vermilion Jade Fruit and the yellow jade essence, her cultivation can at least be raised to my level! You need it too, and Wei Wei needs it too. How are we going to split it? If you each take half, the effect won’t be enough …”

Xia ruofei was touched when he saw Ling Qingxue’s troubled look. She was struggling to decide whether to use the Topaz essence on Xia ruofei’s blade or to help Song Wei improve her spiritual power as soon as possible. She had never thought of keeping it for herself.

He reached out his slightly bloated arm, which was covered by the spacesuit, and gently touched Ling Qingxue’s helmet. He smiled and said,””Silly girl! There’s no need to be so conflicted! If you want, you can give it to Wei Wei, or you can keep it for yourself. Wei Wei won’t say anything! I don’t need it. My spiritual power has already broken through to the spiritualization boundary, so even if I continue to use the Topaz essence, it won’t improve much.”

“But you’re also …” Ling Qingxue didn’t react at first, but her eyes suddenly widened and she cried out,”ah? Really? RUO Fei, you …”

At this point, Ling Qingxue realized that her voice had been a little too loud. She quickly lowered her voice and asked,””RUO Fei, you’ve really broken through to the spiritualization boundary? Didn’t they say that it was very difficult to break through to the next realm? Why so sudden?” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”how could 1 lie to you about this?” He had really broken through, and it was on the Obsidian rooftop! Your husband is amazing, right?”

When Xia ruofei said that he had broken through on the stairway, Ling Qingxue had already believed him.

Because she had experienced the Obsidian stairs before, even though it was only the stairs for Qi refining cultivators, the principle was the same. She had personally felt the spiritual pressure and resisted it with all her strength, so she was very clear how terrible that pressure was. She also knew that if she could withstand the pressure, she would definitely improve.

It was because her own spiritual power had also been improved after going through the Obsidian stairway. However, because she did not persist for too long under that extreme pressure, and her spiritual power was not at a bottleneck, the extent of the improvement was not big.

Ling Qingxue’s eyes reddened as she thought about this. She asked,””RUO Fei, you must have suffered a lot on the stairway…. It took you such a long time to come out, which means you must have been suffering on the stairway for a few hours!”
