Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei and Zheng Yongshou left the Tao Yuan building. However, he did not go to the Tao Yuan farm immediately. Instead, he drove the Knight XV SUV to the warehouse in the city that he had bought.

Xia ruofei parked his car in front of the warehouse and took out the warehouse key from the spirit map space. As he opened the door, he said,””Elder Zheng, you have to remember the location of this warehouse. You should come here often in the future. Whether it’s the raw materials of Chinese medicine or the Drunken Eight Immortals wine, this warehouse will be the transfer point for the handover.”

“I understand, Mr. Xia!” Zheng Yongshou said respectfully.

Xia ruofei opened the warehouse door and walked in first. Then, he signaled Zheng Yongshou to lock the door from the inside.

He directly took out a storage ring from the spirit map space, erased his own spiritual imprint, and handed it to Zheng Yongshou.

Zheng Yongshou was stunned for a moment, then he quickly waved his hand and said,””M – Mr. Xia, this is a storage ring, right? It’s too precious, I don’t dare to take it!”

If it were a few months ago, a storage ring would indeed be more precious to Xia ruofei. However, his vision was much higher now. In the mystic Luna realm’s trial tower, he and Ling Qingxue had already obtained several storage rings. These storage rings were nothing more than loading tools used to store rewards. They were not even rewards.

Xia ruofei also knew that in the eyes of those powerful cultivators, storage rings were nothing. They were just ordinary tools. Thus, his standards naturally became higher.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Elder Zheng, this is for your work. If you don’t take a storage ring, how are you going to complete the transfer and exchange of goods?” Zheng Yongshou couldn’t help but be stunned.

That’s right! By then, Xia ruofei would probably spend most of his time on Peach Blossom Island, and he would have to bring supplies from Peach Blossom Island to the three mountains every month. These supplies included a huge amount of Chinese medicinal herbs and large jars of fine wine. If he were to transport them by plane, it would be very troublesome. Moreover, he still had to hand over the new wine to Xia ruofei. Was he supposed to transport them back by air?

Therefore, storage rings were an essential tool for this job.

Xia ruofei smiled and passed the storage ring to Zheng Yongshou, saying,””Hurry up and take it!”

Zheng Yongshou then hesitantly took the storage ring and carefully held it in his hand, for fear of breaking it.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but find it funny when he saw him like this.

Xia ruofei said,”don’t worry!” With your cultivation, even if you wanted to destroy this storage ring, you wouldn’t be able to do it! What are you still doing? Hurry up and recognize me as your master!”

“Oh! Yes, sir!” Only then did Zheng Yongshou come back to his senses and hurriedly recognized the storage ring as his master.

Xia ruofei said calmly,”this ring contains the Chinese medicinal herbs that will be handed over to the pharmaceutical factory. Come over earlier tomorrow morning and take the medicinal herbs out of the storage ring. Then, wait until eighto’ clock to hand over the herbs to the pharmaceutical factory.” In the future, whether it’s medicinal herbs, white wine, Cordyceps, truffle, tea leaves, or anything else, use this method to transport and hand over, understand?” “Understood!” Zheng Yongshou quickly said.

He used his spiritual power to scan the ring and found that it was filled with Chinese medicinal herbs. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

In reality, Xia ruofei had already considered the possibility of a shortage of medicinal ingredients in the pharmaceutical factory. Thus, two days ago, he had asked Xia Qing to bring the free labor to the mountain sea realm’s medicinal garden to harvest the medicinal herbs with all her might. Xia Qing personally led a small group of people to carry out the follow – up processing, so the Chinese medicinal herbs in the storage ring were all processed. They could directly put it into production after taking it from the pharmaceutical factory.

Zheng Yongshou suddenly realized that in addition to a large amount of Chinese medicinal herbs, there was also a crystal with rich spiritual Qi. He couldn’t help but be stunned for a moment, then quickly took out the crystal and handed it to Xia ruofei while saying,””Mr. Xia, there’s another piece here …” “These are spirit crystals. They help with cultivation.” Xia ruofei said indifferently,”this time, transferring you from the star Seizer sect to the secular world will definitely affect your cultivation, especially since the spiritual Qi here is very chaotic and violent. You can’t cultivate at any other time except for midnight and dawn. So, I’ve prepared a spiritual crystal for you. This way, you can more or less make up for it.”

“Master!” Zheng Yongshou quickly replied. How could this be allowed? It was a subordinate’s duty to serve the master, so how could he ask for compensation? Master, you should quickly take it back!”

Although Xia ruofei had so many spiritual crystals that he couldn’t use them all up, and he even disliked elemental crystals, let alone spiritual crystals with lower spiritual Qi content, there was no doubt that spiritual crystals were very precious to cultivators like Zheng Yongshou.

From Zheng Yongshou’s point of view, serving his master was a matter of course, so how could he dare to ask for any compensation? In his anxiety, he had forgotten that Xia ruofei had ordered him to address him as Mr. Xia instead of ‘master’. The word ‘master’ had escaped his mouth.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Spiritual crystals aren’t that precious. Besides, you call me master. As your master, I’m giving you something.. Are you going to reject it?”
