2164 The gospel of the survivors (1)

In fact, after Puyol’s child, John, was soaked in the sea last night and was blown by the cold wind on the beach, he had already started to have a fever before dawn. Puyol had been a little confused when he heard that there was hope for him to return to human society.

Now that Xia ruofei had reminded him, he immediately came to his senses and quickly said,””Lord Divine immortal, please save John!”

Xia ruofei frowned and said,”let’s leave this place first!” The wind on the beach is too strong, let’s find a place to hide from the wind and set up camp first!”

“Yes, yes, yes!” Puyol hurriedly said,”Lord Divine immortal, please follow me!”

After being stranded on the deserted island for so many years, Puyol was already very familiar with the terrain near the camp. Now that the survivor’s camp was in a bad state and there was blood and flesh everywhere, he would naturally not return to that sad place.

Hence, Puyol brought Xia ruofei along the beach for a few minutes and arrived behind a huge rock.

There were also a few smaller reefs here, which formed a gap with the large reef in front. It was a bit similar to the structure of a cave, which could block the wind and rain.

After Xia ruofei entered the cave, he found a dry and comfortable place and took down the single – person tent that was tied to the top of his backpack. He set up the tent skillfully and took out a down – feathered sleeping bag from his backpack. He unzipped it and laid it out in the tent.

“Let your child go!” Xia ruofei said,”I should have some fever medicine in my bag. Let me look for it first!”

“Yes, yes, yes! Thank you, Daoist immortal!” Puyol said with tears of gratitude.

Xia ruofei rummaged through his bag and quickly took out a bottle of child – use fever medicine, Meilin, and a bottle of mineral water.

This was naturally taken out from the space. Before he went out to sea, he had purchased a large amount of food, drinking water, medicine, and so on, which were all stored in the space. This bottle of Meilin was also casually bought when he was shopping, and he did not expect it to come in handy here.

The child’s forehead was so hot that he didn’t need to take his temperature to know that he had a high fever. It was definitely right to take the fever medicine directly.

Of course, Xia ruofei could also use a small amount of the spirit Heart Flower petal solution to help Little John recover. However, Xia ruofei was more and more inclined to use conventional medical methods to solve the problem. In John’s case, he could completely lower his fever first. If he had a fever again, he could take some anti – inflammatory medicine and the problem would be solved quickly.

After all, the petals of the spirit Heart Flower were also a precious resource, so he should use them as little as possible.

On this deserted island, fever medicine and antibiotics were extremely precious because they had no ability to produce them. When they first landed on the deserted island, even if they had a small amount of medicine, it would have been used up after so many years.

It could be said that in a place like this, once one fell sick, even if it was a common illness in the outside world, it could be life – threatening. In the past few years, several survivors had lost their lives due to diseases such as pneumonia.

When pyol saw the special fever medicine, he quickly took it with thanks.

Xia ruofei asked for John’s age and weight. Then, he read the Chinese manual and told Puyol the best dosage. He would leave the rest to him.

Xia ruofei asked Puyol to take care of John first, while the remaining survivors were arranged to return to their previous camp and pack up the tools that could still be used.

The next step was to build a wooden raft, so he would definitely need these tools.

Xia ruofei went to the dense forest and began to cut down some trees for packing. If Puyol and the others were to use their simple tools, who knew when they would be able to get the required wood.

No one had come to this green Immortal Island for many years. Although the core of the island was the green immortal mansion and the trees on the island were ordinary trees, there were many thick trees, some of which were huge enough for several people to wrap their arms around.

Of course, Xia ruofei did not need such large wood. He chose those with a diameter of 40 to 50 centimeters. Even with such wood, it would take a lot of effort for Puyol and the rest to transport it to the beach and assemble it into a raft.

Of course, Xia ruofei was not prepared to let them transport the wood.

Xia ruofei cut the tree with ease. After choosing the wood, he took out the blue travel immortal sword and drew a circle around the bottom of the tree. The tree fell with a loud crash. The cut was extremely smooth.

The trees that Xia ruofei had chosen were roughly the same in thickness so that it would be easier to build the raft.

In a short while, he had already cut down twenty to thirty big trees with ease.

Xia ruofei felt that there should be enough wood, so he kept the wood into the spirit map space. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Then, Xia ruofei went into the forest and used the blue travel immortal sword to cut off many tough and thick old vines. He kept them in his space as well.

After preparing the materials for the raft, Xia ruofei strolled out of the forest. He didn’t need to use his hands during the whole process. He used his spiritual energy to control the celestial sword to cut wood and vines, and then kept them in the medium.

He wondered what bi youzi would think if he saw Xia ruofei using his blue travel immortal sword to cut wood.

Xia ruofei kept all the wood and vines in the Archean realm. He wanted to make use of the time flow in the Archean realm to make these materials as dry as possible.

In this case, after the raft was tied up and pushed into the sea, the wood and rattan would expand and tighten when it came into contact with water, making the raft extremely secure.
