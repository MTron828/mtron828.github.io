Xia ruofei went straight upstairs to his room. It was already past the time for his afternoon nap. Xia ruofei was not sleepy, so he locked the door and entered the spirit map space.

The moment he entered the space, Xia ruofei saw Xia Qing moving the tea trees.

As soon as Xia Qing saw Xia ruofei, she was about to come over to greet him. Xia ruofei waved his hand to signal him to continue working, and then drove the all – terrain vehicle to the beach.

He released his divine telekinesis to sense carefully. More than 11000 net abalone seedlings had settled down in the shallow area, and they were evenly distributed.

They mainly lived on the reefs in shallow waters and fed on seaweed and floating microorganisms in the sea.

The water of the space ocean was rich in spiritual Qi. Xia ruofei could sense that the little abalones were very pleased.

Xia ruofei retracted his divine thoughts and looked at the big orange plastic box on the beach. Suddenly, he had an idea.

The big plastic box was used to store the net abalone seedlings. After he was done with the breeding, Xia ruofei left the medium without cleaning up.

If he could get a few abalones and raise them at the Archean realm, what would the effects be? Xia ruofei suddenly had this thought.

The land area of the Archean realm was relatively small, but the concentration of spiritual energy was much higher than that of the mountain and sea realm. Most importantly, there was the effect of increasing the flow of time there, which allowed Xia ruofei to see the results of the experiment faster.

After all, there were more than 10000 abalone fry in the sea. If the experiment failed, he would only lose a few, which was not even a drop in the ocean. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Xia ruofei immediately released his thoughts and used the invisible force of space to absorb the seawater into the big orange plastic box.

At the same time, some sand and algae from the bottom of the sea were also absorbed. Xia ruofei even absorbed a few smaller rocks.

There were already more than a dozen abalone fry attached to the reef. Xia ruofei had specially taken more than a dozen, making a total of 30.

Then, with a thought, Xia ruofei brought the large plastic box into the Archean realm. With Xia ruofei’s current mental strength, moving such a heavy object was a piece of cake.

Xia ruofei placed the large plastic box beside the spatial spirit pond and poured in a small bottle of spirit Heart Flower petal solution.

After that, Xia ruofei returned to the mountain and sea realm, and directly appeared beside Xia Qing.

“Xia Qing, remember to change the seawater in the large plastic box I placed at the Archean realm three times a day.” Xia ruofei said,”also, pour in a small bottle of the spirit Heart Flower petal solution every seven days.”

The daily that Xia ruofei was talking about was naturally referring to the time in the mountain sea realm. This was basically equivalent to changing the water every ten days in the Archean realm.

In the ten days, the spirit Heart Flower petal solution that was poured in the first time would have been completely absorbed by the little abalones.

Although this water changing cycle seemed to be a bit long, if the frequency was higher, Xia Qing’s normal work would be easily interfered with.

Besides, the environment in the space was so good and the spiritual Qi was so dense. The seawater was also different from the seawater outside. Xia ruofei thought that changing the water every ten days should be enough.

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing replied without any hesitation.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”Oh, right. When you change the water, pay attention to the condition of the abalone fry in the box. If you feel that they are not in good condition, change the water once or twice a day.”

“Understood!”

Xia ruofei patted Xia Qing on the shoulder and left the spirit map space.

……

In the next few days, everyone in paradise Corporation was busy as usual.

Qin Xiaojun and the rest were busy with the production of the iron – skinned maples while Feng Jing quickly took out the plan for the establishment of the e – commerce Department. After discussing it with her administrative team, she quickly reported it to Xia ruofei. After Xia ruofei approved it, a new round of recruitment was launched.

Paradise Corporation was no longer what it used to be. It was quite famous in the southeast province, so this recruitment wasn’t as awkward as the first time. There were still many people who submitted their resumes.

Xia ruofei was used to being a hands – off manager for these specific matters. He let Feng Jing be in charge of the recruitment of staff.

In just a few days, the e – commerce Department under the sales department was established, and Lin Qiao also began her internship in the e – commerce Department.

The application materials for the store upgrade were quickly submitted to the Skycat mall. The newly recruited experienced web designer did not idle around. Before the store upgrade was approved, he began to redesign the entire store’s page.

Lin Qiao learned from the two web designers and improved very quickly. The two female designers knew that Lin Qiao was the boss ‘sister, so they taught her very carefully and almost helped her step by step. This was naturally much more efficient than Lin Qiao learning by herself.

At the same time, the employees of the pharmaceutical company who were recruited quickly got back to work, and Xue Jinshan, who was overwrought, could finally take a breather.

On the third day, Xia ruofei brought three pairs of blood – Red Dragons to Ling Xiaotian’s Villa as promised.

The quality of the three pairs of blood – Red Dragons was as high as ever, but there was no bright purple dragon. In fact, there were bright purple Dragons in Xia ruofei’s spatial fish pond, but they were very rare. If two pairs of bright purple Dragons were auctioned consecutively, it would inevitably arouse suspicion. Hence, Xia ruofei did it on purpose.
