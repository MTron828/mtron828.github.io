“I know, I know, I won’t spread it out,” Fang Liyun quickly replied.

Song Qiming turned to Guangzhi Cao and Zhang.””You guys too, just keep this matter to yourself.”

“Understood, Secretary song,” uncle Zhang replied immediately.

Guangzhi Cao’s heart was also surging, and he quickly said, “I’ll remember that, Secretary. Don’t worry, I won’t say anything. ”

……

After Xia ruofei left song Qiming’s house, he drove back to Taoyuan farm.

Because of the thirty times time flow, Xia Qing had already prepared the fifty pills that Xia ruofei needed.

However, Xia ruofei did not plan to take it out so quickly.

Firstly, Song Wei had just fainted once. According to the usual pattern, the poison would only act up after a few days. Furthermore, he had left half a bottle of spirit Heart Flower petal solution for song Qiming. Even if Song Wei fainted again, she would not be in any danger.

Secondly, the poison was so difficult to deal with. It was a little unreasonable to take out the right treatment medicine so quickly. It would be more credible to give the pills to song Qiming and the others after a few days.

When Xia ruofei returned to the farm, Hu Zi’s mother had just finished preparing lunch. He, Hu Zi’s mother, and Lin Qiao had lunch together and returned to his room. He took out his phone and was about to contact President Lin of Tongren Hall.

“President Xia!” Mr. Lin was very enthusiastic. He said with a smile,”is there a new iron Kaede bucket?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”CEO Lin, there’s still a long way to go before we can get the goods.” Aren’t you a little too impatient?”

President Lin said, a little embarrassed,””President Xia, it’s mainly because your company’s iron – skinned Kaede is selling so well. We have so many stores all over the country, and every time the goods arrive, we give everyone a share. It’s sold out in a few days. I didn’t know that there were so many rich people in China. As long as the goods are good, they don’t even blink when they spend money!”

“Isn’t that good?” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”the more rich people there are, the more we earn. Furthermore, these nourishing herbs are all consumables. The better the efficacy, the more returning customers we will have!”

“Isn’t it? Those regular customers are urging me to get the goods every day. ” President Lin said,”we’ve already sold out all our stock. Where would we have any more for them!”

“Hahaha! This is a happy problem ...”Xia ruofei said.” But I can’t help you, President Lin. Our raw material production is limited. We’ve already done our best to maintain the current supply cycle and scale!”

Actually, Xia ruofei had reserved some goods. However, their company’s online store was about to be relaunched. How could they not reserve some of the best goods? Therefore, it was absolutely impossible to give this stock to President Lin.

CEO Lin knew that Xia ruofei had the final say. As long as Xia ruofei supplied the goods according to the contract, he would not be able to find any fault with it. Hence, he could only complain.

“Director Xia,” President Lin said with a smile,”since it’s not about the iron Kaede fight, there must be other opportunities to make a fortune for me?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”didn’t you tell me about the aweto last time ...”

“Wormgrass?” President Lin suddenly became energetic and said quickly,”President Xia, Tongren Hall will buy all the wormgrass you have! We can follow the old rules and use your brand and packaging. Our Tongren Hall will provide the channel and only collect a certain sales share. ”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”President Lin, you don’t even know the quality of my wormgrass, and you’re in such a hurry to be the agent?”

President Lin chuckled and said,”brother Xia, when has your paradise Corporation ever produced anything of low quality?” I have confidence in you, brother Xia!”

Xia ruofei had a faint smile on his face.””Mr. Lin, I’ve used almost all of my channels after you mentioned it last time. I’ve finally found some clues recently. I’ve brought back some samples these past two days, so I’d like to ask you and the experts from Tongren Hall to help identify it and estimate the price.”

When President Lin heard this, he said without hesitation,””No problem! President Xia, I’ll book a ticket immediately and fly over in the afternoon ...”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, then he laughed and said,””President Lin, this ... We’re not in such a hurry, are we? You can come over whenever you’re free ...”

“My brother Xia!” President Lin said. You’re not in a hurry, but I ‘m! I have a feeling that this is another super high – Quality source, I don’t want others to get it first!”

“Brother Xia, let’s talk when we meet,” President Lin said.”I’ll book the plane ticket first ...”

“AI! Mr. Lin, remember to tell me the flight number ...”

Xia ruofei was only halfway through his sentence when he heard the busy toot from the phone. Xia ruofei could not help but smile bitterly. He could imagine CEO Lin’s flustered look.

However, since President Lin was so enthusiastic, Xia ruofei could not stop him from coming. Hence, he sent him a WeChat message and asked him to send him the flight number after booking the ticket so that he could arrange for someone to pick him up.

Within a few minutes, Xia ruofei received the flight information from CEO Lin. It was a flight at 1:30 p.m. And would arrive at San Shan at around 3 p.m.

Hence, Xia ruofei forwarded the flight details to Lei Hu and gave him a call to ask him to pick her up at the airport on time.

It was not Lei Hu’s first time picking up CEO Lin. Everyone already knew each other, so Xia ruofei did not have to give him any special instructions.

Xia ruofei took a short break in the afternoon and walked slowly to the company’s general office building at threeo’ clock. Lin Qiao had already come to work by then. Compared to the diligent intern, Xia ruofei was too lazy as a boss.

However, everyone was already used to Xia ruofei’s style. On the contrary, if Xia ruofei went to work and left work on time, the employees would find it very strange.

Xia ruofei sat in his office for a while before he received a call from Lei Hu, telling him that the car was about to reach the farm.

Hence, Xia ruofei got up and went downstairs. After waiting for a minute or two, the black Mercedes – Benz from the company arrived in front of the building.

President Lin did not wait for Lei Hu to open the door for him. He pushed the door open and got out of the car. Then, he walked quickly towards Xia ruofei and extended his hand from afar. He said enthusiastically,”Brother Xia, why did you come down personally to wait for me? I don’t deserve it, I don’t deserve it!”

“Mr. Lin,” Xia ruofei said with a smile,”you’ve come all the way here to help me. It’s only right that I come to welcome you.”

Then, Xia ruofei gave a friendly nod to the person behind President Lin. This time, President Lin had brought the old Chinese medical doctor with the surname Huang. Everyone was familiar with each other.

After some small talk, Xia ruofei invited Mr. Lin and Dr. Huang to his office.

“Brother Xia, where are the wormgrass?” As soon as President Lin entered the door, he said impatiently,”let us open our eyes first!”

Xia ruofei had wanted to make them a cup of tea, but seeing how anxious CEO Lin was, he smiled and put down the cup. He walked to the safe in the corner, entered the password, and verified his fingerprint. Then, he took out the small plastic arranging box that he had put in the afternoon.

There were about 600 pieces of high – Quality aweto inside.

Xia ruofei opened the lid and pushed the small plastic box in front of director Lin and doctor Huang. He smiled and said,””You two, I’ll have to trouble you to help me take a good look at the price of this aweto.”

When Mr. Lin and Dr. Huang’s eyes fell on the small box of Cordyceps, their eyes immediately widened, and their faces revealed a look of disbelief ...
