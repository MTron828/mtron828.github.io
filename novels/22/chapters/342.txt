Chapter 343: Using both soft and hard tactics (3)

“Qingxue, are you in the office?” Xia ruofei asked directly,”I want to see you.” “I’m busy right now!” Ling Qingxue giggled.”What’s the matter?” “Can’t I find you for no reason?” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”wife, are you still angry? There’s nothing wrong with it, it’s not worth it to get angry and damage your body!” “Who’s angry?” Ling Qingxue was stubborn.”I can’t be bothered to be angry with you! How popular are you, miracle doctor Xia, among the girls? If I hadn’t chased after you, you would probably be surrounded by women now, right?” Ling Qingxue’s tone was still bitter. In fact, Ling Qingxue was a little sensitive about this issue. The main reason was that she had always been the one who took the initiative when it came to matters of the heart. She had had a crush on Xia ruofei since middle school. After they had reunited at the end of last year, she had always been the one who took the initiative. It could be said that Ling Qingxue’s “initiative” was definitely inseparable from the fact that the two of them were finally able to get together. It was precisely because of this that Ling Qingxue had a sense of inferiority when it came to their relationship problems. It was precisely this small sense of inferiority that made Ling Qingxue feel a sense of crisis. Hence, when Lu You and Jiang Yue appeared, her jealousy was magnified many times. Xia ruofei said,”don’t let your thoughts run wild!” What the hell is this! Qingxue, I must see you today! If you don’t come out, I’ll go to the company to find you!” “Then come! My dad is here too!” Ling Qingxue said with a mischievous smile. “Alright!” Xia ruofei immediately said,”I was just about to report to uncle Ling and ask him if the winery cooperation is still going on. Why is our manager Ling dragging things out and not willing to sign the contract with me!” “You ...” Ling Qingxue pouted,”you Rascal ...” Regarding the contract, Ling Qingxue had really kept it a secret from Ling Xiaotian. Ling Xiaotian was still very concerned about the winery’s cooperation. He had asked Ling Qingxue about it three days ago, but she had brushed him off, saying that the contract had already been signed, but she had not had the time to file it. Because of Ling Qingxue and Xia ruofei’s relationship, Ling Xiaotian was very confident about this cooperation. He also believed in Ling Qingxue’s words without a doubt and did not ask about the contract for the next few days. If Xia ruofei really went to the company to mention this to Ling Xiaotian, wouldn’t he be exposed? Xia ruofei had also guessed it. He laughed and said,””Wife, it’s almost time for lunch. I’ve already booked a private room in Xi Jiang Yue. Let’s have lunch together and sign the contract!” “Then you’re not allowed to talk to my dad about the contract!” Ling Qingxue pouted. Xia ruofei laughed and said,”don’t worry!” I’ll be waiting for you at West River moon!” “Rascal ...” Ling Qingxue pouted and hung up the phone. At the Ling Ji F & B headquarters, Ling Qingxue held her phone to her chest and couldn’t help but burst out laughing. Her pretty face also flushed red, and her smile bloomed like a flower. It made the entire office feel as if it was bathed in a spring breeze. In fact, she had wanted to contact Xia ruofei for a long time, but a girl’s self – restraint made her hold back. Today, Xia ruofei called and “used both hard and soft tactics”. Naturally, she went with the flow and agreed. “Let’s see if you still dare to be a Playboy in the future!” Ling Qingxue’s lips curled up as she muttered to herself. Xia ruofei was humming a song as he drove. He turned the car around and drove towards the West River Moon Club. On the way there, he gave President Zheng a call and booked a private room. Then, he drove to the West River Moon Club and exchanged a few words with President Zheng, who had personally come out to welcome him. After that, he went to the Xiaoyue room that President Zheng had arranged for him and sat down to wait for Ling Qingxue.
