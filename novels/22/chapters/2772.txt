As he had spent quite some time in the warehouse, it was already two in the afternoon when Xia ruofei returned to the villa. He made some noodles for lunch, then went to the balcony upstairs. He took out his single – lens reflex camera and tripod from his space. After finding the right angle, he turned on the camera, sat down on the outdoor chair opposite him, and started to record a video.

After recording a few times, Xia ruofei finally stood up in satisfaction. He took out the memory card from the camera and his laptop. He started to edit the video on the balcony.

In the evening, the netizens who had followed Xia ruofei’s account on Weibo and today’s headline platform saw the video that Xia ruofei had posted.

In the video, Xia ruofei was sitting on a spacious balcony. Behind him was the beautiful blue sky and white clouds, as well as the scenery of Min River.

Xia ruofei was dressed in casual clothes. He smiled in front of the camera and said,””Hello everyone, I’m your good friend, Xia ruofei. I’ve been busy with some personal matters during this time and didn’t pay attention to the situation on the internet. It was only today that our company’s President Feng reminded me that everyone had also initiated a vote for the Chinese Football Association to call me to join the national football association, and the Chinese Football Association also sent out an invitation. First of all, I would like to thank all the netizens for their love and the trust of the Chinese Football Association in me!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei adjusted his sitting position and continued,””I really didn’t expect that my appearance in Espanyol for fun would attract so much attention. I was a little scared. The Spanish clubs once hoped that I could play for the team regularly every week, but it was not realistic because everyone knows that I am not a professional player. I usually have to manage a company, and coupled with some of my personal affairs, so I often fly around the world. It is really difficult to guarantee that I can go to Spain to play once every weekend. That’s why this time it’s the same for the national team. However ...”

Xia ruofei suddenly changed the topic and said seriously,””It’s my duty to serve the country! I used to be a soldier and I know that the honor of the country is above all else, so I will officially respond to the invitation of the Chinese Football Association. If the national team needs me and if my participation can help the national team, then I am willing to accept the recruitment and join the national football association!”

At the end of the video, Xia ruofei said,”Of course, for reasons that everyone knows, I may not be able to follow the team the entire time like other professional players. I also hope that the Chinese Football Association can consider my actual situation and make appropriate arrangements for me. Of course, these are all details. I have already let the company contact the Chinese Football Association. I believe that the two sides should be able to reach a consensus soon! Finally, let’s wish Chinese football good luck! I hope that the Chinese football team can make it into the finals of the Qatar World Cup and live up to the care and love of the fans over the years!”

The video ended there. Xia ruofei did not make any heroic remarks. He spoke about some of his practical difficulties as they were. His tone was not as impassioned, but he received high praise from the majority of netizens.

Of course, after Xia ruofei uploaded the video to Weibo and posted it on the headlines, he didn’t care about ran ran anymore. He quickly went to cook as Ling Qingxue would be coming over for dinner after work.

Although Ling Xiaotian had readily agreed to his daughter’s request for a long leave of absence, Ling Qingxue still went to the company today. After all, she had been in charge of the company’s specific Affairs during this period of time. This time, she had to be away for so many days, and there were many things that needed to be handed over clearly.

Considering that the two of them would be flying to the capital the next day and would be heading to Peach Blossom Island if everything went well, Xia ruofei did not make many dishes and only made three dishes and a soup to avoid wasting food. Of course, the ingredients were of the highest quality. Besides, Xia ruofei’s cooking skills had improved. There was another benefit after cultivation. He could use his mental strength to control the heat. It was quite accurate. This allowed the taste of Xia ruofei’s dishes to reach a higher level.

Ling Qingxue’s mouth was full of oil as she ate. She didn’t even consider the problem of getting fat if she ate too much. In fact, after becoming a cultivator, this problem didn’t need to be considered. No matter how much she ate, it could be converted into energy. Some unhealthy impurities could be completely discharged from the body as long as she cultivated.

After the two of them finished eating, they directly threw the remaining food into the trash can. Then, they washed the dishes and cleaned the refrigerator together, preparing for the long journey.

The two of them had just finished cooking in the kitchen and were about to take a rest in the living room when Xia ruofei’s phone rang. It was Feng Jing.

Feng Rao and Ling Qingxue had a good personal relationship, and Ling Qingxue knew that she was Xia ruofei’s right – hand man. Hence, Xia ruofei did not have to hide anything from Ling Qingxue and picked up the call.

“Sister che, have you eaten?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“I just finished!” Feng Rao replied. He couldn’t be bothered to eat! Ruofei, the entire company’s public relations department has been mobilized, and I’m personally overseeing it, all for the video you posted this afternoon!”

Xia ruofei laughed,”no way!” Was it really that exaggerated? Didn’t I just post a Weibo video? I thought it’d be more sincere to post a video than a normal proposal or statement. I have some free time in the afternoon, so I did it myself. I hope it won’t cause you any trouble?”
