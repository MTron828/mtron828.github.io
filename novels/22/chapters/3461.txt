Chapter 3462: Target: Reach the top (2)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei didn’t know that his every move was being watched by two powerful cultivators. Even if he did, he couldn’t care about anything else now because he had to concentrate all his energy to fight against the terrifying pressure. He couldn’t afford to have any distracting thoughts.

At four hundred and eighty, Xia ruofei was still standing steadily.

Xia ruofei’s every step seemed to be difficult and shaky as if he would be eliminated at any time.

Xia ruofei’s every step was creating history, but he didn’t know it.

Now, he had to stay at each level for at least ten minutes before he could barely adjust. However, perfected Shan He and Qing Xuan Taoist priest were not impatient at all. Instead, they were secretly cheering for Xia ruofei.

After all, he was the strongest cultivator in the Golden core stage in history. As long as such a genius did not die halfway, he would definitely grow up to be a pillar of support for a region. Especially in the unstable world of cultivation, the value of such a talent could be imagined.

Unknowingly, Xia ruofei had already reached Level 499.

This was far beyond the expectations of the immortal mountain river and the Taoist priest Qing Xuan.

Even when immortal mountain river guessed that Xia ruofei could reach level 480, he had exaggerated. He did not want to be weak in front of Taoist Qing Xuan.

They did not expect Xia ruofei to be so resilient and directly rush towards the level 500 stage.

Of course, Reverend Shan He noticed that Xia ruofei had used the petals of the spirit Heart Flower several times to heal his injuries. The space of the spirit map was given to Xia ruofei by Reverend Shan He. The precious spirit heart tree was also a big gift from Reverend Shan He to Xia ruofei. Of course, he knew the wonderful use of the petals of the spirit Heart Flower.

It was also because of this that Daoist master mountain river admired this disciple of his even more.

It was obvious that Xia ruofei’s bone armor could no longer withstand the pressure and was cracking. Otherwise, why would Xia ruofei keep using the petals of the spirit Heart Flower?

His bones were broken in many places, and he was constantly under great pressure. One could imagine the pain.

However, Xia ruofei’s face was filled with determination and decisiveness. He rarely showed any signs of pain. He would only clench his teeth, close his lips, and move forward step by step.

In fact, even immortal Shanhe did not expect that Xia ruofei would find that his body was getting stronger under such a terrifying pressure.

Especially the broken bones, after being repaired by the spirit Heart Flower petals, the strength of the bones was clearly a bit stronger than before.

This was also one of the main reasons why Xia ruofei had been able to persevere until now.

Of course, ordinary people could not bear this kind of pain. Even if they knew that the stairway to heaven was very good for tempering the body, they could not do it to Xia ruofei’s extent.

Xia ruofei took a few deep breaths and stood still on the 499th step.

The next step was the five hundredth step.

According to his experience, this step would be a huge pit, and the increase in pressure in all aspects would suddenly increase.

Under the current circumstances, a single mishap could result in a complete loss.

Xia ruofei stood firmly on the 499th step. His eyes were filled with determination. As he circulated the “great Dao technique” to control his vital Qi, he consciously released a trace of vital Qi to protect himself. He deliberately guided more of the squeezing force to temper his body.

Xia ruofei’s action was undoubtedly very bold.

Under the pressure of this stairway, it was very difficult for an ordinary person to maintain a clear mind and calm thinking. Furthermore, they would definitely use all their strength to protect their body with their Yuan Qi. Who would dare to take the initiative to lower the strength of their Yuan Qi protection?

Furthermore, even if he went all out, the pressure on his body was already very painful. If the pain increased, he might not be able to bear it and be eliminated.

What was even more terrifying was that if one was not careful, the consequences would be extremely painful. If one was lucky, they might be injured and then directly thrown out, but if they were unlucky, they might be instantly turned into a meat pie.

Hence, Xia ruofei was taking a risk.

He didn’t want to take too much risk, but he was very clear about his own situation. If he only relied on his current ability, there was a high probability that he would be directly sent flying when he reached the 500th floor, and then he would be stopped at the 500th floor.

There were only 18 steps left before he reached the top. Standing at Xia ruofei’s position, he could almost touch the light curtain Door. If he was eliminated at this position, he would definitely not be willing to accept it.

In order to increase his strength, Xia ruofei was willing to endure any amount of pain. He was even willing to consume more petals of the spirit Heart Flower.

Xia ruofei relaxed his Yuan Qi protection by a little, and the pressure on his body instantly increased.

He had already tried his best to pay attention to the degree, but the sudden increase in pressure still made his expression change. Then, he heard a series of cracking sounds. Many of his bones had cracked or even broken. The huge pain suddenly hit him, making his face as pale as paper, and large beads of sweat fell from his forehead.

Xia ruofei groaned and felt a sweet taste in his throat. A stream of blood uncontrollably rushed up and slowly flowed down from the corner of his mouth.

In the hidden space enshrouded in purple mist, Daoist priest Qing Xuan was also shocked by this scene.

He suddenly vomited blood out of nowhere. This was indeed quite shocking.

“Brother mountain river, what’s wrong with this child?” Daoist priest Qing Xuan could not help but feel anxious. ‘He doesn’t look too good … If he’s so seriously injured, he should have been teleported away quickly. But why hasn’t there been any movement until now? Could it be that there’s a problem with the stairway?”

With a complicated expression, immortal mountain river waved his hand and said,””Daoist Qing Xuan, ruofei is fine, and the heaven ladder is fine. You don’t have to worry…”

Daoist Qing Xuan raised his eyebrows and said,””I’ve controlled the trial Pagoda for hundreds of years. I know more than you …”

“But 1 understand my disciple.” Immortal mountain river said calmly,”he looks a little scary, but in fact, he doesn’t seem to have reached his limit.”

Speaking of this, immortal mountain river asked again,””Daoist Qing Xuan, can this heaven ladder also temper the body?”

Daoist Qing Xuan was stunned for a moment before he said,”The force of the pressure can indeed temper the body, but the process will be very painful and extremely difficult to control…”

“That’s right!” Immortal mountain river said,”this disciple of mine must have discovered this situation, so he consciously used the force of compression to temper his physical body. I guess he doesn’t have much confidence in the next five hundredth step, so he’s using this method to temper his body and improve his strength.”

Daoist Qing Xuan was dumbfounded and said,”This … This … How can this be done? If you let go of your Yuan Qi protection, you might end up with broken bones!”

“His spine has been broken many times, but he was healed by the elixir I gave him,” immortal Shanhe said calmly.

Taoist master Qing Xuan was not too surprised by the immediate effect of the elixir on external injuries. What he was really surprised about was that Xia ruofei was breaking his bones and then rejoining them again and again. No matter how good the elixir was, it could not alleviate the intense pain during the process!

After a long while, Daoist Qing Xuan muttered,””Brother mountain river, I’m impressed. Are all your disciples like this? He’s even so cruel to himself, he’s simply a madman!”

“We are indeed a little crazy, but RUO Fei is definitely the craziest among the crazies!” Immortal mountain river grinned.

“I think he … Really has a chance of standing firm on the 500th level!” Daoist Qing Xuan said with a complicated expression.

Immortal mountain river looked at Xia ruofei in the bronze mirror and

said,””Daoist Qing Xuan, he’s already at this position. Do you still think that his goal is to reach the five – hundredth floor? 1 can see that he was aiming to reach the top from the start. No matter how difficult it was, he never wavered from this thought….”
