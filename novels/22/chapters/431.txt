Chapter 432: This policewoman is not simple (1)

Qin Xiao Yu grabbed the mouse and paused the video, then leaned closer to the screen to watch it carefully. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

The policeman who was operating the computer gave up his seat.

The expression on Qin Xiao Yu’s face was very interesting. After she carefully identified it, she raised her head and asked,””Your friend is the girl sitting at the bar?”

“Officer Qin, won’t you know if you continue to watch?” Xia ruofei smiled faintly.

In fact, Xia ruofei had seen Qin Xiao Yu’s expression just now and he was also muttering in his heart: Could she have recognized Lu You? It can’t be such a coincidence, right? He heard that Lu You was usually very low – Key. Even her classmates in University did not know her identity.

Qin Xiao Yu looked at Xia ruofei with dissatisfaction and focused her attention on the computer screen. She pressed the spacebar and let the video continue to play.

As the video played, Qin Xiao Yu’s face became more and more unsightly. Her hand that was holding the mouse had unknowingly tightened and her eyes seemed to be spewing fire.

The scene stopped after Xia ruofei knocked down a few men at the door of the room on the second floor like he was chopping melons and vegetables and kicked the door open.

Qin Xiao Yu raised her head and looked at Xia ruofei, asking,””Your friend ... Is he hurt?”

“I arrived in time.” Xia ruofei said indifferently,”if I don’t use some methods to force him on the first floor and take my time to use emotions and reason, it would be too late by the time I find my friend.”

Qin Xiao Yu’s expression became a little awkward. She knew that Xia ruofei was referring to what she had just said.

Extreme times called for extreme measures. Qin Xiao Yu understood this logic but after seeing the scene that day, she was indeed frightened by Xia ruofei’s thunderous methods. So her first impression of Xia ruofei was that he was fierce and brutal.

However, when she found out that the lady who was almost defiled by Fang Luo was Lu You, Qin Xiao Yu suddenly felt that Xia ruofei’s methods were not cruel at all.

When a person’s perspective was different, their perspective on the problem would also be different.

Qin Xiao Yu pondered for a moment, stood up and said to the policeman who was taking the statement,””I’m going to verify something. Call da Qiang back first. Don’t go through the detention procedures for now. Wait for me to come back!”

“Yes!” The policeman quickly replied.

Qin Xiao Yu strode out of the interrogation room.

“Officer Qin!” Xia ruofei called out from behind Qin Xiaoyu.

Qin Xiao Yu stopped in her tracks and turned around to look at Xia ruofei. She furrowed her brows and said,””What is it?”

Xia ruofei looked into Qin Xiaoyu’s eyes and said,””My friend ... She doesn’t want her family to worry about her. I hope you can keep this a secret, officer Qin.”

Xia ruofei had basically confirmed that Qin Xiao Yu had recognized Lu You’s identity. As for how Qin Xiao Yu knew that Lu You was Tian Huilan’s daughter, Xia ruofei had no idea.

However, he knew that Qin Xiao Yu was going out to report to her superiors. In the end, this matter would be reported to Tian Huilan and this was something Xia ruofei did not want to see.

Qin Xiao Yu said lightly: “how to handle the case is our police’s business. You are still a suspect now. You should worry more about your own affairs!”

After that, Qin Xiaoyu left the interrogation room without looking back.

Xia ruofei’s heart was filled with anger. This small chair could not trap him, but this was the Public Security Bureau. He could not possibly hold Qin Xiaoyu hostage and not let her report it, right?

Even if Xia ruofei had done that, the matter would have blown up and Tian Huilan would have gotten the news.

He could only shake his head gloomily and say in his heart,”Lu You, it’s not that I don’t want to keep your secret! Who knew that this beautiful policewoman would recognize you at first glance ...

After Qin Xiao Yu left, the police officer in charge of taking the statement was a little nervous. He kept staring at Xia ruofei, afraid that Xia ruofei would burst out and hurt someone. He had been to the scene that night. The tragic scene made his heart turn cold just thinking about it.

The thought of the killer who had created that tragic scene was right in front of him, and the policeman felt weak.

Xia ruofei yawned out of boredom. He stretched his body and said,””Brother ...”

The police officer was shocked. He looked at Xia ruofei warily and asked,””What is it?”

“Don’t be nervous, don’t be nervous ...” Xia ruofei revealed a harmless smile and said,”do you have a cigarette on you? I left in a hurry and forgot to bring my cigarettes ...”

The police officer hesitated for a moment, then took out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket and placed it in front of Xia ruofei along with the lighter. He then quickly took a few steps away and watched Xia ruofei vigilantly.

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry as he looked at the police officer. He took out a cigarette from the box and lit it. He took a deep puff and leaned back in his chair, looking very pleased.

The interrogation room was filled with smoke. Xia ruofei and the police officer did not say anything and the atmosphere was a little cold.

In the office area of the criminal Police detachment upstairs, Qin Xiaoyu took the USB and went straight into her office.

The working conditions in the city Bureau were not bad. The three leaders of the first Criminal Investigation Unit had their own small offices.

Qin Xiao Yu turned on the computer monitor and tapped on the keyboard a few times to wake the computer up. She then inserted the USB drive into the computer and made a copy of the video that Xia ruofei had edited.

Then, she picked up the phone on her desk, dialed a string of numbers, and quickly hung up before the call connected.
