Xia ruofei was stunned and said,”fake reporter?” Interesting! Then, Secretary Lu, please explain it to me!”

“Alright, Mr. Xia.” Lu Wen quickly said,”according to the investigation of the provincial SARFT’s Discipline Inspection team, this Huang Zhenyu was transferred from the Ning County radio and television station to the provincial entertainment channel through improper procedures two months ago. So far, he doesn’t have a news reporter’s certificate ...”

Lu Wen reported the results of their investigation to Xia ruofei. Then, on behalf of the publicity department of the Ganjiang Provincial Party Committee, he asked Xia ruofei to convey his apologies to the family of the martyr.

Lu Wen said goodbye and hung up the phone.

Xia ruofei looked teasingly at Huang Zhenyu, who was covered in dirt. He raised his voice and said to the villagers,””Fellow villagers, the provincial television station has already investigated clearly. This guy is not a reporter at all. He is using the banner of a reporter to swindle people!”

“Great, this guy is a liar!” Third great uncle said happily. Then the little descendant won’t have to go to jail after beating him ...”

A younger villager couldn’t help but say,””Third great uncle, even if he’s a scammer, beating him up like this ... Is also against the law!”

Third great uncle was so angry that he smacked the villager’s head with his fan and said,””What the hell do you know about magic, you dumbass!”

“Yes, yes, yes. I don’t understand ...” The villager said with a bitter smile.

His third great uncle was the most senior person in the village, so no one dared to refute what he said.

However, the villagers were obviously not as optimistic as third great uncle. Their eyes were still filled with worry. The villagers who were further away from third great uncle were still whispering, discussing how many years Xia ruofei would be sentenced to for beating someone up like this ...

At this moment, the sound of police sirens could be heard from afar. The villagers immediately became restless.

Soon, two police cars arrived in front of the Luo family’s house. Seven or eight policemen jumped out of the cars and walked over quickly.

Huang Zhenyu was also surprised. They didn’t have the chance to call the police for help just now, so how did these police get the news and rush over?

Moreover, even if they did call the police, it had only been half an hour, and the village was so remote. Wouldn’t the police come too quickly?

However, Huang Zhenyu did not think too much about it. It was better to get out of the control of this killing God first! Otherwise, he would have died from the pain before he was even detained by the discipline Inspection team ...

Therefore, Huang Zhenyu immediately shouted,””Police! Help me!”

The police officers separated the crowd and walked in. The middle – aged police officer in the lead said loudly,””We’re from the county Criminal Police force. We received a report that someone pretended to be a reporter and swindled people in the village. Where are the fake reporters?”

The villagers all pointed their fingers at Huang Zhenyu and the other two.

Under the police’s intense gaze, Huang Zhenyu said with a long face,””Police! We’re all staff of the provincial television station. We have work permits and are not fake reporters! And ... They surrounded me and didn’t let me leave. That ... That young man even beat me up so badly. You have to help me!”

The middle – aged police officer looked at Huang Zhenyu’s injuries and frowned slightly. He thought to himself,”isn’t this young master a little too ruthless?” How did he end up like this?

However, he was very clear about his mission and turned a deaf ear to Huang Zhenyu’s words. He only curled his lips and said,””It seems that you are the fake reporters? What kind of situation was this? Who did it?”

Xia ruofei smiled and stood out.””Officer, I was the one who hit him. It has nothing to do with the villagers.”

The middle – aged police officer nodded and said,””Oh ... It turns out that these swindlers were trying to deceive the village. After being exposed, they were ready to commit murder, so the villagers subdued them together in self – defense.”

Huang Zhenyu was dumbfounded when he heard this and quickly said,””Officer, you must have heard wrong. He himself ...”

“I didn’t ask you to speak!” The middle – aged police officer glared at Huang Zhenyu and said, then turned to a young police officer next to him and said,”have you noted it down?”

“Captain Cheng, the scammer was about to commit murder after being exposed. The villagers injured people in self – defense. Record everything down.” The young policeman said immediately.

“You ... You’re distorting the truth!” Huang Zhenyu shouted angrily,”our interview equipment was also destroyed by him. The evidence that was taken inside was also destroyed!”

The middle – aged police officer looked at the camera fragments on the ground and raised his eyebrows. “What’s going on?”

Xia ruofei saw the middle – aged police officer’s serious look and couldn’t help but find it funny. He stepped forward and said,””It’s me ...”

“It turns out that they were in a panic while escaping and accidentally broke it!” The middle – aged police officer immediately interrupted Xia ruofei and said,”Xiao Zhao, note it down!”

“Yes, Captain Cheng!” The young policeman immediately jotted it down in his notebook.

Captain Cheng continued to ask a few more questions. Each time, before Xia ruofei could finish, he would come up with a self – justified reason and let the young policeman write it down in the on – Site Investigation record. Although it seemed ridiculous, it was still according to the procedure.

Finally, the middle – aged police officer said to Xia ruofei,””Sir, we have already received the notice from the provincial Public Security Department regarding these fake reporters. The provincial SARFT’s disciplinary inspection team is also preparing to implement two regulations on them. Thank you for helping the police catch these scammers! Then ... We’ll be taking her away ...”

How could Xia ruofei not know that all this was the result of song Rui’s manipulation? Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

He smiled and nodded.”Then I’ll have to trouble Captain Cheng. However, this Huang Zhenyu seems to be quite badly injured. I’m afraid he needs to be sent to the hospital in time for treatment.”

“Yes, in the spirit of humanitarianism, we will also give the suspect necessary treatment.” Captain Cheng said,”besides, it’s still the investigation stage by the discipline Inspection department. We’ll send him to the hospital and hand him over to the comrades of the provincial SARFT’s Discipline Inspection team.”

Captain Cheng then said meaningfully,””I believe that the discipline Inspection department will definitely investigate all the questions about this fake reporter and deal with him seriously! If you’re suspected of committing a crime, the judiciary will definitely investigate it to the end. Please rest assured, Mr. Xia!”

“Of course I’m not worried,” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

Captain Cheng had successfully completed his mission. He immediately motioned for the police to escort Huang Zhenyu and the other two into the police car, then politely said goodbye to Xia ruofei.

The two police cars left as quickly as they came, and in a short while, even the sirens could not be heard.

The empty space at the Luo family’s Gate was silent. The villagers were looking at Xia ruofei with admiration ...
