Chapter 579: Three delicacies of Yangtze River (1)

Ling Xiaotian’s forthright voice came from the phone,””RUO Fei! Are you free tomorrow afternoon? I’ll buy you a drink, haha!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I should have the time!” Uncle Ling, I also have something to discuss with you!”

“Oh? What was it? Is there another good project?” Ling Xiaotian chuckled as he asked.

“Let’s talk in detail when we meet tomorrow! I need your help with a small matter. ” Xia ruofei said.

Since they were going to meet tomorrow, Xia ruofei was not in a hurry to talk about the red Arowana.

“Alright! “Then we’ll talk when we meet, haha ...” Ling Xiaotian said. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Xia ruofei continued,”uncle Ling, I’ve received a sum of money these days. The funds for the farm’s construction are already sufficient. So, I don’t need to advance the winery’s dividends for the time being.”

Ling Xiaotian was stunned for a moment.”Ruofei, the winery has plenty of funds, and the capital chain is very healthy. If you need it, you can go to the front and get an advance. I’ve already spoken to the finance department. There’s no need to find money from elsewhere!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”uncle Ling, I didn’t go to borrow money!” It just so happens that our company has received a sum of money, which is more than enough to pay for the farm infrastructure, so we don’t need to withdraw it from the winery. Our Drunken Eight Immortals has just begun to seize the market, and there are many places where we need to spend money on publicity and promotion. It’s better to keep it!”

Xia ruofei and Ling Xiaotian did not plan to mass – produce the wine. Instead, they planned to use the quality of the wine to win against Lao Ai. Due to the limited conditions, 100 tons of wine per month was close to the limit unless Xia ruofei made some changes to the space so that the wine jars could be stacked together.

To put it bluntly, the final strategy was somewhat similar to hunger marketing, especially the higher – grade three – month, five – month, and one – year white wines. The monthly output was very small, and it was impossible to sell them all.

However, hunger marketing did not mean that there was no need for advertising costs.

On the contrary, using such a sales strategy would require more planning in terms of marketing, and it would need to cooperate with all kinds of hype. The cost of advertising and marketing would even be higher than traditional sales strategies.

......

Ling Xiaotian didn’t mind when he heard this and chuckled,””Alright then! Ruofei, you don’t need to be polite with me when you need cash flow. Even if the winery can’t get the money for the time being, it’s still easy for the head office to withdraw millions or tens of millions. ”

“I understand. Thank you, uncle Ling!” Xia ruofei said sincerely.

Ling Xiaotian laughed and said,”we’re all family, what’s there to be polite about?” Remember to bring a few bottles of good wine tomorrow!”

The good wine that Ling Xiaotian was referring to was the Drunken Eight Immortals, which Xia ruofei had added a spirit Heart Flower petal solution to. The added white wine was of a much higher grade than the ordinary spatial wine. Ling Xiaotian was also an expert in alcohol, so he could taste even the slightest difference. Naturally, he would be able to taste it after eating it.

“No problem. I’ll bring a few more bottles tomorrow.” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Then, he asked curiously,”by the way, uncle Ling, why did you suddenly think of treating me to a meal tomorrow?”

Ling Xiaotian said mysteriously,”there’s good food to eat. Now, it’s very hard to eat. So, of course, I can’t leave you behind. Otherwise, Qingxue will be very angry with me.” Hahaha!”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. He asked in a low voice,””Good stuff? Uncle Ling, could he be ... A protected animal? You can’t be muddleheaded!”

Ling Xiaotian laughed and said,”RUO Fei, what are you thinking!” I’ve received military education, how can I do something illegal?”

“Oh! “It’s good that you’re not ...” Xia ruofei heaved a sigh of relief. However, his curiosity was piqued and he could not help but ask,”what is that good thing?”

Ling Xiaotian laughed and asked,””Have you heard of the three delicacies of Chang Jiang?”

“I don’t know much about it ... Can you give me some general knowledge?” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“The three delicacies of Yangtze River refer to three kinds of fish produced in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, namely Pomfret, Grenadier anchovy, and pufferfish.” Ling Xiaotian said,”because of the over – harvesting in the past few years, the wild three delicacies of the Yangtze River have almost gone extinct. If you want to eat authentic wild Pomfret or Grenadier anchovy, you have to rely on luck.”

“Uncle Ling, this time ...” Xia ruofei asked curiously.

“Today, I got two pure – wild Yangtze River pomfrets. They’re the best of the three delicacies in the Yangtze River and are known as the ‘King of fish’!” Ruofei, Pomfret’s meat is especially tender and fat, and wild ones are even more delicious. You’re in for a treat, kid ...”

“Uncle Ling, I’m drooling now that you’ve mentioned it ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Ling Xiaotian laughed heartily.”Then come over earlier tomorrow. I’ll let our Ling Ji F & B’s Executive Head Chef handle it personally. He’s from the Sunan province. Whether it’s knife fish or Pomfret, he has a unique skill. I guarantee that you’ll have an endless aftertaste after eating it!”

“Then I’ll be looking forward to tomorrow’s Chinese perch banquet!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

After Xia ruofei hung up the phone, he became more and more curious about the three delicacies of Yangtze River that Ling Xiaotian had mentioned. He turned on his computer and searched for information about the three delicacies of Yangtze River, especially pomfrets. He felt that his horizons had been broadened.

The three delicacies of Yangtze River had been very famous since ancient times. Since the six Dynasties, the scholars and scholars had been promoting them. There were a lot of poems and articles about them, as well as some popular anecdotes, such as Su Dongpo risking his life to eat pufferfish and so on.
