3189 New news about scholar Yuntai (2)

Xia ruofei forced a smile.”You’re right ... Senior Yuntai, you’ve touched the rising Dragon Order. I wonder if you’ve noticed that there’s a black matrix on every floating point?”

“Of course!” Scholar Yuntai said without hesitation.

There was no doubt about this answer. After all, although the floating point was only the size of a rice grain, and the black matrix on it was almost indistinguishable with the naked eye, this was only relative to the vision of ordinary people. How could a cultivator not notice such an obvious clue?

Xia ruofei continued.”Senior Yuntai, I don’t know if the seniors in the ancient cultivation world have tried it before. This time, we determined that each floating point might represent a word. Then, some Floating Points with the same matrix pattern mean that the words are repeated. From this, we can calculate the content recorded in the whole article with more than 3000 Floating Points ...”

Grand cloud scholar said with a smile,”this is almost the mainstream judgment of our time. Although I have not participated in the related research, I have often heard about it. But boy ... This possibility is almost infinite. Some people have spent hundreds of years and still can not list it all. And the floating point distribution changes every 50 years.”

“Speaking of which, a change every 50 years might not be a bad thing!” Xia ruofei said, deep in thought.

“What are you talking about?” Layman Yuntai asked, puzzled.

“Grand cloud stage senior, this floating point pattern changes every fifty years or so, but the black matrix on the surface of the floating point sphere should have many duplicates, right?” Xia ruofei asked.

“That’s right!” Scholar Yuntai said,”someone has specially compared them. 70% to 80% of the black matrix combinations will appear repeatedly. Of course, their positions are all messed up.”

“That’s equivalent to having a lot more samples!” Xia ruofei said,”different floating point patterns are different samples. This way, the accuracy of the calculation will be higher.”

“If even one floating point picture can’t list all of them, what’s the use of having more?” Scholar Yuntai retorted with a smile.

Yuntai layman didn’t know what a sample was, but he knew that someone had spent hundreds of years focusing on a floating point pattern, but still got nothing.

“If you’re saying that each floating point represents a character, we’ve already listed all the possibilities,” Xia ruofei said.

“What?” Scholar Yuntai was shocked and quickly asked,”how did you do it? How was that possible? That was more than 3000 words! Other than a few repeated Floating Points, I have no other clue!”

“It’s constantly listing them out!” Xia ruofei said,”then, we’ll make a judgment. If it’s obviously illogical, we’ll naturally deny it!”

“All of them?” Scholar Yuntai couldn’t help but click his tongue and ask,”how long did you take? Don’t tell me ... I’ve been in closed – door cultivation ... For more than a thousand years?”

Xia ruofei almost burst out laughing. He quickly said,””Senior Yuntai, please don’t misunderstand. You just entered closed – door cultivation for a few days! It took us less than four hours...Uh, four hours to complete the list!”

“This is impossible!” Said layman Yuntai.

What Xia ruofei had said was beyond his understanding.

What could he do in four hours? For cultivators, it would only take a snap of their fingers! Sometimes, thinking about a problem in cultivation would pass by in the blink of an eye. Not to mention closed – door cultivation, a few days, a few months, or even a few years would pass in the blink of an eye.

Now, Xia ruofei was telling him that he had used four hours to list out all the possibilities. How was that possible?

Xia ruofei briefly explained the principle of supercomputers and said,””Senior Yuntai, after we finished the calculation program, the calculation was done by the Super computer. Its calculation speed is very fast. It only took two hours to list all the possibilities and then arranged them in order according to the size of the possibility. Of course, it would take a lot of data to keep all the combinations, so I only kept the first 1000 possibilities. ”

At this point, Xia ruofei paused for a moment. However, before scholar Yuntai could ask, he continued,””Unfortunately, we’ve just checked all of the 1000 possibilities, and there’s not even a single sentence that’s coherent. In other words, we’ve basically ruled out the possibility that each floating point pattern represents a word!”

Scholar Yuntai was stunned for a while before he said,””In other words, at least 60% of the cultivators who studied the rising Dragon Order in our era had actually gone in the wrong direction from the beginning?”

“Although I can’t be completely sure, it’s highly possible!” Xia ruofei said.

Xia ruofei was very confident in the algorithm he had written. He believed that even if there were more samples, the final result would be the same.

The cultivators of the ancient cultivation world did not have supercomputers at their disposal. They had to rely on human strength to list and make judgments. In addition, the lifespan of cultivators was very long, so some people had spent hundreds of years studying this Rising Dragon Order. If these people knew that the direction they had chosen hundreds of years ago was wrong, it was unknown whether they would collapse.

Of course, it was also unknown where these cultivators were now. He wondered if they had disappeared in the long river of history, or if they had gone to some mysterious place, just like the cultivators above the nascent Soul Stage who had disappeared more than three hundred years ago.

Xia ruofei’s thoughts were a little scattered, and master Yuntai didn’t say anything for a long time because of this shocking news. Both of them were silent.

After a long time, Xia ruofei realized that now was not the time to be absent – minded. Precious time was still being wasted!

“Senior Yuntai, in your time, did anyone ever consider that a floating point image might represent one or a group of numbers?” he asked quickly.

Layman Yuntai thought for a moment and said,”there are some, but not as many as those who insist on the written method!” The reason for the opposition is simple. If it’s more than 3000 numbers, what’s the point?”

“Didn’t they think of double encryption?” Xia ruofei asked,”turn the picture into numbers and then use the rules of the numbers to solve the secret of the token! Could it be that this is not possible?”

Yuntai scholar laughed and said,”we don’t understand the double encryption you’re talking about, but I do understand what you mean. At the time, most of the cultivators who studied the rising Dragon Token thought that the floating point pattern was complicated enough. It was so complicated that even a cultivator’s entire life might not be able to crack it. If it only represents some numbers ... Of course, not everyone is against this view!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Oh?” Xia ruofei said,”in other words, some people think that a floating point pattern might represent one or a group of numbers, right?”

Layman Yuntai said,”the people who insist on this direction may not even be half of the people who study the rising Dragon!” The number of people was relatively small, and they did not have any results from their research! However ... Among the people who supported the numerical solution, there was a person who played an important role in the cultivation world at that time!”

“Oh?” Xia ruofei suddenly became energetic.”Please tell me more about it, senior Yuntai!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but complain in his heart. The last time when scholar Yuntai mentioned the rising Dragon Token, he didn’t reveal such information. He only said that the floating point pattern had no pattern and didn’t even mention the black matrix.

Did he really think that it was insignificant, or was he deliberately hiding some information?

Xia ruofei muttered in his heart.

“There was a senior who firmly supported the ‘number school’ at that time,” said layman Yuntai.”His name was venerable Yangshan, and he was already a monk of the leaving aperture realm at that time ...”

“The leaving aperture period!” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be shocked.

In the current cultivation world, this level of cultivation was no longer just a legend. The current cultivators could only dream of reaching the original infant stage. After the original infant stage, there was the primordial spirit stage, and then the leaving aperture stage. The difference was too great ...

“Yes,” said layman Yuntai.”Venerable Yangshan insisted that fufu patterns represent numbers. He was even laughed at by some cultivators of the same level ... Oh, yes, venerable Yangshan is also a Grandmaster in mathematics!”
