Xia ruofei and the other two walked forward. Guan Ping pulled over a familiar classmate and asked,””What’s the situation?” Through the student’s story, Xia ruofei and the other two finally understood the general situation. It turned out that Liu Hang had volunteered to book a restaurant for Yuan Lili today. When they arrived at Hongtian restaurant, the front desk manager told him that the private room of Ji Xiang Pavilion that he had wanted had been reserved. He also sent a text message to Liu Hang to inform him of the matter. At the same time, the front desk manager also adjusted the layout of the Ruyi Pavilion private room for Liu Hang, which was exactly the same as Lakshmi Pavilion. However, Liu Hang was determined to find Lakshmi Pavilion, so he made a scene in the lobby of the restaurant. “Since the layout is the same, what’s there to make a fuss about?” Xia ruofei asked in confusion. The student smiled bitterly.”The layout is the same, but Lakshmi Pavilion is a private room by the river. You can see the river view when you eat, but you can only see the hotel parking lot in Ruyi Pavilion ... And the class monitor may feel that she has lost face ...” Xia ruofei was speechless. Wasn’t this a little too pretentious? Although the hotel was at fault, it was just a meal, so they should be more understanding of each other! Besides, he had informed her immediately. It was just that she didn’t notice the message. “Section Chief Liu, this ... The customer over there made a reservation first. It’s not easy for us to coordinate ...” The front desk manager said awkwardly. Seeing that, Yuan Lili also said,””Liu Hang, why don’t we forget about it? isn’t it the same if we get together as classmates in any private room?” Xia ruofei also smiled.”I agree. It’s a rare gathering. It’s a happy occasion. There’s no need to spoil the mood over such a small matter.” When Yuan Lili spoke, Liu Hang’s face only darkened a little. But when he heard Xia ruofei echo her words, he immediately frowned and said impatiently,””Xia ruofei, don’t talk nonsense! Was this a small matter? When have I, Liu Hang, ever suffered such vexation? If you can’t even book a private room you want, will you be able to enjoy this meal?” Xia ruofei pursed his lips and laughed silently. Liu Hang really thought he was a pushover. Just now, Yuan Lili had the same opinion, but he did not say anything. However, once Xia ruofei opened his mouth, he immediately scolded him. However, since Yuan Lili was treating them to dinner today, Xia ruofei did not want to make the atmosphere too stiff. He used his eyes to stop pang Hao and Guan Ping who were about to flip out. He simply stood at the side with his arms crossed and watched the show. Since Liu Hang wanted to be in the limelight, he would let him perform to his heart’s content. In Xia ruofei’s eyes, Liu Hang was no different from a clown. Liu Hang raised his head and said to the front desk manager,””Since you can’t make the decision, then go and call your store manager he over!” The front desk manager said with a strange expression,””I’m sorry, Section Chief Liu, but Branch Manager he left his job a few days ago ...” “You ...” Liu Hang was choked up. His expression was as if he was constipated. At this time, another female student said,””Manager, why don’t you tell us who booked Lakshmi Pavilion? Let’s talk to him about changing rooms, okay?” Liu Hang’s eyes immediately lit up and said,””Yes, yes, yes! Tell me, who made the decision for Lakshmi Pavilion? I’ll call him personally! I don’t believe that I, Liu Hang ‘s, face doesn’t work in the three mountains ...” “Class monitor, it seems that you’ve been doing well in the system these past few years!” “Isn’t that so? How many years has class monitor Liu been in the company? He’s already a Section Chief!” “Who would dare to not give face to Section Chief Liu?” The few classmates were all complimenting him. Liu Hang was obviously very pleased. He glanced at Xia ruofei, intentionally or otherwise, with a sense of superiority. The front desk manager hesitated for a moment. It was definitely against the rules to disclose the customer’s information, but Liu Hang was obviously not willing to let it go. Moreover, the person who made the reservation at Lakshmi Pavilion was also a person in the system, so she made a decision after weighing the pros and cons. “Section Chief Liu, Lakshmi Pavilion has been booked in advance by Section Chief Hao from the provincial Civil Affairs Department.” The front desk manager said carefully,”why don’t ... You discuss this with him? However, please don’t say that I leaked the information, it’s against the rules ...” Liu Hang’s proud look froze when he heard that. What kind of international joke is this? To discuss with Section Chief Hao of the provincial Department about changing rooms? My old man is only a Section Chief in the district Civil Affairs Bureau, and he has to be polite to the Section Chief of the provincial Department. I’m just a small section Chief, and you want me to give orders to the Section Chief of the provincial Department? Liu Hang really hated this gentle front desk manager now. If she had told him earlier that Lakshmi Pavilion was reserved by Section Chief zou, he would definitely have gone with the flow. Now that she had said it in front of so many students, wasn’t it impossible to back down? Everyone had been in society for a long time, so they had the ability to read people’s expressions. Therefore, when the little fatty pang Hao saw Liu Hang’s expression, he almost could not hold back his laughter. Guan Ping was annoyed by Liu Hang’s condescending tone when he spoke to Xia ruofei, so he said directly,””Class monitor Liu, quickly go and talk to this Section Chief zou and ask him to obediently give up the private room!” Hearing this, pang Hao couldn’t help but chuckle,””Yup! The problem with the box is related to our class monitor Liu’s face. It’s no small matter!” Xia ruofei smiled as he watched the show from the side, a warm current flowing through his heart. Xia ruofei could tell that Guan Ping and pang Hao were not doing very well. Liu Hang, on the other hand, obviously had a certain amount of power. However, the two of them were willing to offend Liu Hang just to help him get back at him. Their friendship from their middle school days had not diminished in the slightest. Liu Hang’s face turned red as he glared at pang Hao and Guan Ping with hatred. It was obvious that he hated both of them along with Xia ruofei. Seeing the awkward atmosphere, Yuan Lili quickly tried to smooth things over,””Liu Hang, let’s forget it ... Since they booked it first, let’s change to another room. It’s the same no matter where we are!” Liu Hang heaved a sigh of relief. Although he had slapped himself in the face, at least he had a way out. He quickly said,””Alright ... After all, first come, first served. Since you, the master, don’t mind, I have no objections either ...” The few students who had just praised Liu Hang now had strange expressions on their faces. The class reunion hadn’t even started, but the atmosphere had already become quite strange. Just as everyone was about to head to the elevator, a surprised voice suddenly came from the door.””Mr. Xia! Are you here to eat?” Xia ruofei and the others stopped and turned around. They saw a curvaceous and charming young woman in a black professional suit walking over with a warm smile. The person was the new Procurement Manager of Ling Ji F & B. When Xia ruofei first provided paradise vegetables to Ling Ji F & B, it was Ling Qingxue who personally brought her to Xia ruofei’s Villa. “So it’s big sister Xu! You’re here to eat too?” Xia ruofei smiled and greeted him. Then, she said jokingly,”isn’t your own company in the F & B industry? Why is the fertile water still flowing into the fields of others?” “Mr. Xia, you’re so funny ... Didn’t Qingxue tell you?” manager Xu chuckled. The Hong Tian restaurant has been acquired by our Ling Ji F & B, and it’s now a fully owned subsidiary of us that specializes in min cuisine. “
