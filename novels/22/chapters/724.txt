Chapter 725: Enthusiastic and enthusiastic (2)

Although Xia ruofei could buy a large amount of them from Australia through Liang Qichao and store them in the realm for three to four months before selling them, it was more troublesome to import them from overseas. Besides, Xia ruofei did not care about the profit.

With the spirit map space, there were many ways to make money, so there was really no need to do so.

Hence, Xia ruofei directly rejected the other party’s request for cooperation.

After a satisfying meal, Li Jing left the farm with the team.

After personally sending off the Toyota Coaster at the entrance of the mixed – use complex, Feng Jing looked at Xia ruofei deeply and asked,””Chairman, these super – Commercial channels are all rushing to cooperate with us. Do you have any plans for the quota of fruit?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”let’s see how it goes!” I’ve already asked old Cao to bring a few experienced workers to the orchard to make a relatively accurate estimate and see how much we can produce. ”

“En!” Feng Jing nodded and said,”Chairman, after seeing today’s situation, I finally understand why you were so confident about sales yesterday!”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”this is nothing. There will be more business partners coming over for inspection in the next two days. I have already contacted Hong Kong’s Hengfeng group. Their fruit boutique store is a global chain. If we enter Hengfeng’s fruit boutique store, the effect will be more obvious for our paradise Corporation to expand our brand influence among the high – end crowd.”

Feng Rao’s mouth was wide open in shock.”Hengfeng group? The Hengfeng group in Hong Kong?”

“Is there a second Hengfeng group in Hong Kong?” Xia ruofei asked with a relaxed smile.

Feng Rao gasped and said,””Chairman, you usually don’t show off. I didn’t expect you to have such a wide network. You can even contact a giant company like Hengfeng.”

Xia ruofei smiled and said humbly,””By chance, I have some connections with Hengfeng’s Chairman MA and Mr. Xiao Ma. They would usually give me some face on normal matters.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Feng Rao looked at Xia ruofei with admiration.

......

Xia ruofei continued,””In fact, I have a good personal relationship with Mr. Tang of the United States shengbang group. I cooperated with him on that farm in Australia. However, our fruit production is limited and it’s not the right time to break into the International market yet. So after some consideration, I still chose Hong Kong’s Hengfeng group. ”

Feng Jing had some understanding of the situation in Australia’s farms. However, Sheng bang was also one of the top 500 companies in the world. She thought of Xia ruofei’s young age. Although the company was not very big, the friends he had were all top entrepreneurs in the world. She could not help but feel a little excited.

The current paradise Corporation was still very small compared to those giant companies, but it was already showing signs of soaring to the sky.

Thinking of the peach Garden vegetables, Peach Garden fruits, wild Chinese perch, Drunken Eight Immortals wine, top – grade iron – skinned maple, and the heart – nourishing soup with amazing medicinal effects, Feng Jing felt as if she could see the rising sun.

The next day, Ma Zhiming and his wife brought Huan Huan to the three mountains.

Because Tao Yuan farm and the airport were both in Changping County, Ma Zhiming’s family didn’t even go to professor Tian’s house in the city. They came directly from the airport to Tao Yuan farm.

Although it had not been long since they last parted, Huanhuan was still very happy to see Xia ruofei, especially when Xia ruofei still remembered his promise to bring her to pick fruits. He had informed her as soon as the fruits ripened, which made her even happier.

As soon as they reached Xia ruofei’s small villa, Huanhuan threw herself into Xia ruofei’s arms. After a moment of intimacy, she happily played with lightning.

Looking at their daughter who was extremely happy, Ma Zhiming and Tian Huixin also revealed a gratified smile.

The people in Hong Kong and Taiwan were generally religious. Ma Zhiming even felt that Xia ruofei was like a noble in his life.

Although the sales profit of Taoyuan vegetables was not worth mentioning to a giant like Hengfeng group, Xia ruofei had saved MA Xiong and cured Huanhuan. This favor was greater than the sky!

Xia ruofei smiled and greeted them,”Mr. MA, aunt Tian!” You’ve had a long journey!”

Ma Zhiming spoke in Mandarin with a heavy accent,”Xia Sheng, Hong Kong is quite close to the three mountains. Our schedule is quite tight this time, and we came here by private jet, so it won’t be hard!”

“Then, shall we go to the orchard directly?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

Ma Zhiming was also very interested in the fruit of paradise, so he naturally agreed to it.

Hence, Xia ruofei beckoned,”Huanhuan, let’s go!” I’m going to pick lychees and cherries!”

“En!” Huan Huan turned around and said,”brother RUO Fei, let’s bring lightning along!”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei said readily.

After he finished speaking, Xia ruofei whistled at lightning and carried Huanhuan in his arms. Lightning followed closely behind him.

They didn’t drive and walked straight to the orchard.

On the way, Ma Zhiming sighed,”Xia Sheng, your farm is getting bigger and bigger!” The situation is good!”

Tian Huixin smiled and said,”Zhiming, ruofei’s pharmaceutical factory is about to go into production!” They’re the ones that produce the medicine for autism. ”

“This is a good thing!” Ma Zhiming immediately said after hearing that,”it’s a great thing that will benefit the whole world! Xia Sheng has a Bodhisattva’s heart!”

Xia ruofei smiled humbly and said,””Mr. MA, you’re flattering me. Our new drug is going through the approval process. The first review in the province is generally not a big problem, but the clinical trial still needs time. The National Drug Administration will still conduct a review, so it’s estimated that it won’t be able to be launched in a short time. However, we should be able to officially launch this medicine for autism early next year. ”

“Xiasheng, you must inform me when the time comes.” Ma Zhiming said. I can also help you to coordinate in Hong Kong and try to enter the Hong Kong market directly. ”

Different countries and regions had their own drug entry mechanism, especially in Europe and the United States, where the standards were very strict. Basically, it was difficult for Chinese medicine to meet their standards.

Hong Kong also had its own access mechanism. If Ma Zhiming could mediate, it would be a good thing for the heart – nourishing soup to enter the Hong Kong market directly.

Of course, even if it was only sold in the Huaxia mainland, it was not a big problem.

With the magical effects of the heart – nourishing soup, this medicine would definitely become famous in a short time. By then, families with autism would come to China to buy the heart – nourishing soup.

This was similar to India’s generic drugs. Many cancer patients could not afford the original drug, so they went to buy Indian generic drugs that had similar effects but were many times cheaper. It was the same logic.

“Then I’ll thank you in advance, Mr. MA.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

The group chatted as they walked, and they soon arrived at the orchard.

After receiving Xia ruofei’s notice, Cao tieshu was already waiting in the orchard with a ladder, scissors, a bamboo basket, and other tools.

Seeing the fruit trees that covered the mountain, Huanhuan couldn’t help but cheer and run up the mountain.

Xia ruofei quickly followed.

Cao tieshu set up a ladder under a relatively large lychee tree. Huanhuan clamored to climb up the tree to pick lychees. Xia ruofei quickly stepped on the ladder and carefully protected Huanhuan.

He even pulled the lychees that Huanhuan could not reach over and asked her to cut them with scissors.

Tian Huixin caught them under the tree and put them into the basket.

After collecting about half a basket, under Tian Huixin’s urging, Huanhuan reluctantly got down the ladder under Xia ruofei’s protection.

Next, she couldn’t wait to taste the “fruits of her labor”. Hence, Xia ruofei called Tian Huixin and Ma Zhiming over to try it as well. At the same time, he plucked a lychee, peeled off the skin, and put it into Huanhuan’s mouth.

Ma Zhiming and Tian Huixin also leisurely picked up a lychee, peeled it, and put it into their mouths.

In fact, the cooperation with the Paradise Corporation to sell this batch of fruits had already been decided before Ma Zhiming’s family set off. No matter what the quality of this batch of fruits was, Ma Zhiming would definitely not hesitate to do Xia ruofei a small favor.

Therefore, the two of them didn’t look like they were on an inspection, but more like they were on an outing or having a farmhouse. Their expressions were also very leisurely.

However, when the lychees entered their mouths, their eyes lit up.

As members of Hong Kong’s wealthy families, what kind of high – end fruit had Ma Zhiming and Tian Huixin not eaten? However, the Taoyuan organic lychee still gave them a breathtaking feeling.

Especially the natural sweet taste, it made the two of them feel like they couldn’t stop.

Little Huanhuan, who was beside him, shouted happily,””It’s so delicious! Brother ruofei, I want more!”

Xia ruofei smiled lovingly. He peeled another lychee and fed it to Huanhuan.

While eating, Huan Huan said vaguely,””Mom, dad, ruofei Gege’s lychees are much more delicious than ours!”

Ma Zhiming and Tian Huixin couldn’t help but reveal a strange expression. It was indeed a little embarrassing that a world – Class tycoon couldn’t enjoy this kind of fruit.

However, a child’s words carried no harm, and what Huanhuan said was true.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Huanhuan, eat more if it’s delicious. Brother ruofei has enough fruits here!” But you’d better leave some space in your stomach, there are still very delicious cherries over there!”

“En!” Huan Huan nodded heavily.

After tasting the lychees, they walked to the cherry Garden.

When they saw the purple – Red cherries, which were almost the size of ping – pong balls and were crystal clear, Ma Zhiming and Tian Huixin couldn’t help but take a deep breath.

The air was filled with the faint fragrance of natural fruits, which made people feel relaxed and happy.

The appearance of these cherries was too good. They were simply comparable to the peach Garden vegetables, like a piece of art.

Very quickly, Huanhuan, under Xia ruofei’s protection, impatiently went up the tree to pick a lot of cherries.

After Ma Zhiming’s family tasted the cherries, they were all conquered by the deliciousness without exception.

Huan Huan kept stuffing the juice into her mouth. Her pink cheeks were stained with the purple – red fruit juice, but she did not notice it.

Ma Zhiming and Tian Huixin looked at each other. They had come with the intention of returning a small favor to Xia ruofei.

However, after some inspection, Ma Zhiming found that the organic fruits of Paradise Corporation were fully qualified to enter the premium fruit stores under Hengfeng group. It was not an exaggeration to say that even in the high – end fruit sales chain of Hengfeng group, there was no fruit that could compare to paradise lychees and paradise cherries.

Ma Zhiming’s attitude had completely changed. He said with a trace of enthusiasm,”Xia Sheng, the quality of Taoyuan fruit is beyond my expectations. This kind of high – end or even top – grade fruit is exactly the same as the positioning of our premium fruit store under Hengfeng. I hope to be fully in charge of the sales of all the fruits for your company this year. The pricing can be decided by you! I can also decide to waive the channel fees, you only need to pay the necessary logistics and labor costs!”

Ma Zhiming was now completely conquered by Taoyuan fruit. Even if he didn’t earn a single cent, he was still willing to act as an agent for such top – grade fruits.

This was a very good promotion for Hengfeng’s high – end fruit brand. The invisible profit was far higher than the profit of the channel fee.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Mr. MA, I’m afraid there’s no way to be a full agent. Our paradise Corporation is currently focused on the domestic market. Although your fruit chain store also has branches in the country, its position is too high – end and too niche. From the perspective of our brand promotion, I definitely need to allocate a portion of the quota to other mass – Market super – Commercial channels.”

Xia ruofei had an unusual relationship with Ma Zhiming’s family, so he didn’t beat around the bush. Instead, he spoke his mind directly.

Ma Zhiming revealed a trace of regret, but he quickly said,”I understand. Xia Sheng, then please give us as much as you can if the conditions allow!”

“That’s for sure!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”we’re old friends. I’ll definitely do what I can. Mr. MA, I’ll try my best to give your company about half of the quota! I really can’t do anything about the other half. ”

“Thank you!” Ma Zhiming was overjoyed when he heard that. Thank you!”

Xia ruofei continued,”by the way, our farm has been expanding recently. It’s about to be checked and accepted. By then, our production capacity can be increased by about three times. We should be able to increase the quota of paradise vegetables for you.”

“That’s really good news!”Ma Zhiming said happily. At the moment, Peach Garden vegetables are in short supply in all the major hotel chains and high – end clubs around the world!”

In fact, Ma Zhiming had wanted to ask Xia ruofei to supply more Taoyuan vegetables for a long time. However, he knew the scale of Taoyuan farm. In order not to put Xia ruofei in a difficult position, he had never mentioned this.

Now that Xia ruofei had taken the initiative to mention it, Ma Zhiming was naturally overjoyed.

Ma Zhiming’s company was very busy, and Huanhuan had to participate in some talent learning during the summer vacation. Therefore, their family had to return to Hong Kong tomorrow. It was also because of this that they had to use a private jet this time.
