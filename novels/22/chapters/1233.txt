Chapter 1234: An old friend who came to visit late at night (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei was stunned for two to three seconds. Then, as if he had just woken up from a dream, he pressed the open button under the LED screen on the bedside table and walked out quickly.

At the door, a tall, blonde beauty had a faint smile on her face, and her bright, pure blue eyes seemed to contain a myriad of flirtatious expressions.

This late – night visitor was the Italy beauty, Monica, who had once had a one night stand with Xia ruofei. She was also the heir of the famous truffle family, the Grao family, and the Executive Vice President of the Grao group.

“Xia, are you surprised to see me?” Monica looked at the stunned Xia ruofei and asked with a faint smile.

“I’m a little surprised ...” Xia ruofei touched his nose and smiled awkwardly.

“Aren’t you going to invite me in for a drink?” Monica’s Blue eyes turned slightly and blinked at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei had been in a daze the whole time. He came back to his senses and quickly stepped aside.””Oh! Please come in!”

Monica smiled at Xia ruofei and walked into the Presidential Suite with elegant steps.

Xia ruofei, on the other hand, looked out guiltily and quickly closed the door.

Before he could turn around, he felt a soft and delicate body hugging him tightly from behind, causing his body to stiffen.

A faint fragrance wafted into Xia ruofei’s nose. The wild fire in his heart seemed to have been ignited.

Xia ruofei turned around and Monica’s sexy lips were already kissing him.

“Xia, I miss you so much ...” She mumbled.

At this moment, there was no need for words. All of Xia ruofei’s rationality had been thrown out of the window. He held Monica’s pretty face and responded enthusiastically without hesitation.

An intense and long – lasting battle started from the entrance of the Presidential Suite. It was not until the moon was high in the sky and the night was quiet that the two stopped fighting and lay down on the soft bed in the master bedroom.

“Monica, I’m so surprised to see you in Hong Kong ...” Xia ruofei stroked Monica’s charming golden hair and said softly.

Monica moved her delicate body to a more comfortable position and rested her head on Xia ruofei’s chest. She smiled and said,”Mr. MA has invited us. The truffle that is going to be auctioned this time has an unparalleled attraction, especially to our Grao family.”

Xia ruofei was slightly surprised. He thought that MA Xiong had only invited some rich people from the East and the West. Although the Grasso family had huge assets, they were in the truffle business! Didn’t they say that people in the same industry were enemies?

Xia ruofei was shocked.”At least one – fifth of the world’s truffle business is in your family’s hands. You ... Still need to purchase truffles from other companies?”

Monica laughed and said,”our family’s truffles are also purchased from truffle hunters, right?” As long as the price wasn’t too outrageous, we would definitely buy truffle that could break world records. This also represented the influence of a truffle company to a certain extent. At your auction at the beginning of the year, wasn’t it me who won the bid for the White truffle?”

Xia ruofei suddenly realized. He hugged Monica and said,””So that’s how it is! It seems that I made a wise decision to auction these truffles. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have met you in Hong Kong!”

Monica threw Xia ruofei a flirtatious look and said,””I saw the information Mr. MA sent over and guessed that this batch of truffles must have come from your company! That’s why I fought for the opportunity to come to Hong Kong for the auction. To be honest, I’ll never forget that night in Australia ...”

Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat when he heard this. At the same time, he felt a strong sense of achievement.

Easterners were more reserved. Although Ling Qingxue would always go limp and beg for mercy when they were together, she would never say such words that made his heart beat faster like Monica.

Xia ruofei put his arm around Monica’s exposed shoulder and smiled.”If I had known that you guys were also interested in top – grade truffles, I would have contacted you directly!”

“It’s not too late now!”Monica said, smiling.

Xia ruofei was a little embarrassed as he said,””All the truffles are on the auction list now. I can’t trade directly with your group this time ...” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Monica gently twisted her body and said,””Xia, the truffle harvest season has only just begun. This shouldn’t be the last batch of truffles your company is selling, right?”

“Of course!” Xia ruofei replied without hesitation.

“Monica, I understand what you mean ...” He asked with a smile.”But, if I take care of your company, what benefits do I get?”

Monica turned around and glanced at Xia ruofei flirtatiously. “I’ve already given you the biggest benefits. What more do you want?”

Xia ruofei laughed and hugged Monica.”If such benefits come a few more times, then I can consider the matter of the truffle ...”

After he finished speaking, he turned over. Monica didn’t expect Xia ruofei to be so lively so quickly. She couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise. However, there was some joy in her scream.

Soon, a series of subtle sounds came from the room ...
