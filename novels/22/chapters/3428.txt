Chapter 3429: The line between life and death (1)

Translator: 549690339 i

The world changed color.

The picturesque Jiangnan gardens suddenly turned into a tropical jungle where snakes, insects, rats, and ants ran rampant. It was still raining heavily, and the rain was flowing down along the wide leaves. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Xia ruofei’s expression was as calm as ever. He closed his eyes and threw out a large amount of formation materials. He quickly set up a trap and kill array around himself.

Just now, Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to probe forward and easily found a middle – Level Mirage beast hidden behind the bushes.

The Star Beast had already appeared on the trial Pagoda1 s seventh level. It was not surprising for another Shen beast to appear. Xia ruofei was already mentally prepared for this.

However, he was worried that Ling Qingxue’s cultivation level was too low and that she would be instantly lost under the illusion attack of the mid – grade Mirage beast, so he had protected Ling Qingxue in time.

In fact, Xia ruofei could easily see through the disguise of the intermediate – Level Mirage beast because of his great improvement in spiritual power.

In the previous rounds, he could only sense the mental fluctuation of a beginner – Level Mirage beast with his spiritual power. He could not do anything when he encountered a medium – Level Mirage beast

But now, he could easily find the hiding place of a middle – Level Mirage beast in a complex environment.

In addition, although the Mirage beast’s illusion attack was terrifying, Xia ruofei could clearly feel that it was different from before.

It was still a realistic illusion, but under Xia ruofei’s spiritual scan, he found that there wore still some flaws in the illusion. Naturally, it did not affect Xia ruofei’s mind much.

He could even create a certain connection with the real world’s environment and directly set up a trap and kill array around himself.

When a cultivator saw through the illusion, the impact on the mind would be reduced. Furthermore, Xia ruofei had a lot of experience in fighting with intermediate – Level Shen boasts, so he know how to reduce the impact of the illusion.

Therefore, he was not affected by the harsh environment of the tropical jungle. Instead, he locked on to the position of the middle – Level Shen beast with his spiritual power through the illusion. Then, the qushuang flying sword and the blue immortal sword shot out like lightning, piercing through the heavy rain and fog to kill the middle – Level Shen beast.

The middle – Level Mirage beast obviously didn’t expect Xia ruofei to find it directly. Therefore, when the qushuang flying sword and the blue immortal sword pierced through the fog and arrived in front of it, it reacted and hurriedly dodged,

The Mirage beast’s movement speed was much slower than the Star Beast’s. The attacking trajectory of the qushuang flying sword was very strange. Now, the coordination with the blue immortal sword was even more exquisite. Xia ruofei had already calculated the Mirage beast’s possible escape routes. The first attack of the qushuang flying sword was completely a feint. It directly drew an arc and blocked the direction in which the Mirage beast was escaping.

The middle – Level Mirage beast was caught off guard and crashed into it.

The middle – Level Mirage beast’s neck was pierced by the flying sword.

The flying sword of qushuang pierced through from the left and flew out from the right, leaving a large hole. A large amount of blood spurted out from the wounds on both sides. The middle – Level Mirage beast roared with anger and despair.

Xia ruofei felt the illusion around him start to shake violently. A large number of ferocious snakes and scorpions appeared in the tropical forest and rushed towards him with their fangs bared.

Obviously, this was the middle – Level Mirage boast’s last attack before it died.

A look of contempt flashed in Xia ruofei’s eyes. He turned a blind eye to the crocodiles and Vipers with their bloody mouths open. Instead, he continued to control the qushuang flying sword and the blue immortal sword to stab at the mid – grade Shen beast that was already at the end of its strength.

Puchi, Puchi!

With two muffled sounds, the mid – level Mirage beast’s head was directly penetrated by two flying swords from top to bottom, and it was nailed to the ground by the flying swords.

At this time, the middle – Level Mirage beast could not hold on any longer and its vitality was quickly lost.

The illusion that it had created with all its might also began to collapse.

Crocodiles, Vipers, scorpions … All the Vipers and beasts that had reached Xia ruofei had turned into smoke and disappeared. Xia ruofei’s vision returned to the scenery of the Jiangnan garden with a small bridge and flowing water.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and the two flying swords flowback to him. He also used his spiritual power to retrieve the corpse of the mid – level Shen beast and threw it in front of him.

The middle – Level Mirage beast was completely silent. Its snow – White fur had long been dyed red with blood. Its eyes were wide open, full of unwillingness.

A satisfied smile appeared on Xia ruofei’s face. This was the second time he had encountered an intermediate – Level Shen beast. He could now kill it easily.

Such an improvement was much more obvious than when he had first encountered the Star Beast.

The reason was very simple. When dealing with this kind of monster that was good at illusions, it mainly depended on the level of spiritual power.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power cultivation was already very close to the spiritual transformation realm of the average nascent soul cultivators. Compared to the last time he encountered the intermediate Shen beast, it was twice as strong. Hence, not only could he use his spiritual power to find the hiding place of the intermediate Shen beast, but the illusion of the intermediate Shen beast could hardly affect him.

In addition, the physical combat power of a medium – Level Mirage beast was much weaker than that of a Star Beast. Xia ruofei had taken the initiative with his cunning gentleman’s sword technique and unexpected attack. The moment the Mirage beast lost the initiative, it meant that it was doomed.

Xia ruofei was very satisfied with his progress.

He didn’t immediately move Ling Qingxue out of the spirit map’s space. Instead, he used his spiritual power to send a message to Ling Qingxue, who was in the space,””Qingxue, don’t worry. I’ve already taken care of that Mirage beast..’1
