Chapter 161: Shocking_1

“What?” MA Xiong cried out. MA Xiong was really shocked by the number. He quickly put down the piece of white truffle and continued to rummage through the box. After searching for four pieces in a row, the biggest giant truffle was finally found. MA Xiong’s eyes were filled with disbelief as he placed the White truffle, which was the size of a basketball, on the coffee table carefully. He rubbed his eyes hard and almost threw himself onto the truffle. After a long time, MA Xiong said loudly,”Zhiming, quickly inform Mr. Lawrence to come over!” Ma Zhiming was also in shock. He only came back to his senses after hearing MA Xiong’s words. He quickly got up and walked out of the living room with his phone. Xia ruofei simply took out all the truffles from the tidying box and arranged them neatly on the Super large coffee table in the living room. There were so many truffles, and each of them was of excellent quality. There were even five extra large truffles. The largest white truffle and black truffle could undoubtedly break the world record. The visual impact was extremely strong. MA Xiong stared at the truffles for a long time before he muttered,”This is unbelievable, unbelievable ... Xia Sheng, where did your friend find such high – Quality truffles? This is the taste of Pure Italy truffle!” Xia ruofei smiled but did not answer MA Xiong. MA Xiong immediately came back to his senses. He smiled in embarrassment and said, “I’m being presumptuous ...” “Xiasheng,” he quickly said,”if your friend has any truffles of similar quality, Hengfeng will take them all!” MA Xiong did not mention the purchase of the truffles because he knew that no one would be willing to sell such high – Quality truffles directly. The only way to maximize the profit was through an auction. “I can ask, but it’s the end of truffle season now. Even if there are, there shouldn’t be many left.” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “No matter how many there are, I’m taking them all!” MA Xiong said without any hesitation. Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. After a while, Ma Zhiming led the head chef of the hotel’s top – Floor restaurant, the Michelin star chef, Mark Lawrence, into the living room of the Presidential Suite. As soon as Lawrence walked into the living room, he smelled the unique smell of top – Quality truffles in the air. Then he saw the neat rows of truffles on the coffee table. Lawrence’s mouth was wide open, and his eyes were filled with disbelief. He shouted,””Oh! God! What am I seeing? Mr. MA, could it be that the stingy Grao family has already given you their auction item in advance?” “Of course not!” MA Xiong chuckled and said,”Lawrence, let me introduce you. This is my friend, Xia ruofei, Mr. Xia. He’s also the owner of this batch of truffles!” “Hello, Mr. Lawrence!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ve already tried your cooking yesterday. It’s super good!” “Thank you for your compliment, Mr. Xia!” Lawrence absent – mindedly thanked Xia ruofei for his praise. Then, he quickly asked,”if I didn’t hear wrongly, Mr. MA said ... You’re the owner of this batch of truffles?” “To be precise, I’m the representative of the truffle’s owner.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”but I have full authority to deal with this batch of truffles!” “Lawrence,” MA Xiong said,”I invited you here to take a look at the quality of these truffles.” “Mr. MA, even if you didn’t ask me, I would still have to take a good look.” Lawrence immediately said,”God ... Is this really white truffle? I’ve never seen such a huge white truffle before ...” As he spoke, Lawrence began to carefully observe every detail of the truffles, especially the few extra large truffles. He looked at them repeatedly for a long time. “Mr. MA,” he said, raising his head,”there is no doubt that the truffles are of the best quality. Even the most picky chef can’t find any flaws!” “Yes,” Lawrence continued,”I’m sure that the truffles that the Grao family is auctioning tonight will definitely pale in comparison to this batch!” MA Xiong was already an expert in truffles, and now that he had the opinion of a Top Chef, his judgment was further confirmed. “Thank you, Lawrence!” He smiled and nodded. “I should be the one thanking you, Mr. MA!” Lawrence said,”if you didn’t invite me here, how would I have the chance to see such a perfect top truffle?” Lawrence suddenly thought of something and quickly said,””Mr. MA, since these truffles are not going to be auctioned tonight, can you buy them directly? The top – Floor restaurant was in urgent need of such high – Quality truffles! Especially the biggest piece of white truffle, it fits Hengfeng Jiahua’s position as the top luxury!” “Lawrence, I understand how you feel,” MA Xiong said with a smile.”But I can’t let xiasheng’s friend suffer a loss. This truffle must be auctioned!” Then, MA Xiong said to Xia ruofei,””Xia Sheng, it’s not appropriate for us to get involved in the Grao family’s auction. However, I can contact the guests who will be attending tonight’s auction right now and choose some of the more powerful and high – Quality customers. After the Grao family’s auction, we will immediately hold a small – scale auction to auction your batch of top – grade truffles. What do you think?” “That’s great!” Xia ruofei said happily,”old Mr. MA, thank you!” MA Xiong had spared no effort in helping Xia ruofei. Even if he had to hold a small auction after the auction of others, it was still a taboo. After all, those customers were invited by the Grasso family to participate in the auction. It wasn’t easy for MA Xiong to achieve this. “Xia Sheng, you should keep these truffles in the cold storage first!” MA Xiong said,”it’s not good to be exposed to the outside for a long time ...” “Yes, yes, yes, quickly put it away!” Lawrence quickly said. Everyone packed the black truffle and white truffle into the respective boxes, and Xia ruofei and the others put them back into the refrigerator. Lawrence looked at the refrigerator reluctantly, as if he suddenly had x – ray eyes that could see through the refrigerator door and see the truffles inside. MA Xiong needed to visit his business friends who were also participating in the auction and promote Xia ruofei’s small auction. Therefore, the three of them quickly took their leave. In the evening, Xia ruofei ordered dinner and brought it to the Presidential Suite. After he was done, he went to the dressing room and changed into a full suit. All the clothes here were prepared in advance, and they were all top brands. For example, the dark gray suit that Xia ruofei was wearing was from the high – end Italy men’s clothing brand Brioni. Although it was not tailor – made, it was still sold for more than 5000 dollars. Clothes make the man. Xia ruofei, who had absorbed many exotic flower petals, had a natural affinity with nature. After he put on the Brioni suit, he looked even more handsome and charming. After changing into a formal suit, Xia ruofei strode out of the Presidential Suite in high spirits. He couldn’t help but feel excited. Tonight was destined to be a night of harvest for him!
