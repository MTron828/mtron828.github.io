When Xia ruofei said this, elonmask and gramus could not believe it. Of course, they had great hope, but when Xia ruofei said that he could be completely cured, it gave them a sense of disbelief.

Li Yifu had always idolized Xia ruofei blindly. When he saw that Elon Musk and glams were both stunned, he couldn’t help but say,””Mr. Masker, since Dr. Xia said he’s confident, then there’s definitely no problem. He never makes promises easily!”

Elon Musk came back to his senses. He stood up and said,””Doctor Xia, can you really cure little X completely? What’s the probability of a relapse?”

The probability of recurrence was still very high, and the metastasis was very fast, especially for the type of Strigoi that little X had. Once it relapsed, it was basically a death sentence, which was why the survival rate was so low.

Xia ruofei smiled.”In my opinion, the standard for a complete recovery naturally includes the factors that cause the relapse. If the relapse happens, can it still be called a complete recovery?”

“A hundred percent no – relapse?” Elonmask could not help but open his mouth, revealing a look of disbelief.

At this moment, an angry voice was heard,””Mr. Masker! I’m sure he’s a despicable liar! No one can guarantee that there’s a 100% non – recurrence rate for Strigoi!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the personal doctor of Elon Musk, Mannu, walked into the room with a few pediatricians.

After the nurse reported the situation to Mannu, he felt that something was wrong and quickly brought a few experts to little X’s room. Before they entered little X’s room, they heard the conversation between Xia ruofei and Elon Musk in the next room.

When Mannu heard Xia ruofei say that she was completely cured and had no relapse, anger rose in his heart. He could not help but push open the door and rush in.

Seeing the Furious Mannu, elonmask could not help but frown slightly and said,””Dr. Mannu ...”

“Mr. Masker, please forgive me for being presumptuous ...” Mannu bowed slightly to Elon masker and said,”I accidentally heard your conversation from outside. I couldn’t help it, so I barged in.”

“It’s fine,”Elon Musk waved his hand and said. Let me introduce them first! Dr. Xia, this is my private doctor, Dr. Manu, and his medical team. Dr. Mannu, this is Dr. Xia from China. In the field of Traditional Chinese Medicine ...”

“I’m sorry. Chinese medicine?” Mannu could not help but interrupt Elon Musk again and said seriously,”Mr. Musk, I know that you are very concerned about little X’s condition and hope to increase his survival rate as much as possible. Perhaps it’s because of this that some swindlers have a chance to take advantage of it!”

After he finished speaking, Mannu’s face was full of mockery. He looked at Xia ruofei with disdain and said,””As far as I know, your so – called Traditional Chinese Medicine is still using the most primitive method, extracting the pitifully small amount of medicinal ingredients from roots and bark. There are no scientific experiments, no precise instruments, no clear theoretical system ... If I remember correctly, there hasn’t been a Chinese medicine approved to enter the United States market yet! Perhaps your country has no intention of applying at all? Because you know that the so – called medicine you make from the bark of the roots can’t pass the strict drug testing standards and drug testing procedures of the United States!”

After firing off like a machine gun, Mannu turned his gaze to look at Elon Musk and said,””Mr. Masker! Medical science is a very rigorous discipline. You are a giant in the field of science and Technology, a legend in Silicon Valley! How can you believe in this kind of pseudoscience?”

It had to be said that Mannu’s momentum was still very strong. Even elonmask could not help but waver a little. However, when he thought of Xia ruofei’s unpredictable examination methods, and the temptation of Xia ruofei’s promise of a complete cure, he finally became determined again.

He said,”Dr. Mannu, I just want to let Dr. Xia try the methods of Chinese medicine.” Doctor Xia’s treatment doesn’t require surgery on little X, and it won’t damage his body. It won’t affect you and your team’s treatment work!”

“How can it not be affected?” Mannu opened his eyes in an exaggerated manner, spread his hands, and said,”all the Chinese medicine has not been tested. If it is rashly given to the patient, it will cause unpredictable consequences! Besides, I can’t guarantee that it won’t conflict with our medicine. If it goes out of control, it’ll be very dangerous. ” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Naturally, Elon Musk was inclined to let Xia ruofei try first. After hearing Mannu’s words, he could not help but look at Xia ruofei, wanting to hear how Xia ruofei would refute Mannu’s point of view.

From the moment Mannu barged into the room, Xia ruofei had a calm smile on his face. Even when Mannu belittled Chinese medicine, he did not show any displeasure, giving off an unfathomable feeling.

Only when everyone’s eyes were on him did he adjust his sitting position to be more comfortable. He glanced at Mannu and said lightly,””Mr. Mannu, right? Although your point of view is not worth refuting, since you’ve said so much, then I’ll ask you a few questions!”
