Zhu zhihang then realized that Wu Liqian was really going to report on her work, and it seemed to be a pretty good project.

He pondered for a moment and said,”alright then!” I’ll have to trouble you to come over, County Head Wu!”

“County Head, please wait a moment. I’ll be right up!” Wu Liqian was secretly relieved and quickly said.

Wu Liqian tidied up her appearance a little, then hurried out of the office and went straight to Zhu zhihang’s office.

Although he didn’t intend to intervene in the conflict between Wu Liqian and Liu haojun, Zhu zhihang still did a good job on the surface. When he saw the Secretary open the door for Wu Liqian, he not only stood up to welcome her personally, but also poured a cup of hot tea for Wu Liqian.

After both parties sat down on the guest sofa, Zhu zhihang smiled and said,””County Head Wu, tell me about the project in detail!”

“Alright, County Head!” Wu Liqian cleared her throat and said,”I met with the leader of Tao Yuan company tonight. The main purpose was to discuss this project ...”

“Paradise Corporation?” Zhu zhihang couldn’t help but blurt out. At the same time, his interest was greatly increased.

The Paradise Corporation was a star company. Previously, the company’s headquarters were in the Changping County area. A few days ago, after the headquarters moved, the county was still full of regrets! Of course, they were also very clear that a company like the Paradise Corporation couldn’t stay in Changping County, and it was inevitable that they would move to the Urban area.

Now, listening to Wu Liqian’s words, it seemed that Tao Yuan company was interested in investing in a new project in Changping. Zhu zhihang was naturally very interested.

He couldn’t help but ask,”what project does the Paradise Corporation plan to move to Changping?”

Wu Liqian took a deep breath and said,””The Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory is preparing to expand to a branch factory. The Taoyuan company feels that the investment environment in Changping County is very good and intends to move this branch factory to Changping!”

“Is this true?” Zhu zhihang was overjoyed. He could not believe his ears. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

This was simply a good thing that fell from the sky! The Paradise pharmaceutical factory could be said to be the best asset of paradise Corporation, and its revenue capacity was even more frightening.

Wu Liqian nodded.”The other party does have this intention. So I had a preliminary communication with them today.”

“Do they have any requests?” Zhu zhihang quickly asked,”we can provide as many preferential policies as possible within the scope of our authority. If we can’t decide, Secretary Zeng and I can report to the city and fight for it! In short, as long as they are willing to build their factory in Changping, everything else can be discussed!”

Zhu zhihang’s reaction was within Wu Liqian’s expectations. She carefully chose her words and said,””County Head, the Paradise Corporation hasn’t mentioned any specific preferential policy requirements yet. I think we should take the initiative to give them this to show our sincerity ...”

“Yes, yes, yes!” Zhu zhihang said,”what about the other aspects?”

“Today’s just the initial communication. They’ve roughly stated their needs.” Wu Liqian said,”first, it’s the land. The pharmaceutical factory needs about 1000 mu of land. The land that the peach blossom company has initially chosen is not far west from the farm, so they hope to expropriate the land that the farm is currently occupying. At the same time, they also want to expand the scale of the farm. This way, their industries can be connected and their assets can be managed in a unified way. In total, they need to acquire about 1800 mu of land.”

“Does it involve a relocation?” Zhu zhihang asked.

“I don’t know the details yet, but it’s almost all barren land, so there’s definitely no one farming it.” Wu Liqian said,”of course, some of the land may be the collective land of the villages below, but the peach blossom company said that they can compensate you according to the market price.”

“Then there shouldn’t be a big problem!” Zhu zhihang asked,”did you make any other requests?”

Wu Liqian said,”the peach blossom company hopes to give a certain discount on the land transfer price. In addition, we hope that the county government can help us solve the relevant supporting facilities, including two power supply lines, one for the main and one for backup, as well as water and other facilities.”

“There’s no big problem with that. ” Zhu zhihang said,”the construction of the pharmaceutical factory was originally an industrial land! It’s not a problem to give them a discount on land prices!”

“County Head, the peach blossom company will come up with a proposal as soon as possible,” Wu Liqian said.”This project is of great significance to our County’s economy. I hope that after you talk to Secretary Zeng, we can hold a Standing Committee meeting as soon as possible ...”

Zhu zhihang immediately understood Wu Liqian’s intention. She wanted to bypass the county Head office and directly send this issue to the Standing Committee. Once the county Head and the Secretary reached a consensus before the meeting, the probability of this issue being passed was extremely high. It would be difficult for Liu haojun, who was unprepared, to make trouble.

It was inevitable that he would offend Liu haojun, but in the face of his shiny political achievements, Zhu zhihang didn’t want this project to be ruined. So after thinking for a while, he nodded and said,””No problem! County Head Wu, I’ll report to Secretary Zeng at work tomorrow. Don’t worry, this matter concerns the development of the entire County. Secretary Zeng will definitely support you!”

Wu Liqian felt relieved and said,””Thank you, County Head! I’ll go back first then ...”

Zhu zhihang smiled and nodded,””County Head Wu, I’ll have to trouble you to keep in touch with the peach blossom company. If there’s any news, please let me know immediately!”
