Xia ruofei nodded casually, agreeing with Wang Boshan’s point.

Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou looked at each other, and then asked tentatively,””President Xia, then ... Can you part with your love?”

Xia ruofei frowned and said,””Director Wang, I like peach source Island very much too ... You guys ... You’re making things difficult for me ...”

Wang Boshan was secretly pleased with himself. He knew that when his opponent revealed such an expression, it basically meant that he was very close to success. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Wang Boshan could not help but shiver at the thought of the rewards he would receive from the sect after he obtained the Paradise Island.

In order to strike while the iron was hot, Wang Boshan pondered for a while and said,””We’ll add another 100 million dollars! The total price was 3.6 billion US dollars! President Xia, this price is already too high, and it’s also our bottom line ... If we add more money, our entire project’s capital structure will be destroyed, and the reconstruction of the other islands will also be affected. The company’s Board of Directors will definitely not agree!”

After he finished speaking, Wang Boshan looked into Xia ruofei’s eyes, trying to get some information from his expression.

There was a flash of greed in Xia ruofei’s eyes, and then it was replaced by a conflicted expression.

But Xia ruofei’s conflicted expression, according to Wang Boshan’s own judgment, was more of an act. However, when he heard the figure of 3.6 billion USD, the greed that flashed in Xia ruofei’s eyes should be his true thoughts.

As expected, after much hesitation, Xia ruofei finally nodded reluctantly and said,””Since you’re so sincere, it’d be rude of me to reject you ... How about this? I agree to this in principle, but I can only make a verbal agreement with you. As for the change of ownership, I’ll naturally take care of it after you transfer the money to my personal account. ”

Zheng Yongshou couldn’t help but say,””A verbal promise? After all that talk, he couldn’t even sign a contract? Wouldn’t that be a waste of time?”

Wang Boshan quickly replied in a low voice,””Martial uncle Zheng! Don’t be rash ...”

Then, Wang Boshan immediately explained to Xia ruofei,””President Xia, don’t be angry! My uncle is too impatient, and ... I personally think that a paper agreement is more secure ...”

Xia ruofei seemed to be a little unhappy. He looked at Zheng Yongshou with dissatisfaction, then said,””You guys don’t understand the process of transferring ownership of the Peach Blossom Island. In principle, the ownership of this Island is not allowed to be transferred. The Liu family transferred it to me in the name of gifting it to a junior of the family. I still need to go to the officials of the agate to coordinate this matter. It’s useless for me to sign the agreement before it’s settled! And even if the agate map agreed, the change of ownership also required both the buyer and the seller to be present at the same time to deal with it. If you take the agreement with you, they won’t admit it at all! Since you don’t trust me, then this business is over!”

Wang Boshan quickly said,”President Xia, please calm down!” President Xia, please calm down! That’s not what we meant ... My uncle is just a little anxious. After all, this project is too important to stars Corporation. ”

When Wang Boshan spoke, his face was filled with sincerity, especially the last sentence. It came from the heart, so it seemed even more sincere.

Xia ruofei then pretended to be angry and said,””Doing business is all about integrity. Only with mutual trust can cooperation succeed. Besides, my company in China is so big, do you think I can just run away?”

“Yes! Yes! Yes!” Wang Boshan quickly replied,”of course, we trust you! Then ... We’ll do it according to the plan you proposed, President Xia! We ... Will pay you a deposit first ...”

“Let’s forget about the deposit!” Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”I’ve already said that the success of this matter depends on the attitude of the officials of the agate. Besides, trust should be mutual, right?”

“Yup! You’re right, President Xia!” Wang Boshan said,”then how about we have a gentleman’s agreement?”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I agree!” I can guarantee that under the same conditions, I will have the priority to cooperate with your company! And I believe that it won’t take too long to coordinate with the officials of the agate, so the trade should be ready in three to five days at the latest!”

“That’s great!” Wang Boshan said excitedly,”Mr. Xia, I wish us a happy cooperation!”

Wang Boshan raised his cup and gestured to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei also smiled and picked up his glass. He clinked his glass with Wang Boshan’s and the two of them drank at the same time.

After they finished their business, they naturally started to chat about other things. Xia ruofei had been very cautious and did not let the other party see any flaws.

During this meeting, Xia ruofei had another result. He had previously summarized, sorted, and integrated all the theories about cultivation. Today, he had also partially verified it. At least, Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou did not realize that Xia ruofei was a cultivator, but Xia ruofei could see through their cultivation at a glance.

The lunch lasted for more than an hour, and both the host and the guests were happy.

It was mainly Wang Boshan who was looking for topics to chat with Xia ruofei. Zheng Yongshou, who had a higher status than Wang Boshan, seemed to be the kind who spent most of his time cultivating in the sect and was a little dull.

Xia ruofei took the initiative to chat with Zheng Yongshou. The other party’s reply was also very concise, as if he didn’t want to talk to Xia ruofei anymore.

In fact, this was also an agreement between Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou in advance.

It couldn’t be helped, Zheng Yongshou rarely walked in the secular world, and he knew too little about the ways of the world, so his emotional intelligence was really too low. It was easy to offend people when he spoke, so this matter was mainly left to Wang Boshan to deal with.

At first, Zheng Yongshou didn’t think much of it, but after the negotiation just now, he agreed with Wang Boshan’s point of view. According to Zheng Yongshou’s temper, he might have asked for a high price of four to five billion US dollars in the beginning, hoping that the other party would agree immediately. The facts proved that Xia ruofei was not a person who only saw money. He was very vigilant. If they had followed Zheng Yongshou’s idea, Xia ruofei might have noticed something was wrong long ago.

The other thing was about the verbal agreement. Zheng Yongshou almost messed up the matter once he opened his mouth, so he also realized that he was lacking in this aspect. He simply drank most of the time and watched Wang Boshan and Xia ruofei exchange toasts and pretend to be polite.

After lunch, Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou got up and left.

The two agreed to keep in touch for the next few days, and Xia ruofei also said that he would immediately leave for Peach Garden Island to deal with the official authorities of the agate. Once the agate had no objections, he would inform Wang Boshan to transfer the money. At the same time, both parties would go to the agate to complete the transfer procedures.

Although they didn’t put the agreement on paper, and Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou were more or less a little uneasy, but overall, the purpose of this meeting had been achieved. They were in a good mood when they left.

Xia ruofei was in an even better mood because everything was going according to his plan.

In addition, through this somewhat risky contact, he was certain that as long as he didn’t actively reveal his cultivation, Qi condensation cultivators basically wouldn’t be able to see that he was a cultivator.

In fact, other than the fact that his cultivation technique was more advanced and the purity of his true Qi was far higher than that of ordinary cultivators, there was another important factor. His mental power cultivation had already broken through to the spirit gathering realm, which was equivalent to a golden core cultivator. This also helped him to hide his cultivation.

After Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou left, Xia ruofei removed the trap & kill array in the courtyard and left quickly after paying the bill.

He didn’t waste any more time and immediately informed Liu An to apply for a flight route. They would Fly to Paradise Island today, and it was just in time to carry out the next step of the plan.

Everything was going very smoothly. This time, Xia ruofei could Return to Paradise Island openly and proudly.
