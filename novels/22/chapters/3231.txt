Grams had been listening to her boyfriend’s phone conversation. After elonmask hung up, she quickly asked,””Elrond, have you found a better medical expert?”

Elonmask heaved a long sigh and said with a complicated expression,””I don’t know either ...”

“What?” Gramus was confused. He looked at elonmask with wide eyes.”You don’t know either?”

Elon Musk made a hand gesture to calm down and said,””My dear, wait for me for a while!”

Then, he turned his head and waved to the Butler who was standing in the distance waiting for orders. After calling the Butler over, he ordered the Butler to send a car to the Beverly Hills Hotel immediately and gave him Li Yifu’s contact information.

In the end, elonmask warned,””You must maintain enough respect for Li Yifu! He’s a senior in the business world. ”

“I understand! Sir, I’ll personally take the car to pick Mr. Li up!” The Butler said respectfully.

Elon Musk nodded and waved his hand tiredly,””Go and come back quickly!”

The Butler went to the hotel to pick them up, while elonmask turned his gaze to grams and asked,””My dear, do you know about Chinese medicine?”

“Chinese medicine?” gramus hesitated.

“Uh – huh!” “Yes!” Elonmask nodded.

Grams shrugged and said,”I’ve heard some. There are a few Hollywood stars who like Chinese medicine in Chinatown, but they mainly do physiotherapy, rehabilitation, relaxation, and massage. I heard that Chinese medicine also uses grass roots and tree bark to treat people. The mysterious Easterners may not be able to strictly distinguish between witchcraft and medicine ...”

Elon Musk furrowed his brows and said,””Mr. Li Yifu recommended me a Chinese medicine practitioner ...”

“Oh! God ...”Gramus covered his mouth and said after a long while,” dear, you can’t be thinking of giving little X that black potion, right? I can’t imagine it ...”

Elonmask pressed down on grams ‘shoulders and looked into her eyes.””My dear, please calm down! Li Yifu is a well – known super – rich man in the United States. He shouldn’t be so ridiculous as to use a swindler who doesn’t know any medical skills to make fun of us!”

“Maybe he has a favor to ask of you, so he knows that you’re in a hurry to seek help?” “Maybe he’s been deceived,” gramus said. Anyway, little X is still so young, we can’t risk his health!”

Elon Musk shook his head and said,””If it was a normal disease, I definitely wouldn’t have done this. “But you’ve also heard Dr. Mannu’s analysis. The malignant level of flexor Carcinus is very high, and the one in little X’s body is especially dangerous. Even with the world’s best medical resources, the survival rate is only about one – third! If we use Dr. Manu’s plan, the risk is also very high! The Chinese medicine doctor Li Yifu introduced doesn’t require surgery or chemotherapy. Even if there’s a certain risk, I think it’s worth it to bet on the small probability. ”

Elonmask was a businessman, so he naturally used the risk – reward ratio to evaluate the feasibility of this matter. In contrast, he was much calmer than Grims.

After grams heard this, he pondered for a long time before nodding and saying,””Alright then! However, I have to be by little X’s side during the treatment process!”

“Of course, I’ll accompany you the entire time.” Elonmask said.

He actually didn’t have much hope for this.

……

In the Beverly Hills Hotel, after a discussion, Xia ruofei and Li Yifu decided that Xia ruofei and Li Yifu would go to the mansion of Elon Musk, while the others would rest in the hotel.

After all, they were going to treat a patient and not to visit. It was not appropriate for five or six people to go at once.

Soon, the Butler of Elon Musk contacted Li Yifu, and the car he brought had already arrived at the hotel.

Thus, everyone stood up and left the room. Song Wei and Ling Qingxue stayed in their rooms to rest while Chen Xuan and Yu Xin ‘er returned to their own rooms.

Xia ruofei took out an exquisite first aid box from the spirit map space. Inside it was a set of silver needles used by Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners, as well as some Traditional Chinese Medicine equipment, including a braziers.

He carried the first aid kit in his hand and went downstairs with Li Yifu. Soon, he saw the Butler of the Elon Musk family.

The Butler respectfully led the two of them to a Bentley before sitting in the front passenger seat and instructing the driver to return to the manor.

Along the way, Xia ruofei closed his eyes to rest. When the car was about to reach its destination, he opened his eyes and looked out the window. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Elon Musk’s mansion was located in Bellaire, Los Angeles. Like most super mansions, this small Manor was very private. It was surrounded by lush trees, and the whole house was surrounded by a golf course and forest, forming a corner.

However, Xia ruofei took a closer look at the house that could be vaguely seen in the distance. He could not help but feel surprised that the house was not as magnificent as he had imagined. It also did not have the technological sense that matched Elon Musk’s identity. On the contrary, it looked very simple and even a little old.

“How much does this house cost?” Xia ruofei asked, smiling.

“He should have spent more than 20 million dollars on this house!” Li Yifu said.

“Woof! It’s really not cheap!” Xia ruofei asked,”are property prices in the M Nation this expensive too?”
