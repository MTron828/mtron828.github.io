Chapter 462: You get what you pay for (3)

Xia ruofei nodded.”I’ve already planned to expand the farm. It’s not a big problem for the local government.”

“Qianqian is already the official in Changping,” Feng Jing said with a smile.”With her help, there won’t be any problems.”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment before he realized that Feng Jing was referring to Wu Liqian.

He smiled awkwardly and said,””Actually, the surrounding land all belongs to Dongkeng village. I have a good relationship with the village, and they also hope that these barren lands can be exchanged for real money. So, even without sis Wu’s help, it’s not a big problem to contract more land. It’s mutually beneficial!”

“Chairman,” Feng Rao said seriously,”I’ll talk to the relevant parties about renting the land as soon as possible. Then, we’ll start expanding the farm. I wonder if the funds ...”

“It’s not a big problem. ” Xia ruofei immediately said,”after the final payment for the building is paid, the company will still have at least a few million Yuan on its account. Moreover, the vegetable greenhouse can bring in a net profit of at least a few hundred thousand Yuan a month. This money is more than enough to expand production!”

“Then there’s no problem!” Feng Rao said happily.

Following that, Feng Rao reported some other things to Xia ruofei. The two meals that Lei Hu had ordered were almost cold, but Feng Rao was still very serious in reporting.

Of course, Xia ruofei felt that the advice she gave on the company’s management was very professional. He could see that she had put in a lot of effort into the report.

In the end, it was Xia ruofei’s repeated reminders that made Feng Jing stop in embarrassment. The two of them finished their dinner in Xia ruofei’s office.

After the meal, Feng Jing continued to talk about her thoughts on the company’s management. They only finished their discussion at around nine in the evening.

Through this conversation, Xia ruofei had a better understanding of Feng Jing’s professionalism. So far, Xia ruofei was very satisfied with Feng Jing.

The two of them stood up and left the office. Xia ruofei personally sent her to the door.

“Boss Feng, after work tomorrow morning, I will gather all the employees in the company and let you meet them.” Xia ruofei said.

Since the General Manager had just taken office, she naturally had to hold an all – staff meeting. She had to at least let everyone know that Feng Jing would be the second – in – command in paradise Corporation after Xia ruofei. Only then would she be able to give orders!

Feng Jing nodded in agreement with a smile.

Then, Xia ruofei said,”that’s all for tonight. CEO Feng, you must be tired from the long journey and working non – stop since you arrived. You must be tired. Go back to your room and rest early!” We can talk about it tomorrow. ”

Feng Jing shook her head.”I still have to come up with the recruitment proposal. I don’t usually go to bed this early. My room is just upstairs anyway. I’ll go back and rest if I’m tired.” Chairman, you can go back first! I’ll give you the plan tomorrow morning!”

Feng Jing returned to her office without waiting for Xia ruofei’s advice.

Xia ruofei looked helplessly at Feng Jing’s back as she disappeared out the door. He felt that this strong woman was really too scary.

He then thought about how Ling Qingxue was going to inherit the Ling’s restaurant in the future, and he couldn’t help but say in his heart,”Please don’t let Qingxue become like this in the future. I can’t stand it!

However, Xia ruofei was still very happy that his company’s employees were as dedicated as a scarryman ... No, a scarrywoman.

You really get what you pay for! 200,000 a year with 1% of the bonus was not an injustice!
