2786 The Taoyuan City guard team (1)

“RUO Fei, you did well!” Ling Qingxue gave Xia ruofei a thumbs – up.

It was the first time that she and Song Wei had seen Xia ruofei play in the stadium. Although it was only an internal match, there was a big difference between watching the match live and watching the videos on the internet. The biggest feeling was that the players were very fast.

Xia ruofei was slightly stunned and said,”eh?” You guys are here?”

“We’ve been here for a while!” Ling Qingxue giggled and said,”your brilliant performance, including that goal, didn’t miss a single one!”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”what do you think?” Did I play well?”

“Not bad, not bad!” Ling Qingxue praised,”you have the feeling of a professional player!”

In fact, those who were watching the match from the sidelines, including Ling Qingxue, Song Wei, and the coaching staff, did not feel it that deeply. Those who were playing with Xia ruofei on the field, regardless of whether they were his teammates or opponents, felt it even more strongly.

They could clearly feel that Xia ruofei had become more powerful this time. They could not tell exactly how he was more powerful, but he was more difficult to defend against. His dribbling became more erratic and his passing became more unpredictable.

Even so, the main players who were Xia ruofei’s teammates today could still feel that it was very comfortable to cooperate with Xia ruofei. It was as if they had played together for a long time and it did not seem like they had not gotten used to it at all.

In particular, the passes that Xia ruofei gave them were wonderful. Every time he passed, he would always be able to get to the most comfortable position.

When the dribbling player was blocked and pressed by many opponents, he could always see Xia ruofei’s figure in his line of sight and transfer the ball in time.

Xia ruofei seemed to be everywhere.

In fact, after Xia ruofei’s cultivation had improved, even if he deliberately did not use his true energy to cheat, his body’s coordination and reaction ability were much better than before. His floating duckweed steps had also improved a lot since the last time he played at Espanyol. When he was dribbling the ball, he would unconsciously use his body technique. This also led to the defensive substitute often being able to nimbly brush past Xia ruofei before he could even touch the corner of his shirt.

Ruby’s feelings were not as strong as the players on the field, but as an experienced coach, he could naturally see that Xia ruofei and his teammates had a tacit understanding and were not at all awkward.

Ruby could also tell that Xia ruofei had adapted to his teammates ‘playing style very quickly, and not the other players.

It could be said that the rest of the Spanish players only needed to play according to their usual habits and characteristics, and they would naturally be able to cooperate with Xia ruofei.

Generally, this situation was between players with a big difference in level. The high – Level players could accommodate the characteristics of the low – Level players, allowing the team to play more power as a whole.

Although Espanyol was in the middle – lower range of La Liga, it was still one of the five major leagues in the world! How bad could a player who could play as the main force of any La Liga team be?

However, Xia ruofei was able to coordinate with the players in such a short time. To be exact, he did not spend any time at all. How much higher was his skill level?

Ruby felt it was unbelievable. At the same time, he felt that it was a pity. With Xia ruofei’s talent and ability, if he were to enter professional football, his achievements would be limitless.

However, in any case, this was naturally a good thing for Spain. At least they would be able to give their opponents a headache in the next game against Barcelona, so Ruby was in a good mood.

The next training was mainly jogging and some small games, focusing on recovery. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei would not need to rest or adjust even if he played the entire La Liga, let alone an internal match of this level. However, he did not want to be alone. Since he had come to the training ground, he had to listen to the coach, so he completed the next training meticulously.

After the morning training, Xia ruofei went to the changing room to take a shower and change while Song Wei and Ling Qingxue continued to stroll around the training grounds.

Xia ruofei came out of the bathroom and walked to his wardrobe while drying his hair. After putting on his clothes, he picked up his phone and found that he had a missed call and a new email.

The call was from the old company commander, Ma Jia. Xia ruofei did not check the email and called Ma Jia back first.

Xia ruofei put his phone on speaker mode and placed it on the stool. Then, he quickly stuffed his personal belongings into his bag and carried it on his back. He picked up his phone and walked out, turning off the speaker mode at the same time.

At this moment, Ma Jia picked up the call.

“Captain, I didn’t have my phone with me just now. Were you looking for me?” Xia ruofei chuckled and asked,”have you had dinner?”

Xia ruofei finished his training at around 12 in the afternoon. It had been seven hours earlier in China, so it should be around seven in the evening.

“I’m just calling you after dinner. ” Ma su said,”ruofei, what time is it over there? I hope I didn’t disturb your rest. ”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I won ‘t!” He wouldn ‘t! I’m in Spain right now! It was just 12 in the afternoon! Old company commander, what’s the matter?”
