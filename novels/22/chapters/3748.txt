Xia ruofei silently used his sward technique. The Golden flying sword trembled slightly and floated in front of the three of them.

Xia ruofei gestured for Song Wei and Ling Qingxue to jump onto the flying sword.

The two of them had not reached the Golden core stage, so they could not fly on their flying swords. However, rhe entrance of the cave was not far from the square, so Xia ruofei could control the flying sword from there.

After the two of them jumped on rhe flying sword, they didn’t have Xia ruofei by their side, so they didn’t have much confidence and their legs were trembling.

Xia ruofei added an energy shield around rhe two of them to prevent them from falling.

Then, he laughed and said/’don’t worry, it’s just a short distance! ” 1’11 definitely send you down safely!”

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue nodded their heads and held each other’s hands tightly as they stood on their flying swords.

With a thought, the Golden flying sword carried the two of them out of the cave.

Although there was no cover at the entrance of the cave, Xia ruofei knew that there was an invisible barrier there. One could only leave but not enter. Once they left, they would have to go back to the Jade platform and could not enter through the entrance.

After flying out of the cave, the Golden flying sword slowly descended under Xia ruofeis control.

lr didn’t take long for them to reach the ground of the square.

Xia ruofei removed the protective shield and spoke into the walkie – talkie/”‘Alright, you guys stay below this cave!”

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue jumped off the flying sword. Xia ruofei continued/”Right, Wei Wei, help me put this flying sword into my storage ring!”

“Alright!” Song Wei said. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, Xia ruofei had already withdrawn his sword technique. Song Wei easily kept the Golden flying sword into her storage ring.

Then, Xia ruofei told the two of them to stand still. He took out the formation materials and started to set up the formation around them from 20 to 30 meters away.

Although the square had been peaceful and there was no danger, Xia ruofei did not dare to let his guard down. He had taken all the necessary precautions. Xia ruofei silently used his sword technique. The Golden flying sword trembled slightly and floated in front of the three of them.
