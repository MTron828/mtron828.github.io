Chapter 1183: Jaded skin cream press conference (2)_1

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei was wearing a tailored Breoni suit. He had an otherworldly and clean temperament, which made him look even more handsome.

However, Feng Rao was not in the mood to look at the handsome man. She immediately walked up to Xia ruofei when she saw him.

Xia ruofei greeted him with a smile.””Boss Feng, I just walked around, and the venue is well decorated! It’s quite impressive ...”

“Chairman, you’re still in the mood to look at the venue?” Feng Rao asked anxiously. The fire is already burning our eyebrows here ...”

Xia ruofei pretended to be confused and asked,””What’s wrong? I think it’s pretty good! Everything is in order!”

Feng Rao couldn’t help but stomp her feet and said,””What else? We’ve put on such a big show, but there are only a few hundred people in the audience. Now, there are more reporters than the audience. Isn’t this a joke?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”don’t worry!” You won’t be a joke!”

Feng Rao looked at the cold and empty outer field and said with a bitter smile,”Chairman, it’s not that I don’t believe you, but look at the current situation ... There’s less than an hour before the press conference starts, and how many people have come?”

“Don’t worry, don’t worry,” Xia ruofei said with a smile.”I won’t let you do a one – man show!”

As they were talking, Xia ruofei’s phone rang. He looked at the caller ID and smiled. “Aren’t they here already?”

He picked up the phone and asked,”what’s the situation?” Didn’t I tell you to come earlier ... Traffic jam ... Damn, when is there no traffic jam in the capital? Why didn’t you organize your men to set off earlier ... Alright, alright, I’ll be at the entrance, I’ll just come over!”

Xia ruofei put his phone into his pocket and smiled at Feng Jing.””Boss Feng, don’t worry. A huge wave of viewers will be here soon!”

“Really?” Feng Rao was a little skeptical.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”when have I ever been unreliable?” Get everyone to move, there will be a lot of people who want to enter later, so just issue the admission passes directly!”

Just as Xia ruofei was speaking, one of the staff members exclaimed in surprise,””They’re coming, they’re coming. There are so many buses!”

Feng Rao quickly turned around and her mouth was also wide open in surprise.

He saw a row of buses driving over from afar. The long convoy was so long that he couldn’t see the end at a glance. A conservative estimate was that there were at least dozens of buses.

Moreover, these buses were all painted in the same red color and had a LOGO that everyone was very familiar with.

Feng Rao rubbed her eyes and exclaimed in surprise,”Kyokuboku company?”

Kyokuboku gaming company was a famous e – commerce company in China. It had been developing rapidly in the past few years and had formed a strong momentum to catch up with the well – deserved Big e – commerce company in the country, the gold mining company. It occupied a large share in the fiercely competitive e – commerce industry.

Kyobei shopping mall was listed in the United States in 2014, and its market value had already exceeded 60 billion US dollars. The gap between it and the three Giants of the Internet industry was very small, and it was definitely worthy of being called the upstart of the Internet industry.

With so many buses from kyokuboku shopping mall coming over all of a sudden, could it be that the employees of kyokuboku shopping mall were all here to support peach blossom company’s new product launch? Feng Rao found it unbelievable.

Just as she was immersed in her shock, the first car had already driven to the entrance and slowly stopped.

The bus door opened and a few people got off first.

Feng Jing saw Xia ruofei’s friend, song Rui, and another young man in branded clothes get out of the car. Walking with them was a middle – aged man with short hair and a well – ironed suit. Feng Jing couldn’t help but gasp when she saw this man.

This was the founder and CEO of the famous jingbei company, Liu Dong. He was a legendary businessman who came from a rural area in Northern Jiangsu and started his career from scratch in Beijing. To think that he would also attend the conference of paradise Corporation made Feng Jing feel like she was in a dream.

While Feng Jing was still in a daze, Xia ruofei had already walked up to her with a smile.

“Song Rui, Zheng bang, thank you for your hard work!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”this must be President Liu of kyokuboku group! I’ve long heard of your name! I’ve long heard of your great name!”

Zheng bang was also song Rui’s good friend. He was one of the nouveau riches that song Rui had called out to introduce to Xia ruofei. This time, Xia ruofei had asked song Rui to take care of it. Zheng bang and the others had been mobilized by song Rui to help.

Liu Dong had his signature smile on his face as he shook hands with Xia ruofei.”Hello, President Xia!”

“Thank you, President Liu, for your strong support!” Xia ruofei said with a gentle smile.

“I should, I should!” Liu Dong said,”I’m good friends with both young master Song and young master Zheng. Young master Zheng even owns shares in our group!” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Liu Dong’s voice had a hint of a Northern Jiangsu accent, and it was that little bit of rustic tone that made him more approachable.

At this moment, Feng Rao also came back to her senses and walked over. Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Chief Liu, let me introduce you to our company’s general manager, Feng Jing. Boss Feng, I don’t think I need to introduce boss Liu!”

“Hello, President Liu!” Feng Jing quickly greeted. I’ve long heard of you ...”

Liu Dong was a legend in the Chinese business world. As an outstanding professional manager, Feng Jing naturally admired him, even worshiping Him.

Liu Dong shook Feng Jing’s hand and chuckled,””Hello, President Feng!”

Then, Liu Dong smiled at Xia ruofei and said,””President Xia, your company is very good – looking!”
