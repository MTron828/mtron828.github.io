Chapter 1076: Women’s money is so easy to earn (2)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei planned to leave the new house with a Pavilion for ventilation for half a year. He would move in when Lin Qiao had winter break and let the mother and daughter spend the new year in the new house.

Hu ‘Zi’s mother had moved back, and Lin Qiao had gone to college on Egret Island. Xia ruofei’s Villa suddenly became quiet.

Xia ruofei lived alone and was too lazy to cook, so he just went to the company cafeteria for every meal.

Feng Jing had been cooped up in the farm for the past few days. Fortunately, she had only become famous on the internet and wasn’t considered a superstar. Hence, the paparazzi at the entrance had left after a few days.

The sneaky people around the farm were also gone.

Feng Jing was in charge of the farm, so everything in the pharmaceutical factory was basically remotely controlled. Xue Jinshan had also been summoned back from Beijing by Feng Jing to research the early production of the Jushi cream.

There were no technical difficulties in the mass production of the jaded skin cream. What he needed to study was the category of the first batch of jaded skin cream to be listed, the pricing strategy, the publicity plan, and so on.

In the end, after everyone’s discussion, it was basically decided that the first batch of jaded skin cream would only be launched with the minty fragrance type. However, through different packaging and concentration ratios, it was divided into three grades.

The most expensive Jade bone ice Skin Series basically had the same concentration as the hand – made Jade skin cream. The packaging was also the most exquisite and exquisite, and the price was tentatively 3888 Yuan a bottle.

The second – grade congealed fat series had been diluted to a certain extent, and its medicinal effects were slightly worse than the Jade bone ice Skin Series. It was priced at 1888 Yuan a bottle.

The popular version was more diluted, and its efficacy might not even be half of the Jade bone ice Skin Series. It was named snow match, which was mainly targeted at ordinary consumers, but the price was still as high as 588 Yuan a bottle.

Xia ruofei was shocked when Feng Jing’s team came up with the pricing plan.

Even if it was an undiluted jaded skin ointment, the cost of each bottle would not exceed 30 yuan. If it was mass – produced, the cost would be even lower. However, it was simply a money – snatching act to sell it for 3000 to 4000 Yuan per bottle!

However, Feng Jing had casually taught Xia ruofei a lesson.

Do you think that the cost of those luxury brands ‘perfumes, skin care products, essence liquids, and cosmetic products that cost thousands of Yuan is high?

The high – end cosmetics on the market that were pursued by various fans now might not even have one – tenth of the effect of jaded skin cream, but the price was very high and still sold well around the world.

The cost of these cosmetics was also very low, and the advertising cost accounted for a large proportion.

All in all, after Xia ruofei heard it, he only had one thought: It was really easy to earn money from women these days ...

No matter what, Xia ruofei still agreed to Feng Jing’s proposal.

In just one day, Feng Jing’s plan had been adjusted again. This time, Xia ruofei was so shocked that his jaw almost dropped.

Feng Rao suggested that, in addition to the three grades of jaded skin cream that were normally sold, they should also introduce a limited edition of jaded skin cream.

Feng Jing’s suggestion was to release only 300 sets of this luxurious version of jaded skin cream every year. Each set was personally brewed by Xia ruofei and added with expensive essential oil. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

She even designed a luxurious outer packaging. The bottle was made of 33 layers of natural crystals, supported by three platinum rings.

In short, it was as luxurious as possible.

This luxury version of the Jade skin cream, which Feng Jing had named “skin code,” was sold in China for 100 bottles at 880000 Yuan a bottle. 200 bottles were sold overseas at a price of 150000 euros each.

Although Xia ruofei was already immune to the high price strategy, he was still shocked by the outrageous price.

Feng Jing explained to him that the luxury version of “skin code” wasn’t going to be released immediately. She planned to release it after the three series of jaded skin cream were released.

She had expected that the jaded skin cream would immediately take the world by storm, even leading the industry trend and becoming a high – end brand that everyone would fight to buy.

At this time, he could take the opportunity to launch the limited luxury version of “skin code.”

In Feng Jing’s words, the 300 copies of “skin codes” a year were purely for the sake of improving the brand’s style and earning some money at the same time.

After hearing Feng Jing’s explanation, Xia ruofei nodded in agreement after some thought.

This surprised Feng Rao.

She thought that with Xia ruofei’s lazy personality, he would not agree so readily if she asked him to brew three hundred portions of jaded skin ointment every year.

Feng Jing didn’t know that hand – made medicine could also be mass produced. Besides, Xia ruofei was the one who made the medicine. Did he really make it himself?

Xia Qing was Xia ruofei’s loyal spirit puppet, and his skills in making Jade skin cream were better than Xia ruofei ‘s. If he made it, it would be equivalent to Xia ruofei making it himself.

No matter what, Xia ruofei’s agreement to this plan made Feng Jing very happy.

She immediately began to arrange various tasks.

Xue Jinshan was going to stop the production line of the heart – nourishing soup in a few days. After a thorough cleaning, he would be ready to start the production of the jaded skin ointment.

Meanwhile, the approval was still being sent to the capital. Xue Jinshan had sent over the assistant factory manager that he had hired previously.

The heart – nourishing soup project had already connected with the State Food and Drug Administration. In the southeast province, there was he kun from the provincial Food and Drug Administration looking after them. Xue Jinshan did not need to personally look after the approval of a skin care product.

On the other hand, Feng Jing began to frequently call for meetings with the staff of the marketing department to formulate a marketing plan for the jaded skin cream.

At the same time, she also found a famous Italy fashion designer, Simon, through her classmate to design a crystal bottle for the limited edition “skin code”.

Hence, before the jaded skin cream was even on the market, a large sum of design fees had been spent.

However, Xia ruofei didn’t mind. He trusted Feng Jing’s ability. Once Yingluo’s limited – edition jaded skin cream was sold, the design fee would be returned with a few bottles.

The company’s focus had shifted to the mass production of jaded skin cream and Xia ruofei had started to slack off openly.

This time, he had a very good reason to prepare 300 portions of Yushi ointment, and he had to decoct it himself. The preparation work in the early stage was very heavy.

Feng Jing was also helpless about this, but she was already used to her Chairman’s lazy style and didn’t have the energy to complain.

It was now the middle of September.

The approval for the jaded skin cream had entered the final stage. If nothing unexpected happened, it would be approved very soon.

Meanwhile, Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory had already used a production line and officially started producing the jaded skin cream.

The green maple vines that Xia Qing had planted in the Archean realm were also harvested as expected. In the prescription that Xia ruofei had provided for the first batch of ground green maple vines, the amount of green maple vines used was very little. A production line consumed about 10 to 15 kilograms of green maple vines every month. Xia ruofei was able to supply a sufficient amount.

When the green maple vines in the mountain sea realm were harvested in batches, they would be even more abundant. Even if they had to provide green maple vines to ten production lines at the same time, there would not be any problems.

Tang Yitian’s family also took a private jet from Australia to the capital. Before they left, Tang Yitian called Xia ruofei and told him about their schedule for the next few days.

The entrepreneur Summit that Tang Yitian was going to attend would last for two days. After the summit, he planned to bring Tang Haoran around the capital for two days before the family of three flew back to Sanshan.

Hence, Xia ruofei, who had been slacking off for many days, cleaned the villa personally and told his disciple to come over as a guest. It would not be good if the house was too messy.

Just as Xia ruofei was busy cleaning the house, Feng Jing called him and said that she had something to report to him.

Xia ruofei had not been to the office for a few days, so he was too embarrassed to reject her. He took a quick shower and went to the office in the complex.

“Chairman, we’ve finished the publicity plan for the jaded skin cream.” Feng Jing immediately said when she saw Xia ruofei,”please check!”

Feng Jing handed Xia ruofei a proposal that was at least twenty pages long.

Xia ruofei had a headache when he saw the dense text. He flipped through a few pages and said,””President Feng, I won’t look at the specific plan. You can pick the main points and tell me!”

Feng Jing nodded helplessly and flipped open the same proposal in her hands.

Feng Jing had personally led the backbone of the marketing department to work overtime to come up with this proposal. After many discussions and revisions, the proposal was finally finalized.

Feng Jing was also very familiar with the contents of the publicity plan, so she quickly picked out the key content and reported it to Xia ruofei.
