Chapter 1504: Seemingly real yet illusionary (3)

Translator: 549690339

Most importantly, even if Xia ruofei knew that this was an illusion, he did not know how to break it. Was he going to keep repeating this forever? How was he going to get out?

As the scene changed, Xia ruofei’s expression changed again.

This time, he was not looking at the enemy he had killed, but his own comrade.

The lone wolf assault team often carried out missions for dangerous people, and there would be a reduction in manpower at any time. In Xia ruofei’s career in the Army, he had experienced many comrades – in – arms sacrificing their lives.

The first person who appeared in front of him was the leader of a team. During a border mission, a soldier of a team stepped on a trigger mine. In order to save the soldier, the leader of the team was seriously injured on the spot and died before the rescue helicopter landed.

Blood kept flowing out of the captain’s mouth. He looked at Xia ruofei with a bitter smile and said,””Blood Wolf, it’s really not a good feeling to be bombed by a landmine ...”

Xia ruofei kept panting heavily. The string in his head was so tight that it seemed like it would break at any moment.

Xia ruofei could kill the people who had died under his gun, but what about his former comrades? Even if he knew that everything was fake, it all looked so real. How could he do it?

Just as Xia ruofei was at a loss, one figure after another appeared beside him. He would never forget these people ...

There was the sniper of the fourth squad, little Zheng. He had been discovered by the enemy sniper during a mission, and when he was sacrificed, the powerful sniper bullet had almost blown half of his head off.

Xiao Mao, the communications soldier of the second squad, was shot in the face during a jungle battle and died on the spot.

The squad leader, old Luo, who had died on the mission at the three mountains, also appeared in front of him.

These people surrounded Xia ruofei. Some were reminiscing about the past while others were talking about how they felt when they sacrificed themselves.

Xia ruofei felt as if his head was about to explode. His entire body trembled and he panted heavily. His eyes were bloodshot.

At this moment, Xia ruofei’s eyes suddenly narrowed and he revealed a complicated expression. He urged Hu Zi to appear in front of him.

Lin Hu’s signature frivolous smile was still on his face. He carried his Type 95 automatic rifle in a very irregular posture and raised his eyebrows at Xia ruofei.

“Blood Wolf, you’re rich now! You’re already a Big Boss!” Lin Hu said to Xia ruofei with a smile.

Lin Hu and Xia ruofei were soldiers of the same year. They were both selected as lone wolves and had gone through life and death together. In the end, he had sacrificed himself to protect Xia ruofei.

One could imagine Xia ruofei’s mood when he saw Lin Hu under such circumstances.

He clearly saw that although Lin Hu was talking with a smile, there were shocking bullet holes in his chest and thighs. The jungle camouflage was already soaked in blood, and blood was still gurgling out as he spoke.

Xia ruofei knew that everything was fake, but he still couldn’t help but say in a trembling voice,””Hu, it’s all my fault ... I didn’t notice the sniper, or you wouldn’t have ...”

Xia ruofei did not address Lin Hu by his codename wild wolf. Lin Hu smiled and said,””Ruofei, we’re comrades. What do comrades do? Aren’t they just people who block bullets from each other on the battlefield?”

Xia ruofei could not help but tear up. He could no longer tell what was real and what was fake.

“Hu, after you left ... I contacted Auntie and Qiao’ er. I treated them like family and did my best to take care of them ...” He said.

“I know, I know ...” Lin Hu smiled and said,”brother, you’re so thoughtful ...”

“No, I haven’t done enough ...” Xia ruofei said.”I promised you that your mother will be my mother from now on ...”

Lin Hu did not let Xia ruofei continue. He waved his hand and said,””Alright, alright. Ruofei, it’s time for you to make a move ...”

Xia ruofei was stunned.

The corner of Lin Hu’s mouth curled up and he said,””We’re all dead, don’t tell me you forgot? Shoot! Shoot us and you’ll be able to leave!”

“No... No...” Xia ruofei’s voice trembled.”I can’t do it ...”

His hand that was holding the gun was trembling, and he was on the verge of a mental breakdown.

Lin Hu, squad leader Luo, Xiao Zheng, Xiao Mao, and the captain of the First Division were all trying to persuade Xia ruofei to shoot.

A cacophony of noises entered his ears. Xia ruofei felt as if his head was about to explode.

If Xia Qing could still sense the situation outside, she would find that Xia ruofei had been standing in the same place with his hands holding his head. His whole body was trembling and he was mumbling to himself. He was extremely agitated.

In fact, Xia ruofei was in a very dangerous situation. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

This illusory formation was very powerful. From a single enemy to multiple enemies, and finally to Xia ruofei’s sacrifice of his comrades, everything was done step by step. No matter how calm Xia ruofei was, he was on the verge of a mental breakdown.

This was the best time for the inner demon to take advantage of the situation.

Just as Xia ruofei was about to lose control and lose control, the great Dao technique in his body suddenly started to operate on its own.

Rays of light interweaved on Xia ruofei’s body. Xia ruofei, who was in the illusory formation, suddenly felt a cool sensation in his head. All the noise seemed to have disappeared.

Then, Xia ruofei felt a flash before his eyes and he was back in the darkness.

Even though it was pitch – Black here, Xia ruofei felt a sense of security.

He took out his Zippo lighter and looked at it. He realized that he had been standing still the whole time. There were more than a dozen bullet shells scattered under his feet. It was obvious that he had shot the enemy in the illusion array in reality.

Xia ruofei could feel that his clothes were already drenched in sweat.

This illusory formation was too real and too terrifying. He didn’t even know how he had walked out at the last moment, nor did he know that the great Dao Arts in his body had actually activated on their own at the most critical moment.

No matter what, he had finally walked out of the illusory formation.

Xia ruofei gathered his emotions and continued to walk forward with the Zippo lighter in his hand.

He had only taken five or six steps when he suddenly stopped. He saw a white figure within the range of the Zippo lighter.

The White figure had her back to him and was standing quietly not far in front of him. From the back, it should be a woman, because she had long hair that reached her shoulders.

Perhaps she had heard Xia ruofei’s footsteps, the woman slowly turned around.

She turned around very slowly and silently, giving people a strange feeling.

Xia ruofei looked at the White figure warily and clenched his gun.

Soon, Xia ruofei saw a white figure with the help of the Zippo lighter. The figure had turned around and his face was pale.

However, when Xia ruofei saw the face clearly, he was not afraid. Instead, he was overjoyed ...
