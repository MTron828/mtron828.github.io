Chapter 1427: An unintentional Willow (1)

Translator: 549690339

The Banyan Tree forum was the largest forum in the three mountains.

Although it wasn’t well – known in the country, it was a place that netizens of the three mountains often visited. After all, there was a lot of local news here, and it also had many convenient functions such as checking for illegal rent and so on.

That night, a post on the Banyan Tree forum had unknowingly become popular. In just a few dozen minutes, the number of views had exceeded 10000, and the system had automatically added the word “popular” as an icon.

The website administrator on duty had also monitored the reading data of this post from the back end. After checking the content manually, he immediately pinned the post to the top with his authority and linked it to a recommendation spot on the Forum’s home page.

This time, even more people saw it.

The post was called “the nouveau riche Company of the Year is born ahead of schedule. It’s going to be so bright that I’m going to be blinded.”

This was a post by a netizen with the online name “tricycle driver”, and it was the content of the annual meeting of paradise Corporation.

The tricycle driver wrote in the post,”Today, I saw a picture of the company’s Annual Meeting posted by my high school classmate on my WeChat moments. It was so bright that I was blinded. The general prize of their company’s Annual Meeting is a 1000 Yuan shopping card, the sixth prize is 3000 Yuan shopping card, the fifth prize is 5000 Yuan shopping card ... The special prize is actually a family luxury tour in Europe, which is estimated to be worth 150000 Yuan!

The main point is that I asked my classmates to find out that this company has a total of about 300 employees. Other than the general award, the official award winning rate is more than 30%! Basically, one – third of the people would be able to win at least a 3000 – Yuan shopping card!

There was also an award where a large amount of 100 – Yuan bills were scattered in The Glass Room, and the winning employee would go in and use a net bag to fish for money. However much money he got in the stipulated time was his. It was said that the least one had earned more than 20000 Yuan!

I just want to ask, are there any more rich companies like this? Give me a dozen!

The post was accompanied by many pictures, which were probably downloaded from his high school classmate’s moments.

This post attracted a lot of onlookers as soon as it was posted.

Usually, at the end of the year, companies of all sizes and various units would hold annual meetings. Such posts would be seen on the forum every three to five days. Many of the revelations were tidbits and did not attract much interest.

However, the ID of the “tricycle driver” gave the post a lot of bonus.

Because this person was also a frequent visitor of the Banyan Tree forum, the netizens who often visited the forum were very familiar with him.

The “tricycle driver” was actually a Civil Aviation pilot. The landing gear of the plane was one in front and two in the back, so this ID was actually a kind of joke.

He would often post some interesting things about his flight on the forum, as well as some high – altitude photography works he took in the cockpit during the aircraft’s cruising phase. This was a great satisfaction to the netizens ‘curiosity, so he was also a well – known netizen on the Banyan Tree forum.

A post from such a person would naturally be more convincing than a newly registered passerby.

Besides, although the “tricycle driver” was only a young co – Pilot, the salary and benefits of Civil Aviation pilots were very good. Even he felt that this company was very rich, so the netizens were naturally more interested.

That was why the post had more than 10000 views in just a few minutes.

The “tricycle driver” post also caused a heated discussion among the netizens.

Many netizens expressed their envy.

“Is this the legendary ‘other people’s company’? I’m so tired ...”

“The grand prize for our company’s Annual Meeting was only a 2000 – Yuan shopping card. I was so unlucky that I didn’t even win a small prize. In the end, I went home with a consolation prize of a barrel of oil ...”

“Upstairs, be content! Our company doesn’t have an Annual Meeting at all. The boss said that this year’s profits are not good, so according to the contract, we’ll pay a month’s salary as the final bonus of the year. Nothing else!”

“Op, why don’t you tell us what kind of company this is? I also want to apply for the job!”

“That’s right! Op, what’s the difference between this and sending a picture without balls?”

“Yes, yes, yes! Express company’s name! Let us poor ghosts worship him!”

Of course, it was impossible for there to be only one voice on the internet. There were praises and criticism.

Very quickly, there were many sour comments in the post.

“You’re playing to the gallery! A small company with two to three hundred people doing this is definitely to attract attention!”

“Hehe! Even BAT’s Annual Meeting wouldn’t be so generous. Why do I find it so hard to believe that this company would spend a few million Yuan at a single Annual Meeting?”

“They are either trying to attract attention, or...This company might be a multi – level marketing company! I’ve heard that such a company even organized a thousand – person tour group and booked the entire cruise ship!”

“I see that the original poster is an old ID, and the comments on his previous posts are quite good. Did he receive money to post this today?”

In response to these noises, someone quickly came out to refute.

“I don’t want to comment too much on what you said about that company. After all, I have no right to speak without investigating. But the tricycle driver is everyone’s old friend, and I think everyone in the forum knows what kind of character he has. If you say that he would help others create hype for money, I’ll be the first one to not believe it!”

“Hahaha! Those who said that the coachman was a water Army were obviously newbies. Who among the old altar members didn’t know that the coachman was a pilot? Do they need to ruin their ID for money?” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Also, I don’t agree with this company’s hype. The coachman already said that this was posted by his classmate on his WeChat moments. They’re only moving it over. Who would hype it up on their own moments?”
