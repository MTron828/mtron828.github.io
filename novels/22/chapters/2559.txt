When Xia ruofei scored, the game had officially entered injury time. There were more goals in the second half and the game was very fragmented at one point, so the referee gave them four minutes of injury time.

Now that the Spanish players were not in a hurry and they were already in the lead, Wu Lei naturally would not run into the goal to pick up the ball. Everyone was surrounding Xia ruofei and celebrating wildly.

Markelka even knelt down on one knee in front of Xia ruofei. It was a gesture of worshiping the king. He even motioned for Xia ruofei to put his foot on it, and then made a shoe – wiping gesture.

Then, the Spanish players surrounded Xia ruofei and jogged all the way to the away team’s stands to greet the Spanish fans who had come from afar.

Xue Jinshan and the others in the stands were cheering at the top of their lungs and waving wildly at Xia ruofei. At this moment, Xia ruofei was no longer just the chairman of paradise Corporation. Xue Jinshan and the others were completely infected by the fanatical football atmosphere and were now acting no different from real Spanish fans.

Valencia’s players were dumbfounded and their faces were ashen. The Spanish team’s celebration was a little long, but none of them stood up to protest. They had no intention of resuming the game at all.

Faced with such a Spanish team, Valencia’s players had the thought that they would be unrivaled. No matter how hard they tried, the opponent had a bug like Xia ruofei and could always score more goals than them ...

In the end, it was only under the intervention of the referee that the Spanish players slowly walked to their own half.

After the valentian team kicked off again, they did not organize any effective attacks. Their morale had been hit to the freezing point by Xia ruofei’s last goal.

The four minutes of injury time quickly passed.

The referee could also see that the valentian team had lost their fighting spirit, so when it was the 94th minute, he decisively blew the whistle and ended the game.

4 – 3, Espanyol had the last laugh at Valencia’s home ground and successfully took away three league points!

The moment the whistle was blown, Valencia’s players felt a sense of relief. They did not have to suffer on the field anymore!

As for Ruby and the coaches, players, and staff on the substitutes ‘bench, no one could sit still after the valentian team resumed their kick – off. They all stood on the sidelines and rushed into the field frantically as soon as the whistle was blown.

Although it was just an ordinary game in the long season, it did not prevent the Spanish team from feeling the sense of winning the final.

Because there was a big gap in strength between the two sides, the Spanish team did not expect to get points in this game. Getting a draw was already an unexpected surprise, let alone getting all three points.

In addition, the game was full of twists and turns. First, they were two goals behind, and after a hard – won equalizer, Valensia scored again. At this time, the whole Spanish team was in despair. They did not expect Xia ruofei to use a free kick and a half – turn to shoot in the air, directly snatching the three points from the Valensia team. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

This feeling of getting something back and getting it back was naturally more exciting than winning the game smoothly.

The Spanish team celebrated wildly at Valencia’s home ground, while the players of Valencia looked dejected. Some of them were so exhausted that they fell to the ground as soon as the game was over. The goalkeeper, Neto, sat on the goal line and lifted his Jersey to cover his face. The impact of the game on him was too great.

While his teammates were celebrating, Wu Lei ran straight to the side of the field to get a ball for the game. Then, he ran to Xia ruofei and stuffed the ball into his hands. He smiled and said,””Brother Xia! After the hat – trick, you must collect a game ball!”

“Yes, yes, yes!” Xia ruofei said,”I almost forgot about it if you didn’t mention it. I still don’t have any experience!”

“You’re a hat – trick without any experience. This is a bit of a blow!” Wu Lei said with a smile.

Xia ruofei rubbed Wu Lei’s hair and said,””You’re already on the right path. Keep going and you can also perform a hat – trick. No! We have to set a higher goal and have four great blessings!”

“En!” “Yes!” Wu Lei nodded firmly, his eyes shining with determination.

Ruby walked over and gave Xia ruofei a big hug.

Ruby said,”Mr. Xia, your performance was really amazing!” I really wish you weren’t our boss! That way, I can have a phenomenal star player in every game!”

Xia ruofei laughed.”It’s just a competition. It’s far from being a phenomenal event. This is too much ...”

“No, no, no! When I was shaking hands with Valencia’s manager just now, that guy was full of jealousy and told me to set the penalty for your breach of contract a little higher, or else there will be big teams waving checkbooks to poach you!” Ruby said.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.

Although the game had ended, the major sports channels and live broadcast platforms around the world were repeatedly broadcasting the highlights of the game, especially Xia ruofei’s three goals, which were constantly replayed from multiple angles.
