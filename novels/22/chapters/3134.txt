3135 Exchange meet (1)

“Master,” Luo Qingfeng immediately asked,”do you need me to go to the three mountains to help you?” I’ve already taught my trusted disciples how to control the sect’s great formation, so it shouldn’t be a problem for me to leave for a few days. ”

Xia ruofei said,”you don’t need to. You should stay in the sect and cultivate!” I asked you to send people here mainly to do some reception, security, and other such work. Because it’s an exchange between cultivators, it’s not very convenient for ordinary people to do it. ”

“Master, you’re gathering cultivators in the three mountains for an exchange?” Luo Qingfeng suddenly became a little nervous.”Then all the more I should come. I’m worried about my safety ...”

“Don’t worry! I can handle it by myself. ” Xia ruofei said confidently,”as long as you guard the sect well, that will be the greatest help you can give me. Qingfeng, it’s settled then. Tell the eight disciples to contact me directly after they reach the three mountains. I’ll arrange their accommodation and food and assign them tasks!”

“Yes! Master!” Seeing Xia ruofei’s firm attitude, Luo Qingfeng had no choice but to agree.

After everything was arranged, Xia ruofei finally heaved a sigh of relief. He took a sip of tea.

“Ruofei, did Chen Xuan give you a letter of approval?” Ling Qingxue asked.

“En!” Xia ruofei gulped down the tea and wiped his mouth.”Three days later, we will discuss the five Holy badges together.”

“Shouldn’t we find a resort in the suburbs for such an exchange?” Ling Qingxue asked in confusion,”if we put it in the Shangri – La hotel in the city center, would it ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”the city center is better!” It’s not like I’m going to fight and kill them, I’m just doing research and exchange! The city center was more convenient! Of course, if they came to the three mountains with other intentions, I still have ways to deal with them in the city center!”

The spirit painting was Xia ruofei’s biggest trump card. He had obtained knowledge from the Jade talisman of inheritance and there were many techniques within it. Even an Aurous core stage cultivator could easily fall for it if he did not understand these techniques.

Besides, Xia ruofei was more confident in his ability to escape.

He continued,”Qingxue, you and Weiwei must be with me the day after tomorrow. Don’t leave a five – meter radius around me.” If anything happens, I’ll be able to take care of you!”

Most of the people who brought the five Saint badges to the exchange were important figures of their respective sects and should be at least golden core cultivators. The first heaven society’s Chen Xuan was the young sect master and elder of the sect, and he was also at the Golden core stage. As for soaring Flower Valley and surging waves sect, if there were no accidents, it should be their sect leaders who came.

Soaring Flower Valley’s Valley master Liu Mansha and surging waves sect’s sect master Mu Sheng. These two had a good time with Xia ruofei during the auction. Strictly speaking, it was all thanks to Xia ruofei’s firecloud pill that Mu Sheng’s son, mu Jianfei, could recover and recover from his injuries.

However, there was no knowing what was in a person’s heart, especially when it involved major interests. Xia ruofei could not believe the beauty of human nature.

That was why he had requested for both Song Wei and Ling Qingxue to stay by his side. If anything were to happen, he would definitely not care about keeping the secret of the spirit map scroll. He would immediately put Ling Qingxue and Song Wei into his spatial space and then board the flying boat to escape. He wasn’t confident that he could escape unscathed from the siege of two mid – Stage golden core cultivators. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Ling Qingxue could hear the seriousness in Xia ruofei’s tone. She quickly said,””I know ... I’ll tell Weiwei.”

Then, Ling Qingxue said worriedly,””But ... Even if you can protect us, what about your paradise Corporation? And our family, Wei Wei’s family ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”I’m talking about the worst case scenario. Generally speaking, there shouldn’t be any conflicts.” However, if they really dare to lay their hands on ordinary people, then they’ll be mortal enemies!”

Xia ruofei’s eyes were filled with killing intent as he continued,””Even if I’m not as strong as them for the time being, they won’t have an easy time either! In the future, they will face my endless pursuit, and their disciples can forget about walking in the world of cultivation. I will kill anyone I see!”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but shiver. She continued,””Right! Attacking ordinary people was crossing the line! If you had that black flying boat, you could really come and go like the wind and become their nightmare! But ... Uncle song wasn’t an ordinary person! He’s already a cultivator!”

Xia ruofei frowned and said,””The shielding talisman I gave uncle song shouldn’t be able to be seen through by ordinary Aurous core stage cultivators unless Chen Nanfeng is there personally ...”

Xia ruofei felt that Chen Nanfeng’s ability was a little strange. It was as if he could see through everything. Hence, he was not sure if the shielding formation could hide from Chen Nanfeng.

“There’s usually no problem with that!” Xia ruofei said,”besides, uncle song’s identity is special. People in the cultivation world are usually unwilling to attack high – ranking officials in the secular world. Otherwise, there will be a lot of trouble ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”Qingxue, I’ve already said that this is the worst situation! I think ... The probability of this happening is very small, so there’s no need to worry. I asked you to stay by my side just in case! The main theme of this meeting is probably to exchange and discuss with each other!”

“Mm! I got it!” Ling Qingxue nodded and said,”you should rest well for the next two days! You must maintain your best condition!”

“Don’t worry!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’ve been maintaining my condition well!”

For the next two days, Xia ruofei did not go to the office. Chen Xuan, on the other hand, seemed to have forgotten about this matter as he continued to work hard.

The next day, Xia ruofei checked into the Shangri – La hotel.

As the host, he had to be there first to arrange everything.

The eight disciples of the star Seizer sect had also arrived at the three mountains. The leader was still the disciple who had experimented with wild tea, Wang Shan Lao Ai. He was now a ninth – tier Qi refining cultivator and could be considered a pillar of support in the star Seizer sect. It was naturally not a problem for him to lead a team for this kind of external mission.

All the disciples were very respectful to Xia ruofei, and Royal Mountain was even more so.

Xia ruofei had arranged for them to stay at the Shangri – La hotel. He had asked Qin Yanan to Book 15 rooms, which should be more than enough. If it was not enough, they could add more rooms at any time. Paradise Corporation was considered a big client.

Therefore, Wang Shan and the other eight people had their own King – sized rooms.
