2239 A warm welcome_The mushroom house.

He Jiong, Huang Lei and the rest were all busy with their own matters.

Huang Lei was in the kitchen, arranging the ingredients provided by the festival Group.

Xia ruofei ordered pork stew with vermicelli, but there was no pork or vermicelli here. However, according to the rules of the show, there was a 100 yuan daily food fee. There was also a public market in little Tang town, but with so many people, 100 yuan a day was not enough to buy too many ingredients, so they had to make careful calculations.

Everyone stopped what they were doing when they heard someone knocking on the door.

He Jiong shouted in an exaggerated tone,”students!” The guests are here! Time to receive guests ...”

“I’ll open the door!”Zhang Xing said quickly.

As this season’s newcomer, although Zhang Xing was a popular young hunk, he had always kept a low profile. Of course, this also had to do with his personality. He was a very gentle person, and even seemed to be a little submissive.

Zhang Xing quickly walked over and opened the wooden door.

Xia ruofei held onto the handle of his luggage with one hand and waved at Zhang Xing with a bright smile on his face.”Hello, Zhang Xing!”

Xia ruofei already knew who the regular guest of the show was. Besides, Zhang Xing was very popular on the internet, so not many people did not know him. Although Xia ruofei did not pay much attention to entertainment news, he could still recognize Zhang Xing.

When Zhang Xing saw Xia ruofei, he was stunned. He pointed at Xia ruofei with his eyes wide open and stuttered,””You ... You ...”

Xia ruofei raised her eyebrows and asked,””You ... You know me?”

Only then did Zhang Xing come back to his senses. He shouted excitedly,””I know her too well! President Xia! You’re my idol!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be stunned. He touched his nose and said humorously,””Zhang Xing, if you say that ... Will your fans kill me?”

Zhang Xing had tens of millions of fans on Weibo.

Zhang Xing scratched his head in embarrassment and said,”No, no... Not only am I your fan, but I’m also a loyal user of your company! It’s just that your jaded skin cream is too hard to get ...”

Fine! There was another wave of invisible advertising.

Of course, this was not arranged by the festival team. Zhang Xing had no idea that xiangnan TV had invited Xia ruofei over. What he had just said came from the bottom of his heart.

As a popular artiste, Zhang Xing knew that he could not casually mention the specific brands of the products during the show. However, this was a recorded show after all, and there were still post – editing to be done, so he did not pay much attention to this.

However, Zhang Xing did not expect that not only would his speech not be cut out, but it might even be highlighted in the post – production.

Xia ruofei did not expect Zhang Xing to be so honest. He was stunned for a moment before he laughed and said,””Our company will take care of all the jaded skin ointment you use in the future!”

“Really?” Zhang Xing asked excitedly. That would be great! Then there was no need to rush! Thank you, President Xia ... I’ll help you promote your products more in the future!”

To be honest, even if Zhang Xing were to slightly promote the Jade skin cream of paradise Corporation on his Weibo, the advertising fee would be worth a lot of Jade skin cream.

“Then I’ll have to thank you first!” Xia ruofei laughed.

As the two of them were exchanging pleasantries, He Jiong, Huang Lei and Peng Chang also walked over to the source of the voice.

“Little Star! Why was he standing there and chatting? Please invite our guests in!” He Jiong laughed as he walked over and said,”let me see who this mysterious guest with a northeast accent is ... Wow!”哇哇哇......我没有看错吧! Oh my God ...”

He Jiong looked extremely surprised and surprised, as if he did not know the guest’s identity in advance.

Otherwise, why would they call him a professional?

“President Xia!” Huang Lei was also surprised.”The production team is amazing! I can’t believe they actually invited you to participate in the recording ...”

He Jiong also chuckled and said,”the director wants to add chicken legs!” This guest is tough!”

Naturally, Peng Chang recognized Xia ruofei. However, as a newcomer, he did not approach her. Instead, he stood at the side and smiled shyly.

Xia ruofei grinned and said,”teacher he!” Huang Laoshi! Peng Peng! How are you ...”

“Hello, President Xia!” He Jiong said enthusiastically,”President Xia actually knows us! I’m really surprised!”

Peng Chang also smiled, showing his white teeth.””Yup! That’s right! I didn’t expect President Xia to know me! I’m really flattered ...” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Huang Lei smiled at Xia ruofei and said,””President Xia, welcome, welcome! Please come in!”

“Yes, yes, yes! Let’s go in and talk!” He Jiong said,”Pengpeng, what are you standing there for? Hurry up and help President Xia with his luggage! You have good eyes!”

“Oh! Oh! Oh!” Peng Chang hurried over to take Xia ruofei’s luggage.

“Thank you!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Xia ruofei walked into the courtyard of the mushroom house, surrounded by He Jiong and the rest.

He looked at the building with some curiosity.

This was a small two – story building. There was a very spacious courtyard outside, and there were sheep pens on the side. A long pergola was built on the outermost side of the courtyard. There was a coffee table, a deck chair, and so on inside. It was very enjoyable to look at the scenery here.

The entire building was built in the style of a small farmhouse. Straw capes, bamboo hats, and some farming tools were hung on the outer wall under the eaves. There were two sheep in the sheepfold, bleating.
