……

Zhou leiyun and the other two went to the other side of the room to have tea, leaving Xia ruofei and Zhao Zhenghao at the dining table.

“Mr. Xia, I’m sure you’re well aware of why I’m here,” said Zhao Zhenghao with a serious face. On behalf of the Chinese Football Association, I would like to make a statement: The Chinese national team is in urgent need of a player like Mr. Xia. We are very grateful for your enthusiasm for the country and will do our best to provide you with all the convenience that can be provided!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded,”thank you!” I have indeed felt the sincerity of the Chinese Football Association. ”

“So, Mr. Xia has officially agreed to join the national team?” Zhao Zhenghao asked happily.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”when I posted on Weibo, I already made this clear. My thoughts haven’t changed. I still think that it’s my duty to serve the country. It’s my duty!”

Zhao Zhenghao couldn’t help but praise,”Mr. Xia, you’re so understanding, I’m impressed!” To be honest, even if Mr. Xia and I were in your shoes, I’m afraid we might not be able to make such a decision. ”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Vice President Zhao, I like to put the ugly words in the beginning. I do have some special circumstances. I need the Chinese Football Association and the national team to make it convenient for me.”

Xia ruofei was no longer a three – year – old child. Naturally, he would not get carried away by a few flattering words.

“Of course!” Replied Zhao Zhenghao. Of course! The reason why I came to Spain in person this time was to talk to Mr. Xia. After all, I can make most of the decisions, and it will save me the trouble of asking for instructions and reporting back and forth! So, Mr. Xia, if you have any requests, please feel free to let me know!”

Xia ruofei nodded.”I see that Vice – President Zhao is a straightforward person. I will not beat around the bush. I will get straight to the point.”

“Just say it! Just say it!” Zhao Zhenghao laughed and said,”it’s only right to give special treatment to special talents. As long as it’s within my authority, I’ll agree to it on the spot. Even if I can’t make the decision, I’ll go back and do my best to coordinate it. In short, I’ll try my best to meet your requirements!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”then I’ll thank Vice President Zhao first.” In fact, I don’t have many requirements. First of all, I may not be able to participate in the entire training of the national football team, but I will try my best to participate in a few joint training before the game. ”

Actually, with Xia ruofei’s ability, he did not need to train with the national football team. He could still cooperate well with others. However, since he had promised to do this, he wanted to do his best. So, it was better to understand the characteristics of his team members in advance so that he could perform better in the competition.

“No problem!” Zhao Zhenghao said without thinking.

This was within Zhao Zhenghao’s expectations. After all, Xia ruofei was not a professional football player and had such a big business. The outside world estimated that his net worth was in the billions, and this was only his wealth on the surface.

The national football team’s training lasted for at least half a month. How could a Big Boss like Xia ruofei be locked up in the training base for half a month and participate in the entire training like those professional players?

Zhao Zhenghao had also learned about the situation before he came. Xia ruofei was the same when he was with Espanyol. He did not usually train with the team. Last time, he played directly. This time, he came a few days earlier to train with the team.

The reason why Zhao Zhenghao chose to come to Barcelona to talk to Xia ruofei and even specially watched the game between Espanyol and Barcelona yesterday was to see Xia ruofei’s success.

Xia ruofei’s performance in the competition had made Zhao Zhenghao worry less.

Xia ruofei’s performance was much better than the players of Espanyol and even most of the players of bar?a. If such a player joined the national football team, he would be a super killer! What’s the big deal with giving him some special treatment?

Moreover, he could feel that Xia ruofei’s background was very powerful. Even if he was unwilling, he had to agree to Xia ruofei’s reasonable request.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”thank you!” As for the second point, I hope that I can make my own decision to participate in the competition. “I hope Vice President Zhao can understand that I’m too busy and might not be able to participate in every match of the national football team ...”

“This ...” Zhao Zhenghao hesitated.

The national football team recruited Xia ruofei to play in the world Cup qualifiers. If Xia ruofei was not willing to participate, wouldn’t it be a waste of effort?

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Of course, I also know the importance of the next few competitions. There are a few that we have to fight to the death. I will try my best to participate in these competitions.” I mean ... For some less important warm – up games, as well as the second half of the qualifiers, if the national football association has already advanced ahead of time, or if the situation is better for the advancement and the opponent’s strength is weak, I hope that the Chinese Football Association and the national team can also give understanding and support if I really can’t make time. ”

Zhao Zhenghao also felt relieved and said,”If that’s the case, there shouldn’t be a problem! However ... Mr. Xia, although our grouping for the top 40 matches is good and our opponents seem to be weak, they are not easy to play. So, I still hope that you can participate in the top 40 matches as much as possible ...”

Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and said in surprise,””It can’t be, right? Could it be that the strength of the national football team had degenerated to the point where they could not even win against teams like Guam and Maldives? If that’s the case, even if I’m here, it won’t help! After all, football has always been a team sport, and there is always a limit to an individual’s strength. ”

“Not really,” Zhao Zhenghao quickly said,”but the Philippines and Syria in the group are not easy to play.” Although we have the absolute advantage in the historical records of our national team against these two teams, they have improved very quickly in the past few years, while our national team ...”

Zhao Zhenghao didn’t continue. Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I understand...Then let’s do this for now! The Philippines and Syria, home and away games, I’ll try my best to participate in all of them. In addition, I’ll try my best to participate in the home games against Guam and Maldives if I’m in China! If it’s an away game ...”

“If Mr. Xia really can’t find the time, then forget about the away game!” Zhao Zhenghao quickly said.

Xia ruofei had already given him a lot of face. If he couldn’t even satisfy such a small request, then he would really be insensible. What’s more, even if the strength of the national football team had declined, it was not to the extent that they could not even take down small fries like Guam and the Maldives. Although the offensive power of the national football team’s Vanguard was not very good, they were still more experienced in bullying noobs.

According to the technical team’s analysis, the only possible variables were the games against the Philippines and Syria. As for Guam and Maldives, the team’s general assessment was that the national football team would be able to win the games with a big score.

Zhao Zhenghao was already very satisfied that Xia ruofei had agreed to play in the Philippines and Syria.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”these are the main requirements.” The rest are just some small problems, such as being unable to gather with the national team before the game and so on ...”

“No problem!” Zhao Zhenghao said without hesitation. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Mm! In short, as long as I agree to participate in the competition, I’ll make it a little special in management! But I promise it won’t affect the competition. ” Xia ruofei smiled.

Then, Xia ruofei asked again,”by the way, Vice – President Zhao, you’ve agreed to all my conditions just like that. Will there be any problems with the national football team’s coaching staff?””

Xia ruofei knew that the current coaching staff of the national football team came from Italy. The head coach was the world – Class manager, Lippi. These big – Name coaches demanded a high degree of autonomy and did not like the Chinese Football Association interfering with their work. They did not like the existence of special players in the team.

After all, such players were likely to become an unstable factor in the locker room.
