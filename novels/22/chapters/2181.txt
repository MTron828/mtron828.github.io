2182 The awakening of the realm Fox (2)

“Stop!” Ling Qingxue said. Stop! Stop! Don’t tempt me! I won’t be able to focus on my work if I do this ...”

“It’s okay to go out for a day or two occasionally ...” Xia ruofei said.”We don’t have to go to the sea far away! They would just take a walk around the coastal waters and stay at sea for a night. They would return the next day. You can’t possibly be so busy that you don’t even rest on the weekends! As long as I have time on the weekends, it’s enough. I won’t delay anything!”

“Then ... Why don’t we see if you’re free this weekend?” Ling Qingxue asked, a little tempted.

Xia ruofei said,”I must have time!” Wife, I even got a yacht driver’s license. Isn’t it so that no one will disturb us when we go out to sea? Let me tell you, on the vast sea, you’ll feel like there’s only the two of us left in the world. It’ll be a world for the two of us ...”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but reveal a look of yearning as she said,””Then I’ll arrange the work in advance. Let’s go on a yacht this weekend!”

“This is right!” Xia ruofei said,”it’s a good balance between work and rest!”

The two of them chatted as they drove to the Riverside Villa area. They hadn’t seen each other for more than ten days, so they had a lot of topics to talk about.

Xia ruofei had always been a good listener. He did not feel annoyed at all when he heard Ling Qingxue talk about her company matters, including her assistant’s breakup. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Ling Qingxue was also very interested in what Xia ruofei had seen and heard at sea. She kept pestering Xia ruofei to tell her about it.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei’s experience on the sea these days was very rich. Even if the part on green Immortal Island was excluded, there were still many things to talk about.

This included casting a net on the affinity platform to fish, as well as catching blue lobsters.

“Waa! “There really are blue lobsters ...” Ling Qingxue’s eyes widened when she heard that.”I’ve seen it on the internet before. I thought it was dyed ...”

“It’s really a blue lobster. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s dark blue all over. It’s this big!”

After Xia ruofei finished speaking, he took his hands off the steering wheel and gestured the size of his hands. Then, he quickly tightened his grip on the steering wheel.

“Did you bring it back?” Ling Qingxue asked.

“I’ve eaten it!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”he’ll definitely be dead if he doesn’t reach the shore. I caught him and steamed him on the yacht the day I caught him!”

“Ah ...” Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but pout, looking very regretful.

“Qingxue, if you want to eat blue lobsters, let’s go out to sea to catch them next time!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“It’s a very small probability to be caught even once! I’ve heard that this variant is very rare!” Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”if I can really be caught by you twice in a row, then you can really go buy a lottery ticket! No! Even the probability of winning the lottery is lower than this!”

“That’s not for sure. Why don’t you take a look at your husband’s character?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”as long as you have confidence in me, I will definitely catch another blue lobster for you!”

“I don’t believe it ...” Ling Qingxue thought about it and still felt that the possibility of this was too low.

Xia ruofei rolled his eyes and smiled.””Then, why don’t we make a bet?”

“A bet? How to bet? What are we betting on?” Ling Qingxue asked.

“Let’s bet on whether I can catch a blue lobster this weekend!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”didn’t you say that the probability is extremely low? How was it? Do you dare to bet?”

“What do you want to bet on?” Ling Qingxue said.

“I can’t figure it out in such a short time ...” Xia ruofei said.”How about this? if I can catch the blue lobster, it’s my win, right?” Then you have to agree to one of my requests!”

“What if you can’t catch him?” Ling Qingxue asked.

“I’ll agree to a request of yours!” Xia ruofei said without hesitation,”you can also make a bet now! As long as it’s within my means, there’s no problem!”

Ling Qingxue giggled and said,”I’m in a situation where I won’t lose!” Ruofei, you’re losing to me on purpose, aren’t you? then ... If you can’t catch it, I’ll punish you ... You’re not allowed to leave the three mountains for a month. You have to accompany me every day and make me a wild Chinese perch every day!”

“You have a big appetite! Aren’t you afraid of getting sick of it after eating it for a month?” Xia ruofei laughed and said,” This request isn’t too much, I agree!”

Ling Qingxue said excitedly,”I’ll say this first!” It must be caught from the sea on the spot! Otherwise, it doesn’t count! What if you didn’t eat the blue lobster you caught last time and put it in the refrigerator to freeze? when we get out to sea, you can take it out and say you won. That won’t do!”

“Do I look like that kind of person?” Xia ruofei said,”don’t worry! It was definitely fished out from the sea on the spot. You can be there to supervise and witness the entire process!”

The blue lobster that Xia ruofei had caught the last time was being raised in the space ocean! Moreover, many young lobsters attached to the blue lobster were also fished up. Xia ruofei was almost certain to win the bet.

If he felt that it was a pity to sacrifice such a huge blue lobster for the bet, he could set up the time array flag at the Archean realm and let Xia Qing use the water of the space ocean to breed two young lobsters in the array.

The time array flag and the time flow of the Archean realm could reach 2000 times the normal speed. There were still a few days before the weekend, so he had more than enough time to ripen a few lobsters.

If he won the bet and got Qingxue to agree to one of his requests, it might come in handy one day! Xia ruofei laughed in his heart.

Ling Qingxue tilted her head and thought for a while. She felt that there was no flaw in this matter. It was simply impossible for Xia ruofei to win.

Hence, she said,”I’ll bet on it!” I don’t believe that you’re so godly! RUO Fei, you can’t go back on your word if you lose! One month! Not even one day less! Furthermore, you are not allowed to leave the three mountains no matter what happens!”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei said,”do you want to make a pinky?”

Ling Qingxue laughed and said,””Childish!”

The two of them chatted and laughed as they returned to the Riverside Villa area.

After entering the house, Xia ruofei let Ling Qingxue rest in the living room while he went to the kitchen to prepare lunch.

Xia ruofei felt lucky that he had cleaned up the first floor in the morning. Otherwise, there would be dust everywhere when he entered the house, and there would be no place to sit.

Ling Qingxue also enjoyed the feeling of being taken care of by Xia ruofei. She obediently did not cause trouble in the kitchen and turned on the television to watch a blockbuster.

Xia ruofei was busy in the kitchen. He first retrieved a long river beluga from the ocean in the spirit map space.

This Chinese perch could be said to be completely wild. It grew in such a unique environment like the spirit map space and was absolutely fresh. Even Xia ruofei had Great Expectations for the taste of this Chinese perch.

The method of making pomfrets was not complicated and Xia ruofei had already learned it. Very quickly, he had processed and steamed the pomfrets.

Then, he released his mental power to observe for a moment and found that Ling Qingxue was still focused on watching the television. He took out some Peach Garden vegetables from the medium, then took out some organic mountain Black pork, ribs, duck, and other ingredients from the refrigerator. He began to prepare them skillfully.

For a time, the sound of knives cutting the anvil rang out, as well as the occasional sound of pots and pans colliding, and the sound of the pressure cooker blowing out ... All kinds of sounds converged into a Symphony full of life.

Xia ruofei was wearing an apron and humming a song as he busied himself in the kitchen. He was in a very relaxed mood.

“This Chinese perch should be almost done ...” Xia ruofei mumbled to himself.”You can turn off the fire and let it keep warm ... The ribs should be slightly crushed. Qingxue likes to eat rotten ones ...”

At this moment, Xia ruofei heard a childish voice in his head.””Xia ... Xia ... Xia ruofei!”
