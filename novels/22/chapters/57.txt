Chapter 58: Returning with a full load (1)

The cutting blade slowly cut into the raw stone, making a sharp friction sound. However, they were not as nervous as they usually were when they were cutting stones. Almost everyone was waiting to see Xia ruofei make a fool of himself, especially Cheng Junhua, who had made a bet with Xia ruofei. Boss Chen sighed in his heart. He felt that Xia ruofei was young and full of vigor. This time, he was going to suffer a big loss. The raw stone was not big, and it was quickly cut into two. Xia ruofei brought over a basin of clear water and poured some water on the cut surface to wash off the stone powder. Seeing Xia ruofei’s serious look, Cheng Junhua couldn’t help but mock,””Brat, you’re not trying to buy time, are you? Don’t dilly – dally! I’m still waiting to win money and leave ...” Just as Cheng Junhua finished speaking, someone beside him exclaimed,””It’s Green! It was green! A huge increase ...” The onlookers were excited all of a sudden and squeezed forward, wanting to see what kind of Jade could be cut out of this raw stone of extremely poor quality. The two halves of the mirror were full of green, and the onlookers were in an uproar. “Young man, quickly wipe it clean and let us see it clearly!” “Aiya! What a pity, this is a whole piece of Imperial Jade! It’s cut in half from the middle by this young man, so its value will be much lower ...” “He’s just a free gift. He didn’t spend a single cent. No matter what, he’s making a big profit!” …… There were all sorts of comments, and even boss Chen was almost squeezed out of the crowd. He had to maintain order loudly. If a raw stone that was worth hundreds of thousands of Yuan or even millions of Yuan had an Emerald, people might not be so excited. It would be strange if it didn’t come out! However, this trash gift actually had Jade, and it was a huge increase. Everyone’s mood immediately changed. One blade to heaven, one blade to hell, the excitement of stone gambling was precisely here. The fat rich man, Cheng Junhua, was completely stunned. He couldn’t believe his eyes. He felt like he was dreaming. Did that trashy raw stone really have a huge increase in green? What kind of F * cking luck does that kid have! This kind of almost zero – Probability thing had actually happened. Cheng Junhua’s heart bled at the thought of losing three hundred thousand Yuan. However, the people around them were just enjoying the show. They didn’t care about Cheng Junhua’s feelings at all. They were still discussing and marveling at him. Soon, the cut surface was cleaned, and everyone could see it more clearly. An expert immediately said,””It’s an ice glutinous species! The water head was pretty good! It’ll definitely increase by a lot!” There were also people who started bidding on the spot. “Little brother, the quality of your raw stone is not bad. I’ll pay 80000. Sell it to me!” “You have the nerve to bid 80000? Little brother, I’ll give you a real price, 100000! I’ll pay in cash!” “One hundred and twenty thousand, I’ll take it ...” One after another, the bids rose, and the price quickly soared to 150000. Xia ruofei smiled and stood up. He raised his voice. “Everyone, I’m sorry, but I still have a use for this Jade. I’m not selling it!” The onlookers immediately quieted down when they heard this, but they didn’t feel too regretful. After all, this raw stone was not big, and the quality of the Jade could only be said to be above average, not the kind of top – grade Jade. Xia ruofei said to the stonecutter,””Master, I’ll have to trouble you to help me with the rest!” “Good, good, good!” The stonecutter quickly said. As the stone was being cut, the onlookers still didn’t leave. They all wanted to know how much valuable the Jade would be after all the stones were cut out. Cheng Junhua’s eyes were wide open as he watched, praying that Xia ruofei was just lucky enough to cut the outer layer of the Jade. There would be no more Jade if he cut further in. Of course, even Cheng Junhua himself did not believe that there was no Jade inside the stone. He could only comfort himself. The stonecutter skillfully cut open the whole raw stone, and then carefully wiped off the outer Stone Skin. After more than half an hour, two fist – sized jadeite were completely cut out. “It’s the ice glutinous type. These two pieces of jade are worth at least two or three hundred thousand Yuan!” “This young man’s luck is really heaven – defying!” “Boss Chen, the shop next to yours has free gifts, right? I’m going to spend some now and get a free raw stone to play with!” “Let’s go together! I’ll go too!” People who gambled on stones believed in luck. The price of Xia ruofei’s raw stone Rose sharply. Even the gift that was originally placed in the corner of the shop next door, which was scoffed at by the experts, immediately became a hot commodity. In an instant, more than half of the people rushed to the shop next door. Spending more than twenty thousand Yuan to get a free raw stone was a piece of cake for these buyers. Boss Chen did not expect that Xia ruofei’s stone cutting would have such an effect. He was overjoyed. Today’s sales in the Jade Shop were going to increase again, and it was all thanks to Xia ruofei! The way he looked at Xia ruofei became friendlier. Xia ruofei put the two pieces of jade into his bag and looked at Cheng Junhua. Then, he said to boss Chen,””Boss Chen, you’re a witness. There shouldn’t be any surprises with the result of this bet, right?” “Of course!” Boss Chen said with a smile,”so many people are watching!” Little brother, you’ve won this bet! Director Cheng, you don’t object to it, right?” Cheng Junhua’s face turned as dark as a pig’s liver, like a defeated rooster. Although 300,000 was not a big sum to him, it was still quite painful to lose. Especially after he had lost so much face in front of so many people, it made his heart itch with hatred. However, the truth was right in front of him, and he could not deny it at all. He just snorted coldly and did not speak with a gloomy face. Xia ruofei said,”just transfer the 300000 to spirit Jade house. I still need to buy jade from boss Chen. Just deduct it from the payment.” “No problem!” Boss Chen said with a smile. Soon, the waiter brought the credit card machine over. He swiped Cheng Junhua’s card and transferred 300000 Yuan. Cheng Junhua entered the password with a dark expression. After the transfer was successful, he took the card and left without a word. Boss Chen warmly invited Xia ruofei to a cubicle in the shop. He personally made tea for Xia ruofei and then asked,””Little brother, what’s your name?” “My surname is Xia!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”boss Chen, I want to buy some Jade from you. I’ll buy the first batch for 300000 Yuan! If we work well together, I’ll buy from you for a long time, and the demand will be even greater in the future. ” “Sure!” Boss Chen said happily. Brother Xia, do you have any requirements for the quality of the Jade?” Xia ruofei pondered for a moment and said,”of course, it’s best if it’s of a higher quality. At the very least, I’ll have the ice – nuo type jade like today!” Boss Chen, can you provide it here?” Boss Chen knew what to do when he heard that. He was afraid that if Xia ruofei wanted to buy the king’s Green, even Lingyu house might not be able to produce it immediately. As long as Xia ruofei could get the highest quality and the worst ice glutinous type, it would be easy. “No problem! I’ll immediately inform people to prepare! A batch of Jade just came in two days ago, so 300000 Yuan in stock is no problem!” “Then, thank you, boss Chen!” Xia ruofei said. “You’re welcome! I should be the one thanking you for taking care of my business!” Boss Chen said as he handed over his business card,”brother Xia, this is my business card. Next time you need anything, just call me directly!” Xia ruofei took the name card and said,””I don’t have a business card yet, I’ll give you my phone number!” Then, Xia ruofei gave boss Chen his number. The two of them sat and chatted for a while. Then, someone knocked on the door and came in to tell them that the Jade that Xia ruofei wanted was ready. A small bag of Jade was worth 300000 Yuan. Xia ruofei didn’t know much about Jade, but he had a spirit map with him. He could tell the value of jade from the reaction of the scroll, so he didn’t have to worry about being cheated. He opened the bag and picked up the pieces of jade to check. As expected, the spirit paintings all had different reactions. This meant that boss Chen was running the business with integrity and didn’t give him fake goods to fool him. Xia ruofei kept the bag of Jade with satisfaction and said to boss Chen,””Boss Chen, the Jade is pretty good! Then let’s settle the deal!” The 300,000 that Cheng Junhua had lost to Xia ruofei was enough to pay for the goods. He did not have to pay a single cent to get the Jade. There was no better deal than this. Speaking of which, he had to thank that nouveau riche! “Hahaha! Thank you, brother Xia, for taking care of my business!” Boss Chen said forthrightly,”next time, call me directly if you need anything!” “Alright!” Xia ruofei said. After he politely refused boss Chen’s invitation to dinner, he left the spirit Jade house with the bag of Jade. He went to the parking lot to get his car and drove straight to the holiday villa in the suburbs. Xia ruofei couldn’t wait to go back and let the spirit map scroll continue to absorb the Jade to see if it could evolve again.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m
