2307 One drink and one Peck_If Ge Jun was so determined to be Xia ruofei’s disciple previously, it was mostly because Xia ruofei had the Traditional Chinese Medicine inheritance passed down by the GE family’s ancestor. However, after the exchange, Ge Jun’s thoughts changed and he was even more determined to be Xia ruofei’s disciple.

Because Xia ruofei’s views had opened his eyes. Usually, a simple sentence or two could make him see the light. Even though they were just discussing an ordinary prescription, Xia ruofei’s understanding gave Ge Jun a fresh and new feeling.

Unknowingly, Ge Jun had started to view himself as a scholar and he admired Xia ruofei from the bottom of his heart.

Through this exchange, Xia ruofei could confirm that Ge Jun was not lying. He was indeed Ge Hong’s descendant. It was impossible to verify their blood relationship, but at least in terms of medical skills, Ge Jun’s knowledge was full of traces of Ge Hong’s sect.

Chinese medicine was also divided into many schools. Although they all had the same goal and everyone’s goal was to treat and save people, different schools would have different concepts of Chinese medicine. There would also be subtle differences in the treatment of a certain case. Xia ruofei had inherited many Traditional Chinese Medicine theories from the Jade talisman of inheritance. He could easily judge Ge Jun’s Traditional Chinese Medicine based on his performance.

This was something that could not be faked unless Ge Jun’s knowledge of Chinese medicine was more comprehensive than Xia ruofei’s and his standard was much higher.

During the conversation, Xia ruofei gradually came to a decision.

“Old GE,” he said after some thought,”aren’t you curious where I learned all these medical skills?”

Ge Jun chuckled.”Sir, I’ve wanted to ask for a long time. But ... I was worried that it would be abrupt!”

“Actually, it was also a coincidence. When I was young, I met a Daoist with the surname GE. My medical skills were all taught by this Daoist GE.” Xia ruofei said,”at first, I didn’t know what I was learning. I just memorized a lot of it. Later, I slowly started to master it. Especially after some practice, I felt how amazing the medical skills that this Taoist GE taught me were!”

This Taoist GE was naturally made up by Xia ruofei. He was a Fictitious character. The purpose of him saying this was to find a legitimate origin for his medical skills, and at the same time, to lay the foundation for the next suggestion he was going to make.

When Ge Jun heard the name ‘Taoist GE’, his eyes lit up.

Their ancestor, Ge Hong, was an Alchemist himself. Not only was he proficient in Traditional Chinese Medicine, but he was also obsessed with alchemy.

Ge Hong’s descendants were not few in number. Once Xia ruofei said that his medical skills were taught by a Taoist with the surname GE and that he knew the cloud – rubbing needle technique, the answer was obvious.

“Mr. Xia!” Ge Jun said excitedly. The Daoist priest who taught you medicine is most likely a member of my GE tribe!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The GE family had been passed down from the East Jin Dynasty. After so many generations, they had countless descendants. It was impossible for them to all know each other, especially after several generations, they basically had no contact.

Ge Jun’s branch had always maintained the inheritance of Traditional Chinese Medicine from generation to generation. It was not impossible for the other GE family members to have inherited the medical skills, and it was a relatively complete inheritance.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”now it seems that it is very possible. It’s just that I didn’t think of this when I was young. I only know that the” three volumes of cloud contact “was written by ancestor Bao Puzi. I didn’t connect the Taoist priest with Ge Hong.”

Ge Jun asked excitedly,”Mr. Xia, what’s the name of the Daoist GE who taught you medicine?” I’ll go back and check the genealogy, maybe I can find it!”

Xia ruofei shook his head.”I don’t know ... I only know that he called himself Taoist GE. He never mentioned his name, so I didn’t ask.”

Ge Jun said regretfully,”why didn’t you even tell me your name?” Then ... Mr. Xia, where is this Taoist GE now? He’s most likely my Clansman, so I want to pay him a visit!”

Xia ruofei pretended to be sad and said,””When I was 15 years old, Daoist GE passed away. I remember that he was neither sick nor suffering. In his words, he was at the end of his life. He passed away very calmly ...”

Ge Jun was stunned, she had already passed away? Then ... Wouldn’t that mean that they would never be able to verify it?

Of course, the so – called verification was not because Ge Jun doubted Xia ruofei’s medical skills. Especially the technique of the nine cloud contact needles, which had already made Ge Jun 100% trust him. Ge Jun felt that since this Daoist GE had inherited such a complete “three volumes of cloud contact”, it meant that their branch was very likely to have very high attainments in Chinese medicine. As a member of the GE family, Ge Jun naturally wanted to get to know and Exchange ideas.

However, he didn’t expect that just as a glimmer of hope rose, the clue was cut off again.

Xia ruofei looked at the dejected Ge Jun and smiled,””Mr. GE, since I’m pretty sure that my Chinese medicine teacher is your Clansman, and the medical skills I’ve learned are from elder Ge Hong, I won’t refuse if you want to learn!”

Hearing this, Ge Jun’s eyes widened. Just a moment ago, he was still sighing in regret that he had missed the chance to obtain a complete inheritance from his clan. He did not expect to hear this heavenly news again.
