Halfway through the race, the star of Hong Kong was only one horse’s head ahead. Although it didn’t seem like an obvious advantage, in a short – distance race, this kind of advantage that could be seen with the naked eye was actually very big.

However, accidents often happened in an instant.

No. 4, who was in second place, seemed to be running out of stamina and was gradually caught up by No. 2. The rider of No. 4 tried his best but couldn’t find a way to make sure that the horse wasn’t as good as it was. It couldn’t accelerate in the back, so he could only sigh in vain.

The jockmen could only use their experience to try and grab the advantageous position.

Although the rules stated that one could not deliberately obstruct or affect other participating horses, the rules were often vague. Experienced riders could take advantage of the small changes in direction through prediction.

The rider of horse number four was an experienced rider.

He had used his experience to stop horse number two from overtaking him several times in a row, and he had done it without leaving a trace. Even the video playback could not determine that he had violated the rules.

The rider of horse No. 2 was relatively young, and after suffering a loss, he gradually became angry.

In addition, they were about to reach the finish line, so in the third attempt to overtake, the tactics became a little more aggressive. Although horse number four occupied a very favorable position and used himself and the position of the “star of Hong Kong” to block the position of horse number two, the rider of horse number two still urged his horse to rush up, hoping to squeeze into the narrow gap to complete the forced overtaking.

The result of this reckless action was that the three horses crashed into each other.

The “star of Hong Kong” had been in the lead since the start of the race, so the rider was also focused on running to the finish line. He didn’t know what was going on behind him, and was caught off guard.

Horse No. 2 had run into horse No. 4, and then the star of Hong Kong.

The “star of Hong Kong” lost his balance, and horse No. 2 fell down after two collisions.

With that, the “star of Hong Kong” was also brought down.

Horse No. 2 smashed heavily on the star of Hong Kong’s back leg.

It was a complete mess ...

Although the horses behind them tried their best to avoid it, two of them still couldn’t avoid it in time and crashed into it. The speed of the other horses was naturally affected. On the contrary, horse No. 4 was only slightly affected and was the least affected. It immediately gained a huge lead.

The rider of horse No. 4 was overjoyed. He galloped straight across the finish line.

This time, there was no need for a replay on the big screen to see that the champion was horse number four.

However, everyone was stunned by the incident just now and no one cheered.

Guo Hongjiang was even more stunned. His mouth was wide open as he stared at the scene.

After a long while, he finally reacted and rushed out of the private room, running towards the field.

“This is bad ... I hope he’s fine ...” MA Xiong said with a frown.

“Let’s go and take a look!” Xia ruofei quickly said.

“Let’s go!”

MA Xiong and Xia ruofei also ran out of the private room and chased after Guo Hongjiang.

Guo Hongjiang’s concern for the “star of Hong Kong” was beyond Xia ruofei’s imagination. He ran as fast as he could. When a staff member came to greet him, he waved his hand and said,””Don’t mind me! Go and prepare the first aid!”

The tournament’s organizing committee also urgently stopped the preparations for the next match. The medical team was urgently dispatched, and staff members dressed in all kinds of clothes rushed into the arena.

Guo Hongjiang was indeed anxious. Xia ruofei and MA Xiong had only been in the room for a short while. They did not manage to catch up with him, and he had run away quickly.

Of course, Xia ruofei was worried that MA Xiong would not be able to handle it, so he had been taking care of MA Xiong’s speed. Otherwise, even ten Guo Hongjiang would not be able to outrun Xia ruofei.

The two of them were stopped by the staff on the sidelines.

Guo Hongjiang was the horse owner of the “star of Hong Kong,” and he was also the chairman of the horse racing Association. Naturally, he could get in without any trouble.

Although MA Xiong was also a member of the horse racing club, he only came here a few times a year. In addition, the venue was so busy that it was normal for the staff to not recognize him.

MA Xiong looked at Xia ruofei helplessly and said,””Xia Sheng, let’s just wait here ...”

Xia ruofei asked,”Mr. MA, how’s the rider?” I want to go in and see if I can help ...”

The danger of a speed race was even greater than that of an F1 race.

This was because the maximum speed of a participating horse race could reach up to more than 60 kilometers per hour. A purebred horse weighing 500 kilograms at its maximum speed could achieve a maximum kinetic energy of 89000 Joules in an instant. The impact and destructive power of this momentum were equivalent to the power of 20 m2 armor – piercing bullets!

Therefore, once there was a collision, casualties were not uncommon.

MA Xiong understood Xia ruofei’s medical skills. He hesitated for a while before saying,””Let’s wait! Xia Sheng, actually, this kind of thing depends on the rider’s luck. If they’re unlucky, they’ll basically ...”

“Understood ...” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”then let’s not cause any more trouble. We’ll wait here and see what happens!”

“Alright!” MA Xiong looked at the scene worriedly and nodded.

The two of them did not wait for long. Guo Hongjiang probably realized that he had left MA Xiong and Xia ruofei alone. Hence, after about five to six minutes, Xia ruofei and Xia ruofei saw a staff member rushing over.
