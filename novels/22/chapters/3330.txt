Translator: 5496903Just as the primary – Level Mirage beast flew out of its hiding place and pounced on Xia ruofei, Xia ruofei immediately felt the environment around him start to change.

The water in the stream turned into a shocking pool of blood, and huge hailstones began to fall from the sky. The mountains and rivers next to it became distorted, and the originally peaceful environment was filled with sand and stones, as if the end of the world had come.

Xia ruofei was mentally prepared. He was not affected by the change in environment. He closed his eyes and followed the planned route. He took three steps to the right, then five steps back, and then four steps to the right ...

In the Mirage beast’s field of vision, Xia ruofei had also disappeared mysteriously. The Mirage beast had already entered the edge of the array while Xia ruofei had hidden in the depths of the array. Under the effect of the array, it naturally lost its target.

In fact, Xia ruofei even had the time to feel the power of the Mirage beast’s illusion.

Compared to the illusion of the middle – Level Mirage beast, it was obvious that it was better.

The mid – level Mirage beast could set up an illusion in an instant. It gave Xia ruofei the feeling that in the blink of an eye, his surroundings had changed.

The illusion of the primary Mirage beast still retained a lot of the characteristics of the original environment. For example, the stream still existed, and the surrounding geographical features were only changed on the basis of the original environment.

Of course, this looked very scary. If one was not mentally prepared and had never encountered a Mirage beast before, it was inevitable that one would be flustered when they suddenly fell into an illusion.

Xia ruofei had already fought with a middle – Level Mirage beast, so he was fully prepared for the illusion created by a low – Level Mirage beast. In comparison, he felt that the illusion created by a low – Level Mirage beast was not as realistic.

After the initial stage Shen beast stepped into the array, the trap array’s effect was immediately activated. Not only did it lose its target, Xia ruofei, but it also fell into the fog. No matter if it was moving forward or backward, it was surrounded by white fog.

The qushuang flying sword and the blue immortal sword had also lost their target. The tips of the swords trembled slightly as they hovered in the place where the Mirage beast had been hiding.

Although the trapping effect of the trap & kill array was similar to that of an illusion array, the basic principles were very different. Therefore, after the primary Mirage beast fell into the array, it completely lost its direction and began to charge left and right in the array. It looked ferocious, but in fact, it was falling deeper and deeper.

Although Xia ruofei could no longer control the qushuang flying sword and the blue immortal sword to attack the Mirage beast, the attack attributes of the trap & kill array itself were very strong, even more powerful than the attacks of the flying sword.

Although Xia ruofei was still trapped in the illusion created by the Mirage beast, he could still use the array to attack the elementary – Level Mirage beast.

It was the same black light that had been used against star beasts.

Xia ruofei was already hiding in the safest place in the formation. After trying to find the Mirage beast’s trail to no avail, he decisively made a hand seal and activated the formation to launch an indiscriminate attack without caring about the cost.

Streaks of black light appeared in every corner of the formation like a torrential rain, wreaking havoc on the entire formation.

The Mirage beast’s vision was blocked in the array, and the indiscriminate attack of the black light almost covered the entire corner. Even if it found something, it was very difficult to avoid it.

Unless it was extremely lucky and happened to hide in the eye of the formation in the blind spot of the attack.

However, the probability of randomly barging in and stopping at the eye of the array was not much higher than winning the lottery.

This primary Mirage beast obviously did not have such heaven – defying luck, and its strength was indeed a little weak. In the face of the overwhelming attack of the black light, it had almost no ability to resist.

In the blink of an eye, more than a dozen black rays pierced through the body of the elementary – Level Mirage beast from all angles.

The elementary – Level Mirage beast screamed. Not only did the dozen holes on its body that were pierced by the black light start to bleed, but a large amount of blood also spurted out of its mouth, nose, ears, and other places.

Without any suspense, the elementary Mirage beast fell to the ground and stopped breathing after a moment. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The illusion in front of Xia ruofei quickly faded, and the surroundings returned to the familiar environment.

With a wave of his hand, he recalled the qushuang flying sword and the blue immortal sword. Then, he walked to the place where the primary Mirage beast died and squatted down in front of its body to observe it.

The appearance of this low – Level Mirage beast looked basically the same as that of a middle – Level Mirage beast. If one did not look carefully, they would not be able to tell the difference.

However, Xia ruofei had just studied the corpses of the intermediate – Level Mirage beasts. After comparing the two, he found a difference between the two. There was a tuft of hair with a cloud pattern between the eyes of both Mirage beasts. The Mirage beasts were basically snow – White, so this tuft of cloud – like hair was particularly obvious. However, the hair of the low – Level Mirage beast was black, while the hair of the middle – Level Mirage beast was yellow.

Xia ruofei studied it briefly and tried to keep the Mirage beast’s corpse into the space. As expected, he couldn’t put it in.

Then, Xia ruofei got up and checked the surroundings again. After making sure that there were no other Mirage beasts, he recalled the trap & kill array while thinking.

Clearly, the trap and kill array was still useful against the Mirage beast, and it was very efficient.

He just didn’t know if it would be as useful when he encountered a middle – Level Mirage beast. After all, the illusion of a middle – grade Mirage beast was more powerful and had a wider range. Xia ruofei was not confident that he could set up a trap & kill array and successfully lure the enemy into the illusion before he was pulled into it.
