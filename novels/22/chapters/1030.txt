“Everything will get better. We’re still in the entrepreneurial stage! All of you are the first generation of entrepreneurs in the pharmaceutical factory!” Xia ruofei said,”but ... You have to pay attention to the cultivation of talents, especially those with potential. Help them and let them mature as soon as possible. After recruiting new people, I hope that the old employees can have a few more backbones who can take charge!”

“Understood!” Xue Jinshan replied seriously. President Xia. ”

Then, Xia ruofei asked,”Kanayama, how’s the production at the pharmaceutical factory?” Is it difficult to supply clinical trials to various hospitals?”

Xue Jinshan chuckled.”Director Xia, at present, the two production lines are not running at full capacity. In addition to supplying the designated hospitals for clinical trials, we can also keep some stock every day!”

“Not bad, not bad!” Xia ruofei nodded in satisfaction.

“But ...” Xue Jinshan suddenly changed the topic and said,”two production lines are definitely not enough for the official production. I’ve already reported to the company, hoping to bring in two more production lines. Of course, even if we introduce a production line, there won’t be enough skilled workers, and the production capacity will definitely need to climb ...”

Xia ruofei said,”I’ve read the report on the introduction of the production line. The company should approve it soon. Let’s get the hardware facilities ready first and train the workers step by step. I believe that even if we officially start production, the market demand will also have a climbing period. It’s impossible for it to grow explosively.”

Xue Jinshan chuckled and said,”director Xia, that might not be the case ... Heart – nourishing soup is different from other medicines. Its effects are too obvious, and it’s currently the only medicine in the world that can effectively treat autism. In addition, it’s also listed as a guided drug by the Wei family planning Commission. I don’t think there’s much time left for us in the market. It’s likely that demand will exceed supply!”

Xue Jinshan paused for a moment and continued,””Even though Europe and the United States don’t recognize the effectiveness of Chinese medicine, I believe that after it becomes famous, even if they can’t buy it locally, those families with children in Europe and the United States will all come to China to buy it!”

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said,””If we have such an expectation, then we should just introduce a few more production lines. I think the factory area is big enough!”

“That’s great, of course!”Xue Jinshan happily replied. I can’t wait to get everything done in one go!”

Xia ruofei said,”then, you can do some more verification and see which production lines are suitable. Also, you can start to recruit workers on your own. Recruit more when it’s appropriate. While it’s still a trial production, quickly train the workers and let the old guide the new. This way, when the production lines are in place, there won’t be a shortage of manpower.”

“Understood!” Xue Jinshan replied.

“Kanayama, there’s one more thing I need your help with,” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Director Xia, please tell me if you have any tasks!” Xue Jinshan quickly said.

Xia ruofei didn’t answer directly. Instead, he asked,””If we stop one of our production lines for at least one or two days, at most five or six days, will it affect the supply of drugs for clinical trials?”

Xue Jinshan was stunned for a moment, then quickly made an estimation and said,”It shouldn’t be a big problem. After all, we haven’t been producing it at full capacity yet. If we stop one production line, the other production line will run at full capacity. In addition, we still have a lot of drugs in stock. We can guarantee that there will be no problem with clinical trials!”

Xia ruofei immediately replied,”very good!” Kanayama, shut down one of the production lines in the morning and organize a team to clean the production line!”

Xue Jinshan immediately realized what was going on. He quickly asked excitedly,”President Xia, could it be ... A new product?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”we can’t talk about a new product yet. We still have to see if the experiment is successful.” Kanayama, you have to keep this a secret for now. You can’t even tell boss Feng, understand?”

Xue Jinshan instantly felt his blood boiling.

He had witnessed the miracle of the heart – nourishing soup with his own eyes. He had a blind trust in Xia ruofei. Now that Xia ruofei was going to test the new product, he was full of anticipation.

“I understand! President Xia, I’ll find a few trustworthy employees to clean the production line and make sure they won’t spread the word!” Xue Jinshan said.

“Mm! Also, go and purchase a batch of medicinal herbs immediately. I’ll send you the specific list and quantity later. ” Xia ruofei said.

At this stage, the raw materials needed to produce the heart – nourishing soup were mainly purchased. Hence, Xue Jinshan was more familiar with the medicinal material suppliers. Xia ruofei simply handed this task to him.

Although there were also medicinal herbs in the spirit map space, the consumption of medicinal herbs for a mass production experiment was tens to hundreds of times that of a manual brewing. Naturally, they had to purchase other medicinal herbs.

Of course, Xia ruofei would not reveal the prescription. He would definitely add a batch of unrelated herbs to the list.

“Yes, director Xia!” Xue Jinshan replied without hesitation.

“Shut down, clean the production line, and purchase medicinal ingredients. How long will it take to complete all these?” Xia ruofei continued.

“General manager Xia, give me half a day and I’ll be able to settle everything!” Xue Jinshan said without hesitation.

“Very good! Then I’ll come to the factory in the afternoon!” Xia ruofei said.

After hanging up, Xia ruofei sent Xue Jinshan a list of medicinal herbs.

About half of the herbs were for making the jadeshi ointment. Of course, Xia ruofei did not choose the other herbs randomly. They were basically used to make the pregnancy soup and the body tempering soup. This way, they would not be wasted.
