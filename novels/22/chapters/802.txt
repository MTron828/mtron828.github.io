Chapter 803: Inspecting the territory (1)

Translator: 549690339

As soon as he entered the spirit map space, Xia ruofei felt refreshed.

The spiritual Qi in the spatial zone was extremely dense. In addition, Xia Qing had opened up a vast medicinal garden in the mountain and sea realm, and the air was filled with the unique fragrance of Chinese herbs, which made one feel relaxed and happy.

Xia Qing was busy in the herb garden. When he saw Xia ruofei enter, he immediately stopped what he was doing and greeted Xia ruofei respectfully.

Xia ruofei nodded.”Xia Qing, stop what you are doing. Follow me to the Archean realm. I have something for you to do.”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing said respectfully.

With a thought, Xia ruofei brought Xia Qing to the Archean realm where time was 30 times faster.

“Master, do you have any orders?” Xia Qing took the initiative to ask.

Xia ruofei pointed at the bags of seeds that he had sent into the medium this afternoon and said,””I’ll be using these seeds tomorrow. Soak them in the spirit Heart Flower petal water for a few days in the Archean realm. Then, dry them and pack them up according to their original arrangements.”

The flow of time in the Archean realm was 30 times slower than the outside world. Hence, even if he wanted to do it tomorrow morning, there were still more than ten days left. There was enough time.

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing said immediately.

Xia Qing was the spiritual puppet that was specially used to look at Gu lingtu’s space. His skills in planting and breeding were very comprehensive. A very basic job like soaking seeds was quite easy for Xia Qing. He didn’t need Xia ruofei to specifically tell him anything to take note of.

Next, Xia ruofei brought Xia Qing to the place where the iron – Skin Dendrobium was planted. As expected, this batch of iron – Skin Dendrobium could be picked again.

If it was in the past, Xia ruofei would have to work like a hardworking little bee and work through the night in this space to harvest the iron – Skin Dendrobium.

But now that Xia Qing was here, Xia ruofei was much more relaxed. He only needed to move his mouth.

“Xia Qing, it’s time to start harvesting the iron – Skin Dendrobium.” Xia ruofei said,”while you are soaking the seeds, you should stay in the Archean realm to complete this task.”

“Yes, master,” Xia Qing said without the slightest hesitation.

Xia Qing would always obey Xia ruofei’s orders.

“Then I’ll demonstrate the harvesting standards to you first.” Xia ruofei said.

“I understand, master,” Xia Qing said with a smile. The iron – Skin Dendrobium is a kind of medicinal plant, and the processed iron – Skin maple is also a very precious Chinese medicinal herb, so I know all the processing methods of the iron – Skin Dendrobium. ”

Xia ruofei was slightly surprised and said,””Okay, then you pick a few fresh strips and process them for me to see.”

After he finished speaking, Xia ruofei waved his hand and a military dagger that was placed on a nearby shelf flew into his hand. Xia ruofei handed the dagger to Xia Qing.

It wasn’t that Xia ruofei didn’t believe Xia Qing, but he was also very curious about the processing method of the iron – Skin Dendrobium that Xia Qing had “built in” in his mind. Would it be different from the processing methods of the workers he had seen before?

After Xia Qing took the dagger, she immediately found a nearby iron – Skin Dendrobium and skillfully cut a few fresh strips. Then, she peeled off the leaf sheath and cut the fresh strips into short sections of five to seven centimeters.

Xia Qing said,”master, this is the preliminary treatment of the Dendrobium strip. After that, we need to dry it, stir – fry it, remove the coating, and bake it. Do you want to see it?”

Xia ruofei saw that the processing process was basically the same as the workers ‘production of the iron maple bucket. He shook his head and smiled.””No need. Xia Qing, you’re only responsible for picking the fresh strips and cutting them into small pieces. I’ll let the workers outside handle the follow – up process. ”

“Understood!” Xia Qing said.

Xia Qing continued,”that’s right, master, you instructed me to use cutting to grow succulent plants. During this period of time, I’ve already grown several hundred pots. As the space at the Archean realm is limited, and you said that I only need seedlings, I’ve moved them to the mountain sea realm after they’ve grown to a certain extent. Do you want to take a look?”

“Oh, really? You’re pretty efficient!” Xia ruofei said with satisfaction,”don’t worry about the meat. We’ll talk about it tomorrow!” I’ll take a look around the Archean realm first. You can go and deal with those vegetable seeds!”

“Yes, master,” Xia Qing said,”the small flower pots you left at the Archean realm previously have all been used up. Do you think ...”

Xia ruofei said without hesitation,”I’ll go online and order it later. Before the flower pots arrive, don’t do the cutting. You have to take care of the herb garden and pick the iron – Skin dendrobes. You can’t do it alone.”

Xia Qing smiled and said,”it won’t happen. Master, have you forgotten?” I don’t need to sleep or rest. ”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment before he smiled and said,””Hahaha! It really is!”

Xia Qing’s degree of realism was so high that Xia ruofei would always unconsciously treat him as a person of flesh and blood.

In fact, Xia Qing didn’t need to sleep to replenish her energy. The amount of work she could complete alone was very large. In addition, for some work that didn’t require too much space but was more time – consuming, he could even move it to the primal realm where time flowed 30 times faster to complete it. This way, the things he could do would be even more.

Xia Qing only needed to absorb the spiritual Qi in the space to maintain its operation. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Xia ruofei also learned from Xia Qing that the spiritual Qi in the space could be regenerated. The larger the space and the more spiritual plants and pets there were, the faster the regeneration of spiritual Qi. At the same time, the spiritual Qi could also promote the growth of crops. It could be said to be a complementary and virtuous cycle.
