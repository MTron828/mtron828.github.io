Chapter 3380: Another strange path (2)

Ling Qingxue thought about it for a moment, then her eyes lit up. She couldn’t help but ask,””RUO Fei, don’t tell me that you’re already able to distinguish what land of star Fern thorn can drop soul essence?”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, then he laughed and said,'”‘My wife’s brain works very fast!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Really!” Ling Qingxue was overjoyed.”Aren’t you too amazing? I think these star Fern thorns all look the same!”

Xia ruofei was flying on his sword as he smiled and said,””I only have some ideas and discoveries, but I haven’t verified them yet. However, that star Fern thorn just now definitely doesn’t have a soul essence if I’m not mistaken, because it looks just like an ordinary star Fern thorn. There’s nothing special about it!”

“Then let’s keep looking. We ll find the star Fern thorn that you think is special. Won’t that verify your discovery?” Ling Qingxue said.

“Qingxue knows me well!” Xia ruofei gave him a thumbs up.’That’s what 1 think!”

Following that, Xia ruofei hardly made any moves. He just rode on the flying sword of the qushuang and flew across the wilderness with Ling Qingxue. When they passed by every star Fern thorn, Xia ruofei would stop and use a little time to observe it.

Most of the time, Xia ruofei would shake his head in disappointment and then continue to fly on his sword.

There were a few times when Xia ruofei’s eyes revealed a glimmer of hope. He quickly set up the formation and activated it. Then, he waited at a safe distance outside the range of the formation with Ling Qingxue.

However, the results of these few attempts were not satisfactory. The star Fern thorn was quickly burned to ashes without any suspense, but after it was burned, only ashes were left, and there was no soul essence left.

Even so, Xia ruofei’s expression remained calm.

This was because the star Fern thorn that he had stopped for a few times only matched the not – so – obvious characteristics that he had found. Xia ruofei was not sure if these characteristics were unique to the star Fern thorn that could drop soul essence. After a few rounds of verification, he could finally confirm that these characteristics were not unique but could appear in All Star Fern thorns.

The biggest difference he had noticed was the color of the roots, especially the thorns. The same roots and thorns of the same color as the star Fern’s thorns had not appeared yet, so Xia ruofei still had high hopes.

The rarer it was, the more likely it was because the drop rate of the star Fern thorn soul essence was also very low. This meant that the star Fern thorn that could produce soul essence was also very rare.

The less obvious features had been eliminated after a few rounds of verification, which made Xia ruofei more specific.

Even though Xia ruofei did not explain anything, Ling Qingxue just followed him quietly and did not ask any questions.

Anyway, no matter what Xia ruofei did, whether he stopped setting up the formation to attack the star Fern thorn or just swept past it, it would all make sense. Even after using the formation to attack for a few minutes and still finding nothing in the ashes, Ling Qingxue’s confidence in Xia ruofei had never diminished.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue continued to fly close to the ground on their flying swords, searching for the Black Star Fern thorn at the tip of the thorn.

It had to be said that this kind of star Fern thorn was indeed very rare. They had found hundreds or thousands of star Fern thorns, but so far, they had not found a single star Fern thorn with a black tip. The color of the stem was not as deep as the one that had dropped a soul essence.

Even though Xia ruofei’s flying sword was very fast, he was not slow in identifying the star Fern thorn. He could basically determine the root with just a glance. In most cases, he would just go around to the next one. Even so, he still spent half an hour and identified more than 1500 star Fern thorns. Finally, his hard work paid off. He found a star Fern thorn with a darker root and a Jet – Black tip!

Xia ruofei’s spirit was lifted!

He didn’t even have time to explain to Ling Qingxue before jumping off the qushuang flying sword with her. Then, he immediately threw out the formation materials from twenty meters away.

Xia ruofei had set up this formation more than a thousand times and was extremely familiar with it. The formation took shape almost instantly.

Originally, the star Fern thorn would not have any defensive reaction to inanimate objects like array materials. Xia ruofei’s movements were also extremely fast. Almost at the moment the array was formed, an origin crystal with more than half of its energy left had accurately embedded itself into the position of the core of the array. Immediately after, a spell was cast into the core of the array and the flame array was activated.

Even though the star Fern thrust had reacted when he had set up the array, it was already too late. It had only taken two to three seconds before the raging flames had already started burning.

At this moment, the star Fern suddenly reacted and began to frantically release its thorns.

But it was too late.

The flames within the array spread out and completely engulfed the star Fern thorn in a few breaths.

All that was left was to wait. Xia ruofei was filled with anticipation, but at the same time, he was a little nervous.

After all, this so – called characteristic was something he had concluded from a limited number of samples. Whether it was really unique to the star Fern thorn that could drop soul essence was still unknown.

If his judgment was correct, it would be fine. If he still did not get a soul essence this time, it would mean that all his previous efforts had been in vain. Next, he could only burn the star Fern thorns one by one and bet on the probability.

In order to find this star Fern thorn, he had wasted nearly an hour. Now, there were only about five hours left for the mission. No matter what, there was no possibility of completing the mission.

The formation was still very powerful, so Xia ruofei did not have to wait for too long. In about one or two minutes, the star Fern thorn in the formation had lost all signs of life. Xia ruofei waited for a little while more before the star Fern thorn was completely burnt to ashes.

Xia ruofei walked forward impatiently. He stopped the formation and put all the materials back into the spirit map space. At the same time, he waved his palm and the White ashes were blown away by the wind.

A Black Star Fern thorn soul essence was exposed before Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue’s eyes.

Ling Qingxue immediately cheered, “RUO Fei!” I’ve really found the right person this time!”

Xia ruofei’s anxious heart was finally at ease. Even though two star Fern thorn soul essences could not guarantee that his judgment was correct, the probability was very high.

He didn’t even collect the star Fern thorn soul essence. He hugged Ling Qingxue, who was beside him, and gave her a big kiss on the cheek. He said excitedly,”Qingxue! There’s hope for us to complete the mission!”

Ling Qingxue’s face reddened and she pouted.'”’Hurry up and take that star Fern thorn soul essence! We’re still short of six! We have to hurry up!”

Xia ruofei immediately came back to his senses and quickly said,””Yes, yes, yes! Your reminder is right! Time was still very tight! We have to hurry!”

Xia ruofei let go of Ling Qingxue and reached out his hand to grab the air. He then took the star Fern thorn soul essence.

When the star Fern thorn soul essence entered his palm, he saw that the mission bar in his perceptual mirror had been updated. The mission progress had become 4/10.

“Let’s go! Continue searching!” Xia ruofei said decisively.

He and Ling Qingxue jumped onto the qushuang flying sword floating at the side and flew at high speed towards another star Fern thorn not far away.

After that, it was another long search. Every time, Xia ruofei would stop the qushuang flying sword with hope. After a moment of observation, he would fly away with a disappointed expression.

After a long time, Xia ruofei finally found another star Fern thorn with distinctive features. After a round of array attacks, he obtained another star Fern thorn soul essence without any suspense.

The mission progress has been updated to 5/10.

There were only slightly more than four hours left for the mission..
