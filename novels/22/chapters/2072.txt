2073 Retreat after success (2)

However, under modern medical conditions, these problems were not impossible to overcome, including psychological obstacles. They could also be gradually recovered through effective intervention by psychologists.

It could be said that it was only a matter of time before Rousey’s legs completely returned to normal.

Everything was just as Xia ruofei had told Luo Si: safe.

When he saw the long report issued by the rehabilitation Center, Rousey’s eyes were filled with tears, and the excitement in his heart was difficult to describe.

Although he could feel that his legs were recovering at a very fast speed these days, and there were gratifying changes every day, as a person who grew up in Europe, lirossi subconsciously believed more in the intuitive data of Western medicine tests.

Now that the test report showed that his legs had recovered better than he had imagined, it was like giving him a calming pill. The big stone in his heart was finally lifted.

In response to Rossi’s current situation, the rehabilitation Center gave a very scientific recovery plan.

Now that Monica was in control of the Grasso family, she naturally had no financial difficulties, so she Simply Hired an experienced physical therapist and asked him to go to the Grasso family’s Manor every day to help Rousey with his rehabilitation training.

The equipment needed for rehabilitation training was not complicated. He could just buy a set and put it at home. In this way, Rossi did not need to run to the rehabilitation Center every day. He trained at home and regularly went to the rehabilitation Center for a comprehensive examination. Then, he would constantly adjust the training plan according to the recovery situation.

Of course, Xia ruofei had strongly suggested this.

Other than convenience, he was more concerned about safety. Although the destruction of the Gehrman family was caused by the Hong sect and had nothing to do with the Grasso family, there would still be some clues that pointed to Monica if he were to investigate.

Xia ruofei could not guarantee that the glory society would not turn their sights on the Grasso family or even Monica.

Therefore, Rousey should try to reduce the number of times he went out.

In addition, Xia ruofei had specifically instructed Lu zhengfeng to further strengthen the protection of the Grasso family. Other than ah Yong and Ah Hua, who were stationed there for a long time, there should be people secretly protecting them.

When Monica left, the Hong sect brothers who were in charge of protecting her had to be on high alert. They couldn’t afford to make any mistakes.

After arranging Rossi’s follow – up treatment, Xia ruofei left Turin in the Gulfstream G650 public jet in the afternoon local time.

Of course, before they bade each other farewell, Xia ruofei prepared a jade pendant for Monica and Rousey. He also reminded them to wear it at all times and never let it leave their bodies.

Even Lyu hai and Lyu zhengfeng had received the Jade pendants from Xia ruofei, not to mention his own woman and brother – in – Law.

Moreover, the two jade pendants were of a higher grade than lui hai ‘S. Xia ruofei chose the Jade of higher quality. There was also a mini spirit gathering array embedded in the protective array, which was mainly used to replenish the energy of the protective array.

In that case, these two pieces of jade were not disposable. According to Xia ruofei’s estimation, they could withstand at least three to four attacks from conventional firearms.

This was the only way Xia ruofei could leave Turin without worry.

Xia ruofei was still unsure about the glorious Association’s problem. However, they had not made any moves yet, so Xia ruofei could only observe.

He told lui hai to pay close attention to the movement of the glory society and to inform him at once if there was any movement.

If the glory Association really harbored ill intentions towards the Hong sect and even the Grasso family, then he would definitely nip the threat in the bud. Even if he had to start a massacre again, he would not hesitate.

This time, Xia ruofei was flying to the three mountains.

It was a private jet anyway, so the route was more flexible. The main thing was that he had already met his brothers in Beijing a few days ago. He couldn’t help them with the club’s specific matters. Besides, Song Wei had not returned to Beijing, so there was no point in him going to Beijing.

After more than ten hours of flight, the Gulfstream plane landed smoothly on the runway of the Sanshan International Airport.

When Xia ruofei took off from Turin, it was around 3 p.m. Local time. Due to the seven – hour time difference between China and Italy, it was already 8 a.m. In San Shan when the plane landed.

In fact, it was pitch black outside the porthole for most of the flight. Hence, after Xia ruofei ate something, he went to the private bedroom in the back cabin and took a nap. He only woke up when the air stewardess knocked on his door and reminded him that the plane was about to land.

During the take – off and landing phase, passengers were required to sit in their seats and fasten their seat belts. This was also for safety considerations, even private planes were no exception.

Xia ruofei washed up and returned to his seat. After about half an hour, the plane landed smoothly.

After Xia ruofei let the flight crew handle the follow – up work, he repaired himself at San Shan while he dragged a simple suitcase out of the business jet building.

Ye Lingyun, who had been notified in advance, drove Xia ruofei’s Knight XV to the airport to pick them up.

Taoyuan farm was very close to the airport. On the way, Xia ruofei briefly asked about the company’s current situation, and then the two chatted for a while. The car had already entered the farm’s Gate.

After the company’s headquarters moved to the city center, the farm was much quieter, but it also seemed more relaxed.

Of course, the expansion of the farm and the sub – Factory of the pharmaceutical factory had already started construction. Xia ruofei could see the busy construction site in the distance before he entered the door. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

It was just that it was quite a distance from here, so the farm would not be too noisy.

Xia ruofei asked ye Lingyun to send him to the small mansion.

When Blackie and the rest saw Xia ruofei who had not appeared for days, they ran up to him happily. Some licked his shoes, some tugged at his pants, and a few wagged their tails at Xia ruofei when they could not get in. They looked very intimate.

When Xia ruofei was not at home, ye Lingyun would arrange for people to prepare food for little black and the rest. He would also maintain the villa’s hygiene regularly.

Xia ruofei asked ye Lingyun to bring the luggage into the villa while he giggled and squatted down to play with little black and the rest for a while.

Ye Lingyun took his leave after putting Xia ruofei’s luggage in.

After Xia ruofei returned to the villa, he went to the master bedroom upstairs to take a shower. Then, he took out his phone and called some people close to him.

The first call was naturally to Monica. The two of them had just parted ways, so she definitely had to let her know that she was safe now that she was home.

Monica had many advantages of both Eastern and Western women. She was very loyal to Xia ruofei but not clingy, unlike some girls in China who were weak in front of their boyfriends.

The two of them exchanged a few words on the phone and said goodbye.

Then, Xia ruofei called Zhao Yongjun in the capital. He had flown to the three mountains directly from Turin and did not stop in the capital. It was reasonable to let Zhao Yongjun know.

Naturally, Xia ruofei had to inform Feng Jing.

Of course, he didn’t talk to Feng Jing for too long. He would be at the office tomorrow, so he could just report to her later. One more day wouldn’t make much of a difference.

If it was really an emergency, he would have called to report it.

Finally, Xia ruofei called Ling Qingxue.

“Hello?” Ling Qingxue’s lazy voice came from the receiver.

Xia ruofei looked at his watch and said,””Qingxue, are you still sleeping? It’s already nine in the morning, don’t you have to work today?”

Ling Qingxue said lazily,”I was working on a bidding document yesterday. I only lay down at two in the morning. I don’t feel like going to the company in the morning ... Ruofei, why are you calling me now?” It’s still early in the morning in Italy, right?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’m back!” He’s at Taoyuan farm right now!”
