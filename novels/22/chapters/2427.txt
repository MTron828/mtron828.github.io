2428 Intimidating (2)

However, everyone, including Manzila, was in Xia ruofei’s absolute control of the spirit map space. He could kill them all with a single thought.

In the face of absolute strength, even if these people had any little thoughts, they would not be able to cause any harm.

With a thought, Xia ruofei left the mobile house. The next moment, he appeared in the void.

In front of him was a small spatial cage.

As the master of the space, Xia ruofei could easily see through the membrane wall of the space cage and see the Restless Liu chengfeng.

Liu chengfeng’s cell was completely isolated from the outside. He was completely unaware of Xia ruofei’s arrival.

Liu chengfeng was very anxious.

It had been almost a day since he had been captured by that senior, and he had been left here without a care. He didn’t know what his fate would be in the next moment.

What was worse was that in this narrow space, he couldn’t feel the existence of any spiritual energy at all.

In the past, no matter where one was, even if the spiritual energy was not as rich as the inside of the sect, one could still more or less feel the existence of free spiritual energy. At midnight and dawn, cultivators could still use these four hours to cultivate.

However, he couldn’t feel a single wisp of spirit Qi within this ‘Grotto – heaven magic treasure’. He was certain that this narrow space that had confined him was that ‘senior’s Grotto – heaven magic treasure.

Cultivation was like a boat sailing against the current. If Liu chengfeng was imprisoned here for a long time, even if the “senior” didn’t kill him, his cultivation would decline greatly.

Liu chengfeng, who was burning with anxiety, suddenly felt that his vision had widened. The mountains, rivers, and seas in the distance all came into his sight. He couldn’t help but be stunned. Then, he quickly looked around and saw Xia ruofei behind him.

At this time, Xia ruofei had already recovered his original appearance and the spatial cage had sealed all his aura. Hence, Liu chengfeng did not immediately recognize that the person in front of him was the “nascent soul old monster” from last night.

But Liu chengfeng didn’t dare to be slow. He quickly knelt down and said,””Junior Liu chengfeng greets senior!”

Although Liu chengfeng did not know who this person was, he could see that he was standing in the air. Even if an Aurous core stage cultivator could fly on a sword, it would be impossible to stand in the air like this without any external help.

One had to be at least at the original infant stage to do so!

Another nascent soul old monster!

Liu chengfeng’s mind was in turmoil, and at the same time, he was filled with regret.

What kind of terrifying force had he provoked?! Since when were there so many Yuanying stage cultivators?

One must know, he had cultivated for several decades, and was even in a large sect like the falling leaves sect. Up until yesterday, he had never seen a Yuanying stage senior!

Liu chengfeng glanced around and felt that he was imprisoned in a huge cave. Although he couldn’t feel any spiritual Qi, the vitality outside couldn’t escape his eyes. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

There were mountains and seas in this immortal’s cave, and there seemed to be some mortals working in the distance. This was definitely a great force! The falling leaves sect was known as one of the five great sects, but compared to this place, it was simply a small village in the countryside!

“Liu chengfeng,” Xia ruofei said indifferently,”it’s only been a day and you don’t recognize me anymore?”

Hearing Xia ruofei’s voice, Liu chengfeng seemed to wake up from a dream. He quickly knelt down again and said,””Senior’s transformation technique is unfathomable. Please forgive this junior for not recognizing senior!”

At this moment, Liu chengfeng was even more certain of his judgment. Everything showed that the person in front of him was an original infant stage senior.

He was also feeling uneasy, not knowing how this senior would deal with him.

When he thought about how he had actually planned to snatch the origin crystal of a Yuanying stage old monster yesterday, he couldn’t help but break out in cold sweat.

This was ten thousand times more serious than touching a Tiger’s butt! It was definitely an act of seeking death.

If he encountered a nascent soul old ghost with a bad temper, he could turn him into ashes with a wave of his hand.

However, the senior in front of him didn’t seem to be so brutal. If the other party wanted to kill him, he didn’t need to go through so much trouble ...

Thinking of this, Liu chengfeng couldn’t help but feel a little lucky.

Liu chengfeng had already made up his mind. No matter what request this senior had, even if he wanted him to take him to destroy the falling leaves sect, he would agree unconditionally.

What could be more important than being alive? He had cultivated for decades, while the sect master of the falling leaves sect had cultivated for one or two hundred years. Wasn’t it all in pursuit of that illusory immortality?

Thinking of this, Liu chengfeng couldn’t help but say nervously,””Senior, please forgive me on account of my young age and ignorance ... I’m willing to be your slave and do my best to serve you!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh when he heard Liu chengfeng call him “young and ignorant.”

However, he also knew that he was now a nascent Soul Stage old monster in Liu chengfeng’s heart. In front of a nascent Soul Stage old monster, Liu chengfeng was indeed considered “young.”

“What can you do for me?” Xia ruofei asked with a faint smile.

Liu chengfeng was at a loss for words.

That’s right! The opponent was a master of the original level. Liu chengfeng did not know Xia ruofei’s exact cultivation level. It could be higher than the original level, but that was a realm that Liu chengfeng did not even dare to think about.
