Chapter 671: Chapter 473 – like a funeral (1)

“Section Chief Qi, don’t be angry, don’t be angry. Brother Xia is also young and impetuous ...” He kun quickly tried to smooth things over.

He kun then turned to Xia ruofei and said,””Brother Xia, Section Chief Qi was just joking with you! Why did you take it seriously? Come, come, come, everyone, let’s have a drink and calm down!”

Xia ruofei snorted and said,”brother he, forget it!” Respect is mutual, he’s just playing with us, why should we be polite to him!”

Qi Min’s expression was dark as he laughed coldly and said,””Director he, it seems like your little friend has a backbone!”

“This is the first time I’ve seen someone act so arrogantly when asking for help!” Lu Ping sneered.

Guo Ziyang added,”It seems that this President Xia doesn’t care about this small temple of our General administration of medicine!”

Qi Min and his two colleagues were talking and making sarcastic remarks. He kun was also very anxious. He was about to fail the task given by Secretary Tian!

He kun had originally thought that Xia ruofei was easy to get along with and that he spoke and handled matters appropriately. He did not expect that he would suddenly explode at the wine table today.

Although Qi Min and the others had indeed gone a little too far, and to put it bluntly, they were deliberately toying with and humiliating people, how could it be so easy to find someone to do things for him? If it was any other owner of a pharmaceutical factory, they wouldn’t even have the chance to ask them out for a meal!

Xue Jinshan, Bai He, and Zhou Qing were all extremely nervous, especially Bai He, who was holding a wine glass. She seemed to be at a loss.

Although they were worried that things would go wrong, they still felt a trace of warmth when the boss, Xia ruofei, stood up for his employees in time.

He kun tried to make peace with both parties, but Xia ruofei went back to his seat and said,””Little white, go back to your seat! Let’s eat something. Bureau chief he specially ordered a private kitchen in Beijing, don’t waste it!”

With that, Xia ruofei picked up a piece of pork shoulder and put it in his mouth, chewing it carefully.

......

Bai He hesitated for a moment, but she still obediently walked back to her seat.

When Qi Min and the others saw this, their faces turned even gloomier.

Qi Min even slammed the table and said sternly,””Very good! How arrogant! I’m telling you, Xia, as long as I, Qi Min, am in the National medicine Hall, your project will not be approved!”

Xia ruofei didn’t even lift his eyelids and said,””Then I’ll have to kick you out of the National Chinese Medicine Department! Don’t worry! I will fulfill your wish ...”

Qi Min was so angry that he laughed and said,”you’re really arrogant!” Kick me out of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Department? If you’re so capable, why would you need to beg your grandfather and grandmother for a Chinese medicine Project?”

“You’re a young man, chief Qi!”Guo Ziyang said. He’s definitely just too embarrassed to say such harsh words!” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“We’ve seen a lot of people who go bankrupt for the sake of laughable face ...”Lu Ping sneered.

Xia ruofei continued to eat and drink by himself, turning a blind eye to the performance of Qi Min and the other two, who were like clowns.

Since he had decided to go all out, Xia ruofei would not regret it.

He hadn’t even used his real connections yet! The approval of Chinese medicine wasn’t a difficult thing for him.

It was just that Xia ruofei didn’t want to make a big fuss in the beginning.

He kun smiled wryly at the side. There was nothing he could do to salvage the situation. He could only think about how to report this to Secretary Tian!

Qi Min stood up and said,””Bureau chief he, it seems that we can’t match up to your position! Goodbye!”

Lu Ping and Guo Ziyang also snorted coldly at the same time and stood up.

“Section Chief Qi, we’re all young people,” he kun said with a bitter smile.”We can just talk things out. Why ...”

Even he kun himself felt that his advice was weak and powerless, so Qi Min and the others naturally would not listen to it.

Qi Min coldly snorted and said,”no need!” Let’s go!”

After he finished speaking, Qi Min rudely kicked the stool, making a loud clang. Then, he took the lead and walked out of the private room.

……

At this moment, an unruly voice came from the door of the room.””I was wondering who it was! It was so noisy that we couldn’t drink in peace next door! So it was little Qi! How? Now you’re bold? You dare to put on a full – force show in the private kitchen of the Wang family?”

Qi Min’s gloomy face immediately bloomed into a respectful and flattering smile when he saw the man.

“Yo! Good day, fourth brother, good day, fourth brother!” Qi Min nodded and said,”even if you lend us a few guts, we wouldn’t dare to! Who doesn’t know that the private kitchen of the Wang Residence is fourth brother’s territory!”

Lu Ping and Guo Ziyang also quickly and respectfully greeted their fourth brother.

Xia ruofei was originally facing away from the door of the private room. When he heard the voice, he turned around and saw a young man in his late twenties, who was covered in branded goods, leaning against the door frame of the private room. He was playing with a wine glass with one hand and had a playful smile on his face.

From the tone of Qi Min and the others, this fourth brother should be the behind – the – scenes boss of the Wang family’s private kitchen.

Xia ruofei did not know who this fourth brother was, but Qi Min and the others were all very respectful and did not dare to show any neglect.

This was because although this man was only a section – Level cadre of the state press, publication, radio, Film and Television Administration, his father was Deputy Director Zeng, who was ranked second in the State Food and Drug Administration. He was a true – Blue Deputy – Level cadre and happened to be in charge of the medicine and cosmetics registration Department.
