Chapter 3395: A difficult mission (1)

Translator: 549690339

[Tower of Trials Level 6 quest: hunt and kill a goldthread nether snake.]

[Mission time: six hours]

Xia ruofei looked at the simple mission description and was a little stunned.

There was no quantity requirement. In other words, he only needed to kill one goldthread nether snake to complete the mission?

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei did not feel relieved. Instead, he felt even more stressed.

The mission had a time limit of six hours. If they couldn’t complete the mission within this time, the result was obvious. They would be directly sent out of the Tower of Trials and would never have the chance to enter the higher levels of the training space.

There was no quantity requirement, which meant that the mission was very difficult.

They only needed to kill one goldthread nether snake in six hours. If it was easy, it wouldn’t have been a mission for the trial tower’s sixth floor.

“RUO Fei, what’s wrong?” Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but ask when Xia ruofei suddenly stopped talking.

“I’ve already received the trial Pagoda’s sixth level mission. It’ll probably be more troublesome,”Xia ruofei said in a deep voice.

Then, Xia ruofei explained the mission to Ling Qingxue and said,””I’m afraid this goldthread nether snake won’t be easy to deal with. We need to be mentally prepared.”

Ling Qingxue nodded and said,”definitely!” RUO Fei, the time for the mission has started! We don’t have time to think too much. Waiting here isn’t a solution, we have to hurry!”

“En!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”Qingxue, you must follow me closely. Don’t worry, if anything happens, I will ensure your safety first!”

“I’m not as weak as you think!” Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”no matter what, my spiritual power is comparable to that of a golden core cultivator! You still have to focus on completing the mission. I still have the ability to protect myself!”

“I know!”

As soon as Xia ruofei finished speaking, he saw new words appear on the mission bar of the perceptual mirror. He quickly looked at it.

The mission notification bar said,”an adult golden thread nether snake has a Jet – Black body with three one – inch golden threads on its head. Its cultivation is comparable to a cultivator at the peak of the late golden core stage. It is extremely fast, and its scales and fangs are highly poisonous. It can spew out extremely corrosive poisonous mist. It is extremely dangerous.”

Xia ruofei told Ling Qingxue what he had seen and mumbled,””At least there are some hints this time, so we won’t have to search blindly!”

Ling Qingxue furrowed her brows and said,”this also shows that the goldthread nether snake isn’t easy to deal with!” From what we know, peak late golden core cultivators are already much more powerful than us. They’re also covered in poison and can spray out poisonous mist…”

Xia ruofei smiled freely and said,’”‘No matter what, it’s better to have information than not! Let’s go! Let’s go and meet this goldthread nether snake!”

With that, Xia ruofei held Ling Qingxuc’s hand and walked towards the edge of the cliff. The top of the mountain was about three kilometers in radius, and it was bare without any vegetation. One could see it clearly at a glance. Naturally, the goldthread nether snake could not be on the top of the mountain. Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue could only climb down to find traces of the goldthread nether snake.

The mountain peak was extremely steep, and the cliff seemed to have been cut by a knife or an axe. The section near the top of the mountain was basically 90 degrees vertical.

It was basically impossible for ordinary people to climb down from such a cliff. However, for cultivators, it was just a little troublesome, not that they were helpless.

Of course, Xia ruofei could have brought Ling Qingxue down on his flying sword.

However, it was very dangerous to fly down on the sword when the situation was unclear. Once they were attacked in the air, the space for them to Dodge and move would be limited.

Besides, Xia ruofei had always been traumatized by flying on his sword to too high a height.

Last time, Xia ruofei had only flown to the top of a tree and he already felt his heart palpitate. This mountain was not low at all. The clouds were halfway up the mountain. Naturally, Xia ruofei was not willing to use the sword Kinesis flight method.

Hence, Xia ruofei decided to use a more secure method.

He directly took out a few large rolls of climbing ropes from the spirit map space, and then used a very professional technique to skillfully connect these climbing ropes together.

Xia ruofei did some calculations. These ropes were almost a thousand meters long. Luckily, Xia ruofei had the spirit map space. Otherwise, any mountaineer or rock – climbing enthusiast would not be able to bear the weight of such long ropes. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Then, Xia ruofei took out the largest nail and easily hammered a few large nails deep into the stone ground at the edge of the cliff.

The rocks on the cliff were very hard, but Xia ruofei used his vital Qi and managed to knock the nails deep into the ground.

He threaded the rope through the fixed rings on the top of a few nails and tied a few very professional knots. Then, he reached out and pulled gently to test the strength.

After making sure that there was no problem, Xia ruofei then grabbed the rope and threw it down the cliff.

“Qingxue, I’ll go first! You’re on top of me, so don’t get too far away from me. Keep a distance of two meters!” Xia ruofei said.

“Alright!” Ling Qingxue said.

Xia ruofei lifted the rope slightly and held it in his hand. He jumped out and used his legs to support himself on the cliff. He stabilized his body..
