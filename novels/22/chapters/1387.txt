Chapter 1388: Everyone’s little sister (2)

Translator: 549690339

Lin Qiao knew how Xia ruofei and his brothers got along. She couldn’t help but smile secretly.

Song Rui said,”little Zhang, I’ll have to trouble you to make the arrangements!” We’ll be down in a while!”

“Sister Lin Qiao, we brought you gifts. Open them in your room!” He continued.

“Yes, yes, yes! It’s more important to open the gift!” Xia ruofei quickly said.

“It’s not like it’s a gift to you. Why are you so enthusiastic?”song Rui said.

Xia ruofei retorted,””I have to help my sister! What if you buy counterfeit goods to fool her?”

“What kind of person do you think I am?” Song Rui felt like he was about to explode ...

“Shut up!” Lin Qiao quickly said. Let’s ... Let’s go upstairs first, there are so many people watching!”

“Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go upstairs!” Zhao Yongjun said with a smile.

They took the elevator upstairs and entered Lin Qiao’s room together.

Then, song Rui and the others took out the gifts they had prepared. Five gifts were placed in a row on the bed.

Under everyone’s urging, Lin Qiao started to open the gift in embarrassment.

Since they went to buy the same items together, they didn’t have to buy the same ones. Some of them gave her a pearl bracelet, some gave her an LV bag, and some even gave her expensive cosmetics ...

These gifts were not too expensive for song Rui and the others, but the average price was around 20000 to 30000 Yuan, and they were all things that girls liked.

Including Zhao Yongjun’s watch, the gifts from the six of them added up to almost 200000 Yuan.

Lin Qiao looked at the exquisite and expensive gifts and hesitated. These things were too expensive for her. She had seen a rich girl in her class use the same LV bag. It was said that it cost more than 30000 Yuan.

As for cosmetics, she had just heard Chen Xi in the dormitory talk about it. That small black bottle seemed to be a limited edition Lancome cream. Just 50 milliliters were sold for more than 10000 Yuan, and it was not something that could be bought with money. There was also another box of ocean blue mystery Skin Essence. There were three small bottles, each containing only 15 milliliters, and the price was already more than 20000 Yuan. The two cosmetic products added up to almost 40000 Yuan!

A few days ago, Chen Xi was still looking forward to using this kind of face cream. What kind of experience would it be? Lin Qiao didn’t expect to receive one the next day. Not only was it a Lancome face cream, but it also had the more expensive ocean blue mystery Skin Essence ...

“Qiao’ er, these are all gifts from the rich brothers. You can just accept them!” Xia ruofei saw Lin Qiao’s hesitation and said with a smile.

“Yup! It’s just a small greeting gift!” Zhao Yongjun chimed in, then said half – jokingly,”you’ve accepted my gift. If you don’t accept theirs, these guys will be jealous ...”

Song Rui and the others also cooperated and showed a ‘bitter’ expression. Lin Qiao then said,””Then I’ll accept it ... Thank you, brothers!”

Song Rui immediately smiled and said,””That’s the way! Little sister Lin Qiao, you’re welcome!”

Liu Jian also said,”if you go to Beijing in the future, you can also come and play with us!” The capital is much more fun than Heron Island ...” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Yeah, yeah!” Xu Zixuan said,”we can go skiing in winter! Playing golf in the bright spring! Oh, and there’s also an exciting underground race ...”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”stop it!” Don’t lead my sister astray! By the way, are you guys starving? How did he still have the energy to be talkative? Qiao’ er has accepted the gift, so you guys should go downstairs and eat!”

“This is called burning bridges ...” Song Rui muttered.

“Kill the donkey when it’s done!” Liu Jian agreed.

“You’re the donkey!” Song Rui and Xu Zixuan rebuked him in unison.

Everyone burst into laughter.

However, song Rui and the others were starving, so they didn’t stay in Lin Qiao’s room for long and left one after another.

Zhao Yongjun also greeted Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao with a smile and returned to his room.

Lin Qiao looked at the bed full of gifts and was at a loss. These were worth nearly 200000 Yuan! Wouldn’t he have to worry about losing them every day after he accepted them? Besides, song Rui and the others had given him such an expensive gift because of brother ruofei. Wouldn’t brother ruofei owe a lot of favors?

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Qiao’ er, don’t feel any pressure. These guys are all my close friends, and they’re not short of money. These gifts are just a side gift.”

“But ... This is too valuable.” “It’s not safe for me to put it in the dormitory. Why don’t you ... Help me take it back to Sanshan and let my mom keep it at home?” Lin Qiao said with a conflicted expression.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh,”aren’t things bought for use?” How could it show its value by keeping it? Besides, why did you leave these things in the dormitory?”

Xia ruofei pointed at the things on the bed and said,””You can wear the watch and bracelet on a regular day! And this bag, you girls have a lot of small things on you, you need a bag too. Just eliminate the one you’re using now, and this, this ... They’re all useful!”

“But wouldn’t it be too high – Profile to use such an expensive thing?” Lin Qiao said hesitantly.

“How is this high – Profile? My, Xia ruofei ‘s, sister should enjoy these things. I didn’t think it through enough in the past. It just so happens that these guys have bought everything you need. Just kindly accept it!” Xia ruofei said.

Girls were supposed to be well – off. Lin Qiao was already in University. It was normal for her to use a better bag, wear an expensive watch, and even put on makeup. There was no need to be too low – Key.

Xia ruofei thought that it would be better for Lin Qiao to use these. At least, she would not be treated as a country girl. The boys who wanted to pursue Lin Qiao would not dare to approach her with small favors. Those who did not have any financial ability would also retreat.

Although Xia ruofei didn’t have any feelings for Lin Qiao, he treated her like a sister. He was like a father who had a daughter. Even if his daughter was going to find a boyfriend and get married, he would still feel a little awkward as a father.

It was just like how Xia ruofei would feel a little weird when he thought about Lin Qiao having a boyfriend. He wouldn’t be jealous, but he would feel a little disappointed.

Of course, Xia ruofei would not stop Lin Qiao from dating because of this. However, he could still help her to check and filter out some people.

Of course, Lin Qiao didn’t think that deeply. After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, she felt warm in her heart, but at the same time, she couldn’t help but feel a little disappointed. He had always treated her as his biological sister ...

Xia ruofei didn’t notice Lin Qiao’s disappointment and continued,””And these cosmetics ... Oh right, who gave them to you? You don’t have good eyes ...”

Lin Qiao had a good memory. She said, “It’s from brother song Rui. Brother ruofei, this set of cosmetics is the most expensive of all the gifts ...”

Xia ruofei said,”what’s the use of being expensive?” Do you need to use other cosmetics?”

Lin Qiao was stunned for a moment. Then, she smiled and said,”I really don’t need to ...”

Lin Qiao usually used a skin care product, the jaded skin cream. Every time she didn’t finish it, Xia ruofei would ask the company to send her new ones.

Her skin was already very good, and after applying a little bit of jaded skin cream every day, it became even more tender and tender, like cream. Several of her best friends in the dormitory were very envious and asked her how she maintained her skin.

However, the jaded skin cream was very expensive and Lin Qiao was relatively simple in other aspects. She didn’t want her best friend in the dormitory to think that she was showing off, so she had always been vague and used it secretly every time.

Of course, everyone didn’t think much of it and praised her for her natural beauty.

“But it’s not completely useless. You can give it to your classmates!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”don’t you have a good relationship with the girls in your dormitory? Why don’t you just take it out and let everyone share it!”
