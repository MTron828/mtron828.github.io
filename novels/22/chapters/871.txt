He Feng waited for an entire afternoon, but there was no call from Mr. Xia.

However, he Feng didn’t find it strange that Yingluo could coordinate such a small admission matter through Secretary song. She must not be a simple person. Maybe she didn’t take this kind of small matter seriously. Besides, such a capable person must be very busy.

In the evening, when it was almost time to get off work, he Feng was preparing to see how things were going. If Secretary song ended the conversation, he could send him off in time and show his face in front of the higher – ups.

At this moment, he Feng’s phone, which had been on its maximum ringtone, suddenly rang.

He sprung up from his chair and took the phone.

The screen showed an unfamiliar number from Sanshan. He Feng quickly pressed the answer button.

His tone was not as reserved as usual.”Hello!”

It was Xia ruofei. He asked,””Hello, are you Mayor he?”

When he Feng heard that the voice on the other end of the phone was so young, he couldn’t help but be stunned for a moment. However, he quickly replied, “I’m he Feng, and you are?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Nice to meet you, Mayor he. I’m Xia ruofei. Secretary song asked me to call you.”

“Mr. Xia!” He Feng quickly replied. Hello, hello! The Secretary has already given instructions for the children’s admission, and I have already informed the district Education Bureau in the afternoon!” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Xia ruofei smiled.”Sorry to trouble you, Mayor he. Thank you!”

“You’re too kind, it’s nothing!” He Feng quickly said,”Mr. Xia, I’ve spoken to the district Education Bureau. Your child ...”

“Mayor he, that’s not my child.” Xia ruofei interrupted he Feng and said,”he’s the child of one of my comrades.”

He Feng smiled awkwardly and said,””Oh ... I see! I’m sorry, Mr. Xia, but does your comrade have any special requirements for the child’s teacher? I can send you a copy of the Master Teacher Register of the bell tower’s second primary school ...”

“No need, no need!” Xia ruofei was not used to he Feng’s enthusiasm. He quickly said,”Mayor he, you just have to apply for admission as usual!”

“Okay, okay, okay. I’ll get them to arrange for your comrade’s child to be in the experimental class of the bell Tower No. 2 primary school.” He Feng said,”the experimental class is the name card of the second primary school of the bell tower. All the hard and soft conditions, including the best teachers, are inclined to the experimental class.”

“That’s great! Thank you, Mayor he!” Xia ruofei said,”then ... When do I register for the school? Do we need to prepare any materials?”

“Mr. Xia, the registration for the bell Tower No. 2 primary school has ended.” He Feng said,”but it doesn’t matter ... When are you free? bring your child’s household register and parent’s ID card. I’ll go with you to register.”

Actually, the registration was just a matter of he Feng’s words. Xia ruofei only needed to provide his name and identity number.

However, he Feng had a little trick up his sleeve. He was sure that Xia ruofei was a very important person and had a special relationship with song Qiming. Hence, he had to make use of this connection. He planned to get closer to Xia ruofei through the registration.

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment and said,”this ... Mayor he, it’s just a registration. You don’t have to come out personally, right?” You can inform the education Bureau or the school, and we will bring the required materials to register. ”

“Of course, of course,” he Feng said,”this is a task personally assigned by Secretary song, so I have to be responsible to the end!” Mr. Xia, it’s fine if you’re not free in the near future. There’s still a month or so before school starts! When you have time, call me!”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and said,””I don’t think so. In that case, do you have time tomorrow morning, Mayor he? If you’re free, let’s go and register tomorrow. ”

“No problem, no problem!” He Feng asked,”where does Mr. Xia live? I’ll get the driver to pick you up tomorrow morning!”

“No need, no need,” Xia ruofei replied,”I have my own car. District head he, shall we meet at the entrance of the second primary school tomorrow morning at 9 am?”

“Alright, alright!” He Feng said,”Mr. Xia, I’ll see you tomorrow!”

After hanging up the phone, he Feng clenched his fists excitedly, as if he had his fate firmly in his hands.

Xia ruofei’s voice sounded so young. He Feng guessed that he might be the child of some big leader. That was the only way song Qiming would pay so much attention to him and personally ask about such a small matter.

Such young people were often more useful than those leaders in important positions, because no one knew how much power they had.

He Feng felt that he was about to get lucky.

Just as he was celebrating with his fists clenched, his Secretary knocked on the door and walked in, just in time to see this scene.

He Feng frowned and the Secretary quickly apologized,””I’m sorry, Mayor he ...”

Entering the office without the permission of the leader was likely to leave an impression of rashness in the leader’s mind. Moreover, he seemed to have seen the scene of District head he losing his composure, which made the Secretary even more uneasy.

He Feng was in a good mood at the moment and didn’t bother to argue with the Secretary over such a small matter. He just asked indifferently,””What’s the matter?”
