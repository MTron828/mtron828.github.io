The next day, Xia ruofei, Song Wei, and Ling Qingxue, the three cultivators, slept in for the first time. The sun was high in the sky, and they were still asleep.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

In fact, when the three of them went to bed last night, it was already three or fouro’ clock in the morning. They had not been together for more than two months, and they were all cultivators. In terms of physical strength, they were beyond ordinary people. The degree of absurdity was naturally higher than ordinary people.

Although Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue had been together for the past two months, they could not have any intimate activities due to the environment. Not to mention the small spacecraft assembly, even in the trial Pagoda, Xia ruofei always had a faint feeling that someone was spying on him all the time. At that time, he was in a state of high tension, so naturally, he could not have any intimate actions with Ling Qingxue. Yourr f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏o(v)𝒆lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The three of them were at the age where they were the most energetic, and they had been holding back for more than two months. It was not as simple as a absence makes the heart grow fonder, it was simply like Mars crashing into earth. If Xia ruofei had not set up a high – Level sound – proof Ward in his bedroom, perhaps even Luo Qingfeng, who was in closed – door cultivation, and Li Yifu, who was trying hard to consolidate his cultivation, would have been forced to listen to the live broadcast.

In the morning, the room was very quiet, and the sound of the waves in the distance could be faintly heard. The sun shone through the floor – to – Ceiling glass window on the bed, and the three of them felt very lazy. Although they had woken up, they didn’t even want to move a finger and just wanted to lay lazily on the bed.

After receiving the purple origin crystals the day before, Luo Qingfeng had started to cultivate in seclusion. He wanted to break through to the intermediate stage of the Golden core realm in one go.

Although his cultivation was still a distance away from the intermediate stage of the Golden core realm, the absorption and transformation efficiency of a purple Yuan crystal was much higher than that of ordinary Yuan crystals. Moreover, the energy contained in it was tens or even hundreds of times that of Yuan crystals. Even if this purple Yuan crystal could not completely support him to break through to the intermediate stage of the Golden core realm, it was not far from it. In addition, after the Luo Tian formation started operating, cultivating in this building was simply blessed by the heavens, like a tiger with wings. Therefore, he didn’t want to waste a single second.

Although Li Yifu didn’t go into closed – door cultivation and only cultivated for a whole night to completely consolidate his rapidly rising cultivation, he was a shrewd man. He naturally knew that his great – uncle and two great – grandmasters had reunited after a long time and needed enough private space. Therefore, he would never be stupid enough to come out and disturb them at this time.

The three of them stayed in bed for another hour until the sun was high in the sky. Finally, Xia ruofei got up helplessly to prepare lunch under the urging of Song Wei and Ling Qingxue.

That’s right, he was going to prepare lunch right away because it was almost noon.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue didn’t stay in bed for long. In fact, it was rare for the three of them to sleep together. After Xia ruofei got up, the two of them were more or less shy, so they quickly hid under the blanket and put on their clothes. Then, they quickly went to wash up and make up.

Xia ruofei quickly prepared a sumptuous lunch. Song Wei and Ling Qingxue had also finished washing up and were watching TV in the living room.

Peach Blossom Island naturally didn’t have domestic cable TV signals, but they directly installed professional satellite reception equipment on the roof. In fact, they could receive more channels than in China, and there were no restrictions. Their English was quite good, so they quickly found an English TV station that was broadcasting a music variety talent show and watched it with great interest.

After Xia ruofei had prepared lunch, he used his spiritual power to find Li Yifu’s room and said,””Foster husband, come to my room and have lunch together!”

Although Li Yifu never disobeyed Xia ruofei’s orders, he was not stupid enough to come here and be the third wheel. Hence, he declined politely without any hesitation.”Senior granduncle, this disciple has already eaten, and now I want to continue to consolidate my cultivation …”

“Alright then! You should cultivate properly.” Xia ruofei said.

Since Li Yifu had declined to have a meal, Xia ruofei would not force him.

Hence, Xia ruofei asked Song Wei and Ling Qingxue to wash their hands and went to the dining room to eat.

The ingredients produced in the spirit map space were all top – notch without exception. In addition, Xia ruofei’s cooking skills were not bad, especially when he had specially prepared a secret recipe of ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’. It was the kind that Ling Ji’s private kitchen had a daily limited supply of. The fragrance immediately attracted Ling Qingxue and Song Wei.

Back then, Xia ruofei was the one who had provided the recipe for the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ from the Ling Ji private kitchen to Ling Xiao tian for free.

In order to prepare this dish, Xia ruofei had put in a lot of effort. Many of the ingredients were not produced in the spirit map space, but because the spirit map space was like a natural refrigerator, all the ingredients would remain in the same state as before they were put in the space, as if time had stopped. So, Xia ruofei had stored a lot of various ingredients in the spirit map space every day, and they came in handy this time.

Of course, the biggest problem was that there wasn’t enough time.

Many of the ingredients for the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup had to be prepared in advance. Some of them even needed to be stewed one or two days in advance to force out the fragrance of the ingredients.

Xia ruofei had prepared lunch at the last minute, so there was definitely not enough time.

However, with the difference in the flow of time between the Archean realm and the outside world, as well as the help of time array flags, this was no longer a problem.

Xia ruofei used his spiritual energy to control the array flags at the Archean realm to set up an area to make this Buddha Jumps Over the Wall. The time taken to complete it was even shorter than the other dishes..
