Translator: 549690339

It was a brown stallion. Xia ruofei couldn’t tell what it was, but he felt that the fully – equipped rider next to it looked very impressive.

“Xia Sheng, director Guo ‘s’ star of Hong Kong ‘is pretty good!” MA Xiong said. Look at its shiny fur, and the muscles on its chest and butt are clearly defined, especially its hind legs. It’s obviously full of strength, and its eyes are bright and full of energy. It’s indeed a good horse!”

MA Xiong might not like horse racing, but as a Hong Kong citizen, his knowledge of horse racing was far beyond Xia ruofei ‘s.

At this time, Guo Hongjiang was not modest. He smiled and said,””Mr. Xia, my horse’s hooves and legs are the standard ‘dia’ structure, which is almost the perfect horse racing structure. Look at the horse next to him, it has the ‘bow kneed’ structure. Although this little flaw will not affect the race, for a horse race where victory and defeat are on the line, this little flaw may be the difference between the champion and the last place!”

Xia ruofei looked carefully at the horse that Guo Hongjiang had mentioned. He compared it with the “star of Hong Kong” for a long time but could not see any difference in the structure of the legs and hooves.

Guo Hongjiang also knew that he was being too professional. He laughed dryly and said,””Mr. Xia, just listen to what I’m saying. In short, my ‘star of Hong Kong’ is almost perfect. In addition, I’ve hired a top team to train me, so I’ve achieved a lot of good results this year.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”it seems like I can make a small profit tonight ...”

“I don’t think you’ll lose money!” Guo Hongjiang laughed.

Then, the three of them looked at each other for a while. Xia ruofei listened to Guo Hongjiang’s comments on the competitors of “star of Hong Kong”. He felt that they either had flaws here or there. Anyway,”star of Hong Kong” seemed to be winning for sure.

It was not until the race was about to start, and the horses and the riders were all heading to the starting point of the track, that the three returned to the private room. After all, they couldn’t see clearly from downstairs, but the view from the private room was the best, and the entire track could be seen at a glance.

Although he was full of confidence, the game was about to start. Guo Hongjiang was inevitably a little nervous, which could be seen from his eyes. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After Guo Hongjiang returned to the private room, the first thing he did was to walk to the floor – to – Ceiling glass. He quickly found the location of the “star of Hong Kong” and then raised his binoculars to look at it carefully.

After a period of waiting, the match officially began.

The horses rushed forward like arrows under the control of the jockmen, leaving a cloud of dust behind them.

The cheers and whistles sounded again. Xia ruofei felt the shaking of the stands.

Although Guo Hongjiang did not lose his composure like the ordinary audience, he clenched his fists tightly and stared at the track as if he was giving the “star of Hong Kong” strength.

Guo Hongjiang was right. The “star of Hong Kong” was born with superior conditions. He was in the lead from the start. Although the lead in the horse race was usually not very big, it was still obvious to the naked eye that the “star of Hong Kong” was in first.

Just when Xia ruofei thought that the “star of Hong Kong” was going to win the competition, something unexpected happened ...
