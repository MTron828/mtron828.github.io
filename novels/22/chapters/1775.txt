Chapter 1776: A different song Wei (1)

“Leaving the day after tomorrow? Then, is it convenient for me to come over tomorrow for our joint training?”

Xia ruofei was surprised when he saw Song Wei’s reply, but he still replied quickly,””No problem! Come over for lunch! I’m free in the afternoon!”

“I’ll skip lunch. I’ll be in the laboratory in the morning and have lunch in the school canteen. I’ll be in siheyuan around oneo’ clock.” Song Wei replied.

“Okay, see you tomorrow!”

“See you tomorrow!”

After a simple exchange on WeChat, Xia ruofei put down his phone. Although he was surprised by Song Wei’s sudden change in attitude, he quickly got rid of the distracting thoughts and entered a state of cultivation.

......

The next morning, Xia ruofei went to the backyard after his cultivation. Wu Qiang had already prepared breakfast.

After Xia ruofei sat down, he picked up a deep – fried dough stick and dipped it in soy milk. He took a bite.

“Wu Qiang, is there any problem with your sister – in – Law and partner?” he asked as he chewed.

“President Xia, I called and asked them when I woke up. They have already taken the earliest bus to the provincial capital. They won’t miss the flight ...” Wu Qiang said.

Wu Qiang hesitated for a moment before he said,”President Xia, Chunyan ... Is not my partner yet! You ...”

Xia ruofei had just taken a sip of soy milk and almost spat it out.

He quickly swallowed the soy milk and laughed,””You little brat, are you shy now? She’s already willing to come to you, so isn’t this matter almost certain?”

Wu Qiang scratched his head and laughed, looking a little embarrassed.

Xia ruofei said as he ate,”the plane will reach the capital at about threeo’ clock. You can drive my car to the airport to pick them up in the afternoon. I’ll also give you some money. You can take them around the capital for a while and find a good place to pick them up in the evening. You don’t have to come back so early.”

Xia ruofei was trying to create an opportunity for Wu Qiang and at the same time, he wanted to make him look good in front of his partner.

Xia ruofei had always spared no effort in helping his own people.

“That won’t do, chief Xia!” Wu Qiang quickly replied. You’ve already helped us a lot! I’ll take the afternoon off and take the train to pick him up. Also, my sister – in – Law and the others want to get back to work as soon as possible ...”

Xia ruofei did not even raise his head.”Wu Qiang, do as I say. Don’t reject me anymore!”

“President Xia ...”

“Obey my orders!” Xia ruofei said,”I have a guest coming in the afternoon. Just take it that ... You’re making space for me!”

Wu Qiang originally wanted to decline, but after hearing Xia ruofei’s words, he swallowed his words. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

After a moment of silence, Wu Qiang said,””Alright then! Thank you, President Xia ...”

“That’s right!”Xia ruofei nodded.

After saying that, he took out a piece of tissue paper and wiped his hands. Then, he took out his wallet from his pocket and took out a stack of hundred – Yuan bills. Without even counting them, he handed them to Wu Qiang.

Xia ruofei said,”bring them to eat something good. Don’t save money for me. They’re my capable subordinates. I can’t lower my status!”

“President Xia, I have money ...”

“Take it!” Xia ruofei shoved the money into Wu Qiang’s hands and said,”buy two more sets of clothes for your sister – in – Law and partner. They’ll be going out to buy groceries in the future, so they’ll have to be more particular about their clothes. Just take it as the company’s work clothes!”

The stack of money that Xia ruofei had given him was at least two to three thousand Yuan. It was more than enough to buy a meal and two sets of ordinary clothes.

Wu Qiang’s eyes turned red. He clutched the money Xia ruofei gave him and said,”President Xia, I can’t repay your kindness. In the future ... Just watch my performance!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Alright, alright!” Why are you so emotional so early in the morning? Let’s eat, let’s eat!”

......

In the morning, Xia ruofei saw that Wu Qiang was a little out of it and could not help but find it funny. He simply gave him half a day off and let him go out for a walk.

Xia ruofei finally had a free morning. He made a pot of tea in his courtyard and laid on the recliner in a daze.

Xia ruofei had been working non – stop for the past few days. It was rare for him to empty his mind and he felt very comfortable.

A pot of fragrant tea, a reclining chair, and a quiet courtyard. Sitting in front of the courtyard and watching the flowers fall, Xia ruofei felt that his heart seemed to have become a little clearer.

After lunch, Xia ruofei sent Wu Qiang out and told him to drive the car away. As for whether he would wait at the airport or go for a spin, it was up to him.

Xia ruofei, on the other hand, took a walk in the courtyard house as if he was digesting his food.

The siheyuan was huge. Xia ruofei walked around for a few rounds before he received a call from Song Wei. She was already at the siheyuan. She was at the main entrance of liuhai Lane.

Xia ruofei had just reached the front yard. He walked over and pressed the button. The door opened slowly and he saw Song Wei standing at the door with a complicated expression.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Song Wei, welcome!” Please come in!”

Song Wei looked at Xia ruofei, the corners of her mouth curved into a beautiful arc, and her eyes seemed to have softened.

She strode into the courtyard house. As Xia ruofei closed the door, he said,””Let’s make good use of our time to cultivate! I still have some things to deal with in the evening, so I won’t be keeping you for dinner. ”

Song Wei glanced at Xia ruofei and said,””I’m not planning to freeload! You don’t have to explain it so early, do you?”
