Qingfeng Luo thought to himself,’let’s talk about this after we get to peach source Island! If he could find a few more of these spiritual crystals, it would be fine to give one to Yongshou.

With that thought in mind, Luo Qingfeng put away the spirit crystal carefully.

Zheng Yongshou had been quietly observing Luo Qingfeng’s expression. Knowing that Luo Qingfeng had put away the spirit crystal, he felt more at ease. At the same time, he admired Xia ruofei, his master, more.

Xia ruofei had specially arranged for Zheng Yongshou to fabricate news about the ancient cultivator ruins and report it to Luo Qingfeng. The purpose was to make Peach Blossom Island more attractive to Luo Qingfeng, making him eager to go. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

At the same time, not only was there a natural formation on the Paradise Island, but there were also the remains of ancient cultivators, so activating the formation was much easier. In addition, there might be more spirit crystals. With so many factors combined, it was even more impossible for Luo Qingfeng to leak the news to others according to his personality.

Of course, this move had an additional effect, which was to make Qingfeng Luo’s loyalty to Zheng Yongshou no longer have any doubts about a precious cultivation resource like the misty spiritual crystal. Even if he could not name it, he could at least sense the rich spiritual energy inside, right? He offered it to the sect without any hesitation. If such a disciple wasn’t loyal, who else could he trust?

Sure enough, Qingfeng Luo looked at Zheng Yongshou with an even more affable gaze. He said gently,””Yongshou, you’ve had a hard time on this trip! However, you can’t rest for the time being. After all, the natural formation of the Peach Blossom Island is related to the rise of the sect, so I’ve decided to go to the Peach Blossom Island today!”

Zheng Yongshou’s heart was filled with joy, and he quickly said,””Shizun, disciple didn’t work hard! To be able to serve by shizun’s side is disciple’s honor!”

Then, Zheng Yongshou pretended to be concerned and asked,””Shizun, which martial brothers do you want to bring with you on this trip? I’ll inform them to make their preparations. ”

“Let’s go,” Luo Qingfeng said seriously.”This time, we will go in secret. You can’t reveal our whereabouts to anyone!” The natural formation of the Peach Blossom Island is of great importance. Before you successfully activate the formation and control the core of the formation, any information about the Peach Blossom Island must be kept top secret. You must not leak the slightest bit of information, or else it’s very likely to attract the covetous eyes of other sects. Do you understand?”

Zheng Yongshou was overjoyed, he quickly lowered his head and said,””Yes! This disciple will remember!”

Luo Qingfeng nodded with satisfaction and said,””Okay, wait here for a while. I’ll prepare some things. We’ll leave immediately!”

It was not that Qingfeng Luo did not trust Zheng Yongshou. He was worried that Zheng Yongshou would leak the news after he left his sight. He did this because he did not want too many people to know that Zheng Yongshou had returned to the sect. Secondly, he was already very anxious. He was going to set off soon after making some preparations. It was naturally the most convenient for Zheng Yongshou to wait here.

“Yes! Master!” Zheng Yongshou replied respectfully.

Luo Qingfeng got up and took out some array flags, compasses, jade stones, and other array – setting tools from the cabinet. After some thought, he also took out a few crystals. These crystals were similar to spirit crystals and contained spirit Qi. They could be used by cultivators, but the purity of the spirit Qi was not on the same level as spirit crystals. They could barely be considered ‘low – Quality’ spirit crystals.

Luo Qingfeng waved his hand, and all these things disappeared into thin air.

He looked at the dumbstruck Zheng Yongshou and waved his hand at him, showing him the ring on his middle finger. He smiled and said,””This is a storage ring! It’s something I found by chance while exploring some ancient ruins, and it can be said to be the most precious treasure of our star Seizer sect!”

The space inside Qingfeng Luo’s storage ring was only about 10 cubic meters. Compared to Xia ruofei’s vast spirit map space, it was like comparing a homeless man sleeping under a bridge to the richest man in the world. However, in Qingfeng Luo’s eyes, it was still an extremely precious treasure.

In fact, storage rings involved the laws of space and had been passed down from ancient times. It was almost impossible to make one in the current cultivation world on earth, so there were very few of them.

Many Aurous core stage cultivators might not even have a storage ring, but Luo Qingfeng had one, which was why he had always been proud of it.

However, the space in the storage ring was not big. Usually, Qingfeng Luo would only store the most precious things in it and carry it with him. This time, he was going on a long journey and it involved activating a large array. Therefore, he had also put the array books, array flags, and other things that he usually kept in the cabinet into the storage ring. The other few crystals were prepared to be rewarded to Wang Boshan.

If it was before Zheng Yongshou took out the spirit crystals, Luo Qingfeng might be a little reluctant to give them away. Now that he had the spirit crystals, his vision had widened a lot. It was just a few crystals that contained spiritual energy. Wang Boshan had made such a great contribution this time, so it was time to reward him with some “good things”.

Zheng Yongshou’s eyes widened as he stared at Luo Qingfeng’s storage ring. He exclaimed,””I didn’t expect master to have such a treasure!”

As he spoke, he thought to himself,”This storage ring was really not bad! Hmph Hmph! The more treasures the better! It’s best to bring all of them, then they’ll all be master’s ...

Qingfeng Luo was very satisfied with Zheng Yongshou’s shocked expression. He smiled and said,””Let’s go!”

“Yes! Master!” Zheng Yongshou said respectfully.

Just as Zheng Yongshou was about to ask Qingfeng what mode of transportation he would like to choose to go to Paradise Island, Qingfeng Luo took the initiative to say,””That’s right, I heard that the Paradise Island is ten thousand miles away from here?”

“Yes!” Zheng Yongshou quickly replied. Shizun, Peach Blossom Island is located in the Southern Hemisphere, and the Four Seasons there are the opposite of ours. It’s indeed very far away, and every time I go there, I take a plane. ”

Luo Qingfeng frowned subconsciously, but the urgent desire to go to Paradise Island prevailed. He thought for a moment and said,””In that case, let’s take that ... Plane this time! We need to get to peach source Island as soon as possible!”
