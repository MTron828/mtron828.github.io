Chapter 557: I’ll give you ten feet of respect (2)

Hence, Xia ruofei decided to wait until the next morning before contacting a truck and some movers. Then, he drove to the warehouse that he had rented in the city.

After he took out the fresh iron – Skin Dendrobium strips that he had prepared in the spirit map space from the warehouse, the trucks and porters he had contacted had basically arrived.

Xia ruofei then arranged for the workers to move the fresh iron – Skin Dendrobium strips to the truck and then transport them to Taoyuan farm.

Xia ruofei drove his pickup truck and led the way. They arrived at Taoyuan farm without a hitch.

Xia ruofei’s pickup truck drove directly to the open space next to the complex. A row of mobile houses had been set up. Xia ruofei knew that this would be the place where master Luo would make the Ironhide maples in the future.

Xia ruofei jumped out of the car and master Luo also came out of the mobile house.

Xia ruofei laughed and asked,”master Luo, what do you think of the conditions here?” If there’s anything that doesn’t meet your requirements, just tell me and I’ll have them rectify it. ”

Master Luo said,”boss Xia, your farm’s execution is really amazing. It’s only been a day, and it’s basically all ready. I don’t have any more requests on my side. As long as you provide enough manpower, I can start work immediately!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”no problem!” Master Luo, how many people do you need?”

Master Luo pondered for a while and said,”it’s more troublesome in the early stages. I’ll need about ten people!” As for the follow – up treatment, you just need to leave three to five assistants to me!”

“Alright, I’ll make the arrangements immediately!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”master Luo, I’ll get someone to unload the car first!” Where do you think I should put it?”

“I’ve already cleared out the room on the left. Just move it inside!”Master Luo said quickly.

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said.

He immediately called the stevedores who came with the truck to carry down all the fresh iron – Skin Dendrobium strips he had packed, and then neatly stacked them in the room that master Luo had mentioned.

Master Luo couldn’t wait to enter the house.

Xia ruofei knew what master Luo was thinking. He stood outside the door with a smile and did not follow him in. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

After a while, Xia ruofei saw master Luo rushing out of the house in excitement. He grabbed Xia ruofei and said,””Mr. Xia, the quality of your Ironskin vessel fresh strips is too high! I ... I’ve been in this business for decades, but this is the first time I’ve seen such a perfect iron – Skin Dendrobium!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Master Luo,” he said.”My fresh noodles aren’t a disgrace to your reputation, are they?”

Master Luo laughed.”Of course, of course. Boss Xia, according to my experience, these Dendrobium candids are definitely pure wild. If they were planted in the wild, no matter how good the technique is, it would be impossible to achieve such an effect!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”master Luo, you don’t have to care about whether they are wild or not. I just want to ask you one thing. Can you help me make these top – grade Ironhide bristleworms into top – grade Ironhide maples?”

“As long as you give me enough people and make sure they listen to my orders, I’ll make the most perfect iron – clad maple bucket for you!” Master Luo said without hesitation.

Master Luo continued,”Mr. Xia, to be honest, I’ve been in this business for decades. In the early years, I’ve seen a lot of pure wild iron – Skin Dendrobium. But in terms of quality, it’s not as good as your batch!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”master Luo, I’m relieved to hear your words!” Then I’ll have to trouble you for the next period of time!”

“Don’t worry! Boss Xia!” Master Luo said,”we’ve been making iron – Skin dendrobes for most of our lives, but this is the first time we’ve encountered such good raw materials. Even if I have to risk my life, I’ll definitely help you make this batch of goods good!”

Xia ruofei said happily,”sure!” Master Luo, I’ll give you a big red packet after I’m done with the goods!”

“No need, no need!” Master Luo quickly waved his hand and said,”boss Xia, my boss has already given me subsidies for going on business trips. Besides, your food and accommodation are included. I’m purely earning those subsidies, so please don’t give me any more money ...”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Master Luo, that’s a separate matter. You’re doing this for me. I’ll definitely treat you well after it’s done!”

Master Luo could only say,”alright then!” Thank you, boss Xia ... But please send over the people you promised me as soon as possible! I think these fresh fish should have just been harvested, we can’t waste any time!”

Xia ruofei said,”sure!” Please wait a moment!”

Then, Xia ruofei turned to Lei Hu and said,””Hu Zi, get a small team of security personnel to come over and cooperate with master Luo! In addition to the safety of the entire farm, the most important task of our Security Department in the near future is to cooperate with master Luo and make the iron maple bucket!”

“Yes!” Lei Hu said seriously,”brother Xia, I’ll go and arrange it now!”

With that, Lei Hu walked out.

Xia ruofei quickly stopped Lei Hu and walked in front of him. He gently pulled on his sleeve and said,””Hu, I still have something to do, let’s go out and talk ...”

Outside the door, Xia ruofei looked at Lei Hu and asked,”Hu, how do you plan to arrange the manpower?”

“The team that Qin Xiaojun is leading is in charge of the mobile operation this week. There are no specific tasks assigned to them, so they can come over to help!” Lei Hu replied without a second thought.

“I knew you would do this!” Xia ruofei said.

Lei Hu was stunned and asked,”what’s wrong?” Brother Xia, is there a problem with my arrangement?”

Xia ruofei laughed.”Normally, there would be no problem. However, this time is different. You can’t arrange it this way!”

Xia ruofei paused and continued,””Hu, the production of the iron – Skin maples this time is not a temporary decision. Our company will have a large amount of iron – Skin Dendrobium that need to be made into maples in the future, so I invited master Luo here this time. On one hand, it’s to help us, and on the other hand, I want to send capable employees to learn the production method of the iron – Skin maples from master Luo. We hope that in the near future, we can complete the production of the iron – Skin maples on our own without having to ask others, and the quality is quite high!”

“Brother Xia, what should I do then?” Lei Hu asked, somewhat puzzled.

Xia ruofei pondered for a moment and said,”Hu Zi, how about this? you go and understand the thoughts of our brothers and Cao tieshu and the other workers. If anyone is interested in learning how to make iron – Skin maples, you can volunteer! We’ll arrange for these people to learn from master Luo. In the future, I’ll arrange for them to go to Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province and continue to study under the experienced Masters like master Luo until the day they learn!”

“Yes!” Lei Hu replied. Brother Xia, I’ll go now ...”

Xia ruofei quickly stopped Lei Hu and said,””Don’t worry! Get Xiaojun’s team over here first. If master Luo has any instructions, get them to cooperate with him! You’ll be in charge of recruiting workers and gather all the interested workers. You’ll start learning from master Luo tomorrow!”

“Alright!” Lei Hu said,”brother Xia, I’ll make the arrangements now!”

With that, Lei Hu walked out directly. Xia ruofei called out behind him,””Hu Zi, wait!”

“What else, brother Xia?” Lei Hu asked.

“Hu, tell the workers that I’ll give them a 20% bonus at the end of the month if they’re here to help with the production of the iron maples. If they decide to make Ironhide maples for the farm in the future and are willing to study in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province, I’ll double their salary!” Xia ruofei said.

“Understood!” Lei Hu smiled and said,”don’t worry, Xia gongning. The benefits you’re offering are so generous that even I’m tempted. My brothers and workers will definitely be eager to sign up!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

He waited for Qin Xiaojun to bring the security guards to the temporary mobile house, then he personally ordered Qin Xiaojun to cooperate with master Luo.

After that, Xia ruofei personally watched Qin Xiaojun and the others start to process the fresh iron – Skin Dendrobium strips under master Luo’s arrangement. Only then did he leave with a peace of mind.

As Xia Rufei walked back to his villa, he was thinking about the incident where boss Qian was scammed by the illegal fund – raising.

Boss Qian and Qian Lijun had been very kind to him this time. Xia ruofei felt that he should repay them in some way.

When people respect me one foot, I will return the favor ten feet!

So, as he walked, he took out his phone and dialed a number ...
