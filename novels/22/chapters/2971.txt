2972 Chapter 1623 – cutting off the beard (1)

This fallen leaves sect disciple had previously delivered spiritual stones to room 20 and Xia ruofei had given him a lot of rewards. This time, he came with anticipation. He didn’t expect Xia ruofei to not give him anything. He didn’t even give him an extra spiritual stone. Naturally, he was very disappointed.

Of course, a low level disciple naturally did not dare to show his dissatisfaction. He could only bow respectfully to the three people and then leave the private room.

Xia ruofei did it on purpose.

He just wanted to act like he didn’t care about this ore at all, even with a little bit of emotion. He even changed his habit of being generous. If after the auction, someone had inquired about this falling leaves sect disciple, then they would naturally notice this detail, making people think that he was in a bad mood after winning the ore.

From the looks of it, it seemed more like he wanted to trick Wu Ming, but ended up losing the rice instead of the chicken.

Of course, Xia ruofei did not know how useful it would be.

As mentioned before, the impact of Wu Ming’s harsh words had already been created. What he was doing now was merely to remedy the situation.

Qingfeng Luo and Yifu li also noticed this detail, but they didn’t dare to say or ask. They just sat carefully in the room with mixed feelings.

At this time, a new auction item was already being auctioned, and Hao Qingsong was currently introducing this item.

This was also an item that a cultivator had cut in line to enter the auction at the last minute, and it did not appear in the auction manual. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

In other words, after the auction for this treasure was completed, there would be at least two to three more items to be auctioned. If there were no other items cutting in line, then it would be the storage ring’s turn to appear.

He took out the auction manual from the spirit map space and casually flipped through it.

Because of Wu Ming’s words, Xia ruofei felt a little irritated.

Xia ruofei snorted and said,””This Wu Ming is simply a Mad Dog! He would bite anyone he caught!”

Then, Xia ruofei mumbled,”I wonder if the spirit Vulture mountain submitted any treasures for the auction ...”

Xia ruofei was just talking to himself, but the listener took it seriously. Luo Qingfeng, who was at the side, could not help but laugh and say,””Master, this old servant knows a thing or two about this ...”

Xia ruofei looked at Luo Qingfeng in surprise and asked,””Aren’t the auction items provided by the major sects all confidential? Where did you get that from? Could it be that the people of the fallen leaves sect revealed some inside information to you?”

“The relationship between the fallen leaves sect and our star Seizer sect is only average,” Luo Qingfeng said with a smile.”Why would they reveal any inside information to me?” However, the auction item offered by the spirit Vulture mountain is quite famous, so not only this old servant, but many cultivators present should know about it. Moreover, many cultivators should have come for this auction item!”

“Oh? What was going on? Tell me about it!” Xia ruofei asked.

“Yes! Master!” Luo Qingfeng said respectfully,”this time, the spirit Vulture mountain has put up a remnant of a very famous ancient book for auction. This ancient book is called the ‘true understanding of the glittering jewel’. It is a ...”

“It’s a technique to increase one’s mental energy!” Xia ruofei did not wait for Luo Qingfeng to finish and said.

Luo Qingfeng was slightly surprised and said,””So master knows!”

Of course, Xia ruofei knew about the “glittering jewel true understanding” because the complete archive of the “glittering jewel true understanding” was among the vast number of ancient books recorded in his jade talisman of inheritance.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”I only know about the ‘glittering jewel true Scripture’. I don’t know anything else. I didn’t know that the lingjue mountain had collected this cultivation technique and even put it up for auction.” Qingfeng, hurry up and tell me what’s going on. Make it short!”

In fact, Xia ruofei had already thought of Luo Qingfeng the moment he mentioned this book. He had already flipped through the auction manual from beginning to end. Although he did not read the introduction of the auction items in detail, with his current spiritual power cultivation, he would have an impression of everything he had read. Furthermore, if he remembered correctly, the glittering jewel Wonderland was scheduled to be auctioned before the storage ring. Hence, Xia ruofei had a deep impression of it.

When Xia ruofei found out that this cultivation technique was being auctioned by the spirit Vulture mountain, many thoughts flashed through his mind. Hence, he was eager to know the details.

Luo Qingfeng did not dare to delay and quickly said,””Master, the lingjue mountain has an incomplete version of the glittering jewel true understanding. This is a well – known fact in the cultivation world. About 20 years ago, the leader of the lingjue mountain, Wu Tiancheng, found this cultivation method in an ancient cultivation ruin. However, it was only the second volume, and I heard that a few pages were missing. However, this cultivation method is focused on cultivating spiritual power. Although it only has the content of the second volume, it is still very valuable for reference, especially when the second volume is used for Aurous core stage cultivation. Many Aurous core stage cultivators did not have a specialized psyche cultivation technique, so they were very tempted by this technique. It’s said that Wu Tiancheng and Ren suling’s spiritual power has been growing very fast these years because they have been studying the incomplete version of the glittering jewel Wonderland. The effect is very obvious. ”

Qingfeng Luo paused, took a breath, and then continued,””This time, the Ling Jue mountain has put up a handwritten copy of the ‘glittering jewel true understanding’ for auction, claiming that it is to expand the communication between cultivators. However, everyone knows that they must be short of spirit stones, or there is a particularly important auction item in this auction that they are determined to get, but they do not have enough spirit stones, so they have put it up for auction. In any case, a hand – written copy is almost zero cost to them. It just increases the risk of this cultivation method being spread. ”

Xia ruofei nodded as his brain worked quickly.

This wasn’t the first time he had heard of the term ‘ancient ruins’. It seemed like there were quite a number of ancient ruins on earth, including the ore that he had just obtained. Chen Xuan had also obtained it from one of the ruins. This made him very interested in the ancient cultivation ruins. What he wanted the most was naturally a treasure that could continuously upgrade the spirit map space. After all, the spirit map space was his Foundation and where his core competitiveness lay.

Of course, Xia ruofei had no time to care about this now. His top priority was to make a decision.

He also had the ‘glittering jewel truth’, and it was the complete version.

Wu Ming’s actions had really made Xia ruofei very angry. The first thought that came to his mind was to take out the glittering jewel Wonderland to cut off the chase. He did not even need to take out the entire cultivation technique. Just the first and second volumes would be enough.

This was because Luo Qingfeng had also said that there was only the second volume of the glittering jewel true understanding in the hands of the spirit Vulture mountain, and it seemed to be missing a few pages.

The second volume was only suitable for cultivators in the Aurous core stage. Because the first volume was missing and a few pages were missing from the second volume, even cultivators in the Aurous core stage could not use it for cultivation. It could only be used as a great reference when cultivating their mental power.

From this, Xia ruofei could see that the cultivation world was full of techniques like the “true glittering jewel technique — Xia ruofei did not care to practice them. His” great Dao technique “was a comprehensive technique – as long as he persisted in practicing the” great Dao technique “, his vital Qi and mental energy would increase at the same time – moreover, his mental cultivation had always been ahead of his time – hence, he naturally did not care about the” true glittering jewel technique — however, such an ancient book ..- Furthermore, it was a remnant scroll, and it was considered a treasure in the current cultivation world.

Xia ruofei also realized how precious the ancient books he had obtained from the Jade talisman of inheritance were.

As expected, anything that could be recorded in the Jade talisman of inheritance, even if it was an unremarkable cultivation technique, was actually quite valuable.

If Xia ruofei copied the first and second volumes of the glittering jewel true understanding and then cut the queue to auction it in front of the lingjue mountain, it would mean that ... The lingjue mountain’s incomplete volume would basically become a waste of paper. Even if they did not get the glittering jewel true understanding that Xia ruofei had provided, other cultivators who were interested in the incomplete volume would not be able to bid for it.

After all, people knew how to compare. If Xia ruofei had not taken out the first two volumes of the glittering jewel Wonderland, perhaps everyone would have treated the remaining volume of the Vulture mountain as a treasure. However, with the Pearl in front of them, everyone would definitely think that the value of the remaining volume of the Vulture mountain had decreased greatly. Many people might even change their minds because of this and give up on the remnant scroll of the spirit Vulture mountain.

Xia ruofei knew that if he did that, it would definitely be a heavy blow to the spirit Vulture mountain. Naturally, he would be able to vent his anger.

However, was it worth it to completely fall out with the spirit Vulture mountain for the sake of personal feelings? Xia ruofei was still considering.

He knew that he didn’t have much time, because there were still two items to be auctioned. If no other items cut the queue at the last minute, it should be the lingjue mountain’s “the glittering jewel true understanding” remnant volume that would be revealed. He had to make a decision before then, and also make time to submit the auction items to the organizer, the fallen leaves sect.

Xia ruofei’s mind raced, and he quickly made up his mind.

He knew that regardless of whether he did it or not, Ling Jue mountain had already formed grudges with him. At least, Wu Ming must have already gnashed his teeth in hatred, so there was no point in being soft – hearted.

Moreover, the meaning of his intervention was not just a dispute of personal feelings.

Since the spirit Vulture mountain was willing to auction their precious handwritten copies of ancient books, they were naturally in urgent need of a large number of spiritual stones. It was very likely that they had their eyes on one of the auction items.

This made Xia ruofei very interested in this item.

If he threw out the first and second volumes of the glittering jewel true understanding in time, not only would he be able to stop the lingjue mountain in time and prevent them from obtaining the large number of spiritual stones they had planned to obtain, he would also be able to obtain a large number of spiritual stones. Even if he didn’t consider competing for the item that the Ling Jue mountain might be interested in, it would at least be of great help to him in competing for the storage ring.

Besides, Xia ruofei hated Wu Ming to the core. Naturally, he would not mind teaching him a lesson that would leave a deep impression.

These thoughts flashed through Xia ruofei’s mind. He made a decision in the shortest time possible.

Then, he suddenly stood up and said quickly,””Two things! First, her adopted husband had to leave immediately and head straight to the airport. On the way, inform the crew to immediately apply for a temporary flight route. You will directly take the public jet paradise back to Paradise Island!”

“Ah?” Li Yifu was shocked. He couldn’t help but ask,”grand uncle – Master, what happened?”

...
