Xia ruofei and the other two were busy in the kitchen. Xia ruofei had also brought a lot of ingredients over. They were all produced in the Paradise space, and the quality was naturally first – Class. They were just right to be used for the New Year’s Eve dinner.

At noon, the three of them had a simple meal and then sat in the living room to chat for a while.

Xia ruofei asked about Lin Qiao’s studies at Egret Island University. After learning that Lin Qiao’s grades were among the best in the class and she had won the gold medal in the campus design competition, Xia ruofei was very happy and did not hesitate to praise her.

Lin Qiao was even happier to be praised by Xia ruofei than to be awarded.

After the three of them chatted for a while, they went to their respective rooms for an afternoon nap. Xuxu stayed in the house. Hu Zi’s mother had always left a guest room for Xia ruofei. Now that she knew that Xia ruofei would be coming over to spend the new year with them, she had even changed the bedsheets.

These beddings had not been used even once since they were bought. However, Hu Zi’s mother had washed them in advance, so Xia ruofei could smell the comfortable scent of the sun even as he lay on the bed.

After getting up in the afternoon, Hu Zi’s mother continued to prepare the New Year’s Eve dinner.

The people of Sanshan didn’t eat dumplings like the people in the North during the new year. However, the New Year’s Eve dinner was still very sumptuous. There were swallow meat, rice cakes, betel nuts, and so on. Although they could be bought in the supermarket outside, Hu Zi’s mother still insisted on making them by hand. Whether it was the quality of the ingredients or the taste, they were naturally better than those bought in the supermarket.

In addition to the special food, there was naturally no lack of chicken, duck, and fish meat. The duck for the family’s New Year’s Eve dinner this time was bought by Hu Zi’s mother, who had made a special trip back to her hometown in Changping County. It was difficult to buy free – range local duck nowadays.

Lin Qiao chatted with Xia ruofei in the living room. She talked about the interesting things that happened in her University campus. She couldn’t wait to share all the trivial things that happened in the dormitory with Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei did not lose his patience and listened with a smile.

He had known Lin Qiao for a long time. That was the first time he went back to the three mountains to visit his family. Lin Hu asked him to bring some local specialties to his mother and sister. After Lin Hu’s death, he treated Lin Qiao like his own sister.

As the two of them chatted, the sky outside gradually darkened, and the sound of firecrackers could be heard from time to time. Some families had already started to have their New Year’s Eve dinner.

The Chinese New Year’s Eve dinner in Sanshan was not as late as in the North. It was basically the normal dinner time, and some would even be earlier than usual.

Of course, because most areas prohibited the use of firecrackers, the sound of the firecrackers was far away from Lin Qiao’s high – end residential area, so it was naturally in the prohibited area.

At this moment, Hu’s mother walked out of the kitchen. She wiped her hands on her apron and said with a smile,””The New Year’s Eve dinner is ready! Come and help serve the dishes!”

“They’re coming!” Xia ruofei responded and then said to Lin Qiao,”Qiao’ er, go and help!”

“Alright!”

Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao walked into the kitchen together and helped Hu Zi’s mother place the sumptuous dinner that she had prepared all day on the table.

The large dining table was filled to the brim, and Hu Zi’s mother’s excellent cooking skills were fully displayed here.

“Ruofei, it’s the new year today. Let’s all have some drinks!” Hu ‘Zi’s mother smiled and said,”I’m just giving Qiao’ er a token of appreciation. You can drink more!”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei said,”Godma, 1 have some wine in my car. I’ll go down and get it!”

Hu ‘er’s mother waved her hand and said,”no need!” I’m ready!”

Then, Hu’s mother turned around and took out a bottle of wine from the cabinet.

Xia ruofei took a closer look and didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. The liquor that Hu Zi’s mother took out was the Drunken Eight Immortals liquor, but it was the kind that was sold in bulk in the supermarket.

It was obvious that she had gone out to purchase them in advance.

Although the Drunken Eight Immortals wine was famous for its cheap price and excellent quality, it was only “cheap” when compared to famous wines like Maotai Wuliangye. After all, the taste of the Drunken Eight Immortals was not inferior to these famous wines, but its price was much cheaper than the Maotai Wuliangye.

Therefore, the price was relatively cheap. In terms of price alone, drunken eight immortal was not considered cheap. To Hu Zi’s mother, this kind of expenditure was definitely a waste.

Hu ‘er’s mother even said happily,””! heard that it’s not easy to buy this wine. 1 went to the supermarket early in the morning yesterday to line up. Fortunately, I managed to grab a bottle.”

The mother and daughter did not usually drink, so naturally, there was no wine in the house. Hu Zi’s mother had gone to the supermarket to buy some at the last minute. If she wanted to buy the popular Drunken Eight Immortals wine, she would definitely have to queue up early to buy it.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile wryly. He had used the spirit map space to produce the Drunken Eight Immortals wine. The wine that he had stored was of a much higher quality than the ones sold in bulk.

However, he couldn’t reveal it now. After all, this was Hu Zi’s mother’s way of expressing her love for Xia ruofei.

Hence, Xia ruofei nodded and said,””Godmother! You’re amazing! The Drunken Eight Immortals liquor has always been in short supply, and as soon as the product is put on the shelves, it will basically be snatched up. It’s really not easy for you to get the authentic Drunken Eight Immortals liquor!”

“That’s because it’s almost the new year,” Hu Zi’s mother said with a smile.’The supermarkets have also increased their supply. Otherwise, they would have been robbed clean before it even reached me!”

“Is this wine really that popular?” Lin Qiao said. Then, she said with a thoughtful expression,”! remember this is paradise ….”
