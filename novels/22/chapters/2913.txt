2914 A stray dog (1)

A normal person would not be able to withstand the spiritual pressure of a golden core stage powerhouse.

Even though ERAD was extremely brutal and his hands were stained with blood, he could not help but tremble in fear when he faced Xia ruofei. It was as if he was facing a legendary ancient demonic god.

His upper and lower teeth involuntarily trembled, making a gurgling sound. He said in a trembling voice,””I ... I’ve heard of it ...”

Xia ruofei withdrew his spiritual force with a look of disdain. Only then did eerad feel the pressure on his body relax, as if the sun had returned to the earth. Only then did he realize that in just a few seconds, his clothes had been drenched in sweat, and he looked as if he had just been fished out of the water.

Xia ruofei pouted and said,”you dare to look down on the Chinese?” I’m telling you, you’re not even fit to carry the shoes of the Chinese!”

“Yes ... I was wrong ...” ERAD nodded repeatedly.

He had been completely crushed by Xia ruofei. At this moment, his heart was filled with fear and helplessness. He had lost the arrogance of a drug Lord’s backbone leader. The only thought in his mind was to leave this place as soon as possible. He did not want to stay for another second.

However, Xia ruofei did not say anything. He did not dare to run. He could not even move his legs.

Of course, he also knew that even if he ran, he would not be able to escape. The other party’s speed was like a ghost. Even if he were to fly a hundred meters, he would definitely not be able to outrun the other party.

Xia ruofei looked down at ERAD and asked,””Speak! Do you want to live or die? Don’t put your hopes on those garbage politicians. I can kill all of you in a minute and then leave Mexico, do you believe me?” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

On the side, Sanchez, Fernando, and the others ‘faces turned red and white. They were very embarrassed, but they did not dare to say a word.

“I believe you!” ERAD quickly said,”Sir, I want to live! I ... I don’t want to die ...”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”you want to live?” Simple! Just an apology will do ...”

“Yes, yes, yes!” ERAD hurriedly replied. I apologize! I apologize! I sincerely apologize to all the Chinese!”

Xia ruofei said impatiently,”shut up!” I haven’t even finished, why are you interrupting?”

“I’m sorry! “I’m sorry ...”ERAD was so scared that his neck shrank back, and he quickly said.

Xia ruofei glanced at ERAD and said,””In China, the most sincere apology is to kneel and kowtow. Let me count ... One, two, three ... There are 18 Chinese people here today. Kneel down here and kowtow eighteen times. With each kowtow, say ‘I’m wrong’ and I’ll let you off this time. “By the way, let me remind you again. In China, we pay attention to kowtowing loudly. You must hear the sound when you kowtow. The louder the sound, the more sincere you are! How was it? Please consider it!”

ERAD’s face alternated between red and white, and his heart was filled with humiliation.

Kneeling wasn’t just a Chinese etiquette. It was a body language used all over the world. Kneeling on both knees meant that one had completely surrendered and had thrown away all their dignity.

ERAD had walked into this courtyard in an insufferably arrogant manner, but now he had to kneel and beg for mercy in exchange for his life. This was really too difficult a choice for him.

Especially since there were more than a dozen bodyguards here, as well as Madel, the head of the kuachakuros branch, and the politicians he had brought with him.

Now, ERAD regretted bringing so many people with him, especially these politicians. They were usually very flattering in front of him and couldn’t wait to kneel and lick his boots at any time. To be precise, they would kneel and lick his money. If he knelt in front of so many Chinese people today, would these people still have any respect for him?

However, when ERAD saw the guns that had been twisted into the shape of a fried dough twist, his heart couldn’t help but tremble. How much strength did he have to do this? His own hands and feet were not as hard as a gun ...

In his mind, there was an intense struggle between the positive and negative sides. For a moment, he did not know whether to choose to bow and kneel or to decisively admit defeat.

Sanchez, Fernando, and the others were even more regretful. They felt that they had been out of their minds today to follow ERAD into this mess.

If he really saw ERAD kneel down and apologize to the Chinese, would he have a good time in the future? Maybe ERAD would turn around and send people to kill everyone who saw this scene today. People died every day in Mexico, and the brains of government officials were not harder than ordinary people.

As for Yerad’s subordinates, Madel, and those bodyguards, they were even more scared out of their wits. If Sanchez and the others were still a little worried, they were completely in despair, because Yerad would never let them live. Otherwise, what prestige would Yerad have in the organization?

This was especially so for medel. Today’s incident was completely caused by him. It was because he had his eyes on the land of Huafeng shipping that he began to operate to seize it by force. It just so happened that ERAD was on vacation in kuachakurakos these two days, so he urged ERAD to come over. He originally thought that with ERAD’s identity and fierce reputation, this group of Chinese people would instantly admit defeat and easily solve the problem. He did not expect that the development of the matter had completely deviated from their expected track, and now it was out of control.

Zhang Chao and the others were also dumbfounded. They had yet to recover from their shock.
