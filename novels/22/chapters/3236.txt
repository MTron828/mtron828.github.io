3237 Come and argue if you’re not convinced (2)

Manu shrugged his shoulders and lifted his chin at Xia ruofei with a disdainful expression.””I’m all ears!”

Looking at Mannu’s “if you’re not convinced, come and argue” look, Xia ruofei smiled lightly and said,””Do you know how long the history of Chinese medicine has been passed down? Do you know how deep and profound the theoretical system of Chinese medicine is? Of course you don’t know! Thousands of years ago, when Westerners still regarded bloodletting therapy as the standard method, China’s Traditional Chinese Medicine already had a complete theoretical system. You didn’t know what the unity of heaven and man was, yin and yang and five elements, and you didn’t understand the five elements and six qi, as well as the meridians of the human body, but you could talk big about traditional Chinese medicine. It was like a primitive man who only knew how to use simple stone tools and saw a modern plane. He would never understand the modern means of transportation. However, primitive people would worship planes as gods, but you talk big about Chinese medicine. We usually call this ignorance!”

“You ...” Mannu’s face was red with anger.

However, Xia ruofei did not give him a chance to speak. He only paused for a moment before continuing,””Isn’t it ignorance to attribute everything you don’t understand as pseudoscience? And he was treating ignorance as something interesting! Mr. Manu must be very proud of his own argument that Chinese medicine could not pass the RDA standards and enter the United States. What I want to say is United States the drug test standards in the United States are for Western medicine. Why should Chinese medicine be evaluated according to these standards? Also, why did Chinese medicine have to enter the United States market? Is this our loss or the UA’s loss?”

Then, Xia ruofei shrugged and said,””I don’t know what gave you such a ridiculous sense of superiority!”

Mannu almost died of anger to Xia ruofei. He panted and said,””You can’t change the truth even if you say all sorts of things! Cancer is a problem that can’t be overcome for a long time. If Chinese medicine can really cure cancer, you guys would have spread it all over the world! I’m sorry, but I don’t remember seeing a case of Chinese medicine successfully curing cancer in a top – tier weekly magazine! Therefore, your glib tongue is like a castle in the air, and it can’t hold its ground at all!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””You can’t argue, so you’re acting shamelessly? This is indeed very United States!”

“You didn’t answer my question directly!” Mannu felt that he had gotten back 10% of the profits, and his face also revealed a trace of pride.

In his opinion, this was an unsolvable problem.

Xia ruofei said calmly,”if you had brought up the truth earlier, I wouldn’t have wasted so much time!” Of course, I’ll tell you with the truth that Chinese medicine is much more advanced than you think!”

“Unfortunately ... Before you prove yourself, I won’t agree to let you treat my patient!” Mannu said,”Mr. Masker, I’m your private doctor. I have to be responsible for my employer. If you insist on letting Mr. Xia treat little X, then I’ll have to resign. Because I’m not sure if such an irresponsible treatment will bring about unpredictable results. For the reputation of me and the team, I must avoid such risks!”

“Xia ruofei!” Elon Musk looked at Xia ruofei.

Mannu was also a top doctor in the United States. Naturally, Elon Musk did not want him to resign and leave easily. After all, no matter how rich he was, it still required a little luck to find a reliable private doctor.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”of course I won’t use little X’s case to prove my medical skills!” However, it doesn’t seem to be too difficult to speak the truth ...”

Xia ruofei then said indifferently,””Dr. Mannu, I wonder if you know about Mr. Elonmask’s physical condition?”

“Of course!” Mannu replied proudly. I know Mr. Masker’s physical condition like the back of my hand!”

“What about the ringing in his ears recently?” Xia ruofei asked,”as far as I know, Mr. Mersk’s tinnitus is very serious, but you don’t seem to have a good solution ...”

Mannu could not help but be stunned for a moment, and then immediately said: “Mr. Masker’s tinnitus has only appeared recently, and we have been focusing on little X’s treatment plan for the past few days. Tinnitus is not life – threatening and can be treated later! This was also a method to optimize the management of medical resources! Of course, I’m afraid that your Chinese medicine doctors don’t understand this at all ...”

“Then ... Why don’t we ask Dr. Mannu to formulate a treatment plan for Mr. Masker now?” Xia ruofei smiled.”Although the tinnitus is not life – threatening for the time being, it is very painful for the patient.”

“Yes!” Elonmax could not help but nod.

There were many kinds of tinnitus. Some were high – frequency sounds similar to the chirping of cicadas, and some were low rumbling sounds. No matter what kind of sound it was, if it kept ringing in the ear for 24 hours, no one would feel good.

Especially in the dead of night, this sound became more obvious.

Therefore, tinnitus was often accompanied by insomnia, headaches, and other symptoms.

Mannu could not help but be stunned. He looked at elomask and said,””Mr. Masker, I’ve explained to you last time. At present, there is no particularly effective treatment for tinnitus, and there are many reasons for it. I think it’s because of little X’s condition and the stress you’ve been under at work. I believe that it’ll ease after some time ...”

When Xia ruofei heard this reply that was as he had expected, the smile on his face became even more brilliant. He spread his hands and said to elonmask,””Mr. Masker, do you see that? Was this the so – called rigorous Western medicine? You can only hope that the minor ringing in your ears will be cured without any medicine. ”

“You ...” Manu was so angry that he stomped his feet.”You’re changing the concept!” Difficult – to – treat illnesses exist in any era, and this is completely different from our professionalism!”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”then, I’ll tell you the truth. The illness that you think is difficult to treat is just a small problem that can be easily solved by Chinese medicine.” In fact, little X’s condition is the same. You can’t come up with a complete plan for your employer even after racking your brains, but in my opinion, it’s not that difficult!”

With that, Xia ruofei ignored Mannu and turned to look at Elon Musk, saying,””Mr. Masker, before I treat little X, I would like to solve your tinnitus. Do you mind?”

“Of course!” Elonmask quickly replied. If you’re willing to treat me, I’ll be extremely grateful!”

Elon Musk also had the intention of testing Xia ruofei’s medical skills. After all, Xia ruofei had only shown his ability in testing. In actual treatment, he had not shown his true ability.

Although tinnitus and little X’s sarcoma were two completely unrelated diseases, if Xia ruofei could really solve the problem of tinnitus easily, it would prove that he had extraordinary medical skills. After all, Mannu had said just now that in the view of Western medicine, there was no particularly good solution to this kind of nerve tinnitus.

What’s more, he had been troubled by his tinnitus these days. If it could be cured, it would be a great relief!

Xia ruofei nodded and picked up the small medical kit by his feet. After opening the kit, Xia ruofei took out a small cloth bag with a set of silver needles and unhurriedly spread it out on the coffee table.

He said,”I need to explain first. In the treatment process, I will use these very thin silver needles. This is a treatment method in Chinese medicine called acupuncture. It is not a surgery as defined by Western medicine.” Moreover, these silver needles are very thin, so you won’t feel any pain. At most, you’ll feel like you’ve been bitten by a mosquito, so there’s no need to be afraid. ” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Mannu took a look and found that the set of silver needles was indeed very thin, as thin as a cow’s hair. He knew that such needles would not cause any harm to Elon Musk, so he only pouted and did not say anything.

In fact, Mannu even felt that these silver needles, which were much thinner than the ones used for blood extraction, would not be able to penetrate human skin successfully. So, he was still holding on to the mentality of watching a show, waiting for Xia ruofei to give himself away in the next moment ...
