Chapter 3823  Reappearing the world stone (1)

  "What a familiar smell ..." The young voice exclaimed in surprise.

  Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment before he came back to his senses. He realized that it was Bai Qingqing, the world Fox, who was speaking. This little fellow had not moved for a long time. When Xia ruofei entered the spirit map space, he would occasionally check on Bai Qingqing's situation and found that she was immersed in comprehending the laws in an independent space. She was probably about to make a breakthrough. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

  This kind of special spirit beast was very different from human cultivators. The realm Fox mainly relied on the rules of space to improve its cultivation. Therefore, it did not need to cultivate normally. It only needed to constantly comprehend the rules of space. The deeper its comprehension, the stronger it would be. In addition, the lifespan of a realm Fox was far longer than that of human cultivators. Therefore, it was normal for them to spend a few years without moving from their nest. It was equivalent to a human cultivator doing a small closed - door cultivation.

  Hence, every time Xia ruofei checked, he would find that the Jie Li, Bai Qingqing, was not moving. He did not disturb it. He did not expect that it would suddenly speak today, which made Xia ruofei unable to react for a moment.

  Without waiting for Xia ruofei to reply, Bai Qingqing immediately shouted excitedly,""It's the smell of world stones! Delicious world stones ... So many, so many ..."

  Xia ruofei couldn't help but be stunned. He looked at the unopened Jade box and couldn't help but make a guess.

  In reality, Xia ruofei still carried that sensing Jade Leaf with him. However, there was no movement at this moment. Logically speaking, there shouldn't be any world stones in the vicinity.

  However, this was not absolute.

  For example, if the world stone was in this Jade box, it might be able to block the Jade Leaf's detection.

  As for why Bai Qingqing could sense it, it was because the world Fox was naturally sensitive to the world stone, far more sensitive than the Jade Leaf. Furthermore, when Xia ruofei had just broken through the layer of protective array, Bai Qingqing had sensed it, and the timing matched.

  Thinking of this, Xia ruofei couldn't help but feel excited.

  It had been a long time since he had found a world stone, and the spirit map space had not yet reached its final form.

  However, the world stone had always been something that could only be found by chance. To put it bluntly, one could only rely on luck. Xia ruofei did not have any direction to go in.

  If there were realm stones inside this Jade box, the size of this Jade box could hold quite a lot of them! Perhaps the spirit map space could be upgraded again!

  When Xia ruofei thought of this, he started to lose his calm.

  The protective array of the jade box had been broken. Xia ruofei was filled with anticipation. He opened the exquisite lock on the box and lifted the lid.

  "What a familiar smell ..." The young voice exclaimed in surprise.
