Chapter 3376: Star Fern thorn soul essence (2)

Translator: 549690339

“RUO Fei, did you find anything?” Ling Qingxue asked quickly.

Xia ruofei smiled.’T’m not sure. Let’s see how it goes.”

After saying that, he waved his hand and the White ashes below scattered, revealing a black oval bead.

Xia ruofei reached out and grabbed the Black Pearl.

Xia ruofei held the Black Pearl in his hand and immediately felt a faint energy flow. It was obvious that this was not an ordinary Pearl.

He was overjoyed and focused his attention on the mission progress bar above the perceptual mirror.

At this moment, the mission progress changed from o/io to 1/10.

The method was effective!

Xia ruofei’s face lit up and he said to Ling Qingxue,””Success! Qingxue, this is the star Fern thorn soul essence. The mission requires us to search for ten star Fern thorn soul essences. When 1 got this oval bead, the progress showed that I had already found one, and now I have nine left!”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but be speechless. After a while, she said, not knowing whether to laugh or cry,””It can actually be operated like this … Only someone like you who doesn’t play by the rules can think of this!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”who cares!” It doesn’t matter if it’s a black cat or a white cat, as long as it can catch a mouse, it’s a good cat. It’s fine as long as it can complete the mission!”

“En!” Ling Qingxue nodded her head and said,”then let’s continue! If this star Fern thorny ring can produce ten soul essences, then we don’t even need to do anything and the mission will be completed?”

Xia ruofei laughed. Continue, continue!”

He tried it out of habit and realized that the star Fern thorn soul essence still couldn’t be stored in the spirit map space. This was expected, but he didn’t mind. He put the star Fern thorn soul essence into his pocket and continued to search with Ling Qingxue.

As it turned out, the drop rate of the star Fern thorn soul essence was indeed very low. The two of them searched the entire star Fern thorn belt and finally found another one just as they were about to end their search. Their mission progress had also been refreshed to 2/10.

Although he had completed one – fifth of the task without much effort, Xia ruofei’s expression became even more serious.

The reason was simple. The production rate of the star Fern thorn soul essence was simply too low.

There were at least thousands of star Fern thorns in the ring with a diameter of one kilometer and a depth of 50 meters. However, only two star Fern thorns were burned to death and formed into soul essences.

Based on this probability, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue would need to destroy at least four times the number of star Fern thorn soul essences in order to collect the remaining eight star Fern thorn souls.

The problem was that in this wasteland, the star Fern thorn was very scattered. Often, there would only be one or two in a large area. It was impossible to use an array to burn such a large area like how they had dealt with the star Fern thorn ring.

Therefore, it was not easy to find ten star Fern thorn soul essence within the time limit of the mission.

The star Fern thorns were not just for show. They had strong offensive power and strong physical defense. Although Xia ruofei had found the star Fern thorns ‘weakness and used fire to increase the efficiency, it was more suitable for Xia ruofei to use fire to deal with a large number of star Fern thorns. If he used a fire attack formation on a single star Fern thorn and then used origin crystals to burn it, not only would it cost a lot of money, but the efficiency would also be very low.

Ten hours was far from enough.

Xia ruofei felt that there must be another way. Otherwise, no one could complete this mission.

However, it was useless to think about it here. He had to give it a try.

Ling Qingxue had obviously thought of the difficulties involved. She asked with a worried expression,””RUO Fei, do we not have enough time?”

Xia ruofei nodded.’The drop rate of this soul essence is too low. We still have more than nine hours. If we’re unlucky, we might not be able to complete the mission…”

“Yup! There are so many star Fern thorns, but only two soul essences. The probability is too low.” Ling Qingxue furrowed her brows.

“The rules can’t be changed. We can only do our best to complete them!” Xia ruofei said decisively,”let’s find the star Fern thorn first! Try it and you’ll know!”

“En!”

Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to scan the entire Ash area of the star Fern thorn ring belt to make sure that no one had escaped. Then, he took Ling Qingxue and left on the bent Frost Flying sword.

In reality, there were many star Fern thorns in this wasteland. When Xia ruofei brought Ling Qingxue over, they had to deliberately avoid certain areas to avoid being attacked by the star Fern thorns.

However, the distribution of these star Fern thorns was truly too scattered.

Even though Xia ruofei’s fire array could cover a radius of more than a kilometer, it could not cover many star Fern thorns and it consumed a lot of energy.

However, Xia ruofei had no other choice. He could only try this.

After flying on his sword for a while with Ling Qingxue, he found an area with relatively dense star Fern thorns and prepared to set up an array.

Of course, this was only slightly more concentrated in other areas. Compared to the star Fern thorn ring belt, which was completely airtight, it was still a world of difference.

Xia ruofei roughly estimated that there were only about a hundred star Fern thorns within a one – kilometer radius.

Xia ruofei carefully avoided the star Fern thorn’s attack range and spent ten minutes setting up the fire array. Then, without hesitation, he embedded an origin crystal in the core of the array and activated it with a hand seal.

The flames immediately started burning and spread inwards at an extremely fast speed, turning the area within a one – kilometer radius into a sea of fire.

Of course, the speed of consumption was also extremely fast. The energy of the origin crystals was quickly lost.

The star Fern thorns within the array’s range were the same. They began to attack the array in a frenzy, but all their efforts were in vain. They were quickly distorted under the burning of the flames, and finally turned into a pile of ashes.

Xia ruofei immediately stopped the formation and turned around. His heart was aching for the crystals that he had used up.

Without waiting for the temperature in the formation to drop, Xia ruofei told Ling Qingxue to wait at the same spot. Then, he flew into the formation on his flying sword and used his vital Qi to isolate the burning aura outside. He then started to search the area quickly.

There were only a hundred or so star Fern thorns in the entire area, so Xia ruofei quickly searched through the area.

The result was disappointing. There was no star Fern thorn soul essence at all.

Of course, in terms of probability, this was very normal. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Xia ruofei returned to Ling Qingxue’s side with a frown.

Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei’s expression and knew that the result was not good. She was smart and did not ask questions at this time. She just held Xia ruofei’s arm and said softly,””Ruofei, it’s alright. Next time, luck might be on our side!”

Xia ruofei said thoughtfully,”we can’t count on luck!” We still have to change our method, or else we’ll waste too much time and the efficiency will be too low!”

“Change the method?” Ling Qingxue asked in confusion,”attacking with fire is already the most effective method! You’ve also tried those star Fern thorns. Ordinary attacks can’t do anything to them!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I know that fire is the most effective, but this kind of wide – range fire attack is not suitable. On one hand, it consumes too much energy. On the other hand, it takes too long to set up the formation. At this speed, we might not be able to find even one more star Fern thorn soul essence even after ten hours of the mission time is used up!”

At this point, Xia ruofei mumbled to himself,””! still have to start with fire attacks and formations, but 1’11 have to change the formations! Area of effect attacks are no longer suitable!”

After finding some ideas, Xia ruofei’s mind was much more active. He said,””Qingxue! I’m going to study a new formation with the help of the time formation flag.. I’ll go into the time formation to study it and you help me!”
