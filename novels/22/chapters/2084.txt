2085 Flexible plan (2)

However, Xia ruofei couldn’t find any reason to do so. After all, it was a million – dollar item. It didn’t make any sense to just leave it there without fixing it.

Hence, Xia ruofei could only watch as the workers fixed the yacht firmly on the frame.

Liao Bo went over to check and then nodded to Qin Lan, indicating that there was no problem. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Qin Lan smiled and said to Xia ruofei,””Mr. Xia, please take a look and see if there’s any problem. If not, please sign here, and we’ll completely hand over the yacht to you!”

Xia ruofei had seen the entire process clearly, so he smiled and said,””There’s no need to look, your workers are all very professional!”

After he finished speaking, Xia ruofei took the form and pen from Qin Lan’s hands and signed his name on it. Then, he returned it to her.

Seeing this, Liao Bo called the workers to leave first.

“Thank you, Mr. Xia!” Qin Lan said with a smile.

Xia ruofei laughed.”I should be the one thanking you. I’ve caused you a lot of trouble!”

“Where? This is our job!” Qin Lan said. Then, she looked at Xia ruofei and asked,”Mr. Xia, do you have time in the afternoon?” We would like to treat you to a meal. ”

Xia ruofei looked at Qin Lan and Liao Bo, smiled and said,””Manager Qin, I’ve already made plans for lunch, so let’s skip lunch! I appreciate it. If you’re looking for me for something, you can just say it!”

Qin Lan hesitated for a moment. She had wanted to find a place with a better environment to treat Xia ruofei to a meal and then mention President Huang’s yacht during the meal. She did not expect Xia ruofei to reject her so directly.

This warehouse didn’t look like a place to talk about a business worth tens of millions! If he had known this would happen, he would have called her directly yesterday!

In fact, Xia ruofei was not trying to shirk responsibility. He had indeed asked Ling Qingxue out for lunch. It was just that he had more time now. Otherwise, he would not even have the time to pretend to be polite to Qin Lan and the rest.

In the end, Qin Lan still decided to get straight to the point. She said,””Mr. Xia, it’s like this ... Yesterday, you raised the problem of the azmu 100 Leonardo yacht’s delivery period being too long. We have also reported to the leader and actively negotiated with the manufacturer. However, the manufacturer said that the orders were very full and it would be difficult to shorten the delivery period ...”

Xia ruofei listened quietly. He knew that Qin Lan would not bring this up again for no reason. If there was no result from the negotiation, it would be meaningless for her to bring this up again after a few days! Therefore, there would definitely be a follow – up.

As expected, Qin Lan continued,”Mr. Xia, we really want to facilitate this transaction. Therefore, we have coordinated the relationship between all parties. Now, we have a flexible solution. I wonder if you are interested in it?”

“Oh? Tell me about it!” Xia ruofei smiled.

“It’s like this. More than a year ago, a customer ordered an azmu 100 Leonardo from our company. This yacht has just been manufactured recently and was shipped to China by sea. It has already completed the customs clearance.” Qin Lan said,”and this customer wants to cancel this order because of his own reasons. The model of this yacht is exactly the same as the one you took a fancy to yesterday. If you agree, we can coordinate to transfer this yacht to your name. In this way, you don’t have to wait any longer and can directly drive the yacht you like!”

Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows. He was not overjoyed by the news. Instead, he asked calmly,””Manager Qin, is this a brand new yacht?”

“Of course!” Qin Lan quickly replied,”other than going through a sea test after leaving the factory, there are no records of the yacht being used. It was also transported by an ocean – going freighter. After customs clearance, it has been docked at the dock. Our customer has not completed the delivery procedures, so naturally, he can’t have used it!”

“I see ...” Xia ruofei touched his chin and said,”this will save us time. However, as far as I know, azmu’s yachts provide personalized customization. This yacht is made according to other people’s preferences. It might not be in line with my aesthetic!”

This was the question that Qin Lan was most afraid of. She quickly said,””Mr. Xia, although azmu provides customized designs, there are only a few overall designs. The customer can choose a variety of combinations. In my opinion, the designs provided by the manufacturer are actually very beautiful ... You don’t have to be in a hurry to decide. Maybe it’s a style you like?”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”that’s fine!” Manager Qin, how about this ... Send the information about this yacht to my email. I’ll take a look when I’m free, and I’ll call you again once I make a decision. ”

“Mr. Xia, I’ve brought the rendering!” Qin Lan quickly said.

Liao Bo immediately handed her an iPad. Qin Lan opened it and showed it to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei raised his hand and looked at his watch. It was still early, so he took the iPad and swiped it left and right.

In all fairness, the yacht that CEO Huang had ordered was in line with Xia ruofei’s aesthetics. At least it was not full of bright decorations and did not give off the aura of a nouveau riche.

The interior of the yacht was minimalistic and looked refreshing. The layout of the cabin was in line with Xia ruofei’s requirements.

He flipped through the pictures without saying a word and even frowned slightly from time to time. This made Qin Lan and Liao Bo, who were at the side, nervous and unable to relax, look at him.

Xia ruofei said,”manager Qin, this style can only be said to be barely satisfactory!” There are some places that I don’t want ...”

Liao Bo’s heart sank when he heard that. He felt that there was probably no chance.

On the other hand, Qin Lan saw a glimmer of hope because Xia ruofei did not make it a dead end. On the contrary, he even picked a fault, which meant there was hope.

If Xia ruofei was not interested at all, or was disappointed with the proposal, he would not have said these words and would have rejected it directly.

This was similar to buying a second – hand house. If the person looking at the house didn’t say a word after looking at it or vaguely said something like “go back and think about it”, it was likely that there was no chance. And if the landlord started to pick all kinds of faults, it meant that he was actually tempted. He only picked faults to bargain.

Qin Lan quickly said,”Mr. Xia, after all, this was custom – made by someone else. It’s indeed very difficult to completely meet your requirements. However, if you’re satisfied with the overall situation, you can also make some changes to the details.”

Xia ruofei smiled and didn’t say anything. He just looked at the effect picture on the iPad slowly.

Qin Lan gritted her teeth and said,”Mr. Xia, if you’re willing to take over this yacht, we can negotiate with the customer and give you a discount on the price. In addition, if it doesn’t involve the overall structure of the yacht, we can try our best to modify the parts that you’re not satisfied with!”

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”I see that the internal facilities of this yacht are all standard!” The discount you mentioned yesterday for equipment selection ...”

“Of course there is!” Qin Lan said,”all the preferential conditions will remain the same. We will try to lower the price as much as possible. Is that alright?”

After she finished speaking, Qin Lan opened her eyes wide and looked at Xia ruofei expectantly.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and finally nodded.””You guys go talk to the client first! Whether I buy it or not depends on how much of a discount I can get. Also, send me a copy of the details of this yacht, including the relevant documents of the client’s purchase. ”

Buying a yacht that was worth tens of millions was not like buying vegetables. Even if Xia ruofei was not short of money, he could not be so casual. He had to carefully look through all the information and documents on the yacht and compare the price before making a decision.

“Alright!” Qin Lan immediately replied. Mr. Xia, we’ll go to the customer today to coordinate! The relevant information will be sent to you before noon!”

When Xia ruofei bought the Atlantean 34 yacht in the warehouse, he had already filled in the relevant information, including the email address. Therefore, Qin Lan did not need to ask Xia ruofei for the email address. She directly handed this matter over to Liao Bo.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”sure!” That’s all for today! I’ll be waiting for your good news!”
