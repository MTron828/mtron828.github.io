Song Qiming and the others smiled and nodded. They all thought that Xia ruofei ‘s’ Buddha Jumps Over the Wall ‘was very delicious, but they could not put their finger on how it was good.

Among the people present, only Ling Xiaotian had the most say.

Ling Xiaotian looked at Xia ruofei with a complicated expression. He cleared his throat and said,””Because the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall requires a very rich variety of ingredients, some people who don’t understand this dish think that it’s just a pot of stew. In fact, this is a big mistake! From the moment the ingredients were selected, the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup had to be meticulous. Some people say that it’s already a cooking art. ”

As Ling Xiaotian spoke, he used his chopsticks to pick up a few ingredients from his bowl and said,””It’s obvious that RUO Fei’s Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup is a dish of perfection in the selection of ingredients! Especially the abalone, which is a very high – Quality reticulated abalone. The meat is soft and tough, and the taste is excellent. The other ingredients are also top – notch!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but nod to himself. It seemed that his future father – in – Law was really a knowledgeable person!

Since the abalone had grown up in the sea of the spirit map space, it was undoubtedly the best among all the ingredients.

Ling Xiaotian continued,””The pre – processing of the ingredients is also the most important thing in the cooking process of the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’. Even the order of placing and stewing is very particular. The process of processing single shark’s fin was complicated. First, it had to be boiled, the sand had to be removed, the fat meat was covered, and then it was steamed in a steamer over a strong fire. When it was taken out, the fat meat had to be removed. Then, it was put together with the swelling of the abalone, fish belly, and fish lips, and then stewed in the prepared chicken soup to soften the taste. Of course, this is the process of processing the ingredients that I know. Perhaps ruofei has his own secret, which is why this jar of Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup is so different!”

Song Qiming and the others could not help but nod. An expert was indeed an expert. What he said made sense!

Ling Xiaotian looked at Xia ruofei, but he smiled and did not speak. It was as if he did not want to reveal the secret behind it.

Ling Xiaotian smiled and continued,””Let’s take a look at this ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’. First, let’s talk about the thick brown color of the soup. Moreover, the rich colloid of the ingredients has been boiled in the soup. After drinking the soup, everyone can even feel their lips being glued together. This means that the colloid of the ingredients has fully entered the soup.”

“There are so many delicacies from the sea and mountains, but the taste is not invasive at all. The taste within the taste is wonderful, like the twists and turns of the Wuyi Mountain. There will be a feeling of twists and turns from time to time!” The more Ling Xiaotian spoke, the more passionate he became.”Shark’s fin, abalone, chestnut, mushroom, pigeon’s egg ... The taste is rich but not greasy, soft and smooth. One mouthful of it is rich, and the taste is endless!”

“Well said!” Song Qiming smiled and said,”after Chairman Ling’s explanation, we finally realized that there are so many details in this small jar of ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’! If you can fly, you’ll be amazing!”

Before Xia ruofei could say anything humble, Song Wei smiled and said,””I also have some feelings ... This warm, non – competitive, and long – lasting Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup is like the happiness of knowing destiny without doubts. It’s as if time has turned into a taste, and it has been passed down for a hundred years!”

Xia ruofei laughed,”you guys ... You’re all praising me too much ... Especially Song Wei. She’s indeed a top student of Yanjing University! Your comments can be used as advertising lines!”

“Just use it!” Song Wei smiled. I won’t charge you any copyright fees!”

Everyone laughed again. Xia ruofei called out,””Come, come, come, eat! The Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup must be eaten while it’s hot ...”

The main dish of the banquet tonight was Xia ruofei ‘s’ Buddha Jumps Over the Wall ‘, as well as the Sanshan specialty that Ling Xiaotian had personally cooked.

Ling Xiaotian used a large amount of paradise brand vegetables to cook the dishes, and the wine he drank was naturally the specially made Drunken Eight Immortals, which Xia ruofei had added a solution from the petals of the spirit Heart Flower. He had also specially prepared two bottles of Semillon, which had been aged in the spirit map space, for the three ladies.

Therefore, the standard of tonight’s banquet was quite high.

Even song Qiming’s family, who had seen many things, ate with relish and praised the food.

The atmosphere of the dinner was quite good. Song Qiming did not put on any airs as a Secretary of the municipal Committee. He laughed and chatted with Ling Xiaotian, even asking about the business operations.

The Secretary’s concern naturally made Ling Xiaotian very happy. He knew that from this day on, as long as his company operated legally in Sanshan city, he would not have to worry about those bad people.

Everyone chatted as they ate. The dinner lasted for three hours, and everyone seemed to have forgotten that there was a large group of people sitting on pins and needles in a private room outside.

Health, Industry and Commerce, taxation, safety supervision, urban management ... The leaders of the units who participated in the joint inspection today rushed to the Ling’s private kitchen in half an hour.

Not only did the director of the health Bureau come, but the Deputy Director, Tian Feilong, also rushed over, dragging his fat body.

Guangzhi Cao didn’t attend Xia ruofei’s dinner because he had to deal with this matter. He only asked manager Lu to prepare a working meal for him.

As for Tian Mingyi and the others, manager Lu naturally would not care about their lives and would just let them go hungry.

In fact, none of these people could eat. They were all depressed.

When the directors arrived at Ling Ji’s private kitchen, Guangzhi Cao was busy cooking a big bowl of seafood noodles.

Manager Lu was going to prepare a sumptuous meal, but Guangzhi Cao turned him down. As the Secretary of the leader, he wasn’t qualified to be there. Even he wanted a bowl of noodles to eat, not to mention the official business that the Secretary had assigned to him.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
