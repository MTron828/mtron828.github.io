2512 The mysterious power of the East (3)

As soon as he returned to the club, Diego could not wait to go to the Office of the Head coach, Ruby. He proposed to let Wu Lei resume the team’s training tomorrow.

Ruby wondered if Diego had gone crazy today, or if he had drunk too much at noon and was still unconscious. How long has it been since Wu Lei’s surgery?

Diego slammed a stack of examination reports on Ruby’s table and said,””I’ll tell you responsibly that Wu’s body has fully recovered!” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“How is this possible?” Ruby said in surprise.

He did not look at the stack of reports because he knew that Diego would not joke about such things. Moreover, there was no point in faking it. Wu Lei had only been in surgery for six or seven days. If he had not recovered, he would have exposed himself during training to a top European League team. Even if it was training, the intensity of the confrontation was not small. It was impossible for Wu Lei to complete the training without the recovery of the surgical wound.

“Wu used Traditional Chinese Medicine’s rehabilitation treatment, and the effect was unexpectedly good,” said Diego. It’s a pity that the Chinese doctor isn’t willing to come forward, otherwise I would strongly recommend the club to hire him for a high salary to specialize in the recovery of sports injuries. ”

“So,” Ruby said,”there’s really nothing wrong with Wu’s body?”

“Of course! But I’m only responsible for making suggestions. It’s your coaching team’s business to adopt or not to adopt them!” Diego said. He then raised his chin and continued,”you know nothing about the mysterious Eastern forces ...”

After saying that, Diego turned around and left Ruby’s office with a tsundere look on his face. He was going to look for some Chinese medicine books to study.

……

Wu Lei did not have to wait for too long. After Diego went to Ruby’s office, the club informed Wu Lei that he could participate in the team training tomorrow.

Wu Lei was so happy that he almost jumped up. He quickly told Xia ruofei the good news.

“There’s still one last treatment session,” Xia ruofei said.”Since you’re going to participate in the training tomorrow, let’s do it tonight!”

Wu Lei now respected Xia ruofei like a god. He said without hesitation,””I’ll do as you say!”

At night, Xia ruofei went to Wu Lei’s room to give him one last treatment and had just finished the ointment. Then, he examined Wu Lei again and found that his initial estimation was very accurate. Wu Lei’s body had now fully recovered, and some of the previous internal injuries had also been cured.

“No problem!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you can go for the team’s normal training tomorrow. Don’t feel any pressure. You’re completely healthy now!”

“That’s what Dr. Diego said today!”Wu Lei grinned.

“I’m looking forward to your performance this weekend!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll be there this weekend to cheer you on!”

“I still don’t know if I can get on the list!” Wu Lei said shyly.

“Then use your performance in training to conquer the manager!” Xia ruofei said.

“En!” Wu Lei nodded his head heavily.

The next day, Wu Lei participated in the team’s normal training. Head coach Ruby specially observed him and found that Wu Lei’s body seemed to have fully recovered. Some of the big confrontations were also not vague.

After two days of training, Ruby thought about it carefully and, combined with Wu Lei’s performance in training, finally put Wu Lei on the list for the weekend home game against valekano.

Ruby and Diego did not know that the mysterious power of the East was still in effect in Wu Lei’s home debut.
