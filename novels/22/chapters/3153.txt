If he was invited by the organizer to taste the delicacies of the Paradise Club, enjoy the various services and facilities of the Paradise Club, and enjoy the beautiful scenery, Shen Heping would definitely be very happy. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

However, under such circumstances, how could he be interested in enjoying the services of the Paradise clubhouse when he was forced to leave the venue in such a humiliating way?

He shouted angrily,”Xia ruofei!” This is an unreasonable suppression and wanton insult to an expert and scholar! Our Capital University will not let this go!”

Wang Chi couldn’t help but frown slightly. On one hand, he didn’t think that Shen Pingping would use the name of Capital University; At the same time, he felt that Xia ruofei had gone too far. At least, he had overreacted.

He believed that even though the Paradise Club was a relatively powerful host, they could still use gentler methods to deal with this matter.

Just as Wang Chi was about to speak, Xia ruofei’s eyes turned cold. He looked at Shen Heping and said calmly,””Associate Professor Shen, do you really not know why I wanted to kick you off the stage? If some things were revealed, it would not look good on everyone’s face. Don’t you know what you’ve been doing with this so – called artificial intelligence?”

Xia ruofei patted the back of Song Wei’s hand and said,”Wei Wei, don’t worry, I’ll take care of this matter after it’s settled,”

“En!” Song Wei gently nodded her head and said. Then, she glanced at Shen Heping in disgust.

“What little scheme?” Shen Heping said confidently,”do you know how much effort my research group has put into this artificial intelligence project? Today, this project was at the leading level internationally! Those laughable thoughts you spoke of are just your own conjectures!”

Wang Chi raised his eyebrows discreetly. Shen Heping had bragged in front of Li Yufu and Guo Qian, who were experts in the industry. Their research group had only been in this artificial intelligence project for less than half a year, and their so – called results were very limited. They didn’t even have any obvious advantages in similar domestic projects, let alone compared with some international professional institutions that had studied artificial intelligence for many years.

This kind of bull story was easily exposed.

The premise was that one had to be professional enough and have a good understanding of the industry.

Guo Qian and Li Yufu were obviously such professionals.

As for Xia ruofei...He did not need to know all this. Furthermore, he did not target Shen Heping because of the advanced AI. Shen Heping had named the AI Xiao Wei and even blatantly used Song Wei’s image. This had already crossed his bottom line.

Everyone knew that artificial intelligence had to grow through a large number of machine learning. During this process, Xia ruofei could easily figure out how Shen Heping had trained this ‘Xiaowei’ and whether he had mixed in some private stuff.

Otherwise, Xia ruofei wouldn’t have reacted this way if it was just a waste of time.

He just didn’t want Shen Heping to continue explaining. Who knew if Shen Heping’s PowerPoint presentation would contain more embarrassing content that would make song Wei even more embarrassed?

Song Rui, who was at the side, saw that Shen Ping was pestering him and impatiently shouted,””RUO Fei, why are you wasting your breath on him? Just get someone to kick him out!”

“Don’t you dare!” Shen Heping’s eyes widened in anger.

Song Rui smiled contemptuously, turned around and shouted,””Security!”

“Director song!” Soon, the two security guards at the door pushed the door open and came in.”What can I do for you?”

“Throw him out!” Song Rui pointed at Shen Heping on the stage and said,”this guy is trying to cause trouble. Control him first and deal with him after the exchange meeting!”

“Yes!” The security guard replied.

“You dare!” Shen Heping immediately panicked.”This is simply lawless!”

The security guards did not care about Shen Heping’s identity. They only listened to their leader because he was the one who gave them their jobs.

Therefore, they naturally turned a deaf ear to Shen Heping’s words. They directly came forward and grabbed Shen Heping on both sides, dragging him out of the conference room.

How could Shen Heping’s small body bear the weight of two burly security guards? no matter how hard he struggled, he was still dragged out involuntarily.

Shen Ping shouted with all his might,”what you’re doing is illegal!” It was illegal detention! I’m going to Sue you! Teacher! Teacher! Please say something! Are we, the people of Beijing University, being bullied like this?”

Wang Chi’s expression changed slightly, and he opened his mouth to say,””President Xia ...”

“Academician Wang!” Song Rui interrupted Wang Chi.”Can we have a word in private?”

At this time, Shen Heping had already been dragged out of the conference room, and his curses were getting further and further away.

Wang Chi frowned slightly and looked at song Rui and Xia ruofei. He nodded silently and stood up.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”professors, I’m really sorry. I didn’t expect such a farce to happen.” Please take a break and have some snacks. We’ll continue the meeting when academician Wang comes back. ”

With that, Xia ruofei gestured to the staff, who immediately went to bring out the desserts and snacks that had been prepared for the tea break.

“It’s fine, it’s fine!”Guo Qian chuckled. Professor Shen was young and full of youthful vigor! President Xia, please forgive me!”
