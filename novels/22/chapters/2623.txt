2624 The Taixu xuanqing formation (2)

Moreover, although the clear sky Island and the surrounding islands basically fit the layout of the Taixu xuanqing formation, some changes still needed to be made in order to let the formation play its role.

The most important thing was that the Liu family was building an airport on blue cloud Island, and the runway also formed an important part of the formation.

It could be said that if the runway had not been built, even if Xia ruofei were to observe everything from the same observation point, he might not have been able to sense the layout of the natural formation immediately. Of course, if Xia ruofei had stayed on the island for a longer time, he would have noticed something.

After all, the main body of the natural formation had already taken shape. Any subsequent changes would only be modifications to the foundation of the natural formation so that the formation could fully display its function. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

From this angle, this great array was very likely to be the work of nature.

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be amazed.

The Taixu xuanqing formation was a very powerful comprehensive formation. Not only was its defensive ability extremely strong, but it also had a certain offensive attribute. In addition, the formation also had the effect of gathering spiritual energy. After operating for a long time, as the core Island of the formation, the concentration of spiritual energy on the green cloud Island would gradually increase, and even become a blessed land.

The most important point was that once the Taixu xuanqing formation was formed, there was even a position where a teleportation formation could be set up.

This was the legendary Space Array.

There were many requirements to set up a teleportation formation, including some special materials. With Xia ruofei’s current condition, it was a little difficult to set up a teleportation formation. However, the fact that there was a space for the teleportation formation in the formation itself was already quite unbelievable.

This was also an important reason why in the ancient cultivation world, some sects used this array as a sect – protecting great array. The Kasaya had extremely strong defensive capabilities, had offensive and spirit – gathering attributes, and could also be used to arrange a teleportation array. This almost satisfied all the needs of a sect’s great array.

When Xia ruofei thought of this, he could not help but feel excited.

At this moment, the helicopter pilot asked,””Mr. Xia, we’ve already made a round. How do we fly next?”

“Adjust the course,” Xia ruofei said calmly.”We’ll go one more round in the opposite direction and then go back!”

“Alright!”

The pilot responded, then controlled the helicopter to nimbly change direction in the air and began to fly counterclockwise around the blue cloud Island.

When he returned to the best observation point, Xia ruofei’s expression was still very calm. He did not show any signs of surprise. However, he still checked the positions of all the islands again to confirm the existence of this natural formation.

The helicopter slowly landed in the project building. Liu Kuan, Liu Qingfeng, and the others braved the strong wind caused by the propeller and waited on the tarmac on the roof.

Although they kept a safe distance, the wind brought by the helicopter’s propeller still blew Liu Qingfeng’s pitiful hair into a mess, making him look quite funny.

When Xia ruofei got off the helicopter, Liu Kuan and the others quickly came up to him.

“Mr. Xia, how do you feel after looking around?” Liu Kuan asked with a smile.

“Not bad! It’s like a paradise, and the island’s defensive measures are already very complete. ” Xia ruofei said.

His tone was very objective and did not reveal any bias.

Before they left, Grandpa Liu had told Liu Kuan to sound out Xia ruofei.

From the Liu family’s point of view, naturally, they did not want Xia ruofei to choose the option of adding cash to clear sky Island. In fact, from old master Liu’s personal point of view, he would rather Xia ruofei choose the 40% shares. Of course, in his mind, the first option was still the three billion dollar option.

However, if Xia ruofei chose Qingyun Island, old man Liu would also accept it. After all, it was his own proposal. Obviously, after weighing the three proposals, he felt that they were within his acceptable range and could show the greatest sincerity.

Old master Liu knew very well that as long as Xia ruofei chose one of the treatments, it meant that his life was saved. Even if Xia ruofei was tight – lipped and insisted that he was not 100% confident in the treatment, old master Liu’s intuition told him that as long as he paid the price, Xia ruofei would definitely have a way to make him completely recover.

As for Liu Qunfeng and the others, as long as Xia ruofei didn’t choose the 40% share, they could accept the other two options.

Liu Kuan had been on the plane with Xia ruofei for more than ten hours, and they had been visiting the island for two or three hours. However, Xia ruofei did not show any signs of accepting or rejecting the plan, which made Liu Kuan feel a little troubled.

The group left the roof and took the elevator down.

In the elevator, Liu Kuan thought for a moment, then asked,””Mr. Xia, what’s the next arrangement? We’ll listen to your orders. ”

Xia ruofei said casually,”just stay one night on the green cloud Island!” We’ll leave tomorrow morning, but I hope to stay in Australia for a day. Uncle Liu, are you okay with this?”

“No problem! No problem!” Liu Kuan quickly said,”before we left, master told us to follow your instructions.”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Then let’s do this! By the way, chief Liu, is there any problem with our accommodation on the island?”

“Of course, no problem!” Liu Qingfeng quickly replied. Mr. Xia, we’ve already made the necessary arrangements. Your flight crew has also been properly settled. In addition, we’ve prepared some wine and food for lunch. Please do come along, Mr. Xia!”

“Then I’ll accept your invitation!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Liu Qingfeng personally sent Xia ruofei and Liu Kuan to the room that had been arranged in advance for a rest, and then he ran to the dining room to follow up on the luncheon.

Xia ruofei and the rest were also resting in this building. In fact, the project department only used three floors. From the fourth floor onwards, they were all apartment – style houses. Some of them were luxuriously decorated for the purpose of entertaining important guests. Today, they were all used.

Xia ruofei took a simple shower and sat in his room to rest for a while. Liu Qingfeng personally came over to invite him to lunch.

During the banquet, Liu Qingfeng and the others naturally tried their best to curry favor with him. Xia ruofei, on the other hand, was calm and collected. He did not appear arrogant, but at the same time, he was not overly enthusiastic. He maintained a perfect distance.

Liu Kuan, who had been secretly observing the situation, naturally couldn’t see anything wrong.

After lunch, Xia ruofei declined Liu Qingfeng’s suggestion to arrange for someone to accompany him. He went back to his room and changed into casual clothes. Then, he left the building alone with a sun hat on and strolled around the island.

After Liu Kuan heard Liu Qingfeng’s report, he did not disturb Xia ruofei.

He also knew that Xia ruofei would not want anyone to follow him at this time. If it were him, he would definitely check it over and over again for such a big deal and then weigh the pros and cons.

Therefore, in Liu Kuan’s opinion, it was normal for Xia ruofei to visit the island after lunch.

An area of five or six square kilometers didn’t sound small, but in fact, the widest part of green cloud Island was only about three kilometers, and the north and south were about two kilometers. The entire area was really not too large.

He strolled leisurely along the island’s roads while releasing his spiritual power at the same time, silently memorizing the situation on the island one by one.

After walking for a while, Xia ruofei found a rock by the sea and sat down. Facing the vast sea, his thoughts gradually spread out.

Of course, he wanted the island. Therefore, he had already begun to think about how to develop and utilize the island after he obtained it, and how to ensure the island’s safety.
