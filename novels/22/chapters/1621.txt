Chapter 1622: Heart – to – Heart talk (2)

“The Bureau chief is very self – disciplined in this regard!” Manager Lu quickly said.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”in fact, it’s good for the elderly to drink in moderation. It’s good for the body. It’s to relax the channels and blood circulation!” Of course, white wine is strong, but red wine is still the most suitable for you. Drinking a small glass every day will definitely be good for your body!”

“Then I’ll drink some wine in the future!” Elder song said with a smile. The words of a young Divine Doctor like you are still very authoritative! “With your Imperial Sword, the healthcare workers will have no reason to object ...”

Xia ruofei almost laughed out loud. This meant that the old man was a good drinker!

He held back his laughter and said,”Grandpa song, I’ve bought two wineries in Australia and planted a new batch of grapes. It should be about time for the harvest. When this batch of wine is ready, I’ll send you a few boxes. You can keep them and drink them slowly!”

“Good, good, good!” Elder song said,”you’ve given me good stuff. That Australian red wine shouldn’t be too bad either!”

“You’re overpraising!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

The staff quickly opened the lid of the Drunken Eight Immortals wine. Upon smelling the rich aroma of the wine, eccentric song couldn’t help but sniffle and say,”Hurry up and pour us some!”

Xiao Qi quickly poured wine for elder song. When it was Xia ruofei’s turn, he waved his hand and took the bottle of wine. He poured wine for manager Lu and then poured himself a glass.

“Let’s welcome RUO Fei to the capital with the first glass of wine!” Elder song raised his glass and said,”you have to come to the capital often in the future. I heard that you bought a house in liuhai Lane? Then come over and stay for a while! You can also talk to this old man ...”

Although elder song was of high status, his children were either sent out to become officials or had their own homes in the capital. As for his grandchildren, they rarely came to visit unless it was during the new year or his birthday.

Therefore, from this perspective, he was actually a lonely old man.

Xia ruofei held his wine glass and said,”definitely!” As long as you don’t find me annoying!”

“I’m so happy to have someone to chat and play chess with me!” Elder song laughed,”why would I find you annoying? Come, come, come, cheers!”

“Cheers!”

Everyone raised their heads and finished their first glass of wine in one gulp. Xia ruofei immediately stood up and poured wine for elder song and manager Lu.

Elder song didn’t stop him. He just laughed and tapped the table.

“Have a taste of my chef’s cooking!” Elder song said,”it’s said that this roast duck is on par with the roast duck from the cheaper restaurants. I don’t know if Xiao Lin is just bragging, haha ...”

He usually ate light food, but since Xia ruofei was here today, elder song was considerate of Xia ruofei’s taste and even asked the kitchen to add a few meat dishes, including authentic Beijing roasted duck.

Manager Lu chuckled.”I heard that chef Kobayashi used to work at the discount store. He doesn’t have many opportunities to show off his roast duck skills. The chief eats very lightly!”

“Is that so?” Xia ruofei said,”then I’ll have to try it ...”

With that, he picked up a lotus leaf pancake, then picked up a roast duck, dipped it in the sweet flour sauce, picked up a scallion strip, and did the same. Finally, he rolled up the Lotus leaf pancake, stuffed it into his mouth, and took a big bite.

There was a hint of sweetness in the fresh aroma. Moreover, the roast duck of bianyi square was roasted in a low oven. Compared to Quanjude’s roast duck that was hung in a oven, the roast duck made with this method was more tender and fresh.

Xia ruofei gave him a thumbs – up after tasting it and said,””It’s so delicious!”

“Haha!” Elder song laughed, pleased. Xiao Lu, go back and praise chef Xiao Lin, his skills have been recognized by miracle doctor Xia!”

Xia ruofei was teased by elder song but he was not embarrassed. Instead, he smiled and said,””Every profession has its own specialty. No matter how amazing a miracle doctor is, he can’t compete with a chef in cooking!”

“That’s right!” Elder song said with a smile.

Everyone chatted as they ate. Although they didn’t drink much, the atmosphere was very harmonious.

“By the way, I heard that you’re going to start a business with Xiao Rui?” elder song asked.

Xia ruofei picked up a wet towel to wipe his mouth and said,””Yes, not only song Rui, but also Zhao Yongjun, brother Zhao, Liu Jian, Xu Zixuan, and the others. They’re all good friends, and everyone just wants to do business together!”

When Xia ruofei mentioned those names, manager Lu whispered into elder song’s ear about their background.

After all, other than Zhao Yongjun, the rest of elder song had never heard of their names, and there was no way they could be associated with their parents.

After elder song heard this, he nodded slightly. “It’s encouraging to do some business, but remember not to use the name of the older generation to do evil things!”

Xia ruofei quickly replied,”don’t worry about that. We are doing business openly. We have never thought of taking any shortcuts!”

Elder song looked at Xia ruofei with a half – Smile and asked,””Even if you run into the younger generation of the Liu family?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but criticize in his heart,”your grasp of the situation is too detailed.” He even knew about this ...

In fact, this matter involved elder song’s grandson, song Rui, and his favorite young man, Xia ruofei. That was why he paid more attention and specifically asked manager Lu to find out the situation.

From this, one could see how important Xia ruofei was to elder song.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei did not plan to play any tricks, so he had a clear conscience.

Therefore, he replied without hesitation,”of course!” We register our company and apply for bidding through the proper procedures. No matter who our opponent is, we won’t do anything crooked. ”

In fact, everyone had a tacit understanding on this matter. Whether it was Liu haofan’s side or Xia ruofei’s side, everyone’s strength could be said to be on par. If they really tried to pull strings to do illegal operations, neither of them would be in a good position.

“Of course, I trust you!” Elder song said with a smile. However, he was a little unsure about song Rui and the others. Since you’re working together, you have the responsibility to remind them, not just about the land, but also in the future. If they really abuse their power for personal gain, you’ll be the one getting punished!”

Xia ruofei quickly replied,”please don’t worry!” I’ll definitely fulfill my responsibility! Grandpa song, to be honest, I don’t lack money right now. Even if brother Zhao or song Rui wanted to make use of the power of the family elders to make a profit, I would definitely not agree!”

“I’m relieved to hear that ...”Elder song said, pleased.” Xiao Rui has never made me worry, but he’s improved a lot after you became friends!”

Manager Lu also smiled and said,”chief, you’re marked by your proximity to Vermillion!” If comrade RUO Fei is so outstanding, it’s only natural that he would influence and infect the friends around him!”

“That makes sense!” Elder song smiled and said,”come, come, come. Let me toast to RUO Fei! I’m thanking you for helping me discipline that grandson of mine who keeps making me worry ...”

Xia ruofei quickly replied,”I don’t dare!” I’ll toast you!”

He raised his glass and clinked it with elder song ‘s.

In fact, Xia ruofei had urged song Rui to pursue Zhuo Yiyi with a trace of guilt. It was obvious that he had fallen for her. Strictly speaking – this was not in line with the song family’s interests. Not only did Xia ruofei not stop him, but he had also helped him a lot, both openly and secretly.

“I wonder if elder song will blame me when he finds out about this ...” Xia ruofei thought uneasily.

After the meal, elder song brought Xia ruofei back to the central room in the backyard. The staff had already set up the tea set and prepared the tea leaves and spring water.

The tea leaves were the top – grade Da Hong Pao that Xia ruofei had given him. The water was specially boiled from Mount Yuquan and was the most suitable for making tea.

Xia ruofei naturally took on the task of making tea.

He skillfully cleaned the tea set and poured in the tea leaves. His movements were as smooth as floating clouds and flowing water, full of a pleasing beauty. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

After a while, the fragrant tea was divided into several small teacups. Xia ruofei placed the teacup in front of elder song and smiled.””Grandpa song, try my cooking!”
