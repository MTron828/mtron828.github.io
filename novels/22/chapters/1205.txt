Feng Rao sighed and said,”I reported to you last time that the property rights of the Hengli building belong to the provincial power construction Group, which is managed by the provincial SASAC.” This building’s sale is handled by the state – owned assets Supervision and Administration Commission, and the specific executive is a Section Chief surnamed li from the property rights management Office ...”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””I understand. The King of Hell likes to see the little devil is difficult to deal with, right?”

“Isn’t that so?” Feng Rao said with a bitter smile.

Xia ruofei knew that a Senior Manager like Feng Jing, who was also a top student who had returned from abroad, was used to the culture of foreign companies. She would definitely not be used to the shirking, wrangling, and inefficient operations of the system. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

However, Feng Jing’s EQ was quite high. Even if she didn’t like this kind of situation, she could still handle it easily. Her low mood today clearly showed that she had encountered some difficulties.

“He wants something in return?” Xia ruofei frowned and asked.

“That’s for sure ...”Feng Rao laughed bitterly,” this Section Chief li has a big appetite, and ... He’s very annoying!”

Feng Jing furrowed her brows and a look of disgust flashed across her eyes.

“We don’t object to normal courtesy. After all, this is a society of human relationships. But if they ask for too much, we can’t let them have their bad habits!” Xia ruofei’s voice turned cold.

“I know your temper, that’s why I didn’t dare to agree so easily!” Feng Rao said. Then, she lowered her voice and continued,”He wants a million ...”

“This is simply insane!” Xia ruofei snorted coldly and said,”you’re just a small section Chief. How dare you have such a big appetite for a project! It’s obvious what kind of a parasite he is usually!”

Feng Rao nodded in agreement and said,”Although I didn’t do it openly, it’s obvious. I didn’t give in, so this matter has been stagnant. We didn’t even manage to submit our acquisition letter of intent!”

Xia ruofei’s eyes flashed coldly and he said,””You don’t have to worry about this, I’ll handle it!”

He had thought that it was just a normal acquisition and that Feng Jing could handle it. The biggest problem should be raising funds. He didn’t expect that some man – made factors would cause the progress to come to a standstill. This made him a little annoyed.

Feng Jing nodded. Just then, her phone beeped with a WeChat notification.

Feng Jing took out her phone and glanced at it. She frowned and said,””Isn’t this ... They’re asking me again ...”

“Who is it?” Xia ruofei did not react immediately.

“That Section Chief li!” Feng Jing pouted.”Who else could it be?”

Xia ruofei opened his eyes wide and said,””You guys added each other on WeChat?”

“He wanted to add me the second time we met,” Feng Jing said helplessly.”He said it was more convenient to contact me about the project. How could I reject him in that situation?”

Feng Jing passed her phone to Xia ruofei and said,””You see for yourself! Look at this guy’s character!”

“Is this ... Appropriate?” Xia ruofei hesitated.

“What else can I talk about with someone like that?” Feng Rao replied angrily. What’s inappropriate about that?”

Xia ruofei laughed drily and said,”then I’ll see ...”

After that, Xia ruofei took his phone and scrolled through the WeChat conversation all the way to the top.

He saw that they had just added each other as friends. Then, he started to look at the chat history between Feng Jing and Section Chief li.

As he read on, Xia ruofei’s face darkened and the cold light in his eyes intensified.

Feng Jing was right. This Section Chief li was indeed hinting that he wanted some benefits.

What made Xia ruofei even angrier was that Section Chief li was actually coveting Feng Jing’s beauty. He kept hinting to her that she had to pay something in order to get the project and that she could be friends with him.

Xia ruofei picked up the speed of browsing. In the past few days, Section Chief li had asked Feng Jing to meet him at night at least three times. Of course, Feng Jing had rejected all of them.

Xia ruofei snorted and asked,””Boss Feng, why didn’t you report this earlier?”

Seeing Xia ruofei’s angry face, Feng Jing did not feel wronged. Instead, she felt warm inside. She said softly,””I know that you’ve been busy with the Da Hong Pao issue these days and didn’t want to distract you ...”

“I’m not doing anything specific. It’s Xiao Qiang, Ling Yun, and the others who are busy. How can I be distracted?” Xia ruofei said.

Then, he gritted his teeth and said,”isn’t this Section Chief a little too bold?” He actually dared to be so explicit in WeChat? Isn’t he afraid that you’ll take a screenshot and expose him?”

Feng Jing pursed her lips and said,”Chairman, he only added me on WeChat after we met for the second time. I’ve already seen it. It’s a new WeChat number that was requested by a new phone number, and his WeChat moments are empty. Even if we take a screenshot, we won’t be able to find anything against him. He can completely shirk his responsibility!”

Xia ruofei opened it. Just as Feng Jing had said, her moments were as clean as a beggar’s wallet. Other than some health information that she had deliberately shared in the past few days, there was nothing useful.

Feng Jing continued,”I’ve tried to get information out of him before. I tried to change the topic to the details of the project and his unit. However, he’s very alert. Whenever I talked about this, he either didn’t reply at all or avoided the topic. I couldn’t find any weakness in him at all ...”
