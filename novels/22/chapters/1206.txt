Xia ruofei nodded. He had seen what Feng Jing had said.

At the end of the chat history, the new message that chief Lee had just sent was: CEO Feng, I actually really want to be friends with you! How about this! If you’re still interested in that project, come to Shixin hotel room 503 at 8 O’ clock tonight and we’ll talk.

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said,”CEO Feng, I’ve changed my mind!” Give him a reply and agree to meet him tonight!”

Feng Rao was shocked and quickly said,””Chairman, this ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”don’t worry!” I’ll go with you tonight! I’ve always wanted to get the project, but if I don’t teach this scumbag a lesson he’ll never forget, I’m afraid I won’t be able to get over this. ”

Xia ruofei was a very protective person. He would protect his own people in every way possible. This Section Chief li actually had evil ideas about Feng Jing. Xia ruofei could not let him off so easily.

“Chairman, we can’t do anything illegal!” Feng Jing said worriedly. Why not ... Forget it! “There are a lot of scumbags like him. It’s fine as long as the project goes smoothly. I didn’t lose anything anyway ...”

“No!” Xia ruofei said decisively,”it’s settled then! President Feng, don’t worry! I’m trained by the Army, how can I go back and do illegal things!”

Feng Rao hesitated for a moment before finally nodding.”Alright then! I’ll listen to you ...”

After speaking, Feng Jing didn’t hesitate any longer. She picked up her phone and immediately replied to chief li. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”alright, I’ll arrange the rest!” You should go back and rest for a while, you must be tired these few days. Let’s go after dinner!”

“Good! “Chairman, I’ll head back first ...” Feng Jing said as she stood up.

Xia ruofei smiled at her gently and nodded.

After Feng Jing left, the smile on Xia ruofei’s face immediately disappeared. His expression turned cold. He leaned back in his office chair and pondered for a moment. Then, he took out his phone and made a call.

......

The property rights management Office of the provincial capital administration.

In a small independent office, a man in his mid – thirties in a gray jacket was writing materials on the computer. There were two mobile phones next to him, and one of them suddenly rang with a WeChat notification.

This man was the Section Chief li that Feng Jing had mentioned.

He stopped typing and hesitantly picked up the phone. He lit up the screen and looked at it. Then, the corners of his mouth slowly curved up, and his eyes revealed a proud look.

Section Chief li muttered to himself,”I knew it ... Who would have a problem with money?” No matter how arrogant a woman was, she would still be willing to do anything in the face of great benefits. Hehe, great beauty, at least you’re aware of the situation!”

After that, Section Chief li quickly replied to Feng Jing, It seems that boss Feng has finally thought it through. I’ll be waiting at the hotel tonight!

Then, he immediately picked up another phone and skillfully dialed a number.””Hey, gang Zi, help me book a room.”

“No problem, brother li. Which one do you want?”

“Isn’t that obvious? 503!”

“Alright! I’ve been saving this room for you! “The guest rooms were full the day before yesterday, and I didn’t even give them out ...” The voice on the other end of the phone had a hint of flattery.

“Alright, alright! I know you’re a sensible kid!” Section Chief Li said,”don’t worry! Of course ... The prerequisite is that you have to keep your mouth shut!”

“Hehe! I understand!” Gang Zi quickly said,”your business is more important than my own. I won’t tell anyone anything about you, even if you beat me to death!”

“Alright, hurry up and prepare the room for me. I’ll come over after dinner!” Division Chief Li said impatiently.

He hung up the phone right after he finished speaking and continued to gather the materials while humming a song.

After Feng Jing’s WeChat reply, his brain seemed to have become a lot brighter. He was simply filled with ideas, and his efficiency in obtaining materials instantly increased.

......

At Taoyuan farm, Xia ruofei and Feng Jing had dinner together in the company’s cafeteria. Then, the two of them walked out of the general office building side by side.

A black Mercedes drove over and stopped in front of the office building.

Ye Lingyun got down from the car and handed Xia ruofei a car key.””Brother Xia, I’ve already driven the car over!”

“Alright! Ling Yun, thank you for your hard work!” Xia ruofei patted ye Lingyun’s shoulder and said affectionately,”you and your brothers should rest well these few days. The next batch of tea leaves won’t be here so soon.”

“I know!” Ye linyun said.

Xia ruofei nodded at ye Lingyun, then said to Feng Rao,””President Feng, let’s go!”

Feng Rao hesitated but did not say anything in the end. She only nodded and got into the car with Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei started the car and drove out of the farm, quickly disappearing into the night.

The reason he chose the company’s Mercedes – Benz was that the Knight XV was too ostentatious, and the Mercedes – Benz was just right for Feng Jing’s status as the company’s CEO.

The sound insulation of the Mercedes – Benz was very good. When all four windows were closed, the sound of the engine and tire noise could not be heard from inside the car.

Feng Rao sat quietly in the front passenger seat. After a long time, she finally couldn’t help but say,””Chairman, later ... Don’t be impulsive! If you hit him, then you’ll become unreasonable even if you’re reasonable!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Do I look like that kind of rude person? Don’t worry! Don’t worry!”

Feng Jing knew that Xia ruofei was very good at fighting. During the day in Xia ruofei’s office, she had noticed the cold look in Xia ruofei’s eyes when he saw the chat history, so she couldn’t be at ease!

However, since she had already come out with Xia ruofei, she could not back out now. Hence, she could only hide her worries in her heart.

The car drove for about 20 minutes on the winding Expressway. After passing through a bridge across Min River, they could see the lights of the city in front.

After another ten minutes, Xia ruofei’s Black Mercedes arrived at Shixin hotel, which was mentioned in chief Li’s WeChat.

After Xia ruofei parked the car, he turned off the engine and asked,””CEO Feng, do you remember what I said on the way here?”

“I’ll remember everything, but Chairman ...”Feng Jing said nervously.

“Don’t worry, I’ll be right outside the door. I’ll be able to detect anything that happens in the room and appear in front of you in three seconds!”

Xia ruofei’s voice was steady and full of confidence, which calmed Feng Jing’s uneasy heart.

Feng Rao nodded and said,””I believe you!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””According to your description, this Section Chief li might be very careful. He might be looking down from behind the window! So, from the moment I get out of the car, I’ll be your driver. Don’t forget ...”

“I can’t forget!” Feng Rao laughed. It’s not easy for you to be a leader!”

Xia ruofei smiled and shook his head. Then, he opened the door and got out of the car. He jogged around the front of the car and opened the door for Feng Jing. He even put his hand on the door to prevent Feng Jing from hitting her head.

Feng Jing held back her laughter as she stepped out of the car. After closing the door, Xia ruofei took Feng Jing’s handbag and walked into the hotel half a step behind her.

The two of them walked through the lobby and went straight to the elevator.

In the elevator, Feng Jing whispered,””Chairman, you’re very skilled in your business! Have you done carrying bags before?”

Xia ruofei’s expression was serious and he looked straight ahead. However, he also lowered his voice and said,””Don’t you usually learn to serve beautiful women without a teacher?”

Feng Rao’s face blushed slightly, but she felt a sense of sweetness in her heart.

Ding! Ding! The elevator soon reached the fifth floor.

The two of them walked down the corridor and found Room 503. Xia ruofei pressed the doorbell.

Within a few seconds, the door of the room suddenly opened. Director li appeared at the door in a set of pajamas and a pair of disposable slippers.

Xia ruofei glanced at him. This person was in his thirties. His hair was a little thin and he was probably starting to go bald. He might have had some alcohol during dinner, but his face was glowing and he looked like a greasy middle – aged man.

The moment Section Chief li saw Feng Jing, his smile became even more passionate. However, he also saw Xia ruofei who was standing beside Feng Jing at the same time. He immediately stopped smiling and asked coldly,”CEO Feng, who is this person?”
