Song Wei and Ling Qingxue had just seen with their own eyes that the lake water could make a chub explode. Now that they saw the lake water rushing towards Xia ruofei, they could not help but feel a little scared.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,&quot;you guys don‚Äôt have to worry!&quot; Since I dared to accept it, 1 naturally have a way! Could it be that in your eyes, I am such a stupid and reckless person? Be good and step back a little. Watch how I collect all the lake water!&quot;

Only then did Song Wei and Ling Qingxue obediently step back. However, their eyes were still filled with worry.

Xia ruofei‚Äôs back was facing his two close female friends. In fact, the spirit painting scroll had already appeared in his palm.

After the lake water was drawn over, it entered the spirit painting. It seemed like it was all in his palm but in reality, it did not touch Xia ruofei‚Äôs body at all.

After the lake water was absorbed into the spirit map space, Xia ruofei naturally did not dare to place it carelessly. The space was filled with precious crops and all his belongings, so he naturally did not dare to let his guard down.

At the mountain sea realm, he used spatial power to create a small space, which floated above the sea of space.

After the lake water entered the spirit map space, it was directly stored in this small space.

It was constructed using the rules of space and was more secure than any other container. After all, this small space had no physical boundary. Even if the lake water was strongly corrosive, it was impossible to damage the small space, especially in the spirit map space. This kind of thing was even more impossible to happen.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue stared at Xia ruofei worriedly. The lake water was like a Swimming Dragon. Xia ruofei took it from a distance and kept on disappearing from his palm. After a long time, Xia ruofei did not show any signs of abnormality. The two of them were slightly relieved.

Xia ruofei was absorbing the lake water very quickly. Of course, the lake was not that big, so the water level was dropping at a visible rate.

In the mountain and sea realm of the spirit map space, there was a small space above the sea of space that was constructed by an invisible spatial force. It was like a reservoir, and the water level slowly rose.

Xia ruofei controlled it carefully, making sure that every drop of lake water entered the small space.

If there was any leakage, even if it was just a drop, it could cause extremely dire consequences. Below them was the sea of space. If this drop of lake water directly polluted the entire sea, then all the living creatures in the sea would explode and die.

When Xia ruofei was absorbing the lake water, he was actually very careful. After all, the lake could suppress the detection of spiritual power. He was not sure if there was any danger at the bottom of the lake.

After a while, more than half of the lake‚Äôs water had been absorbed.
