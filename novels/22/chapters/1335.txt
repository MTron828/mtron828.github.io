Chapter 1336: The older the ginger, the spicier it is (2)

“That’s true ...” Ling Xiaotian muttered to himself,”but the artificially cultivated United States rays on the market are already selling for hundreds of Yuan per catty. The taste is not even close to the quality of your Yangtze River rays!” Therefore, the price can not be too low!”

“Do you have any suggestions?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Between 3500 to 5000!” Ling Xiaotian thought for a moment and said,”the two Chinese perch I bought last time were 3000 Yuan per 500 grams. Now the price has risen again. According to old su, the Chinese perch you cultivate is more delicious than the wild Chinese perch. So if it’s less than 3000 Yuan, it’s a bit of a loss, and it’s also a drop in grade!”

“I’m just worried that if it’s too expensive ... The consumers “enthusiasm to buy will decrease.” Xia ruofei voiced out his concerns.”After all, we’re selling it in bulk. It’s different from the special case where you bought the pomfrets.”

Ling Xiaotian couldn’t help but laugh.”How can one or two thousand catties a month be considered a batch sale? Besides, there’s no shortage of rich people in China today. Not to mention big cities like Beijing and Shen Cheng, even in the three mountains, the 300 catties you gave us will definitely be in short supply!”

As expected of father and daughter, their judgment was surprisingly consistent.

After hearing Ling Xiaotian’s words, Xia ruofei made up his mind. He nodded and said,””Alright, then I’ll consider it according to the range of 3500 to 5000! I’ve already asked the sales department to collect information. We’ll decide on the price in the meeting tomorrow!”

Then, Xia ruofei suddenly thought of something and immediately said,””Uncle Ling, I’ll give you the 300 catties of kun fish from the lingji private kitchen at the price of 2000 Yuan!”

However, Ling Xiaotian said,”there’s no need for special treatment!” Business matters should be done as they should be. I’m already very satisfied that I can get a quota of three hundred catties through your back door!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“That won’t do! How can I sell it to you at the market price?” Xia ruofei said,”besides, even if we follow the price of 2000 Yuan per 500 grams, our profit is still very big!”

“Profit is profit, selling price ...”

“Uncle Ling, this matter is settled!” Xia ruofei immediately interrupted Ling Xiaotian and said,”if you want to buy the Paradise mandarin fish, then pay me the price I set. Otherwise, I will not give you a single one!”

“You child ...” Ling Xiaotian could not help but smile bitterly and said,”alright! Then we’ll do as you say!”

Xia ruofei was his future son – in – Law. He would not be so unreasonable as to reject Xia ruofei’s offer even if he offered a better price.

“You mentioned two problems. Other than the selling price, what else do you have?” Ling Xiaotian asked.

Xia ruofei said,”the other problem is the transportation problem!” You know that Chinese perch are very timid. If there’s a slight bump during transportation, or even a little bit of noise, they might turn white. If we don’t solve this problem, we won’t be able to sell it. ”

“This is a little troublesome.” Ling Xiaotian couldn’t help but feel a little troubled.

“Uncle Ling, you have a lot of experience in the food and beverage industry. If there is a similar situation, how do other companies usually deal with it?” Xia ruofei asked humbly.

Ling Xiaotian said,”I’ll provide two ways to solve this!” The first is to sell it locally, which means that you’re mainly doing it in Sanshan city and its surrounding markets. This way, the transportation distance is short, and if protective measures are taken, it should not be a big problem. “However, the drawback is that the range of influence is too small, and the market is a little small. 2000 catties a month can barely be digested by the market, but it’s not easy to create a situation where the supply is short of supply. Maybe the price will not be so firm.”

Xia ruofei nodded.”If it’s not a last resort, I’m sure I want to do more than just Sanshan market.”

What Xia ruofei valued more was the brand’s value. If it could only be sold in the Sanshan region, the added value of the brand would be next to nothing to the Paradise Corporation.

The peach blossom company’s three mountains was already very famous, and the launch of pomfrets would only be the icing on the cake. However, if it could be sold to other parts of the country, or even overseas, it would be a different scene.

“Then there’s probably only one option, which is the quick – freeze.” Ling Xiaotian said.

“Frozen?” Xia ruofei was stunned.

“Right! The Pomfret is quickly frozen in a professional cold storage to maintain the taste and nutrients of the fish to the maximum. ” Ling Xiaotian said,”as long as there is no problem with the transportation, the journey from the cold storage to the dining table will take at most one or two days. It should not affect the taste.”

Xia ruofei thought for a while.”Our farm is adjacent to San Shan airport. It’s very convenient to transport it to all parts of the country by Air Express.”

At this point, Xia ruofei paused and said with some concern,””What I’m worried about is whether the consumers will accept it.”

Frozen pomfrets and fresh pomfrets were two completely different concepts. When eating seafood outside, the prices of frozen and fresh pomfrets were completely different.

And the Chinese perch was a high – end food, and high – end consumers were very picky about the quality of ingredients. Would they not like the frozen Chinese perch? Xia ruofei had to consider this possibility.

“I can’t think of a way to have the best of both worlds at the moment,” Ling Xiaotian replied. However, as far as the Pomfret itself was concerned, if it was frozen quickly and used within three days, the taste would basically not be affected. However, for the consumers ...”

At this point, Ling Xiaotian could not help but fall into deep thought. He slowly said,””We can only rely on public opinion to guide the consumers! After all, we can’t control other people’s thoughts. If we publicize the special characteristics of the pomfrets and let more people know about the freezing technology that locked the taste and nutrition content of the pomfrets, the impact will be minimal. ”

Ling Xiaotian’s idea had opened Xia ruofei’s mind. He thought about it and felt that it was a feasible idea.

Xia ruofei’s thoughts were scattered as he said,””I think this is a good idea! “Uncle Ling, we can still cooperate with e – commerce in the early stage. Now, Ali, jingbei, and other Big e – commerce companies have formed a complete ecosystem and have a great influence on the internet. “In addition, we can also consider asking the Internet Water Army to write some soft articles and the like to spread knowledge to everyone ...”

Ling Xiaotian and Xia ruofei both laughed with a tacit understanding.

Ling Xiaotian continued,”Oh, that’s right. Even if it’s the goods from the three mountain region, you can use the quick – freeze method. There’s no exception even if it’s for our Ling Ji private kitchen.”

“All frozen?” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but hesitate.

In fact, if it was sold in the Sanshan area, it was possible to transport fresh and live fish. As long as they were a little careful during the transportation process, it would not be a big problem.

It could obviously be kept fresh, but was there a need to freeze it and sell it? Xia ruofei thought.

Ling Xiaotian explained,”didn’t you just say that we should form everyone’s mindset?” Even if it’s sold at our doorstep, it’s all frozen. Isn’t that the most convincing?”

Xia ruofei was suddenly enlightened and said,””That makes sense! Uncle Ling, the older the ginger, the spicier it is!”

Ling Xiaotian couldn’t help but laugh heartily.

Xia ruofei then asked hesitantly,””But ... Will the taste really not be affected after being frozen?”

“If you say you won ‘t, then you naturally won’ t!” Ling Xiaotian said,”who has ever really eaten fresh Pomfret? But don’t worry, even if there’s an impact, it’ll be very small and won’t ruin your Tao Yuan signboard. ”

“Understood!” Xia ruofei said in his heart.

“But ... If you’re bringing it to show your respect to me, it’s best if it’s still a live fish!” Ling Xiaotian continued.

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment and quickly said,””No problem! Uncle Ling, I’ll get someone to send another one over later! It’ll be just right for you and Qingxue to steam it for dinner!”

“Um ... You don’t have to be so polite, right?” Ling Xiaotian said, then immediately added,”I’ll be at home around FiveO’ clock!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”Alright! I’ll have it delivered on time!”
