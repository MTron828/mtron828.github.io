2196 Setting sail (2)

Of course, Feng Rao didn’t show it. Instead, she held Ling Qingxue’s hand and looked very intimate.

Xia ruofei could not understand the things between women. Ling Qingxue was obviously wary of Feng Rao. Last night, she even stayed over for the first time. Now, the two of them were as close as sisters.

Xia ruofei shook his head and called the two over for breakfast.

After the meal, Xia ruofei drove Ling Qingxue back to the company before driving to the Tao Yuan building.

On the way, Feng Jing remained silent, and the atmosphere was a little heavy.

Seeing that the Paradise building was not far away, Feng Jing suddenly asked,””RUO Fei, Qingxue ... Could there be some misunderstanding?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it’s fine!” Sister ran, don’t think too much! Even if there’s a misunderstanding, I’ve already explained it clearly last night ...”

Feng Rao couldn’t help but think of the voice from upstairs last night. She nodded silently and didn’t say anything else.

Xia ruofei parked the car in the underground parking lot and the two of them took the elevator to the top floor.

At the elevator.

Xia ruofei said to Feng Jing,”sister Jing, please inform the senior management at home that we’ll meet up in an hour!” I’m listening to everyone’s work reports during this period. ”

The reason why he set aside an hour was that he considered that Xue Jinshan and the others were most likely at the construction site in Changping County, so he had to set aside time for the meeting.

“Alright!” Feng Jing nodded.

After returning to the company, Feng Jing became a strong career woman again, arranging her work meticulously.

An hour later, in the large conference room on the top floor, all the company’s senior executives had arrived. Even Cao tieshu, who was in charge of the farm, had rushed over.

In fact, Feng Jing had already briefly reported the main work to him yesterday, so Xia ruofei had an idea of what to do.

After listening to everyone’s report, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Everyone has worked hard during this period of time, and your work has been fruitful. I’m often not in the company, but I’m very relieved to have a group of capable subordinates like you. I may have to go to Beijing again in a while, so I hope everyone doesn’t slack off at work. It’s going to be the new year soon, so I hope we can finish our work this year! Alright, let’s split up! By the way, old Cao, please stay ...”

The high – ranking officials stood up and left the meeting room, leaving Cao tieshu behind.

“Big brother Cao, how did you get here?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“Factory manager Xue gave me a ride.” Cao tieshu said with a simple and honest smile on his face.

“Didn’t you leave a car at the farm? As the person in charge of the farm, you should just send the cars. You don’t have to save on gas. ” Xia ruofei said,”factory manager Xue must have gone back first. I’ll arrange a car to send you back later!”

“Thank you, Chairman.” Cao tieshu said.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”big brother Cao, I asked you to stay because I want to tell you about the goose farm.” You’ve done well in this matter! That Xiao liuzi is a talent!”

“Chairman, Xiao liuzi is cultured. He likes to think about things. I can’t compare to him ...” Cao tieshu said with a smile.

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.”No matter how capable he is, he’s still a young man who just graduated from school. He can’t be compared to you!”

Xia ruofei continued,”but he’s been doing a great job recently. I’ve decided to promote him to a full – time employee in advance!” Go back and inform him to come to the headquarters to handle the employment procedures. I have already spoken to President Feng about this, she will only report to the Human Resources Department. ”

Hearing this, Cao tieshu was overjoyed and quickly said,””Chairman, I thank you on behalf of Xiao Liu Zi!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”you’re welcome. That kid is a talent!” That’s our company’s culture. As long as you have the ability and make a contribution to the company, I will not be stingy with the rewards! Tell Xiao liuzi to run his TikTok account well. In addition, he has to continue to concentrate on raising the geese. I’m counting on him to take the lead when we start large – scale breeding next!”

“Alright, alright! I’ll definitely tell him your exact words!” Cao tieshu said.

Xia ruofei continued to chat with Cao tieshu about the farm.

Although the farm’s profits could not catch up to the factory ‘s, it was the foundation of Xia ruofei’s fortune. He had always placed great importance on the farm business.

After a few years of training, Cao tieshu had long since transformed from an illiterate uneducated man to a qualified farm manager. When he talked about the work that he was in charge of, he was also well – versed in it.

After the two of them talked for a while, Xia ruofei gave Lei Hu, who was in charge of the convoy, a call and asked him to send Cao tieshu back to the farm.

For the next two days, Xia ruofei showed up at the office on time, which was a rare occasion, and took care of the backlog of work.

In addition, he also took some time to go to the farm and personally inspected the manufacturing factory and the goose farm. He also gave Xiao liuzi some encouragement.

In the blink of an eye, it was the weekend. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Ling Qingxue had already informed Ling Xiaotian that she would be going out to sea with Xia ruofei this weekend. They would be returning on Sunday after spending a night at sea.

Ling Xiaotian could not wait for Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue to be together! Xia ruofei was often not at home, and Ling Qingxue was usually very busy with work. The two of them did not spend much time together, and Ling Xiaotian was worried that their relationship would slowly fade! Therefore, he was quite supportive of it.

Early Saturday morning, Xia ruofei drove the Knight XV to pick up Ling Qingxue from the Ling family villa, then headed towards the Yacht Club.

On the way, Xia ruofei was a little nervous. He was full of anticipation for the upcoming trip to the sea, but at the same time, he was a little nervous.

This was because he had already decided that once they were out at sea, he would definitely cultivate together with Ling Qingxue. If Ling Qingxue’s cultivation level broke through to refined Qi Level 3, then he would begin to try to cultivate both spirit and body ...

Naturally, Ling Qingxue did not know about Xia ruofei’s plans. She was extremely happy and chattered non – stop.

It didn’t take long for the car to arrive at the Yacht Club.

The manager, Qin Lan, who had been informed by Xia ruofei the day before, was already waiting at the club.

When she saw Xia ruofei, she immediately greeted him with a smile.

“Manager Qin, this is my girlfriend, Ling Qingxue,” Xia ruofei introduced.

With a warm smile on his face, Qin Lan said,””Hello, President Ling! I’ve long heard of your great name!”

It was Qin Lan’s compulsory course to study the client’s information. On the other hand, Xia ruofei’s information was quite easy to collect. One could get a lot of relevant information by asking Baidu directly. The relationship between Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue was no longer a secret on the internet. Naturally, Qin Lan could recognize Ling Qingxue at first glance.

Ling Qingxue also smiled and greeted Qin Lan.

Xia ruofei asked,”manager Qin, is the maintenance of the yacht done?” And the fuel is full, right?”

“Don’t worry. I personally made the arrangements after I received the notice yesterday.” Qin Lan smiled and said,”your paradise is now full of health. You can set sail at any time!”

“Thank you!” Xia ruofei said,”send the bill to my email. I’ll transfer the money to you as soon as possible!”

“Thank you, Mr. Xia!” Qin Lan said.

Qin Lan personally sent Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue to the exclusive berth of the peach source. After watching them board the ship and leave the port, she returned in her scooter.

On the Paradise, Ling Qingxue could not contain her excitement. She stood in the cockpit and kept talking to Xia ruofei.

“Ruofei, this yacht is so beautiful!” Even though Ling Qingxue had already experienced the yacht on the day of the trial flight, she still couldn’t help but exclaim in admiration.

Xia ruofei laughed as he steered the yacht.””You don’t think I’m a prodigal now, do you? This 70 million is well worth it!”

After the yacht left the busy waters near the dock, it drove at full speed towards the open sea. It gradually left the land behind and came to the vast sea ...
