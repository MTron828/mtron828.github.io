Chapter 250: A stray dog (1)

“Who called the police just now?” A rough voice rang out. Then, four police officers walked into the Finance Office. The Finance Office was originally quite big, but there were already 20 to 30 people in it. It seemed even more crowded with the police officers. The leader was a police officer with a full beard. After he entered the office, he was surprised to find that Secretary Tian of the municipal Party was also here. He couldn’t help but be stunned. Some of the young police officers who came along didn’t know Tian Huilan. When he saw that his Police Chief suddenly stopped talking and just stood there in a daze, he couldn’t help but feel a little strange. He gently touched the bearded police officer’s arm. Only then did the bearded police officer come back to his senses. He quickly strode in front of Tian Huilan and saluted, saying in a clear voice,””Reporting to Secretary Tian, the Deputy Director of the jinrong police station, song Tianhao, is currently on the move. Please give us your instructions!” Tian Huilan nodded slightly, then asked,”Who just called the police?” No one spoke at the scene. Lin Feng and little Shen, who had called the police, both lowered their heads guiltily. Originally, it was Lin Feng’s greatest reliance to deal with Xia ruofei, but now, it had become the greatest hot potato. The Deputy Director, song Tianhao, saw that no one was speaking and couldn’t help but feel strange. He looked at Tian Huilan, only to see that she was expressionless. He couldn’t guess what the leader was thinking and didn’t know what to do for a moment. Song Tianhao thought for a moment, then turned around and asked,””Little Zhang, check the phone number on the police report ...” Xia ruofei pointed at Shen and laughed.”Superintendent song, there’s no need to trouble yourself. It was that colleague from the tax bureau who called the police. ” Little Shen’s face turned pale and he stammered,””I ... I ...” “What’s going on?”Tian Huilan frowned and asked. Xia ruofei said indifferently,”Secretary Tian, didn’t they bring a bunch of hooligans to” enforce the law “?” This group of hooligans caused trouble in the office and I subdued them. As a result, the Deputy Secretary’s son ordered the tax bureau to call the police to arrest me ...” Xia ruofei’s words contained a lot of information. The hooligan was “enforcing the law” with the government. He was the son of a Deputy Secretary and did not have any position, but he could give orders to the staff of the tax bureau ... Almost every word he said was a stab to the heart. The few bureau chiefs that Tian Huilan had brought with her all looked a little embarrassed, and Lin Wanshui’s face was even paler. He had always thought that the worst had come, but he didn’t expect that the worst situation would always exceed his imagination. “No!” Lin Feng’s expression changed as he tried to explain,”I ... I didn ‘t! You were the one who beat up the security company’s staff first, and that’s why Shen called the police! By the way, they’re not punks, they’re employees of a regular security company ... If it weren’t for your violent resistance to the law, Shen and the others wouldn’t have spent money to hire a security company for help ...” “Shut up!” Lin Wanshui came up and slapped Lin Feng twice in exasperation. He then roared,”you little bastard, you still dare to quibble now! Just how many disgraceful things have you done behind my back!” Two clear palm imprints appeared on Lin Feng’s fair face. He looked at his father in fear, no longer having his usual elegance. Lin Wanshui immediately put on a bitter face and said to Tian Huilan,””Secretary Tian, it’s all my fault for not disciplining this unfilial son. I didn’t know that he had used my name to do so many lawless things outside. I need to reflect on myself ...” Tian Huilan’s face was still as calm as an ancient well, completely unmoved by Lin Wanshui’s performance. She didn’t even look at Lin Wanshui as she indifferently said to song Tianhao,”Superintendent song, since you’re all out, bring these troublemakers back! Interrogate him properly and find out who’s behind this!” “Yes!” Song Tianhao stood at attention, raised his head, and replied in a clear voice. Then, he waved his hand and several police officers immediately came up to arrest him. They didn’t have enough handcuffs, so they used plastic straps to tie up all the hooligans and took them out. After the police and the hooligans left, the office suddenly became much more spacious. Tian Huilan looked around at the crowd and said indifferently,”Bureau chiefs, please come over and take your people back! I hope that you will immediately correct today’s mistake after you go back and revoke the punishment for violating the rules. In addition, you will carry out a rectification of work style in your units. As an important link in this mass education activity, report the rectification situation to me directly!” “Yes, Secretary Tian!” “Secretary Tian, we will definitely carry out your instructions and requirements!” Several bureau chiefs expressed their opinions one after another, and then angrily called out a few of their subordinates who had caused trouble in their units. Little Shen and the others were all dejected. They knew very well that there would be a storm waiting for them when they returned. The directors took their people and left one after another. Only Lin Wanshui and his son didn’t know whether to stay or leave. They were like prisoners waiting for their sentence. Tian Huilan continued to ignore them. Instead, she greeted Xia ruofei, Ling Xiaotian, and the others affably before walking out of the door. Tian Huilan’s Secretary, Xiao Mei, looked at Xia ruofei. She opened her mouth as if she wanted to say something but stopped. Then, she sighed and quickly caught up with Tian Huilan. Xia ruofei looked at Xiao Mei’s back thoughtfully and suddenly said in a clear voice,””Chief Xiao, thank you for today!” Tian Huilan and Xiao Mei both stopped and turned around. Xiao Mei had a complicated expression on her face. Xia ruofei smiled and continued.”Director Xiao, if you didn’t report to Secretary Tian in time, this matter might not have been resolved so smoothly. Thank you!” Xiao Mei immediately understood. Her eyes flashed with gratitude and she quickly said,””Mr. Xia, you’re too kind. I didn’t do my job well, please forgive me!” “It’s all in the past, let’s not talk about it ...”Xia ruofei laughed. Tian Huilan looked at Xia ruofei and Xiao Mei thoughtfully. Then, she smiled and nodded at Xia ruofei before turning to leave the office. As Tian Huilan walked, she said to Xiao Mei,””Little Xiao, you can ask little Wu for more advice when you have time. She has a lot of experience in the field of being a Secretary.” Xiao Mei was stunned for a moment, then she said with a smile,””Okay, thank you, Secretary Tian!” Tian Huilan had asked her to consult Wu Liqian more, which meant that her mistake this time had been covered up and she hadn’t been kicked out. In the office, Lin Wanshui and his son stood there in a daze. Lin Wanshui thought about it and walked forward, saying,””President Ling, this is all a mistake ...” “Get lost!” Xia ruofei coldly spat out a word. “You ...” Lin Feng angrily shouted when he saw this. Lin Wanshui quickly pulled Lin Feng and said to Xia ruofei with a sad face,””Mr. Xia, please forgive us and let us go this time! Please help me in front of Secretary Tian ...” In the afternoon, Lin Wanshui was still the high – spirited Deputy Secretary of the municipal Party Committee. He had a serious tone when he talked to Xiao Mei, but now he had become a complete failure in politics. He was a stray dog that could face prison at any time. Xia ruofei did not even look at them and said,””A few men, get these two guys out!” “Mr. Xia, Mr. Xia ...” Lin Wanshui anxiously called out. A few male employees unceremoniously chased Lin Wanshui and his son out. They had witnessed little Shen’s group’s arrogant and domineering behavior. Now that they knew that these two people were the instigators, they were already filled with anger. After Lin Wanshui and his son were chased away, everyone in the office looked at Xia ruofei. In their eyes, this young man was really amazing. Even Secretary Tian had come personally to seek justice for him, and a Deputy Secretary General was like a chicken that couldn’t even withstand a single blow. Some of the more observant female employees had noticed that during the conflict, Xia ruofei had held Ling Qingxue’s hand tightly, so many people were looking at Ling Qingxue with more ambiguous looks. Ling Qingxue’s face turned slightly red. She quickly glanced at Xia ruofei and said,””What are you all looking at? Hurry up and clean up the office! What kind of mess is this?” Ling Xiaotian laughed in comfort and said,””Everyone, please work hard and restore everything to its original position! Xiao Xia, Qingxue, let’s go to my office and sit for a while!”Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m
