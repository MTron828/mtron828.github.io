Chapter 399: County Head Wu’s inspection (2)

Luo Dali was different from Cao tieshu and the others. As a village leader, he liked to watch the news when he had nothing to do at home. He did not recognize Wu Liqian when she entered the house, but he could not help but take a few more glances at the beautiful woman who followed his boss in.

The more Luo Dali looked at her, the more he found her familiar. In the end, he suddenly thought,’isn’t she the beautiful County Head who appears on the county TV news almost every day?’

“Isn’t this County Head Wu?”he couldn’t help but exclaim.

Cao tieshu, who had just bent down, couldn’t help but frown.”Dali, what County Head Wu?”

Luo Dali quickly pouted at Wu Liqian and said,””Old Cao, over there! That’s the new mayor Wu!”

Cao tieshu turned his head in surprise and looked at Wu Liqian.

He didn’t usually pay much attention to the news. In fact, most farmers lived in this way. Many of them didn’t even know who the head of the village was, let alone the Secretary of the county.

Wu Liqian smiled bitterly. Xia ruofei shrugged and said in a low voice,””Sis Wu, I’m not betraying you ...”

Wu Liqian quickly rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei. Then, she put on a kind smile and walked over to him.”Hello, fellow villagers!”

“County Head Wu, it’s really you!” Luo Dali said excitedly as he rubbed his hands. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

As a former village cadre, the highest – ranking official he had ever seen was the head of the village. He had only seen her once from afar when he had gone to the village for a meeting as a correspondent. He had never expected to see the beautiful County Head that he could only see on TV today. Luo Dali felt like he was in a dream.

Cao tieshu and the others also greeted Wu Liqian. However, after knowing that this beautiful woman was actually the head of the county, the workers were a little restrained.

Wu Liqian had been a leader in the government for many years. She quickly changed to the role of a County Leader. She had an amiable smile on her face as she chatted with Cao tieshu and the others. She asked them about their family situation, their work here, their income, and so on.

In layman’s terms, it meant that there were a few people in the family, a few acres of land per person, a few cattle in the field, and so on.

Cao tieshu and the others answered one by one with slight restraint. Wu Liqian also pretended to listen attentively, giving people a feeling of being very friendly.

In fact, this was a compulsory course for political figures. The higher the position of the leader, the more people would feel that he was like a gentle breeze and a light drizzle.

After chatting with Cao tieshu and the rest for a while, Wu Liqian left the greenhouse with Xia ruofei, saying that she would not disturb them from their work.

After Wu Liqian left, the tense atmosphere in the vegetable greenhouse that was about to freeze eased up immediately. Cao tieshu and the rest realized that their backs were covered in sweat, more than the amount they had sweated after working in the field for half a day.

“My God, our boss is really capable. He even managed to invite the county Head!” Cao tieshu muttered.

“Old Cao, if I didn’t tell you, you wouldn’t have known that he’s our County Head!” Luo Dali said proudly.

“Only you can!” Cao tieshu said unhappily,”didn’t you see that the boss didn’t even introduce little Wu’s identity? Maybe County Head Wu was traveling incognito! Now that you’ve exposed her, you can just wait for her to punish you!”

“Ah? It can’t be that serious, right?” Luo Dali’s face turned pale.

He thought about it carefully and felt that what Cao tieshu said made sense. He became even more uneasy.

At this moment, a worker named Xu Chuntian, who was in his fifties, laughed and said,””Dali, old Cao is just trying to scare you! You’re taking it seriously ... Little County Head Wu doesn’t put on any airs. Why would he blame you for such a small matter?”

Luo Dali felt a little more at ease. Then, his curiosity was aroused again. He looked in the direction of the entrance of the vegetable greenhouse and said in a low voice,””Eh? Do you think this County Head Wu and our boss are a couple? You don’t say, the two of them really look quite compatible when they stand there!”

Cao tieshu glared at Luo Dali and said,”Dali, why don’t you shut your mouth? Could such words be said carelessly? It’ll be terrible if the county Head hears this ...”

Xu Chuntian also said,”yeah!” Don’t say that. Isn’t our boss’s girlfriend that girl with the surname Ling?”

“I’m just saying ...” Luo Dali said with an embarrassed smile.”But County Head Wu is too young. It’s easy to misunderstand ...”

“You still dare to say that? You have nothing to do, right? Go and bring that bag of seeds over!” Cao tieshu glared at Luo Dali and said.

“Everyone, stop spreading rumors!” He shouted.”Get to work!”

On the other hand, Xia ruofei brought Wu Liqian around the construction site. Then, the two of them went to the orchard on the mountain and finally found a place near the water tower to rest.

Xia ruofei carefully brushed the dust off the stone and took out two pieces of facial tissues to spread on it. Then, he invited Wu Liqian to sit down.

Wu Liqian enjoyed the feeling of being taken care of. She smiled and said,””Thank you!”

After Wu Liqian sat down, Xia ruofei naturally sat down on her left side.

Wu Liqian looked at the sea in the distance and said,””Xiao Xia, I’m really envious of you. You have your own farm. Your place is really like a paradise, facing the sea every day. You’re like a god!”
