Chapter 546: Chapter 425 – Sales increase (3)

“Alright, alright!” Li Jing said excitedly,”director Wang, our factory will also launch a high – end series of Drunken Eight Immortals wine in the future. The estimated retail price is 388,588, and 888. If you need it, you can contact me directly. I will definitely give you the biggest discount!”

“Sure, sure,” chief Wang said with a smile.

After ending the call with director Wang, Li Jing immediately sent a sample of the contract with the agreed price to the email provided by director Wang.

Then, he lit a cigarette with trembling hands.

With the sudden surge in the sales of Drunken Eight Immortals, Li Jing felt the need to report to Ling Xiaotian immediately.

He picked up the landline phone on his desk and put it back after some thought.

Li Jing felt that it was best to report such an important matter in person.

So he stood up, randomly stuffed his cigarettes and cell phone into his bag, and then rushed out of the door, driving straight to the headquarters of Ling Ji F & B.

……

On Xia ruofei’s side, he drove the Knight XV to the city.

On the way, Lin Shengnan received a text message to remind her that the 80000 Yuan advance salary that Xia ruofei had asked pang Hao to give Lin Shengnan had been received.

“Mr. Xia, can you send me to the Agricultural Bank of China first?” Lin Shengnan asked after some thought.

Xia ruofei guessed that Lin Shengnan was going to transfer the money. He did not ask much and agreed with a smile.

When they arrived at the Agricultural Bank of China, Xia ruofei did not follow them in. She just sat in the car and waited. After more than ten minutes, Lin Shengnan came out.

She got into the car and said,”I’m done, Mr. Xia. Thank you!”

Xia ruofei grinned and said,”as long as you work hard, that’s the greatest gratitude you can give me!” I’ll leave my girlfriend’s safety in your hands!”

“I will!” Lin Shengnan nodded seriously.

Xia ruofei continued to drive and soon arrived at the headquarters of the lingji F & B. He brought Lin Shengnan directly to the finance department where Ling Qingxue was.

As the manager of the finance department, Ling Qingxue had her own office.

“RUO Fei!” Ling Qingxue was pleasantly surprised to see Xia ruofei. She immediately put down her work and stood up.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Qingxue, let me introduce you. This is Lin Shengnan. I told you two days ago that she will be your assistant from now on.”

“Hello, Shengnan!” Ling Qingxue said with a smile.

Lin Shengnan bowed slightly and said with a hint of respect,””Hello, miss Ling!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you guys continue!” We can get to know each other better so that Qingxue can arrange some work for Shengnan. ”

Ling Qingxue was a little reluctant and asked,””Ruofei, where are you going?”

“I’m going to uncle Ling’s office for a while,”Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Since he was already in the company, it would be inappropriate if he didn’t pay his future father – in – Law a visit.

Xia ruofei continued,”you guys go ahead!” I’ll come over to have dinner with you later. ”

“Alright then!” Ling Qingxue said.

Xia ruofei then turned to Lin Shengnan.”Oh, Shengnan, if I’m with Qingxue in the future, you don’t have to protect her. I’ll be in charge of her safety.”

“Yes, Mr. Xia!” Lin Shengnan nodded.

Lin Shengnan did not raise any doubts. Although she could not see what was so special about Xia ruofei, she was very clear that those who were selected for the lone wolf collective training and passed the hellish test to become official members, or even core members, were definitely not weak.

With Xia ruofei’s protection, Ling Qingxue’s safety was not a concern.

Besides, it wasn’t appropriate for him to be a third wheel when a couple was together.

Xia ruofei nodded at the two girls and left Ling Qingxue’s office. He went straight to Ling Xiaotian’s spacious chairman’s office.

Naturally, the Chairman’s future son – in – Law didn’t need to be informed, so the Secretary let him in directly.

“Uncle Ling!” Xia ruofei laughed.

Ling Xiaotian looked up and immediately took off his reading glasses. He laughed heartily,””RUO Fei is here! Quickly come over and sit!”

Ling Xiaotian instructed his Secretary to serve tea, then asked,””RUO Fei, have you seen Qingxue?”

“I just came from her office.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“What brings you to the office today?” Ling Xiaotian asked, nodding.

“Uncle Ling, I’ve found a female bodyguard and assistant for Qingxue through the leader of the old army. I’ve brought her here today to meet Qingxue.” I think Qingxue’s safety should still be taken seriously. After all, you’re quite wealthy, and if someone were to take the risk and have some evil ideas, the consequences would be unimaginable. ”

Ling Xiaotian looked at Xia ruofei with relief and said,””RUO Fei, I’m very happy that you’re so considerate of Qingxue! I wasn’t thoughtful enough in the past. I really should’ve assigned Qingxue a good bodyguard!”

Ling Xiaotian did not know what had happened at the entrance of the company that day. Otherwise, he would have assigned Ling Qingxue eight to ten bodyguards.

But even so, he still agreed with Xia ruofei’s words. There was no harm in being careful.

The two of them chatted for a while before Xia ruofei asked,””By the way, uncle Ling, the improved Drunken Eight Immortals should be on the market now, right? How’s the Market reaction?” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ling Xiaotian smiled and said,”I’ve been busy with the matter of the designated reception unit. In addition, there’s also a lot of things to do at our hotel. I really didn’t have the time to take care of the winery!” How about ... I give them a call and ask how the sales are?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”there’s no hurry. I’m confident in my product.” Good wine doesn’t fear the depths of the alley!”

“Since you’re here, let’s ask about the situation!” Ling Xiaotian laughed.

With that, Ling Xiaotian stood up and walked to his desk.

At this moment, the Secretary knocked on the door and entered. He bowed and said,””Chairman, manager li from the sales department of Ding Feng winery is here. He said that he has something important to report to you!”
