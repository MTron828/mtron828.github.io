Xia ruofei, Zhou leiyun and the rest walked to the side of the field, and the team’s match officially began.

However, after seeing Xia ruofei’s amazing free kick performance, everyone was more or less distracted. When the assistant coaches were grouping, they even read two names wrong.

If it was a famous star player who showed such footwork, everyone would praise him, but the shock would not be as great. However, Xia ruofei had not even played professional football for a day. He was one of the club owners, but his footwork was better than the team’s main midfield core. How could he let people live?

Ruby accompanied Xia ruofei and Zhou leiyun to the side of the field, while Jiang Xiaochen acted as their translator.

Zhou leiyun said to Xia ruofei,”CEO Xia, I didn’t expect this!” Your ball skills are actually so good! Why didn’t you play professional football in the beginning?”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said with a smile,””I’m just playing for fun, I can’t compare to a professional. And the football environment in the country back then … You should know that not many people were willing to play football as a career. ”Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Zhou leiyun sighed and said,”that’s right!” Don’t look at how the Chinese Super League players are all making a lot of money now. Our country’s football talents are actually very lacking. After a series of shady dealings were exposed back then, there were really not many parents willing to send their children to learn to play football. This is equivalent to a generation being cut off!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s okay, we can wait!” Aren’t there more and more children playing football these days? Now that the Spanish clubs are becoming more and more famous in the country, they will also drive the development of football. The children who are learning to play football now are the future of Chinese football!”

Zhou leiyun nodded.”Our club is also planning to cooperate with our country’s youth training. We hope to select some talented seedlings to enter the Spanish ladder team from a young age. They will be trained in accordance with the mature youth training methods in Europe.”

“For the development of Chinese football, it still has to be based on youth training and the league. Now the league seems to be a bit of a false prosperity, but the youth training really has to be done well.” Xia ruofei said,”I think it’s a good idea to use Europe’s mature youth training system to train a group of football talents for our country. It doesn’t matter even if we have to lose some money.”

“Yup!” Zhou leiyun nodded.

The two of them chatted in low voices, and the match on the field finally began, so everyone turned their attention to the field.

Today’s team competition was not strictly divided according to the main force and substitutes. Basically, the number of main forces and substitutes on both sides was similar. Wu Lei was assigned to the first team wearing the yellow Training Vest, while their opponents were wearing training jerseys directly without a vest.

The match began with the whistle of the assistant coach who was acting as the referee.

Ruby and the other coaches also perked up and looked at the field. In addition to keeping the players ‘game sense, this kind of game was also a good opportunity for the coaches to observe the players’ competitive state.

After the game started, the fight between the two sides was still quite intense, especially for some fringe players. Many of them had the goal of entering the big list and playing as substitutes first. And whether they could make it into the squad list naturally depended on their condition during training. This kind of match was a very good opportunity to show off.

Moreover, the two major shareholders of the club were also present today, so he had to perform well.

Wu Lei was still playing on the right side, which he was familiar with. However, he did not have many opportunities to get the ball. Many of his teammates did not trust him very much, and his shortcomings in the last game had been exposed.

Sometimes, Wu Lei ran out of a very good gap, but his teammates chose to pass the ball in the other direction. He only played the role of pulling the defensive line.

However, Wu Lei didn’t slack off just because he didn’t have a chance to touch the ball. He still ran with all his might. As long as there was a chance, he would rush to the opening with all his might.

Ruby saw this scene from the sidelines and could not help but secretly nod.

After a few days of observation, Ruby had a better understanding of Wu Lei’s characteristics. The Chinese striker might not have a position in a big team, but he was still valuable in a club like RCD Espanyol. It was not like the mainstream opinion that the transfer was only for commercial purposes.

Ruby’s only concern was Wu Lei’s stamina and ability to fight.

In terms of physical fitness, Wu Lei’s physical fitness was not bad when he was in the Chinese Super League. However, he came directly to La Liga after playing in the Chinese Super League. The cycle of the two leagues was different. The leagues in Europe were all cross – year, which meant that Wu Lei had played a lot more games than other players. His physical reserves were definitely not as good as other players. Moreover, the pace of La Liga was much faster than that of the middle Division, so the physical requirements were naturally higher.

Based on Wu Lei’s physical data in the team, his current physical fitness was not enough to support the whole game.

Needless to say, Wu Lei was the best striker in China. However, because the overall training and management level of Chinese football were not as good as those in Europe, even a striker like Wu Lei’s muscle strength was not up to the standard of European professional football clubs.

This was very obvious in Wu Lei’s first game yesterday.

However, no matter what, Wu Lei’s game attitude was good, and his awareness was also very good. He spared no effort to run like this, and he would definitely get a good opportunity in the game. As long as his ability to grasp opportunities in front of the goal improved a little, there would be no problem in scoring.
