The blue travel immortal sword maintained a relatively constant speed as it flew diagonally upwards. When there were only two steps left and it was about to reach the stone platform, Xia ruofei silently performed the sword technique and the speed of the flying sword suddenly increased.bender

If it was like a car moving slowly in second gear at the beginning, it was now suddenly changing to fifth gear and accelerating instantly.
