Manager Wu said eagerly,”director Xia, the total is 687352 Yuan. Our director Chen has said that we don’t need the small change. You can just give 680000 Yuan!”

Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and said,””This amount doesn’t seem right. Why is it so cheap?”

Now, the retail price of diesel was about 6.5 yuan per liter. 100 tons of it was at least 120000 liters. The cost of diesel alone was nearly 800000 Yuan, and this did not include the transportation cost and the cost of oil barrels.

Manager Wu smiled and said,”President Xia, you’re probably calculating the retail price, right?” Since you’re buying so many at once, of course we’ll pay you at the wholesale price! The wholesale price we give to our major customers is about 6800 Yuan per ton. ”

In fact, how could buying a hundred tons be considered a big customer? This was all because Liu Zhe had personally come out to greet him. Xia ruofei was very clear about this, so he could only say,””I see, thank you ... By the way, I haven’t counted the transportation fee and the oil barrel!”

Manager Wu laughed and said,”director Xia, you’re taking care of our business by buying so much at once. Of course, we’re delivering the goods to our doorstep!” Now, even shipping is included if you buy a bag of rice! As for the oil barrels ... Young master Liu said that you may need to continue to buy diesel in the future, so we’ll lend you these oil barrels. In the next trade, you can just exchange empty barrels for barrels full of oil. ”

Look! How thoughtful was she? Everything had been thought out. This was the magic of power. Furthermore, Liu Zhe had such a high status just because of his father’s identity. No wonder so many people were fighting to become an official, a high – ranking official.

Xia ruofei sighed in his heart and said,””Alright then! Manager Wu, I’ll write you a check!”

Xia ruofei tore off the check and handed it to manager Wu. He then passed it to a subordinate.

This was the financial staff that he had specially brought along.

Even though Liu Zhe had informed manager Wu about this through his connections, he did not dare to be careless when it came to hundreds of thousands of Yuan.

The finance staff checked the check quickly and nodded slightly to manager Wu.

Manager Wu immediately smiled and extended his hand to Xia ruofei.””President Xia, happy working with you!”

“Happy cooperation!”

The stevedores were very efficient. One truck drove out after unloading, and another truck drove in. It took about two hours for all the oil barrels to be unloaded. They were stacked on two floors and took up almost two – thirds of the space in the warehouse.

Xia ruofei waved goodbye to manager Wu. He waited until the car disappeared from his sight before he returned to the warehouse and locked the door from the inside.

He used his mental power to check and made sure that no one was spying on them, so he quickly put all the oil barrels into the space.

The mountain sea realm was now very vast. Although many medicinal gardens and rice fields had been developed, there was still a large piece of land that was idle. Xia ruofei casually found a flat area and placed the oil barrels in a steady and orderly manner.

The space was big enough, so there was naturally no need to stack up several layers.

After doing all this, Xia ruofei opened the warehouse door a little, dashed out, and quickly locked the door. Then, he drove straight to the Yacht Club.

Xia ruofei called Qin Lan as he entered the club. When he arrived at the main building of the club, he saw that Qin Lan was already waiting at the door. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Xia ruofei parked his car on the side of the road and jumped out of the car. He opened the door of the back seat and took out a huge backpack. There were a lot of supplies and equipment in it. Of course, it was just a cover. After all, he would be out at sea for many days. If he came empty – handed, it would easily arouse suspicion.

In fact, most of the supplies that Xia ruofei had prepared were kept in the spirit map space. The amount of supplies was ten times or a hundred times more than what he had in his backpack.

Qin Lan smiled as she walked up to him and greeted him,””Good day, Mr. Xia!”

Xia ruofei nodded at Qin Lan and said,””Manager Qin, I’ll have to trouble you to arrange an electric car to send me to the dock.”

“I’m ready!” Qin Lan smiled and waved her hand. An electric car that was parked at the side drove over.

The driver came over and moved Xia ruofei’s heavy backpack into the car.

Qin Lan insisted on sending Xia ruofei to the dock. Xia ruofei could not reject her and could only nod in agreement.

After a while, the electric car arrived at Xia ruofei’s exclusive berth at the yacht Pier.

Xia ruofei and Qin Lan stood on the dock. Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Manager Qin, let’s say goodbye here! I might stay in the open sea for a few more days this time. It’s rare for me to relax, so I might just stop in a certain Sea area and stay there for a few days. ”

Xia ruofei was just giving them a heads up. After all, he had brought a large amount of fuel with him, so he would definitely be out at sea for a longer time than a normal yacht.

“Then I wish you a good time!” Qin Lan nodded and said. If you need anything, you can contact us through the maritime satellite phone!”

“Alright!”

After Xia ruofei finished speaking, he grabbed his backpack and walked towards the platform.

Qin Lan couldn’t help but ask,”Mr. Xia, are you really not going to consider bringing along a few staff members?” We can take care of each other at sea ...”

Qin Lan had been in contact with many rich people, but it was the first time she had seen someone like Xia ruofei, who insisted on being alone and sailed out to sea alone.

In fact, it was quite dangerous to drive a yacht out to sea alone. The main reason was that if something happened at sea, there was no one to help.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”no need, I’m used to being alone.” Besides, I won’t be going far. I’ll just stroll around the coastal waters. I mainly want to stay at sea for a few days and experience the feeling of sleeping at sea at night. “
