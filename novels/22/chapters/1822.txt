Chapter 1823: Setting off again (1)

Translator: 549690339

In order to welcome Ling Qingxue, Xia ruofei prepared a sumptuous dinner. The ingredients were mostly vegetables and fish from the peach Garden space, as well as abalone cultivated in the space sea.

In addition, Xia ruofei had specially opened a bottle of expensive rotten wine.

Noble rot wine was much sweeter than ordinary white wine, and it was very smooth in the mouth. The two of them had unknowingly finished the entire bottle of wine.

Although Xia ruofei drank more than Ling Qingxue, with his alcohol tolerance, half a bottle of sweet wine with a low alcohol content would not affect him at all. On the other hand, Ling Qingxue’s face flushed cutely after the alcohol hit her. Her eyes also became a little misty.

In front of such a beauty, how could Xia ruofei resist? He didn’t even care about the dishes on the table and directly picked Ling Qingxue up by the waist.

As Ling Qingxue cried out in shock, Xia ruofei waved his hand in the air and the curtains on the first floor of the villa were all drawn. Then, he threw Ling Qingxue on the sofa in the living room and leaned down impatiently ...

For the next few days, Ling Qingxue stayed at the small farm villa.

It was also the first time Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue had enjoyed a life of being together.

Every night, the two of them would fool around and do shameless things without restraint. The living room, bedroom, gym, bathroom, and even the kitchen of the villa were left with the mark of their love. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Of course, other than doing what they both loved to do, Xia ruofei also brought Ling Qingxue to the nearby beach to play. One day, the two of them drove to the beach not far from the farm and lay on the picnic mat, bathing in the warm spring sun while counting the number of planes flying in the sky.

They were not far from San Shan airport. The beach was just below the plane’s flight path. During the landing phase, the plane was at a very low altitude. Xia ruofei could even see the airline logo painted on the tail of the plane.

As long as a man and a woman in love were by each other’s side, their hearts would be filled with happiness. They didn’t care about what they did together or where they went.

Therefore, the two of them enjoyed even something as boring as counting the planes. They stayed on the beach for half a day before driving back to the farm to make lunch.

In terms of food, Xia ruofei also personally cooked every day, preparing different kinds of delicious food for Ling Qingxue.

In just two to three days, Ling Qingxue’s complexion had improved quite a bit.

In fact, it was mainly because he was in a good mood. In addition, he was temporarily free from the heavy pressure of heavy work, so he was a lot more relaxed, so his complexion naturally became better.

Xia ruofei wanted to make it up to Ling Qingxue. After all, he still felt that he owed Ling Qingxue for what happened to Song Wei.

Three days passed in the blink of an eye.

For the past three days, Xia ruofei had not been to the office at all. After Ling Qingxue joined them, he had the intention of “not going to court early in the morning”. Feng Rao and the others also tried not to disturb him. If there was anything that needed Xia ruofei’s decision, he would just call to ask for instructions.

However, today was the official day of the relocation of the peach blossom company headquarters. No matter how lazy Xia ruofei was, he could not continue to stay at home.

Early in the morning, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue finished their breakfast. Ling Qingxue started to clean up the tableware with ease. Now, the two had a clear division of labor. Xia ruofei was in charge of cooking, and Ling Qingxue was in charge of cleaning up the leftovers. This time, Xia ruofei could make a cup of tea and comfortably watch TV for a while.

Xia ruofei said,”Qingxue, our headquarters is moving today. I have to go to the office. Do you want to come with me to watch the show or stay at home?”

Ling Qingxue was already addicted to the life of completely emptying her mind these few days. She said without hesitation,””I’m not going to join in the fun. There’s a drama that’s just five levels away from the final level. I’ll try to finish it by today!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”okay!” We can take the second dose of Chinese medicine today, so we don’t have to rush back and forth!”

“En!” Ling Qingxue nodded and asked,”ruofei, I should be able to start cultivating after taking the medicine today, right?”

It would have been better if Xia ruofei had not told her about cultivation. Now that she knew about it and had witnessed the magical methods of cultivators, more importantly, she knew that one would never age once they reached a certain level of cultivation. This was a great temptation for a beautiful woman! It could be said that the function of retaining one’s youthful looks was almost the driving force behind Ling Qingxue’s cultivation! Therefore, Ling Qingxue was quite anxious about her cultivation.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”if there are no accidents, it should be possible!”

“That’s great!” Ling Qingxue said happily,”you should get back to work! I’ll be waiting for you to come home ...”

Seeing Ling Qingxue acting like a little wife, Xia ruofei’s heart couldn’t help but beat faster. He forcefully suppressed the evil fire in his heart and said,”I might have to eat out at noon. I’ve already prepared the dishes for you. You can heat them up and eat them at noon!”

“I know!” Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but roll her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,”you’re speaking as if I can’t take care of myself!”

Xia ruofei laughed dryly,”I’m just afraid that you don’t know.” This place is too remote, so take – out won’t even be delivered to your door. You have to be self – reliant!”
