Chapter 678: _2

“Okay, okay, okay. It’s too late now. I’ll call the old man tomorrow morning and report to him!” Song Rui said happily,”I’ll give you a definite letter by noon tomorrow at the latest!”

“Alright! “Then let’s go ...” Xia ruofei stood up and said,”why do I feel weird that two men locked their doors and stayed together for so long ...”

“Your mind is too dirty!”

Xia ruofei raised his head and laughed as he walked towards the door.

After a few steps, he stopped and turned back to ask song Rui,””I still don’t understand. Even if general Zhao’s diabetes is quite serious, a high – Level cadre like him should be able to control it very well since he enjoys such good medical treatment. Many high – ranking officers even had an insulin pump with them! Why do I feel like you’re more nervous?”

“Hi!” Song Rui laughed. You’re talking about the local officials! Uncle Zhao is a military officer, and he’s also a commander. This kind of serious illness will affect his political life. Normally, his diabetes is so serious that he must be transferred from his position, so he’s very anxious now!”

“So that’s how it is ... Understood!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll wait for your notice then!”

With that, Xia ruofei opened the door of the tea room and walked out.

When the two of them returned to the private room, the atmosphere in the room was still very harmonious. Fourth brother took good care of everyone and did not neglect anyone. Everyone frequently toasted each other and chatted very enthusiastically.

After Xia ruofei and song Rui returned, the center of attention naturally returned to them.

Everyone was very happy today, and fourth brother wanted to keep the two distinguished guests company. It could be said that he had done everything he could to adjust the atmosphere quite well.

However, it was already very late. Xia ruofei proposed to end the meeting after having a few drinks with everyone.

Song Rui did not have any objections. His social gathering today was not important. If it was not for Xia ruofei, he would have left long ago.

......

He kun, Xue Jinshan, and the others naturally followed Xia ruofei’s lead.

Fourth brother immediately suggested that they start the second half and invite everyone to sing.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,””Little fourth brother, let’s do it next time! I really can’t take it today. I just flew here in the morning and didn’t sleep much at noon. Now I’ve drunk too much and my eyelids are about to fight ...”

Fourth brother laughed and said,”Alright, alright!” Then I’ll treat you to a private meal next time!”

“Then I won’t be polite with you!”

“Hahaha!”

Soon, the group of people arrived outside. Fourth brother sent song Rui off personally. Xia ruofei, he kun, and his Secretary returned to the Rong city hotel. Xue Jinshan and the other two returned to their own hotel.

Fourth brother had even arranged for a car to send Xue Jinshan and the other two off. Xia ruofei expressed his gratitude again.

After sending song Rui off, Xia ruofei beckoned for Xue Jinshan and the other two to come over. He smiled and said,”Kanayama, this matter has been successfully settled. The three of you don’t have to rush back. You can have fun in Beijing for a few days. The company will pay for the expenses!”

“Yay! Long live President Xia!” Bai He clapped her hands happily.

Zhou Qing also revealed a happy smile.

On the contrary, Xue Jinshan said with some difficulty,”President Xia, I’m preparing to book a ticket to go back tomorrow! There was still a lot of work to be done after the project was established! Otherwise, we won’t be able to make it in time when the follow – up preliminary examination begins ...” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Before Xia ruofei could speak, he kun, who was a little tipsy, chuckled and said,””Little Xue! Isn’t the first trial handled by our own people? What do you have to worry about? How dare you disobey President Xia’s instructions?”

Xia ruofei looked at he kun with a smile and then at the two young people who were looking forward to it. He said,””Kanayama, strike a balance between work and rest! You guys stay for two more days! Bring little Bai and little Zhou to all the scenic spots in Beijing!”

Xue Jinshan could only say,”alright! Thank you, President Xia!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”alright, you guys can go back!.”

After that, Xia ruofei got into he kun’s car.

Xue Jinshan and the other two watched the car leave before getting in and leaving. The mood of the three people was different from when they came. At this time, everyone was relaxed, and their hearts were filled with joy.

Back at the Grand Hotel in Rong city, he kun personally sent Xia ruofei to his room. He held Xia ruofei’s hands tightly and said emotionally,””Brother Xia, I’m really blushing this time! I almost screwed up your matter, but in the end, you had to settle it by yourself. And you even helped me out so much ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”brother he, you personally accompanied me to the capital and helped me run the project. I, Xia ruofei, am extremely grateful just for this favor!” Besides, the new drug project is going to be in the preliminary review soon, so I need you to take care of me, big brother!”

“Don’t worry about that!”He kun replied without hesitation. It’ll be much easier when you’re in our Southeast province!”

“Alright, I’m much more at ease now that you’ve said that!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”brother he, you should go back and rest too! You have to be in good spirits when you meet director Zeng tomorrow!”

“Good, good, good! Brother Xia, after tomorrow, let’s have a few more drinks!” He kun quickly said.

He was indeed in a hurry to return to his room. He was not going to take a shower or sleep, but to prepare his report.

The two of them bade each other farewell at the door of the room. Xia ruofei swiped his card into the room, took a shower, and went to bed.

……

The next morning, while Xia ruofei was still in Dreamland, in an apartment in the West of Beijing, song Rui had already gotten out of bed and washed up at the alarm.

Old people usually got up early. Song Rui knew elder song’s living habits very well. He knew that elder song had already gotten up and was taking a walk in the yard at this time, so he could call him immediately.

Sure enough, when he called manager Lu, manager Lu was walking with elder song. When he heard that song Rui had something to say to elder song, manager Lu immediately handed the phone to elder song and said,””Chief, song Rui is looking for you.”

Manager Lu then followed behind elder song from a distance.

“Xiao Rui, is there an emergency for you to call me so early in the morning?” Eccentric song asked indifferently.

“Grandpa, general Zhao Cheng’s body has a little problem. Do you know about it?” Song Rui asked.

“He called me yesterday and reported that the organization might want to adjust his position,” elder song said. There’s nothing we can do about that. The Army has its own rules. We can’t let a general lead the battle with an insulin pump, can we?”

“Grandpa, if that’s the case, our family in the military ...”

“Xiao Rui, don’t get involved in these things!” Elder song said sternly,”when you’re back in the capital, go back to San Shan as soon as possible after you’re done with your company’s matters!”

Song Rui’s neck shrank and he quickly said,””Grandpa, let me finish! Guess who I met in the capital this time? Xia ruofei!”

“Little Xia? He also went to the capital?” Eccentric song was also surprised.

“Hey! This kid went to the Ministry to run a project. ” Song Rui said casually,”in the end, I was bullied by a bunch of officials who failed to recognize Mount Tai. That was called embarrassing! What a coincidence, I’m eating in the private room next door ...”

“What’s going on?”

They were talking about Zhao Cheng, but when it came to Xia ruofei, even elder song didn’t notice that they had strayed from the topic.

It showed how important Xia ruofei was to elder song.

Song Rui then briefly reported the matter to elder song.

After elder song heard this, he helplessly said,””The work style of some departments and ministries is really criticized! The reactions from below were also very strong! I heard that there was once a Deputy Governor who went to a Department to ask to see a Deputy Director, but he was left in the corridor for more than an hour without seeing him!”

“This little Xia ... Why didn’t she come to me when she was in trouble?” What’s there to be embarrassed about?”

“I also criticized him yesterday!” Song Rui quickly said. This kid already knows his mistake ...”

“Forget it, forget it. Since the matter has been resolved, let’s not mention it again.” Elder song waved his hand and said,”Oh right, you suddenly mentioned Xiao Xia. Could it be that Xiao Xia has a way to cure Zhao Cheng’s illness?”

“Yes, I am!” Song Rui said,”I asked him seriously yesterday if diabetes could be cured with traditional Chinese medicine. He said that there should be a way. After hearing about general Zhao’s situation, he also expressed his willingness to treat general Zhao, so I quickly reported this to you this morning.”

“I know.” Elder song nodded and said,”wait for my notice!”
