“Mm! It’s delicious ... And it has a unique taste!” Ling Qingxue said in surprise,”this fish meat is tender and delicious. There is no fishy smell at all, and it even has a faint fragrance ...” Ling Qingxue continued to ask,”ruofei, could this be another grass carp that you’ve developed with your new techniques?” Our Ling Ji restaurant wants to make a reservation!” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”We did use some of the new technology. However, we only kept a small amount. We kept it for ourselves.” “What about the future? Didn’t you clear out the fish pond over there? You have to rear fish, right?” Ling Qingxue didn’t give up easily and continued to ask. “In the future, we should do some aquatic farming, right? However, they might not raise grass carp. ” Xia ruofei shrugged his shoulders and said,”Qingxue, don’t worry! If my Peach Blossom Farm has a new ingredient, I’ll definitely give priority to cooperating with Ling Ji food and beverage, okay?” “That’s more like it! That’s interesting!” Ling Qingxue giggled. “Let’s eat! You’re thinking about work even when you’re eating, aren’t you tired!” Xia ruofei smiled. “Um ... I’ll eat a few more pieces of fish. This fish is too delicious. Don’t snatch it from me!” Ling Qingxue pouted. “Okay, okay, okay, I won’t fight with you ...” Xia ruofei looked at Ling Qingxue with a pampering gaze and said with a smile,”don’t let the fish bones get in your way!” “MMM ...” Ling Qingxue was too busy eating to answer Xia ruofei’s question. Seeing that Ling Qingxue was eating with relish, Xia ruofei’s heart was slightly moved. He found an excuse to get up and go to the kitchen. He quietly took out the spirit map scroll, then connected to the space with his mind. He concentrated his mind on the grass carp in the fish pond in the space. Perhaps it was because he had practiced a few times before, but Xia ruofei was much more skilled now. It did not take long for him to successfully capture four grass carps. Xia ruofei found two small buckets and put two grass carps in each bucket. He poured water into the buckets and kept them in the water. He put one of the buckets back into the medium and went back to the dining room to eat. Naturally, Ling Qingxue was very satisfied with the food. In fact, every time she ate a meal that Xia ruofei made, she was very happy. On one hand, it was because the vegetables in Taoyuan were too delicious. More importantly, it was made by Xia ruofei himself, so it had a special meaning. After the meal, Xia ruofei took the initiative to go to Ling Qingxue’s company to sign the official contract. Ling Qingxue had originally wanted Xia ruofei to take her car there, and even said that she would send him back later. However, other than going to the Ling’s restaurant to sign the contract, Xia ruofei was also planning to visit Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao. Hence, he politely declined Ling Qingxue and decided to drive himself. Ling Qingxue pouted unhappily. However, when Xia ruofei brought out the two grass carp from the kitchen as a gift, she immediately turned from displeasure to joy and became happy again. A girl’s thoughts were sometimes so difficult to guess. Perhaps the two fish were nothing, even if they were extremely delicious. However, the fact that Xia ruofei wanted to give her two fish meant something completely different to her. Xia ruofei called manager li over and exchanged a few words with him. Then, he and Ling Qingxue drove their own cars and left the holiday villa. The two of them drove to the Ling Ji F & B headquarters located in the Nantai District. Ling Qingxue informed her father, Ling Xiaotian, on the way. Ling Xiaotian was also very concerned and personally went to the first floor to welcome her. While they were waiting, Ling Xiaotian kept pacing back and forth in the lobby on the first floor, causing the front desk girl to feel nervous. When she saw that the person Ling Xiaotian was waiting for was actually a young and handsome lad, and this lad was even walking in with the little princess of Ling Ji, chatting and laughing, the fire of gossip in her heart instantly burned. Could he be the Chairman’s future son – in – Law? Naturally, the front desk girl did not know that Ling Xiaotian placed so much importance on it because of the peach blossom vegetables that Xia ruofei had. It was too important to the current Ling Ji restaurant. With the hundred catties of Taoyuan vegetables sold every day, the business of the Ling Ji’s flagship stores skyrocketed. The average turnover was 40% higher than before. Ming Hao restaurant’s rising momentum was suddenly suppressed. In some sense, Xia ruofei was the Savior of their company! Therefore, Ling Xiaotian also fully displayed the importance he placed on this matter. Not only did he personally go downstairs to welcome them, but he also gathered all the company’s employees who were at least of the manager level and above and held a signing ceremony in the company’s big meeting room. Even the staff in charge of the company’s Journal came over with a camera to take pictures and prepare to publish a special issue in the company’s internal Journal. Xia ruofei was not used to such a grand reception. After signing the contract, he declined Ling Xiaotian’s invitation to dinner and left in a hurry. However, Xia ruofei did not go straight to Hu Zi’s mother’s house. Instead, he went to the seed sect’s headquarters. Tao Yuan farm’s construction period would be completed in a month at most. By then, they would have to start large – scale planting. Xia ruofei thought that since he was in the city, he might as well solve the problem of seeds first. When they arrived at the seed company, Xia ruofei picked out more than ten common vegetable seeds on the table. He ordered five kilograms of each. Before he came, he had roughly estimated that these seeds should be enough for the first round of sowing. Xia ruofei had chosen the best seeds and spent five to six thousand Yuan on them. To the seed market department, he was a big customer. Therefore, the manager personally received them with a very warm attitude. After Xia ruofei made the payment, the manager called for a few shop assistants to help Xia ruofei move all the packaged seeds into the pickup truck. Just as Xia ruofei was about to leave, he suddenly had an idea. He turned around and asked,””Manager, do you sell ginseng seeds here?” Xia ruofei had long wanted to plant some valuable things in the realm, but he did not know what was more valuable. However, he knew about ginseng. He had been busy for a while and did not have time to spare. Since he was at the seed company today, Xia ruofei decided to ask about the situation first. The manager was stunned for a moment and then said,””Sir, of course we have ginseng seeds here, but ... This season is not suitable for planting ginseng! Moreover, the survival rate of ginseng is very low, so it’s not easy to artificially plant it ...” Ginseng seeds were not cheap, and the manager had only reminded Xia ruofei out of good intentions. Xia ruofei laughed.”It’s okay. I’ll just buy some and plant them for fun. What’s the best ginseng seed you have here?” “Our company has authentic Changbai Mountain ginseng seeds, but the price ...” The manager said. “The price doesn’t matter, just give me half a catty!” Xia ruofei said without even asking the price. “Alright! Please wait a moment!” The manager quickly said. After a while, Xia ruofei left the seed company with a sealed plastic bag full of ginseng seeds. This half a catty of seeds cost him more than 600 Yuan, which was not cheap. However, Xia ruofei naturally did not care about this small amount of money. Once these ginseng seeds were successfully planted in the origin space, the benefits would be more than ten times or even a hundred times! Xia ruofei drove the pickup truck out of the seed company and came to a place with no one around. He parked the car and went to the back of the truck. He climbed into the back of the truck and fixed the cover on the back of the pickup truck. As long as one did not stick their head in to take a look, they would not be able to see what was going on inside the truck. Xia ruofei kept all the vegetable and ginseng seeds into the spirit map space. Then, he took out the other small bucket with the grass carp and some paradise vegetables and placed them in the trunk. Then, Xia ruofei returned to the driver’s seat and continued to drive straight to Hu Zi’s mother’s house in the forestry Bureau. [PS] I’ll be on Sanjiang recommendation this week.
