Xia ruofei left the new space, took his wallet, and went downstairs. He drove the pickup truck straight to the county. He found a Yonghui supermarket and bought a few bags of milk powder. At the same time, he also bought five or six bags of dog food that was one kilogram in weight. Then, he went to the meat section on the first floor and bought dozens of kilograms of beef and mutton. Xia ruofei threw all these things into the pickup truck and drove back. On the way, Xia ruofei found a deserted place and stopped the car. He took out the spirit map scroll and kept all the things he had bought into the original space. Then, he continued to drive back to the farm. He parked his car in the yard of the villa. Lin Qiao was playing with lightning in the yard. When she saw Xia ruofei, she immediately called out,””Brother ruofei, you left me behind and sneaked out to play again! I was wondering why there was no one in the room!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I didn’t go play.” I just went out to do something ... Besides, didn’t I promise to take you to the temple fair this afternoon?” “Then you’re not allowed to sneak away in the afternoon!” Lin Qiao said. “Don’t worry!” Xia ruofei chuckled.”But I’ll have to take a nap first. Shall we release it at 2:30?” “Still taking an afternoon nap?” “Nonsense! You naturally woke up late in the morning, but I woke up early in the morning!” Xia ruofei yawned exaggeratedly and said,”I’m so sleepy ...” “Alright, alright!” Lin qiaojiao pouted and said,”what a big lazy worm ...” She even made a cute face at Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and shook his head. He locked the car door and entered the villa. Hu Zi’s mother had already prepared lunch. When she saw that Xia ruofei had returned, she called him over to eat with her. The four of them sat around the dining table and ate lunch. They could already start eating meat for lunch. There were still many dishes left from yesterday’s New Year’s Eve dinner, and they wouldn’t go bad in the winter. Hu Zi’s mother heated them up and then made two new green dishes. Everyone also ate with relish. Lin Qiao kept pestering Xia ruofei while eating, asking him if there was anything fun to do at the temple fair. Xia ruofei had not really shopped much, so he could not say anything. He could only say that she would experience it herself in the afternoon. After lunch, Xia ruofei immediately used the excuse of taking a nap and quickly went upstairs under Lin Qiao’s disdainful gaze. As soon as he returned to his bedroom, Xia ruofei immediately locked the door and drew the curtains. Then, he summoned the spirit map space from his palm and entered the original space. Xia ruofei laid a plastic sheet on the ground and placed the sliced beef and mutton on it. Then, he found a Big Basin, opened two big bags of dog food, and poured them all into the basin. Then, Xia ruofei found a shallow basin and used the spatial spirit pond to fill it with milk. He even dripped a few drops of the flower petal solution into it. Xia ruofei’s love for the black puppy was evident from this. The seven puppies had only dripped a few drops of milk. After he was done, Xia ruofei considered that the black puppy’s intelligence was definitely not as good as lightning ‘S. He was worried that it would break the precious things in the space. So after a moment’s thought, he went to the vegetable field and found some bamboo poles. Previously, he had used them to plant vegetables and set up many shelves. Now that the scale of the planting had been reduced, many bamboo poles had been left idle. Xia ruofei cut the bamboo poles into sections that were half a meter long and formed a small fence. Although it was not very high or strong, it was enough to restrict the black puppy’s movements. After everything was done, Xia ruofei had an idea and went to the new space from the original space. The puppies were minding their own business. The six puppies had drunk a lot and were playing with each other. On the other side, the little black dog was also full and was lying on the ground to rest! It was mainly because the distance between the two sides was quite far. The little black dog, who had “eaten and drunk” its fill, was probably too lazy to fight with its few brothers. Xia ruofei walked over and picked up the black puppy. He smiled and said,””Let’s go, let’s go. I’ll take you to a good place!” Although the Black Dog did not understand Xia ruofei’s words, it had drunk the milk that Xia ruofei had given it. Furthermore, the milk had a small amount of flower petal solution mixed in it. Hence, it was much smarter than the average dog. At least it knew that Xia ruofei was not hostile to it. Hence, the black puppy did not resist Xia ruofei and obediently snuggled in his arms. With a thought, Xia ruofei brought the black puppy from the new space to the original space. He strolled toward the fence that had just been built and said as he walked,””During this period of time, you should stay here obediently. If you’re hungry, eat by yourself. This is a buffet! Milk, dog food, and meat are all prepared. Eat whatever you want, just don’t overeat!” Xia ruofei lowered the black puppy to the fence. The fence had a diameter of about three meters, which was enough for a small dog. Probably because it had just eaten its fill, the little black dog was not very interested in the food inside the fence. It only went over to sniff at it lightly before walking away. Xia ruofei stood outside the fence and looked at the black puppy. He said,””Right, I still have to give you a name! Your senior was also a Black Dog. I wanted to call him little black, but he didn’t like it and insisted on calling it lightning. I think I’ll call you little black from now on! Do you have a different opinion?” The black puppy listened to Xia ruofei’s long – winded speech and stared at him with its black eyes. However, it obviously did not understand what Xia ruofei was talking about and only barked twice. “No objections, then it’s decided. From now on, you’re little black!” Xia ruofei said. He shamelessly gave little black this name when it was unable to object. Xia ruofei went to the new space and named the other six puppies. However, they were treated worse than Blackie. Xia ruofei was too lazy to think and just called them fluffy one, fluffy two ... Until fluffy six. He also remembered certain characteristics of the puppy. For example, the one with a black right ear was called Da Mao, the one with a pure white tail was called er Mao, and so on. Xia ruofei then left the medium. After taking a short nap in his room, he got up and brought Lin Qiao to the county to visit the temple fair. Lin Qiao was in high spirits and hummed songs along the way. She was like a child who had not grown up at the temple fair and was fascinated by everything she saw. However, she was also very sensible. Throughout the whole shopping trip, she saw more than she bought. Sometimes, Xia ruofei saw something she liked and wanted to buy it for her, but she kept rejecting it, thinking it was a waste of money. Xia ruofei didn’t have anything to do, so he accompanied Lin Qiao and let her have a good time. Before returning to the farm, Xia ruofei brought Lin Qiao to the county hospital to give the ointment for bruises he had concocted to Cao tieshu and his wife. He also reminded them to apply the ointment daily. Cao tieshu and his wife said many words of gratitude, and Cao tieshu told Xia ruofei that not long after he left, the Public Security Bureau sent ten thousand Yuan to them for treatment. They even very politely said that if they used up the money, they had to call immediately and they would send it over. Xia ruofei was not surprised. After chatting with them for a while, he drove back to the villa in Taoyuan farm with Lin Qiao.
