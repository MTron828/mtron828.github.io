3208 Flying in the sky and Embracing the Moon (1)

“It seems like it’ll be really difficult to get to the moon!” Chen Nanfeng said with a worried expression.

Picking the stars and summoning the moon was undoubtedly something that only the legendary mighty figures could do. Chen Nanfeng was a late – Stage golden core cultivator and was still a step away from the nascent Soul Stage. However, compared to those mighty figures who could fly in the sky and burrow underground, there was still a huge gap.

Chen Nanfeng thought of Xia ruofei’s “master”. If his deduction was correct, the Grandmaster of the star Seizer sect, senior Chi Yun, was already a primordial soul Stage cultivator more than 500 years ago. If he was still alive, he might have already reached the leaving aperture stage.

Chen Nanfeng could not even begin to imagine such a cultivation base. He felt that a leaving aperture stage mighty figure might be able to reach the moon.

So, Chen Nanfeng looked at Xia ruofei and asked,””Fellow Daoist Xia, do you have any way to overcome these difficulties?”

In Chen Nanfeng’s opinion, among all of them, perhaps only Xia ruofei could come up with a solution. The others, including Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha, were not even as strong as him. They could not possibly have any good solutions.

Mu Sheng and the others thought so too, so they all looked at Xia ruofei with hope. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Of course, they did not think that the young Xia ruofei had such abilities. They were just full of respect and anticipation for the “master” behind Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei could not help but smile bitterly.

“To be honest,” he said after a moment of silence,”my master has never mentioned anything about the moon to me. I guess this is the first time the token has been cracked. My master doesn’t know that the secret of the token is related to the moon ...”

Everyone nodded their heads thoughtfully.

This was easy to understand. If someone had solved the secret of the token earlier, the Legend of the Five sages token would not have spread so far. Moreover, everyone was very clear about the process of solving the floating point pattern. If it was not for the help of a supercomputer, even the mighty people of the primordial spirit stage and the leaving aperture stage would not be able to complete it in their lifetime if they tried to eliminate all the possibilities. Hence, it was normal that Xia ruofei’s master did not know the specific information contained in the token.

Xia ruofei continued,”as for going to the moon, I’m afraid it’s impossible to ask master for help.” He’s always the one looking for me, and I can’t find him if I take the initiative. “It’s been a few days since the music pieces have been selected. If the old man wanted to help, he would have appeared a long time ago. Now that he hasn’t come to me, it means that he won’t interfere in this matter. Perhaps ... This is also a form of training for me by the old man!”

Xia ruofei’s words were reasonable, and no one had any doubts.

On the contrary, everyone was even more in awe of Xia ruofei’s master. In the eyes of Chen Nanfeng, the number one cultivator in the world of cultivation, this was a hell – Level mission. He was actually at ease and used it to train his disciple. This was the demeanor of an expert!

Mu Sheng sighed and said,””It seems like it’s impossible to take a shortcut. We can only rely on ourselves!”

“Mm! Let’s discuss if there’s any other way!” Chen Nanfeng said,”even if it’s dangerous, we must complete this moon trip!”

Chen Xuan, who had been silent all this while, suddenly spoke up,””Father, seniors, fellow cultivators, do you think it’s possible for us to go to the moon by boat?”

“We still don’t know if the flying boat can fly in outer space as fellow Daoist Xia said,” Chen Nanfeng said.”In addition ... The problem of breathing is still not solved.”

Cultivators could reduce the need for oxygen through internal breathing. It was generally not a problem to hold it for half an hour or an hour. However, a one – way journey would take more than ten days. It was impossible to not breathe. This was also an obstacle that could not be bypassed.

Xia ruofei had been quietly listening to everyone. When he saw Chen Nanfeng talking about breathing, he said,””Seniors, the problem of breathing can perhaps be solved with modern technology.”

Chen Xuan’s eyes lit up upon hearing this.””Brother Xia, are you talking about the kind of clothes that astronauts wear?”

Xia ruofei nodded.”To be precise, it’s an EVA suit. Although it’s a little heavy, it can be very useful.” “Astronauts are just ordinary people. After they put on the spacesuits, they can be directly exposed to space because of the protection of the spacesuits. It can pressure the interior of the spacesuits to maintain normal air pressure, and it can also provide oxygen. Some of them even have jet spray devices. In fact, it’s a small aircraft.”

Chen Nanfeng, Mu Sheng, and the others naturally did not understand this knowledge. They also felt that it was unbelievable that these ant – like ordinary people could solve a problem that even cultivators could not solve.

However, when they thought of the floating point pattern on the token, which was cracked by the Super computer invented by ordinary people, everyone felt relieved.

Sometimes, modern technology could really play a role that even cultivators couldn ‘t.

Xia ruofei looked at Chen Nanfeng and the rest, then added with a smile,””In fact, these ordinary people have successfully landed on the moon in the 1960s. They relied on modern technology.”

Chen Nanfeng and the others were even more shocked when they heard this. Liu Mansha couldn’t help but say,”” 70 to 80 years ago, ordinary people already landed on the moon?”
