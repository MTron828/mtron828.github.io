Translator: 549690339

Unexpectedly, Liu Qian giggled and said,”You don’t have to look at me like that. Actually, I don’t know what the prize is, nor do I know what big news President Xia is going to announce. Every word I said was written on the cue card! I’m more interested in the details than any of you!”

The employees laughed when they heard that. The tense atmosphere suddenly became relaxed.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. He found that Liu Qian was very suitable to host such an Annual Meeting. She was very relaxed on stage and was good at adjusting the rhythm.

Liu Qian continued,”in order to prepare for tonight’s Annual Meeting, the colleagues from all departments of the company have carefully prepared programs. While everyone is tasting the food, they can also enjoy the wonderful programs of their colleagues!” Now, let’s invite the staff of the pharmaceutical factory to bring us a C – Li C – li dance!”

In the midst of the applause, ten employees of paradise pharmaceutical factory walked onto the stage. They were wearing the pharmaceutical factory’s uniform, but when the magical “Panama” song started playing, the ten employees immediately started dancing in unison.

This song was sung by a Romania singer. Recently, it had been choreographed online and made into a video that was posted on some Short Video platforms. It went viral very quickly.

The rhythm was very light, the dance was very simple, and the melody was full of magic. It could be said that it was suitable for both young and old, and it became the divine song of the new generation without any suspense.

It could be seen that the staff of the pharmaceutical factory had rehearsed seriously. Although their expressions were a little reserved, their dance moves were on point, and their steps were very accurate, so their movements were also quite neat.

After the dance, the atmosphere of the annual staff party became even more lively.

At this time, Liu Qian also came up to the stage, leaving the lead dancer who was about to leave.

Liu Qian did a short impromptu interview on the spot. The lead dancer was called Jiang Xiaojuan, born after the 90s. She first learned today’s program online, then taught it to her co – workers and took them to rehearse together.

Liu Qian asked Jiang Xiaojuan to stay on the stage, then said with a smile,”Dear colleagues, today’s first round of the lucky draw has arrived. I suggest that we let Jiang Xiaojuan draw for everyone, what do you think?”

“Alright!”

“No problem!”

“Beauty, you have to pick me!”

The staff answered one after another, and they all began to look forward to it.

Liu Qian blinked and said,”I’ve finally gotten a new teleprompter card. Let’s see what the first prize is.”

As she spoke, she slowly unfolded the teleprompter card with a very nervous expression on her face.

This scene made everyone laugh. Everyone knew that even if Liu Qian did not know what Xia ruofei was going to announce, as the host of the party, she would definitely know what the prize was.

Liu Qian was only acting to adjust the atmosphere.

Although her acting was a little exaggerated, everyone was quite happy to see it.

Liu Qian looked at it and quickly closed the cue card, then said,””The first batch of prizes to be drawn will be tonight’s sixth prize! There are a total of 50 winners, and we will first invite Jiang Xiaojuan to pick 10 lucky ones!”

“Oh ... I think I forgot to see what the prize is ...” Liu Qian patted her head and said.

Everyone burst into laughter, and several employees who were more familiar with Liu Qian couldn’t help but cheer.

“Liu Qian, you’re such a drama queen!”

“You’re addicted to acting!”

“General assistant Liu! Stop acting! Your mom is calling you home for dinner!”

“Hahaha ...” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Liu Qian wasn’t affected at all. She carefully opened the cue card and quickly glanced at it before saying,”Amazing, it’s just the sixth prize and there’s ... A kyokuboku shopping center E – Card worth 3000 Yuan! Then what about the fifth, fourth, and third prize ... And even the special prize? I’m really looking forward to it ...”

After Liu Qian revealed the answer, the staff were also very excited.

The kyokuboku E – Card was actually a shopping card that could be used in full at kyokuboku shopping mall. Kyokuboku shopping mall was already the second – best e – commerce company, and they had a rich variety of goods, especially for their own businesses. Not only was the logistics fast, the quality was good, and the after – Sales quality was also very high. Therefore, this 3000 Yuan kyokuboku E – Card was worth 3000 Yuan.

This was only the sixth prize, and there were already 50 winners, which was definitely a huge sum of money. After all, there were only about 300 people in the entire paradise Corporation.

Liu Qian personally brought the lucky draw box up and placed it on the small stage in the middle of the stage. Then she said to Jiang Xiaojuan,””Xiaojuan, please help us draw 10 lottery tickets!”

Jiang Xiaojuan nodded and nervously reached into the lottery box. After stirring it a few times, she pulled out a lottery ticket and put it on the tray next to the lottery box.

Then, she did the same thing. Before each draw, she would mess up the lottery tickets in the box and quickly pulled out all ten lottery tickets.

“Alright, let’s give a round of warm applause to thank Xiao Juan again!” Liu Qian said.

Jiang Xiaojuan left the stage amidst the applause, while Liu Qian began to announce the winning numbers.

“No. 012! Number 213! “No. 162 ...” Liu Qian announced the winning number while showing the secondary ticket in her hand to the camera.

The camera gave a close – up shot, and everyone could clearly see the lottery ticket number on the big screen.

The employees who were called all walked up to the stage happily.

Among the first ten sixth – Prize Winners, eight of the employees were present, and two of the winners were on duty at the Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory.

In terms of probability, this was a more reasonable result.

Liu Qian also made a special live link and video – connected with the staff outside the venue who won the prize, so that everyone could interact with each other.

The worker who won the prize was also very surprised. When he heard that he had won an E – Card worth 3000 Yuan, he thought that he had won the annual meeting’s grand prize and was quite excited. The employees who knew the situation couldn’t help but laugh.

Later, when the worker found out that his 3000 Yuan E – Card was only the sixth prize, he didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. However, he quickly realized that the sixth prize was a 3000 Yuan E – Card. What kind of grand prizes were those? Therefore, he quickly expressed his gratitude to the company’s leader.

After the connection ended, the second program began immediately.

This was a female choral performance brought by the beautiful women of the marketing department, which also won the hall.

After the performance, Liu Qian asked one of the employees to stay as usual and began the second round of the lucky draw.

“In the second round of the lucky draw, we’ll first draw ten sixth – Prize Winners with 3000 Yuan E – cards and five fifth – Prize Winners. We have a total of 20 fifth prize winners, and they will be drawn in batches ...”

The lucky draw segment for this year’s Annual Meeting was the highlight. The team in charge of the preparations for the annual meeting had discussed it many times and finally decided not to use the conventional procedure of starting from the lowest – Level prize and finishing the draw in one go.

This was because it would lead to a large number of people who won the prize, but the attraction was relatively low. When it came to the grand prize, although the attraction of the prize was great, the probability of winning was very low, causing everyone’s psychological gap.

Therefore, after some discussion, the final plan was to draw the various awards alternately, roughly following the order from the lowest to the highest.

That was why they had made such an arrangement.

“Lu Meimei will draw the sixth prize for the second batch of 10 winners, and then we will ask manager Luo from the e – commerce Group to draw the fifth prize for the first batch of 5 winners.” Liu Qian said,”let’s invite manager Luo on stage!”

After Luo Xing went on stage, he walked straight to Liu Qian and took her microphone,””General assistant Liu, on behalf of the colleagues in the audience, I would like to ask you something. You’ve been blabbering for so long, what exactly is this fifth prize?”

Liu Qian was stunned for a moment, and then she said in a daze,”I didn’t say that just now?”

Everyone burst into laughter.

“Alright! Liu Qian said,”let’s see ... The fifth prize is ...”
