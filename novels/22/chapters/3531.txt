Chapter 3532: The banquet (1)

Translator: 549690339

Wu Qiang was stunned for a moment. Although Xia ruofei did not spend much time in the capital, Wu Qiang still had some understanding of Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei did not put on airs and was very gentle to everyone. Under normal circumstances, if there were guests, even if Xia ruofei could not make it home in time, he would let Wu Qiang and the others welcome the guests into his house first.

He didn’t expect Xia ruofei to ask him to give a simple message so casually and nothing else. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

However, Wu Qiang was only stunned for a moment before he immediately replied,””Alright! I’ll pass on the message immediately!”

After Xia ruofei hung up, he continued to drive. Half an hour later, he arrived at the song family’s old house.

Elder song usually lived in the old residence, so the security level here was very high. There were no other private houses in the area around the old residence, but there were some buildings used by security guards. There were already sentries with loaded guns at the intersection about a kilometer away from the old residence.

However, Xia ruofei’s car and himself had already been registered at the security Office. Hence, Xia ruofei only did a simple parking registration at the intersection. Of course, the guards still checked the vehicle meticulously to make sure that there were no other unrelated people or dangerous items, and then they let them through.

Xia ruofei drove the car and arrived at the song family’s antique – looking old house with ease.

In fact, when Xia ruofei entered the intersection, the guard had already called the on – call room of the old residence. So, before Xia ruofei’s car even stopped, he saw elder song’s personal secretary, manager Lu, coming up to him with a smile.

Xia ruofei quickly parked the car and got out.

“Manager Lu, I’m so scared that you came out to welcome me personally!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Manager Lu laughed and said,”President Xia, you’re an important guest. Isn’t it only right for me to come out and welcome you?” If I don’t pick you up personally, the chief will criticize me for being insensible.”

“Manager Lu, you’re being too serious!” Xia ruofei said.

He had been in contact with the song family for a long time, so he knew manager Lu’s position in the family. His administrative rank was obvious. If he were to be placed in a local area, he would definitely be a high – ranking official. The key was that manager Lu had worked for elder song for many years. When elder song was in the office, he was the head of the Office. Even after he retired, manager Lu still followed elder song and was responsible for his safety. It could be said that manager Lu was not only elder song’s subordinate, but more like family.

Therefore, manager Lu came to welcome Xia ruofei personally. It showed how much the song family valued Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei continued to ask,”manager Lu, is the chief at home?” 1 don’t know if I’m disturbing the old man’s rest?”

Elder song was a big Shot. Even though he had retired, it was not easy for ordinary people to meet him. Even if some big leaders wanted to visit, they had to call in advance to confirm their schedule. Xia ruofei was probably the only one who came without informing.

Manager Lu chuckled and said,”the Bureau chief has been at home recently!” President Xia, you haven’t come to visit the chief in a long time! If the Bureau chief knew that you were here, he would be so happy! How could I possibly disturb the old man?”

Manager Lu’s office was near the duty room. He received the notice immediately and came out to welcome them without reporting to Master Song.

Of course, this was also because it was Xia ruofei. Manager Lu knew very well that he didn’t need to report Xia ruofei’s arrival and could just lead him in.

“How’s the chief’s health recently?” Xia ruofei asked again.

“I’m fine!” Manager Lu chuckled and said,”the Bureau chief has praised you many times, saying that you are also good at health care. It is all thanks to you that his body can be so strong!”

“That’s because the chief has a good foundation …” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”manager Lu, please wait a moment. I’ve brought some gifts for the chief in the trunk.”

“I’ll get someone to get it!” Manager Lu quickly said.

It wasn’t just Master Song and his family who lived in the old house. There were also many security staff, including internal guards, drivers, chefs, and so on. So, manager Lu didn’t say anything and two staff members immediately ran over.

Xia ruofei said,”no need, no need!” Manager Lu, there aren’t many things, I can carry them myself!”

After that, he opened the trunk of the van and took out some gifts he had prepared for elder song. He politely declined the help of the staff.

Manager Lu saw that the items were not heavy and gestured to the two staff members to leave. He then personally accompanied Xia ruofei to the inner residence.

“Chief, you should be reading some documents at this time,” manager Lu said as they walked.”Let’s go to the study room directly!”

Although elder song had retired many years ago, a leader of his level still enjoyed the same treatment as his counterpart. Many documents would be copied and sent to him. He had always been concerned about the country’s development, so he would take time every day to read the documents and understand the country’s general policies and domestic and international developments. This was an almost unshakeable program that would be retained..
