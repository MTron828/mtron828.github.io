2139 The strange white fog (2)

The three women got up in a hurry and left the wooden house as if they were escaping.

Xia ruofei threw Puyol on the ground and waved his hand. The two doors of the wooden house closed on their own.

Puyol’s eyes almost popped out when he saw this. He stuttered,””My Lord, are you ... Are you an immortal from the East?”

“I’m the one interrogating you now,” Xia ruofei said indifferently.”All you have to do is answer my questions honestly!”

“Yes, yes, yes ...” Puyol said quickly. He hesitated for a moment, then mustered up his courage and asked,”great divine immortal, I’ll tell you everything I know and cooperate with you. But ... Can you ... Can you take me out of here?”

Xia ruofei looked at Puyol with a faint smile and asked,””Aren’t you Living a Good Life here? No one would dare to disobey your will, just like the Emperor ...”

Puyol smiled bitterly and said,”Lord deity, if we can return to the land, who would be willing to be the king of this damn place?” So what if they conquered the entire Island? I ... I haven’t had a can of Coke in eight years! I’m wearing the best clothes on the island, you’ve seen it ...”

After saying that, Puyol laughed at himself.

Xia ruofei took out a can of Coke from his backpack and threw it to pjoll.

Puyol subconsciously caught the coke and was stunned.

He felt that he was already Xia ruofei’s prisoner, so he naturally did not dare to expect anything from Xia ruofei’s bag. Of course, he also did not think that Xia ruofei would really give him a Coke.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”this game is only worth a few dollars outside ...”

Puyol was stunned for a moment, and then he figured out that the “immortal” in front of Yingying had such amazing means, so how could he be trapped on a deserted island?

In his eyes, Coke from the outside world was worth a lot, but in the other party’s eyes, it was only worth a few dollars.

Xia ruofei said,”tell me about your experience first!” Then, I’ll ask you some questions. If your answers satisfy me, I’ll even take you away from here, let alone Cola ...”

Puyol’s eyes immediately revealed a strong desire, and he didn’t hesitate to spill the beans.

In fact, his experience was similar to Xia ruofei’s guess. He had been stranded on this deserted island for eight or nine years. He had been on this Island for a long time and could not calculate the exact time.

At that time, Puyol had been a wrestling athlete. He had participated in a wrestling exhibition match on a cruise ship and had unfortunately encountered a sea disaster.

There were about 700 to 800 people on the cruise ship, but only a few dozen survived in the end. Puyol had grabbed a piece of a ship’s deck fragment and floated in the sea for two days. He was lucky to encounter a lifeboat on the cruise ship, and there were about 20 people on the lifeboat.

After he was pulled up by the people on the lifeboat, he drifted on the sea with everyone for another three days. The food and water on the lifeboat were almost exhausted.

It was at this time that they encountered a heavy fog.

After passing through the thick fog, they found the small island.

When Xia ruofei heard this, he couldn’t help but interrupt Puyol and ask,””Fog? Can you describe the situation in detail?”

Although Puyol was curious as to why Xia ruofei was interested in the fog, he quickly said,””It was noon, the sea was calm, and the weather was very clear, but within a few minutes, the area we were in was filled with a thick white fog. It was a very strange scene ... We felt a little scared, so we rowed hard, and then ... After a few minutes, the fog dissipated by itself, and we saw this Island! I swear to God, the view on the sea was very good at that time. Before the thick fog came up, we didn’t see any small island at all ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but take a deep breath. The scene described by Puyol was almost exactly the same as what he had encountered today.

Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat. He asked,””Puyol, do you remember which Sea area your cruise ship was sailing in when the accident happened?”

Puyol shook his head.”I don’t know the exact location ... I only know that the cruise ship set off from Lisbon, Portugal, and its destination was Iceland. We sailed for two days before we encountered a Superstorm. The cruise ship quickly capsized ...”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei could not help but feel a storm in his heart. No matter where the specific location of Puyol’s shipwreck was, from the starting point and destination, the cruise ship must have been sailing in the North Atlantic!

Xia ruofei was sure that before he encountered the White fog, he had not left the territory of the East China Sea.

They were practically half the earth apart!

There must be something wrong. Either Puyol and the rest had been “teleported” from the North Atlantic to the East Sea for some unknown reason, or Xia ruofei was actually in the North Atlantic now.

Of course, there was another possibility. This deserted island was neither in the North Pacific nor the East China Sea.

No matter which possibility it was, Xia ruofei had a feeling that it had something to do with the strange white fog.

However, this was beyond Xia ruofei’s ability. He knew that even if he cracked his head, he would not be able to figure out the answer.

Thus, he decisively put this question aside and said indifferently,””I know, Puyol, continue ...”

Hence, Puyol continued to narrate his experience.

After discovering this deserted island, the survivors, who had almost exhausted all their supplies, naturally seemed to grab onto a life – saving straw and desperately rowed the lifeboats to the island.

What happened next was nothing special. This was a deserted island in the middle of the ocean. More than 20 survivors were stranded on the deserted island. All the laws and standards of a civilized society lost their effect here. Puyol, who had the strongest martial strength, naturally became the ruler.

The island wasn’t too small, and it had fresh water, some small beasts, and tropical fruit trees. All the survivors had survived, except for a few who were killed by pyol during the fight for survival resources.

Of course, they didn’t give up on returning to human society. In the first few years, they arranged for people to watch from a high vantage point 24 hours a day, hoping to find passing ships. At the same time, they set up SOS signals on the beach and lit bonfires, but to no avail. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

For a few years, not a single ship or plane had passed by this place, so Puyol and the others gradually gave up. They had a faint feeling that the location of this deserted island was far away from the normal ship routes. As time passed, they also knew that the possibility of being rescued was very low, so they gradually lived here in peace and gradually formed a structure similar to that of a rough stone society.

Puyol was undoubtedly the king. He enjoyed all the resources first. The three women among the survivors all became his women, and they even gave birth to his children.

However, the conditions on the island were too bad, and almost all the children died. Only a girl born last year had survived, but she was severely malnourished.

After Xia ruofei heard this, he pondered for a while and asked the question that he was most interested in.””Puyol, did you experience something on the island that caused your power to increase significantly?”

Upon hearing this, Puyol immediately said,”great deity, nothing can escape your eyes!” Yes, I was only slightly stronger than them, but the experience seven years ago gave me unparalleled strength!”

Speaking of this, Puyol seemed to have thought of the huge gap between him and Xia ruofei. He could not help but laugh.”Of course, in front of the divine immortal Lord, my little bit of power is naturally not worth mentioning ...”

Xia ruofei frowned and said,””Get straight to the point! What did you experience seven years ago?”

He was very sure that Puyol’s body contained true energy. This was also one of the important reasons why he did not rush to search for the world stone according to the White realm Fox’s request.

The strange white fog, the possible existence of a world stone, and a Caucasian who had cultivated true Qi ... This Island was becoming more and more mysterious in Xia ruofei’s eyes.

There was a saying in the Army that one should not fight an unprepared war.

Xia ruofei was very clear that he had to be very careful at this time. If he was more careful at this critical moment, he might be able to save his life!
