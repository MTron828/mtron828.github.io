Doctor li hesitated for a moment, then said,””Director Guo, it’s nothing. I can give the star of Hong Kong general anesthesia without any problem! We can do it immediately!”

“Doctor li,” said Guo Hongjiang with a slight frown,”if you have any difficulties, just say it. Why are you hesitating?”

It would have been better if doctor li had not said it, but he swallowed it back halfway, making Guo Hongjiang feel even more uncomfortable.

“Director Guo, I was just thinking. I was going to say that general anesthesia is not good for a top – tier horse, and it might affect its performance. But ...’Star of Hong Kong’ should be fine ...” Doctor Li said with a bitter smile.

After the horse’s leg was fractured, they were ready to euthanize it. Even if Guo Hongjiang asked Xia ruofei to try it once, it was just a last resort.

Even if Xia ruofei could create a miracle this time, the “star of Hong Kong” would probably not be able to return to the competition. He was lucky to be able to retire after such a serious injury.

Guo Hongjiang’s face showed a hint of sadness. He nodded and said,””You should get ready as soon as possible! Don’t let Mr. Xia wait too long ...”

“Understood!” Doctor Li said quickly.

He nodded to Xia ruofei and started to prepare the medicine with his assistant.

With Xia ruofei’s comforting words, the star of Hong Kong was very cooperative during the anesthesia. It did not struggle at all. After a while, it slowly closed its eyes and fell into a coma.

Doctor li went up to check and nodded to Xia ruofei.””Mr. Xia, that’s enough ...”

Xia ruofei nodded and walked to the “star of Hong Kong”.

Everyone was standing not far away, staring at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei calmly pressed on the horse’s leg that was obviously twisted after the star of Hong Kong was injured. Then, he held the upper part of the horse’s leg with one hand and the lower part of the leg with the other. He decisively twisted and pushed it back. The whole movement was very fast and clean. There was no sloppiness at all.

Xia ruofei’s bone – setting technique shocked everyone. He was so decisive that he could have broken the horse’s leg if he was not careful.

Especially MA Xiong. He knew Xia ruofei’s condition very well. He knew that Xia ruofei only knew Chinese medicine and had never heard of Xia ruofei being a veterinarian. If he didn’t even know the bone structure of a horse’s leg, how could he set the bone?

To MA Xiong’s relief, the star of Hong Kong’s injured leg was no longer twisted after Xia ruofei’s reckless treatment. Although the swelling was still very serious, it showed that Xia ruofei had successfully set his leg.

Xia ruofei did not remove his hand immediately after he had set the bone back in place. Instead, he continued to feel around the wound for a while before he finally heaved a sigh of relief and stood up.

“Mr. Xia, have you fixed the star of Hong Kong’s bone?” doctor li asked immediately.

After the previous incident, doctor li did not dare to suspect Xia ruofei anymore. His tone had also become very polite.

Xia ruofei nodded slightly and walked straight to the bowl of ointment that he had spent more than an hour to make.

“Mr. Xia, we have a portable X – ray device here. Should we check the effect of reduction ...” Doctor li immediately said.

After saying that, doctor li immediately realized something and quickly explained,””Mr. Xia, please don’t misunderstand. I’m not doubting your ability, I just want to be safe ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”No need. I’m confident!”

No matter how good the X – ray equipment was, it would not be as clear as his mental power. There was no need to check if the bone was reset.

Besides, in order to shorten the time for recovery, Xia ruofei had specially used his essential Qi and mental strength to move the small pieces of bones near the broken bone to the original position after he had set the calf bone back in place.

Under the investigation of his mental power, he could see the situation of the injury at a glance. Except for the extremely small bone residue, the small pieces of broken bones were basically pieced together to the position of the fracture.

As for the tiny bone fragments, they would usually be absorbed during the treatment process and would not be affected. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

If an X – ray scan was used, all of this would be seen.

It was easy to explain why the bone – setting technique was so brilliant, but if even such a small piece of broken bone could be recovered at the same time, it was really a little shocking.

Hence, Xia ruofei would definitely not let doctor li do the examination now.

Doctor li could not help but show a puzzled expression and subconsciously looked at Guo Hongjiang.

“If Mr. Xia says there’s no need, then there’s no need!” Guo Hongjiang frowned slightly.

“Yes, director Guo!” Doctor li didn’t dare to say anything more. He could only suppress his doubts and step aside.

Xia ruofei didn’t say anything else. He carried the bowl of medicine to the star of Hong Kong and started to apply the medicine on his wound with a small brush.

Once the ingredients from the petals of the spirit Heart Flower came into contact with the skin, they would be absorbed immediately. Hence, Xia ruofei was very careful and absolutely avoided touching the ointment with his hands.

The black ointment didn’t seem to be anything special except for the strong smell of Chinese medicine. Guo Hongjiang saw that Xia ruofei had also used the traditional method of setting the bone first and then applying the medicine. He couldn’t help but feel slightly disappointed.
