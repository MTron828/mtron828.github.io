Chapter 932: The “barbarian” seems to be quite rich_1

Translator: 549690339

“You ... How can you be so barbaric!” Zheng Peng shouted angrily.

Xia ruofei glanced at Zheng Peng and said,””I’m only barbaric to scumbags like you who deserve a beating! If you’re not convinced, you can come and practice again!”

Xia ruofei clenched his fist and smiled disdainfully. He raised his chin at Zheng Peng.

Being stared at by Xia ruofei, Zheng Peng suddenly felt cold all over as if his blood had frozen. He even felt like he was being stared at by a poisonous snake. He could not help but shiver and avoided Xia ruofei’s eyes guiltily.

Xia ruofei had only released a little spiritual pressure, but Zheng Peng was already scared out of his wits.

This kind of weirdo could enthusiastically hit on another girl in front of his girlfriend, and the girl who was hit on was with her “boyfriend”. After being rejected, she was still so shameless. It could be seen how bad her character was.

Naturally, Xia ruofei would not be nice to such a person.

“Qiao’ er, let’s continue!” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

“En!” Lin Qiao nodded heavily and didn’t even look at Zheng Peng. She held Xia ruofei’s arm tightly and almost leaned her whole body on Xia ruofei, just like a couple in love.

Zheng Peng originally wanted to say a few words to save face, but after being swept by Xia ruofei’s bone – chilling gaze, he couldn’t say a word. He could only watch Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao turn and leave.

Tan Lili didn’t look too good either. Seeing Zheng Peng’s dejected look, she couldn’t help but sneer,””Lin Qiao is a top student who scored more than 600 points in the college entrance examination. She has long been accepted by Heron Island University. Do you think she would be interested in Australia’s diploma mill?”

“Lili, I’m just trying to help her out for your sake,” Zheng Peng laughed. I didn’t expect her boyfriend to be so barbaric ...”

Tan Lili pouted and said,”don’t think that I can’t see through your little scheme. You’re only so attentive because Lin Qiao is a beautiful woman.” I don’t know if I was bewitched by a ghost back then, that’s why I fell for you ...”

“Can you stop talking?” Seeing tan Lili’s unyielding attitude, Zheng Peng felt a little embarrassed.

At this time, tan Lili saw Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao, who were not far away, stopped and talked to two girls.

“No way? They have acquaintances in Australia?” Tan Lili asked curiously. She had forgotten about Zheng Peng’s anger.

“Let’s go and take a look ...”Said Zheng Peng.

“Haven’t you embarrassed yourself enough?” Tan Lili couldn’t help rolling her eyes.

“This road isn’t opened by them. Besides, if we want to go back to the hotel, we have to go through here, don’t we?” Zheng Peng laughed.

Actually, he wanted to see what Xia ruofei was going to say to the two girls. More importantly, the two girls looked pretty and had attractive figures.

After Zheng Peng finished speaking, he took the lead and walked over.

Tan Lili stomped her feet in anger. She hesitated for a moment, but still followed.

Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao were stopped again before they could take two steps. This time, the person called them “Mr. Xia.” He also felt a little incredulous. Even in China, it was rare to meet acquaintances like this one after another, right? What was going on today?

Xia ruofei stopped in his tracks and turned around. He was stunned for a moment, then he smiled and said,””It’s Purser yang! What a coincidence!”

It turned out that the person who had called out to Xia ruofei was the chief flight attendant of their flight to Australia. Xia ruofei vaguely remembered that her name tag read “yang” or something. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Yup! Mr. Xia, we flew to Australia again yesterday, and our flight hours are up, so we’re staying here to rest for a day. We’ll return to China tomorrow. ” Purser yang said with a smile,”I’ve not imagined that I could meet you again. It’s really fate!”

There weren’t many first – Class passengers to begin with. Furthermore, the first – Class tickets for such long – distance flights were extremely expensive. Most of the time, they were empty. Hence, Purser yang had a deep impression of Xia ruofei.

Of course, this alone was not enough for Chief Steward yang to be so enthusiastic about Xia ruofei.

It was mainly because little Haoran had suddenly fallen ill on the plane. At that time, Tang Yitian was already anxious like an ant on a hot pot. He even pulled the chief flight attendant and asked the plane to return immediately.

At that time, the situation was so urgent that Xia ruofei, who had stepped out and successfully saved little Haoran, naturally left a good impression on the crew.

“Let’s go back on Egret Island Airlines ‘flight. Who knows, we might even run into you guys!”Xia ruofei chuckled.

“How can there be such a coincidence?” Chief Steward yang smiled and said,”our flight crew does not fly on a fixed route, so the probability of us meeting each other is very low.”

Just then, Xia ruofei saw the Mercedes – Benz from Paradise Farm slowly driving over. He smiled and said,””Purser yang, my friend is here to pick me up. We’ll go back first!”

The beautiful flight attendant next to Purser yang said,””Handsome, it’s fate that we’ve met. Give us your phone number!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I can’t ask for more!.”

With that, Xia ruofei gave his phone number to the two of them. The flight attendant and Purser yang took out their phones and recorded the number. They then called Xia ruofei.

Hearing Xia ruofei’s phone ring, the beautiful flight attendant smiled and said,””Handsome, the number starting from 139 is my number. My name is Yuan sisi, and our purser’s name is Yang Ying. Remember to save your number!”

Xia ruofei nodded as he saved the number. Then, he smiled and said,””I’ve saved it! If you need any help, call me at any time!”

Yang Ying and Yuan sisi waved goodbye to Xia ruofei and Xia Xiaofu with smiles on their faces.

Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao walked to the Mercedes – Benz that Liang Qichao drove.

Liang Qichao and Xia ruofei did not have an ordinary boss – employee relationship. They were good friends. His ingratiating behavior at the airport last time was more of a show – off, so he did not get out of the car today. He just smiled and waved at the two of them from the car.

Xia ruofei opened the car door and got in with Lin Qiao.

Lin Qiao gently pinched the flesh on Xia ruofei’s arm and said,”Brother ruofei, you’ve been in luck recently! Two beautiful girls were fighting to give you their numbers!”

Xia ruofei laughed awkwardly. Liang Qichao, who was sitting in the front row, immediately perked up and asked,””What’s the situation? Xia ruofei, aren’t you a little too aggressive?”

“Just drive your car!” Xia ruofei said unhappily,”the chief flight attendant and the flight attendant of the flight we were on to Australia met at the scenic Area and chatted for a while. Isn’t it normal to exchange phone numbers before we leave?”

“Or an air stewardess? Two!” Liang Qichao said in shock.

He couldn’t help but turn to look at Xia ruofei with eyes of worship.

Lin Qiao couldn’t help but giggle.

Xia ruofei whispered in Lin Qiao’s ear,””Qiao’ er, I haven’t scolded you yet! Why don’t you explain our relationship to your classmate?”

Lin Qiao’s pretty face became slightly hot, but she said stubbornly,”Tan Lili loves to show off the most. I saw her with her boyfriend, so of course she wouldn’t want to lose to him! Brother ruofei, you’re my brother! Can’t you even help me at the critical moment?”

“Okay, okay, okay ...” Xia ruofei said helplessly,”I’m not your brother anymore. You’re my sister ... No, you’re my great aunt ...”

Lin Qiao couldn’t help but burst out laughing. She hit Xia ruofei and said,””Am I that old? You’re so annoying!”

……

At the entrance of the Hunter Valley’s garden, Zheng Peng and tan Lili also saw Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao sitting in the big Benz. They looked at each other in surprise.

Although the price of foreign cars was not very expensive, a luxury car like the Mercedes – Benz S – Class was still not something that the working class could afford.

More importantly, they were in Australia. If Xia ruofei and Xia Xiaofei were backpackers, why would there be a Big Ben to pick them up?

“What does your classmate do?” Zheng Peng couldn’t help but ask in a low voice,”you’re so awesome even overseas!”

“I don’t know! “Lin Qiao is very low – Key in school. She doesn’t seem like a child from a rich family ...” Tan Lili also said blankly.

She rolled her eyes and walked up to Yang Ying and Yuan sisi. She smiled and asked,””Hello, are you also Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao’s friends?”

Yang Ying and Wang Yao were also about to leave in the car, but they suddenly heard someone greeting them in Chinese, so they stopped.

“Are you also Mr. Xia’s friends?” Yang Ying asked, a little surprised.

“We’re from Egret Island Airlines,” she said with a smile.”We met Mr. Xia on the plane, so ... We’re not friends yet, right?”

At the side, Yuan sisi said mischievously,””Sister yang, how can we not be friends? we’ve even exchanged phone numbers!”

“You ...” Yang Ying couldn’t help but poke Yuan sisi’s forehead with her finger.

Yuan sisi was a lively person by nature. She was the one who suggested exchanging numbers with Xia ruofei. If it was Yang Ying who had a calm personality, she would not have taken the initiative.

In fact, Zheng Peng and tan Lili were not far behind them and had heard Xia ruofei call Yang Ying “Purser yang”. So, tan Lili just wanted to confirm it and also wanted to know if they had known each other before.

After getting the answer, Zheng Peng said in surprise,””Do you air stewardesses all have such good memories? You guys fly on flights every day, and there are at least two to three hundred people on each flight! You can even remember their names?”

Yuan sisi pouted.”There are many passengers on the plane, but there are only a few first – Class passengers. Besides, Xia ruofei is a handsome guy. Of course, we can remember him!”

“First class!” Zheng Peng couldn’t help but be stunned.

He often traveled back and forth between China and Australia, so he was very clear about the price of air tickets. He knew that Heron Island Airlines ‘flight was a direct flight from the three mountains to Sydney. The ticket price was very expensive, and the first – Class cabin was even more outrageous. A single trip would cost at least 20000 Yuan.

Even he was reluctant to sit in first class. At most, he would buy a business class ticket for comfort.

Was that barbarian even richer than him? Zheng Peng couldn’t help but be a little confused ...
