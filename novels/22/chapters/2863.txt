2864 Run after pretending (1)

When Xia ruofei saw Wu Lei pass the ball over, he was stunned.

That was because Wu Lei’s position was actually very good, and the angle of his shot was not small. He could totally shoot on his own, and the probability of scoring was very high.

Xia ruofei did not expect Wu Lei to pass the ball.

To be honest, Xia ruofei felt that it would be a bit of a bully to kick a ball without any skill. He was facing a big gap now. Even if someone had never played before, they would still have a high chance of scoring.

Of course, since Wu Lei had already brought the biscuit to his mouth, Xia ruofei could not reject him.

He steadied his mind, sped up, and ran two steps to catch up with the football. Then, with a light push of the arch of his foot, he easily sent the ball into the empty goal.

Five to zero.

Near the end of the first half of the game, Xia ruofei re – wrote the score again. He also made use of this easy goal to perform a hat – trick in the first half of the game. Wu Lei, as a striker, actually performed a hat – trick with an assist.

The faces of the players from Herona were a little numb. They stared at the football in the goal as if the first half of the game was a nightmare.

In particular, the center back who had just made a big mistake and given a big gift lay on the grass with his face in his hands, not getting up for a long time.

Wu Lei was even more excited than Xia ruofei after the goal. He rushed to Xia ruofei and said loudly,””Brother Xia! A hat – trick! A hat – trick! You only used half the time to score a hat – trick!”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly,”Lei Zi, why didn’t you just open the door?” You could have easily scored!”

Wu Lei laughed and said,”your position is even better!” Besides, if the goal was scored, it would be a hat – trick, which would be different! Also, didn’t I also help with a hat – trick? Speaking of which, it’s a milestone. In the past, my assists in a season might only be in the single digits, but today I got three in one game! It’s still better to play football with you!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”we could have scored a goal!” Yet, you turned it into an assist! You’re still laughing!”

“I’m just as happy as you are when you score!”Wu Lei said with a smile.

At this time, the Spanish players also came up to celebrate. Xia ruofei did not say anything more. Anyway, the goal had become a reality. He touched the back of Wu Lei’s head and said,””Let’s continue to score in the second half! No matter how many assists you get, it’s not as practical as a goal. After all, you’re a striker!”

“Understood!” Wu Lei said happily.

The RCD Espanyol players did not celebrate. After high – fiving Xia ruofei in celebration, they walked in the direction of their own half with their arms around each other.

The Spanish fans in the stands were really singing and dancing, as if they were celebrating a Festival. With the overall strength of the Spanish team, it was extremely difficult to have such a big victory in the entire season. The home fans were really worth the ticket price!

The commentators from all the broadcasting platforms were naturally not stingy with their words of praise. They did their best to give all the praise to Xia ruofei. The commentators from China, Shen fangjian and Jia Tianning, were even more excited. After all, the ball came from the exquisite cooperation of two Chinese players.

First, Xia ruofei’s brilliant pass tore Herona’s entire line of defense apart, giving Wu Lei the chance to face the opposing goalkeeper. Then, Wu Lei returned the ball to Xia ruofei without any hesitation. In the end, Xia ruofei easily pushed open the empty door and completed the entire attack process.

Basically, the other players of Espanyol did not participate in the attack. It was completely the cooperation of Xia ruofei and Wu Lei, who easily penetrated Herona’s goal.

As Shen fangjian and Jia Tianning chatted, they changed the topic to the national football team. The news of Xia ruofei’s confirmation to join the national football team a few days ago had long been known to the fans, which meant that the national football team had another stable scorer. Especially Xia ruofei’s free kick, which could definitely bring a surprise to the national football team at the critical moment.

Xia ruofei and Wu Lei’s form was hot, and everyone was full of anticipation for the World Cup qualifiers.

Many sports media reporters, including some Chinese sports media reporters stationed in Barcelona, had also come to the El prate Stadium. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

While the reporters marveled at Xia ruofei’s state, they couldn’t help but feel a trace of sympathy for Xia ruofei’s sacrifice, Herona. Especially when they saw the blank and numb faces of the players on the field, they couldn’t help but feel sympathetic.

However, competitive sports was cruel. If you were not good enough or in a bad state, you could not blame the other party for not showing mercy.

The reporters had even thought of the title for the game report, which was inseparable from keywords such as “tragedy” and “one – sided massacre.”

After the game resumed, Spain finally stopped their frenzied attacks, and Herona’s side had no fighting spirit at all. So, in the end, with about five minutes of injury stoppage time, both sides played a little dull. The control of the football was more often switched back and forth in the midfield area.

As soon as the injury stoppage time was over, the referee did not even make up for a second more and directly blew the whistle to end the first half of the game.

The players of Herona felt as if they had been granted Amnesty and heaved a long sigh of relief in their hearts throughout the first half. They felt that every second on the field was torture. After hearing the whistle, they did not hesitate at all and all walked towards the players ‘passageway with their heads lowered.
