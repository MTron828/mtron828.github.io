2685 A thorough investigation (2)

“Qingfeng, it’s only been a few minutes and you don’t recognize me anymore?” The middle – aged man asked with a smile. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Liu Qingfeng couldn’t help but tremble. This voice was too familiar. It was Xia ruofei’s voice! But ... The person was completely different. He was a different person. There was nothing that could be linked to Xia ruofei.

“You’re President Xia?” Liu Qingfeng asked hesitantly.

The middle – aged man was Xia ruofei after he had changed his appearance. He shrugged and said,””Is there anyone else in this room?”

Liu Qingfeng was too familiar with this office. Except for the lounge in the next room, there was no other place that could hide people. He even couldn’t help but go to the lounge to check if Xia ruofei was hiding inside.

Of course, his rationality told him that it was impossible. Xia ruofei had no reason to play such a prank on him.

“President Xia ... This ... This ...” Liu Qingfeng said with a bitter smile,”you ... This is like magic!”

Xia ruofei folded the clothes he had just changed out of and put them into his backpack. Then, he said nonchalantly,””It’s just a little trick. I learned how to disguise myself when I was in the Army. I can cover up my original features by changing some facial details.”

Xia ruofei’s current method of changing his appearance was obviously not the disguise investigation method that he learned in the Army. However, the principle he spoke of was not different.

“It’s simply amazing!” Liu Qingfeng sighed,”why do I feel like my height has changed?”

Xia ruofei lifted his feet and said,”can’t you see that I’ve changed my shoes?” It’s easy to become taller, but it’s not so easy to become shorter. ”

Liu Qingfeng gauged and felt that Xia ruofei had indeed become taller.

Xia ruofei continued to smile and asked,””Do you think the employees can still recognize me now?”

“Impossible!” Liu Qingfeng said,”if you didn’t say anything, I wouldn’t have believed it. Those employees are not familiar with you, so they definitely can’t recognize your voice. ”

“Your voice can also be changed.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”for example ... Can you still hear it now?”

The second half of his sentence was spoken in a completely different tone. His voice was much lower, and this change was very natural, unlike some people who lowered their voices and could be heard at once.

Liu Qingfeng was simply dumbfounded, and could not help but sigh in admiration,”President Xia, I’m really convinced! I can guarantee that even those who are close to you wouldn’t be able to recognize you!”

“That’s good!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”alright, take me to the interview room!”

“Yes! This way please, President Xia!” Liu Qingfeng said.

“From now on, call me Commissioner Xu!” Xia ruofei said,”I’m the HR manager from the headquarters.”

“I understand! Commissioner Xu!” Liu Qingfeng said,”please wait a moment. I’ll go out and make some arrangements!”

Liu Qingfeng thought of the guards in the corridor and decided to go out first to send them away, and then let Xia ruofei go out.

Xia ruofei looked at Liu Qingfeng’s back with satisfaction and nodded secretly.

The reason why he did this instead of directly disguising himself to come to the island was, on the one hand, that his own identity was more intimidating in front of Liu Qingfeng and the others. On the other hand, he also deliberately wanted to muddy the water and make the situation more confusing, so as to lay the foundation for his next plan.

It was conceivable that if Wang Boshan really used the Liu family’s employees who were sent back to the country to get information, the information would definitely make them more confused. When Xia ruofei started to set up, it would be hard not to fall into the trap.

After Liu Qingfeng went out, he withdrew all the guards, then walked in and said to Xia ruofei,””Xia ... Commissioner Xu, you can leave now!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei nodded.

Liu Qingfeng led Xia ruofei to a small meeting room on the same floor as his office. It had been set up as an interview venue. Xia ruofei walked to the meeting table and sat down, then said to Liu Qingfeng,”Go and call for help!”

“Alright!” Liu Qingfeng nodded and said, then turned around and left the small conference room.

Next, the remaining staff were called to this small conference room to be “interviewed” by Xia ruofei. Liu Qingfeng had been standing guard outside the whole time. He realized that everyone had only been in for about three to five minutes. He even asked a few people what the “interview” was about. The result was that the answers were varied, and everyone was asked different questions. In conclusion, Commissioner Xu was actually just having a casual conversation with everyone. He casually asked a few questions and asked everyone to leave. As for the results of the “interview,” naturally, he had no idea.

Actually, if Xia ruofei wanted to identify a person, he only needed ten to twenty seconds. Moreover, he used his mental strength technique when he was hypnotizing. The person being hypnotized would not even realize that they had been hypnotized for a while.

Hence, Xia ruofei’s “interview” question was actually just a formality.

Otherwise, it would be too strange for the interviewees to be in a daze after entering, and then the interview would be over.

There were about 50 people who wanted to stay, so Xia ruofei spent a full three hours to go through all of them.

To be honest, hypnotizing these ordinary people was not difficult for Xia ruofei at all. It did not consume much of his mental strength. However, he was very tired from being patient and asking all kinds of boring questions like an examiner.
