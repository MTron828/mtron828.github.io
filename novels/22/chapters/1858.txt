Wu Liqian bit her lower lip and decided not to tell Xia ruofei about these things.

Although she knew that Xia ruofei had a very good relationship with Tian Huilan’s family, and that Xia ruofei’s connections in Sanshan city and even the southeast province were not something she could compare to, and that if Xia ruofei was willing to help, her problems would most likely be solved, she did not want to do so.

Firstly, Wu Liqian didn’t want her relationship with Xia ruofei to be affected by other materialistic factors.

The second reason, which was also the most important reason, was that Wu Liqian had more or less understood Liu haojun’s situation. She knew that Liu haojun came from the capital and his family was very powerful. She was worried that Xia ruofei would make such a dangerous enemy.

In Wu Liqian’s opinion, Xia ruofei was rather influential in Sanshan city or the southeast province. However, the waters in the capital were too deep. She could not let Xia ruofei get involved in this.

After thinking for a while, she said,”it’s not a difficult thing. It’s just that work hasn’t been going well. We’ve been talking about an investment project for a long time. In the end, it failed. This project can’t be settled in Changping.”

Of course, Wu Liqian’s words were not entirely true. She knew that if she did not tell him the details, Xia ruofei would definitely question her further. Therefore, she simply told him about the Huanglong group withdrawing their investments. It was the truth anyway. She was not lying. She just did not tell him the main reason.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I see!” Then I really can’t help much. I can’t use a gun to force people to invest ... Wait! Investment? Sister Qian, how much is the investment for this project that you were talking about?”

Wu Liqian was stunned for a moment.”It’s not very big,” she said.”It’s about 700 million!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Sister Qian, I don’t care if other people invest or not. However, I might be able to help with attracting investment. Actually, I’m looking for you today because of this ...”

Wu Liqian’s eyes lit up as she asked,””Ruofei, you’re saying ... Your company is preparing to invest in Changping County?”

“Yes!” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“How much is the investment?” Wu Liqian asked.

When it came to work, Wu Liqian forgot all the unhappy things for the time being. It was as if she had returned to the days when she first came to work in Changping County.

“The total investment amount is about 1.5 billion Yuan!” Xia ruofei said,”the initial investment is about 500 million! It’s not worse than the project you talked about before, right?”

Wu Liqian couldn’t help but take a deep breath and said,””Ruofei, your business is so big now?”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”Hi!” Our company doesn’t have that much cash flow, but can’t we take a loan? Our company still has a lot of high – Quality assets, and we still have zero debt, so it’s not a big problem to get a loan. ”

“What project are you planning to invest in this time?” Wu Liqian asked impatiently.

For the local government, the amount of investment was one aspect of their achievements, and the other aspect was the quality of the project.

Different projects were very different. For example, some heavy pollution projects, the local government would not blindly introduce them without screening like in the past. After all, it was related to social impact and local sustainable development problems.

In addition, after a project was put into production, the amount of revenue was also directly linked to tax.

Therefore, there was a huge difference between a high – Quality project and an ordinary project.

Often, the better the quality of the project, the more preferential policies the local government could offer.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory’s branch factory!” How was it? This project should be able to catch the eyes of County Head Wu, right?”

Hearing this, Wu Liqian couldn’t care less about Xia ruofei’s teasing. She was completely overwhelmed by the huge surprise.

The miracle created by Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory was known to all the people of San Shan.

Wu Liqian had already used the famous jaded skin cream before it was mass – produced. She had a deep impression of the magical effects of the jaded skin cream. Later on, the jaded skin cream sold well all over the country. Every time it was snapped up online, it would be sold out in a short time. The sales of hundreds of millions of Yuan at a time made Wu Liqian look at it in a new light.

Now that she heard that Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory’s branch was going to be set up in Changping County, Wu Liqian felt like a big gift bag had fallen from the sky and hit her head.

As long as she thought about the terrifying money – making ability of the Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory, Wu Liqian felt as if she was stepping on the clouds.

She knew very well that the reason why Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory had set up a branch factory was to expand its production capacity. The old factory area had already reached its limit. If they started a new factory in Changping County, it was very likely that they would be able to do it in one go. When the time came, the scale of the branch factory would definitely be several times larger than the main factory.

Such a pharmaceutical factory, how much revenue would it make in a year, and how much tax would it pay? How much of a contribution would it make to the finances of the entire Changping County? Wu Liqian didn’t dare to imagine it ...

“Sister Qian! Sister Qian!”

After Xia ruofei called her twice, Wu Liqian finally came back to her senses.

Xia ruofei laughed and asked,”sister Qian, I was just talking about the key point!” Why are you still daydreaming? Have you been too tired recently? Didn’t rest well?”

Wu Liqian glared at Xia ruofei and said,””Isn’t it all your fault? Who asked you to suddenly put up such a big satellite, it scared me silly ...”
