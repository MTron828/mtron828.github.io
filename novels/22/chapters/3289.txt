Hearing this, Xia ruofei immediately perked up and asked,””Daoist priest, what other functions does the perceptual mirror have?”

Old Daoist Zhen Yang smiled and said,”actually, scholar Xia could’ve discovered this function by himself, but I’ll tell you!” The sensory mirror had another very important function in this trial Pagoda, and that was to display the map. Through the sensory mirror, scholar Xia could find the entrance and exit of each floor. There were even some places where there might be opportunities, which were marked in the sensory mirror. Of course, the markings aren’t necessarily accurate, and although some of the marked locations have great opportunities, they are also accompanied by great risks. As such, I suggest that you use them with caution!”

Xia ruofei was stunned. He didn’t expect the perceptual mirror to have such an amazing function!

He hurriedly used his mind to communicate with the perceptual mirror. Sure enough, he quickly figured out how to use it. A map appeared in his field of vision in an instant. There was a small dot of light on the map that was the location of true yang temple, which was obviously his current position. Xia ruofei tried to take two steps to the side and the small dot of light immediately moved a little. It was quite sensitive and accurate.

Xia ruofei looked at the map of the first floor and realized that the area was not big. The mini town was the most important thing in the area. Even the smallest alley in the town was marked on the map.

Besides, Xia ruofei soon found the entrance to the second level, which was located at the side of true yang temple.

This function was simply too heaven – defying! Xia ruofei was very excited.

With the perceptual mirror, his movements in the tower would be much more convenient!

Right, it seemed that Taoist Zhen Yang had called this tower the trial tower. Xia ruofei thought of this and quickly asked,””Daoist Zhen Yang, this tower was originally called the trial tower? I wonder if you can give me more information about the trial Pagoda?”

“Everything about the trial Pagoda will have to be explored by scholar Xia himself. I can’t reveal it to you,” Daoist Zhen Yang said with a smile.

“Alright then!” Xia ruofei said.

However, he wasn’t too disappointed. After all, the perceptual mirror he obtained this time would be of great help to him.

Xia ruofei didn’t know if Chen Xuan and the rest would experience the same trial tower. He also didn’t know if any of them could draw a 20 – line diagram. However, he knew that if he didn’t go online to read all kinds of knowledge and just remembered it, it would be almost impossible to deduce it on the spot.

Hence, Xia ruofei estimated that only Ling Qingxue and Yu Xin ‘er could do it, while the rest of the team could not.

This was because other than the two of them who had gone through formal higher education in the secular world, most of the others were born and grew up in the sect. Chen Xuan had learned some computer knowledge later on, but that was only for the sake of working in the Paradise Corporation. He didn’t know much about other aspects of the secular world.

Xia ruofei originally wanted to find out more about the situation in the trial Pagoda and the entire secret realm. However, seeing that old Daoist Zhen Yang would not reveal anything, he did not make any more futile efforts.

“Scholar Xia, I’ve handed the sensory mirror to you, and it looks like you’re already familiar with it,” old Daoist Zhen Yang said with a smile. Next, it’s time to honor the second reward that I just mentioned!”

“Oh?” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”I wonder what the second reward is?”

“Please follow me, scholar Xia!” Old Daoist Zhen Yang said with a smile.

With that, old Taoist Zhen Yang walked out of the quiet room first. Xia ruofei quickly followed after him.

He didn’t know what old Daoist Zhen Yang was up to, but up until now, old Daoist Zhen Yang had been kind to him. He had also said that it was a reward, and according to the puppet’s operating rules, since it was a reward, it shouldn’t be a trap.

Old Daoist Zhen Yang kept walking forward and walked out of true yang temple.

Xia ruofei was curious as to where the old Daoist was taking him. He saw that old Daoist Zhen Yang was already on the winding mountain road, so he quickly followed him and asked,””Daoist Zhen Yang, where are we going?”

“Scholar Xia, just follow me. We’ll find out soon enough!” Old Daoist Zhen Yang said with a smile.

Xia ruofei shrugged his shoulders. Since the old Taoist wanted to keep him in suspense, he couldn’t force him to tell him. He could only follow behind.

After Daoist Zhen Yang walked down the small mountain, he headed straight for the mini town.

Xia ruofei opened the map in the perceptual mirror out of boredom. As he walked, he looked at the dot of light that represented him moving forward. It was quite similar to the navigation function when driving, but it seemed to be more precise.

From afar, Xia ruofei could see that the mini town was still bustling with people. It was a bustling scene.

However, he knew very well that everything in the town was man – made, including the residents.

When old Taoist Zhen Yang brought Xia ruofei onto the stone path of the town, the entire town fell silent in an instant, as if the whole world had been paused.

A peddler selling candied Haws had been shouting loudly as he walked. Now, he still maintained his striding posture, his head slightly raised, his mouth wide open, and his expression quite rich, but he was completely frozen.

The shopkeeper had just passed a piece of cloth to the young girl opposite the counter, and the young girl was currently reaching out to take the cloth with an innocent smile on her face. All of this had frozen in the moment when old Daoist Zhen Yang stepped onto the stone path.
