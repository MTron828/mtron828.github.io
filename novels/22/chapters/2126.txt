2127 Full preparation (2)

The fuel tank of this yacht was about 11000 liters, and it was about 60000 Yuan to fill it up. However, there was still a surplus in the fuel tank, so Xia ruofei ended up paying about 50000 Yuan for the fuel.

Although it wasn’t as much as 100000 or 200000 Yuan, this yacht was still too expensive for ordinary people.

After all, even if they filled up the oil, if they sailed a little further out to sea, they would probably use up most of the oil in a round trip.

After refueling, Xia ruofei drove the yacht back to his designated berth and parked it. Then, he got off the yacht.

Before driving away from the Yacht Club, Xia ruofei told Qin Lan that he would be going out on the yacht the day after tomorrow.

Of course, Xia ruofei was just making a casual remark. He did not need the Yacht Club to prepare a pilot or any other staff.

After leaving the Yacht Club, Xia ruofei contacted Liu Zhe.

It was mainly about the purchase of diesel. He thought that Liu Zhe’s father was the leader of the state – owned assets Control Commission and should have more dealings with large state – owned enterprises like two barrels of oil. He should be able to buy diesel smoothly if he asked for his help.

After all, gas stations didn’t sell diesel directly. They could only fill it up by driving. If they wanted to buy it in bulk, they usually went to the fuel depot, but the procedures were very troublesome and required the approval of many departments.

When Liu Zhe heard that Xia ruofei wanted to buy a batch of diesel wholesale, he did not ask why Xia ruofei wanted to buy diesel in detail. He immediately agreed and asked Xia ruofei how much he needed to buy.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”if possible, about 100 tons!” Of course, if there are any difficulties, less is fine. ”

The fuel tank capacity of his yacht was about ten tons. If he could store another 100 tons of diesel, it was equivalent to a tenfold increase in range. He could drive at least a few thousand nautical miles. If he used an economic speed, he could even go to Australia and back.

With such a long range, it was enough for him to gallop freely on the sea.

After Liu Zhe heard this, he smiled and said,””Since brother Xia has spoken, what can’t I do? Moreover, 100 tons wasn’t a lot. I’ll help you with the relevant procedures, it’ll be done in a day!”

“Thank you so much!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Oh right, I need to pack all this diesel in oil barrels and send it to the designated location for me. I’ll pay for the oil barrels and the transportation fees.”

“No problem!” Liu Zhe said,”I’ll get them to store it in 200 L barrels!”

Xia ruofei calculated silently. The density of diesel was lower than that of water. One ton of diesel was about 1200 l, which meant that six barrels had to be filled. 100 tons would be about 600 barrels.

This kind of oil barrel could be stacked up to several levels, and his warehouse in the city could completely store it.

Hence, he said,”that’s fine!” Liu Zhe, I’ll send you the address in a moment. Tell them that I’ll pay in cash and check. If they want to transfer the money, I can also transfer it to their account in advance. ”

“Alright!” “Brother Xia, just wait for my news!” Liu Zhe said.

……

Liu Zhe was very efficient. He called Xia ruofei in the afternoon and told him that the procedures were all done. He had also contacted the oil depot. 100 tons of diesel was only about 120000 liters. This amount of oil was not much for the fuel depot, and there was no need to mix the oil.

However, Xia ruofei had requested for them to be filled in the bucket, so it would take some time.

They would start loading the barrels at the oil depot this afternoon. With some overtime at night, they would be able to deliver the barrels to the warehouse that Xia ruofei had specified the next morning.

Xia ruofei was overjoyed and said,”thanks!” Liu Zhe, you’ve been a great help!”

“Brother Xia, this is a piece of cake for me,” Liu Zhe said with a smile.”You don’t have to be so polite ... By the way, I’ll go with you tomorrow!”

“No need!” Xia ruofei said,”just give me the contact information of their team leader! I’ll be there in advance to wait for them. ”

“I don’t have anything to do tomorrow anyway ...”

“There’s really no need to go through so much trouble. You can just greet them. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”and I might buy it more than once! I’ll have to trouble you in the future, you can’t always send oil over!”

“Alright then!” Liu Zhe said,”brother Xia, if anything happens, just give me a call.”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

After hanging up, Xia ruofei started to pack his things.

He used the afternoon to purchase a lot of things in the city, including food, drinking water, and other necessities of life on the sea, as well as some emergency facilities and survival equipment.

If it was an ordinary person, they would not be able to carry too much due to the limited capacity of the yacht. However, Xia ruofei had an almost infinite space with him, so he did not have such concerns.

They did not know how long they would be out this time and what they would encounter at sea was unknown. Hence, Xia ruofei had prepared a large amount of food, drinking water, spices, and so on. As for the other supplies, as long as he felt that they might be useful at sea, he would purchase them in large quantities. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

In the afternoon, several small trucks used to deliver goods from the supermarket were used. There were also delivery trucks from other stores. His villa in the city had become a courier station.

That night, after Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue had cultivated for a while, they sent her home early.

Xia ruofei also told Ling Qingxue that he was going to sail the yacht out for a few days.

Of course, he first invited Ling Qingxue to go out with him. However, when he heard that he was going to go out for a few days to test the performance of the yacht, Ling Qingxue gave up. After all, it was impossible for her to not go to the company for a few days in a row. She was not Xia ruofei, who could just leave everything to others.

Xia ruofei had originally planned to go out to sea alone. As for going to the coastal waters with Ling Qingxue to enjoy some alone time, he could only think about it next time.

Xia ruofei went to bed early after he got home.

The next day, he had a simple breakfast and dropped Ling Qingxue off at the office. Then, he drove straight to the warehouse in the city.

The truck from the oil depot had not arrived yet, but a manager named Wu had contacted Xia ruofei in advance and told him that they had already set off. They should be arriving soon.

Xia ruofei opened the door of the warehouse and sent a WeChat message to Feng Jing as he waited. He told her that he would be out for a few days and that there might be no signal by then.

He also left the maritime satellite phone number on the yacht with Feng Jing, so that he could contact her if there was an emergency.

Feng Rao was already used to Xia ruofei’s occasional shirking. She didn’t even complain about Xia ruofei. She only said that she understood and didn’t say anything else.

Xia ruofei waited for another ten minutes or so and saw a convoy of large trucks driving over from afar.

A middle – aged man in his forties jumped down from the first car and said to Xia ruofei,””Hello, you must be President Xia?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s me!” Are you manager Wu? Hard work! It’s been hard on you!”

“You’re welcome, President Xia! This is part of our job!” Manager Wu smiled and said,”the 600 barrels of diesel are all here! Mr. Xia, are we unloading it at this warehouse?”

Xia ruofei nodded and looked at the trucks.””Yes! The door here is higher, so the car can directly drive in to unload ...”

“Okay, okay ...” Manager Wu said.

Then, he beckoned for a subordinate to come over and whispered a few instructions. The first truck immediately started slowly, increased its horsepower, and drove up the small slope at the entrance of the warehouse, directly into the warehouse.

The unloading workers brought by manager Wu immediately ran into the warehouse and began to unload the truck.

Xia ruofei smiled at manager Wu and said,””Manager Wu, let’s settle the payment! Do you accept cash and checks? If it’s not convenient, I can go with you to the bank to transfer the money. ”

“Convenient! It’s convenient!” Manager Wu quickly said,”you can just give me cash and a check!”

Xia ruofei nodded. He took out a checkbook and asked,””How much is it in total?”
