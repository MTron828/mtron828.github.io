Then, Xia ruofei called Feng Jing and told her that he would be going to Heron Island for two days. He also arranged some work for the company.

As for Ling Qingxue, Xia ruofei did not forget to report to her. At the same time, he made an appointment with her to arrange for Zhao Yongjun and the others to meet Ling Xiaotian at the headquarters of the lingji F & B group after he returned from Heron Island. He wanted to settle the matter of the Ling Ji private kitchen being built at the club.

The next morning, Xia ruofei drove to the forestry Bureau dormitory first. Although the new house was ready to move in, Hu Zi’s mother still lived in the forestry Bureau dormitory for the convenience of picking up monitor old Luo’s orphan Nan Nan. They would only move in when Nan Nan was on winter break and Lin Qiao returned from Egret Island.

Xia ruofei took a bag of clothes and a big bag of food from Hu Zi’s mother. According to Hu Zi’s mother, there were a lot of chicken wings and duck gizzards that she had braised overnight. Lin Qiao loved her mother’s personally made braised food the most. Moreover, these food could be stored for a long time, and it was enough for Lin Qiao to eat for many days.

After collecting his things, Xia ruofei drove straight to the highway exit. Zhao Yongjun and the others met up with Xia ruofei in a commercial car.

It was more crowded for six people to sit in a car, so after they met up, Zhao Yongjun and song Rui switched to Xia ruofei’s car. Then, the two cars entered the highway and headed towards Egret Island City.

This trip was a leisure trip, so the road was not particularly rushed. Everyone listened to music and drove at an average speed of about 100 miles an hour. They also chatted over the walkie – talkie from time to time. The atmosphere was quite relaxed.

They didn’t deliberately rush, so the two cars drove to the cross – Sea bridge of Heron Island one after another at noon.

The central city of Heron Island was on the island. No matter which direction one entered the island from, they had to cross the sea bridge.

Zhao Yongjun looked out of the window with interest at Heron Island Airport, which was taking off and landing in the distance. Qingqing airport was on the beach. Driving on the cross – Sea bridge often allowed one to see the scene of planes taking off and landing, and the view was very good.

“Ruofei, are we going to Gulangyu directly?” Song Rui asked lazily as he leaned back in his seat. He was a little tired after sitting in the car for such a long time.

On this trip to Heron Island, Liu Zhe had helped to arrange the accommodation. It was on Gulangyu, a special reception point for Heron island’s state – owned assets administration. It was very convenient for Liu Zhe to book a few rooms.

Gulangyu was an even smaller Island next to Heron Island. It was also a famous scenic spot. There was no bridge connecting it to the city, so you could only take a ferry to get to Gulangyu. The entire Island was a scenic spot, and you could buy a set of travel tickets that included scenic spot tickets and ferry tickets. Of course, the indigenous people on Gulangyu could take the ferry for free.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”I still have to go to Heron Island University to look for someone. How about this ... Let’s eat on the island first. We’ll go to Gulangyu after we’re done!” I’ll be spending the night on Gulangyu ...”

In fact, he wanted to find Lin Qiao first. He didn’t inform Lin Qiao of his visit in advance because he wanted to give this girl a surprise. He didn’t know how happy Lin Qiao would be when she saw him suddenly appear in front of her!

As Xia ruofei thought about it, the corners of his mouth gradually curved up. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Heron Island University was located by the sea. Xia ruofei drove across the sea bridge and followed huandao road in the direction of Heron Island University ...
