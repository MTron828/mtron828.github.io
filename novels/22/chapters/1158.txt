Translator: 549690339

Zhao Yongjun’s personality was more forthright and he was also a very nostalgic person. Although he didn’t really like life in the army, he couldn’t help but think of his own military days after seeing Wu Qiang.

“I know, old platoon leader!” Wu Qiang said with a touched expression.

Then, Zhao Yongjun said to Xia ruofei,””Ruofei, Wu Qiang is a soldier that I trained. His character is definitely reliable. Moreover, he has good military qualities. He is definitely competent for this job ...”

Xia ruofei naturally understood what Zhao Yongjun meant. He smiled and said,””Of course I trust brother Zhao’s soldiers!”

Then, he smiled at Wu Qiang and asked,””Brother Wu ...”

“You flatter me, boss. You can just call me Wu Qiang ...” Wu Qiang quickly replied.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Wu Qiang, how’s your treatment as a security guard Captain?”

“The monthly salary is about 6000 Yuan. There’s five insurances and one housing Fund. The company provides accommodation and lunch. However, we’re staying in a group dormitory,” Wu Qiang replied honestly. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”if you come over to help me, the job will be relatively simple. You’ll be in charge of the safety and daily maintenance of this house. You can hire a part – time worker to clean the house. Oh, by the way, I’ll also have to be my driver when I’m in the capital. You should be able to do it, right?”

When Wu Qiang heard this, he felt that this job was simply too easy!

To put it bluntly, he just lived here and patrolled every day. He didn’t even have to clean the place himself. As for being a driver, it wasn’t a hard job. Besides, Xia ruofei said that he wouldn’t be staying in the capital for long.

He didn’t have to do much work every day, and he had such a good house to live in. Where could he find such an easy job?

Wu Qiang immediately nodded and said loudly,”Sure!”

“Ruofei, Wu Qiang has been a security Captain for six thousand a month,” Zhao Yongjun said.”You can’t treat him badly!”

“Brother Zhao, do I look like that kind of petty person?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

Xia ruofei was not short of money now. He had always taken good care of his employees, especially the Veterans who had retired from the Army.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”Wu Qiang, how about this?” “If you come over to help me, you’ll get a monthly salary of 8000 Yuan. The kitchen and electrical appliances are all ready here, so you can buy your own food and cook. I’ll give you a food allowance of 1500 Yuan every month. As for the five insurance and one housing Fund ...”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”my company is in the southeast province. If you want to pay the five insurances and one housing Fund in the capital ... Why don’t you find a company to rely on first?” I’ll pay for the expenses!”

Zhao Yongjun immediately replied,”why do we need to find a company?” Just hang it at my company and pay!”

Zhao Yongjun was very satisfied with Xia ruofei’s offer. Although it wasn’t a particularly high income in the capital, it was definitely above average.

Wu Qiang only had a high school degree. Other than having a good hand, he didn’t have any other skills. It was already quite good to be able to find such a job.

Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s a deal then. Send me the payment bill when the time comes!”

“No need,” Zhao Yongjun said casually,”how much can medical and Social Security pay a year?” Just take it as a little token of appreciation from me, the old platoon leader!”

“Alright! We’ll do as brother Zhao says!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Medical and Social Security did not cost much, and Xia ruofei did not stand on ceremony with Zhao Yongjun on such a small matter. He also understood Zhao Yongjun’s mentality of wanting to do something for Wu Qiang.

The two of them settled the matter in a few words. Xia ruofei then turned to Wu Qiang and asked with a smile,””Wu Qiang, are you satisfied with this treatment? If you have any other requests, feel free to bring them up. ”

Wu Qiang was stunned.

Not only was this job extremely easy, but Xia ruofei also paid her well. Not only was her salary increased by 2000 Yuan, but she was also given 1500 Yuan as a food allowance every month. Even the old platoon leader covered all the insurance and housing funds.

Moreover, as the head of security, he often had to be transferred to various banks and buildings to guard, and he often had to work the night shift. His life was irregular, and his work was so hard. If she worked for Xia ruofei, she would get a salary of almost ten thousand Yuan and live in a large courtyard house in the center of the capital. She would have nothing to do every day. It was like heaven and earth!

“Wu Qiang, RUO Fei is asking you!” Zhao Yongjun couldn’t help but remind Wu Qiang with a smile when he saw him in a daze.

Wu Qiang regained his senses and quickly said, “I’m satisfied! He was satisfied! Boss, you’re giving me too much ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””It’s not a very high salary. All the old employees in our company can get this amount. As long as you work hard, you’ll get even better treatment in the future. Also, I won’t let you do this job forever. You can come to the company and work!”

“Thank you, boss!” Wu Qiang said excitedly. I’ll work for you in the future! I’ll go back and resign today!”
