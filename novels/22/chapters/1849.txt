Li Yifu said firmly,”I won’t accept a reward without any work. Senior granduncle, you’ve given me a generous gift. Please forgive me for rejecting you!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. At this moment, he really looked at Li Yifu in a different light.

If it was him, he might not have the courage to refuse.

It was all up to Xia ruofei to decide. If he was just putting on a show, it would be fine. But if he rejected it so firmly, it was possible that Xia ruofei would really take back the gift and never give it to him again.

After all, Li Yifu didn’t know that although spiritual crystals were precious to Xia ruofei, he still had dozens of them.

After laughing, Xia ruofei stuffed the crystals into Li Yifu’s hands and said,””Foster husband, you’ve brought an aircraft here without saying a word from thousands of miles away. You’ve even painted it, and you look like you can’t accept it. I’m here to give you a small gift, but you’re so hesitant. Do my words as a martial granduncle have no effect?”

Li Yifu’s hand trembled slightly as if he was holding a hot potato. He subconsciously wanted to shake it off, but he didn’t dare to take the risk even though he knew that precious cultivation resources like crystals couldn’t be broken. Moreover, there was a thick carpet in the cabin, so he didn’t dare to take the risk.

Xia ruofei’s words were like a stab to his heart. His face turned pale and he almost knelt down on the spot.

“Senior granduncle, this disciple didn’t mean it that way!” Li Yifu quickly said.

Ling Qingxue couldn’t stand it anymore. She didn’t know how precious the crystals were, but she couldn’t bear to see Li Yifu’s panic.

Ling Qingxue said,”that ... Foster husband, since RUO Fei has given it to you, you can take it!” You gave him a brand new plane, so it’s not a big deal for him to give you a little gift in return!”

Li Yifu quickly said,”Grandmaster, you don’t know this. This spiritual crystal is a priceless treasure. Its value can’t be measured by ordinary money, let alone a mere plane.”

Ling Qingxue’s mindset was still not fully transformed. After all, she had only been exposed to cultivation for a short time and was still used to using money to measure the value of things. She didn’t know that spiritual crystals couldn’t be measured with money and couldn’t be bought with any amount of money.

Even if it was to be converted into money, like Xia ruofei selling the spiritual crystal publicly, all the cultivators would be ecstatic and would not care how much money they spent. After all, money in the world did not mean much to them. From this perspective, a spiritual crystal was much more precious than a private jet.

Xia ruofei glanced at Li Yifu and said indifferently,””Foster husband, it’s not good for you to refuse the reward from the sect’s elders. Also, Qingxue has already asked, so I’ll give you these spirit crystals as a gift on behalf of Qingxue! I won’t let you call her Grandmaster for nothing!”

Ling Qingxue’s face blushed slightly, and her heart was filled with sweetness.

Li Yifu opened his mouth and wanted to decline again, but Xia ruofei said firmly,””It’s decided! Otherwise ... You can ask someone to fly this plane back to the United States!”

Xia ruofei then added,””If you still want me to help you find the original origin returning scroll, take this spiritual crystal!”

To Li Yifu, these words were simply a killer weapon.

At the mention of the original Guiyuan Scripture, Li Yifu did not dare to reject Xia ruofei’s spiritual crystal no matter how terrified he was. This was the long – cherished wish of several generations! Now that he had finally met the personal disciple of the Grandmaster, Daoist master Shanhe, it could be said that he had seen a glimmer of hope. If Xia ruofei quit, there would be no hope at all.

Li Yifu struggled for a long time before he finally said with tears in his eyes,””Senior granduncle, this disciple will shamelessly accept it ...”

Xia ruofei said with relief,”that’s right!” After you have spirit crystals, remember to cultivate diligently. If your strength increases, it will also be a help to me!”

“Rest assured, grand uncle – Master!” Li Yifu quickly replied with a serious expression. If you have any orders, this disciple will definitely go through water and tread on fire without a second word!”

After saying that, Li Yifu carefully put the spiritual crystal into his pocket. At this time, he was so excited that he couldn’t wait to sit down and practice the Kasaya immediately. Before, even with the spirit – gathering jade carving, he had to count the cultivation time with his fingers every day. Now that he had the spiritual crystal, he could practice anywhere and anytime as long as he controlled the level well. That feeling was simply too exhilarating!

However, although Li Yifu reluctantly accepted the spiritual crystal under Xia ruofei’s “coercion”, he felt even more apologetic. As a junior of his sect, he should be more respectful to Xia ruofei. However, ever since he met Xia ruofei, Xia ruofei had been helping him.

After thinking for a moment, Li Yifu raised his head and said,””Senior granduncle, I’m really ashamed to accept such a precious gift from you without making any contributions ... How about ... I transfer my shares in the Kyushu group to you? This is a little token of respect from this disciple ...”

Ling Qingxue was taken aback. The Kyushu group in the United States was one of the top companies in the world, with net assets of tens of billions of dollars. Li Yifu was the actual head of the group, so his shares in the group were naturally not small. Even one or two percent of the shares were worth hundreds of millions of dollars! Not to mention all the shares?

Li Yifu was willing to give away 10 billion US dollars without even blinking just for one spiritual crystal? From Li Yifu’s eyes, Ling Qingxue could tell that he wasn’t faking it at all. He was completely sincere.

Ling Qingxue finally had a very direct understanding. It turned out that the small “diamond – shaped crystal” that Xia ruofei had given her for cultivation these two days was actually worth such a high price ...

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”Foster husband, you’re not having a fever, right? The Kyushu group is a listed company, and you’re a major shareholder. If the shares are changed to my name, the group will definitely make an announcement. Aren’t you afraid that the stock price will crash? Most importantly, what do I need so much money for?”

Li Yifu was stunned for a moment before he reacted and said with a bitter smile,””You’re right, martial granduncle ... Money in the secular world is meaningless to you ...”He said.

When Ling Qingxue heard this, she thought to herself that he was being too pretentious! RUO Fei’s own company was worth at most two billion Yuan, which was less than a fraction of the Kyushu group’s value. How could secular money be meaningless to RUO Fei?

“I know,” Li Yifu continued.”Senior granduncle, you started a company just to gain experience in the world of mortals and to temper your state of mind so that you can lay a foundation for your Future Foundation establishment. It was this disciple who was rude and almost destroyed senior granduncle’s cultivation plan ...”

Ling Qingxue’s jaw dropped.”There was actually such an explanation? Invisible posturing was the most fatal!

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He didn’t really care about the amount of money, but he didn’t start paradise Corporation for the sake of “training in the world of mortals”. In the beginning, it was to make money, but later, it was more for fun. Besides, there were so many employees in the company. The development of the company was not only related to his wealth, but also the jobs of hundreds of people.

Moreover, he had made up his mind from the beginning to let the professional manager team take care of the company, so he would not need to spend too much energy on it.

But all of this had nothing to do with him treating money like dirt.

Of course, he was also happy that Li Yifu misunderstood him. Otherwise, once Li Yifu became stubborn, he might really pester him to transfer all the shares to him.

Hence, Xia ruofei revealed a mysterious smile and said,””In the future, don’t mention things like transferring shares again ...”

“Yes, martial granduncle, this disciple knows his mistake!” Li Yifu lowered his head and said.
