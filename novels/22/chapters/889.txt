Chapter 890: A small harvest of wormgrass (3)

Translator: 549690339

After cautiously moving all the bats and moths into another plastic container, Xia ruofei asked Xia Qing to start collecting the wormgrass.

Although Xia ruofei had read a lot of information about wormgrass, he had never put it into practice. Professional things should be left to the professionals. Xia Qing’s ” database ” had ready-made information on the collection of precious medicinal materials like wormgrass.

Xia Qing had already prepared a small and exquisite shovel. He carefully and gently began to dig at the outermost part of the soil. His movements were very gentle, for fear of damaging the Cordyceps in the soil.

The soil was very soft, and Xia Qing quickly dug out one of the wormgrass. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Then, Xia Qing picked up a soft brush and carefully cleaned the soil on the surface of the caterpillar fungus. A huge caterpillar fungus was presented in front of Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei took it and looked at it. Just from the size, this wormgrass was much thicker than the level 1 grass that he had bought from Gesang some time ago. It felt heavy in his hand.

Xia Qing also put down her tools and came over. She said in surprise, ” “Master, this worm grass is of extremely high quality! Congratulations, master!”

Xia Qing pointed at the wormgrass and explained, ” “Master, please take a look! Its surface is very yellow and clear, and the whole body is transparent and oily. The ring pattern is very clear with the characteristics of’ three narrow and one wide’. Out of the eight pairs of feet, the middle four pairs are very obvious, and the last three pairs of feet have basically all degenerated. There are also brownish-red eyes on the head, and the color of the grass head is also quite pure ...”

Then, Xia Qing leaned closer and sniffed it hard. She said in surprise, ” “Even the rich butter fragrance was preserved! It’s even more authentic than the most authentic Cordyceps ...”

“Xia Qing, it seems like my method of bringing the Highland plants, soil, Cordyceps, and fungi into the medium is feasible,”Xia ruofei said happily.

“That’s right!”Xia Qing nodded repeatedly. The characteristics of the wormgrass have been preserved, and the environment of the spirit map world is obviously better than the outside world, so the quality of the wormgrass has also been greatly improved!”

“Will the medicinal properties of these wormgrass also be improved? ” Xia ruofei asked.

“That’s for sure!” Xia Qing said proudly, ” this worm grass is definitely a treasure in the secular world. Even if a cultivator were to consume it, it would still have extraordinary effects! ”

Xia ruofei laughed happily when he heard this. His hard work in Tibet had not been in vain.

Other than the difference in the flow of time between the mountain and sea realm and the Archean realm, the overall environment and the concentration of spirit Qi were basically the same. Thus, if one could successfully cultivate high-grade wormgrass in the Archean realm, it was only a matter of time before the wormgrass in the mountain and sea realm matured.

The only thing that Xia ruofei was concerned about was the quality of the wormgrass.

In addition to the above quality characteristics, there was another important factor in measuring the quality of Cordyceps.

On average, 2000 wormgrass could reach a weight of 1000 grams, which was Level 1 grass. In the outside world, Level 1 grass was sold at a sky-high price of hundreds of thousands of Yuan per 1000 grams.

And if a single wormgrass was heavier, it would be even more priceless, and the price would be even more outrageous.

So Xia ruofei immediately said, ” Xia Qing, dig out all the wormgrass in the plastic box and clean them up. Let’s weigh them. Let’s see how many wormgrass can reach a thousand grams! ”
