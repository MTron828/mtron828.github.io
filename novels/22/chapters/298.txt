Chapter 299: Thriving farmy...1

“Brother Liang.” “Ruofei, my cousin – grandfather is leaving for home today. He’ll probably be in Sanshan city tomorrow or the day after.” “How’s the situation with the Phoebe zhennan material?” Liang Qichao asked impatiently. “I’m ready!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “Aiya, that’s great!” Liang Qichao said excitedly,”ruofei, thank you so much! I owe you a big favor!” “You’re welcome ...” Xia ruofei chuckled.”Brother Liang, do you want to come over and take a look at the material first?” “No need! “I trust you ...” Liang Qichao said.”My family has to go to Shen Cheng to welcome the old man today, so I don’t have time to come over. Tell me the rough data of the Phoebe zhennan material!” I’ll tell the old man ...” “No problem, I’ll send it to you on WeChat later!” Xia ruofei said readily. “Alright!” Liang Qichao said,”hehe! Even my father doesn’t know about this! He had been depressed for the past few days! I’m really looking forward to his expression when he hears that I’ve also found a big scoop in two days ...” After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei was very excited. Good things keep happening recently! He had just successfully obtained the branches of the Da Hong Pao parent tree, and the Phoebe zhennan material was about to be sold. He felt great just thinking about how he could earn a large sum of money. It was already evening when the car got off the highway. So, the convoy went straight back to the villa in guling. Elder song asked manager Lu to arrange for li Zhifu to be hospitalized the next day. Xia ruofei’s car was parked at the guling courtyard. He was eager to go home, so he politely declined elder song’s invitation to stay for dinner. He drove away from the courtyard and returned to Taoyuan farm. When Xia ruofei’s car drove into the gate of the farm, the farm workers were getting off work and walking out. The moment Cao tieshu saw Xia ruofei, he immediately stopped the car and excitedly told him that the vegetables on the farm could be harvested. Xia ruofei couldn’t resist Cao tieshu’s enthusiasm. He parked the car at the side and followed him to the vegetable greenhouse. Cao tieshu pointed at the green vegetables in the greenhouse and said,””Boss, I’ve grown vegetables for half my life, but this is the first time I’ve seen such good growth and such high quality vegetables! That high – tech seed is really powerful!” Xia ruofei looked at the vegetables and felt a sense of achievement. He smiled and said,””Old Cao, this is also because of your good work!” Cao tieshu chuckled.”We were just taking care of the vegetable field on a daily basis. We didn’t do anything ... Besides, these vegetables are too worrying. There’s no need to prevent pests at all. We don’t have much to live after a day ...” Xia ruofei took a closer look. This vegetable really did not have a single worm hole. The green color of the leaves was very pure, and there was a faint feeling of crystal – Clear, as if it was carved out of Jade. It even felt unreal. This had completely reached the standard of growing vegetables in the space! Xia ruofei said happily,”old Cao, well done!” How about this, from tomorrow onwards, we’ll supply the vegetables to Xi Jiang Yue club and Ling Ji restaurant from the vegetable greenhouse. I’ll get little fatty to give you the specific data later. ” “No problem!” Cao tieshu laughed. After working for a few months, they had finally achieved some results. Cao tieshu had been looking forward to this day for a long time. Otherwise, with such a high salary and an easy job, the few workers would feel bad. Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”from tomorrow morning, arrange for the workers to take turns to pick the vegetables. They have to come over at about FiveO’ clock. Then, prepare the vegetables according to the demand of each family. Generally, they will send a car over to pick up the vegetables before six – thirty.” “Alright! Boss, don’t worry!” Cao tieshu said. Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”yes. For the workers who came to pick vegetables in the morning, we’ll pay you overtime. You’ll be paid overtime.” “No need, no need!” Cao tieshu hurriedly said,”there’s not much work in the day anyway. We, the older people, all get up early in the morning. Why do we need overtime pay!” “That won’t do!” Xia ruofei said,”this is an additional task. After the cold storage is built, you can pick the fruits a day earlier. Before that, you have to come here early every day. Besides, it’s only temporary that you’re not busy with work. When the fish ponds and orchards are built, you’ll have more and more work to do. ” “But you don’t need to be paid for overtime either!” Cao tieshu said very firmly,”our current salary is already high enough. Everyone feels that they have energy but no place to use it. We are sorry for the salary that the boss gave us!” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but find it funny. These villagers were really simple and honest. They didn’t even want extra money. He saw that Cao tieshu’s attitude was very firm, so he could not be too insistent. Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”how about this, old Cao?” When the time comes, make a schedule and everyone will take turns picking vegetables in the morning. As long as the workers come in the morning, they can take half a day off in the morning! This way, everyone will have time to deal with any work at home. ” Cao tieshu grinned and said,”deal!” Then we’ll do as the boss says!” “Boss, you have to prepare the next batch of seeds in advance. After the vegetables are harvested, we will immediately start to grow the seedlings and plant a new batch of vegetables,” Cao tieshu said. This constant – Temperature greenhouse could be planted all year round. When the mature vegetables were harvested, they would start to grow seedlings. This way, new vegetables could keep up and form a virtuous cycle. Xia ruofei nodded.”Calculate the required amount and report it to chubby boy. I’ll go and prepare it in a day or two!” “Alright!” Cao tieshu said,”boss, it must be this kind of high – tech seed!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”don’t worry!” If we’re going to do it, we’ll do it with high – tech!” Cao tieshu couldn’t help but chuckle. Cao tieshu then thought of another matter and said,””Boss, it’s going to be spring soon, so we have to prepare the fruit trees in advance. I think we should be able to plant them in a month or so. If we miss it, it will delay us for a year! There was still a fish pond that was still empty! Our hearts ache when we see this. When are you going to get some fish?” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but have a headache. There were indeed many things to do, and these things couldn’t be passed on to others. He had to do it himself. No matter if it was fruit or fish, they had to be transformed by the spatial spirit pond water or the petal solution of the wondrous flower before they could be planted. If he wanted to take the high – Quality route, these were necessary. Otherwise, he might as well not do it. “I know. I’ll be in the three mountains for the next few days, so I’ll focus on dealing with these things!” Xia ruofei said,”old Cao, you’ll be busy when the time comes! If you don’t have enough manpower, you have to tell me in time, so I can go and recruit more people!” “I know, boss!” Cao tieshu said,”then I’ll go back first! I still have to cook for my wife!” “Go back quickly!” Xia ruofei said,”say hello to sister – in – Law for me!” “Alright!” After Cao tieshu left, Xia ruofei strolled around the vegetable greenhouse once more before he came out and drove back to the villa. As soon as the car stopped, lightning, who had not seen Xia ruofei for a few days, immediately pounced on him affectionately, shaking its head and wagging its tail. Xia ruofei hugged lightning and rubbed its smooth fur while shouting,””Little fatty!” “Swish!” Pang Hao came out of the house when he heard the noise.”Ruofei is back!” Xia ruofei told pang Hao about what Cao tieshu had just said and asked him to give Cao tieshu a copy of the supply data tonight. In addition, Xia ruofei also asked pang Hao and Cao tieshu to calculate how much surplus there was in the vegetable greenhouse other than the two food and beverage companies, and how many extra vegetables they could provide each day. Xia ruofei was considering that the vegetable greenhouse had basically entered a virtuous cycle and it was time to start supplying to the MA family’s Hengfeng group. Both parties had already signed the contract and were just waiting for the vegetables to arrive. After he was done, Xia ruofei let lightning play on her own. Then, he bade farewell to pang Hao and ye Lingyun, took his little bag, and went upstairs in a hurry. He couldn’t wait to go into the medium and cut out the precious branches of the big red – robed mother tree ...
