3099 Effect (1)

Liu Hong and Wang Shan had never dreamed that they would one day receive such treatment. Elder Xia was personally making tea for them, and the sect leader was boiling water for them.

The two of them were so terrified that they didn’t even know where to put their hands.

Xia ruofei used the boiling water to heat up the tea set as he said,””Since we want to test the effects of the spiritual tea, we must use the best method to make the tea. You all stay at the side and drink that cup of tea later. That will be the greatest contribution to the sect!”

In a short while, Xia ruofei was done brewing the tea.

This time, he took out two tea sets and made tea leaves from different wild tea trees.

Xia ruofei pointed at the two cups of fragrant tea and smiled.””Liu Hong, Wang Shan, take a cup each and drink. Don’t worry about anything else.”

“Yes! Elder Xia!” The two of them replied in unison.

Since they already knew that the worst result was that the spirit tea had no effect, or that the effect was not obvious, and that they would no longer have any effect on the spirit tea in the future, the two of them naturally did not have so many concerns. They went up and took a cup each, drinking it without hesitation.

They didn’t even have the mood to savor the Taste of the Wild tea. After drinking it, they looked at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei smiled.”You don’t have to think about anything. Just sit down with your legs crossed. If there’s any effect, you’ll naturally feel it.”

“Yes! Elder Xia!”

The two of them quickly sat down.

Xia ruofei smiled and said to Luo Qingfeng,””Sect leader Luo, the tea has been brewed. It’s a waste not to drink it. Let’s drink some too!”

Since there were outsiders, Xia ruofei could not call him ‘Qingfeng’. Even if he was the great elder, he was still under the leadership of the sect leader!

“Alright,” Luo Qingfeng nodded and said.

Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng also held their teacups and slowly sipped their tea.

In fact, Luo Qingfeng was very nervous at the moment. Xia ruofei, on the other hand, was very calm.

Even if this wild tea didn’t have any effect or wasn’t as effective as the one from the first heaven society, Xia ruofei would just have to wait a little longer. He firmly believed that as long as it was aged enough, the wild tea should have an effect. It had nothing to do with the tea – making technique, not to mention that the taste of the tea leaves made by Xia Qing was very similar to the wild tea of the first heaven society.

Of course, Xia ruofei was very confident in the wild tea that he had planted in the medium.

He sipped his tea calmly and observed Liu Hong and Wang Shan at the same time.

After the two of them finished drinking their tea and sat down, their expressions changed slightly, and then they involuntarily entered a state of cultivation.

There was a chance! Xia ruofei thought.

Qingfeng Luo was also looking at Liu Hong and Wang Shan. He held the cup of tea to his mouth, but did not take a sip. He just maintained his posture and stared at the two without looking away.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but find it funny. He filled his teacup and said,””Sect leader Luo, the tea will get cold if you don’t drink it ...”

Luo Qingfeng felt like he had just woken up from a dream. He awkwardly finished the tea in his hand.

Xia ruofei picked up the teapot and poured another cup for Luo Qingfeng. Luo Qingfeng stood up in fear and said,””Elder Xia, I’ll do it myself ...”

Although Liu Hong and Wang Shan had already entered a state of cultivation, Luo Qingfeng did not know if they were completely unaware of the situation outside, so he did not dare to call Xia ruofei master. He was more or less not used to this and felt uncomfortable no matter what he did.

Xia ruofei poured a cup of tea for Luo Qingfeng with a smile and said,””Don’t be too nervous. This wild tea is not dangerous. ”

“I know that ...” Luo Qingfeng said with a bitter smile.”Maybe it’s because I’m too concerned ... Elder Xia, look at Liu Hong and Wang Shan’s condition ... Is the wild tea already effective?”

If the wild tea was successfully planted, the star Seizer sect would naturally benefit the most. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

After all, wild tea was only most effective for Qi condensation cultivators, and each person could only drink it once. Although Xia ruofei was not a loner, he did not have many cultivators close to him. The star Seizer sect had a large number of members.

Therefore, once wild tea was proven to be effective, it would have a huge effect on the star Seizer sect’s strength.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Of course, there will be an effect. The two of them have already entered a state of cultivation. However, the most important thing is whether the effect will meet our expectations. This is the most important thing.” Let’s wait and see! Don’t worry, I think they’ll have to cultivate for a long time!”

“Alright ...” Luo Qingfeng nodded and said.

Xia ruofei saw that Luo Qingfeng was so nervous, and his eyes did not leave Liu Hong and Wang Shan, so he simply did not chat with him. He just sipped his tea and waited. As for Luo Qingfeng, he would let him drink by himself. In any case, he had just made two pots of tea, just enough for each person to have one.

Liu Hong and Wang Shan cultivated for about half an hour, and then their auras rose sharply in less than three minutes.

Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng looked at each other with a hint of surprise. Obviously, they had both broken through their cultivation realms.

The moment the two of them broke through, even the spiritual Qi in star – picking tower, which had the densest spiritual Qi in the sect, began to drop significantly.

After all, two eighth Qi layer cultivators broke through to the ninth Qi layer at the same time, so the consumption of spiritual Qi was very large.
