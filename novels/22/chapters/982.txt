Chapter 983: Lady song arrives (3)

Translator: 549690339

When Tian Ming Yi was swept by that cold gaze, he couldn’t help but feel a chill in his heart.

Song Wei grew up in a high – ranking family, so she naturally had a sense of authority. It was just that she was usually quiet and did not show off her abilities. However, she was a little angry just now, so she unconsciously released her authority.

Tian Ming Yi was a little unhappy with his momentary timidity. Wasn’t she just a pretty girl? Could it be that he had something to fear?

Thinking about this, Tian Mingyi also looked at Song Wei, not to be outdone.

“If you didn’t tell me, I would’ve thought you were from the Public Security Bureau!” Song Wei said coldly. Even the manager of the store didn’t stop me. What right do you have to restrict my personal freedom?”

Song Wei turned around and walked inside.

“You ...” Tian Mingyi angrily shouted.

“Vice – Chancellor Tian, director Wu, you’ve misunderstood ...” Manager Lu quickly explained,”this lady is our Chairman’s guest, she’s not here to spend money ...”

“You didn’t come to the restaurant to eat?” Tian Mingyi looked at manager Lu with a half – Smile and asked,”do you think I’m an idiot?”

Inspector Wu frowned. He didn’t want to cause any more trouble. He could just find a few reasons to fine the shop tens of thousands of Yuan and close it down for ten to twenty days. Then, the shop would be half ruined.

Therefore, he gave Tian Mingyi a look and said,””Alright, manager Lu, let’s cut the crap and start the inspection!”

……

While Xia ruofei, Ling Xiaotian, and Ling Qingxue were making tea and chatting in flying Snow Pavilion, Song Wei was led to the private room by the waiter.

As soon as Xia ruofei saw Song Wei, he immediately stood up with a smile and greeted her,””Song Wei is here! Come in and sit ... Why didn’t you come with Secretary song?”

Song Wei gave Xia ruofei a grateful look and said with a smile,”I was out shopping in the afternoon, so I came straight here.”

When Xia ruofei stood up, Ling Xiaotian and Ling Qingxue stood up as well. The father and daughter had heard the conversation between Xia ruofei and Song Wei and guessed that this lady was probably a family member of Secretary song.

Xia ruofei also quickly smiled and said,”let me introduce you!” “Song Wei, this is the chairman of Ling Ji restaurant, Mr. Ling Xiaotian. Ling Ji private kitchen is one of the high – end stores Under Ling Ji restaurant. This beautiful woman is uncle Ling’s daughter, Ling Qingxue, the Vice President of Ling Ji Restaurant Group ...”

Then, Xia ruofei smiled and added,””She’s also my girlfriend!”

“Uncle Ling, Qingxue, this is Song Wei. She’s Secretary song Qiming’s precious daughter,” Xia ruofei introduced.

Song Wei was stunned when she heard that. She felt a tinge of sourness in her heart, but she didn’t even notice it. She quickly adjusted her mood and greeted the two with a gentle smile on her face.

When Ling Xiaotian and Ling Qingxue heard that Song Wei was Secretary song’s daughter, they were naturally very enthusiastic.

Only then did Song Wei know why Xia ruofei had arranged for tonight’s dinner to be at Ling Ji private kitchen. It turned out that he had such a relationship with Ling Ji F & B group.

She quickly recalled the scene at the entrance and asked,””President Ling, when I came in just now, I think I saw a joint inspection team outside! What’s going on?”Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com
