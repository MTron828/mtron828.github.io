Chapter 1902 Successful infiltration_1

“Done!” Xu Yougang closed his laptop and said in a relaxed manner.

“Squad leader Xu, did you find anything?” Wang Chong immediately asked.

“I’ve confirmed that woman’s identity!”Xu Yougang nodded. Her name was Fang Chenchen, and she was a female host on Sanshan TV station’s City Channel! His popularity has been rising rapidly in the past few months, and it happened not long after Liu haojun took office in Changping!”

“Then it matches!” Wang Chong said excitedly,”squad leader Xu, our next goal is clear!”

Xu Yougang nodded. He stared at the Western restaurant across the street for a while and said,””Wang Chong, I think that we should head back to the West Lake residence and try to enter the residential area!”

“What do you mean?” Wang Chong asked.

Xu Yougang analyzed.”There’s no doubt that the West Lake Mansion is where Liu haojun and Fang Chenchen met up. If we want to get useful information, we must first determine which house they are staying in.”

“That’s right!” Wang Chong nodded in agreement.

“Liu haojun has already asked the driver to go back to Changping,” Xu Yougang continued.”What does this mean?”

“This means that he won’t be returning to Changping tonight. He’ll be spending the night at the West Lake residence!” Wang Chong said after a moment of thought.

“That’s right!” Xu Yougang said,”this is an opportunity for us! As long as we sneak into the district in advance, it’s possible to get their exact address when they return! The premise is that we have to have someone waiting in the community before they go home after dinner. Only then can we find an opportunity!”

“I fully agree!” Wang Chong nodded. Squad leader Xu, then ... Let’s go back to the West Lake Mansion first and let squad leader Zeng and Aijun keep an eye on them. What do you think?” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Let’s do this!” “Call liangzi,” Xu Yougang said.

“Alright!” Wang Chong said.

Xu Yougang took another look at the Western restaurant, started the car, and drove in the direction of the West Lake Mansion.

The prey had already been targeted by the shrewd Hunter, and this time, it was difficult to escape.

When they returned to the vicinity of the West Lake residence, Xu Yougang turned off the engine and said to Wang Chong,””Wang Chong, I’ve decided to personally enter the estate. You’ll be responsible for keeping watch on the perimeter. When they return, let liangzi take charge of the perimeter. If anything happens, we’ll communicate immediately,”

“Squad leader Xu, why don’t I go in?” Wang Chong asked. You can stay outside and take charge. ”

Xu Yougang shook his head and said,”we need to be flexible this time. I have more experience than you. It’s decided!”

After that, Xu Yougang got up and went to the back seat. He opened a canvas bag and began to pick out equipment from it.

Soon, Xu Yougang was ready. He opened the door and got out of the car. He put a small Bluetooth headset in his ear and said,””Let’s try the walkie – talkie. ”

Since Xia ruofei had provided sufficient funds, the equipment that Xu Yougang bought this time was very advanced. For example, the walkie – talkie was very small and connected with Bluetooth, so ordinary people could not tell at all.

“Alright!” Wang Chong also picked up a set of walkie – talkie equipment, turned on the power, and adjusted the frequency. Then, he attached the micro – Microphone to his clothes. The two of them tried a few times to make sure that the communication was smooth. After that, Xu Yougang strode toward the direction of the residential area opposite.

This kind of high – end residential area had very strict access control. The owners all used their cards to enter and exit. Visitors not only had to report the name of the owner they were visiting, but the property management would also check and inquire through the call system. Therefore, Xu Yougang didn’t plan to sneak in from the main entrance. He went directly to the side of the community.

It was already night time. Under the cover of the night, he walked along the road outside the wall of the community at a moderate pace.

Xu Yougang had memorized the sketch that Zeng Liang and the others had drawn earlier. Looking at it now, he realized that the sketch was very accurate. He soon found a blind spot of the surveillance cameras. At the same time, the street lights were dim.

Xu Yougang took out a cigarette and stood by the roadside, smoking it as if he was waiting for someone.

After a group of people walked past, Xu Yougang looked around and immediately threw the cigarette on the ground. He jumped out like a leopard and grabbed the iron fence. With a strong force, his body immediately flew into the air and just happened to fly over the sharp tip of the fence.

At the same time, Xu You had just released his hand. After landing, he rolled to dissipate the force and hid in the shadow under a tree.

The whole process only took two to three seconds. It was clean and neat. Even if Xia ruofei was there, he would give Xu Yougang a thumbs – up when he saw Xu Yougang’s tactical movements.

Xu Yougang quickly observed the surrounding situation. This area happened to be a relatively quiet place in the community, and there were not many people around.

He tidied up his clothes and walked out as if nothing had happened. He walked on the road of the community with a relaxed expression.

Of course, Xu You had put on some makeup before he took action.

He was wearing a pair of black – rimmed glasses and had a thick stubble on his face. Through some makeup, although the shape of his face did not change significantly, some minor adjustments made it seem as if he had become a different person. Unless it was Zeng Liang and other comrades who had been with him all the time, even if people who knew him walked past him, they would not be able to notice.

Even Xu Yougang’s walking posture was different from usual. This was also a compulsory course for an excellent Scout, and he had done his best in disguise.
