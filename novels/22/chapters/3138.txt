3139 Floating point image (2)

Xia ruofei sat down at the conference table and placed the rising Dragon Token on the table with its back facing up.

Chen Xuan, Mu Sheng, and Liu Mansha came over to take a closer look at the Suan ni. The floating Points on the token were the most likely to contain the secret of the rising Dragon Order. Other than the two words, there were no other decorative patterns carved on the other parts. Thus, everyone’s attention was naturally placed on these Floating Points.

Xia ruofei carefully reached out his hand and was about to touch the floating Points ...

Xia ruofei had already heard about the changes in the token from master Yuntai, so he was not as surprised as Chen Xuan and the others.

Of course, it was also the first time he saw the tokens put together, but his attention was more on the Fuyu point that Yuntai scholar had mentioned.

Xia ruofei didn’t see the floating point that Yuntai scholar had mentioned on the side of the token. He thought that the floating point should be on the back.

Everyone’s attention was attracted by the changes in the token. A huge surprise had filled their hearts for so many years. In order to study the five sacred tokens, the three sects had invested a lot of manpower and resources, but there had been no progress at all. Today, they finally saw the light of hope.

Staying the same was the most despairing thing, as change meant new opportunities.

Mu Sheng kept staring at the token, as if trying to recall something.

Suddenly, he pointed at the token and shouted,”Rising Dragon ... Rising Dragon ... Could this be the rising Dragon Token?”

Chen Xuan and Liu Mansha’s faces lit up with joy upon hearing this. Liu Mansha hurriedly asked,””Sect leader mu, do you know the origin of this token?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be surprised. It was the first time he heard someone other than the layman of the cloud platform call the five sacred writs “Rising Dragon writs”. He couldn’t help but look forward to it. After all, the layman of the cloud platform didn’t know much about the rising Dragon writs. In the early days, his cultivation was too low, so he wasn’t qualified to participate in the study of the rising Dragon writs. It would be great if Mu Sheng could learn more about the rising Dragon writs from other channels.

“I’m afraid everyone will be disappointed,” Mu Sheng said.”I don’t know much about the rising Dragon Order. I can’t even be sure if this is the rising Dragon Order ...”

Mu Sheng paused for a moment and said,””Actually, I saw it in a remnant of an ancient book. However, the description of the rising Dragon Order in the remnant of the book was only a few words. It said that ‘the leaders of the five sects gathered at the flying dragon Peak to study the rising Dragon Order’. I only just saw the two words ‘Rising Dragon’ on the token and tried my best to recall that there was such a sentence in the ancient records ...”

Liu Mansha couldn’t help but feel a little disappointed when she heard this. She couldn’t help but ask,”Sect leader mu, think about it carefully. Is that really the only thing you said?”

In fact, Liu Mansha was also confused because she was too concerned. Mu Sheng was a veteran golden core cultivator and basically had a photographic memory. He was not like ordinary people in the secular world, whose memory would become blurry after a long time. Perhaps his impression would become a little shallow, but as long as he tried to recall it seriously, he would definitely not remember wrongly. Since he said that there was only one sentence, he was basically sure that there was no more content.

Mu Sheng smiled bitterly and said,”Valley master Liu, I’m not old and muddle – headed. My memory isn’t so messed up. I’m very sure that the record about the rising Dragon Order in the ancient book only has this sentence.” If Valley Head Liu doesn’t believe me, I can even contact the sect immediately and have someone send the fragment of the ancient record to the three mountains. ”

Liu Mansha couldn’t help but feel a little embarrassed. She quickly said,”Sect leader mu, you’ve misunderstood me. I didn’t mean it that way ...”

Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan were considered the younger generation, so they would not get involved in this.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””I feel that regardless of whether this thing is called the five Holy Order or the rising Dragon Order, let’s first take a look at what’s so special about this combined order!”

Xia ruofei’s suggestion was agreed upon by everyone.

Liu Mansha even cast a grateful look at Xia ruofei to urge him to change the topic and help her out of her predicament.

The token was a little bigger than an adult’s palm, and there were only two embossed words “Rising Dragon” on this side. Other than that, there were no patterns or anything else.

These two words were written in seal script. Just as Liu Mansha had said, the strokes were vigorous and powerful. If one paid close attention, one could even feel the imposing aura coming from it.

It could be said that just these two words were enough to show that the token that was formed was extraordinary.

However, the two words ‘Rising Dragon’ were only full of vigor. Other than that, everyone could not see anything special about it, let alone discovering the legendary secret of the complete ancient cultivator relic.

Xia ruofei naturally picked up the rising Dragon Token on the conference table. He pretended to look at the front and then turned it over.

When the densely packed Floating Points on the back of the card were presented in front of him, he could not help but narrow his eyes, and a hint of surprise flashed in his eyes.

The floating Points that scholar Yuntai said would change once every 50 years were all distributed on the back.

Chen Xuan and the rest were also looking at the rising Dragon Token. Hence, after Xia ruofei flipped through the scroll, everyone was naturally attracted to the floating Points. “Senior Yuntai ...” Xia ruofei tried to use his spiritual power to directly communicate with layman dan tai in the mysterious ore space in the cave of the mountain sea realm in the spirit map space.

However, there was no sound. It was obvious that this seclusion madman was still in deep seclusion, completely isolated from the outside world.

Xia ruofei really couldn’t understand it. In fact, scholar Yuntai was already a wisp of soul without a body. What was the use of closed – door cultivation all day?

Originally, he wanted to let layman Yuntai see this floating point pattern, but since he couldn’t contact him, he had to give up.

Xia ruofei looked at the floating Points on the back of the rising Dragon Order. The floating Points almost covered the entire back of the order. They were so dense that he could not see any pattern. If someone with trypophobia saw such a pattern, he would probably have goosebumps all over his body.

Xia ruofei sat down at the conference table and placed the rising Dragon Token on the table with its back facing up.

Chen Xuan, Mu Sheng, and Liu Mansha came over to take a closer look at the Suan ni. The floating Points on the token were the most likely to contain the secret of the rising Dragon Order. Other than the two words, there were no other decorative patterns carved on the other parts. Thus, everyone’s attention was naturally placed on these Floating Points.

Xia ruofei reached out carefully and was about to touch the floating Points. Chen Xuan and the rest were also looking at the rising Dragon Token.
