Chapter 1912 Xia ruofei’s counterattack (1)

“No need, boss!” Xu Yougang quickly said,”you’ve given us too much ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand,”you deserve this!” Let’s not discuss this anymore. Besides, you can’t make decisions for your brothers! Go back and discuss it with them. Let me know when you have made a decision. You brothers can find a place with beautiful scenery to relax. I still need you guys when I come back!”

Xu Yougang saw that Xia ruofei was so determined, so he had to say,””Alright! Then, thank you, boss ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”next time when we meet in private, just call me” brother Xia “like Lei Hu!”

“Alright, brother Xia!” Xu Yougang said.

In fact, Xu Yougang was a few years older than Xia ruofei, so he should be two or three years older than Xia ruofei. However, he still called her that naturally.

In fact, when he was on the phone, although the possibility of being monitored was very small, Xu Yougang was still very cautious. He usually only called Xia ruofei “boss” and tried not to exchange sensitive words over the phone.

Xu Yougang didn’t stay in the teahouse for long. After drinking a few cups of tea, he got up and left. He said that he would arrange to investigate Liu Dong later, but in fact, he did not want anyone to notice his contact with Xia ruofei.

After Xu Yougang went back, he gathered his other comrades and passed on Xia ruofei’s instructions to them. Then, he readjusted the focus of his work. He told Liu haojun and Fang Chenchen not to keep an eye on them. Instead, he assigned someone to keep an eye on the West Lake Mansion. This was because most of the time, the people they wanted to meet on a date would come here.

The remaining three were fully focused on investigating Liu Dong’s situation.

Of course, everyone still took turns on duty. Otherwise, the people who stayed behind to guard the rental house would have to keep an eye on the movements of unit 1902. They would basically not be able to rest for 24 hours, and even iron Men would not be able to stand it.

After the re – arrangement of the staff, the investigation was very effective. It took Xu Yougang about a day and a half to figure out Liu Dong’s situation. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Rain listening teahouse.

Xu Yougang had asked Xia ruofei to come here again.

Under normal circumstances, they could have communicated over the phone. However, it would be difficult to report so much information over the phone and it would be easy to leak information. Moreover, he still needed Xia ruofei’s next instructions, so he chose to come out and talk.

As soon as Xu You entered the room, he took out a brown envelope from his bag and handed it to Xia ruofei with both hands. He said,””Brother Xia, Liu Dong’s information is basically all here ...” He said.

Xia ruofei nodded and opened the envelope.

There was a stack of paper documents and a few photos inside. Xia ruofei browsed through the photos first, then quickly read through the documents.

“Lao Xu, now that we know about Liu Dong’s situation, do you have any ideas?” Xia ruofei asked after some thought.

Xu Yougang had also thought about it. He said,””Brother Xia, from what we know, Liu Dong is an honest man. He was Fang Chenchen’s University classmate and he put in a lot of effort when he was pursuing her. After their marriage, Chenchen has always been the dominant party. In addition, Fang Chenchen’s career has been doing well recently, while he’s just an ordinary technical staff in the business. In general, in family life, he seems a little ... Useless!”

At this point, Xu Yougang suddenly changed the topic and said,””But I think that’s just a superficial phenomenon.”

Xia ruofei smiled and said with great interest,””Continue!”

“Yes! The reason why Liu Dong is so obedient to Fang Chenchen is because he cares about her. Once he finds out that he has been betrayed by his wife, this kind of love will probably turn into a strong hatred. The more honest a person is, the more intense his reaction will be!” Xu Yougang said,”also, we noticed a piece of information that might be more important ...”

“Don’t say it yet, let me guess!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you’re talking about Liu Dong’s family background, right?”

“Yes, I am!” Xu Yougang said,”Liu Dong’s hometown is in San Shan’s Ping Zhang County. Although it’s not a rich and influential family, the relatives in his family are deeply rooted. Basically, the entire town has a lot of relatives. He grew up in this kind of environment with a strong clan atmosphere. Liu Dong must be very traditional in his bones. He must have a very low tolerance for his wife cheating on him!”

“And ...” Xu Yougang continued,”although Liu Dong is an honest technician, he has a relative called Liu Da. In terms of seniority, Liu Dong is Liu DA’s uncle. This Liu Da is quite popular in Sanshan. A few years ago, he came to the city from pingzhang to make a living. I heard that he is very good at fighting and is highly regarded by the boss. Over the years, he has made a lot of money and has gradually begun to clear his name. However, no matter how much he tries to clear his name, he can’t change his social habits.””If we can get Da Liu involved in this matter, it’s very likely that we’ll be able to expand our influence ...”

Xia ruofei looked at Xu Yougang with satisfaction and said,””Not bad, old Xu! You’re not simple to be able to analyze so much with the limited information you have!”

“If brother Xia didn’t remind me to focus on Liu Dong’s situation, I wouldn’t have thought so much,” Xu Yougang said, feeling a little guilty.”According to my plan at that time, I would have just uploaded the photos and videos we got onto the internet. As for whether it would work or not, I would leave it to fate ...”
