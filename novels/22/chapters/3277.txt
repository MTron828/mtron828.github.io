3278 The journey (1)

Xia ruofei forced himself to calm down and not think about Ling Qingxue.

He knew very well that the more difficult the situation was, the more he couldn’t mess up, or it would only get worse.

Furthermore, this was not the worst situation. At least, there was no danger in his current position. If Ling Qingxue had come to such an environment like him, she would be safe for the time being.

Xia ruofei took a few deep breaths and gradually calmed down.

He first raised his hand to look at his watch. After pressing a few buttons, he saw the information on the watch. The air quality here was very good and completely suitable for human breathing. The surrounding temperature was also very suitable, about 23 or 24 degrees.

Hence, Xia ruofei turned on the lock and removed the spacesuit’s mask. He took a few breaths and confirmed that there was no problem.

He then took off his spacesuit and put it into the spirit map space.

In fact, the moment they entered the mystic realm, Xia ruofei could already feel the huge difference between the environment on the moon and the one on the moon. First of all, the gravity here was much stronger than on the moon and was basically the same as on earth. If it were not for the fact that the physical strength of cultivators was far superior to ordinary people, they would have found it difficult to move even a single step in their heavy spacesuits. Besides, even though he was wearing a spacesuit, Xia ruofei’s spiritual power could still feel that the spiritual Qi in this secret realm was very rich, even more so than that on Peach Blossom Island.

After taking off the spacesuit’s mask, this feeling became more intuitive. The rich spirit Qi hit his face, making his mind clear.

Of course, according to Xia ruofei’s intuitive feeling, the concentration of spiritual Qi in this secret realm was still a little worse than that in the spirit map space.

However, the difference wasn’t that great.

In the world of cultivation on earth, this was definitely a cultivation paradise, or even a cultivation sanctuary.

Even the best cultivation place in the heavenly sect couldn’t have such dense spiritual Qi. Only by using a spiritual gathering formation to gather the surrounding spiritual Qi in a small area at all costs could such an environment be formed temporarily.

After Xia ruofei kept the spacesuit, he took out a set of ancient clothes and changed out of the undergarments that he was originally wearing under the spacesuit. These undergarments were quite tight – fitting; he couldn’t possibly run around in a set of ‘tight – fitting’ clothes! The reason why he had changed into an ancient costume was, on one hand, for the convenience of moving around. On the other hand, considering that this Mystic realm had existed for at least a few thousand years, no one could be sure if there were cultivators in it. So, it was more convenient to wear an ancient costume than modern clothes. If he really encountered an ancient cultivator, at least he wouldn’t be regarded as an alien.

After quickly changing his clothes, Xia ruofei checked his surroundings.

The biggest feature of this place was the rich spiritual energy. Other than that, there was only a sea of green. No matter which direction he looked, he could only see the green grassland that stretched into the distance.

Moreover, to Xia ruofei, the grassland was too flat. It could be said that there were no ups and downs, just like Minecraft’s super flat mode.

Apart from that, it was worth noting that this place was really very, very quiet.

It was reasonable to say that no matter how quiet the grasslands on earth were, there would still be some insects chirping in the grass.

However, there was no sound at all here. It was so quiet that Xia ruofei felt a little flustered. In fact, in such an environment, he could clearly hear his own heartbeat.

Xia ruofei was suddenly in a dilemma.

Everything looked the same except for the grassland. If he wanted to explore this secret realm, which direction should he go? There was no sun, moon, or stars in the sky, so it was impossible to tell the direction. If one were to explore rashly, it would be easy to get lost.

The place where Xia ruofei was standing now might not be able to find the way back, but at least this was the place where he entered the secret realm. If the exploration was fruitless, he would definitely have to return here to look for other clues. Perhaps he would need this place to return to the Moon!

Hence, Xia ruofei could not leave so easily, in case he could not find her again. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

It would have been fine if this really was Minecraft’s super flat mode, and they could just set up a Beacon here. No matter how far they went, they would be able to see the pillar of light that shot into the sky, so they definitely wouldn’t get lost.

But that was a game, after all, and there was no way to achieve it in reality.

Xia ruofei couldn’t just stand there and not leave. He had entered the secret realm to search for possible opportunities. Moreover, he had been separated from Ling Qingxue. How could he stay in the same place? He definitely had to find Ling Qingxue first.

Hence, Xia ruofei decided to make a mark at this location in the hope that he would be able to find his way back.

Xia ruofei’s method of marking was very simple. He took out a two – meter – tall steel pipe from the spirit map space, wrapped it with a large piece of red cloth, and made a simple flag on the ground.

Other than the primitive symbol, Xia ruofei also placed a signal transmitter beside the flag.

This was a rescue facility that came with the EVA spacesuit. When an astronaut was in danger, they could turn on this signal transmitter and continuously send out radio signals. Within a range of 50 kilometers, the astronaut’s wristwatch could directly receive the signal and locate the position. Considering that the terrain here was very flat and there was no cover, the range of the signal could probably be further.
