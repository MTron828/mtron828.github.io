Chapter 149: Chapter 146 – freely retracting and releasing_1

Xia ruofei’s words were loud and clear, and every sentence was straight to the point. Chen Gang’s heart couldn’t help but tremble, and Chen tie, who had come to help his cousin, also turned pale. Wu Liqian looked at Xia ruofei with admiration. Obviously, Xia ruofei could tell that the director of the Public Security Bureau was a bit of a thorn in his side, so he had spoken righteously and pointed out the problems in the management and style of the Public Security Bureau. The two of them had never discussed it in advance, but Wu Liqian felt that they had a tacit understanding. Wu Liqian thought for a moment, then turned around and said to the officials and officers who had come with her,””Comrades, I’m going to handle some things here. Please go to the hospital’s conference room and wait for a while.” Under the guidance of the hospital’s leaders, the accompanying cadres all left the inpatient department and went to the hospital office building. Wu Liqian looked at Xu Jianbo indifferently, then said to Xia ruofei,””Little Xia, continue.” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”okay.” “County Head Wu, the victim’s husband is an employee of my company, so when I learned that she was injured, I came to visit. I didn’t expect to see these Auxiliary Police officers cuffing our employee as soon as I entered the door. I went up to speak a few words of Justice, but they even wanted to arrest me. They’re simply lawless!” Xia ruofei paused and continued,””I immediately said that the auxiliary Police had no power to enforce the law, and that what they did was against the law! However, they were so rude that they wanted to handcuff me by force, so I had no choice but to defend myself. This is the entire process of officer Chen’s so – called ‘police assault’!” “You’re full of nonsense!” Chen Gang said loudly,”do you have any evidence to slander me?” “Evidence? Now you’re asking for evidence?” Xia ruofei looked at Chen Gang with disdain and said,”when officer Chen wanted to arrest me, he didn’t give me any evidence and didn’t even listen to my explanation!” Xia ruofei paused for a moment before continuing,”many people have seen the dog hurting people. There must be surveillance cameras near the police station. Won’t the truth be revealed if we pull up the surveillance cameras?” As for what you did in the ward, many villagers saw it, and they can all testify!” The villagers were afraid of trouble and did not dare to provoke the Chen family, but that was during normal times. If they had the backing of the Deputy County Head, these people would definitely be willing to come out and testify. “You ... You’re all on the same side, so it doesn’t count!” Chen Gang said angrily. “Nonsense! You’re still in cahoots! How did he become a witness in officer Chen’s eyes?” Xia ruofei retorted rudely. After that, Xia ruofei ignored Chen Gang’s final struggle and continued,””County Head Wu, not long after I chased away these police officers, these two police officers came to my door. They claimed that I attacked a police officer and started a fight. They wanted to cuff me without showing my police badge and summon badge!” Then, Xia ruofei pointed at the young police officer, Wu Liben, and said,””This officer Wu even took out a rubber baton to hit me. If I wasn’t agile, I’m afraid I would have been injured! You saw what happened after that. Officer Chen took out his gun and pointed it at me. He handcuffed me and tried to arrest me ...” Xia ruofei said all this in one breath, then shrugged and shut his mouth. Xu Jianbo’s expression became very ugly. The Chen brothers, Chen Gang and Chen tie, were even paler. Wu Liben and several other Auxiliary Police officers also did not dare to breathe. After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Wu Liqian’s face turned as cold as ice. When she looked at someone in the ward, that person couldn’t help but lower his eyes. Xu Jianbo felt a great deal of pressure. He glared at Chen tie in a somewhat resentful manner and asked,””Xiao Chen, is this what happened?” Chen tie’s body trembled slightly as he stuttered,””Director ... This ... I don’t know what happened before ... After that ... Uh ...” “You ...” Xu Jianbo was so angry that he almost cursed. “Mayor Wu ...” Xu Jianbo lowered his stance and said to Wu Liqian,”as the Bureau chief, I have the responsibility of leading this matter ...” “Director Xu, I don’t think there’s a need to rush the self – reflection!” Wu Liqian said,”the most important thing now is to investigate the matter clearly. I know Xiao Xia. He has always been a law – abiding citizen. Even Secretary Tian often praises him. If it’s really the police’s fault, we should give them an explanation, right?” When Xu Jianbo heard the words “Secretary Tian,” his eyes could not help but narrow, and his heart skipped a beat. He knew all too well the weight of these three words. He also knew that even if Wu Liqian and Tian Huilan had a close relationship, she wouldn’t dare to speak carelessly about this kind of thing. Since she had said so, there was at least a 70 to 80% chance of it being true. If this young man could really get on Tian Huilan’s good side, then the police officers ‘actions today were simply seeking their own deaths, and it was very likely that they would even be implicated. Just as Xu Jianbo’s mind was racing, Wu Liqian said indifferently,””Director Xu, it shouldn’t be difficult to get the surveillance cameras around the city West police station, right? Also, he had to check the records of Chengxi police station and the criminal Police force to see if they were performing official duties or using them for private use! Also, could a police officer’s gun be brought out so easily now? I think it’s necessary to check the registration of the gun warehouse to see if there are any violations! I believe that after this investigation, the truth will be revealed to the world!” After Wu Liqian finished speaking, she thought for a while and continued,””By the way, if director Xu feels that it’s inconvenient, I can coordinate with the comrades of the municipal supervision detachment to come and investigate.” “County Head Wu, there’s no need to trouble the higher – ups with this matter, right?” Xu Jianbo said with a bitter smile. After saying that, he glared at Chen tie and said sternly,””Chen tie, immediately report the situation to County Head Wu! If you dare to hide anything, I’ll definitely punish you severely!” Xu Jianbo knew very well that he was bound to suffer today. If he did not give in now, Wu Liqian would only use this as an excuse to make a fuss, and he would be even more passive then. This little County Head Wu was not simple! She was a woman who usually looked soft and weak, but her methods in officialdom were very experienced and flexible. Even he, a wily old fox who had been in officialdom for decades, had unknowingly suffered. Xu Jianbo sighed in his heart. Now, it seemed that it was necessary to wait and see. It was even appropriate to express goodwill to County Head little Wu ... Chen tie didn’t dare to hide anything and told him everything. Just as Xia ruofei had expected, they had acted on their own accord this time. Even their guns had been brought out on their own. Neither the police station nor the criminal Police force had any record of them going out. The more Xu Jianbo listened, the uglier his expression became. After Chen tie finished, he could not help but berate, “You’re all bastards!” [PS] the ranking on the monthly rankings has been sliding down. I beg for everyone’s support.
