Xia ruofei then looked at the truffles that the workers had collected.

There were large pieces of black truffles and white truffles with some mud on them, exuding the unique fragrance of truffles.

Truffles were worth as much as gold, and each piece of truffle represented a huge amount of wealth.

Xia ruofei no longer had much desire for money in the secular world. However, he still had to keep these truffles well because the Paradise Corporation would hold an annual truffle auction and it had become a brand.

Feng Rao and the rest had never asked Xia ruofei where he got the truffles. In their eyes, Xia ruofei had such magical means.

Even if Xia ruofei didn‚Äôt care about the daily affairs of the company, he couldn‚Äôt just ignore paradise Corporation, especially when it involved the company‚Äôs brand image.

Of course, now that he had Zheng Yongshou as a contact, he could save a lot of trouble as long as he handed it over to Zheng Yongshou.

The only problem was that it was very difficult to preserve truffles. They would go bad very quickly after they were dug out.

There was no such problem in the spirit map space, but if he gave it to Zheng Yongshou, he had to take it out.

Ordinary storage rings did not have the ability to keep things fresh.

Therefore, they might need to choose a place nearby for the auction.

Australia was a good choice. They would warm up the peach blossom company‚Äôs side first, and when the auction was about to start, they would let Zheng Yongshou fly over with the truffle. After all, the journey from Paradise Island to Australia was much shorter than the journey back to China.

Xia ruofei said with satisfaction,‚ÄùXia Qing, Xia Xuan, you‚Äôve done well!‚Äù Let‚Äôs put everything else on hold for now and gather everyone to collect the truffles.

‚ÄúYes! Master!‚Äù Xia Qing and Xia Xuan said respectfully.

Xia ruofei and Xia Qing arrived at the mountain and sea realm of the spirit map space.

The workers had already gone back to rest. The branches and leaves of the oak trees that had been cut down in the morning had been trimmed. The oak trees were placed neatly on the grass, and the branches and leaves that had been trimmed had also been cleaned.

Xia ruofei took a quick look at the oak tree. If he were to bring these trees to the secular world, they would definitely be of the highest quality. There was no doubt about it. He just estimated that the quantity should be enough and did not care about the rest. At that time, he would take Zheng Yongshou‚Äôs storage ring and store the oak trees. The rest would be left to Zheng Yongshou.
