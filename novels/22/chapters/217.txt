Chapter 218: The eldest son of the song family (1)

Xia ruofei entered the doctor’s lounge. There was a computer, a printer, and so on. He was too lazy to write by hand. He sat in the seat that originally belonged to Liang Haitao, opened a document on the computer, and started to make a list. Xia ruofei was no longer the newbie he was when he first got the spirit map space. He had a lot of knowledge in Chinese medicine. Before he set off, he had even memorized a few Traditional Chinese Medicine prescriptions for liver cancer, so he could easily make a list. In any case, these Chinese medicines were just a cover. The real effects were naturally the petals of the strange flower. Xia ruofei had no choice but to do so. If the petal solution he had prepared in advance could alleviate elder song’s condition, it would be too illogical and would easily arouse suspicion. Therefore, he had to make the process as complicated as possible. He even had to change the prescription later to make his treatment seem relatively reasonable. Of course, Xia ruofei’s list of Chinese medicine included many unrelated medicinal herbs. He even deliberately listed some Chinese medicines that were incompatible with each other to prevent people from speculating about his prescription through the list. Traditional Chinese Medicine was very complicated, and it paid attention to the monarch, the subject, and the assistant. Even if it was the same few medicinal herbs, the dosage would be different, and it would produce completely different medicinal effects. And different herbs and different dosage combinations could produce endless changes. Xia ruofei had specially mixed in many other medicinal herbs and even listed a few precious medicinal herbs. This way, even if a Chinese medical Master came, he would not be able to deduce the real prescription from the list. Xia ruofei quickly typed out the names and quantities of the Chinese medicine on the computer. Xu Wu made a cup of tea for Xia ruofei and placed it by his hand. Then, he stood straight opposite Xia ruofei’s table. Xia ruofei stopped and said to Xu Wu with a smile,””Staff officer Xu, take a seat!” “No need,” Xu Wu said.”Doctor Xia, you go ahead. I’ll just stand.” “Don’t mind me!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”if you were in my old unit, you would be at the same level as our battalion commander. You’re just standing there. I’m just a small Sergeant. I’m under a lot of pressure!” Xu Wu also smiled and said,””A Sergeant of the lone wolf assault team is no worse than a major in an ordinary Army! Besides, from your resume, you’re still an elite member of your commando unit. If you don’t retire, it’s only a matter of time before you get promoted!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”the problem is that staff officer Xu is not a major in an ordinary Army!” I heard that everyone in the guard Bureau is an expert! If there’s a chance, how about we exchange a few moves?” Xu Wu quickly waved his hand and said,”no, no, no! You’re precious now! If I accidentally hurt you, manager Lu will skin me alive!” “Hey! Staff officer Xu is very confident!” Xia ruofei laughed.”I don’t believe that the lone wolf assault team is worse than your guard Bureau. If you put it that way, I really have to fight you, but we’ll talk about it after the treatment is over!” “Yes, yes, yes. The most important thing now is to treat the chief’s illness!” Xu Wu quickly said,”as long as the chief’s condition improves, I’ll play with you however I want! If you think it’s not enough, I’ll get the kids from the Reconnaissance Company to fight with you!” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh out loud. Although he had left the Army, Xia ruofei still had a deep affection for the Army. He felt very close to the soldiers when he interacted with them. In particular, because of the political Review, Xu Wu also knew about his dusty resume in those confidential files. He did not have to worry about leaking secrets when he spoke, so he naturally felt closer to him. Xia ruofei didn’t waste any time while he was chatting. He quickly came up with a list of hundreds of Chinese medicines. He pressed the print button, and the printer beside him started to run. …… Downstairs, a black Audi was parked at the entrance. A middle – aged man in his fifties pushed the door open and got out of the car without waiting for the Secretary to open the door. The middle – aged man was tall and had a square face that exuded the majesty of a superior. His bright eyes revealed a deep sense of worry and his face was very serious. On the other side of the back seat, a young man in his 20s also got out of the car. The young man looked somewhat similar to the middle – aged man, but compared to the middle – aged man’s simple clothes, the young man was much more high – Profile. He was from an international luxury brand, but because of the long journey, his Givenchy casual suit was a little wrinkled, his hair was a little messy, and his face was a little pale. He seemed to be in a bad mood. The middle – aged man looked at the slightly bleak building and felt an irrepressible sadness in his heart. If this were in Beijing, his father’s ward would be full of relatives and friends by now! Even the central government would send a core member as a representative. However, he understood his father’s feelings for Jiangnan Province very well. He was not surprised by his father’s decision. The middle – aged man strode into the courtyard. Manager Lu and Tian Huilan had already come downstairs. They quickly walked up to him. “Provincial judge song!” “Big brother song!” The two of them greeted the middle – aged man at the same time. The middle – aged man was elder song’s eldest son, song Zhengping. He was the Chief Judge of the Xiang Nan Province. His youngest son, song Rui, arrived in the same car as him. Manager Lu and Tian Huilan addressed song Zhengping differently. Manager Lu was the “Chief Judge of the song province”, while Tian Huilan called him “big brother song.” It was clear that Tian Huilan had a deep relationship with the song family. Song Zhengping didn’t bother to greet the two of them. He only nodded his head before asking anxiously,””Manager Lu, how’s my father’s condition?” As soon as he got off the plane, he received a call from manager Lu, who told him that his father was in a critical condition. He was anxious all the way, afraid that he wouldn’t be able to see his father one last time. “Don’t worry, Chief Judge song, the Bureau chief’s condition has stabilized for the time being!”Manager Lu quickly said. Maybe ... There’s still a chance for her condition to turn for the better. ” Song Zhengping was also taken aback. Under normal circumstances, for a senior official like his father, the medical unit would definitely be very strict. Manager Lu’s second phone call basically meant that the old man had no hope and could pass away at any time. How could there be such a relapse in such a short time? Of course, elder song’s temporary stability was great news for song Zhengping. He heaved a sigh of relief and said, “That’s good, that’s good ... Let’s go and see my father first! By the way, Xiao Liang and the others have been working hard these days. It’s all thanks to their careful treatment!” Manager Lu and Tian Huilan looked at each other, and their expressions suddenly became strange ...Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com
