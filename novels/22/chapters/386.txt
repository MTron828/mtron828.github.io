Chapter 387: Xia ruofei, I want to ..._2

Ling Xiaotian was in a very good mood today. Usually, a catty of white wine was not much for him, but he was actually a little drunk today. He was a little tongue – tied when he spoke. He patted Xia ruofei’s shoulder from time to time affectionately and almost called him brother.

Xia ruofei hurriedly suggested that everyone go home after eating and drinking. Otherwise, it would be awkward if Ling Xiaotian patted his shoulder and called him “brother” again. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Could it be that he and his ‘niece’ had been having sex in her room for the entire afternoon?

As Xia ruofei had drunk some wine, Ling Xiaotian had wanted to keep Xia ruofei for the night, but Xia ruofei insisted on returning to the farm.

He was worried that he wouldn’t be able to control himself at night and would go to Ling Qingxue’s room to steal her. Ling Xiaotian’s bedroom was also on the second floor, and people of his age would often wake up at night. If he were to be discovered, it would be even more awkward.

Seeing that Xia ruofei was insistent, Ling Xiaotian did not force him to stay. He immediately called his driver to send Xia ruofei back to the farm. As for Xia ruofei’s Knight XV off – Road vehicle, he would leave it at Ling Xiaotian’s Villa.

……

On the third day, Ling Xiaotian called Xia ruofei and told him that the first batch of 30 tons of wine had been loaded into the truck and was ready to be sent to the warehouse.

Hence, Xia ruofei packed up and drove away from the farm, heading straight for the warehouse that he had rented.

He waited at the warehouse for a short while, and Ling Xiaotian personally brought a car to the farm to deliver the wine for the first time. Ling Xiaotian also placed great importance on it.

30 tons of wine, a total of Five Ten – wheeled trucks came. The main thing was that these wine jars could not be stacked together. Otherwise, if they were not afraid of overloading, one truck would be enough.

There was also a small crane and a small hydraulic forklift, which were obviously specially prepared to unload the big wine jar from the truck.

In fact, Xia ruofei could have easily stored the hundred bottles of wine in his storage space. However, the existence of the spirit painting scroll was a top secret, so it was inevitable that it would be troublesome.

Fortunately, other than the continuous delivery of alcohol this time around, it would be normal in the future. At most, it would only be delivered once a month. Moreover, when new alcohol was delivered, they could also transport the “improved” alcohol back, so the car would not run for nothing.

There was a truck with more than 100 double – layered wooden frames that were easy to operate with a forklift.

The workers tied the wine jars up and the cranes lifted the wine jars from the cargo compartment. They placed them firmly on the wooden frame on the ground. Then, the workers drove the forklift over to lift the large wine jars. A few workers protected them from the side as they slowly moved them into the warehouse.

As Ling Xiaotian was directing the workers to unload the truck, he said to Xia ruofei,””Ruofei, leave this forklift in your warehouse. In the future, you can load and unload the truck. Also, if you want to transport these wines to other places for further improvement and processing, it will be more convenient.”

“Okay, uncle Ling, you’re so thoughtful.” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

Ling Xiaotian laughed and patted Xia ruofei’s shoulder,””Ruofei, I’ve shipped the wine over. It’s up to you whether the winery can become famous in the future!”

“Don’t worry, uncle Ling! There won’t be any problems!” Xia ruofei said confidently.

It took more than an hour to unload the hundred bottles of wine before they were all transported to the warehouse.

Ling Xiaotian personally brought Xia ruofei to a large wine jar and said,””Ruofei, this jar of wine is the kind that’s used to be modified and processed into 8888 Yuan per bottle. The style of the wine jar is different from the others. Don’t make a mistake!”

Xia ruofei took a look. The ceramic glaze of this wine jar was darker than the other wine jars. The most eye – catching thing was that there were two Dragon – shaped embossed on it, which was clearly different from the other wine jars. He also noticed that the batch and date labels were pasted on the wine jar.

He smiled and said,”no problem!” Uncle Ling, if we send this wine over once a month, we can supply a limited supply of five hundred bottles of the top quality Drunken Eight Immortals to the market every month after a year. I’ll deal with this jar of wine today, and the rest will be dealt with after the 90 tons of wine have arrived. ”

“Good, good, good!” Ling Xiaotian chuckled and said,” 500 bottles is enough. Good things are limited in supply. If there are too many, it would seem like they are not of a high grade!”

After Ling Xiaotian led the workers out of the warehouse, Xia ruofei locked the door and closed the curtains of the ventilation windows. Then, he walked to the jar of wine and kept it in his original space.

Then, Xia ruofei went out to lock the warehouse door and drove back to the farm.

The pickup truck had just started on the winding highway when his phone on the driver’s seat rang.

Xia ruofei held the steering wheel with one hand and grabbed his phone with the other. It was Lu You.

He dropped his phone, took out his Bluetooth headset, and put it on as he muttered to himself,””What is this girl looking for me for? Could it be that the flower is sick again?”

Xia ruofei pressed the answer button on his earpiece and said lazily,””Miss Lu, what’s the matter?”

“Xia ruofei, can you get me some of that Black Face Mask too ...” Lu You said crisply.

“What Black Face Mask?” Xia ruofei was confused.

“Is it that ... What ... Jade ... Jade Flower cake?”

Xia ruofei was speechless,’Jade Flower cake? And I’m even talking about Osmanthus cakes! Miss Lu, what are you talking about?”

“The kind of Facial Mask you gave sister Qingxue!” Lu You was a little anxious.

Only then did Xia ruofei realize that Lu You was actually talking about the jaded skin ointment. He couldn’t help but exclaim,””What the ... That’s called Jade skin cream, okay? But that’s not important. What I’m interested in is ... How did you know about the Jade skin cream?”

“Of course, it was sister Qingxue who told me!” Lu You said,”don’t ask so much ... I want that face mask too. Can you help me get some?” Just tell me if you can or can not!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”That’s Xia ruofei’s girlfriend’s special facial Mask. How can you just give it to someone else?”

“Don’t be so stingy ...” Lu You said.”At most, I’ll pay! Tell me, how much is a Facial Mask?”

Xia ruofei’s tone suddenly turned cold.””I’m sorry, miss Lu. I don’t seem to be short of money at the moment ...”

In fact, he was just teasing Lu You just now. Since Lu You knew about the existence of the jaded skin ointment and had even asked for it, it was no big deal to give her some. After all, the Chinese medicine used to make the jaded skin ointment was not too expensive.

However, Lu You seemed to have a serious Princess illness. The moment Xia ruofei rejected her, she offered to buy it with money. This made Xia ruofei feel a little unhappy.

Lu You, who was on the other end of the line, also sensed Xia ruofei’s emotions. With her temper in the past, she might have hung up the phone long ago. Since when had she, miss Lu, ever begged someone like this? You’re actually still so arrogant?

However, when Xia ruofei’s tone suddenly turned cold, Lu You felt an inexplicable sense of panic. She gently gritted her teeth and said softly,””Xia ruofei, I didn’t mean it that way. Don’t misunderstand ...”

Not only was Xia ruofei a little surprised when she said this, but even Lu You herself could not believe that these words came from her own mouth. Her face blushed inexplicably, and then she said to herself in her heart,”It must be because I want that mask too much, a man ... No, young miss is flexible ...

On the other hand, Xia ruofei was not really angry. Lu You’s tone suddenly became gentle. Other than feeling a little uncomfortable, the little bit of unhappiness in his heart disappeared.

“Miss Lu,” he said with a smile,”I made this face mask by hand. I can make some for you, but I have a condition.”

“Go ahead,”

“Tell me, how did you know about this Jade skin cream?” Xia ruofei asked,”do you keep in touch with Qingxue? Why would she suddenly tell you this?”
