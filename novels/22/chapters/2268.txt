A Pharmaceutical Group with a scale of at least a billion Yuan was only a minor problem in old man Liu’s eyes.

In fact, anything that involved money was not a problem at all in the eyes of old man Liu, not to mention that the pharmaceutical Group was not the most important in the Liu family’s business. Although it could produce considerable benefits every year, it was not the main direction of the Liu family’s business.

Although it was a bit painful to give up directly, it was not a serious injury.

As long as he could keep his life, he wouldn’t even frown if he had to cut off a part of the Liu family’s main business, let alone a Pharmaceutical Group.

What he was more concerned about was not these economic matters.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said tentatively,””Elder Liu, you and Grandpa song are old comrades and have known each other for so many years. Before coming here, Grandpa song has been trying to persuade me to treat you as much as I can ...”

Elder Liu laughed and waved his hand.””Xiao Xia, I know that old man song too well. He would never say such things. Don’t try to play tricks in front of me!” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Xia ruofei could not help but feel a little awkward.

What was the saying again? Perhaps your enemy is the one who understands you the most.

Although it wasn’t appropriate to describe elder song and elder Liu as enemies, it could also explain the relationship between elder Liu and elder song.

Xia ruofei said,”elder Liu, Grandpa song respects my opinion, so he doesn’t want to affect my decision.” However, he did say that if something were to happen to you this time, his heart would be empty and he would feel very upset!”

“That sounds more like something old song would say!” Mr. Liu laughed and then looked into Xia ruofei’s eyes.”Xia, I know what you’re thinking ... But that’s impossible!”

Xia ruofei frowned and asked,”why?” Elder Liu, both your families have great influence. If the two of you join forces, it’ll be a strong Alliance. I think it’ll be good for both of you!”

Although Xia ruofei did not say it out loud, old master Liu had already guessed that Xia ruofei hoped that the Liu family would turn from enemies to friends with the song family.

Of course, old man Liu rejected it without thinking.

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, old man Liu smiled bitterly and said,””Xiao Xia, there are complicated reasons behind this. It’s not something that can be explained in a few words ...”

“Then, make it short!” Xia ruofei said,”with me here, your body will be fine. We have a lot of time.”

With that, Xia ruofei walked up and gently massaged several acupuncture points on old man Liu’s body. At the same time, he inserted a small amount of true Qi to stimulate these acupuncture points.

Old man Liu immediately felt a warm current flowing through his meridians. His body, which had been extremely weak from the torture of the illness, seemed to have become much lighter all of a sudden. He felt that his body was full of strength.

Even though old man Liu had experienced many storms and waves, he still couldn’t help but lose his composure at this moment, the shock on his face not dissipating for a long time.

After a long while, old man Liu muttered,””This ... This is the real hand of rejuvenation! Little Xia, I’m getting more and more confident in your treatment methods now ...”

Xia ruofei did not use any needles or medicine just now. He only used his bare hands to massage the acupuncture points, and yet it was so effective. This opened elder Liu’s eyes and gave him a strong hope of survival.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”this is just a small trick. It can only treat the symptoms but not the root of the problem ... By pressing and stimulating specific acupuncture points appropriately, it can stimulate your body’s potential and make you feel better than before. However, that’s the only effect. It can’t help your condition much!”

“This is already amazing!” Old man Liu sighed.”Ever since I found out about this disease, I’ve never felt so full of energy like I am now ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”elder Liu, please satisfy my curiosity first.” Just now, you said that it was impossible for the Liu and song families to form an alliance. What are your concerns?”

After old man Liu’s spirit had recovered, his mood seemed to have improved as well. He said,””Xiao Xia, politics is really too complicated. There’s no standard of black and white. You know, our two families have been fighting for so many years. Although there is no blood feud between us, the grudges between us are countless. Old song and I can meet and smile, but what about our children? What about his grandchildren? “There are also large family members, as well as forces and allies that are close to our family ... These people are not on the same side as the song family, especially our allies. They basically have some grudges with the song family. If the Liu and song families form an alliance, where will our allies stand? This isn’t child’s play ...”

Xia ruofei nodded. Although he didn’t know much about the big families, he was inspired by old man Liu’s words. He knew that he had been too naive.

Old man Liu smiled and continued,””There is a more important reason.”

“Oh? What’s the reason?” Xia ruofei asked curiously.
