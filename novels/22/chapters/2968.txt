Although Luo Feng had already set up a soundproof barrier in the private room, he still went close to Wu Ming’s ear and whispered a few words.

As Wu Ming listened, his expression gradually turned from dark to bright. In the end, his eyes actually lit up and a smile appeared on his face.

Wu Ming raised his thumb and said,””Uncle Feng is brilliant! Let’s do this!”

Luo Feng secretly heaved a sigh of relief and felt that he was lucky.

Fortunately, he knew Wu Ming’s character very well and knew that this guy was a donkey. Otherwise, if he kept trying to reason with Wu Ming, it would definitely produce the opposite effect. Now that he could change Wu Ming’s mind with just a few words, it was already a very good result.

On the main auction stage, Hao Qingsong had already asked for the second time if there were any cultivators who wanted to raise the bid on the basis of Xia ruofei ‘s.

In fact, in room 20, Xia ruofei and the other two were also very nervous.

Of course, Xia ruofei saw that Wu Ming, who had been competing with him without any hesitation, suddenly stopped. He wondered if Wu Ming would give up and was a little worried. After all, he really wanted this ore.

On the other hand, Li Yifu and Luo Qingfeng were the exact opposite. When Xia ruofei kept raising the price, the two of them were already in shock. Jian Jia and the others thought that Xia ruofei was deliberately raising the price to make the other party consume more spiritual stones. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

However, just as Xia ruofei raised the price to 6010 spiritual stones, there was no more movement from room 15. This made the two extremely nervous. If room 15 backed out now, it meant that Xia ruofei would have to use 6010 spiritual stones to buy the useless ore. To the two of them, this was like trying to steal a chicken but losing the rice!

The other cultivators who were watching the show also paid attention to the price on the big screen. This big show was indeed full of ups and downs, which made the cultivators who were not involved very satisfied.

Even Chen Xuan, who was in Box 1, was excited. Of course, he didn’t care much about the final price of the ore. To a young master of a cultivation family like him, there was no difference between 6000 and 1000 spirit stones. After all, he had never been short of spirit stones since he was a child. It was just that an ore that he had casually presented to the auction could cause two parties to fight over it. He found it quite interesting.

Meanwhile, in room number 6, the valley master of the soaring Flower Valley, Liu Mansha, also had a playful smile on her face.

When Xia ruofei had spoken and rendered Wu Ming speechless, she could already tell that the cultivator in room 20 was the young Man From The Star Seizer sect who was of the same generation as Luo Qingfeng, the one they had met in the elevator before the auction.

Both the star Seizer sect and the spirit Vulture mountain were much weaker than the flying flower Valley. However, Liu Mansha was able to see some clues from this incident and confirmed some of her previous judgments. The young man named Xia Tian beside Luo Qingfeng was not simple. She even had a faint feeling that the star Seizer sect seemed to be led by ‘Xia Tian’. Of course, this was mostly based on a woman’s intuition.

However, Liu Mansha knew that it was definitely ‘Xia Tian’ s ‘idea to bid for the ore. With Luo Qingfeng’s personality, he would not be so radical.

What Liu Mansha was very interested in was whether Xia Tian was deliberately raising the price to make Wu Ming use up his spirit stones or if he really wanted to buy the ore. If it was the former, then the current situation was a bit delicate. If it was the latter, was this “Xia Tian” trying to get on Chen Xuan’s good side or had he really discovered the secret of the ore? If it was the second possibility, then things would be even more interesting ...

When Liu Mansha thought of this, the corners of her mouth couldn’t help but curl up into a very beautiful arc.

Just as Hao Qingsong was about to ask for the third time, Wu Ming’s mocking voice came from room 15.”It seems that the fellow Daoist in room 20 is really determined to get this ore! The ore that young master Chen of the first heaven society brought out for auction is undoubtedly extremely valuable. The price of 6010 spirit stones is barely worthy of the value of this spirit stone. It’s worth my effort to raise the price! Since this fellow Daoist is so determined to buy it, and as the saying goes, a gentleman doesn’t take what others like, then I’ll ... Let go of this ore! Hahaha ...”

As soon as Wu Ming said this, the cultivators in the private rooms couldn’t help but discuss among themselves. This result was indeed beyond everyone’s expectations. It seemed to be completely inconsistent with Wu Ming’s usual style of doing things!

However, when everyone heard Wu Ming’s smug laughter, they seemed to think that he had done all this on purpose to raise the transaction price of the ore. If that was the case, everything could be explained.

Although the one – way glass didn’t allow them to see what was going on inside the room, everyone couldn’t help but look at room 20. They were all very interested in the expression on the cultivator’s face.

Some people tried to use their spiritual energy to check, but Xia ruofei’s wizardry barrier was not only soundproof, but it also prevented spiritual energy from checking, so these people naturally returned in vain.

In room 20, Li Yifu and Luo Qingfeng’s faces turned pale after hearing Wu Ming’s words. At this time, there was only one thought in their minds,”Yingying really screwed up ...”
