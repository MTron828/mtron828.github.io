Chapter 598: Space Dahongpao (1)

Guo Qinglin stroked his beard and smiled as he expressed his thanks. He looked at the purple and red Dragons with undisguised love.

Li Zongheng and Xu Desheng were the most disappointed.

Xu Desheng had participated in the bidding twice, but he had given up both times because he felt that the price was too high.

As for li Zongheng, he had naturally given up on this pair of blood red Dragons. When he discovered that these Dragons were the rare and top – grade brilliant purple red Dragons, he had already made up his mind to compete for the last pair.

It was a pity that Guo Qinglin was clearly more daring. To be honest, the price of 18.88 million was definitely on the high side. On average, each Red Dragon was close to 10 million, which was almost double the previous record of 5 million. In the end, even li Zongheng felt that it was not worth it to raise the price any further, so he had no choice but to part with the Dragon.

Now, even Xie Xun had obtained a pair of high – Quality blood red Dragons. Only li Zongheng and Xu Desheng returned empty – handed, so one could imagine the disappointment in their hearts.

Xia ruofei saw this and laughed.”Boss li, boss Guo, it’s okay if you didn’t get it this time. There will be more chances in the future ...”

Li Zongheng’s eyes lit up, and he quickly asked,”Little Xia, do you still have a Blood Red Dragon of such quality? Is it the brilliant purple red Dragon?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Of course not now. However, I have my own channels. I just need some time ...”

“It’s okay, I can wait!” Li Zongheng quickly said,”Xiao Xia, once you have any news, you must inform me immediately!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.”No problem. But Mr. Li, I can guarantee that the red Arowana I have here are all of the best quality. However, I can’t guarantee if I can produce a brilliant purple red Dragon ...”

Li Zongheng nodded his head.”Most of the purple Dragons are mutated. This is something that can only be encountered by luck. I know that. It’ll be fine as long as I can buy a Blood Red Dragon ...”

Li Zongheng was rather regretful now. If he had known that the little old man Guo Qinglin was so determined, he would not have fought to the death. He was still confident that he could compete with Xie Xun or yang Dahua for a pair of blood red Dragons.

......

At this moment, Xu Desheng also said,””Little Xia, don’t forget to inform me when the time comes! I didn’t get anything today either ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”no problem, no problem. I’m more than happy to welcome all the bosses who are willing to take care of my business!” As soon as I get a good item, I’ll inform you guys as soon as possible ...”

Li Zongheng and Xu Desheng expressed their thanks. Xie Xun and the other two who bought the red Arowana were also very happy. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Just like the previous two, Guo Qinglin wrote a check for Xia ruofei on the spot and called someone to drive over to transport the precious purple and red Dragon.

Very quickly, the people that Xie Xun and the other two had sent arrived at Ling Xiaotian’s Villa. They carefully moved the red Arowana into a professional fish tank, then impatiently bade farewell and left.

Before they left, Xia ruofei gave each of them a bottle of “nutrient solution” and told them to drip a few drops in if the red Arowana was not acclimatized to the environment.

At the same time, Xia ruofei also emphasized that the nutrient solution was very precious and difficult to make, so they had to use it sparingly.

Xia ruofei also told them that they had to consciously increase the frequency of using nutrient solution. They could not let the red Arowana develop the habit of relying on nutrient solution. This way, a whole bottle could last for a few months. By then, the red Arowana should have slowly adapted to the normal environment and normal water quality.

Xie Xun, yang Dahua, and Guo Qinglin naturally agreed and carefully put away the nutrient solution.

After Guo Qinglin and the other two left, li Zongheng and Xu Desheng were also a little disappointed. They said their goodbyes to Ling Xiaotian and Xia ruofei and left the Riverside Villa in their respective cars.

After sending the guests off, Ling Xiaotian looked at the four checks in Xia ruofei’s hands and exclaimed,””Ruofei, this money – making speed ... Is really amazing! In just a few hours, more than 30 million has been transferred into your account!”

Xia ruofei’s three pairs of Red Arowana were sold for 6.5 million, 6 million, and 18.88 million respectively. In addition to the 2 million that Xie Xun lost to him previously, Xia ruofei had a total of 33.38 million in his account this time. The speed at which he was making money was comparable to a money printing machine.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Uncle Ling, you can’t count it like that. These red Arowana didn’t fall from the sky. I need money to buy them, right?” Moreover, having such a channel was also a kind of resource in itself! Does this not count as the cost?”

Ling Xiaotian chuckled and nodded,””You’re right, but I know you won’t need to spend too much money on the stock. You’ve made a lot of money from today’s business, right?”

Xia ruofei chuckled but didn’t answer.

Naturally, Ling Xiaotian would not probe further. He said directly,””RUO Fei, next time you have good fish, you must think of me first! When I saw that pair of purple and red Dragons today, I was so envious! If we didn’t agree on this beforehand, I would have bought it for 20 million today! How could we let old Guo buy it so easily?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Okay, okay, okay. Next time, if there’s a good Red Dragon, I’ll let you choose first. I’ll contact Boss li and the others after you’re done!”

“This is right!” Ling Xiaotian said happily.

Xia ruofei said,”uncle Ling, I hope you can understand that I didn’t ask you to bid today. After all, you were the one who introduced me. If you were to participate, it would be hard to avoid being suspected of deliberately raising the price. It would not be good if there were grudges between you and your friends ...”
