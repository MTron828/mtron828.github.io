“Xia Qing, come to the Archean realm!” Xia ruofei used his mind to communicate with Xia Qing, who was in the mountain sea realm.

In the next moment, Xia Qing’s figure appeared in front of Xia ruofei.

When he saw the rune floating in front of Xia ruofei, he was stunned for a moment, then he was overjoyed and said,””Congratulations, master. You’ve finally completed the unlocking of the human – shaped jade talisman!”

Xia ruofei’s tired face revealed a smile.””What should I do next?”

“Master, you only need to place the rune close to the Jade talisman!” Xia Qing said.

Xia ruofei nodded and opened his palm. Then, with a thought, the floating mysterious rune slowly approached the human jade talisman.

As the talisman got closer, the human – shaped jade talisman started to glow. Then, the Jade talisman slowly rose and floated in front of Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei didn’t use the invisible spatial force to control it. This time, it was the natural attraction between the Jade talisman and the unlocking rune.

The unsealing rune also slowly floated toward the human – shaped jade talisman. The closer it was to the Jade talisman, the brighter the light of the rune became, and the size of the rune also gradually shrank. Finally, the palm – sized rune had shrunk to the size of the lines on the Jade talisman.

Immediately after, the talisman drew an arc and seamlessly imprinted itself on the lines of the human – shaped jade talisman.

The Jade talisman suddenly bloomed with a dazzling light, making Xia ruofei squint his eyes involuntarily.

At this moment, Xia ruofei suddenly felt a huge amount of information pouring into his mind.

“The true nature is pure and congealed, the deep and quiet, the body stays forever, and there is no leaving or coming. Since ancient times, its name had not disappeared. It is formless and nameless, the sect of all things ...”

An ethereal voice echoed in Xia ruofei’s mind. The speed at which the information was pouring in was getting faster and faster. At first, Xia ruofei could barely “hear” the content, but towards the end, he could only feel a huge amount of information constantly pouring into his mind. He could not tell what exactly it was.

The amount of information was so huge that Xia ruofei felt like his brain was about to explode. He could not help but show a pained expression.

When Xia Qing saw the dazzling brilliance of the Jade talisman, she quietly retreated to a distance.

He didn’t show any worry.

He knew very well that if Xia ruofei could construct the unlocking rune almost perfectly, he would be able to withstand the impact of the information flow.

In fact, the ancestor who had created the spirit map space and left behind many inheritances had planned everything out.

If Xia ruofei’s spiritual power was not up to the standard, he would not be able to open the restriction and take out the human – shaped jade talisman. If his control of spiritual power was not up to the standard, he would not be able to construct the complicated runes to unlock the Jade talisman.

Xia ruofei would only have the chance to receive the massive amount of information in the human – shaped jade talisman if both conditions were met.

Mental strength was closely related to one’s sea of consciousness. If two conditions were met, it meant that Xia ruofei’s sea of consciousness was strong enough to withstand the impact of the information in the Jade talisman.

Of course, due to the sudden influx of information, Xia ruofei would have to endure some pain. However, it was unlikely that he would be in danger.

On the other hand, Xia ruofei clenched his teeth and kept his mind clear. Beads of sweat began to appear on his forehead.

Under the impact of countless mysterious information, he could not even feel the passage of time.

In Xia ruofei’s perception, it felt as if hundreds of millions of years had passed, but it also felt as if it had happened in the blink of an eye.

Finally, the terrifying information transmission came to an abrupt end without any warning.

Xia ruofei heaved a long sigh of relief. At this moment, he felt a slight pain in his head. It was probably the side effect of receiving too much information in a short period of time.

He even felt his body go soft. It had been a long time since he had felt this way with his terrifyingly strong physique.

At this time, Xia Qing handed over a cup of the spirit Heart Flower petal solution that she had already prepared and said,””Master, you’ve worked hard! Drink some water to recover first. ”

“Thank you!” Xia ruofei took the cup and finished the petal solution in one gulp.

After a long while, Xia ruofei stood up slowly and sat down on the recliner. He rested for a while before he felt that he was slowly recovering.

Thinking back to the process of receiving the message, Xia ruofei could not help but feel scared.

For an ordinary person, there would only be one consequence if such a massive amount of information poured into their brain in an instant. That was, their entire brain would be destroyed. Even if they did not die, they would become a vegetable.

If Xia ruofei had been impatient and unlocked the human – shaped jade talisman when there was still a small flaw in the talisman, and he had succeeded by luck, he might have damaged his brain during the process of information transmission.

This was because before he could construct a stable unlocking rune, his mental strength had not met the conditions to receive the inheritance information in the human – shaped jade talisman. It would be extremely dangerous to receive it by force.

After calming himself down, Xia ruofei started to sort out his gains.

As long as he willed it, the information that was transmitted to his brain would appear. Moreover, this information seemed to be engraved in his mind. His memory was extremely strong and impossible to forget.

Xia ruofei was shocked by the huge amount of information.

If he were to calculate the amount of data, the amount of data probably wouldn’t even be in “GB”. It might even be in the “TB” range.

Of course, this wasn’t just pure text information. Even if he converted all the books around the world into digital information, there wouldn’t be that much.

The information that Xia ruofei received not only contained a huge amount of content, but also some experiences and insights. These were extremely mysterious things that could not be described with words or words. However, they were directly stored in Xia ruofei’s mind.

All the information was in his brain. Although there was a huge amount of data, Xia ruofei was able to sort it out quickly.

After he was done, he couldn’t help but be a little speechless.

The information in the human jade talisman could be said to be all – encompassing. Besides the cultivation techniques of the first three levels of the great Dao mantra, there was also a huge amount of other information.

It included some basic cultivation knowledge, basic cultivation techniques, tricks of using mental energy, talismans, pills, Chinese medicine ... And a lot of cultivation insights.

“Xia Qing, didn’t you say that the” great Dao formula “was the main thing in the human – shaped jade talisman?” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but ask,”did the transmission go wrong? Why is there so much information in my head?”

Xia Qing was speechless when she heard Xia ruofei call the precious inheritance ‘messy’ information.

However, he still patiently explained,””Master, the most precious thing is the ‘great Dao chant’. All the other cultivation methods, spells, and tricks added together are not even one – ten – thousandth of the ‘great Dao chant’. As for the information, it was also chosen by the creator of the spirit map world after screening and felt that it was worth passing down. Therefore, it was placed into the human jade talisman as basic introductory content. The last two Jade talismans only contain the content of the ‘great Dao chant’.”

“Oh ...” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”in other words, this information is equivalent to a beginner’s manual! The ‘great Dao Arts’ is the real deal!”

“You can say that.” Xia Qing said. Then, she couldn’t help but remind him,”however, the content that was preserved by the creator of the spirit map world, although these cultivation techniques and magic arts are nothing compared to the ‘great Dao Arts,’ are still extremely precious in the secular world.

Xia Qing was worried that Xia ruofei would not take the content seriously, so she reminded him.

“I understand ...” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”it seems that we’ve gained a lot this time!”

“Yes,” Xia Qing replied,”the most precious things in the spirit map world are undoubtedly the three Jade talismans.” There was no need to talk about the great Dao Arts. It was an unparalleled cultivation technique that had never existed since ancient times. As for the other pieces of information that had been casually sealed in by the creator, if any of them were to be placed in the secular world, others would fight over them. For example, the medical knowledge in it, many of them are Chinese medicine techniques that have been lost for thousands of years. It’s not an exaggeration to call them Chinese medicine treasures. ”

When Xia ruofei was sorting out the information, he had also skimmed through it. He paid special attention to the Chinese medicine knowledge that he had a better understanding of, so he knew that Xia Qing was not exaggerating at all.

The Chinese medicine theories in this book were much more advanced than the ones that Xia ruofei had self – taught. He even found many precious books that could not be verified by the Chinese medicine world.

“What should I do now? Do you have any good suggestions?” Xia ruofei asked.

Xia Qing answered without hesitation,”of course, I’ll practice the ‘great Dao Arts’ first. Master has taken the body tempering soup and the spirit nourishing soup in the early stages. Both his physique and mental power have reached a pretty good level. In addition, he has absorbed a large amount of innate pure Yang Qi a few days ago. Now, I’m sure he will be able to get twice the result with half the effort!”

“Yes, continue.” Xia ruofei said.

“The ‘great Dao formula’ is the foundation. All the other techniques, including medical skills, are only supplementary.” Xia Qing said,”moreover, the content has already been imprinted in your mind. You only need to spend a little time to digest it in the future and it will become your own knowledge. As for the ‘great Dao art’, you have to keep cultivating it.”

“I understand! No matter how solid the theoretical foundation is, it can’t be done without practice. ” Xia ruofei stood up and said,”a skyscraper rises from the ground. Let’s start now!”

Xia ruofei walked to the side of the spiritual pond and sat down cross – legged, then searched for the contents of the “great Dao Sutra” in his mind.

With a thought, the faint voice sounded again.

This voice seemed to have a magical power that made Xia ruofei’s mind extremely clear. The contents of the “great Dao technique” were very difficult to understand, but Xia ruofei felt that it was very easy to understand.

This was the wonder of directly accepting the inheritance.

Unknowingly, Xia ruofei had “learned” the general principles and the contents of the first level of the “great Dao Arts”.

He couldn’t help but reveal a trace of anticipation and an eager expression.
