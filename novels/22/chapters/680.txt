Chapter 681: Miracle doctor Xia conquered a new field (1)

Xia ruofei’s eyes inadvertently swept across the cobblestone layer in the fish tank. A black cobblestone among them quickly caught Xia ruofei’s attention.

This cobblestone was about the size of an adult’s fist. It looked very similar to the world stone that Xia ruofei had obtained previously.

There was also one more obvious point. Other cobblestones were usually smooth due to the constant erosion of water, but this one was a little pothole – filled, which stood out a little in the water.

However, general Zhao was a general who did not care about trifles, so he probably would not care about this.

After confirming that the world stone he was looking for was in the fish tank, Xia ruofei was no longer in a hurry.

Zhao Cheng had already found the best pre – Mingxi Lake Longjing tea leaves.

“Doctor Xia, how about some green tea? Green tea is healthy!” Zhao Cheng grinned and asked.

“I’m not picky about these things, the guest does as the host wishes. ” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Alright then! Then green tea!”

Jin Feng quickly took the green tea and started to brew it for everyone.

The young Colonel was obviously not an expert at making tea. Although he knew the process of making Kung Fu Tea, his movements were somewhat clumsy.

Later, song Rui couldn’t stand it anymore. He stood up and said,””Colonel Louis, I’ll do it!”

Jin Feng’s dark face blushed slightly and he gave up his seat.

......

Song Rui had been living in the Southeast province for a few months and had learned the technique of making kungfu tea. His movements were obviously more skillful than Jin Feng ‘s.

Zhao Cheng’s tea was indeed good, and the room was filled with the fragrance of tea.

Everyone sipped their tea and chatted. After a while, an orderly ran over and saluted. He said loudly,””Chief of staff! The room has been prepared!”

“Good! Then let’s go!” Zhao Cheng put down his teacup and stood up.”Dr. Xia, would you like to have some more tea or do you want to go for a checkup directly?”

Xia ruofei laughed and stood up.”I didn’t come here to drink tea! Let’s go!”

The odd – Job soldier led the way, and the group soon arrived in front of a room.

Xia ruofei stopped and turned around.””General Zhao and I will go in. The rest of the people will wait outside!”

Jin Feng frowned slightly and said,””Doctor Xia, I’m the chief’s personal guard. I have to be present!”

Xia ruofei spread out his hands and said,”I can’t think of a reasonable reason why you must be present.” In the heavily guarded military administrative area, there are soldiers with loaded guns both inside and outside the villa. All the high points within a few kilometers are your own people, right? What danger could general Zhao be in? Are you suspecting me?”

“Of course not!” Jin Feng quickly said,”it’s just that this is a Security Rule ...”

“Xiao Ling, that’s enough!” Zhao Cheng waved his hand and said,”wait at the door ...”

“But ...”

“But, my ass!” Zhao Cheng said,”do you have to be there when I’m doing something with my wife? Bullshit!”

With that, Zhao Cheng pushed the door open and walked in.

To put it bluntly, it was because Xia ruofei was an outsider that the personal guard could not let the chief out of his sight. However, he could not say such things.

Xia ruofei’s expression was a little strange. Zhao Cheng’s analogy made him feel a little weird.

However, he still quickly followed after her and closed the door behind him.

The room wasn’t very big, but the decorations were very elegant, and there was a faint smell of incense in the air.

A single treatment bed was placed against the wall.

Xia ruofei took a closer look. There was a full set of Traditional Chinese Medicine tools on the table, including needles of various sizes for acupuncture.

“Doctor Xia, do the conditions here meet your requirements?” Zhao Cheng asked.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Yes, I can. General Zhao, please take a seat! I’ll take your pulse first ...”

Xia ruofei had read about the pulse of diabetes patients in medical books. Although he had a medical qualification certificate that elder song had specially arranged for him, he did not have the opportunity to practice. Hence, he had very few opportunities to practice. Xia ruofei was also very curious and could try to feel it from Zhao Cheng. He could combine theory and practice.

Hence, when Xia ruofei took her pulse, he spent more time. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He compared Zhao Cheng’s pulse to what he had learned from the medical books. When he found a match, his brows naturally relaxed and he nodded. When he found a difference, he would frown and even shake his head at times, thinking that it was unbelievable.

In fact, it was just a process of learning and verifying.

But in Zhao Cheng’s eyes, these subtle changes in expressions and movements were like signals.

Zhao Cheng had just been diagnosed with diabetes and was in a state of anxiety. Hence, when Xia ruofei was checking his pulse, he paid close attention to Xia ruofei’s expression.

Xia ruofei was frowning, smiling, and shaking his head. Zhao Cheng’s heart was in a mess. It was like a roller coaster, and he was very nervous.

It was only when Xia ruofei let go of his hand that Zhao Cheng asked,””Doctor Xia, is my illness very complicated and difficult to treat?”

Xia ruofei gave Zhao Cheng a strange look and said,””I don’t think so! General Zhao, why are you suddenly asking this?”

“I ... I see you shaking your head and frowning. People who don’t know you might think that you have an incurable disease!” Zhao Cheng said. This guy! It’s too scary ...”
