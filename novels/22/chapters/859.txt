Translator: 549690339

“Manager Lu, Hello!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Manager Lu also greeted Xia ruofei with a smile and asked,””Little Xia, do you have time tonight? The chief wants to treat you to a meal. ”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, then immediately said,””The Bureau chief has already given instructions. No matter how busy I am, I have to make time for this!”

“Hahaha! He’s a good political kid!” Manager Lu made a joke and then said,”see you at guling courtyard at six tonight!”

“Okay, manager Lu, I’ll be there on time!” Xia ruofei said.

Manager lü did not mention why elder song was looking for him. Xia ruofei was tactful and did not ask further. Anyway, no matter what it was, he would find out when they had dinner.

Xia ruofei put away his phone and walked into the house. As soon as he entered the house, he heard Lin Qiao shouting,””It’s finally open ...”

Xia ruofei hurried to the sofa and saw Lin Qiao staring at the screen nervously.

The page that was usually opened in seconds was now being displayed slowly from top to bottom. Only now did they see the LOGO of the Ministry of Education at the top.

Xia ruofei and the other two were nervous as they watched the web page slowly unfold in front of everyone.

Finally, the score section was revealed.

The living room of the villa was silent for a moment, and then Lin Qiao cheered.

According to the page, Lin Qiao’s total score for this year’s college entrance examination was 610 points, which was 7 points higher than the estimated score at the end of the college entrance examination!

Among them, the mathematics and liberal arts scores were basically the same as estimated. The mathematics score was 132 points more than expected, while the liberal arts score was 208 points more than expected.

Her Chinese was 5 points higher than Lin Qiao’s estimated score, getting 128 points. Her English was even better, getting a surprising 142 points, which was also two points higher than her estimated score.

Compared to the essay, Lin Qiao estimated the score conservatively when she was estimating the score.

“That’s great!” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but slap his thigh and said happily,”Qiao’ er is really awesome! This time, we’ll have a lot of options to choose a university!”

Hu Zi’s mother’s face was also filled with joy, but at the same time, there was a trace of uncertainty. She repeatedly checked the names and admission ticket numbers displayed on the screen, afraid that she had made a mistake and found someone else’s results.

After the final confirmation, Hu Zi’s mother was also so happy that her eyes were filled with tears.

“Mom! Brother ruofei! I didn’t embarrass you, did I?” Lin Qiao said proudly.

Hu ‘er’s mother nodded and said,””Little girl, your performance this time is really not bad! Mom didn’t dote on you for nothing!”

Xia ruofei also touched Lin Qiao’s head affectionately and smiled.””I already knew Qiao’ er was amazing, so I prepared the prize for you in advance!”

Xia ruofei continued,”by the way, have you decided on the design plan for the house” the world “?” I’m very busy these days and don’t have the time to deal with this matter. ”

Grand vision was the flat – Floor apartment that Xia ruofei had bought from Liang Weimin after Lin Qiao’s college entrance examination. It came with an attic. This was Xia ruofei’s graduation gift to Lin Qiao.

Back then, Xia ruofei had put in a lot of effort to get Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao to accept this house.

Later, he brought Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao to look at the house. Lin Qiao gave some of her opinions on the renovation plan of the house, and Liang Weimin immediately asked the designer to make some changes to the plan according to Lin Qiao’s requirements.

After that, Xia ruofei did not follow up on this matter. The designer also contacted Lin Qiao directly.

“It’s been renovated a long time ago,”Lin Qiao said with a smile.” I heard that they’ve been renovated, but I didn’t go to see it. ” All the bosses in the world are your friends anyway, so they definitely won’t cut corners!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Indeed, we don’t have to. We can just go and check it out when it’s done. Uncle Liang will definitely arrange everything properly.”

Xia ruofei had a good personal relationship with Liang Qichao and had helped the father and son a few times. Moreover, Liang Weimin’s jianda group was the one who handled most of the farm projects. Hence, Liang Weimin was very concerned about Xia ruofei’s Affairs.

“Ruofei, Qiao’ er, I’ll make a few more dishes tonight. Let’s have a good celebration!” Hu ‘Zi’s mother said happily.

Xia ruofei’s expression froze and he said in embarrassment,””Godmother, I have something on tonight, so I can’t have dinner at home ...” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Lin Qiao immediately pouted and said,”brother ruofei, how can you be like this?” What a happy day today! You’re not going to celebrate with us ...”

Xia ruofei explained awkwardly,”Qiao’ er, an elder asked me to go to his house for dinner. He probably has something to tell me. It’s not good to reject him. How about we celebrate tomorrow?”

Hu Zi’s mother also quickly said,”ruofei, you should get back to your business. It’s more important. We’re family. It’s okay!”

Xia ruofei saw that Lin Qiao was still unhappy and said,””Qiao’ er, how about I take you on a trip abroad to celebrate when you get your college admission Notice?”

“Really?” Lin Qiao’s eyes lit up.

This girl had never left the country before. When she heard that she could travel abroad, and with Xia ruofei at that, she was suddenly interested.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”of course!” When have I ever lied to you? Godmother will come with us, and we can have fun for a few days as a family!”
