2827 Courting death (2)

“Are you trying to kill him with a single blow?” Song Wei pursed her lips and smiled.

“What else? Are you keeping it for the new year?” Xia ruofei pouted and said.

“What?” Zhou leiyun was confused.”Director Xia, it sounds like you still have some big news that you haven’t released yet!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”general manager Zhou, just wait and see!” Speaking of which ... It seemed that Barca had not made a sound yet, right? I’m a little disappointed! Such a loyal dog, he should at least show his support!”

“That’s enough ...” Ling Qingxue said,”there are a lot of bar?a fans in the country, and they must be feeling conflicted right now!” I think it’s good for Barcelona to remain silent!”

Xia ruofei stood up and said,”if they can hold it in, then they’re lucky!” Otherwise, the biggest laughing stock of the year would be born! Let’s go! Back to the hotel! We’re not going anywhere in the afternoon. We’ll just stay in the hotel and read the news!”

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue looked at each other. They knew that Xia ruofei was about to release the video in his hands. They could not help but look excited.

The clown Pablo had been jumping up and down for the past two days, and the two of them were already sick of him. However, Xia ruofei wanted the matter to blow up and refused to release the video. The two of them could only wait.

Zhou leiyun sent Xia ruofei and the other two back to the hotel and had lunch with them.

Originally, Xia ruofei and the other two had no plans to travel. Zhou leiyun should have left after dinner, but he refused to leave today. His curiosity had been piqued.

Zhou leiyun said,”director Xia, I’ll be waiting with you in the hotel to read the news this afternoon!” This ... Won’t disturb you, will it?”

Xia ruofei looked nonchalant and said,””Anything! As long as director Zhou doesn’t feel bored!”

Anyway, even if Zhou leiyun was not here, he could not do anything. He had two beautiful girlfriends, but he could only look at them and not touch them. Xia ruofei was extremely depressed.

“I won ‘t! I won ‘t!” Zhou leiyun quickly said,”I happen to have some good tea in my car! I’ll get someone to bring it over. Let’s make tea and chat while tracking the progress of this matter!”

With that, Zhou leiyun took out his phone and prepared to call the driver.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”director Zhou!” There was no need for tea! What kind of good tea do you have? Can it be better than the Da Hong Pao that I’m wearing?”

Zhou leiyun was stunned for a moment, but he quickly came to his senses and said,””Yes, yes, yes! I’m ... A little confused! How could my tea be better than your Da Hong Pao? It seems like I’m in for a treat again!”

It was only after Xia ruofei’s half – joking reminder that Zhou leiyun remembered that Xia ruofei’s company was dealing in tea leaves. Furthermore, Taoyuan Da Hong Pao’s reputation on the internet was also explosive. Even if his tea leaves were better than Xia ruofei ‘s, he could not bring it out to ruin his reputation!

Moreover, it was possible that his tea leaves were more expensive than Xia ruofei’s Da Hong Pao. However, in terms of taste, it was impossible to compare.

Xia ruofei laughed and waved his hand. “I’m just joking! I just don’t think it’s necessary to go through so much trouble ... Well, since everyone’s done eating, why don’t we ... Go upstairs to our rooms?”

“Alright! I’ll listen to you!” Zhou leiyun said.

Hence, the group of them took the elevator to the floor where Xia ruofei and the other two were staying. Song Wei and Ling Qingxue went back to their rooms to take a shower. After all, they had been out for half a day. Xia ruofei called Zhou leiyun to his room.

Xia ruofei took out a small box of Da Hong Pao from his luggage. This was the tea tree that he had grown in the spirit map space. It was personally made by Xia Qing and was of a higher quality than the peach Garden Da Hong Pao that was sold in bulk outside.

Zhou leiyun quickly took the initiative to prepare the tea.

Zhou leiyun was a Southerner, and he liked to drink tea very much. He was very skilled at making tea, and as he heated the tea set with hot water, he smiled and said,””President Xia, it was the wisest decision I’ve ever made to have you as a shareholder. Not only did you get an investment for the club, but you also got a good player out of nowhere. Now you’re even helping to take on the work of crisis public relations ... I’m really ashamed!” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Xia ruofei chuckled.”If this B * stard didn’t mock Wu Lei and me, I wouldn’t be so serious. It’s beneath me to be serious with such a small character!”

“That’s right!” Zhou leiyun said,”but this kid is too arrogant! He should be taught a deep lesson!”

Then, Zhou leiyun could not help but ask,””President Xia, did you get hold of something that could kill this kid in one blow?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”almost!” But even if it’s solid evidence, a war of words is inevitable ... Originally, there wouldn’t have been anything, but this guy posted an interview video today. Now, there’s a good show to watch!”

“Let me know first!” Zhou leiyun asked impatiently.

“I’ll go see if the media has reposted it!” Xia ruofei chuckled as he stood up and walked to the desk.”Call me when the tea is ready!”

“Alright!” “Yes,” Zhou leiyun replied. Then, he was stunned for a moment. He smiled bitterly and said,”CEO Xia, you’re keeping me in suspense ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and turned on his computer.”Good food is never late!”

Xia ruofei browsed the news for a while and sat down at the coffee table. He chatted with Zhou leiyun. Soon, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue came to Xia ruofei’s room. Everyone sat around the coffee table and drank tea. Xia ruofei would occasionally use his phone to browse the news.

Zhou leiyun’s heart felt like it was being scratched by a cat, while Xia ruofei watched unhurriedly as Pablo’s video was being forwarded by the mainstream Spain media. He also saw that the number of comments on Facebook was also increasing rapidly. The comments were not from Chinese fans, but mainly from Spanish fans.

There was a time difference between China and here. In addition, because most Chinese fans could not directly see the videos on Facebook, they needed someone to transfer the videos back to China with Chinese subtitles, so their reactions were more or less delayed.

Therefore, in less than half a day, the thousands of comments and hundreds of reposts under this post were basically all genuine.

Most of the commenters were basa fans, and many of them accused Ruby of lying. Some said Ruby’s accusation was inexplicable, and some wondered if it was because of an unexpected victory that made him a little dizzy.

The official website of The Sports Daily forwarded the interview video immediately and hung it on the first page in an eye – catching position. The news of the latest electronic version of The Sports Daily was also placed on the second page, which was considered a very important position. The newspaper editor added a picture of Pinocchio’s long nose, which was self – evident.

When the sky outside gradually darkened, Xia ruofei stood up and smiled.””Let’s go! Let’s go join in the fun!”

Song Wei, Ling Qingxue, and Zhou leiyun were all standing behind Xia ruofei. They watched as Xia ruofei transferred the video taken by Song Wei to his computer and used a new Facebook account to post it. The title was a few simple words: “do you feel ashamed?”

Zhou leiyun finally saw the video that Xia ruofei had been holding in his hand. This time, he did not need to translate it to understand it.

“President Xia, you have such clear evidence in your hands, but you can actually hold it in and not release it!” Zhou leiyun laughed and said,”I’m also in awe of you!”

“That’s why timing is very important!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

After the video was successfully posted, Xia ruofei opened his email and wrote an email with a few screenshots of the video and a link to the newly posted video. Then, he found seven or eight email addresses in his email address book and sent it out.

Then, Xia ruofei pushed the keyboard and said with a smile,””Let’s go! It’s time for dinner!”

“That ... That’s it?” Zhou leiyun asked, stunned.
