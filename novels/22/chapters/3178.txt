3179 The arrangement (2)

Xia ruofei nodded helplessly and said,””Fine! You guys go ahead! I’ll go wash the lunchbox ...”

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue nodded without even lifting their heads.

Xia ruofei tidied up the lunchbox and utensils, picked them up, and left the lounge.

As soon as he went out, he saw Deputy Director Wei smoking at the window not far away.

Deputy Director Wei did not expect Xia ruofei to come out so quickly. He quickly snuffed out the cigarette in his hand and laughed dryly.”President Xia, are you done eating? I’ve just finished my business, so I’m thinking of smoking first. After all, there are ladies in the reception room, and it’s not good to smoke ...”

Xia ruofei nodded.”There are more and more places to ban smoking these days. It’s indeed a little difficult for smokers. However, this is the general trend of civilized society!”

“That’s right, that’s right!” Deputy Director Wei said,”it’s better not to smoke if possible! Health is the most important thing!”

Xia ruofei nodded in agreement and took out a cigarette.””I saw that director Wei pinched himself after taking a few puffs. Do you want to try mine?”

Harm to health was only for ordinary people. Could a few cigarettes of an Aurous core stage cultivator harm his health? It didn’t exist!

Deputy Director Wei almost fell to the ground. He spoke in a righteous tone. President Xia was a kindred spirit!

However, Deputy Director Wei’s attention was quickly drawn to Xia ruofei’s cigarette box. The box was pure white without any logo. As an experienced smoker, he had never seen such a packaging.

Of course, he also knew about the legend of the cigarettes that were stored inside the box, but he was not sure.

Even if Xia ruofei was brought here by academician Wang, the possibility of getting that kind of cigarette was not high, right? Even academician Wang himself couldn’t smoke this cigarette whenever he wanted to.

Xia ruofei was still holding the lunchbox in one hand. He shook his hand gently and skillfully shook half of a cigarette out of the box. Then, he extended it to Deputy Director Wei and smiled.”Director Wei, come!”

“Try it?” Deputy Director Wei looked at Xia ruofei.

“Try it!”

“Then I’ll broaden my horizons ...” Deputy Director Wei laughed as he took out the half – exposed cigarette from the cigarette box.

He took a closer look. The filter of this cigarette was obviously longer than that of ordinary cigarettes. There was a beautifully printed panda logo at the bottom of the filter, which further confirmed his guess.

Xia ruofei shook his hand again and put the box of cigarettes to his mouth, taking a cigarette.

Deputy Director Wei quickly took out a lighter and the two of them lit their cigarettes together. Their movements were very skilled.

After taking a deep breath, Deputy Director Wei closed his eyes to feel the smoke passing through his lungs. Then he opened his eyes and said,””President Xia, this cigarette is indeed different. It’s especially fragrant, even more so than soft Chunghwa! It’s just a little weak. ”

Xia ruofei stuffed the box of cigarettes into his pocket and skillfully held the cigarette between his index and middle fingers. As he exhaled the smoke, he smiled and said,””Yup! The original intention of the design of this cigarette was to reduce the damage to health as much as possible! Naturally, there must be a trade – off. ”

There were always leaders who couldn’t quit smoking, especially in the early years. There were even more leaders who smoked. This internal supply of cigarettes itself was the product of choosing the lesser of two evils.

Deputy Director Wei was even more certain of his judgment. However, since Xia ruofei did not say it clearly, he naturally would not stupidly ask. The two of them chatted idly.

Of course, he also had a little respect for Xia ruofei.

The internal supply of cigarettes had a long filter, so it was finished in a few puffs. Xia ruofei extinguished the cigarette in the trash can by the window, then stuffed the remaining 10 internal supply Panda cigarettes into Deputy Director Wei’s hands.

“Director Wei, I don’t usually smoke, so I’ll give you this half a pack of cigarettes,” he said with a smile.

Deputy Director Wei quickly pushed him away and said,””How can I accept this! It’s not easy to get this cigarette, President Xia, you should keep it for yourself!”

Deputy Director Wei felt that even if Xia ruofei could get the internal supply of cigarettes, he would most likely get it from the elders in his family. There would definitely not be a lot. If he had such an internal cigarette, he would definitely not be willing to take it out to smoke. He would most likely show it off when there were many people.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I still have some of these cigarettes. There aren’t many here. Just take it as a small gift from me to director Wei.” I still have something I need your help with!”

“President Xia, you can just tell me what you need. You don’t have to give me such a precious gift ...” Deputy Director Wei said.

“This cigarette isn’t that precious.” Xia ruofei immediately interrupted Deputy Director Wei.”If you don’t accept it, I’ll be too embarrassed to trouble you.”

When Deputy Director Wei heard this, he could only put away his cigarette uneasily and said,””Thank you, director Xia ... If there’s anything I can help you with, just let me know!”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved the lunchbox in his hand.””The first thing is that I’d like to trouble director Wei to point me in the right direction. Where is the tap? I want to wash the lunchbox ...”

Deputy Director Wei couldn’t help but be stunned. How could this be called a problem?

However, he quickly reacted and said,””President Xia, I’ll just get someone to wash it. You don’t have to do it yourself! This isn’t how you treat your guests!”

Before Xia ruofei could decline, Deputy Director Wei shouted from the corridor,””Little Xu! Xiao Xu!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“They’re coming!” In an office not far away, a young man heard his leader’s call and quickly jogged to Deputy Director Wei. He was slightly out of breath as he asked,”director, what can I do for you?”

“Sorry to trouble you, but please help President Xia wash the lunchbox!” Deputy Director Wei said.

“Director Wei, I can ...” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.

Before he could finish, Xiao Xu had already snatched the lunchbox from Xia ruofei’s hands and said,””President Xia, leave this small matter to me. Please wait a moment!”

Then, without waiting for Xia ruofei to decline, she ran off with the lunchbox.

“Clean it up!” Deputy Chief Wei was still urging him loudly.

“Don’t worry!” When Xiao Xu said this, they had already reached the washroom at the end of the corridor. There was a faucet and a sink outside the washroom.

Deputy Director Wei smiled at Xia ruofei and said,””President Xia, you asked for my help, could it be this? This is a bit ...”

“There’s one more thing!”Xia ruofei laughed.

Deputy Chief Wei immediately heaved a sigh of relief and quickly said,”What are your orders?”

“I can’t call it an order!” Xia ruofei said,”I just want to ask director Wei to accompany me on a trip. The security here is tight, and I’m afraid that I won’t be able to come back ...”

Then, Xia ruofei explained,”didn’t you say that the children who sent the lunchboxes were at the entrance of the park?” I want to go see them and return the lunchbox. You can’t just accept the lunchbox after you’ve eaten it, right?”

Deputy Director Wei chuckled and said,”if President Xia accepted the lunchbox, the fans would be even happier!” But it’s not a problem if you want to go out, I’ll go with you!”

Deputy Director Wei also wanted to check if his daughter would not listen to him and secretly go to the entrance of the park.

Wei Xue was usually well – behaved, but if it was related to Xia ruofei, that might not be the case.

At the very least, Deputy Director Wei did not have much confidence.

After Deputy Director Wei finished speaking, he thought of something else and quickly said,””President Xia, when I took the lunchbox just now, I told the children that you won’t be leaving the supercomputer Center for the whole night. I advised them to go home early and not wait there. I don’t know if they’ve already left ...”

...

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”let’s go and take a look!” Forget it. By the way, director Wei, isn’t your daughter with the other children? If you can’t find her later, I’ll have to trouble you to bring the lunchbox home and ask Wei Xue to help pass it to her!”
