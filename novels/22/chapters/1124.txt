Chapter 1125: Yingzi wooden incense cabinet (2)

Translator: 549690339

Then, Zhao Yongjun introduced Xia ruofei and song Rui to the few people beside them.

One of them was an old man with white hair and a white beard. He was wearing a Tang suit and looked like a Sage. His name was Guo Ruchen. He was the Vice President of the capital city’s antique Association and was quite famous in the antique circle.

There was also a chubby man in his forties, wearing a short linen sleeve, a gold Nannan bracelet on his hand, and a pipe in his mouth. He squinted his small eyes, and seemed to always have a smile on his face, like a Maitreya Buddha.

According to Zhao Yongjun’s introduction, the stout man’s name was an Deming. He was an antique dealer in Jingang and had done business with Zhao Yongjun and Xu Qiang a few times. People in the industry called him “fatty an.”

The last person was dressed a little uncouth and looked very reserved. He didn’t even know where to put his hands.

According to Xu Qiang’s introduction, this uncouth middle – aged man was called Wang xingshui, a distant relative of fatty an in the countryside. This item was found by Wang xingshui in the old house in the countryside.

While Xu Qiang was introducing, Xia ruofei’s eyes stayed on Wang xingshui for two more seconds.

Wang xingshui looked like a farmer. He seemed rather restrained in the luxurious Hall and was a little restrained. However, Xia ruofei felt that his evasive gaze was not entirely out of restraint. In fact, the rustic clothes he was wearing felt a little out of place.

However, Xia ruofei was only here to watch the show, so he didn’t say anything.

After a simple introduction, Zhao Yongjun asked,””Qiangzi, where is the thing?”

Without waiting for Xu Qiang to speak, fatty an said with a smile,””Brother Jun, this is the incense cabinet. My relative found it in the old house in the countryside. Can you take a look at it for brother Qiang?”

Fatty an was much older than Xu Qiang and Zhao Yongjun, but he called them “brother Jun” and “brother Qiang” very smoothly, without the slightest embarrassment.

Zhao Yongjun’s gaze fell on a wooden cabinet on the carved coffee table. Xia ruofei looked over as well.

The cabinet was about 80 centimeters high and looked dignified and simple, with an ancient style.

Zhao Yongjun walked closer to take a look. He even took out a small flashlight and checked it carefully.

“Woof! This is Ying zimu’s old toy?” Zhao Yongjun couldn’t help but show a surprised expression.

Fatty an said with a smile,”big brother Jun has good eyes!” This was passed down from my distant cousin’s family. Cousin, tell brother Jun about this item’s origin!”

The uncouth Wang xingshui stuttered,””This thing ... Was passed down from my ancestors. I ... I heard from my grandfather that it has been passed down for seven or eight generations! There used to be a shrine that came with it, but I lost it when I moved ...”

Fatty an also chimed in from the side,”big brother Jun, big brother Qiang, I saw that shrine when I was young. I still have some impression of it. It should be red sandalwood!” If it had been kept until now, it would have been worth a lot of money!”

Xia ruofei’s eyesight was better. Even though he did not get close, he could see the small incense cabinet more clearly.

He saw that there were some patterns on the wood of the incense cabinet. It was a bit like the big wave pattern on the Phoebe zhennan wood that he sold to Tang He last time.

After hearing Zhao Yongjun mention the “Ying Zi wood”, Xia ruofei could roughly guess. In fact, the patterns on the Phoebe zhennan wood were also formed by the tumours caused by the disease in the trunk. The Ying Zi wood that Zhao Yongjun mentioned was probably in the same situation.

“Big brother Jun, can you take a look?” Xu Qiang asked with a smile.

Zhao Yongjun pouted.”I’m not very good at identifying wooden artifacts. I can only look at it roughly. Qiangzi, you’ve got the wrong person!” By the way, what is elder Guo’s opinion?”

The sage – like Guo Ruchen smiled and said,””Director Zhao, I don’t know much about wood items, but this item looks old.”

Zhao Yongjun nodded.”Yes, it looks like it’s from the Ming Dynasty. If it’s been passed down for seven or eight generations, then it should be about the same time.”

Xu Qiang revealed a hint of joy and asked,””Jun bro, so this cabinet is reliable?”

Xia ruofei noticed that fatty an and Wang xingshui’s eyes quickly met, revealing a trace of joy that was deeply hidden.

Although it was only for a short moment, Xia ruofei was keenly aware that Wang xingshui’s eyes did not have a trace of the ignorance of an old farmer. Instead, there was a cunning light.

Xia ruofei’s suspicion grew, but he didn’t make a sound. He only secretly used his divine sense to contact Xia Qing who was in the space.

Xia ruofei didn’t know much about antiques, so he wanted to ask Xia Qing if she knew about it.

Xia ruofei and Xia Qing were communicating with their divine thoughts, so no one in the room could detect it.

Very quickly, Xia ruofei released the space restriction, allowing Xia Qing to check the situation of the small incense cabinet through the space.

As the master of the space, Xia ruofei had absolute control over it. It was naturally easy for him to let Xia Qing receive the outside world’s situation.

As Xia Qing checked, she communicated with Xia ruofei using her divine sense. A meaningful smile gradually appeared on Xia ruofei’s face.

Zhao Yongjun listened to Xu Qiang’s words and couldn’t help but look at the small incense cabinet again, then said cautiously,””Qiangzi, it looks like an old object from the Ming Dynasty. And this kind of object that is made of Ying wood inside and outside is relatively rare. But I don’t have much contact with wood, so I can’t see it clearly!”

Xu Qiang listened to Zhao Yongjun’s words and felt very conflicted. On one hand, he was itching for a fight and was afraid of missing out on something good. On the other hand, he was worried that he had made an error in judgment. The chubby Xi’an had offered two million for this item. Although it was not a loss for Xu Qiang, it would not be good for his reputation if it was out of his sight.

Zhao Yongjun saw Xu Qiang’s expression and couldn’t help but laugh,””Qiangzi, since you can’t see it, you should find an expert! You asked old Guo and me to come over, but we don’t specialize in wood, what advice can we give you?”

Xu Qiang actually knew that, but this kind of thing was just to find psychological comfort. In fact, he was already very inclined to buy it, but he wanted to hear Zhao Yongjun and Guo Ruchen’s opinions.

If Zhao Yongjun and Guo Ruchen were also optimistic about it, then Xu Qiang would not hesitate.

Xu Qiang smiled bitterly and said,”I originally wanted to ask President Chen to help me take a look, but he just happened to not be in Beijing. I heard that there was an old set of golden Phoebe zhennan in Yubei province ...”

Zhao Yongjun’s mouth twitched as he said to fatty an,””Boss an, why don’t you just wait a little longer? Qiangzi must be sincere in wanting to buy it, but I still want President Chen to help me take a look. ”

Fatty an smiled bitterly.”Brother Jun, it’s not that I don’t want to give brother Qiang face. My distant cousin’s family has run into some trouble. He’s in urgent need of money, so he had no choice but to sell his family heirloom.”

Wang xingshui also said nervously,””My youngest son has leukemia, and his medical expenses are hundreds of thousands! I’m just waiting for the money to save my life ...”

Fatty an then added,””Brother Qiang, if you’re not sure, let’s just forget about this matter! Boss Xue from the north of the city is also very interested in this incense cabinet. I’ll go and talk to boss Xue with my cousin. ”

“Please don ‘t, boss an!” Xu Qiang quickly said. I didn’t say I didn’t want it, there’s still a first come, first served basis for everything! I haven’t even taken care of my side yet, and you’re already looking for Xue Mazi?”

Xue Mazi from the north of the city was also a well – known figure in the antique circle. He also had some grudges with Xu Qiang, so the two had never been on good terms.

Xu Qiang had always been very interested in this Yingzi wooden incense cabinet. In addition, fatty an had said that he wanted to sell the incense cabinet to Xue Mazi, so Xu Qiang naturally became anxious all of a sudden. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Fatty an smiled and said,”Qiang – GE, I understand the rules!” To be honest, boss Xue has offered 2.1 million Yuan, but I’ve already promised you, so I’m here to show it to you. But if you don’t want it, you can’t stop me from selling it to boss Xue!”

“That’s for sure,”said Xu Qiang. Old an, please wait a little longer ...”

“Alright, alright, alright. Brother Qiang, take a good look at it.” Fatty an said with a smile,”but boss Xue is pressing us. You’d better make a decision as soon as possible ...”

Fine beads of sweat appeared on Xu Qiang’s forehead. Obviously, he was also having an intense psychological struggle.

However, he had already decided to take down the incense cabinet. Under fatty an’s urging, Xu Qiang quickly made up his mind and gritted his teeth.””Alright! Boss an, I ...”

At this moment, Xia ruofei suddenly said,””Wait a moment!”
