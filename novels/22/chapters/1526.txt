Chapter 1527: Upgrade! Upgrade!_2

Translator: 549690339

In its eyes, precious herbs were no different from ordinary weeds. Since they were blocking its way, it would naturally destroy them. It did not expect Xia ruofei to have such a big reaction.

“Do you still dare to run around?” Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and asked,”you still dare to ignore me ... It seems like you’re not repenting even if you die!”

“Master,” Xia Qing said weakly,”you’ve confined him. He can’t move at all!”

“I’m so angry that I’m confused ...” Xia ruofei smacked his head and relaxed the restriction a little. However, he still restricted the white fox to a certain area.

“Do you still dare to run around?” Xia ruofei asked with a vicious expression.

The white fox kept shaking its head. Its two forelimbs were cupped together, making it look pitiful.

Seeing the White realmfox acting cute, Xia ruofei couldn’t get angry even if he wanted to. However, he still said with a straight face,””Remember, it’s fine for you to comprehend the laws of space here, but you can’t damage a single grain of sand, stone, grass, or tree. Otherwise, don’t blame me for imprisoning you. Do you understand?”

The White realmfox shook its head out of habit, but it immediately came to its senses and nodded its head like a chick pecking at rice.

“Go!” Only then did Xia ruofei let go of the white fox.”Remember, do not destroy those herbs!”

The white fox ran towards the herb garden as if it had been pardoned. This time, it did not dare to run around recklessly. It carefully avoided the herbs and soon arrived at a spatial node it had found. It then closed its eyes and began to comprehend.

Xia ruofei shook his head helplessly and asked,””Xia Qing, when the spirit map world is absorbing the world stone, do we need to take that little fellow out first?”

Xia Qing said,”master, every time the seal of the spirit map world is unlocked, the spatial fluctuations are at their most intense. You should just let it stay inside!” This will be very beneficial for its comprehension of the spatial laws. ”

“Don’t worry,” Xia Qing said.”I’ll take good care of it!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”okay!” But I have to bring Song Wei out. ”

With so many realm stones this time, the spirit map space could definitely be upgraded if nothing unexpected happened. Xia ruofei did not know what would happen when the space was upgraded. With Xia Qing and the realm Fox’s cultivation, it would not be a big problem to stay in the space. However, for safety reasons, it was better to let Song Wei leave the space.

With a thought, Xia ruofei and Song Wei left the spirit map space.

He first settled Song Wei on the bed in the bedroom, then picked up the ancient spirit painting scroll and used his mind to establish a connection with the space.

The spirit map space was at the primal realm.

A box containing 12 world stones automatically opened, and one of the world stones slowly floated up.

An invisible force wrapped around the world stone. Under the faint light that it emitted, the world stone slowly became smaller and finally turned into nothingness.

Soon after, the Second World stone slowly floated into the air and soon bloomed with a dazzling light.

The third one ... The fourth one ... The fifth one ...

At the mountain and sea realm, the White realm Fox, which had lost itself in comprehending the laws of space, suddenly opened its eyes. Even though it was in a completely independent space, it could still keenly sense the aura of the world stone. Moreover, it could easily discover that the world stone was disappearing one by one.

The White realmfox’s face showed a pained expression, but it quickly changed.

This was because it sensed that the spatial fluctuations in the entire spirit map world had suddenly become active.

The space rules that were originally a little obscure became even clearer.

The White realmfox had no idea what was going on, but it naturally wouldn’t let go of such a good opportunity to comprehend the rules. Therefore, it immediately concentrated and began a new round of comprehension.

In the hotel room outside, Xia ruofei also felt that the spirit map space had finally begun its upgrade process after absorbing five world stones.

He didn’t let the spirit map space continue to absorb the world stones. Instead, he kept the spirit map scroll in his palm and then looked at Song Wei who was lying quietly.

The upgrade of the spirit map space required some time, and Xia Qing would naturally inform him after it was completed.

Looking at Song Wei who seemed to be sleeping soundly, Xia ruofei felt a deep sense of guilt. He also secretly decided that no matter what price he had to pay, he would make song Wei recover.

“I hope I can find a way to cure Song Wei after the realm upgrades ...” Xia ruofei thought to himself.

The sky outside the window had already darkened. Xia ruofei had come out of the underground palace in the afternoon. On the way, he went to buy medicine, check into a hotel, and then stayed in the interspace for more than eight hours. It was already night.

Xia ruofei did not eat or drink for the entire day. However, he was not in the mood to eat. In fact, at his level of cultivation, not eating for one or two days would not affect him at all.

Xia ruofei stayed by Song Wei’s side. After more than an hour, Xia Qing finally informed him that the spirit map space had been upgraded.

Xia ruofei took out the spirit map scroll without hesitation and entered the space.

The concentration of spirit Qi in the spirit map’s space had increased once again.

Clouds appeared in the sky. These clouds were all formed by the condensation of the liquefied spiritual energy. When these clouds gathered to a certain scale, they would even form spiritual liquid, which would fall on the ground like rain.

This was pure spirit Rain. One could imagine that anything that was planted in such an environment would definitely grow well.

There were no other changes to the Archean realm. It had stopped expanding a long time ago.

Xia ruofei immediately went to the mountain and sea realm.

Unsurprisingly, the area of the mountain and sea realm had expanded greatly once again.

Now, Xia ruofei’s control over space was much stronger than before. He didn’t even need to patrol. With a slight thought, every blade of grass and tree in the entire mountain sea realm would be under his control.

As for the area of this space, Xia ruofei didn’t need to measure it as he already knew it in his heart.

Eight thousand mu.

The land and sea area of the entire mountain sea realm had reached 8000 mu, which was double the size of the previous realm.

By now, the mountain sea realm was already larger than the entire area of Paradise Farm in Australia.

The ocean was also expanding. Now, one could no longer see the space membrane at a glance. It was already as vast as the outside world.

Of course, with Xia ruofei’s eyesight, he could still easily see the space membrane at the end of the sea.

The land had also expanded by more than twice its original size. The mountain and sea realm, which was originally filled with a large number of herb gardens, along with a breeding ground for Hornets, and a garden for cultivating Cordyceps, had once again become empty.

The mountain peak with the stone chamber had almost doubled in height, and had become a steep peak from the original small hill. Standing at the foot of the mountain, the cave had become a small black dot.

A waterfall also appeared on the peak of the mountain. It was as if white silk fell from the sky, flowing into the surging River that had also widened.

Xia ruofei was not very interested in the changes in the space. He was more concerned about the injury of Song Wei’s soul. After a brief inspection, he turned his eyes to Xia Qing.

Xia Qing’s expression was a little awkward, and she said weakly,””Master, it seems like the world stones we obtained this time have not been used up ...”

Xia ruofei was stunned. Xia Qing’s meaning was clear. It was not enough to upgrade the space by one level. It might need to be upgraded again.

He was stunned for a while before he said,””I know ...”

Xia ruofei did not hesitate and left the spirit map space with a thought.

After returning to the outside world, he didn’t want to waste any time. He immediately used his mind to connect to the spirit map space, allowing the newly upgraded space to start absorbing world stones again.

There were seven world stones left. Hopefully, they could last until the realm leveled up again ... Xia ruofei paid attention to the absorption of the world stones as he prayed in his heart.
