2476 Reaching an agreement (1)

Zhou leiyun revealed a confident smile and said,””President Xia, you’re not an outsider, so I don’t have to hide anything from you. In fact, this transfer is infinitely close to success!”

Zhou leiyun paused for a moment, then continued,””This season, the Shengang club, where Wu Lei is, should have no problem winning the league title. The Shengang club had shown great sincerity to Wu Lei’s decision to stay abroad. They were very supportive of it! As for Wu Lei himself, I’m sure he’s willing to go to a higher level platform to show off and pursue his dreams!”

“Oh?” Xia ruofei said,”if the club doesn’t set up any obstacles, it won’t be a big problem.”

“Yes, I am!” Zhou leiyun nodded and said,”in fact, Shengang club is indeed very generous. They have also made a lot of concessions in terms of the transfer fee. You know, the transfer fees for domestic players are very high. If we follow the domestic market, no European club will buy our players. In addition, Wu Lei’s salary in China was too high. A player of his level would definitely not be able to get that much money in Europe. And if he were to be paid such a high salary, the rest of the team would definitely ask for a raise, and the financial balance that I’ve been working hard to achieve for the past two years would be broken in an instant. ”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”the central Super League is a little prosperous now!” The transfer fees and the players ‘salaries are all unreasonably high. No wonder so many big – Name star players come to China to make money. ”

Zhou leiyun nodded and said,”this time, Wu Lei himself is also very eager to facilitate this transfer. He took the initiative to offer a salary reduction. In addition, Shengang club will subsidize Wu Lei’s salary. The only condition is that if Wu Lei chooses to return to play after his contract with us expires, Shengang club will have priority under the same conditions.”

“This is very sincere!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”then I’ll have to congratulate you in advance, general manager Zhou. If you can’t even sign him, then your team can have a change of manager.”

Zhou leiyun laughed.”We’ve basically reached an agreement now. There are still some details that are waiting to be finalized. Next, we’ll have to announce it.”

Zhou leiyun then asked,”how is it?” President Xia, are you interested in playing football together?”

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said,””I’m actually quite interested. Is general manager Zhou really willing to part with her?”

“Of course!” Zhou leiyun said happily,”director Xia, I’ll give you 25% of the shares! I’ll just keep about 30% for myself!”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei said,”just calculate it according to the current valuation. I’ll transfer the amount as soon as possible.”

Zhou leiyun said nonchalantly,”the Spanish club has not been very popular in the past two years, and their market value has not changed much. You can just give them 30 million euros!” There’s no need to calculate so clearly!”

Xia ruofei nodded and smiled.””No problem, then I’ll take advantage of you!”

Xia ruofei knew that Zhou leiyun would not play any tricks on such an issue. 30 million euros for 25% of the shares was definitely a profit.

Moreover, once the news of Wu Lei joining RCD Espanyol was officially announced, RCD Espanyol’s market value would be affected by the huge Chinese market. With such a huge positive factor, it would definitely rise. Even Zhou leiyun’s glory World group’s stock price would probably rise. At this time, even if they bought RCD Espanyol’s shares at market price, it would definitely be a big profit. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Xia ruofei was very clear that Zhou leiyun was trying to be friendly. If he did not take advantage of the situation and insisted on evaluating the market value of the Spanish club and then buying the shares at the actual price, it would seem a little unreasonable. Moreover, the money from the difference was not a big deal to Xia ruofei or Zhou leiyun.

Hence, Xia ruofei agreed to Zhou leiyun’s plan without much hesitation.

“By the way, director Zhou, have you sold the team’s breast advertisement for the new season?” Xia ruofei asked.

There were still about 15 rounds left before the end of La Liga. This season’s chest advertisement must have been decided long ago and could not be changed halfway. Xia ruofei was interested in next season’s chest advertisement.

“I haven ‘t!” Zhou leiyun smiled and said,”now this sponsor wants to renew the contract with us, but considering that the team’s brand value will be greatly improved after bringing in Wu Lei, we have decided not to talk about the sponsorship contract for the chest advertisement for the time being. Why? Are you interested in it, President Xia?”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”of course!” If Wu Lei could successfully enter La Liga, it could be imagined that there would be a wave of enthusiasm in China. At that time, the Spanish team’s chest advertisement would be very popular! Especially if there’s a Chinese advertisement, it will definitely attract the attention of the Chinese audience!”

“No problem! Since you’re interested, I’ll leave it to you!” Zhou leiyun smiled and said,”the price will be the same as the current sponsorship price. Our sponsorship contract for the chest advertisement had just expired this season. It was signed for five years and a total of ten million euros, which is equivalent to two million euros a year. How does President Xia want to sign it? It’s fine to sign for a year, or a few more years. ”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”let’s sign a contract for a season first!” After Wu Lei joined, the team’s influence will definitely increase greatly. I can’t take advantage of this! Besides ... Two million euros was definitely low. Three million euros a season, and we have the priority to renew the contract. “
