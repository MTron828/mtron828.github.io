Chapter 636: Inspiring people (3)

After Lu You and Huanhuan went back, Xia ruofei used the night time to process six parts of the array disc.

Under elder song’s arrangement, li Zhifu also went to the hospital for a comprehensive examination.

The results were very gratifying. It was supposed to be a late – Stage cancer that had spread to many organs in the body. However, this examination found that the cancer cells at the spreading areas had disappeared without a trace, and the tumor at the original lesion had also shrunk greatly. It was basically the earliest stage of cancer.

Even without Xia ruofei’s help, li Zhifu’s illness could be completely cured through surgery with the current medical level. However, he still needed regular follow – up to prevent a recurrence.

Of course, with the ‘miracle doctor’, Xia ruofei, elder song would not arrange for li Zhifu to receive treatment in the hospital.

Otherwise, wouldn’t he be neglecting the essentials and pursuing the trifles?

Besides, he didn’t know if an old man in his 90s could take the surgery!

Li Zhifu stayed in Sanshan city for more than a week. During this time, he continued to take the Chinese medicine provided by Xia ruofei.

Then, he took ye Lingyun and three days ‘worth of Chinese medicine and returned to Mount Wuyishan City.

Xia ruofei planned to follow the current treatment plan and let li Zhifu take the medicine for another month. Then, he would be completely cured.

As the spirit Heart Flower petal solution was diluted, the entire treatment process would only consume a little more than one petal at most, definitely less than two.

As for Chengcheng, Xia ruofei had been using the health soup to treat him.

Every three days, Xia ruofei would send a veteran to deliver the medicine to the Hengfeng hotel in the city center.

......

During this period, Xia ruofei also personally went to check on Chengcheng’s condition.

What made Xia ruofei overjoyed was that after half a month, Chengcheng’s condition had obviously improved.

The most obvious sign was that Chengcheng had begun to grow attached to his mother, Xue bi Yun. Although he didn’t know how to express himself, he would take the initiative to get close to Xue bi Yun. Once, he even hugged Xue bi Yun tightly, his little face pressed against her body, causing her to burst into tears.

One of the most obvious characteristics of children with autism was that they were very indifferent to everything around them. They didn’t care about anything at all, and their attitude towards relatives and strangers was basically the same.

To put it bluntly, it was an obvious flaw in the emotional aspect.

Being able to show closeness and attachment to relatives was also an important indicator of the recovery level of children with autism.

In addition, there were also some obvious improvements, such as walking on tiptoes, inexplicable circles, and crying and making a fuss without warning.

As for his speech, he didn’t seem to have made much progress.

However, this was also a normal phenomenon. Since Chengcheng was born until now, he had not properly spoken a single word. Even if his autism and epilepsy were completely cured, he still had to learn how to speak from scratch.

However, this was only equivalent to learning to speak a few years later than other children. If the root of his problem was cured, he would be able to reach the intelligence level of a normal child, and it was only a matter of time before he learned to speak.

He had eye contact with others, knew how to listen, could listen to instructions, and had a clear sense of closeness to his family ... In Xia ruofei’s notebook, he had recorded these words.

Every time Chengcheng made a new improvement, Xia ruofei would record it in his notebook. At the same time, he would be more and more excited.

After a few days, Xue bi Yun called Xia ruofei. Her voice was obviously trembling, and she even sounded like she was crying,”Doctor Xia, just now ... Just now, Chengcheng called me mom!”

“That’s great! Aunt Xue, congratulations!”

These days, the excited Xue bi Yun had been trying to teach Chengcheng to speak. She was not a professional teacher, but under her tireless efforts, Chengcheng had finally taken this crucial step.

Xia ruofei was also very excited. After he hung up the phone, he immediately jotted down the words “first time calling mom” in his little notebook.

Then, Xia ruofei lit a cigarette and took a few deep puffs to calm himself down. He mumbled to himself,””The preliminary drug test should be considered a success ...”

Even if Chengcheng doesn’t make any further progress in the future, of course, the possibility of this is very low. Based on the current effect, the heart nourishing soup is very effective in the treatment of autism. It can even be said to have completely subverted the mainstream theory of autism treatment, and definitely has epoch – making significance.

It’s time to speed up the pace!

Xia ruofei stubbed out his cigarette and picked up his phone to call Feng Jing.
