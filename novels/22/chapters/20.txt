Chapter 21: Sister Lin Qiao

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Changping County was located in the east of Three Mountain City and was close to the East Sea. Three Mountain City’s only international airport was located by the sea in Changping County, so its overall economic development level was above average among the eight counties in the five districts of Three Mountain City.

Hu Zi’s family lived in Little Island Village in Linhai Town. This small fishing village was more than 20 kilometers away from Changping County.

Xia Ruofei came out of the station and booked a taxi for 200 yuan and went straight to Little Island Village.

Xia Ruofei also knew about Hu Zi’s family situation. Hu Zi’s father was a traditional fisherman. Ten years ago, he was caught in a typhoon when he went out to sea and never returned. After that, the family relied on Hu Zi’s mother to repair the fishing nets and do odd jobs to support them.

Hu Zi’s sacrifice made things worse for this family. That was why Xia Ruofei felt so guilty.

The taxi stopped at the entrance of the village. After Xia Ruofei paid the fare, he got out and walked towards Hu Zi’s house at the east end of the village.

He carried a black military satchel and a large plastic bag in his hand. After all, he was here to visit an elder. It was definitely not good to come empty-handed, so before Xia Ruofei left, he had packed a large bag of vegetables produced in the Spiritual Map Space. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

In this small village by the sea, the air was filled with the smell of the sea. Xia Ruofei thought that he would be able to treat Hu Zi’s mother’s illness soon, and he was both excited and expectant. He could not help but speed up.

At this moment, there was a sudden commotion not far ahead.

A young girl’s voice was heard.

“Zhong Qiang! What do you want? Get out of my way!”

Xia Ruofei frowned and looked up.

He saw a girl carrying a bucket of water not far ahead and three young men were blocking her way.

The girl was about 17 or 18 years old. She was wearing a plain white T-shirt and a pair of blue jeans that had gone a little pale from washing.

However, ordinary clothes still could not hide her natural beauty. Her curvaceous figure still exuded attractive temptation even in the cheapest T-shirt.

Her face was also very delicate. Under her light eyebrows were large watery eyes that seemed to be able to speak, and her pale pink cherry lips were gently pursed. Because she was carrying water, her face was flushed, and there were small beads of sweat on her forehead, giving her a pitiful appearance.

The leader of the three, a young man with a tuft of green hair, said cheekily.

“Qiao’er, don’t be so fierce! I don’t mean anything else. I just want to invite you to the county city to play.”

The girl called Qiao’er said coldly.

“I’m not interested! Move!”

Zhong Qiang was not angry at all despite being turned down directly. He still smiled and said.

“Then let’s go for a ride on the beach! I just bought a new car. Do you want to try it?”

“I already said that I’m not interested! If you don’t move aside, I’ll call for help!” Qiao’er gritted her teeth and said coldly.

“Call for help? Lin Qiao, you’re too naive! Who in Little Island Village dares to interfere in Brother Qiang’s matters?” One of Zhong Qiang’s lackeys sneered.

Another sidekick chimed in.

“Lin Qiao, it’s your good fortune that Brother Qiang has taken a fancy to you! Don’t be shameless! By the way, I heard that your mother is quite seriously ill? If you follow our Brother Qiang, perhaps Brother Qiang will help your mother pay for treatment when he’s happy!”

Zhong Qiang nodded with a smile.

“Of course! Qiao’er, as long as you agree to be my girlfriend, I’ll pay for your mother’s treatment!”

With that, Zhong Qiang took a step forward to pull Lin Qiao’s hand. Lin Qiao was so frightened that her face turned pale.

Just as Zhong Qiang’s hand was about to touch Lin Qiao, a large hand grabbed Zhong Qiang’s wrist tightly like an iron hoop. Zhong Qiang immediately cried out in pain.

It was Xia Ruofei.

In fact, when Xia Ruofei heard that lackey call out Lin Qiao’s name, his expression had already turned cold. Then, he strode over.

Because—Tiger’s original name was Lin Hu, and he had a younger sister at home whose name was Lin Qiao.

Moreover, Xia Ruofei knew that in the entire Little Island Village, only Hu Zi’s family did not have direct water access at home because of their financial difficulties.

This girl’s name was Lin Qiao, and she was carrying water. It was obvious who she was.

“Who the hell are you? Let go! It hurts…” Zhong Qiang gritted his teeth and shouted.

Xia Ruofei snorted coldly. As he let go, he gently pushed forward. Zhong Qiang immediately fell to the ground.

Zhong Qiang stood up and glared fiercely at Xia Ruofei. He gritted his teeth and said.

“You’re an outsider, how dare you be so arrogant in our Little Island Village!”

A cold smile hung on Xia Ruofei’s face.

“Disappear while I’m still in a good mood!”

Xia Ruofei had used a lot of strength just now, causing Zhong Qiang to have some reservations, but this sentence immediately angered him.

Zhong Qiang thought about how this was Little Island Village, and there were three people on his side. What was there to be afraid of? After taking a sip, he shouted.

“F*ck! He really thinks he’s something else! Little Hui, Big Mao, beat him up!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the three of them rushed towards Xia Ruofei aggressively.

Lin Qiao couldn’t help but cry out in surprise. She was very worried for this righteous young man.

However, her scream stopped halfway. Her mouth was still wide open and she was unaware of it.

Because in almost an instant, Lin Qiao only felt her vision blur. She did not even see Xia Ruofei’s actions clearly. Then, she saw Zhong Qiang and the other two fly four to five meters away and land heavily on the ground, wailing non-stop.

Clearly all three were badly hurt.

Xia Ruofei’s lips curled up slightly as he thought to himself.

“My strength and speed are much better than before! Those petals are really good stuff…”

As if he had done something very unimportant, he gently dusted off his nonexistent hands and walked over to Lin Qiao. A caring look flashed in his eyes as he asked.

“Are you all right?”

Lin Qiao came back to her senses and quickly said.

“I’m fine, thank you…”

Xia Ruofei smiled and said.

“If there’s nothing else, let’s go! I’ll take you back!”

Without asking for Lin Qiao’s permission, he stuffed the plastic bag of super vegetables into Lin Qiao’s hands. Then, he picked up the bucket of water and strode towards Hu Zi’s house.

Lin Qiao looked at Zhong Qiang and the other two on the ground, and a trace of worry flashed across her eyes. She gritted her teeth and quickly followed Xia Ruofei.

Lin Qiao saw Xia Ruofei carrying the water easily and walk straight to her house without asking her. She couldn’t help but ask in curiosity.

“How … how did you know where my family lives?”

Xia Ruofei turned to Lin Qiao and smiled.

“Not only do I know where your family lives, I know your name is Lin Qiao. You’re eighteen years old. Chocolate is your favorite food. The idol you admire the most is Jolin Tsai…”

Xia Ruofei said a lot and Lin Qiao was stunned. She stood rooted to the ground and thought for a long time. Suddenly, a possibility flashed across her mind and she immediately revealed a happy expression.

Only then did she realize that Xia Ruofei had already walked away with the water.

Lin Qiao quickly chased after him and said as she jogged.

“You’re Brother Ruofei! Aren’t you?”
