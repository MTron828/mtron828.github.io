2905 Receiving the military arms (2)

Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng were flying at high speed under the night sky. The sea breeze was blocked outside the yuan Qi protective barrier. The two of them stood on their flying swords with a calm and composed look.

When the first glimmer of light appeared on the horizon, Xia ruofei finally saw the outline of the land near the horizon.

After flying over the ocean for more than ten hours, all he could see was the boundless ocean. The sight of the sea and the sky being the same color was indeed very spectacular, but if he had seen this scenery for more than ten hours in a row, it would actually be very boring.

Xia ruofei let out a long sigh of relief when he finally saw land.

In the future, it would be best to avoid such long distance flying as it would be too tiring. If it wasn’t an urgent matter, he would rather take the plane, even if it was slower than flying on a sword.

Xia ruofei took out his phone to check the GPS and found that his flight route was more or less correct. There was not much deviation.

He found the location of kuachakuros port, slightly adjusted the direction of the flight, and took Qingfeng Luo straight to the destination.

It was almost impossible to look at a mountain. In fact, it was almost the same as looking at the coastline. The land was clearly in sight, but with the speed of the sword Kinesis flight, the two of them still flew for more than half an hour before they finally arrived above the land.

After entering the land, Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng flew even higher. They were basically flying above the clouds. Of course, this was to avoid shocking the world.

Moreover, Xia ruofei had deliberately avoided the vicinity of the Civil Aviation routes. If he were to “scratch” the plane, it might cause a big problem.

Xia ruofei had always been suspicious. There were so many planes in modern society. It could be said that there were thousands of planes flying at the same time at every moment on the route. If cultivators above the Golden core stage were flying on swords, why had no one ever seen these ‘Immortals’? He had also never heard of any news of an inexplicable collision between planes.

He had asked Luo Qingfeng about this on the way and found out the whole story.”

First of all, when humans entered the age of flight, the cultivation environment on earth had begun to deteriorate, especially in the next 20 to 30 years. Therefore, the lifespan of golden core cultivators was actually getting fewer and fewer. The life expectancy of golden core cultivators was about 300 years at most. The spirit Qi on earth was poor, and they could not cultivate to a higher realm. Naturally, they slowly withered. Although the major sects could barely cultivate Qi refining cultivators, they could not break through to the Golden core realm in such a barren environment. This was simply a fool’s dream. Thus, the total number of cultivators above the Golden core stage had always been reduced.

In addition, even the existing Jindan cultivators were mostly old or close to the end of their lives. How would they have the leisure to ride their flying swords and fly around?

Therefore, in this era, there were very few cultivators who could ride flying swords.

In addition, cultivators who could ride flying swords had stronger spiritual power. For example, although Luo Qingfeng was much weaker than Xia ruofei, his spiritual power could also cover more than ten miles. With the spiritual power warning function, he could avoid accidents in most situations.

Xia ruofei had a general idea. Although cultivators and the secular world were inextricably linked, they were essentially two different groups from ordinary humans. They were even on a different level of life. Hence, cultivators would try their best to avoid unnecessary interactions with the secular world.

The two of them flew for about an hour, crossed the Mexico border, and finally arrived at the Gulf of Mexico on the other side.

Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng found a secluded place near kuachakuros port to descend and put away their flying swords.

“Master,” Luo Qingfeng asked.”Where are we going next?”

Xia ruofei took out his phone and said,””Give the contact person here a call first ... Oh right, the Hong sect members here are all Chinese too, so don’t call me master in front of others, just call me Mr. Xia!”

“Yes! Master!” “Yes!” Qingfeng Luo said respectfully.

“Also, do you want to change your appearance?” Xia ruofei asked.

Xia ruofei had just changed his appearance to look like “Xia Tian”. Luo Qingfeng was very impressed by Xia ruofei’s ability to change his appearance at will. Even for cultivators, it was a very novel technique.

“I don’t need it,” said Luo Qingfeng. Master, I’ve been cultivating in the sect all year round and rarely come to the secular world. It doesn’t matter even if I show my true face. ”

“Sure!” Xia ruofei nodded.

What Qingfeng Luo said made sense. Xia ruofei had to change his appearance because he had to appear in public as the chairman of paradise Corporation from time to time. Qingfeng, on the other hand, did not need to change his appearance.

For example, this time, if Xia ruofei had appeared in Mexico with his own appearance, he would definitely have left a record in the various surveillance facilities. The customs did not have his entry and exit record. If someone with ulterior motives noticed him, it would be troublesome.

While Xia ruofei was talking to Luo Qingfeng, he had already found the number that Li Yifu had given him and dialed it.

This phone was not the one that Xia ruofei usually used. He had bought a phone with an anonymous card and international roaming. He would use this phone when he appeared as ‘Xia Tian’.

The call went through very quickly. After five or six rings, the other party picked up.

Xia ruofei first heard a yawn, then a tired voice asked,””Who is it? You’re calling so early!”

The other party was speaking Spanish with a heavy accent. However, Xia ruofei had spent some time learning Spanish from the Spanish club, so he could understand it easily. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The official language of Mexico was Spanish, but Xia ruofei could tell that this man’s Spanish had a Chinese accent. So, he asked in Chinese,””I’m sorry to disturb your rest. Is this Mr. Zhang Chao?”

The person on the other end of the phone was stunned for a moment before he spoke in Chinese,””I’m Zhang Chao, and you are?”

“Oh! My surname is Xia, and Mr. Li Yifu asked me to look for you. He should have told you about receiving a batch of goods, right?” Xia ruofei said.

Zhang Chao was indeed sleeping just now. It was about 7 am local time. Many people who were used to sleeping late were still in bed.

However, when he heard Li Yifu’s name, he quickly sat up from the bed and said,””He did! He had said it! Mr. Xia, are you in America or Mexico?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”we’ve arrived at kuachakuros port. Mr. Zhang, are you free today?” We would like to hand over the goods as soon as possible. ”

“So fast!” Zhang Chao was very surprised, and then he quickly said,”yes! It was convenient! I’m free anytime! Mr. Xia, could you tell me your exact location? I’ll immediately send someone to pick you up!”

Xia ruofei looked around and said,””We’re near kuachakurakos port. This place should be called Port Road. There’s a Kolda shipping company next to it ...”

“I know this place!” Zhang Chao quickly said,”Mr. Xia, please wait here for a moment. I’ll get someone to pick you up immediately!”

“Alright, I’ll have to trouble Mr. Zhang then.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Oh right, there are two of us. We’re all Chinese. I’m wearing a beige casual suit and my companion is wearing a dark blue long – sleeved shirt.”

“Alright! Alright!” Zhang Chao quickly said,”please wait a moment. Oh, Mr. Xia, you can call me little Zhang or Zhang Chao!”

“Thank you! Zhang Chao!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng waited by the side of the road for about ten minutes. A business car drove over. A young man with a Chinese face looked at the two of them through the window, then quickly opened the door and got out. He jogged over and asked politely,””Are you Mr. Xia?”
