3096 Wild tea becomes (2)

Although these two wild tea trees were not as good as the one in the first heaven society, which had been growing for at least a few hundred years, they were still 40 to 50 centimeters in diameter and had luxuriant leaves. Xia ruofei would enter the spirit map space every day. Due to the flow of time, he could see the changes in the wild tea trees every day.

More than half a month had passed. Xia ruofei felt that it was time to try the effects of the wild tea.

Thus, he returned to his room early that night, locked the doors and windows, and set up defenses. Only then did he summon the spirit painting from his palm.

After entering the spirit map space, Xia ruofei used telepathy to call Xia Qing over.

He decided to harvest some of the tea leaves today. After he was done, he would head to the star Seizer sect and ask Luo Qingfeng to find a disciple to test the effects of the wild tea leaves he had transplanted.

He had drunk the first heaven society’s wild tea two or three times, so he was quite familiar with its taste.

Xia ruofei felt that the first heaven society’s wild tea had an obvious difference from his Dahongpao. It seemed to be more similar to West Lake Longjing tea.

Of course, whether it was in terms of taste or tea fragrance, wild tea was much better than the best West Lake Longjing tea.

Hence, Xia ruofei decided to process the wild tea leaves using the same method that he used to make green tea.

The tools for making tea leaves were already available in the interspace.

Although there were many differences in the production process and methods of rock tea and green tea, many of the tools were universal.

Xia ruofei had asked Xia Qing before and knew that Xia Qing was also good at making green tea Kasaya. It was estimated that immortal Shanhe was also a tea lover, so the spiritual Kasaya he made was also very proficient in the making of various tea leaves.

Since Xia Qing knew how to make it, Xia ruofei was naturally happy to be idle.

In any case, even if he were to do it himself, the quality of the tea leaves might not be as good as Xia Qing ‘s, so why would he add more trouble to himself?

Xia ruofei took Xia Qing and picked some tea leaves from the two wild tea trees. Then, he gave them to Xia Qing and divided them into two batches to make the tea. The tea leaves of the two wild tea trees could not be mixed together so that they could form a control group when testing the effects of the wild tea.

The wild tea leaves were lush, and only a small part was picked this time. After all, it was only for testing!

So, after Xia ruofei handed the task of making tea leaves to Xia Qing, he did not stay in the medium but directly returned to the room in the outside world.

Anyway, even if he failed, he still had enough tea leaves to continue trying.

Furthermore, Xia ruofei couldn’t wait any longer. After coming to the outside world, with the time flow being 30 times faster than that of an Archean realm expert, he would be able to see the results of the production very quickly.

Xia ruofei was watching a movie on his computer in the room outside when he received a voice transmission from Xia Qing.””Master, the two batches of tea leaves have been completed!”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei’s spirits were lifted. He quickly entered the spirit map space without even stopping the movie that was playing.

“Xia Qing, you’ve successfully produced it? Complete it in one go?” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but ask the moment he entered the Archean realm.

“That’s right!”Xia Qing slightly nodded. Master, I followed the traditional method of making green tea step by step. There were no mistakes in the process and no accidents. It was completed just like that. I just don’t know if the tea leaves meet the owner’s requirements. ”

Xia ruofei took a look and saw that the two jars in front of him were filled with two taels of tea leaves.

These tea leaves were all flat, and they were placed in a clay pot in a criss – Cross manner.

It looked very similar to the appearance of Longjing tea. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Xia ruofei had seen the wild tea of the first heaven society before. The appearance was indeed similar.

He picked it up and smelled it. The fragrance of the tea was very obvious.

Then, he immediately took out a tea set and skillfully boiled a pot of spirit pond water with a charcoal stove. He then took some newly made wild tea and put it in the teapot.

Once the boiling water was poured in, Xia ruofei immediately smelled the strong fragrance of tea.

After a series of smooth and natural processes, Xia ruofei held a small tea cup in his hand. He first sniffed the fragrance of the tea in front of his nose and then drank it in one gulp.

The fragrance was very strong and it was a smell that Xia ruofei was familiar with. Furthermore, the feeling of clarity made him feel relaxed and happy.

His eyes revealed a hint of joy.

Although the tea in the pot had only been made once, Xia ruofei still poured the tea leaves away with some heartache. After washing the tea set, he immediately took wild tea from another tree and made a new pot.

The taste was still the same, and it was very similar to the wild tea he had drunk before. It could even be said that there was no difference.

“Haha!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Xia Qing, you are really something!” Although these two wild tea trees were not as good as the one in the first heaven society, which had been growing for at least a few hundred years, they were still 40 to 50 centimeters in diameter and had luxuriant leaves. Xia ruofei would enter the spirit map space every day. Due to the flow of time, he could see the changes in the wild tea trees every day.
