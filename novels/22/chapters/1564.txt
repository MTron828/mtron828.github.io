Chapter 1565: Awkward (1)

Translator: 549690339

Song Wei was a little confused and said,”I feel like ... I had a very long ... Very long dream ... RUO Fei, what happened?” he asked.

Xia ruofei looked at Song Wei and did not know where to start. However, he was glad that Song Wei looked normal now and did not pounce on him like she did before.

“A lot of things happened. You were unconscious for a few days ...” Xia ruofei said.”We were separated in the underground palace that day. How did you end up in that stone room?”

“A stone room?” Song Wei was at a loss. She said,”I saw you suddenly disappear from the altar. I was very scared at that time. After waiting for a while, I didn’t see you, so I walked over ...”

There was still a trace of fear in Song Wei’s eyes as she said,”After I stepped onto the altar, I felt my vision blur, and then I appeared in a dark corridor. I was even more afraid, and I shouted your name while running forward ... And then ... And then I felt a cold wind blowing, and then I lost consciousness ... All my memories stopped there ...”

Xia ruofei’s face showed a strange expression. It seemed that Song Wei did not remember what happened after she woke up, or ... Did she really treat it as a dream?

When Song Wei recalled what had happened in the underground palace, she looked very scared. Her delicate body could not help but tremble. Xia ruofei leaned over and patted her shoulder, saying, “It’s alright, it’s alright ... We’re safe now ...”

Song Wei felt Xia ruofei’s body approaching her. A strong masculine aura hit her in the face. Then, she could not help but feel hot and dry. Her face showed a coquettish look, which was very different from her usual appearance.

Xia ruofei felt that Song Wei’s breathing was strange. He turned his head and looked at her. His heart skipped a beat and he quickly kept a distance from her.

Song Wei did not know why she was so sensitive. She thought that it was because she had special feelings for Xia ruofei. However, Xia ruofei was well aware that it must be the peach blossom miasma’s doing.

Xia ruofei felt a headache coming on. The miasma was too strange. If he could not get rid of it as soon as possible, what would happen to Song Wei? If she met someone with ulterior motives and was slightly teased, she might not be able to control her emotions ...

Song Wei blushed and asked in a low voice,””By the way, ruofei, where is this? Are we still in xiangnan province?”

She realized that she was in a hotel room and her body was very sensitive. She could clearly smell Xia ruofei’s scent on the bed and blanket.

Could it be that ... In the few days that he was unconscious, RUO Fei had been sleeping in the same bed as him? Song Wei could not help but think.

Xia ruofei said,”it’s a long story. We’ve already left xiangnan province. In order to wake you up, I need to find a medicinal herb. This medicinal herb can only be found in Dian province, so I took you out of xiangnan province that day. We’re now in Ruizhou city in Dian province ...”

“It seems like you’ve found the herb ... Thank you, ruofei!” Song Wei nodded.

Xia ruofei quickly said,”you’re injured because you helped me. I should be the one thanking you!” Right ... I was afraid that your family would be worried, so when you were unconscious, I used your fingerprint to unlock your phone and sent your mother a WeChat message ...”

“Ah?” Song Wei shrieked in shock. Her phone contained her own secret, and this secret was one that even her best friend, Zhuo Yiyi, did not know.

Song Wei hurriedly took out her phone from her pocket. As she unlocked it, she carefully asked,””Ruofei ... You ... Other than WeChat, do you have ...”

Xia ruofei felt awkward too. He knew what song Wei wanted to ask, but he would never admit it.

Hence, Xia ruofei immediately denied it. “”No, no! I opened WeChat and didn’t look at your chat history. I just found your mother’s WeChat and told her that she was safe!”

Only then did Song Wei let out a sigh of relief.

Xia ruofei looked at Song Wei and said,””It’s been a whole day. Why don’t you reply to your WeChat first? There were probably quite a few unread messages! After you reply ... I still have some things to tell you!”

“Yeah!” Song Wei nodded. Tell me what happened in the past few days ...”

Xia ruofei left the bedroom and went to the small living room to smoke a cigarette, giving Song Wei some space.

Song Wei touched her face and felt that it was still a little hot.

When she said that she could not remember anything, that was not the case. Song Wei felt that she was in a dream, and the dream was very charming. She was too embarrassed to mention it in front of Xia ruofei.

Song Wei clutched her phone tightly, her heart beating fast. Even though Xia ruofei said that he did not open any other applications on her phone, she still felt that she had no secrets in front of Xia ruofei.

She couldn’t tell why, but it was a woman’s intuition.

Song Wei shook her head to get rid of the distracting thoughts and lit up her phone screen.

Sure enough, there were a lot of unread messages, from family, classmates, and friends. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com
