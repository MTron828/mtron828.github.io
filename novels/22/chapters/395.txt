“Hello, Chief Judge song.” Xia ruofei answered the phone.

“How are you, RUO Fei!” “Have you been busy with work recently?” song Zhengping asked in a friendly tone.

In the past, song Zhengping and Tian Huilan had addressed Xia ruofei as “little Xia.” Today, Tian Huilan had changed to the more intimate “ruofei”, which had already surprised Xia ruofei. He didn’t expect song Zhengping to change his way of addressing him as well.

Xia ruofei felt that there was something wrong with the world.

However, he still politely said,””It’s alright, it’s just the farm stuff! Thank you for your concern, Chief Judge song. ”

“I heard from my father that you’ve been treating uncle li recently. Thank you for your hard work!” Song Zhengping said.

“You’re too polite. ” Xia ruofei said.

After the two of them exchanged some pleasantries, song Zhengping finally revealed his purpose of visit, somewhat embarrassed.

What made Xia ruofei’s jaw drop was that he was also making the call for the jaded skin ointment.

As it turned out, elder song was recuperating in Sanshan city. As the governor of a province and a high – ranking official of the border, song Zhengping naturally couldn’t visit him often. Therefore, his wife, as his daughter – in – Law, came to the southeast province a few days ago to visit elder song and fulfill her filial duty by his side.

Of course, Mrs. Song was also worried about her only son, song Rui, being in Sanshan city.

Tian Huilan had a very close relationship with the song family. In a sense, she was also part of the song family. Therefore, since Madam song had come to the three mountains, as the host, she naturally had to come out and entertain her.

When the two women met, they naturally didn’t talk about national affairs. In addition, after Tian Huilan had used the jaded skin ointment these few days, the effects were simply too amazing. Madam song couldn’t help but ask her for a secret skin care recipe.

Tian Huilan was well aware of Xia ruofei’s relationship with the song family, so she didn’t hide anything from Madam song. She told her everything and told her that the person who made the jaded skin ointment had a close relationship with the song family. It was the young Chinese medical doctor Who had cured elder Song, Xia ruofei.

Mrs. Song couldn’t forget the miraculous Jade skin cream. After returning to the Gu Ling courtyard, she called song Zhengping, who was far away in xiangnan. Over the phone, she ordered song Zhengping to get her a portion of the Jade skin cream.

Although song Zhengping was a high – ranking official of the border and was naturally awe – inspiring in front of the officials and people of xiangnan province, he was a little afraid of his own family. He did not dare to refuse his wife’s request.

Hence, after a long internal struggle at work, song Zhengping decided to call Xia ruofei.

To be honest, song Zhengping was a little embarrassed. The dignified provincial judge had actually called a young man personally for a Facial Mask. Even he felt a little embarrassed.

Xia ruofei immediately smiled and said,””Chief Judge song, so Mrs. Song is also in Sanshan city! I didn’t know about it before, otherwise I would have taken the initiative to give her a set. I’m so rude ...” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Ruofei, please don’t say that.” Song Zhengping said,”my wife only arrived at San Shan yesterday. After having dinner with comrade Huilan, she came back and kept asking me to get that face mask from you. I’m really embarrassed to say this ...”

“Hey! Governor song, even if Madam song didn’t say it, I would still give it to her. ” Xia ruofei said,”this jadeskin ointment is very effective for middle – aged and elderly women’s skin and body. I was planning to give some to my elders and friends. Since Madam song is at San Shan, I’ll send it to Gu Ling courtyard today!”

“There’s no need to. I’ve already troubled you enough. ” Song Zhengping said,”if you have ready – made jaded skin ointment, I’ll get Xiao Rui to go to your farm to get it. He can also visit uncle li. This child is so insensible. Uncle li has been living on your farm for so many days, but he didn’t even say that he wanted to visit ...”

“That’s fine. Tell song Rui to give me a call before he comes over.” Xia ruofei said,”I’ve been a little busy recently. I’ve been running between the city and the farm. I don’t want to waste my time.”

“Alright, thank you, ruofei!” Song Zhengping said affectionately.

“You’re welcome, you’re welcome,” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei’s expression was a little strange. He had not even started promoting the jaded skin cream! In a short while, he had received several phone calls. It seemed that he had underestimated the Fatal Attraction of a phenomenal cosmetic product to women!

“There shouldn’t be any more calls for me now, right?” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly as he muttered to himself.

As he put the phone back into the storage compartment, he changed gears and stepped on the gas, driving away from the empty warehouse.

As Xia ruofei drove, he said in his heart,”It seemed that he would have to make more jaded skin ointment when he returned.

This was nothing to Xia ruofei. After all, it was the same as chasing one sheep or a herd of sheep. The production of jaded skin ointment was not difficult, just that it would take some time.

Xia ruofei calculated in his heart. He decided not to go back to the farm first. Instead, he went to buy a larger claypot and some other tools for decocting the medicine. This way, he could decoct at least 30 portions of Jushi ointment at a time, which would greatly improve the efficiency.

After driving back to the farm, Xia ruofei locked himself in his room and entered the spirit map space to start brewing the jaded skin ointment again.

More than an hour later, 30 portions of jaded skin ointment were freshly made.
