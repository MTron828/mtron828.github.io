Chapter 1460: An eye – opener (2)

Translator: 549690339

After saying that, manager Bai looked at the bustling ancient tower Street with a look of disdain.

“It’s our freedom to eat wherever we like. We don’t need you to worry about this!” Guan Ping said in a tone that was neither haughty nor humble.

Manager Bai’s expression changed slightly, and a cold light flashed in her eyes. However, she quickly put on a wronged expression and said in a sweet voice,””Manager Liu, your new employee seems to have a lot of opinions about me!”

Seeing this, manager Liu reached out and patted the back of manager Bai’s hand. He glanced at Guan Ping in disgust, cleared his throat, and said,”Guanping, although the company doesn’t prohibit employees from drinking after work, you’re so drunk, how can it not affect your work tomorrow? Besides, how could there be working hours in sales? Many of the colleagues from the other teams were still showing their clients around at this time! Your team’s performance this month is at the bottom again. Don’t you feel any sense of urgency?”

Guan Ping’s face was filled with shock as he said,”Manager Liu, it’s the third day of the first lunar month today. You still have three days before work ...”

Only then did store manager Liu realize that he had said something wrong. He said angrily,””I’m talking about this! His sales performance was a mess, and he still had the mood to come out and drink? What’s wrong with the third day of the first month? Bai Lingling from Guan Peng’s team even brought clients to look at houses on the first day of the new year!”

Bai Lingling was manager Bai’s cousin, and she was also working at the same store that Guanping was currently working at. She had also inherited manager Bai’s style of dressing up every day. Coupled with her relationship with manager Bai, she was well – liked by both the manager and the store manager.

However, it was pure nonsense to bring clients to see houses on the first day of the first month.

Who would receive house – viewing visitors on the first day of the first lunar month? Even if he was in a hurry to buy a house, it shouldn’t be during the new year, right?

Moreover, this season was the off – season for second – hand house transactions. Usually, there were not many orders, not to mention the Spring Festival holiday.

Guan Ping’s mouth twitched, and he didn’t explain anything.

This store manager Liu was obviously looking for trouble. He had nothing better to do than to criticize manager Bai and please manager Bai. After all, a higher position was more important than a higher position, so he had to listen to whatever manager Bai said.

Manager Bai said with a smile,”manager Liu, it seems like little Guan isn’t convinced!” I can see that your prestige in the shop is only average! Even a Deputy Director dared to show you attitude! This kind of situation would never happen in our shop ...”

When store manager Liu heard this, he was even more furious. He glared at Guanping and said,””Guanping, what’s with your attitude! You can’t say, can you?”

He didn’t like Guanping to begin with, and manager Bai had even specifically said that she wanted to teach Guanping a lesson. Therefore, he had often criticized Guanping. Now that Guanping didn’t even give him any face in front of manager Bai, he was naturally even more displeased.

“I didn’t say anything, manager Liu,” Guan Ping said, suppressing his anger.”Whatever you say goes. What attitude do you still need?”

“Look at you now. Do you still look like a subordinate?” Store manager Liu said,”don’t you know the most basic manners when meeting your superior? How did you pass the training? Also, you’re always in the shop looking bitter and hateful. Who are you trying to show your face to? I’m telling you, if you don’t want to work, then get lost! Pioneer real estate doesn’t lack a so – called sales star like you!”

Guan Ping could feel the fury in his chest burning, and his gaze turned sharp.

In the sales industry, he had faced all kinds of customers and was often bullied. It could be said that he had been trained. During this period of time in the store, store manager Liu would often reprimand him for no reason. Sometimes, his words were even worse than this, but he had to endure it.

However, it was clearly after work hours today, and yet these two people still had nothing better to do than to find trouble with him. Furthermore, they did it in front of his brother Xia ruofei. This made Guan Ping unable to hold back.

Just as Guanping was about to explode, Xia ruofei, who had been watching from the side, finally could not hold it in anymore.

He said lazily,”you two, that’s enough!” Have you had enough of showing off? Just go wherever you need to go, a moment in the spring night is worth a thousand gold!”

Xia ruofei glanced at manager Bai after he finished speaking, a mocking smile on his face.

“Who are you?” Manager Bai glanced at Xia ruofei, then glared at Guan Ping and said,”little Guan, this is your friend! Tell him to watch his words! I can Sue him for slander!”

“I’m sure Guanping’s the one who’s spreading these rumors,” store manager Liu chimed in.”They’re getting more and more out of hand!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh when he heard that. These two people were really shameless to a certain extent.

Manager Liu’s hand was almost touching manager Bai’s boobs, and manager Bai was completely stuck on manager Liu’s body. The two of them were walking on the street so openly, and he dared to say that it was a groundless rumor.

“Could it be that the two of you are still husband and wife?” Xia ruofei looked at store manager Liu’s annoying claws with a smile.

“Does it have anything to do with you? Are you in charge of household registration at the Public Security Bureau or file records at the Civil Affairs Bureau?” Manager Bai fired off like a machine gun.”Since when is it your turn to manage my business? You pauper who can only afford food from food stalls, you’d better take care of your mother and see if she’s cheating on you!”

Xia ruofei’s face turned cold. This manager Bai had a mean look, but it was beyond his imagination. His words were too harsh.

Guan Ping couldn’t help but explode,”Bai Jingjing! Keep your mouth clean! If there’s anything, come at me! Did my brother offend you?”

“Guanping, what’s with your attitude?” Store manager Liu’s face darkened as he chided,”apologize to manager Bai immediately!”

Guan Ping’s neck stiffened. He was about to speak but was stopped by Xia ruofei.

He glanced at Bai Jingjing coldly and said,””What a dirty mouth!”

Bai Jingjing blurted out,””You’re filthy ...”

“Pa!”

Before she could finish her sentence, she was interrupted by a crisp slap.

Bai Jingjing covered her face and was stunned. After a while, she screamed,””You bastard, you dare to hit me?”

“I’ll hit you again if you say one more dirty word. ” Xia ruofei said indifferently,”you can try if you don’t believe me!”

“You ...” Bai Jingjing swallowed back her next curse. She turned to look at store manager Liu and said,”he hit me, and you’re just going to watch?” Are you still a man?”

Store manager Liu was also a tall and strong man. He just didn’t expect Xia ruofei to suddenly hit him, so he didn’t react in time.

After hearing Bai Jingjing’s words, he suddenly felt a rush of hot blood. In addition, Xia ruofei’s white and clean skin after cultivation made him look like a weakling, which made him even more confident.

Store manager Liu let go of Bai Jingjing’s waist and walked over.””Little bastard! He even hit a woman! If I don’t teach you a lesson today, my surname isn’t Liu!”

Xia ruofei looked at store manager Liu’s unsteady steps and knew that he had never trained before. At most, he only had a bit of brute force.

Store manager Liu rushed over aggressively, but Xia ruofei was still calm and composed. It was not until store manager Liu’s fist was almost in front of him that Xia ruofei easily shifted his feet and dodged the reckless punch. Then, he stretched out his leg and tripped him lightly.

Store manager Liu had used a lot of strength and his center of gravity was already unstable after hitting nothing. With Xia ruofei’s slight stumble, he lost control of his body and fell on the ground.

During the whole process, store manager Liu didn’t even touch the corner of Xia ruofei’s clothes, and Xia ruofei didn’t use any strength at all. He easily fell to the ground. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Before manager Liu could stand up, Xia ruofei walked over and lifted him up easily by the collar.

Xia ruofei threw store manager Liu in front of Bai Jingjing and said indifferently,””Now, can you apologize to my brother?”

Bai Jingjing was dumbfounded. Store manager Liu was more than 170 pounds! The young man in front of him actually picked him up with one hand, and it was as if he was carrying a small bundle of straw, completely effortless. How terrifying was this strength?

Store manager Liu was in a daze from the fall and did not come to his senses for a long time.

Guan Ping looked at this adulterous couple in disgust and shook his head,”Ruofei, forget it. There’s no point in arguing with this kind of person!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Up to you. Let’s go!”

Not far away, they could already see the Knight XV SUV driving over.

“En!” Guan Ping looked deeply at manager Liu and manager Bai, then said,”ruofei, I think ... I’ve made a decision on that matter!”
