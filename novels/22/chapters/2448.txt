2449 The arrival of two daggers (2)

Translator: 5496903Xia ruofei didn’t have to wait for long. After about 10 minutes, he saw the peach source slowly descending.

Although the Gulfstream business jet was much size than a single – Channel narrow passenger plane like a Boeing 737 or an Airbus A320, the visibility in the airport was very high today. Furthermore, Xia ruofei’s vision was far better than ordinary people. So, when others could only see a small black dot slowly descending from the distance, he could already distinguish the LOGO of paradise Corporation on the tail of the plane.

Paradise landed steadily on the runway. Because it was a remote plane, it took more than 20 minutes to reach the tarmac. Under the command of the ground crew, it accurately landed on the plane.

Although Xia ruofei had been waiting for more than half an hour, he was not impatient at all. On the contrary, he and Ling Qingxue had not seen each other for a long time. He was about to see his girlfriend, so he couldn’t help but feel a little excited.

After Paradise’s engine died down, the tarmac became much quieter. Soon, the door of the peach origin opened and the accommodation ladder was lowered. A flight attendant stepped down from the plane and stood beside the cabin door.

When she saw Xia ruofei waiting on the tarmac, she immediately bowed slightly and said,””Good day, Mr. Fang!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded at her. Then, he turned to look at the cabin door.

Ling Qingxue finally appeared at the cabin door. Xia ruofei quickly walked up to her and said with a smile,””Qingxue, you’ve had a long journey!”

Xia ruofei stood under the plane and reached out to Ling Qingxue, wanting to take her luggage.

Unexpectedly, Ling Qingxue did not get off the plane immediately. She only smiled at Xia ruofei and moved away.

Then, another beautiful figure appeared at the cabin door.

Xia ruofei could not help but be stunned. He subconsciously took a quick glance at Ling Qingxue, then laughed dryly.”Wei Wei? You’re in the capital too?”

This time, it was Song Wei who appeared at the door.

Xia ruofei did not know that Song Wei had come to the capital with Ling Qingxue. Moreover, Ling Qingxue and Song Wei did not reveal anything, which made Xia ruofei a little surprised.

Especially with the relationship between the three of them, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel awkward.

Song Wei smiled at Xia ruofei and asked,””Am I not welcome?”

“How could it be!” Xia ruofei quickly said,”let’s get off the plane first! Let’s talk while we walk!”

Song Wei nodded and walked down the ramp with her luggage. Xia ruofei quickly took Song Wei’s luggage and Ling Qingxue’s luggage.

When facing Ling Qingxue and Song Wei at the same time, Xia ruofei had to be careful, afraid that he would favor one over the other.

Ling Qingxue saw Xia ruofei’s nervous look and a smile flashed across her eyes. However, she did not show it on her face and just quietly followed Song Wei as they got off the plane.

Captain Liu An also got off the plane. The other Captain, Zheng Daming, probably stayed in the cockpit to do some inspection work after landing and did not come down.

Xia ruofei said to Liu An,”Captain Liu, you’ve worked hard!” The crew will rest in Beijing for the next few days! I’ll contact you in advance if there’s anything. ”

“Yes, Mr. Xia!” Liu An said,”take care! I still have some work to do, so I won’t be able to see you out. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. He waved at Liu An and the flight crew. Then, he pushed the two suitcases and led Ling Qingxue and Song Wei to the exit.

From afar, Wu Qiang saw the three of them walking out of the private jet building. He quickly got off the car and walked up to them, taking the luggage from Xia ruofei’s hands.

The two most comfortable seats in the middle row were naturally reserved for Ling Qingxue and Song Wei. Xia ruofei took the initiative to sit in the front passenger seat.

After Wu Qiang placed his luggage in the trunk, he quickly walked to the front and sat in the car.

“Let’s go back to siheyuan!”Xia ruofei said to Wu Qiang.

“Yes! Boss!” “Yes!” Wu Qiang replied calmly and started the car slowly.

Xia ruofei sat on his side and turned to the back. He smiled and asked,””Weiwei, how’s uncle song’s health?”

“It’s recovering well!”Song Wei said. The medicine you left behind is very effective. He can now walk!”

Xia ruofei said happily,”that’s great!” I was still wondering if I should find some time to go back and show him! It seems like there’s no need for that ...”

“It’s just that my dad can’t stay idle. He started working as soon as he recovered a little!”Song Wei said with a frown. Even though he hasn’t gone to work yet, he has to read a lot of documents every day, and there’s an endless stream of people reporting to him ... He’s treating his home as his office!”

Xia ruofei laughed.”Uncle song’s position is more important. There are many things that need his approval. You have to understand!”

“It doesn’t matter if I understand him or not. He doesn’t listen to me anyway ...” Song Wei said,”well ... I asked him a few more questions, but he found me annoying. He said that he’s fine now and told me not to stay at home and slack off. He told me to come back to school as soon as possible ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. He knew that Song Wei was just complaining.

As song Qiming’s daughter, Song Wei had been influenced by him since she was young. How could she not know the severity of the situation? In fact, many people were envious of song Qiming’s current state! Even elder song was worried that song Qiming’s recovery period would take too long. If that happened, he would have to appoint someone new to his current position. After song Qiming recovered, he might only be able to arrange a position of the same level, but the importance of this position would definitely be far less than that of the Deputy Secretary of the southeast province and the Secretary of Sanshan city.

Song Qiming’s position had not been replaced, and there were so many people reporting to him every day. This was the most ideal result.

Xia ruofei also knew that song Qiming’s brain injury was still recovering. After drinking the soup, the injury in his sea of consciousness had probably recovered as well. His other external injuries were not serious. With his current state, he should be able to handle work every day without any problems.

Xia ruofei was worried that Ling Qingxue would feel that he had been left out. So, after talking to Song Wei for a while, he immediately changed the topic to Ling Qingxue and asked about the recent situation of Ling Ji restaurant.

This time, Ling Qingxue did not treat Xia ruofei badly because of Song Wei, as Xia ruofei had worried. Although Ling Qingxue didn’t smile much, at least she didn’t look cold.

After a few words, Xia ruofei said,””Qingxue, there might be a lot of guests at the opening ceremony tomorrow. There might be a lot of pressure on Ling Ji’s private kitchen. You have to make arrangements in advance!”

The service staff was all provided by the Paradise Club. As for the management, Ling Ji F & B had sent a manager over. In addition, the entire kitchen was also in charge of Ling Ji F & B. The manager and chef had arrived in Beijing a few days ago and settled in the Paradise Club.

They had come early to familiarize themselves with the environment and the team. After all, they would be working together in the future. If they didn’t manage to establish a good relationship, it would cause all kinds of trouble.

Ling Qingxue nodded and said,”don’t worry!” Ling Ji’s private kitchen definitely wouldn’t drop the ball! We’ve already made sufficient preparations. In addition, senior brother has already started to process the ingredients since the day before yesterday. Tomorrow, our signature ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ will definitely be a hit!”

This ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ was a secret recipe provided by Xia ruofei. Later on, it had become the signature dish of the three mountains Ling Ji private kitchen. If customers wanted to eat it, they had to make an order many days in advance.

Many of the ingredients for the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup had to be prepared in advance. Some of them even had to be slowly cooked for more than ten hours. Therefore, Ling Qingxue had already made arrangements for them in advance.

Along the way, Xia ruofei kept his side facing Ling Qingxue and Song Wei as he talked to them. Although there was still a little bit of awkwardness between the three of them, Xia ruofei could still feel that Ling Qingxue and Song Wei’s subconscious rejection seemed to have decreased a lot.

Xia ruofei was overjoyed, this was a good start!Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m
