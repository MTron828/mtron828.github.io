2451 The opportunity for a breakthrough Part Translator: 5496903If he hadn’t taken the risk, their relationship wouldn’t have made any substantial progress.

Of course, Xia ruofei might never find out the true secret of the Scripture.

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Song Wei glared at him and said, “I’m not as thick – skinned as you!”

Xia ruofei leaned back on the sofa comfortably and said seriously,””Wei Wei, since it’s like this now, why should we think so much? I see that Qingxue is slowly accepting it. I know that this is unfair to both of you, but that was indeed an accident, wasn’t it? I can’t give you too many promises, but I can promise that I’ll treat you well in the future and won’t let any of you feel neglected. ”

This was the first time Xia ruofei had told Song Wei about the relationship between the three of them. Song Wei was slightly moved after hearing it. She nodded and said,”Mm ... Qingxue and I both know about it ... Oh right, Qingxue was the one who took the initiative to ask me to come to the capital with her! It just so happens that my parents are also afraid that I’ll delay my studies and have been urging me to come back as soon as possible, so I went back to the capital with them. ”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Then, we won’t leak any information at all. This is Qingxue’s idea, right?”

“It’s our idea!”Song Wei laughed.

“Alright! “You’ve already started to play tricks on me ...” Xia ruofei deliberately made a fierce expression and said,”how do you think I should punish you?”

“You can punish me however you want!” Song Wei laughed. Who asked our cultivation to be inferior to yours! We can’t resist you!”

After she finished speaking, Song Wei made a pitiful face. Xia ruofei could not help but feel warm inside. He stood up from the sofa, held Song Wei’s slender waist, and lowered his head to kiss her.

Song Wei raised her head in panic. Just as she was about to speak, her mouth was blocked.

Song Wei felt Xia ruofei’s hands were getting more and more naughty. She twisted her body gently and said,””Ruofei...Cultivate ... Cultivate first ...”

Although Xia ruofei and Song Wei were already very close during the spirit body joint cultivation, they had never had any physical contact outside of cultivation. Song Wei still had some psychological barriers about this. Of course, it was not that she was unwilling, but she was concerned about Ling Qingxue’s feelings.

Xia ruofei sighed and his eyes became clear again. He smiled and said,”Good! Let’s cultivate first!”

Song Wei was slightly apologetic as she carefully asked,””Ruofei, you won’t be angry, will you?” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Xia ruofei laughed,”silly girl!” Why would I be angry with you? Don’t let your thoughts run wild! We haven’t been spending much time together recently, so we should hurry up and cultivate when we have the chance. You guys should also seize the opportunity to improve your cultivation!”

Ever since he knew about the situation in the world of cultivation, Xia ruofei had always felt a sense of crisis. Not only did he feel more pressured in his own cultivation, but he also hoped to improve the cultivation of the people around him.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue were only at refined Qi Level 3. Even though the world of cultivation on earth had declined, their cultivation was still not enough. Even if they were not at the bottom, they were not far from it.

Xia ruofei hoped that Song Wei and Ling Qingxue could at least protect themselves as he could not be by their side all the time.

After Xia ruofei finished speaking, he returned to his bedroom and took out the array flags from the medium. Then, he returned to the living room and set up the array flags skillfully.

Then, he went over to lock the doors and windows, draw the curtains, and set up a few alarm arrays.

“Wei Wei! Let’s go in! Cultivation needs to seize every second!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Song Wei looked at Xia ruofei and felt that he was not angry. She let out a sigh of relief and nodded. She held Xia ruofei’s hand and walked into the time formation.

When Xia ruofei, Ling Qingxue, and Song Wei cultivated together, they would usually set up a time array. On one hand, it was to save time. They usually only spent one or two hours together, which was definitely not enough for cultivation. However, if they used time array flags to create a time difference of 90 times, they would have more time.

On the other hand, this was so that once he discovered something, he could react faster. Under the effect of the time array flag, the flow of time inside and outside the array was 90 times slower. When looking at the outside world from the range of the array flag, it was equivalent to 90 times slow motion. If someone really broke into the house, Xia ruofei and Song Wei could exit their cultivation state and respond.

The two of them sat down cross – legged within the range of the array. Then, they reached out their hands in tacit understanding, and their palms touched. At the same time, they circulated the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” cultivation technique.

They had been cultivating together for a long time, and they were already very familiar with this process. Therefore, after each of them circulated their soul energy for a few cycles, their soul frequencies were adjusted to a state where they were basically synchronized.

“Weiwei, concentrate. Let’s start our cultivation!” Xia ruofei said in a deep voice.

Song Wei nodded her head calmly.

Next, when the two of them circulated their cultivation techniques, their true Qi no longer circulated in their bodies. Instead, through a relay method, their true Qi formed a “big circulation” in their meridians, and their mental energy gradually blended together.

After a few cycles, Xia ruofei felt that their soul frequencies were basically in sync. Hence, he began the next step of the ethereal joint cultivation.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual energy entered Song Wei’s consciousness through her meridians. A simulated spiritual body was formed on the island in the center of her consciousness. They started to cultivate together.

The scene seemed to be erotic, but in fact, both of their spiritual bodies were solemn. In the extreme trembling of the blending of souls, the speed and efficiency of their cultivation suddenly increased by several times.

The true Qi in their meridians was circulating faster and faster, and the origin crystals in their palms were also being consumed quickly.

Cultivation knew no time. Xia ruofei and Song Wei felt that it was just a short moment, but in fact, they had been in the state of combined cultivation for a few hours.

If Xia ruofei had not felt a slight tremor at the bottleneck of his cultivation, the joint cultivation of their spirit bodies would have continued.

Xia ruofei’s face revealed a trace of surprise. He did not expect that the bottleneck of his cultivation had not moved at all. This time, after he combined cultivation with Song Wei’s spirit body, he was finally touched.

The cultivation efficiency of the “great way of Dao” was definitely higher than that of the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra”. Moreover, the gap between Xia ruofei’s cultivation and Song Wei’s and Ling Qingxue’s was relatively large. When they were cultivating the spirit and body together, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue would definitely benefit more. Xia ruofei’s own cultivation would improve relatively slower. There was no other way.

But sometimes, even if one’s cultivation efficiency was high, one might not be able to break through. Even if the efficiency of cultivation was low, it did not mean that there would be no effect.

Perhaps Xia ruofei had been cultivating the great Dao Arts all this time and had accumulated a certain level of quantitative change. This time, he was finally going to cause a qualitative change. Perhaps it was because trying different cultivation methods would make it easier to reach a bottleneck.

In short, this was the first time Xia ruofei truly felt the opportunity to break through.

He was only distracted for a moment, and he quickly regained his focus. However, he didn’t continue to cultivate, because he felt that it would be more difficult to break through the bottleneck between refined Qi level 8 and 9 with the help of the “absolute beginning Scripture”.

Hence, Xia ruofei decided to stop cultivating.

He and Song Wei tacitly withdrew from the state of the spirit body joint cultivation. Then, they circulated the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” for two more cycles and completely left the state of cultivation.

Song Wei’s face was still flushed red as she asked,””Ruofei, is there a problem?”

Although Song Wei did not have as much cultivation experience as Xia ruofei, she could still sense the change in Xia ruofei’s emotions when they were in the state of the spirit body combined cultivation.

Xia ruofei said apologetically,””Wei Wei, I feel like I’m about to break through ...”
