3255 Getting the spaceship (2)

The extra – large container with the spaceship and the expansion cabin was lifted and placed on one of the trucks. The other truck was a cargo truck. Xia ruofei and the others personally loaded the hundreds of containers onto the truck in a short while.

Li Yifu personally got into the first truck while Xia ruofei and the others got into their respective vans. Soon, the four cars left the seemingly dilapidated factory in a single file. They did not have much interaction with Mr. John and the black man throughout the entire journey.

The fleet of four cars did not leave Houston. Instead, they drove to the southern suburbs, where Li Yifu had prepared a large warehouse in advance.

The car drove straight into the warehouse and quickly unloaded the large container. As for the other containers, Xia ruofei and the others were still doing it themselves. In order to reduce the number of irrelevant people, no unloading workers were arranged here. Even the drivers of the few cars had no idea what they were transporting this time.

After Li Yifu sent all the cars away, he quickly returned to the warehouse and locked the door.

Xia ruofei and the rest had already pried open the lead seal of the extra – large container and opened the container door.

The Dragon Ship revealed its true appearance. It was roughly split into two parts, an orbital module and a return module. However, in the orbital module, there were a few more extended modules.

The exterior of the spacecraft and the expansion cabin were not sprayed with any marks. In fact, the interior of the spacecraft was the same. All signs related to SpaceX had been removed.

At the entrance of the container, there was a small and exquisite box.

Xia ruofei took the box and opened it. There was a thick stack of paper documents inside. Similarly, they did not have any logos and were all printed on ordinary paper.

These documents included the simple operation manual of the spacecraft, a quick fault check list, and so on. In addition, there were also the key points of the EVA spacesuits, Functions Introduction of various parts, and a quick replacement of the oxygen supply module.

Xia ruofei flipped through a few pages and put them back in the box.

Everyone gathered around the container’s door and looked at the spaceship that looked a little strange because it was connected to a few expansion cabins.

Chen Xuan couldn’t help but chuckle,”this big guy is even more powerful than a flying boat in space?” I think the material is just ordinary!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”this is the power of technology!” The material of the spacecraft had been tested countless times. Not only could it withstand a huge temperature difference, but it could also shield cosmic rays. The return cabin was also equipped with a special heat – resistant material that could withstand thousands of degrees of heat. This was because the violent friction with the atmosphere during the return process would produce a huge amount of heat. In addition, the overall sealing of the spacecraft was also highly demanding. To put it bluntly, it’s a difference in the environment of use. It was designed to operate in space for a long time. ”

“Yeah!” Chen Xuan nodded. The technology of the secular world can’t be underestimated!”

Xia ruofei laughed.”Especially in the field of aerospace. You can say that it has integrated the best parts of human technology.”

At this moment, Li Yifu walked over after locking the door and said respectfully,””Grand uncle – Master, the driver has been sent away. I just checked the surveillance cameras, and there are no suspicious people nearby. We can put away these things.”

Xia ruofei nodded and released his spiritual power to scan the area. Then, he smiled and said,””Alright, then let’s get to work! After that, we should return to our country. I guess sect leader Chen and the others are all waiting anxiously!”

Chen Xuan looked at the huge spaceship in the container and said,””It seems that we can only rely on brother Xia for this big guy. The space of our storage magic weapons is limited, and our spiritual power is not enough to collect such a big thing!”

There were only two Aurous core stage cultivators, Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan. If even Chen Xuan found it difficult, they could only rely on Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei smiled.”My storage spiritual treasure can hold it. I’ll take this spaceship.”

With that, Xia ruofei looked at the Flying Ship in the container and covered it with his mental power. Then, with a slight thought, he kept the Flying Ship into the mountain and sea realm in the spirit map space.

The size and weight of this spaceship were much larger than the small yacht that he had put in his spatial space. Even though Xia ruofei’s spiritual power was much higher than before, he still felt a long – Lost sense of dizziness the moment he stored the spaceship. However, the dizziness was very light and lasted only for a moment before he returned to normal.

Xia ruofei also kept the small box filled with the operation manual into the spirit map space.

The container was now empty.

Chen Xuan raised his thumb and smiled.””Amazing!”

Xia ruofei laughed and pointed at the remaining boxes.””Let’s share some of these things!”

All that was left were five extra – Space suits and 500 oxygen supply modules. The items were not big, and everyone’s storage space could fit them all.

Xia ruofei, Ling Qingxue, and Yu xiner each collected an extra – terrestrial spacesuit and 100 oxygen supply modules.

As for the remaining two spacesuits and 200 oxygen supply modules, they were all kept by Chen Xuan.

The warehouse, which had been a little crowded just now, was suddenly emptied again.

Xia ruofei said to Li Yifu,”Yifu, I’ll leave the finishing touches here to you. Also, you have to continue to follow up on Elon Musk’s side. You also have to urge him to deliver the remaining spacesuits and oxygen supply module on time.”

“Don’t worry! Senior granduncle!” Li Yifu said,”I’ll stay in Houston for the time being until I’ve finished delivering everything.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I won’t be coming for the next delivery. You’ll be fully responsible.” Just let me know when you receive it. We’ll go back to China first. You’ll be in charge of the affairs in the United States for this period of time. Don’t worry about other things, I’ll arrange everything. ”

Xia ruofei was naturally referring to the incident on Peach Blossom Island. However, since Chen Xuan and the rest were present, he was vague about it. However, Li Yifu could definitely understand it. He said respectfully,””Yes! Senior granduncle! Disciple will remember. If anything happens here, this disciple will report it to martial granduncle at any time. ”

“Mm! Then I’ll have to trouble you!” Xia ruofei nodded and turned to Chen Xuan and the rest.”Let’s go back then!”

The group arrived at the back of the warehouse. This area was rather remote and almost unpopulated. Xia ruofei took out the black – armored flying ship from the spirit map space. After everyone jumped onto the Flying Ship, he stood at the side of the ship and waved at Li Yifu. Then, he steered the Flying Ship in the direction of Huaxia.

The black Phoenix flying ship was much faster than an ordinary commercial plane. Even though it was not flying at full speed, the entire journey would only take two to three hours.

In these two to three hours, Xia ruofei and the others were not idle. They were all reading the thick operation manual.

After all, if cultivators were in space, their survival ability would not be much better than ordinary people. Especially for Qi refining cultivators like Ling Qingxue and Yu Xin ‘er, if they were exposed to space, they would not be able to last more than a few minutes than ordinary people. Therefore, they still had to learn the operating procedures of the spacecraft and the process of putting on and taking off spacesuits.

Once in space, the outside of the spacecraft was a vacuum environment. There were strict procedures for entering and exiting the cabin. Which door to open first, which door to open again, the operation of pressure release, pressure release, etc. In addition, if the spacecraft had a leak, there was also an emergency evacuation process. Everyone had to remember it in their hearts. Otherwise, if they accidentally lost their lives, they would have no place to redress their grievances.

Under normal circumstances, an ordinary person would need to go through a long period of training and participate in various assessments in order to become a qualified astronaut. The time span was calculated by years. Fortunately, they did not need to master a comprehensive knowledge like real astronauts. Moreover, they were all cultivators, so their learning speed and memory were much better than ordinary people. Therefore, it would not take too much energy to master some operating procedures and emergency plans.

As he studied, time passed by quietly. Before he knew it, the black Phoenix flying ship had already arrived in the sky above the capital of Huaxia.
