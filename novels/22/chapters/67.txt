Chapter 68: Cutting again (1)

“RUO Fei! My dad has fired he Dong!” The moment the call connected, Ling Qingxue said excitedly,”I won’t have to see that annoying face again! Hehe ...” Xia ruofei laughed and said,” “Oh, really? Uncle Ling made a decision so quickly? I thought he would hesitate for a few days!” After the brief interaction yesterday, Xia ruofei could tell that Ling Xiaotian was a very loyal person. He Dong was the son of the old class monitor who had saved his life. It would be very difficult for Ling Xiaotian to expel he Dong. Ling Qingxue said,” “How can I not hesitate? My dad probably didn’t sleep last night. His eyes were bloodshot when he woke up in the morning. “He was also restless this morning. He went into the study room to give uncle he a call, and when he came out, he made the decision to fire he Dong ...” “So it’s like this! It seems that the old squad leader didn’t lose his soldier’s character!” Xia ruofei nodded and said. Ling Qingxue hesitated for a moment before saying,” “But ... Ruofei, my dad is calling some of his close friends! He probably wants to arrange a job for he Dong ... You ... Won’t be angry, right?” Xia ruofei laughed and said,” “Why should I be angry? I only asked Ling’s F & B to fire he Dong. As for uncle Ling finding a job for he Dong, that’s his own decision. Why should I be angry? To be honest, if he didn’t do this, he wouldn’t be called Ling Xiaotian!” Ling Qingxue stuck out her tongue and asked,” “You’re making it sound like you know my dad very well ...” Xia ruofei laughed. “There are some people who don’t need to be in contact too much. Sometimes, you can tell what kind of person they are with just a few words.” “Yo! He even appreciated my dad’s talent!” Ling Qingxue chuckled. “That’s right!” Xia ruofei said casually, then continued,”Speaking of which, the main reason I asked to fire he Dong was because you were so annoyed by his pestering. So, I might as well use this opportunity to drive this fly away! As for which company he goes to work at, what does it have to do with me?” To be honest, Xia ruofei didn’t care about he Dong at all. To Xia ruofei, he Dong was no different from a fly. When Ling Qingxue heard this, she immediately said happily,” “So you care about me that much!” “Uh ...” Xia ruofei patted his forehead and quickly changed the topic.”Well ... Qingxue, let’s talk about the cooperation!” Ling Qingxue pouted and snorted. She was unhappy with Xia ruofei’s behavior of retreating after a single touch. However, she still said unwillingly,” “Your request has been met. My dad said that he will personally go over to you in the afternoon to sign the contract. Are you satisfied?” Xia ruofei chuckled.” “Tell him not to come yet! My own company will be registered soon, and I’ll sign it directly under the company’s name. Otherwise, I’ll have to change the contract again. Isn’t it better to get everything done in one go?” “But our company is in urgent need of your Taoyuan vegetables!” Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”I can’t even wait a day!” Xia ruofei laughed. “We won’t delay the supply of vegetables. Tell uncle Ling that you can send someone to bring the vegetables tomorrow! We’ll follow the quantity and price we agreed on last time!” “This is more like it!” Ling Qingxue chuckled.”Then I’ll bring a car over to transport the vegetables tomorrow morning!” “Ah? You’re coming too?” Xia ruofei asked subconsciously. “Hmph! Why? I don’t welcome you?” Ling Qingxue snorted and asked. “That’s not it ...” Xia ruofei said hurriedly.”But you’re a big manager and you’re so busy. You don’t have to do such a small thing like pulling the vegetables, do you?” “I’m coming!” Ling Qingxue said,”you still owe me a meal! Prepare well tomorrow! I’ll have lunch at your place!” Xia ruofei groaned in his heart. It seemed that this girl was prepared to stay here the whole morning tomorrow! He had so many things to do every day, where would he find the time to accompany her? However, since Ling Qingxue had asked for it and he did owe her a meal, Xia ruofei could not reject her and could only agree with a bitter smile. After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei called President Zheng of the West River Moon Club and informed him about the cooperation between him and Ling Ji. This was what the two of them had agreed on back then. Moreover, the target customers of Ling Ji restaurant and the West River Moon Club were completely different. Moreover, the supply volume was not high, so there was no need to worry about the loss of high – end customers. People with money and status ate in a different way. Even if the ingredients were also Taoyuan vegetables, the club members generally wouldn’t lower their status and spend in such a public restaurant. Therefore, President Zheng was not unhappy. Instead, he teased Xia ruofei over the phone and said that he would arrange a one – stop service for Xia ruofei the next time he went to Xi jiangyue. President Zheng was in a good mood after hearing the popularity that Taoyuan vegetables had brought to the West River Moon Club. …… Xia ruofei made lunch for himself. When he was done with the dishes and was about to go to the backyard to look at the cabbage seedlings, he received a call from the courier. It turned out that the small flower pots, succulent plants, and other things he had ordered had arrived. Xia ruofei was a little surprised. He had thought that he would only receive it tomorrow. Since he had received it today, it would be for the best. After all, Ling Qingxue was coming tomorrow morning, and she probably wouldn’t be able to do much. Hence, Xia ruofei drove non – stop to the express delivery point in Changping County to pick up the goods. The huge box almost filled the entire car. After driving back to the villa, Xia ruofei made sure that there was no one around and put the big box into the spirit map space. Then, he quickly went upstairs to lock the door and windows, took out the spirit map scroll, and entered the space with a thought. In the boundless space, Xia ruofei opened the box and took out a few hundred plastic flower pots and a few large fiber bags filled with succulent plants. Different species of succulent plants had different requirements for their materials. Xia ruofei bought a large bag of each type of succulent plant that he currently had. Then, Xia ruofei began the second cutting process on the succulents. With the experience from the first time, Xia ruofei was even more familiar with the route this time. It was still the buck & Strider 888& military dagger. The only difference was that Xia ruofei was terminally ill the last time. Now, not only had he recovered, but he was also much stronger than when he was at his peak. Naturally, his work efficiency had also increased. More than five hours later, more than a dozen pots of succulent mother plants were scarred and looked miserable, while more than 180 pots of small succulents were next to them. Xia ruofei took out the flower petal solution that he had concocted and sprinkled some on each wound on the mother plant. Then, he diluted the flower petal solution again and mixed it with the spirit pond water in the watering can. He watered every pot of succulents. Xia ruofei dusted his hands in satisfaction. He picked up the bottle of spiritual pond water and gulped down a few mouthfuls of water. Suddenly, he felt refreshed and all his fatigue disappeared. Next, he just had to wait a few days and these little succulents would be put on the shelves for sale. That would be another income of more than 100000 Yuan!
