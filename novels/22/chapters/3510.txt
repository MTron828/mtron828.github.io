The meeting room gradually quieted down. Everyone looked at Xia ruofei with worry. Those present were all part of paradise corporation’s management, so they more or less knew some inside information. They knew that the company’s “core technology” was in Xia ruofei’s hands. If Xia ruofei were to withdraw and no longer care about the company’s Affairs, then even though paradise Corporation was thriving with endless potential, it would decline in the blink of an eye.

However, Xia ruofei’s next words quickly dispelled everyone’s concerns.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Everyone, don’t worry about the company’s development. Although I’m no longer involved in the company’s management and operation, I’ll still provide the support that the company needs unconditionally. Also, I’ll keep my position as the chairman, but I won’t be involved in the company’s Affairs. Also, since everyone is here today, I’ll announce another appointment!” Xia ruofei then pointed at Zheng Yongshou and said,””This is Zheng Yongshou, Mr. Zheng. From today onwards, he will be the Director of the Board of Directors. Of course, Mr. Zheng will not participate in the company’s management Affairs as the Director of the Board of Directors. He is only responsible for coordinating and contacting people. In the future, he will be fully responsible for the business that requires my technical support. This appointment will not involve the work of the lower – Level employees, so it will not be announced publicly, nor will it be issued by email. Everyone here can just keep it in mind.”

They were all elites who had been in the workplace for many years. They understood immediately that Xia ruofei was trying to reduce his influence in the company and leave the company.

At first, everyone thought that Xia ruofei had only withdrawn from the company on the surface. In reality, he had arranged for his trusted aides to enter the company and hid himself to be the Emperor who controlled everything remotely.

The situation was obviously different from what everyone had imagined. Xia ruofei’s position as the chairman had become an honorary position, so Zheng Yongshou, the Director of the Board of Directors, naturally had no real power. Moreover, Xia ruofei had clearly stated that Zheng Yongshou’s only job as the Director of the Board of Directors was to communicate with others. To put it bluntly, it was a link between Xia ruofei and the company. He would not be involved in any other Affairs, so naturally, there was no possibility of separation of power.

Zheng Yongshou stood up and slightly bowed to everyone, saying,””Please take care of me in the future.”

He sat down after he finished speaking, giving off a silent feeling.

Xia ruofei said,”I won’t say anything unnecessary. Everyone, just do as usual and don’t affect your work. Your respective areas and reporting relationships will remain the same.” Of course, how we’re going to make the next adjustments will be up to you, CEO Feng. I don’t want to know at all, haha!”

The higher – ups in the meeting room couldn’t help but look at Feng Jing with respect.

In the past, Feng Jing was Xia ruofei’s absolute confidant and had a lot of say in paradise Corporation. Now that Xia ruofei had completely given up his power, Feng Jing could be said to be the true helmsman of the company. It was no exaggeration to say that Feng Jing could even decide the fate of the Vice President of the administrative department, Dong Yun, with a single word.

Of course, everyone knew that this situation would not last long. Feng Jing wasn’t Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei had absolute control over the company, so this wouldn’t be a problem. However, Feng Jing wouldn’t allow this to happen to avoid suspicion. If everything went well, she would soon form a team with the Board of Directors as the core.

But no matter what, from today onwards, Feng Jing’s position in paradise Corporation had clearly risen by a large margin.

After Xia ruofei finished, he said in a carefree manner,””Alright, if there’s nothing else, let’s end the meeting! Leave Kanayama behind.”

The company’s senior officials stood up and left the meeting room, leaving Feng Jing, Zheng Yongshou, and Xue Jinshan behind.

Xue Jinshan’s face revealed a trace of reluctance. He walked forward and said,”President… You …”

Xue Jinshan had been personally recruited by Xia ruofei. As soon as he entered the company, he had been busy with the establishment of Tao Yuan pharmaceutical factory and the development of autism drugs. Later, due to his outstanding performance, Xia ruofei had appointed him as the factory director. Now, the pharmaceutical factory had a lot of power in Tao Yuan company and he had become an important senior management of the company. All of this was given to him by Xia ruofei.

It could be said that in his heart, he was different from the other high – ranking officials. Other than Feng Jing, he felt that he was Xia ruofei’s closest relative. Hence, Xia ruofei’s decision today had a huge impact on him.

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.”Jinshan, there’s no need to say so much. Do a good job in the pharmaceutical factory. Chief Feng also has high hopes for you. Even if I’m not in the company in the future, you can’t drop the ball, understand?”

“Don’t worry about that! Chairman, the company has given me everything I have today. I will do my best to repay the company!” Xue Jinshan quickly expressed his determination. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” I believe in your ability, but you still have to continue to be more proactive in the future. The matter of the raw materials this time should have given you an alarm. I remember that I emphasized the importance of raw material channels in the past, but you never really paid attention to it. When the production line of the sub – Plant started to work, the problem of raw materials immediately became prominent! Although I can provide you with most of the raw materials you need at the moment, you must still pay attention to this work in the future. I can tell you that I won’t be providing you with more raw materials in the future.. If we expand our production in the future, you’ll have to solve the problem of raw materials by yourself!”
