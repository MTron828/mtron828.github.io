Chapter 675: The perfect solution_1

It was about 10 O’ clock at night, which was still early for many young people. Some had just woken up and started to go out for the night. However, for the director of the pharmaceutical and cosmetic Registration Division, Chen Manan, who was in his 50s, it was already his break time.

Chen Ming ‘an would go to bed at 9:30 p.m. Every day.

However, just as he began to feel drowsy, his phone in the distance began to vibrate. He had always placed his phone far away when he was sleeping. It was said that this could reduce the radiation damage.

Chen Ming ‘an’s sleepiness disappeared in an instant. He sat up angrily and mumbled,””Who is it! To call so late at night ...”

It shouldn’t be anyone from the Department. Those subordinates knew his habits. They would never dare to disturb him after 9:30, unless something major happened.

Chen Ming ‘an’s wife was removing her accessories in front of the dressing table. Chen Ming’ an’s phone was on the table not far from her.

His wife turned around and looked at Chen Ming ‘an, who had already sat up. She said,””Old Chen, why are you in a daze? Pick up the phone ...”

“Help me see who’s calling first,” Chen Ming ‘an said.

“Oh ...” The wife said as she got up to pick up the phone.

At first glance, the wife’s expression changed and she cried out,””Yo! It’s director CEng!”

“What?” Chen Ming ‘an lifted his blanket and jumped off the bed. He was as agile as a seventeen or eighteen – year – old boy.

He rushed to his wife, took the phone, and quickly pressed the answer button.

Chen Ming ‘an greeted him respectfully,”Hello, director CEng!” May I ask for your instructions?”

......

Zeng Kewen’s voice was extremely cold,”comrade Chen Ming ‘an, you must immediately carry out the things I’m about to say!” First, suspend Qi Min, Lu Ping, and Guo Ziyang from the National Medicine department for inspection. Second, the Chinese traditional medicine Department was to find the new drug materials submitted by the southeast province’s Taoyuan pharmaceutical company by tonight and organize the project approval overnight. Third, after the matter is settled, no matter what time it is, personally bring the person – in – charge of the National Medicine Department to my apartment to report the situation!”

Chen Ming ‘an was dumbfounded, but fortunately, he reacted quickly. He was only stunned for a moment before he said,””Yes! Director CEng, I’ll rush back to the division immediately to supervise and ensure that your instructions will be carried out to the letter!”

Zeng Kewen snorted and hung up the phone without saying anything.

Chen Ming ‘an’s face was pale. He sat by the bed and mumbled,””Something big has happened, something big has happened ...”

His wife, who was watching from the side, was also quite frightened and quickly asked,””Old Chen, what’s going on?”

“I have to rush back to the office immediately!” Chen Ming ‘an said in a daze.

He grabbed his phone and ran out as he spoke.

“AI! You’re still wearing your pajamas!”

Only then did Chen Ming ‘an react. He hurriedly turned around and put on his clothes haphazardly. As he tidied himself up, he walked out.

In order to save time, he didn’t even call the driver to answer the call. Instead, he drove directly to the general Administration of Drug Administration.

On the way, Chen Ming ‘an gradually calmed down. He started to make phone calls to arrange his troops as he drove.

When Chen Ming ‘an arrived at the office, some of the officers who lived close to him had already arrived. Many of the offices were lit up.

The one who was in the most difficult position was the director of the National Medicine Division, Lin Huahai.

Reeking of alcohol, he rushed to the unit and started working with extreme fear and anxiety.

Soon, the Deputy Director in charge of the National medicine of Chinese medicine also rushed to the unit. All the members of the National medicine of Chinese medicine were called back, and the office area was brightly lit.

When Qi Min and the other two received Lin Huahai’s call, they were eating skewers and drinking wine at a roadside stall.

It wasn’t that they were desperate, but that they had really given up on tonight’s events. The three of them might as well huddle together and drink to drown their sorrows.

However, Qi Min and the other two really didn’t expect that this matter wouldn’t even last for a night. How long had it been? The division Chief called him directly.

Lin Huahai very sternly announced the decision to suspend the three of them over the phone. At the same time, he ordered the three of them to “get the hell back” to their units as soon as possible.

He called them back because there was something important. He wanted to know what kind of trouble these three grandsons had caused to the unit. Now, even the director was waiting to get an answer from them!

As for the application report that Xue Jinshan and the others had sent in after much effort, it had been casually thrown aside by the Qi people a few days ago. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The number of telegrams that came and went every day was astonishing, and soon, the report was drowned out by all kinds of materials.

The cadres of the National Medicine Department of Chinese medicine cursed Qi Min as they opened the boxes of documents and started to look through them.

Fortunately, there was strength in numbers, and the materials didn’t accumulate for too long, so after everyone busied themselves, they still successfully found the application materials submitted by the Paradise Corporation.

Therefore, the Department began to organize the approval of the project overnight.

It was said to be approval, but in fact, everyone from the Secretary to the ordinary clerk knew in their hearts that it was just a formality.

He had to go through the necessary procedures.

In China, procedural justice was very important.

Soon, the project establishment notice stamped with a bright red Seal and the notice of the southeast province’s Food and Drug Administration organizing the preliminary examination on his behalf were issued.
