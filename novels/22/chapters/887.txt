Translator: 549690339

The lunch was a happy one. He Feng and Cao Guangzhi both felt that the trip was worth it. After interacting with them, Xia ruofei felt that they were quite straightforward. Perhaps it was because they had not been successful in their careers, so they did not have many bad habits in politics.

Xia ruofei felt that the two of them were quite compatible with his temper, so he drank quite a lot in the afternoon.

When he Feng was almost done, he quietly got up and left the room, going straight to the cashier.

“Lotus pond moonlight private room, please.” He Feng said to the beautiful female cashier and handed over his credit card.

The female cashier smiled and said, ” “Sir, the bill for lotus pond and moonlight has already been paid.”

He Feng’s eyes widened and he said,” you bought it? ” That’s impossible! Did you get it wrong? ”

The cashier had a charming smile on her face and said, ” “There’s no mistake, Sir. Mr. Dan Xia from the moonlight lotus pond has already bought it ...”

“Mr. Xia? ” He Feng was stunned for a moment, then said, ” I see. Thank you ...”

He picked up his credit card and turned around to walk back.

Xia ruofei was chatting with Guangzhi Cao when he Feng returned to the room.

He Feng shouted as soon as he entered,” ruofei!” What you’re doing is a little unkind!”

Xia ruofei was confused, but he laughed and said, ” “Mayor he, I didn’t do anything. Every time you propose a toast to me, I always drink a glass! I’ve never cheated or cheated!”

“Uncle he,”Guangzhi Cao joked,”you didn’t fall for a waitress, did you? and RUO Fei beat you to it, did he? ”

Guangzhi Cao and he Feng had gotten closer after the lunch conversation, so they talked more casually than before.

“Director Cao, with my looks, I’m no match for RUO Fei if I really want to snatch a girl,”he Feng said with a bitter smile.

Xia ruofei and Guangzhi Cao couldn’t help but laugh. Even the two beautiful waitresses in the room couldn’t help but smile as they looked at Xia ruofei.

After laughing, Xia ruofei asked,” Mayor he, you haven’t told me what’s going on!” Why are you criticizing me so severely after coming back from a short trip? ”

He Feng glared at him and said angrily,” you still dare to say that!” Didn’t we agree that I’ll be the host today? Why did you secretly go and pay the bill? Do you think that I can’t afford to buy you a drink? ”

“I’ll pay the bill? ” Xia ruofei was also stunned.

However, he immediately understood what was going on and couldn’t help but smile bitterly. ” “This elder Zheng ...”

Then, Xia ruofei turned around and said to the waiter, ” “Can I trouble you to call your President Zheng over? ”

“Alright, please wait a moment!” One of the tall waitresses immediately walked out of the private room and informed President Zheng through the walkie-talkie.

He Feng also noticed something was wrong and asked, ” “What’s wrong? You didn’t pay for it? ”

Xia ruofei spread his hands and said,” of course not!” I’m the stingiest person, didn’t I say that you’d treat me today? ”

“Interesting, interesting ...”Guangzhi Cao laughed as well.

Soon, President Zheng from West River moon came to the room and said with a smile, ” “President Xia and the two leaders, have you had a good drink today? ”

“President Zheng, what’s with this bill? “Xia ruofei asked with a straight face.

President Zheng laughed and said,” President Xia, I was the one who told the front desk to give you a free order.” It’s rare for you to come to our club, and the two leaders are our distinguished guests. If you charge for a simple meal, aren’t you slapping my face? ”

He Feng and Cao Guangzhi looked at each other, both of them secretly shocked.

They knew very well that the West River Moon Club was not an ordinary restaurant. It was a membership-based restaurant. Although the entry requirements were not as high as those of the top clubs in the capital, not everyone could come in and spend money.

Moreover, he Feng had previously accompanied some of the higher-ups to have a meal here, but President Zheng had never personally told him to give them a free meal.

Xia ruofei’s face was really big!

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly. ” But Mayor he is the host today. I’m just here for free food. ”

“Yeah, yeah!”He Feng quickly replied. President Zheng, you’re not giving me a chance to flatter RUO Fei! This can’t be ...”

“Mayor he, I was just trying to express my sincerity!”President Zheng quickly smiled. Don’t do it again, don’t do it again ...”

Then, President Zheng changed the topic and said, ” “Besides, since President Xia is the host this time, it’ll give you a chance to invite President Xia back next time! I promise I’ll only give you a VIP discount next time, no discount! And I’ll definitely keep this lotus pond moonlight private room for you!”

President Zheng was indeed a smooth businessman. After he finished speaking, he Feng immediately smiled.

Actually, President Zheng was right. Since Xia ruofei was treating, he had a reason to treat him back.

China was a society of human relationships. Didn’t the friendship between people gradually deepen with the banquets and exchanges?

“You said it yourself!”He Feng said. If I can’t get a lotus pond moonlight private room next time, I’ll look for you directly, old Zheng!” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“No problem!” President Zheng said bluntly.

“Uncle he, don’t forget to invite me when you’re treating next time!”Guangzhi Cao said with a smile.

“Definitely!”He Feng said happily.

After the small episode of paying the bill, Xia ruofei and the others were almost done drinking. Hence, they called President Zheng over for a round of reunion wine and ended the drinking session.
