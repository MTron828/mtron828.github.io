“As for the number 0, we’ll deal with it according to the extended beat symbol for now!” Xia ruofei said,”the next question is these negative numbers. From 7 to 1, what do they represent?”

“I think ... It’s probably the tone!” Song Wei said. 1 corresponds to 1,2 corresponds to 2, and so on. However, I don’t know if the pitch of a negative number is higher or lower than a positive number, and how many degrees different they are ...”

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said,””We can try this bit by bit. After all, there are only a few possibilities.”

“I think Song Wei’s answer is closer to the correct one!” Chen Xuan said. After we return to the capital, we’ll follow this guess. First, we’ll convert the song into a simplified score, and then list out all the versions. When the time comes, we’ll be able to distinguish which one is correct after listening to it!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” We’ve already guessed the main problems. As for the remaining small problems, we’ll just have to try and make some mistakes. We should be able to find the right song very soon!”

Mu Sheng laughed and said,”we’re also looking forward to it!” This time, they finally saw a ray of hope! We’ve been researching the secret of the five Holy badges for many years, but we’ve never had any results! I didn’t expect it to go so smoothly this time!”

Although there were some twists and turns in the process of cracking the token, from Mu Sheng’s point of view, it was already quite successful to be able to progress to this extent in such a short time.

Liu Mansha also laughed and said,”the future generations are truly fearsome!” If it were us old guys, even if we had five tokens in front of us, we might not be able to crack the secret of this floating point pattern in our entire lives!”

Although they had yet to completely succeed in cracking the secret of the token, Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha could already see a huge hope. What made them feel even more embarrassed was that the people who had played a role in the whole process were mostly young people. Chen Xuan and Xia ruofei had put in the most effort, especially Xia ruofei. Even song Wei, Ling Qingxue, and the others had played a bigger role than them.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Valley master Liu, you’re too kind. We also rely on the computing power of supercomputers and a little bit of luck.”

“Hahaha! Anyway, using this super computer or whatever ... We old guys will never think of it in our lifetime. ” Mu Sheng laughed and joined in the praise,”it’s all thanks to little brother Xia this time!” If you can successfully crack the secret of the token, you will be the main contributor!”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”we don’t know if we can crack it!” I dare not accept sect leader MU’s evaluation ...”

As they discussed the score made up of numbers, they chatted. Soon, it was almost 9:30.

Hence, Xia ruofei beckoned everyone to go downstairs.

The bags in everyone’s hands were basically for show, and most of the luggage was stored in storage magic treasures.

On the other hand, Wang Chi and his teacher were dragging two large suitcases.

A coaster from the Supercomputing Center was already parked outside the guest house. Cai Songlin, along with Deputy Director Wei and the other leaders of the Supercomputing Center, also came to the building to see them off.

“Academician Wang, can’t you stay for a few more days?” Cai Songlin said,”everyone in our Center is looking forward to you guiding us in our work!”

Wang Chi chuckled and said,”the problems that need to be solved have been solved!” I have a lot of work to do at the Research Institute in Beijing, so I have to rush back as soon as possible!”

“You’ve worked hard, academician Wang! I haven’t been able to entertain you well these two days!” Cai Songlin said politely.

“Hey! I’m used to running here and there!” Wang Chi said in a carefree manner.

“You are the pillar of our country’s Computer Science field. We can’t live without you!” Cai Songlin flattered him and said,”academician Wang, I’ll be looking forward to your guidance at the Supercomputing Center!”

“No problem!” Wang Chi said,”let’s communicate more often. If you have any questions, contact me by email!”

As they were talking, Xia ruofei and the rest walked out of the guest house.

“I’m sorry, I came down late!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“I was the one who went downstairs early!” Wang Chi said with a smile.

“President Xia, I came and went in a hurry this time. Please forgive me for my poor hospitality!” Cai Songlin smiled.

“I’ve caused trouble for the Supercomputing Center!” Xia ruofei said politely,”thank you, director Cai, Deputy Director Wei, and all the leaders. When I go back, I will ask the company to send a batch of jaded skin cream over. You can distribute it as an employee benefit. It’s not worth much, but it’s just a token of my appreciation.”

“No need, no need, no need ...” Cai Songlin quickly said,”President Xia, you don’t have to be so polite! We’re all doing this for work! Also ... Academician Wang is the one who asked for it, so what’s the big deal?”

“Of course, I have to thank academician Wang!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”but the Supercomputing Center has indeed helped me a lot. I’ve always been a person who draws a clear line between gratitude and grudges, so I still have to thank you ... Director Cai, it’s almost time. We’ll take our leave now!”

“Good! Academician Wang, President Xia, I wish you all a safe journey!”

Xia ruofei, Wang Chi, and the rest got into the Super – Computing Center’s Toyota Coaster. They drove all the way to the new Wu hotel and checked out before heading straight to the airport.

At 10:20 A. M., Not long after everyone had boarded the plane, the tower’s take – off command was sent.

The runway of Xin Wu airport was not long, but it was enough for the public jet to take off and land.

After a short slide, paradise rose into the air and began to climb rapidly in a light posture.

The flight was smooth. Before 12 o’ clock, paradise had landed on the runway of Beijing airport.

It was already lunch time, so Xia ruofei brought everyone to paradise clubhouse for lunch. After all, the car that was going to pick them up was also from paradise clubhouse.

As for the flight crew, after some consideration, Xia ruofei ordered them to take a short break and return to the three mountains.

Sanshan airport was the base airport of the public jet, paradise. This plane was actually under the name of Li Yifu’s company. The company had signed a long – term agreement with Sanshan airport, which included the rental of the venue, ground service maintenance, fuel refilling, and so on.

If the plane were to stop at another airport, it would naturally cost an additional fee.

Besides, the flight crew also had a fixed residence at the three mountains. Hence, if they were not using the plane for a while, Xia ruofei felt that it was more appropriate to let them wait for orders at the three mountains.

In fact, he had less and less time to use an airplane. After all, an airboat was more convenient.

After lunch at the Taoyuan club, Xia ruofei gave Wang Chi and Feng Xiaoyi each a gift. It was actually two bottles of Drunken Eight Immortals wine, a box of Dahongpao tea leaves, and a Jade skin cream. In addition, there was a Cordyceps sinensis among the gifts for Wang Chi, which was better for the elderly. Feng Xiaoyi was young, so he naturally didn’t give it to him.

Of course, the gift was just a small token of appreciation. In fact, Wang Chi and Feng Xiaoyi didn’t know that. What was more precious was that Xia ruofei felt that he owed Wang Chi a favor and would definitely return it in the future.

This favor, at the right time, would play an immeasurable role.

After arranging for the Taoyuan club’s car to send Wang Chi and his disciple back to Beijing University, Xia ruofei also took the Taoyuan club’s business car and returned to the courtyard house in liuhai Lane with Chen Xuan, Mu Sheng, Liu Mansha, and the others.

When they reached home, Xia ruofei brought everyone to the master’s courtyard in the middle. He opened the door and said,””Let’s start studying this music score today and try to solve the secret of the token as soon as possible. ”

In comparison, Xia ruofei was more anxious than Mu Sheng and the others because he knew that the token had appeared more than three hundred years ago. According to the information provided by the master of the cloud platform, they could disappear at any time and hide. No one knew how many years it would take for them to reappear.

This was something that Chen Xuan and the others did not know.

The door opened, and everyone entered the house.

“Brother Xia, where do you plan to start?” Chen Xuan asked. Shouldn’t we study the main musical instruments of the ancient times first? You have to know that the sound produced by different instruments is very different!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”this score doesn’t look like it was written by the ancient people. Although we can’t determine the era, this score looks even more crude than a simplified score. How can it be played by an ancient instrument?” So, I’ve decided to start with something simple and crude!”

At this point, Xia ruofei’s face broke into a smile ...
