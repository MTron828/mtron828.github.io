Chapter 3496  Consecutive breakthroughs_2

  In fact, Luo Qingfeng, Liu Mansha, Chen Nanfeng, and the others were all older than Li Yifu.

  Therefore, the Golden core stage was a dividing line. If Li Yifu could break through the shackles of the Golden core stage, with Xia ruofei's help, his future cultivation path would be promising. If he could not break through after a long time, as he grew older, his body functions would gradually age, and it would be more difficult to break through later.

  Hence, Xia ruofei said this in hopes that Li Yifu could maintain his sense of urgency and break through the Golden core stage in one go.

  After all, the bottleneck from the Qi layer to the Golden core stage was still very difficult to break through. Some people were stuck at this step for decades without making any progress, and there were many such people.

  "Yes!" Li Yifu quickly replied with a serious expression. This disciple will remember senior granduncle's teachings! Disciple will not let down martial granduncle's ardent expectations and will not dare to relax for even a moment!"

  Xia ruofei nodded his head in satisfaction. Then, he turned to Song Wei and asked with a smile,""Wei Wei, you still haven't broken through to refined Qi Level 7?"

  Song Wei was in a good mood. She laughed and said,"Yup! You're just a little short ... But I'm already very satisfied! The effects of this Vermilion Jade Fruit have simply exceeded my expectations!"

  Ling Qingxue giggled and said,"this is great!" We're on the same level again! Wei Wei, let's work hard together in the future! Otherwise, I'll be left behind by this guy!"

  Xia ruofei said seriously,"Qingxue, to be precise, your spiritual power is a level higher than Weiwei 's, and in terms of cultivation, Weiwei is ahead of you!" She could break through to refined Qi Level 7 at any time, and you still need to work hard!"

  With Xia ruofei's current level of cultivation, he only needed to glance at Ling Qingxue and Song Wei, who were both in the Qi refining stage, to know the difference between their cultivation and spiritual power.

  Ling Qingxue pouted and said,"I know!" Can you not attack me? I'll go find a place to cultivate!"

  Before Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue left earth, Song Wei's cultivation and spiritual power were slightly higher than Ling Qingxue 's. However, Ling Qingxue had absorbed more Topaz essence than Song Wei in the trial Pagoda. Hence, her spiritual power was now slightly higher than Song Wei' s. In terms of cultivation level, Song Wei was still a step ahead.

  Of course, it was also obvious that both of their cultivations were at refined Qi Level 6, and their spiritual power was also in the middle stage of the spirit gathering realm.

  Ling Qingxue pouted and said,"I know!" Can you not attack me? I'll go find a place to cultivate!"

  Xia ruofei laughed and said,"it's already dark outside. It's time for dinner!" We can't rush our cultivation!"

  Ling Qingxue said,"I'll cultivate first!" To avoid being despised by a certain someone ..."

  Song Wei pursed her lips and smiled,"Qingxue, RUO Fei said that your spiritual Power's level is higher than mine!" Why would I despise you?"

  "That's only because I absorbed more yellow jade essence than you ..." Ling Qingxue pouted."This guy must be saying that I'm not working hard enough!"

  Xia ruofei laughed,"I didn't mean it that way!" I just want to tell you that you are not on the same level. If you strictly distinguish them, you still have your own strengths! Of course, the cultivation environment here is really not bad. If you put all your effort into cultivation, you should be able to break through to refined Qi Level 7 very quickly. "

  The Grand uncle - Master was flirting with his two cultivation partners. As his Grand - disciple, Li Yifu was a little embarrassed. However, since Xia ruofei did not say anything, he could not avoid them. He could only brace himself and stand aside.

  Xia ruofei also noticed Li Yifu's uneasiness. He smiled and said,""Foster husband, you should go and cultivate first! My cultivation has just increased by so much, I need to spend some time to consolidate it, otherwise, my Foundation will be unstable!"

  Li Yifu's cultivation level was higher than Song Wei 's, so the speed at which he absorbed the Vermillion Jade Fruit was naturally faster.

  In reality, in the trial Pagoda, even though Xia ruofei had broken through to the intermediate stage of the Golden elixir realm, which was much more difficult, he had woken up earlier than Ling Qingxue.

  Therefore, Li Yifu was the same. Song Wei was still immersed in her cultivation, but he had already finished absorbing the Vermillion Jade Fruit and opened his eyes.

  While absorbing the Vermilion Jade Fruit, Li Yifu's consciousness was still clear, so he was very clear that his cultivation had undergone a tremendous change. As soon as he opened his eyes, he revealed an extremely excited expression and got up.

  However, before he could say anything, Xia ruofei waved his hand and pouted at Song Wei.

  Li Yifu immediately shut his mouth and stood quietly beside Xia ruofei with his hands by his side. However, he could not hide the excitement on his face.

  Today's experience was like a dream.

  To be exact, it was from the moment he met Xia ruofei. Every step he took felt like a dream.

  At that time, he was already over 80 years old, but it was difficult for him to advance on the path of cultivation. He was only a cultivator at the third Qi layer, but he was stuck at the third Qi layer for decades without making any progress.

  At that time, Li Yifu had already given up on the idea of continuing to break through on the path of cultivation.

  However, after meeting his grand uncle - Master Xia ruofei, his fate had changed dramatically.

  Xia ruofei casually gave him a few pointers and he broke through the shackles of refined Qi Level 3. After that, Xia ruofei gave him the Guiyuan Scripture, which was much more perfect than the Guiyuan Scripture that he had cultivated before. In addition, Xia ruofei gave him some cultivation resources, including precious wild tea and spiritual crystals. With the help of the Taixu xuanqing formation, his cultivation started to break through and reached refined Qi Level 7 in just one or two years.

  This time, he had completely subverted his understanding. He had only taken half a spirit fruit, but he had directly soared from lianqi Level 7 to the peak of lianqi level 9, almost touching the bottleneck of the Golden core stage.

  It must be known that even breaking through from the seventh Qi layer to the eighth Qi layer was many times more difficult than when he broke through the bottleneck of the third Qi layer, not to mention breaking through two realms in a row. This was something he didn't even dare to dream of, and it had actually become a reality today.

  Back then, when the Earth's cultivation environment was deteriorating, the Rogue cultivator who had fumbled his way forward on the thorny cultivation path by himself was now able to see the threshold of the Golden core stage. How could Li Yifu suppress his excitement at this time? DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

  Therefore, although he did not dare to speak, his heart was surging with emotions, and his body could not help but tremble slightly.

  Li Yifu didn't have to wait for too long. In just five to six minutes, Song Wei had also finished her cultivation.

  Just like Ling Qingxue, Song Wei's cultivation level reached the peak of refined Qi Level 6 after consuming half a Vermillion Jade Fruit. She was only one step away from refined Qi Level 7.

  When Song Wei opened her eyes, Li Yifu had already knelt down in front of Xia ruofei before she could speak. Song Wei, who was initially overjoyed, was shocked. She swallowed the words that she was about to blurt out.

  With Xia ruofei's current cultivation and reaction speed, it would be easy for him to stop Li Yifu from kneeling.

  However, in a flash, he did not stop Li Yifu, but accepted the kneel.

  Normally, when an 80 - year - old man knelt in front of him, he would feel uncomfortable. Xia ruofei could not avoid it, but he still accepted Li Yifu's kneel.

  He knew that Li Yifu's gratitude came from the bottom of his heart, and the surging emotions needed an outlet to vent. It would not be a good thing if he forcibly stopped Li Yifu from kneeling. Of course, the most important reason was that Li Yifu was Xia ruofei's Grand - disciple, and his Grand - Master was his direct senior. In the world of cultivation, strength and inheritance were more important. In comparison, age was not as important. From this perspective, it was reasonable for Xia ruofei to receive Li Yifu's bow.

  After Li Yifu knelt down, he respectfully kowtowed to Xia ruofei and said in a trembling voice,""Martial granduncle, your disciple has no way to repay you for your kindness. The only thing I can do is to work harder in my cultivation and strive to break through to the Aurous core stage as soon as possible so that I can share your burden in the future ..."

  Xia ruofei had a gentle smile on his face. He raised his hands in the air and Li Yifu was lifted up by a gentle force. He could not help but stand up.

  Xia ruofei smiled and said,"adopted husband, I helped you because you're a junior disciple of my sect. It's also because you have a pure character."
