Chapter 1552: A big profit (2)

Translator: 549690339

Fatty Luo came back to his senses and shouted in shock and anger,”Old Yu, you’re crazy! 58 million! Is there anyone who raises the price like you?”

The crowd was also in a heated discussion.

“Yup! This piece of Jade is only 55 million Yuan at most. I can’t make much profit from it. Maybe I’ll have to pay for the labor!”

“Fifty – five million Yuan is not a bad price. After all, this kind of high – end Jade can add to the brand’s value and can be considered as invisible. However, 58 million is ...”

“President Yu, just because you’re angry with old Luo, you can’t ...”

Yu mingdong looked around at the crowd and said lightly,””For Donghua jewelry, this piece of Jade is more valuable than its actual value, and ... Aren’t we bidding today? Don’t tell me I’m not allowed to pay a high price?”

Fatty Luo said resentfully,”President Yu, the price of Jade is being raised like this. If it’s all like this, how can we continue our business in the future?” Besides ... Does your company have that much liquid capital? You must have spent a lot of money on this public bid, right?”

“That’s not for old director Luo to worry about. I, Yu mingdong, am quite famous in the industry, so I won’t go back on my word. Besides, so many of my peers are watching today! If I don’t have the money ... How am I supposed to survive in this line of work? ” Yu mingdong said lightly.

Then, he ignored fatty Luo and looked at Xia ruofei. He smiled and asked, ” “Mr. Xia, what’s your decision? ”

Xia ruofei smiled and said, ” you’re very sincere. We’ll do as you say. 50 million in cash plus ... Five million worth of Jade! ”

Yu mingdong was stunned for a moment and opened his mouth.

However, before he could speak, Xia ruofei waved his hand and said, ” “I’m also indebted to President Yu for taking care of me this time. I can’t let you suffer a loss! If boss Yu agrees, then we’ll trade according to the plan I proposed. Otherwise, I’ll keep it for myself!”

In fact, Xia ruofei had successfully upgraded the spirit map space and had no urgent need for jadeite.

Besides, he also thought that Yu mingdong was a good person. Just now, everyone thought that the raw stone had lost and many people were gloating. Only Yu mingdong was very righteous and bought the Jade with five million Yuan, hoping that it could reduce Xia ruofei’s loss.

Although Yu mingdong would not lose money even if he took five million, his way of doing things made Xia ruofei’s impression of him much better.

Hence, Xia ruofei would not let Yu mingdong purchase this Violet Jade at a loss.

Yu mingdong looked at Xia ruofei and said after a long while, ” “Mr. Xia, you’re really open! I, Yu mingdong, have made you my friend!”

The Jade merchants who were watching were very envious of Yu mingdong. He received this kind of top-grade Jade that was hard to come by, and the seller even took the initiative to lower the price.

It could be said that many people present were willing to buy it at the price of 55 million, not to mention that the 5 million was deducted with ordinary Jade.

These Jade merchants had a lot of resources. In fact, they wouldn’t really spend five million Yuan to buy a Jade worth five million Yuan. There was a lot of difference in price.

Fatty Luo rolled his eyes and couldn’t help but say,”Mr. Xia, I can also pay 50 million in cash, and ... And give you six million in Jade ...”

Everyone looked at fatty Luo with some disdain. Didn’t Xia ruofei reject the eight million Yuan Jade and lowered it to five million on his own? It was obvious that Yu mingdong was his friend. Why would he care about fatty Luo’s one million more Jade?

As expected, Xia ruofei only glanced at fatty Luo indifferently and said,””Thank you, boss Luo, but I’ve decided to sell this piece of Imperial Jade to Mr. Yu ...”

“Old Yu hasn’t agreed to it yet, right?” Fatty Luo muttered.

When Yu mingdong heard this, he quickly said,”who said I didn’t agree!” Mr. Xia, we’ll do the deal according to your plan! I want this piece of Jade!”

“Happy cooperation!” Xia ruofei smiled and extended his hand to Yu mingdong.

Yu mingdong shook hands with Xia ruofei and said,””Thank you! Thank you!”

His Donghua jewelry had never produced any high – end jade products. Xia ruofei’s top – grade Jade was like a timely rain. It could be said that it had helped him a lot.

“Mr. Xia, I’ll transfer the money to you now!” Yu mingdong said,”I’ll take you to the supplier tomorrow morning to pick out the five million Yuan Jade!”

“There’s no hurry ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“I want it, I want it!” Yu mingdong was also afraid that a long delay would cause more trouble, so he directly asked for Xia ruofei’s account number and then quickly filled out the check.

Originally, the check could not be cashed at night, but the government was very supportive of this public auction. The bank had staff stationed here so that money transfers and transactions could be carried out at any time.

Shi Lei took the check and went next door to transfer the money to Xia ruofei, while Yu mingdong personally looked at his pile of Jade. The most important one was naturally the violet Jade that he had just bought from Xia ruofei.

The bank was very efficient. In a short while, Xia ruofei received a notification on his phone that 55 million Chinese dollars had been deposited into his account. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

This time, Xia ruofei had spent about 12 million on the raw stones. In the blink of an eye, he had earned more than 40 million and upgraded the spirit map space by one level.

This stone gambling was really profitable! Xia ruofei couldn’t help but sigh.

However, he also knew that it was fine to occasionally do such things. If he gambled correctly every time and the prices rose sharply, even a fool would suspect him.

There were certain rules to follow in stone gambling, but after all, the nature of gambling was very big. Didn’t he Ping, a well – known expert, make a wrong judgment? Xia ruofei was a newbie who knew nothing about stone gambling. It would be strange if people didn’t suspect him!

When everyone saw that this piece of Jade had already been taken by Yu mingdong and Xia ruofei had even received the transaction fee, they were all dejected and ready to leave the Qin Zhuan studio to watch the show. They didn’t get any benefits, so why not leave?

“Old Yu, don’t you still have a raw stone that hasn’t been opened?” fatty Luo called out at this time. Why don’t we open them together? I think you’re very lucky today!”

Yu mingdong was also prepared to open the raw stone that he had spent more than 20 million Yuan on tonight. When he heard fatty Luo say this, he immediately nodded and said,” “I was really prepared to cut this piece of material directly!”

The Jade merchants, who were about to leave, stopped in their tracks.

Although Yu mingdong’s stone was not today’s highest bid, it could still be ranked in the top five. Xia ruofei’s raw stone just now had opened their eyes. Everyone wanted to see what kind of stone would be opened from a raw stone that was worth more than 20 million.

Yu mingdong rubbed his hands, looked at his own piece of material, and then turned his gaze to He Ping.

“Old he, this material ...”He said.

He Ping said coldly,” President Yu, I won’t express my opinion!” I’ve already misjudged you just now! Isn’t that little brother of yours on a roll? Let him give you some guidance!”

After he finished speaking, He Ping actually left Yu mingdong behind and left.

Yu mingdong couldn’t help but be stunned. What kind of person is this! He had received a consultation fee of two million from him. He should have been the one to cut the stone, but he actually left after saying a sentence in a strange tone!

Yu mingdong thought about it. After today’s incident, He Ping’s reputation in this line of work was basically ruined. He probably had nothing left to lose.

Yu mingdong didn’t know that although he Ping had left, his reputation was far from the lowest point. No matter if he was there or not, his reputation would soon be hit hard again ...

He Ping left, but the stone-cutting still had to continue.

Without butcher Zhang, would they still be eating hairy pigs? Yu mingdong himself had been in this line of work for more than 20 years. Even without He Ping’s guidance, he could still cut stones himself. At most, he would just be a little more careful.

However, Yu mingdong still looked at Xia ruofei first. His eyes were a little eager as he said, ” “Mr. Xia, why don’t you ... Give me some advice? ”
