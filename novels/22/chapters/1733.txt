Chapter 1734: Yin – yang transformation (1)

Xia ruofei placed the newly brewed Semillon wine on the table at the Archean realm and then left the spirit map space.

The grape wine had to go through the process of being ripened in the bottle before the taste would become more layered. Hence, Xia ruofei placed them in the Archean realm where time flowed 30 times faster.

As for why he didn’t put them in the time array, the reason was simple. The wine took up more space after being bottled. In order to speed up time as much as possible, he set up a small array of flags, just enough to cover two oak barrels. If he wanted to put the bottles of wine in the array, he would have to set them up again.

Not only was this more troublesome, but the flow of time would also be different. Xia ruofei would not be able to calculate the fermentation time of the noble rotten wine. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

When Xia ruofei returned to the outside world, she immediately kept the spirit painting scroll into her body. Then, she took a shower and went to bed.

The next morning, Xia ruofei got up and cultivated for a while. At about 7:30 am, he entered the medium and removed the time formation.

Then, he also used a new oak stick to stir the barrel of wine. Following that, he left the barrel at the Archean realm and left the realm.

After washing up, Xia ruofei felt refreshed. He pushed open the door and walked out to the courtyard. He took a deep breath and stretched as he paced in the courtyard.

“Good Morning!” Feng Jing walked out of her room and said with a smile.

“Good Morning, sister Che!” Xia ruofei said,”it seems like you slept well! You look good!”

“How can I not sleep well in such a luxurious mansion?” Feng Rao smiled. RUO Fei, it’s about time, right? We should set off ...”

Xia ruofei looked at his watch and said,”let’s go after breakfast!” Don’t worry, it’s the weekend, so there won’t be any traffic!”

“En!” Feng Jing nodded.

The two of them came to the backyard. Wu Qiang had already prepared breakfast, which was steamed buns and soy milk bought from the breakfast stall in the alley. The three of them finished eating quickly and then got into the car to head to the airport.

As expected, the journey was smooth. When they reached the airport, Xia ruofei helped Feng Jing to get her luggage out of the car and said to Wu Qiang,””Wu Qiang, leave the car to me. I still have something to do later, so please take a taxi back!”

As Xia ruofei spoke, he took out two hundred Yuan from his wallet and handed it to Wu Qiang.

“Director Xia, I have money ...” Wu Qiang quickly said.

Xia ruofei stuffed the money into Wu Qiang’s hands and said,””That’s a separate matter. You’re working for me, so how can I let you pay for your own expenses? This money had been paid for! Refund more and pay less!”

Wu Qiang could only accept the money and said,”Thank you, boss!”

Then, he carefully locked the car and passed the car keys to Xia ruofei. Then, Wu Qiang said to Feng Jing,””President Feng, I won’t be sending you in then. I wish you a safe journey!”

“Thank you!” Feng Rao said with a smile.

Wu Qiang stopped a taxi by the side of the road and returned to siheyuan. Xia ruofei sent Feng Jing to the departure hall, changed her boarding pass with her, and sent her to the security check.

Feng Jing took the luggage from Xia ruofei and said,””Alright, ruofei, you can drop me off here!”

Xia ruofei reached out to adjust Feng Jing’s scarf and said,””Sister ran, be careful on the road. Remember to send me a WeChat message when you reach Mt. Three! By the way, before you turn off your phone, don’t forget to ask Liu Qian to arrange for you to pick us up ...”

Feng Rao’s heart warmed. Xia ruofei’s seemingly nagging words were actually filled with concern for her.

“Don’t worry!”Feng Rao laughed. The plane tickets were booked by Liu Qian, so she’ll definitely make arrangements for the pick – up!”

If the leader had to specifically explain such a small matter, then Liu Qian would not be able to continue being the president’s assistant. She was really too blind!

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”that’s fine!” You go! If there’s anything you can’t bring onto the plane, I can bring it back for you ...”

“Aren’t you afraid of being recognized by the fans and reporters?”Feng Jing asked with a smile.

Xia ruofei subconsciously shrunk his neck, then tidied his mask and said,””What are you afraid of? No one will be able to recognize me in my current state! And you really think I’m a big star? Everyone’s attention was only on it for three minutes. After this matter cooled down, no one paid any attention to it!”

Xia ruofei was really “fully armed” now. Not only was he wearing a thick down jacket and a mask, but he also used the Special Forces ‘disguising skills to change his appearance. He put on a pair of flat glasses and even his aura was completely different from before.

Feng Rao laughed and said,”look at how scared you are!” Alright, alright, I won’t talk to you anymore. It’s almost time to board!”

He left the house a little late today, so Feng Jing didn’t need to wait for long before boarding.

Xia ruofei watched as Feng Jing passed through the security check. When Feng Jing turned around to look at him, he stood on his tiptoes and waved at her. Feng Jing smiled and waved back at Xia ruofei. Then, she turned around and walked towards the departure lounge.

Xia ruofei only left the airport Hall after Feng Jing disappeared from his sight.

After he got his car from the parking lot, he went straight to little Tang town.

At around 10 O’ clock, Xia ruofei had already arrived at the plot of land that now belonged to them.
