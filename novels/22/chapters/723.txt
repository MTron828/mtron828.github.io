Chapter 724: Enthusiastic and enthusiastic (1)

Walmart’s offer was very attractive. Although President Chen was the General Manager of the southeast Region, he was also very influential in the entire Huaxia region, so he directly promised to give Walmart the best sales position for Paradise Fruit in the country.

In particular, the Sam’s Club was a warehouse – style shopping club under Walmart that specialized in serving its members. It had a large number of high – Quality member customers, and the spending power of these members was higher than that of ordinary customers. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

If Paradise Fruit could enter 13 Sam’s member stores in the country, the benefits of the promotion of the Paradise brand would be obvious.

As soon as President Chen spoke, the representatives of some other super – Commercial channels also couldn’t hold back. Whether it was the representatives of Hualian, Yonghui, Carrefour, or Xinhua, they all spoke one after another and promised to give a series of preferential conditions to Taoyuan fruit in order to fight for a little more quota.

Feng Jing, who had come with Xia ruofei, was also dumbfounded when she saw the situation.

Although she had no doubts about Xia ruofei’s ability to expand sales, these sales representatives were fighting to cooperate with paradise Corporation as soon as they came up. Feng Jing did not dare to imagine such a situation.

Of course, this was partly due to the high quality of the peach blossom fruit. On the other hand, it was also due to the popularity of the Drunken Eight Immortals wine. Everyone wanted to express their goodwill to Ding Feng winery through this method.

The executives of these super – Commercial channels were very well – informed. They knew very well that Taoyuan company was actually a shareholder of Ding Feng winery, and they held a lot of shares. Moreover, Taoyuan fruit itself had such high quality, so they naturally fought to cooperate.

Xia ruofei felt that the situation was getting out of control, so he quickly stood up and said,””Everyone, everyone! Please be patient!”

After Xia ruofei stood up, the people in charge of the Super – Commercial channels gradually quieted down.

Xia ruofei then continued,”everyone, you’ve all inspected our Orchard today and tasted our Tao Yuan premium organic fruits. As for the quota, we’re not sure yet. We’re all old friends and I have other business partners who are interested in working with us. It’s not good to favor one over the other, right?”

The people in charge of the Super – Commercial channels all nodded. Walmart’s President Chen said,””President Xia, as for the specifics of the cooperation, you can come up with a Constitution! We’ll do our best to cooperate!”

“That’s right, President Xia, just say the word!” The southeast District Manager of the Yonghui supermarket chain also said.

......

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”what do you think?” After everyone goes back, as long as you have the intention to cooperate, you can contact manager li of Ding Feng winery. Of course, we also hope that everyone can clearly state the preferential conditions that you can provide to Tao Yuan company when the two sides cooperate. We’ll work out a quota as soon as possible according to everyone’s needs and try to satisfy everyone, okay?”

These people in charge of the Super – Commercial channels also knew that it was unrealistic to ask the Paradise company to promise them a quota of how many kilograms today. They must consider the preferential conditions offered by the various channels.

When the quality of a product reached a certain level, the balance between the distributors and the product provider would be reversed.

Therefore, even though they knew that Xia ruofei was just waiting for the right price, they could only accept it.

Who asked him to have two high – Quality products, the Drunken Eight Immortals wine and the Tao Yuan premium organic fruits in his hands?

What’s more, Taoyuan vegetables ‘reputation was gradually growing. These super – Commercial channel heads were all thinking of introducing Taoyuan vegetables, this killer weapon, into their respective supermarket stores!

As if he had heard the thoughts of the people in charge, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””As you can see when you entered the door, our farm is undergoing expansion and transformation. We have built 18 vegetable greenhouses and professional cold storages. After the expansion is completed, our production capacity will reach three to four times the current production capacity, so I believe that in the near future, we should have great opportunities for cooperation in the sales of Taoyuan vegetables.”

The eyes of the people in charge of the Super – Commercial channels lit up when they heard this. The dissatisfaction that a few of them had disappeared and they started to chat with Xia ruofei enthusiastically.

Xia ruofei also communicated with them with ease.

Xia ruofei welcomed the representatives of the Super – Commercial channels warmly. After visiting the orchard, he brought them to visit the construction site and some of the vegetable greenhouses. Other than the pomfrets cultivation workshop, which was not suitable for so many people, he brought them to visit most of the farm.

In the afternoon, Xia ruofei invited them to a meal at the staff canteen.

The ingredients were naturally the Taoyuan vegetables from the greenhouse and the space carp, chubs, and so on that Xia ruofei had contributed.

Xia ruofei even took out a few bottles of Drunken Eight Immortals wine and Semillon white wine. Everyone enjoyed the meal and was full of praise for the Taoyuan vegetables and the two wines provided today.

After tasting it personally, the representatives of these super – Commercial channels were even more eager to become the agent of Peach Garden vegetables. They all enthusiastically chatted with Xia ruofei.

There were also people who were very interested in the Semillon wine and offered to sell it to Xia ruofei.

However, there were only 30 boxes of Semillon, and Xia ruofei kept them for himself or for his friends and elders.
