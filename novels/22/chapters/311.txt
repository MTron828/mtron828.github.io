Chapter 312: Still 10 million

The carpenter put down the electric plane and picked up a wet cloth that he had prepared earlier to wipe off the wood shavings on the window. After repeatedly wiping it clean, he took out a small jar of lacquer from his bag and brushed a thin layer evenly with a brush. Since it was only to test the quality of the wood, the carpenter didn’t pay too much attention to it. After applying the colorless lacquer, he took out a hair dryer and dried the paint. Then, he gestured to Liang Weimin, packed up his tools, and left. As soon as the carpenter left, elder Tang and the others immediately surrounded him. Liang Weimin and Liang Weihua, who were following closely behind the old man, were especially nervous. Of course, the two of them were hoping for the opposite result. Xia ruofei remained calm. He didn’t even follow them. He just sat on the plastic stool and smiled. Elder Tang took the lead and was the first to approach the Phoebe zhennan wood. When his eyes fell on the window of the material, the experienced old man couldn’t help but gasp and let out a hiss. Liang Weimin and Liang Weihua, who were following closely behind, stood there in a daze, their mouths agape. The Liang family’s relatives ‘reactions were similar. Each and every one of them was stunned on the spot, their faces filled with disbelief. For a moment, no one in the warehouse spoke, only the sound of heavy breathing. What entered everyone’s eyes was the dense patterns on the window. These patterns emitted a little golden light under the light, and this golden halo would change shape and shadow with the change of perspective. The patches of golden patterns gave people a dreamy feeling. Top – grade! This was definitely a top – grade Phoebe zhennan! Everyone was screaming in their hearts, and the way they looked at this piece of wood became somewhat different. The person with the most interesting expression was undoubtedly Liang Weihua. He was also stunned by the quality of the material at first, but then he came back to his senses and realized what it meant for him to have such a good quality. His face turned pale. Liang Xiaojun’s eyes were also filled with unwillingness. He stared at the Golden Nannan material, wishing that a fire would suddenly fall from the sky and burn this wood to ashes. There was no doubt that this Phoebe zhennan material was definitely not a fake. The Golden patterns inside were in pieces, indicating that the quality of this material was extremely high. It was probably impossible to buy it for ten million Yuan. The Liang family’s relatives had been searching for Aurelia wood for the Tang family’s grandfather for the past two years, so they were more or less familiar with the appraisal of wood. As such, they looked at Liang Weihua with a gloating gaze. Liang Weihua had just said that if the quality of the window was very good, he would pay for the extra money. These past few days, Liang Weihua had found the Phoebe zhennan material and tried to please the old man, which had long made these relatives secretly jealous. Even though it was Liang Weimin’s turn to be in the limelight now, and they had nothing to do with it, they still felt very relieved. Elder Tang stared blankly for a long time. Suddenly, his eyes lit up and he leaned in even closer. He didn’t even care that the paint had yet to dry as he used his hands to hold onto the material. His entire body was about to lie on it. Elder Tang looked at it carefully for a long time before he stood up with a happy expression. “Uncle, this piece of material performed well, right?” Liang Weimin asked with a smile. He had already made up his mind. Elder Tang nodded with a smile. Liang Weimin lowered his voice a little and sighed.”AI! I could’ve gotten it for ten million, but now that the window’s open, I’m afraid the price will be much better ...” Liang Weihua’s face turned red and white after he heard that. He said angrily,””Liang Weimin, this is how opening windows are supposed to be. Anything can happen. I’ve already said that no matter how high the price is, I’ll pay for it!” Elder Tang chuckled.”Wei Hua, you don’t have to pay for it. It’s not like I’m short of money. It’s rare for me to come across such a good material. It’s no big deal to spend a little more money. You don’t have to take it to heart.” “Uncle, how can we do this!” Liang Weihua hurriedly said,”it’s all because of me that you ...” Elder Tang waved his hand with a smile. He had made up his mind and was not willing to talk about this matter anymore. Elder Tang walked up to Xia ruofei and smiled,””Brother Xia, you’re really patient!” Old master Tang had changed the way he addressed Xia ruofei to “brother Xia”. The relatives of the Liang family couldn’t help but gasp. Even Liang Weimin couldn’t help but take a few more glances at Xia ruofei. Liang Weihua and his son’s faces naturally turned even uglier. Everyone could tell that elder Tang had a good impression of Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei just smiled and said,””That’s because I’m confident in what I have! If I don’t even dare to open the window, I won’t sell that kind of material. Brother Liang is my good friend. I can cheat anyone but my own friend. This is the bottom line of my principles. ” “Hahaha!” Elder Tang laughed heartily.”It’s Lil ‘Chao’s good fortune to have a friend like you!” “The old master is too kind.” Xia ruofei said neither humbly nor arrogantly. He wasn’t flattered by the world’s richest man’s high evaluation of him. In fact, Xia ruofei had met too many big shots since he retired from the Army. Be it Master Song or MA Xiong, their wealth and status were not inferior to elder Tang. Besides, Xia ruofei was a quiet person and did not like to suck up to people. He had no desires, so he naturally could hold his own. On the other hand, Liang Weimin and Yuan Shan were both surprised and happy. It was obvious that most of the credit for today’s incident was given to Liang Qichao. They looked at Xia ruofei with gratitude. Elder Tang sat down beside Xia ruofei with a smile.””Brother Xia, I’m determined to get this material! We can discuss the price again. ” “Haha, old man, the old rules are still the same. You can name your price!” Xia ruofei said,”as long as the price is right, this piece of material is yours!” Elder Tang laughed and looked into Xia ruofei’s eyes,””What if I offer another ten million?” Xia ruofei replied without hesitation,”as long as you think it’s a good price, then that’s fine!” Who asked you to be brother Liang’s maternal grandfather?” Elder Tang was stunned for a moment before bursting into laughter. “Brother Xia, I can only offer you 10 million for this piece of material ...” He said seriously. Liang Weimin couldn’t help but widen his eyes when he heard this. This wasn’t his uncle’s style! He knew that his uncle had always been very forthright when it came to money. When he saw something he liked, he would be even more generous. He would not care about the price at all. The value of this material was obviously more than ten million Yuan. How could the old man go with the flow and really offer ten million Yuan? After Liang Weihua was stunned for a moment, he quickly revealed a well – hidden look of joy. Could there be a problem with this material? Or did uncle not want to pay more? He didn’t even consider the fact that elder Tang had flown all the way from the United States just for a piece of material. Why would he care about a small amount of money that was nothing to him? Liang Weihua was praying that Xia ruofei would reject him immediately. It would be best if the two of them fell out and parted on bad terms. However, no one expected that elder Tang had only finished half of his sentence. Elder Tang paused and looked at Xia ruofei with a smile. Xia ruofei’s expression remained the same, even with a faint smile on his face. He was not affected by the price he had offered. Elder Tang nodded in approval. Elder Tang smiled and continued,””But the 10 million I’m talking about isn’t Chinese dollars, it’s US dollars!”
