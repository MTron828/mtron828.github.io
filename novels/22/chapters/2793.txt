Messi was very active in the past few minutes. After he took the ball in front of the penalty area and did a wall – colliding combination with cutinho, he deftly broke into the penalty area.

Messi’s characteristics were very distinct. His pace was very fast and he was always able to grab the ball in front of the opponent. His movements to break through the opponent were not large, but the effect was very obvious.

After Messi took the ball, he looked up and found that the one defending him was actually Xia ruofei, who had been pulling the ball away from bar?a’s passes. The Espanyol’s rear defensive line also changed positions frequently, and Xia ruofei just happened to fill in the position.

Messi was a little happy. He knew that Xia ruofei was an offensive player. Such players were often not as experienced as professional defenders in terms of defense. They lacked defensive techniques, actions, and experience. That was why Messi himself was so lacking. In fact, he was basically not involved in the team’s defense, unless the situation was very passive.

Originally, zuáres had already run out of an empty space in the middle, and Messi had the opportunity to send the ball to zuáres ‘side. However, when he realized that Xia ruofei was defending him, he gave up on the attempt to pass the ball and decided to bypass Xia ruofei.

As long as he could break through Xia ruofei’s line of defense, there would be a lot of space for him to shoot.

Messi’s movement to pass the ball was very simple. He took the ball and rushed straight towards Xia ruofei, the frequency of his small steps was very fast. Xia ruofei, just as Messi had judged, rushed to block the ball.

Messi poked the football with confidence and then quickly poked the ball in the opposite direction. Many experienced defenders would be swayed in the face of Messi’s extremely fast change of direction.

Even if he knew that Messi would do this, his body could not react in time. After losing his center of gravity, his body would be in a deadlock, and he could only watch Messi pass by.

Therefore, the fans who often watched the highlights of Messi’s play knew that some of his passes were not fancy moves, but the defensive players were like wooden stakes, watching Messi pass without doing anything.

In the face of Xia ruofei’s defense, Messi still used his most familiar breakthrough method.

When Messi kicked the ball to the left, Xia ruofei leaned his body to the right and extended his leg to intercept.

A hint of joy flashed in Messi’s eyes. He did not stop his feet and immediately made a reverse poke.

At this moment, Xia ruofei was already leaning to his right. His center of gravity had also tilted to the right. Under normal circumstances, it was impossible for him to adjust in an instant.

However, in the next second, Messi could not help but stare at Xia ruofei with his eyes wide open, as if he was not affected by the laws of physics at all. After his second pass, Xia ruofei’s tilted body suddenly straightened up. At the moment he passed the ball, Xia ruofei’s left foot also stretched out and just hit the football.

The football immediately bounced up.

At this time, Messi was still in a brief state of shock, but Xia ruofei reacted extremely quickly. After intercepting the ball, he immediately raised his right foot and flicked the ball lightly. He flicked the football over Messi’s head and hid behind him.

At this time, Messi was still in a forward posture. He also felt the helplessness of his opponents ‘loss of center of gravity. The idea in his mind was to immediately turn around and press on the spot, but his body was completely out of control and was stiff in place.

Xia ruofei was like a cheetah. After a beautiful flick, he immediately rushed forward and firmly controlled the ball.

The first 1V1 match between Messi and Xia ruofei ended with Xia ruofei’s complete victory.

When Xia ruofei grabbed the ball and started to pick it up to pass the opponent, his spiritual power had already swept out.

He found that the Spanish players had retreated very deep. Not only did the midfielders and attacking midfielders return to the vicinity of the penalty area to participate in the defense, but even the strikers had also retreated to the front of the penalty area to support Barcelona’s smooth attack, pressing down on the Spanish formation.

Even Wu Lei and iglasias did not expect Xia ruofei to be able to complete the interception against Messi so cleanly. Therefore, they did not speed up and sprint towards bar?a’s half of the field.

Hence, even though Xia ruofei managed to catch the ball by surprise, there was no place for him to pass the ball. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

After the Barcelona team lost the ball, they would launch a counter – grab on the spot, and they had been very familiar with this kind of siege.

Xia ruofei had just unloaded the ball when he immediately sensed three or four opposing players approaching him at the same time with his spiritual power. Messi, who was behind him, had already turned around and quickly caught up.

Xia ruofei was faced with the fate of being chased and blocked.

In fact, Espanyol had also intercepted before, but without exception, they were all counter – intercepted by bar?a.

There was no teammate in the front field to receive him, and behind him was their own penalty area. Messi had also come back to catch up. Xia ruofei naturally could not pass the ball back. Otherwise, once he made a mistake, it could be fatal.

He had made the best decision in an instant to break through.

Xia ruofei did not expect the attack to pose any threat. He felt that as long as the football was as far away from the penalty area as possible, it would be considered a success.

From the moment he intercepted Messi’s interception to the moment he made this decision, it was basically a matter of a flash of thought. After he made up his mind, Barcelona’s artil was the first to press forward.

Xia ruofei was not flustered at all as he faced artil’s fierce attack. He did not hesitate to use a very realistic cow tail movement and directly passed artil.
