Chapter 388: Chapter 357 – eating and taking_1

Xia ruofei knew Ling Qingxue’s personality very well. He knew that she would not take the initiative to show off.

Lu You thought for a while and said,”alright, there’s nothing I can’t tell you ...”

Then, she explained the whole story.

It turned out that Ling Qingxue, Lu You, and Jiang Yue had been keeping in touch all this while. They would even go out to eat and go shopping together sometimes.

Yesterday, the three of them had arranged to go to the movies. Lu You and Jiang Yue had discovered that Ling Qingxue’s skin had become much better than before. Ling Qingxue’s skin was already very good to begin with, and after using the Jade skin cream, it became even more crystal clear and delicate. Furthermore, her entire person seemed to be glowing from the inside out.

Girls were sensitive in this aspect, so Lu You and Jiang Yue naturally could tell immediately.

Naturally, the two of them couldn’t help but ask Ling Qingxue what kind of makeup she had been using these past few days to have such an immediate effect.

Ling Qingxue didn’t want to tell them at first, but she couldn’t resist Lu You and Jiang Yue’s coaxing and pestering. In the end, she still told them.

At first, Lu You thought that it was some kind of cosmetic product that was sold outside. She did not expect that Ling Qingxue was actually using a Facial Mask that Xia ruofei had made personally. Now, she could not buy it. However, she was also thinking about the Jade skin cream.

That’s why there was a phone call today.

Xia ruofei could not help but feel shocked after hearing this. Ling Qingxue had actually become good friends with Lu You and Jiang Yue. They even went shopping, ate, and watched movies together? What was this girl thinking? Weren’t they all ready to draw their swords that day?

It was really hard to guess a girl’s thoughts.

After Lu You finished speaking, she saw that Xia ruofei didn’t say anything and couldn’t help but say,””Xia ruofei, I’ve told you everything. You’ve promised to give me some face masks. You can’t go back on your word!”

Xia ruofei finally came back to his senses. He smiled and said,””Don’t worry! I’m a man of my word, I’ll definitely do this for you!”

“That’s more like it ...” Lu You’s mood was great, and she also revealed a rare smile.

“Come to the farm in the afternoon to get it!” Xia ruofei said.

“It’s a deal!” Lu You said happily.

After hanging up, Xia ruofei continued to drive and returned to the farm in no time.

He bade farewell to ye Lingyun, who was diligently practicing his tea – making skills, and hurriedly went upstairs to his room. There was still some time before lunch, so he could go to the original space to make some Jade skin cream and deal with the jar of wine.

After Xia ruofei locked the door and windows, he summoned the spirit painting and entered the medium.

He first picked up a bottle of diluted spirit Heart Flower petal solution, opened the clay seal of the jar of wine, and poured the entire solution in. Then, he mixed the spatial spirit pond water with the spatial soil, and sealed the mouth of the pond again.

Then, Xia ruofei used his mind to connect with the space. An invisible spatial force immediately wrapped around the big wine jar and gently lifted it up to a foot above the ground. Now, Xia ruofei’s mental strength had greatly improved. He could easily lift things that weighed 500 to 600 catties with the spatial force.

With a thought, the wine jar immediately floated outward according to His will. Only when it was very close to the space membrane did he control the wine jar to land on the ground smoothly.

This jar of wine had to be stored in the original space for a whole year, which was equivalent to 30 years in the space. Hence, Xia ruofei decided to place it in the most remote place so that he would not have to move it when he opened up the original space in the future.

After dealing with the jar of wine, Xia ruofei started to make the jaded skin ointment.

This time, he was prepared to make more. The last time was his first time, and he wasn’t too confident, so he made a standard portion, which was enough for Ling Qingxue to use five times.

With the first successful experience, Xia ruofei’s confidence increased greatly. This time, he took ten portions.

Fortunately, the claypot was big enough to make ten portions of jaded skin ointment.

Xia ruofei started a fire with the best charcoal and started the process.

After about an hour, he had successfully made the jaded skin ointment.

Xia ruofei took out three small preservation boxes, each containing one portion. Then, the remaining jaded skin ointment was placed together in a large preservation box. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

This type of lekou container was very practical. Xia ruofei had purchased a lot of them online. There were all kinds of them, big and small, and it was very convenient to use them at any time.

Xia ruofei took the three containers and left the medium. He strolled downstairs and placed the container with the jaded skin ointment in the safe layer of the refrigerator.

After making sure that there was no one around, he contacted the realm and took out a big grass carp from the fish pond in the realm. He also took out some of the vegetables that he had stored in the realm earlier. There were a few cabbages, a few cucumbers, and three to four tomatoes.

Then, he put on his apron and rolled up his sleeves to prepare for lunch.

Xia ruofei had just finished cleaning the fish in the pond when his phone rang.

Hence, he put the grass carp down and wiped his hands on his apron. He took out his phone from his pocket and saw that it was Lu You calling again.

Xia ruofei pressed the answer button, but before he could speak, he heard Lu You say,””Xia ruofei, I’m at the entrance of the farm, but your security guard has stopped my car outside. Help me tell him ...”
