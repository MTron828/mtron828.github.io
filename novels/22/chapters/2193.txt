“It’s quite delicious!” Ling Qingxue said.

Xia ruofei watched as Ling Qingxue quickly swallowed the fruit. He smiled and asked,””Qingxue, how do you feel?”

Ling Qingxue took a tissue from the tissue box on the bedside table and wiped her mouth, then said,””I don’t feel anything! I just feel that the taste is not ... Eh? What was going on? It’s like in the dantian ...”

As Ling Qingxue spoke, she turned over and sat up. She didn’t care that she was naked. She sat cross – legged on the bed and started to practice the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra”.

Once Ling Qingxue entered a state of cultivation, her expression would become extremely focused, giving off a pure and holy feeling.

However, she had no clothes on her at the moment and she was sitting cross – legged in an extremely alluring position. Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat when he saw her and he almost lost control of himself.

He quickly looked away and used his spiritual power to observe Ling Qingxue’s condition.

Ling Qingxue cultivated for about an hour and a half before she let out a long breath and stood up.

Only then did she realize that she wasn’t wearing any clothes. She couldn’t help but scream and quickly burrowed into the blanket like a frightened deer. Then, she asked in a coy tone,””RUO Fei, why didn’t you remind me? It’s so embarrassing!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”wife, I’m not stupid!” Where would I usually see such a sexy scene? Why should I remind you?”

Ling Qingxue glared at Xia ruofei with a red face and said,””You ... You’re full of bad ideas ...”

She had wanted to ignore Xia ruofei and ignore him for the time being, but she could not hold back her curiosity. After a minute, she could not help but ask,””RUO Fei, what kind of fruit did you give me? In just one hour, my cultivation has increased by a huge amount! This effect is too amazing!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Of course, I gave you something good. But I don’t know what this fruit is called. Wife, since you’ve finished absorbing it, you can eat the other fruit too!”

“I know ...” Ling Qingxue nodded and asked,”what special effects does this fruit have?”

“You guess!” Xia ruofei blinked and asked with a smile.

“Guess your head!” Ling Qingxue said unhappily. Then, she took a big bite of the fruit, as if she was mistaking it for Xia ruofei.

She also finished the fruit in a few bites and was ready for battle. Unexpectedly, the fiery feeling in her dantian did not appear. Instead, she felt a cool sensation in her head, as if a clear stream was nourishing her soul, making her so comfortable that she almost moaned out.

After about half an hour, the cool and moist feeling gradually disappeared.

Ling Qingxue sensed for a moment and cried out in surprise,””RUO Fei, this fruit can actually nourish the soul! It’s simply too miraculous ... My spiritual power has suddenly increased by a small realm!”

“You’ve reached the spirit throbbing stage?” Xia ruofei asked in surprise.

“En!” Ling Qingxue nodded her head and said,”this is a real surprise! Ruofei, the effect of this fruit is really amazing!”

Xia ruofei’s feelings were a little complicated.

Ling Qingxue’s cultivation had improved, and her spiritual power had reached the spirit throb stage. He was naturally happy for her.

But at the same time, as Ling Qingxue’s cultivation level increased, the day they could cultivate their spirit bodies together was getting closer and closer. This also meant that the day he could tell Ling Qingxue about Song Wei’s matter was getting closer and closer.

Xia ruofei’s heart was filled with anxiety. He had no confidence at all. At the same time, he was afraid that the moment he laid his cards on the table, he would lose Ling Qingxue completely. He was in a very conflicted mood.

Seeing Ling Qingxue’s excitement, Xia ruofei shook his head to get rid of all the distracting thoughts. Then, he said,””Qingxue, I still have a few of these fruits with me, but I guess the effect is the best the first time you eat it. It will be weakened a lot after you eat it.”

“Then don’t waste it ...” Ling Qingxue immediately said.

“What are you saying? How can it be a waste if it’s for my wife?” Xia ruofei said,”what I mean is that you should eat one fruit each from tomorrow onwards. After eating for five days, I think there won’t be any effect.”

This kind of fruit didn’t have any obvious effect when it was consumed by people with high cultivation. Similarly, if the same person consumed it many times, the effect would only be most obvious the first time.

“Ah? That extravagant?” Ling Qingxue was a little hesitant.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s nothing!” However ... I have to use special means to keep this fruit, or it will spoil easily. That’s why ... You have to come to me every day to take it ...”

Ling Qingxue blushed and said,””I know ...”

Then, Ling Qingxue crawled out from under the blanket and said as she put on her clothes,””Ruofei, I’m not sleepy anymore after being stimulated by this fruit. Why don’t we ... Cultivate for a while?”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”sure!” I’ll go get the formation flags!”

With that, he put on his pajamas and jumped off the bed. He walked out of the door and stayed in the next room for a while. Then he took out the array flag from the space and went back to the bedroom with it. He locked the door of the room.

Xia ruofei skillfully set up the time formation on the carpet in the bedroom. Then, he walked into the formation with Ling Qingxue hand in hand.

The two of them sat down cross – legged and Ling Qingxue was about to enter a state of cultivation. Xia ruofei smiled and said,””By the way, we don’t need to use crystals today ...”

“You don’t need crystals?” Ling Qingxue was stunned for a moment.”The spiritual Qi of heaven and earth is very chaotic!” Moreover, the amount is quite small, and it can’t support our cultivation at all!”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”not using spiritual crystals doesn’t mean that there are no other aids!” Just wait and see!”

With that, Xia ruofei put his hand into his pocket. When he took it out again, there was a piece of crystal in his hand.

“We’ll use it today!”He said with a smile.

“What’s this?” Ling Qingxue looked curiously at the origin crystal in Xia ruofei’s hand and said,”such pure energy!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”of course it’s good stuff!” Wife, come! Don’t waste time ...”

“Oh!” Ling Qingxue stuck out her tongue and quickly extended her palms.

Xia ruofei pressed his palm against Ling Qingxue ‘s, and the origin crystal was held between their palms.

The two of them tacitly circulated the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” mental cultivation method, and instantly, an extremely pure energy was emitted from the origin crystal, following the two’s meridians and reaching their dantian.

Ling Qingxue’s cultivation level was slowly increasing as she completed the Qi circulation. More and more spiritual Qi was being converted into true Qi in her dantian.

Using Origin crystals to cultivate was much more efficient than using spiritual crystals. Even Xia ruofei, who was at level 8 of the refinement stage, felt that he had benefited a lot.

He had accompanied Ling Qingxue in the array for three to four days, and he could actually faintly feel the existence of refined Qi level 9. That bottleneck was already in sight, and it could be said that the breakthrough was just around the corner.

Ling Qingxue’s cultivation had also increased by a large margin.

The “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” was originally a cultivation technique that was very suitable for two people to practice together. If it was cultivated alone, it would not even be as good as an ordinary cultivation technique. However, once two people practiced it together, it was simply a super cultivation technique. Especially the spirit body combined cultivation, it could really be said to be the creativity of a genius.

Xia ruofei was full of admiration for the creator of the “Scripture of the primogenitor”.

It was no wonder that this cultivation technique was recorded in the Jade talisman of inheritance in the spirit map world.

When Xia ruofei was not by her side, Ling Qingxue could only cultivate alone, so her efficiency had always been low. Every time Xia ruofei trained with her, her cultivation would improve by a step. She felt like a child from a poor family celebrating the New Year. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Ling Qingxue could already feel the bottleneck of refined Qi Level 3. As long as she practiced with Xia ruofei for a few more days, she would be able to break through.

Xia ruofei kept the time array flag and put it in the drawer of the bedside table. He smiled and said,””Qingxue, it’s already past threeo’ clock. Let’s take this time to sleep! I still have to work tomorrow!”
