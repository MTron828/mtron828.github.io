With a bang, the spotlight was hit, and sparks and smoke came out of it. Then, it hit the center of the dance floor.

At this time, the music in the bar had stopped long ago. However, the people who came to the bar generally liked to watch the fun, so many people did not leave. Two unlucky people were hit by the spotlight and fell to the ground with blood flowing out of their heads. It was unknown whether they were Dead or Alive.

There were also screams in the bar. Everyone realized the danger and ran out of the door.

After Xia ruofei had sent the bar chair flying, he slowly turned around and saw a cold – looking man in a black suit moving his wrists and fingers as he steadily walked towards him.

The few men on the ground quickly shouted,””Brother Tiger, help ...”

Xia ruofei left the wailing men behind and walked towards brother Hu in a black suit.

The two of them stared at each other with lightning – like eyes. The atmosphere suddenly became tense, as if there was an invisible murderous aura between the two of them, causing the temperature in the room to drop by a lot.

When they were about four to five meters apart, brother Tiger started to speed up and clenched his fist. Xia ruofei could clearly see a few cold glints on his fist. Brother Tiger was obviously wearing brass knuckles.

Brother Tiger’s aura had risen, but Xia ruofei was still maintaining a constant speed. There was no change in his expression.

The distance of four to five meters was closed in an instant. Brother Tiger’s eyes flashed with a cold light and he did not hesitate to throw a right hook at Xia ruofei. The fist made a whooshing sound and it was so fast that ordinary people would not be able to react in time.

Xia ruofei didn’t seem to see it. He didn’t even try to Dodge. Brother Tiger could already see the fist landing on Xia ruofei’s face and the flesh and blood splattering. However, just as his fist was about to touch Xia ruofei’s skin, Xia ruofei mysteriously disappeared.

Brother Tiger’s expression changed drastically, and at the same time, a sense of extreme danger rose in his heart.

He could be considered as a battle – hardened man. Subconsciously, he dodged. However, in the eyes of Xia ruofei, who had been strengthened by the body tempering soup several times, he was as slow as a snail.

Xia ruofei’s simple punch landed on brother Tiger’s soft ribs. With a crack, his ribs were broken.

Then, Xia ruofei took a step forward and appeared in front of brother Tiger. In a very short period of time, he threw a dozen or twenty punches, each one aimed at brother Tiger’s chest and abdomen.

The burly men lying on the ground could not see Xia ruofei’s movements clearly. They only felt that Xia ruofei’s hands were like phantoms and they could hear the continuous muffled sounds of beating.

Then, they saw brother Tiger fall to the ground without even making a sound. Blood was flowing from the corner of his mouth. He was obviously seriously injured.

The whole process took less than three seconds. Xia ruofei dodged, counterattacked, and punched continuously in one go.

Those burly men looked as if they had seen a ghost. Each and every one of them even forgot the pain in their bodies as they couldn’t help but open their mouths.

Was he still human? They had the same thought in their hearts.

Brother Tiger was master Luo’s number one subordinate and also their company’s top fighter. He had once participated in underground fighting competitions and defeated many world – Class Masters.

They had never seen brother Tiger lose in a fight before, let alone being completely crushed without any suspense.

Even Xia ruofei’s breathing was as steady as usual. There was no change in his expression, as if he had just completed an insignificant task.

He looked coldly at brother Tiger, who was lying on the ground unconscious. Then, without hesitation, he raised his foot and stomped down.

With a crack, brother Hu’s right wrist was crushed by Xia ruofei’s foot. The intense pain woke him up from his coma and he groaned.

However, brother Tiger was also a man. He did not scream in such a heart – wrenching pain. He just gritted his teeth tightly, and beads of sweat quickly appeared on his forehead.

Xia ruofei squatted down and calmly lit up the screen of his phone. He showed the photo to brother Hu and asked,””Tell me where she is.”

Brother Tiger obviously had a higher status than the other men, so Xia ruofei went to him directly.

Brother Tiger sneered and glared at Xia ruofei. He kept his mouth shut and was not prepared to speak.

Xia ruofei had already expected this. His expression did not change at all. With a flip of his hand, a sharp military dagger appeared in his hand like magic.

Then, Xia ruofei waved his hand and cut it without hesitation. The dagger that was shining with a cold light cut off brother Tiger’s left thumb as if it was tofu.

“Ah!” Brother Tiger let out a shrill cry and his entire body was struggling frantically. However, Xia ruofei’s knee was pressing down on him, and he could not break free at all.

Xia ruofei replied indifferently,”my patience is limited. I won’t ask a second time.” From now on, I will cut off one of your fingers every five seconds. If you don’t open your mouth after one minute, not only will you lose all your fingers, but you will also have to say goodbye to your lifeblood. If you still don’t open your mouth after becoming a eunuch, your eyeball will be the next one to say goodbye to you. The time starts now ...”

“Who are you?” Hu Zi’s voice trembled as he asked. I ... I’ve never seen that person before ...”

Xia ruofei looked at brother Tiger quietly, his face emotionless. He paused for a moment, then said calmly,””Time’s Up. ”

After he finished speaking, Xia ruofei did not hesitate at all. He waved the dagger in his hand and brother Hu’s left index finger was cut off.

“Argh! Ah ...”

Brother Tiger’s body trembled from the pain, and he couldn’t help but let out a heart – wrenching scream.

Xia ruofei did not react to this. He did not even blink. He continued to look at brother Tiger calmly. His expression was the same as before.

“You ... You devil ... Kill me ... Kill me if you have the guts!” Brother Tiger screamed hysterically.

“Time’s Up. ”

Xia ruofei only said these three words calmly. Then, with a steady wave of his hand, he cut off brother Hu’s left middle finger.

“Ah ... You son of a B * tch, kill me if you dare! If you don’t dare to kill me, you’re my grandson!” Brother Tiger gritted his teeth and shouted. The expression on his face was as mournful as the devil ‘s.

He knew that he was already crippled, and his heart had long been disheartened. However, that kind of heart – piercing pain was simply unbearable. The pain spread from the nerve endings to the brain, making him feel so much pain that he wanted to die.

“You’re a man,” Xia ruofei said indifferently.”I’ve decided to leave a few of your fingers behind so that you won’t be unable to take care of yourself in the future.”

Brother Tiger panted heavily and stared at Xia ruofei. In his eyes, Xia ruofei’s delicate face was scarier than a demon ‘s, especially Xia ruofei’s extremely stable tone and the fact that he didn’t have any change in expression in the face of such a bloody scene. It made brother Tiger feel a chill from the bottom of his heart.

The other burly men were so scared that they almost peed their pants. Each and every one of them was as silent as cicadas in winter, not even daring to breathe.

“You’re that kind?” Brother Tiger stared into Xia ruofei’s eyes and said.

“I’ve said it before, my patience is limited. ” Xia ruofei said indifferently,”since I’ve left you with a few fingers, I’ll give you five more seconds. If you still can’t tell me where she is, I’ll ...”

At this point, the dagger in Xia ruofei’s hand began to move down brother Tiger’s lower abdomen slowly and finally stopped between his legs. He said,””You understand? The countdown begins!”

“No... Don’t ... Don’t ...” Brother Tiger started to struggle in vain again.

“Five ... Four ... Three ...” Xia ruofei’s expression was cold.

“Stop! “I’ll tell you ... I’ll tell you ...” Brother Tiger finally had a mental breakdown and cried out in fear.

“You still have two seconds.” Xia ruofei said calmly.
