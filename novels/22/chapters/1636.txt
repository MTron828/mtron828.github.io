Chapter 1637: The powerful Yin formation (2)

He did not dare to look back, but Xia ruofei turned him around forcefully. Song Rui screamed and covered his eyes.

Xia ruofei laughed and pulled his hand away.””Open your eyes! Aren’t you not afraid of anything? A mere illusion can scare you like this?”

Perhaps Xia ruofei’s genuine Qi had expelled the coldness in his body, or perhaps Xia ruofei’s presence had given him some psychological comfort. Song Rui finally gathered his courage and opened his eyes.

There was nothing in front of him, only the quiet lake and the majestic mountain tiger Jade statue in the pit.

The hanging ghosts, starving ghosts, and violent ghosts had all disappeared.

Song Rui rubbed his eyes and said with a lingering fear,””RUO Fei, where are the ghosts?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”what ghost?” It’s all because of psychological factors ... Look carefully, there’s nothing at all, right?”

Song Rui couldn’t help but gather his clothes and said,””What the hell is this thing? It was too strange! RUO Fei, it’s pretty cold here ... Let’s ... Let’s hurry back!”

“Return to what?” Xia ruofei said,”I’m not done yet! If we don’t fill up this hole, won’t we be discovered by people tomorrow morning?”

“Oh ...” Song Rui said.

“Go! Since there’s a beginning, there’s an end to it. Hurry up and fill up the hole!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Song Rui immediately waved his hands and said,””I’m not going! I won’t go! I won’t go even if you beat me to death ... If you want to fill it in, you can fill it in ...”

“Look at your guts!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Song Rui was really scared out of his wits. Even if Xia ruofei laughed at him, he was determined not to take a step closer to the Jade statue.

Xia ruofei shook his head helplessly. He picked up the shovel and walked towards the hole.

Seeing Xia ruofei leave, song Rui couldn’t help but shiver and said,””Hey! RUO Fei ... Don’t leave me behind! I ... I’m here ... I’m scared!”

“Then come with me!” Xia ruofei said helplessly.

Hearing this, song Rui immediately shook his head like a rattle – Drum.

“Then you might as well walk back on your own and look for brother Zhao and Wu Qiang!” Xia ruofei said.

“That’s even more unacceptable!” Song Rui was on the verge of tears.”It was so dark the entire way, I ...”

“You can’t do this, you can’t do that ...” Xia ruofei said.”What should we do?” You can just stay there! I’ll get it done soon! Besides, it’s not far away!”

Song Rui thought about it and felt that this was the only way. He could only say in a trembling voice,””Then hurry up!”

“I know!” Xia ruofei waved his hand without looking back and continued to move forward with the shovel.

In fact, they were only five or six meters away from the hole. However, as soon as Xia ruofei left, song Rui still felt a sense of fear as if a ferocious ghost would jump out of the darkness at any time.

People showed all kinds of emotions when they were afraid. Song Rui kept talking to Xia ruofei as if he could boost his courage.

Xia ruofei responded to song Rui as he filled the soil.

He also thought that he had really scared song Rui tonight. It seemed that he would have to comfort him with spiritual power later, otherwise, it might really leave a psychological shadow.

In a short while, Xia ruofei had filled up the hole. Then, he carefully found some weeds and the surface of the soil to disguise himself. He had cleaned up all the traces of digging.

“Let’s go, let’s go!” Seeing that Xia ruofei had finished the last bit of work, song Rui felt as if he had been pardoned and quickly called out.

The two of them returned to the place where they had parked their car. Wu Qiang and Zhao Yongjun were jogging around the car, rubbing their hands as they ran.

Seeing Xia ruofei return, Zhao Yongjun quickly asked,””RUO Fei, how is it? Was it successful? Why did I hear something just now?”

Song Rui’s scream was so shrill that even Zhao Yongjun and the others could hear it from far away.

Fortunately, it was the middle of the night and they were in the wilderness. Otherwise, they would have been exposed.

Song Rui blushed and interrupted,”let’s talk in the car!” It’s pretty cold here!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Yes, yes, yes!” Zhao Yongjun immediately echoed,”get in the car! Get in the car! What the hell, I’m wearing thick clothes today! Why did the weather suddenly become so cold ...”

Song Rui couldn’t bear to hear the word “ghost” now. He couldn’t help but tremble after hearing Zhao Yongjun’s words. He looked back in the direction of the lake with lingering fear. There seemed to be a Devil’s evil smile in the thick darkness. He quickly turned his head and opened the door with trembling hands. He was the first to get in.

Xia ruofei sat in the front passenger seat and immediately ordered Wu Qiang to start the engine. When the water temperature rose a little, he would immediately turn on the heater.

As he fastened his seat belt, he turned around and asked with a smile,””Brother Zhao, why didn’t you wait in the car? It’s so cold outside ...”

“One must be loyal to others!” Zhao Yongjun laughed and said,”you guys are freezing outside. How can I hide in the car to keep warm? Brothers should face difficulties together!”

“Hey! “There’s no need for that ...”Xia ruofei said.

“By the way, is everything going well on your side?” Zhao Yongjun asked.

Xia ruofei looked at song Rui with a faint smile and said,””Of course it’s going well. Otherwise, why would you guys feel the temperature suddenly drop?”

Zhao Yongjun was surprised and couldn’t help but ask,””You’re saying ... The sudden drop in temperature was caused by people from your side?”

Song Rui couldn’t help but secretly complain, so what if I’m a little colder? What this bro has experienced is what’s called unforgettable!

Although he was secretly scolding Xia ruofei for not being loyal and deliberately not telling him these things in advance, he could not help but admire Xia ruofei.

Only by personally experiencing that terrifying scene could one truly feel the power and wonder of this formation.

Song Rui couldn’t believe that a few pieces of Locust wood, a few coffin nails, a mirror, and yellow joss papers, which were common items in daily life, could achieve such a powerful effect.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”the purpose of this formation is not just to lower the temperature!” It will bring a lot of negative effects. Let’s just wait and see! Something interesting will happen on Liu haofan’s land soon ...”

Zhao Yongjun couldn’t help but shiver and asked in a low voice,””RUO Fei, you’re saying ... That ... Dirty thing will appear?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Strictly speaking, no. But the effect is similar!”

Song Rui had the deepest experience. He immediately realized that Liu haofan’s men and even Liu haofan himself were about to experience the same terrifying scene. Without the help of Xia ruofei, they would probably be scared out of their wits! It was even possible for people with a weaker mental state to be scared to death.

Thinking of this, song Rui’s mood finally improved.

Zhao Yongjun was also very excited,””If that’s the case! Then Liu haofan and the others would be in trouble! Who would dare to buy a haunted piece of land after it’s developed into a real estate?”

“What if they block the news?” Song Rui couldn’t help but ask worriedly.

“The news can’t be sealed!” Xia ruofei said,”as long as this formation exists, all kinds of haunted things will happen. It’s impossible to carry out the construction normally!”

Zhao Yongjun also smiled and said,”Xiao Rui, why did you suddenly become so stupid?” If Liu haofan can block the news, can’t we help him publicize it? You don’t need me to teach you such a simple thing, do you?”

Song Rui realized that he had asked an idiotic question. He smiled awkwardly and said,””Yup! Didn’t that person from Hou Liang’s family control his throat? Wasn’t it easy to find some online media and self – Media to build up momentum for Liu er? Hahaha!”

Zhao Yongjun was still relatively calm. He thought for a while and asked,””Ruofei, what I’m worried about now is ... After this negative news spreads, even if we get the land from Liu haofan at a low price as we wish, these haunted rumors will also have a negative impact on our club’s operations! And ... After what you’ve done to this piece of land, even I feel that it’s a little scary. If we use it to build a club, will it ...”
