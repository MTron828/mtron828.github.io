Chapter 650: Soul puppet Xia Qing (1)

The formation plate components were rather time – consuming, but assembling them wasn’t difficult.

Many of the parts were similar to mortises and tenons found in ancient buildings, but they were all miniature.

Xia ruofei followed the order and position marked in the booklet and quickly put the parts together.

These parts, which were made in strict accordance with the size specified in the booklet, were put together to form an octagonal metal plate.

There were also veined patterns on the metal plate.

The lines on each part were connected together after they were pieced together.

In the middle of the metal plate, there was a circular groove.

Xia ruofei took out the Supreme – grade sheep – Fat white jade that was previously engraved with the core rune. With a clatter, the sheep – Fat white jade was just right on top.

Xia ruofei’s heart was filled with anticipation. He picked up the completed array board and appeared in front of the wordless stone tablet in the new space.

Was this the primordial chaos stone tablet mentioned in the booklet? Xia ruofei was also a little nervous.

He carefully held the formation plate with both hands and slowly approached the stone tablet.

At this moment, a suction force suddenly came from the stone tablet, and the entire formation plate was sucked in.

At the same time, an octagonal groove as big as the array disc appeared on the stone tablet’s surface. The array disc was directly inserted into the groove by suction.

......

Before Xia ruofei could react, light spots started to appear on the array board. These light spots moved along the lines on the array board at high speed and formed streams of light.

More and more light spots appeared, and they slowly gathered together. The flowing light also became more and more dazzling.

The streams of light shuttled back and forth in the patterns of the array disc, and the dazzling brilliance enveloped the entire array disc in white light.

These streams of light eventually gathered at the sheep – Fat white jade in the center.

The light from the center of the suet white jade was getting brighter and brighter. Xia ruofei could not even open his eyes.

However, he didn’t dare to close his eyes. He kept squinting at the formation plate nervously.

This process lasted for about half a minute, and the white light on the sheep – Fat white jade reached its peak.

Then, something seemed to have exploded. The whole process was very quiet, but Xia ruofei seemed to have heard a “Chi” sound. There was an invisible fluctuation, and white fog appeared in front of the stone tablet.

The White mist did not dissipate, but instead gathered together.

The White mist grew more and more, and finally formed a ball of mist. There were vague shadows inside, and it was very unreal.

Xia ruofei was confused. ‘A cloud of white mist?’

Could this guy be a spiritual puppet?

Wasn’t this a far cry from the image he had imagined?

Moreover, how was he supposed to use this thing?

From the time he had obtained the spirit painting scroll until now, Xia ruofei had spent the most effort on the spiritual puppet. His anticipation was the strongest, so he was a little worried about his gains and losses.

The cloud of white mist was extremely condensed. It hovered steadily above the stone tablet and then stopped moving.

Xia ruofei looked at it suspiciously for a long time. Then, he tried to release his spiritual power to approach the White mist.

He felt that the White mist had a strong penetrative ability, and his spiritual power entered the White mist without any effort.

Then, Xia ruofei “saw” the scene inside the White fog. Of course, it was not very real, as if it was covered by a veil.

The interior of the White mist seemed to be an independent space, and in this space, there was a human – shaped object that was motionless.

Xia ruofei suddenly had an epiphany because this was very similar to the situation when he was exploring the spirit map space in the outside world.

He quickly extended his mental power and wrapped it around the human – shaped object. Then, with a thought, he took things out of the space like he usually did.

As expected, the next moment, a person appeared in front of Xia ruofei.

Yes, it was a person!

The man was wearing a long green robe. He had a thin face and high cheekbones. His hair was in an ancient bun and he had a small mustache.

Xia ruofei was shocked and took a step back subconsciously.

He didn’t even notice that the White mist was quickly dissipating.

It had been a long time since he had obtained the spirit map space, but there had never been a human other than Xia ruofei in it. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Sometimes, Xia ruofei would wonder how he would deal with the situation if there was a new owner of the realm after the realm was upgraded.

Ever since he had the spirit map, Xia ruofei had unknowingly gained countless benefits. There was no doubt that he was very dependent on the spirit map space. Subconsciously, he had already regarded the space as his private property and regarded the existence of the spirit map as his top secret. He did not even tell his closest people about it.

Now that the middle – aged man in green had suddenly appeared in the space, Xia ruofei could not help but be shocked.

However, he soon realized that the man was like a puppet. Although his eyes were open, he stood still next to the stone tablet.

Xia ruofei waved his hand in front of the man in green and said,””Hello ...”

“Hello……”

“Hi……”

The man in Green’s eyes were listless as he stared straight ahead. No matter how Xia ruofei waved his hand, he did not even blink.

Xia ruofei said to himself,”is this a soul puppet?” Isn’t this too real? It’ll scare me to death ...”

He mustered his courage and took a closer look. He couldn’t tell that it was a lifeless dummy. Its hair, eyes, beard, and even every pore looked like a real person.
