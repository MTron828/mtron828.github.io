Chapter 489: Chapter 398 – rarely seen in my life (1)

The lean man who was driving couldn’t help but remind him,””Brother Bao, if you leave the city from here, it’s the opposite direction from Green Bull County ...”

“If we don’t get rid of the tail, are we going to take him to Green Bull resort?” said the bald Man, Black Panther.

“But ... Young master Liang said that within an hour ...”

Heibao said impatiently,”I’ll talk to Liang Shao, you don’t need to worry about it!” Change course immediately!”

The monkey no longer hesitated and immediately said,””Yes! Brother Bao!”

He knew that Black Panther’s position in front of young master Liang was very high, and their relationship wasn’t just an employer – employee relationship. The proud black Panther wouldn’t be as timid in front of young master Liang as they were. The reason was simple – Black Panther was extremely strong.

As far as monkey knew, Black Panther was the kind of person who had really learned Kung Fu. It was said that he had a very impressive master background, and was definitely not the kind of showy martial arts seen on television.

Monkey didn’t know the specific background of the Black Panther, but he had seen with his own eyes that the Black Panther had broken a wooden stake as thick as a large Ocean Bowl with a kick. Moreover, it had done so with great ease, clearly not using its full strength.

Before that, the monkey had never seen a human being able to unleash such a powerful killing force with just their physical body. Naturally, he was both respectful and fearful of the Black Panther.

Besides, Liang Haiming was usually very polite to Black Panther. He never ordered him around like he did to his other subordinates. He even talked to Black Panther in a negotiating tone.

From monkey’s point of view, Black Panther’s position in the Liang family was similar to that of a guest in a martial arts novel, extremely aloof.

Therefore, since Black Panther had given the order, he immediately carried it out without any hesitation.

Anyway, Heibao would talk to Liang Haiming, so the punishment wouldn’t hit him even if he delayed the time.

“Houzi,” Heibao said indifferently,”pay attention to controlling the speed of the car, don’t let him overtake you, and at the same time make sure you don’t lose him.”

Monkey was an expert at racing. After hearing Black Panther’s words, he immediately said with confidence,”Alright! Brother Bao, just wait and see!”

As soon as monkey finished speaking, an intersection appeared in front of them. He suddenly turned the steering wheel, and the van turned left at a high speed under the yellow light. The tail of the van even drifted slightly.

When Xia ruofei drove the pickup truck to the intersection, it was already a red light. However, at this time, he did not care about the red light and directly changed the direction. The pickup truck also made a sharp left turn, causing the drivers of the green light to be frightened. They could not help but honk and curse again.

In the SUV, monkey was focused on driving with an excited look.

However, a burly Man in Black sitting in the middle row asked curiously,””Brother Bao, are you trying to lure him out of the city?”

Heibao nodded lightly and said,””If I didn’t remember the license plate wrong, the kid who owns the farm should be in the car behind. Young master Liang wants to deal with him. Since we’ve met, let’s take care of him together!”

The middle – aged man beside Liang Haiming had only arranged for people to keep an eye on the farm. They knew that Xia ruofei had left the farm, but they did not know where he had gone after that. Hence, Heibao only confirmed that the person in the car behind was the person Liang Haiming hated to the core after Xia ruofei’s car had caught up.

As monkey drove, he said with some doubt,””Brother Bao, this kid might not be easy to deal with. Even Zhao he failed yesterday ...”

Black Panther twitched his mouth and said with a disdainful expression: “Zhao he? I can deal with ten of those wild people with one hand! You guys don’t need to worry about it. Just lure this kid out of the city and leave the rest to me. ”

“Yes! Brother Bao!”

In the pickup truck.

Xia ruofei’s face was filled with anxiety.

Judging from the route of the commercial vehicle in front of them, they should be running out of the city. In fact, they had already passed the most congested road, and there were fewer cars on the road than before.

Correspondingly, the speed of the two cars also slowly increased, and they were no longer stuck in the traffic.

In this way, the inherent shortcomings of the pickup truck were revealed. The acceleration performance of a vehicle like the Kasaya was definitely not as good as that of the luxury business car in front.

Xia ruofei was starting to regret not driving the Knight XV out. It was too eye – catching, so Xia ruofei had decided to drive the pickup truck after some hesitation.

Of course, everything had its pros and cons. If Xia ruofei was driving the Knight XV, it would be a huge obstacle in the traffic jam. No matter how powerful it was, it would not be able to exert its advantage. Instead, it might lose track of Xia ruofei because it could not overtake the slow cars on the road.

Now, Xia ruofei could only rely on his extraordinary driving skills to make up for the lack of performance.

Xia ruofei had used his turning skills to the maximum. In addition, the driver, monkey, did not use his full strength on purpose. Hence, the distance between the two cars did not widen.

The traffic was getting sparser and sparser. Soon, both cars whizzed past the min River Bridge and were getting further and further away from the center Urban area.

Under the instructions of Heibao, houzi drove towards Baofeng mountain after leaving the Urban area.

Baofeng mountain was not far from the three mountains Urban area. Although the mountain road was steep and full of curves, the road conditions were very good, which was more advantageous for commercial vehicles with lower chassis.

Most importantly, there was very little traffic at night. It was obvious that Heibao wanted to get rid of Xia ruofei on Baofeng mountain.

Because this direction was in the opposite direction of Green Bull County, Heibao wanted to end the battle quickly and rush back to green Bull holiday villa to take a walk. After all, Liang Haiming had already given the word that he would see Ling Qingxue within an hour. Although Heibao’s status was extraordinary, it would be embarrassing for everyone if he rushed back too late.

Xia ruofei, who was in the car behind, had no choice but to follow closely behind the car in front.

Although he used the turns to keep closing the distance, once they were on a straight road, the difference in power performance between the two cars would widen the distance again.

Just like that, the two cars rushed up the mountain road of Baofeng mountain one after another.

On the winding mountain road, Xia ruofei finally had room to display his driving skills. Houzi’s expression started to turn serious as he realized that the broken – down pickup truck was getting closer and closer. No matter how hard he tried, he could not get rid of the pickup truck.

If he hadn’t tried his best to use the terrain to block, the pickup would have already passed him.

Of course, Xia ruofei was also cautious. After all, Ling Qingxue was also in the car. Otherwise, he would have at least two chances to block the inner Lane and directly push the van down the cliff.

In the SUV, the Black Panther gently pinched his fingers, and his joints made a crackling sound. He saw a small fork in the road ahead. Weeds had already grown on the road, and under the light of the car, he could only vaguely see two rutted tracks.

Obviously, this was an abandoned old road.

Heibao pointed to that fork and said indifferently: “Houzi, stop the car after driving in for one or two hundred meters!”

“Yes! Brother Bao!” The monkey responded loudly. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Xia ruofei’s pickup truck was full of aggression after entering the mountains. Monkey was sweating profusely. He heaved a sigh of relief after hearing Heibao’s words.

Houzi had been driving for many years and had rarely been forced into such a tight corner. Although they were on opposing sides, he still had a faint sense of admiration for Xia ruofei.

The van quickly turned into the abandoned old road. The two ruts were a little deep, and the chassis of the car would be hit by the gravel splashed by the tires from time to time, making a series of cracking sounds. But monkey didn’t care. He followed Heibao’s instructions and drove for about a hundred meters. After a turn, he drove a little further and stopped the car on the inside.

Houzi was a little nervous and on guard. The car remained in gear so that if Xia ruofei crashed into him, he could react quickly.

However, his worries were unnecessary. Xia ruofei did not do so many times on the mountain road. Now that the van had stopped, he naturally would not bump into Ling Qingxue in the van. He would definitely be cautious.

When Xia ruofei saw that the black MPV had stopped, he immediately stepped on the brakes and stopped the pickup truck ten meters away from the MPV.

At this moment, Xia ruofei saw the front passenger door of the business car open. The bald Man, Black Panther, stepped out of the car.

Xia ruofei’s eyes shot out a cold light. He pushed the door open and got out of the car with a dark expression.

The moment Xia ruofei saw the Black Panther, he had a feeling of extreme danger. This feeling was several times more dangerous than when he saw Zhao he yesterday.

In fact, Zhao he only had a murderous aura. His skills did not pose any threat to Xia ruofei.

However, Xia ruofei’s instincts told him that the Black Panther was not an easy opponent to deal with.

After Xia ruofei had obtained the spirit map space, his physical fitness had been constantly improving. Especially after he had the body tempering soup, the strengthening was like driving on the fast track. It could be said that the current Xia ruofei was several times stronger than when he was at his strongest in the Special Forces.

Even so, the Black Panther still gave Xia ruofei an instinctive sense of danger. This meant that the Black Panther’s skills were far beyond the enemies that Xia ruofei had encountered before.

Xia ruofei did not back down in the face of a strong enemy.

The iron and blood military career had given Xia ruofei the tenacity to be strong and face difficulties head – on. Moreover, Ling Qingxue was still in the hands of the other party. Xia ruofei had no way out. Even if there was a mountain of knives and a sea of fire in front of him, he would definitely charge through it without blinking.

Heibao’s eyes narrowed when Xia ruofei got out of the car.

Naturally, he had read Xia ruofei’s information. After confirming that he had found the right person, Heibao did not waste any time. He clenched his fists and walked towards Xia ruofei.

The Black Panther did not walk very fast, but with every step it took, its aura seemed to grow.

An ordinary enemy would have been frightened by such a powerful aura.

However, Xia ruofei’s gaze was firm. He did not show any signs of cowardice. Instead, he walked towards the Black Panther.

He wasn’t very fast either, but each step he took was extremely firm.

When they were about five to six meters away from each other, the two of them seemed to have a tacit understanding. Their speed suddenly increased, and they shot toward each other at the same time ...
