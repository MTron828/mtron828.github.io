2088 Dividends_1

Xia ruofei was stunned and asked,”what’s wrong?” Although the real estate market was not doing well now, it was still quite good to buy and live in it! And the price of the house has also dropped a little, so this is the perfect time to sell!”

Feng Rao was in a dilemma. On the one hand, she enjoyed Xia ruofei’s genuine concern. On the other hand, she was not used to living in the same neighborhood as Ling Qingxue, so she was a little absent – minded for a while.

Seeing that Feng Jing was silent, Xia ruofei thought to himself,”could it be that sister Jing has some difficulties?” He thought for a moment, then patted his forehead and said with a smile,””Look at my brain! Sister che, I know. Is it because you don’t have enough funds?”

With the current housing prices in San Shan city, a villa in a better location, even if it was a townhouse, would cost more than a few million. If it was a standalone villa, it would cost at least ten million.

Although Feng Jing’s salary at paradise Corporation was high, she had only worked for slightly more than a year, and the company didn’t give her any dividends. Her 2% shares were just in name, and it didn’t bring her any substantial income. If she wanted to buy a villa, it would be difficult to pay the down payment even if she applied for a loan.

Xia ruofei saw that Feng Jing wanted to say something but hesitated. He assumed that Feng Jing did not have enough money and was too embarrassed to ask for it, so she rejected him.

Feng Rao was still in a dilemma. When she heard Xia ruofei’s words, she immediately said,””Yup! I don’t have much savings, and it’s a bit hard to buy a villa ... I’ll think about it later! It’s quite convenient to live in the company’s house now!”

Feng Jing thought that this was the end of the matter and was a little disappointed. After all, she was looking forward to living in the same neighborhood as Xia ruofei.

To Feng Jing’s surprise, Xia ruofei replied in a relaxed manner,””Not enough money? It was simple! It just so happens that you haven’t received any dividends yet, so why don’t I take this opportunity to withdraw some for you first?”

“Ah?” Feng Rao was taken aback.

“Wait!” Xia ruofei laughed.

Then, he picked up the phone on the table and dialed the internal number of pang Hao’s office. He said,””Director pang, I’m Xia ruofei. Come to my office for a moment ... Yes, right now!”

Xia ruofei would only address pang Hao by his nickname “fatty” in private. In the company, he was formally addressed as “director pang”.

Feng Rao finally reacted and quickly said,”RUO Fei, no need, no need! I’m not short of money now, so it doesn’t matter when I buy a house! I don’t need it that urgently!”

“What do you mean no need? Didn’t I tell you? This time, let’s go look at the houses together. It’ll be great if we can all live in the same neighborhood!” Xia ruofei said,”it’s decided then! You have to listen to me this time!”

Feng Rao opened her mouth but didn’t say anything when she saw Xia ruofei’s firm attitude.

In a short while, pang Hao arrived at Xia ruofei’s office.

He greeted Feng Jing with a smile,””Boss Feng is here too!”

Then, pang Hao turned to look at Xia ruofei and asked with a smile,””Chairman, you’ve called me here in such a hurry. Do you have any important instructions?” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Director pang, is there enough money in the company’s account?” Xia ruofei asked.

“That’s plenty!” Pang Hao said,”our company’s cash flow is sufficient to begin with. This time, we’ve also received a large sum of bank loans. The initial investment for the project was not that much at all. There are several hundred million Yuan on the book now!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”that’s good!” Director pang, go and make a list to withdraw 10 million Yuan of dividends for President Feng. We’re a little tight on time in the afternoon, so go to the bank tomorrow and get it done as soon as you start work!”

“Ten million dividends?” Pang Hao was stunned for a moment.

“Is there a problem?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Oh! No, I didn ‘t!” “Chairman,” pang Hao said hurriedly.”Then what about you ...”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment before he reacted. He waved his hand and said,”I don’t need it, I’m just doing CEO Feng’s dividend orders! I’ll just record it when I’m doing the accounts. I’ll wait until the company has accumulated more funds to talk about my dividends!”

Feng Jing only had two percent of the company’s shares. According to the ratio, she would get ten million, which meant that Xia ruofei would get four hundred and ninety million. If they were to follow this ratio, even if they did not empty out the company’s books, they would at least be unable to make ends meet. This was what pang Hao had been worried about.

Now that Xia ruofei was not short of money and had no need to spend a large sum of money, there was no need to withdraw the bonus.

Of course, although 98% of the company’s shares were controlled by Xia ruofei, the company’s money was the company’s money, and personal money was personal money. They could not be mixed together. Of course, there would be no problem as long as the accounts were clear.

“Understood!” Pang Hao heaved a sigh of relief and said,”I’ll get it done immediately! President Feng, I’ll have to trouble you to sign this later. ”

“I’ll go with you,”Feng Rao said. In case you run back and forth!”

Then, she turned to Xia ruofei and said,”Chairman, thank you!” Then I’ll head over first!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”You’re welcome. That’s your bonus anyway.” I’ll give you a call after I’ve made the arrangements!”

As pang Hao was present, Xia ruofei did not mention the house but brought it up vaguely.
