The regular detoxification treatment was not effective, and the four people were immediately sent back to Beijing for a comprehensive examination at the 301 Hospital.

The strange thing was that a thorough examination could not detect any known poison in their bodies, but their body’s reaction was that they were clearly poisoned.

The poison didn’t seem to be particularly violent, but it was slowly eroding the patient’s body at all times.

After receiving the news, all the archaeological activities in the front stopped and the main burial chamber was re – closed.

The unknown was the scariest. Even the government was worried that the poison would leak out and cause a large – scale poisoning, which might lead to a disaster.

Luckily, other than Song Wei and the other three, the rest of the people did not show any signs of poisoning.

Of the four people who were affected, Song Wei’s condition was the lightest. She was almost the same as a healthy person, but the symptoms were still present. Song Wei could clearly feel that she would have intermittent dizziness, similar to anemia.

The other three were in a worse state than Song Wei.

They were all in different degrees of unconsciousness, and the most terrifying thing was that this kind of unconsciousness came without any warning. Maybe they were fine a moment ago, but suddenly, their vision went black and they fainted.

The one with the most serious symptoms was a middle – aged expert from the History Museum. He was only 34 or 35 years old. After he returned to Beijing for treatment, there was no effect. He fell into a coma and never woke up again.

Even 301 Hospital, which had top medical equipment and the best experts, could not do anything. They could only watch as the vital signs of the young expert, who was transferred to the intensive care unit, weakened day by day, and finally died.

The other two archeologists also fell unconscious frequently, and their condition was getting worse.

The scariest thing was that so far, the doctors had not found an effective response. They had not even found the poison that had caused them to faint.

All the test reports showed that they were completely healthy.

After song Qiming heard the news, he quickly used all his connections and even invited experts from abroad to check and treat Song Wei.

However, it still had no effect.

Three months ago, there was news from Beijing that one of the two male team members had fallen into a deep coma. His symptoms were exactly the same as the young expert from the History Museum who had passed away.

There was also a male team member who was fainting more frequently than before.

Song Qiming was also anxious because Song Wei was also starting to lose consciousness.

Two months ago, Song Wei started to show signs of fainting for the first time.

At that time, Song Wei had already applied for a long leave of absence from school. She had returned to the southwest province where song Qiming was working to try Chinese medicine.

One day, during breakfast, Song Wei suddenly fainted beside the dining table without any warning. Song Qiming and his wife were shocked.

After about five minutes, Song Wei woke up again. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

She had no memory of the entire process of fainting. She only felt that her vision seemed to turn black, and her consciousness fell into a deep sleep. When she woke up again, it would be five minutes later.

In the past two months, Song Wei had fainted five times.

And the frequency was obviously increasing, because the last three comas were concentrated in this month, and he would faint almost once a week without any warning.

Her condition had obviously worsened.

Song Qiming and his wife only had one precious daughter. When they saw their daughter’s condition, they were naturally distressed and anxious.

After he was transferred to Sanshan city, he immediately brought his wife and daughter to Sanshan. Through the song family’s connections, he found a Chinese medicine master to treat Song Wei’s Western medicine methods. They had almost no hope.

It was because of this Chinese medical Master from Beijing that the newly appointed song Qiming had to suspend his research activities and personally go home to receive him.

However, the situation was similar to the previous few times. After the well – known Chinese medicine master took Song Wei’s pulse, he did not have any good solution. He felt that it might be a coma caused by the reverse flow of liver Qi, which was similar to the judgment of the famous Chinese medicine doctors that song Qiming had seen before.

Even the prescription given by this Chinese medicine master was similar to that of the previous famous doctors.

Song Qiming was quite disappointed. After politely sending the Chinese medicine master off, he thought of the scene in elder song’s study that night.

Elder song knew about Song Wei’s situation. At that time, elder song said to song Qiming in a meaningful way,””Qiming, if there’s really no other way to deal with your Weiwei’s situation, why don’t you go and look for Xiao Xia?”

“Little Xia?” Song Qiming was very surprised.

“If little Xia is willing to help, we might be able to turn the situation around,” said elder song with a nod. But remember, if you can treat him through normal means, don’t bother Xiao Xia. He doesn’t like to be disturbed. ”

Song Qiming was stunned for a moment before he nodded and said,””I’ll remember that, chief. ”

Elder song then said with deep meaning,”Qiming! Xiao Xia is a strange person. Don’t simply think of him as a young man who has a close relationship with this old man. It’ll be of great benefit to you to be on good terms with him ...”

“Yes, sir. I’ll keep that in mind,” song Qiming said seriously.

Song Qiming valued Xia ruofei so much because of elder song’s advice.

When the famous Chinese medicine master couldn’t find a better way to treat Song Wei’s condition, song Qiming finally remembered elder song’s words.

He thought for a while and finally gave Xia ruofei a call.

After listening to Song Wei’s situation, Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said,””Secretary song, before I see the patient, I can’t make any judgment ... How about this, I drank a lot today and it’s not convenient for me to come over now. Why don’t I come over tomorrow or the day after to see the patient first?”

Although Song Wei’s condition was strange and dangerous, it was not very critical. Now, other than a young expert from the History Museum who was the first to die, another archeologist was in a deep coma. The other male team member was not too serious, but the frequency of fainting was much higher than Song Wei ‘S. He would faint almost once a day.

Therefore, Song Wei’s life should not be in danger in the short term.

“Sure, sure, sure, ruofei!” Song Qiming quickly replied. I’ll have to trouble you to come over tomorrow. I’ll send a driver to pick you up. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”no need, no need. It’s more convenient for me to drive.” Secretary song, let’s set the time at 10 am tomorrow!”

“Alright, alright!” ” Thank you, ruofei! ” Song Qiming said.

“You’re welcome,” Xia ruofei smiled.

Song Qiming heaved a sigh of relief after he hung up the phone. He still could not imagine how Xia ruofei would turn the situation around if even the old Chinese medical doctors could not do anything about this difficult disease.

However, he believed in elder song’s words. He knew that elder song would not say anything without reason. Since the old general admired Xia ruofei so much, he must have a reason.

Xia ruofei kept his phone and returned to the room.

Guangzhi Cao asked impatiently, ” “Ruofei, what instructions does the Secretary have? ”

Xia ruofei had mentioned him on the phone, so Guangzhi Cao was concerned about Secretary song’s attitude.

Xia ruofei laughed. ” Secretary song has instructed me to have a few drinks with you. He also wants me to test your alcohol tolerance! ”

“Ah? ” Guangzhi Cao couldn’t help but say with a bitter face, ” no way? ”

Although he had a sad expression on his face, he was actually overjoyed. The more casual Secretary song’s tone was, the more he treated him as one of them!

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”why not?” These were Secretary song’s exact words! District head he, the Secretary has already given us instructions. This time, we can form an offensive and defensive alliance, right?”

He Feng also laughed and said,”of course!” We’re drinking by imperial decree! Come on, director Cao, I’ll follow the Secretary’s instructions and give you a big toast!”
