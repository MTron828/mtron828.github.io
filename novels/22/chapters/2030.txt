2031 A huge amount of wealth_1

In fact, these kinds of traps and secret rooms that were set up by ordinary means, under the investigation of spiritual power, had almost no secrets to speak of. Xia ruofei had already used his spiritual power to investigate once before entering the building, so it was not surprising that he could find the treasure room.

For old ghelman, it was like a fairy tale.

Even he himself didn’t know that there was such a secret room hidden in the study that he often used.

This Manor had originally belonged to the Moore family. After they took it for themselves, they had checked the house inside out and indeed found a secret room, but it was not on the first floor.

Therefore, when he saw that there was really a secret passage hidden here, he was shocked on one hand, but on the other hand, he was secretly relieved. Perhaps there were things left behind by the Moore family hidden here, but at least some of the Gehrman family’s treasures would not be discovered.

Although he knew that it would be difficult for him to survive today, he didn’t want to let the wealth accumulated by the Gelman family for several generations benefit these Chinese people.

Xia ruofei also noticed old Gelman’s expression. He thought for a while and smiled.””Mr. Gelman, it seems that I have wronged you ... You really didn’t know that there was a secret passage here!”

Old Gelman snorted coldly and did not say anything.

Xia ruofei was still smiling.””I’m also curious! The exit of this secret passage is set so high that it’s not convenient for you to come in and out! How could there be such an anti – Human Design?”

Lu zhengfeng, who was at the side, was already a little impatient. He said,””Sir, it doesn’t matter if this old man knows about this secret passage or not. There must be treasures in such a secret place! Let’s go in and take a look!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand, indicating for him to calm down.

Then, Xia ruofei continued to smile and said to old Gelman,””Mr. Gelman, I forgot to tell you that this secret passage leads to a room on the second floor. The layout of that room is very interesting. It is hidden in the middle of many rooms, and through an ingenious spatial illusion, it makes it impossible for people to notice that there is a place isolated from the rest ...”

The more old Gehrman heard, the more he felt that something was wrong, and a bad feeling grew in his heart.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”That’s right. If I’m wrong, there are two exits to the hidden room. One is here. The other one is ...”

He deliberately paused for a few seconds, then smiled and said,””The other one is behind the big bed in the master bedroom on the second floor! Like the two bookshelves, the heavy bed was designed with a guide track. After pulling the mechanism, it could be easily moved away, revealing the door of the secret room. How was it? Doesn’t it sound familiar?”

Old Gehrman’s eyes widened. Xia ruofei’s smile was like a demon’s smile, making him shudder.

How could he not be familiar with it? That was his treasure room on the second floor!

This treasure room was told to him by the Butler of the Moore family to save his life when he first entered the Moore Manor. At that time, there were many treasures of the Moore family hidden inside. Of course, they had all become his spoils of war.

Old Gehrman loved this secret room very much. After taking the collection of the Moore family for himself, he also put in the treasures that his family had collected for many years.

In the dead of the night, he would often go to the secret room and admire the past. Some of the treasures even came from the Middle Ages, and every one of them fascinated him.

The Butler of the Moore family, who had tried to save his own life, had naturally shut his mouth forever.

It was unknown whether the Butler had not had the time to tell him about the second entrance, or he wanted to keep something up his sleeve. In any case, even old ghelman did not know about the secret passage in the study on the first floor.

Old Gelman thought that after the Butler died, no one would know the secret of the secret room. He didn’t expect that this demon – like Chinese man in front of him could find a secret passage that even he himself didn’t know about.

The thought of the wealth accumulated by generations in the secret room upstairs made old Gehrman’s heart ache. He was like a mad beast, roaring and struggling violently.

The brothers of the Hong sect who were in charge of keeping him in custody didn’t react in time and were directly flipped over by this old man.

However, old Gelman had been tied up and was like a trapped beast. Soon, he was pressed to the ground by the Hong sect brothers who rushed up.

Xia ruofei looked at old Gelman’s Red eyes and did not feel any sympathy for him.

Those who kill will be killed.

According to Xia ruofei’s understanding of lui hai, the number of souls that died directly or indirectly in old Geerman’s hands could fill up the whole Manor. Therefore, there was nothing to sympathize with this old man. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Let’s go! Let’s take Mr. Gehrman and tour the treasure room!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

He walked straight to the front of the wall and pulled at the hole above his head. An exquisite ladder hung down. It was clearly designed.

Xia ruofei climbed up the ladder first, followed by Lyu zhengfeng and Lyu hai. As for the other brothers of the Hong sect, they didn’t follow him, but stayed in the study to guard old Gelman.
