2455 Both of them broke through_Translator: 5496903The two still had an afternoon. If they used the time array flag to create a time flow difference of 90 times, they could cultivate for at least ten days inside. Excluding rest, food, water, and toilet, the remaining time should be enough for Song Wei to break through the bottleneck of refined Qi Level 3.

As Xia ruofei pulled Song Wei into the house, she said,”RUO Fei, you’ve just broken through. You must take a rest first! And didn’t you say that it’s best to consolidate your cultivation as soon as possible after breaking through? I’m not in a hurry to cultivate, so I don’t want to delay you from consolidating your cultivation!”

Xia ruofei laughed,”silly girl!” Of course, I’ll only stop cultivating after I’ve consolidated my cultivation! Furthermore, wouldn’t cultivating the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” also help me to further consolidate my cultivation? As for rest ... Hehe! I feel like I can kill a bull by blowing on it! I don’t need to rest!”

Song Wei was stunned for a moment, then she giggled.”Killing a bull by blowing on it ... Isn’t this the legendary ‘bragging’? Hahaha ...”

Song Wei was so happy that she couldn’t stand up straight. Xia ruofei “flew into a rage” out of embarrassment and reached out to scratch Song Wei’s waist.”You actually dare to laugh at me! It seems that I have to enforce the Family Law! Otherwise, you won’t be able to keep your dignity!”

Song Wei was so scared that she giggled and hid far away, begging for mercy,””Don’t come any closer ... Ruofei, I’m most afraid of tickles! I was wrong, alright?”

Xia ruofei laughed evilly and pounced on Song Wei. Just as Song Wei was about to move around the sofa to avoid him, she felt an invisible force restraining her.

As a Qi Level 3 cultivator, Song Wei naturally knew that Xia ruofei had used his spiritual power. She couldn’t help but exclaim,”Hey! How can you go back on your word!”

Xia ruofei grabbed Song Wei and laughed,”How can you call that cheating? You’re clearly the one who’s inferior! Tell me, do you still dare to make fun of me in the future?”

Song Wei looked up at Xia ruofei with her big eyes and said,””I won’t dare ... I won’t dare to do it again ...”

Xia ruofei looked at Song Wei’s lovely face and almost couldn’t resist his impulse. He sat down on the sofa awkwardly and said,””I’ll let you off this time!”

Then, Xia ruofei picked up the time array flag on the sofa and said to Song Wei,””Wei Wei, let’s prepare something to eat and prepare to cultivate for a few days in one go!”

Song Wei nodded her head and said,”En!”

“Wait a minute!” Xia ruofei said.

After saying that, he walked into the bedroom and came out with a paper box in a short while. It was filled with instant noodles, compressed biscuits, mineral water, and so on.

These were naturally taken out by Xia ruofei from the spirit map.

“Why did you leave so much food in the bedroom?” Song Wei laughed.

“We don’t have to panic when we have surplus food at home!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Then, he placed the box on the floor of the living room and set up the time formation again.

“Let’s go!”Xia ruofei said. Time is precious, we should start cultivating!”

The two of them walked into the time formation hand in hand and sat down cross – legged.

This time, the two of them quickly entered a state of cultivation.

Xia ruofei could feel that after reaching refined Qi level 9, it would be easier for him to practice the “absolute beginning Scripture” with Song Wei.

Since Xia ruofei’s genuine Qi had improved, the efficiency of their joint cultivation was higher. Not only did Song Wei improve significantly, but Xia ruofei could also feel that his spiritual power and genuine Qi were slowly growing.

Time passed by slowly.

The two of them had been cultivating in the time formation for more than ten hours. Both of them felt a little tired. Xia ruofei then signaled for Song Wei to stop cultivating. They left the time formation to get some food and rest.

Just like that, they continued to cultivate with high efficiency.

In order to save time, Xia ruofei found a blanket from the bedroom. When they needed to rest, they would sleep in each other’s arms in the time formation. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The two of them cultivated in the array for about nine days before Song Wei finally broke through.

Xia ruofei felt that Song Wei had broken through her bottleneck and was slightly happy.

At the same time, he reminded her in a deep voice,”Wei Wei!” Don’t be distracted, continue to focus your energy and circulate the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra”!”

Song Wei didn’t say anything and only nodded slightly.

Xia ruofei’s understanding of the “absolute beginning Scripture” and his control of genuine Qi were better than Song Wei ‘s. Hence, even when Song Wei was in the process of breaking through, he could control his genuine Qi very well and cooperate with her perfectly.

Soon, Song Wei’s breakthrough was completed. Her Energy Center and meridians were strengthened to a certain extent, and her true Qi density increased.

Xia ruofei didn’t stop cultivating. He continued to cultivate the “absolute beginning Scripture” with Song Wei until Song Wei’s cultivation was completely stabilized at refined Qi Level 4. Then, the two of them stopped cultivating.

Song Wei, who had not spoken during the cultivation process, was very excited. She hugged Xia ruofei’s neck and kissed him on the cheek.”RUO Fei! I’ve finally broken through! Thank you!”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”you have to be careful of arrogance and rashness!” Qi refining stage level 4 ... It’s not too powerful among Qi refining cultivators. In fact, even for me, I’ve only just started on the road of cultivation!”

“En!” Song Wei nodded her head.

The two of them walked out of the time formation. Xia ruofei kept the formation flag and threw the blanket on the sofa.

Song Wei sniffed and blushed,”Ruofei, I’m going to take a shower!”

In order to save time, they would leave the time formation at most when they were eating or going to the toilet. They would even sleep in the time formation at other times, so they didn’t have time to take a bath.

It had been nine days since she last took a bath. In addition, when Song Wei was breaking through, her body had discharged a lot of impurities. Naturally, the smell on her body was very strong. To a gentle and understanding beauty, this was absolutely unbearable.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

Song Wei immediately ran out of Xia ruofei’s room and rushed to the guest room.

There was a bathroom in the guest room. Song Wei’s luggage was still in the guest room so she would not shower at Xia ruofei’s place. No matter how smelly she was, she had to at least take a shower there.

Xia ruofei looked at Song Wei’s back as she ‘fled’. He smiled and shook his head. Then, he started to clean up the house.

Although only an afternoon had passed in the outside world, the two of them had actually spent nine days. Now, the house was filled with a lot of plastic containers, empty mineral water bottles, and other trash.

After Xia ruofei cleaned up the house, he went to the bathroom to take a shower.

It was much easier for men to take a bath than for women. When Xia ruofei came out after changing, there was still no movement in Song Wei’s room.

However, the sound of a car came from the backyard.

Xia ruofei’s hearing was very good. He could tell that it was Toyoda’s Elfa.

So he walked to the backyard.

Sure enough, Ling Qingxue had returned from Alphard and was walking towards the courtyard in the middle.

“Qingxue, how’s the preparation for the Taoyuan gathering going?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“There shouldn’t be any problems!” Ling Qingxue said confidently,”for tomorrow’s opening ceremony, our private kitchen will definitely not fail!”

Then, Ling Qingxue looked left and right, then asked in a low voice,””Ruofei, how’s your cultivation going?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”the effect is unexpectedly good.” I’m already at refined Qi level 9, and Wei Wei has also broken through a level and reached refined Qi Level 4!”

In fact, Xia ruofei’s breakthrough was the result of his accumulation during this period of time. He also broke through by relying on the “great Dao Sutra”. The joint cultivation with Song Wei could only be considered as a catalyst.

Ling Qingxue’s eyes widened.””It’s only been an afternoon and I’m already so far behind! No, no, no! I have to cultivate well tonight!”

“I can do it anytime!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’m in an amazing state now!”

Hence, after dinner, Song Wei sensibly left all the time for Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue and went back to her room to rest.

Naturally, Xia ruofei began to bring Ling Qingxue along to continue cultivating the “absolute beginning Scripture”. His goal was very clear, and that was to let Ling Qingxue break through to refined Qi Level 4!
