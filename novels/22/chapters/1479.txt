“Good luck!” Xia ruofei nodded.

He then turned around and walked towards the elevator, ignoring Zhuang Cheng and Yao na, who had mixed feelings in their hearts.

Xia ruofei took the elevator up and arrived at Song Wei’s room.

Everyone was in the small living room of the suite. Because of Cao Jin’s presence, Zhuang Yan and Xu Yuanyuan were a little restrained.

“You’ve settled it?” Song Wei asked with a smile.

“I sent them away,” Xia ruofei nodded.

“Mr. Xia, do you need me to ...” Cao Jin’s eyes flashed.

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.””Forget it. They’re just a few small bureaucrats. There’s nothing to fuss about with them.”

Cao Jin nodded with a smile.

Since Xia ruofei had spoken, he wouldn’t go after these people. However, he still had to teach them a little lesson at the right time.

In Cao Jin’s position, he might not be able to help others, but it was too easy to ruin something.

To give a simple example, when documents were presented, the difference in the order in which the documents were placed could have a huge impact. It was directly related to how much attention song Zhengping paid to the documents.

It was too easy for Cao Jin to deal with the Deputy Director and the Deputy Director of the Qingshui Yamen!

Xia ruofei chatted with Cao Jin and the others for a while with a gentle attitude. Cao Jin also took the initiative to call the director of the city’s cultural Bureau in front of everyone and told him about Xu Yuanyuan.

Normally, it was difficult for bureau chief Zheng Jianming to even talk to Cao Jin. How could he hesitate for such a simple matter? He directly patted his chest and promised that he would get it done immediately. As long as Yuanyuan Xu could get into graduate school, she would be able to enter the school with the permanent staff and enjoy the benefits of tuition reimbursement.

When Xu Yuanyuan heard that her matter was settled so easily, she felt as if she was in a dream. She had gone through a lot of trouble for the postgraduate entrance examination and had even lowered herself to beg Yao na. She had been reprimanded by Yao na, but in the end, there was still no progress.

The young couple quickly expressed their gratitude to Cao Jin. Of course, they did not forget to thank Xia ruofei. They both knew that Cao Jin had only done so much for Xia ruofei’s sake.

Cao Jin sat for a while and then took the initiative to leave.

He had come here today to make friends and try to leave a good impression on Xia ruofei. It seemed that he had exceeded his task.

Cao Jin even wondered if he should thank the two small bureaucrats for this.

Cao Jin knew that Song Wei and Xu Shuyuan had not seen each other for a long time. They must have a lot to talk about, and it was not convenient for them to talk here, so he left.

Xia ruofei personally sent Cao Jin to his room. Cao Jin quickly said,””Mr. Xia, please wait! Stop!”

He did not dare to let Xia ruofei send him down again. He was a guest of honor in Secretary song’s house and he could tell that Secretary song treated him like a junior in his own family. He could not afford to let someone like Xia ruofei send him down personally.

Xia ruofei smiled and said to Cao Jin,””Secretary Cao, thank you for today. Please let uncle song know that we will visit him before we leave xiangnan. During this period, we don’t need to trouble you to protect us. We will just walk around and look around!”

“Yes!” Cao Jin was slightly delighted and quickly agreed.

Xia ruofei had asked him to pass on the message as a compliment. This way, song Zhengping would know that he had visited Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei had also hinted that he would put in a good word for him when he visited song Zhengping next time. This was the biggest surprise for Cao Jin.

After Cao Jin left, Xu Shuyuan and Zhuang Cheng obviously relaxed a lot.

When Xia ruofei returned to the house, Xu Yuanyuan smiled and asked,””Weiwei, what does Secretary Cao do? Even chief Wang and director Jiang are like mice seeing a cat when they see him, and he settled my matter with one phone call!”

A few minutes after Cao Jin finished his call with director Zheng Jianming, Xu Yuanyuan received a call from the director of the cultural relics Bureau. The director, who usually had a serious face, was quite kind. He personally told Xu Yuanyuan that the Bureau would fully support her to further her studies and that she did not need to go to work tomorrow. She could focus on studying and preparing for the exam at home. Of course, she would still be paid.

Xia ruofei smiled.”You already know that he’s Secretary Cao. Of course, he’s a Secretary!”

“A Secretary has so much power?” asked Xu Yuanyuan. Don’t tell me he’s the Secretary of the provincial Party secretary song!”

Xia ruofei shrugged.”That’s a pretty accurate guess.”

Shu Yuan Yuan couldn’t help but widen her eyes and said,””Xia ruofei, you’re not joking, right?”

Then, she looked at Song Wei and saw her nodding with a smile. She muttered,””It really is Secretary song’s Secretary! No wonder ...”

Then, Shu Yuan Yuan looked at Xia ruofei in shock and said,””So, the uncle song that you were talking to Secretary Cao about at the door ...”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and nodded. Song Wei quickly said,””Yuanyuan, ruofei has some connections with Secretary song’s family. Just keep this to yourself and don’t go around telling others! It’ll have a bad influence ...”

While Song Wei was warning Shu Yuan Yuan, she also cleverly put herself out of the picture. Most of her classmates did not know about her family background, so she did not want to ruin the pure friendship between classmates because of these factors.

Xu Yuanyuan did not suspect anything. She sized Xia ruofei up and said,””Wei Wei, it seems like you’ve got yourself a rich husband! He’s much more capable than our Zhuang Yan!”

Zhuang Yan chuckled and looked at Xu Yuan Yuan lovingly, not angry at all.

Song Wei, on the other hand, blushed and said in a low voice,”A dog’s mouth can’t spit out ivory! We’re not in that kind of relationship ...”

“I know, I know!” Xu Yuanyuan smiled and said,”you even booked two rooms! It’s such a waste to spend so much money to book a room and sit there all night ...”

Song Wei’s face darkened, and she could not explain herself.

Xu Yuanyuan continued to smile,”why don’t you just give one room to Zhuang Yan and me?” You guys won’t be using it anyway, we haven’t experienced the luxury suite of a five – Star hotel!”

“You little girl, how dare you say anything!” Song Wei said coyly.

“I’m a married woman now!” Xu Yuan Yuan said with a smile.

Xia ruofei, who was standing at the side, couldn’t hold on any longer. He quickly said,””Zhuang Yan, let’s go to my room! They haven’t seen each other for a long time, so they must have a lot to talk about. Let’s not disturb them ...”

Out of habit, Zhuang Yan looked at Xu Yuanyuan for her opinion. After seeing Xu Yuanyuan nod, he stood up.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. Zhuang Yan was also a strong man, but unfortunately, he was a henpecked husband ...

Xia ruofei left some space for his best friend and classmate and brought Zhuang Yan to his room.

Xia ruofei gave Zhuang Yan a cigarette and the two of them sat in the guest room of the suite and chatted.

Zhuang Yan was quite addicted to smoking as well. Because there was a lady around just now, he had a hard time holding it in.

The cigarette could quickly shorten the distance between the two of them. Even Zhuang Yan, who was a little quiet, was no longer so restrained.

“Brother Xia, this cigarette of yours is really rich. What brand is it?” Zhuang Yan asked.

“It was given to me by an elder in my family. There’s no tag on it.” Xia ruofei smiled, then opened his bag and rummaged through it. There were still two unopened packs of special cigarettes. He took them out and handed them to Zhuang Yan, saying,”there are only two packs left. If you don’t mind, you can keep them!”

Zhuang Yan didn’t know what this special cigarette was, but as a regular smoker, he could tell that it wasn’t an ordinary one after a few puffs. He smiled and said, “That’s embarrassing. ”

“Just take it! It’s not like it’s worth anything!” Xia ruofei said.

“Then, thank you, brother Xia!” Zhuang Yan put the two packs of cigarettes into his pocket as if he had found a treasure.

Xia ruofei took a puff of his cigarette and asked,””Zhuang Yan, are there any fun places in Xiang Nan Province? Just give me some suggestions!”

Xia ruofei looked like he was chatting, but he actually wanted to find out more about the ancient tomb. After all, Zhuang Yan was part of the cultural relics Bureau. When the archeologists were in danger and someone died, although they had taken into account the panic of society and implemented news control, Zhuang Yan and the others in the system should still know about it.

Hence, Xia ruofei deliberately led the conversation in this direction. He said,””There’s no need to introduce famous historical sites like Yueyang Tower. I like to go to places that aren’t very popular, and it’s best if they’re new and exciting ...”
