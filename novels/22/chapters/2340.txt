2341 Inheritance.A white Buick GL8 MPV was already parked by the roadside outside the private jet building. When Xia ruofei got out of the car, the electric door of the Buick MPV slowly opened and a silver – haired old man stepped out.

This person was Xia ruofei’s senior brother Ge Jun, whom he had acknowledged when he was “accepting disciples” on behalf of his master at the three mountains.

Ge Jun had come to the three mountains to visit a friend. If he had not met song Qiming by chance and acknowledged Xia ruofei as his Junior Brother, he would have returned to the capital a few days ago.

When he heard that Xia ruofei was preparing to go to the capital, Ge Jun quickly decided to go back with him.

Of course, he didn’t know that Xia ruofei was taking a public jet. He only wanted to buy a ticket for the same flight as Xia ruofei, but he didn’t expect Xia ruofei to tell him not to buy a ticket and to meet him directly at the private plane building.

“Junior Brother Xia!” Ge Jun smiled as he welcomed them.

Xia ruofei took the luggage from the car boot and told the veteran driver to return to the city. Then, he smiled at Ge Jun and said,””Senior brother GE, I’m sorry! I’m a little late!”

“Your timing is just right. I was early.” Ge Jun said with a smile.

Professor Chen from the military general Hospital also arrived at the airport with Ge Jun. When he saw Xia ruofei, he also greeted him politely.””Mr. Xia, how are you?”

Professor Chen’s attitude was even a little respectful. Other than Xia ruofei’s seniority, a large part of the reason was that he had been convinced by Xia ruofei’s magical medical skills. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

If it was not for his superior who had told him to keep the process of Xia ruofei’s treatment of song Qiming a secret and not to publicize it, professor Chen would have taken the case out and analyzed it for his colleagues at various academic occasions.

However, the head of the headquarters in Beijing had directly given instructions, so he could only bury this matter in his heart. He also had to repeatedly remind the doctors who had been in contact with this matter and the few graduate students he had brought with him to keep their mouths shut.

“Professor Chen, you’re here to send us off!” Xia ruofei nodded at professor Chen and said.

“Yeah!” Professor Chen said. Uncle GE’s return to the capital this time, they did not know when they would be able to meet! I originally wanted him to stay for a while, but when he heard that you were also going to Beijing, he couldn’t stay any longer!”

Professor Chen said with a bitter smile.

Ge Jun laughed and said,”little Chen, you’ve been staying here for a long time!” If there’s a chance, you can come to the capital to see me!”

An expert like professor Chen had many opportunities to participate in various academic exchanges. In addition, the joint Logistics support force often had various meetings, so he had a lot of opportunities to go to Beijing.

Professor Chen nodded and said,”that’s the only way!” I can’t make you stay!”

Professor Chen couldn’t help but ask,””Mr. Xia, I wonder how Secretary song is recovering?”

Although his superior and the southeast province did not say anything, he knew very well that Xia ruofei must have taken over the follow – up treatment when song Qiming was discharged from the hospital under such circumstances.

Professor Chen was very concerned about this special case, but his superiors did not allow him to interfere too much. It was like a child who saw a toy that he liked but could not hold it. It was like a cat scratching at his heart.

Therefore, when professor Chen saw Xia ruofei, he could not help but ask about song Qiming.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s quite smooth!” I’ve already arranged everything. There’s no point in staying at the three mountains. I still have some things to settle in Beijing, so I’ll be leaving the three mountains early this time. ”

The few of them talked in front of the private jet building for a while, then Xia ruofei said,””Senior brother GE, I think it’s about time. Let’s go in!”

“Alright!” Ge Jun smiled.”Xiao Chen, you can stop here!” I’ll see you next time in Beijing!”

“Okay, uncle GE!” Professor Chen said respectfully,”I wish you a safe journey!”

Xia ruofei and Ge Jun waved at professor Chen and walked into the private plane building together.

In a short while, Xia ruofei and Ge Jun arrived at the tarmac.

Looking at the bright peach source under the sun, Ge Jun could not help but sigh,””I knew that junior Xia’s career was very successful, but I didn’t expect you to even have a private jet. I’m so lucky to have you this time!”

Xia ruofei said humbly,”this plane is not actually mine. Strictly speaking, it’s my friend’s property. It’s just that I use it most of the time.”

The two of them spoke as they stepped up the ramp and stepped into the cabin.

Ge Jun was someone who had seen the world. He had even accompanied the leaders on trips as a medical expert. He had even sat on China’s “Air Force One” before, so he was not too surprised when he saw the luxurious furnishings in the cabin.

Of course, China did not have the so – called Air Force One. In fact, the leaders ‘private planes were usually used for Civil Aviation flights. Only when there was a visit Mission would they undergo internal modifications in advance, and then the Air Force private jet division’s senior pilots would be responsible for the flight.

The weather in the three mountains was quite good today. The sky was clear and the traffic at the airport was still normal, so the plane was allowed to exit not long after the two boarded the plane.

The Gulfstream business jet quickly left the parking lot and slowly taxied all the way to the runway.
