Chapter 3659: Preparing for a rainy day (1)

“Good! Then it’s a deal!” Chen Xuan laughed heartily.

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei could not help but think.

Chen Nanfeng’s breakthrough to the nascent Soul Stage was not a good thing or a bad thing for him.

After returning from the mystic Luna realm, although Xia ruofei was not invincible in the cultivation world on earth, he had no problem in protecting himself. Even if he were to face Chen Nanfeng, who was in the late golden elixir realm, he was confident that he could escape unscathed.

However, once Chen Nanfeng broke through to the nascent Soul Stage, it would be completely different. The suppression of a large realm was no joke.

Although Xia ruofei had never fought with a true nascent Soul Stage cultivator, he knew very well that if Chen Nanfeng became an early – Stage nascent soul cultivator, he would definitely be able to sweep across the entire cultivation world, including himself. Even with a Dharma Treasure like the black Phoenix flying ship, it would still be very dangerous.

Furthermore, Xia ruofei had personally killed the mid – Stage golden core elder of the first heaven society, Shen tianfang. Although he felt that he had done it flawlessly, there was always a possibility.

If the first heaven society had already noticed some clues and even suspected Xia ruofei, then he would be walking right into a trap if he went to the first heaven society to observe Chen Nanfeng’s breakthrough.

Moreover, Chen Nanfeng’s attitude towards Xia ruofei had never been clear. This was the first time Xia ruofei had met Chen Nanfeng in the first heaven society. He even had a faint sense of danger, so every time he faced Chen Nanfeng, he would be a little afraid.

However, when he was talking to Chen Xuan, Xia ruofei had already thought it through. He had to go to the first heaven society this time. There was no way he could escape.

Since that was the case, there was no need for him to hesitate any longer. Otherwise, even Chen Xuan would be suspicious.

What Xia ruofei had to do was to make full preparations. When he reached the first heaven society, he had to be on his guard at all times and escape decisively when the situation turned bad.

With the black Phoenix flying ship around, if Xia ruofei were to suddenly escape, even if Chen Nanfeng had already reached the nascent Soul Stage, he might not be able to catch up. Once the black Phoenix flying ship picked up speed, it would be difficult for Chen Nanfeng to catch up.

As long as Xia ruofei could Return to Paradise Island, she would be completely safe.

With the defensive power of the island’s protective formation, even early nascent soul cultivators would find it almost impossible to break through.

Moreover, in the vast ocean, it was unlikely that Chen Nanfeng would be able to find the Peach Blossom Island where Xia ruofei was hiding.

Xia ruofei sat quietly in the living room, repeatedly thinking about the possible situations that he might encounter in the first heaven society. He was also simulating the response plan in his mind.

In addition, he also counted some of his trump cards.

The black Phoenix flying ship was naturally an escape divine weapon and also one of Xia ruofei’s trump cards.

In addition, he also had the blue immortal sword and the crooked Frost Flying sword. When he used them unexpectedly, they could also produce amazing results.

Xia ruofei had also mastered many formations and carved many talismans. These talismans had a variety of functions. At a critical moment, one talisman might be able to produce unexpected effects.

Of course, Xia ruofei’s biggest trump card was still the spirit painting.

If he couldn’t even escape on the black Phoenix flying ship, he could still hide in the spirit map space as a last resort.

Of course, the prerequisite was that he had to hide the spirit map scroll well in advance. Otherwise, if the other party found the spirit map scroll, even if the other party could not break it, he would be trapped in the space and unable to come out.

At the same time, Xia ruofei also anticipated all the possible situations. His purpose was naturally to deal with them calmly when he was in the first heaven society, especially when it came to Shen tianfang. He would not give himself away.

Xia ruofei just sat in the living room. His brain was working at a high speed, so naturally, he had no other thoughts. He didn’t even notice that Song Wei and Ling Qingxue had left the room.

“RUO Fei, why are you in a daze?” Ling Qingxue smiled and asked,”RUO Fei! RUO Fei!”

Xia ruofei only came back to his senses after Ling Qingxue called him a few times.

“All?” Xia ruofei looked at Song Wei and Ling Qingxue and said,”you guys are done with your cultivation!”

“Yup!” Ling Qingxue said,”Weiwei just finished cultivating. I’ve been out for a few minutes, but you’ve been sitting there like a statue. What are you so engrossed in?”

“Oh … I was thinking about a problem in cultivation just now. 1 might have been too engrossed in it, so I didn’t notice you guys coming out.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Ah? Then … Will we interrupt your thoughts?” Song Wei quickly asked. Then, she looked at Ling Qingxue and said,”Qingxue, 1 told you not to disturb RUO Fei! You just won’t listen …”

Ling Qingxue was like a child who had done something wrong. She lowered her head and said,””I didn’t know it was like this … RUO Fei looked pretty scary just now. What if he was possessed by the devil… Bah! I’m just talking nonsense, please don’t mind me, ruofei!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it’s fine!” It’s fine! If a cultivator would be possessed by the devil just because of a few words, then they were too weak! In the future, if you have a grudge against someone, just curse them in your heart

Then, he said to Song Wei,”Weiwei, it’s fine. I’m not cultivating. I’m just thinking about a problem. There’s no such thing as interrupting. Besides, I’m almost done thinking.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

After dispelling Song Wei and Ling Qingxue’s worries, Xia ruofei looked at his watch and said,””It’s almost time to eat.. I’ll go and cook for you!”
