The faces of the tax officers immediately darkened when they heard this. One of the young officers with long hair said loudly,””Who’s abusing their power? Ah? Who was abusing their power? To think you’re a Finance Manager! How can you not know the rules!” “Then may I ask where’s the evidence?” Ling Qingxue refused to back down.”You’re trying to shut us up just because you made a baseless report. Aren’t you a little too overbearing?” At this moment, an older tax officer cleared his throat and said,””Little girl, you have to be responsible for what you say! Of course, we have the evidence, but this is confidential, and you are the direct party involved, so you should take the initiative to avoid suspicion! Why are you asking us for evidence? Can I let you guys look at it as you wish?” “You’ve already sealed the accounts. What else can we not see?” Ling Qingxue asked,”do you think we can fake the accounts again?” At this time, the young man with long hair frowned and said impatiently,””Old Yao, why are you wasting your breath on her! Just move it away directly!” After saying that, the young man with long hair came forward to carry the computer and accounts. “Who dares to move!” Ling Qingxue shouted as she covered the laptop and the stacks of account books. “Little girl, you’d better move away! You’re obstructing the law. ” The older officer said, then pointed to the tax officer holding a portable DV and said,”we’ve been filming the whole process. Your behavior will cause the punishment to be more severe!” This group of people clearly had a clear division of labor. Some were the good guys, some were the bad guys, some were in charge of filming, and some were waving flags and shouting at the side. Ling Qingxue stubbornly held onto the stack of account books and refused to let go. She had heard everything clearly just now and knew that these people were deliberately looking for an excuse to seal the accounts. If they couldn’t operate normally for ten days to half a month, Ling Ji F & B would definitely suffer a great blow. “Damn it, he’s really refusing a toast only to drink a forfeit!” The long – haired man pulled the older officer away and cursed. Then, long hair stepped forward and tried to pull Ling Qingxue. Just as his hand was about to touch Ling Qingxue’s wrist, a large hand grabbed his wrist like a pair of iron pincers. Then, a faint voice rang out,””Speak properly, don’t touch me.” It was Xia ruofei. He had been watching coldly from the side. After all, this was Ling Ji’s food and beverage business. It was only when he saw long hair make a move on Ling Qingxue that Xia ruofei made a move. Long hair felt that his wrist bone was about to split open, and he could not help but cry out in pain. A few officers beside him immediately shouted,” “Quickly let go!” “Why did you hit me!” “President Ling, why don’t your employees know the rules? Tell him to let go of Shen!” “Little Xia, let him go first,” Ling Xiaotian hurriedly called out. That long – haired little Shen was screaming like a pig being slaughtered. Ling Xiaotian was really afraid that Xia ruofei would break his wrist. Xia ruofei gave her a light push and then let go. Little Shen staggered back a few steps. His colleague behind him supported him before he could stabilize himself. Little Shen gritted his teeth as he rubbed his wrist. There was a bruise on it, and it looked shocking. “Motherf * cker! You dare to hit me!” Xiao Shen’s eyes were spitting fire as he charged at Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei’s mouth twitched and he said indifferently,””Are you sure you can beat me? If I were you, I wouldn’t come up here to be humiliated ...” The older officer quickly pulled Shen back and looked at Xia ruofei darkly.””Young man, I can understand that you’re eager to show off, but your behavior is very stupid. Not only will it not add points to your score, but it will also cause big trouble for your boss.” Xia ruofei didn’t even bat an eyelid. Instead, he turned around and asked,””Qingxue, are you alright?” “We’re fine ...” Ling Qingxue said.”RUO Fei, they’re just trying to mess with us. If they take our computers and accounts, we won’t be able to do business anymore ...” Xia ruofei patted Ling Qingxue’s shoulder to comfort her and said,””I know. Don’t worry! I won’t let them have their way ...” The senior officer saw that Xia ruofei had ignored his words and couldn’t help but feel a little angry. He continued,”Young man, I advise you to move away immediately! Interfering with our law enforcement will only bring more trouble to your company!” Xia ruofei acted as if he did not hear her and said to Ling Qingxue,””Qingxue, you go to uncle Ling’s side first. I’m here. They won’t be able to take a single piece of paper!” “En!” Ling Qingxue nodded her head obediently. “Too arrogant! He’s simply too arrogant!” The senior officer finally couldn’t take it anymore. He turned to Ling Xiaotian and asked,”President Ling, is this the attitude of Ling Ji’s restaurant? Is this your so – called Cooperative Work?” Ling Xiaotian could only say,”Section Chief Yao, Xiao Xia is young and impetuous. Please forgive him ...” “This isn’t a matter of being young and impetuous. This is already a violent resistance to the law!” Section Chief Yao said righteously,”President Ling, we have already recorded the entire process. The nature of this matter is very bad, and we will give you suggestions on how to deal with it soon! What you need to do now is to stop at the edge of the cliff and cooperate with us immediately. ” Ling Xiaotian couldn’t help but be put in a difficult position. He naturally didn’t want the company’s accounts and computers to be taken away by these people. Yingluo could imagine how long it would take for the accounts to be taken away. If that happened, would the company still be able to operate? However, it was not a good idea to stop them. It would only make the matter worse. Ling Xiaotian, who had been in the business world for so many years, felt trapped for the first time. He subconsciously looked at Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei smiled faintly and said,”it’s easy to take it away. Qingxue just said that you should show us the evidence.” Didn’t you say that someone reported it? Where’s the report letter? Since it’s so serious, there should be conclusive evidence in the letter, right?” “I’m sorry,” Section Chief Yao said gloomily.”The letter is confidential. To protect the informant, I can’t show it to you.” “You can hide the person who reported you! Just a photocopy will do, we will only look at the contents. ” Xia ruofei said indifferently,”otherwise, you can just say that someone reported you. That doesn’t make sense, does it?” “We definitely have evidence, but you don’t have the right to see it. Not just you, even President Ling doesn’t have the right to see it!” Section Chief Yao said,”if you’re not satisfied, you can file a complaint or report to the letter and letter Department. However, you must cooperate with us first. Otherwise, it will be considered a violent act of defiance of the law.” Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”since you guys are so shameless, what else is there to say?” Then let’s see who has the bigger fist! Come on! Beat me down and you can take my things!”
