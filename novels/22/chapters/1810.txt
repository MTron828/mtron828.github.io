Chapter 1811: Uncle Xu is here (2)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei wanted to take out his newly brewed Semillon for everyone to try, but it was Xie Bing who drove the company’s Mercedes – Benz here today. He didn’t bring his bag or anything. If he took out the wine out of thin air, he wouldn’t be able to explain it, so he simply gave up the idea.

Everyone had a great lunch. Although Ling Qingxue was not particularly close to Feng Rao and Dong Yun, it seemed like girls were naturally friendly with each other. Soon, the three beauties started to whisper to each other and even looked at Xia ruofei with a smile.

Xia ruofei was speechless. He didn’t believe that Ling Qingxue, Feng Jing, and Dong Yun could have any private conversation. To men, this was simply incomprehensible.

After lunch, Xia ruofei and the other two returned to Taoyuan farm while Ling Qingxue returned to the headquarters of the Ling Ji group. Everyone split up and left the Ling Ji private kitchen.

……

The next day, Feng Jing and Liu Qian took the high – speed rail to Egret Island early in the morning, while Xia ruofei stayed in the company to deal with some piled – up work.

He first called ye Lingyun and Lei Hu to his office and told them about his plans to expand the security Department and recruit drivers. He asked them to look for reliable retired comrades. If they could not recruit enough, they could also recruit from the public. The general principle was that those with military experience would be prioritized.

Ye Lingyun and Lei Hu were very excited when they heard that Xia ruofei was going to expand the security team to 150 to 200 people. This meant that there would be more job opportunities for their comrades. The current security positions at paradise Corporation were among the best in terms of salary. Furthermore, the boss was also a veteran and was very generous to everyone. What job could be more ideal than this?

Ye Lingyun and Lei Hu also expressed that they would cooperate with the Human Resources Department to complete the security department’s recruitment.

Xia ruofei was very confident in ye Lingyun and Lei Hu’s ability and loyalty. With the two of them watching over him, Xia ruofei did not have to worry so much about the recruitment.

Dong Yun and the others were also very efficient. In just one day, the plan to buy a car, the employee’s rental subsidy plan, the plan to expand the farm, the plan to build the pharmaceutical factory branch, and so on were all sent to him.

Xia ruofei looked at the thick plan and felt a headache.

Feng Jing had only been away for half a day, but he already missed Yingying. If she were here, he would have thrown all his work to her.

Xia ruofei had no choice but to look at the plan on his own.

Xia ruofei only took a brief look at the plan to purchase the buses and the senior management’s cars before he signed and approved it. Dong Yun proposed to purchase three Golden Dragon buses and six Mercedes – Benz S350s, which would cost about 11 million Yuan in total.

Xia ruofei had also looked through the employee’s Rental Allowance. Dong Yun’s plan was very thorough. The allowance was based on the base allowance and an additional factor. The base allowance was the same, but there would be different additional factors based on the number of years of service in the company and the rank. The sum of the two would be the amount of the rental Allowance.

In addition, the rental subsidy was issued to the employees who actually rented the house, so they had to file the rental contract. If they were found to have used a fake rental to obtain the subsidy, they would be severely punished and the subsidy that had been obtained in violation of the rules would be recovered.

In other words, if the employee continued to live in the company’s dormitory or in his own home, he would not be able to receive the rental Allowance.

Xia ruofei took a look and felt that the plan was quite strict and the subsidy amount was reasonable. Hence, he did not hesitate and quickly signed and approved it.

As for the expansion of the farm and the construction of the pharmaceutical factory, Xia ruofei did not make a decision immediately as it involved coordination with the local government. He wanted to wait for Feng Jing to return and discuss it with everyone.

The day passed quickly as she busied herself with her daily work.

Feng Jing also called. They had successfully picked up Xu lang and his assistant and were now on the high – speed train.

It only took more than an hour by high – speed rail from Heron Island to Sanshan. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

After Xia ruofei received the news, he waited for a while and then drove the Knight XV off – Road vehicle and let Xie Bing drive the Mercedes – Benz. The two cars left Taoyuan farm one after the other and went straight to the South train station. It also took 40 to 50 minutes to get from the farm to the South train station.

These two cars were already the most presentable cars in Paradise Farm. In fact, Knight XV was not very suitable for receiving guests.

Once again, Xia ruofei realized the necessity of the company buying a few good cars.

On the way to the South train station, Xia ruofei called the Ling’s private kitchen to confirm the menu for the evening and inform them of his approximate time of arrival. This way, the private kitchen could calculate the time and prepare the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ in advance.

After waiting at the South train station for more than 20 minutes, the high – speed train arrived.

In the past, it would take at least three to four hours to drive from San Shan to Heron Island. Now, the high – speed train only took more than an hour. The time was shortened by more than half. This was indeed the amazing speed of China.

Xia ruofei stood at the exit of the station with Xie Bing. After a while, they saw Feng Jing, Liu Qian, and Xu lang walking out of the passage.

After they passed through the gate, Xu lang waved in Xia ruofei’s direction. The old man looked energetic.

“Uncle Xu, welcome to the three mountains!” Xia ruofei smiled and went up to him.”You’ve had a long journey!”

Xu lang laughed and said,”Mr. Xia, the high – speed rail in our country has really opened my eyes!” It’s fast and steady. If I close the curtains, I can’t even feel the car moving!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”yes!” Didn’t a foreign friend do the experiment? A coin was placed on the high – speed rail and it didn’t collapse at the end. This shows how stable our country’s high – speed rail is!”

“Amazing!” Xu lang gave him a thumbs up.”Our country’s strength is reflected in all aspects. This makes us Chinese in Hong Kong proud!”

Xu lang was a very old – fashioned Hong Kong person. He had a sense of belonging to the mainland. He was even more disgusted by the actions of the young people in Hong Kong. He had once used the metaphysics of Feng Shui to say that those small groups of people were destroying their own good fortune and would have a great disaster in the future.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”uncle Xu, the car is just ahead. Let’s go have dinner first!” I’ve already booked the place ...”

“Good, good, good!” Xu lang chuckled and said,”I heard from miss Feng on the way here that Mr. Xia is treating us to the most authentic ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’. I’m already full of anticipation!”

Xia ruofei suddenly remembered that Xu lang had said that he was a true glutton and was obsessed with food.

Xia ruofei also felt that his thoughts yesterday were correct. If Xu lang did not want the reward, he could express his gratitude in other ways!

The group of people took two cars and soon arrived at Ling Ji private kitchen.

The son – in – Law was going to hold a banquet here, and he had ordered the menu in advance. In the evening, he had specially called to ask about it, which showed how much he valued his guests. Therefore, the Ling’s private kitchen did not dare to neglect it. All the preparations were done quite well.

Xia ruofei and the rest were quickly welcomed into the flying Snow Pavilion.

Everyone had just sat down for a short while when the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup was served. Many of the ingredients needed to be prepared for a few days. Even if it was a semi – finished product, it would take half a day to cook it into a finished product that could be served on the table.

The fact that the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup could come up so quickly meant that the kitchen had put in a lot of effort to calculate the time.

Amidst the rich fragrance, the jars of Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup were opened.

After taking a small sip, Xu lang was full of praise for the deliciousness of the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup. He kept giving a thumbs up.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”uncle Xu, please eat slowly.” I’ve also prepared a few bottles of good wine, let’s drink and chat!”

Xia ruofei then gestured to the waiter, who immediately took out two bottles of wine from the bag that Xia ruofei had brought.

The Golden – Yellow liquid immediately caught Xu Lang’s attention.
