Chapter 3656: A great uproar (2)

Translator: 549690339

“If you didn’t take my phone away, 1 wouldn’t have just found out about this piece of news!” Liang Qichao said with resentment.

“Don’t say so much, watch TV!” Said Daphne.

At this time, the TV screen had already cut to the scene, which was actually Steve. In galieny’s Manor in Melbourne, a large conference room had been temporarily set up as a press conference hall.

There were already many reporters seated in the conference hall. There was a table in front of them with a simple microphone on it.

Very quickly, Steve. With his head slightly lowered, Galiny quickly walked into the meeting room. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The camera lights flashed wildly, illuminating the entire conference room.

There were also many reporters who couldn’t wait to ask Steve. Galini asked. “Mr. Galini, may I ask your brother Grello? Has the news of Galini’s death been completely confirmed?”

“Mr. Galini, Grello. Are there any health problems with Mr. Galini?”

“Mr. Galini, there’s news that Grello … Mr. Galini experienced great pain before he died, and the situation is very strange. Is this information accurate?”

Steve. Galini’s hair was a little messy and he looked very Haggard. He did not say a word in the face of the reporter’s questions. He walked directly to the back of the table and sat down, turning on the microphone at the same time.

At this time, the head butler of the Galiny family, Tony, said,””Everyone, please be quiet! The question that everyone was concerned about was Steve. Mr. Galiny will explain in a moment. Next, let’s invite Steve. Mr. Galini is speaking!”

The reporters also knew that under such circumstances, Steve would not be able to escape. Galini would most likely not answer everyone’s questions. They asked questions one after another out of professional habits. Moreover, if he did not ask questions when others asked, wouldn’t that show that he was not dedicated enough? Therefore, with Tony’s reminder, the venue quickly returned to silence.

At that moment, Steve. Galini unfolded a piece of paper and said in a low voice,””Dear friends from the press, on behalf of the Galini family, 1 would like to announce a piece of sad news: My brother Grello. Galini had passed away a few hours ago due to a sudden illness.

Grello had set sail from Sydney on the Galini the day before. Today, he had died of a sudden serious illness in the waters about a hundred nautical miles east of Sydney.

The doctors on the ship had tried their best, and the medical helicopter was sent out as soon as possible, but it still couldn’t save greello’s life. Our galni family lost an outstanding member, and 1 lost my younger brother.

It was a sad thing, but there was no human conspiracy in the entire process. There were no obvious mistakes, including the doctors on board.

My brother has left. We hope that the media will respect the deceased and not hype up any news about greello’s death. Everything will be based on the information released by the Galini family. If anyone maliciously spreads false information, the Galini family will reserve the right to pursue legal responsibility.”

Steve. After reading the script, Galini stood up and walked out.

Naturally, the reporters were snapping away, and at the same time, there were people who were constantly looking at Steve. Galini asked, but he did not respond. He only left everyone with a lonely back. He seemed to be very sad because he had lost his brother.

The press conference was very short and ended in three to five minutes.

Very quickly, the screen cut back to the studio. The host said,””That’s the latest news from Melbourne. What we can confirm is that Grello … Mr. Galini has indeed passed away. Did our colleagues in the hospital bring us any latest news? Now, let’s connect…”

When the TV came to this point, Daphne stopped watching. She picked up the remote control and turned off the TV.

Daphne and Liang Qichao were silent for a while. Then, Liang Qichao said,””This guy… Died just like that?”

“I also think it’s a little unbelievable …” Daphne sighed.

Grello. The name Galini was like a nightmare to them. Whenever this name was mentioned, they would feel a headache and gnash their teeth in hatred.

If Xia ruofei had not gone to’ coordinate ’, perhaps Paradise Farm would have been in Grello. Even under the suppression of Galini, he could not survive until today.

Now that this fierce – looking guy had died so suddenly, both Daphne and Liang Qichao felt like they were in a dream.

At the same time, the news spread throughout Australia.

To the ordinary people, this was just a topic of conversation after a meal. After all, the Super – rich people were people from two different worlds. The gap between them was too far.

Some of the interested parties, especially those in the Australian mining industry, began to hold emergency meetings to discuss the impact of the incident.

Of course, Grello. Although Galiny’s death was sudden, the impact was not that big, especially when Steve died. Galini personally explained and emphasized that this was an unfortunate incident caused by a sudden illness, so the impact was even smaller.

To be honest, if it were the other way around, the one who would die wouldn’t be Grello. Galini, but Steve. If it was Galini, the impact would be much greater.

Perhaps all the miners would have a sleepless night.

Because everyone would be worried that if the Galiny family, the leader of the iron ore industry, was replaced by the shouting and killing Grello all day long… Would their living space be greatly reduced if Galiny took the helm? besides, greelio never played his cards according to common sense, and his methods were more ruthless. It could be said that he was a very troublesome guy. He controlled the Galiny family, and the uncertainties in the future were too strong.

And as long as Steve. For those in the iron ore industry, the Galini family had only lost a notorious hatchet man, and nothing had changed since he was still in power. Some of the past principles of the Galini family would not change because of Grello’s sudden death.

This was what Xia ruofei wanted to see.

He also didn’t want the foundation that Tang Yitian had painstakingly built to suffer any impact.

It was for this reason that Xia ruofei was willing to waste a soul seal to keep Steve. For a period of time in kalini.

Xia ruofei and Tang Yitian drank for a while and then went back to the guest room to rest.

For Tang Yitian, it was destined to be a busy night.

He had to give instructions to the foundation to deal with Grello. An unexpected situation that might occur after the sudden death of Galini.

This was not something that Xia ruofei needed to worry about.

The reason why he didn’t return to Peach Blossom Island directly was that, on one hand, he hoped to perform more acupuncture on Liang Qichao. On the other hand, it was because Tang Yitian wanted to add a new group of staff to the foundation, and he needed to help Tang Yitian.

The next day, Xia ruofei returned to Paradise Farm.

As soon as he returned to the farm, Liang Qichao said anxiously,””Ruofei, did you see the news last night? Grello. Galini is dead!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”l already know. Isn’t that good?” This kind of evil guy should have died a long time ago. Now… He’s suffering from retribution!” “Don’t tell me that this guy’s death is related to you?” Liang Qichao said casually,”this is too much of a coincidence!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”of course it has something to do with me!” 1 curse him to die a terrible death every day. My telekinesis is is so powerful that it directly killed him!”

Liang Qichao couldn’t help but laugh. “Don’t joke with me! The news said it was Grello. Galiny died of a sudden illness in the open sea. You were still in Sydney yesterday! Don’t tell me you can fly over and kill him?”

Xia ruofei smiled and didn’t say anything. Most of the time, even if he was telling the truth, it was hard for people to believe him. Hence, he could admit it openly and not worry about Liang Qichao’s suspicion..
