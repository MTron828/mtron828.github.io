3211 Everyone is happy (2)

Xia ruofei was obviously still hesitating about whether he should bring Ling Qingxue along.

Chen Nanfeng was slightly moved by Xia ruofei’s words.

In his opinion, Xia ruofei was obviously trying to fulfill the reputation of the first heaven society. That was why he had asked for a spot and had no intention of using it.

According to Xia ruofei’s plan, not only would the first heaven society’s reputation not be damaged, but they would also have three spots. Only three people had passed the music selection. It could be said that they had used all the spots.

And the surging waves sect and soaring Flower Valley would also have one more spot, so naturally everyone was happy.

Only Xia ruofei’s side had not changed much compared to Chen Nanfeng’s distribution plan.

Chen Nanfeng couldn’t help but feel touched. He said,””Fellow Daoist Xia, thank you for always thinking about us! The first heaven society will remember this favor and will definitely repay it in the future!”

From Chen Nanfeng’s statement, it was clear that he had agreed to distribute the spots according to Xia ruofei’s plan.

Mu Sheng of the surging waves sect and Liu Mansha of the soaring Flower Valley naturally did not have any objections. They both nodded in agreement.

Chen Xuan heaved a sigh of relief. He had almost missed out on this unprecedented moon landing expedition because of the quota.

He couldn’t help but cast a grateful look at Xia ruofei.

The Qi refining disciples from the three sects were also grateful to Xia ruofei. They had also been given the opportunity to join the expedition team because of Xia ruofei’s new distribution plan.

This was especially true for Xu yurou from the first heaven society. Only three people from the first heaven society had passed the music selection. Now that they had obtained three spots, it meant that she would definitely be able to join the exploration team.

Therefore, Xu yurou was very grateful to Xia ruofei. She looked at Xia ruofei with gratitude in her beautiful eyes.

Everyone was supportive of Xia ruofei’s plan. The sects quickly selected their candidates to go to the moon.

Naturally, the first heaven society did not need to select their three candidates. Shen tianfang, who was in the intermediate golden core stage, Chen Xuan, who was in the beginner golden core stage, and Xu yurou, who was in the Qi refining stage, were the only three people who had passed the selection. Furthermore, their cultivation levels matched each other perfectly.

There was actually no suspense as to the spots for the surging waves sect and soaring Flower Valley.

The surging waves sect only had elder mu Hua and mu Jianfei. They were also the strongest among the people who had passed the selection.

As for the soaring Flower Valley, they naturally chose elder Yang Liu and Liu Mansha’s personal disciple, Yu xiner.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Xia ruofei, on the other hand, could not make a decision for the time being. In theory, he had three slots, but he only wanted to use one of them. He did not want to have another one.

He didn’t want Ling Qingxue to take the risk with him.

As for the third chosen candidate spot, it was of no use to him at all.

Of course, if the news were to spread that this quota was to be sold in the cultivation world, everyone would definitely fight to the death, even if they had to pay a high price.

But Xia ruofei would definitely not do that.

He didn’t lack spirit stones, and he didn’t want any uncertainties to appear in the team that was going to the moon. Therefore, he would rather void the quota than sell it.

Moreover, everyone had already agreed to keep this matter strictly confidential. No information was allowed to be leaked.

After everyone had decided on the candidates, they went back to their guest rooms.

There were still many things to do, including testing whether the spaceship could travel in outer space and solving the spacesuit problem. Therefore, it was impossible to set off immediately.

This trip to the moon was full of danger, so he naturally had to be fully prepared.

After returning to her room, Ling Qingxue saw that the other sects had already distributed the spots. She couldn’t help but say,””RUO Fei, you have more than enough spots, bring me along!”

Xia ruofei said helplessly,”Qingxue, we’re not going on an outing. We’re going to the moon!” It was very dangerous! I really don’t want you to take the risk with me!”

Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”it seems like you’re afraid that my cultivation is too low and that I’ll be a burden!”

“That’s not what I meant ...” Xia ruofei said with a bitter smile.”Your cultivation is not low. Xu yurou of the first heaven society and Yu xiner of the soaring Flower Valley are about the same level as you ... To be honest, the difference between the Qi refining stages is not that big.”

When Xia ruofei mentioned the two female cultivators, Ling Qingxue could not help but frown. She said,””If you don’t think I’m a burden, then what’s the point? Are you afraid that I’ll affect your friendship with these two beauties? I saw the way fairy Xu from the first heaven sect looked at you just now. Her eyes were as tender as water!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”What are you talking about? This time, he was going to do something important, so how could there be any unnecessary things? I’m not even close to them, okay?”

“We’ll get familiar with each other after this adventure, won’t we?” Ling Qingxue said,”you said it yourself. This time, it’s very dangerous. If you play the hero and save the beauty again, the beauty might just throw herself into your arms!”

“We’re talking about the quota. It’s meaningless to talk about these things!” Xia ruofei said helplessly.

He thought to himself, you really can’t reason with a woman. When you’re unreasonable, you can’t talk her out of it, but when you’re reasonable, she doesn’t reason with you at all!

At this time, Song Wei, who had been watching the show, said with a smile,””RUO Fei, I think ... You can actually consider bringing Qingxue along! If it wasn’t for the fact that I didn’t pass the music selection, I would’ve gone too!”

Xia ruofei looked at Song Wei helplessly and said,”Wei Wei, don’t tell me you’re like Qingxue, thinking of me like that! There are so many female cultivators in the world of cultivation, how could I ...”

“We’re not that shallow, Qingxue was just joking with you!”Song Wei chuckled. Am I right? Qingxue!”

Ling Qingxue snorted and said,””Who asked this guy not to bring me along? And he rejected so quickly, and when he mentioned two female cultivators just now, he was so nervous! Don’t let me guess what you’re thinking by accident!”

“RUO Fei isn’t that kind of person!” Song Wei smiled and said,”he’s just worried about your safety! Let’s talk to him nicely, he might just agree!”

Xia ruofei looked at Song Wei and Ling Qingxue and said,””I can finally see that one of you is playing the good cop, and the other is playing the good cop! This move is pretty good!”

Song Wei blushed and said, “Don’t bite Lu Dongbin like a dog! I’m Doing This for Your Sake ...”

“Oh? I’d like to hear more details!” Xia ruofei looked at Song Wei with interest and said with a faint smile.

Song Wei sat on the sofa and said,””First of all, the other sects have at least two people and at most three people. It’s very disadvantageous for you to go alone! And they didn’t even look out for each other. Since Qingxue meets the conditions and you have a lot of slots, bringing her along would definitely be of help!”

“This rule is not valid!” Xia ruofei said,”I have the ability to protect myself. Even if Shen tianfang can defeat me, it’s impossible for him to kill me easily. At least I’m confident that I can escape from his attack! As for the others, they’re not my match at all!”

“Two fists can’t fight four hands, not to mention in the harsh environment of the moon.” Song Wei said,”any accident can happen, so Qingxue and I are actually very worried about you. It’s also because of this that Qingxue is determined to go with you.”

Xia ruofei was touched and said,””I know how you feel, but you’re the most important women in my life. How can I take Qingxue to such a dangerous place? If anything happens, how am I going to explain it to uncle Ling?”

Ling Qingxue’s eyes turned red.”I believe that you have the ability to protect me. Even if we are on the moon, I’m not afraid of anything with you around!” She said.
