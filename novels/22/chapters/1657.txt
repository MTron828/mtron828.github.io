Chapter 1658: A strange deviation (1)

The huge Airbus A350 was flying steadily at a cruising altitude above China. After more than two hours, it began to leave the mainland of China and entered the sky above the sea.

At this moment, the air stewardesses began to distribute lunch to the passengers.

The food served in the first class cabin was very exquisite. Before the food was served, the table was filled with knives, forks, and other tableware. There was also sea salt and olive oil dipped in bread.

There were a total of six dishes for a first – Class lunch, and each step was very particular. First, an Apple Soup with a crispy dough ball was served, followed by a shrimp cocktail and a shepherd’s pie and a slice of lamb meat covered with cheese and mashed potatoes. After the four dishes, a light vegetable salad was served.

The main course was a more Oriental – style braised tadpole fish with green curry with grilled eggplant, jasmine rice, and snow beans. The tadpole fish was cooked at the right time, soft and tender, and the fragrant rice was clear and had a good taste.

The last dessert was a warm honey tower with creamy milk, which was also a very English dessert.

Xia ruofei really liked this dessert. After eating, he ordered two more first – Class servings of Xuanji’s food. It was more than enough. Under normal circumstances, he could order more if it was not enough.

Of course, dinner was accompanied by the champagne bottle, which was the proudest product of the Australian Airlines,”Royal Taittinger Comte de champagne 2000.” This was awarded the title of the best champagne in the ball first – Class cabin for four consecutive years in the cellarsese the Skywalkers ‘selection. It was refreshing and had a rich fruity fragrance.

After enjoying a sumptuous lunch, Feng Jing laughed and said that she had wasted her time saving Yingying’s food. The food was too high in calories, especially the dessert at the end. So, even though it was delicious, Feng Jing resisted the urge to order another serving and wiped her mouth with a hot towel after eating.

Feng Jing was both envious and jealous as she watched Xia ruofei enjoy three desserts without restraint. Xia ruofei never controlled his diet, but he maintained a good figure and his skin was the envy of many girls. Feng Jing even suspected that Xia ruofei had been using the handmade Jade skin cream for a long time ...

After lunch, the two of them sat down and chatted.

At this time, the cockpit was also in a relaxed atmosphere. The autopilot had taken over the entire flight. The pilot only needed to monitor the state of the plane and constantly maintain contact with the air traffic control along the way. He just had to make fine adjustments to the route according to the instructions of the air traffic control. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Below the plane was the boundless ocean, but it couldn’t be seen at this time because the plane was already flying above the clouds.

Johannson, the captain, was playing with his retro – looking Ray – Ban flying glasses as he said with a smile,””Wilkinson! I’m going to retire in another three months, so I’m going to buy a farm in the Hunter Valley area and plant some artilleries and cabbages!”

“That’s a good idea!”Said Wilkinson, smiling. Captain Johansson, you must be looking forward to your retirement, right?”

“Of course! Of course!” Johannson laughed and said,”I’ve been flying for most of my life. It’s time to enjoy my leisure time. I’ve already bought a piece of land in Hunter Valley in advance. You’re all welcome to visit! I’ll treat you to the best half – llon wine!”

“It’s a deal!” “I’ll definitely go when I have time!” Said Wilkinson with a smile.

At this moment, the cockpit’s doorbell rang. Johannson glanced at the monitor screen and said with a smile,””It’s miss Guli!”

Then he pressed the door lock control switch. After the cockpit door opened, the flight’s flight crew head Guli walked in with a smile.

“Handsome guys, what would you like to have for lunch?” Guli asked.

“What do you have?” Johannson asked.

Guli thought for a while and smiled. “Today’s meal is more than enough. This is the first – Class menu, you can choose freely ... By the way, the honey tower is more popular, and there’s not much left, but I know that this is Wilkinson’s favorite, so I asked them to save one for you!”

“Thank you very much!” Said Wilkinson with a smile.

Johannson looked at the menu and ordered a few dishes. He then handed the menu to Wilkinson.

Wilkinson also chose a few of his favorite foods. Of course, he also chose his favorite honey tower.

Guli quickly jotted everything down in her little notebook, then smiled and said,”It seems that Wilkinson has a good appetite today! Please wait a moment, lunch will be ready soon!”

After that, Guli took the menu back and left the cockpit.

The cockpit was quiet again, and the two pilots were chatting. After a few minutes, Wilkinson said,””Captain Johannson, I’m going to the washroom!”

Johannson made an OK gesture and said,””Go! I’ll take over the communication!”

“Thank you!” Said Wilkinson with a smile. He then took off his headphones, stood up, and left the driver’s seat.

Wilkinson opened the cockpit door and waved to a male flight attendant in the front cabin. When the flight attendant walked over, Wilkinson smiled and said,””I’m going to the washroom! I’ll have to trouble you to stay in the cockpit for a while!”

“Alright!” Said the flight attendant with a smile. He then walked into the cockpit, greeted Captain Johannson, and sat down in the back seat.

After Wilkinson walked out of the cockpit, he smiled and nodded to the flight attendant working in the kitchen, then walked into the washroom in the front cabin.

After a while, Wilkinson walked out and took a look at the kitchen. He asked with a smile,””Is this Captain Johansson’s lunch?”

“Yes, I am!” The first – Class flight attendant nodded and said.
