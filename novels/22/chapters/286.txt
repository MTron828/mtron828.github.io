Chapter 287: Chapter 283 – mobilizing a large force to condemn someone (1)

A middle – aged man in his early forties was sitting behind the large desk in the general manager’s office. His figure was a little thin, and his high cheekbones had a pair of small eyes that revealed a trace of shadow. He was wearing a beige Tang suit and was rubbing two walnuts in his hands, looking quite sanctimonious. This middle – aged man was the “brother de” that the burly Man in Black had mentioned. Brother de’s full name was Wu De. He had only started his tea business in recent years. Previously, he started from scratch as a street gangster. He had accumulated a lot of wealth by relying on swindling and cheating. He also had a group of underlings under him. Therefore, although Wu De was new to the tea business, he relied on some unconventional means to suppress his competitors, and his business quickly flourished. With money, Wu De could naturally raise more thugs. Gradually, his reputation in the suburbs and several tea – producing towns became more and more famous. Many people couldn’t help but be afraid when they mentioned “brother de.” Even if some children in their families were disobedient, they would scare them and say,”if you don’t be obedient, brother de will take you away.” Wu De also became more and more arrogant. This year, when Wu De heard of li Zhifu’s fame in the tea – making industry, he had the idea of inviting li Zhifu to his tea factory to guide the tea – making process. Of course, Wu De’s intention was to make use of li Zhifu’s craftsmanship and reputation to occupy a place in the high – end tea market. He had thought that li Zhifu would not refuse his high salary of one hundred thousand Yuan and his famous name as “brother de”. He didn’t expect li Zhifu to be as stinky and hard as a stone in a latrine pit. He tried to persuade li Zhifu in any way possible, but it didn’t work at all. He was determined not to come out of the mountain. Wu De had his own way of doing things, and he believed that his way of doing things would be effective wherever he went. Therefore, he continued to send those punks to threaten and harass them. Today, he had just fought 300 rounds with the voluptuous female secretary in the office. When he was sitting in the chair and reminiscing about the taste of ecstasy, the black – shirted man rushed in, which made him feel a little unlucky. “Get out, knock on the door!” Wu De said with a frown. The Man in Black trembled and quickly said,””Swish!” He turned around and took two steps out, then turned back and said with a sad face,””Brother de, I ... I can’t knock on the door like this!” Only now did Wu De notice that the two arms of the big man in Black were dislocated. His eyes revealed a sharp light as he asked,””What’s going on?” The Man in Black quickly told him what had happened that day. He inevitably added some embellishments, especially Xia ruofei’s disdain for brother de. Wu De’s face grew gloomier and gloomier as he listened. In the end, he asked indifferently,””Do you know who this person is?” “I’m not sure ... Brother de, he looks unfamiliar, and his accent is different from ours. He should be a foreigner!” The Man in Black said,”he came out of old Niu’s shop. I guess he might be a relative of his ...” Wu De’s eyes were filled with anger. He gritted his teeth and said,””This kid is quite bold! You even dare to hit my, Wu De ‘s, underling! Hmph! I’d like to see how he’ll make me regret being born into this world!” After that, Wu De stood up and threw two walnuts into the drawer. He said,””Go! Come with me to meet this little brat!” Wu De walked out and then quickly stopped. He frowned and looked at the black – clothed man and said,”Forget it, you’d better not go. Help me gather all the people I can find, and then you can go to the hospital to check your arm!” “Good, good, good! Brother de, I’ll go get people now!” The black – clothed man quickly said. Wu De nodded with a gloomy expression. …… Yangdun town. Li Zhifu’s family, elder Song, Xia ruofei, song Rui, and manager Lu were sitting around the dining table. They were eating and chatting. The atmosphere was very harmonious. The dishes were all home – cooked dishes from the countryside. Since elder song had a serious liver disease before, they didn’t drink. However, elder song and Li Zhifu were reunited after a long time, so they were in a good mood. Everything they ate was delicious. While they were eating, Xia ruofei curiously asked li Zhifu about Da Hong Pao. He was especially interested in the six mother trees. This was because Xia ruofei was still thinking about whether he could take advantage of this trip to Mount Wu Yi to obtain a few stalks of the six mother trees and plant tea trees in his interspace. Xia ruofei believed that as long as he had the ear – planting technique, he would definitely be able to successfully breed tea trees in the unique environment of the spirit map. Furthermore, once the cutting was successful, the tea trees in the interspace would not only be the first generation of the Da Hong Pao mother tree’s products from cutting. The spirit Qi in the interspace was extremely rich, and the environment was suitable for the growth of almost all plants. Therefore, in theory, Xia ruofei could even cultivate tea trees of higher quality than the Da Hong Pao mother tree. With this thought in mind, Xia ruofei was naturally very concerned about the six mother trees, Da Hong Pao. After chatting with li Zhifu for a while, Xia ruofei had obtained a lot of information about the six mother trees, Da Hong Pao. For example, after 2007, the mother tree Da Hong Pao stopped harvesting, and there were professional organizations that maintained the environment around these six Da Hong Pao trees. In addition, the parent tree, Da Hong Pao, was managed by the Wuyishan City’s tea Bureau, which was also an uncommon branch, and had been upgraded from the previous tea Bureau. From this, it could be seen how much importance the local government placed on the six Da Hong Pao parent trees. The Wuyishan City government had even bought a huge amount of insurance for the parent trees. Just as everyone was eating and chatting, the sound of banging came from the first floor’s shutter door again. It was mixed with the sound of shouting and scolding. When they heard it, they knew it was not something good. Elder song put down his chopsticks and frowned. “What’s going on? She couldn’t even have a peaceful meal with brother Fu! Why is the security in this place so bad?” “Chief, do you want me to call the relevant leaders in the southeast province?” manager Lu asked immediately. The public security in this town is really outrageous!” Elder song waved his hand.”Forget it, forget it. If you’re not in your position, you shouldn’t meddle in politics. Besides, there’s no need to call the provincial leader for such a small matter!” “Okay ...” Manager Lu said. Song Rui stood up and volunteered,””Grandpa, I’ll go down and take a look! This bunch of grandsons just need to be taught a lesson, I’ll just teach them a lesson ...” “Xiao Rui, it’s good for you to go and take a look first!” Elder song said,”but you must be careful!” “Alright! Don’t worry, you can!” Song Rui said with confidence. Then, he got up and went downstairs. There happened to be a window on the side of the stairs facing the street. When song Rui passed by, he inadvertently glanced out of the window and was stunned. He rubbed his eyes, opened the window and stuck his head out to take another look. He was so scared that he immediately shrank back. Song Rui’s face was slightly pale. He looked at Xia ruofei and asked,””Ruofe...ERM...Can you go down with me?”Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com
