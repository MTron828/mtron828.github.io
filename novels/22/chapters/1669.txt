Chapter 1670: A miraculous landing (3)

In the cabin, Brook became more optimistic.

Judging from the operation just now, Xia ruofei had a good grasp of the key points of the movements. As long as he aimed at the runway well, he had a high chance of landing successfully.

“It’s rising! Pull down the landing gear!” Brook shouted.

He couldn’t do anything now. He could only use his mouth to command Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei lowered the landing gear. With the sound of the electric motor, the plane rose higher and higher.

1000 feet.

1500 feet.

......

“Ta tai, we’ll now turn to the two sides!” Brook said,”requesting permission to land again from the original direction!”

“I agree!”

“Xia, make a right turn!” Brook said.

“Understood!” Xia ruofei said.

He was now quite experienced in controlling the aircraft’s direction change in the air. The aircraft quickly and steadily tilted to the right, drawing a beautiful arc in the air.

Three sides, four sides ... The plane flew back on three sides parallel to the runway. When it was far enough, it turned four sides and then made a right – Angle turn. It drew a standard rectangular wake in the air and entered the five sides of the runway.

“We’re starting the landing again!” Brook said.

It was strange. After the unsuccessful attempt just now, Xia ruofei seemed to have improved his skills again. He seemed to be more successful in controlling the plane to descend.

Of course, this also depended on his mental power and the big heart he had trained in the special Combat Commando unit.

Soon, the plane began to slide down and slowly lowered its altitude.

After a while, the running track appeared in his field of vision again.

Even Brook didn’t notice that the number of reminders and corrections he made had obviously decreased during this attempt.

The plane’s height continued to drop. During this process, the landing gear was lowered, and the flaps were in place. The two white and red lamps in front of the plane indicated that the slide was very standard.

Brook looked at the runway in front of the plane and murmured in his heart,””Steady! Hold on ...”

Other than monitoring the plane’s speed and altitude, he had no other way to warn Xia ruofei because it was too late. By the time he gave the warning and Xia ruofei reacted to the situation, the plane would have deviated by ten to twenty meters.

Hence, he could only rely on Xia ruofei’s senses to control it.

“Good luck!” Feng Rao clenched her fists and shouted.

Xia ruofei had almost entered a state of selflessness. He had completely eliminated all distracting thoughts. It was as if the whistling wind in the cockpit had become very quiet. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

His left hand was adjusting the plane’s attitude based on his feelings. He could make more than ten adjustments in a few seconds. Sometimes, before the plane even deviated, Xia ruofei would have already adjusted it to the right position.

Hence, the plane seemed to land steadily on the runway, but in reality, Xia ruofei had made very small but accurate adjustments to achieve this effect.

Brook was so nervous that he was holding his breath. He even forgot the pain in his arm.

Feng Rao unconsciously gripped the armrest of her seat so tightly that her knuckles turned white.

The plane entered the runway steadily. Brook was about to remind him, but Xia ruofei had already pulled the lever.

The huge Airbus A350 began to show a slightly upturned nose. At the same time, because the lift was less than the gravity, it slowly landed on the runway.

Whoosh ...

The moment the plane touched the ground, it began to shake violently.

If it were any other co – Pilot controlling the plane, Brook would have definitely cursed out loud. This was definitely a heavy landing! However, the pilot was a rookie who had never flown a plane before! To be able to do this was simply a gift from God!

“Decelerate! The accelerator was pressed to the limit! Use reverse push!” Brook reminded him nervously.

In fact, Xia ruofei had already stepped on the accelerator to the minimum when he touched the ground. After hearing Brook’s reminder, he quickly pulled up the reverse push.

At the same time, Xia ruofei carefully pushed the control lever forward so that the nose of the plane landed steadily and the front landing gear landed on the runway.

The plane was taxiing at high speed on the runway, but the speed was rapidly decreasing due to the reverse thrust and the brake.

Even though the plane had yet to come to a complete stop, thunderous applause could already be heard from the passenger cabin behind them.

Feng Jing, who was sitting behind Xia ruofei, was already in tears ...
