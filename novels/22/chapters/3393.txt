He didn’t dare to relax for even a moment. He pushed his mental power to the maximum and paid attention to the situation of every star Fern thorn.

The moment any of the star Fern thorns showed signs of attacking, he would not hesitate to retreat. At the same time, he would immediately put Ling Qingxue into the spirit map space for protection.

The star Fern thorns had been releasing a peaceful aura the entire time. They swayed gently with the gentle breeze. If Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue had not experienced the ferocity of the star Fern thorns attacks, they would have been confused by their appearance.

Of course, the star Fern thorn had indeed not launched any attacks so far.

Xia ruofei maintained a moderate speed and slowly approached the arch.

He held onto Ling Qingxue’s soft hands, and his palms were already slightly sweaty.

Xia ruofei wasn’t afraid. He just felt pressured because he had to protect Ling Qingxue.

It was as if the star Fern thrust had changed its attitude. It completely ignored Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue, who were already two to three meters away from them. It had no intention of attacking.

Xia ruofei looked at the screen of light that was right in front of him. He made up his mind and activated his flying sword.

The speed of the qushuang flying sword suddenly increased several times, instantly reaching its maximum speed.

In the blink of an eye, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue were riding on their flying swords and crashed into the light screen.

A familiar sense of dizziness hit him, and soon Xia ruofei felt his feet on the ground again.

The first thing he did was to turn his head to the side.

When he saw that Ling Qingxue was still by his side, and her soft hands were still tightly held by him, his heart finally relaxed.

At this moment, Xia ruofei finally had the time to observe his surroundings. He immediately released the blue immortal sword and controlled the blue immortal sword and the qushuang flying sword to be on guard.

Ling Qingxue took a deep breath and felt the rich spiritual Qi in the surroundings. She then smiled and said,””RUO Fei, this is the trial Pagoda’s 6th level?”

Xia ruofei observed and said,””That should be right. Qingxue, the situation is still unclear, so we must be extremely careful! Don’t get too far away from me!” “Mm! 1 know!” Ling Qingxue said.

Xia ruofei saw that the two of them were at the peak of a tall mountain.

Xia ruofei could not tell how high the mountain was because when he looked down, he could only see the clouds lingering halfway up the mountain. He could not see the foot of the mountain at all.

He tried to use his spiritual power to investigate, but when his spiritual power entered the clouds, it was like a clay ox entering the sea, and he could not get any feedback at all.

There was another strange thing about the mountain. There was no vegetation, not even a blade of grass, let alone trees. It was like a huge, towering rock.

Moreover, this mountain was particularly steep. It was almost vertical, as if it had been cut by a huge sword.

Such a terrain, if it was in the secular world on earth, would definitely be the favorite of rock climbing enthusiasts.

Even the best rock climber would find it difficult to climb up in such terrain.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but say in his heart,”If I didn’t have the qushuang flying sword and didn’t know how to ride a flying sword, wouldn’t I be trapped in this small area on the peak of the mountain the moment I reached the 6th floor?

He didn’t know if any of the other cultivators in the exploration team could make it to this level, but if they didn’t get a magic weapon like the bent Frost Flying sword in the Tower of Trials, they would have to spend a lot of effort to leave the mountain.

Of course, if there were no other dangers, such terrain was not difficult for cultivators. Even if they could not ride a flying sword, as long as they were careful, climbing down was not a problem.

Xia ruofei looked into the distance. He realized that the clouds were not only lingering around the mountainside of the precipice mountain he was standing on, but they also extended into the distance like a thick white carpet. They extended to the end of his sight, forming a spectacular sea of clouds.

In the sea of clouds, Xia ruofei could vaguely see other peaks emerging from the sea of clouds.

These mountains were of different heights, as if they were growing on the sea of clouds.

Xia ruofei felt that there should be more mountains, but they were too low and were completely covered by the sea of clouds.

Besides the steep terrain, Xia ruofei did not find any other danger.

“RUO Fei, what do we do now?” Ling Qingxue had also observed the surrounding environment and couldn’t help but ask in confusion.

Xia ruofei said calmly,”wait!” Let’s see what the mission for the 6th level of the Tower of Trials is”

Xia ruofei was clear that when the situation was unclear, it was better to stay where they were and wait patiently than to risk running around aimlessly. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Once the content of the mission in the perceptual mirror’s field of vision was announced, he could have a target in mind.

“En!” Ling Qingxue nodded and looked at the vast sea of clouds.”! don’t have a good feeling about the clouds. When I look at the sea of clouds, I keep getting a sense of fear.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”something’s not right. If we really want to enter the sea of clouds, we must be very careful.” Of course, it’s best if we don’t go down and stay far away.”

Cultivators had an extraordinary sense of danger. Xia ruofei had a stronger sense of danger than Ling Qingxue, so he had long felt that there was something wrong with the sea of clouds.

In the perceptual mirror’s field of view, there was still no new content in the mission bar.

Xia ruofei took out the formation flag of the highest heaven formation from the spirit map space and said with a smile,””Since we don’t have any missions for now, let’s not idle around. Let’s cultivate for a while!”

With that, Xia ruofei waved his hand and accurately inserted the array flags into their respective seats.

Although the flagpoles were soft and the stones were hard, Xia ruofei was able to insert the nine array flags into the stones without much effort after he injected his vital Qi.

Then, Xia ruofei casually cast a spell.

Immediately, the formation flag began to tremble slightly. The blinding white light appeared again and surrounded the formation flag. It grew larger and larger, quickly expanding to a radius of about three kilometers.

Xia ruofei had already brought Ling Qingxue back to a certain distance.

In fact, the top of the mountain was not very big. The area of three to four kilometers basically occupied most of the entire top of the mountain.

When the dazzling white light gradually disappeared, the Luotian formation, which was formed by one to two thousand stone pillars, gradually appeared in front of Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei had already stored a lot of spiritual crystals in the space of the array flag, so the array started to operate immediately.

Xia ruofei smiled at Ling Qingxue and said,””Go! Qingxue!”

The two of them walked into the formation hand in hand, sat down cross – legged, and began to cultivate their own cultivation techniques.

While Xia ruofei was cultivating the “great Dao scroll”, he was also constantly transferring his elemental energy to the elemental storage Pearl. As he was stuck on the fifth level of the Tower of Trials, the elemental storage Pearl had used up a lot of its elemental energy. Xia ruofei had not been able to fill it up.

There was no wind on the top of the mountain, and the surroundings were quiet.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue had been cultivating for almost two hours. Xia ruofei had just filled up the energy storage Pearl and was ready to cultivate for a while more when a line of words appeared in the field of vision of the sensory mirror.

In fact, Xia ruofei really wanted to continue cultivating. With the help of the highest heaven formation, cultivation seemed to have become a very easy thing. With a clear mind, he was much more efficient than usual.

However, Xia ruofei was clear that his main goal was to complete the mission on the 6th level of the trial Pagoda and try to reach the highest level.

He had a faint feeling that if he could reach the top, he would obtain an unexpected and excellent opportunity.

Therefore, he immediately stopped his cultivation and looked at the line of words in the field of vision of the perceptual mirror..
