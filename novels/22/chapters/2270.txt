2271 The family meeting (1)

Liu Qunfeng’s expression tensed up. He knew that his father and Xia ruofei must have reached a clear conclusion from their conversation.

At this time, he couldn’t wait to know the result. After all, old man Liu was too important to the whole family. Taking himself as an example, he had been working in his current position for four years. Adding the two years he had worked before he was transferred, he had been in this position for six years. If he couldn’t make further progress in this election, he would soon reach the age limit, and his achievements in this life would stop here.

If elder Liu were to give up now, it would be a huge blow to Liu Qunfeng.

Unfortunately, all the specialists were at a loss on what to do with elder Liu’s illness. Moreover, the illness developed extremely quickly. The most conservative estimate after the consultation of the specialists was that it would only take one or two months, and this was under the premise that they had to use all means available to extend the life of the old man.

It could be said that Xia ruofei was the only life-saving straw now.

Although he felt like he was being scratched by a cat, elder Liu didn’t say anything. Liu Qunfeng didn’t dare to ask any more questions, and he quickly nodded.

Then, he walked out of the ward and began to contact his brothers and sisters in Beijing, as well as important members of his family, with his mobile phone. He asked them to put down everything at hand and rush to the hospital as soon as possible.

This wait lasted for almost an hour.

During this time, Liu Qunfeng went back to the ward again, but elder Liu had fallen asleep after taking the medicine. He didn’t dare to disturb him, so he quietly left.

Finally, all the important family members in the capital had arrived.

There were Liu Qunfeng’s two younger brothers, Liu qun Yan and Liu Shan Shan, as well as their younger sisters, Liu Li Ru and Liu Li Fang. There were also several important members of the Liu family, such as Liu Chongli, elder Liu’s cousin, and Liu Chongli’s two sons, Liu qun Fei and Liu qun Xin.

In the Liu family, the eldest son, Liu Qunfeng, could be said to be the successor of old master Liu. His achievements were also the highest. Among the other family members in politics, the highest level was Liu Shanshan’s department level.

Liu qun Yan and Liu Chongli were both in charge of the Liu family’s business empire. At the same time, old master Liu’s youngest daughter, Liu Lifang, and Liu Chongli’s second son, Liu qun Xin, also worked in the family group. As for old master Liu’s eldest daughter, Liu Liru, and Liu Chongli’s eldest son, Liu qun Fei, although they were also part of the system, they were only at the division level, and the departments they were in were not the kind with a lot of power.

These people were basically the core members of the family in Beijing. Old man Liu had a son, Liu qunxuan, who worked in a southwest province and had already entered the leadership team. He could not return to Beijing easily. This time, when old man Liu fell ill, Liu qunxuan returned two days later and rushed back. Unless old man Liu passed away, Liu qunxuan could not stay in Beijing forever.

As for Liu haofan and the other third-generation disciples, none of them had become great people yet, so they were naturally not qualified to attend this event.

Liu haojun was the focus of the third-generation, so he was qualified to be present at such an important moment. However, after his defeat in Sanshan city, Liu haojun’s political life had basically come to an end, and his status in the family had naturally plummeted.

As the saying goes, the Tian family is heartless. Although the Liu family was not considered a Tian family, in such a big family, family ties were basically very indifferent.

Just like this time when elder Liu was seriously ill, although the entire Liu family was burning with anxiety, in reality, everyone was more worried that after losing elder Liu, the Liu family would suffer various kinds of impacts that would directly affect their future development. As for the perspective of the younger generation, there was not much of a proportion of the feelings of admiration.

Liu Lifang, who was the least shrewd, could not help but ask, ” “Big brother, why did the old man call all of us over? Don’t tell me ... You want to explain ...”

“Shut up!” Liu Qunfeng glared at Liu Lifang and said,”don’t jinx it! Dad’s condition is stable, don’t let your thoughts run wild ...”

“I’m just concerned about elder Zhai,”Liu Lifang said, feeling a little wronged. I haven’t been able to eat or sleep these days because I’m worried about the old master. He suddenly gathered everyone here, how can I not think too much?”

Liu Liru tugged at her sister’s hand and said,”Li Fang, I can’t blame you for saying that. What were you saying just now? It’s a good thing big brother interrupted us, or else it would be so inauspicious!”

Then, Liu Liru turned to Liu Qunfeng and asked,”Big brother, dad must have called us over for something important, right?” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Yes!” Liu Qunfeng nodded and said,”this morning, that Xia guy came to see dad, and then the old man asked me to gather everyone here. It must be related to this!”

When Liu Lifang heard that, she asked anxiously,””Oh, really? Then what did they talk about? Did that kid agree to treat dad?”

“Don’t ask me!”Liu Qunfeng said. I don’t know anything about it! They met alone, and everyone was cleared out. Also, dad was very tight – lipped and didn’t reveal anything to me!”

At this time, Liu Chongli said,”Qunfeng, since everyone’s here, let’s go in!” Won’t everything be clear after meeting big brother?”

“Uncle, my dad just fell asleep after taking his medicine. I’ll go in and have a look ...” Liu Qunfeng said.
