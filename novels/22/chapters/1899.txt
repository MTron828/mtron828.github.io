Chapter 1900 Major progress (1)

Naturally, Xu Yougang and Wang Chong did not know that Fang Chenchen was the person Liu haojun wanted to meet. All they did was take pictures and record every car that entered and left the estate.

Zeng Liang and Zhang Aijun drove around the neighborhood to familiarize themselves with the terrain. When they saw Liu haojun’s car entering the high – end neighborhood, they knew that this place would be very important for their future work.

This was an instinctual reaction brought about by his job sense.

Xu Yougang paid close attention to the entrance of the community and said,””I have to find out which building and which house he entered ...”

“Squad leader Xu, I have a feeling that the breakthrough point is in this residential area. We must find an opportunity to sneak in!” Wang Chong said with a nod.

“Yeah!” Xu Yougang said. We’ll talk about it when liangzi and the others come back. We’ll go in at night!”

The security of such a high – end community was definitely very tight. Of course, for professionals like Xu Yougang, it was not too difficult to sneak into the community without being noticed. However, it was too obvious during the day, so it was best to wait until night time.

The two of them stayed in the car for more than ten minutes before the door of the van was pulled open. Zhang Aijun quickly got into the car and closed the door.

“How is it?” Xu Yougang asked.

“Squad leader Xu, we’ve walked around the area. This residential area isn’t very big. There are only three high – rise buildings in total, and there is an exit in the North. After squad leader Zeng sent me here, he went to wait there.” Zhang Aijun said.

He then handed a piece of paper to Xu Yougang, who was sitting in the front row, and continued,””We’ve basically confirmed the surrounding cameras and the general situation of the community. We’ve drawn a sketch. Squad leader Xu, take a look. As there’s no way to enter the district for the time being, the accuracy might not be very high. ”

Xu Yougang took the piece of paper and looked at it carefully. Although Zhang Aijun said it was just a draft, it was actually quite detailed. It included the distribution of the three buildings in the community, the location of the property Management Office and other buildings. The focus was on the distribution of cameras around the community. They were all clearly marked out.

Of course, Xu Yougang was not surprised. Zhang Aijun was a soldier that he had trained. Drawing a sketch was a necessary skill for a Scout. Moreover, their troops had higher requirements than the average Reconnaissance Company.

Xu Yougang basically came up with a plan for a night’s infiltration through a sketch. Of course, when it came to the actual implementation, it still needed to be further optimized according to the actual situation at the scene.

Just as Xu You was carefully memorizing the sketch, his work phone rang.

The call was from Zeng Liang.

“Liang, what’s the situation?” Xu Yougang answered the phone and asked.

“Old Xu, I saw Liu haojun’s car leaving from the North exit!” Zeng Liang said,”I’m following behind ...”

“Got it!” Xu Yougang raised his eyebrows and said. We’ll continue to wait here. Be careful not to follow too closely, or you’ll be exposed! We’ll keep in touch if anything happens!”

“Understood!” Zeng Liang answered calmly.

There were two possibilities for Liu haojun’s car to leave the community so quickly: One was that Liu haojun was only here to do something, such as picking up something, which took a short time and left with the car. The other possibility was that Liu haojun didn’t plan to leave today, so he asked the driver to go back first.

No matter what the situation was, Xu Yougang would not give up on this important target until he was sure. So, the best plan was to let Zeng Liang follow the car while they stayed to observe the situation.

Moreover, Xu Yougang’s intuition told him that the probability of the second possibility was much higher.

Zhang Aijun, who was sitting in the back row, immediately said,””Squad leader Xu, I’ll go to the North exit and keep watch!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“En, I’ll have to trouble you for a while. I’ll have Wang Chong take your place later.” Xu Yougang nodded.

Zhang Aijun grinned and said,”I’m fine!” This isn’t tiring!”

Xu Yougang smiled.”I think Liu haojun hasn’t left this community yet. We have to be prepared to stay up all night. We’ll take turns to go back to the car to rest!”

“Alright! Squad leader Xu, squad leader Wang, I’ll go first!” Zhang Aijun said.

Xu Yougang’s feeling was right. After about 40 minutes, Zeng Liang called.”Old Xu, the target is not in the car. This car went straight back to Changping, and the driver didn’t drive the car back to the mechanical fleet, but to a three – Star hotel in the county. When he got off the car, he was alone. I found a chance to go over and take a look, and there was no one else in the car!”

“It’s expected!”Xu Yougang nodded. Liangzi, you don’t have to keep an eye on the chauffeur, just come back! We need manpower here. ”

“Old Xu, don’t you think it’s strange for the driver to enter the hotel alone?” Zeng Liang asked,”do you want me to keep watch here for a while?”

“No matter what’s going on with the driver, we just need to keep an eye on the main target,” Xu Yougang said with a smile. “We can’t afford to be too distracted now since we don’t have enough manpower!” And as long as the target hasn’t disappeared, the driver will come to pick him up sooner or later!”

Xu Yougang paused and continued,””I heard that his driver was brought here from Beijing, and even his salary is paid by his family. Maybe the driver just booked a long – term room in the hotel to solve the accommodation problem. There’s no point in you keeping an eye on him. “
