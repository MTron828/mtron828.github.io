Translator: 549690339

Compared to these people, the district leaders and Bureau leaders who had arrived early were naturally secretly glad.

Feng Jing had already adjusted her seat card as quickly as she could. When she saw Xia ruofei walking over, she gave him a look.

Xia ruofei and Feng Jing had some tacit understanding. He immediately asked Deputy Mayor ni if it was convenient for him to go on stage to give a speech. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Sometimes, when the leader did not prepare a speech for such a last – minute event, most of the time he would decline.

However, Deputy – Mayor ni agreed without hesitation, which was really giving Xia ruofei face.

Of course, it was also possible that Deputy Mayor nI had asked his Secretary to prepare a script in advance.

No matter what, the other junior leaders had also started to pay more attention to Xia ruofei and the Paradise Corporation.

After leading Deputy – Mayor ni to the guest area, Xia ruofei chatted with him for a while before he excused himself.

Beside the small stage, Feng Jing saw Xia ruofei walking over and immediately went up to him. She asked,””Ruofei, what about Mayor ni ...”

“He agreed to give a speech, but I was too embarrassed to give him a time limit.” Xia ruofei said,”we’ll play it by ear! You must remember to communicate with the emcee about these adjustments to the procedures. Don’t make any mistakes later on and it’ll be a disgrace ...”

“Alright!” Feng ke said.

Following that, more guests arrived one after another. In addition to the leaders whose offices were not in Bell Tower District, people like Liang Weimin and the bosses of private enterprises also arrived one after another.

At around 10:20 am, the warm – up music gradually weakened and everyone’s attention was naturally focused on the stage.

A girl in a tube – Top dress walked onto the stage with a microphone and said with a smile,””Hello, everyone! Welcome to the opening ceremony of paradise Corporation. I’m an employee of paradise Corporation, Chen Li ...”

Xia ruofei had some impression of this Chen Li. If he remembered correctly, she was a team leader in the public relations department.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel cold for her when he saw her wearing a strapless dress in such cold weather.

“Before the ceremony begins, please allow me to introduce our guests today!” Chenli smiled.

At this point, Chen Li looked at the inscription card in her hand and said,””Mr. Ni Yongjie, a member of the Standing Committee of the Sanshan Municipal Committee and the Deputy mayor of the city government! Welcome, Mayor ni!”

In the midst of the applause, Deputy Mayor ni stood up and slightly bowed to the crowd behind him.

“Mr. Chen Jinxian, the party secretary of the Bell Tower District!” Chen Li continued. Welcome ... Mr. Guo Ming, the director of the Industry and Commerce Bureau of Sanshan city ...”

Three minutes passed by after the guests were introduced.

The reporters in the media seats were also taking photos non – stop. It could be said that the guests today were all heavyweight guests, especially Deputy – Mayor ni. His schedule was accompanied by the reporters of the city TV station, and it was very likely that he would be on tonight’s Sanshan news.

After the introduction of the guests, the first performance was a lion dance.

Feng Jing had contacted a rather famous Lion Dance Team from Guangdong. The team began to perform on stage amidst the lively gongs and drums, winning a burst of applause.

Xia ruofei was sitting beside Deputy Mayor ni. He was chatting with him in a low voice while clapping.

After the lion dance performance ended, the large screen in the stadium began to play a short promotional video of paradise Corporation.

A few days ago, Feng Jing had contacted a company she was familiar with to produce this film after they decided on the opening ceremony. As they were in a rush, the production crew had to stay up for almost two full nights.

Fortunately, the materials provided by paradise Corporation were quite rich, so there weren’t many scenes that needed to be reshooted. The main work was still editing the film, and it was finally completed before the opening ceremony.

This short video mainly introduced the process of Tao Yuan company from its founding to the present. Of course, there was also a comparison between the past and present, and the theme was still closely related to today’s relocation.

After the video finished playing, Deputy Mayor ni clapped and said to Xia ruofei,””President Xia, what an amazing achievement!”

“Mayor ni, you’re too kind!” Xia ruofei said humbly.

At this moment, Chen Li, who had returned to the stage, said,””Next, let’s invite Mayor ni to give a speech on stage with a warm round of applause!”

Deputy – Mayor ni stood up with a gentle smile on his face. As he walked to the stage, he took out a script from his shirt pocket.

‘As expected, it was prepared in advance,’ Xia ruofei thought.

He also had the leisure to pay attention to the thickness of Deputy – Mayor NI’s speech, which was about three to four pages. Even if the leader’s speech speed was not particularly fast, it should be done in 20 minutes.

Xia ruofei also heaved a sigh of relief. In this case, he would have at least 15 minutes. For paradise Corporation, the time was controllable and they would not miss the auspicious time.

Deputy – Mayor ni walked to the podium and said with a smile, “I’m very happy to be able to witness the Paradise corporation’s new glorious starting point today! First of all, please allow me to represent the three mountains Municipal Party Committee and the city government to express our warm congratulations to the Paradise Corporation!”

Deputy – Mayor ni paused for a moment, and everyone naturally cooperated and gave him a warm applause.

Next, Deputy – Mayor NI’s speech could be said to be quite standard. He listed some of the achievements of the Paradise company from its founding to now and was full of praise for the company, including the Paradise Foundation, saying that the Paradise company was a private enterprise with a sense of social responsibility.

In the end, Deputy Mayor ni also raised a few points of hope, nothing more than hoping that the peach blossom company would develop better and better, and work hard to contribute to the economic construction of Sanshan. Although it was all official words, the people in the audience were very serious.

After all, Deputy – Mayor ni was the representative of the municipal government to attend the ceremony, so his every word would be dispelled by everyone.

Of course, Deputy – Mayor NI’s purpose for this trip was to support the peach blossom company, so he didn’t mind being over – interpreted. Even Xia ruofei felt a little embarrassed when the company was praised.

While Deputy – Mayor ni was talking, Feng Jing sneaked up to Xia ruofei and whispered,””Ruofei, there are a lot more guests than we expected this time. Two of the key leaders of several departments have come. Our arrangements for the afternoon ...”

Feng Jing had wanted to report to Xia ruofei, but he had been sitting with Deputy – Mayor ni, so he took the opportunity to rush over.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”it’s not a big problem. Tell the hotel to open a few more tables!”

As the opening of the signboard was at 11:23 am, everyone would still have to visit the peach blossom mansion after the event. After the event was over, it would definitely be time for dinner, so Feng Jing had also made a reservation in the banquet hall of the nearby Shangri – La hotel.

“I’ve already asked Liu Qian to contact the hotel. It shouldn’t be a big problem. ” Feng ke said.

In the end, Deputy Mayor ni ended his speech with warm applause, put away his speech, and walked down the stage.

Chen Li returned to the stage and said,”let’s give a round of warm applause to thank Mayor ni again!” Next, let’s welcome Mr. Xia ruofei, the chairman of the peach blossom company, to give a speech!”

Xia ruofei stood up and waved to the crowd with a smile. Then, he buttoned his suit and walked up to the stage.

“Dear Mayor ni, Secretary Chen, leaders, friends from the media, and colleagues from paradise Corporation, Hello!” He said.

This simple greeting was met with a warm round of applause. This applause mainly came from the area where the employees of paradise Corporation were sitting.

“Today, we’ve moved our headquarters to the Tao Yuan building. Just like Mayor ni said, this is a starting point for our company to reach new glory.” Xia ruofei said,”paradise Corporation has not been established for a long time, but with the support of all the leaders and friends, and the joint efforts of all the employees, the company has developed very quickly. To be slightly humble, it can be said that it has become famous.”

Xia ruofei paused for a moment and looked around at the crowd. Then, he continued,””Just as Mayor ni said, with great power comes great responsibility. Our paradise Corporation has always been very concerned about charity, and we’ve even set up a paradise Charity Foundation. Today, I’m going to make use of this joyous occasion to announce a decision. ”
