Chapter 513: Australia_here I come

Xia ruofei, who was discussing the construction of the new land in the South with manager li and Feng Jing, was surprised to see Qin Xiaoyu driving after him instead of leaving.

He thought to himself,”this girl can’t be still not giving up, right?”

Qin Xiao Yu got off the car and walked to Xia ruofei, saying stiffly,””We accept your proposal. Chief Chen agrees to let you arrange for your friend to attend the award ceremony.”

Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and smiled. “That’s the way! If we have a discussion, we won’t make things difficult for you, right?”

Qin Xiao Yu snorted and did not give Xia ruofei a good look.

Since Xia ruofei had already promised Qin Xiao Yu, he would not make things difficult for her anymore. He was not offended by Qin Xiao Yu’s attitude and smiled,””I’ll make the necessary arrangements. I’ll get him to contact you in the afternoon.”

“You’d better hurry. Also, tell your friend what happened. There will be a lot of reporters tomorrow!” Qin Xiao Yu said.

Xia ruofei shook his head.”My friend will only attend the award ceremony. He won’t be interviewed. You can just explain the case to the police.”

“How could you do this?” Qin Xiao Yu couldn’t hold back her anger again.

Especially when she saw that Xia ruofei was still smiling as if he had her in the palm of his hand, she was even more furious.

However, she soon realized sadly that Xia ruofei had her in the palm of his hand this time. She knew without thinking that chief Chen had even agreed to Xia ruofei’s condition of not attending in person. He would definitely agree to Xia ruofei’s friend’s request of not accepting interviews without a second thought.

Anyway, it’s not my personal matter, so what’s the point of fighting with him? Qin Xiao Yu thought disappointedly. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“That’s fine, you arrange the people ...” Qin Xiao Yu said disappointedly.

“Don’t worry, I’ll naturally do what I’ve promised,” Xia ruofei said indifferently and continued to ask,”is there anything else, officer Qin?”

Qin Xiao Yu shook her head with a cold face and turned to the police car.

When Qin Xiao Yu opened the door of the police car, she thought of another thing and said loudly,””Xia ruofei, chief Chen has said that we’ll give you the 100000 Yuan reward promised by the Ministry. In addition, we’ll reward you with 50000 Yuan in the name of the Sanshan Public Security Bureau!”

Xia ruofei had already turned around and was walking towards Feng Jing and manager li. He stopped and waved his hand without looking back. He said loudly,”I know. Please thank bureau chief Chen for me!”

Qin Xiao Yu saw that Xia ruofei didn’t even turn his head and couldn’t help but Mutter,””Really, what’s with the arrogance ...”

Although the result of this matter was not perfect, at least the task was completed. Qin Xiao Yu did not want to stay any longer, she started the car as soon as she got into the car and quickly left Taoyuan farm.

Feng Jing and manager li had been watching the show, but since Xia ruofei did not explain, they did not ask. The three of them continued to inspect the site and discuss the infrastructure.

Xia ruofei accompanied manager li to look at the north and south lands. Then, he personally sent him to the small square in front of the multi – Purpose building. He smiled and said,””Manager li, please help us design a plan first! In addition to a cold storage in the South, we can also design a few vegetable greenhouses, and the North will mainly be built with greenhouses. In addition, a part of the land should be reserved for future development. ”

“Alright, we’ll come up with a plan as soon as possible.” Manager Li said politely.

Feng Jing added,”Chairman, after the cold storage is built, our farm’s electricity consumption will definitely increase by a lot. Also, the cold storage must ensure power supply. If there’s a power outage, it will cause a lot of losses. So I think it’s necessary to contact the power company and apply for two dedicated power lines, one main and one backup.”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel the pinch when he heard this. The dedicated line was to set up the power supply line directly from the substation. Moreover, one main and one backup would definitely have to be wired from two different substation. Otherwise, it would not be able to achieve the effect of backup at all. This would cost a lot!

Moreover, after the completion of the two lines, the maintenance and inspection of the two lines would definitely have to be entrusted to the power supply company. This way, there would be a temporary expenditure in addition to the electricity bill every month.

However, Xia ruofei also knew that he could not be thrifty.

Otherwise, if the cold storage warehouse was put into use and stored many expensive Taoyuan vegetables, there would be a long power outage, and the loss would be even more.

Just as Xia ruofei was silently calculating in his heart, manager li took the initiative to say,””Boss Xia, boss Feng, we have a lot of dealings with power supply companies. I’ll go back and talk to boss Liang, and we’ll help you coordinate it! I’m sure you’ll get a discount on the price. ”

“That’s great!” Xia ruofei said happily,”manager Li, I’ll leave it to you.”

“Boss Xia, you’re welcome. Our boss Liang has instructed me to do my best to serve you!” Manager Li said with a smile.

After sending manager li off, Feng Jing returned to her office to continue her work. Xia ruofei stood in the small square in front of the building and muttered to himself for a while before calling Lei Hu over.

Very quickly, Lei Hu drove the electric car that was patrolling the farm to Xia ruofei and said,””Brother Xia, you were looking for me?”

“En, Hu, I have something for you to do!” Xia ruofei nodded.
