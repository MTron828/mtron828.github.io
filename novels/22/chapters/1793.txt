Chapter 1794: Displaying strength (2)

Translator: 549690339

Ling Qingxue’s eyes slowly widened. She really felt that Xia ruofei was making fun of her.

“RUO Fei ...” Ling Qingxue didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”You’re not joking with me, are you? Or perhaps ... Your paradise Corporation is preparing to enter the film industry and want to make a Xianxia movie? Were you talking to me about the script of the movie?”

Xia ruofei laughed bitterly to himself. At the same time, he was glad that he did not tell her about his relationship with Song Wei.

Judging from Ling Qingxue’s reaction, if he told her about his experience with Song Wei, she would probably think that Qianqian, who treated him like a fool, could have come up with such a lame excuse.

“No, I’m serious ...” Xia ruofei said.

Ling Qingxue touched Xia ruofei’s forehead and said,””I don’t have a fever! Why are you talking nonsense now?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I know you find it hard to believe ...”

“It’s not that I don’t believe it, but anyone with a normal brain wouldn’t believe a plot that only appears in movies!” Ling Qingxue said,”ruofei, you’re really acting weird today. Is it because you’ve been under too much pressure lately that you ...”

At this point, Ling Qingxue suddenly stopped. Her eyes were wide open, and the expression on her face was completely frozen ...

Because she saw that while she was speaking, Xia ruofei suddenly reached out and grabbed at the air. Then, a hole appeared on the beach. A ball of sand completely violated the laws of physics and just floated one meter in front of her.

“This ... This ...” Ling Qingxue was flabbergasted.

Xia ruofei smiled and drew a line in the air. The ball of sand immediately fell apart. However, it did not land on the ground. Instead, it hovered in the air and formed the words “Ling Qingxue”!

Ling Qingxue’s mouth was wide open. After a while, she said,””Ruofei, where did you learn magic? This was too amazing! No wonder you were talking about the power to topple mountains and overturn the seas. It was all for the magic effect!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei almost fell over. He had thought that seeing was believing. As long as he showed a little of his strength, Ling Qingxue would accept what he had just said. He did not expect that it would all be in vain.

“Magic?” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”Qingxue, you actually thought it was magic ... What about this?”

After he finished speaking, Xia ruofei struck his palm at the coastline not far away. This time, he used 70% to 80% of his strength and a huge amount of genuine Qi was exuded.

A one – foot – deep trench appeared on the beach, extending all the way to the sea. Then, the seawater that was hitting the beach was also split in two, forcibly separated from the middle. After a few seconds, the trench slowly disappeared.

“And this?” Xia ruofei said.

This time, he made a grabbing motion in the air, and Ling Qingxue felt a gentle force lift her up. Her entire body left the ground, and she was suspended in the air ...

Ling Qingxue was so scared that her face turned pale. Fortunately, Xia ruofei quickly put her down and smiled.””Qingxue, do you still think it’s magic?”

Ling Qingxue felt that her brain wasn’t enough. Of course, she didn’t think that this was magic.

Magic tricks were all smokescreens. They relied on props and techniques. They had clearly come to this beach on the spur of the moment. The place had been randomly chosen by Ling Qingxue. If the sand turning into a ball just now could have been a magic trick, then Xia ruofei’s shocking performance after that could not have been the result of magic.

At this moment, Ling Qingxue started to seriously consider what Xia ruofei had just said.

“You ... You ...” Ling Qingxue stuttered,”RUO Fei, was everything you said just now true? Also, you ... You also have this kind of power?”

Xia ruofei heaved a sigh of relief. The conversation could finally proceed normally.

He nodded slightly and said,”Qingxue, I know that this is a little hard to accept. In fact, it has completely gone beyond the scope of science that we’ve been taught since we were young. However, as long as it exists, it is reasonable. Facts have proven that such a power exists.”

Ling Qingxue nodded. The truth spoke louder than words. No matter how hard she thought it was impossible, the eyes would not lie to her. Even if what the eyes saw might not be the truth, Xia ruofei would not be so bored as to lie to her about such things.

Xia ruofei continued,”actually, the magic of this power is far beyond what I have just said and ... Those performances. If one can master this power, one’s lifespan can be greatly extended. If one reaches a certain level, one can even look young forever.”

Women really valued beauty the most. After Ling Qingxue heard this, her eyes clearly lit up.

Xia ruofei laughed to himself and continued,””Qingxue, what I’m going to tell you today is this power that we call supernatural! In fact, this power isn’t inborn, but acquired through cultivation. When we first met after I retired from the Army, I didn’t have this power at all, but now ... You’ve seen it for yourself!”

“Training? You’re saying ... It’s like Qigong?” Ling Qingxue asked in surprise.

Xia ruofei nodded.”Yes, you can think of it as a way of cultivation that is much more advanced than Qigong. In fact, we call it cultivation!”

“RUO Fei,” Ling Qingxue said,”my mind is a little confused right now. My ... My boyfriend has actually become a cultivator who can fly into the sky and dive into the ground. He has the power to destroy everything?”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”It’s not that exaggerated. My cultivation is not that high. After all, I entered the sect late!”

At this point, Xia ruofei said seriously,””Qingxue, the reason why I’m telling you all this today is that I hope you can cultivate with me! I don’t want to be like this after a few decades while your face gradually ages. Time will eventually take you away, and I have to endure the loneliness in my endless thoughts ...”

Ling Qingxue’s eyes reddened when she heard that. Xia ruofei used a bit of his spiritual power to make Ling Qingxue fall into that situation.

An image flashed through her mind: Many years later, Xia ruofei still had the same young face and strong body, but she couldn’t resist the erosion of time, and wrinkles gradually climbed up her forehead ... Many years later, she said goodbye to this world reluctantly, and then Xia ruofei wandered alone to the place where the two of them had once been, his eyes filled with deep longing ...

Tears welled up in Ling Qingxue’s eyes. Then, she caught the main point in Xia ruofei’s words and asked impatiently,””RUO Fei, you ... You’re saying that I can also cultivate? To have such power? Can you maintain your youthful appearance?”

“As long as one’s cultivation reaches a certain level, there is indeed the effect of retaining one’s youthful looks,” Xia ruofei nodded.

Xia ruofei did not lie to Ling Qingxue. If one could cultivate to the foundation establishment stage, one’s appearance would not age. Only when one’s life was at its end and one’s life was about to end would one age rapidly. For most of the time, one would maintain the appearance of one’s youth.

Xia ruofei continued.”Cultivation requires a certain amount of talent. However, my Qingxue is so smart. She will definitely have no problem!”

Ling Qingxue nodded and said,””Mm! I can definitely do it! RUO Fei, please teach me how to cultivate! I’ll definitely work hard to catch up to you!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”no rush!” I’ll first check if your Constitution is suitable for cultivation and what kind of attribute cultivation technique is suitable for you to cultivate!”

With that, Xia ruofei reached out and grabbed Ling Qingxue’s wrist. A stream of gentle true Qi mixed with spiritual energy entered Ling Qingxue’s body.

Ling Qingxue suddenly felt a warm current flowing into her palm and flowing through her meridians. It was warm and comfortable.

She looked at Xia ruofei nervously, but his expression did not change even when he opened his eyes.

“How is it? RUO Fei, can I cultivate with my physique?” Ling Qingxue asked urgently.
