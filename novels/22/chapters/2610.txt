2611 Elder Liu’s decision (1)

88 meters.

This was Xia ruofei’s final result.

To increase from 68 meters to 88 meters, at a normal speed, it would be difficult to succeed even after a hundred tries. However, because of the Enlightenment he had gained from the last challenge, Xia ruofei’s results had improved by leaps and bounds after repeated practice. This was the preciousness of the Jade pillar array.

It could be said that Xia ruofei’s attainment in the floating Lotus steps had improved by a huge margin compared to the time before he had attempted the array.

This time, Xia ruofei had taken advantage of the moment when he had the clearest understanding of the array. He had done it in one go and did not have enough rest. Although his true Qi and mental energy had not been exhausted in the process of breaking through the formation, he had consumed a lot of energy.

He sat on the ground and panted heavily. It had been a long time since he had felt so tired. However, he was in a very good mood, and the smile on his face could not be suppressed.

As his proficiency increased, Xia ruofei’s understanding of the wandering steps became deeper and deeper. At the same time, he also felt that this movement technique was more brilliant.

Those that could be included in the Jade talismans of inheritance were indeed the best of the best.

Xia ruofei now had a certain understanding of Earth’s cultivation world. This was mainly from Liu chengfeng’s retelling. However, Liu chengfeng’s cultivation was not very high and he could not get in touch with some information from the upper echelons. Hence, Xia ruofei’s understanding was limited to a broader scope.

However, there was one thing that Xia ruofei was sure of. The world of cultivation was not a paradise. On the contrary, those cultivators who looked like Immortals were often more evil than one another. The law of the jungle was even more obvious in the world of cultivation. After all, the secular world was still bound by laws and controlled by state machinery. There was only one general rule in the world of cultivation, and that was strength.

The importance of the floating steps to Xia ruofei was obvious.

It was inevitable that he would have more and more contact with the cultivation world in the future. The “great Dao technique” could allow him to cultivate faster and have a higher cultivation. However, cultivation alone was not enough. Hence, Xia ruofei was also perfecting his Arsenal.

The body technique of the drifting steps, the sword technique of the noble Sword, and the array Dao that he had persevered in learning would become the chips he would use against his enemies in the future.

After understanding the basic situation of the cultivation world on earth, Xia ruofei was even more eager to improve his strength.

He sat on the ground and rested for a while, then got up and went to the open space in front of the tower. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Xia ruofei closed his eyes and silently recalled the process of how he broke through the array a few times. Then, he began to practice the floating Lotus steps.

Although he didn’t have a flash of enlightenment like the last time, he still gained a lot of insight in the process of breaking through the array. Such insights would only be produced in an extremely high – pressure environment, so they were also very precious.

Xia ruofei continued to integrate this little bit of insight into his martial art motion. After practicing for five to six hours, he finally stopped to rest.

He raised his hand to wipe his sweat, then took a bottle of spirit pool water and drank it in big gulps. Then, he sat down on the Jade futon and circulated the great Dao chant to absorb the spirit Qi and recover the mental power that he had just lost.

After about an hour, Xia ruofei felt that he was in good shape. He stood up and walked into the pagoda. He had one last chance to challenge the array today and he would not waste it.

After all, he would only respawn after seven days after using up all three chances.

He had adjusted his condition to the best state and had absorbed all the insights he had gained from the second challenge. Hence, Xia ruofei entered the Jade pillar array without hesitation.

For the first 60 to 70 meters, it was still like a hot knife through butter. Now, when he was about 80 meters back, Xia ruofei felt the pressure increase sharply. However, he continued to move forward steadily.

In the end, Xia ruofei fell at the 93 – meter mark.

This time, his score had only increased by five meters, but Xia ruofei was not depressed. After all, the Enlightenment he had gained after his first attempt had already given him a big surprise.

Besides, Xia ruofei could clearly feel that the 200 – meter Jade pillar array was located exactly 100 meters in the middle of the array. It should be a big obstacle. The closer one got to 100 meters, the more difficult it would be.

He felt that it wouldn’t be easy for him to break through the 100 – meter barrier.

Unless he had another epiphany like that.

But how could such a rare opportunity be so easily obtained?

Xia ruofei turned back to look at the Jade pillar array that was shrouded in fog and left the Linglong tower.

He cultivated in the medium for a while, and when his mental power and true Qi recovered, he stopped.

Xia ruofei didn’t head over to the mountain sea realm’s side. Instead, he directly sent a thought transmission to Xia Qing and called her over.

When Xia ruofei was breaking through the array, Xia Qing had already finished brewing the Chinese medicine and mixed it with the diluted spirit Heart Flower petal solution.

Xia ruofei personally filled the bottles into vacuum – sealed medicine bags and sealed them with a machine.

He then left the spirit map space in a flash.

He left the canned Chinese medicine in the spirit map space. He planned to rest in the courtyard for the night, so he wasn’t in a hurry to take the Chinese medicine out. In terms of preservation, the best and most expensive refrigerator in the world couldn’t compare to the spirit map space.
