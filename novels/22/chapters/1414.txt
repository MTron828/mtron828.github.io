Xia ruofei saw Luo Xing, who was about to be promoted to the director of the e – commerce business department, walking into the banquet hall with another person.

This person was Lin Qiao. As soon as she entered the door, her eyes had accurately found Xia ruofei. She smiled at Xia ruofei sweetly with a trace of pride.

Xia ruofei was stunned. Didn’t Qiao’ er say that she would only be back tomorrow? Why did he return to San Shan tonight and even appear at the company’s Annual Meeting ...

Feng Rao seemed to know that Lin Qiao would come. Seeing Xia ruofei’s dazed look, she couldn’t help but smile and touch Xia ruofei.”Chairman, what are you doing? Aren’t you going to welcome him?”

Xia ruofei turned to look at Feng Rao and asked,””What’s going on? So you guys were secretly playing tricks and kept me in the dark?”

While Xia ruofei and Feng Jing were talking, Lin Qiao and Luo Xing had already walked over.

Hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Lin Qiao couldn’t help but smile and said coyly,””Brother ruofei, what are you saying? I’m still considered half an employee of paradise Corporation, right? Don’t you have the right to attend the Annual Meeting?” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Xia ruofei replied unhappily,”I’m not talking about that!” You little girl ... Didn’t you send me a WeChat message a few days ago, saying that you’re going back to Sanshan tomorrow morning? Can you explain why you’re in the three mountains now? I really believed your lies ...”

Feng Rao laughed and said,”Chairman ... I’ve discussed this with Lin Qiao!” I just wanted to give you a surprise!”

Lin Qiao also smiled and said,”brother ruofei, I didn’t lie to you!” I can’t buy a high – speed rail ticket back today. I originally booked a ticket for tomorrow morning! Later, when I talked to President Feng about this, she said that it would be a pity if I couldn’t attend the company’s Annual Meeting today. She had a friend who drove back to Sanshan from Heron Island today, so she dropped me off ... If you don’t believe me, I can show you the ticket refund record!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry as he said,”no need, no need ... You guys have really kept it from me for so long!” Isn’t this too well – kept?”

Lin Qiao stuck out her tongue and said,”President Feng told me not to tell you in advance. Then, I suddenly appeared in front of you to see if you were scared ...”

Feng Rao couldn’t help but say,”Lin Qiao, you’re being a little unkind!” How could you sell me out so easily?”

Xia ruofei said,”Okay, okay, you two don’t have to sing the same tune!” The annual meeting is about to begin. Qiao’ er, you can find a place to sit by yourself!”

Luo Xing quickly said,”director Xia, everything has been arranged on our side. Lin Qiao is very familiar with our colleagues in the e – commerce Department. Let her sit with us!”

Xia ruofei glanced at Luo Xing and said,””So you knew in advance that Qiao’ er was coming back today?”

Luo Xing scratched his head in embarrassment and laughed awkwardly.

“Alright, alright, you can bring Qiao’ er over!” Xia ruofei said.

“I know!” Lin Qiao said with a smile. Brother ruofei, you can’t be mad at President Feng and manager Luo!”

“Now you know how to be a good person?” Xia ruofei glanced at Lin Qiao and said,”I must punish President Feng and Luo Xing!”

Feng Rao couldn’t help but laugh,”alright! Why was such a Big Boss competing with a little girl! Lin Qiao, ignore your brother and go with Luo Xing!”

“I know!” Lin Qiao winked at Feng Jing as she spoke. Then, she giggled and glanced at Xia ruofei before following Luo Xing to the e – commerce Department.

Most of the staff had arrived. At this time, the warm music gradually weakened, and the general assistant of tonight’s host, Liu Qian, walked onto the stage in an evening dress with a smile.

Liu Qian was a multi – talented girl. She had hosted campus singing competitions, freshmen welcoming parties, graduation parties, and so on when she was in University. Hence, after discussing with Xia ruofei, Feng Jing decided to let her host the annual meeting.

As soon as Liu Qian went on stage, the employees slowly quieted down. Whether they were chatting or playing with their mobile phones, they all stopped and focused their attention on the stage.

It could be seen that the discipline of peach blossom company’s employees was not bad.

Liu Qian held the microphone and said with a smile,”Good evening, my fellow colleagues! Welcome, everyone, to the venue of our paradise corporation’s annual party! I’m tonight’s host, Liu Qian!”

As soon as she finished speaking, the audience immediately broke into a warm round of applause.

A few young people who were familiar with Liu Qian in the company headquarters even screamed.

Liu Qian played it off,”yo!” Why are there still people jeering? Don’t hide, I’m talking about you! Xue Xiang! Do you still want to win the lottery later?”

Everyone burst into laughter. Xue Xiang, who was called out by Liu Qian, pretended to be very afraid and kept bowing.

Liu Qian chuckled, then immediately returned to the main topic.

She said,”tonight, all the employees of paradise Corporation are gathered together. Everyone has worked hard for the past year. Today, President Xia and President Feng will be celebrating the New Year together!” They have also prepared very generous prizes for everyone, which will be given out in many of the lucky draw segments tonight! President Xia will also announce several important decisions that are related to everyone’s interests!”

When everyone heard this, their interest increased. They all perked up their ears and stared at Liu Qian, afraid to miss any important content.
