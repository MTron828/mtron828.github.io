2281 Begin the healing_Xia ruofei was taken aback. He did not expect Feng Jing to suddenly suggest diluting her shares. Furthermore, she had asked Dong Yun to relay the message. She was obviously determined and did not want Xia ruofei to persuade her.

In fact, Feng Jing’s thinking was not unreasonable. After all, the market value of miles Pharmaceutical Group even exceeded that of paradise Corporation. After such a large corporation merged with paradise Corporation, it was equivalent to more than double its assets.

Most importantly, this “merger and acquisition” didn’t cost paradise Corporation a single cent. It was equivalent to Xia ruofei buying miles Corporation out of his own money and then merging with paradise Corporation.

Naturally, Feng Jing had no idea how much Xia ruofei had spent, much less that he had not spent any money at all. However, it was all the same to her. Xia ruofei had paid the price to get miles Corporation, and as the only other executive who had shares in the company, she couldn’t just sit back and watch her assets suddenly double.

Even if Xia ruofei didn’t say it, she couldn’t get over it. She was also worried that others would gossip.

Xia ruofei frowned and said,””We’ll talk about this later. The most important thing now is to take over the entire horizon and stabilize it.”

Dong Yun nodded.”I understand, director Xia. I’m just passing on a message for director Feng. You guys can decide on what to do.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

In reality, Dong Yun was very envious of Feng Jing. Even if it was just a single – digit amount, the shares she owned in paradise Corporation were still a huge sum of money.

The company’s market value alone was already impressive, and only a fool would cash out its market value. This was because anyone could see that paradise Corporation was still in a high – speed development stage, and the shares in their hands were becoming more and more valuable every day.

The company’s executives, including Dong Yun, were actually looking forward to the official establishment of the company’s equity pool and the beginning of distributing a small number of shares to the executives.

Xia ruofei said,”I’ll call President Feng personally. This matter will end here. Don’t tell anyone else.”

“I understand,” Dong Yun smiled and said,”CEO Xia, I’ve looked up the information on miles pharmaceutical. It’s a huge Pharmaceutical Group. It’ll be difficult for us to take over the whole company with just the power of a few people.”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s okay. I’ve already found reinforcements for you in the capital. They’re all trustworthy people. When the time comes, they’ll be added to the team and follow you to Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province to take over miles Corporation.”

Xia ruofei had already told elder song that the song family would send a capable team from the family business to help Dong Yun complete the handover of miles pharmaceutical.

The song family had a lot of elite talents in reserve. Whether it was in the legal or financial aspects, they had quite skilled talents. As the biggest opponent, the song family actually had a very comprehensive grasp of the Liu family’s business situation. With the song family’s people taking over, there was no need to worry about the Liu family playing any tricks.

Although the initiative was in Xia ruofei’s hands, and the possibility of the Liu family causing trouble was extremely small, it was always good to be cautious. After all, after vision pharmaceutical took over, they would be producing the jaded skin cream and heart nourishing soup in the future. The formula and production process of these two products were highly confidential. If either of them was leaked, it would cause immeasurable losses.

“It seems that you’ve already made arrangements, then I don’t have to worry anymore!” Dong Yun nodded.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”don’t worry!” After signing the share transfer agreement tomorrow, the helper I found for you will meet with you and go to Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province together. ”

“CEO Xia, do you have any specific instructions after taking over?” Dong Yun nodded.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”the first thing is to ensure a smooth handover. The second thing is to ensure absolute safety. The original management of miles pharmaceutical needs to be screened first. Those who don’t have a bottom line should all be dismissed. As for the lower – Level employees, they can be retained for the time being. However, they can not be randomly assigned to core positions in the future.”

Xia ruofei paused and continued,””In addition, after taking over, miles will no longer accept new orders. After the original orders are completed, they will temporarily stop production and prepare for transformation. “As for Xue Jinshan, tell him to quickly put down his work and meet up with you guys in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. His main task is to investigate all of miles ‘fixed assets, including land, factories, machinery, equipment, and so on. Then, come up with a transformation plan and budget as soon as possible. In the future, miles will completely convert to producing jadeshi ointment and heart – nourishing soup.”

Dong Yun quickly recorded it and nodded,”Understood!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ll just mention something about direction for now.” We’ll see how it’s going to be carried out step by step. If you have any uncertainties, you can call me at any time to report to me!”

“Alright!” Dong Yun replied.

“Alright, you’ve all been travel – worn, so don’t talk about work today!” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”you can choose to drink tea, watch a movie, or even go to the gym. There’s an activity room over there!”

“I think I’ll go help out in the kitchen with them!” Dong Yun said with a smile. Otherwise, there’s the suspicion of reaping without sowing!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”sure!” This can be considered as having fun with the people! I won’t be joining in the fun ...”
