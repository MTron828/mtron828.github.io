3242 A doctor’s parental heart (1)

Naturally, Elon Musk and gramus did not know that the reason little X was sleeping so soundly was because Xia ruofei had hypnotized him during the examination so that the child would not cry.

However, foreigners loved to hear auspicious words, so after hearing Xia ruofei’s words, they all smiled.

“I’ll leave everything to you, doctor Xia!”Said Elon Musk.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”my treatment plan is Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine.”

When elonmask heard this, he thought, isn’t this the same as treating the tinnitus just now?

Xia ruofei didn’t wait for him to speak. He smiled and said,””The disease is different, so the acupuncture points and techniques are different. As for Chinese medicine ... The prescription is definitely different. It’s like a surgery in Western medicine. Even though it’s still open abdominal surgery, removing the liver and the appendectomy are definitely different. ” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

When Elon Musk heard this, his hair stood on end. However, he understood what Xia ruofei meant. He nodded and said,””You’re a doctor, so we’ll listen to you ... By the way, do you need us to sign an informed consent form or something?”

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”No need for the trouble. I’ll perform acupuncture while the child is asleep.” Also, I need to make some Chinese medicine. I’ll write a list for you! Didn’t you send someone to buy medicine for you? Also, bring back the herbs I need. ”

“Alright! Alright!” “Yes!” Elon Musk said quickly and personally went to find a pen and paper.

Xia ruofei scribbled down the list. This time, there were more medicinal herbs on the list than before, and they were all in large quantities. If the Butler went there in a small car, the trunk would probably be filled.

This prescription was much more valuable than the one for tinnitus. Hence, Xia ruofei did not follow the prescription strictly. He added a lot of medicinal materials that were not actually used. In terms of quantity, every medicinal material was the same. Naturally, others could not deduce the prescription from this list.

Xia ruofei had prepared all the ingredients that would last for at least a week. Naturally, the amount was a little too much.

Xia ruofei passed the list to Elon Musk and said,””Other than the herbs, there are also some Chinese medicine boiling equipment. You should be able to buy them in the Chinese medicine shops in Chinatown. Just get someone to buy them and bring them back!”

“Alright! I’ll get it done immediately!”

In terms of the child’s treatment, Elon Musk was now completely obedient to Xia ruofei’s words. He quickly took a picture of the list and sent it to the Butler personally. Then, he called to give Xia ruofei more detailed instructions.

On the other hand, Xia ruofei took out the silver needles, disinfectant alcohol, cotton swabs, and other things from the first aid kit.

Xia ruofei was very familiar with little X’s condition. He had already come up with a perfect treatment plan during the examination just now.

By right, using the petals of the spirit Heart Flower directly would definitely be able to completely cure him.

However, this would be too easy and too shocking.

The illness itself was very dangerous, and even world – Class doctors could not guarantee that it would not relapse. Even if it was surgery, the child’s body might not be able to withstand it, and the follow – up chemotherapy was no exception.

However, Xia ruofei had just come up and fed the child some medicine, and he had recovered in a day. This was already beyond the scope of science. Even with the magic of Traditional Chinese Medicine, it could not be explained.

As for the second point! It was also because Xia ruofei’s medical skills had reached a certain level. Although it was difficult to treat patients with Strigoi using Traditional Chinese Medicine, it was still possible for Xia ruofei to alleviate the symptoms with his current medical skills.

This way, the ingredients of the spirit Heart Flower petals needed to be used could be reduced.

Xia ruofei wanted to save as much as he could, so he decided to go for traditional Chinese medicine treatment first.

Through the examination of his spiritual power, Xia ruofei knew the size, location, and spread of the tumor like the back of his hand.

The illness was quite serious, so Xia ruofei decided to use the nine cloud – rubbing needles. Only this long – Lost acupuncture technique could improve the condition.

As for the prescription, it was also from a precious lost medical book. Of course, Xia ruofei had adjusted the amount of medicinal herbs according to the child’s condition.

On the side, gramus hesitated and said,””Mr. Xia, the child is still sleeping ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”no problem!” It’s easier to perform the acupuncture when the child is asleep. He won’t move around! He’s so young, he must be sleeping most of the time. Don’t worry, acupuncture doesn’t hurt, he won’t be woken up. ”

“OK!”Grams took a step back and said,”we all believe in doctor Xia’s medical skills.”

Xia ruofei nodded.”Mr. Masker, there’s no need to keep so many people here. Please let everyone out!”

“Alright, we want to stay and watch, is that okay?” Elon Musk asked.

“Alright then!” Xia ruofei said.

“Thank you!” “Yes!” Elon Musk said quickly, and asked the nurse and nanny to leave the room for a while.

Xia ruofei unhurriedly undid the child’s clothes. His movements were very gentle. Little X, who was in a deep sleep, did not react at all. He was still sleeping soundly.

Xia ruofei took off the child’s shirt and took a small pillow. He turned the child’s body over so that he could lie on his side and put the small pillow under his body.
