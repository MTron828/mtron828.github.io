When song Rui saw that Zhuo Yiyi wasn’t very enthusiastic, he immediately brought up Xia ruofei without any sense of shame after betraying his friend.

“Of course I remember! Isn’t Wei Wei ... Hehe!” Zhuo Yiyi asked,”why did you mention him?”

“Ruofei has come to the capital! And I just bought a siheyuan in Beijing today. ” Song Rui said,”he wants to invite you to his new house as a guest! He was the one who told me to call you!”

“I see!” Zhuo Yiyi hesitated slightly before saying,”alright then! I’ll come over after work, send me your location!”

“Alright!” Song Rui snapped his fingers excitedly and said,”then work hard. I won’t disturb you ...” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

After hanging up, song Rui immediately opened WeChat and sent his current location to Zhuo Yiyi.

Seeing Zhuo Yiyi reply with an ‘OK’ emoji, song Rui grinned.

As he laughed, he felt that the atmosphere was not right. He turned around and saw Xia ruofei standing behind him with a murderous look.

Song Rui was so scared that he quickly stepped aside and asked,””What are you doing! You almost scared me to death!”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”not bad, song xiaorui!” You actually know how to use my name to pick up girls!”

Song Rui chuckled guiltily and said,””Who are we? Besides ... I’m not wrong! You’re the master today!”

“I’m the master. I don’t object to this. ” Xia ruofei looked at song Rui and said,”but when did I say that I was going to invite Zhuo Yiyi? and I even asked you to call her? How come I don’t have any impression of it?”

Song Rui smiled apologetically and said,”I thought I had no other choice?” Zhuo Yiyi wasn’t willing to come out, but come to think of it, your name is still the most useful! Really, you’re so influential. The moment I said you invited her, she agreed without a second thought!”

“Don’t you think it’s a little too late to be flattering me now?” Xia ruofei chuckled as he approached song Rui.

“Don’t ... Don’t come any closer!” Song Rui quickly stepped back and said,”I owe you a favor for this. State your conditions!” How do you want me to compensate you?”

Xia ruofei laughed.”That’s more like it. Your attitude is still correct!”

Then, he pondered for a moment and said,””How about this! If you do me a favor, I’ll write off this matter!”

“You say it, you say it!” Song Rui quickly said.

“I can’t live in Beijing for a long time. It’s such a big house, and there are a lot of valuable furniture and home appliances. The public security in Beijing isn’t so high that it can’t be blocked! That’s why I need a reliable person to help me look after my house. ” Xia ruofei said,”help me look around! It’s best if he’s a retired soldier. I’ll be more at ease using him. ”

Song Rui said subconsciously,”you should ask brother Zhao for help!” He knows many people in the Army ...”

Song Rui’s voice was getting softer and softer because Xia ruofei’s expression was getting unkind. He quickly said,””Alright, alright, alright! Leave this to me! I’ll definitely help you find the most suitable and reliable candidate!”

“This is more like it!” Xia ruofei patted song Rui’s shoulder in satisfaction and said,”since you’re so understanding, I won’t expose you in front of Zhuo Yiyi later ...”

Song Rui felt relieved and quickly said,””Thank you, thank you ...”

Wu shuheng had successfully liquidated the siheyuan and was about to receive the funds he urgently needed. He was in a very good mood and warmly invited Xia ruofei and the others to the second courtyard to make tea and chat.

Everyone sat down and chatted for a while, then Zhao Yongjun’s lawyer friend came over with a laptop.

He was a male lawyer in his thirties. His surname was du and he looked very capable.

As soon as lawyer du came over, he began to get down to business. First, he asked about the details of the transaction, then carefully checked Wu shuheng’s real estate certificate and Land certificate, and confirmed that there was no mortgage loan or mortgage that had not been paid off.

After he was done with the preparations, he immediately turned on his laptop and started to modify the contract.

In a short while, the house purchase contract was drawn up.

The location, area, the agreed price, the furniture, appliances, and other facilities of the transaction house were all reflected in the purchase contract in detail.

There were two copies of the contract. Xia ruofei and Wu shuheng read every clause from the beginning to the end very carefully. After confirming that there were no problems, both parties signed the contract.

Zhao Yongjun, as the middleman, also signed the contract.

The deal that involved more than 100 million Yuan was officially settled.

Originally, the real estate lawyer still had a lot of follow – up work, but in this transaction, lawyer du did not need to do anything.

As both parties trusted each other, Xia ruofei was not prepared to transfer the money to the shared account and then transfer it to Wu shuheng’s account after the transfer of the house.

Since Wu shuheng was in need of money, Xia ruofei brought him to a nearby bank after the contract was signed and transferred 136 million Yuan to him.

In fact, even though the transfer procedure was not completed, the siheyuan already belonged to Xia ruofei.

He had spent more than half of the 180 million he had earned from selling the king’s Green in the morning.

Naturally, Wu shuheng was very grateful to Xia ruofei. After receiving the money, he immediately transferred it to the overseas company’s account to solve the urgent situation.
