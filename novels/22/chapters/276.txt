Chapter 277: Who’s the professional between the two of us?

Elder song smiled kindly and asked,””There’s no need for lunch. We’ll get off at Mount Wuyi.” The business class seats provided free meals, but the train dining car was not open all day long. Lunch sets were only provided at fixed times. Elder song and the others only took a little more than an hour to get to Mount Wu Yi. They could arrive at the destination at around 10 O’ clock, so they naturally did not need to eat lunch on the train. In fact, even if they wanted to eat in the car, there was no lunch provided in the dining car at this time. The beautiful flight attendant smiled and nodded. She then asked,””What kind of drink would you like? We have coffee, Coke, black tea, green tea ...” Elder song thought for a moment and smiled.”How about a cup of black tea? I’ll also experience the meals of our China’s high – speed rail. ” Hearing this, Xu Wu’s expression changed slightly. He reminded in a low voice,””Chief, we have prepared our own food and drinks ...” According to the rules, a bureau chief like elder song was not allowed to eat any food that had not been tested. Especially since they were traveling in plain clothes this time, there were many procedures that could not be strictly checked. There was no guarantee that the drinks provided on the train were absolutely safe. Most of the people who could buy business class tickets were either rich or powerful. The train attendants did not have much reaction to the term “chief”. After all, the term “chief” was actually very common in China, especially in the Army. Company and battalion chiefs were actually just basic cadres of the company and Battalion positions. Therefore, the flight attendant only smiled and waited for elder song’s answer. Elder song was also a little hesitant. It wasn’t that he was too timid to even drink a drink on the high – speed rail, but he didn’t want to put the staff around him in a difficult position. However, it could be seen that elder song’s low – Key trip this time was actually more to understand the People’s feelings. He had the intention to experience some things that were usually difficult to come into contact with. “Sir, since you want to experience it, then choose a drink to try!” Xia ruofei said. “RUO Fei ...” Xu Wu was shocked. “I’m fine!” Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”I know what I’m doing!” “Good, good, good!” Eccentric song chuckled. Since Xiao Xia has approved it, then ... Little comrade, give me a cup of black tea! Black tea is good for the stomach. ” “Alright,” he said. The flight attendant smiled and asked Xia ruofei,”Sir, what would you like to order?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Coke!” I’ll have to trouble you!” “Alright!” The flight attendant said. Without waiting for the flight attendant to ask, Xu Wu said directly,””I don’t need it, thank you!” Elder song and Xia ruofei had ordered drinks from the high – speed rail. According to the work procedure, Xu Wu would definitely not order any more. After the flight attendant left, Xu Wu said worriedly,””Bureau chief, the safety of the food on the high – speed rail can’t be guaranteed! You ...” Xia ruofei interrupted Xu Wu with a smile and said,””Xu Can, don’t worry! With me around, even if there’s something wrong with the drink, nothing will happen. ” Elder song laughed and said,”Xu, have you forgotten what Xia’s job is?” You don’t need to worry with a little Divine Doctor like him around!” “But ...” Xu Wu said,”we don’t have to take this risk ...” Xia ruofei said with confidence,”Xu Can, I know what you’re worried about.” In fact, the possibility of this flight attendant being suspicious was extremely low. First of all, the Bureau chief’s trip this time was strictly confidential, and the scope of knowledge was very small. The possibility of the enemy forces setting up a trap in advance was not high. Secondly, from the moment we got on the train, this train attendant has come into contact with eight train and station staff, including the train conductor, the train police, the station dispatch, and other train attendants. I’ve also observed her working condition and found no flaws. In other words, the possibility of this flight attendant being planted by an enemy force is extremely low. In that case, the risk of poisoning the food is almost negligible. ” Xu Wu was dumbfounded. He had been focusing on safety issues since he got in the car. He did not expect Xia ruofei to be so meticulous and analyze all the possibilities. “Xia, it looks like you haven’t forgotten anything about your professional skills after leaving the Army!” Elder song laughed. “Professional habits can’t be changed in a short time.” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Xu Wu forced a smile and said,”ruofei, are all lone Wolf’s men this perverted?” It’s a good thing you’ve left the Army. Otherwise, I’m really worried that you’d steal my job ...” Elder song couldn’t help but burst out laughing. Xia ruofei said humbly,”actually, all the analysis and judgments can’t be 100% accurate. The reason why I have the confidence to let the chief come into contact with food of unknown origin is that I’m confident. Even if there’s a problem with the food, I can guarantee the chief’s life, health, and safety through traditional Chinese medicine.” Xu Wu touched his forehead and weakly said,””It’s already abnormal enough, okay? I really don’t know which of us is the professional security guard ...” Elder song laughed and teased,”Lil Xu, you’ve seen the difference. Take this opportunity to learn from Lil Xia!” In any case, he won’t be able to use his skills in the future, so you should give him some benefits and let him teach you everything!” “Yes! We must carry out the Bureau chief’s instructions!” Xu Wu immediately said half – jokingly,”ruofei, the chief has already given instructions. You can’t hide your strength!” “The chief even said that you’ll give me some benefits!” Xia ruofei rolled his eyes and said,”I’ll see how sincere you are then!” “Hahaha!” Eccentric song laughed heartily. In fact, Xu Wu was like most of the Bureau chief’s personal guards. He was a man of few words. However, he got along very well with Xia ruofei. In addition, he had been working for elder song for several years. This time, it was a mission in plain clothes, so he rarely joked around. As the three of them chatted, the flight attendant served the drinks that elder song and Xia ruofei had ordered. “Thank you!” Elder song said to the flight attendant kindly. Then, he looked at the steaming hot black tea and said with a smile,””Then I’ll have a taste of the drinks on our China’s high – speed rail!” Elder song picked up the cup holder and took a sip.””Very good! The taste is very good!” In fact, elder song had tasted all kinds of tea before. What kind of expensive tea could there be on this high – speed train? But what the old man was experiencing was this kind of novelty. After listening to Xia ruofei’s analysis, Xu Wu was not as nervous as before. However, he still stared at elder song, worried that there was something wrong with the black tea. It turned out that he had worried too much. Elder song drank the entire cup of black tea as he chatted leisurely. He didn’t feel uncomfortable at all. Elder song looked out of the window at the fields and rivers that flashed by quickly and said with emotion,””Our country’s development is really changing with each passing day! “Nowadays, there are already world – Class high – speed railways and high – speed trains. In the past, it would take a day to travel from the three mountains to the Wuyi Mountains by train. Now, the high – speed train can reach it in more than an hour.” “Yup!” Xia ruofei nodded in agreement. China’s high – speed rail technology was indeed world – Class. They had already built high – speed railways and sold high – speed trains for many third world countries. As Chinese, they were full of pride. Elder song continued,”back in the days when our Army went south, we didn’t even have enough trucks, let alone high – speed trains. Most of the soldiers had to rely on their legs to get there.” When our Army entered min, the first County we liberated was Mount Wu Yi. At that time, it was still called Chong an County ...” As eccentric song spoke, his eyes revealed a look of reminiscence. Xia ruofei was even more certain that elder song had a deep relationship with Wuyi Mountain. Ever since he left the Gu Ling courtyard, he had been feeling a little impatient. Xia ruofei and Xu Wu tactfully remained silent and did not disturb the old man. The train headed north. At around 10 O’ clock, the streamlined harmony arrived at the Wuyi Eastern Railway Station on time and slowly stopped on the platform.
