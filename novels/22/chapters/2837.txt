2838 Half – heartedly doing things_

“What are you going to do?” Xia ruofei asked with great interest.

“Don’t even think about getting away with it!” Zhou leiyun said,”the public opinion is pretty much one – sided right now. They’re all supporting us! There was still a lot of doubt whether they had deliberately faked it! President Xia, I would like the club to hold a press conference immediately to severely condemn The Sports Daily and strongly request them to apologize to the club. Otherwise, we reserve the right to file a lawsuit because they have already caused a great negative impact on the club’s reputation!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”We’re standing on the side of the victim and justice. There’s nothing wrong with what we’re doing. No one can blame us.”

Then, Xia ruofei changed the topic and said,””However, I still suggest that we don’t rush things. It’s still the same saying...Let public opinion fly a little longer!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Zhou leiyun was slightly taken aback, and asked in confusion,””President Xia, The Sports Daily is clearly unafraid of anything. Anyway, they don’t admit that they made fake news. As for the so – called flaws in the audit, they didn’t respond no matter how the public criticized them. This public opinion will eventually pass. When we hold a press conference again, won’t it lose the popularity it has now?”

“Public opinion will naturally pass. There’s no time to maintain a high level of attention.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”but in my opinion, the public opinion this time is far from reaching its peak.”

“Oh?” Zhou leiyun asked with interest,”President Xia, do you think there will be any new developments in the future?”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”of course!” Now that The Sports Daily had thrown out such a perfunctory statement, it could be considered that they had given the public an explanation. Pablo also left dejectedly. If he were smart, he would not jump out at this time to attract criticism, but Barcelona could not play dead, could it? They could pretend that they did not see the news media’s farce, but the core of this matter was the ‘fountain’ incident at nokapu Stadium! Now that we’ve thrown out the evidence, it’s already solid! Could they pretend that nothing had happened? Wouldn’t that damage the image of the universe team? So, Barca will definitely come out with a crisis public relations!”

“That makes sense ...” Zhou leiyun said thoughtfully.

“Also, don’t forget that there’s still a key figure in this matter!” Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s that so – called balsa annual pass member, Mayers.” According to The Sports Daily, Meyers was a die – hard fan of bar?a and had lied in an interview to protect the image of the home team. How credible was this explanation? Would Mayers accept this explanation? What was the real situation? No one knows. ”

Zhou leiyun furrowed his brows and said,”even if he’s a fake fan hired by Pablo, he can’t possibly show up and explain himself!” One is paid to fabricate fake news, and the other is lying to protect Barcelona’s image because he loves Barcelona too much. As long as there’s nothing wrong with his brain, he’ll definitely accept the second explanation!”

“But we don’t even know if Mayers is a member of Barca! In other words, many situations are still unknown ” Xia ruofei said,”will Barca respond? When was he going to respond? How would they respond? What was the real identity of Mayers? Was there a deal between Pablo and him? Did the higher – ups of The Sports Daily know about this? These things aren’t clear yet, so I suggest that we postpone our press conference for the time being and let the public opinion fly a little longer! I believe that the resourceful reporters will be persistent in their digging. By then, we might be able to find out the truth without any effort!”

Zhou leiyun said,”director Xia, you mean that we should wait and see. We’ll see how Barcelona will respond. We’ll also see what’s going on with that Mayers. Once these things are clear, our press conference can be more targeted, right?”

“This is what I meant!” Xia ruofei said,”I don’t think it’ll take too long. One day at most!” If bar?a is so inefficient, how could it have become one of the world’s top super clubs?”

“Alright! Then I’ll listen to you!” Zhou leiyun said readily.

“Also ... When we have a press conference, I’ll be there personally!” Xia ruofei continued.

Zhou leiyun could not help but be taken aback. He could not help but ask,””President Xia, haven’t you always wanted to keep a low profile? Why did you suddenly ...”

Xia ruofei grinned and said,”that’s because I didn’t want to cooperate with Pablo’s publicity. Now that he’s made a mess of himself and his reputation is ruined, it’s only natural that I hit him when he’s down!” And I have another purpose for attending the press conference. You’ll know when the time comes!”

When Zhou leiyun heard this, he knew that Xia ruofei was about to announce something. He was also very curious, but since Xia ruofei did not want to say it, he could not press on.

“Understood!” Zhou leiyun smiled and said,”then we’ll wait another day or two! I’ll tell them to make preparations in advance!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said,”there’s nothing much today. Qingxue and Weiwei were a little tired yesterday, so they’re going to rest in the hotel today.”

“Do you want to go out for a walk?” Zhou leiyun smiled mysteriously and said,”I know a few places in Barcelona that are not bad! A lot of men lingered there! President Xia, do you want me to bring you out for some fresh meat?”

Xia ruofei said,”I’m not in the mood!” I’ll leave the foreign meat to you, director Zhou!”

Speaking of fresh meat, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but think of Monica.

Speaking of which, Spain and Italy were not far. The actual distance was equivalent to the distance between two provinces in China.

It had been a while since he had contacted Monica. He wondered how she was doing now. He should be busy! After all, he was now the head of the family ...

“President Xia! President Xia!”

Zhou leiyun’s voice jolted Xia ruofei out of his reverie.

“Ah?” Xia ruofei said,”sorry, I was a little distracted! Where was I just now?”

“You said that your two friends aren’t going out today,” Zhou leiyun said with a smile.”They’re resting in the hotel.”

“Oh, right!” Xia ruofei said,”I’m fine. I’ve been to Barcelona more than once and I’ve visited all the places I should visit ... So I think I’ll just go to the training base today! I’ll train with everyone and take it as a form of exercise!”

Zhou leiyun was a little surprised, and said,””Training?”

The training load for professional teams was quite large, especially for the top European League clubs. Because of the fast pace of the game and the high intensity of confrontation, the physical requirements were also very high.

Who would go train for fun?

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’m just going to relax. Don’t you know my stamina?” How tiring could the team’s training be? Besides, I haven’t seen my teammates since the game that day. Since I have nothing to do today, I’ll go and see everyone!”

“So that’s how it is!” Zhou leiyun said. No problem! I’ll get the club to send a car to pick you up! But I won’t be accompanying you to the training base today! I have a business meeting today, the kind that I can’t turn down ...”

“Go and do your work!” Xia ruofei said,”don’t let the club send a car. I want to go out by myself! I just strolled over!”

“How can I ...”

“It’s decided! The hotel isn’t far from the training base, I just want to see the scenery!” Xia ruofei said,”director Zhou, don’t ask for cars! I’ll be leaving the hotel in a while. I don’t want the driver to miss me. ”

When Zhou leiyun heard that, he could only say helplessly,””Okay then ... If there’s anything you need, just give me a call!”

“Don’t worry!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”at least my Spanish is better than yours! I can’t lose it!”
