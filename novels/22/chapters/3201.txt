There was a brief silence in the recording room.

In the end, it was Liu Mansha who broke the silence. She calmly said,”Fellow Daoist Xia, I’d like to listen to the remaining versions of the song!”

“Yes,” Mu Sheng nodded and said,”let’s finish the rest of the song!”

Xia ruofei knew what these two golden core intermediate stage seniors were thinking. They were not willing to give up and thought that the effect of the song might vary from person to person. What if a later version of the song could also make them enter that wonderful state?

Xia ruofei knew that the possibility of this was very low. He had a feeling that the song was the only correct answer and that it would not appear again.

However, since the two of them had made this request, he could not reject them. It was just a matter of spending more time. Anyway, he had already found the song and Xia ruofei naturally would not object to listening to the last few songs.

“No problem!” He nodded.

With that, Xia ruofei walked into the screening room.

Liu Mansha and Mu Sheng didn’t change seats. They were still sitting in Yu xiner and mu Jianfei’s seats.

Xia ruofei operated the music arrangement software and started playing the 20th song.

The melodious music started playing in the theater again. Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha listened attentively, but to their disappointment, they did not enter that wonderful state.

At the end of the song, no one spoke.

Xia ruofei didn’t say anything and played the 21st song.

After the song finished playing, Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha still didn’t have any reaction.

Then it was the 22nd song, the 23rd song ...

In a short while, all 26 songs were played.

When the last note of the last song ended and the recording studio fell silent again, Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha finally gave up. They looked at each other and smiled bitterly.

Mu Sheng sighed and said,”how could this be?” Why is it that even Jian Fei is able to react to the tune, but Valley master Liu and I can ‘t?”

Mu Jianfei’s expression was strange. He felt that there was something wrong with his father’s words.

“Seniors, is it because your cultivation is too high?” Chen Xuan asked after some thought.”You two are the only two intermediate golden core cultivators here today. The strongest of us left is only at the early golden core stage ...”

After Chen Xuan finished, he looked at Xia ruofei. Even though both of them were in the early golden core stage, he had to admit that Xia ruofei was much stronger than him. The person with the highest cultivation was naturally Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei did not agree with Chen Xuan’s judgment.

Although he was only in the early stage of the Aurous core stage, he was not weaker than a cultivator in the middle stage of the Aurous core stage. In terms of his psyche, he was not weaker than a cultivator in the late stage of the Aurous core stage.

If one’s cultivation had reached the intermediate stage of the Golden elixir realm or even higher, he would not be able to react to the music. Xia ruofei felt that he might be like Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha.

Liu Mansha smiled bitterly and asked,”is there a restriction on cultivation?” And it’s just a limit, how could there be such a thing?”

If the song didn’t work when one’s cultivation reached or exceeded the intermediate stage of the Golden core realm, it would be a bit of a scam.

Moreover, mu Jianfei, Yu Xin ‘er, and Ling Qingxue were all Qi refining cultivators. In other words, there was only an upper limit to their cultivation level, and they didn’t go offline. That was even more ridiculous.

It was as if it was tailor – made for Liu Mansha and Mu Sheng.

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said,””This is just brother Chen’s guess. We don’t know what the truth is, so we can only analyze it again ... But I personally think that it may not be a limit on cultivation or even the level of music theory of the cultivators. Valley master Liu and Wei Wei’s attainments in music theory are definitely higher than mine.”

Ling Qingxue nodded.”I agree with RUO Fei’s deduction. I know nothing about music, and Wei Wei is much better than me. However, the truth is that she has no reaction to this song. As for me, I was quickly immersed in that scene when the first note was played.”

Song Wei was also feeling a little depressed. In the process of deciphering the music score, she had played the biggest role. In the final 19th song, most of the details were handled according to Song Wei’s speculation, and the facts proved that her speculation was very accurate.

However, even if her analysis was accurate, it would be useless. When the music was played, she could only appreciate the beautiful tune like a bystander, but she could not immerse herself in the wonderful scene like Ling Qingxue.

“Brother Xia, I can basically confirm that tune No. 19 is the correct answer.” However, there are still a lot of questions, including the situation of senior mu and senior Liu. They are also very puzzling, so ...”

At this point, Chen Xuan paused for a moment and scanned the room before continuing,””My suggestion is to prepare for both eventualities. On one hand, we should seize the time to study some key information in that wonderful scene and strive to completely crack the secret of the token as soon as possible. On the other hand, we also need to further confirm what kind of criteria this song has for selecting its listeners. ”

Xia ruofei nodded.”I agree with brother Chen’s opinion. Regarding the first question, there are five of us who have experienced that scene. Let’s sit down and discuss it over the next two days. I think we can learn something. As for the second question, do you have any good ideas, brother Chen?”
