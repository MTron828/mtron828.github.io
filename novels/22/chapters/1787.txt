Chapter 1788: Can’t help it (2)

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power had once again surpassed his own genuine Qi cultivation.

And all of this had actually happened without him being aware of it! One must know that Qi disciple Level 6 was a small threshold. If one cultivated normally, it would not be easy to break through this bottleneck.

Since when did breaking through become as easy as eating and drinking?

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but have a strong interest in the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra”.

However, now was not the time to think about this, because Song Wei, who was sitting opposite him, slowly opened her eyes.

Xia ruofei also noticed that Song Wei’s Qi refining stage was only at Level 4!

With his own example as a reference, Xia ruofei was not too surprised. In the cultivation of the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra”, the one with lower cultivation would get more benefits. If he could use this cultivation to break through the bottleneck of Qi disciple Level 6, then wouldn’t it be normal for Song Wei to break through one level?

Moreover, Song Wei’s spiritual power had already reached the middle stage of the spirit throb realm. In terms of true Qi cultivation, she was equivalent to Qi disciple Level 5.

Previously, Song Wei’s spiritual power cultivation was behind her true energy cultivation, but this time, it had surpassed her.

This meant that the new cultivation method of the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” that the two of them had discovered by chance seemed to be of greater help to their mental power cultivation.

Of course, Xia ruofei had no time to think about it. He had to think about how to face Song Wei.

Song Wei, who was blushing, glanced at Xia ruofei and avoided his gaze in a panic.

She wanted to cry but had no tears. She had wanted to cut off all contact with Xia ruofei, which was why she was so determined to deal with the peach blossom miasma in advance. However, he didn’t expect that such a thing would happen in his sea of consciousness ...

Even though Song Wei was still a Virgin in terms of her physical body, the erotic scenes in her sea of consciousness were still vivid in her mind.

Moreover, the thrill that made her soul tremble had left an indelible mark in her heart.

In fact, Xia ruofei felt the same way. Even though they did not have any physical contact, the intimate contact of their souls was even more deadly, okay? It was simply addictive!

What was worse was that because of the intimate relationship on the spiritual level, Xia ruofei seemed to have a very close feeling towards Song Wei. This feeling was very similar to the feeling he had towards Ling Qingxue, or perhaps even stronger ...

As for Song Wei, her heart was already attached to Xia ruofei. Now that the two of them had developed this relationship, she was even more entranced.

Actually, Song Wei had wanted to clench her teeth and leave. After all, the peach blossom miasma’s hidden danger had been completely eliminated. Everything was going according to her wishes, as long as she did not contact Xia ruofei in the future.

However, she couldn’t bring herself to do it. Even the thought of it made her feel so much pain that she wanted to die. Tears were about to fall, and her heart was in so much pain that it felt like it was being pricked by needles.

How did this happen? Song Wei was at a loss.

The two of them didn’t know what to say, and the silence made the atmosphere even more awkward ...

“I ...”

“I ...”

The two of them spoke at the same time, as if the tacit understanding of cultivating the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” still existed. They either didn’t speak, or they both spoke when they opened their mouths.

“You go first!” Xia ruofei quickly said.

Song Wei’s chest heaved up and down. In the end, she took a deep breath and gritted her teeth.”What happened today was just an accident! You’d better forget it! I ... I’ll be leaving first!”

After she finished speaking, Song Wei quickly stood up and walked out of the door. The moment she turned her back to Xia ruofei, her face was already covered in tears.

It was a sorrow that came from the depths of her soul. No matter how strong the moral constraints of the world were, no matter how rational Song Wei was, she could not suppress this emotion.

Xia ruofei felt as if a knife had been stabbed into his heart. The excruciating pain made the muscles on his face tremble.

Xia ruofei realized that after Song Wei left, the two of them might not meet again.

As soon as he thought of this possibility, Xia ruofei felt as if the sky had turned dark.

He did not hesitate and stood up subconsciously. He caught up with Song Wei and hugged her from behind.

Song Wei’s delicate body trembled violently. Then, as if all her strength had been sucked out of her body, she fell limply into Xia ruofei’s arms and started sobbing silently.

Xia ruofei’s actions had shown his attitude.

Song Wei already had feelings for Xia ruofei. In addition, they had a strange combination in the sea of consciousness. She should be very happy. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

However, she was in a very complicated mood at the moment.

On one hand, she was secretly happy, but on the other hand, she was constantly being condemned by her morals. It was as if a voice kept saying in her heart,”You’re the third party! What a shameful third party!

Xia ruofei did not say anything. He just quietly hugged Song Wei’s delicate body. The expression on his face was extremely complicated.

Compared to Song Wei’s dilemma, Xia ruofei felt more guilty.

In reality, he had also had a one night stand with Monica. However, he did not fall in love with Monica. It was more of a physical attraction. This time, strictly speaking, Xia ruofei did not physically betray Ling Qingxue. However, the situation was more serious than the physical betrayal.

Xia ruofei’s mind was in a mess ...

Song Wei was conflicted for a long time, but in the end, she decided to follow her heart.
