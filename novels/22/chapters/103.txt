“Mr. Xia, distinguished guests, this is our store’s latest Taoyuan vegetable series. Please enjoy!” Branch Manager Lin tried to make his voice sound calmer and forced a smile. His intestines were about to turn green from regret. Although he had followed manager Xu’s instructions to open the private room in Linjiang Pavilion, he still felt very uneasy. After much thought, he couldn’t help but sneak out and call Ling Xiaotian to report the matter. He did not expect that once Ling Xiaotian heard that it was Xia ruofei, he would immediately order him to do his best to ensure the service and that all expenses tonight would be free. This was not a big deal. Ling Xiaotian was the boss anyway, and the loss of the bill was not his own money. However, what Ling Xiaotian ordered next made store manager Lin want to cry but had no tears. Ling Xiaotian had asked him to prepare Taoyuan vegetables for Xia ruofei’s table, and to serve each dish. Recently, the Paradise brand vegetables of the Ling Ji restaurant chain had become their well – known signboard. Many gluttons from other places came to try it, bringing a lot of popularity to the Ling Ji restaurant. Branch Manager Lin had also applied for many days before he managed to “snatch” a few catties of shares from several flagship stores in the city to Hongtian restaurant. He had originally wanted to use Taoyuan vegetables to boost his sales. He did not expect that Ling Xiaotian would give half of his daily share to Xia ruofei’s table with just one sentence. Moreover, it was provided for free. However, he didn’t dare to disobey the big boss’s orders. He could only tell the kitchen to hurry up and cook with a sad face. Xia ruofei’s classmates did not feel anything. Although many of them had heard of the Taoyuan vegetables, they did not have a direct understanding of their value. Even Yuan Lili thought it was Xia ruofei who had arranged the menu. Only Liu Hang’s eyes narrowed slightly when he heard the words “Taoyuan vegetables.” He often went out to socialize, so he naturally knew about the recently famous Taoyuan vegetables. Moreover, he even went to Ling Ji restaurant to try it out. However, he didn’t get what he wanted even after two visits. Now that paradise vegetables was too popular, unless he had an internal relationship, he would still need to make a reservation many days in advance to go to Ling Ji restaurant. He was just a small section Chief of the district Civil Affairs Bureau, so he did not have that much face. He did not expect Xia ruofei to have such power even though he did not show off. Liu Hang could not help but secretly look at Xia ruofei, who was still calm and collected. Many thoughts flashed through his mind. “Thank you, Branch Manager Lin.” Xia ruofei said with a gentle smile. Then, he said to Yuan Lili and the others,”students, let’s try the cooking of the chef of Hongtian restaurant!” It was a dish of stir – fried spinach. The green spinach looked particularly attractive on the White porcelain plate. The appearance of the Paradise vegetables had always been excellent, and it was very easy to arouse people’s appetite. Everyone responded one after another. Everyone picked up a piece of spinach and put it in their mouths, even Liu Hang. After tasting it, everyone’s expression became rich and colorful. After chewing and swallowing, they couldn’t stop praising the taste of the Paradise vegetables. “A few days ago, a colleague ate paradise vegetables at Ling Ji restaurant and bragged about it to us after he came back. I finally got to taste it today!” Guan Ping said excitedly,”I can only say that I’ve wronged that colleague. He wasn’t bragging at all, it was really delicious!” “I’ve been hearing people talking about Taoyuan vegetables these days. I only realized how delicious they are after I tried them today!” Pang Hao also said. A female classmate said remorsefully,””Aiya! I actually forgot to take a picture and post it on my moments. It’s not easy to eat paradise vegetables, so I’d be letting myself down if I didn’t post it on my moments to show off!” This female student’s words immediately resonated with several other students. Everyone felt that it was a pity because there was not much of the spinach left. At this moment, store manager Lin hurriedly said,”dear distinguished guests, there are five more dishes. All of them are high – Quality vegetables from paradise. You can take as many photos as you want.” “Oh, really? That’s great, that’s great!” “Don’t move! Let’s talk after I’m done taking the photos!” “Same beat, same beat!” Xia ruofei found it funny that his classmates were so excited. He smiled at Branch Manager Lin and said,””Branch Manager Lin, I’ll have to trouble you. Please convey my gratitude to President Ling!” “You’re welcome ...” Branch Manager Lin said quickly.”I’ll go to the kitchen to rush you. Please wait a moment ...” With that, store manager Lin bowed slightly to the crowd and left the private room. As soon as store manager Lin left, these middle school students focused their attention on Xia ruofei. If the incident in the private room just now had surprised them, then the Taoyuan vegetables had really shocked them. Xia ruofei had always wanted to keep a low profile, but things just happened to be so coincidental. Today, Yuan Lili was treating him to dinner, so he didn’t want to overshadow the host. He raised his glass with a smile and said,”Students, don’t forget today’s main topic! I suggest that we all give a toast to Yuan Lili and wish her a happy marriage!” “Good! Congratulations!” “Come, cheers!” Yuan Lili raised her cup and said with a smile,”Thank you, ruofei. Thank you, everyone!” Everyone drank a glass of wine together. After a while, the remaining Taoyuan brand vegetables were served one by one. Everyone naturally took pictures from various angles and then ate together. Even though Xia ruofei had intentionally led the topic to Yuan Lili, he still inevitably became the focus of the crowd. Even Yuan Lili herself had specially toasted Xia ruofei several times. After everyone entered society, it was inevitable that they would become more realistic than before. In comparison, Xia ruofei, who had been in the Army for seven years, did not have the aura of a profiteer. He had always been indifferent to money. Of course, this was also because he had a killing weapon like the spirit map scroll, so he didn’t have to worry about money. They had enjoyed the luxurious Riverview Suite, the red wine that Ling Xiaotian had secretly stashed away, and the vegetables that were as popular as the sun in the sky. Xia ruofei’s junior high school classmates were naturally quite satisfied. Only Liu Hang was silent throughout the whole process. Even when he was tasting the delicious Taoyuan vegetables, he was absent – minded and looked at his phone from time to time. Guan Ping, who was sitting beside Xia ruofei, nudged him and whispered,””You’re pretty fast, kid! He’s even meeting his parents!” Xia ruofei was confused and asked,””What parent – Teacher meeting? What parent – Teacher meeting?” “You’re still pretending, aren’t you?” Guan Ping smiled mysteriously and said,”didn’t you go back with the school Belle to meet her parents? President Ling is so good to you. Tonight’s arrangement is simply meticulous!”
