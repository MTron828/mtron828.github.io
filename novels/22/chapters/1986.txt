1987 I’m going to find her (2)

Zhao Yongjun became serious and said,””What is it? As long as it’s within my means, I’ll definitely do it!”

“I need a complete set of personal information, including an ID card, a passport, and so on.” Xia ruofei said,”these documents have to be real. Also, I need to get a tourist visa to Italy as soon as possible. Can you think of a way to use these documents?”

When it came to leaving the country, Xia ruofei could not use the fake ID printed on the street advertisements. Not only did he need a full set of real identity information, but this information had to be stored in the database. Otherwise, it would be meaningless.

Only Zhao Yongjun and the others could do something like this.

“What happened?” Zhao Yongjun quickly asked.

Xia ruofei said,”brother Zhao, I have something urgent to attend to Italy. It’s best if I don’t go out with my identity. Don’t ask me about other things. If I can tell you, I will.”

“Okay, then I won’t ask ...” Zhao Yongjun said,”but you’ll make us worried. You’re in such a hurry to go to Italy and you have to change your identity ... The public security there hasn’t been very good recently, and murder on the street has been happening all the time!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”don’t worry!” It’s not like I’m going to fight with a gang, it’s just that it’s not convenient for me to go out with my identity. Every day, a large number of people go there for travel, and after all, there are only a few accidents! Besides, I’m from the Special Forces, how can I not even guarantee my own safety?”

“That’s true ...” Zhao Yongjun relaxed a little, then he muttered,”how about this! I’ll help you think of a way. It shouldn’t be a big problem. Just wait for my good news!”

“Thanks!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll bring you some good wine the next time I come to the capital!”

“Hahaha! I was just waiting for you to say that!” Zhao Yongjun smiled and said,”Oh right, I need a photo to get these documents. Send me a copy!”

“Time is tight. I’ll take a picture with my phone, and you can help me find someone to fix it!” Xia ruofei said.

“That works too!” “Send it to me as soon as possible!” Zhao Yongjun said.

After hanging up, Xia ruofei opened the camera function on his phone.

What happened next, if there was anyone else in the room, their jaws would have dropped.

A wig and a pair of gold – rimmed glasses appeared out of thin air in Xia ruofei’s hands. After he put them on, his facial muscles and bones began to shift. In a short while, his face had completely changed. Even if Zhao Yongjun and the others were standing in front of him, they would not be able to recognize him.

Then, Xia ruofei’s phone floated away. It slowly turned around and the rear camera was aimed at him.

Now that Xia ruofei’s spiritual power was much stronger than before, he could control small objects like phones with great precision.

He could even use his mental power to “see” the effect of the composition on the phone screen opposite him, then control the phone to adjust the position, and then directly use his mental power to touch the side button of the quick photo.

“Crack,””crack,””crack ...”

Xia ruofei took a few photos before he waved his hand and took back his phone.

After choosing a photo, Xia ruofei sent it to Zhao Yongjun.

Then, Xia ruofei pulled out the handle of the small suitcase. With one hand holding the handle and the other on his phone, he was ready to call Cheng Xiaoxiao and tell her to go to the airport together.

Just then, Zhao Yongjun called again.

“Big brother Zhao! Did you receive the photos?” Xia ruofei asked.

“I’ve received it!” Zhao Yongjun said,”ruofei, this ... This photo, it’s best if you use your own. Otherwise, you can’t use it even if you have your id! It doesn’t look right ...”

Xia ruofei held back his laughter and said,”it’s okay, we’ll use this photo!” Big brother Zhao, just do as you wish!”

“Isn’t ... Isn’t this nonsense?” Zhao Yongjun didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”You’d better think about it. If this photo is used and it’s added to the database, it’ll be difficult to change it ...”

“Don’t worry! When have I ever done something I’m not confident in?” Xia ruofei said,”Oh right, just give me an address. As for the name ... I’ll be called ... Xia Tian. What do you think?” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Since it was a different identity, Xia ruofei definitely could not use his own name. However, he did not want to change his surname, so he made up an alias.

“As long as you think it’s nice!” Zhao Yongjun said. RUO Fei, I’ll confirm with you one last time. Shall we use the photo you sent just now to make the ID card?”

“I’m very sure!” Xia ruofei said.

“Alright then!” Zhao Yongjun said helplessly,”I’ll get it done as soon as possible. Wait for my news!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said,”Oh right, don’t forget about the visa.”

“Don’t worry! I can’t forget!” Zhao Yongjun said.

After hanging up, Xia ruofei called Cheng Xiaoxiao and asked her to go downstairs to check out. The two of them would meet in the hotel lobby.

Then, he dragged his suitcase and left the Presidential Suite.

The Butler, Tony, quickly came forward. Xia ruofei said,””Tony, I’m going to check out. Thank you for your thoughtful service over the past few days. There’s a little thank you gift for you under the fruit plate in the reception room.”
