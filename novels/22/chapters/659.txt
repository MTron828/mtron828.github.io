Chapter 660: The shocked Jianghua (3)

This was only the first batch, and he could already recover all his investment costs!

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Jiang Hua, these are not the United States rays you’re familiar with. Do you have the confidence to take care of them?”

Jiang Hua hesitated for a moment, then immediately puffed out his chest and said,”President Xia, no problem! In fact, the breeding method of the United States pomfrets was based on the habits of the Chinese pomfrets in the Yangtze River, so that they could adapt to freshwater environments. I’ll pay close attention to the clam fish during the breeding process. I’m confident that I can make them grow up healthily!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.”I’m giving them to you. Each fish is worth thousands of gold!” As long as you do your best, I won’t blame you if anything happens. ”

The Yangtze salamander fish were extremely precious in Jiang Hua’s eyes, but it was nothing to Xia ruofei. As long as the spirit map space was there, there would be an endless stream of fish.

If it was not for the purpose of hiding, Xia ruofei would not even need to build this breeding workshop. The river in the new space was enough to allow the Chinese perch to reproduce and grow quickly. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“I’ll do my best to ensure the survival rate of these kun fish, director Xia,”Jiang Hua nodded. I guarantee that this batch of fish will be able to be caught and sold in a year!”

“En!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”this is only the first batch of fish. I can see that many of the fish ponds here are still empty. I will quickly contact them and send more fish over!”

“Understood!” Jiang Hua said excitedly.

After knowing that these baby fishes were authentic Chinese perch, Jiang Hua felt a lot of pressure. However, he was more motivated. He was really ambitious now.

Xia ruofei stayed in the pomfrets breeding workshop for a while. Seeing that Jiang Hua had arranged everything in an orderly manner and was now busy putting in the first batch of bait, he left with a peace of mind.

Xia ruofei and Feng Rao were walking on the path to the farm. Feng Rao thought for a while and said,””Chairman, the registration and approval procedures for the pharmaceutical company have been completed. The first batch of recruitment work is also basically completed. Now, Xue Jinshan is temporarily in charge of the Research Institute. He is leading a team to tackle the relevant documents and materials for the approval of the new drug.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I know.” Boss Feng, if you have any difficulties, let me know immediately. I’ll be in charge of coordinating. ”

......

“En!” Feng Rao said,”Xue Jinshan said that after this small – scale drug test has come to an end and the results of the test have been included in the new drug approval report, he will start running the approval procedures.”

“Have they ever studied the policy?” Xia ruofei asked,”is our new drug within the scope of shortening the approval process?”

“Xue Jinshan said that, according to the regulations, our Chinese medicine can be directly applied to the State Drug Administration and also reported to the provincial Drug Administration at the same time,” said Feng Rao. However, the first review would still be carried out by the provincial Drug Administration. So, I think if you have any familiar leaders in the province, it’s best to visit them ...”

“I understand what you mean!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”CEO Feng, please remind me when Xue Jinshan and the others have the first draft of the report. I’ll go and coordinate with the provincial government!”

“Alright!” Feng Rao said happily.

She vaguely knew that Xia ruofei had a close relationship with Tian Huilan, the leader that Wu Liqian used to work for, so she tactfully reminded him.

Feng Jing knew very well that in a society like this, the same thing, even if it was completely in line with regulations and policies, could have a completely different outcome if a leader with enough authority greeted them.

After discussing the approval of the new drug, Feng Jing suddenly thought of something and quickly said,””By the way, Chairman, I have something to report to you. It’s also about the pharmaceutical company.”
