Chapter 794: Daughter-in-law’s inspection (1)

Xia ruofei was very excited when he heard the news. His first reaction was not that the heart – nourishing soup was going to be popular all over the country, but that once the heart – nourishing soup could be introduced as a guiding drug, it would be quickly used by patients in Huaxia without much promotion.

Xia ruofei did not offer the heart – nourishing soup project purely for the sake of money.

“Let’s start a round of recruitment as soon as possible!” Xia ruofei thought about it and said,”there are too few people at the pharmaceutical factory. Xue Jinshan and the others can’t stand working overtime for long periods! We’ll have to send more people to them. ”

“Alright!” Feng Jing said,”I’ll get them to bring out a candidate right away and start the recruitment as soon as possible.”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”thank you, CEO Feng.” Now that the company’s administrative team has been set up, you just have to give orders. You don’t have to do the specific things by yourself, right? You look a little Haggard! Have you been working too hard recently?”

Feng Rao blushed and said,””I’m fine. I’ve been staying up late these past two nights ...”

“It’s not good to stay up late. It’s bad for the skin. ” Xia ruofei said,”by the way, have you finished the jaded skin ointment I gave you last time? I’ll get you some more later. Women need to pay attention to their skin. ”

“Chairman, I’d like to see the mass production of jaded skin cream as soon as possible!” Feng Jing said. When the time comes, I’ll just have to pay for it myself. This is definitely a cosmetic product that will subvert the market, you really have to seize the opportunity ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but Pat his forehead with a bitter smile. The brain circuit of a strong woman was really different from his.

He wanted to express his concern for his subordinate, but Feng Jing unexpectedly changed the topic back to work.

“Alright, alright, alright. I’ll study it properly after I’m done with this.” Xia ruofei said helplessly.

“But ... Before you figure out a way to mass – produce it, it’s not a bad idea to give me a few portions of jaded skin cream!” Feng Rao chuckled.

It was indeed a woman’s nature to love beauty.

......

Xia ruofei chuckled and nodded.”No problem! It’s an employee benefit for you alone!”

“Then, thank you, Chairman!” Feng Rao smiled sweetly.”If there’s nothing else, I won’t disturb you.”

Xia ruofei nodded. Feng Jing took her laptop and left Xia ruofei’s office.

……

After Feng Rao left, Xia ruofei took out a small box of Da Hong Pao tea leaves from the medium. He used a spoon to scoop some into the teapot.

This was the Da Hong Pao that Xia Qing had made in the spirit map space, and its quality was no worse than the Da Hong Pao that li Zhifu had made himself.

After all, the tea trees grew in the spirit map space’s unique environment, and the entire production process was completed in the spirit map space. Xia Qing’s tea – making skills were also very superb.

Xia ruofei fiddled with the tea set and started to boil water.

Soon, an alluring tea fragrance filled the small office, refreshing everyone’s mind.

Xia ruofei did not know much about tea in the past, but now he was starting to like the feeling of drinking tea.

When making or tasting tea, one’s state of mind would always become very peaceful and calm.

He had been participating in lone Wolf’s operation for the past few days, especially the death of old Luo, which made him feel like he had been holding a breath in his chest. That was why Xia ruofei could be so calm and cold – blooded when facing those Wei nation agents.

He picked up the tea cup and took a small sip. The faint fragrance circulated in his mouth, and the hostility in his heart seemed to have dissipated a lot.

“Boss Xia is quite carefree!” A clear and playful voice sounded.

Xia ruofei raised his head in surprise and saw Ling Qingxue leaning against the door frame. Her sexy red lips were slightly curled up in a beautiful arc. There was a faint dimple on her cheek and there was a faint smile in her eyes.

“Qingxue! What are you doing here?” Xia ruofei was surprised and happy.

When he came back yesterday, he had already called Ling Qingxue and told her that regardless of whether she was leaving or coming back, she insisted on calling her girlfriend to report. This was a necessary quality of a good man.

Yesterday, Xia ruofei had wanted to meet Ling Qingxue in the city to relieve the pain of his lovesickness. However, Ling Qingxue said that she was busy with work today and might not have time. Xia ruofei could only dejectedly say that he would meet her in a few days.

He didn’t expect Ling Qingxue to come straight to the farm today.

Ling Qingxue glanced at Xia ruofei with a half – Smile and said,””What’s the meaning of this? It sounds like I’m not welcome here!”

Today, Ling Qingxue was wearing a pair of denim shorts, which completely revealed her long, fair, and shockingly elastic legs. She was wearing a simple white T – Shirt with a casual knot at the hem, revealing her white slender waist and mischievous little belly button, which made people’s hearts beat faster.

Xia ruofei stood up and walked over. He smiled and said,””How can I? I’m so surprised! I really didn’t expect the wife I’ve been thinking about day and night to suddenly appear in front of me ...”

Ling Qingxue chuckled and said,””What do you mean by missing her all day long! Don’t you think it’s too mushy ...”

Xia ruofei held onto Ling Qingxue’s soft hands and used his other hand to close the office door. He even locked the door from the inside, seemingly at will.

“Wife, didn’t you say you weren’t free yesterday?” Xia ruofei rolled his eyes and said,”I know. You wanted to give me a surprise!”

Xia ruofei said as he wrapped his arms around Ling Qingxue’s waist.

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but giggle as she twisted her body and said,””Don’t think too much! I’m here to make a surprise attack! Let’s see if you’ll be honest when I’m not by your side!”

“Then, is my wife satisfied with the results of the inspection?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“You did well!” Ling Qingxue said with a smile.

Xia ruofei had not seen Ling Qingxue for a long time. When he saw his pretty and lovely girlfriend, his eyes were filled with love.

Ling Qingxue felt Xia ruofei’s burning gaze and her heart started to race. When she saw the Da Hong Pao tea on the tea table, she quickly changed the topic.””This tea is so fragrant! RUO Fei, is this the Da Hong Pao that you gave my dad last time?”

Xia ruofei laughed and looked away. “It’s made from the same Tea Green, but it’s not from the same batch. How about you come and try it?”

“En!” Ling Qingxue nodded her head.

Xia ruofei walked to the coffee table and sat down. He poured away the cold tea and then pressed the button on the tea set to boil the water again.

Ling Qingxue walked to the opposite side of Xia ruofei.

Di ... With a long sound, the water in the pot was already boiling.

Xia ruofei started to brew the tea skillfully. He had only brewed the tea once, so the fragrance was still very strong. It could be said that the room was filled with the fragrance of tea.

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but take a deep breath. A look of surprise appeared on her face, and she even forgot about her own predicament.

Xia ruofei skillfully poured two cups of tea and smiled.””Qingxue, try it!”

Ling Qingxue picked up the tea cup and blew on it with her cherry – like lips. She then took a small sip.

The unique tea fragrance of Da Hong Pao instantly filled her mouth, and Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but let out a soft sigh. She praised,””This tea is so fragrant!”

Ling Qingxue had grown up in a wealthy family. Although she was not particularly fond of tea tasting, Ling Xiaotian had a special liking for it. Therefore, under the influence of her childhood, Ling Qingxue had a very good judgment of the quality of tea leaves.

“Ruofei, these tea leaves must be very expensive, right? Even Jin Junmei, which is worth more than ten thousand Yuan per Jin, is not of such high quality. ” Ling Qingxue asked.

“They’re all self – made, so there’s no pricing standard. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’m not going to sell it anyway. I’ll just keep it for myself and then give some to my elders and friends.”

After Xia ruofei finished speaking, he poured another cup for Ling Qingxue. Then, he picked up his tea cup and took a sip.

In an office filled with the fragrance of tea, drinking the best Da Hong Pao was a form of enjoyment.

After the two of them sat down and drank tea for a while, Xia ruofei stood up and took Ling Qingxue’s hand to the desk. He told her about the heart – nourishing soup project with great interest.

The heart – nourishing soup project might not be the most profitable, but it was what Xia ruofei was most concerned about. The meaning of many things was not about how much money they could make.

When one was poor, one would be good for one’s own body, and when one was good, one would help the world.

Although Xia ruofei was not considered successful or wealthy, he had the ability to do something for the people with autism.

When he first saw little Huanhuan’s appearance as if she had drifted away from the world, his heart had been greatly impacted. Now, if he could help as many autistic children walk out of his own world as possible within his ability, Xia ruofei felt that it was worth it even if he did not earn a single cent.

Ling Qingxue was naturally very supportive of Xia ruofei’s career. When she heard Xia ruofei talk about the future of the heart – nourishing soup project and its significance to the autistic community, Ling Qingxue’s eyes were a little dazed.

It had to be said that a serious man was the most attractive.

After talking about the heart – nourishing soup, the two of them started to chat about the things that had happened in the few days that Xia ruofei had been away. However, as they talked, the atmosphere became more and more charming.

The two of them stopped talking at the same time and looked into each other’s eyes. Then, Xia ruofei hugged Ling Qingxue tightly in his arms ...

After a long time, the long Symphony gradually came to an end.

Ling Qingxue glared at Xia ruofei with a red face and said,””You’re getting more and more ridiculous ...”

Xia ruofei was refreshed and chuckled.””Wife, you don’t understand this, do you? I’m usually not in the office, and the door is locked from the inside, so they must think that I’ve left. They won’t disturb us ...”

“You’re the only one with so much twisted logic!” Ling Qingxue tidied up her clothes and pinched Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei laughed and put his arm around Ling Qingxue’s shoulder. “Let’s go! Let’s go home! Today, you can have a good taste of godmother’s cooking. ”

Ling Qingxue already knew that Xia ruofei had acknowledged Hu Zi’s mother as his godmother.

“I still have things to do at the company ...” She said after a moment of hesitation.

“But there’s no need to rush it on this day!” Xia ruofei said,”we’ll eat at the farm today and rest for a while in the afternoon. Then, I’ll send you back to the city ... I have something to do in the city too.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

When Ling Qingxue heard that Xia ruofei was going to take a break for the afternoon, her pretty face could not help but heat up again. She glared at Xia ruofei coyly.

Xia ruofei grinned as he held Ling Qingxue’s hand and walked out.

Ling Qingxue had never been able to resist Xia ruofei. Since Xia ruofei wanted her to stay, she would push back the company’s matters ...
