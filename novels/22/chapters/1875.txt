Xia ruofei replied without hesitation,”don’t worry!” I promise you ...”

Wu Liqian secretly heaved a sigh of relief, but she didn’t expect Xia ruofei to continue,””I will definitely not cripple him!”

Wu Liqian didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”RUO Fei, if you continue to be like this, I won’t say anything!”

Xia ruofei chuckled,”I’m just joking with you!” Why did you take it seriously? You can rest assured! I’m a law – abiding good citizen, and I definitely won’t touch those illegal things!”

“Then you better remember what you said!” Wu Liqian said.

“Remember, remember! I will definitely remember!” Xia ruofei replied.

Wu Liqian then told Xia ruofei about how Liu haojun had been pestering her ever since he took the office. After being rejected by her many times and being blunt to him in front of the members of the committee, he had tried all means to ostracize and isolate her at work.

As Xia ruofei listened, he slowly clenched his fists and his expression turned ugly.

Fortunately, there was no one beside him at the moment. Otherwise, one would definitely feel that the temperature of the air around him seemed to have dropped by a large margin. His entire person was like a sharp sword that had been unsheathed, causing one to tremble with fear.

“This grandson is really cheap!” Xia ruofei said,”you’ve already been driven out of the capital, but you still don’t know how to behave. It seems like you’re really a pile of mud that can’t be helped! I don’t know what kind of sin elder Liu has committed, but his descendants are all so disappointing ...”

Wu Liqian didn’t know whether to laugh or cry when she heard Xia ruofei’s words. Xia ruofei’s tone was like that of an elder to Liu haojun. However, even though she felt a little awkward, she also felt particularly relieved at the same time.

Perhaps it was because she had poured out all her troubles, or perhaps it was because of Xia ruofei’s words, but Wu Liqian felt much better.

“Mr. Liu?” Wu Liqian asked curiously. Which elder Liu?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you don’t know?” He was Liu haojun’s grandfather! That’s the old general with a thunderous name!”

After that, Xia ruofei lowered his voice and reported a name.

He clearly heard Wu Liqian take a deep breath on the other end of the phone. He couldn’t help but smile and say,””Sister Qian, I thought you already knew! There’s a ‘parachuted soldier’ in the troupe, and you actually didn’t understand his family background? There’s a problem with the intelligence work!”

Wu Liqian wasn’t in the mood to joke. She said hurriedly,””Ruofei, why don’t we just forget about this? “Take a step back and get in touch with Changping normally. Even if you don’t want to invest in Changping in the end, don’t offend them too much ...”

“Why should I?” Xia ruofei sneered.

Wu Liqian said,””I only knew that Liu haojun was a cadre from the capital and that his family might have some background, but I didn’t expect him to be ... That person’s grandson. You don’t have to make such a big enemy for me ...”

Xia ruofei laughed.”Sister Qian, you’re too late. I’ve already offended the Liu family. It has nothing to do with Liu haojun, that bastard!”

“Ah?” Wu Liqian was stunned.

“I’m not lying to you!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”if you don’t believe me, you can find a chance to call aunt Tian and find out more! My relationship with the Liu family shouldn’t be a secret in the capital’s circle ...”

“It’s not that I don’t believe you, but how could you ... How could you ...”

“How can we go against the Liu family?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’m a righteous person! I just can’t stand people who rely on their family’s power to do evil things, and I want to intervene when I see injustice!”

“I can’t believe you can still laugh ...” Wu Liqian said helplessly.

In her opinion, the Liu family was definitely an unattainable Super Beast. One should know that she was only a small Deputy Director. The old man of the Liu family, who had retired from the core leadership team, was on the news every day when he was in power. In addition to him, there were also countless cadres at the level of the Liu family ministry and the Bureau. It was definitely a daunting behemoth. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Therefore, Wu Liqian’s first reaction was that she was extremely worried about Yingluo. She was worried about Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”why can’t I laugh?” Anyway, I’m not the one who’s at a disadvantage ... Besides, the Liu family is the Liu family. How can small fries like Liu haojun and Liu haofan be on the same level as the Liu family? Due to some special reasons, the Liu family would never dare to do anything to me. With just a small character like Liu haojun, without the support of his family, wouldn’t it be humiliating for him to touch me?”

Wu Liqian found it hard to believe, but she had absolute trust in Xia ruofei. After hearing what he said, Wu Liqian didn’t seem to be worried anymore. She was full of confidence in Xia ruofei.

After that, Xia ruofei comforted Wu Liqian and hung up the phone.

Xia ruofei lit a cigarette and silently smoked half of it. Then, he stubbed out the cigarette and picked up the phone on the desk. He found Lei Hu’s number and dialed it.

“Brother Xia! Do you have any orders?” Lei Hu quickly picked up the phone and asked respectfully.
