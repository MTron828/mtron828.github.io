Chapter 1645: The netherworld’s treasured land (1)

Liu haofan and Zhou Tianyu’s hearts skipped a beat when they saw the two’s serious expressions. However, they didn’t dare to disturb the two Feng Shui masters at this time. They could only be anxious and stare at the two.

Shen Zhongliang and du Qinghong held the compass and concentrated on measuring the direction. The two of them calculated repeatedly on this piece of land and finally returned to the place where they first got off the car.

The two of them looked at each other and sighed in unison.

Liu haofan was burning with anxiety and finally couldn’t help but ask,””Old Shen, how’s the situation?”

Shen Zhongliang’s expression was a little weird. He didn’t answer Liu haofan’s question directly. Instead, he looked at Zhou Tianyu and asked,””Director Zhou, when you decided to take this piece of land, did you invite anyone to take a look at the scene?”

Zhou Tianyu quickly said,”yes!” Our company has a full – time cultural environment consultant. After they came to inspect the land, they didn’t say that there was any problem with the land! He also said that the Feng Shui is very good, and it’s a place to gather wealth ...”

Shen Zhongliang smiled bitterly and shook his head,”Director Zhou, I’m afraid your company’s cultural environment consultant ... Made an error in judgment!”

“What?” Zhou Tianyu’s expression changed,”this ... How did this happen?” They’ve seen so many real estate projects in the company, but they’ve never seen such a big mistake!”

“Director Zhou, what’s the background of your cultural environment consultant?” Shen Zhongliang asked. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“There are three of them, and they are all Feng Shui masters from Hong Kong!” Zhou Tianyu said without hesitation.

Shen Zhongliang’s mouth twitched. It was not that he looked down on Hong Kong Fengshui Masters, but Hong Kong and Taiwan were more accepting of metaphysics than the mainland, and the Fengshui industry was more prosperous than the mainland.

The prosperity of the industry would naturally lead to a mixture of good and bad employees.

From Shen Zhongliang’s point of view, the three so – called cultural environment consultants hired by Zhou Tianyu’s company were probably scammers. Otherwise, it would be impossible for them to not see such an obvious problem.

In fact, Shen Zhongliang had really wronged her.

Although Tang real estate’s cultural environment consultant only had an average level of metaphysics, it was not to the extent that he could not even see such a big problem.

However, when they came to look at this piece of land, the natural array was still hidden. Unless they were extremely accomplished Fengshui Masters who had dabbled in array knowledge, they would definitely not be able to see the clues.

Even though Xia ruofei’s array skills were already very high, he had only discovered the existence of natural arrays by chance.

Now that the array had been activated, the entire atmosphere had changed. Even if the cultural and environmental consultant of the Tang real estate came over, he would also be able to see the problem.

Liu haofan, who was standing at the side, couldn’t help but ask,””Old Shen, what’s the problem with this land? Is it difficult to solve?”

Shen Zhongliang looked at du Qinghong and said,””Old du, why don’t you tell us?”

“Mr. Liu, director Zhou, the Feng Shui of this land is actually not bad!” Du Qinghong nodded and said. To be more precise, it should be because the Feng Shui is very good!”

Shen Zhongliang’s expression did not change at all after hearing du Qinghong’s words. It was obvious that even though the two of them had not talked to each other, they had reached the same conclusion. Hence, Shen Zhongliang was not surprised at all.

“Ah?” Liu haofan asked in confusion,”elder du, if that’s the case, why are there so many ghosts?”

Du Qinghong smiled bitterly and said,””Mr. Liu, I’ll put it this way! In our industry, this land is called the yin gathering place. If it’s used as a Yin residence, with a little arrangement, it can definitely achieve the effect of prosperity for children and grandchildren. It’s indeed a place to gather wealth, but if it’s used as a yang residence ...”

Du Qinghong’s words struck Liu haofan and Zhou Tianyu like lightning. They were dumbfounded.

Yin residence ...

Didn’t that mean that this piece of land was only suitable to be used as a grave? If it was used to build a house, would it still be habitable?

Even if they didn’t know Feng Shui, Liu haofan and Zhou Tianyu knew the huge difference between yin and yang residences.

After the shock, Liu haofan was furious. He stared at Zhou Tianyu and said,””Old Zhou, what is your company doing? Can’t you see such an obvious problem? What should he do now? That’s 400 million!”

Zhou Tianyu didn’t know what to do and he said,””Young master Liu, I ... I didn’t know that the cultural environment consultants in our company were so unreliable! Motherf * cker! I’ll get the company to fire them immediately when I get back! Getting such a high salary every month is not enough!”

Liu haofan said impatiently,”what’s the point of firing them now?” The key is how do we solve this problem?”

Zhou Tianyu quickly looked at Shen Zhongliang and du Qinghong and said,””Two masters, please help me solve this problem! You guys must have a way, right? As long as you can change the Feng Shui of this land, our company will definitely reward you handsomely!”

“Elder Shen, elder du, I’m counting on you!” Liu haofan said.

Shen Zhongliang smiled bitterly,”Liu, it’s not that we don’t want to help, it’s just that ... We don’t know where to start!” The Fengshui of the entire land was naturally formed. To transform the yin gathering place into a place suitable for living people was definitely not something that could be done by human hands! At least with old DU’s and my level, there’s absolutely no way!”

Du Qinghong also said,”Mr. Liu, as far as I know, no one in the Chinese Metaphysics world has been able to complete such a big project. Maybe there are some hidden masters who can do it. But our level is limited. We really don’t have any solutions!”
