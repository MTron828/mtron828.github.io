Luo Zhiyuan patted Xia ruofei’s shoulder and said with a smile,””Young man, I can see that you have a deep relationship with little Luo!”

Xia ruofei nodded silently and the two of them walked down the mountain.

Back at the entrance of the cemetery, Xia ruofei shook hands with Luo Zhiyuan and said,””Thank you so much for today, uncle Luo. I’ll have to trouble you to take care of my class monitor’s grave in the future ...”

“Don’t worry, young man!” Luo Zhiyuan smiled and said,”I’ll take good care of every comrade who is sleeping here.”

Xia ruofei nodded and saluted to Luo Zhiyuan. This was his respect for a veteran who had been holding fast.

Luo Zhiyuan was slightly stunned, but he immediately saluted back.

Under the setting sun, one of them was dressed in casual clothes, while the other was wearing an old military uniform from decades ago. However, their military salutes did not look out of place at all. Instead, they looked very solemn.

Xia ruofei and Luo Zhiyuan shook hands and then waved goodbye.

When Xia ruofei arrived at the parking lot at the entrance of the forest Park at the foot of the mountain, the taxi driver was already getting impatient. When he saw Xia ruofei, he immediately said,””Boss, if you still didn’t come, I would really think that you’ve cheated on your order ...”

Xia ruofei smiled apologetically and said,””I’m sorry, I met an old friend and took up some time. You can go back after dropping me off at a place. I’ve delayed you for so long today, so I’ll give you an extra 200 yuan for the fare. ”

When the taxi driver heard this, he immediately smiled and said,””Okay, thank you, boss!”

He even opened the car door for Xia ruofei.

After the two of them got into the car, Xia ruofei said,””Teacher, I’ll have to trouble you to send me to Yongping town’s Luoshan village, then you can return to Yuzhang.”

“Alright!” The taxi driver replied readily.

Then, the driver started to set up the navigation on his phone. He had been driving cars in the provincial capital all year round, so he was not very familiar with the roads in guhuang County.

The Luo mountain village was about 40 kilometers away from the county. When the taxi arrived at the small square at the entrance of the village, the sky was already dark.

The cement road from every village led to the village entrance. Xia ruofei didn’t know the exact location of class monitor Luo’s house, so he asked the taxi to stop at the village entrance.

Xia ruofei gave the driver 600 Yuan without hesitation and let him return to Yuzhang city on his own.

In the summer evening, many villagers were chatting under the big tree at the village entrance. When they saw a strange young man coming into the village, everyone looked over curiously.

Xia ruofei carried his bag and walked over to an old man holding a fan. He asked politely,””My Lord, may I ask how to get to Lin Yue ‘E’s house?”

As soon as Xia ruofei said this, the villagers ‘expressions became strange. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Xia ruofei explained,”I’m Squad leader Luo Zhicheng’s comrade. I’m here to visit sister – in – Law Yue ‘e.”

The old man nodded slightly and sighed,””It’s a pity for Zhicheng ...”

“Third granduncle, this hou Sheng mo is asking you for directions! Why are you saying this?” A villager beside him said.

The old man waved his fan and laughed at himself.”Old people are long – winded ... Little descendant, Zhicheng’s house is very easy to find. You can go west from this road and go to the house where the funeral is being held!”

Xia ruofei’s expression changed when he heard the words ‘funeral’.
