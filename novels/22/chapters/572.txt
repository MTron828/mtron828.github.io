“In this day and age, connections are the greatest resource!” Wang Zhihai said half – jokingly,”ruofei, don’t forget to help your brothers when you’re rich in the future!”

Xia ruofei replied seriously,”that’s for sure!” I’ve opened a company in the southeast province and hired a lot of retired comrades from our old army, but they’re all security positions. You big bosses in Jiangsu and Zhejiang don’t think they’re good enough ...”

“That’s not for sure. If there’s a day when I can’t make it, I’ll guard the door for you!” Pan Qiang said with a smile.

“Come on, you guys! Why are you pretending with your brother?” Xia ruofei laughed and scolded,”Li Jun told me everything. You guys have started companies in the counties and your businesses are all quite big. Do you think I don’t know?”

Pan Qiang and Wang Zhihai both laughed.

“Qiangzi, Zhihai, if there’s a business opportunity in the future, you’ll be the first ones I’ll look for!” Xia ruofei said seriously.

“That’s what I wanted you to say!” Pan Qiang laughed and said,”we’ll remember that. You’re not allowed to brush us off!”

“Absolutely not perfunctorily!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Then, he looked at boss Qian and said seriously,””Uncle Qian, that’s a separate matter. We still have to follow the rules in business! Then the processing fee ...”

Boss Qian interrupted Xia ruofei and said,””RUO Fei, then let’s follow the rules and settle the score with you! Now, most debt collection companies take more than 30% of the Commission, so I’ll pay you 25 million first! After deducting the 100000 Yuan processing fee for fengdou, I’ll transfer you another 24.9 million Yuan, and we’ll be even. What do you think?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile bitterly and said,””Uncle Qian, I don’t run a debt collection company ...”

“But we’re not doing technical output either!” Boss Qian immediately said.

At this moment, Qian Lijun, who was in a daze, seemed to have heard the contents of everyone’s argument. He glared at Xia ruofei with his drowsy eyes and said,””RUO Fei ... You ... You brat ... Are you ... Are you slapping my face? I ... I’m telling you! If you dare to mention ... Mention the processing fee again, don’t ... Don’t blame me for falling out with you!”

......

Seeing this, Xia ruofei knew that boss Qian would definitely not accept the money, so he smiled bitterly and said,””Alright, alright, let’s not talk about this anymore. Uncle Qian, Li Jun, I thank you! A few of my company’s employees are learning here, so please take care of them. ”

“Don’t worry!” Boss Qian said,”I will definitely arrange for the best master to teach them and strive to let them be able to operate independently within a month!”

Boss Qian was worried that he would not have a chance to repay Xia ruofei! Qin Xiaojun and the rest were studying here, so he naturally had to make proper arrangements.

Boss Qian helped Qian Lijun back to his room, while Xia ruofei and the other two went back to their respective guest rooms to rest.

After drinking two catties of white wine, Xia ruofei still felt a little drowsy despite his amazing alcohol tolerance. He had slept for the entire afternoon. After he got up, he took out a cup of spirit Heart Flower petal solution from the medium and drank it. His entire person suddenly felt a hundred times more energetic.

In contrast, the others looked a little dispirited, especially Qian Lijun. His face was a little pale, and it was obvious that he had drunk too much in the afternoon.

Xia ruofei, Pan Qiang, and Wang Zhihai laughed and teased Qian Lijun. Everyone got into the car that boss Qian had prepared and headed straight to the city center of Tong Yue.

There would be another fierce battle at night, and the scale of the battle would be even larger. Basically, all of the comrades in the same batch in Anyue city had been met.

Xia ruofei had wanted to ask Qin Xiaojun to come along, but when he considered the fact that Qin Xiaojun had joined the Army, most of his comrades had already retired. Moreover, Qin Xiaojun was not in the same Regiment as them. He reckoned that Qin Xiaojun would feel uncomfortable if he went over, so he gave up on the idea.

Boss Qian had booked a high – end restaurant in Anyue city. The average spending was at least 500 yuan. He had also put in a lot of money.

However, having gotten back more than 80 million in one go, boss Qian was in a state of excitement and did not care about the tens of thousands of Yuan for a meal.

Not long after Xia ruofei and the others arrived at the restaurant, their comrades started to enter one after another.

Since they were all in the same area, they had more or less contacted each other. However, this was the first time they had gathered together. It was all because of Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei had not seen these comrades for many years. As he had only been in the company for a few months before being selected as the lone wolf assault team, he could not even remember some of their names.

However, they still hugged each other tightly when they met, and the big room was filled with a strong sense of comradery.

There was a slight difference between a gathering of comrades and a gathering of classmates. Everyone rarely compared their current situation. Instead, they reminisced about the past. When they talked about things in the Army, their voices were a lot louder. Bottles of wine were consumed at a very fast speed.

As the organizer, Qian Lijun had also learned his lesson. He did not drink to his death and kept a small amount.

After everyone had their fill, Qian Lijun organized a group to go to a nearby KTV and asked for a large private room to sing.

Without a doubt, military songs were the most popular.

The room was filled with impassioned and majestic tunes,”the day I leave the Army,””veteran, you have to leave,””when your hair brushed over my steel gun ...”

Although some people’s singing sounded like ghosts wailing and wolves howling, everyone was singing very happily. Some people began to cry as they sang.

At midnight, everyone sang a song called “soldiers of the iron hard disk.”

Qian Lijun busied himself again. His comrades who lived in Anyue city took a taxi back, while Qian Lijun found a four – Star hotel for his comrades who lived in the county and arranged for them to rest.

Xia ruofei and Qian Lijun did not go back. They checked into a hotel room and slept.

The next day, Qian Lijun gathered his comrades again and went to Yandang mountain to play for a day. In the end, they returned home after having a great time.

Xia ruofei stayed at Qian Lijun’s house for another night and was ready to drive back the next morning.

He called Qin Xiaojun and the others over and instructed them to study the techniques diligently. Then, he spoke a few words to boss Qian and Qian Lijun before he got on the car and bade farewell to everyone. He then left the iron – Skin Dendrobium base.

……

Just as Xia ruofei was driving south towards the southeast province, in the Four Seasons Hotel in Anyue city, Wang Jinsheng had already spent three days feeling uneasy.

He didn’t dare to go anywhere and just tossed and turned in the hotel all day. In three days, he had lost a lot of weight and looked very Haggard with his unshaven beard.

After waiting for three days, Wang Jinsheng finally couldn’t sit still anymore. He braced himself and went out to take a taxi, and then came to the Qian family’s iron – Skin Dendrobium base.

Boss Qian was still drinking tea in the living room and admiring the red Arowana. He had been in a good mood these days.

Wang Jinsheng stood at the door for a while, but boss Qian did not look over. He could only call out embarrassedly,”Old Qian ...”

Boss Qian then turned around. When he saw that it was Wang Jinsheng, he could not help but frown and asked,”Why are you here again? I don’t welcome you here!”

“Old Qian, I ... I don’t want to bother you anymore ... But ... You didn’t reply to me last time ... I didn’t dare to leave ... I’ve been waiting in the hotel ...” Wang Jinsheng quickly said.

Boss Qian then remembered that Wang Jinsheng seemed to have said that he would find a hotel in ou Yue and wait for him to reply to “Mr. Xia.”

When Wang Jinsheng saw boss Qian’s expression, he knew that he had forgotten about it.

Wang Jinsheng could not help but complain in his heart, but he did not dare to show it on his face. He could only smile and say,”Old Qian, can you ... Can you contact Mr. Xia? I ...”

Boss Qian said impatiently,”Alright, alright, I got it. You can go back first!” I’ll give him a call later. ”

Wang Jinsheng felt as if he had been granted Amnesty and quickly said,”Thank you, thank you ... Old Qian, I’ll be waiting for your call at the hotel ... My phone number is still the same!”

Boss Qian waved his hand coldly and did not even bother to talk to Wang Jinsheng. He directly turned his gaze to his beloved Red Arowana.

Wang Jinsheng was also tactful and did not disturb boss Qian anymore. He left with his tail between his legs.

Boss Qian would not bother Xia ruofei while she was driving for Wang Jinsheng’s sake. He did not care about Wang Jinsheng’s long wait!

Boss Qian waited until evening. He estimated that no matter how slow Xia ruofei drove, he should have returned to San Shan by now. He then picked up his phone and called him.
