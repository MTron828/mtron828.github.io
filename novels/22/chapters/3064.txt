3065  Retrieving the treasure in the stone room (2)

  Xia ruofei gritted his teeth and exerted all his strength to push down. The invisible force of space gathered from all directions and pressed down on the back of Xia ruofei's hand.

  The light screen trembled slightly.

  Xia ruofei knew that the battle was about to come to an end.

  Based on his past experience, Xia ruofei could tell that the ball of light was on the verge of collapse.

  It all depended on whether he could hold on.

  Xia ruofei gritted his teeth. The bones in his hands seemed to have reached their limit under the pressure from both the inside and outside. He felt as if they were going to crack.

  This level of pain was nothing to Xia ruofei.

  However, the pressure he exerted on the ball of light had basically reached its limit. Now was the final tug - of - War.

  The deformed ball of light kept trembling.

  The expression on Xia ruofei's face turned ferocious. He gritted his teeth so hard that the muscles on his face seemed to be trembling. His hands, which were in direct contact with the ball of light, were also trembling.

  Xia ruofei had already made a rough judgment that Daoist master mountain river was the one who wanted to inherit the painting. He had to be at least in the intermediate stage of the Aurous core stage to open the light ball.

  If Xia ruofei was in the intermediate stage of the Golden core realm, he would be able to defeat the ball of light. Although it would not be easy, he would still be the winner.

  Even though Xia ruofei had already come to this conclusion, he did not want to give up so easily.

  They had already reached the final stage, so why should they give up? Why couldn't an early - Stage golden core cultivator open the ball of light?

  Xia ruofei refused to believe it.

  His entire body was trembling, and so was the ball of light. Both sides were on the verge of collapse.

  Xia ruofei's eyes revealed a trace of madness. He mobilized the remaining Yuan Qi in his dantian and shouted,""You F * cking break it open for me!"

  Yuan Qi crazily flowed through his meridians and into his hands. At the same time, the invisible spatial force had been increased to its maximum.

  Xia ruofei's palm made a slight cracking sound. The bones in his palm had cracked.

  However, Xia ruofei did not care at all. With a crazed expression, he pressed down on her.

  Finally, the ball of light could no longer bear the burden. It emitted a soft "Chi" sound and directly dissipated.

  The pressure on his hand disappeared instantly, but Xia ruofei was still using all his strength to press down. It was as if he had stepped on air when he was going down the stairs. He staggered and fell forward.

  His reaction speed was still very fast, and his hands immediately supported himself on the stone platform.

  However, Xia ruofei immediately sucked in a breath of cold air. It was so painful that beads of sweat appeared on his forehead. He noticed that the bones in his palms were already cracked. The excruciating pain caused him to cry out in pain even though he had undergone special anti - interrogation training in the Army. Then, Xia ruofei laughed madly.

  His entire body felt weak as he leaned against the stone platform and sat on the ground. He shook his hand and laughed loudly.

  Who said that an early jiedan stage cultivator couldn't do it? Didn't this work? Xia ruofei's heart was filled with the joy of success after overcoming many difficulties.

  After a while, Xia ruofei directly grabbed the box containing the petals of the spirit Heart Flower from the Archean realm. He took out a petal from the box, put his hands together, and pressed the petal in his palms.

  The moment the petals of the spirit Heart Flower touched the skin of his palms, they melted almost instantly and were all absorbed by Xia ruofei's palms.

  The petals of the spirit Heart Flower could be said to have an immediate effect on this kind of   Standing in front of the stone platform, Xia ruofei adjusted his breathing and suppressed his excitement.
