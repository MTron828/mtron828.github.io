“President Zheng, Mr. Xia just came to the clubhouse.” The lobby manager said respectfully. “Brother Xia is here? Why didn’t he give me a call in advance?” President Zheng was a little surprised and immediately said,”little Meng, you must take good care of brother Xia ... Hmm, the noble Hall is empty tonight, right?” I’ll arrange it for brother Xia ...” “President Zheng, Mr. Xia came with some friends. He doesn’t want me to disturb him.” The lobby manager reported. “I see ...” President Zheng pondered for a moment and said,”then find out which private room they are in and give them a bottle of good wine in the name of the club. I’ll go back now!” We’ll talk about it when I’m back!” “Alright, President Zheng!” The lobby manager replied respectfully. After the phone call, she immediately paid more attention to Xia ruofei. She knew that President Zheng was playing cards at a friend’s house tonight. She didn’t expect that once he heard that Xia ruofei was coming, he would immediately put down his game and rush back. How much did he value Xia ruofei? She immediately beckoned for a service staff and asked her to find out which private room Xia ruofei and the others were in while she personally went to the warehouse to pick the wine. Xia ruofei and the rest soon arrived at the plum blossom Hall. The plum blossom Hall was not big. After Xia ruofei and a dozen people went in, it seemed a little crowded. It was obvious that Liu Hang’s reputation was limited. However, any private room or private room in the West River Moon Club was quite exquisite. Such a medium – sized private room, whether it was the luxuriousness of the facilities, the professional sound system, or even every detail, was naturally more than a little better than the average nightclub or KTV. “Come on! Everyone, feel free to sit!” Liu Hang greeted everyone with a smug expression. Then, he asked the waiter to order some drinks, fruit platters, snacks, and so on. In fact, if the club’s VIP members came to spend money, they didn’t need to order themselves. The club would naturally arrange everything. “Make yourself at home. Those who want to sing, sing. Those who want to play cards, play. The club even has a special sauna room and gym that are all free to use. Whoever is interested, you can go there directly!” Liu Hang said as if he was the host. Apart from Yuan Lili who lived abroad, the rest of the students who came to the party were basically working in Sanshan. It was their first time at a top club like Xi jiangyue, so they were naturally a little reserved. Therefore, none of them used the other free facilities of the club. Instead, they sat together. Some of them started singing, while others gathered to play cards. Some of them even played dice, just like in the ordinary KTV rooms. At this time, the door of the private room was knocked open, and a beautiful and tall waitress came in with a bottle of red wine in both hands. She bowed slightly and said,””Dear guests, this is a gift from the club. It’s a 1985 berthus red wine.” “A gift? ” 85 Petrus?” After all, Yuan Lili lived abroad. Hearing that, she immediately said in surprise,”a bottle is at least 1500 dollars!” “No way! What kind of wine was this that was so expensive! Li Li, are you sure you’re not mistaken?” ” 1500 Yuan for a bottle of wine? US dollars?” “Oh my God, this wine is worth one square meter of a house in the center of Sanshan city!” The waiter did not look down on Xia ruofei and his classmates because they looked like they had not seen the world. He smiled and said,”This is indeed a 1985 berthus. It was directly imported by our club from its original place, Bordeaux.” In fact, everyone was just shocked by the price Yuan Lili had mentioned. They didn’t really doubt the authenticity of the red wine. Liu Hang was a little confused at first, but he quickly reacted and said with a smile,””Hahaha! It must be because of young master Li, he was a Silver member of the club! He booked the private room himself, so it’s normal for them to give him a bottle of red wine!” His face was glowing. This time, he had shown his face and made a fortune! When he spoke of young master Li, he felt a sense of honor. Liu Hang said in his heart,”young master Li is so kind. I have to thank him when I get back. Hmm ... What should I give him?” If it was too cheap, it wouldn’t be worth it ... As Xia ruofei had hinted when he entered the room, the lobby manager did not give any special instructions to the waiter. Hence, she did not know what was going on. She brought the red wine to Liu Hang and asked him to check the label. Liu Hang waved his hand.”There’s no need to look. You can’t possibly fool young master Li’s guests with fake wine, right?” The waitress didn’t know who “young master Li” was, but her professionalism made her smile. After getting Liu Hang’s consent, she opened the wine with a wine opener, poured a little into the wine glass, and asked Liu Hang to try it. This time, Liu Hang didn’t refuse Yingying’s attention – he loved doing this. He pretended to take the wine glass, but he finished it in one gulp. Then he closed his eyes and said after a while,””Good wine!” Liu Hang had been brewing his emotions for a long time, but he did not say anything “solid”. Moreover, his “one gulp” posture was quite like the state of a drinking contest in a food stall. The waiter almost could not help but laugh. Liu Hang was not aware of it. He shouted,”hurry up and pour some for each of them. Everyone, try this 1500 – dollar red wine!” “Yes, sir ...” The waiter said respectfully. After everyone’s wine was poured, Liu Hang said,””Come, come, come. Let’s have a taste. It’s not easy to get such good red wine!” He was speaking from the bottom of his heart. As a Section Chief in the unit, he had to entertain a lot of people, but he had never tasted red wine that was worth tens of thousands of Yuan. “Let me tell you, young master Li is the only one who has a lot of influence. For ordinary people, they might not even sell this rare red wine even if they pay for it, let alone give it to them!” Liu Hang continued to brag about the “young master Li” who made him proud. At this moment, he seemed to have transformed into the young master Li who had a huge reputation. He had the pride of pointing out the country in front of his junior high school classmates and felt that he had completely surpassed Xia ruofei. He did not know that Xia ruofei was looking at him as if he was a clown. However, these students naturally had to say some words of flattery, which made Liu Hang’s face even more radiant. He felt that he had finally gotten back at them, and his heart was extremely happy. After everyone had played for a while, the door of the private room was pushed open again. Before the person arrived, a forthright voice was heard,””Hahaha! Brother Xia, why didn’t you give me a call before you came to my club? Don’t be so polite ...” Xia ruofei could not help but smile bitterly. Sure enough, the next moment, Xia ruofei saw the chubby President Zheng appear at the door with a smile on his face. Beside him was the charming young woman, the lobby manager ...
