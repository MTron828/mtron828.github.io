Chapter 189: Ten million jadeite (1)

The next morning, Xia ruofei received a call from someone who claimed to be the manager of Hengfeng jewelry’s Southeast Branch. The female manager, surnamed Feng, was very polite on the phone. She said that she had already prepared the Jade according to the instructions of President Ma of the head office. Xia ruofei immediately decided to trade the Jade. He followed the address provided by manager Feng and drove to an office building at Huayun road CBD in San Shan city. After Xia ruofei parked the car, he saw a beautiful young lady in a black business suit waiting in the lobby of the office building. “Hello, Mr. Xia, I’m Feng Yun!” The young woman greeted Xia ruofei with great enthusiasm. “Hello, manager Feng!” Xia ruofei smiled warmly and shook Feng Yun’s hand. He then asked curiously,”manager Feng, have we met before?” “No, but Boss Ma was afraid that we would neglect you, so he sent me a photo of you,” Feng Yun replied with a smile. Xia ruofei was suddenly enlightened. He couldn’t help but exclaim at how Ma Zhiming handled things flawlessly. From such a small detail, he could see that Ma Zhiming valued him very much. After the two of them exchanged pleasantries, Feng Yun led Xia ruofei to the elevator and to the floor where their company was located. The office building was the headquarters of Hengfeng jewelry’s Southeast Branch. They had counters and stores in all major shopping malls in the province. When she entered the company, the employees greeted Feng Yun respectfully from time to time. Everyone also looked at Xia ruofei curiously. Feng Yun led Xia ruofei to her office. “Mr. Xia, please sit!” Feng Yun said,”what would you like to drink? I only have green tea and coffee here. ” “Manager Feng, I’m not thirsty. You don’t have to work. Let’s just look at the Jade directly!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “Alright, please wait a moment.” Feng Yun said. She pushed open the door to the Office suite and walked in. Soon, she came out with a large metal box. The metal box looked very sturdy, and it was also designed with wheels and rods, just that it was much larger than the average pulling – Rod box. Feng Yun unlocked the box, opened the lid, and said,”Mr. Xia, all the Jade materials are here. Please check them.” “Alright, thank you for your trouble.” Xia ruofei stood up and walked over. The box was filled with jades of all sizes. The Jades were giving off a green glow, and it felt like their faces were glowing green. With so many precious jades placed together, it was still very visually impactful. Even Feng Yun, who dealt with jewelry and Jade every day, couldn’t help but feel a little lost. Feng Yun stood aside respectfully. Xia ruofei reached out and picked up a piece of Jade. As soon as his hand touched the Jade, he could clearly feel a slight tremble in his palm. It was the reaction of the spirit map scroll after it sensed the Jade. Hence, when Xia ruofei was identifying Jade, he could do it with 100% accuracy. Of course, if the quality of the Jade was too low to cause the spirit map to shake, even Xia ruofei would not be able to tell if it was real or not. Xia ruofei looked through the Jade pieces one by one, but he only touched them briefly. He would put them down after a few glances and pick up another piece, so he was actually quite fast. Very quickly, Xia ruofei had ‘checked’ all the Jade. After buying Jade so many times, he was very familiar with the price of Jade. After looking at it, Xia ruofei had a rough estimate in his heart. 10 million Chinese dollars. These jades were definitely more than that. Xia ruofei nodded and closed the box again.”There’s no problem with the Jade. Manager Feng, please give me your account number!” “Our company’s bank account is at the southeast province branch of Industrial and Commercial Bank, Sanshan city sub – Branch, Huayun Road branch. The account number is 6222 ...” Xia ruofei quickly jotted down the account information that Feng Yun had given him. Then, he raised his head and said,””Manager Feng, transfers of more than five million can only be done at the counter, so you’ll have to wait for me for a while. I’ll go to the bank to transfer the money now.” Feng Yun quickly said,”Mr. Xia, Boss Ma has told me that you can take the Imperial Jade first. The transfer is not urgent. You can do it when you have time.” Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, then he smiled and said,””That’s fine. Then leave me the mailing address here. I’ll send you the receipt after the transfer. Your finance department also needs to make a deposit!” Feng Yun quickly took out a business card and handed it to Xia ruofei with both hands.””Mr. Xia, my contact number and address are here.” “Alright,” he said. Xia ruofei took the name card and said,”I’ll take that thing with me. Please thank Mr. MA for me!” “Definitely, definitely!” Feng Yun said,”by the way, Mr. Xia, do you need me to arrange for a few people to escort you back?” The metal box contained Jade that was worth tens of millions. If she were robbed on the way, it would be a big deal. When the head office’s leaders were angry, she, as a small branch Manager, would probably have to pack up and leave immediately. Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Thank you for your kindness, manager Feng, but there’s no need. I can do it alone!” “This ... Alright!” Feng Yun personally sent Xia ruofei out of the company all the way to the elevator. She only returned after the elevator door closed. Xia ruofei, on the other hand, dragged the metal box to the underground parking lot on the basement first floor and found his Knight XV. After putting the box in the back seat, he drove to a blind spot in the underground parking lot and opened the box. After summoning the scroll, Xia ruofei took the Jade from the box and let the scroll absorb it. The speed at which the painting absorbed the Jade was very fast. In a short while, a box full of Jade worth ten million Yuan was completely absorbed. Xia ruofei did not check on the condition of the painting. He kept it in his palm and returned to the driver’s seat. He drove away from the office building. Although Ma Zhiming had absolute trust in Him, and Feng Yun had also said that he could transfer the money to her when he was free, Xia ruofei did not want to delay. The money would have to be paid sooner or later. Anyway, he had nothing to do at the moment that required a large sum of money, so it was naturally better to pay the money as soon as possible. Hence, Xia ruofei found an ICBC branch on the way and transferred 10 million HxB into the public account of Hengfeng jewelry’s Southeast Branch. Then, Xia ruofei realized that there was a post office not far from the bank. Hence, he decided to mail the documents as well. After leaving the post office, Xia ruofei drove back to the farm eagerly. He couldn’t wait to see what changes would happen to the spirit painting scroll after absorbing the Jade worth ten million Yuan and whether it could evolve completely again ...Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com
