Chapter 518: Make things big (1)

When the old couple saw the tall and strong white customs officer suddenly raise his voice, they could not help but panic.

In fact, their English was not good enough for normal communication. They had only learned a few simple words in China. They could handle simple customs inspections, but if there were some special situations, they would not know how to deal with them.

The old man was a little flustered, and he used broken English to express that he needed translation service.

“We can’t provide a Chinese translation!” The fat pig said arrogantly.

The old couple didn’t even know what was going on. They panicked and tried to communicate further with limited English words and hand gestures.

The fat pig impatiently took out a piece of paper and then said loudly,””Fine! Fine! Do you understand?”

The old man understood the word, and he saw the fat customs officer pointing at one of the lines on the page.”200AUD。

He was fined 200 Australian dollars!

The old man was dumbfounded. That was more than a thousand Chinese dollars!

Why was he fined so much money for no reason?

The couple had come to Australia to visit their daughter who had just given birth and to help take care of their grandson. In fact, they were just ordinary retired teachers in China, and their pension was only about 3000 Yuan a month. This fine was equivalent to one – third of their monthly pension.

“Why? Why should I be fined?” The old man asked angrily. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“You’ve violated the entry regulations! Pay the fine now, or I’ll detain you!” Fat pig said arrogantly.

The two old men couldn’t understand the rapid – Fire English at all, and they looked very helpless.

At this time, a Chinese girl who was behind the two old men walked up and said to the fat pig in English,””May I ask what happened? I can provide translation services for them!”

The fat pig glanced at the Chinese girl and said,””So troublesome! Tell them that they will be fined 200 Australian dollars for underreporting!”

“What did they hide?”

“These two pieces of cake!” Fat pig pointed to two very small pieces of cake and said,”they filled in NO on the food – related entry card, but they brought food into the country, which is a serious violation of the rules!”

The Chinese girl’s face changed slightly, and she quickly turned around and repeated the customs officer’s words to the old couple in Chinese.

“We didn’t bring this cake from China!” The old man quickly said. We’re transferring in Melbourne and it’s a meal provided by their domestic flight. We couldn’t finish it and thought it would be a waste to throw it away, so we put it in a lunch box. This is the food for their domestic flight!”

In order to save money, the two old men did not choose a direct flight to Sydney. Instead, they chose a relatively cheap transfer route. After flying from China to Melbourne, they changed to a domestic flight in Australia. The two pieces of cake were provided on the flight from Melbourne to Sydney, so they should be food from Australia.

However, they did not enter the country in Melbourne so when they arrived in Sydney, they were caught by the nitpicking fat pig and demanded a high fine.

A fine of 200 Australian dollars was definitely a heavy punishment.

Even if the two elders ‘behavior was against the rules, in the case of a first – time offense, especially for foreigners who did not understand the relevant policies, they would usually be given a verbal warning instead of a fine.

Furthermore, there was still a dispute whether the cake they brought was against the rules.

This fat pig’s brutal treatment was obviously filled with discrimination.

The Chinese girl immediately conveyed the information provided by the old man to the fat pig in English.

The fat pig had an arrogant look on his face as he shook his head and said,””No, I must be fined!”

“Then we don’t want these two pieces of cake, okay?” the old man came over and said.

After the Chinese lady translated, the fat pig still only had one word: “NO!”

The old man was a little angry. He raised his voice and said,””Then we can finish this cake, right?”

After fat pig heard the Chinese girl’s translation, he sneered and said,””No! It was already too late. If I hadn’t found out, these two pieces of cake would have been brought into your country illegally! Your violation has already happened and you must pay the fine!”

The Chinese lady had a trace of sympathy and translated the fat pig’s words to the old man. Then she whispered,””Sir, you can only admit that you’re unlucky in this situation ... If you don’t pay the fine, it may lead to an even more serious punishment ...”

“Why?!” The old man shouted angrily. This was discrimination! The Americans just brought a lot of luggage, and he just asked a few questions and let them go. When it comes to the Chinese, they deliberately pick on the bones ...”

The Chinese girl felt the same and said,””Isn’t that so? I’ve been studying here for several years, and I’ve been on edge every time I go through customs ...”

At this time, the fat white man looked at the Chinese girl and the old couple in disdain and mumbled,””You want to get away with it? Don’t even think about it! You Chinese are all liars! The products they produced were all fake and inferior trash! Your athletes all take stimulants to win gold medals ...”
