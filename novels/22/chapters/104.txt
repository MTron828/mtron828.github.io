Chapter 105: Chapter 103 – endless life

Xia ruofei felt as if ten million alpacas had just run over him. What the hell was this? Initially, Guan Ping had thought that Xia ruofei had received such preferential treatment at a subsidiary branch of the Ling Ji restaurant because his relationship with Ling Qingxue had been confirmed, and that he had already become the future son – in – Law of Ling Xiaotian. Seeing Xia ruofei’s speechless expression, Guan Ping chuckled and said in a low voice,””Alright, alright! Don’t pretend to be innocent ... I’m still a loyal friend, haven’t I been keeping your secret?” “Protect your sister! “I really didn’t ...” Xia ruofei said as if he had said it. He smiled bitterly and helplessly.”Forget it, forget it. You can think however you want ...” Xia ruofei did not even have the strength to explain. If Guanping misunderstood, he could only let him be. When everyone was almost done eating, Yuan Lili quietly got up and went out. After a short while, she returned to the private room with a bitter smile and said,””Ruofei, you’re too polite ...” “What’s wrong?”Xia ruofei asked, confused. “I just went to settle the bill, but they said you’ve already paid.” Yuan Lili reproached,”I’m treating my classmates to a meal before my engagement. How can I let you pay for it? How much did this meal cost? I’ll transfer it to you later. ” “I didn’t ...” Xia ruofei smiled helplessly. He thought for a moment and understood the reason. He said,”I understand ... Yuan Lili, don’t worry about this. I have a good relationship with the owner of this restaurant. I guess he told me to give you a free meal.” “How can we do that? I’ll just give you the money!” Yuan Lili said. “The problem is that I didn’t spend any money ...” Xia ruofei shrugged helplessly.”I’ll just pretend that you’re paying for this meal. It doesn’t matter who’s paying! What’s important is that we can get together, right?” Yuan Lili wanted to insist on her opinion, but her classmates also tried to persuade her. Some people said that Xia ruofei had stolen the limelight from Yuan Lili, but most of them were just joking. At this time, Liu Hang said,”Yuan Lili, Xia ruofei is right. It’s most important to have fun together. Besides, a meal doesn’t cost much. You don’t have to be so formal.” “This meal isn’t cheap ...” Yuan Lili said with a bitter smile.”Let’s not talk about those high – end seafood. Although I haven’t been back in the country for long, I know how popular Taoyuan vegetables are in Sanshan city. One dish costs at least a few hundred Yuan ... Not to mention that so many dishes were served today. Even if other people have money, they can’t get to eat it!” “Yuan Lili, don’t argue with us. At most, when your fiancé returns to China, he can treat us to a meal.” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “Yes, yes, yes ...” Liu Hang said,”let’s take it as Xia ruofei treating us today!” How about this, since Yuan Lili has returned to China and we can get together as classmates, I’ll arrange the next program!” “Supervisor Liu, there’s still another program coming up?” pang Hao asked with a smile. “Of course, the nightlife has just begun!” Liu Hang said,”I’ll take everyone to a good place later. Ordinary people can’t even enter the gate!” “Oh, really? Then we’ll have to take a good look!” Guan Ping also said jokingly,”class monitor, there’s no problem with the box this time, right?” Previously, Liu Hang had been acting weird towards Xia ruofei. As Xia ruofei’s Good Brothers, Guan Ping and pang Hao could not stand it. Now that Liu Hang, who had been sulking the entire night, was acting arrogantly again, Guan Ping could not help but want to give him a blow. “What do you know? They’re on a membership system!” Liu Hang said disdainfully,”members will have a private room at any time!” Then, Liu Hang turned to Yuan Lili and said,”Yuan Lili, Xia ruofei was the host for the meal just now. Now, I’ll be the host to celebrate with you. You’re not going to reject me, are you?” “Of course we have to give our class monitor face,” Yuan Lili said with a smile.”We don’t have to spend any money anyway. Don’t you agree?” The students laughed and agreed with Yuan Lili, while Xia ruofei could only smile bitterly in his heart. The atmosphere of the class reunion had changed a long time ago, but it would not be good to leave halfway, so he could only go with them. He could imagine that Liu Hang must be trying to show off and beat him, but he felt that such a comparison was too childish. Everyone had eaten and drunk their fill, so Liu Hang took everyone to the next scene. So, the group left Hongtian restaurant. Liu Hang found a few substitute drivers and drove them straight to the city center. Xia ruofei sat in the passenger’s seat and felt that the road was familiar. When they arrived at the parking lot, Liu Hang led a group of students to the scenic Area of San Fang Qi Street. Xia ruofei could not help but have a strange look on his face. Sure enough, after a while, Liu Hang led everyone to the entrance of the West River Moon Club. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but rub his forehead. What was going on today? why was it not Ling Ji restaurant but Xijiang Moon Club? Can’t we just have a gathering with our classmates in a low – Key manner? Liu Hang directly went up to the Man in Black at the door and said,””Young master Li used his membership card to help me book a private room in the plum blossom Hall. He had already informed your manager ...” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but shake his head. Liu Hang didn’t even have Xi jiangyue’s membership card. He even asked someone to reserve a private room to show off. He really didn’t know how strong this guy’s vanity was ... Xia ruofei reached into his pocket and squeezed The Platinum Card. After some thought, he put it back. The Man in Black had a cold expression on his face. After confirming with the people inside through the walkie – talkie, he nodded and let them in. Liu Hang led Yuan Lili and the others into the courtyard of the club. Immediately, a tall waiter in a cheongsam came forward and led them to the private room. Liu Hang introduced proudly,”this Xijiang Moon Club is not a place that just anyone can enter!” Even I don’t have a membership card here, but I have a good friend who is a Silver member here. Today, I asked him to book a private room for me, so that everyone can see the life of the upper class!” The students were dazzled by the splendid decorations in the club. Liu Hang continued to boast,””I often come here to eat with young master Li! Almost every time he came, he would meet celebrities ... He heard that Heavenly King Liu would invite his friends to San Shan for his concert! If you’re lucky, you might even meet your idol!” Liu Hang’s vanity was greatly satisfied when he saw his classmates ‘envious looks. He looked at Xia ruofei as if he was showing off his strength, but Xia ruofei still looked indifferent. This lowered his sense of achievement by a lot. Soon, they arrived at the lobby of the club. Xia ruofei immediately saw the charming and graceful lobby manager. Coincidentally, the lobby manager also looked over. When she saw Xia ruofei, she was stunned for a moment before her eyes widened. However, before she could speak, Xia ruofei shook his head discreetly and gave her a look. The lobby manager immediately understood and smiled at Xia ruofei. He did not go forward to disturb him. However, when Xia ruofei and the rest followed the female receptionist through the lobby and walked to the plum blossom Hall, the lobby manager immediately walked to the side and gave President Zheng a call ...FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m
