3147 Everything is in place (2)

“I agree!” Chen Xuan said.

After the two of them had finished their discussion, Xia ruofei turned around and said,””Sect leader mu, Valley master Liu, brother Chen and I are going to the National Library to look up some relevant information. You can stay here and rest for a while! If you have any needs, just ask Wu Qiang in the backyard, he will satisfy you!”

“Okay, then I’ll have to trouble little brother Xia and nephew Chen!” Mu Sheng said with a smile.

“It’s not hard, but it’s more interesting to learn some new knowledge!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Then, Xia ruofei turned to Ling Qingxue and Song Wei and said,””Qingxue, Weiwei, you two come with me! Didn’t Wei Wei also need to check the thesis information? There’s no delay!”

Naturally, Xia ruofei was still considering safety. He always wanted to bring his two close female friends with him. After all, Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha were both intermediate stage golden core cultivators. If they had any ill intentions, the consequences would be very serious.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue nodded with a smile.

The four of them went straight to the backyard. Xia ruofei first called Wu Qiang over and gave him some instructions. He told him not to disturb the guests in the middle courtyard. If the guests had any needs, he must do his best to satisfy them.

Wu Qiang naturally nodded in agreement. When he saw that Xia ruofei was about to leave, he quickly said,”Boss, I’ll drive you there ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”you can stay at home.” I can drive by myself ...”

“Yes!” Wu Qiang nodded and said.

Xia ruofei and the rest got into the Elfa van. Xia ruofei drove the car himself while Chen Xuan gentlemanly gave the two most comfortable seats in the middle to the two ladies. He then sat in the front passenger seat.

After leaving the courtyard house, Xia ruofei drove the Toyota Elfa to the National Library. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

When they arrived at the library, the four of them first applied for a library card each, and then began to look up information.

After searching on the computer, Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan each took a large stack of books and sat down in the reading area. They started to read.

Meanwhile, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue each found a few books that they were interested in and sat down on either side of Xia ruofei.

Looking at Xia ruofei, who was surrounded by women, Chen Xuan could not help but feel envious.

However, it was only a momentary envy. Chen Xuan was so engrossed in cultivation that he had no intention of finding a Dao partner for the time being.

Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan were searching for relevant information on the computer while Mu Sheng, Liu Mansha, and the others were drinking tea and chatting. After all, other than Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan, the others knew nothing about the relevant knowledge and could not help much.

At this moment, Xia ruofei’s phone rang. He took it out and looked at the display. It was Zhao Yongjun. He stood up and said,””Brother Chen, you go ahead. I’m going to take a call.”

Chen Xuan nodded his head with a smile.”Alright!”

Xia ruofei picked up the phone and walked out of the room. At the same time, he answered the call.”Big brother Zhao!”

Zhao Yongjun laughed heartily and said,”ruofei, are you done with your work?” You shouldn’t have come to the capital without us first!”

Zhao Yongjun knew that Xia ruofei had arrived in the capital city yesterday because Wu Qiang had asked him to borrow a car. However, he heard that Xia ruofei was busy, so he didn’t disturb him. It was only when Xia ruofei returned to the club with the car that Zhao Yongjun called.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”I’ve come to the capital at the last minute. I do have some things to do. Brother Zhao, you won’t blame me for my lack of manners, will you?”

“Strange! Of course I’m to blame!” Zhao Yongjun laughed and said,”you’ll have to drink at least three glasses as punishment! Otherwise, it’ll be hard to calm my anger!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”no problem!” Not to mention three cups, even if it’s thirty cups, three hundred cups, as long as big brother Zhao says the word, this little brother will drink it without hesitation!”

“Straightforward!” Zhao Yongjun said,”by the way, ruofei, I heard from the club’s driver that you’ve brought a lot of friends to Beijing this time? I’ll make some arrangements! As a good host, we’ll do it in our own club, how about it?”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”brother Zhao, there’s really no need for that!” These friends of mine are all intellectuals who study cultural relics. They have no interest in social activities at all. Well ... They just came back from the Forbidden City, and now they’re all going back to their rooms to study the materials, so you don’t have to work! When I’m almost done here, I’ll go and have a drink with my brothers!”

Two of the cars heading to the Forbidden City were from the club. Zhao Yongjun naturally knew where they were going, so he didn’t doubt Xia ruofei’s excuse at all. He smiled and said,””Alright then! Since he’s your friend, I’ll respect your opinion! However, if you need any help in the capital, don’t hide it! Just say it! Your big brother Zhao still has some face in forty – nine city! Ordinary things can’t stump me!”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat. He smiled and said,””Brother Zhao, now that you mention it, I do remember something that I might need your help with. I just don’t know if it’ll be too troublesome!”

“You bastard! Why are you being so polite with me? Are we still brothers?” Zhao Yongjun pretended to be angry,”hurry up and tell me! Don’t talk nonsense!”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”do you know anyone from the major universities in Beijing?” It’s best if you have a leadership position. ”

Zhao Yongjun was slightly stunned, then smiled.””Why are you suddenly asking about this? Don’t tell me you want to further your studies in University? With your net worth, you don’t need to further your studies! Or ... Do you want to pick up female students? I’m telling you, you can’t let sister – in – Law down!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”what does this have to do with me?” I would like to consult some experts and professors in the University. It would be best if they could give us some special lessons. ”

Zhao Yongjun laughed,”you really want to change your profession and become a scholar?.”

“Big brother Zhao, just tell me if you can or not!” Xia ruofei said.

“No problem!” Zhao Yongjun replied readily. How could a man say no? Go ahead! What kind of expert was he looking for? I’ll think of a way for you!”

“It’s mainly related to computers, such as databases, modeling, and supercomputers ...”Xia ruofei said.

“Wait a minute!” Zhao Yongjun said,”I’ll take notes! I know all the words you’ve said, but I don’t even know what they are when put together!”

“Okay, okay, okay, I’ll speak slowly!” Xia ruofei smiled.

“Yes, yes!” Zhao Yongjun said,”alright, you can speak now.”

“Experts in computer software. It’s best if they have more research in the fields of databases, modeling, and supercomputers.” Xia ruofei said slowly.

“Software ... Database ... Modeling ... Supercomputer ...” Zhao Yongjun said as he wrote.”Okay! I’ll immediately carry out boss Xia’s instructions! Just wait for my news!”

“Thanks!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“You’re too polite!” Zhao Yongjun said,”when you’re done, just remember to come and have a drink with me!”

“Don’t worry! “I can’t forget ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei returned to the house and smiled.””The matter of inviting the expert to give a lecture has been settled. I’ve already asked a friend to contact him. It shouldn’t be a big problem!”

“That’s great!” Chen Xuan smiled and replied,”I’ve already found some information and made a list. I think we can first find a large library and self – study the relevant knowledge. Otherwise, we won’t know anything when we meet an expert. We won’t even know where to start asking questions!”

“Hahaha! That makes sense!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”why don’t we ... Go now! The information in the National Library is definitely complete! It’s not far from here, so how about we go there?”

“I agree!” “I agree!” Chen Xuan replied. Chen Xuan said. “I agree!” Chen Xuan said.
