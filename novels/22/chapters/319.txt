Chapter 320: Two conditions (1)

Xia ruofei had just returned to the villa and parked his car when he received a call from Liang Qichao. He didn’t get out of the car and directly picked up the phone. “Brother Liang!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you must have been busy these few days!” “It’s alright, it’s alright ...” Liang Qichao said with a dry laugh. Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and asked,”what ... Is it inconvenient to talk?” Based on his understanding of Liang Qichao, he would have complained about it if there weren’t people around. He must have stayed in the warehouse for the past two days and couldn’t go anywhere. For the lively Liang Qichao, this was definitely a torture! Sure enough, Liang Qichao said,”ruofei, wait!” Cousin – Grandpa wants to talk to you. ” Xia ruofei laughed. So, she was with elder Tang. No wonder Liang Qichao did not dare to complain. “Brother Xia, I left in a hurry that day and didn’t have time to exchange contact information with you.” Elder Tang chuckled.”I was with Lil Chao, so I asked him to call you. Did I disturb you?” “I won ‘t, I won’ t.” Xia ruofei said, testing the waters.”Old man, is there something you need?” “It’s still the same thing as last time. I’ll be returning to United States in a day or two. Have you considered the matter regarding the Australian farm?” elder Tang asked. Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and said,””Old man, I’ve carefully thought about it these two days. I’m afraid I’ll have to disappoint your good intentions ...” “Oh? Is it convenient for you to tell me the reason?” Elder Tang asked calmly. “Actually, I’ve looked into your farm. It’s indeed a very good asset.” Xia ruofei explained,”but ... Because of my personal reasons, if I were to invest in agricultural products, I hope that I can at least have absolute control of the shares. So ... I’m afraid we can’t work together this time. ” Xia ruofei thought that elder Tang would give up on the cooperation after hearing his words. After all, he must have done a lot of work in the early stages of this project that was worth tens of millions of us dollars. It was not easy to acquire it. How could he let others have the controlling shares? To her surprise, elder Tang only laughed and said,””Brother Xia, if you want to control my Australian farm, 10 million USD is not enough!” Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. Could it be that there was still room for negotiation even if he wanted to control the shares? “I know that, old man,” he quickly said,”and I can’t come up with such a large sum of money for the time being. If you’re willing to give up the controlling shares, you can give me a price, and I can think of a way to raise the money. In addition, you don’t have to use the technology that you mentioned to exchange for 5 million US dollars. ” “There’s no hurry to get the money,” elder Tang said indifferently.”It’s just that ... May I know the reason why you insist on controlling the shares?” Xia ruofei was a little embarrassed as he said,””Old man, I’m very confident in my paradise brand’s series of agricultural products, and I cherish this brand very much. So, if I invest in the agricultural product industry, I hope that I can have absolute control. This way, the farm’s development ideas and strategies can be carried out according to my own will. I don’t want the brand’s development to take a wrong path and affect the brand image because of reasons I can’t control. Of course, it’s not that I don’t trust you ...” “You don’t have to explain, I understand.” Elder Tang chuckled, not angry at all.”It’s not impossible if you want to control the farm ...” In fact, the farm in Australia was not as important to elder Tang as Xia ruofei had thought. Tens of millions of dollars might be a big number to Xia ruofei, but to elder Tang, it was not a drop in the bucket. At least, it was a small amount. In reality, the reason why elder Tang bought the Australian farm was more or less for fun. He had bought many industries all over the world, and he rarely paid attention to them even after one or two years. This farm in Australia was the same. After elder Tang acquired the farm, he entrusted it to a professional team to manage. In elder Tang’s eyes, the existence of this farm was only a good place to go during his annual vacation. In addition, because of old master Tang’s love for horse racing, this farm happened to have an 1800 – meter grassland track, an all – Weather track, a swimming pool for horses, a horse training ground that could accommodate 80 horses at the same time, and other facilities. This could help him cultivate high – Quality horse racing. As for the farm’s ability to grow and breed, elder Tang didn’t care much about it. It was only after he visited Xia ruofei’s farm two days ago and tasted the Taoyuan vegetables that he suddenly thought of cooperating with Xia ruofei to run the farm. That was why elder Tang did not reject Xia ruofei’s offer immediately when he heard that the condition for the cooperation was to have absolute control of the company. Xia ruofei understood elder Tang’s meaning and quickly said,””Old man, if I can hold more than 50% of the shares, I can invest in proportion to the farm’s current value. I don’t have enough money at the moment, but I should be able to think of a way. ” Xia ruofei considered borrowing some money from MA Xiong. With his reputation, it would not be a problem to borrow 10 million USD from MA Xiong. In addition to the 10 million USD he got from selling the Phoebe zhennan two days ago, he had a total of 20 million USD. He would have no problem holding more than 50% of the shares. Elder Tang said seriously,”Xiao Xia, I’ve already said that the money is not important. As long as you agree to two of my conditions, I can allow you to hold 51% of the shares. You don’t need to fork out a single cent. You only need to invest 10 million dollars. The difference can be reduced from future dividends.” Xia ruofei was stunned when he heard this. There was such a good thing? This wasn’t just a few hundred dollars, it was a business worth tens of millions of dollars! He composed himself and said rationally,””Old man, tell me your condition first!” “Actually, these two conditions shouldn’t be too difficult for you,” elder Tang said with a smile. The first condition is that I can guarantee that I won’t interfere with the management of the farm, but you must also guarantee that your paradise vegetables will be introduced to the farms in Australia and that it will be successfully cultivated. In terms of vegetable planting, the farms in Australia must be in sync with the domestic farms. That is, once the domestic farms launch a new variety, they must also introduce it to the Australian farms as soon as possible. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”no problem!” If I become a major shareholder of the farm, I’ll naturally have to consider the farm’s interests, which is beneficial to both sides. ” “Old man, tell me about your second condition!” Xia ruofei continued.
