Chapter 3448: Qingxue stops at the eighth layer (2)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei’s heart tightened when he saw this. He subconsciously flew to the side of the Obsidian Stairway to Heaven. Ling Qingxue was thrown to the right side of the stairway by the invisible force.

Ling Qingxue had climbed about 30 to 40 meters. With Ling Qingxue’s cultivation level, even if she fell from such a height, she would not be fatally injured. However, Xia ruofei knew very well that even if a cultivator in the aura refining stage could survive falling from 10 floors, he would definitely be seriously injured. Moreover, Ling Qingxue must be in a terrible state now. She must have suffered quite a bit of damage on those steps. So, if she fell again, her life might be in danger.

Xia ruofei was a little far from Ling Qingxue. Even if he used all his speed, he would not be able to make it.

At this moment, Xia ruofei’s eyes were about to pop out of their sockets. He had no time to fly over on his sword and had instinctively rushed to the right side of the steps. He was extremely regretful now. He felt that he should have been more determined and not let Ling Qingxue climb the steps.

Even if he had to give up on this challenge, he couldn’t let Ling Qingxue come to any harm!

Xia ruofei’s speed was already at its maximum, but Ling Qingxue was falling even faster. It looked like he would not be able to catch Ling Qingxue in time.

Suddenly, a light screen appeared below Ling Qingxue.

Xia ruofei was already very familiar with this kind of light screen. In the trial Pagoda, this light screen door was the transmission channel.

Xia ruofei was relieved when he saw the screen.

It looked like Ling Qingxue’s life wasn’t in danger after failing the trial. She would only be sent out of the eighth level.

Ling Qingxue was falling very quickly, and in the blink of an eye, she had entered the range of the light screen.

Xia ruofei watched as Ling Qingxue tried her best to turn her head around and smiled at Xia ruofei.

Ling Qingxue shouted,”RUO Fei!” You have to get through this! 1’11 wait and …”

Before she could finish her sentence, her body had already disappeared into the light screen.

Then, the light door disappeared and the eighth level of the trial Pagoda returned to its original calm state.

Xia ruofei stared blankly at the spot where Ling Qingxue had disappeared. He felt lost.

Ling Qingxue had been teleported away. If nothing unexpected happened, she should not be in any life – threatening danger. However, Xia ruofei was still worried. After all, he did not know where Ling Qingxue had been teleported to and what would happen next.

However, Ling Qingxue’s words before she was teleported away still echoed in his ears.

At this time, the Obsidian steps marked with the words “Qi refining” also disappeared step by step with a rumbling sound. The entire 8th floor of the trial tower, only the Obsidian steps marked with the words “Jindan” still stood quietly.

Xia ruofei slowly turned his head to look at the stairs to his left. The stairs were made entirely of Obsidian and extended upwards. There were at least 500 to 600 steps, as if they were going to reach the sky.

Even with Xia ruofei’s eyesight, he could only vaguely see the light curtain Door at the top of the stairs.

Xia ruofei furrowed his brows slightly. He felt that this round was quite stressful.

Even though Ling Qingxue’s cultivation level was not considered the best among the Qi refining cultivators, her overall strength was definitely not inferior to a Qi refining level 9 cultivator. The main reason was that her mental power was much stronger than the average Qi refining cultivator.

With Ling Qingxue’s strength, she had only managed to reach the 178th step, which was about one – third of the entire flight of stairs.

The steps for the Aurous core stage were specially designed for Aurous core stage cultivators, so the difficulty level was obviously higher.

Xia ruofei’s cultivation was only at the intermediate stage of the Golden core realm. Even if his overall strength was stronger than many advanced stage golden core cultivators, it would still be difficult for him to pass the test of the stairway.

However, Xia ruofei had always had an unyielding spirit. It had been like this when he was in the Army. In the training that challenged the limits, without the support of a strong belief, it was impossible to persist. Ever since he had embarked on the path of cultivation, even though he had more resources than the average cultivator, without his own hard work and indomitable courage, his cultivation could not have progressed so quickly.

Furthermore, this was already the last stage of the trial Pagoda. No matter what, he had to use his last bit of strength. That way, even if he ended up like Ling Qingxue, being thrown out of the stairway halfway, he would at least have no regrets.

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei’s gaze became more determined.

He had already pushed all the distracting thoughts out of his mind, including the concern he had for Ling Qingxue. He didn’t want to think about it for now.

At this moment, his only thought was to walk up the stairway step by step until he reached the light screen door at the top.

Xia ruofei stood still, quietly adjusting his state of mind.

After a long time, he took a deep breath and walked toward the Obsidian steps marked with the word “Jindan” on the left.

When Ling Qingxue fell from the stairway, she had already seen Xia ruofei rushing over. However, she quickly judged that Xia ruofei might not be able to catch her in time, so she forcefully circulated her genuine Qi to cover her entire body, preparing herself to take the impact of the fall.

However, the light screen door soon appeared right below her.

She immediately realized that she might be teleported out of the trial Pagoda’s eighth level, so she turned to Xia ruofei and shouted,””RUO Fei! You have to get through this! 1’11 be waiting to meet up with you!”

However, before she could finish her sentence, the light curtain Door had already swallowed her.

After that familiar pulling feeling, when she once again felt her feet on the ground, she had already left the 8th floor of the Tower of Trials.

Ling Qingxue realized that a storage ring had appeared in her hand. She had no impression of it at all. If she had not subconsciously clenched her fist during the teleportation, she would not have even known that a storage ring had appeared in her hand.

Just as Ling Qingxue was about to check the storage ring, a voice rang out from behind her.””Miss Ling! You’re out too!”

When Ling Qingxue heard this familiar voice, she immediately clenched her fist and held the storage ring in her hand. Then she turned around and looked.

The person who had spoken was Chen Xuan. When Ling Qingxue turned around, she realized that she had already arrived outside the trial Pagoda. She was standing in the square at the bottom of the pagoda. Behind Chen Xuan was the majestic tower.

Furthermore, it wasn’t just Chen Xuan. All the cultivators who had come with them to explore the secret ground were basically all here.

Ling Qingxue glanced around and realized that other than Chen Xuan, there was also Xu yurou from the first heaven society, mu Jianfei from the Cang lang sect, Yang Liu from the soaring Flower Valley, and Yu xiner from the Qi cultivation realm.

In other words, other than Xia ruofei, Shen tianfang, the intermediate golden core cultivator from the first heaven society, and mu Hua, the Golden core elder from the Cang lang sect, were not here.

Xia ruofei did not tell Ling Qingxue about Shen tianfang, so she did not know that Shen tianfang had died a long time ago. Even his ashes had dissipated in the trial Pagoda.

In fact, since mu Hua didn’t appear at this moment, he was definitely in a bad situation.

However, no one, including Xia ruofei himself, knew that he was the only one who was still trying to clear the stage.

As such, Ling Qingxue did not think too much about the fact that the two golden core cultivators were not here. She thought that Shen tianfang and mu Hua were also in the process of breaking through the levels. After all, golden core cultivators were much stronger. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Young sect leader Chen!” Ling Qingxue smiled at Chen Xuan and said,”fellow Daoists, everyone is out!”

A bitter smile appeared on Chen Xuan’s face as he replied, “You’re not skilled enough! I failed the last part of the mission on the fifth floor of the trial tower and was directly sent here …. Miss Ling, the stage you went through in the trial tower should be the same as us, right? May I know which level you’ve reached, miss Ling?”
