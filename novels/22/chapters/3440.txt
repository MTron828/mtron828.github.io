“How am I cruel?” Ling Qingxue was confused.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”When I challenge the Tower of Trials, I’ll at most break a record. Getting more rewards will only allow me to take advantage of the loopholes in the rules and gain more benefits.” But you’re good, you directly dug out their Foundation. Look at the 7th level of the trial Pagoda, it’s an empty space, hahaha!”

Ling Qingxue felt a little uneasy. She said,””This … This isn’t very good! Why don’t we not take this cloud heaven Palace, I’ll put it back to its original place!” Hearing this, Xia ruofei’s eyes widened and he said,””No! Only a fool would not take the benefits! We didn’t steal or Rob, we got the benefits with our own abilities, why should we not take them! We didn’t break any rules, so even if the senior who set up the trial Pagoda were to come, he wouldn’t be able to say anything!”

“But…” Ling Qingxue looked around at the empty square and still hesitated.

“No buts! That crystal plate… That was the control core of the heavenly cloud Palace. Since it was placed in the barrier, it was clearly for everyone to take! It’s just a test to see if everyone has the ability to get it.” Xia ruofei said,”I don’t have the ability, but Qingxue, you got it with your own ability. There’s no reason for you to return it! As for the seventh level of the trial Pagoda… At most, that senior could just decorate it again. Even without the cloud Palace, wasn’t it a very easy thing for a senior to design a few stages to test cultivators? So you don’t need to feel any psychological burden, just take it with ease!”

Ling Qingxue had always been very obedient to Xia ruofei. Now that she heard Xia ruofei’s advice, she felt that it made sense. Most importantly, the environment in the heavenly cloud Palace was really good. It was also very helpful for cultivation. Ling Qingxue must have wanted it.

So, she thought for a moment and nodded.””That… That’s fine!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Qingxue, with this heavenly cloud Palace, you can do whatever you want in the world of cultivation!” Even Chen Nanfeng can’t do anything to you! If you don’t like him, you can release a few late jiedan stage monsters, it’ll be enough to make him suffer!”

Ling Qingxue pursed her lips into a smile and said,”how can it be that simple?” My cultivation is still too low. If I were in the vicinity of the heavenly cloud Palace, I would be able to mobilize those puppets and monsters, but I can’t make them leave the heavenly cloud Palace to help me fight against the enemy. I can only release the Qi refining monsters and puppets at most, and the number can’t exceed three …” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be stunned.””Ah? There’s such a restriction!”

He then changed his mind and immediately said,””But this is already not bad! At least you have enough ability to protect yourself! If there’s any danger, you can release the cloud heaven Palace and hide inside. Who can do anything to you?”

The heavenly cloud Palace was actually similar to the spiritual map, but it was obviously of a much higher level.

First of all, the spirit map scroll was an independent space. Although the heavenly cloud Palace could also be kept, it would still be together with the outside space when it was released. It was not an independent small space.

Furthermore, the time flow of the Spirit map was 30 times slower than the outside world. This was very useful at critical moments.

It could be said that the heavenly cloud Palace was far inferior to the spirit map scroll in terms of the rules of space and time.

In addition, the spirit map space could directly absorb the energy of the chaotic space and transform it into rich spiritual energy, but the cloud heaven Palace did not have such a function. Of course, the heavenly cloud Palace also had a very advanced spirit gathering formation. The concentration of spirit Qi in the entire heavenly cloud Palace was quite good, but this was limited by the external environment. If it was on earth, a place with poor cultivation resources, the best it could do was to achieve the same level as the Paradise Island, and the restrictions from the external conditions were greater.

Although the difference between the heavenly cloud Palace and the spirit map was still quite big, it was still a precious treasure for Ling Qingxue. She never even dared to dream that she would have such a treasure one day.

Of course, this was not only for Ling Qingxue. Even in the entire cultivation world on earth, a magic weapon like the heavenly cloud Palace could be considered a top treasure. If it were to fall into the hands of the cultivation world, it would definitely set off a bloody storm and cause a crazy fight. Even a veteran golden core cultivator like Chen Nanfeng would definitely not be able to resist such a temptation.

Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”that makes sense!” It seems like you don’t have to worry about my safety anymore…”

“How can I not be worried?” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”just like parents, no matter how old a child is, he’s still a child in their eyes. You’re my wife. No matter how capable you are, I’ll still be worried about your safety!”

Ling Qingxue’s face turned slightly red. She lowered her eyes and said,””I’m not your wife yet!”

“It’s only a matter of time!” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue were in a good mood. However, in the hidden space enshrouded in purple mist, the elder in the green Taoist robe was not in a good mood.

He had watched Ling Qingxue easily take the heavenly cloud Palace, and he had not been able to stop her. Now that he saw that there was only an empty square left on the seventh floor of the trial Pagoda, he wanted to cry but had no tears. At the same time, he was going crazy..
