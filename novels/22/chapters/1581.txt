Chapter 1583: Breakthrough_2

Translator: 549690339

Even if it was just an ordinary Jade, Xia ruofei would have kept it for himself. If he were to encounter this situation when the space was upgraded in the future, he might be able to deal with it.

The group of people went next door. Xia ruofei found an empty Service Desk and showed the second copy of the bid form for the raw stone. He swiped his card to pay for it and at the same time, went through the deposit procedures. The organizer of the public bid could deposit it for free for three days. After three days, the entire public bid would be over.

After doing all this, Xia ruofei and Yu mingdong took the escort company’s car back to the hotel. There was also a lot of Jade this time. Ruizhou was quite chaotic. Although Shi Lei was skilled, Yu mingdong still did not dare to take it lightly. So, he hired the escort company to help transport this batch of Jade back to the hotel.

......

“Song Wei, contact your friend in the airline. I want to ship these raw stones back to the three mountains as soon as possible.” After returning to the hotel room, Xia ruofei said,”as long as the check – in is settled, we will book the return ticket immediately!”

Song Wei felt a sense of loss. She knew that this dream – like journey was coming to an end. However, she thought about it and realized that her connection with Xia ruofei could no longer be cut off. The two of them had to cultivate together and deal with the miasma together!

At this moment, Song Wei felt for the first time that the miasma didn’t bring her all the bad things ...

“Alright, I’ll make the call now,” she nodded.

After a while, Song Wei walked over and said to Xia ruofei,””I’ve already contacted them. Air China has a flight to Sanshan tomorrow. There’s still some left in the cargo hold. I’ve already told my friend about the situation of this batch of raw stones and their approximate weight. He’ll arrange for special items to be checked in. We’ll just go to the airport tomorrow to complete the procedures.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said, What time is the flight tomorrow? What was the flight number? I’ll book the tickets online now. Let’s take the same flight back!”

“We’re leaving at 12 noon tomorrow, and I’ve already booked the tickets!”Song Wei said with a smile. Two first class seats! After checking in tomorrow, you can just change your boarding pass!”

“Hey! You’re smart enough!” Xia ruofei said,”praise him!”

“Isn’t there any substantial reward?” Song Wei asked with a smile.

“What reward do you want?” Xia ruofei asked.

Song Wei looked at Xia ruofei in embarrassment and said,””Can you ... Train with me for a while more today? I want to ...”

“You want to break through, right?” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”no problem! However, the prerequisite is that you must have a solid foundation. Anyway, with the time formation, I’ve also prepared a lot of dry food. This time, I’ll wait for you to break through to Qi disciple Level 2 before you stop cultivating!”

Originally, Xia ruofei was prepared to help Song Wei break through to Qi disciple Level 2 before leaving Ruizhou. After all, after returning to the three mountains, the two of them would not have such convenient conditions where they could cultivate together at any time. Moreover, the effect of cultivating the “Scripture of the heart of beginnings” alone would be very poor.

Of course, Xia ruofei did have other cultivation techniques. He even had a few techniques that were suitable for women. In terms of individual cultivation, they were definitely not inferior to the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra”.

However, the main purpose of Xia ruofei leading Song Wei to the path of cultivation was to get rid of the miasma. If Song Wei cultivated other martial arts, it would not do her any good to get rid of the miasma. If she wanted to get rid of the miasma on her own, who knew when she would be able to.

Furthermore, if he cultivated different martial arts, it might even interfere with the cultivation of the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra”. Hence, Xia ruofei would never do that, at least not before the threat of the peach blossom miasma was completely eliminated.

“Really?” Song Wei was overjoyed. That’s great! That’s great! RUO Fei, where are your array flags? Hurry up and take it out! Let’s start cultivating now!”

Xia ruofei said,”don’t worry!” Shouldn’t he make some preparations? Also, I have to tell President Yu that I’m leaving tomorrow. He has helped me a lot these days!”

“Yes, yes, yes. You should go and prepare first!” Song Wei said,”I’ll be waiting for you here!”

Xia ruofei nodded. He went out to Yu mingdong’s room and told him that he was leaving tomorrow.

After all, Yu mingdong had helped him a lot these past few days. It was reasonable for him to tell him that he was leaving. It would be rude to call him directly. Besides, it was only a few steps from Xia ruofei’s room to Yu mingdong’s room.

When Yu mingdong heard that Xia ruofei was going back to the three mountains, he enthusiastically urged him to stay for a few more days. However, he was not as busy as these days, so he could take Xia ruofei to enjoy the scenery of the border.

However, when he heard that Xia ruoxin had already booked her flight tickets, Yu mingdong did not keep her any longer. Instead, he warmly invited Xia ruofei to visit him when he had time. At the same time, he once again mentioned that if there was Jade in the raw stones and Xia ruofei wanted to cash it out, he would be the first person to consider.

Xia ruofei laughed it off and returned to his hotel room.

He took out a bunch of biscuits and instant noodles from his bag and placed them on the sofa in the living room. Then, he took out the array flag and set up the time array. He then stepped into the array with Song Wei.

This time, Xia ruofei was prepared for a long battle. He was afraid that Song Wei would not leave the array until she reached Level 2.

The two of them quickly entered a state of cultivation.

With time flowing more than 90 times faster, the two of them had enough time to complete their cultivation tasks.

Hence, Xia ruofei kept telling Song Wei not to be impatient and to lay a good foundation step by step so that the breakthrough would be a matter of course.

This time, the two of them stayed in the array for more than half a month.

Of course, it was impossible for them to cultivate all the time in the past half a month. Usually, they would stop after cultivating for a few hours to take a break, eat something, drink some water, and then sleep every twelve hours.

Of course, in order to save time, other than going to the bathroom to wash up after waking up, and occasionally going to the toilet, everything else was basically done in the array.

Although she had been eating dry food and sleeping on the sofa these days, Song Wei was still happy to do so. She could feel her progress at all times. The true energy in her body was also becoming more and more abundant. This feeling of being filled with power was something she had never experienced in her life.

Although she had not practiced any special combat techniques, with Song Wei’s current true Qi cultivation, as long as she used her true Qi well, even a few burly men who knew martial arts would not be her opponent.

After all, practicing martial arts and cultivating were two completely different levels.

The most important thing was that when the two of them were operating the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra”, their souls were more and more synchronized.

It was a wonderful feeling. It was as if the two of them had become one. The intimacy that came from the soul made Song Wei feel like she was in a dream.

Even Xia ruofei could not control himself. Although his rationality told him not to develop feelings for Song Wei, there seemed to be an invisible force from the depths of his soul that made him feel closer to Song Wei.

On the seventeenth day of entering the formation, the two of them were still cultivating as usual.

The true Qi that had fused with each other flowed through their meridians and energy Center. The true Qi in Song Wei’s Energy Center was also becoming more and more abundant.

Unknowingly, Xia ruofei felt that the speed of his genuine Qi circulation had increased a little as if it was out of control.

Xia ruofei was not shocked. Instead, he was happy. He knew that Song Wei was about to break through.

What was commendable was that this breakthrough was really natural. He did not deliberately try to break through the bottleneck and it happened unknowingly.

“Calm down and strengthen your control over your true Qi!” Xia ruofei said in a deep voice.

The fused true Qi quickly flowed through her meridians. The true Qi in Song Wei’s dantian also started to surge. Then, an invisible force acted on her dantian and the true Qi started to compress rapidly ...
