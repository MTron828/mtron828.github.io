Chapter 3415: Both of them broke through_l

Translator: 549690339

Ling Qingxue was initially a little nervous, especially after the Vermilion Jade Fruit ripened. Naturally, it had a strong attraction to cultivators. She had been suppressing her anxiety the whole time. However, if Xia ruofei had not held her back, she might have still walked towards the two Vermilion Jade fruits.

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but burst out laughing.””Why are you only thinking about eating! No matter how I look at it, these two fruits are a little strange. Can we really eat them?”

“Of course!” Xia ruofei said.

At this time, within the spirit map space, layman Yuntai couldn’t help but click his tongue and say,””It really is the Vermilion Jade Fruit! Fellow Daoist Xia, your luck is really…”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei quickly said,”senior Yuntai, since you’ve confirmed it, I’ll go and pick it!” Is there anything I need to pay attention to?”

“When picking the Vermilion Jade Fruit, you need to use a dry wooden sword. It’s best to use a dry pine wood sword. Otherwise, it’ll be difficult to peel them off the branches …” Said scholar Yuntai with a smile.

Xia ruofei said in surprise,”that fruit looks like it’ll fall off with just a touch!” How could it not be removed? Besides, the flying sword can cut gold and Jade, but it can’t be that it can’t even cut the branches of the fruit tree, right?”

Scholar Yuntai laughed and said,””If fellow Daoist Xia doesn’t believe me, you can try!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while, and his curiosity won. He nodded and asked,””Senior Yuntai, will I cause any harm to the Vermilion Jade Fruit if I try?”

“I won’t! Fellow Daoist Xia, you can try it yourself!” Scholar Yuntai said with a smile.

Hearing this, Xia ruofei was greatly relieved. He took out the blue immortal sword and used his spiritual energy to control the sword to cut the branch that connected the two Vermilion Jade fruits.

The branch looked very thin, and the two heavy fruits had already bent it. Under normal circumstances, even an ordinary fruit knife could be easily cut through, let alone a flying sword that could cut through iron as if it were mud.

However, when the blue travel immortal sword touched the branch, it bounced up.

Xia ruofei took a look and realized that there were no traces left on the branch.

He did not believe it, so he increased his strength and even injected a trace of primordial Qi into the blue immortal sword. But it was still to no avail. The blue immortal sword was soon swept away, and the branch also shook gently, but there was still no trace left on the branch.

Xia ruofei took two steps forward, grabbed the branch, and bent it.

He directly poured his Yuan Qi into his hand. The force was so great that it could even break a steel pipe, but the Vermilion Jade Fruit branch didn’t even move. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Ling Qingxuc also saw this scene and couldn’t help but click her tongue in wonder.”This branch is so firm … Ruofei, don’t tell me you didn’t use any strength!”

“I’ve used all my strength!” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”! didn’t expect that a golden core cultivator couldn’t even break a tree branch!”

Scholar Yuntai laughed and said,”actually, it’s not impossible to break the branch of the Vermillion Jade Fruit. If you were a nascent Soul Stage cultivator, or even an immortal soul Stage cultivator, you could still pick the fruit with brute force!” However, you’re just an early jiedan stage kid, you definitely can’t do it!”

Xia ruofei could not help but feel a sense of defeat.

Ling Qingxuc didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”Then what should we do? We can’t even pick this fruit! It seems that collecting the spoils of war isn’t that easy! We can’t just eat the fruit directly!”

Ling Qingxuc did not know that Xia ruofei had a small world Dharma Treasure and that there was a senior expert in it.

However, layman Yuntai was still able to sense everything in the outside world. This was also because Xia ruofei had let go of the seal. Otherwise, no matter how high layman Yuntai’s cultivation was, he would not be able to sense the situation outside.

After listening to Ling Qingxuc’s words, layman Yuntai couldn’t help but burst out laughing.”Fellow Daoist Xia, your Dao companion is very interesting!”

“Senior Yuntai,” Xia ruofei asked with a bitter smile,”can this Vermilion Jade Fruit tree really only be cut down with a wooden sword?”

“Indeed!” Yuntai layman said,”at first, no one knew about it, so even if they were lucky enough to find the Vermillion Jade Fruit tree, only cultivators above the nascent Soul Stage could pick it. Later, perhaps by chance, someone found out that wooden swords could easily cut off branches, especially pine wood swords, which were the most effective. Thus, it was passed down! This old master only saw it when I was reading the ancient records of my sect, I have never personally tested it.”

Xia ruofei said,”alright!” It’s a good thing I have senior’s guidance, otherwise I would really be ‘disappointed’! It’s really like having a treasure in the house!”

“Hahaha! Fellow Daoist Xia, try using the wooden sword! It’d be best if it’s a pine wood sword!” Scholar Yuntai said with a smile.

“Alright!”

After Xia ruofei finished speaking, he looked at Ling Qingxue and smilcd.””Don’t worry, I have an idea!”

With that, Xia ruofei immediately connected to the spirit map space and started searching.

There were no pine trees planted in Xia ruofei’s spirit map space, so it was not easy to find a pine wood sword. However, he soon discovered that he had bought a pine wood sofa and placed it in the mountain sea realm.

Xia ruofei’s face lit up with joy. This was a ready – made pine wood! And it was absolutely dry!

Hence, Xia ruofei contacted Xia Qing with his divine sense and asked Xia Qing to pick a random sofa from this set, tear off the legs of the sofa, and then cut it into the shape of a sword..
