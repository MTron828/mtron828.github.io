2300 The famous doctor Ge Jun_However, his brain injury had already recovered, and his blood circulation was normal. He just didn’t respond to external stimuli.

Xia ruofei had a feeling that song Qiming’s condition might be related to his soul. The possibility was very high.

Could it be that he had to try some methods to nurture his soul? Xia ruofei muttered in his heart.

He looked at song Qiming, who was lying on the bed, and decided to wait and see how he was doing.

It would be better to move to another Ward. There were cameras everywhere in the ICU, and it was inconvenient to enter and exit.

According to Xia ruofei’s plan, it would be best to go home for treatment. However, he knew that Fang Liyun would definitely not agree to it. Besides, the organization would have many concerns. For the time being, he could only go through the trouble of staying in the hospital for treatment.

Once song Qiming regained his consciousness, Xia ruofei could take him home for further rehabilitation.

Xia ruofei was planning in his heart. He did not have many ways to deal with the damage to his soul. The pregnancy soup was an option, but he did not think that it would be very effective. Song Wei had taken a lot of it back then, but it was basically useless.

Besides, there was a seven – day interval between each use of the soup. Xia ruofei could not use the array flags in the hospital, so it was not appropriate.

Of course, it was also possible to take one to test his luck.

In addition to the gestation soup, the only other way was to use the heart – concentrating grass. This kind of spiritual grass was very precious in the cultivation world. There was no doubt that it had a nourishing effect on the soul. It could even improve a person’s soul talent, allowing those who were originally unable to cultivate to step onto the path of cultivation.

Ling Qingxue’s talent and physique changed after she took the heart concentrating grass, and she began to cultivate the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” smoothly.

When Song Wei’s soul was severely injured, she only woke up after taking the medicine made from the heart – concentrating grass.

Hence, Xia ruofei had some confidence.

Of course, the heart – concentrating grass was very precious. If one wanted to grow it quickly with the time formation, they would have to pay a great price. It would take at least four to five spiritual crystals to provide the energy needed for its growth.

Hence, Xia ruofei would not use the heart – concentrating grass rashly. He had to at least make sure that song Qiming’s deep coma was caused by his soul.

Xia ruofei sat quietly and thought a lot.

Before he knew it, it was almost time. He stood up and checked on song Qiming’s condition. Then, he retrieved the silver needles in an orderly manner.

There were a lot of things to pay attention to when withdrawing the needles. Which acupuncture point to withdraw first and which acupuncture point to withdraw later could not be messed up at all. Otherwise, it could backfire and even cause danger.

Moreover, withdrawing the needles was not as simple as simply pulling out the silver needles. It also required a series of complicated techniques, such as pulling, twisting, or flicking ...

Xia ruofei was already very familiar with it and easily kept all the silver needles in a short while.

He did not know that professor Chen, who was in the “command Hall” of the operating area opposite him, had seen everything.

Professor Chen was an expert in the field of neurosurgery. He specialized in Western medicine, so he did not have much reaction to Xia ruofei’s needle withdrawing technique. However, when the silver – haired old man beside him saw Xia ruofei’s skilled technique, his pupils could not help but shrink and he revealed a shocked expression.

The silver – haired old man gasped and cried out,””This technique ... Is the six cloud contact needles? How could this be ... No! He had used eight silver needles! This ... This ...”

Professor Chen saw the silver – haired old man lose his composure and quickly asked,””Uncle GE! Is there a problem?”

The silver – haired old man muttered,”little Chen, this young man’s acupuncture technique is very special!” Although I only saw the process of him withdrawing the needle, I felt a sense of deja vu ...”

As an expert in neurosurgery and a civilian Major General who enjoyed special subsidies from the State Council, professor Chen still considered himself a junior in front of this white – haired old man. Moreover, this silver – haired old man naturally called him “little Chen.” It was clear that he had a powerful background.

In fact, this silver – haired old man was professor Chen’s elder. Professor Chen was from a family of doctors. When his father was alive, he was a very skilled Chinese medicine practitioner. This silver – haired old man, Ge Jun, was also a Chinese medicine master. He was very close to professor Chen’s father and the two of them had always called each other brothers.

Even though professor Chen did not follow his father’s wishes to inherit his legacy and instead studied Western medicine, he had been influenced since he was young and was filled with respect for the profound Chinese medicine. He also respected the world – famous doctor, Ge Jun, from the bottom of his heart.

This time, Ge Jun came to the three mountains to visit an old friend and to relax.

His father’s best friend had come to San Shan. Naturally, professor Chen had to welcome him warmly. He had planned to invite Ge Jun to dinner tonight, but he did not expect to encounter song Qiming’s emergency. As the most authoritative expert in the neurosurgery department of the General Hospital, professor Chen naturally could not leave.

He did not even have the time to say anything before he rushed into the operating theater.

It was not until the surgery was completed and song Qiming was sent to the intensive care unit with Xia ruofei that professor Chen had the time to call Ge Jun and cancel the banquet tonight with deep apologies.

Ge Jun was also a doctor, so he naturally understood this profession. He was not angry because of this. Instead, he asked professor Chen about the emergency treatment with a trace of concern.

Although song Qiming’s identity was special, Ge Jun was one of the top Chinese medicine masters in China. He was also a member of the health care group of the higher – ups, so professor Chen did not have to hide it from him.

Professor Chen briefly explained song Qiming’s sadness and his own judgment. At the same time, he also mentioned Xia ruofei’s “interlude.” In fact, as a top brain surgery expert, professor Chen thought that Xia ruofei’s efforts would be in vain, and even a little ridiculous.

However, when Ge Jun heard that someone had tried to use Traditional Chinese Medicine to treat the injured in such a serious situation, his curiosity was piqued and he could not help but ask a few more questions.

Although professor Chen studied Western medicine, he had been in a Traditional Chinese Medicine family for many years. He was not completely unfamiliar with Chinese medicine. However, Xia ruofei had used an array to interfere with the cameras. Professor Chen did not have much information on the treatment process, so he only told Ge Jun what he knew.

The main point was that Xia ruofei had used acupuncture. After all, when song Qiming was transferred to the ICU, the silver needles were still stuck in his body!

Ge Jun carefully asked about the acupuncture points of the silver needles. After listening, he became more and more interested because he could roughly guess the purpose of Xia ruofei’s acupuncture.

From Ge Jun’s point of view, this young Chinese medicine doctor’s level was quite good. In addition, such a serious injury case was very rare. Ge Jun’s occupational disease could not help but act up and he decided to take a look personally.

The hotel he was staying at was not far from the hospital. Although professor Chen had to stay at the hospital, it was easy to arrange a car to pick him up.

Hence, in a short while, Ge Jun arrived at the General Hospital and was led by professor Chen to the monitoring Hall of the operating area. He happened to see the scene of Xia ruofei withdrawing the needle.

Professor Chen was surprised to see Ge Jun so interested in Xia ruofei’s acupuncture technique.

At this moment, Ge Jun said excitedly,””Xiao Chen, I want to meet this young man. Can you make some arrangements?”

Professor Chen hesitated and said,””Uncle GE, this young man isn’t a doctor from our hospital. Moreover, his intervention in Secretary song’s treatment was under the special instructions of the Bureau chief in Beijing. I don’t know his backstory ... How about this? I’ll go ask him for his opinion first. “
