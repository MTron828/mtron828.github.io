The car soon arrived at the Wangfujing Hilton Hotel where Xia ruofei and Feng Rao were staying.

To Feng Jing’s surprise, Tang Yitian’s family didn’t send them home. Instead, they got off the car and walked into the hotel.

A world – Class rich man with a net worth of tens of billions of dollars actually valued Xia ruofei so much. Feng Jing saw that Xia ruofei didn’t seem surprised at all. He didn’t even say any polite words and walked into the hotel naturally. She was even more surprised. She felt that she didn’t know much about her boss. The more she interacted with him, the more mysterious she felt Xia ruofei was.

In fact, Xia ruofei wanted to check on Tang Haoran’s cultivation progress. Tang Yitian and his wife had never treated Xia ruofei as an ordinary person. Instead, they treated him as an equal friend. They even treated him with respect. Sending Xia ruofei to his room was the most basic courtesy.

The group of them walked into the hotel and went into the elevator.

Xia ruofei’s room was on the same floor as Feng Jing ‘s. However, as they had booked a Business Suite, the two rooms were at the corners of the corridor.

After getting out of the elevator, the two of them had to walk in two different directions.

Feng Rao stopped and said to Xia ruofei,””Chairman, the choice of the spokesperson this time is my mistake. I will self – reflect in the company’s regular meeting when I go back. At the same time, I ask the company to deduct my salary and benefits as punishment.”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.”This has nothing to do with you. It’s the media’s fault. She’s obviously a woman with a bad character and an unreasonable personality, but she’s been promoted as a pure and innocent girl!”

“It’s mainly because time was a little tight, and my connections in the entertainment industry are limited. It’s my fault that I didn’t get to know the truth!” Feng Jing said, a little embarrassed.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ve already said that this has nothing to do with you. Don’t feel burdened.” Go back to your room and have a good rest for the night. If there’s anything important, we’ll talk about it tomorrow!”

Feng Jing saw Tang Yitian’s family waiting at the side and knew that they probably had something to say to Xia ruofei. She nodded and said,””I understand, Chairman ... Oh right, the work here can’t be carried out for the time being. I’m preparing to return to San Shan tomorrow. I’ll hurry up and find a new spokesperson.”

“There’s no hurry!” Xia ruofei frowned slightly and said,”President Feng, you’re giving yourself too much pressure. We don’t have to push forward the promotion of jaded skin cream. We have to have a sense of relaxation! Otherwise, your body won’t be able to take it. ”

“I know ...” Feng Jing was a little down.”It’s just that it’s fine to stay in Beijing now. I might as well go back earlier. I can’t really let go of the company ...”

At this moment, Jennifer suddenly said,””Feng, I think Xia is right. Only by learning to relax can you work better. We’re planning to tour the capital in the next two days. Why don’t you come with us?”

“Jennifer, thank you so much for your invitation,” Feng Jing said,”but ... You know ... We’re in a hurry to find a spokesperson for our new product ...”

Jennifer smiled and said,”even if it’s urgent, it can’t be within a day or two!” Xia is a good boss. I’m sure he’ll be willing to give you two days of paid leave. ”

Then, Jennifer winked at Xia ruofei with a smile.

Xia ruofei immediately replied,”yes!” The company will pay for all the expenses! Boss Feng, you can stay here and relax for two days, then come back to the three mountains with me!”

“But ...” Feng Jing said hesitantly.

“Feng, you don’t have to worry too much about the spokesperson.” Jennifer smiled and said,”you Chinese have a saying: There’s no way out for the mountains and rivers, but there’s a ray of hope at the end of the tunnel ... Maybe the turning point will appear soon!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.

Jennifer’s level of Chinese was actually barely passable, but she especially liked to use idioms, and often the words did not get the meaning. Today, she actually used such a long common phrase, and what was rare was that the sentence was very accurate here. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Hearing Xia ruofei and Jennifer’s words, Feng Rao could only nod helplessly and say,””Alright then ...”

Although Xia ruofei was her Chairman, sometimes she could still argue with reason and even take advantage of her female advantage to act coquettishly. However, Jennifer was a guest after all, and her status was there. She was indeed too embarrassed to refuse Jennifer’s warm invitation.

Xia ruofei saw that Feng Jing had agreed and smiled.””President Feng, then you should go back to your room and have a good rest! Don’t even think about it!”

“Alright, Chairman,” Feng Jing nodded. Then ... Mr. Tang, Jennifer, I’ll be going back first. ”

Tang Yitian and Jennifer nodded with a smile. Feng Rao patted Tang Haoran’s head and said with a smile,””Goodbye, Haoran!”

“See you tomorrow, Auntie Feng!” Tang Haoran said sensibly.

Feng Rao was rarely addressed as ‘Auntie’. Her smile froze for a moment when she heard that. However, when she remembered that Tang Haoran was Xia ruofei’s student, she immediately felt relieved. She waved at Tang Haoran with a strange expression and walked back to her room.

Xia ruofei led Tang Yitian’s family to another corridor and back to her room.

“Big brother Tang, sister – in – Law, please take a seat first!” As Xia ruofei spoke, he picked up the kettle to get some water and prepared to make tea.
