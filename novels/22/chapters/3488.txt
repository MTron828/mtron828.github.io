Xia ruofei looked at Ling Qingxue in amusement and said,” “Many stages are not completely dependent on one’s cultivation level. Qingxue was able to pass those stages not only because of her ability, but also because of luck.”

Ling Qingxue smiled awkwardly and said,” “Yes, yes, yes, I’m just lucky …”

Since he couldn’t tell Song Wei the details of the two of them clearing the stage together, he could only attribute it to luck that she made it to the eighth stage. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Song Wei continued to look at Ling Qingxue with admiration and said,” “Qingxue, whether it’s luck or not, you’re amazing! His results are actually the same as RUO Fei’s!”

Yes, in order to avoid trouble, Xia ruofei and Song Wei said the same thing. They said that he was also eliminated in the eighth round. This was the same as what they had told Chen Nanfeng and the others at the resort.

As for the actual situation, that was a shared secret between Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue.

Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei and said,” “Let’s not talk about this anymore! Wei Wei, RUO Fei and 1 brought Huang Yujing and the Vermillion Jade Fruit from the secret realm. They’ll help you greatly in improving your cultivation. Use them as soon as you get to the Paradise Island! RUO Fei has been talking about it all the way!”

Xia ruofei was speechless. Ling Qingxue was the one who had been talking to Song Wei along the way. She wanted Song Wei to improve her cultivation as soon as possible so that the gap between them would not be too big. Why did it change after they met?

However, he could guess Ling Qingxue’s thoughts. She must have wanted the relationship between the three of them to be more harmonious, so he didn’t say anything. In fact, he was a little touched.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”actually, Weiwei can use the Topaz essence to improve her spiritual power cultivation. After all, it’ll take more than two hours to reach Paradise Island!” There’s no danger in using the yellow jade essence, and once the black Phoenix flying ship is at full speed, it’ll be very safe in the air.”

At full speed, even a late – Stage golden core cultivator would not be able to catch up to the black Phoenix flying ship. The first heaven sect’s jadewater flying ship was considered very fast, but it was still much slower than the black Phoenix flying ship. Therefore, theoretically, it was very safe to take the black Phoenix flying ship at full speed on earth.

Unless someone had predicted the black Phoenix flying ship’s flight path and set up a formation trap in the air.

Predicting the black Phoenix flying ship’s flight path in the vast world was an almost impossible task, not to mention setting up an array formation in the air. All the materials needed to make the array formation needed to be used in the air. In the current cultivation world on earth, this was an almost impossible task.

Of course, there were some hidden experts in the world of cultivation who might have already reached the nascent Soul Stage or had a flying magic treasure that was faster than the black Phoenix flying ship. This was something that could not be ruled out. However, the probability of this happening was extremely small and could be ignored.

Therefore, the black Phoenix flying ship’s safety was still extremely high at full speed.

When Ling Qingxue heard this, she immediately nodded and said,””Yes, yes, yes! It’s very safe to use the Topaz essence to increase your mentality. Vivian, you can start absorbing the Topaz essence now! I’ll teach you!”

Ling Qingxue took out her storage ring as she spoke. She couldn’t wait to take out all the yellow jade essence from the storage ring and arranged them neatly on the cabin floor.

Song Wei was a little stunned and quickly said,””Qingxue, since this Topaz essence is so helpful to your spiritual power, you should use it yourself! RUO Fei was the one who needed to improve his strength! Let’s just slowly cultivate it… Or you can use it! After all, this is the reward you’ve worked so hard to get!”

Ling Qingxue said casually,”we’ve already absorbed a lot in the trial Pagoda!” These are specially reserved for you! Besides, RUO Fei’s spiritual power has just broken through to the spiritualization boundary, and it will be difficult for him to make a major breakthrough in a short period of time. Even if he absorbs these eight hundred Topaz essences, it won’t improve his spiritual power much. If it’s you who uses it, the effect will be immediate!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Weiwei, Qingxue is right. This is her kind intention. Don’t reject it!”

“Yeah! Stop dawdling!” Ling Qingxue said,”I’ve already discussed this with RUO Fei. Come and sit down. 1’11 teach you how to use it. It’s very simple!”

Song Wei hesitated for a moment and looked at Xia ruofei. Then, she nodded and said,”Then … Alright!”

Absorbing the yellow jade essence was indeed very simple. One only needed to use their mental power to touch the surface of the yellow jade essence.

Therefore, after Ling Qingxue explained it to Song Wei, she immediately learned it.

Naturally, Song Wei could tell that Ling Qingxue and Xia ruofei were sincere in giving the Topaz essence to her. The two of them had brought back the Topaz essence from the mystic Luna realm hundreds of thousands of miles away and found her as soon as they returned to earth. This made her very touched. She did not refuse and sat down cross – legged to absorb it.

Song Wei’s spiritual power level was similar to Ling Qingxue’s. Their cultivation progress was almost the same, so when they first started absorbing the Topaz essence, the effect was immediate.

She sat on the ground and began to absorb the energy contained in the yellow jade essence. One by one, the yellow jade essence was turned into powder under her absorption..
