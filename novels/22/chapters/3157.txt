After hearing Xia ruofei’s question, Wang Chi showed a look of admiration.

The layman watched the show, while the expert watched the tricks.

From Xia ruofei’s question, Wang Chi and the other experts could tell that Xia ruofei was really listening and could understand what they were talking about. It was not a meeting for show.

Wang Chi thought about it seriously for a while before saying,””President Xia, this is what we’ve been thinking about regarding the questions you’ve raised ...” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Then, Wang Chi began to explain the solutions they had come up with when they encountered these problems.

Guo Qian and Li Yufu were also listening attentively.

Wang Chi had long given up on the idea of doing errands. He was really serious about the academic Exchange.

When he got excited, he asked the staff to find a whiteboard, then he walked to the front and wrote down some key parts of the program on the whiteboard with a marker. He explained their ideas while writing.

Guo Qian and Li Yufu also joined the discussion. They weren’t questioning the academician, but they were discussing Wang Chi’s plan from an academic point of view.

The clash of ideas between the three industry big names could be said to be wonderful.

Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan naturally benefited a lot from it. They listened and noted it down, and their faces even revealed a look of enlightenment.

In theory, Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan were at least qualified. However, in terms of practical experience, none of the experts here were qualified.

The ingenious ideas of the three experts seemed to have opened a new door for Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan. The two of them were mesmerized.

In fact, Chen Xuan was reminded of the time when he had just stepped into the Qi refinement stage, when he had been enlightened by the teachings of the elders of the sect.

It was as if a mess had been sorted out in an instant. That comfortable feeling was enough to cure all OCD patients.

Without realizing it, everyone’s discussion on the method of elimination had been going on for more than an hour, but they had no intention of stopping.

Even Wang Chi had found a new way of thinking from this discussion.

If he were to design this plan now, he felt that he would definitely be able to find a more concise and effective method.

The staff had already filled everyone’s cups with water many times. When the experts were excited, they would go on and on, so the water consumption naturally increased.

As for song Rui, Ling Qingxue, and Song Wei, who just came back from the restaurant, they were listening to a heavenly book. They were all speaking Chinese, but they couldn’t understand a single sentence when they were combined together ...

Wang Chi and the others didn’t end the discussion until 1:30 in the afternoon.

It was Xia ruofei’s suggestion. Otherwise, they could have talked for the whole afternoon.

These scholars were so immersed in the atmosphere of academic discussion that they completely forgot about the Paradise Club’s services.

Xia ruofei felt that the experts were not young anymore, especially Wang Chi. If something bad happened to him, he would not be able to bear the responsibility. Hence, he could not help but interrupt their discussion and ask them to go to the dining room for lunch.

Wang Chi and the others wanted to chat a little longer, so they all said that they were not hungry.

However, Xia ruofei said that they could eat while they chatted. If they were not satisfied, they could continue eating in the meeting room. They left the meeting room reluctantly and took the electric car with Xia ruofei and the others to the restaurant in the main building to eat.

Xia ruofei was the one who organized the exchange meeting, so Zhao Yongjun and song Rui were very concerned about him.

Therefore, today’s lunch was especially sumptuous.

He had used the best Drunken Eight Immortals wine and ordered the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ from the lingji private restaurant. He had prepared it in advance yesterday. After all, many ingredients needed to be stewed with warm fire.

In addition to the Ling’s private kitchen’s signature dishes, they also had the club’s Western restaurant’s star chef personally cook exquisite and delicious Western food. There was steak, foie gras, caviar, escargot, and so on. The ingredients used for these Western dishes were all top – grade ingredients that had been air – flown over. After going through the skillful hands of a Michelin star chef, they looked, smelled, and were all complete.

This meal that combined Chinese and Western cuisine made several experts praise it, saying that such delicious food could not be found in the entire capital.

Everyone drank and savored the food while continuing The Unfinished Conversation in the meeting room.

It was a wonder to drink with an academic discussion.

However, the three experts and professors were enjoying it. When the discussion reached its peak, they said,”this place is wonderful, it’s time for a Great White!” Then, he raised his head and drank, letting them experience the pride of a young man.

After the meal, Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan were not drunk at all. It could be said that they had gained a lot. They already had a rough idea of how to solve the floating point pattern.

The three experts and Feng Xiaoyi, Wang Chi’s PhD student, were almost drunk, and their steps were unsteady.

Hence, Xia ruofei called song Rui over and said,””Xiao Rui, arrange for the specialists to soak in the hot spring to sober up. Then, if they have any needs, do your best to satisfy them. Just put it on my tab.”

“Aren’t you slapping my face!” Song Rui asked,”what do you mean by putting it on your tab? The other shareholders will definitely not have any objections. ”

“There’s no need ... It’s rare for me to come to the club, and the dividends are all lying on my account.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”that’s it then! I’m really not being polite with you guys!”

Song Rui pouted and said,”fine, fine, fine!” I know you’re a tycoon! However, you just have to listen to us. Brother Zhao has already arranged it. If you don’t have anything to do here, you can go and do your own things! Don’t forget about the drinking tonight! Houzi and the others will be coming over!”

“Don’t worry, I won’t forget!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll rest at the clubhouse this afternoon. I won’t be going out.” When it’s dinner time, just call me!”

“Alright!” “Okay,” song Rui nodded and said. Then, he led the staff to arrange Wang Chi’s next performance.

Xia ruofei led Mu Sheng and the others to the villa above the array.

The lakeside villa wasn’t big, but it was the place with the densest spiritual Qi in the entire club.

They were all cultivators, so they naturally loved this kind of environment.

Walking into the villa, Mu Sheng couldn’t help but praise,””Little brother Xia, the concentration of spiritual energy in your array core is comparable to some places in our sect! This is really a treasure land!”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”it’s similar to the corners of your sect with the thinnest spiritual Qi!” Senior mu, please don’t make fun of our poor and remote village!”

“I’m not joking, little brother Xia. I’m really surprised that you can open up such a place in the secular world!” Mu Sheng said with a smile.

Liu Mansha also said with a smile,”it’s said that the future generations are fearsome. Fellow Daoist Xia has perfectly interpreted this word!”

Xia ruofei quickly raised his hands and begged for mercy,””Two seniors, please let me go! I’m blushing from all the praise!”

Everyone couldn’t help but burst out laughing. Ling Qingxue, Song Wei, and Yu xiner covered their mouths and laughed.

Xia ruofei said,”everyone can look around. You can also find a place to rest. The spiritual energy in this basement is the densest. You can also go down and cultivate.” I’ll discuss a specific solution with brother Chen!”

Mu Sheng quickly said,”it’s more important for you to get back to your business!” Don’t mind us!”

“Brother Chen, please sit here!” Xia ruofei pointed at the tea table in the corner of the living room and smiled.”Let’s make tea and chat!”

...

Chen Xuan nodded his head and smiled,””Alright!”

The two of them sat around the tea table. Xia ruofei took out some tea leaves and said with a smile,””Brother Chen, after listening to today’s expert exchange, do you have any thoughts?”

“Seeing is better than hearing!” Chen Xuan chuckled.”There’s still a difference between theory and practice. Furthermore, I feel that if we were to really try it out, we might encounter all sorts of problems.”

“That’s for sure!” Xia ruofei started to boil the water and said,”but when that time comes, we can only rely on ourselves to solve it slowly. I think our biggest gain today is the method that experts and professors use to solve practical problems. It’s something that can’t be mastered no matter how many theories we learn. ”

It was like doing questions before the college entrance examination. After one was familiar with it to a certain extent, it didn’t make much sense to do the same type of questions. Brushing up on questions was actually brushing up on the thought process of solving the questions, the thought process of solving different types of questions.

Xia ruofei continued.”I already have a rough plan in my head. Brother Chen, I’m sure you’ve gained a lot from this, right?”

“I did gain something,” Chen Xuan said with a smile. Brother Xia, I’ll leave this crucial calculation to you!”

“Oh? Don’t you want to try, brother Chen?” Xia ruofei asked curiously.

“I also want to! However, I don’t have as much time as brother Xia ...”Chen Xuan chuckled in embarrassment.” I just received an email from my department’s boss. He said that there are a few bugs in another group’s code that can’t be solved. He wants me to help him take a look. As you know, finding bugs is more troublesome than writing code, so ...”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He stared at Chen Xuan for a long time before he said helplessly,””Fine! You’re such an outstanding employee, I can’t bear to let you leave the company ... Okay! Brother Chen, let’s exchange our thoughts first! I’ll summarize our opinions and try to come up with a plan first!”

“Alright!” Chen Xuan agreed readily.

...

Next, Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan discussed the specific implementation plan, which mainly revolved around the algorithm.

After the exchange, both of them had some inspiration, and many of them were similar, so the discussion process was very smooth.

In the end, Xia ruofei said,”brother Chen, I think it’s almost done. However, sharpening a knife will not delay the work of cutting wood. Before I write the algorithm, I still need to do one thing.”
