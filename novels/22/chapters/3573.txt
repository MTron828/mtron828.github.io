Chapter 3574: The first day of the new year (2)

Translator: 549690339

Since it was the first day of the first lunar month, Hu Zi’s mother didn’t stop Lin Qiao from receiving the red packet. Instead, she said,”Alright, alright! Hurry up and have breakfast! You only know how to pester your brother ruofei all day long!”

“He’s my brother!” Lin qiaojiao said angrily.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”yes, yes, yes!” Qiao’ er is so cute, I can’t wait for you to pester me all day!”

“Brother ruofei, you haven’t thought about visiting me on Heron Island for such a long time …” Lin Qiao pouted.

“What are you saying, girl? Do you think everyone is as free as you? If your brother Fei is so busy every day, he wouldn’t have the time to go to Heron Island to see you!” Hu Zi’s mother rebuked.

Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s my fault. I’ve been a little busy recently. I haven’t been to godmother’s place often. 1’11 change in the future!”

“Ruofei, don’t listen to Qiao’ er’s nonsense!” Hu ‘Zi’s mother quickly said,”I’m in great health now and can take care of myself. Young people should take care of their careers. Just come and visit me when you have time!”

“There’s still me!” Lin Qiao said,”brother ruofei, you don’t have to go to Heron Island. But if you go to Heron Island or the nearby city for work, you must remember to visit me!”

“Mm! I will!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”let’s go for breakfast!”

“Yes, yes, yes! Breakfast! Eat your breakfast!” Hu Zi’s mother said.

The breakfast on the first day of the first lunar month was the first meal of the year. As usual, the people at San Shan had to eat vegetarian food.

This was because, apart from vegetarians, very few people could not eat meat for a long time. The first meal of a year meant that they had been eating vegetables for the whole year. It was also a way to express their piety. This was a custom that had been passed down for many years.

Therefore, there was no meat or fish in today’s breakfast.

Since he couldn’t use oil, he naturally couldn’t eat meat and eggs.

However, Hu Zi’s mother’s cooking skills were very good. Her vegetarian breakfast was also very delicious, and there was a variety of dishes.

Fried rice cakes, fried tofu, stir – fried bean sprouts, boiled cabbage … Every dish tasted pretty good.

Xia ruofei was full of praise as he ate. Lin Qiao, who was not a vegetarian, also ate with relish.

After breakfast, Xia ruofei helped to clean up the dishes. Then, he asked,””Godmother, what are your plans for the next few days?”

“I still have a few relatives in Changping. Some of them are even elders. I have to go and pay them a New Year visit, so I might be going back to my hometown to stay for a few days.” Hu Zi’s mother said.

“Mom, 1 don’t want to go to Changping. I don’t want to pay New Year’s greetings!” Lin Qiao pouted.

Lin Qiao’s reaction wasn’t because she despised the poor and favored the rich. She was just a little resentful. After Lin Hu’s death, Hu Zi’s mother was seriously ill. During that period, Lin Qiao could be considered to have experienced the fickleness of the world. In order to treat her mother’s illness, she borrowed money from many relatives. However, these relatives who usually visited her often avoided her like snakes and scorpions. No one reached out to help her at all.

In their eyes, Hu Zi’s mother could not be saved and Lin Qiao was all alone. She had not even graduated from high school at that time. How could she be able to pay off the debt? Therefore, once the money was lent out, it would most likely be for naught.

Now, Lin Qiao and her mother were Living a Good Life with Xia ruofei’s help, but she still couldn’t forget what happened in the past.

It was impossible for her to pay her New Year greetings to her relatives.

Hu ‘er’s mother sighed and said,””Qiao’ er, no matter what, they are your elders. It’s only right for you to visit them and pay your respects on New Year’s Eve, right?”

“I don’t have such a heartless elder.” Lin Qiao pouted and said,”mom, don’t say anymore. 1 don’t want to go anywhere. I’ll just stay at home.” Also, you’re not allowed to go! Have you forgotten how they treated you back then?”

“We’re from the countryside,” Hu Zi’s mother said,”everyone isn’t very well – off. It’s only natural that they didn’t want to lend us money. 1 didn’t blame them…”

“Qiao’ er…” Xia ruofei said,”there’s a saying that goes,’if you’re rich, you’ll help the world; if you’re poor, you’ll be good for yourself.’ 1 guess your relatives ‘families are not very well – off, so they chose to be good for themselves. This is understandable.”

“I don’t blame them. The money is theirs. It’s up to them to decide whether to lend it or not. 1 don’t want to hold them back with morals.” Lin Qiao said,”however, I’m sorry that I can’t pay them a New Year’s visit. I’m not a saint H

Xia ruofei and Hu Zi’s mother looked at each other and saw the helplessness in each other’s eyes.

In fact, Lin Qiao had always been a sensible girl. It was rare for her to disobey her mother’s order.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”Qiao’ er, since you don’t want to go, then don’t go.”

Then, he said to Hu Zi’s mother,””Godmother, since Qiao’ er has said so, let him stay at home! I’m just on my way to Changping County, so I’ll send you back!”

“Brother ruofei…” Lin Qiao saw that Xia ruofei did not fully support her opinion and even asked Hu Zi’s mother to return to Changping. She was naturally very uncomfortable.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Qiao’ er, since godmother has such a heart, you should support her. It’s fine if you don’t want to go, but if godmother wants to go, don’t stop her. Everyone has their own freedom!”

Lin Qiao nodded and said,”okay!” Then 1 don’t care anymore, mom, you can go if you want! 1’11 stay and look after the house!”

Seeing that Lin Qiao had made up her mind, Hu Zi’s mother could only nod helplessly.

Xia ruofei stood up and said,”Godma, let’s go!” You can just take my car!”

Yesterday, Xia ruofei had driven his Knight XV SUV here. The car was parked in the public parking space of the community.

He and Hu’s mother went downstairs and got into the Knight XV SUV.

The car drove in the direction of Changping County.

Actually, Xia ruofei had no intention of going to Changping. However, for the sake of Hu Zi’s mother, he made up an excuse.

Peach blossom company’s farm was in Changping, and the manufacturing plant had also opened a branch in Changping. As the chairman, it was normal for Xia ruofei to go to Changping to inspect and guide them. That was why Hu Zi’s mother did not doubt Xia ruofei’s words.

The car drove smoothly on the swirling highway, then turned to the airport Highway. The airport was located on the seaside of Changping County.

Xia ruofei sent Hu ‘Zi’s mother to the entrance of her family’s village.

After the car was parked, Xia ruofei jumped out of the car first. He jogged to the other side of the car and opened the door. He helped Hu Zi’s mother out of the car. Knight XV of the radiant church had a very high chassis, and it was not very convenient for an older person to get up and down.

“I don’t blame them. The money is theirs. It’s up to them to decide whether to lend it or not. 1 don’t want to hold them back with morals.” Lin Qiao said,”however, I’m sorry, I can’t go and pay my New Year’s greetings to them. I’m not a saint…” Xia ruofei and Hu Zi’s mother looked at each other and saw the helplessness in each other’s eyes.
