Chapter 1185: Jaded skin cream press conference (2)_1

Translator: 549690339

At twoo’ clock in the afternoon, the warm – up music gradually weakened, and the lights in the venue also slowly dimmed.

The spotlight shone on the entrance of the stage, and everyone stopped chatting and looked in the direction of the stage.

Backstage, Feng Jing, who had changed into a black professional suit and put on light makeup, put on a microphone with the help of Liu Qian. She held a remote control for a PowerPoint presentation. After taking a deep breath, she walked onto the stage with a confident smile on her face.

The spotlight followed Feng Jing’s footsteps to the center of the stage.

Feng Rao could only see darkness below the stage, but she couldn’t see clearly. However, the grand stage, the huge screen behind her, and the huge Stadium all made her feel like she was in a dream.

She took a deep breath, then pressed the remote control button on the PowerPoint. A deep starry sky immediately appeared on the big screen behind her. The stars gathered from the distant deep space, and finally formed a few big flashing words on the screen, which were the peach blossom company’s new product launch.

At the same time, Feng Jing said,””Ladies, gentlemen, and friends! I’m Feng Jing, the General Manager of paradise Corporation. Today, our company will be launching an epoch – making new product! Before the press conference officially begins, please allow me to introduce the guests!”

Then, Feng Jing picked up the cue card in her hand. On it was a name list that her team had compiled a few minutes ago. She glanced at it and smiled.”The founder and CEO of kyokuboku group, Mr. Liu Dong!”

Liu Dong stood up unhurriedly, buttoned the first button of his suit, and bowed slightly to the audience in a very elegant manner.

A small half of the audience were the kyokuboku group’s employees and their family members. The rest of the audience had also heard of Liu Dong’s name, so they immediately gave him a warm round of applause.

“Ms. Zhong Yuan, general manager of the gold rush group’s Beijing branch!”

“Mr. Shen Zhou, the Chairman and CEO of Weiping mall!”

“Jumei mall’s CEO, Mr. Cheng Cheng!”

......

Behind each name, there was a powerful e – commerce company.

It was rare for an unknown company to have so many bosses in the e – commerce industry attending an ordinary new product launch.

The old reporters in the media stands had already sensitively discovered the news point. They kept taking photos and videos, and some had already begun to draft a script. No matter what the content of today’s press conference was, it would be quite a hot piece of news.

After introducing the guests, Feng Rao went straight to the point.

“Today, I’m bringing you a magical product. Its name is jaded skin cream! It’s a skin care product with unimaginable effects. We have great confidence that the jaded skin cream will be a phenomenal skin care product!”

After speaking, Feng Jing pressed the PowerPoint on the remote control in her hand, and the words “Jade skin cream” appeared on the huge screen.

There was no unnecessary background or gaudy decorations. It was the most popular minimalistic style.

“Now, I’ll introduce our jaded skin cream to everyone.” Feng Rao pressed the button on the remote control and said,”first, it’s all – Natural!”

The words ‘all – Natural’ appeared on the screen. Feng Jing continued,””This is a product that our company’s research team has developed with full intellectual property after arduous research and development. The jaded skin cream is made of pure natural Chinese medicine without any chemical ingredients. I can guarantee this with the reputation of our company and accept the supervision of the society, media, and relevant institutions at any time!”

Feng Jing pressed a PowerPoint on the remote control, and a series of data appeared below the words “all – Natural” on the big screen. It listed the number of precious herbs and procedures of the Jade skin cream.

As Feng Jing spoke on stage, Xia ruofei kept a smile on his face. While he was paying attention to Feng Jing’s performance, he was also paying attention to the reactions of the CEOs around him, the media reporters, and the ordinary audience. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

In all fairness, the previous introduction didn’t attract much attention from the public – which cosmetic and skin care product wasn’t pure natural or Traditional Chinese Medicine from Xuancheng? This concept had been overused, but the real natural Chinese medicine product, the jaded skin ointment, could not stimulate everyone’s excitement.

However, this was also a necessary part. Even if it was overused, the introduction still had to be done.

Besides, Xia ruofei had confidence in Feng Jing. Although he had not seen the last PowerPoint, he believed that Feng Jing would not follow the old routine and hold a simple press conference.

Sure enough, after Feng Jing introduced a few key words in succession and the audience started to feel drowsy, she threw out the last key word.

The effect was heaven – defying!

When these words appeared on the big screen, the audience, the media, and the guest seats immediately buzzed with discussion.

Wasn’t this too exaggerated?

Feng Rao stood confidently in the middle of the stage and waited for the audience to quiet down a little before she smiled and said,””I’m sure a lot of people think that I’m exaggerating, but I want to tell you that compared to similar products, the definition of jaded skin cream we gave is not exaggerated at all! I’ll prove this to everyone through various means later!”

Feng Jing paused for a moment before she continued,””This time, our paradise Corporation is launching a new product, jaded skin cream. We are very fortunate to have invited the International Movie star, miss Daphne, to be the spokesperson for this product. Now, please enjoy a short video!”
