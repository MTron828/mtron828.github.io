1999 Urgent matter (3)

Xia ruofei had not even made a move, but he was already scared out of his wits.

Xia ruofei walked to Banjita’s side with a smile and said,””Don’t be afraid. I just want to ask you a few questions!”

Banjita shivered and asked in a trembling voice,”“Chinese kongfu?”

Xia ruofei laughed as he put his arm around Banjita’s shoulder and pulled him to the end of the alley. He then asked in English,””Do you know Toles?”

When Banjita heard the name, his expression changed and he asked,””You’re from the Gehrman family?”

The Gelman family had only been in Turin for a short time, but after the battle with the Moore family, they had gained a firm foothold in Turin. They had also integrated with many local gangs and became The Godfather of the Mafia in Turin.

Naturally, foreign forces such as the Nigeria and the southeast Asian gangs became the targets of the Gelman family.

Toles, as a vicious dog raised by the Gehrman family, naturally led the charge. His name had long been known by Banjita and the others.

Therefore, when Banjita heard Xia ruofei mention Toles ‘name, he subconsciously thought that Xia ruofei was a member of the Gehrman family. He felt even more hopeless and thought that he would definitely die tonight.

Xia ruofei flipped his hand and a shiny military dagger appeared in his hand. He used the blade of the dagger to Pat benjita’s face and said coldly,””I’m the one asking you questions now, not you. As long as you answer my questions honestly, I don’t want to repeat myself, understand?”he said.

Banjita nodded and said,””I understand ...”

“Very good!” Xia ruofei said,”now tell me about Toles! Tell me everything you know, including but not limited to his personality traits, hobbies, lifestyle habits, and the places he often goes to, etc. ”

When Banjita heard this, he felt that this Chinese man didn’t seem to be sent by the Gehrman family to clean up these small gangs. Instead, he sounded like Toles ‘enemy, and hope suddenly grew in his heart.

“Yes!” He quickly replied. Yes! Yes! Sir, Toles’s family, the Gehrman family, is also our enemy. The enemy of an enemy is a friend ...”

He was halfway through his sentence when Xia ruofei’s cold gaze swept over him. He immediately swallowed his words and began to tell her everything he knew with a smile.

Ten minutes later, Xia ruofei walked out of the dark alley.

The alley was silent. Banjita had been knocked unconscious by him with the hilt of his knife. The more than 20 people he had brought with him had also been kicked unconscious one by one. They would not wake up for a few hours.

These few hours were enough for him to kill Toles. Even if they woke up early or were discovered by others, he did not have to worry about them alerting Toles. Hence, Xia ruofei would not go so far as to kill them. Although they were despicable, they did not deserve to die.

After Xia ruofei left the house, he found a public toilet and changed his appearance and clothes. Even if Toles was killed, he would not have to worry about being identified. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

When they reached the street, Xia ruofei hailed a taxi and gave an address.

It was a villa in the rich area of Northern Turin. According to benjita, Toles would probably be there tonight.

The car sped through the city under the night sky. At this time, the sky began to drizzle, and the killing intent in the dark night began to spread ...
