Chapter 369: Chapter 347-can’t wait_1

Hearing this, Xia ruofei stopped in his tracks. He turned around and smiled.””Professor Tian, if there’s anything you need, please tell me.”

“Come on, let’s talk outside ...” Professor Tian thought for a while and said.

Then, professor Tian pulled Xia ruofei and walked out of the stadium.

Lu You and Jiang Yue looked at Xia ruofei’s departing figure. Suddenly, Lu You said something that made no sense,””Yueyue, indecisiveness only brings harm!”

Jiang Yue’s expression darkened. She lowered her head and said with reddened eyes,””I know ... But I just can’t help it ... My mind is filled with brother Xia’s figure. When I sleep at night and close my eyes, I see him in that dark alley, protecting me behind him and facing the back of the knife – wielding criminal alone ...”

Lu You sighed and gently put her arm around Jiang Yue’s shoulder.””Yueyue, don’t think about these annoying things. We won the Gold Award today, so we should be happy. Let’s go! Let’s go back to the booth, the visitors should be coming in soon!”

“En!” Jiang Yue raised her head and said,”brother Xia is amazing! He helped us win the gold medal in one move!”

Lu You couldn’t help but be speechless.

Fine, I wasted my breath ...

At the entrance of the stadium, Xia ruofei and professor Tian came to a relatively quiet place.

Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”professor Tian, what’s the matter?” Why are you so mysterious?”

“Weren’t there a lot of people just now?”asked professor Tian. Xiao Xia, Huixin gave me a call yesterday and asked me to ask when it’s convenient for you. She wants to bring a friend over to visit you ...”

Xia ruofei was stunned. Tian Huixin had brought a friend to visit him?

However, he quickly recalled that the last time he treated Huanhuan’s autism, Tian Huixin seemed to have asked him if the treatment medicine could be promoted. After getting a negative answer, she tactfully said that she had a very good friend whose child also had serious autism and hoped that Xia ruofei could help her.

At the thought of this, Xia ruofei also knew why professor Tian had gone outside to tell everyone about Wanwan’s treatment of children with autism. Xia ruofei did not want this to be made public. All this while, Ma Zhiming and his wife had been tight – lipped on his behalf. Naturally, professor Tian would not talk about this in the noisy Hall in front of the students of Sanshan University.

“Professor Tian, is it about the autistic child we talked about last time?” Xia ruofei asked.

Professor Tian nodded and said,”Huixin said that her friend’s child is about to reach the age to go to primary school. However, his condition has been very serious. He can’t go to an ordinary kindergarten. So, the whole family is very anxious ...”

“Of course,” professor Tian said.”If you have any difficulties, I’ll help you reject the offer.”

Xia ruofei smiled.”There’s no difficulty. I promised her back then ... But it’s not easy to arrange the time in the near future.”

He was considering that the employee’s apartment had not been built yet, and Li Zhifu was also staying in his villa for treatment. If Tian Huixin’s friend brought the child over, it would indeed be a little inconvenient.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””Professor Tian, if that child is going to go to primary school, it should be around September! There were still about five months left! I should be able to free up some space in one and a half months to two months, and then I’ll ask them to come over. ”

“No problem, I’ll give Huixin a call later,” professor Tian immediately replied.

Xia ruofei nodded.”Yes, you can tell them not to worry. There’s still time. It shouldn’t delay their children from attending primary school.”

“That’s great!”Professor Tian said happily. Thank you, Xia ...”

“You’re welcome,” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”professor Tian, if there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave.”

Professor Tian saw that Xia ruofei was indeed in a hurry to go back, so he did not ask him to stay. He smiled and nodded.

Xia ruofei waved goodbye to professor Tian and quickly walked out of the campus.

After collecting his car from the parking lot by the entrance of the farm, Xia ruofei drove the pickup truck towards Taoyuan farm.

……

Half an hour later, Xia ruofei was back at Taoyuan farm.

Everyone in the greenhouse and the construction site was busy.

Cao tieshu and the others had been doing farm work for most of their lives, so they did not have the concept of an afternoon nap. After lunch, they rested for a while and consciously returned to the farm to work.

These simple farmers always felt that since they had such a high salary, they had to do this hard – won job well. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

As for the construction site, even though Liang Qichao had gone abroad, Liang Weimin was still very grateful to Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei did not even need to ask for it. He urged manager li to arrange for the best workers to work in three shifts to shorten the construction period as much as possible while maintaining the quality.

Xia ruofei greeted Cao tieshu and continued to drive towards the villa.

On the way, he saw Lei Hu, Hong Tao, and a few others patrolling the farm with all their heart. The four of them were all wearing faded woodland camouflage and walking in an orderly line on the farm Road.

When they saw Xia ruofei’s car approaching from afar, Lei Hu and the other three stopped and saluted the car in unison.

Xia ruofei did not disturb them. He honked at them and continued to drive forward.

Back at the villa, Xia ruofei saw that ye Lingyun was still practicing his tea – making skills with li Zhifu in the courtyard using ordinary tree leaves.

Now that Lei Hu and the others were on duty, ye Lingyun had more time to learn how to make tea. Li Zhifu also felt that he did not have much time left, so his learning schedule was very tight.

Xia ruofei smiled and greeted ye Lingyun and Li Zhifu, then quickly walked into the villa.

On the way up the stairs, Xia ruofei thought for a while and stopped. He called out,””Little fatty!”

“AI!”

Hearing Xia ruofei’s voice, pang Hao walked out of the guest room that had been temporarily used as the Finance Office. He smiled and said,””RUO Fei is back? Have you eaten?”

“I’m not hungry yet. I’ll eat later. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”fatty, there’s something I need you to do. I see that Lei Hu and the others are still wearing the Army’s old camouflage uniform. Go and calculate their size today and buy them two black suits each. The company will pay for them as their work clothes. ”

“Alright! I’ll do it in the afternoon!” Pang Hao said with a grin.

He was not just an accountant for Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei had asked him to do a lot of the company’s coordination work, which was equivalent to a Butler.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”also, go and buy some regular security equipment like electric batons. Ask if you need to go to the Public Security Bureau to file it. Anyway, give them as many as you can.”

“Alright! I’ll understand the policy later and try to get it done as soon as possible. ” Pang Hao said.

“Then I’ll have to trouble you! I’ll go back to my room first. ” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

He strode up the stairs and locked the door and windows as soon as he entered his bedroom. Then, he couldn’t wait to take out the chain.
