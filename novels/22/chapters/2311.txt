2312 Half – Happy and half – sad (1)

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power circled song Qiming’s sea of consciousness and carefully examined it.

The result was both happy and sad.

The good thing was that song Qiming’s sea of consciousness showed signs of recovery after consuming the soup.

However, the speed of recovery was very slow. Although the medicinal properties of the soup had not been completely absorbed, Xia ruofei estimated that even if the medicinal properties of the soup were completely absorbed, the recovery of song Qiming’s sea of consciousness would only be about one percent at most.

Xia ruofei retracted his spiritual energy and his expression turned serious.

He was mentally prepared that the effects of the pregnancy soup were not obvious, but he did not expect it to be so bad.

At this rate, if he wanted song Qiming’s sea of consciousness to return to normal, he would need more than a hundred portions, even if he did not consider the fact that the effects of the pills would weaken if he took them repeatedly.

Most of the ingredients used to make the soup were not particularly precious. However, one of the ingredients was the spirit heart fruit. Although the amount used each time was not too much – only a small piece – Xia ruofei’s stored spirit heart fruit would probably be used up if he were to make hundreds of portions.

Of course, Xia ruofei did not care about the spirit heart fruit. As long as the spirit heart tree was there, the fruit would eventually bear. What he was troubled by was another more difficult problem.

One had to take the soup seven days after another. If he were to take more than 100 portions of the soup, the treatment period would be as long as 700 days. Of course, song Qiming could not wait for as long as two years. This was equivalent to ending his political life. Besides, Xia ruofei definitely did not want to drag things out for so long.

He had considered using the time array flag. Putting aside the trouble of disguising himself, just this matter itself was very troublesome. When song Qiming was in the array, he had to constantly replenish energy to keep him alive. Although the time array flag could shorten the treatment period, it also compressed the workload of taking care of the patient for two years into a few days.

Moreover, song Qiming was not breathing on his own and had lost consciousness. He could not leave the ICU at all. He was mainly kept alive by the nutrient infusion. There was no way to explain why the nutrient solution that he had consumed for two years was used up in a few days.

In other words, Xia ruofei could not afford to prescribe so many nutrient fluids.

Even if all these problems could be solved, Xia ruofei did not want to use this method. The time array flag changed the flow of time, but song Qiming, who was in the array, would have to experience two years. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Song Qiming was already an old man, and this was equivalent to stealing two years of his life.

This plan clearly had a huge flaw.

Xia ruofei sat at the head of the bed, frowning.

He could not figure out how song Qiming’s sea of consciousness was so badly damaged. He was only suffering from external injuries!

After much thought, Xia ruofei felt that the only possible answer was,”Song Qiming’s soul was in a state of extreme tension and despair when he was in a life – or – Death situation and had suffered a heavy blow to his head. A powerful energy burst forth from him and damaged his sea of consciousness from the inside out. At the same time, his soul had sealed itself.

Of course, this was just Xia ruofei’s guess.

There was no longer any meaning in trying to find out the cause of the damage to his knowledge sea. The most important thing now was to find another way and repair the damage as soon as possible.

Xia ruofei sighed. He had already made a decision.

He directly transmitted a message to Xia Qing,””Xia Qing, the effects of the spirit nourishment soup are very poor. It seems that we have to use the heart condensing grass. You should immediately start preparing for the transplantation.”

“Master, are we really going to transplant it?” The loyal Xia Qing couldn’t help but say,”the price of cultivating a stalk of heart – concentrating grass is too high. The spirit crystals consumed are enough to buy two or three stalks of heart – concentrating grass ...”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and said telepathically,””But we still need a place to buy it! Right now, the cultivators on earth are almost extinct, and those spiritual herbs and medicines can’t grow in an environment ...”

Then, Xia ruofei said,”Xia Qing, it’s more important to save the people. Don’t worry about the spiritual crystals for now. Cultivate the heart – concentrating grass immediately!”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing no longer hesitated and said directly,”I’ve already made some preparations after you instructed me last time. Now, I only need to transplant the heart condensing grass here.” However, you’ll need to activate the formation and set up the time formation flags. ”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei said. I’ll find a safe place and set it up in the space as soon as possible!”

“Yes, master!”

……

Xia ruofei left the intensive care unit with a trace of disappointment.

Fang Liyun and Song Wei were waiting outside anxiously. Ling Qingxue was holding onto Song Wei’s hand and waiting with them.

Seeing Xia ruofei come out, Song Wei asked impatiently,””RUO Fei, how is it?”

When Xia ruofei came out, he had already collected himself. Even if he was disappointed, he would not show it in front of Fang Liyun and Song Wei. He knew very well that if he showed any signs of being in a difficult position, Fang Liyun and Song Wei would definitely be frightened. They were afraid that song Qiming’s condition would worsen or that he would never wake up again.

Xia ruofei had a relaxed smile on his face as he said,””I’ve already thought of a way to feed him the medicine, but it takes more than a day for him to be frozen. Uncle song is so hurt that it won’t be easy for him to wake up in such a short time.”

Fang Liyun nodded and said,”we’re not in a hurry, ruofei.” It was fine as long as Qiming’s life was not in danger and the overall situation was developing in a good direction. Ruofei, don’t be too stressed ...”
