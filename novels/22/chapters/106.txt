Chapter 107: Liu Hang in a sorry state (1)

Although Yuan Lili and the others didn’t know the identity of President Zheng, they could tell that he was an extraordinary man at first glance, so they all stopped their entertainment and even stopped singing. President Zheng looked at Xia ruofei and said with a smile,””Brother Xia, this plum blossom Hall is too simple and crude. I’ve already had people prepare the Honorable Hall. Would you and your friend please move there?” Xia ruofei stood up with a bitter smile on his face and said,””President Zheng, I’m here today to eat and drink with my classmates, you don’t have to be so polite ... Actually, this private room is quite good.” Then, Xia ruofei introduced her to Yuan Lili and the others,””Students, this is boss Zheng from the West River Moon Club. President Zheng, these are my middle school classmates. Today ... Can be considered our tenth graduation anniversary gathering!” “Hello, everyone!” President Zheng said with a smile, then he gestured to the lobby manager. The lobby manager immediately handed over a wine glass. It was a small red wine glass, about three taels in capacity, and filled with white wine. “Everyone here is brother Xia’s friend, so you’re my friend as well.” President Zheng raised his glass and said. Today, you’ve come to my West River Moon Club. It’s our fault for not being able to host you well. This glass of wine is for everyone, as an apology! You guys do as you please, I’ll do it!” After saying that, President Zheng raised his head and drank the entire glass of white wine. Then, without changing his expression, he showed the bottom of the glass to everyone. When Xia ruofei’s classmates heard that the fat man in front of them was the boss of the top – Class club that Liu Hang had praised to the heavens, and that President Zheng actually attached so much importance to Xia ruofei and toasted everyone with a big glass of white wine the moment he arrived, they all stood up and drank. Only Liu Hang’s reaction was half a beat slower. His face was red and white, and his brain was still in a state of shock. It was as if he had lost his ability to think. He just raised his glass and drank with his classmates mechanically. President Zheng did not notice Liu Hang. In fact, all his politeness and thoughtfulness were directed at Xia ruofei. All his attention was naturally on Xia ruofei. “Brother Xia,” President Zheng asked with a smile,”I asked little Meng to send you a bottle of wine just now. Are you satisfied with it?” The private room suddenly became very quiet, and Liu Hang’s face was even redder. He wanted to find a hole in the ground and hide in it. It was so embarrassing. He had no idea how to face his classmates who were just flattering him. Xia ruofei was not surprised at all. He smiled and said,””It’s a very good red wine. President Zheng, you’re very thoughtful.” “It’s good that brother Xia likes it!” President Zheng laughed and then asked,”you really don’t need to change to another private room?” “There’s really no need for that. Plum blossom Hall is fine. Thank you, President Zheng!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “Alright!” President Zheng didn’t force her and just said straightforwardly,”all the expenses for tonight are free. Everyone, eat and drink to your heart’s content. I won’t disturb your class reunion!” “Thank you, President Zheng.” Xia ruofei said with a smile. President Zheng gave everyone another toast and then politely took his leave. After he left, the atmosphere in the private room became a little strange. Everyone still heard Liu Hang’s bragging and young master Li, who was said to be extremely awesome. Now that the truth was out, Liu Hang’s previous showing off had undoubtedly become a big joke. Liu Hang’s face was the ugliest. He lowered his head for a long time before forcing a smile and saying,””I ... I’m not feeling well, so I’ll go back first. Everyone, take your time ...” After he finished speaking, he left the room as if he was escaping. He did not dare to look at Xia ruofei again. Compared to Liu Hang’s sorry state, Xia ruofei was much calmer. Whether it was when Liu Hang was bragging before or now, he always had a calm expression. After Liu Hang left, the awkward atmosphere in the room was swept away, and everyone became lively. Xia ruofei had successfully stolen the spotlight again and became the focus of the crowd. Even Yuan Lili, who was supposed to be the main character, was very curious. “RUO Fei, tell me the truth. What do you do?” Yuan Lili said with a smile. The students also joined in. “Yup! Even the boss of the West River Moon Club is so polite to you, and you still say you’re a vegetable farmer?” “You’re even hiding it from your old classmate, that’s not very nice ...” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and said,”everyone, everyone ... I’m not lying to you. I’m just a vegetable farmer! I’m not lying!” The only reason I know President Zheng and President Ling is because they bought my vegetables!” “Is it really that simple?” “It’s that simple! “I swear ...” Xia ruofei said. “Since when did vegetable suppliers become so awesome? What kind of vegetables are you selling?” Guan Ping laughed as he said this. He then asked suspiciously,”it ... It can’t be that peach blossom vegetables, right?” Xia ruofei smiled noncommittally. “No way!” Pang Hao exclaimed. Was it really Taoyuan vegetables? RUO Fei, you’re really awesome! It hasn’t been long since he returned from the military! And you’ve already created such a heaven – defying product!” The students were also amazed. They had just tasted paradise vegetables and knew how popular it was in Rong city. They didn’t expect the supplier of paradise vegetables to be among them, and it was even the most inconspicuous – looking Xia ruofei. Naturally, many people came to Xia ruofei for a drink. Even though he was a good drinker, he had to leave the private room by using the excuse of peeing. In fact, drinking was not the most important thing. He was not used to the compliments. Xia ruofei could not understand why Liu Hang was so keen on being in the limelight. Actually, there was a bathroom in the private room, but Xia ruofei still went outside. Not long after Xia ruofei left, pang Hao also stood up and left the private room. Yingying had drunk too much tonight, so he wanted to go out for some fresh air. Walking out of the private room, the wind from the central air – Conditioner in the corridor made pang Hao feel a little dizzy. He looked up at the sign and walked to the bathroom with heavy steps. As he passed by the door of a private room, pang Hao felt his head spinning. He stood still and leaned against the wall, wanting to catch his breath. At this moment, the door of the private room was opened as a 25 – year old man walked out with his arm around the slim waist of a gorgeously dressed woman. The woman was holding a wine glass in her hand and was feeding the man wine with a coquettish smile. The two of them didn’t look at where they were going and bumped into pang Hao. Caught off guard, pang Hao’s entire body fell to the floor. Although the corridor was also covered with a thick carpet, pang Hao was also in a sorry state after the fall. Although the man and woman did not fall, they were also frightened. The woman poured the glass of red wine in her hand onto the man’s expensive suit. The red wine on his white suit was particularly eye – catching. The woman shrieked in fear, while the man’s expression was even more unsightly. He strode over to pang Hao, who was still in a daze from the fall, and cursed,” “Don’t you have eyes when you walk? Don’t you know that a good dog doesn’t block the way?”FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m
