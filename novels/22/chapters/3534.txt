Translator: 549690339

Most of elder song’s children worked in other places, and song Rui was the eldest grandson. Although he feared elder song like a tiger, he would occasionally come to visit the old master. His other younger brothers and sisters were even more respectful of elder song than song Rui. Even if they came with their elders, they were still trembling with fear and rarely came to the old residence.

Today, elder song asked song Zhilan to come home for dinner at the last minute, so naturally, no other younger generation came to attend.

Initially, Xia ruofei wanted manager Lu to sit down and eat, but manager Lu kept rejecting him, saying that he was here to ensure the Bureau chief’s service. How could he eat together with him?

Elder song laughed,”ruofei, just leave Xiao Lu to herself!” He’s gotten used to it after so many years.”

In fact, manager Lu’s rank wasn’t low. He could be the top or second – in – command in a lower province. However, in front of elder song, he had always been humble as a staff member. Elder song was used to this kind of interaction and never forced manager Lu to do things that he wasn’t used to.

As a result, there were only the four of them at the dinner tonight.

Elder song was in a very good mood. He personally picked up the bottle and poured wine. Xia ruofei and song Zhilan were naturally more relaxed. Only song Rui seemed very nervous. He was already afraid of elder song, and now that Xia ruofei had said that he would help him mention Zhuo Yiyi’s matter, he was even more nervous.

After everyone poured the wine, elder song held the glass and smiled.”Ruofei, I’m very happy that you came to visit me today! Now that I’m older, I’m especially afraid of being lonely, but the children are all very busy…”

Elder song’s words made both song Zhilan and song Rui feel a little embarrassed. Song Zhilan quickly said,”Dad! It’s our fault… We’re usually so busy that we can’t come over to accompany you often …”

“It’s a good thing that you have your own careers,”said elder song while waving his hand. I’m getting on in years, the song family will still need you guys to support it in the future!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Grandpa song, you’re still strong!” You’re the star of the song family, the backbone of the younger generation!”

Eccentric song laughed and said,”let’s not talk about this. I’ve been in good health for the past two years. It’s all thanks to you, ruofei.” Come! Let’s have a drink first!”

“Cheers!”

Everyone clinked their glasses, and then, including elder song, drank the wine in their glasses.

Of course, they used the smallest thumb cup, which was about one coin per cup.

Elder song picked up his chopsticks and said,”come, come, come!” Ruofei, try the cooking of my chef! Let’s eat!”

Everyone chatted as they ate dinner. The atmosphere was harmonious, but song Rui seemed to have a lot on his mind. He was mainly worried about his personal gains and losses. He didn’t know how Xia ruofei would speak up for him or what the outcome would be.

After elder song took a bite of the vegetable, he smiled and said,””RUO Fei, the Jade Guanyin you gave me last time was really good! In the past, I always felt that the atmosphere in This Old House wasn’t very good, but ever since we had the Jade Guanyin, it’s very comfortable to stay at home. It’s a pleasure that comes from the inside out!”

Elder song paused for a moment. He couldn’t help but point at song Zhilan and said with a smile,””1 remember that Zhilan even said that this was a feudal superstition!”

Song Zhilan said with some embarrassment,””Dad! Didn’t I already admit my mistake? Why are you still holding on to it?”

The Jade Guanyin that Xia ruofei gave elder song was a gift for elder song’s birthday. At that time, the song family’s younger generation and some close guests were present.

Xia ruofei asked elder song to drop a drop of blood on the Jade Guanyin to recognize her as his master. Song Zhilan even reprimanded him for being superstitious.

In the end, after the blood contract, the effect was immediate. At that time, song Zhilan was convinced.

Elder song laughed out loud and said,”Zhilan, this really isn’t a psychological effect. Even the staff in the house felt it very clearly. Moreover, this is a subtle and continuous effect. Not to mention other things, even the headaches and fevers of those staff have decreased a lot!”

Elder song couldn’t help but give Xia ruofei a thumbs up.”RUO Fei, your Jade Guanyin is really very good! So … Sometimes, we shouldn’t rush to conclusions, and we shouldn’t arbitrarily classify things outside of our own cognition as pseudoscience, feudal superstition, and so on!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Dad!” Song Zhilan said. You’ve already criticized me, so I’ve accepted it with an open mind! I’ve even hired a Feng Shui Master to adjust the layout of my office!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. So song Zhilan had attributed the remarkable effect of the Jade Guanyin to Feng Shui.

However, he wouldn’t expose her. With song Zhilan’s level, the Feng Shui Master she hired should have some real skills. It couldn’t be those kind of pure charlatans. Also, the theory of Feng Shui wasn’t completely feudal and superstitious. It wouldn’t be bad to let a real expert Feng Shui Master inspect and adjust the layout of the office.

After they chatted for a while, Xia ruofei brought the topic to song Rui. He remembered that his main mission was to help song Rui persuade the others. Elder song laughed out loud and said,”Zhilan, this really isn’t a psychological effect. Even the staff in the house felt it very clearly. Moreover, this is a subtle and continuous effect. Not to mention other things, even the headaches and fevers of those staff have decreased a lot!”
