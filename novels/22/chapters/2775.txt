2776 Reactions of all parties (2)

Zhao Zhenghao’s forehead started to sweat after hearing this.

Zhao Zhenghao expressed his attitude with sincerity and determination. Liu QUN FENG knew that Zhao Zhenghao wouldn’t dare to disobey him, so he gave him a few words of encouragement and hung up.

Zhao Zhenghao sat on his soft office chair and didn’t come back to his senses for a long time.

He did not expect Xia ruofei to have such a powerful background. Not only did the higher – ups from the headquarters greet him, but even the old master of the Liu family had personally expressed his attitude.

Zhao Zhenghao was also secretly glad. He had always been kind to Xia ruofei. In fact, the Chinese Football Association’s timely response to the public opinion was in line with the fans ‘expectations because of Zhao Zhenghao’s personal instructions.

Zhao Zhenghao was young and strong, and it was time for him to have a career. He had never been stingy with resources for talents in the football field. After understanding the public opinion on the internet, he immediately got someone to find the video of Xia ruofei’s substitute performance.

This was the only video of the competition that Xia ruofei had kept so far.

Moreover, Zhao Zhenghao asked for the original video, not the edited album of the star players.

Hence, the video not only showed Xia ruofei’s wonderful performance, but also a panoramic view.

Zhao Zhenghao was not only concerned about Xia ruofei’s highlights. In comparison, he was more concerned about Xia ruofei’s movements, backcatches, passes, and so on.

He was keenly aware that if Xia ruofei did not perform beyond his level in that game, then Xia ruofei was undoubtedly one of the most talented players in Chinese football in many years. If Xia ruofei could play for the country, there was no doubt that the combat power of the entire national football team would be greatly improved.

Therefore, he immediately instructed the person – in – charge of the new media account to respond to the netizens ‘reactions.

At first, Zhao Zhenghao only made this decision because he valued talents and hoped to inject new positive energy into the national football team. However, it was different now. Nothing had changed, but Xia ruofei’s position in his heart had suddenly become high and mysterious.

Zhao Zhenghao immediately gathered all the relevant personnel of the national men’s soccer team for a meeting to study it.

……

Naturally, Xia ruofei did not know that so many things had happened in the distant capital. After he packed his things, he bade farewell to Ling Qingxue and drove away from the villa in his Knight XV off – Road vehicle.

He wanted to use the night to visit Song Wei’s father, song Qiming.

Song Qiming had been practicing the Sutra of humility for some time. Although he did not know that it was cultivation and only thought that it was a way to strengthen the body and Qi in conjunction with treatment, he still insisted on following Xia ruofei’s “advice” and practiced the Sutra every day out of absolute trust in Xia ruofei.

Song Qiming was a little older and had no cultivation experience. Most importantly, he did not even know that he was cultivating. Hence, Xia ruofei was more or less worried. Since he had returned to the three mountains, he naturally had to find time to visit him.

As they had made an appointment on the phone in advance, when they entered, the armed police at the door only checked the license plate and Xia ruofei’s identity before letting him through.

It was not Xia ruofei’s first time visiting. He drove the Knight XV to song Qiming’s Villa with ease.

After parking the car, Xia ruofei took out a box of Dahongpao tea leaves from the medium and walked into the courtyard.

After all, it was impolite to visit him empty – handed, so it was only right to give him a box of tea as a gift.

Xia ruofei rang the doorbell, and someone came to open the door.

To Xia ruofei’s surprise, song Qiming opened the door personally.

“Uncle song!” After Xia ruofei returned to her senses, she quickly greeted song Qiming.

“RUO Fei, quickly come in!” Song Qiming chuckled as he stepped aside.

Xia ruofei was relieved to see that song Qiming was in good health. His face was ruddy and his voice was full of energy.

Song Wei’s mother, Fang Liyun, also came out to greet her. She said with a reproachful look,”Ruofei, why aren’t you here for dinner? Are you treating us as outsiders?”

Xia ruofei quickly explained,”aunty Fang, I really have something else to do. Furthermore, I have to fly to the capital tomorrow. That’s why I used the night to come and visit you guys. I also wanted to check on uncle song.”

“Liyun, young people have their own lives!” Song Qiming laughed. RUO Fei is leaving tomorrow, don’t you want to have dinner with your girlfriend tonight?”

“That’s true ...” Fang Liyun said with a smile.

Xia ruofei could not help but feel a little embarrassed. He was thinking of Song Wei. He did not dare to imagine what their expressions would be like if they knew about his relationship with Song Wei. If they knew about the complicated relationship between Xia ruofei, Song Wei, and Ling Qingxue, who knew what their reaction would be ...

“Come, come, come, let’s go make some tea!” Song Qiming said.

Fang Liyun also said,”ruofei, you guys continue!” We’ve just finished dinner and haven’t cleaned up the kitchen yet!”

“Quickly go! I will take care of RUO Fei!” Song Qiming said.

Then, he laughed and explained to Xia ruofei,””The domestic service staff is on leave today. We can only do it ourselves.”

Xia ruofei and song Qiming walked to the coffee table in the living room and sat down. Song Qiming opened the kettle to get some water and said,””Ruofei, I’ve seen the video you posted this afternoon. You did well. Young people should have such vigor and responsibility!”

“You’re overpraising me. This is also a hobby of mine. I also love to play football. ” Xia ruofei smiled and continued to ask,”uncle song, how have you been feeling?”

Song Qiming immediately said,”ruofei, the Qi cultivation method you taught me is amazing!” I only practice for about an hour a day, but now I’m not only full of energy, but also seem to have a lot more strength. What’s even more incredible is that my white hair has actually decreased a lot. This was discovered by the barber when I went to dye my hair a few days ago!”

As a leader, song Qiming often attended Foreign Affairs and appeared on the local news almost every day. Therefore, he had to pay attention to his image. He had started dyeing his hair a few years ago. Of course, he dyed it black.

After he came to San Shan to work, he had been dying his hair in the municipal Party committee’s Barber shop, so the barber was naturally very familiar with his hair.

As he usually dyed his hair, song Qiming did not notice the change in his hair. He would not look at his roots in the mirror for no reason. So it was the barber who first noticed the change in his white hair.

Song Qiming could already feel the earth – shaking changes in his body. His hair had even turned black. He was even more shocked. It was not easy for him to meet Xia ruofei again. He had long wanted to ask about the Qi cultivation method.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”uncle song, this is a good thing!” It means that you’ve regained your youth!”

Xia ruofei seemed to be joking, but he was actually speaking the truth. As long as song Qiming was successful in his cultivation, not only would his hair turn black, but his appearance would also become younger and his lifespan would increase. In a sense, he could be considered to have regained his youth.

“The effect is a little too good!” Song Qiming smiled bitterly and said,”I’m feeling a little scared ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”uncle song, this is normal. You don’t have to be nervous!” I’m here today to check on the effects of your health – Maintenance technique. If there’s really a problem, I can easily detect it!”

Xia ruofei paused and continued,””Uncle song, please follow your usual practice method and demonstrate how you practice!”Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com
