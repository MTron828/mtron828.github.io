2788 Chapter 1521 – Army set off for norkanp.1

Although this away game was a Derby in the same city and did not require a long expedition, the entire Spanish team still checked in to the hotel a day in advance. The purpose was naturally to prevent the players from being disturbed and distracted.

Of course, Xia ruofei was already staying in the hotel. With his special status, he did not have to go through the trouble of staying in another hotel with the team.

The match started at Seveno’ clock in the evening. Xia ruofei participated in the team’s joint training in the morning and went to the hotel where the team was staying in the afternoon. He took the team bus to the famous nokapu Stadium.

There was still a long time before kick – off, but along the way, there were already many bar?a fans dressed in red and blue home team uniforms gathered together. The closer they were to nokapu Stadium, the more fans there were on the side of the road.

When they saw the Spanish team’s bus driving over, the bar?a fans booed, and some people even spread out banners full of sarcastic words toward the team bus.

More and more fans gathered on the side of the road. The police cars sent by the Barcelona police also sounded their sirens and cleared the way for the bus in front.

The Barcelona police were very nervous every time the Catalan derby was held. Although La Liga did not have as many football hooligans as the English Premier League, the atmosphere in the Derby was very tense, both on and off the field.

Xia ruofei and Wu Lei were sitting in the same row. He turned to look at Wu Lei, whose face was tense. He smiled and pointed at the bar?a fans outside the car window.”Lei Zi, are you nervous?”

Wu Lei forced a smile and said,”it’s alright.” Just a little bit ...”

“If you’re nervous now,” Xia ruofei laughed,”won’t your legs be soft when you step on nokapu’s turf?”

“I won ‘t!” Wu Lei said,”as long as the whistle is blown, I will have no more distracting thoughts!”

“Hahaha! Then I’ll see how you perform!” Xia ruofei said,”remember, after the kick – off at night, no matter how the head coach arranges the tactics, you must firmly move forward in the first few minutes. I will pass the ball to you as long as there is a chance!”

Although it had not been announced to the public yet, Ruby had already announced the starting lineup after the last pre – competition training. Xia ruofei and Wu Lei were both in the starting lineup.

In fact, Wu Lei was getting more and more game time during this period. He often appeared in the starting lineup. Even if he played a few games as a substitute, he could be replaced after about 60 minutes. His game time was relatively stable, so it was not surprising that he got a starting opportunity this time.

Moreover, when Spain faced barcaía, they were already charging at the opponent with a weak attitude. In the case of a relatively stable defensive lineup, putting Wu Lei, who was better in speed and running, in the front field was also suitable for defensive counterattack tactics.

As for Xia ruofei, even though he had only represented the team in half of the match, that half of the match was a highlight of the team. Furthermore, Xia ruofei’s performance in the past few days of training was too good. He was even better than the other players. Moreover, he was the team’s owner. Ruby would definitely place him as a substitute.

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Wu Lei nodded his head firmly and said,””I’ll remember that!”

Wu Lei listened to Xia ruofei’s every word. Since Xia ruofei had given him an order, he would follow it without hesitation, even if it was against the head coach’s instructions.

After the two of them chatted for a while, Xia ruofei lowered his head and started to play on his phone.

Suddenly, he saw an interesting screenshot on Weibo. He couldn’t help but click on it to take a look, and then he couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

Wu Lei turned around and asked,””Brother Xia, what are you laughing at?”

“See for yourself!” Xia ruofei smiled as he showed the screen of his phone to Wu Lei.

Wu Lei took a glance and could not help but smile bitterly.””D * MN ... I’ve already deleted this post. I didn’t expect someone to take a screenshot and dig up a grave at this time ...”

It turned out that the picture posted on this Weibo was a Weibo post by Wu Lei in 2013. At that time, Wu Lei was still a player of the Shengang team in the China League. In January of 2013, the Shengang team visited nokapu Stadium.

After the visit, Wu Lei wrote on Weibo,””This is the sanctuary of football, the dream of every player! It was only here that one could truly feel the charm of the stadium! Enjoy all this! This is real football! Bar?a! Bar?a! Basa!”

There were also photos of him visiting nokapu.

After Wu Lei joined RCD Espanyol, he was well aware of the feud between them, so he deleted the Weibo post. He did not expect that some fans would take a screenshot.

This netizen with the Weibo ID “a ‘Dai of sacun” wrote: “Six years ago, Wu Lei dreamed of stepping into nokapu. Tonight, his dream might come true!”

The comments from the fans below were also very happy.

“So, Wu Lei is going on a pilgrimage?”

“Ball King Wu, your dream has come true! You must seize the opportunity!”

“Don’t be afraid! The opponent was bar?a! We’ll be done!”

Xia ruofei laughed out loud as he browsed through the comments. Even Naldo and the old goalkeeper, Diego Lopez, who were sitting in the front row could not help but stand up and ask.

Xia ruofei smiled and showed them the picture on his phone. He also translated Wu Lei’s words into Spanish for his teammates to hear.
