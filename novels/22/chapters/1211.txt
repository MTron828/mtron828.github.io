Chapter 1212: The one who gave you a chance (2)

Translator: 549690339

“Alright!” Liu Zhe said.

“You ... Who did you call?” chief Li’s face changed greatly. You called the police?”

“Just stay here obediently!” Xia ruofei said,”you’ll know who I’ve called.”

With that, Xia ruofei gestured to Feng Rao to sit down and rest.

After a while, Xia ruofei, who had sharp hearing, heard footsteps coming from the corridor.

The footsteps stopped at the door, and then there was a knock.

Xia ruofei stood up and walked over to open the door.

Liu Zhe was standing at the door, and there were three people with cold expressions standing beside him.

“Brother Xia, as you ordered, I’ve brought the person!” Liu Zhe said enthusiastically,”let me introduce you. This is the provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection ...”

“Let’s talk inside!”Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Alright, alright!” Liu Zhe quickly said.

Xia ruofei smiled and gestured for her to leave. Then, he turned around and walked back to his room.

Liu Zhe and the others walked in and saw Section Chief li sitting on the ground in a sorry state, with broken glass all over the floor near the balcony.

“Brother Xia, what’s going on?” Liu Zhe could not help but ask.

Before Xia ruofei could say anything, Section Chief Li’s heart had already sunk to the bottom.

Liu Zhe only felt that Section Chief li looked familiar, but Section Chief li was extremely familiar with Liu Zhe. He was the son of the second – in – command in the unit!

What made Section Chief li shiver even more was that the three people he brought were all from the provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection, and the older one was a Deputy Director. These people were famous for being impartial in the unit, and many people who violated the rules and regulations had fallen at their hands.

Section Chief li realized that he might not be able to escape tonight, and he was afraid that he would not be able to keep his public office.

As expected, before Xia ruofei could explain the situation, Deputy Director Xu, who was leading the group, frowned and asked,”Li Chenggong? What are you doing here?”

“Deputy Director Xu, you know him?” Liu Zhe asked curiously.

“He’s a Section Chief in the property rights management Office!”Vice Director Xu said.

Xia ruofei said,”let me say it!” Please take a seat!”

After everyone sat down, no one paid any attention to the dazed Section Chief li. They all focused their attention on Xia ruofei.

“You guys should know that the provincial power electricity Corporation is going to sell their business in Hengli building, right?” Xia ruofei said calmly.

Liu Zhe continued,”I know!” This matter was handled by the provincial state – owned assets Control Commission! It should be ... The property rights management Department, right?”

Liu Zhe had some understanding of his father’s work, but he wasn’t very confident. He looked at Deputy Director Xu.

Deputy Director Xu slightly nodded and said,””Yes. As far as I know, li Chenggong’s Department is in charge of the specific work. So, tonight’s incident is related to the sale of assets in Hengli building?”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”our company is very interested in this building. More than a week ago, we started to prepare for the acquisition. We also contacted the relevant departments of the state – owned assets Control Commission at once. The contact person is chief li!”

Xia ruofei paused and continued,””But what surprised us was that the normal routine procedure couldn’t be carried out when it came to Section Chief li. So far, we can’t even submit the price.”

“Our company’s general manager, Feng Jing, was in charge of this matter at first.” Xia ruofei pointed at Feng Rao and said,”I felt that there was no progress after that, so I asked about it. The result made me very angry! It’s all because of this Section Chief Lee, who created obstacles for us one after another!”

After Deputy Director Xu heard this, he already understood.

This was how things were done in the system. It was inevitable to shirk responsibility and wrangle. Moreover, he was already the Deputy Director, so he knew all too well what kind of high – sounding excuses chief li would use to avoid it. He knew that as long as chief li didn’t relent, the company would be beaten back even if it submitted a hundred times.

However, Deputy Director Xu thought that Xia ruofei had come to kill him in a fit of anger and had even hit him. Director li was covered in dust and his arm was obviously injured. He could not help but frown.

Deputy Director Xu was an experienced discipline inspector, and he knew how to be flexible. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have agreed to Liu Zhe’s request without even knowing the reason. However, he also couldn’t stand the arrogant and domineering nouveau riche who relied on his family’s power.

In Deputy Director Xu’s eyes, Xia ruofei was already such a spoiled brat.

He frowned slightly and said,”Mr. Xia, even if Section Chief li is in the wrong, you should’ve reported it through the normal procedures.” If you can’t find chief Li, you can find his chief, or even the committee leader!”

Liu Zhe quickly said,”Deputy Director Xu, let brother Xia finish first!” Brother Xia, there must be a reason why you attacked me tonight, right?”

Xia ruofei looked at Deputy Director Xu and said with a faint smile,””Deputy Director Xu, if it was just to create some difficulties for us, I wouldn’t have lost my cool. What really made me angry was that this Section Chief li openly asked us for a million Yuan as a reward, and even had bad ideas about our female employees ...”

Even though Xia ruofei did not explicitly say that it was Feng Jing, Feng Jing was so pretty and was quite famous on the internet. She was with Xia ruofei tonight, so Deputy Director Xu and the others naturally turned their attention to Feng Jing. This made Feng Jing’s pretty face heat up.

Deputy Director Xu said with a serious expression,””Mr. Xia, you have to take responsibility for what you say! Do you have any evidence?”

Xia ruofei glanced at Section Chief li, who was now like a pile of mud, and said,””Before tonight, we really didn’t have any evidence. This Section Chief li is very cautious! But now ... We have enough evidence!”

Deputy Director Xu saw Xia ruofei’s confident look and couldn’t help but ask,””Are you sure?”

Xia ruofei smiled and did not say anything else. He took out a recording pen and pressed the button to start playing.

The voice recorder was very good. Although it was in the bag, the sound was very clear. It was obviously Feng Jing and Section Chief Li’s voices.

The recording kept playing. In the recording, Section Chief Li’s triumphant tone formed a sharp contrast with his current sorry state, which was like a dead dog.

Deputy Director Xu’s face became uglier and uglier as he listened. When he heard that chief li wanted Feng Jing to accompany him for a night, he couldn’t help but slam the back of his chair and stand up. He glared at chief li and said,”You scum! You’ve completely lost the face of the state – owned assets Control Commission!”

Section Chief li lowered his head, his heart full of despair.

He still couldn’t figure out why the boss of this paradise Corporation had such a strong background. Even Deputy Director Liu’s son was so familiar with him. How could he have applied for an acquisition through the normal procedures? ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

If he had known about Xia ruofei and Liu Zhe’s relationship, he would not have dared to treat Feng Jing like that!

Now, Section Chief li really wanted to cry but had no tears. His intestines were almost green with regret.

In fact, it was normal for Xia ruofei to ask Feng Jing to carry out the acquisition plan through formal channels. Unfortunately, in the eyes of the few “rat sh * ts” like Section Chief li, the normal things became abnormal. It was ironic.

“Mr. Xia,” Deputy Director Xu said sincerely,”I’m really sorry that such a scum appeared in the SASAC. At the same time, we also want to thank you for helping us find such a parasite!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Deputy Director Xu, you’re too kind. There are black sheep everywhere. This has nothing to do with the management of the unit.”

“Thank you for your understanding!” Deputy Director Xu quickly said,”Mr. Xia, I will report this to the leader of the discipline Inspection team immediately. With his situation, the two rules are certain. We may need your company to provide more specific information to assist us in investigating this case!”
