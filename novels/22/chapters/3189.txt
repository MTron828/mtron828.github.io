“Mathematics?” Xia ruofei was a little surprised. He couldn’t help but ask,”could it be a chicken and rabbit in the same cage?”

He knew that the standard of mathematics in ancient China was not very high. Of course, the development of mathematics around the world was still in its early stages. Including “nine chapters of arithmetic”, it only appeared in the Western Han Dynasty, and the time of Yuntai and the others should be the Qin Dynasty.

Layman Yuntai was also stunned and asked,””What do you mean by chicken and rabbit in the same cage?”

Xia ruofei thought about it. The problem of the chicken and rabbit in the same cage should have been first recorded in the sun Zi computational Canon, which appeared about 1500 years ago, far later than the era of Yuntai scholar, so it was normal that he did not know the classic problem of the chicken and rabbit in the same cage.

Hence, Xia ruofei said,”I’m just giving you an example. The problem is like this. Today, there are pheasant rabbits in the same cage. There are thirty – five of them on the top and ninety – four legs on the bottom.”

Xia ruofei explained the problem of the chickens and rabbits in the same cage, then asked with a smile,””Is this the mathematics problem that venerable yang Shan is studying?”

Scholar Yuntai laughed and said,”it’s such a simple question. How can it be called mathematics?” Venerable yang Shan’s knowledge covers a wide range, and his mathematics is also extensive and profound, including the hook probing method, Tianyuan technique, great evolution seeking technique, mistake technique, stacking technique, and so on ...”

Xia ruofei was dumbfounded. He couldn’t help but use the search engine on the computer to search for the sophisticated mathematical methods mentioned by Yuntai scholar. Then, he couldn’t help but be amazed.

What scholar Yuntai said, if translated into the language of modern mathematics, would be Pythagorean Theorem, high – order equations, one – time cohomology arrays, high – order inversion methods, high – order differential equations ...

Even though the content wasn’t particularly profound in modern mathematics, in the context of the Qin Dynasty, it was simply the work of the gods.

In Xia ruofei’s memory, these contents had only appeared in the song and Yuan Dynasty. Yet, a senior cultivator who lived in the Qin Dynasty had already studied these contents so deeply.

It must be known that the development of a theory was not just a flash of inspiration from a genius. It must be the joint contribution of countless talented people to promote the development of a theory.

However, this venerable yang Shan lived in the Qin Dynasty, or even earlier, so he naturally did not have any reference materials when facing these complex mathematical problems. Basically, it was certain that he had researched it alone.

Xia ruofei stopped looking down on the ancient people’s Mathematics Level and asked humbly,”Senior Yuntai, does this venerable Yangshan have any specific opinions on how to crack the rising Dragon Order?”

Scholar Yuntai said,”senior Yangshan has also studied the rising Dragon in a short period of time. It was probably only one or two years!” He concluded that the secret of the rising Dragon Token lies in these floating point patterns, and the cracking of these floating point patterns involves the content of mathematics. ”

Xia ruofei asked curiously,”since venerable yang Shan has already concluded that we need to use mathematical methods to solve the secret of the floating point pattern, and he’s an expert in mathematics, why didn’t he continue?” Could it be that he’s not interested in the rising Dragon?”

“No!” Replied layman Yuntai. “Venerable yang Shan said publicly that even if his mathematical attainments were ten times more profound, it would still be difficult for him to crack the secret of the rising Dragon Order. This is because there is a limit to human strength, and the complexity of the floating point pattern is beyond the scope of human strength. Therefore, he wisely chose to give up, so as not to waste a lot of time and energy and end up empty – handed!”

An idea flashed in Xia ruofei’s mind. He almost immediately guessed the situation at that time. The venerable of yang Shan’s mathematics attainment was indeed beyond that era. He might have already calculated that the calculation required to completely crack the secret of the floating point pattern was terrifying, so he gave up.

After all, even if venerable yang Shan’s knowledge was beyond that era, and his spiritual power cultivation might have reached a terrifying level that Xia ruofei could not understand, in terms of computing power, he could not be compared to a supercomputer.

Perhaps, venerable yang Shan could not see any hope of breaking it, and so he gave up decisively.

However, this amount of computation power was never a problem for supercomputers.

In other words, the biggest problem that venerable yang Shan had encountered two to three thousand years ago was no longer a problem.

Hence, when Xia ruofei heard the news, he was not disappointed. Instead, he was very happy.

This was because it indirectly confirmed their direction of solving the problem. Moreover, this conclusion came from a brilliant mathematician, so it was naturally more convincing.

Xia ruofei was even more excited. He asked,””Senior Yuntai, do you still have any comments about the rising Dragon Order from this venerable yang Shan? Or did he leave behind any ancient books or works?”

Layman Yuntai smiled bitterly.”There should be some of venerable yang Shan’s inheritance left behind, but there’s really not much about the rising Dragon Order. After all, senior yang Shan only studied the rising Dragon Order briefly and gave up. He never mentioned it again.” It was by chance that I heard the elders of my sect talk about this at the gathering where all the sects were discussing the rising Dragon Order. “
