Chapter 223: Revealing his extraordinariness (1)

Xia ruofei felt like he was sitting on pins and needles. Although he was just an ordinary person, he had heard of some of the big families in China. The old men of these families were all famous figures who had lived through the war years. Almost no Chinese had never heard of their names. It was obvious that he was now involved in the battle between these families. Moreover, this incident was likely to be the fuse. Xia ruofei only listened for a while, but he could feel the glint and flash of swords. There was no benefit in listening to such a family secret. He wanted to get up and leave, but song Zhengping had made it clear that they weren’t avoiding him, so he was now in a dilemma. However, Xia ruofei was also from the military and had a decisive personality. Since he could not leave, he would just take things as they came. He had a heaven – defying divine weapon like the spirit painting scroll. The worst outcome would be to leave Huaxia and go overseas. No matter how powerful these families were, they could not cover the entire world. After a day of interaction, Xia ruofei felt that the song family was not the kind of heartless people who would burn the bridge after they had served it. They would not let an ordinary person like him get involved in family disputes and sit by and do nothing. Just as Xia ruofei’s mind was racing, song Zhengping finally spoke,””Old Lu, draft a report immediately and clearly write down the entire incident of the medical group. Then, express our serious doubts about the professionalism of the medical group and our strong indignation. Finally, request to select suitable candidates to form a new medical team. This report will be signed under the names of us siblings and submitted directly to the central administration!” “Alright, I’ll get it done immediately!” Manager Lu said. “Zhenglin, you’ll be returning to Ludong province today.” Song Zhengping continued,”do what you have to do. Remember, although you are the head of Port Authority in name, you are still far from being able to control the work situation. When you go back, you will have two tasks. One is to ensure the safety and stability of the port; The second is to strengthen the building of the cadre. ” The Secretary had always been the person in charge. Song Zhengping was worried that someone would deliberately cause trouble at this time. If there was a petition or other group events, or even a major accident, song zhenglin’s position as the acting Secretary would probably be over. As for the construction of the cadre, to put it bluntly, it was to choose and use people. This was also the meaning of being a leader. By grasping the power of personnel, the prestige of a leader would naturally be established. “Brother, um ... Dad ...” Song zhenglin was stunned. “You don’t have to worry about dad. I still have a few days off, so I’ll be here! You return today!” “Remember,” song Zhengping said.”After you return to Lu Dong, put aside all that ‘biding your time’ stuff! The only thing you need to do is to control the situation at the port in the shortest time possible. Get rid of those who should be sneaky!” Song Zhengping’s words were filled with killing intent, and it roused song zhenglin. He immediately said,””I know what to do. Don’t worry, big brother!” Song Zhengping nodded and continued,””Old Lu, Zhiping, Zhilan, spread the news through some channels today that our old man’s condition is under control and is gradually getting better!” “Alright!” “Understood!” Manager lü, Song Zhiping, and song Zhilan all replied in unison. Song Zhengping muttered to himself for a moment before asking,””By the way, Zhiping, I remember that the auction for Beijing’s Plot No. 8 is in a few days, right?” Song Zhiping was mainly in charge of the song family’s family business, Huatian group. She was basically in charge of all the business matters. Song Zhiping nodded.”It’ll be auctioned the day after tomorrow. However, the competition this time is more intense. Plus, Hongsheng and a few other real estate companies have already formed a team. Huatian is planning to strategically give up on this auction.” Hongsheng group was the family business that the Liang family controlled. “Go back to Beijing tomorrow,” song Zhengping said firmly.”Personally follow up on the matter of Plot No. 8. We must obtain this plot of land at all costs!” “But Hongsheng ...” “You don’t have to worry about Hongsheng!” Song Zhengping said,”I’ll talk to him personally. It’s fine if it’s a fair competition, but if Hongsheng dares to use those underhanded methods, I guarantee that he’ll suffer a double loss!” The only thing you need to do is to defeat Hongsheng in a fair fight!” Song Zhiping immediately said,”Alright! Don’t worry!” Song Zhengping was indeed the eldest son of the song family. In such a short time, he had issued a series of orders, targeting the Liang family. He showed his muscles, warned them, and beat them down. The song family’s power was on full display. After the arrangements were done, song Zhengping slowly retracted his aura. He looked at Xia ruofei with a pleasant expression and said,””Doctor Xia, other than the treatment, I have something else to ask for your opinion on.” “Please speak, Chief Judge song.” Xia ruofei said in a neutral tone. “You heard it just now. We will immediately request for a change in the medical team members from the central office.” Song Zhengping said,”you will definitely be the leader of the next treatment, so I was thinking that it would be better to form the new Medical Group with old Chinese medicine experts as the foundation.” Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””Governor song, I have the opposite opinion. I think that the medical group should still be mainly composed of Western doctors. ” “Oh? I’d like to hear more details!” “I’ll be arrogant, but I’m more than enough to handle Chinese medicine.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”however, the treatment of liver cancer is a very complicated process. This process also requires the cooperation of Western medicine. Moreover, it’s best to have the final treatment effect based on the various tests of Western medicine, which is more intuitive and accurate. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,””I’m not Liang Haitao. I won’t deny Western medicine just because I’m in Chinese medicine!” Everyone couldn’t help but smile when they heard this. In fact, everyone present was very clear that Liang Haitao’s behavior this time was mostly because he was headstrong and self – opinionated. It wasn’t the Liang family’s idea to instigate the Liang family. No matter how powerful the Liang family was, they couldn’t be so bold as to murder a former core leader. Besides, with elder song’s condition, he didn’t need them to kill him! At that time, even if they tried their best to save elder song, he would not live for more than a day. However, the song family had been holding back for a few months and needed a reason to declare their existence. And so, Liang Haitao became such an unlucky person. In this sense, Xia ruofei had helped them again. Xia ruofei did not beat around the bush like these people in the government. He said directly,””In addition, I would also like to give you my personal opinion on the composition of the medical team! “I’m more inclined to the young and middle – aged experts. Forget about the old professors who enjoy special subsidies from the National affairs Department. I’m afraid that the two sides will have different ideas and differences. “Of course, the young and middle – aged experts must make sure that it’s not an arrogant third generation red generation expert like Liang Haitao. Otherwise, it’ll be even more difficult to deal with than the old experts.” “No problem!” Song Zhengping chuckled. I’ll personally make the arrangements. “
