“Forget about the stone gambling ...” Xia ruofei smiled.”I know my limits.” Boss Chen, I’m looking for you to buy another batch of Jade. The quantity is a bit large, so I’m calling to ask first. ” “Oh? How much do you need?” When boss Chen heard that there was business, he was immediately interested. “Five million Chinese dollars!” Xia ruofei said indifferently and continued to ask,”do you have any in stock?” Boss Chen couldn’t help but take a deep breath. A business deal of five million Yuan was not a small deal even in the Jade industry. Furthermore, Xia ruofei was a long – term customer, and the demand for Jade was increasing every time. Boss Chen quickly calculated the stock in the store and said,””It shouldn’t be a problem. Brother Xia, you can come over at any time!” In fact, there was not much stock in spirit Jade house. However, boss Chen had agreed to it in order to secure a long – term customer like Xia ruofei. He had a few other Jade owners who he had good relations with. It was not a big problem to ask them to help with the turnover temporarily. “That’s great, I’ll drive over now!” Xia ruofei said. Then, Xia ruofei took his bank card and went downstairs to inform ye Lingyun. He then drove his newly acquired Knight XV towards the antique Street of the flowers and birds market in the three mountains city. This car naturally earned a lot of heads when it entered the city. Xia ruofei found a parking lot near the antique Street and parked his muscular Knight XV before walking to Lingyu house. By the time Xia ruofei arrived at Lingyu house, boss Chen had already prepared the five million Yuan worth of Jade that he needed. After Xia ruofei checked that there were no mistakes, both parties happily completed the transaction. Boss Chen even invited Xia ruofei to buy two raw stones next door to play with, but Xia ruofei rejected him tactfully. It was good to play stone gambling occasionally. If one bought it often, even if he chose a raw stone with a high price and did not open it on the spot, there was always the risk of exposing his secret. Besides, Xia ruofei made money very quickly, so buying Jade was the safest way. After taking the five million Yuan worth of Jade, Xia ruofei bade farewell to boss Chen and left spirit Jade house. After retrieving the overbearing Knight XV, Xia ruofei drove back to Paradise Farm. Ye Lingyun and pang Hao were busy with their own things. Xia ruofei carried a big bag of Jade and went to the bedroom on the second floor. After locking the door and windows, he summoned the spirit map scroll from his palm. Without another word, Xia ruofei opened the big bag of Jade and let the spirit map scroll absorb it. The pieces of jade were thrown into the painting and disappeared without a trace, like a clay ox entering the sea. Each piece of Jade was worth at least ten thousand, or even tens of thousands, and they were thrown into the spirit map scroll one after another as if they were free. Even though Xia ruofei was already used to the evolution of the spirit painting, he could not help but feel the pain in his heart. The Jade that was worth five million Chinese dollars was completely absorbed by the painting in a short while. Xia ruofei couldn’t wait to enter the spirit map space. First of all, he felt that the invisible spirit Qi in the space had become denser, and he felt as if he was floating in the air when he took a deep breath. Looking around, Xia ruofei could feel that the space had expanded. However, the space had become very large and it was not easy to see how much it had expanded. On the other hand, the spatial spirit pond had become much bigger. However, Xia ruofei frowned slightly. He realized that the diameter of the spatial spirit pool had increased to about six to seven meters. After the first evolution, the diameter of the spirit pool had become two meters, and the second time, it had become four meters. The space for the third evolution did not expand, but there was an invisible spiritual Qi inside, which allowed Xia ruofei to keep the spirit map scroll in his body. According to the previous pattern, since the space for evolution had been expanded, the diameter of the spirit pool should have been expanded to about eight meters! How could it only be six or seven meters? Xia ruofei frowned and thought for a while. Then, he decided not to care about this. He was most concerned about the plant and the five – colored flower on it. Hence, Xia ruofei quickly walked towards the nameless plant. 1、2、3、4、5…… Xia ruofei counted twice and realized that there were still five petals. It was not like he had expected to see an additional petal. He had just harvested five petals three days ago, and the five petals today were newly grown. According to the previous pattern, it was very likely that the sixth petal would appear! Xia ruofei’s brows furrowed even more. At this moment, he suddenly noticed a change. At the end of one of the branches of the nameless plant hung a thumb – sized fruit, green with a hint of light red. Xia ruofei’s heart started to beat faster. The petals of the wondrous flower already had so many heaven – defying effects, but this time, the nameless plant actually bore a fruit! What kind of special effects would this fruit have? Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel excited and let his imagination run wild. However, he quickly realized that the fruit was not fully ripe yet. When he thought about the size of the spatial spirit pool, he had an answer. The evolution of the realm this time was not complete. After coming to this conclusion, Xia ruofei wanted to cry but had no tears. The first evolution of the space only used a piece of Jade paperweight given by professor Tian. The second evolution cost him 500000 Yuan of Jade. The third time, he had spent two to three million Yuan worth of Jade. Of course, this evolution also allowed Xia ruofei to keep the spirit map scroll in his body, solving the biggest hidden danger. This time, it was a Jade worth five million Yuan! After absorbing it, it still hadn’t completely evolved. The upgrade and evolution of this spirit map space was really too costly. However, the benefits of the evolution were obvious. Not to mention the expansion of space and the increase in time flow, Xia ruofei felt that it was worth it to spend any amount of money on the extra petal of the flower. One had to know that the petals of this strange flower would grow new every three days, and there would be one more petal every time. After a long time, it would accumulate to an incredible number. It could have more than a hundred petals in a year! And this time, a spiritual fruit that seemed to be of a higher grade appeared. Xia ruofei had a feeling that this new spiritual fruit would be worth it even if he had to spend another five million! It seemed like he still had to think of ways to earn more money! Xia ruofei furrowed his brows as he tried to think of a quick way to earn money. It would be best if he could get some money to buy jade before the Spring Festival. The space was halfway through its evolution. Xia ruofei’s heart felt like it was hanging in the air, or like it had been scratched by a cat’s paw. He couldn’t wait to get more Jade to complete the evolution of the space. If he wanted to make money quickly, he naturally had to think of a way from the resources inside the space. Xia ruofei released his mind and scanned the space like a scanner, hoping to find some money – making inspiration from the things that were planted and raised in the space. Just as Xia ruofei’s thoughts were passing through the space, he suddenly felt a very mysterious connection with a certain place in the space. He had never felt such a feeling before his complete evolution. Xia ruofei looked confused. He strengthened the telepathic connection as he slowly walked toward the location he sensed ...
