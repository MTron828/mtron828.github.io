Chapter 1857: A dilemma (1)

Translator: 549690339

Liu haojun could not be judged with common sense. To be precise, he was not a standard politician.

He came from the Liu family, a prominent family in Beijing. His early development path had been planned by his family, including the National People’s Congress, which was known as the cradle of politicians, when he was in University. He quickly took up an important position in the Student Union and won a series of honors.

Of course, this had nothing to do with his personal efforts. On the contrary, the thing he focused on the most during his university days was perhaps picking up girls. With his good looks and prominent family background, he changed more than ten or twenty girlfriends in four years. Some even had abortions done for him several times.

If it wasn’t for his family cleaning up the mess for him, he would probably have been expelled from University because of all kinds of love affairs.

After graduating from university, Liu haojun followed the planned route and used a series of “honors” to successfully “enter” a certain Ministry and stay in Beijing to work. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Clerk, clerk, Deputy Section Head, main section Head ... There was an advance for almost every level, and soon he was promoted to Section Chief in a very powerful Department.

If this was in the local area, he would definitely be a bright political star if he was transferred to a major in his twenties after graduating a few years ago. However, in the Department – Level and Department – Level ministries, it was not as obvious.

Of course, this was also what the Liu family wanted to see.

According to his family’s plan, Liu haojun should at least be promoted to the chief or Deputy Department in the Ministry before he sought to be demoted. That way, he could directly be a member of the Standing Committee at the level of a Prefecture – Level city. If he was demoted to the Deputy Department, it was even possible for him to become the second – in – command of a Prefecture – Level city if he operated well.

He might be able to gain more experience in a few more positions in the Ministry, or simply change to another Ministry to enrich his resume, but he would definitely not leave the capital so early.

However, Liu haojun made full use of his “specialty” from his college days. He was not content with his work. Others were like rabbits who did not eat the grass near their nest, but he did not care about meat or vegetables. As a result, he got a young girl who had just graduated more than a year ago pregnant. This young girl was also his subordinate in his department.

Originally, Liu haojun was very familiar with dealing with this kind of thing. He could settle it with some money. He didn’t expect that the little girl was serious. After she got pregnant, she chased after him all day and wanted to get married.

He had also misjudged her. He felt that this little girl did not have any background, but she was still at his mercy. He did not expect Liu haojun to be so unyielding. He was completely unmoved by his threats and promises. When she realized that Liu haojun was just toying with her feelings, this hot girl from Sichuan Province decided to fight to the death and directly caused a scene in her unit.

Liu haojun was caught off guard, and this matter was known to everyone. Even if the Liu family was powerful, it was difficult to suppress this kind of lifestyle problem. After all, it was all out in the open.

As a result, Liu haojun couldn’t stay in the Ministry anymore. Even the other units in Beijing couldn’t operate well. After all, there was a very obvious stain on his reputation.

The Liu family was left with the only option to persuade Liu haojun to be demoted to the grassroots level in advance and keep him away from the capital. After a few years of working at the bottom to gain experience, when the storm slowly subsided, he would be promoted one or two levels in the local area and find an opportunity to be transferred back.

Therefore, Liu haojun was demoted to the southeast province, which was far away from the capital. Because he had been in the Ministry for a few years, he was promoted to the important position of Deputy Secretary of Changping County.

If it were an ordinary person, they might have kept a low profile at the bottom level, worked hard for a few years, got promoted, and then quietly transferred back to the capital.

However, Liu haojun was obviously not an ordinary person. At first, because of the strict instructions of his family elders, he was relatively low – Key. However, not long after he took office, he found out that there was a beautiful woman like Wu Liqian in the team. What was more, she was single. He immediately returned to his old ways.

With the superior attitude of a Beijing cadre, Liu haojun didn’t take this small government office in Changping County seriously at all. Soon, he openly pursued Wu Liqian, and the entire county party Committee and the government office were talking about it.

Liu haojun didn’t expect that Wu Liqian, a female cadre of a “small place”, would be an iceberg. She was completely unmoved by his sweet attacks. When he pressed her harder and harder, she even rejected him in front of the members of the Standing Committee.

Liu haojun had the mentality of hunting for beauties. He wanted to relieve his boring grassroots life. He did not have real feelings for Wu Liqian, so after losing face, he was naturally angry.

After angering Liu haojun, Wu Liqian’s life would not be good.

Liu haojun was sent to work in Changping County because his family had some resources in the southeast province. These resources were originally used to help Liu haojun gain some achievements and capital, but he used them to suppress Wu Liqian.

Ever since she had a showdown with Liu haojun at the Standing Committee, Wu Liqian felt that the resistance in her work had suddenly increased a lot.

She was already very used to working in the government, but unknowingly, many things seemed to have gotten out of her control. Even a low – ranking Deputy County Head dared to openly oppose her opinion in the county Head office. Furthermore, he opposed her for the sake of opposing and not out of work considerations.

In addition, a project that Wu Liqian had been following up on to attract investment had inexplicably failed. Both parties had already discussed the specific preferential policies and some details, but the other party’s negotiation team suddenly publicly announced that they would temporarily give up the project for the company’s strategic considerations. There was no warning at all, and no one even told Wu Liqian.

Originally, once this investment project that involved hundreds of millions was settled in Changping County, it would be another eye – catching achievement during her term. But now, it had become a laughing stock.

At that moment, Wu Liqian’s prestige in the Changping County system had dropped to the freezing point.

Wu Liqian sat in her office, her face full of worry. She didn’t know why the good situation had suddenly taken a turn for the worse. She had been full of hope for her political career, and Changping County was just a relay station for her to take off. But now, it seemed that this small Changping County was likely to become her wheat city.

In the past two days, Wu Liqian had thought more than once about calling her former leader, Tian Huilan, who was far away in Beijing for help, but she had suppressed this idea time and time again.

Tian Huilan had been kind to her and appreciated her a lot, so before she was transferred, she had arranged for her to be the deputy head of the Changping County, a position that would be easy to achieve.

Now that she was in this state, she felt too ashamed to contact Tian Huilan.

Moreover, Tian Huilan had already been transferred to the capital, so it was hard to say if she could help with this matter. It would be embarrassing if the leader helped her to coordinate things but the matter was not settled.

Just as Wu Liqian was frowning and thinking of a way to break out of this situation, the phone on her desk rang.

Wu Liqian took a deep breath and cleared her mind of all the messy thoughts. She picked up the phone and said in her usual calm voice,””Hello? Who is it?”

“County Head Wu ...” Liu haojun’s annoying voice came from the phone.”I heard that there is a seafood restaurant in Zhanggang that serves delicious sea mussels. I have made a reservation for you tonight ...”

“Deputy Secretary Liu!” Wu Liqian interrupted Liu haojun impatiently and said,”I’ve already made it very clear to you! We’re just ordinary colleagues at work. I won’t accept any personal invitation from you now, and I will never accept it in the future! I hope you won’t disturb me anymore!”

“You’re always so cold to people, but I like your personality!”Liu haojun laughed.

Wu Liqian said with a cold face,”boring!” Deputy Secretary Liu, we’re not kids anymore. Is there any point in this childish pestering? I hope that you won’t call my office in the future. I still have work to do. Goodbye!”

“Wait! County Head Wu, you’d better let me finish!” Liu haojun shouted,”I’m looking for you to eat. It’s to talk about work!”

Wu Liqian said coldly,”let’s talk about work in the office!” What kind of work are you talking about after work?”

“Hahaha! Is that so?” Liu haojun asked smugly,”regarding the withdrawal of Huanglong group’s funds, are we also going to discuss it in your office?”

Wu Liqian’s heart skipped a beat. She frowned and asked,””What do you mean by that?”

The Huanglong group was one of the companies that Wu Liqian was planning to bring in to Changping. The initial investment of 700 million was already close to reaching an agreement, but it was withdrawn without any warning, catching Wu Liqian off guard.

“County Head Wu,” Liu haojun said with a smile,”whether or not Huanglong group’s project can be settled in Changping will all be up to me. CEO Huang even promised me on the phone yesterday that everything will be under my command! Hahaha ...”

Wu Liqian’s head buzzed. The doubts she had these days were suddenly solved. The obstacles she had encountered one after another at work were all Liu haojun’s doing!

It was not that she had not thought of the possibility of Liu haojun causing trouble, but first of all, Liu haojun had only been in office for a short time, and he was just a demoted official from the capital, so he should not have any Foundation in the local area. Secondly, attracting investment of hundreds of millions of Yuan was a very good thing for the development of Changping County. She felt that Liu haojun wouldn’t abandon the development of Changping County just because of his personal grievances.

Now, it seemed that she had underestimated Liu haojun’s influence and his shamelessness.

Liu haojun was still gloating,””County Head Wu, you haven’t been having a good time these past few days, right? Why? I just want to be friends with you. If you give me face, I will naturally give you face!”

“What do you want?” Wu Liqian asked coldly.

“It’s very simple! Accompany me for dinner tonight. ” Liu haojun said with a smile,”as long as you become friends with me, you will be surprised to find that the Huanglong group’s project will continue as usual. Deputy County Head Zhou, who you don’t get along with the most, will even become your staunchest ally. There are many other benefits, you can take your time ...”

“Don’t even think about it!” Wu Liqian squeezed out these two words through gritted teeth and then hung up the phone in anger.

In the next hospital, Liu haojun from the Changping County party Committee had a smug smile on his face. He slowly hung up the phone and muttered to himself,””What a fierce horse! But I like those with a strong personality, it’s more fun to play like this!”

After Wu Liqian hung up the phone, her towering chest heaved up and down slightly. There was a look of anger on her face, and she wanted to smash something several times, but she resisted the urge.

Just then, the phone on the desk rang again.

Wu Liqian almost lost control of her emotions. She grabbed the phone and scolded,””Are you done yet?”

A familiar voice came from the other end of the phone, with a hint of innocence,””Sister Qian, who provoked you? Why are you so angry?”
