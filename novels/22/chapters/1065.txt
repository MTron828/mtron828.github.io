Chapter 1066: Chapter 674 – hit it off -2

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”same to you!” Mr. MA, the Hengfeng auction house has also made a name for itself in front of the Hong Kong media!”

“Hahaha! That’s all thanks to Xia Sheng!” MA Xiong said with a carefree smile.

He looked at the young man in his 20s and felt both admiration and regret. He thought of when he was still running a small business, Xia ruofei already had his own company and made tens of millions of Yuan from an auction.

MA Xiong had to admit that the abalones that Xia ruofei had put up for auction this time were too attractive. If he had not bought two of them through the “back door” in advance, and if the Hengfeng group was not the organizer of today’s auction, he would definitely not be able to resist joining the bidding.

“Xia Sheng, you’ve reached an agency agreement with Mr. Tang He?” MA Xiong asked thoughtfully.

Xia ruofei forced a smile.”I was just joking a few days ago. Mr. Tang also bought two one – headed abalones from me. He set the price of three million for one abalones at that time. He also told me that the price would definitely be higher if they were put up for auction. So ...”

Xia ruofei shrugged.

“If I didn’t hear it wrong, you guys bet on the North American agency rights, right?” MA Xiong asked.

“Yes,” Xia ruofei nodded.

“Then what about Hong Kong ...” MA Xiong immediately asked.

Xia ruofei forced a smile.”Old Mr. MA, our business in the abalones field has not been fully developed yet. This is just a thought. Even if we start to cultivate abalones in the future, it will definitely not be possible for all of them to be one – headed or two – headed abalones ...”

“Of course I know that!” MA Xiong said with a smile.

The rarer something was, the more expensive it would be. If one – headed and two – headed abalones were so easy to breed, why would the rich people at the auction fight for them?

“But I’m still very interested in your company’s abalone!” MA Xiong continued. Xia Sheng, if your paradise Corporation starts to breed abalones, can you let our Hengfeng group handle the sales in Hong Kong? Our seafood business is quite big, and we have many channels ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel flattered. His project hadn’t even started yet! Super – rich people like MA Xiong and Tang He came to talk about cooperation.

Under MA Xiong’s instructions, Hengfeng group had put in a lot of effort for the auction. Hence, Xia ruofei could not reject MA Xiong’s request.

Besides, it was only in Hong Kong. Although there were many people in Hong Kong who loved seafood and the market was huge, it was still a small place.

He pondered for a while and said,”since old Mr. MA is so kind, we’ll do as you say!” Once we start mass – producing them, I’ll get my people to contact you in advance!”

“That’s great!”MA Xiong said happily. Xia Sheng, you don’t know ... The bosses of the seafood industry have been looking for me to cooperate with them, and many of my old friends who couldn’t attend the auction have been calling me after hearing the news ... We have a huge demand for seafood in Hong Kong!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”then I’ll be in your care, old Mr MA!”

“Where? You’re the one who’s taking care of our business!” MA Xiong laughed.

“Oh right ...” Xia ruofei said,”old Mr. MA, it might take some time for our company to mass produce abalone, but in the high – end market ... We should still have the opportunity to cooperate!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Xia Sheng, what do you mean?” MA Xiong’s eyes were filled with interest.

“The one – headed and two – headed abalones that are being auctioned today!” Xia ruofei said,”I think if we hold one or two auctions a year, or even make it a tradition to hold it every year, it should be able to create a huge brand effect!”

MA Xiong was shocked and asked,”Xia Sheng, are you saying that you can provide more one – headed and two – headed abalones?”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””If there aren’t many of them, it shouldn’t be a problem! Of course, this also requires time. ”

“Sure, sure!” MA Xiong said excitedly,”one – headed and two – headed abalones are rare products. If we have too many of them, it will cause the price to drop. Besides, time is not a problem. Even if we only auction them once a year, as long as we have a fixed practice, we can even monopolize the high – end abalone market!”

One – headed abalones would not appear on the market for many years, and two – headed abalones were also quite rare. If Hengfeng auction house could auction high – Quality one – headed abalones and two – headed abalones every year, it would definitely be a monopoly.

Because there was only one shop!

As long as this continued for a year or two, when people talked about high – end abalones, they would definitely think of the Paradise Corporation and the Hengfeng auction house.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”then it’s decided!” I’ll contact you in advance when the next batch of top – grade abalones is ready!”

He had also seen the great success of the auction and felt that it was too easy to make money from high – end abalones. Today, he had earned nearly 100 million Hong Kong dollars from only 20 to 30 abalones that he had bred in his experimental breeding.

It was actually not difficult for Xia ruofei to get one – headed or two – headed abalones, especially when there were not many of them. He could completely replicate the previous experimental breeding model and use the time flow of the Archean realm to mass – produce them.

It was just that the matter of changing the water was more troublesome, but with Xia Qing taking care of everything in the space, if the quantity was not large, it would only take Xia Qing a few days of hard work a year, so it was not a problem at all.

Xia ruofei and MA Xiong hit it off and decided to hold an auction before the Spring Festival.

There was still about half a year before the Spring Festival, and that was the time when everyone’s spending was the highest. At the same time, the Spring Festival was so festive that those rich people definitely wouldn’t mind spending a few million to buy a top – grade abalone to add color to the New Year’s Eve dinner.

While MA Xiong and Xia ruofei were chatting happily, the press conference next door had finally ended.

The media reporters left one after another, all going back to rush their articles and grab the headlines.

Xia ruofei was very confident about the press conference. The experienced Feng Jing would definitely be able to deal with all kinds of tricky questions from the reporters. She would also be able to promote paradise Corporation at the right time.

When he saw the happy smile on Feng Jing’s tired face, he knew that the press conference was going to be a success. He couldn’t help but look forward to the media’s reports tomorrow.

In fact, with the advancement of information technology, there were already online media reporting about it at the auction.

However, the large – scale reports, including some mainstream newspapers, radio stations, and television stations, would definitely be released tomorrow.

MA Xiong, who was in a good mood, held a celebration party at Hengfeng Jiahua Hotel to reward the staff of Hengfeng auction house who had participated in the preparation of the auction. Xia ruofei and Feng Jing naturally joined the celebration party.

Little Huanhuan, who had just finished her morning classes, followed Tian Huixin to the celebration party.

Tian Huixin heard Ma Zhiming talk about the auction in the morning and immediately congratulated Xia ruofei and Feng Rao.

Little Huanhuan was definitely not concerned about the auction. She only knew that big brother RUO Fei had finished his work and would have time to play with her. Therefore, she was very happy.

At the celebration party, the Hengfeng employees naturally toasted MA Xiong frequently. Xia ruofei walked to Feng Jing’s side with a glass of wine and said with a smile,””President Feng, you’ve worked hard these days! I’ll toast you!”

“I don’t deserve a toast from the chairman!” Feng Rao said with a half – Smile. I should be the one toasting you ...”

Xia ruofei laughed drily and said,””You’re being too polite, aren’t you? Er ... Boss Feng, now that work has come to an end, I’ll be staying in Hong Kong for a day or two. You can relax here too! We’ll go back to the three mountains together in two days. ”
