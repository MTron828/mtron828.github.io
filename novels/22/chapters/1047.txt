Translator: 549690339

After speaking, Feng Jing opened her laptop bag and placed it on the desk before turning it on.

“Alright,” Xia ruofei said.”I won’t disturb you from your work!”

Feng Rao raised her head and smiled at Xia ruofei.”Thank you, Chairman!”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand. He closed the door behind him as he left the room.

Initially, he had invited Feng Jing to move in with him, but it was just a joke that Xia ruofei had blurted out. After that, he felt that it was inappropriate. He had not expected Feng Jing to really move in.

Although the Presidential Suite was huge, it was still considered a suite. Xia ruofei felt that it was a little too much for a man and a woman to stay together.

However, since Feng Jing had already moved in, Xia ruofei couldn’t possibly go back on his word. If he did, Yingying might really fall out with him.

He could only smile bitterly, shake his head, and walk back to the master bedroom.

In the afternoon, Feng Jing shut herself in her room to deal with her work. Xia ruofei had nothing to do, so he went to the Presidential Suite’s theater and watched a movie that had just been released.

Although the recording studio was not big, the facilities were quite luxurious. It used the most advanced sound – absorbing materials and the best sound equipment. Facing the real leather first – Class seats was a huge screen. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The effect of watching the movie was much better than in the cinema.

After the movie, it was almost dinner time. Xia ruofei went back to his bedroom and changed into a suit before returning to the living room.

He looked at Feng Jing’s tightly shut door and wondered if he should knock on her door to remind her. He knew that Feng Jing would lose herself in her work and might even forget the time.

MA Xiong had also invited Feng Jing to the dinner party.

Just as Xia ruofei was hesitating, the melodious sound of the doorbell rang.

Hence, Xia ruofei gave up on the idea of reminding Feng Jing and stood up to open the door.

The moment the door opened, Xia ruofei heard a happy voice.

“Brother RUO Fei!”

Then, a figure jumped into his arms.

A warm smile appeared on Xia ruofei’s face. He squatted down and opened his arms, allowing the angel – like little Huanhuan to pounce on him.

Xia ruofei lifted Huanhuan up and asked,””Huanhuan, did you miss your brother?”

Huan Huan nodded her head like a chick pecking at rice.”I want to!”

Then, she pouted and said,”big brother ruofei is so bad!” You don’t even come to Hong Kong to see Huanhuan ...”

Xia ruofei said awkwardly,”brother has been very busy with work ... Well ... I’m here today, aren’t I?”

“Liar!” Huan Huan raised her head and said,”brother ruofei is here for work too! I’ve heard about it from Grandpa ...”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei felt even more embarrassed. Ma Zhiming and Tian Huixin, who had come with Huanhuan, didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

“Huanhuan, how can you say that!” Tian Huixin quickly said.

“It’s okay, it’s okay ... Mr. MA, aunt Huixin, please come in and sit!”Xia ruofei said with a smile.

At this moment, Feng Jing, who had been working in her room, opened the door and walked out.

Seeing that Xia ruofei’s beautiful subordinate was also in the Presidential Suite, Ma Zhiming and Tian Huixin’s expressions became a little strange. Of course, they were not stupid enough to ask anything. They just smiled and nodded at Feng Jing.

Ma Zhiming and Tian Huixin were only curious, but Huan Huan didn’t care about that. After seeing Feng Jing, she immediately asked with her eyes wide open,””Big brother ruofei, why is there a pretty big sister in your room? Is she your girlfriend?”

Xia ruofei and Feng Rao blushed.

“Huanhuan, this is my brother’s colleague,” Xia ruofei quickly said.

“Why do colleagues live together?” Huan Huan tilted her head and asked in confusion.

Xia ruofei was immediately embarrassed. Tian Huixin quickly said,””Huanhuan, why are you asking so many questions? Hurry up and come down! Your big brother ruofei’s hands are already sore ...”

“Don ‘t, don’ t!” Huan Huan shouted and hugged Xia ruofei’s neck tightly.

“I’m fine, I’m fine!” Xia ruofei said,”Huanhuan isn’t heavy ...”

After being frightened by Tian Huixin, Huan Huan was no longer bothered by the fact that her colleagues could live together. Xia ruofei also heaved a sigh of relief.

Feng Rao’s pretty face was slightly red as she greeted Ma Zhiming and his wife.

Xia ruofei explained.”President Feng wanted to report to me about the auction. There are a lot of empty rooms here. So, I asked her to move in. It’s more convenient for her to work ...”

Ma Zhiming and Tian Huixin looked at each other and chuckled as they nodded. No matter how one looked at it, their gazes were somewhat ambiguous.

Ma Zhiming’s family had come to invite Xia ruofei for a meal, so after everyone sat down and chatted for a while, they prepared to go to the restaurant downstairs.

Feng Rao also went back to her room to change into a formal suit. Xia ruofei put Huanhuan down and went to the master bedroom to take out the gift that he had prepared before leaving.

As soon as Xia ruofei returned to the living room, Huanhuan immediately wanted him to hug her. After Huanhuan’s autism was cured, she had been very close to Xia ruofei. This was a kind of intimacy that came from the bottom of her heart. Even Tian Huixin was a little envious.

Xia ruofei had no choice but to pass the things in his hands to Feng Jing. Then, he carried Huanhuan and the group of them left the Presidential Suite and took the special elevator downstairs.

MA Xiong had invited Xia ruofei to the Jiahua restaurant on the third floor of the hotel. It was a Michelin – starred restaurant owned by Hengfeng Jiahua Hotel.

MA Xiong did not invite anyone else to the banquet. The guests were only Xia ruofei and Feng Jing while the MA family only had MA Xiong, Ma Zhiming and their wife, as well as little Huanhuan.

Xia ruofei and the rest entered a small elegant private room in Jiahua restaurant. MA Xiong immediately stood up and greeted them with a bright smile.

“Old Mr. MA!” Xia ruofei smiled and greeted him.

“Xia Sheng, miss Feng, come, come, come, sit here!” MA Xiong said with a smile.

Xia ruofei said to Huanhuan,”Huanhuan, can you go to mom’s place first?” Big brother has something to do. ”

Although Huan Huan was very attached to Xia ruofei, she still replied obediently,””Alright ...”

After handing Huan Huan over to Tian Huixin, Xia ruofei took the things that Feng Rao had prepared earlier. He smiled and said,””Mr. MA, I’ve brought you some gifts. It’s just a small token of my respect!”

He had prepared half a catty of top – grade Da Hong Pao for MA Xiong, while Tian Huixin had received the jaded skin cream that Xia ruofei had personally brewed. Although the mass production of jaded skin cream had been put on the agenda, there was still a difference between hand – brewed and mass – produced. After all, the rarer something was, the more expensive it was!

MA Xiong was a man who knew what was good. He knew that the tea was extraordinary just by opening it and smelling its fragrance. Tian Huixin had also received the jaded skin cream from Tian Huilan and knew the magic of this skin care product. Therefore, the two of them were very fond of the gift and repeatedly expressed their gratitude.

Finally, Xia ruofei took out a small box and said with a smile,””Huanhuan, this is a gift from brother RUO Fei! Open it and see if you like it. ”

Huan Huan had been itching to get a gift from her grandfather and mother, but her good upbringing had kept her from asking for it. When she heard that the box contained a gift from brother RUO Fei, she immediately accepted it happily.

“Thank you, brother ruofei!” Huan Huan said with a sweet smile.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Open it and take a look!”

“En!” Huan Huan nodded her head and opened the box.

MA Xiong’s family also looked over curiously. After Huan Huan opened the box, MA Xiong and the other two could not help but stare and gasp in unison ...
