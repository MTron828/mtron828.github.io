One had to know that even the smallest of the 30 abalones was more than enough to be the treasure of their flagship seafood store in Defu daoxi.

“Haha, then I’ll be counting on your blessings!” Xia ruofei laughed.

At this time, Luo Jiahao, an employee of the auction house who had come with Guo Song, finally had a chance to speak.

He stood up and said to Xia ruofei,”Mr. Xia, I would like to take some photos and videos for the early publicity.”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”the things are all here. You can use them however you want.” However, I hope we can hurry up. It’s best if these abalones are frozen. ”

Luo Jiahao quickly replied,”I understand! I understand!” Mr. Xia, I’ll start working now!”

The living room of Xia ruofei’s Villa had plenty of light and was quite spacious, so Luo Jiahao started the shoot in the living room. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Luo Jiahao was very professional. He took a shot of the whole abalone, a close – up shot, and all the abalones stacked together from various angles. In the end, he even took a video.

After that, Luo Jiahao immediately put away his equipment and said,””Mr. Xia, you can keep the abalones now. Thank you for your support!”

Xia ruofei smiled gently and said,””I should be the one thanking you! You guys came all the way from Hong Kong just for my company’s auction!”

Guo Song still looked at the abalones as if they were his lovers, and he was reluctant to part with them. After that, he and Luo Jiahao said their goodbyes.

Xia ruofei politely sent the two of them to the courtyard of the villa. After watching them get into the car and leave, he returned to the villa.

“Ruofei, let’s have a discussion!” Tang He asked as soon as he entered the door.

Xia ruofei looked at the dried abalone on the coffee table and asked with a smile,”Mr. Tang, are you also interested in abalones?”

Tang He smiled a little embarrassedly and said,”I’ve lived in the United States my whole life, but I’m still not very interested in Western food. Chinese food is more comfortable, so I want to try this top – Quality one – headed abalone!”

At Tang He’s level, there were few things he couldn’t eat no matter what he wanted to eat. Of course, there were some things he couldn’t eat for the sake of health. In addition, top – Quality ingredients like one – headed abalone were hard to find even if you had money.

“Ruofei, the main thing is that I have to fly back to the United States. Today,” Tang He continued immediately,”there are too many things to do at the company. Otherwise, I would have attended the Hong Kong auction directly.” But don’t worry, I won’t let you suffer a loss in the price. I can buy it from you at an additional 20% above the final price at the auction!”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand,”Mr. Tang, do you think I’m that kind of person?” We’re old friends. Since you want to try the taste of our company’s abalone, you can just buy it at the normal price. ”

This time, Xia ruofei did not say that he would give it to Tang He because this batch of abalones was originally going to be auctioned. It was completely different from the tea leaves. If Tang He had not said so, he would definitely not sell it on the eve of the auction.

Even if Xia ruofei wanted to give it to him, Tang He would definitely not agree.

“This ... You’ll be at a disadvantage ...” Tang He said hesitantly.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”It’s rare to be confused. It’s a blessing to suffer losses!”

After he finished speaking, he took out all the abalones from the paper bag. He first picked out the five abalones with slightly different packaging colors and said with a smile,””These five are only ten grams away from the standard of a one – headed abalone.”

Then, Xia ruofei pointed at the remaining abalones and said,”Mr. Tang, apart from the three largest abalones that I’m going to put up as the finale of the auction, you can choose any of the rest!”

Then, Xia ruofei jokingly said,”but you’d better go easy on me. Don’t pick too many abalones. If there aren’t many left at the auction, I’ll be in big trouble!”

Tang He laughed and did not stand on ceremony with Xia ruofei. He picked up two dried abalones that weighed about 610 grams and said,””Then I’ll take these two!”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei said as he packed the rest of the abalones, including the one that had been unsealed. He went to the kitchen and wrapped it in a few layers of preservation film.

“Please have a seat. I’ll put the abalones away!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Alright!” Tang He said with a smile.

Then, Tang He also handed the two abalones to his assistant and instructed them to put the abalones in the car refrigerator in the Bentley.

Xia ruofei carried the abalones upstairs. Naturally, he would not really put the abalones in the refrigerator. He put the abalones back into the spirit map space and waited in his room for a while before he got up and went downstairs.

Tang He was sitting in the living room and chatting with Hu Zi’s mother.

After seeing Xia ruofei come down, Tang He smiled and greeted,””Come, come, come, let’s talk about the price of the two abalones!”

Seeing this, Hu Zi’s mother greeted Tang He, got up, and went back to her room with a smile. She had stayed because she didn’t want to neglect the guests. Tang He wanted to talk business with Xia ruofei, so she immediately left.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”what’s there to talk about?” Just give it to me as you see fit ...”

“I knew you’d say that!” Tang He said with a smile. How about this, ruofei, two top quality one – Head abalones for a total of six million Chinese dollars!”

Xia ruofei was shocked and said,””This is too much! Tang ...”

Tang He waved his hand and interrupted Xia ruofei,””Ruofei, this price is not outrageous! Eight years ago, there was an auction in Hong Kong that sold a one – headed abalone. The quality and weight of the abalone were not as good as the two just now, but they were both sold for a sky – High price of two million Hong Kong dollars!”

Tang He took a sip of tea and continued,””At that time, the Hong Kong Dollar hadn’t depreciated yet, and the exchange rate was almost one to one with the Chinese dollar. You have to know that that was the price eight years ago! These two abalones are much more precious than the ones that were auctioned that year. If we take into account the inflation and other factors, I think the price of 3 million Chinese dollars for each is reasonable. ”

“But ...” Xia ruofei said.

“RUO Fei, the Hong Kong auction will soon prove my judgment.” Tang He chuckled and said,”why don’t we make a bet?”

“A bet?”

“Let’s bet on the final price at the auction. ” Tang He said with a smile,”if the transaction price of dried abalone of similar weight reaches or exceeds three million Chinese dollars, it’s my win. Otherwise, it’s your win. How about it?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”Then, what does old master Tang want to bet on?”

Tang He pondered for a moment and said,”if you win, I’m willing to take back the premium from today’s deal.” But if I win, I hope that shengbang group will have the opportunity to sell your company’s dried abalone products in the United States. ”

Tang He had a keen business sense. He knew that Xia ruofei’s abalone auction meant that paradise corporation’s stock would be full again. Otherwise, if they didn’t manage abalone sales in the future, it would be useless to make a name for themselves in Hong Kong!

Now that Tang He had seen what it meant by “the products of paradise must be of the highest quality,” he was also very interested in the dried abalone products of paradise company.

One – headed abalones and two – headed abalones were precious and top – Quality goods that couldn’t be sold all year round. However, three – headed abalones and even smaller ones could be produced in large quantities. As long as they could reach the quality of today’s batch of abalones, even if they were small, they could still be very useful in the high – end consumer market.

Xia ruofei did not hesitate and said with a smile,””Alright! I’ll make a bet with you!”
