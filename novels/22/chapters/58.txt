59  Another evolution_1

    After returning to the bedroom in the villa, Xia ruofei locked the door and took out the Jade and the Jade bracelet that he had obtained that day.

  Speaking of which, these things cost him 40000 Yuan in total to buy the bracelet. The two pieces of icy jade were cut from the raw stones that were given to him, and the other Jade that was worth 300000 Yuan was won from a bet.

  Xia ruofei took out the spirit map scroll as well. He picked up the Jade bangle first, then used his mind to communicate with the spirit map space. The bangle was immediately sucked into the space.

  He used his mind to check on the spirit map space and found that there were no changes in the space. However, he was mentally prepared for the Jade paperweight to be absorbed during the first evolution of the space. The Jade paperweight was far larger than the bracelet in both material and size.

  Xia ruofei judged that the amount of Jade needed for the second evolution would definitely be more than the first. Hence, it was within his expectations that the bracelet would not evolve after absorbing the space.

  He didn't stop. He immediately picked up the two icy jade from the free raw stones and let the spirit map space absorb them.

  After absorbing the icy waxy Jade, the space still didn't change.

  Xia ruofei could only take out the bag of jades worth 300000 Yuan. There were five or six pieces of jade in it. They were all absorbed by the scroll until there was only the smallest piece of Jade left. Xia ruofei suddenly felt that his connection with the space had become closer.

  He quickly used his mind to check and found that the spirit map space had finally evolved again.

  Xia ruofei looked at the remaining small piece of Jade and could not help but smile bitterly. The Jade that was used for the second evolution was worth 500000 Yuan. Although the Jade did not cost that much, Xia ruofei still felt a heartache.

  If the second evolution was already like this, the next time he wanted to evolve the space, he would probably have to spend several times more Jade.

  Xia ruofei had thought that he was making money very quickly, but now it seemed that he had to work harder if he wanted the realm to continue to evolve.

  The money he earned from selling vegetables and meat was barely enough to fill the gaps of his teeth if he were to exchange it for Jade.

  However, Xia ruofei did not dwell on it for too long. His mind had already flown into the space. He could not wait to see what changes the space had undergone after the evolution.

  Xia ruofei entered the spirit map space.

  After the familiar dizziness had passed, Xia ruofei took a deep breath in the space and realized that the air was fresher. He felt like he was floating as he took a deep breath. It was like the legendary paradise on earth.

  The size of the space doubled again, becoming a full four acres.

  The spirit pool in the middle of the space had also become four meters in diameter. Xia ruofei also realized that a "mini" stream had appeared in the space. It was called a "mini" because the width of the stream was only 40 to 50 centimeters. It was actually just a small ditch.

  The source of the stream was the spirit pond. After winding for more than ten meters, it formed a pond with a diameter of about two meters in a depression.

  Xia ruofei was most concerned about the nameless plant. After checking the changes in the space, he quickly walked to the nameless plant by the pond.

  Xia ruofei was overjoyed.

  Just as he had expected, the flower that he had just picked this afternoon grew again, and this time, there was an additional petal. The flower now was made up of five petals, and the latest petal was purple. The whole flower looked more harmonious and natural, as if it contained the ultimate truth of heaven and earth.

  Xia ruofei was overjoyed. Just this extra purple petal was worth the 500000 Yuan of Jade!

  After admiring it for a while, he carefully picked all the petals with a tweezer and stored them in a preservation box with a trace of reluctance.

  He walked around the space and tidied up the mess. Then, he came to the newly formed pond.

  Looking at the small pond in front of him, Xia ruofei thought for a while and felt that he should make full use of the resources because he needed to earn more money.

  Only by making more money could he buy more Jade, which would promote the realm's upgrade and evolution, and thus produce more benefits, forming a virtuous cycle.

  This pond was filled with spirit pond water, so it could be used to rear fish and prawns. He believed that in the unique environment of the spirit map space, the fish raised in the spirit pond water would definitely become a top - Class ingredient.

  Of course, after some exploration, he could also breed some fish with higher value in the space.

  There was also the flow of time in the space, so no matter what it grew, it would definitely mature quickly.

  Thinking about the flow of time, Xia ruofei immediately left the medium. He found the small alarm clock and sent it into the medium with his mind to test it again.

  Soon, the results were out. As expected, the time flow in the spirit map space had evolved again. Now, the time flow inside and outside was a full twenty times different!

  After a round of inspection, Xia ruofei left the spirit map space and kept the spirit map scroll that had evolved again. Then, he lay comfortably on the deck chair on the balcony and basked in the sun.

  He squinted his eyes slightly, and Ling Qingxue's beautiful figure flashed through his mind.

  'This girl hasn't contacted me for a few days ...' Xia ruofei thought to himself.

  He muttered to himself for a moment, then reached out for his phone, ready to give Ling Qingxue a call.

  Previously, the collaboration with Ling Ji restaurant had been halted because of he Dong's interference. Xia ruofei knew that Ling Qingxue must have been feeling terrible these few days and might still be working hard on the collaboration.

  Now that the name of paradise organic vegetables had been fully established, the company and the registered trademark would soon be registered. Everything was going according to Xia ruofei's plan, and it was time to let Ling Qingxue know.

  ……

  In the Nantai District of San Shan city, the headquarters of the Ling Ji food and beverage group was located here.

  It was a 13 - story building. The first to eighth floors were office buildings for rent, while the ninth to thirteenth floors were the office floors of the lingji food and beverage group.

  In a large conference room on the 12th floor, the middle and senior management of the Ling Ji food and beverage group were having a meeting.

  Sitting in the middle of the long conference table was Ling Qingxue's father, Ling Xiaotian. This person in charge of Ling Ji restaurant was around 50 years old. His square face exuded an air of authority and power. As he sat down, he naturally made people feel a sense of respect.

  The Vice President, director, and department manager of the company sat on both sides according to their ranks. As the manager of the finance department, Ling Qingxue and he Dong, the manager of the purchasing department, happened to be facing each other. He Dong often looked up to steal glances at Ling Qingxue, but Ling Qingxue's face was always as cold as ice, and she didn't give he Dong a good look.

  The meeting today was to discuss how to solve some of the current difficulties and the future development momentum of the group.

  The current situation was that the Ling Ji restaurant's main competitor, Ming Hao restaurant, was very aggressive. They hired a famous chef whose ancestor was said to be a Royal Chef as the Executive Head Chef at a high price. They launched several royal dishes in a row, and their performance soared.

  On the other hand, Ling Ji's restaurant was the exact opposite. They didn't come up with anything new in terms of their food. In addition, there was a small dispute a few days ago. A customer vomited and had diarrhea after returning home. Then, he insisted that it was a food hygiene problem at Ling Ji's restaurant. The trouble came every two or three days, making things worse.

  Now, a few chain stores were deserted and their business was not as good as before. This made Ling Xiaotian very anxious.

  The Department managers and senior executives were also very positive, but they didn't put forward any constructive opinions.

  Ling Xiaotian frowned slightly, his gaze falling on his daughter Ling Qingxue. Ever since he had rejected Ling Qingxue's request to cooperate with Xia ruofei the day before yesterday, Ling Qingxue had been cold to him, her father. Today, she was even more absent - minded in the meeting, which made Ling Xiaotian even more unhappy.

  He frowned and asked,"

  "Qingxue, stop looking at your phone! You tell me! Do you have any better ideas?" Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates
