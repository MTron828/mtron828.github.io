Chapter 868: Not a bad idea (2)

Translator: 549690339

Although it wasn’t difficult to send a car to pick them up every day, Lin Yue ‘e would definitely not accept such an arrangement.

Xia ruofei was sitting on the sofa in the living room. A summer drama was playing on the TV opposite him. However, his attention was not on the TV at all, so he did not notice what was on the TV.

Xia ruofei frowned and sighed at the thought that he did not know how to solve the problem of Nan Nan’s admission.

This was what he had promised Lin Yue ‘e. If he didn’t do it well, he would be breaking his promise!

Hu Zi’s mother had just walked out of the house. Seeing Xia ruofei’s long sigh, she couldn’t help but ask,””RUO Fei, did you encounter any difficulties?”

Xia ruofei forced a smile and said,”Oh, godmother, it’s nothing ...”

“You child, if you have any difficulties, just tell godmother!” Hu Zi’s mother reproached,”although Godma can’t help you much, it’s not good for you to keep things to yourself!”

Then, Hu’s mother suddenly asked,””Did you quarrel with Qingxue? You guys were still fine when she came to the farm a few days ago!”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly,”godmother, what are you thinking?” Why would I fight with Qingxue for no reason?”

“Then what’s the reason?” Hu ‘er’s mother asked.

Xia ruofei sighed and said,”Godma, it’s Nan Nan’s business.” Wasn’t she going to elementary school next semester? I have also promised sister – in – Law that I will make proper arrangements for Nan Nan’s schooling ...”

Xia ruofei then explained his dilemma in full detail.

Hu Zi’s mother was also silent for a while after hearing this. She said,””This is really not easy to handle ...”

At this point, Hu Zi’s mother’s eyes suddenly lit up.””You don’t say, I suddenly thought of a pretty good idea!”

“Oh, really? Godmother, hurry up and tell me!” Xia ruofei quickly sat up straight.

“It’s not convenient for old Luo and Yue ‘e to pick them up,” Hu’ er’s mother said with a smile.”I can help them!”

“You’re going to pick him up?” Xia ruofei did not react immediately.

Hu Zi’s mother sat down beside Xia ruofei and said,”Yeah! After school reopens, Qiao’ er will be going to Egret Island to study. I also want to move back there. There are several primary schools near me! I can help her drive her around! Why don’t you let Nan Nan stay with me? I’ll send her back on the weekend!”

“How can we do that?” Xia ruofei shook his head.”That’s too much for you!”

“What’s so hard about taking care of a child?” Hu Zi’s mother said,”didn’t I bring up Hu Zi and Qiao’ er by myself? Besides, Nan Nan is so sensible. I can take care of her!”

Xia ruofei hesitated as well. He had to admit that Hu Zi’s mother’s idea was a good solution. At least it was better than him not having any solutions before.

Of course, it was hard to say if Lin Yue ‘e would agree or not.

“Godmother, can you really take it?” Xia ruofei asked uncertainly,”you’re old now, and your body is not as good as it was back then ...”

“My body is much better than it was a few years ago!” Hu ‘er’s mother said,”when Qiao’ er was in primary school, I was often sick. Now, I don’t even catch a cold or cough anymore. The Chinese medicine you prescribed me during that time was very effective!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and finally nodded.””Alright! I’ll ask sister – in – Law for her opinion. If she agrees, then I’ll have to trouble you for a while. My company’s headquarters should be moving to the city in the second half of the year. I’ll change sister-in-law’s position in the office and help her rent a suite in the city so that she can pick me up by herself!”

Hu Zi’s mother chuckled and nodded, then continued,””Mm! If she doesn’t agree, I’ll go talk to her myself!”

“No need, no need ...” Xia ruofei quickly waved his hands.

“RUO Fei, why don’t you just call Yue ‘e over for lunch?” Hu Zi’s mother said,”when the time comes, we’ll persuade her together. She’ll definitely agree!”

“Alright! I’ll give her a call. ” Xia ruofei said.

He took out his phone and gave Lin Yue ‘e a call. Lin Yue’ e was currently working in the orchard. When she heard that Hu ‘Zi’s mother had invited her to eat WUFA, Lin Yue’ e didn’t reject her and agreed.

Hence, Hu Zi’s mother went to the kitchen to prepare some food while Xia ruofei sat in the living room and watched TV for a while. When it was almost time, he got up and went to the complex to personally invite uncle Luo over.

After uncle Luo had settled down at Taoyuan farm, Xia ruofei had treated him twice and his body was getting better day by day.

Of course, the main use was still the spirit Heart Flower petal solution.

After Xia ruofei brought uncle Luo and Nan Nan back to the villa, Nan Nan happily played with Blackie and lightning in the yard. Xia ruofei took out the best Da Hong Pao and chatted with uncle Luo in the living room while making tea.

Xia ruofei didn’t mention anything about Nan Nan going to school. Yingluo’s family matters were mainly decided by Lin Yue ‘e, so he wanted to wait until Lin Yue’ e arrived.

At noon, Xia ruofei heard Nan Nan’s excited voice from the courtyard.””Mother!”

He knew that Lin Yue ‘e had come over, so he stood up and went out to welcome her.

Lin Yue ‘e was wearing floral short – sleeved clothes and a pair of Sunproof white cufflinks. She was also wearing a straw hat as she walked into the courtyard, her face covered in sweat. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Sister – in – Law, the weather has been too hot recently. Don’t go up the mountain in the afternoon,” Xia ruofei said.

“That won’t do!” Lin Yue ‘e smiled and said,”the orchard has to be taken care of every day. If we don’t apply fertilizer to it in time, the fruit tree will suffer from malnutrition. When the weeds grow taller, they will compete with the fruit tree for nutrients. There’s work to be done every day! Besides, this is nothing. I’m not tired at all!”

Xia ruofei actually wanted to say that there was no need for such meticulous care. With his spirit Heart Flower petal solution, these fruit trees would grow very well even without any care.

However, Xia ruofei did not want to dampen Lin Yue ‘E’s enthusiasm for work, so he did not try to persuade her. However, he made a mental note to ask the canteen to prepare some food for the afternoon and evening to relieve the heat. For example, green bean soup, immortal herb honey, and the like.

Everyone entered the house together. Lin Yue ‘e went to wash her face first and urged Nan Nan to wash her hands. She had been playing with Blacky and lightning in the courtyard earlier, so her hands were dirty.

Hu Zi’s mother had already prepared lunch, and Lin Qiao had also come back from work. So, everyone sat around and started to eat.

“Auntie, you’ve prepared so many dishes again ... It’s really hard on you!” Lin Yue ‘e said.

“It’s not hard, not hard!” Hu Zi’s mother said with a smile,”usually, it’s just the three of us eating. It’s more lively with you guys here. You’ll make this place more lively!”

Everyone ate and chatted. After a while, Hu Zi’s mother gave Xia ruofei a look, and Xia ruofei nodded slightly.

Then, he organized his words and said,””Sister – in – Law, I have been thinking about Nan Nan’s schooling for the past few days ...”

“It’s about picking me up, right?” Lin Yue ‘e said,”I know that the location of our farm is a little remote. If Nan Nan goes to school in the city, she won’t be able to pick her up. So ... Why don’t we just go to the primary school in the nearby village?” This way, my father – in – Law can pick me up every day!”

“No, no, no!” Hu Zi’s mother quickly said,”the village primary school is about to close down. Many of the children from the nearby villages have been sent to the town to study. How can we go to the village primary school? Wouldn’t that be delaying the child?”

“Sister – in – Law, it’s definitely not good to live in a small village. Both the hardware and the software are too poor ...” Xia ruofei added.

He paused and continued,””I’ve discussed it with Godma today. We plan to ... Find a better school for Nan Nan in the city. Then ... Let Nan Nan stay with my Godma. She will help you guys to pick her up. I will pick Nan Nan up on the weekends. ”

“Ah? How can this be?” Lin Yue ‘e subconsciously waved her hands and said,”no, no! How could he trouble Auntie? Auntie is already so old, it’s very hard for her to take care of a child!”
