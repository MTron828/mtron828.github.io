Chapter 1936 Lowering one’s status (1)

Xia ruofei was about to leave for Hong Kong when he saw the news.

After a period of warm – up, the auction in Hong Kong had entered the final preparation stage.

This time, the ingredients and medicinal herbs that Tao Yuan company planned to auction in Hong Kong included the top – grade one – headed abalone, Cordyceps, iron – Skin fengdou, Dahongpao tea leaves, as well as the top – grade black truffle and white truffle. Besides, Xia ruofei had also found a few old mountain ginsengs in the medium and added them to the auction catalog.

These old mountain ginsengs were planted by Xia ruofei in the spatial zone. After being bathed in the extremely rich spiritual Qi for such a long time, they were at least three hundred years old according to the standards of the outside world and were considered extremely precious medicinal herbs.

The special auction this time had become a product exhibition for paradise Corporation. Except for the Jade skin cream and heart nourishing soup produced by the manufacturing factory, which did not participate in the auction, basically all of paradise corporation’s high – end products would be revealed.

Xia ruofei also attached great importance to this auction. He saw it as an opportunity to showcase the image of paradise Corporation.

After more than a year of rapid development, it was time for the Paradise Corporation to show its comprehensive strength to the outside world.

After waves of publicity, the attention of the auction was very high, especially the rich who had participated in the auction before. They all expressed great interest.

In addition, people in the food and beverage industry were also paying special attention to the auction.

Many Michelin – starred restaurants sent people to Hong Kong to register at Hengfeng auction house in advance and pay the deposit for the auction.

Because the value of the auction items was different, the security deposit was also divided into several levels. Different levels allowed different items to participate in the auction, and the auction house would give out different colored plates.

This was also to lower the threshold. For example, some people only wanted to buy iron Kaede Dou, and their economic strength was average. If they standardized a high deposit standard, it was equivalent to directly rejecting these people at the door.

The highest level of security deposit was 10 million Hong Kong dollars, and any item could be auctioned. The minimum security deposit was only 500000 Hong Kong dollars, and the bidding scope was limited to iron – skinned fengdou and Dahongpao tea leaves.

According to the feedback from Hong Kong, the bid deposit received during this period had exceeded 300 million Hong Kong dollars. It could be seen that everyone’s enthusiasm for registration was quite high.

While Xu Yougang and the others were busy keeping an eye on Liu haojun, Xia ruofei had already started preparing. The top – grade truffles that were going to be auctioned had all been packaged and stored in the space.

Xia Qing had also cultivated ten pairs of top – Quality one – Head abalones using the same method as last time and made them into dried abalones.

The Da Hong Pao tea leaves were also the most precious, second generation of the Da Hong Pao tea tree in the realm. They were the most essential parts of the tea tree. Xia Qing had done her best to produce them. There were only about 1500 grams in total. Xia ruofei planned to split them into five portions and auction them off in units of 300 grams.

The rest of the herbs, such as Cordyceps sinensis, iron – skinned fengdou, and old mountain ginseng, were also prepared.

These few days, Xia Qing had become the busiest person, especially the Cordyceps, which was more time – consuming. Xia ruofei even took some time to go to the medium to help Xia Qing dig. They had picked about 2700 of the highest quality.

These 2700 stalks of Cordyceps weighed 3000 grams, which meant that every 900 of them weighed 1000 grams. This quality had already far exceeded the 1100 stalks per kilogram that he had previously harvested. The standard of 1500 stalks of special grade grass per kilogram had also far exceeded that.

Of course, the planting area this time was much larger than the first time, so they had harvested more Cordyceps. Xia ruofei and Xia Qing had specially picked out the larger Cordyceps to process, so it was normal that the quality was much higher than the last time.

All the items prepared for the auction had already been sealed in the spirit map space. Other than the tin bucket that was made in the outside world, the rest of the auction items were basically selected and made in the space.

The auction was approaching, but there were still no signs of the auction items. Feng Rao was not in a hurry because she knew that Xia ruofei would never fight a battle that he was not confident of winning. She would never fire an empty cannon, so she did not urge him at all. She just did her job with all her heart and did her best. She kept in touch with Liu Qian, who was sent to the front line, and made sure that the preparations were flawless.

Taoyuan building, chairman’s office.

Feng Jing walked into Xia ruofei’s office with a laptop and asked with a smile,””Chairman, Liu Qian just called and said that the auction will be held in three days. Is that okay with you?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”everything is ready. We can go to the port at any time!” You tell Liu Qian that I’ve already prepared the actors. It’s up to them to set up the stage!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Alright! I’m relieved then!” Feng Rao pursed her lips and smiled.

“By the way, there aren’t many things at home on this trip to Hong Kong. Many senior executives will go with you!” Xia ruofei said,”sister ran, you must go too!”

“Alright, then I’ll go ask for everyone’s opinion.” Feng Rao said,”going to Hong Kong isn’t a difficult task. I’m sure everyone will be very happy to participate! However, I don’t think manager Xue and director Xiao will be able to leave. Director Dong and director pang should be fine!”

“Just say it in the group!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”there’s no need to send an email for such a small matter ...”
