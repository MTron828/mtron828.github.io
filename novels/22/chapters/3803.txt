  Xia ruofei stood in front of the moss - covered rock. This was actually the Jade void temple's Mountain Gate. The formation that the Jade void temple used to hide their tracks was completely useless in his eyes.

  Of course, if it was an ordinary person from the secular world, or even a cultivator with a relatively weak array Dao, or a cultivator with insufficient spiritual power, they would not be able to see anything even if they came in front of this huge rock.

  Xia ruofei had changed his appearance this time because he had no intention of hiding his tracks.

  Therefore, he didn't break the formation of the Jade void temple on his own. Instead, he stood in front of the mountain Gate and shouted,""Fellow Daoist of the Jade void temple, I'm Cang Xu. I'm here to pay a visit to your sect's immortal Yu Qing. Please pass the message!"

  After all, a sect like the Jade void temple had a thousand years of inheritance. Even if it had declined in the past two to three hundred years, it was not like those unrated sects, where they had no rules to follow. Hence, Xia ruofei paid special attention to these details. Even though he was here to give them benefits, he did not want to break the rules.

  Moreover, he knew that such an important position as the mountain Gate must be guarded at all times.

  As expected, just as he finished speaking, there was a wave of ripples on the huge rock. A middle - aged Taoist walked out and sized Xia ruofei up with a judgmental look.

  Xia ruofei smiled and did not hide his cultivation. He released the aura of a late - Stage golden core cultivator.

  The middle - aged Daoist's expression changed slightly. He quickly bowed and said respectfully,""Junior Yuming greets senior Cang Xu!"

  Xia ruofei smiled and nodded, maintaining the demeanor of an expert. He said lightly,""So it's fellow Daoist Yuming. I've met your sect's immortal Yuqing once, and I've come to visit you this time. I wonder if immortal Yuqing is in the sect?"

  Yu mingzi muttered in his heart. This senior Cang Xu's cultivation was unfathomable. The sect leader of the Jade void temple was only in the early stage of the Golden core realm. From the cultivation aura that Xia ruofei had just released, his cultivation was much higher than the sect leader 's!

  When they alighted from the black Phoenix flying ship, Xia ruofei had already used a secret technique to change his appearance and even put on some makeup.

  He had a head full of white hair and a white beard. His face had changed a lot compared to his usual self, and there were even a few more wrinkles. In addition, he was wearing a Daoist robe that cultivators often wore.

  Wearing a moon - White Daoist robe, he looked like a Sage - like senior cultivator.

  Xia ruofei stood in front of the moss - covered rock. This was actually the main gate of the Jade void temple. The formation that the Jade void temple used to cover their tracks was completely useless in his eyes.
