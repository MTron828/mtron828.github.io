1944 The difference between heaven and earth (1)

At 10:15 P. M., A Boeing plane from Beijing landed smoothly at San Shan airport.

It was already 10:30 P. M. When Wu Liqian dragged her suitcase out of the passage, looking tired.

She was indeed very tired. The schedule of the training class was quite tight, and she had been reading until very late these days, so she didn’t have enough sleep. In addition, the night flight she was on encountered traffic control at the busy Beijing airport. The plane that was supposed to take off at six in the evening was delayed for two hours and only took off from Beijing at eight. According to the plan, they should have landed on the three mountains by now.

In order to ensure that the plane could be pushed out and taxied as soon as it was released, the flight crew chose to let the passengers board the plane in advance. Wu Liqian had been trapped in the cabin for more than an hour, and after more than two hours of flight, she was very tired by the time the plane landed.

However, as soon as she got out of the passenger passage, Wu Liqian was stunned. She saw that the Secretary of Changping County, Zeng jianzhang, had come to the airport in person. Similarly, the county Head, Zhu zhihang, was standing beside Zeng jianzhang.

As soon as they saw Wu Liqian, they greeted her with a smile.

Zeng jianzhang gestured for his Secretary to take Wu Liqian’s luggage, then said with a smile,””County Head Wu, you’ve had a long journey!”

Wu Liqian came back to her senses and quickly said,””Secretary Zeng, County Head Zhu, why did you come here personally?”

The Secretary and the county Head coming to the airport to welcome the executive Deputy County Head at the same time sounded like a fantasy, but it really did happen.

The most important thing was that the flight was delayed by more than two hours.

Did this mean that Secretary Zeng and County Head Zhu had been waiting at the airport for more than two hours? Thinking of this, Wu Liqian felt even more incredulous.

Zeng jianzhang laughed and said,”County Head Wu is the hope of our Changping County!” Didn’t I say that I would give you a welcome dinner today?”

Zhu zhihang also joined in the fun.”We just didn’t expect the plane to be so late. It’s said that the accuracy of the plane in the direction of Beijing is very low. This time, we’ve finally seen it for ourselves!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Wu Liqian quickly said,”leaders, you’re really putting me to shame ... How could I dare to let you welcome me?” This ...”

“Hahaha! We’re all comrades of the same team, there’s no need to be so particular!” Zeng jianzhang smiled broadly.”County Head Wu, let’s go! The car was waiting outside! I’m sure you didn’t eat well on the plane. I’ve already ordered supper! I’m going to give you a welcome dinner today!”

Wu Liqian was still in a daze after she got into the car. There was something wrong with the two class monitors today.

In fact, the reason why Zeng jianzhang and Zhu zhihang were so “courteous” today was that they attached great importance to the project of Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory. Whether the project could be successfully introduced to Changping depended on Wu Liqian alone. The most important reason was that Wu Liqian’s importance in Zeng jianzhang’s eyes had far exceeded the past.

After listening to Zhu zhihang’s report today, Zeng jianzhang’s curiosity about Xia ruofei increased. He tried to ask about Xia ruofei and did not expect to get some useful information.

After working as the Secretary for two years, he was fortunate enough to attend a training course at the party school. The lowest rank in the class was an advanced student, which was the minimum threshold to enter the highest school in the party. The training course had allowed him to accumulate a lot of connections.

Today, Zeng jianzhang was actually just trying his luck by giving a call to a student from the party school who was working in the Beijing Ministry.

This student from the party school was already a Deputy Director back when he was attending a training class. Now, he had been promoted by one rank and became the head of an important Department.

Zeng jianzhang’s phone call was mainly to catch up and to mention Xia ruofei. He didn’t expect his classmate from the Communist Party school to know Xia ruofei.

And according to this student from the party school, Xia ruofei was quite famous among the second and third generation in the capital. He was very close to a few nouveau riches with strong backgrounds.

Zeng jianzhang’s mind was jolted when he heard this. He thought of Zhu zhihang’s report that Xia ruofei had said that Wu Liqian’s leave of absence did not need the county to show up.

At first, Zeng jianzhang thought that Wu Liqian would ask Tian Huilan for leave. After all, she was Tian Huilan’s former Secretary! Now it seemed that Xia ruofei had asked for the leave.

A successful entrepreneur with powerful connections at the top. In Zeng jianzhang’s eyes, this was someone worth befriending.

Xia ruofei and Wu Liqian were obviously very close, so Zeng jianzhang quickly decided to pick them up personally. This was not only a form of compensation for the grievances that Wu Liqian had suffered, but also a way to express his goodwill to Xia ruofei.

Wu Liqian didn’t know about Zeng jianzhang’s thoughts, so she was a little reserved all the way. She only felt a little more at ease when she returned to her dormitory after having supper at the hotel.

Wu Liqian didn’t even bother to take a shower. She took out her phone and called Xia ruofei.

“Sister Qian, have you reached the three mountains?” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”I saw that today’s flight is quite late on the flight monitor.”

Xia ruofei was the one who had booked Wu Liqian’s flight ticket, so he naturally knew the details.

When Wu Liqian found out that Xia ruofei was still following her flight information on the internet, she could not help but feel warm inside.

She smiled and said,”yes!” He had been in the capital for a long time! After I landed, Secretary Zeng and County Head Zhu insisted on welcoming me, so I’m only home now ...”
