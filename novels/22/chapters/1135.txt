Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”Of course not, I’ll tell you the truth! If it wasn’t for this Jade Leaf, the best outcome for you right now would be a Broken Head and a concussion. If it was more serious, you might have lost your little life!”

Lu You’s heart trembled. If it wasn’t for the magical process of the blood contract which gave her a mental buffer, she would never believe Xia ruofei’s words. However, when she thought of the scene where the blood mysteriously melted, Lu You felt that the materialism that she had learned for many years seemed to be wavering ...

Xia ruofei saw Lu You’s dumbfounded expression and smiled.””I didn’t tell you the details this morning because I was afraid it would be too shocking and you wouldn’t believe me. I didn’t expect this jade talisman to work so quickly. You’re really something ...”

Lu You laughed in embarrassment.

Her hands tightly clutched this Jade Leaf that seemed to be connected to her heart, and her heart was warm.

This Jade Leaf was actually so precious. It could be a life – saving treasure at a critical moment! Xia ruofei gave it to her directly.

He should be concerned about me ... Lu You secretly thought to herself.

Xia ruofei saw Lu You’s dazed expression and couldn’t help but laugh.””What are you thinking? Don’t be in a daze, let’s go! President Feng must be very anxious!”

“En!” Lu You’s eyes turned. She looked deeply at Xia ruofei before she lowered her head and said softly,”thank you ...”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment and then said,””I’m not used to you being so polite to me ... Oh, right, don’t tell anyone about this Jade Leaf! Don’t even tell aunt Tian and professor Tian ...”

Lu You’s heart was filled with sweetness. She felt that she had a secret to share with Xia ruofei. However, this little girl didn’t know that Xia ruofei had given the Jade leaves to more than just her. Xia ruofei had to explain it to everyone. 1

In fact, Xia ruofei had wanted to say it in the morning, but he did not have the chance to.

Now that Lu You had experienced such a terrifying moment, the effect of reminding her would be much better.

“I understand,” Lu You said seriously.”Don’t worry!”

Xia ruofei and Lu You walked out of the staircase together.

Feng Rao also walked over in surprise and said from afar,””Chairman, miss Lu, the CT scan did not find any brain damage! I can finally rest assured!”

In fact, the CT scan report would not come out so soon, but the doctor in charge of the examination could see the CT image. However, there were many people doing CT scans, and they usually came out with the report at the same time.

Feng Jing was very sociable. She went to the doctor and said a lot of good things about Lu You. Finally, she found out about Lu You’s examination. The CT scan did not find any abnormalities in his brain, nor did he see any external injuries or blood clots.

Feng Rao heaved a long sigh of relief and ran over to Xia ruofei to report the good news.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s good that you’re fine!” Lu You, don’t be so rash in the future. You must pay attention to your safety. ”

“I understand ...” Lu You said softly.

Feng Rao looked at Lu You in surprise and then at Xia ruofei. Just now, the two of them had almost quarreled in public. How did Lu You become so docile in such a short time? What kind of magic did Xia ruofei use to suppress her?

However, Feng Jing, who had been under a lot of pressure all this time, was finally able to relax. So, she didn’t think too much about it and smiled.””Chairman, I was really scared to death this morning ...”

“President Feng, I’m so sorry!” Lu You took the initiative to say,”I’ve caused you trouble and delayed your filming ...”

“It’s fine!”Feng Rao said generously. We’ll go there again in a few days when the weather is better. We can shoot other scenes in the next few days. ”

“Can you make it in time?” Xia ruofei asked.

“No problem, don’t worry, Chairman!” Feng Rao said casually.

It was already fortunate that Lu You was fine. As for the filming progress, it was nothing more than overtime. Feng Jing didn’t really care about it. There was definitely enough time now, unless all kinds of accidents happened at the same time.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”alright, CEO Feng. Go and explain to Duff and the team. Tell them that Lu You is fine and don’t worry. I’ll send Lu You back!”

“Chairman, the official report hasn’t been retrieved yet!” Feng ke said.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”there’s no need. I’ve just checked Lu You. She’s really fine. There’s no need to take the report.”

Only then did Feng Jing realize that Xia ruofei was a brilliant doctor. Hence, she had no more worries and left the hospital after bidding the two of them goodbye.

Xia ruofei brought Lu You to the hospital’s parking lot to get their car.

He first brought Lu You back to the hotel and took down the Jade skin cream and the box of tea leaves that he had prepared in the morning. Then, he drove Lu You home.

After Tian Huilan came to Beijing to work, she wasn’t in a hurry to buy a property in Beijing, so she had been living in a public house provided by the development and development Committee. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

However, as the main leader of the development and Reform Commission, Tian Huilan’s accommodation standards were also very high. Although the central government had been paying close attention to building up their style, they still enjoyed the normal treatment that a Ministry – Level leader should enjoy.

Therefore, Tian Huilan’s residence was the largest apartment in the old family compound of the development and Reform Commission. Although the building looked a little old from the outside, the interior decoration was still pretty good.
