If Liu chengfeng could really be taken in by Xia ruofei, his Qi Level 7 cultivation alone would be much higher than Li Yifu ‘s.

Among the people around Xia ruofei, his direct disciple Tang Haoran was still young and had a low cultivation. Ling Qingxue and Song Wei were only at the third level of the Qi refining realm. Even if they were about to break through to the fourth level, they would still be far behind Liu chengfeng.

Furthermore, Liu chengfeng was very familiar with the world of cultivation. He was also a disciple of the fallen leaves sect. This would be very helpful for Xia ruofei to get in touch with the world of cultivation in the future.

If he could completely subdue Liu chengfeng, it would be equivalent to planting a spy in the falling leaves sect. At a critical moment, it might play an unexpected role.

Of course, the premise of all this was that he could completely subdue Liu chengfeng. At the moment, there was no other way.

If Xia ruofei was really a nascent soul cultivator, it would be easy. The problem was that his cultivation was only a little higher than Liu chengfeng ‘s. Furthermore, Liu chengfeng already knew part of the secret of the spirit map space. Even if he didn’t know that this was an independent small space, just a cave abode with extremely dense spiritual Qi was enough to shake the cultivation world. Hence, Xia ruofei would not risk sending Liu chengfeng out.

Of course, if Xia ruofei really had the cultivation of the original infant stage, he would not need to arrange any spies. He could destroy the falling leaves sect with a wave of his hand.

All in all, Xia ruofei did not want to leave any hidden dangers behind. At the same time, he held onto the hope of subduing Liu chengfeng. That was why he did not kill him on the spot but kept him in the spirit map space instead.

However, there was no other way for now, so Xia ruofei could only keep Liu chengfeng in captivity.

In the blink of an eye, Xia ruofei arrived at the large space cage where the assassins and mercenaries were imprisoned.

With a wave of his hand, the two spatial cages disappeared.

One to two hundred people screamed as they fell from the sky.

Xia ruofei easily used the invisible force of space to hold them up just as they were about to hit the ground.

Then, he casually demonstrated what seemed like a miracle to these “foreigners” and easily dispelled their thoughts of resistance.

Even the arrogant leader of the modr mercenary group, Douglas, was scared out of his wits by Xia ruofei, the “Eastern deity”.

No matter how powerful the Special Forces were, could they defeat the ‘Immortals’ who could fly in the sky and travel on the ground?

Moreover, after being locked up in the space cage for the past few days, these people’s spiritual will had long been worn down. With the “appearance” of Bao Guijun, Golden Fox merendo, and Viper Boak, these killers and mercenaries were quickly incorporated.

On the other hand, Manzila, nicknamed Satan, did not play any role in the process of recruitment.

No one in the upper echelons of modr knew his identity except for Boak. Douglas only knew that his boss’s nickname was Satan.

The assassins and mercenaries were also split up and sent to their own groups. Bao Guijun and the others had more people under them.

Xia ruofei simply allowed them to add a higher level of leadership and divided each group into three teams. He let Bao Guijun and the other team leaders choose three team leaders to each take charge of one team and assist them in management.

The squad leader also enjoyed a certain amount of basic points.

Bao Guijun and the others were naturally overjoyed. They had more soldiers under them, and they could also have a certain “human rights.” The management would naturally be more flexible.

Other than the lack of freedom, Bao Guijun, Qian guiyou, and the others felt that this place was not bad. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

There would be no harm without comparison.

At the same time, it was also because of this comparison that Bao Guijun and the rest felt that they were at least living better than most of the captives. They felt much more balanced.

They even felt that it might not be a bad thing to be caught during a mission in China.

At least, they had the advantage in being free labor.

Xia ruofei gave them an hour after quickly regrouping the captives.

Xia ruofei didn’t need to do the work of grouping, splitting up, registration, arranging dormitories, collecting labor tools and basic living supplies. With Xia Qing in the medium, Bao Guijun and the others could do the specific tasks and naturally, everything was arranged in an orderly manner.

Xia ruofei left the medium and returned to the outside world. He rested in his bedroom for a while.

Less than an hour had passed, at most forty minutes, when Xia ruofei received Xia Qing’s telepathic message. This batch of free labor had been properly arranged.

With a thought, Xia ruofei re – entered the space.

Xia ruofei stood in mid – Air like a god. His voice was not loud but it was clearly heard by everyone. “Today’s work is temporarily suspended. Everyone, go back to your rooms immediately. You are not allowed to come out until you have received notice!”

In this space, Xia ruofei’s words were unquestionable.

As soon as the order was given, all the workers, under the leadership of their newly appointed team leaders, withdrew from the rice fields, medicine gardens, and other places in an orderly manner, and all returned to the mobile temporary houses to stay.

They didn’t know what had happened, and they couldn’t help but feel nervous, especially those who had lived in the space for a while. It was the first time they had encountered such a situation.
