“Alright! Let’s go have a good time!” Song Rui said with a smile.

Hou Liang and the others also nodded in agreement.

Lin Qiao said goodbye to Zhao Yongjun and the others sweetly and followed Xia ruofei to the parking space not far away.

Xia ruofei was still carrying a big bag of food in his hand. This was the braised food that Hu Zi’s mother had made overnight. She had stored it in the hotel’s refrigerator yesterday.

The two of them drove straight to Heron Island University.

When they arrived at Heron Island University, the car was allowed to pass after it was successfully registered with Lin Qiao, a student of the University.

Xia ruofei drove the car directly to the female dormitory where Lin Qiao was staying and took out two big bags of things from the car.

“Qiao’ er, can you carry it?” Xia ruofei asked,”do you want to call your dormitory mates to come down and help?”

Lin Qiao giggled,”brother ruofei, you’re underestimating me!” When we were at home, I could carry water, chop firewood, and cook. I could do anything!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be in a daze. He was thinking of the first time he met Lin Qiao.

That time, Lin Qiao was carrying water. Her thin and weak body carried a heavy bucket as if it would be crushed at any time. It made people’s hearts ache for her. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

At that time, Hu Zi’s mother was already at the end of her life because of uremia. Even Xia ruofei himself could not see any hope of life because of the terminal illness.

Fortunately, everything was over! Xia ruofei silently said in his heart,”in the future, with me around, Godma and Qiao’ er will not have to suffer like that anymore ...”

“Brother ruofei, what are you thinking about?”

Lin Qiao’s voice reached Xia ruofei’s ears. When he came back to his senses, he saw Lin Qiao’s face so close that it was almost touching his face. Her big beautiful eyes were looking at him curiously.

Xia ruofei took a step back in fear and said,””Qiao’ er, what are you doing? I was so scared!”

Lin Qiao laughed and said,”you’re still criticizing me?” You didn’t respond when I called you a few times just now, as if someone had hit your acupoint! I thought you were possessed!”

“What are you saying!” Xia ruofei pretended to be stern.”You’re so rude!”

Lin Qiao giggled and stuck out her tongue, “You’re not that much older than me! Besides, we’re of the same generation!”

“I’m still your brother! You dare to say that your big brother is possessed?” Xia ruofei said, deliberately showing his teeth.

Lin Qiao put on a frightened look and took a step back. Then, she couldn’t help but giggle. Her shaking appearance attracted the attention of many passing boys.

“Stop it, stop it, we’re at the dormitory entrance!” Xia ruofei said,”since you’re strong, hurry up and carry it yourself!” Don’t delay the class!”

“Brother ruofei, can you stay with me for a little longer?” Lin qiaojiao pouted and said,”it’s still early! The second period has just started ...”

Xia ruofei said helplessly,”it’s not good to be late if you make preparations early ... How about this?” I’ll walk around your campus in the morning, and then we’ll have lunch together in the afternoon, okay?”

Lin Qiao immediately said happily,”great! Great!” Brother ruofei, I’ll go up now!”

After she finished speaking, she took the two big bags from Xia ruofei and carried them into the dormitory with some effort.

At the stairs, Lin Qiao turned back and smiled at Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei also smiled and waved at Lin Qiao. Lin Qiao then went upstairs with satisfaction.

The shape of the Knight XV SUV was too eye – catching, especially when it was parked in front of the girls ‘dormitory. It was simply an eye – catching magic weapon!

Hence, Xia ruofei drove the car to a quiet corner of the campus and stopped. He locked the car and started to stroll around Egret Island University.

There must be a reason why tourists flocked to Heron Island University and even limited the number of visitors. The campus had beautiful scenery and many cultural landscapes.

Xia ruofei was waiting for Lin Qiao’s class to end, so he wasn’t bored. He strolled around the campus leisurely. He even went to the famous Furong tunnel on the internet and admired the various graffiti in the tunnel. When he was almost done, he sat down on the grass beside Furong Lake and rested.

There were also many students who had no classes sitting by the lake, reading books and chatting. Xia ruofei could hear the laughter of youth in his ears.

He found that he quite liked this quiet and dull campus environment. It was a pity that he had never gone to college in his life.

At around 11 am, Xia ruofei received a call from Lin Qiao to inform him that she had finished her class.

When she heard that Xia ruofei was at Furong Lake, Lin Qiao told him to stay where he was. After a while, Xia ruofei saw Lin Qiao running over happily.

The two of them tasted the special Shacha noodles at the restaurant at the school gate. Xia ruofei asked Lin Qiao, who had classes in the afternoon, to go back to the dormitory to rest.

Before she left, Lin Qiao said pitifully,”Brother ruofei, I still want to go to Gulangyu with you guys tonight ...”

Xia ruofei forced a smile and said,”you little girl ... Why are you so playful?” It’s not the weekend tomorrow, you still have to come back to class!”

“I have a class in the afternoon tomorrow, so I have plenty of time!” Lin Qiao quickly said,”the final exams are coming soon, and the class schedule is not very tight. I can bring my books and review my homework in the hotel! The environment at Gulangyu is even better!”
