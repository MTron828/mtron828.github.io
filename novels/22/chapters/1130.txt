Translator: 549690339

Song Rui chuckled and returned to his serious look. Then, he couldn’t suppress his curiosity and asked,””RUO Fei, what’s so special about this pair of wood carvings? Tell me!”

Xia ruofei said,”it’s really just my intuition. I haven’t had the time to look at it in detail!” If you want to know ... Then come back to the hotel with me this afternoon!”

“Alright!” “Okay!” Song Rui responded happily.

The three cars made a few turns and finally drove into an alley. There was a very good private restaurant hidden there. It was obviously not song Rui and Zhao Yongjun’s first time here. After the car was parked, song Rui said to Xia ruofei,””This restaurant’s Palace cuisine is very special. I was going to bring you here to try it!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s okay. We can always try again if it’s good!” I’ll give you a chance to treat us!”

“You’re just thinking about eating from the rich!”Song Rui rolled his eyes.

Xia ruofei laughed and walked towards Xu Qiang and the others.

The private restaurant was located in a large courtyard with three entrances. It was very different from the messy social environment in Xia ruofei’s impression. This courtyard had obviously been renovated and the environment was very good.

Although the building materials were antique, they didn’t give people the feeling of being broken. It was probably made by professionals who specialized in repairing old buildings. Otherwise, it would be impossible to achieve such an effect of repairing old buildings as old as they were.

It was a traditional courtyard house with stone tables, stone chairs, grape racks, rocking chairs ... Xia ruofei could not help but feel tempted. If he could have such a quiet courtyard house in the bustling capital, it would be very pleasant.

However, now that the price of real estate in the capital had broken through the sky, a rare resource like a courtyard house was even more priceless. Even if there was a sale, the price would be at least over a hundred million.

Xia ruofei didn’t live in the capital for long, so he only thought about it and didn’t plan to do it.

However, Zhao Yongjun seemed to have noticed Xia ruofei’s interest. After everyone sat down in the room, Zhao Yongjun, who was sitting beside Xia ruofei, nudged Xia ruofei lightly and asked with a smile,””RUO Fei, this courtyard isn’t bad, right? Do you have any plans to buy one in Beijing?”

When Xu Qiang and Guo Ruchen heard this, they couldn’t help but be shocked. Anyone who could buy a courtyard house in Beijing must have extraordinary economic strength. Even if they were locals of Beijing and considered successful people, this was a high – end House that was more precious than a villa!

Xia ruofei smiled.”Brother Zhao, don’t scare me. How can I afford such an expensive house?” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Zhao Yongjun laughed.”Ruofei, don’t be so humble. I heard from song Rui that your business is very big in the southeast province. It’s not a big deal to buy a yard in Jing!”

Xia ruofei said,”I’m not being humble. My business is just starting out. I’ve invested all my money into the company. It’s not realistic to take out a few hundred million to buy a courtyard house.”

“The price isn’t that high!” Zhao Yongjun said with a smile. It depends on the location. ”

Then, Zhao Yongjun hesitated and looked at Xu Qiang and the others. In the end, he said,””Ruofei, if you really have the intention to buy a property in the capital, I know a good opportunity!”

“Oh?” Xia ruofei’s interest was piqued.”Brother Zhao, tell me about it!”

Xu Qiang and Guo Ruchen couldn’t help but prick up their ears. Even song Rui was very interested and stared at Zhao Yongjun.

Zhao Yongjun laughed and said,”I have a friend’s family who migrated overseas. The house he used to live in is about to be put up for sale. It’s in a good location, located in Dene Street liuhai Lane. It’s a three – inch – yard area, 1500 square meters, and the building area is more than 600 square meters. The yard is well maintained, and my friend said that all the furniture and appliances in the house will be given away. He won’t take a single piece with him!” If you buy it, you can basically live in it directly!”

Xia ruofei was a little moved. He smiled and asked,””Such a good location, such a big yard, the price must not be cheap, right? I heard that the unit price of some siheyuan in the capital has exceeded 300000 Yuan!”

If it was really 300000 per square meter, then the courtyard that Zhao Yongjun mentioned would be worth 400 to 500 million. Even Xia ruofei wouldn’t be able to take out such a large sum of money to buy a house.

“That’s a siheyuan near a scenic spot,”Zhao Yongjun said with a smile.” My friend’s house isn’t that exaggerated! The price of the nearby courtyards is around 100000 to 150000 Yuan per unit!”

“That’s about 100 or 200 million, right?” Xia ruofei said as he quickly calculated in his heart.

“Hehe, if you want to buy it, my friend will definitely give you the lowest price. I still have that little bit of face.” Zhao Yongjun said,”I can at least guarantee that the total price will not exceed 150 million!”

If it was tens of millions, Xia ruofei could squeeze a little, but 150 million was a little too much. However, after hearing Zhao Yongjun’s introduction, he was a little tempted and hesitated for a moment.

” 130 million is cheap enough!” Song Rui encouraged. RUO Fei, take him down!”

After all, Xu Qiang and Guo Ruchen were not familiar with Xia ruofei, so they only looked at them enviously and did not say anything.

Zhao Yongjun smiled and said,”ruofei, this is a good opportunity!” In such a location, with such a large courtyard and well – protected, this kind of resource was very scarce. Why don’t we ... Take a look at the houses first before deciding?”

“Let’s see!” Song Rui said,”you won’t lose anything by looking at it anyway!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”sure!” We’ll go over to take a look at the house in the next two days. If it’s really good, I’ll grit my teeth and buy it!”

“Haha, good!” Zhao Yongjun said,”ruofei, let me tell you. You’ll definitely be satisfied! If it wasn’t for the fact that I’m short on funds, I would’ve bought it ...”

“I don’t have a lot of funds either!” Xia ruofei said with a bitter smile.

He definitely couldn’t take out so much money at once, but now that he had a strong network and knew a few super – rich people, it wouldn’t be a problem to borrow some money.

Once Fairyland farm in Australia was on the right track, its monthly dividends would probably reach tens of millions of us dollars. It would be easy for Xia ruofei to return the money.

At this time, the dishes were also served, and Xu Qiang quickly called everyone to drink.

The meal went on for more than an hour. During the meal, Xu Qiang kept toasting to Xia ruofei and the others. Even Guo Ruchen, the Vice President of the capital city’s antique Association, also toasted Xia ruofei a few times. However, he was mainly impressed by Xia ruofei’s ability to identify wooden artifacts and wanted to be on good terms with him.

After the guests and the host had their fun, Xia ruofei and the rest left the private restaurant.

At the door, Xu Qiang expressed his sincere gratitude to Xia ruofei and watched as Xia ruofei got into the car and left.

While they were drinking, song Rui was still thinking about Xia ruofei’s pair of wooden sculptures. He secretly hinted to Zhao Yongjun, so after dinner, Zhao Yongjun did not go home. He drove behind song Rui’s Phaeton and went to the hotel together.

Back in the hotel room, song Rui immediately said,””RUO Fei, quickly take out that pair of wood carvings and let’s have a look!”

Zhao Yongjun was also looking forward to it. After all, Xia ruofei had already demonstrated his ability to appraise wooden items in the morning. The gift he had chosen was a pair of wooden carvings, so Zhao Yongjun naturally thought that this pair of wooden carvings had an extraordinary origin.

Never in his dreams would he have thought that Xia ruofei didn’t even know how to appraise a wooden artifact and that it was Xia Qing who had cheated. And he had chosen this pair of wood carvings not because of the wooden artifact, but because of the help of the spirit map.

Xia ruofei smiled as he opened the box and took out the wooden carvings.

In fact, he really did not check the wood carvings carefully. Under the watchful eyes of Zhao Yongjun and song Rui, Xia ruofei carefully observed the wood carvings. In fact, he used his spiritual power to do a full inspection of the wood carvings ...
