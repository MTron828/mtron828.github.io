Translator: 549690339

Then, he was not in the mood to talk too much with Xia ruofei. After saying his goodbyes, he quickly walked towards the vegetable greenhouse. The new greenhouse had been built for a few days, but there were no vegetables planted. Cao tieshu was very anxious! Now that the seeds had arrived, he couldn’t wait any longer and was ready to organize workers to start growing the seedlings.

It was a good thing that his employees were responsible. Xia ruofei smiled, restarted the car, and went home.

After returning to the small villa, Xia ruofei called Lei Hu over and asked him to bring his brothers from the security team.

As soon as Lei Hu and the others entered, their eyes lit up when they saw Blackie, fluffy one, fluffy two, and the rest in the yard.

When little black and the rest saw so many strangers, their fur was about to stand on end. They glared at Lei Hu and the rest.

“Blackie, we’re on the same side!” Xia ruofei shouted.

As soon as Xia ruofei spoke, Blackie and the rest immediately returned to their lazy state.

Only then did Xia ruofei say to Lei Hu,”Hu Zi, I’ve specially found these dogs to assist us in guarding the house.” This pure black one is called little black, and this is big hairy, second hairy, third hairy, fifth hairy, sixth hairy ...”

“Why isn’t hairy # 4 here?” Lei Hu asked, puzzled.

“Si Mao asked me to give it away!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

The ex – soldiers immediately laughed. There was really forty cents ... This name was really native!

Xia ruofei continued,”Blackie and lightning will stay at my place. Fluffy one, fluffy two, and the rest will be assigned to your security team!” Today, you should get to know each other and cultivate a good relationship in the future. These dogs are very smart and can be a great help to you!”

“Understood!” Lei Hu said. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Xia ruofei then called Blackie, fluffy one, fluffy two, and the rest over and introduced them to Lei Hu and the rest.

When the ex – soldiers saw Xia ruofei’s serious introduction of the dogs, they could not help but find it funny. Could it be that these dogs could understand human language?

Unexpectedly, Xia ruofei said after the introduction,””Alright, say hello to your companions!”

As soon as Xia ruofei finished speaking, fluffy one, fluffy two, and the rest stood up and waved their front claws at Lei Hu and the rest.

Lei Hu and the rest were dumbfounded. Their mouths were wide open, and they could not believe their eyes.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”what are you standing there for?” They have already acknowledged you! Go and take them away! Remember to bring them to patrol our territory today and let them know where the boundary of the farm is. In addition, it’s best to bring them to meet all the employees on the farm so that they can recognize our own people in the future!”

“Oh ... Good, good, good!” Lei Hu said.

“Da Mao, er Mao, both of you come with us!” He said hesitantly.

Fluffy one, fluffy two, and the rest of the five dogs immediately wagged their tails and followed behind Lei Hu and the others.

This was too smart! Lei Hu and the rest had really opened their eyes this time. The Veterans came back to their senses and also asked Lei Hu to be responsible for a certain dog.

With such a partner, the boring farm life would become much more interesting.

However, there were too many monks and too little gruel ... No, there were more people than dogs. As for who would be in charge of the five dogs, that was not Xia ruofei’s concern. It should be Lei Hu’s problem.

After fluffy one, fluffy two, and the rest left, the villa’s yard was much quieter.

Blackie and lightning got along well. The two dogs were very smart and came forward to please their master, Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei then called Cao tieshu and asked him to send someone to build another kennel next to Lightning’s for Blacky.

Xia ruofei had wanted to transport the iron – Skin Dendrobium strips back, but since master Luo was free to come over and would only arrive at the three mountains in the afternoon, Xia ruofei decided to do it tomorrow.

He suddenly recalled that it was time to deliver the Drunken Eight Immortals wine. Hence, he took out his phone from the villa’s courtyard and gave Ling Xiaotian a call.

The phone had just rung once, and Ling Xiaotian immediately picked up.

Before Xia ruofei could say anything, Ling Xiaotian said,””Ruofei, have you already gotten a high – Quality Blood Red Dragon?”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. Why was his future father – in – Law not concerned about the company’s Affairs at all? instead, he couldn’t wait to ask about the red Arowana?

Was it really good for him to be so playful?

“Uncle Ling, there’s no hurry to deal with the blood Dragon. I ...” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.

“How can I not be anxious?” Ling Xiaotian interrupted Xia ruofei and said,”I’m so annoyed by my friends, especially old Li and old Xu, who returned empty – handed last time. They’ve been asking me questions every day! I’m telling you, there are a few more powerful bosses who are also very interested in it. As long as you can get some good stuff, the price will definitely be higher than last time!”

Xia ruofei said helplessly,”alright!” Uncle Ling, please tell your friends that we’ll hold another small auction in your Villa three days later!”

“RUO Fei, did you really get a top quality Blood Red Dragon?” Ling Xiaotian asked in great joy.

“How could I dare to neglect something that uncle Ling personally handed over?” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“How’s the quality compared to the ones we had last time?”

“It definitely won’t be worse than the last one!” Xia ruofei said with certainty.

“That’s great!” Ling Xiaotian said happily.

Xia ruofei could even hear the sound of Ling Xiaotian slapping his thigh.

After Ling Xiaotian complimented Xia ruofei, he came to his senses and asked,””By the way, ruofei, why did you call me?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile bitterly and said,””You just remembered? I thought you didn’t even want the company anymore after you got the red Arowana!”

Ling Xiaotian couldn’t help but let out a dry laugh and said,”The company has been doing well recently! It’s nothing big!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry as he asked,”uncle Ling, I just wanted to ask when was the last time I delivered the Drunken Eight Immortals wine to the winery?” I think it should be almost a month?”

Ling Xiaotian laughed awkwardly and said,””I really can’t remember. I’ve been busy dealing with those fish friends recently! Ruofei, wait a moment, I’ll call the winery and ask ...”

With that, Ling Xiaotian hung up the phone.

Hearing the busy tone from the phone, Xia ruofei could not help but smile bitterly. This father – in – Law was so unreliable that he couldn’t even remember himself ...

Fortunately, Ling Xiaotian called back after a while.

“Uncle Ling, how is it? Have you asked clearly?”

Ling Xiaotian chuckled,”ruofei, the wine factory is about to report to me!” It’ll be exactly a month until tomorrow. How are things on your side? Can you get the wine ready tomorrow?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh when he heard that. The two things had come together again. That was just right.

He immediately said,”no problem!” Uncle Ling, let them go to the warehouse from last time at 9 am tomorrow.” By the way, can you help me arrange a small truck? I still have something to transport back to the farm. ”

“Alright! Don’t worry! I’ll have them make the arrangements. ” Ling Xiaotian said,”ruofei, that ... Don’t forget about the Blood Red Dragon!”

Xia ruofei replied helplessly,”uncle Ling, don’t worry!” I can’t forget!”

“Hehe, alright, I’ll inform the old guys immediately and have them prepare the money!” Ling Xiaotian said,”this time, we’re going to slaughter them ruthlessly!”

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and shook his head. Then, he walked into the villa.

Lin Qiao was still fiddling with her laptop in the living room. Xia ruofei told her about the e – commerce Department in the company and asked her to intern and learn web design from a decent designer.

Lin Qiao was overjoyed when she heard this. She pulled Xia ruofei’s arm and thanked him with a smile.

It seemed that this girl was really interested in design. She had never been so happy when Xia ruofei gave her a house a few days ago.

The girl’s body was already very mature. When she grabbed Xia ruofei’s arm, her chest inevitably pressed against his. Xia ruofei suddenly felt that he couldn’t take it anymore. He quickly withdrew his hand and ran upstairs as if he was escaping.

Lin Qiao looked at Xia ruofei’s back as he ran away and laughed mischievously.

Xia ruofei returned to his room to continue learning about the abalone cultivation in Sanshan city.

It was only when Hu ‘Zi’s mother called for him to eat that he turned off his computer and went downstairs.

While they were eating, Xia ruofei realized that he had nothing else to do today, so he decided to visit the nearby abalones in the afternoon. If it was suitable, he might as well buy the abalones.

Hence, after lunch, Xia ruofei bade farewell to Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao before leaving the farm in his pickup truck.
