Chapter 199: Ten thousand kinds of gentleness (1)

“Oh ...” Ling Qingxue’s body suddenly stiffened, and her watery eyes widened. She subconsciously wanted to break free, but Xia ruofei held her tightly, and their bodies were pressed against each other. Ling Qingxue’s eyes were filled with emotion as she rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei just chuckled and did not say anything. He pulled Ling Qingxue’s slender hand and sat down on the sofa. Their fingers were intertwined. Xia ruofei’s other hand was around Ling Qingxue’s soft and slender waist. Ling Qingxue leaned her head on Xia ruofei’s shoulder and let out a happy sigh. At this moment, silence was better than words ... “Qingxue ...” Xia ruofei called out softly. Ling Qingxue leaned lazily on Xia ruofei’s shoulder and said,””Eh? What’s wrong?” “Nothing, I just wanted to hear your voice ...” “Pfft ... Silly!” Ling Qingxue laughed so hard that she was shaking. At this moment, she felt that all her years of persistence had been worth it. From junior high to the dramatic reunion last year, Ling Qingxue had only had Xia ruofei in her heart for ten whole years. Moreover, Ling Qingxue had always been very clear that her secret love might never come to fruition. The stories of a rich lady falling in love with a poor loser often did not have a good ending. However, she finally managed to rely on her own perseverance to hold on until the clouds parted and the moon appeared. This feeling was like exploring a dark tunnel for a very long time and suddenly a moving light appeared in front of him. Such an excited mood could really make people suddenly burst into tears. Xia ruofei was holding Ling Qingxue in his arms. He felt like he was in a dream. Perhaps everything would come naturally, but when the canal was truly formed, one would still feel as light as a feather, as if one was floating in the clouds. The two of them snuggled together and seemed to have endless topics to talk about Yingying’s past in junior high school, their respective careers, and interesting things in the Army ... From time to time, Xia ruofei would kiss Ling Qingxue’s bruised face like a Dragonfly skimming the surface of the water. Then, the two of them would look at each other and smile, filled with endless tenderness. Love seemed to be self – taught. Xia ruofei had never been in a relationship before. However, when he was with Ling Qingxue, he quickly adapted to his new role. All sorts of sweet nothings and intimate actions were very natural. Ling Qingxue’s wish was fulfilled. Her heart was like a jar of honey. No matter what Xia ruofei said, she liked it. She felt that she was willing to snuggle up to him until the end of time ... As they chatted, the two of them naturally talked about the pair of Blood Dragons. Xia ruofei gently caressed Ling Qingxue’s hair. Her hair was very soft and comfortable to the touch. He asked,”Qingxue, did you just say that our dad is a super Arowana fan?” Ling Qingxue’s face was slightly red. She lowered her eyes and said,””That’s my dad ...” “Don’t mind the details ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile.”Shouldn’t the focus be on the Blood Red Dragon? Does our dad like this pair of blood red Dragons?” “It’s my dad ...” Ling Qingxue glared at Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei laughed,”Alright, alright!” If it’s my dad ... My dad really likes this pair of blood red Dragons, right?” Ling Qingxue was speechless. She pouted and punched Xia ruofei. “You’re doing this on purpose, right? Do you think I won’t pinch you?” Actually, how could Ling Qingxue bear to use her strength? And even if Ling Qingxue used all her strength, it was no different from scratching an itch for Xia ruofei. However, Xia ruofei still begged exaggeratedly,””I was wrong, I was wrong. I’m your father. Is that okay, wife?” Ling Qingxue had just revealed a satisfied expression after listening to Xia ruofei’s words. However, when she heard the word “wife”, her face turned red again. She bit her lower lip and reached out to pinch Xia ruofei’s waist. Then, she twisted it 90 degrees ... “Ah ...” Xia ruofei howled like a pig being slaughtered. This time, it really hurt a little. “Do you still dare to be glib – tongued?” Ling Qingxue asked fiercely. “I won’t dare to anymore ...” Xia ruofei said repeatedly. Ling Qingxue finally let go of Xia ruofei and couldn’t help but burst into laughter. Xia ruofei was a little dazed by her beautiful smile. He couldn’t help but hold her face and kiss her smooth forehead. Ling Qingxue also moaned and buried her head in Xia ruofei’s arms. Her slender Jade – like hands gently rubbed Xia ruofei’s chest. After a long time, the two of them reluctantly separated and returned to the pair of blood – Red Dragons. Ling Qingxue told Xia ruofei how obsessed her father was with the Arowana and how excited he was when he saw the post on the Dragon Peak forum about the blood red Dragons. She even talked about how Ling Xiaotian had driven a few hundred kilometers just to catch a glimpse of a top – grade Arowana. After Xia ruofei heard this, he smiled and said,””Qingxue, since your father likes raising Arowana so much, why don’t we give him this pair of blood red Dragons?” “No!” Ling Qingxue said immediately. “Why?” “RUO Fei, do you know how precious these red Arowana are?” Ling Qingxue said,”the internet is speculating that your blood red Dragons are 85 centimeters long. Many professional players estimate that this pair of blood red Dragons is worth at least a few million! And I just took a look, it’s more than 85 cm! It’s at least 90 cm, right?” “More than 90 ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “That’s even more precious!” Ling Qingxue said seriously,”how can you just give away such an expensive fish?” Xia ruofei said nonchalantly,”it’s just a pair of Blood Dragons.” Even his most precious pearl has become my girlfriend. I won’t exchange it no matter how much money you give me! I’m just giving him a gift, do I need to consider its value?” Ling Qingxue was touched, and the gentleness in her eyes grew stronger. “That won’t do either,” she said.”Let’s take good care of these Blood Dragons. If it weren’t for them, we wouldn’t be together so quickly ...” Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, then he laughed.””That’s right! That pair of Red Arowana is our matchmaker! In that case, I really can’t give it away so easily ... But what should I give to my future father – in – Law?” Xia ruofei furrowed his brows as he pondered. Suddenly, his eyes lit up as he thought of a good idea ...Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m
