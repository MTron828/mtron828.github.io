Xia ruofei nodded and poured Feng Rao another cup of tea. He smiled and said,””Come, come, come, sit down and talk!”

When Feng Jing heard the news, she couldn’t help but stand up.

After the two of them sat down, Xia ruofei told Feng Rao about the one – headed abalone that was going to be auctioned this time, as well as some of the preparations that had been made.

Initially, Feng Rao was still a little uncertain, but when she heard that Hengfeng group had already sent professionals to identify the abalones and that the employees of the auction house had also come over to collect materials for the pre – Publicity, she immediately felt a lot more at ease.

Especially when Xia ruofei said that Tang He of the United States ‘shengbang group and MA Xiong of Hengfeng group had already “used the back door” to order two premium one – Head abalones from him, Feng Jing was completely relieved after hearing that. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Feng Rao thought for a moment and immediately said,”Chairman, this auction is of great significance to our company. I’ll immediately ask the marketing department to transfer the best manpower to focus on the packaging design that you requested!”

Feng Rao stood up as she spoke. Xia ruofei quickly gestured with both hands and said,””Sit down, sit down!”

Then, Xia ruofei smiled and said,”President Feng, please calm down!” I’ve already assigned this job. It’s just an exterior design, so there’s no need to involve so many people!”

“Chairman, I’m just worried that the people below won’t pay enough attention to it,” Feng Jing said. “Besides ... If the marketing department takes the lead and forms a team to do this, the final product’s quality can be guaranteed! After all, our time is rather tight ...”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”you have to believe in our colleagues in the art design team!” President Feng, Zhong Lingling and the others are all professionals in this. I’ve already made my requirements clear to them, and I believe that they will definitely do a good job!”

Feng Rao could only nod and say embarrassedly,””Chairman, I think I’m a little too nervous. This matter is too important to our company ...”

Xia ruofei smiled.”I can understand, but the quality of our products is very good. The outer packaging is like adding flowers to a brocade, so don’t be too nervous.”

“En!” Feng Rao nodded.

Feng Rao lowered her head and pondered for a moment. Then, she raised her head and said seriously,””Chairman, this auction is very important. I’ll apply to go to Hong Kong to coordinate the auction!”

“Is that necessary?” Xia ruofei asked, surprised.

Feng Jing said seriously,”I think it’s necessary. After all, it’s our company’s first time participating in an auction, and we’re cooperating with a giant company like Hengfeng. I think we should go and coordinate in advance, especially the layout of the auction venue, the procedures, and media communication. All of these need to be coordinated in advance.”

Xia ruofei knew that Feng Jing was worried that Hengfeng restaurant would bully their customers. After all, according to Feng Jing’s train of thought, the auction would definitely highlight the publicity of paradise Corporation. If Hengfeng didn’t make careful arrangements or deliberately weakened the presence of paradise Corporation, then this good opportunity would be wasted. Although the money would not be reduced by a single bit, it would not achieve the purpose of publicity.

In fact, based on Xia ruofei and MA Xiong’s personal relationship, Hengfeng auction house would definitely not do that. As long as Xia ruofei said something, they would not object even if the entire auction house was covered in the LOGO of paradise Corporation. However, there were some things that were not easy to explain to Feng Jing.

Hence, Xia ruofei said tactfully,”CEO Feng, should we ... Send someone else?” After all, there are a lot of things to do at home. After you leave ...”

“Chairman, the company is on the right track. It shouldn’t be a problem for me to leave for a few days.” Feng Jing looked at Xia ruofei and said,”besides, if there’s anything important, I can settle it remotely through email. It won’t affect my work.”

Xia ruofei saw Feng Jing’s eagerness to fight and felt that it was not good to dampen her enthusiasm. Hence, after a moment of silence, he nodded and said,””Alright! I can be more at ease with you personally overseeing things. “How about this ... I’ll contact Hengfeng. You don’t have to go too early. There will definitely be some promotional activities in the early stages. You can go a few days before the auction starts. At that time, you can bring a few assistants along so that you don’t have to do everything yourself.”

“Okay, thank you, Chairman!” Feng Jing said happily.

“Chairman,” Feng Jing continued,”why don’t you ... Give me the contact information of the Hengfeng company’s organizer? it’s best if we follow up on the pre – Publicity and promotional activities.”

Xia ruofei replied readily,”sure!” I’ll contact them first and tell you later! In the next few days, settle the work at hand and pass down the things that need to be handed over. I don’t want it to affect the company’s operation when I leave. ”

“Understood!” Feng Rao said happily.

“Chairman,” she said, standing up,”I’ll go back to my office. You should go home for dinner too!”

Xia ruofei nodded.”Okay. By the way ... Remember to ask Liu Qian to bring me the details of the two office buildings.”

“I understand, but ... There’s no rush to move the company’s headquarters!” The auction is the most important thing right now!”

After speaking, Feng Jing stood up and walked out. She stopped at the door and turned around.”Chairman, please take care of the mass production of the jaded skin cream! The pharmaceutical factory has already planned to expand the factory and introduce the production line. My idea is that after the official mass production of the heart – nourishing soup and its popularity, we can take advantage of the opportunity to launch the pure natural cosmetic, jaded skin cream. This way, we can maintain the continued popularity of the topic, which is also very helpful for the promotion of the product. ”

Xia ruofei could not help but smile bitterly. The attraction of the jaded skin cream to women could not be underestimated. She had put aside the matter of the company’s headquarters moving many times, but she still could not forget about the jaded skin cream. Even the auction, which was such an important event, could not make her forget about the jaded skin cream.

“I will, I will ...” Xia ruofei said with a bitter smile.”I’ll let you know as soon as there’s any progress ...”

“Then I’ll thank you on behalf of all the women here, Chairman!” Feng Jing said with a smile.

Feng Jing waved goodbye to Xia ruofei and left the office with a smile.

Xia ruofei heaved a sigh of relief when he heard the sound of high heels getting further and further away in the corridor. Every time they met, Feng Jing would ask him about the jaded skin cream, which made Xia ruofei a little overwhelmed. He decided to work harder for the next few days and study the problem of the mass production of jaded skin cream.

Xia ruofei looked at his watch. It was almost time to get off work. He tidied up the tea tray and desk, grabbed his handbag, and left the office. He returned to the small villa.

Hu Zi’s mother had already prepared lunch. Once Xia ruofei returned, Hu Zi’s mother called him over for lunch.

Lin Qiao had already called to say that she would have lunch in the company’s cafeteria at noon. After receiving the packaging design task, Lin Qiao was full of energy. She would definitely have to work overtime again in the afternoon.

Xia ruofei chatted with Hu’s mother as they ate. After lunch, Xia ruofei helped Hu’s mother clean up the dishes and then made tea with her. They chatted for a while.

Xia ruofei knew that what the old man needed the most was company. He had complete financial freedom now, but it was still not enough to live without worry. Recently, Lin Qiao often worked overtime in the company, and Hu Zi’s mother was lonely at home, so Xia ruofei deliberately increased the company and communication.

After chatting for a while, Hu Zi’s mother went back to her room to take a nap. Xia ruofei then tidied up the tea tray and returned to his room upstairs.

Xia ruofei was going to enter the medium to find Xia Qing to discuss the production of the jaded skin cream, but he remembered what Feng Jing said in the morning, so he took out his phone and dialed the number of MA Xiong from Hengfeng group.
