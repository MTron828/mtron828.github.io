Each work station had a corresponding indicator light. When the workers saw the indicator light turn on, they poured the raw materials they prepared into the feed port.

The entire production line began to operate under the computer’s control.

With the roar of the machine, the raw materials were sent to the high – pressure stainless steel tank by a conveyor belt, and then the distilled water began to slowly pour in.

Xia ruofei had already set the amount of water to be poured in according to the ratio.

These medicinal materials were slowly heated and stirred in the high – pressure tank. The first jaded skin cream test production had officially begun.

Xia ruofei stared at the control room, while Xue Jinshan began to patrol the various work stations of the production line.

As the indicator lights continued to light up, the workers at the various stations also carried out the corresponding operations.

Finally, the few medicinal materials that had been ground into powder were slowly added through the last feeding mouth.

The medicinal ingredients were constantly stirred in the high – pressure tank, and the water content began to slowly evaporate.

The green indicator light on the control computer that represented the completion of production flickered a few times and then lit up.

Xia ruofei stood up with a trace of excitement and went to the material outlet with Xue Jinshan.

He saw a stainless steel container containing a brown paste that was still steaming. He could smell a familiar fragrance from afar.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but speed up and walk closer to check.

He reached out and touched a little of the ointment produced by the assembly line, carefully observed its color, deeply sniffed the smell, and finally even stuck out his tongue to lick it and taste it.

Although the jaded skin cream was a cosmetic product, it was made of pure Chinese medicine. It could be said to be food – grade, and there would be no problem even if it was taken.

Xia ruofei frowned slightly. Although the jaded skin ointment looked similar to the products he made by hand and had the same fragrance, Xia ruofei could clearly feel that there were some granular substances in it, which were different from the finished jaded skin ointment.

Obviously, the product this time did not meet Xia ruofei’s expectations.

However, Xia ruofei was mentally prepared for this. The brewing process of the jaded skin ointment was rather complicated. It involved many steps. He had spent almost an entire night yesterday to complete the theoretical construction of the production process. If the first trial production could be a great success, he would definitely be lucky.

In fact, in order to achieve mass production, it was necessary to go through many experiments and constantly fine – tune the parameters to find the best effect.

Xue Jinshan saw Xia ruofei’s frown and his heart sank. He asked nervously,”President Xia, the product doesn’t meet your requirements?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’m not at my best state, but it’s okay. It’s just an experiment!” It’s impossible to not take any detours. I’ll go and make some minor adjustments to the parameters!”

After that, Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””Take a sample of this first experimental product and label it. Oh right ... Prepare a sample for me too.”

“Alright, director Xia!” Xue Jinshan quickly said, then gestured to a worker.

The worker immediately began to sample the product.

Xia ruofei turned around and walked back to the control room. He used the USB drive to copy the program that he had backed up into the control computer. The program in the computer had been sealed and could no longer be modified.

Xia ruofei had specially prepared this USB for confidential work. It was never connected to the internet. Even computers that had been connected to the internet before would not connect to it even if the network cable was unplugged.

This was all for the sake of secrecy.

Xia ruofei deleted the solidified program and opened the program that he had copied from the USB drive. He started to think about the complicated parameters and links.

After a while, Xia ruofei heard a knock on the door.

He minimized the program’s editing interface, then got up and opened the door to the control room.

Xue Jinshan was standing at the door with a wide – mouthed glass bottle in his hand.”President Xia, this is the sample you wanted!”

Xue Jinshan knew that Xia ruofei wanted to modify the production program, so he did not follow Xia ruofei to the control room. Now that Xia ruofei had opened the door, he lowered his eyes and did not even glance at the control computer in the room. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

As the factory director of the pharmaceutical factory, Xue Jinshan’s position was still very proper. He was working for Xia ruofei. He would never try to get in touch with such core secrets. He would not even think about it.

Xia ruofei took the glass bottle with a smile and said,””Alright, thank you Kanayama!”

Xia ruofei then put the glass bottle into his pocket.

“You’re too kind, President Xia. I’ll be on standby in the workshop!”Xue Jinshan said.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. By the way ... It’ll probably take a long time for me to adjust the program, so get someone to prepare some supper! It’s also very hard for the workers and Masters to work overtime!”

“Alright, director Xia!” Xue Jinshan replied, then turned around and left the control room.

Xia ruofei closed the door and sat back in front of the console.

He first sent the bottle of sample into the spirit map space and communicated with Xia Qing with his spiritual sense, asking her to check the color of the jaded skin cream produced by the assembly line.

The result was just as he had expected. After Xia Qing’s inspection, this sample could only be said to have barely been successfully brewed, but the quality was very ordinary, and could be considered a low – grade product.

Although the brewing process was considered a success and the product would have its own medicinal effects, Xia ruofei was determined to take the high – end route. Naturally, he would not allow the production to be shoddy. Hence, he took out the glass bottle with the sample from the space and began to analyze the process.

He mainly adjusted the time, temperature, volume, and other parameters according to the situation of the jaded skin ointment produced this time.

This kind of adjustment would not be done by luck. It was built on the knowledge of the entire program link and parameters. After analyzing the product, they would come up with a parameter modification plan that was most likely to affect the product quality.

Hence, Xia ruofei thought for a long time before he started to adjust five of the parameters in one go.

Then, Xia ruofei backed up the second version of the program into a USB drive and sealed the program on the computer. Then, he picked up the walkie – talkie and communicated with Xue Jinshan, who was in the workshop.

The second production test soon began.

After another hour of waiting, a batch of finished products was produced.

There were still many flaws in the product this time. Xia ruofei realized that the parameters he had adjusted did not seem to have any obvious effect.

Hence, he quickly began to analyze and make adjustments again.

Although the results were not ideal, Xia ruofei did not give up.

It was common for this kind of experiment to fail eight to ten times. Xia ruofei had enough patience to slowly grind it out.

The third production test officially began more than an hour later. When the production line completed all the procedures, it was already past 11 O’ clock at night.

The effect seemed to be good this time. The particles in the ointment were significantly reduced.

It was already very late, and the medicinal herbs prepared for the day had all been used up. Hence, after Xia ruofei asked for a sample, he let Xue Jinshan and the rest go back to rest.

He then told Liu Lin and the other veterans to pay attention to the security guards in the control room, and then drove away from the pharmaceutical factory.

On the way, Xia ruofei sent the third produced sample into the spirit map space for Xia Qing to examine.

Just as Xia ruofei had predicted, the jaded skin ointment had reached the level of a medium – grade ointment. Although it still did not achieve the effect that Xia ruofei had expected, at least it was developing in a good direction.

Xia ruofei did not feel dejected because the results of the three experiments were not ideal. On the contrary, he was full of confidence because he knew that he had found the root of the problem. All he needed was more time and more experiments to adjust and improve the parameters step by step.

He had already instructed Xue Jinshan to prepare ten more portions of medicinal ingredients according to today’s list.

Xia ruofei had already decided to spend the next few days in the factory. He would not make do with it until he had adjusted the production process of the jaded skin ointment to a near perfect state.
