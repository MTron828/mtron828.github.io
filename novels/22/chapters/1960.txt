1961 Warehouse Clearance (1)

When they first signed the agreement, it was stated that the date was from the start of the new year, which was the next truffle harvest season.

As for Xia ruofei’s batch of truffles, it was actually the ‘last bus’. The last auction was when the truffles had just been released on the market, and now was basically the season when the truffles would be released soon. They were both in the same truffles harvest cycle, so naturally, it was not within the scope of the agreement.

Old Blake smiled awkwardly and said,””Mr. Xia, I’m not blaming you for breaking the contract. Of course, your actions are completely in line with the requirements of the agreement. This is just ... Just a suggestion. However, I think that this suggestion of mine should be in line with the interests of both parties.”

Xia ruofei said lightly,”Mr. Blake, we’ve been promoting the auction for many days. Many guests have come from the United States just for our top – Quality truffles. I don’t think there’s any room for change.” So ... If Mr. Blake is interested in our truffles, you can pay more attention to them at the auction ...”

Old Blake looked disappointed. Of course, he did not have much hope before he came. Just like what Xia ruofei had said, he had already spread the word and so many rich people from all over the world were coming. How could Xia ruofei go back on his word?

Even if old Blake’s offer was higher than the estimated final price, Xia ruofei would not risk his reputation for a little money.

Therefore, old Blake came here with the hope that he would succeed, but he was already mentally prepared for it.

In fact, this was just a foreshadowing. After pretending to be pitiful for a while, old Blake finally revealed the real purpose of his visit to Xia ruofei.”Mr. Xia, I noticed that the auction brochure did not clearly state how much truffles to auction, so ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and asked,””So you want to buy some truffles from me?”

This was equivalent to the outside trading of the Securities market.

“Yes, I am!” Old Blake said,”Xia, the price I’m offering will definitely not be lower than the auction price! We can make an estimate based on the price from the last auction. If the price is higher than our estimated price after the end of this auction, our black family can make up for the difference!”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”in that case, wouldn’t it be better for Mr. Blake to compete directly in the auction?” You can still get what you want, and you can also show off the strength of your black family. It’s the best of both worlds, so why not?”

Old Blake smiled bitterly in his heart and said,””I just want to reduce the trouble! Xia, you won’t suffer any losses from this deal. You can consider it ...”

In fact, old Blake would not come to Xia ruofei’s house to talk about an advance deal just because he found it troublesome.

In fact, because of the previous successful case, after the news of this auction spread, there were more people responding than the last time. The black family’s biggest competitor in Europe, the Richard Lehmann family, was also very interested in this batch of truffles. They had mobilized a lot of funds and were ready to show their skills at the auction.

The Lyman family and the black family were both truffle families in Europe. The two families belonged to different traditional truffle – producing areas and were competitors to each other.

According to Blake’s judgment, the truffles that were put up for auction this time would definitely be of the same quality as the last one.

This way, there would definitely be a fierce battle at the auction.

Moreover, old Blake and the Lyman family’s representative, glofen Lyman, were already old enemies. He was worried that glofen would bid maliciously at the auction and spend some money to embarrass old Blake. Glofen was happy to do that.

At that time, he might not be able to buy truffles and would have to spend a lot of money.

Although he had promised that he would not sell them at a lower price than the average price, the black family wouldn’t be able to bid so much at the auction as long as they had this batch of truffles. As a result, the final price would probably be much lower.

In this way, the black family would definitely not suffer a loss.

Unfortunately, old Blake had a good plan. Xia ruofei was no longer a greenhorn. He thought for a while and understood the crux of the matter. Although he did not know about the Lyman family, he could quickly determine that the auction price would drop because the Blake family had withdrawn from the competition.

Besides, Xia ruofei had no intention of selling the truffles in private. The reason why he was here was to boost the reputation of the Paradise Corporation. Naturally, the more good things that appeared in the auction, the better.

Hence, Xia ruofei immediately smiled and said,””Mr. Blake, although I really want to help you, I can’t ... Although the brochure doesn’t state the number of truffles, the agreement we signed with Hengfeng auction house clearly States the specifications and quantity of the auction items. I can’t break the spirit of the contract just to help you!”

In fact, the peach blossom company and Hengfeng group had not signed any agreement at all. Neither did they need to sign an agreement. This was just a shield that Xia ruofei used to reject old Blake.

Besides, this shield was invulnerable. Old Blake had no way to persuade Xia ruofei anymore. Let’s not talk about who would bear the losses if they broke the contract. Don’t you Westerners value the spirit of the contract the most? You can’t possibly instigate me to go back on my word!

Sure enough, old Blake’s face was bitter. He knew that he would return without success this time.

Old Blake thought to himself,”looks like it’s impossible to take a shortcut ... I’ll have to fight with that old man glofen in the auction!”

Old Blake had a headache when he thought about this.

Unexpectedly, Xia ruofei suddenly said,”Mr. Blake, if you are interested, we still have some truffles left for this season. We can trade them all to you after the auction.”

Old Blake said as if he had heard the sound of nature, “I’m interested! Of course I’m interested! Xia, how many truffles do you have? the black family will take them all!” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Although it was the new year of truffles this year, the supply of such high – end ingredients was always in short supply. Especially with the intervention of the top – grade truffles from paradise Corporation, it had produced a similar catfish effect. In order to maintain a market share, they had to open up as many channels as possible. It was definitely not enough to rely on the truffles produced by the family’s own truffle production area, because competitors would buy truffles through auctions.

Besides, the truffles in Xia ruofei’s shop were all big and top – grade truffles. If their competitors bought too many, it would have a huge impact on the market.

If Xia ruofei was willing to sell the rest of the truffles to the black family, they would have nothing to worry about at the auction. They could even deliberately raise the price to stop the Lehmann family.

There were simply too many benefits to this.

Xia ruofei said,”Mr. Blake, I’ll be blunt. The truffles that weren’t put up for auction are definitely not as good as the ones that appeared in the auction in terms of weight and size.”

This time, Xia ruofei had harvested all the truffles that were produced this season. For this, he had even brought Blacky and the rest into the medium. Several dogs were working together. Now, Blacky and the others ‘sense of smell was many times more sensitive than that of ordinary dogs. It could be said that they did not leave any blind spots.

Naturally, the truffles would be auctioned off for the sake of the company’s reputation. It was the name card of the company! Xia ruofei kept all the smaller ones in the medium.

He didn’t like truffles, and he didn’t need that much to treat his guests. So when he saw old Blake, he decided to sell all the truffles to the Blake family.

“It doesn’t matter! It’s fine!” Old Blake said.

He knew that this was inevitable, and he was mentally prepared for it.

“As for the price, it has to be 80% of the actual auction price.” Xia ruofei raised another condition.

Old Blake hesitated for a moment. The auction price would usually be higher than the market price, especially for the truffle of the highest quality, which was in short supply. Xia ruofei must have provided the Super truffle with a very heavy single unit. The market price could not be used to measure the price of such a high quality truffle. It could be sold for a sky – High price in the auction.

Old Blake was not confident if they were to sell the truffles at the average price of the auction, even with a 20% discount. After all, he knew that Xia ruofei would only sell him some small truffles after the auction, and the actual value would be greatly reduced.

Xia ruofei did not rush old Blake after he had stated his conditions. He just smiled and waited for old Blake’s answer.

He was only doing this business in passing. It would be good if he could make more money, but Xia ruofei did not care if he could not do this business. He had already passed the stage of being extremely short of money, and the company did not need money urgently for the time being.

Old Blake didn’t dare to hesitate for too long. He asked,”Mr. Xia, if you don’t mind me asking, the quality of the truffles you’re going to trade with us ...”

“It’s the same place of origin as the truffles in the auction, and the quality is roughly the same.” Xia ruofei said directly,”the only difference should be that the weight of a single object is smaller.”

“How many of these truffles can your side provide?” old Blake asked again.

Xia ruofei did some calculations and said,””At least 50 kilograms!”

Old Blake didn’t hesitate anymore and said,””We want this batch of truffles!”

Good truffles were usually sold by the gram. Xia ruofei had provided 50 kilograms in one go. This was already half of the annual supply that the Blake family and the Paradise Corporation had agreed on. The last time, the two parties had agreed that it would be no less than 100 kilograms a year.

Little did he know that unlike The Truffle Hunters in the traditional truffle – producing areas who would only find a truffle after searching for a long time in the oak Forest, there was a large amount of truffle under every oak tree in Xia ruofei’s spirit map. It was like sweet potatoes growing near the roots of the oak trees.

This was under the condition that Xia ruofei did not deliberately expand the scale. Otherwise, it would not be difficult to produce tons of truffles every year.

In that case, it would really have a fatal impact on the truffle market.

The world only produced about 35 tons of black truffle in a year, and white truffle was even rarer. The world only produced about three tons a year.

“OK!”Xia ruofei said,”a deposit of one million euros. Is that a problem?”
