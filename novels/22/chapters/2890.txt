2891 You don’t understand the world of geniuses (2)

In fact, Xia ruofei was not just showing off. Luo Qingfeng was also very envious of Xia ruofei when he saw that he could control the flying sword to complete so many incredible movements.

The reason was very simple. Sword Kinesis flight was the most commonly used skill for cultivators at the Golden core stage and above. Even in battles between cultivators above the Golden core stage, they often directly stepped on the flying sword to fight in the sky. At this time, whoever had the more precise control of the flying sword and the more incredible flight trajectory would naturally be able to seize the first opportunity in the battle.

Therefore, these stunts were actually very useful.

Just as Luo Qingfeng was shocked by the speed of Xia ruofei’s sword control technique, Xia ruofei finally ended his ‘test flight’. He controlled the flying sword and it streaked across the sky like a shooting star. When it reached the edge of the cliff, the flying sword suddenly stopped. It went from a very fast speed to a standstill without any buffer. However, Xia ruofei still stood firmly on the flying sword and was not affected at all.

Xia ruofei jumped down from the flying sword and kept the blue travel immortal sword in his dantian to continue nourishing it. He said to Luo Qingfeng with a smile,””Qingfeng, what are you doing here? Didn’t I tell you to recover as soon as possible?”

Luo Qingfeng quickly said with shame,””Master, this old servant was frightened by you. If I had known that you were so talented in sword control, I wouldn’t have reminded you ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it’s my first time flying too. I’m still not familiar with some parts. It’s not as good as you say. ”

Luo Qingfeng was speechless. ‘You’re so good at this, yet you’re still not skilled enough?’ How heaven – defying would you be when you’re proficient in it? Do you still want me to live?

Xia ruofei continued,”it’s my first time riding a flying sword. I’m a little high. I’ve also used up a lot of vital energy just now. Let’s recover together!” After you’ve adjusted your condition, we’ll set off immediately!”

Li Yifu had already sent him the address and location of the person Xia ruofei had contacted with the Hong sect in Mexico. Xia ruofei only needed to rush over as soon as possible and bring back the firearms.

“Yes! Master!” “Yes!” Luo Qingfeng quickly responded.

The master and servant sat cross – legged near the core of the formation and absorbed the spiritual energy in the Taixu xuanqing formation to recover.

Xia ruofei did not use any origin crystals either. On one hand, he was not in a hurry. The concentration of spiritual energy in the Taixu xuanqing formation was not too bad. He just needed to spend a little more time. On the other hand, it was also because sword Kinesis flight didn’t consume too much vital Qi. He didn’t lose much vital Qi in his dantian, so there was no need to use origin crystals to recover it.

In fact, Xia ruofei did not know that different sword – controlling techniques would consume different amounts of energy. He and Luo Qingfeng controlled their flying swords at the same time. For the same distance, Luo Qingfeng’s energy consumption would definitely be much greater than his.

The technique Xia ruofei used to control the sword was a set of the “great Dao technique”, especially the vital QI Network. There were actually many clever ideas, and ordinary sword techniques could not compare to it.

The difference in cultivation techniques was all – Round. In fact, Xia ruofei was not particularly talented. It was just that he cultivated the “great Dao Sutra”, which Luo Qingfeng could not catch up with no matter how hard he tried. Even if he was more talented than Xia ruofei, the result would be the same. In the end, he would be left far behind by Xia ruofei.

Similarly, Xia ruofei was regulating his breathing and recovering. He quickly replenished the vital Qi that he had just expended, while Luo Qingfeng was still meditating. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei did not disturb him. Instead, he took out his phone and studied the flight route.

Flying on a sword was different from flying on a plane, where one had to strictly follow the route. Basically, flying on a sword would allow one to fly as close as possible. After all, the sky was so big, and there wouldn’t be tens of thousands of cultivators flying in the sky at any time.

Peach source Island was located in the South Pacific Ocean, so the fastest route to Mexico was naturally to fly northeast. Although they had passed by the ocean, it did not affect cultivators like Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng at all.

The handover address provided by Li Yifu was kuachakus port, located in the southwest part of Mexico. This was one of the main ports in southern Mexico. The shipping company operated by the Hong sect had a large warehouse near the port of kuachakus. The batch of arms had been transferred and stored in the warehouse of the shipping company.

Xia ruofei retrieved the location information from his phone and entered it into the map app. The GPS module was now standard on mobile phones, so it could search for satellite signals even in the air. Of course, Xia ruofei would not use the map software to navigate all the way there. He only needed to fly in the direction of Mexico and it would not be too late to navigate when he reached kuachakurakos.

After a while, Luo Qingfeng finally finished regulating his breathing. He opened his eyes and saw Xia ruofei looking at his phone in boredom. He quickly stood up and said in embarrassment,””Master, this old servant has already adjusted my breathing.”

Luo Qingfeng knew that he must have been a burden. Xia ruofei had already recovered.

Xia ruofei smiled, stood up and said,””Then let’s go! Wherever they flew, they would stop and rest when they were tired. This time, there was no rush! Don’t force yourself, if you don’t have enough Yuan Qi, you have to tell me!”

“Yes! Master!” Luo Qingfeng said.

Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng summoned their flying swords. Soon, two sword lights flew out of the Peach Blossom Island and into the sky above the sea. Then, they drew an arc and flew toward the northeast of the island.

The two of them were flying at an altitude of two to three thousand meters. It was much colder at high altitude than on the ground, but it had no effect on cultivators. The wind from the high altitude during the flight was also blocked by the protective barrier formed by Yuan Qi. The two of them stepped on flying swords and flew two thousand meters in the air. They were like Immortals.

It was Xia ruofei’s first time flying at such a high altitude. In the past, he had taken planes many times and flew at much higher altitudes than this. However, he still found it novel to fly at such heights without any means of transportation.

Not to mention anything else, this kind of flying method was simply invincible in the field of vision. There was no 360 – degree panoramic view and no dead angle! No matter how good the viewing angle of the plane was, it was impossible to see such a scenery.

The blue sky and white clouds were overhead, and there were some lower clouds under his feet. There was also a deep blue sea that stretched as far as the eye could see. The scenery was very magnificent.

The reason why Xia ruofei had called Luo Qingfeng along was that he did not know if he could master the technique of sword Kinesis flight in a short period of time. On the other hand, he did not want to be too bored on the road. He could find Luo Qingfeng to learn more about the cultivation world on earth and some knowledge about the Golden core stage.

As the two of them flew at high speed, they communicated via Yuan Qi voice transmission.

After chatting for a while, Xia ruofei thought of the auction that they had talked about last time. He asked,””By the way, Qingfeng, you said that there would be an auction for cultivators on peach source Island in the near future. What’s the situation now?”

“Master,” Luo Qingfeng quickly said,”I’ve already confirmed the auction’s location. It’s now confirmed that the auction will be held in Shuangqing city. Our star Seizer sect has also received an invitation letter. At most three people can go. The auction is on the 5th of next month, so there’s still ten days left. ”

Xia ruofei nodded.”You said that a storage ring might appear at the auction. Is that accurate?” he asked.

Luo Qingfeng said,”master, this auction is held once a year, and it has been held dozens of times. The rules are similar every time. In order to maintain a sense of mystery, the specific items to be auctioned will only be revealed on the day of the auction. However, some news will leak out every year, but it is difficult to tell whether the news is true or false.” This time, a friend of this old servant told me about the storage ring. Although I trust him, this old servant is not completely confident, so I don’t dare to make any guarantees with master ...”
