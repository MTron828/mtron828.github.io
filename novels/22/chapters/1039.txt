Only then did Feng Rao recover slightly from her excited state. Xue Jinshan quickly stepped forward and said,”President Xia, President Feng, the reception room is ready!”

“Then let’s go!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

The three of them came to the administrative building not far from the production workshop.

The reception room on the second floor was ready. The air conditioner had been turned on in advance, and seasonal fruits, tea, and drinks were placed on the side table. There were also several female employees guarding the venue.

After Xia ruofei sat down, he smiled at Xue Jinshan and said,””Jinshan, let these employees go back! We’re family, there’s no need to be so Grand ...”

Xue Jinshan nodded and motioned for the female employees to leave.

After seeing the employees close the door of the meeting room, Xia ruofei told Feng Jing about the trial production this week.

The more Feng Jing listened, the more excited she became. She had thought that Xia ruofei had only overcome some bottlenecks in the mass production process and could achieve initial automation in the production process. In fact, it was already amazing that he could achieve this in such a short time.

What Feng Jing did not expect was that Xia ruofei had done far more than she had expected.

Not only had they achieved stable mass production, but they had also developed a variety of products and grades.

It could be said that Xia ruofei had completed all the R & D work by himself. The jaded skin cream’s product line was already very complete. The next step was almost the work of the marketing department.

The marketing department had to design the waves and frequencies of these products, study the pricing strategies and sales models of different grades of products, and tailor – make different advertisements for each category.

After hearing Xia ruofei’s introduction, Feng Jing was dumbfounded. After a while, she said,””Chairman, you ... How did you do it? A complete product line was developed in seven days? Oh my God ...”

Normally, even an experienced research team would need months or even years to develop a mature product.

Even if Xia ruofei was the owner of the secret recipe of the jaded skin cream, it was not something that could be done overnight to develop such a complete product series.

Not to mention that it had already achieved mass production?

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”boss Feng, how many times have you given instructions?” How would I dare to slack off? He must be working overtime! I ... I used too much force all of a sudden ...”

Xue Jinshan couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

However, he was quite impressed with Xia ruofei because he had accompanied him throughout the seven days. He knew very well how much work Xia ruofei had done in those seven days.

Xia ruofei was so engrossed in his work that he almost forgot himself, which made Xue Jinshan speechless.

Adjusting the analysis parameters and data, experimenting again and again was very boring. Xue Jinshan was very clear that after seven days of continuous work, an ordinary person would not be able to stand it. However, Xia ruofei was as if nothing had happened.

Success was not by chance! Xue Jinshan couldn’t help but think.

Feng Rao could not help but look at Xia ruofei and said,””How would I dare to instruct you, the chairman? It’s more like you’re giving me instructions ...”

Xue Jinshan’s eyes almost fell out of their sockets. Ever since he had joined the company, Feng Jing had given him the impression that she was a capable and capable woman. Even when she was assigning tasks, she spoke very quickly and was almost unsmiling. He did not expect to see her acting like a little girl in front of Xia ruofei twice in a row.

Xue Jinshan couldn’t help but cast a meaningful look at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei and Feng Jing didn’t realize what was wrong. As they got closer to Yingluo, Feng Jing became more and more real in front of Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei had gotten used to her coquettish tone.

Xia ruofei laughed.”If it weren’t for your constant inquiries about the jaded skin cream, I wouldn’t have had the determination to tackle the technical challenges!”

Feng Rao couldn’t help but roll her eyes at Xia ruofei. “You’re still talking! This company is yours, okay? As a boss, you’re not even as dedicated to the company as a part – time girl like me. Really ...”

“Hey! You’re the company’s general manager! You’ll get a year – end bonus!” Xia ruofei said,”shouldn’t we have a little more sense of ownership?” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Then you’re still the boss of the company!” Feng Rao immediately said.

Xue Jinshan saw that the tone of the two people was becoming more and more flirtatious. He couldn’t help but feel uneasy. He cleared his throat and said with a dry smile,”President Xia, President Feng, why don’t I ... Leave for a while?”

Only then did Feng Rao realize that something was wrong. She glared at Xue Jinshan and said,”Why are you avoiding me? There’s nothing between the chairman and me that’s shameful ...”

Xue Jinshan couldn’t help but chuckle.

Xia ruofei coughed and changed the topic.””Jinshan, you’ll have to work harder these days. You can’t relax on the coordination of the clinical trials. You also have to hurry up with the daily production tasks in the factory. At the same time, you also have to prepare the materials and get the sales approval for the jaded skin cream as soon as possible!”

“Yes!” Xue Jinshan immediately replied with a serious expression. President Xia, I’ll immediately organize people to sort out and summarize the relevant materials. In addition, I’ll also go to the drug Administration to understand the situation in advance. The approval of the cosmetics should be relatively easy!”

Xia ruofei nodded.”You’ll be fully in charge of this. If you have any difficulties, you can look for President Feng!”

“Chairman, are you going to be a hands – off boss again?” Feng Jing couldn’t help but ask.
