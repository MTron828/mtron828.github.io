Chapter 1038: Chapter 662 – surprised and happy (1)

Translator: 549690339

Feng Jing rubbed her sleepy eyes and answered the call.””Chairman ...”

Xia ruofei heard the fatigue in Feng Jing’s voice and quickly asked,””Boss Feng, what’s wrong? Are you not feeling well?”

Feng Rao felt Xia ruofei’s concern and her heart warmed. She yawned and said,””It’s fine. I’m just a little tired from video calling Hong Kong two days ago.”

“Don’t work too hard!” Xia ruofei frowned and said,”your body is your own. You must know how to cherish it!”

Feng Rao smiled and said,”I know!” Chairman, you’re calling so early in the morning. Do you have any instructions?”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”I had something to do, but ... You should rest first!” We’ll talk about it later!”

“Don ‘t!” Feng Rao sat up from the bed and said. She was already awake, so she couldn’t fall asleep even if she lay down! Besides, I’m going to Hong Kong this afternoon, so you can tell me now if you have anything to say!”

Xia ruofei didn’t expect Feng Jing, who had always worked overtime and was never late or left early, to give him half a day off today. Furthermore, he had to call her at this time and disturb her sleep, so he couldn’t help but feel a little embarrassed.

“Boss Feng, since you’re already up, why don’t you accompany me to the pharmaceutical factory this morning?” he laughed dryly.

“A pharmaceutical factory?” Feng Jing was a little confused.”Chairman, did something happen at the pharmaceutical factory?”

When Xia ruofei was researching the production of the jaded skin cream, he specifically instructed Xue Jinshan and the others not to reveal it to Feng Jing in advance. He wanted to give Feng Jing a surprise.

On the other hand, the work at the pharmaceutical factory was usually done step by step, and Xue Jinshan managed it well, so Feng Jing rarely asked about it. She only read the daily reports.

Hence, Feng Rao did not know that Xia ruofei had already solved the problem of mass production of jaded skin ointment with Xue Jinshan and the rest.

Although Xia ruofei left early and returned late this week and almost never went to the office, he was used to being lazy. Feng Jing didn’t feel that there was anything wrong with it. If Xia ruofei went to the office every day, she would feel that it was a little abnormal.

Xia ruofei said mysteriously,”you’ll know when you get there!” Boss Feng, I’ll be waiting for you at the company complex in an hour!”

Xia ruofei hung up the phone with a smile.

He mainly considered the fact that Feng Jing was a girl, so it would take more time for her to get out of bed, wash up, and dress up than men. Also, there was a test birth in the morning, so an hour or so was enough time. There was no need to rush.

When Feng Jing heard the busy tone from the phone, she couldn’t help but reveal a coquettish expression. She muttered to herself,””You still kept me in suspense ...”

However, she still got out of bed quickly and went to the bathroom to wash up in her loose pajamas.

After Xia ruofei finished the call, he went to his room and turned on his computer to surf the internet.

He was pleased to find that many local media had also noticed the reports about the one – headed abalone auction in Hong Kong and had reposted them.

Especially the media in the southeast province, because of the peach blossom company, they paid a lot of attention to this matter.

Many local media outlets in San Shan had also taken pictures of the Hong Kong media reports and even made some additional reading content, mainly introducing the situation of the Paradise company, the recently popular paradise vegetables, the previously very popular Paradise Fruit, and the iron – Skin maples, etc.

Xia ruofei’s interest was piqued. He couldn’t help but browse the local forums.

Sure enough, there were more discussion posts about the Paradise Corporation than usual.

Obviously, the auction had not started yet, but the effect that Xia ruofei and Feng Jing wanted to see was already starting to show.

Xia ruofei was browsing the web with a smile on his face. Suddenly, the phone on the computer table vibrated.

“Chairman, I can leave now!” Xia ruofei picked up the call and heard Feng Jing’s voice.

Xia ruofei raised his hand and looked at his watch. Less than half an hour had passed, and he couldn’t help but feel surprised.

He smiled and said,”I didn’t expect you to be so fast!” That’s great ... Wait for me downstairs, I’ll drive over!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

With that, Xia ruofei turned off his computer and got up to change his clothes. Then, he took out his phone and dialed Xue Jinshan’s number as he went downstairs.

After the call went through, Xia ruofei said,””We’ll be leaving soon. Are you ready?”

Xue Jinshan’s voice came from the phone,””Don’t worry, President Xia, everything is ready!”

“Alright! I’ll see you later!” Xia ruofei said.

He drove the Knight XV SUV to the complex, picked up Feng Jing, and drove out of the farm.

On the way to the pharmaceutical factory, Feng Rao could not hold back her curiosity and asked Xia ruofei why he was there.

However, Xia ruofei kept smiling and did not answer. Feng Jing was so angry that she rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei. However, the anticipation in her heart grew stronger.

After arriving at the factory, Xia ruofei drove straight to the production workshop.

Xue Jinshan was already waiting outside the workshop with a few skilled workers. As for the Veterans, they were all at their posts. The central control room was the most important place. Xia ruofei had specifically instructed them to be there 24 hours a day.

“President Xia, President Feng!” Xue Jinshan chuckled as he came forward and said,”welcome to the pharmaceutical factory to guide our work!”
