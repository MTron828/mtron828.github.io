Hearing this, Hou Liang and Xu Zixuan looked at each other and smiled. Then, Hou Liang said,”I haven’t had the time to ask RUO Fei! However, we understand the general situation, so it’s better for ruofei to tell us himself!”

Xia ruofei put down his glass and smiled.””Hehe, recently, the Jade skin cream of the Paradise Corporation has been selling very well, and even evil people have started to appear! I heard that these three hotheaded young men came from the capital and have set their eyes on my company ... The moment they met, they offered a million Yuan in exchange for 51% of my company’s shares ...”

Zhao Yongjun slammed his cup on the table and said,””He’s rebelling! Did water enter these grandsons ‘brains? He even dared to covet ruofei’s company! Liangzi, what’s their background?”

“I don’t know,” Hou Liang said with a smile.”But the one leading is a Deputy Director of the state – owned Resources Administration. I heard that his father is a Secretary or a director of the housing construction department?” Wei Jun, you should know, right?”

Wei Jun nodded and said,”his name is Tian Xiaojun. His father is a Secretary with real power in the Ministry of Housing and Construction. I’ve met the other two a few times. One is called Zhong Zixin and the other is called Xia Ling. Their family situation is similar to Tian Xiaojun ‘S. I don’t know much about the details.”

Zhao Yongjun couldn’t help but sneer,””Damn ... With such little power, he dares to come and take over ruofei’s company? I don’t think they’re out of their minds, they’re out of their minds!”

“Brother Zhao, I’m eating!” Song Rui shouted in dissatisfaction. Can’t you consider my feelings when you speak?”

The crowd burst into laughter. Xia ruofei also laughed and said,”Song Rui, eat slowly. Don’t lose your appetite when the good food is served ...”

Song Rui chewed on the authentic spinach and said,””Don’t worry! My stomach might be full!”

“Ruofei,” Zhao Yongjun continued,”you guys eat first. I’ll go out and teach them a lesson!”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”no, no, no!” I’m a refined man, I won’t use force! Besides ... It’s such a cold day, it’s good to let them stay outside for a while to refresh their minds!”

Zhao Yongjun was stunned for a moment, then he smiled and said,””You’re right ... Then let them wait! After we’ve had our fill, we’ll settle this!”

“That’s the way! Only beautiful women and delicious food can not be disappointed!” Song Rui said as he ate,”there are beautiful women and delicious food today. Why are you talking about those disappointing things? Just let the trash wait outside for now ...” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei smiled.”Young master Song, I’ve recorded what you just said. Do you want to send it to Zhuo Yiyi?”

Song Rui suddenly stopped chewing. He squeezed out a smile and said,””Ruofei, you don’t have to be so cruel, right?”

Before Xia ruofei could say anything, Song Wei smiled and said,””I think it’s necessary ... Should I tell Yiyi? I have to be responsible for my best friend!”

Song Rui quickly begged for mercy after hearing this, indicating that he would not dare to speak nonsense again.

After everyone laughed and joked around, the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup came up very quickly.

This was specially made from small jars, one for each person, so that they didn’t have to worry about others snatching food from them. At the same time, it was very hygienic.

The mouth of the jar was tightly wrapped in lotus leaves, so everyone didn’t feel anything at first.

Xia ruofei, Ling Qingxue, and Song Wei, who had tasted the secret Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup, also smiled at everyone but did not say anything.

After the waiter unsealed the Lotus leaves one by one, a strong fragrance immediately filled the room.

It was the strong aroma of abalone, pig trotters, eye fish, and dozens of other precious ingredients mixed together. After being refined by Xia ruofei’s exclusive prescription, the aroma was even more alluring.

Zhao Yong Jun and the others were eating and chatting, but when they smelled the fragrance, they stopped and focused on the jar of Buddha Jumps Over the Wall in front of them.

Xia ruofei picked up his chopsticks and said with a smile,””The first main dish I said is here! “This is the authentic secret Buddha Jumps Over the Wall that I have personally improved. There are at least dozens of hotels in the entire Sanshan city that can make this dish, but I dare to say that there is only one restaurant that can make this taste! Everyone, quickly try it!”

“Ling Ji’s private kitchen ‘s’ Buddha Jumps Over the Wall ‘is already very famous. If you want to eat this dish, you have to make a reservation a month in advance!” Song Wei added with a smile.

“No way! “So powerful ...” Hou Liang couldn’t help but be speechless.

Song Rui was a typical foodie. Just as everyone was exclaiming in surprise, he had already reached out his chopsticks to the small jar.

He picked up a piece of abalone and immediately put it in his mouth and chewed without hesitation.

The seal of the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ was very good. Before opening the jar, not only did it keep the fragrance inside, but it was also very difficult for the heat to spread out. Therefore, this piece of abalone was very hot.

Song Rui hissed at first, but then he couldn’t help but want to eat more, so he bit hard against the heat and let the abalone roll in his mouth, trying to reduce the time it touched his tongue.

He awkwardly ate the abalone, then immediately grabbed his drink cup and took a big gulp of juice before saying,””It’s so delicious! This taste is simply amazing!”

Seeing song Rui’s exaggerated performance, everyone became even more interested in the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’. Without Xia ruofei’s order, they all started to taste it.
