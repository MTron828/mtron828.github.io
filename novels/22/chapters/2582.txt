2583 An excellent start (3)

Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to hypnotize song Qiming. For an ordinary person like song Qiming, he was hypnotized by Xia ruofei almost immediately.

Of course, Xia ruofei only did this to help song Qiming enter a state of total oblivion. After all, song Qiming was an ordinary person with no cultivation experience. It was difficult for him to throw all the distracting thoughts out of his mind and fully immerse himself in cultivation.

At the same time, song Qiming would be more sensitive to the spiritual Qi around him when he was hypnotized.

As expected, with Xia ruofei’s guidance, song Qiming soon mumbled,””I can feel them ...”

Xia ruofei was slightly happy. He thought to himself,”it’s indeed a body that has been transformed by the heart concentrating grass!” His affinity to spirit Qi was really good!

To be able to sense the presence of spirit Qi in such a short time, this was definitely an excellent start!

Xia ruofei continued to use his mind power to bewitch her.””Very good ... Now try to use your heart to touch them. With your kindness, slowly ... Slowly ...”

Under Xia ruofei’s constant guidance, song Qiming seemed to have gradually found the feeling.

Soon, Xia ruofei felt the spiritual Qi around him moving slowly. Obviously, song Qiming was able to establish a preliminary connection with the spiritual Qi.

Xia ruofei was not in a hurry. He continued to guide song Qiming to feel and touch the spiritual Qi. He did not try to guide the spiritual Qi into his body immediately.

After about an hour, Xia ruofei retracted his mental strength without a trace. Song Qiming also gradually withdrew from the state of hypnosis, but he did not notice it at all.

“Uncle song, how do you feel?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“It’s amazing ...” Song Qiming said excitedly,”I seem to feel that there are very active nutrients in the air, and I feel hungry. I really want to absorb those nutrients. This is amazing!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”this means that my judgment was not wrong!” You are indeed very suitable for this set of health – Maintenance techniques! In fact, these wandering nutrients are what your body needs very much. The reason why you feel hungry is that your body has sent out a signal that you need these nutrients to replenish yourself. ”

Song Qiming was convinced. He nodded and said,””RUO Fei, this set of spirit – nurturing techniques of yours is very impressive! But ... Why didn’t you let me try to absorb the nutrients?”

“You can’t rush things. You need to familiarize yourself with this feeling first, and then try to absorb it step by step!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”uncle song, let’s rest for 10 minutes before we try to absorb the nutrients.” When the time comes, I’ll teach you how to guide these nutrients through a specific route to nourish your body!”

This step was the most important! The cultivation of any cultivation technique was to absorb spiritual energy. The difference lay in the choice of the meridian routes, and the advantages and disadvantages of the cultivation technique were also produced by the different choices.

Next, Xia ruofei’s most important task was to let song Qiming remember the meridian circulation route of the first level of the “if modest Sutra” and to absorb the spiritual energy into his body with great familiarity. Then, he would store the spiritual energy in his dantian according to the meridian circulation route.

As long as he could do this, Xia ruofei’s plan would be half successful.
