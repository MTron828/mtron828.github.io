    "Brother Liang, the 70 - centimeter - tall Phoebe zhennan that you mentioned on the phone earlier, is it the wood that has been cut down, or is it a whole tree that is still alive?" Xia ruofei asked.

  Liang Qichao smiled and said,"brother, strictly speaking, a living Jinan is just nanmu wood. The golden threads in the Jinan are the crystals formed by the core of high - Quality nanmu after natural oxidation for more than a hundred years. This is what we usually call old material. We're looking for old material for the old man's longevity material, so we must have old material.

  However, the Phoebe zhennan that my friend found really wasn't cut down. He found it by chance, so he called me to ask if I'm interested in it. "

  Xia ruofei smiled and said,"I didn't expect this Phoebe zhennan to be so particular about it!"

  "Isn't that so?" Liang Qichao said,"I've been looking for wood for the old man these days. That's why I've been learning about this."

  Then he continued to introduce,"in fact, after cutting down the Phoebe zhennan wood and leaving it on the mountain for more than three years, it can be formed into a very good old Phoebe zhennan material after natural weathering and drying to remove the edge material and wood properties. Unfortunately, even this kind of old material is very difficult to find because we want a whole one - meter or more tree!"

  Three years of natural weathering? Xia ruofei's expression changed. Then, he asked calmly,""Brother Liang, the growth of the Phoebe zhennan should be very slow, right?"

  "That's for sure! Why else would it be so rare?" Liang Qichao said,"it will take at least 50 to 60 years for the core to start growing, and the core growth process still needs another 50 to 100 years. Only when the core reaches 95% of the entire trunk will its material be in its best state."

  Then, Liang Qichao smiled and said,""So, although the aureum can easily be sold for millions or tens of millions, it's impossible to make a fortune by planting it. After all the hard work, at least the great - grandchildren can enjoy the good fortune."

  Xia ruofei also laughed, but his mind began to wander. It was extremely difficult to succeed in the outside world, but with the spirit map space, it did not seem as difficult as he had imagined.

  Xia ruofei thought for a while and asked,"brother Liang, do you have any way to help me find some new material on the Phoebe zhennan?" It doesn't need to be very big, it's best if it's a core that has just been cut down, I want to get one for fun. "

  "That's not a big problem. You can buy it on the market. I've been looking for some old Phoebe zhennan materials recently, and I've made quite a few friends in this area. " Liang Qichao smiled and said,"how about this? I'll get someone to handle it later, and I'll get manager li to bring it to you tomorrow. Isn't he going to help you decide how to plan that piece of land?"

  "Alright! Thank you, brother Liang!" Xia ruofei said,"it doesn't have to be too big ... The size of a palm is enough. I just bought it for fun! I'll send you the money directly when the time comes. "

  Liang Qichao replied readily,"this small piece of new material isn't worth much!" At most, it'll be a thousand Yuan. Just take it as a gift from me! I haven't even thanked you properly for helping me find such a good white - skinned lunar realm!"

  Xia ruofei didn't insist because it really wasn't much money.

  After chatting with Liang Qichao for a while at the immortal meat stall, Xia ruofei left.

  He had originally wanted to look for Ling Qingxue. Since the company had already been registered, he could now sign an official agreement with lingji F & B.

  However, when he thought of the sudden kiss that day, Xia ruofei still felt a little awkward. He thought about it and decided to forget about it. He planned to wait a few days.

  After returning to the holiday villa, Xia ruofei entered the spirit map space to take a look.

  The boundless space was filled with a thriving scene. The vegetables and fruits were full of vitality. The baby fish in the pond had already grown to the length of two fingers. The red Arowana had also grown a lot. Its scales had started to show a beautiful red color. Xia ruofei believed that it would not be long before he would be able to harvest a red and precious Red Arowana.

  ……

  The next morning, Xia ruofei had just finished delivering the day's vegetables to Xi jiangyue and Ling Ji when he was welcomed by manager li, who was sent by Liang Qichao to help him with the farm planning.

  Manager li was in his early 30s and had a thin figure. He wore a pair of glasses and looked refined. However, his skin was a little dark, perhaps because he had been working at the construction site all year round.

  As soon as they met, manager li shook Xia ruofei's hand enthusiastically. At the same time, he gave Xia ruofei the new material of Phoebe zhennan that Liang Qichao had gotten yesterday.

  Xia ruofei only wanted a small piece, but Liang Qichao's piece was not only the size of a palm, but the size of a small basin.

  After Xia ruofei expressed his gratitude, he moved the new Phoebe zhennan material into the villa. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

  In fact, after leaving manager Li's sight, he had put the Phoebe zhennan into the spirit map space.

  Then, Xia ruofei showed manager li the map of the land area in the contract for a while and then brought him to the site for inspection.

  As they walked, Xia ruofei shared his thoughts with manager li.""The flat land in front is designed for vegetable greenhouses, and a piece of land over there is reserved for cold storage in the future; Also, I'm planning to use the abandoned pond in front of us again, so we might need to clear the silt and renovate it. The mountains behind were prepared to plant fruit trees in the future, so they had to trim them together this time. Also, consider the roads in the park!"

  Manager li nodded as he listened, and at the same time, he quickly jotted down notes in his notebook.

  Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,"by the way, manager li, we need to design a unified irrigation system for the entire vegetable base. It will include greenhouses and orchards. Then, we will set the water tower on the top of the back hill." There's a river behind the mountain. We just need to use a few water pumps to transfer the water up. "

  "Alright, I'll remember this!" Manager li nodded and then asked,"Mr. Xia, do you have any other requests?"

  Xia ruofei pondered for a moment."Also, we need to build a fence around the farm. Make it higher and have a security system. I'll give you a list of the relevant equipment later."

  Xia ruofei was an expert in security. He thought that since he was going to do it, he should take the safety measures of the farm in one step. This was because if he continued to introduce high - Quality vegetables, fruits, and other rare food and plants in the future, it might attract people with ulterior motives.

  "Alright!" Manager li replied,"Mr. Xia, if there's nothing else, I'll go back and do an overall plan and budget first. I'll show it to you later!"

  "Alright, thank you for your hard work, manager li!" Xia ruofei said with a smile.

  After sending manager li off, Xia ruofei immediately returned to the villa. After locking the door in his bedroom, he took out the spirit painting scroll and entered the medium.

  Yesterday at the immortal meat stall, he had talked about the gold Phoebe nanmu with Liang Qichao. However, Xia ruofei realized that it would be a waste if his spirit painting was just for growing vegetables and raising fish.

  It was time to plant some precious wood and medicinal herbs. Upgrading the Kasaya space required an immeasurable amount of money. The speed of making money now was beyond imagination to ordinary people, but Xia ruofei still felt that it was too slow.

  In order to plant precious crops, Xia ruofei was prepared to start with the Golden Phoebe.

  However, before he could plant it, he still had important things to verify. He would need to use the new material of Phoebe zhennan that Liang Qichao had given him.
