Chapter 730: Young, rich, and good – looking (2)

The eyes of the sales ladies couldn’t help but light up. Young, rich, and good – looking, he was definitely the standard rich husband!

Although they knew that the probability of getting close to the young man was extremely low, this did not stop them from secretly sizing him up with fiery eyes.

Liang Weimin had a warm smile on his face. He quickly walked forward and greeted,”RUO Fei!”

The young man driving the Knight XV was Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei had promised Lin Qiao that he would give her a surprise gift if she did well in the college entrance examination.

Although Xia ruofei had given Lin Qiao a lot of Apple Electronics a few days ago, these things were worth tens of thousands of Yuan. Xia ruofei was not surprised.

Moreover, Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao were still renting a house. At that time, Xia ruofei had made up his mind to give them a house after Lin Qiao’s college entrance examination.

It was a temporary house, and it would be best if it was an existing house. Xia ruofei didn’t have much time to look at the real estate, so he gave Liang Weimin a call after he left.

Liang Weimin’s jianda group was in the real estate industry, and he had a few properties for sale in San Shan. He was the most suitable person to look for.

And Liang Weimin was very concerned about Xia ruofei’s situation.

Xia ruofei had helped him a great deal when he was purchasing the Phoebe zhennan wood.

When Liang Qichao went to the states, Xia ruofei had suggested that he work at an Australian farm.

The facts proved that this suggestion was very far – sighted.

......

Liang Qichao’s competitor, Liang Xiaojun, worked at the shengbang group in the United States. Although he was also considered to be an average person, he did not stand out in many ways.

On the other hand, Liang Qichao’s farm in Australia was doing very well.

In particular, the experimental planting of paradise vegetable seeds in Australia was very successful. Although it was an experimental planting, the vegetables produced had already won a lot of fame in the Hunter Valley area.

One could imagine that after the large – scale planting, Australia’s Paradise Farm would definitely rise to fame, and Liang Qichao’s status would naturally rise as well.

Hence, Liang Weimin now owed two Xia ruofeis a big favor.

How could he not take Xia ruofei’s matter seriously?

Therefore, Liang Weimin immediately went through the properties he was selling in his mind and finally chose the one with the best location and the highest quality, Grand View. He also told Xia ruofei the address and asked him to drive there directly.

Then, Liang Weimin put down the work at hand and personally rushed to the sales office to wait. It could be said that he had given Xia ruofei enough face.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”uncle Liang, why did you come personally?” That’s too much trouble for you!”

“No trouble at all! No trouble at all! I just happen to be free today. ” Liang Weimin laughed and said,”ruofei! We have a few good houses in this building. I’ll take you to see them!”

“Alright! Then I’ll have to trouble uncle Liang!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Liang Weimin gestured to the sales manager. The manager quickly took the keys he had prepared and accompanied Liang Weimin and Xia ruofei to the electric car that had been prepared earlier. They headed to Building 3, which was closer to the sales department.

Liang Weimin sat in the car and personally introduced them to Xia ruofei.””Ruofei, we still have four good houses left. Building No. 1 and Building No. 3 are the Kings of the whole building. Their locations are quite good. You can say that it’s quiet in the midst of a busy area, and the view is very wide!”

“If uncle Liang recommends it to me, it must be the best.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Soon, the electric car arrived at Building No. 3.

Although the construction had been completed, the inspection and acceptance work had not been completed yet. There were still a few workers in the building doing some cleaning work, so everyone took a safety helmet at the entrance and put it on. Then, they walked in one after another.

The two houses in Building 3 were both on the 16th floor, and they were located at the two ends of the building, so the lighting was very good.

Both houses were duplexes with an area of about 180 square meters. The layout was very good. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel a little tempted.

“Uncle Liang, do you still have any flat – Floor apartments?” he asked.

Xia ruofei mainly considered that as Hu Zi’s mother grew older, it would be inconvenient for her to go up and down if she lived in a duplex. Moreover, the area of this apartment was a little too big. It was indeed a waste for just the two of them to live in it.

Besides, with Hu Zi’s mother’s personality, she would definitely not be willing to hire a part – time worker. It was very hard for her to clean such a big house by herself.

When Liang Weimin heard this, he chuckled and said,”You don’t like duplex structures? Then let’s go to Building 1 to take a look! There are still two flat – Level ones left over there. ” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Let’s go and take a look!” Xia ruofei said.

So, the group went downstairs and walked directly to Building 1, which was diagonally opposite building 3.

As they took the elevator up, Liang Weimin introduced,””Ruofei, the two houses I have here are symmetrical and have an area of about 120 square meters. Isn’t that too small?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I won ‘t!” It’s quite suitable!”

Soon, the high – speed elevator reached the 18th floor. The sales manager used the key to open the door to Room 1801 and bowed slightly to invite Xia ruofei and Liang Weimin in.

Xia ruofei strode in and looked around. He suddenly felt that this apartment was much more suitable than the two duplexes he had just bought.

Although there were no walls in the room, he could still tell that it had four rooms, two halls, two bathrooms, and two balconies.
