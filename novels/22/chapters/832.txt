Chapter 833: Wish fulfilled (1)

Translator: 549690339

When the funeral procession returned from the mountain, the villagers were still gathered in twos and threes at the Luo family’s Gate, enthusiastically discussing the scene that had just happened.

Lin Yue ‘e was absent – minded during the funeral. She was mainly worried about Xia ruofei.

She walked to the vicinity of her house and saw that Xia ruofei, Huang Zhenyu, and the other two were nowhere to be seen. Her heart suddenly skipped a beat. When she vaguely heard the villagers say something about the county Criminal Police, she became even more anxious.

Lin Yue ‘e hurriedly took a few steps forward. She pulled a familiar village woman and asked,””Aunt Wu, what happened to Zhicheng’s comrade? Did the police arrest you?”

Aunt Wu’s face was full of admiration as she said,”Yue ‘e, Zhicheng’s comrade – in – arms is really amazing!” He made a call, and not long after, the big leader of the province called the fake reporter and scolded him. The fake reporter was so scared that he almost peed his pants. ”

Lin Yue ‘E’s mind was in a mess due to her concern, so she didn’t pay attention to aunt Wu’s words. She tightly held aunt Wu’s hand and said,””Aunt Wu, what’s with the police you were talking about? Where did RUO Fei go? Did the police arrest you?”

Aunt Wu looked at Lin Yue ‘e with a smile and said,””How is that possible? “Yue ‘e, not long after you left, the police from the county’s Criminal Police unit came. We all thought that things were going to be bad. Your Zhicheng’s comrade might be arrested! I didn’t expect the police to not arrest him at all, but take the three fake reporters away in the car ...”

Lin Yue ‘e heaved a long sigh of relief. As long as Xia ruofei was fine, the process didn’t matter.

If Xia ruofei was really going to jail because of her family, she would feel guilty for the rest of her life.

At this moment, Xia ruofei walked out from the door. When he saw Lin Yue ‘e, he smiled and said,””Sister – in – Law, you’re back!”

When Lin Yue ‘e saw that Xia ruofei had appeared in front of her unscathed, she finally felt at ease.

“Ruofei, did the police make things difficult for you?” she asked.

“Don’t worry, sis – in – Law!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ve already coordinated everything. Let me tell you, that Huang Zhenyu ... That reporter doesn’t even have a reporter’s pass. He has also violated many rules and even violated many laws. The provincial SARFT’s Discipline Inspection team has already opened an investigation on him. He will be punished for all the bad things he has done!”

Lin Yue ‘e heaved a long sigh of relief and said,””RUO Fei, I thank you on behalf of old Luo ... But are you sure you’ll be fine after beating him up like that?”

At this time, third great uncle, who had not left, said,””Yue ‘e, this kind of bad person deserves it. What’s there to be afraid of if you hit him a few times? The police from the county came today and were very polite to this little girl. They didn’t make things difficult for him at all, so you don’t have to worry about it!”

Lin Yue ‘e hurriedly said to her third great uncle,””I know, 3rd great uncle ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sister – in – Law, I just gave uncle Luo a traditional Chinese medicine treatment. Then, I gave him some medicine that I concocted. He’s much better now. You can go in and have a look!”

“Oh ... Good, good, good!” Lin Yue ‘e hurriedly said.

She had been overwrought these few days. Her mother – in – Law had passed away, and her father-in-law’s health was very poor. She saw that this family was about to fall apart.

Fortunately, when Xia ruofei came, not only did he severely punish the fake reporter, but he also treated her father-in-law’s illness. Her father-in-law’s complexion had obviously improved the day before. Otherwise, if something had happened to her father – in – Law, Lin Yue ‘e would not have been able to hold on.

She quickly walked to the East Room and saw uncle Luo sitting on the bed. He looked much better, and his breathing was very stable. His face was also a lot rosier.

When he saw Lin Yue ‘e enter, uncle Luo sighed and asked,””Yue ‘e, did you send your mother to the mountain?”

“Mm! Dad, the funeral arrangements have been made. ” Lin Yue ‘e said, her eyes red.

“AI! Uncle Luo said,”it’s been hard on you ... Child, you haven’t had a good life since you came to our house!” Zhicheng was in the Army all year round, and your mom and I were in poor health. This family was supported by you. Later, Zhicheng got into an accident, and your mom also passed away ...”

As he spoke, uncle Luo could not help but tear up. He was very sad.

Lin Yue ‘e hurriedly said,”father, please don’t say that. Isn’t it my duty to take care of this family?” Now that mom and Zhicheng are gone, you have to take care of your health. If anything happens to you, I’ll really be too ashamed to see them in the future ...”

“I know, I know ...” Uncle Luo burst into tears.”My child, it’s been hard on you!”

“Dad, let’s not talk about this!” Lin Yue ‘e said,”RUO Fei said that he gave you another treatment this morning. How are you feeling?”

“This child’s medical skills are really good!” Uncle Luo said,”he gave me acupuncture for a while and boiled some medicine for me. I felt relaxed after drinking it!”

Lin Yue ‘e revealed a hint of joy and said,””That means the medicine is right! Dad, you’ve been suffering from this for so many years, and so many doctors have seen you but couldn’t find a way to cure it. If Fei can make your condition better after just one day, he must have a way to completely cure your illness!”

Uncle Luo nodded and said,”Xiao Xia said the same thing ...” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Lin Yue ‘e suddenly thought of Xia ruofei’s suggestion from last night. She had been busy since last night and had no time to think about it carefully. Now that she saw that her father-in-law’s condition had improved, she began to seriously consider Xia ruofei’s suggestion.
