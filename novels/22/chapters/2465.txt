However, the Ling family’s roots were in Beijing, and Ling Yun had spent his childhood in Beijing as well. Therefore, it wasn’t too difficult for him to adapt to the environment here. Many of the people in the circle were his childhood playmates, so it was natural for him to be like a fish in water here. Coupled with the Ling family’s power, Ling Yun naturally became an influential figure in the circle of rich and powerful people.

This was also the reason why Ling Yun could stand here today. There weren’t many members in the misty Paradise Club. Those who could come here either came from powerful families or were very capable themselves.

At first, Ling Yun felt that Xia ruofei looked a little unfamiliar. Furthermore, Xia ruofei claimed to be a shareholder of the Paradise society. Thus, Ling Yun was like Zhou Yuan and thought that Xia ruofei was helping Zhao Yongjun and the rest to beat up a small shareholder of the society. He was the person in charge of the society on the surface.

But when he saw Xia ruofei’s indifferent expression when facing Zhou Yuan, he could not fake the confidence that was in his bones.

If Xia ruofei was really just the representative of Zhao Yongjun and the others, he would definitely not speak to the members in such a manner. Ling Yun revealed a thoughtful expression when he thought of this.

Very quickly, he thought of a rumor in the industry ...

Ling Yun couldn’t help but look at Xia ruofei a few more times. He then took out his phone and searched for Yingying. He had already guessed Xia ruofei’s identity.

These young masters didn’t usually pay attention to entertainment news. Even if they did, they would only occasionally pay attention to the pretty female celebrities. Otherwise, Ling Yun wouldn’t have needed to search for Xia ruofei to recognize him.

There were many photos of Xia ruofei on Weibo and various forums. Naturally, Ling Yun found them quickly.

Ling Yun’s facial muscles twitched uncontrollably when he saw Xia ruofei’s selfie on Weibo. This was someone that even elder song had a good impression of! Although this person was not in the circle, he had long been a legend in the circle!

And she was different from him.

People like Ling Yun could live a decent life and be in high spirits mostly because of their fathers. On the other hand, Xia ruofei had made it this far with his own abilities. Xia ruofei’s influence was no less than anyone in the rich and powerful circle. In terms of wealth, these people couldn’t even compare to Xia ruofei.

Ling Yun’s mind was racing as he quickly came forward with a warm smile.”You must be President Xia! I’ve long heard of your name! Today, he finally saw her in person! It’s a pleasure to meet you!”

Xia ruofei was slightly taken aback. He was not used to Ling Yun’s sudden enthusiasm after such a long time. He thought to himself, why does this self – approachable fellow speak so much like Zhou leiyun! What did he mean by finally seeing her in person ...

Ling Yun was very friendly. He immediately said enthusiastically,”President Xia, let me introduce myself. I’m Ling Yun, and I’ve been good friends with Weiwei for many years. My father and her father are old colleagues too!” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“So it’s young master Ling, nice to meet you!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Even though this Ling Yun looked a little slippery, he wasn’t as brainless as some nouveau riches. Moreover, one shouldn’t slap a smiling person. Xia ruofei wouldn’t give Ling Yun any attitude either.

“Hello! Hello there!” Ling Yun passed his business card over enthusiastically.”Director Xia, this is my business card!”

Xia ruofei took the name card and thought for a while. In the end, he reached into his pocket and took out a name card from his storage space. He passed it to Ling Yun out of courtesy.

Of course, this business card was a different set, specially for dealing with outsiders. There was only an email box that Qin Yanan and the others had taken care of, as well as the phone number of the Board of Directors. Xia ruofei’s personal phone number was not on it.

Ling Yun carefully kept Xia ruofei’s name card, then turned his gaze to the slightly dazed Zhou Yuan.

“Zhou Yuan, how can you speak to director Xia like that?” Ling Yun frowned slightly. President Xia won’t stoop to your level, or else you’ll be out of luck!”

Ling Yun was actually helping Zhou Yuan. Otherwise, if Zhou Yuan offended Xia ruofei too much, he would not be able to bear the consequences.

After all, Zhou Yuan was usually very respectful to him. If there was anything, especially if it required money, Zhou Yuan would do it at the first possible moment. There were also those luxury sports cars that Ling Yun coveted but didn’t dare to ask his family for money to buy, especially the Ferrari Enzo that Zhou Yuan mentioned just now. Ling Yun had long taken note of them.

This time, after helping Zhou Yuan out of his predicament, he would be able to drive the Enzo car in peace.

Xia ruofei looked at Zhou Yuan in amusement and said,””It’s unlikely! I don’t think so!”

While Zhou Yuan was still in a daze, Ling Yun frowned and said,””What are you thinking? Why aren’t you apologizing to President Xia?”

Ling Yun’s voice was icy cold, causing Zhou Yuan to shiver. At this moment, no matter how slow he was, he could tell that this young man who always had a faint smile on his face must have a very powerful background.

Thinking of this, Zhou Yuan quickly said,””President Xia, I’m sorry ... I was a little impatient just now. Please don’t take it to heart.”

Xia ruofei did not take Zhou Yuan seriously, so he waved his hand and said,””Forget it, I’ll just be more careful in the future. And ... When you’re chasing girls, don’t just use smashing, that’s too tacky!”

Zhou Yuan didn’t think much of it. However, after seeing Ling Yun’s attitude, he didn’t dare to refute Xia ruofei. He could only nod his head and say reluctantly,””I’ve learned a lot ...”

At this moment, a person walked over quickly, looking a little anxious.

“President Xia!” The man cupped his hands at Xia ruofei and said.

Xia ruofei took a closer look and smiled.””Chairman Zhou! Hello there!”

This person was Zhou leiyun, who had just chatted with Xia ruofei at the entrance of the club.

Just now, Zhou leiyun had gone upstairs to take a look. When he walked down the stairs, he saw Zhou Yuan standing in front of Xia ruofei, as if he was bowing and apologizing. His heart skipped a beat, and he quickly walked over.

After Zhou leiyun and Xia ruofei greeted each other, he immediately looked at Zhou Yuan sternly.

Zhou leiyun’s gaze was like a knife, causing Zhou Yuan’s entire body to tremble. He lowered his head and called out,””Second uncle!”

When Xia ruofei heard this, he finally understood.

Xia ruofei thought to himself,”I knew it. Zhou leiyun looked like he was in his early forties. How could he have a son in his twenties?” Zhou Yuan was his nephew after all!

Glory world Corporation was run by Zhou leiyun. Zhou leiyun’s brother, who was also Zhou Yuan’s father, Zhou leiming, was also an executive in glory world Corporation. However, Zhou leiyun was still the one who had the final say.

Furthermore, because Zhou leiyun had no sons and only two daughters, Zhou Yuan could be said to be the only male in his family’s next generation.

As such, Zhou leiyun treated Zhou Yuan as half a son, and was usually more strict with his discipline.

This also caused Zhou Yuan to not be afraid of his parents, but the moment he saw Zhou leiyun, he was like a mouse that saw a cat, trembling and unable to speak clearly.

Zhou leiyun stared at Zhou Yuan and asked,””Zhou Yuan, what did you do just now? Are you being disrespectful to President Xia?”

Ten thousand alpacas galloped across Zhou Yuan’s heart. He cried out in his heart,”What kind of God was this President Xia? He could even befriend young master Yun, and now even his powerful second uncle seemed to be fawning over him. Why was he so unlucky? He had accidentally touched the iron plate ...

Zhou Yuan did not dare to lie in front of Zhou leiyun. He lowered his head and stuttered,””Second uncle ... I ... I was just talking to CEO Xia just now, and my tone was a little rushed ... I ... I wasn’t being disrespectful to CEO Xia!”

“You still dare to quibble!” Zhou leiyun glared at him and said,”what did I teach you? Did you just ignore it?”

Xia ruofei watched from the side and knew that Zhou leiyun was putting on an act for him. He felt a little bored and said,””Chairman Zhou! Forget it, forget it, it’s not a big deal. It’s just a few quarrels, and young master Zhou has already apologized to me! Just forget about it!”

Zhou leiyun then glared at Zhou Yuan and said,””Hurry up and thank President Xia for his magnanimity!”

Zhou Yuan quickly thanked Xia ruofei,”thank you, CEO Xia!” Thank you, President Xia!”

“What are you still standing there for? Why don’t you go home and reflect on your mistakes?” Zhou leiyun said sternly,”what a disgraceful thing!”
