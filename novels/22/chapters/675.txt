Chapter 676: The perfect solution_2

Meanwhile, in the small conference room of the National Medicine Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the Secretary, Chen Ming ‘an, led a few division and division leaders to question Qi Min and the other two.

The three of them didn’t dare to hide anything, and quickly told him everything.

When Chen Ming ‘an heard that Qi Min had directly crossed the line with chief Zeng, and that the boss of Taoyuan pharmaceuticals he had offended had a frighteningly powerful background, he almost couldn’t hold back and threw a teacup at him.

After disgustedly waving his hand to get the three of them to leave, Chen Ming ‘an smoked another cigarette and remained silent for a long time.

Then, he suddenly said,”Xiao Lin, the royal residence’s private kitchen isn’t far from here. I’m guessing that CEO Xia hasn’t left yet.” “Immediately bring two notices and personally go to him and chief he kun. At the same time, apologize to him at the agency. By the way, don’t forget to inform him of the decision to deal with Qi Min and the others. It’ll be a good explanation!”

“Alright!” Lin Huahai quickly stood up and said. Then, he picked up two notices and left the small conference room in a hurry.

Meanwhile, Chen Ming ‘an had brought along a few other leaders and a few of the secretaries to quickly come up with a simple report. He still had to bring Lin Huahai to Zeng Kewen’s house to make a report later!

The private kitchen of the royal family.

Lin Huahai quickly found the private room that Xia ruofei and the others were in.

However, how could this kind of VIP box be freely accessed by just anyone? Especially since the boss was entertaining the guests inside, the waiter at the door stopped Lin Huahai without hesitation.

“Pretty lady, can you help me pass on the message?” Lin Huahai said with a smile. I’m from the National Drug Administration, and I’m here to look for President Xia of Taoyuan pharmaceuticals. I have something important to tell you. ”

At first, the waitress was unmoved, but she couldn’t resist Lin Huahai’s soft – hearted begging. A soft – hearted girl finally nodded, pushed open the door to the private room, and bent down in front of fourth brother. She leaned close to his ear and whispered what happened.

Fourth brother’s face revealed a strange expression, then he nodded and said,””I know, tell him to wait at the door!”

......

“Alright,” he said. The waiter quickly said.

Fourth brother smiled at Xia ruofei and said,””Ruofei, someone from the drug Administration is here. They’re probably almost done with the matter. Do you want to meet them?”

“So fast!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”little fourth brother’s face is so big! Since he’s already here, let’s meet him!”

When fourth brother heard this, he pouted angrily at the waiter who was pouring wine for everyone in the private room. The waiter immediately understood and walked out of the private room. He quickly led the nervous Lin Huahai in.

He kun, Xue Jinshan, and the others could not help but sigh at this scene.

Needless to say, Xue Jinshan and the others had been dealing with the National Medicine Division for the past few days. Not to mention Lin Huahai, who was the division Chief, even the small section Chief, Qi Min, was rarely seen.

The first person he kun wanted to invite to dinner was Lin Huahai, but he was too realistic and tactfully rejected the invitation.

Of course, no one knew if this was a blessing or a curse. If Lin Huahai had accepted the invitation, he might have been one of the people fired today.

Even though he would be in trouble this time, at least the situation had not reached the worst.

The first thing Lin Huahai did when he entered the room was to greet his fourth brother.

Fourth brother nodded and pointed at Xia ruofei, who was beside him.””This is President Xia from paradise pharmaceuticals.”

Lin Huahai quickly took two steps forward and bowed to Xia ruofei. He said,””Hello, President Xia, I’m Lin Huahai, the director of the National Medicine Division of Chinese medicine. First of all, I would like to express my sincere apologies to you. Our work style is too bureaucratic, especially when a black sheep like Qi Min appeared! As the division Chief, I can’t shirk my responsibility either!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”chief Lin, you’re too kind.” What do you want from me today? Don’t tell me it’s just to apologize?”

Lin Huahai quickly said,”President Xia, in addition to the representative’s apology, our division’s leader also specifically instructed me to tell you that Qi Min, Lu Ping, and Guo Ziyang have been suspended. The next step will be to start an investigation on them.”

“Oh.” Xia ruofei did not comment and replied indifferently.

This was what the question should mean, so Xia ruofei did not find it strange.

Lin Huahai continued.”In addition, our Department has organized a review of the materials submitted by paradise pharmaceuticals overnight. It has passed. I have also specially brought the project proposal notice here!”

Lin Huahai opened his briefcase and presented a notice with a bright red Seal to Xia ruofei with both hands.

Xia ruofei took the notice and glanced at it, then handed it to Xue Jinshan.

Xue Jinshan felt like he was in a dream. He looked at it several times and even rubbed his eyes, afraid that he was seeing things.

He had struggled for so many days but still couldn’t find a way in. He felt that this was as difficult as ascending to the heavens, but they had actually organized a review overnight and passed it in such a short time!

Xia ruofei was much calmer than Xue Jinshan. He smiled and said,”Director Lin, thank you for your hard work!”

“You’re too kind, this is our job. ” Lin Huahai quickly said,”and because of the Qi people, this application has been delayed for many days. This in itself is a serious dereliction of duty. We are only correcting their mistakes.”

At this time, all the blame should be placed on Qi Min, since he was already done for.

Xia ruofei nodded lightly.

Lin Huahai turned his gaze to he kun. He took out another document from his briefcase and handed it over with both hands.

He said,”bureau chief he, this is a notice from our division to the southeast Food and Drug Administration. It’s to assign you to carry out the first review of the heart – nourishing soup project. I’ve also brought it here.”

“Oh?” He kun was also very surprised.”This time, it’s really fast!”

Lin Huahai laughed awkwardly and said in a low voice,””Director he, I’m really sorry for today! I really have something on and can’t leave. How about this ... Tomorrow, this little brother will treat you to a drink!”

He kun was elated. However, as a cunning old fox, he naturally would not show it. He just gave an ambiguous reply.

Lin Huahai delivered the documents and made all the necessary gestures, so he didn’t stay any longer and simply left.

“Little fourth brother, thanks!” Xia ruofei smiled as he raised his glass to fourth brother.

“You’re welcome!” Fourth brother quickly filled his glass with wine and clinked his glass with Xia ruofei ‘s.”Ruofei, we’re all brothers. Don’t be such an outsider!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Alright!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”brother Xiao si, you’re welcome to visit the three mountains when you’re free! I have a farm over there, so I can pick fruits and vegetables by myself in the summer. Oh, and we’ve recently raised some very delicious Chang Jiang Chinese perch!”

Song Rui, who had been silent all this while, couldn’t help but say,””You don’t say. Ruofei has a lot of good things. Those vegetables, wine, fish, tea leaves ... Those bought outside can’t be compared! Zeng Xiaosi, you’ll know when you go eat it. ”

Fourth brother smiled.”Young master Song, I’m almost drooling now that you’ve mentioned it. No, no. I’ll definitely find time to go there soon.”

Fourth brother loved to eat. Otherwise, he would not have opened such a big private restaurant. What Xia ruofei and song Rui said was really tempting to him.

Moreover, this could further improve the relationship between everyone, which was what fourth brother liked to see.

Song Rui pursed his lips and said,”but you have to be mentally prepared. RUO Fei is the most stingy. It shouldn’t be a problem to let you have a taste. If you want to care enough, you’d better give up as soon as possible.”

Fourth brother was stunned for a moment.”I can’t even pay for it?”

Song Rui glanced at him with disdain and said,””Do I look like someone who can’t afford to pay?”

Fourth brother quickly smiled apologetically and shook his head.

Song Rui didn’t bother to explain to him that Yingluo was actually a nouveau riche, but they were not on the same level at all. It could even be said that they were two or three levels apart.

Of course, song Rui belonged to the top circle of rich and powerful people, and he was a well – known figure in that circle.

And fourth brother was still a hundred and eight thousand miles away!

“Zeng Xiaosi, find me a quiet place. I have something to discuss with RUO Fei in private.” Song Rui said indifferently.

“Alright, alright.” Fourth brother said hurriedly, then instructed the waiter,”go and prepare a tea room immediately. Be quick!”
