Xia ruofei looked at Shi Qingyuan, then turned to Zhu zhihang and asked,””County Head Zhu, who is this?”

Shi Qingyuan could not help but feel that he was being looked down on. He was the head of the government office. Although he was not a regular person, he was still the head of the government. In his opinion, Xia ruofei should know him.

Zhu zhihang came back to his senses and said,””Oh! I forgot to introduce him. Director Xia, he is director Shi Qingyuan from the government office. ”

“Oh, it’s director Shi.” Xia ruofei glanced at Shi Qingyuan and said lightly,”as for the location of the project, it’s still a business secret before my company officially disclosed it to the public. I’m afraid it’s not convenient to tell you. I hope director Shi can understand.”

Shi Qingyuan felt embarrassed. He had been rebuffed ...

Zhu zhihang couldn’t care less about being reserved at this time. He quickly said,””President Xia, we noticed that your company’s inspection team has already gone to several neighboring districts and counties, even to the neighboring cities. But why haven’t they come to our Changping County? We also welcome and support this project!”

“County Head Zhu, I didn’t ask about the specific arrangements.” Xia ruofei lied without blushing.”Our company has a very professional team. I also believe in the team’s ability and judgment, so I’ve been letting them do it. I didn’t interfere with the site selection work of the pharmaceutical factory, so ...”

Xia ruofei shrugged and continued,””I don’t know why the inspection team didn’t consider Changping County, but I think there must be a good reason! I believe in my team on this. ”

These words were as good as not saying anything! Zhu zhihang could not help but criticize in his heart.

He would never believe it. Without Xia ruofei’s permission, the inspection team of the Paradise Corporation would dare to completely bypass Changping County. According to Wu Liqian’s feedback, the Paradise corporation’s first intention was to build a factory in Changping County, and it was Xia ruofei who talked to Wu Liqian personally. It was very likely that it was Xia ruofei’s own idea.

But now, Xia ruofei had completely pushed it aside, as if he did not know about this at all.

Zhu zhihang was a little anxious. He thought for a while and said,””President Xia, I won’t hide it from you. Our Changping County has also attached great importance to the pharmaceutical factory project of your company. “for this, we even held a special standing committee and customized a series of preferential measures for this project. secretary zeng also attached great importance to this and has given instructions many times on this matter, asking us to form a capable team to specifically take over this project ...” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

it would have been fine if zhu zhihang did not mention this “competent team”. once he mentioned the connection of the team, xia ruofei was even angrier. so your so – called competent team is in charge of picking peaches! Directly kicking sister Qian away, and then openly snatching political achievements, is that what you do?

“County Head Zhu,” Xia ruofei said lightly,”first of all, on behalf of the company, I would like to thank Changping County for your concern and concern. However, I also said just now that I didn’t interfere with the specific arrangements of this project. After all, I have a lot of things to deal with every day. The company doesn’t only have one paradise pharmaceutical factory! How about this, you can directly contact the person in charge of this project, which is also the factory manager of Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory, Xue Jinshan. I will also let him know, so it will be more convenient for you to directly communicate with him for the specific problems!”

There was nothing wrong with this sentence, but how could Zhu zhihang, who had been in the officialdom all year round, not see that Xia ruofei was just playing ball? Without Xia ruofei’s approval, it would be strange if there was any progress with Xue Jinshan!

Xia ruofei’s hard and soft approach did not work, and Zhu zhihang was at his wit’s end. The rest of the people could not even get a word in, especially after Shi Qingyuan hit a soft nail. Zhu zhihang’s entourage did not dare to come and touch this bad luck.

Zhu zhihang’s brain was spinning rapidly. This seemed to be a dead end. The only good thing for Changping County was that Xia ruofei had his eyes on it at the beginning. His intention to invest in Changping County was the strongest.

However, as far as he knew, the preferential conditions given by the other counties were not worse than those given by Changping County. Moreover, for a technology – intensive enterprise like the Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory, although transportation conditions were important, they did not occupy a dominant position. As long as the conditions were right, the increase in transportation costs was nothing compared to the amazing profits of the Yushi ointment.

Moreover, the volume and weight of the Jade skin cream and heart – nourishing soup were very small, so the logistics cost was even divided between each product, and the cost was next to nothing.

Not to mention that the other counties would take the initiative to compensate for these increased costs in terms of tax. For the Paradise pharmaceutical factory, there would be no loss at all.

The conversation had reached a stalemate. How could he break it?

Zhu zhihang was deep in thought, and Xia ruofei was not in a hurry. He just drank his tea with a smile.

At this moment, the clock on the wall showed that there were still ten minutes before work ended.

Xia ruofei had already made up his mind. If Zhu zhihang was still saying these useless things when it was time to get off work, he would not hesitate to ask him to leave and not waste time with them.

At this time, Zhu zhihang’s mind flashed and he thought of the words “the person who tied the bell must untie the bell.”

Although Wu Liqian guaranteed with her party – like personality that she did not take personal revenge on this project or make things difficult for him, Zhu zhihang had always suspected that the reason why Paradise corporation’s attitude had changed 180 degrees was because of Wu Liqian’s elimination.

Perhaps Wu Liqian would not take the initiative to ruin the introduction of this project because she was aware of the big picture, but there was no guarantee that Xia ruofei would not stand up for Wu Liqian!

There had always been a rumor that Wu Liqian and Xia ruofei had a good personal relationship!

If that was the case, even if the project was settled in Changping, Wu Liqian would have nothing to do with the political achievements. Why would Xia ruofei let Liu haojun have it? Let’s just go our separate ways!

In Zhu zhihang’s opinion, this was in line with Xia ruofei’s identity as a young man. He was also young once. When he was Xia ruofei’s age, he was also impulsive and always wanted to settle grudges. He would not think too much about the long term.

Thinking of this, Zhu zhihang seemed to see a glimmer of hope.

He quickly considered his words and said,””Director Xia, I heard from County Head Wu that you mentioned to her that you wanted to expand the farm, and you seemed to have the intention of connecting the factory with the farm. It was because of County Head Wu’s report that we quickly convened the Standing Committee to discuss preferential measures. I’m just wondering why your company suddenly changed your mind?”

Finally, I can’t hold it in anymore ... Xia ruofei laughed coldly in his heart.

Since Zhu zhihang had brought up Wu Liqian, Xia ruofei did not beat around the bush anymore. He said lightly,””County Head Zhu, a company’s development strategy must be constantly adjusted and revised. Sister Qian didn’t lie about this matter back then. We did have such considerations at the time, but when we went to other districts and counties to investigate, it was also necessary for the company’s development strategy.”

Of course, Zhu zhihang did not take Xia ruofei’s words seriously. He only caught the most important word “sister Qian”. This was the only message that Xia ruofei wanted to pass on to him.

His relationship with County Head Wu was indeed not ordinary! Zhu zhihang thought to himself.

At this point, Zhu zhihang was very sure that the only reason for the change in attitude of paradise Corporation was to express their dissatisfaction with them kicking Wu Liqian out without permission!

It was indeed not right, but even Zeng jianzhang could not do anything about it, let alone Zhu zhihang.

Of course, after making this judgment, Zhu zhihang had a strong hope, because Liu haojun had left, so this matter naturally had a chance to turn around.

Thinking of this, Zhu zhihang immediately said with an apologetic face,””President Xia, speaking of this, we haven’t done enough in our Changping County! Secretary Zeng has told me more than once that we couldn’t withstand the pressure and let Wu Liqian suffer. “Of course, this is just an individual who doesn’t abide by the political rules. It doesn’t represent the attitude of our entire team. In fact, we highly approve of County Head Wu’s work!”
