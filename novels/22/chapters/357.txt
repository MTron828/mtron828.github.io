Chapter 358: An orchid in an empty valley (2)

The booth was quiet, with only the heavy breathing of everyone. “Big brother Xia ... Is ... Is this really our plant?” Jiang Yue asked after a long while. “Yeah...Xia ruofei, did you buy another pot?” Lu You could not help but ask. Xia Cheng and the other students from the gardening club were also in disbelief. Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”are you exaggerating?” This is your pot of mo orchid!” Lu You looked at some of Mo Lan’s details carefully and finally said with certainty,””That’s right, it’s really the original pot ...” In fact, everyone knew in their hearts that this pot of orchid was definitely not Xia ruofei ‘s. Although it had changed a lot, its basic form was still there. It was not as exaggerated as completely changing into two different things. It was just that this pot of orchid had undergone a complete transformation, causing everyone to subconsciously have an illusion. “Brother Xia! You’re really amazing!” Jiang Yue said excitedly. Her face was filled with adoration, and her eyes were practically shooting out little stars. Peng Hui and you Jun, on the other hand, had complicated expressions on their faces. You Jun, in particular, was so envious that he was gritting his teeth so hard that he almost broke them. Xia Cheng also said in admiration,”Mr. Xia, your methods are really amazing! After you’ve nursed this jade lion, its grade has immediately increased by several levels ...” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”so now, everyone should be more confident in winning the Gold Award, right?” Xia Cheng nodded and said,”logically speaking, in the past, this pot of Mo Lan would definitely win the gold Prize!” But it was hard to say now ... He didn’t know how yang suhe was doing at Agricultural University. It seems like the judges “evaluation is quite high!” Even though Mo Lan’s performance had given Xia Cheng a huge surprise, yang suhe, who was opposite him, had also given him great pressure. The more outstanding Mo Lan’s performance was, the more worried Xia Cheng was. Xia ruofei smiled faintly.”We’ve done everything we can. If we still can’t win the Gold Award, then we’re just unlucky. We can’t blame anyone else ...” “Yup!” Xia Cheng nodded and said. Then, he looked at the Jade lion, Mo Lan, and said,”but if we lose to Agricultural University, this jade lion ...” Xia Cheng thought about the bet between Xia ruofei and Chen Song. If yang suhe won the gold Prize, the Jade lion pot would lose to Chen Song. Now that the Jade lion had displayed such good quality, if it lost to Chen Song, even if he was not the owner of the pot of orchids, he would still feel very distressed. After all, this pot of orchid would be placed in their gardening club. “I lost,” Lu You said nonchalantly.”It’s just a pot of flowers ...” Xia ruofei watched from the side and couldn’t help but give Lu You a thumbs up in his heart. On this point, she was much more generous than Xia Cheng, the president of the gardening club. In comparison, Xia Cheng was really a little hesitant and worried. Xia ruofei laughed and changed the topic.””By the way, I heard that there are teachers from several universities participating in the judging panel. Are there any teachers from your Sanshan University selected?” “Brother Xia, there are teachers from several key universities who have been selected.” Jiang Yue said,”but I don’t think I’ve seen Mrs. Hu from our school ... What’s going on?” “Oh ...” Lu You said,”I heard that teacher Hu had an upset stomach yesterday. He won’t be able to come today!” “What?” Xia Cheng was shocked.”Then, we’ll be lacking the support of the judges ...” Lu You said nonchalantly,”what does that matter?” “Originally, when we were grading our flowers, teacher Hu had to avoid it as the person in charge. It didn’t affect anything ...” “But ...” Xia Cheng frowned.”Mrs. Hu can grade Agricultural University’s flowers ...” The meaning of his words was self – evident. Lu You pouted.”Even if we want to win, we have to win fair and square. Even if teacher Hu is here, we can’t show favoritism!” “We won’t play favorites,” Xia Cheng sighed.”But we can’t stop others from playing favorites ... Agricultural University has teachers on the judging team ...” Xia ruofei sat on the chair with a relaxed expression. He looked at Xia Cheng and the others with a smile, not feeling nervous at all. While they were talking, the judges had finished evaluating the booth of Agricultural University and began to walk straight to the booth of Sanshan University. Xia Cheng hurriedly called for everyone to get up, and he also quickly walked out to welcome them. “Good day, teachers. I’m the president of Sanshan University’s gardening club, Xia Cheng.” Xia Cheng politely bowed to the judges and said. Chen dongbai, who took the lead, smiled and nodded. He said to the Vice – Principal of Agricultural University,”Vice President li, that pot of yang Lotus from your Agricultural University just now really opened everyone’s eyes! I heard that Sanshan University’s flower exhibition this year is also very good. I just don’t know how it will compare to your yang – style Lotus ...” “Our brother school has many talented people,” Vice President Li said with a smile.”I think we can cultivate even better exotic flowers and rare herbs!” Although his words were humble, his expression was extremely confident. It was obvious that he was just being polite on the surface, but he didn’t think so in his heart. “Let’s go and take a look together ...”Chen dongbai laughed. Xia Cheng quickly made an inviting gesture and said,””Teachers, please come in.”Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎
