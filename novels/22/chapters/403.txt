Chapter 404: Instigation_1

“You’re still a child?” Xia ruofei laughed as he looked at song Rui’s body, which had been hollowed out by wine and women. He said seriously,”well ... That’s right. It’s just that you’re a child who has mastered the high – end skills of poison Dragon, Ice and Fire ...”

Song Rui chuckled and scratched his head,””I’m just putting on an act! You know what I mean ...”

“I don’t know shit!” Xia ruofei said without mercy,”young master Song, I think your father is right! If you don’t find a woman to tie you down soon, you’ll die in a gentle place sooner or later!”

“Is it that serious?” Song Rui mumbled,”I say, ruofei, you can’t help an outsider! You must stand on my side in this matter!”

“I’ll support you in spirit!”Xia ruofei laughed.

“What’s the use of that?” Song Rui cried and said,”you have to help me think of a way! I will never yield to fate!”

Xia ruofei felt strange and asked,””Aren’t all the descendants of big clans like you? It’s normal for the family to arrange a political marriage for you! And you said it yourself, the other party is a beauty. You’re already very lucky, okay? It’s better than arranging a fat woman with pockmarks all over her face for you, right?”

Hearing Xia ruofei’s words, song Rui couldn’t help but shiver and said,””Don’t continue ... I’m scared just thinking about it!”

“That’s why! You should be content!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”why don’t you just accept your fate?”

Song Rui came back to his senses and said,””Impossible! I will definitely not yield! Why should my lifelong happiness be decided by my family? I’m telling you, although I’m usually quite flirtatious, that’s all just an act. As the saying goes, I’ve passed through Ten Thousand Flowers without a single leaf touching me. If I don’t meet a woman who can move my heart, I’ll never get married!”

Xia ruofei nodded and gave song Rui a thumbs up.”You have ambition! Song Rui, I will support you in spirit!”

Song Rui’s anger was instantly deflated. He said gloomily,””RUO Fei, you brat, you’ve been going around in circles for so long, but you’re still not willing to help me!”

Xia ruofei shrugged his shoulders and said innocently,””I’m just a small businessman. I can’t meddle in your big family’s Affairs. ”

“Aren’t you from the Special Forces?” Song Rui said.

Xia ruofei looked frightened and said,””Young master Song, you’re not asking me to kill that woman so that you’ll never have any trouble again, are you? I’m telling you, I, Xia ruofei, am a good warrior who has been trained by the party for many years. I’m definitely famous and professional. I will never do anything that violates the law!”

Song Rui looked at Xia ruofei in disdain and said,””What are you thinking? Am I that vicious?”

“Then what do you mean?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

Although there was no one on the mountain, song Rui still looked left and right, then lowered his voice and said,””Ruofei, I want to run away from home ... But my mom has sent people to keep a close eye on me. There are even people guarding outside when I go to the toilet. She’s afraid that I’ll run away ... You’re so good at fighting, can you help me?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”Young master Song, no one knows your son better than your mother! Mrs. Song knew that you would slip away!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“RUO Fei, tell me, are you going to help or not?” Song Rui asked.

“I won ‘t!” Xia ruofei shook his head and said firmly.

“Hey! Are we brothers or not?” Song Rui was so angry that he shouted,”you just need to knock out those guys who are responsible for ‘protecting’ me. You don’t have to worry about the rest. Moreover, you and I know about this. Even if I’m caught, I definitely won’t rat you out. ”

“Song Rui, calm down.” Xia ruofei said,”although Huaxia is huge, where do you think you can hide with the power of the song family? I promise you’ll be caught in three days. And I don’t think they need to arrest you, they can just stop your credit card. Without any source of income, how many days do you think you can last?”

“I have a passport, okay?” Song Rui said,”as long as I can escape, I will be overseas. No matter how powerful the family is, they can’t extend their reach overseas.”

“And then?” Xia ruofei asked calmly,”you can’t even speak English properly and you don’t have money. How long can you live abroad?”

“I ...” Song Rui was speechless.

He sadly realized that Xia ruofei was right. If his family cut off all his sources of income, no matter where he ran to, he would not be able to escape from the palm of Buddha.

Although he was usually glorious, if he really got rid of the Halo of being the young master of the song family, his survival ability was far inferior to that of a brother who came out to work.

However, song Rui had a carefree personality, so he quickly put these things to the back of his mind. He chuckled and said,””RUO Fei, are we brothers?”

“Get straight to the point!” Xia ruofei said warily.

“Do brothers and friends have a sense of righteousness?” Song Rui looked at Xia ruofei expectantly and said,”when I’m down and out overseas, shouldn’t you sponsor me?”

Xia ruofei was both angry and amused. After all this talk, this kid still hadn’t given up on escaping! And she actually had her eyes on him.
