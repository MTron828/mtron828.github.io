2493 Official transfer announcement (2)

“You’re quite thoughtful!” Xia ruofei laughed and said. Then, he asked worriedly,”is his shoulder injury that serious?”

Wu Lei’s shoulder was injured in the AFC Asian Cup, but he still participated in the Asian Cup after that, so the outside world had always thought that his injury was not serious.

Zhou leiyun said,”yes, the dislocation of the scapular joint and the tearing of the ligament are still quite serious. It’s just that it’s not a lower limb injury, so he can still continue to play. However, if he were to suffer a second injury during the confrontation, his injury may become more serious. Therefore, the doctor recommended immediate surgery. He is still considering it. After all, there are not many rounds left in La Liga. If he were to undergo surgery, he will definitely be eliminated for this season. It’s also unknown whether he can fit into the team next season.”

Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat, but he did not say anything about Wu Lei’s shoulder injury.

“Director Xia, are you sure you can go to Spain?” Zhou leiyun asked.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I was just about to tell you about this!” I’m going to reward a group of outstanding employees and let them go to Spain for a holiday in two groups. I’ll go to Spain with the first group of employees. Please arrange for the club to send out an invitation for a business inspection! We’ll apply for a business contract. ”

“No problem!” Zhou leiyun said,”I’ll send you the contact information of the Chinese person in charge of the club later. At the same time, I’ll contact him. If you have any specific requests, your company can contact him directly.”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said,”general manager Zhou, let’s meet in Spain!”

“Hahaha! I’ll see you in Spain!” Zhou leiyun laughed heartily.

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei saw that the news conference was still playing on the computer screen. It was mainly about Shengang club’s announcement of the transfer and answering the reporters ‘questions. Wu Lei was not present.

The news conference was filled with official news. The actual content was definitely not as much as what Zhou leiyun had said in his chat with Xia ruofei. Hence, Xia ruofei did not continue to watch the live broadcast and directly closed the Live Broadcast page.

Dong Yun was still in Xia ruofei’s office. Xia ruofei had told her not to leave so Dong Yun had heard the conversation between Xia ruofei and Zhou leiyun.

If Dong Yun could not guess what had happened just by listening to the phone call, then Xia ruofei’s computer had been on speaker just now. Combined with the information revealed at the press conference, how could Dong Yun not know what had happened?

After Xia ruofei hung up, Dong Yun could not help but ask,””Chairman, is it Wu Lei from Shengang club who transferred to RCD Espanyol?”

Xia ruofei looked at Dong Yun in surprise and said with a smile,””I didn’t expect President Dong to be a fan! There aren’t many girls who watch football nowadays!”

“Why can’t girls watch the game?” Dong Yun asked, somewhat unconvinced. There are a lot of female fans now, okay? When I was studying abroad, I often went to the stadium to watch the game!”

“Chairman, I know why you arranged for everyone to visit the Spanish club!” Dong Yun said with a smile. You must have known about Wu Lei’s transfer, didn’t you?”

Xia ruofei didn’t deny it. He nodded and said,””Yup! I’ve talked about this with director Zhou from glory world Corporation in private, and he invited me to Spain for a few days. Then, I was just about to go to Qiantang, and I thought that since everyone worked so hard, other than the monetary reward, I should also let everyone relax, so I decided to arrange for everyone to go to Spain for a few days!”

Dong Yun gave Xia ruofei a thumbs up and said,””You’re indeed a good leader who empathizes with your subordinates! But ... I’m a bar?a fan, what should I do?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you can choose not to visit the Espanyol club!” Or if you want to visit nokapu is no problem! I’ll get someone to make the arrangements ...” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“But I also like Wu Lei a lot!” “Why did he choose to join Barca’s arch – enemy?” Dong Yun asked, feeling a little conflicted.

Dong Yun’s current appearance did not look like a strong woman at all. She looked like a loyal Barca.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”he does want to join Barca!” But Barca doesn’t like her either ...”

“That’s true ...” Dong Yun agreed.

This was an objective fact, and it wasn’t to disrespect Wu Lei, but his strength was indeed not enough compared to the overall requirements of the universe team.

“Forget it!” Dong Yun continued. He was no longer conflicted! I’ll just go to nokapu first and then visit Wu Lei!”

“That’s the way!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

At this time, Zhou leiyun had already sent the contact information of the Chinese representative from the Spanish club to Xia ruofei via WeChat. At the same time, he said in a voice message,””President Xia, I’ve already spoken to him. You can ask him for anything at any time. In addition, he will arrange everyone’s food and accommodation during your stay in Spain. In short, after you get your visas, buy your tickets and fly directly to Barcelona. You don’t have to worry about anything else!”

“Thank you!” Xia ruofei replied to Zhou leiyun’s message and forwarded Zhou leiyun’s contact information to Dong Yun.

Xia ruofei said to Dong Yun,”CEO Dong, this is the contact information of the Chinese person in charge of the Spanish club. You’ll be in charge of the liaison!” We’ll get the other party to send an invitation first. Also, after we’ve decided on our members, we can also get him to arrange for our accommodation in advance. Chief Zhou has already informed us!”

“Alright!” Dong Yun replied.

Then, she hesitated for a moment and said,””Chairman, can factory manager Xue ... Follow the second batch of employees to Spain?”

Xia ruofei frowned and asked,””Is there something that he can’t leave for this period of time? Didn’t I tell him to rest for a while?”

“Not really, but he does have a lot of work on hand. Even if he hands it all over to someone else, he has to do it well!” Dong Yun said,”also ... Factory manager Xue’s main consideration is that you and I will be in the first batch. There won’t be any company leaders in the second batch. He can also play a leading role in the second batch ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”we’re not kids anymore. Do we still need someone to lead us?” I think he just can’t let go of the pile of things in his hands ... Forget it! He couldn’t attack their enthusiasm. Since he had suggested it, then he would do it! However, tell him that he’s not allowed to work overtime and stay up late. If I find out about this again, I’ll force him to take a leave!”

“Alright!” Dong Yun smiled and said,”Chairman, if there’s nothing else, I’ll go and make the arrangements first.”

“Mm! You go! You’ve worked hard!” Xia ruofei said.

“It’s not hard this time. I don’t feel tired at all when I think of going for a vacation, going to nokapu, and maybe meeting Messi!” Dong Yun said with a smile.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh and said,”then I wish you good luck!” I can arrange for you to meet Wu Lei, but Messi ... No way! Hahaha!”

……

Dong Yun was very efficient. Very soon, the Spanish club’s invitation letter was faxed over. Then, Xia ruofei, Dong Yun, and the first batch of staff to Spain began to process their visas.

Qin Yanan’s team was very professional in handling such matters. After they helped everyone prepare the information, they contacted the Spain consulate in Guangzhou and suggested that everyone go to Guangzhou together because they needed to be there in person to record their fingerprints.

Hence, Xia ruofei flew to Guangzhou with the first batch of employees who were going to Spain and handed in the visa materials at the consulate.

Since there was nothing urgent this time, Xia ruofei did not ask his friends in the capital to help him. After handing in the information, he entered his fingerprint and verified the photo. Then, there was nothing else.

They didn’t stay in Yang Cheng and took a plane back to San Shan that day.

The embassy’s website stated that it would take five to ten working days. Initially, Xia ruofei and the rest thought that they would have to wait for a while. They did not expect to receive a call from the Embassy the next day. This batch of visas had been approved, and their passports had been mailed back to San Shan through ERMS. The Embassy had given them a month’s time. It was more than enough.
