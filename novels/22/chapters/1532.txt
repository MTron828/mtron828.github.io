Chapter 1533: The public bid in Ruizhou (2)

Translator: 549690339

This place looked more like a large warehouse. It looked rather simple and crude. There was no gorgeous decoration. The roof was made of colored steel tiles. No matter how he looked at it, it looked like a simple warehouse. It was very different from what Xia ruofei had imagined.

What gave people a sense of local tyrants was the constant flow of well – dressed people walking into the “warehouse.” In addition, there were seven or eight escort vehicles parked side by side at the door, and even a few sentries holding guns.

Yu mingdong smiled and explained,”these are all gun permits. They were invited by the conference organizer from a security company. After all, some of the raw stones inside are worth a lot!”

At this time, an old man with a head full of silver hair wearing a dark red Tang suit walked towards Yu mingdong from not far away. His face even showed a trace of dissatisfaction,””President Yu, the public Jade bid is about to start. Why are you only here now?”

Yu mingdong smiled and said,”I’m sorry, old he!” I was delayed on the road!”

Then, Yu mingdong immediately introduced,””Mr. Xia, let me introduce you. This is the Honorary Director of the Dian province Jade Association, He Ping, old master he. He’s a stone gambling consultant that I’ve specially invited. Old master he has a lot of experience in the appraisal of raw stones!”

Yu mingdong turned to He Ping.”Elder he, this is Xia ruofei, Mr. Xia. He is a friend of Mr. MA from Hong Kong!”

Initially, He Ping didn’t pay much attention to young people like Xia ruofei, but when he saw Yu mingdong introducing him in such a serious manner, he didn’t think much of it.

However, when he heard Yu mingdong say that Xia ruofei was “Hong Kong’s Mr. Ma’s friend”, he couldn’t help but narrow his eyes. His expression softened a little and he nodded at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei also smiled gently and said,””Old he, please give me your guidance!”

“Mr. Xia, you’re too kind,” He Ping said indifferently.

Even if he was Ma Zhiming’s friend, He Ping wouldn’t show as much enthusiasm as Yu mingdong. He only responded with a sentence and immediately said to Yu mingdong,””President Yu, let’s hurry up and enter the venue! The bidding for the first batch of raw stones today ends at five in the afternoon. We don’t have much time left. ”

“Good, good, good! I’ll leave it to old he later!” Yu mingdong said with a smile.

He was someone who did business, and he paid particular attention to amiability to make money. Moreover, he also knew that experienced stone gambling experts like he Ping were all a little prideful, so he naturally wouldn’t fuss over the problem of the other party’s attitude.

The group of people came to the entrance. After he Ping showed his invitation to the public Jade bid, he also went through a strict security check before he was allowed to enter the public Jade bid.

After entering, Xia ruofei realized that this “warehouse” actually took up a large area. It was much larger than the parking lot at the end of the street. In addition, although the roof was made of colored steel tiles, there were many lighting devices installed, so the entire public square was as bright as day.

As far as the eye could see, rows of black and yellow raw gemstones of different sizes were densely packed, giving the feeling that there was no end in sight.

These raw gemstones were placed in different positions according to their size and appearance. The smaller ones were placed on display, while the larger ones were placed on the ground.

Each raw stone had a number, and in front of them was a bidding box with the same number.

When they entered, everyone received a stack of two – way slips that had been prepared in advance. Each two – way slip was printed with a unique number. If you liked a raw stone, you just had to write your price on the first page of the two – way slip and put it in the bidding box.

After the bidding closed, the lists in the bidding boxes would be counted up immediately, and the highest bidder would naturally obtain the right to purchase the raw stone. At that time, as long as the second of the two lists was used to pay the purchase fee, they would be able to receive the raw stone.

The rules were very simple, but in the face of such a vast amount of raw stones, it was naturally everyone’s eyesight that had to be tested. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Of course, unlike open auctions, this kind of auction also involved psychological games. One had to guess how much the competitor would pay, and at the same time, calculate the price one could afford to give an appropriate price.

Of course, the starting price of the corresponding raw stone was also attached to each bidding box. Any bid lower than this price would naturally be invalid.

There were so many raw stones here that it was impossible to count them. Of course, many of them could produce Jade. After all, the raw stones that could be sent to the public Jade bid were also selected. However, being able to cut out Jade didn’t mean that one could make money. Some of them might not even be worth the starting price, and some of them didn’t even have a single piece of Jade. In the end, it all depended on one’s eyesight.

This was also the reason why experienced stone gambling consultants were so popular. Xia ruofei was lagging behind just now and had secretly asked Shi Lei. Yu mingdong had asked He Ping to help him take a look. The reward for three days was two million. If the raw stones bought increased in value, there would be an additional bonus.

Perhaps it was because Ma Zhiming’s reputation was big enough, but Yu mingdong still attached great importance to Xia ruofei. After entering the public Jade bid, he had been introducing the situation to Xia ruofei.

After all, Xia ruofei’s entrance was like Granny Liu’s entrance to the Grand View Garden. It was obvious that it was her first time at the public Jade bid. He was also worried that Xia ruofei would be affected by the atmosphere and lose everything in the heat of the moment. If that happened, he would have a hard time explaining to Ma Zhiming.

“Mr. Xia, don’t be fooled by the number of people here. In fact, there aren’t many people who are here to’ gamble on stones ‘.” Yu mingdong laughed and said,”most of the people here are in the same line of business in the domestic jade industry. Everyone is here to participate in the public bid to hoard as many raw materials as possible. After all, the price of Jade has been rising in recent years.”

Xia ruofei nodded.”That is to say, even if the price rises, they will keep the Jade that they cut out for themselves.”

“Yup!” Yu mingdong smiled and said,”it’s the same for my company. We’ve always been short on raw materials. We’re counting on old he’s help this time to buy a few more pieces of good material! Otherwise, we’d really be out of stock. ”

While he was chatting with Xia ruofei, he did not forget to flatter He Ping.

The silver – haired He Ping also looked like a master from beyond the world, and he was still indifferent to Yu mingdong’s compliments.

The group walked past many display shelves but did not stop. Xia ruofei asked curiously,””President Yu, there are so many raw gemstones here, Won’t You Be dazzled by the selection?”

Although he did not know much about stone gambling, he had seen it once at the three mountains. Those people who gambled on stones could turn a raw stone over and over for half a day. Even if they were experienced, their efficiency would not be too high!

“This batch of raw stones has already been exhibited for two days. Today is the deadline for the bidding. It can be said that everyone basically already has an idea of which raw stones to choose.” Yu mingdong smiled and said,”we’re just doing a final confirmation in the afternoon. We also need to weigh the strategy of bidding.”

“No wonder ...” Xia ruofei said in his heart. Yu mingdong must have already decided which pieces to compete for, so he and he Ping went straight for their target.

“President Yu, I don’t think the price of this raw stone is low. How will the person who wins the bid trade?” Xia ruofei asked again.

“After the bidding, the qualification to win the bid will be reserved for half an hour. The organizer of the public bid has a special payment office. Cash, credit card, bank transfer, or check are all available!” Yu mingdong said,”the local government supports every public auction. The bank will send people to work on the spot. Precious raw stones can also be directly entrusted to security companies to escort. Even the hospital will send doctors and ambulances over. Every year, there are people who can’t take the public auction because it’s too exciting ...”

Speaking of this, Yu mingdong couldn’t help but laugh.

This was really not a joke. Stone gambling was known as “one knife to the poor, one knife to the rich, one knife to the linen”. It could make a poor person become a millionaire in the blink of an eye, and it could also make tens of millions or hundreds of millions of funds evaporate in an instant. The degree of excitement was no less than real gambling.

After Xia ruofei had a brief understanding of the situation, he had an idea of what was going on. He turned around and looked at the dense raw stones. His heart was burning ...
