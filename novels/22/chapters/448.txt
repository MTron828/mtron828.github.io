Chapter 449: Elder song’s big gift (3)

Of course – occasionally, there would be a head of a central government official who would give a name for – Company. However, such a rare situation would only happen in large central enterprises – if Xia ruofei remembered correctly, this was the first time he had ever given – Name for – private company.

Although there was no signature or seal, this was the real deal!

If the name was used on a farm, an average person might not be able to tell, but how could people of a certain level not tell that it was elder song’s handwriting?

Not only that, Xia ruofei’s company would be called paradise Corporation. He could use the first two words in the name inscribed by elder song on the company’s LOGO, including the company’s exclusive correspondence letters and other places that could be printed with the company’s logo.

This time, even Xia ruofei could not believe it. This gift was too expensive. He was not even confident.

“Xiao Xia, this is ... The chief’s inscribing for your company?” Wu Liqian couldn’t believe her eyes and asked with uncertainty.

Ling Qingxue said excitedly,”RUO Fei, you’re amazing!” If this inscription was used on a company LOGO, it would be ...”

Xia ruofei took a few deep breaths and said,””Calm down, calm down ... I need to confirm first.”

“Yes, yes, yes,” Wu Liqian quickly said.”It’s better to ask clearly.” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

If everyone misunderstood and elder song was only giving Xia ruofei this calligraphy piece as a personal gift, but Xia ruofei used it on the company’s logo, then things would get out of hand.

Xia ruofei did not dare to be careless. He quickly picked up his phone and called manager Lu.

The call went through quickly, and manager Lu’s hearty laughter came from the other end.””Haha, President Xia, I heard that your company is moving to a new building today. Congratulations!”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly,”manager Lu, please don’t make fun of me. What President Xia?” You can just call me little Xia. ”

“Haha, little Xia, I’ve been waiting for your call. My phone never leaves my body!” Manager Lu said with a smile.

“Manager Lu, did you know that I would call?” Xia ruofei asked, stunned.

Manager Lu smiled.”The chief said that you’d definitely call. Xia, you’ve opened the gift the chief gave you, right?”

“Yup! The Bureau chief’s gift ... Is really too precious. ” Xia ruofei said,”I can’t even believe it ...”

“So you called to confirm?” Manager Lu asked with a smile.

Xia ruofei smiled and did not say anything. Manager Lu continued,””Xiao Xia, the chief asked me to tell you that it’s just a piece of calligraphy. He has already given it to you. You can do whatever you want with it. You don’t have to ask for further instructions.”

Although he had already guessed the answer, Xia ruofei still couldn’t help but feel ecstatic. He quickly said,””Thank you, manager Lu! Please help me convey my thanks to the chief. ”

“I’ll definitely pass it on,”manager Lu said with a smile. Xiao Xia, the chief heard that you sent people to Wu Yi mountain to deliver medicine to old Mr. Li every two or three days. He is very pleased and also asked me to tell you that it has been hard on you during this period of time. After old Mr. Li has recovered, he will specially host a banquet to express his gratitude. ”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”you’re too kind, chief. It’s just a small matter. Besides, old Mr. Li is teaching my staff how to make tea. It’s my duty to treat him.”

“Hahaha! That’s what you say, but the only one who can have such a hand of rejuvenation is you, little Xia!” Manager Lu laughed.

When he spoke to Xia ruofei, he didn’t put on the airs of a Deputy Director at all. Besides Xia ruofei’s relationship with elder song, a large part of the reason was Xia ruofei’s superb medical skills.

Anyone who ate grains would fall sick. In the face of an incurable disease, no matter if you were an old farmer with his back facing the earth or a country’s leader, you would still be powerless to save the situation.

To be able to maintain a good relationship with Xia ruofei was like adding a reliable insurance to his health and life!

Xia ruofei and manager Lu chatted for a while and then hung up.

Wu Liqian and Ling Qingxue were still looking at Xia ruofei nervously.

Xia ruofei clenched his fists and said,””We guessed it right. This is the title that the Bureau chief specially gave to the Paradise Corporation. We can use it anywhere!”
