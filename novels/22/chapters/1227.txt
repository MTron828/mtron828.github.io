Chapter 1228: Astonishing profits (1)

With a thought, Xia ruofei returned to the Archean realm in a flash.

Xia ruofei’s round trip took two to three minutes, but more than an hour had passed in the Archean realm.

Although Xia Qing didn’t know why Xia ruofei suddenly left, he was still loyal to his duty and began to spread the 2000 wormgrass on the plastic sheet.

After the Cordyceps sinensis was harvested, it still needed to be dried into dry grass before it could be the final product.

Once Xia ruofei entered the space, he said,””Xia Qing, your next main task is to harvest the Cordyceps in the Cordyceps garden. As long as you have time, go and dig up the Cordyceps. Harvest all the Cordyceps as soon as possible!”

Two mu of land didn’t feel big, but after experiencing it for himself today, Xia ruofei knew that it would take a lot of time to harvest all the aweto.

Because this was a meticulous work, he couldn’t rush it, or else the skin of the wormgrass might be damaged, causing damage.

Even if the Cordyceps were growing in the shallow layer of the earth’s surface, and even if Xia Qing became more and more skilled in her work, and even if she could work 24 hours a day, it would still take one or two months to finish harvesting.

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing had never hesitated to carry out Xia ruofei’s orders.”These Cordyceps are already drying. I’ll go over and continue digging.”

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said,””Wait a moment.”

He scanned the area with his mental energy and quickly found some mesh and iron wires in a corner of the Archean realm. These were the leftovers from the previous time he built the Cordyceps plantation. Xia ruofei casually stored them in his storage space.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and these things flew over and floated in front of him.

“Let’s go!” Xia ruofei said.

Then, with a thought, he disappeared from the Archean realm with Xia Qing, the mesh, iron wires, and buckles. The next moment, they appeared beside the wormgrass nursery in the mountain sea realm.

Xia ruofei’s idea was simple. He wanted to build a small space next to the wormgrass nursery for the bats and moths to live in.

Because Xia Qing had to come over to harvest the Cordyceps at any time, Xia ruofei couldn’t come in to help isolate the bats and moths every time. Xia Qing’s control of space was very limited, so Xia ruofei had to do this personally.

In addition, he also considered that the next step would be to expand the area of the wormgrass cultivation nursery.

Hence, Xia ruofei decided to set up a small area next to the nursery with a mesh net for the bats and moths to live in.

When he expanded the area of the nursery, he would include this area.

In this case, it would be fine even if the bats and moths laid eggs in this “quarantine area” during this time.

Xia ruofei and Xia Qing worked together and quickly set up an isolation area of about five to six square meters, which was completely covered by the gauze.

Xia ruofei lifted the veil of the quarantine area and used the invisible force of space to transfer all the bats and moths in the wormgrass nursery to the quarantine area. Finally, he stuck the veil on it with Magic Tape.

“It’s done. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Xia Qing, it’s been hard on you during this period of time. After you finish the other daily tasks, come and harvest the wormgrass!” Dig out all the wormgrass as soon as possible!”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing said without hesitation. Then, she went into the aweto cultivation nursery and began to work without a word.

Xia ruofei stood outside and said to Xia Qing through the net,””That’s right, pay attention to the time. After the winter Cordyceps in the Archean realm is done drying, remember to inform me immediately!”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing stood up and said respectfully.

“Alright, then you can go back to your work! I’m going out first!”

When Xia ruofei returned to the outside world, the sky was already dark. He had spent almost the entire day in the medium.

Fortunately, the company’s operations were going on as usual, and Feng Jing had left for Hong Kong in advance, so he had some free time.

The phone that he had placed on the table had never rung before. The spirit map space must have blocked the signal of the phone, so Xia ruofei usually did not bring his phone with him when he entered the space. However, he would separate a small portion of his mental energy so that he would be able to detect it immediately if someone accidentally barged in or if his phone vibrated.

His phone had not rung that day. There were only one or two WeChat notifications. Xia ruofei was busy digging up the wormgrass and did not bother with them.

After returning to the bedroom, Xia ruofei picked up his phone and looked at the messages. One was from Ling Qingxue, and the other was from Feng Jing.

There was nothing important, so Ling Qingxue was just casually chatting. Seeing that Xia ruofei was ignoring her, she sent a pouting emoji. Feng Jing gave a brief report on her work in Hong Kong over the past two days.

Xia ruofei replied to both of them on WeChat and found an excuse to explain.

He chatted with Ling Qingxue on WeChat for a while and felt his stomach rumbling with hunger. Yingying hadn’t eaten much the entire day and had only drunk some water from the spirit pond in the space. Even though he had an extraordinary physique, he still felt his stomach growling.

So he told Ling Qingxue, got up, and went downstairs. He opened the refrigerator and rummaged through it.

It was already eight in the evening. Xia ruofei was too lazy to cook, so he found some dumplings and cooked them to fill his stomach. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m
