Chapter 75: Land lease (1)

Not long after Xia ruofei hung up the phone, Wu Liqian called back and told him that she had already contacted him. She asked him to go directly to jianggang town’s Deputy Mayor Wu and send him his phone number through text message. Just as Xia ruofei was about to call Deputy Mayor Wu, he received a call from Xi Jiang Yue’s President Zheng. It turned out that the peach blossom company and the brand registration had been completed. Xia ruofei was overjoyed. He was preparing to rent land and start the construction of the farm! The company was registered just like that. What a timely move! This way, he could directly rent the land under the company’s name. Xia ruofei immediately drove to the West River Moon Club and went to President Zheng to get the company’s registration materials, business license, and other things. President Zheng’s work was very meticulous. He had prepared the company’s official seal, public account, and so on. Considering that Xia ruofei had yet to start a business, he had put the company’s registered address in an office building under his name. In the future, when Xia ruofei had really built the company, he would just have to change the address again. Xia ruofei expressed his gratitude to President Zheng and returned the favor. He said that he could appropriately increase the supply of the Paradise vegetables from next week. He had already expanded the planting in the interspace, and it would not be a problem to increase the supply by ten to twenty percent. President Zheng was overjoyed. He said that he wanted to treat Xia ruofei to dinner and treat him well. However, Xia ruofei still remembered the matter of renting land, so he declined tactfully. After signing a new supply agreement with the West River Moon Club under the name of the Paradise Corporation, Xia ruofei left the West River Moon Club with the relevant documents of his company. Xia ruofei found his pickup truck in the parking lot, but he was not in a hurry to drive. Instead, he took out his phone and called Deputy Mayor Wu. After the call was connected, a reserved voice came from the other end.” “I’m Wu Gang, who’s this?” “Is it Mayor Wu?” Xia ruofei said,”I’m Xia ruofei. Director Wu from the city government asked me to call you!” Once Xia ruofei said the words “director Wu,” Deputy Mayor Wu immediately became enthusiastic and said,” “So it’s Mr. Xia! Hello, hello! Director Wu has already told me about you. There won’t be any problems!” “Mayor Wu, thank you very much,” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “Where? Mr. Xia is too polite. ” Wu Gang said humbly,”after director Wu’s instructions, I immediately went to understand the situation. The land you mentioned is the collective land of Dongkeng village, and it has been barren for several years. You’re willing to invest in a farm there to generate income for Dongkeng village and to support our town’s economic development! We should thank you!” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile. These government officials were really good at talking. The same thing could have two different results when it came to them. No matter which one it was, they could explain it clearly and logically, making people feel that it was really reasonable. The two of them made an appointment to go to the Dongkeng village committee tomorrow morning to settle the land lease. Actually, Wu Gang could have just informed Dong Keng village and let Xia ruofei go there by himself. However, this matter was personally handled by Wu Liqian. There were no secrets in the officialdom. Wu Gang had long heard that Wu Liqian was going to be demoted to the deputy head of Changping County. When the time came, Wu Liqian would be his direct superior. So, Wu Gang did this to show that he valued her. The next day, after sending off the trucks of Xi jiangyue and Ling Ji, Xia ruofei drove to the village council of Dongkeng village, which was not far from the holiday villa. The Deputy Mayor of jianggang town, Wu Gang, had arrived long ago. Wu Gang looked to be in his early thirties. He had a slicked – back hairstyle and had a burly figure. He had the air of a leader. Beside Wu Gang stood a man in his 50s or 60S. He was wearing blue coarse clothes. His face, which had been eroded by the sea breeze, was dark and rough, and full of wrinkles. However, his eyes were very bright, revealing a sense of shrewdness and slyness. Once Xia ruofei got out of the car, he quickly walked over and said,””Mayor Wu, I’m sorry for the delay.” “It’s alright, I just arrived,”said Wu Gang with a smile. Mr. Xia, let me introduce you. This is ruan Fugui, the village director of Dongkeng village. Old ruan, this is Mr. Xia. ” Ruan Fugui quickly wiped his hands on his clothes and reached out to Xia ruofei.””Mr. Xia, nice to meet you!” Xia ruofei shook hands with ruan Fugui and smiled.””Uncle ruan, Mayor Wu should have told you why I’m here, right?” “The mayor said that you’re interested in renting the idle land in our village. This is great news!” Ruan Fugui said,”come in, please!” Let’s talk at the village committee!” The three of them walked into the village council building and ruan Fugui quickly made tea for them. Then, he sat down and said,”Mr. Xia, I’m sure there’s no problem with renting the land to you. It’s idle now.” “However, a few years ago, we approved a piece of land for a house on that piece of land. A house has already been built on it, and the land you want is all around this house ...” Speaking of this, ruan Fugui couldn’t help but look at Wu Gang again. It was very likely that Wu Gang had helped Wu Liqian’s relatives approve this piece of land. Xia ruofei smiled.”That’s not a problem. I’m living in that villa now. I’m planning to build a farm with that villa as the center.” Ruan Fugui immediately heaved a sigh of relief and said,””Then there’s no problem ...” Then, he stood up and took out a map. He pointed it out to Xia ruofei and said,””Mr. Xia, this piece of land has been marked with a red line. We were planning to build a village Farm, but the investment funds were not enough, so the project failed, but the land was also left there. Can you see if there’s any problem with the designated area?” Xia ruofei took the map and looked at it seriously. In the Special Forces, it was basic homework to recognize the map. Moreover, it was a military map that was many times more complicated than this simple map. Hence, Xia ruofei easily found the location of his villa and compared it to the range of the red line. Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”uncle ruan, there is no problem if you go west to the seaside. As for the East ... I’m also very interested in this mountain forest. I want to rent it together with my land. I wonder if the ownership belongs to the village?” Ruan Fugui immediately said,”that mountain forest belongs to the village. It’s just a barren mountain! Some villagers wanted to develop it and plant fruit trees, but it seems that there is a problem with the soil. It is difficult for the fruit trees to survive, and even if they manage to grow, the fruits are sour and astringent, and can’t be eaten at all ... Mr. Xia, do you want to consider it again?” Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s alright. I have another use for this place.” Ruan Fugui had reminded Xia ruofei of his duty, but Xia ruofei had to insist on it. If he lost money in the future, the town leaders wouldn’t blame him. Therefore, he thought for a while and nodded.””Mr. Xia, since you insist on it, I’ll rent it to you as well!”Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))
