Chapter 1710: Chapter 979 – kindness and rebirth (1)

Li Yifu quickly and respectfully explained all the problems he had in his cultivation. Usually, when he cultivated, he basically did it behind closed doors. In addition, his inheritance was incomplete, so when he encountered problems, he could only explore by himself. It could be said that he was suffering beyond words.

Xia ruofei listened carefully. His cultivation was much higher than Li Yifu ‘s, and his inheritance was of a higher level than Li Yifu’ s. Hence, the cultivation problem that had troubled Li Yifu for many years was not a problem to Xia ruofei.

After he heard that, he looked at Li Yifu, who had a fervent look in his eyes. He cleared his throat and said,””Foster husband, I’ll tell you about my cultivation comprehension in response to your question! I hope it’ll be of some help to you ...”

Then, Xia ruofei started his first lecture.

Although there were only two audiences, Xia ruofei still looked solemn. He looked thin and fair, but at this moment, he seemed to be covered in a layer of light.

Li Yifu was instantly immersed in it. Even Tang Haoran, who only understood a little, was quite serious.

Li Yifu was beaming with joy. Actually, many problems in cultivation were due to one’s own limitations. It was as if one had been stuck in a dead end. Every word that Xia ruofei said was like a heavenly sound to him. The cultivation problem that had troubled him for many years was like a layer of window paper that was suddenly pierced through. He felt as if he had suddenly been enlightened.

Time passed by slowly. Li Yifu was completely immersed in this wonderful state. He didn’t even notice that Xia ruofei had stopped his lecture. He was still sitting cross – legged on the ground, his expression constantly changing.

Xia ruofei gave Tang Haoran a look, and the two of them quietly left the tea room.

He knew very well that Li Yifu had gained a lot of insight and was digesting it.

This was undoubtedly a great opportunity for Li Yifu. He had been stuck at Qi disciple Level 3 for so many years and had not made any progress. In fact, he had accumulated a lot of experience. Now that he had received Xia ruofei’s guidance, his cultivation would definitely take a big step forward.

After Xia ruofei and Tang Haoran walked out of the tea room, Tang Yitian immediately came up to them and asked,””Ruofei, where’s Grandpa li?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”He’s enlightened. He’s cultivating. Let’s not disturb him.”

“Alright,” he said. Tang Yitian said. Then, he asked with some confusion,””Aren’t you only allowed to cultivate for four hours a day? Grandpa li ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”my adopted husband has accumulated enough spiritual energy. What he needs is not the accumulation of spiritual energy, but the perception of cultivation.” Big brother Tang, don’t ask so much, you won’t understand even if I tell you!”

Tang Yitian smiled,”Alright! I’d better not ask ...”

He could already feel how lucky Xia ruofei was to have accepted Tang Haoran as his disciple.

Not to mention other things, just the fact that Tang Haoran’s seniority was one generation higher than Li Yifu was already scary enough.

Moreover, Li Yifu had mentioned that Tang Haoran’s cultivation progress was also frighteningly fast. His future achievements were simply limitless.

His gratitude for Xia ruofei grew even stronger.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”big brother Tang, you’ve reminded me ...”

“What?” Tang Yitian asked in confusion.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Haoran, come. I’ve prepared a gift for you.”

Tang Haoran’s Black eyes widened and he said happily,”Master! What good stuff is it?”

“Haoran, master gave it to you and you dare to take it!” Tang Yitian said from the side,”you should be filial to your master!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand with a smile.”Big brother Tang, it’s natural for a master to teach his disciple. I can’t be by Haoran’s side all the time. It’s my duty to provide him with some cultivation resources!”

Then, he put his hand into his pocket and took out a spirit crystal from the medium. He handed it to Tang Haoran and said with a smile,”Take it! This is master’s gift to you!”

Tang Haoran’s eyes brightened as he took the spirit crystal.””Master, the spiritual Qi is so dense!”

“Spiritual energy?” Tang Yitian couldn’t help but take the crystal from Tang Haoran’s hands. He played with it for a while and said,”why can’t I feel it? If you didn’t tell me, I would have thought that it was a piece of crystal!”

Xia ruofei laughed,”if you can feel it, you can cultivate like Haoran!” Big brother Tang, please return it to Haoran! These spirit crystals are only useful for cultivators!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The spirit crystal contained a terrifying amount of spirit Qi, and the amazing thing was that this spirit Qi was completely contained inside the spirit crystal, not a trace of it dissipated. Tang Yitian naturally couldn’t feel the magic within it, but Tang Haoran had already stepped into the peak of Qi disciple Level 1, so he naturally felt the rich spirit Qi in it as soon as he held it in his hand.

“Master ... Is this really for me?” Tang Haoran held the spirit crystal tightly and asked with some uncertainty.

Xia ruofei smiled and replied,”of course!” Was there anyone who would go back on the things that their master had given out? Don’t worry! I have more of these crystals, and I’ve prepared this one for you!”

Xia ruofei continued,”with this spiritual crystal, you don’t have to cultivate for four hours every day. You can absorb the spiritual energy from the spiritual crystal to cultivate at any time.” The spiritual energy contained in this spiritual crystal should be enough for you to cultivate to Qi disciple Level 5 and above!”
