Chapter 1474: It’s difficult for an honest official to resolve family affairs (2)

Translator: 549690339

Compared to Zhuang Yan and his wife’s work, Zhuang Cheng and Yao NA’s work was much more glamorous.

Working in the Ministry of Finance, which had a lot of power, was like heaven and earth compared to the cultural relics Bureau, which only had a cup of tea and a piece of newspaper every day.

Moreover, Zhuang Yan was very honest, so the status of the young couple at home was much lower than that of their brother and sister – in – Law.

Yao NA’s father used to be the head of the finance Bureau and had retired. However, Yao na came from a well – to – do family, so she looked down on Xu Yuanyuan, who came from an ordinary working family.

This time, after Zhuang Yan and Xu Yuanyuan had put in a good word for her, Yao na reluctantly agreed to help to make some connections.

Zhuang Cheng and Yao na worked in the finance Bureau and had a wide range of friends. Today, they had an appointment with Wang yaokun, the Deputy Director of the Cultural Affairs Bureau, through Jiang Bin, the Deputy Director of the finance department.

The cultural relics Bureau was a secondary Bureau under the cultural relics Bureau. Generally speaking, the director of the cultural relics Bureau was the Deputy Director of the cultural relics Bureau.

Although Wang yaokun was not in charge of the cultural relics Bureau, he was also a member of the cultural relics Bureau, just like the director of the cultural relics Bureau. He was obviously quite powerful.

If Wang yaokun was willing to put in a good word for her, then the cultural relics Bureau would not have any resistance to Xu Yuanyuan’s test.

Of course, whether or not she could get in would still depend on Xu Yuanyuan’s own strength.

For Xu Yuanyuan, the unit test was the most difficult. She was not afraid to take the exam based on her own ability.

On the other side, Yao na saw Xu Yuanyuan talking to Song Wei. She couldn’t help but frown and say,””Yuanyuan, the leader will be here soon. Come over first!”

“Oh ...” Xu Yuanyuan said. She then turned to Song Wei and said apologetically,”Weiwei, I’ll go now ...”

After Yao na finished speaking, she muttered to Zhuang Yan, who was beside her,”Yuanyuan, how can you be so blind? He’s talking to me about something important ... He’s obviously a country bumpkin who has never seen the world ...”

Zhuang Yan turned around awkwardly to look at Song Wei and Xu Yuanyuan. Seeing that there was still some distance between them and they probably couldn’t hear Yao na, he heaved a sigh of relief.

However, Zhuang Yan did not expect that Xia ruofei had heard every single word of Yao na ‘s.

He frowned slightly and looked at Xu Yuan Yuan, then at Zhuang Yan. After thinking for a while, he held back and didn’t say anything. It wasn’t easy for Xu Yuan Yuan to begin with, so he didn’t want to make things difficult for her.

Song Wei also walked to Xia ruofei’s side. She saw that Xia ruofei’s expression was not good and could not help but ask,”RUO Fei, what’s wrong?”

Xia ruofei looked at Yao na, who was not far away, and said softly,””It’s nothing. Your classmate’s crickets have a foul mouth ...”

Song Wei knew that Xia ruofei must have heard Yao NA’s words. She smiled and said,”Forget it ... Don’t lower yourself to her level ... I want to help Yuanyuan ...” He said.

“Okay, I’ll give uncle song’s Secretary a call later!” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

To song Zhengping’s Secretary, this was a task of zero difficulty. He didn’t even need to personally handle it.

At that moment, a group of three people walked into the hotel lobby from the revolving door. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Yao na, who had been extremely arrogant just now, instantly put on a bright smile on her cold face. She directly left Zhuang Yan and Xu Yuanyuan behind and quickly walked up to them.

“Director Jiang, chief Wang, welcome!” Yao na said with a smile.

Xia ruofei and Song Wei looked at each other when they saw Yao NA’s overly enthusiastic attitude.

Xia ruofei was speechless at her ability to change her face.

Director Jiang was a man in his 30S. He wore a pair of high – myopia glasses and looked like an intellectual. Bureau chief Wang’s figure was a bit out of shape. His big belly simply made him look like a standard bureaucrat.

Beside them was a man in his early thirties. He looked a little similar to Zhuang Yan. He was Zhuang Yan’s brother, Zhuang Cheng.

Director Jiang also smiled when he saw Yao na. He said to director Wang,””Chief Wang, this is Yao na, the Deputy Director of the Tanzhou Finance Bureau. She’s a well – known strong woman in our province’s finance system!”

“Director Jiang, you’re too kind!” “Director Wang, it’s an honor to meet you!” Yao na said with a smile.

Director Wang squinted at Yao na with a smile on his face. He extended his hand to Yao na and said,”Associate Chief physician Yao, Hello!”

Yao na quickly extended her hands to shake director Wang ‘s. Director Wang seemed to be in a daze as he held Yao NA’s smooth hands. It was obvious that they were shaking hands for a longer time than usual.

Zhuang Cheng’s expression only froze for a moment, but he quickly recovered.

Seeing that director Wang had let go of Yao NA’s hand, Zhuang Cheng heaved a sigh of relief and quickly said,””Leaders, the private room is ready. Please come in!”

Yao na looked at Zhuang Yan and Xu Yuanyuan, who had followed them over. She had no intention of introducing them, but directly said,””Zhuang Yan, Yuanyuan, quickly go to the private room and inform the waiter to serve the dishes! What are you doing?”

“Oh!” The honest Zhuang Yan quickly said and pulled Xu Yuan Yuan to the stairs.

Shu Yuan Yuan could only turn around and look at Song Wei with an apologetic expression.

Song Wei smiled and waved at Xu Wanwan. Then, she made a phone call gesture.

Xia ruofei and Song Wei looked at Yao na and her husband, who were leading director Jiang and director Wang up the stairs, and shook their heads.

“Let’s go!” Xia ruofei said,”let’s go eat first. If Xu Yuan Yuan’s case is successful, then we’ll forget about it. If not, then we’ll just help her again. ”

“En!” Song Wei sighed and said,”Yuanyuan is too honest! All of us are supposed to be equal, but this Yao na is acting like she’s an elder and is so overbearing. I’m not happy to see her like this!”

“You can’t meddle in other people’s family affairs!” Xia ruofei said,”anyway, she’s living with Zhuang Yan. I can see that Zhuang Yan is still very good to her.”

“If Zhuang Yan doesn’t treat her well, then she’s really living in deep water and fire!” Song Wei said,”let’s not talk about this anymore. Let’s eat first!”

The two of them walked to the buffet restaurant again, registered at the door, and went in.

After a simple dinner, Xia ruofei and Song Wei did not return to their rooms. Instead, they went to the hotel lobby to sit on the sofa and chat.

They were going to ask about the situation after Xu Yuanyuan came out. If she couldn ‘t, they would help her talk to Yao na and get this done so that she wouldn’t have to smile at Yao na.

In a private room on the second floor, the atmosphere was very lively.

However, Xu Yuanyuan was not used to it. As she looked at Zhuang Cheng and Yao na, who kept toasting to the two leaders, she felt at a loss for what to do in this kind of situation.

Unfortunately, her husband, Zhuang Yan, was also an honest man. He did not know anything about these social activities. In Yao NA’s words, Zhuang Yan was a nerd.

Xu Yuanyuan even saw director Wang stroking the back of Yao NA’s hand when he was talking to her, which made her want to leave immediately.

More importantly, Yao na and Zhuang Cheng didn’t even mention helping to approve the postgraduate entrance examination. Instead, they talked to director Jiang about their financial system.

Yao na also asked director Jiang to take care of Zhuang Cheng. It seemed that there would be a group of financial system cadres selected from all over the province coming to the provincial Office for an exchange and replacement. Yao na was also actively fighting for this opportunity for Zhuang Cheng.

Xu Yuanyuan couldn’t help but feel a little bitter. Yao na said that she was working for them, but in the end, she didn’t say a word.

One had to know that this meal was paid for by Xu Yuan Yuan and Zhuang Cheng. One meal would cost the couple a month’s salary. Just thinking about it made Xu Yuan Yuan’s heart ache.

“Sister – in – Law, can you tell chief Wang about me ...” Xu Yuanyuan whispered to Yao na while she was toasting.
