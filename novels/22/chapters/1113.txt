Xia ruofei’s heart warmed. He knew that elder song was doing this for his sake. If word of this got out, it would bring a lot of trouble. Even some special departments in the country might be alerted.

Of course, Xia ruofei dared to reveal his situation to elder song because he had some confidence.

Not only did he have the spirit map space, but he was also a cultivator who had stepped onto the path of cultivation. Moreover, he was a powerful cultivator who cultivated both true Qi and mental power at the same time. He had a lot of resources at his disposal, and his strength would steadily improve in the future.

It could be said that Xia ruofei already had a certain level of strength.

Besides, Xia ruofei trusted elder song. He had saved elder song’s life and had a close relationship with the song family. That was why he dared to reveal to elder song that he had some tricks that ordinary people could not.

“Thank you, chief.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Xiao Xia, if I remember correctly ... Your parents and elders are no longer alive?” elder song waved his hand.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yeah!” My relatives are gone, but I have a godmother now. She’s the mother of one of my comrades who sacrificed herself. I’m taking care of them now. ”

Elder song’s eyes revealed a hint of praise as he said,”What a good child ...”

Then, with a kind smile, eccentric song said,””Xiao Xia, I’ve always treated you as a junior in my family. In the future, don’t call me chief, just call me Grandpa song! I’ll call you Ruo Fei, okay?”

Song Zhilan and song Rui, who were standing at the side, couldn’t help but be slightly stunned. Elder song was planning to acknowledge them as God – relatives!

Elder song used to favor Xia ruofei, but he was still an outsider. Hearing the old man’s tone tonight, he was treating Xia ruofei like his own grandson.

Xia ruofei’s heart felt warm. He nodded without hesitation and said,””Okay, Grandpa song!”

Eccentric song revealed a gratified smile and said,”Woof! Good child, we’ll all be your family in the future. Xiao Rui is like a brother to you!”

Song Rui was also a little excited. He patted Xia ruofei’s shoulder lightly.

Xia ruofei knew that elder song had always admired him. This time, the relationship between the two families had become closer. It was also related to the new strength that he had displayed.

It wasn’t that elder song was snobbish, but that he was thinking about the long term.

Xia ruofei’s extraordinary power was beneficial to the development of the song family. However, elder song was more concerned about the country and society.

Xia ruofei was an orphan. Although he had been educated by the party and the military for many years, he was still a person who was not part of the system. He obviously had a strong power that was beyond everyone’s understanding. If he was not kind – hearted, he could become a disaster for the country and society. 1

Acknowledging him as God – relative would be beneficial to the development of the family. At the same time, it could give Xia ruofei family warmth. Even if Xia ruofei really went against the country in the future, with his relationship with elder song, he might be tied down.

Xia ruofei was not stupid. He understood elder song’s plan. However, he was not an extreme person. He would not bring disaster to society just because he had a strong power. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Moreover, elder song did not know that Xia ruofei could make ‘magical weapons’. Elder song had been very kind to him, so Xia ruofei did not have any negative feelings towards him. On the contrary, he admired elder song’s National sentiments.

“Grandpa song, don’t worry. No matter how capable I am, I’m still a descendant of the Chinese and I used to be a soldier. I’ll never forget that.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Elder song patted Xia ruofei’s shoulder and said,””Good, good, good! RUO Fei, I know you’re a good kid ...”

Elder song was very happy tonight. He was also nourished by the spiritual energy gathered by the Jade Guanyin, so he was in good spirits.

However, Xia ruofei considered the fact that he was an 80 – year – old man and should rest early at night. So, after chatting with the old man for a while, he bid farewell.

Elder song wanted Xia ruofei to stay the night at the song family’s old residence, but Xia ruofei politely declined.

Instead, song Rui took the opportunity to say,”Grandpa, I haven’t seen ruofei in a long time. Why don’t ... I stay in his hotel tonight?” I still want to have a good chat with him!”

If it was in the past, elder song would have lectured song Rui if he wanted to stay the night. But today, he agreed readily.

“Alright,” elder song nodded and said,”you two brothers should get closer. Xiao Rui! These two days, you’ve been accompanying RUO Fei around the capital. Also, don’t you have a lot of friends in the capital? Introduce a few more to RUO Fei!”

Elder song was trying to build up connections for Xia ruofei.

Song Rui was overjoyed and quickly said,””Alright, don’t worry, Grandpa! I’ll definitely treat RUO Fei well!”

“Hmph!” Elder song snorted and said,”introduce more reliable friends to RUO Fei. Don’t bring RUO Fei to the useless Zheng family!”

The old Zheng family that elder song was talking about was also a powerful family in the capital. However, the eldest grandson of the Zheng family, Zheng tianbing, was a devil incarnate. He indulged in debauchery all day long and had even harmed many young girls from good families. In the past two days, he had even been covered in drugs and had basically flown away. People in the circle could not help but shake their heads when they talked about him.
