2542 Expedition_2

The team took a business jet – every time Spain had an away expedition, the club would basically book a business jet to reduce the fatigue of the journey as much as possible – there would not be any disturbance from other passengers on the same plane – and the players could get as much rest as possible.

The distance between Barcelona and Valencia was not far. They only flew for slightly more than an hour before the plane began to lower its altitude.

After Valencia landed, many home fans went to the airport to “pick her up”. When the Spanish club players came out, the crowd immediately burst into loud boos, and some people kept provoking her with words.

Most of the players on this trip were experienced and knowledgeable old players. They had seen this kind of formation many times, and the boos of the fans had no effect on them at all. As for Wu Lei and Xia ruofei, Wu Lei could not understand what the fans were saying and was not affected much. As for Xia ruofei, he was naturally a big – hearted person. This kind of scene could not stir up any waves in his heart.

Under the “protection” of the airport security personnel, the team quickly left the airport, got on the bus arranged by the club’s advance staff, and went straight to the hotel they were staying.

Along the way, Xia ruofei looked out of the car window with interest.

Valencia was the third largest city in Spain. It was located in the southeast of Spain and was close to the sea on the East. With its back facing the vast plains, it was evergreen all year round and had a pleasant climate. It was known as the “Pearl on the West Coast of the Mediterranean Sea” and also the “Sunshine City” of Europe.

From the airport to the hotel, Xia ruofei saw the exotic scenery along the way. He could not help but take pictures with his phone. He could not stop.

Xia ruofei and Wu Lei were assigned to a standard room. The club had initially arranged a single room or even a suite for Xia ruofei, but Xia ruofei felt that he was here as a player today, so he did not want to make it special.

If Xia ruofei had come as a shareholder of the club, it would be reasonable for him to stay in any luxurious room. However, now that he was positioning himself as an ordinary player, he could not be given special treatment.

Considering that Wu Lei had not mastered Spanish yet, Xia ruofei asked the staff to put him and Wu Lei in the same room to prevent him from staring at his teammates and not being able to communicate.

After they arrived in Valencia and checked into the hotel, Ruby quickly organized the players to go to the rented venue for pre – Match training. At the same time, he also arranged for them to check out the Mestalla Stadium, where the game would be held the next day, and so on.

The Espanyol club’s official television station also sent people to Valencia on the same plane. While the players were training, they had already begun to shoot some highlights.

However, after Xia ruofei’s special greeting, the cameras also deliberately avoided him.

Soon, it was the next day.

Espanyol would be playing against the home team, Valencia, at the Mestalla Stadium today.

On the way from the hotel to mestalia Stadium, Xia ruofei saw many fans rushing to the stadium. In fact, it was still too early for the fans. There were still a few hours before the game kicked off! However, these fans seemed to be celebrating a Festival. Some of them even waved the team’s scarves and sang and danced. The atmosphere was quite warm.

After Xia ruofei saw it, he couldn’t help but feel a little envious. It wasn’t that the moon was rounder in foreign countries, but objectively speaking, the atmosphere of the fans in Europe was really good.

When the team bus arrived at the stadium, there were also many reporters waiting there. Xia ruofei even saw a few Chinese reporters through the window.

Xia ruofei had already put on a disguise. He mixed in with the coaching staff and walked into the court with his teammates. Since Jian Jia had decided to remain mysterious, she might as well stay mysterious to the end. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

In the changing room, Ruby announced the starting list for today’s match. The list had just been submitted to the official team, and Ruby had kept the suspense until the last moment.

To Wu Lei’s slight disappointment, Ruby had put him on the bench list for this game.

Xia ruofei was not in the starting lineup either.

Replacing Wu Lei in the starting lineup was puado, who had been promoted from the youth team this season.

When pouado heard his name in the starting lineup, he was stunned for a moment before he was overjoyed. He couldn’t wait to perform well in the game. When he thought of his speed in the wings and the scene of him running past several players, pouado was so excited that he trembled.

He wanted Ruby to see that he was at least one level stronger than Wu Lei, Xia ruofei!

The players went to the field to warm up. Xia ruofei went straight to the away team’s substitutes ‘bench and sat down at the side. He was wearing a club – made coat and pulled up the hat to cover half of his face. He leaned there and took a nap.

The coaching staff and staff were also doing their preparations on the bench. They saw Xia ruofei dozing off on the bench, but no one came out to remind him. Anyway, Xia ruofei was playing as a substitute, so it didn’t matter if he didn’t warm up at this time as long as he warmed up before the game.

The broadcaster’s camera had been filming the entire process from the arrival of the team bus to the warm – up of the stadium. The broadcasting team would edit the material into short tidbits such as the team’s arrival and the team’s warm – up at the fastest speed and broadcast it on the live broadcast before the start of the game.

However, Xia ruofei had always wrapped himself up tightly. Although the camera caught him a few times, it was just a flash and the people watching the TV could not see who he was.

The players returned to the locker room after their warm – up. The head coach had to make tactical arrangements at the end. The substitutes, including Wu Lei, followed them back to the locker room. However, Xia ruofei did not go back. He leaned on the substitutes ‘bench and even started to snore.

……

Outside the stadium, a group of Chinese people was slowly moving forward in the crowd.

They were the Paradise employees led by Xue Jinshan. Under Zhou leiyun’s arrangement, they had come to Valencia yesterday to visit the famous Spain coastal city.

Today, the staff that Zhou leiyun had sent to accompany them throughout the tour had brought everyone to play for the entire day. When night had just fallen, they had brought them to the Mestalla Stadium.

Although it was an away game, it was not a problem for the Spanish club to come forward and ask for a few tickets.

After a long queue, Xue Jinshan and the others finally entered the stadium. They slowly walked along with the crowd and finally came to the stands reserved for the visiting team.

Many Expeditionary fans of the Spanish clubs had also arrived. They hung a huge Tiffany on the side of the stands, with the Spanish team emblem and the picture of the legendary Captain Dani Halk.

After Xue Jinshan and the others entered the stands, they immediately took off their jackets and put on the Spanish club’s off – Field version of the jerseys that they had prepared in advance.

The number of these jerseys were all number 24, which was exactly the same as the clothes Wu Lei wore in the game.

The staff sent by Zhou leiyun had also prepared a small national flag for everyone.

It was clear that they were only cheering for Wu Lei.

Soon, the Spanish fans also noticed this group of Asian people. When they saw the Jersey numbers on the backs of Xue Jinshan and the others, as well as the large posters of Wu Lei they were holding, they immediately understood that they were Wu Lei’s Chinese compatriots.

Many Spanish fans greeted Xue Jinshan and the others and gave them a thumbs – up.

One could only speak Chinese, and his English was also very poor. On the other side, most of the people spoke Spanish.

But there was one common word, and that was Wu Lei’s name.

Therefore, when Xue Jinshan and the others found that they could not communicate with the Spanish fans around them, they simply shouted Wu Lei’s name, which they could also understand.

The Spanish fans also shouted Wu Lei’s name one after another, as if they were exchanging signals.

Wu Lei, who was still warming up on the field, heard his name in the noisy singing of Valencia’s fans and could not help but look at the away team’s stands.
