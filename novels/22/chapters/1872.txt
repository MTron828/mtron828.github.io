Translator: 549690339

Zeng jianzhang took a deep breath and said,””How did this happen? You guys haven’t been in contact with the Paradise Corporation, have you?”

“This company is very arrogant. The county party Committee took the initiative to contact them and said that they hoped that the two sides could meet as soon as possible. However, they rejected the offer by saying that they had just moved their headquarters and were busy!” Liu haojun said angrily,”that’s just an excuse! They’re so busy, why did they go to Qingyuan City for an inspection?”

“Could it be that they think that we, Changping, have been too slow?” Zeng jianzhang was puzzled.”It’s not that bad! The first thing we did was to call the Standing Committee to study it. After the meeting, we immediately contacted the other party! I can’t say that this efficiency is the best in the country, but at least it’s not slow ...”

Liu haojun couldn’t help but say,””Secretary Zeng, I suspect that someone on our side is sabotaging this matter! Perhaps some of our comrades are dissatisfied with the organization’s decision, so they colluded with the Paradise company and came up with this show!”

Although Liu haojun didn’t name Wu Liqian directly, it was no different from naming her by name.

Zeng jianzhang couldn’t help but feel a little sick of it.

So it’s natural for you to unreasonably snatch away the project that others are discussing, but can’t they be a little dissatisfied?

Moreover, Zeng jianzhang also believed in Wu Liqian’s political awareness. She would definitely not ignore the overall development of the county just to vent her dissatisfaction.

From this point of view, Wu Liqian was 800 times nobler than Liu haojun! nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Zeng jianzhang had been quite critical of Liu haojun bypassing him and Zhu zhihang and directly using his connections with the higher – ups to suppress the issue. This was not only disrespectful to him as the Secretary, but also a very bad example for the unity of the team.

As the class monitor, he had to clean up the mess for Liu haojun, as well as persuade Wu Liqian.

Now that Liu haojun had snatched the project as he wished, and the peach blossom company had withdrawn, he had come here to complain.

Am I your nanny? Zeng jianzhang cursed in his heart.

Zeng jianzhang looked down on ignorant and incompetent second generation like Liu haojun.

However, Zeng jianzhang had long become a sly old fox in the system, so he naturally wouldn’t show these emotions. He just smiled and said,””Comrade haojun, these are all conjectures without evidence. It’s fine to say it here, but you have to be careful when you leave this office! Such words can easily cause disunity in the team ...”

“Secretary Zeng! I really can’t think of any other reason besides this!” Liu haojun didn’t give in and said,”Tao Yuan company took the initiative to find our Changping County to express their intention to invest. Moreover, their farm is still here. This time, it’s also to integrate resources, and even the farm is planned together. The two sides haven’t even come into contact once, and yet they’ve changed their plans. This doesn’t make sense at all!”

No matter how good Zeng jianzhang’s self – restraint was, he couldn’t help but ask with a slight frown,””Then what do you mean? How should he deal with it? We can’t just mete out punishment to County Head Wu for such a baseless reason, right?”

“Secretary Zeng, I didn’t say that I would punish her ...” Liu haojun said.”Besides, it’s useless to punish her! I think the most important thing now is to resume negotiations with the Paradise Corporation as soon as possible. As for County Head Wu ...”

“I understand what you mean ...” Zeng jianzhang waved his hand and said.

Liu haojun just didn’t want to give up this bright political achievement, but at the same time, he couldn’t bring himself to look for Wu Liqian. Now that the relationship between the two was so stiff, even if he were to go to her, Wu Liqian would definitely ignore him.

Therefore, Liu haojun wanted to put pressure on Wu Liqian through Zeng jianzhang.

Zeng jianzhang couldn’t help but curse in his heart,”this grandson is too much!”

However, Zeng jianzhang also attached great importance to the Tao Yuan pharmaceutical factory project. Now that such an unexpected situation had occurred, he also hoped to resolve it as soon as possible.

Talking to Wu Liqian was obviously one of the most effective ways.

Although he believed that Wu Liqian wouldn’t do one thing in front of him and do another behind his back, there was always a possibility. In addition, even if Wu Liqian didn’t deliberately expose him, at least Wu Liqian had some say in the peach blossom company. It was better to let her understand the situation than to blindly mess around on her own side.

Zeng jianzhang looked at Liu haojun, who was looking at him expectantly, and said indifferently,””I will understand the situation first. Comrade haojun, you can go back first! I hope that you can take responsibility and take the initiative to communicate effectively with the Paradise Corporation. If there are any problems, you have to find the reason yourself!”

Zeng jianzhang’s words were a little harsh. Liu haojun’s face turned red and white, and a hint of hostility flashed in his eyes.

Liu haojun was born with a silver spoon in his mouth and had been working in the Ministry before. He had long developed a supercilious character. He looked down on Zeng jianzhang, an old comrade who had been working in the Ministry for more than ten years. There were many division and Bureau – Level cadres in the Ministry, including the inspectors. Compared to them, what was Zeng jianzhang?

However, Liu haojun still needed Zeng jianzhang’s help to solve this problem, so he didn’t dare to show his dissatisfaction. He could only lower his head and say,””I know, Secretary Zeng! I’ll go back first then ...”

Zeng jianzhang was a wily old fox in the officialdom. How could he not see through Liu haojun’s true thoughts? Therefore, he only nodded slightly and lowered his head to read the documents.
