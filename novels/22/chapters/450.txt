Chapter 451: The beautiful County Head (2)

After he was done with the calligraphy, Xia ruofei smiled and invited Wu Liqian and Ling Qingxue to the reception area of the office to sit down. Then, he personally made tea for the two beautiful ladies.

Although Xia ruofei’s office had just been tidied up, it had everything that should be there. The small refrigerator next to the coffee table even had high – quality tea leaves, black tea, green tea, and white tea. These were all prepared by Liang Weimin’s people in advance.

From these details, it could be seen that Liang Weimin was very concerned about Xia ruofei’s matter.

Wu Liqian took a sip of tea from her teacup and asked,””Xiao Xia, now that your farm has taken shape, do you have any plans for the future?”

Xia ruofei skillfully poured a cup of tea for Ling Qingxue, then smiled and said,””I do have short – term goals. For example, the production of the vegetable greenhouses has not reached its maximum capacity yet, so I’m going to recruit a new batch of workers. In addition, the efficiency of the farm is not high, including the fish pond in the South that has been idle. In addition to the orchards, there are still many lands in the back mountain that can be further developed and utilized.”

“Sis Wu, do you have any good suggestions?” Xia ruofei asked.

Wu Liqian had been working for Tian Huilan for many years and was now the executive Deputy County Head. Although she didn’t have much experience in the business world, she was very familiar with the economy. Xia ruofei wanted to hear her opinion.

Wu Liqian pondered for a moment and said,””First of all, you said that we can increase production and further improve farm efficiency. These are all good ideas. But I think we can be a little more daring. ”

“Oh? What do you mean?” Xia ruofei asked with interest.

Wu Liqian did not answer Xia ruofei’s question immediately. Instead, she asked,””Little Xia, the vegetables, melons, and fruits produced by your farm should be very popular, right?”

Xia ruofei nodded.”We don’t have to worry about sales at the moment. I have three regular partners: lingji F & B, Xijiang Moon Club, and Hong Kong’s Hengfeng group. Even if the production capacity of the greenhouse reaches its limit, my three partners can still take in the production.”

“It’s just as I expected,”Wu Liqian said with a smile. So my first suggestion is ... To further expand the scale of the farm and build more vegetable greenhouses. I can see that there are still a lot of unclaimed lands around your farm, which are useless in the village. You can expand the scale of your farm to twice or even thrice its current size. ”

“Should we continue to expand the farm?” Xia ruofei asked after some hesitation. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

In fact, Xia ruofei was not very willing to do this. Although the current scale of the farm was not large, the benefits it had created had exceeded many large farms. Besides, Xia ruofei felt that although he could earn a lot of profits from selling ordinary Peach Orchard vegetables, which was enough to make most people jealous, he did not think much of the rate of return.

He had the spirit map space in his hands, so it would be a waste to manage these ordinary vegetables and fruits.

Wu Liqian seemed to have read Xia ruofei’s mind. She smiled and said,”Xiao Xia, your Taoyuan vegetables are indeed very well – known now, but you only supply to three companies. If ordinary people want to eat Taoyuan vegetables, they can only choose Ling Ji restaurant or Xijiang Yue club ...”

At this point, Wu Liqian looked at Ling Qingxue and said with a smile,””Qingxue, I’m not saying that your Ling’s restaurant isn’t good!”

Ling Qingxue giggled and said,”big sis Wu, I know.” You can continue!”

Naturally, Ling Qingxue would not be unhappy that Wu Liqian was trying to help Xia ruofei. Besides, girls were more inclined to outsiders. Even if Ling Ji restaurant and Peach Blossom Farm had a conflict of interest, she was still on Xia ruofei’s side.

Wu Liqian smiled and continued,””Xiao Xia, your products are indeed in short supply now, but your current business model is not very beneficial for you to further expand your reputation and reach the province or even the country’s reputation. You should further expand your supply range so that customers can see your paradise vegetables in more restaurants and even supermarkets. ”

In all fairness, Wu Liqian’s suggestion was not good for Ling’s restaurant.

Because West River Moon club’s target customers were the upper – Class society, the peach blossom vegetables that was being sold to the general public in San Shan city was almost monopolized by Ling Ji restaurant.

Just this alone would bring in a large number of consumers for Ling Ji restaurant.

If the supply range was expanded, this monopoly situation would no longer exist.

After Xia ruofei heard Wu Liqian’s words, he felt a little enlightened. He had always adhered to the high – Quality product route. He had put in a lot of effort in the early stages to build up the ordinary vegetable and fruit markets. It was nothing more than to increase the reputation of paradise Corporation. Therefore, after Wu Liqian’s reminder, he immediately realized the disadvantages of his previous business model.

In this day and age, even the fragrance of wine was afraid of the depths of the alley!

The Ling’s restaurant was based in San Shan city, and its influence was limited to the southeast province at most.

This was indeed not very beneficial to rapidly expanding the reputation of paradise Corporation.

However, Xia ruofei was still a little hesitant, mainly because he was considering the impact of expanding the supply range on Ling Ji F & B.

Wu Liqian seemed to have guessed Xia ruofei’s concerns. She smiled and said,””I know that Ling’s restaurant is Qingxue’s family’s company, and the expansion of the supply range will inevitably affect the operations of Ling’s restaurant. However, I don’t think the impact is as big as you think, and it’s still controllable. For example, you can use a tiered system to give lingji a more favorable price, or even directly increase the delivery unit price of new partners. I’m sure that with the cost advantage and the fact that Ling Ji is a very strong chain restaurant, it shouldn’t be unable to compete with other restaurants in the same industry, right?”
