Chapter 20: Alarming the Mayor

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

When Professor Tian saw Tian Huilan, a trace of displeasure appeared on his face.

“Huilan, talk to them. There’s nothing wrong with my health. Let me discharge from the hospital immediately!”

Tian Huilan looked troubled.

“Dad! You can’t underestimate heart problems. Let’s listen to the doctor!”

After saying that, Tian Huilan shot Director He a look.

Director He quickly understood and stepped forward to say.

“Professor Tian, acute myocardial infarction is not a small illness. Although there are no major problems with your examination now, to be safe, you still have to stay in the hospital for observation for a day or two. If the condition changes, we can deal with it in time…”

The middle-aged doctor who had been accompanying Professor Tian also said.

“Professor Tian, from the results of the examination, although we haven’t found any serious problems for the time being, we still need to organize an expert consultation. If you leave the hospital rashly now, there might be unpredictable dangers!”

Professor Tian shook his head helplessly and said.

“I know my own body… Forget it, forget it… I’ll just stay in the hospital!” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Professor Tian also knew very well that with his daughter’s status, the hospital would definitely not discharge him so rashly. If anything really happened, they would not be able to bear the responsibility.

He was already mentally prepared when he informed Tian Huilan.

If it weren’t for the fact that he had something else for her to do, Professor Tian definitely wouldn’t have alerted his daughter.

Seeing that her father’s tone had softened, Tian Huilan heaved a sigh of relief. She was about to ask about her father’s condition in detail when Professor Tian spoke again.

“Huilan, come in with me for a moment. I need to talk to you.”

“Oh… sure!”

Tian Huilan replaced the female nurse and personally pushed the wheelchair into the ward.

Director He and the others naturally wouldn’t be so insensible as to follow them in. They all stood at the door and waited.

Tian Huilan closed the ward door and turned around.

“Dad, why did you go out alone again? Didn’t I ask Little Shen to follow you? Fortunately, it didn’t lead to serious consequences this time. Otherwise…”

Professor Tian waved his hand and said.

“Let’s not talk about this anymore. Huilan, I called you here because I have something for you to do!”

“Go ahead,” Tian Huilan said quickly, pretending to listen carefully.

Tian Huilan knew that her father had always kept a low profile. Apart from some old colleagues in the university, very few people knew that he was Mayor Tian’s father. If he hadn’t taken the initiative to call her this time, the doctors at the City People’s Hospital definitely wouldn’t have recognized him.

So it must be something important for her father to do this.

Professor Tian said.

“I was able to turn this situation around thanks to a young lad. If he hadn’t given me first aid, I’m afraid I wouldn’t have lasted until the ambulance arrived…”

Then, Professor Tian explained what had happened that day.

When Tian Huilan heard this, her expression changed drastically. She did not expect her father’s illness to flare up so dangerously this time. Now, she could not help but feel a chill down her spine, and she was very afraid.

“Then we really have to thank him…” Tian Huilan said.

Professor Tian nodded and continued.

“That’s what I’m talking about. However, the scene was very chaotic, and that young man was unwilling to leave his contact details. Although I gave him my business card, I’m afraid he might not take the initiative to contact me. Therefore, immediately arrange for someone to investigate that young man’s identity. We have to thank him properly later!”

Tian Huilan immediately said seriously.

“I understand. I’ll arrange this immediately.”

There were many surveillance cameras at the scene, and Xia Ruofei had even bought a bus ticket at the counter. With Tian Huilan’s status, it was naturally easy to find out his identity.

“Dad, if there’s nothing else, you can rest here! Don’t say anything about being discharged…” Tian Huilan continued.

When she heard that Professor Tian’s illness was so serious, her heart was already pounding. She insisted that Professor Tian stay in the hospital.

Tian Huilan helped Professor Tian lie down on the bed. After covering him with a blanket, she quietly left the ward.

Director He and Director Chen of the Cardiology Department were still waiting at the door. When they saw Tian Huilan coming out, they quickly stood up to welcome her.

Tian Huilan waved at them and then said to her secretary.

“Little Wu, come here for a moment.”

The female secretary, Wu Liqing, quickly walked to Tian Huilan’s side and asked respectfully.

“Mayor Tian, what are your instructions?”

Tian Huilan told Little Wu what Professor Tian had instructed her to do in a low voice, then said.

“You don’t have to worry about me. Go and take charge of this now. I want to see the results before work ends this afternoon!”

“Yes!” said Wu, hurrying away from the hospital.

After Tian Huilan finished arranging Professor Tian’s matters, she walked towards Director He and Director Chen and asked.

“Please tell me about my father’s illness!”

Director He and Director Chen both displayed a strange expression, but they quickly came back to their senses. Director Chen quickly said.

“Mayor Tian, let’s talk in my office!”

The reason why their expressions were a little strange was because they had just discussed Professor Tian’s condition.

After Tian Huilan and Professor Tian entered the ward, Director He pulled Director Chen aside to understand the situation.

Director Chen originally was confused about Professor Tian’s condition. However, since Tian Huilan and Professor Tian were present, he could not say anything. When Director He asked, he naturally spilled everything.

It turned out that Professor Tian’s examination showed that there was nothing wrong with his heart. Moreover, all the indicators were quite good for Professor Tian’s age. There was no sign of a heart attack at all.

But the house doctor’s diagnosis was acute myocardial infarction. By the time the ambulance arrived at the scene, although the situation was not very critical, his symptoms were very obvious. These were reflected in the house call report. It should be acute myocardial infarction.

It was precisely because of these two contradictory results that Director Chen was puzzled.

It was impossible for a house doctor to make such a low-level mistake, and the results of this examination were here. There was really no way to explain it.

Actually, Director Chen did not know that the petal solution that Xia Ruofei fed Professor Tian had a miraculous effect on all kinds of illnesses. However, Xia Ruofei was worried that it would shock the world, so he did not use much. Otherwise, Professor Tian would be completely fine.

It was also because of this that when the emergency doctors arrived at the scene, Professor Tian still had some symptoms of a myocardial infarction. But by the time the ambulance returned to the hospital, the petal solution had completely taken effect, and the lesion in Professor Tian’s heart had been completely cured.

Director He and Director Chen also looked at each other in puzzlement, unable to come to a conclusion.

He couldn’t tell Mayor Tian that there was nothing wrong with her father and that his heart was healthier than most people’s, right?

He had clearly fainted and was sent to the hospital. Could it be that he was pretending to be sick? Besides, who could bear the responsibility if there were any problems in the future?

He was Mayor Tian’s father!

Therefore, when they arrived at Director Chen’s office, they could only be vague when reporting to Tian Huilan. They said that from the examination results, the problem was not very serious and suggested that he stay in the hospital for a few more days for observation. At the same time, they would prescribe some medicine for him to recuperate.

When Director He and Director Chen reported to her, there were inevitably some technical jargon mixed in, so Tian Huilan did not understand them fully.

But all she had to know was that her father’s life wasn’t in danger.

After listening to the report, Tian Huilan was even more grateful to the young man who had reached out to her father. In her opinion, it must have been the young man who happened to have the first-aid treatment for a heart attack that saved her father’s life in time.

Tian Huilan, who was busy with work, thanked Director He and Director Chen after listening to the the report. Then, she returned to the ward to talk to her father for a while. She reminded him to follow the doctor’s instructions and stay in the hospital for a few days before leaving the hospital and returning to the city government.

Xia Ruofei, who did not know that he had saved the mayor’s father, had just arrived at the bus station in Changping County. All he could think about was treating Hu Zi’s mother.
