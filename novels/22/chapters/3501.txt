“I understand. Thank you, martial granduncle!” Li Yifu said, his eyes slightly red.

Xia ruofei continued,”by the way, I’ll be focusing on cultivation in the future. I might not have the energy to take care of some things in paradise Corporation. However, some of paradise corporation’s products and raw materials will require me to personally support them through cultivation. So, 1 might need a spokesperson or a liaison! In the future, he’ll do these things for me, mainly running some errands, but he must be absolutely reliable!”

The peach blossom company needed Xia ruofei’s support, mainly because Peach Blossom Farm needed to regularly add the spirit Heart Flower petal solution to the water source. Other than that, they needed to provide some raw materials, including the annual supply of Da Hong Pao tea Green tea and some Chinese medicinal herbs from the pharmaceutical factory. Some of the company’s high – end products were directly produced by the spirit map space, such as Cordyceps, truffles, top – Quality ginseng, and so on.

In fact, all they needed was a reliable spokesperson. Xia ruofei did not need to do these things in person to maintain the company’s normal operations.

However, as Xia ruofei had said, this person had to be absolutely reliable. After all, the solution of the spirit Heart Flower petals, truffle and ginseng were very precious to the Paradise Corporation. They were the core competitiveness of the company. Moreover, this person had to travel between Huaxia and the Paradise Island often. Loyalty was the most important.

Li Yifu pondered for a moment before saying,””Senior granduncle, 1 have a candidate in mind. You can consider it.”

“Oh? Someone from your company?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“You also know this person. He’s Zheng Yongshou from the star Seizer sect!” Li Yifu said.

Xia ruofei’s eyes brightened. It had to be said that the candidate Li Yifu proposed was quite suitable.

Zheng Yongshou and Wang Boshan had been implanted with soul seals by Xia ruofei before Luo Qingfeng. Wang Boshan had already been dealt with by Xia ruofei, and Zheng Yongshou was Xia ruofei’s soul slave, so his loyalty was definitely not a problem.

“There’s no problem with Zheng Yongshou’s loyalty, grand uncle – Master,” Li Yifu said.”As a cultivator, he’s naturally more at ease when dealing with the secular Affairs for grand uncle – Master, and he’s more familiar with the Peach Blossom Island himself, so there’s no worry of him leaking the secret even if he frequently travels to and from the island … The only problem is that Zheng Yongshou spends most of his time cultivating in the sect and rarely interacts with people from the secular world, so he might need some time to adapt…”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.’That’s true. He doesn’t know anything about the ways of the world!”

At this moment, he couldn’t help but think of Wang Boshan. If Wang Boshan was still around, he would definitely be more suitable than Zheng Yongshou. After all, Wang Boshan used to be in charge of the star Seizer sect’s businesses in the secular world, and he was also a smooth and slick person.

Of course, Xia ruofei would not regret dealing with Wang Boshan. From the moment he knew about the cases that Wang Boshan had committed, he had never thought of sparing Wang Boshan’s life. This kind of person deserved to die. Xia ruofei could not tolerate this.

“It shouldn’t be a big problem,” said Li Yifu. Senior granduncle, this disciple also has some properties in the three mountains, and they are all managed by the trusted juniors. Why don’t you let this disciple arrange for someone to take care of Zheng Yongshou first? Or you can let this disciple’s people connect with the peach blossom company in the early stages, and Zheng Yongshou will temporarily be in charge of the middle.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”that works too!” This is much more appropriate!”

Then, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile bitterly and said,””I originally wanted to let Qingfeng go into closed – door cultivation in peace, but now that we need Zheng Yongshou, we have no choice but to wake him up.”

“Senior granduncle,” Li Yifu said hurriedly,”sect leader Luo has been staying on Peach Blossom Island for a while, so there is a special channel of communication between the island and the star Seizer sect. I can contact Zheng Yongshou directly!”

“That works too! This way, we won’t have to disturb Luo Qingfeng’s closed – door cultivation.” Xia ruofei said,”tell Zheng Yongshou that I told him to go to the three mountains and wait for orders. Arrange for your men to meet him directly. I’ll contact you when 1 need it, and then they can come to me.”

“Yes! Martial granduncle, this disciple will take care of it!” Li Yifu quickly said.

Xia ruofei nodded.”lf that’s the case, I’ll leave the rest to you. The three of us will be returning to Huaxia!”

“This disciple will send off martial granduncle!” Li Yifu said respectfully.

They arrived at the rooftop of the building. Xia ruofei released the black Phoenix flying ship and brought Song Wei and Ling Qingxue onto the Flying Ship. He waved at Li Yifu, who was on the rooftop. Under Xia ruofei’s control, the Flying Ship turned into a stream of light and disappeared into the sky.

After more than two hours of flight, the black Phoenix flying ship arrived in the sky above Huaxia’s capital.

Xia ruofei hovered the flying boat above the rooftop of Song Wei’s high – Class apartment near the school. Even though it was morning in the capital, the black Phoenix flying boat was protected by an array so ordinary people in the secular world could not see the flying boat.

The three of them came to the deck of the airboat. Song Wei smiled and said,””RUO Fei, Qingxue, I’ll go down first!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” We’ll meet up with you at the three mountains!”

“Weiwei,” Ling Qingxue said,”settle your matters here as soon as possible. Then, tell RUO Fei to come and take you back to the three mountains!”

From the capital city to the three mountains, it would only take a little more than two hours by ordinary commercial plane. If it was the black Phoenix flying boat, it would take at most twenty to thirty minutes.

Even in the capital, the commuting time from one place to another was much longer.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”yes, yes, yes!” It was Qingxue who reminded me not to buy any plane tickets. It’s slow and not absolutely safe. I’ll just pick you up by airboat!”

“En!” Song Wei smiled and said,”I’ll try to settle this as soon as possible! I’ll take at most one or two days!”

After she finished speaking, Song Wei waved at the two of them and jumped off the flying boat. She stood firmly on the roof.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue stood by the side of the boat and waved at Song Wei. Then, the flying boat took off again and disappeared into the sky in a flash.

Twenty minutes later, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue appeared at the jiangbin villa district.

Xia ruofei stood at the entrance of his villa and realized that it was still very clean even though he had not been home for more than two months.

He had thought that the yard would be overgrown with weeds, but it was actually very clean. It was obvious that someone had taken care of it.

Ling Qingxue laughed and said,”why are you just standing there?” Are you surprised? Before 1 left, I gave the spare key to my dad and asked him to find someone to clean the house regularly. Otherwise, how could anyone live in this house?” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Hehe! My wife is so thoughtful!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”then I’ll go home first! You should also hurry back! Uncle Ling is probably already waiting for you at home!”

When they were in Beijing, Ling Qingxue had called Ling Xiaotian when the airboat was lowering its altitude. She had told him that she was going home today and would be home soon.

Ling Xiaotian had already arrived at the company, but when he heard that his daughter was back, he immediately asked the driver to send him back.

He had not seen his precious daughter for two to three months.

Ling Qingxue replied,”yes!” My dad said that he’ll be cooking today. He’s probably already preparing it. By the way, he asked you to come for lunch at noon!”

“Understood!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”1’11 go home and pack up. I’ll be back in a while!”

“Mm! Then I’ll go back first!” Ling Qingxue said.

Following that, she looked left and right to make sure that no one was spying on her, and that she was also in the blind spot of the camera. Then, with a thought, she took out the luggage that she had prepared long ago from her storage ring and some gifts for Ling Xiaotian. After such a long time, she hurried out of the courtyard gate. If she were to return home empty – handed, that would be too abnormal.

Ling Qingxue waved at Xia ruofei, then dragged her suitcase and walked towards her villa.

Xia ruofei watched as Ling Qingxue turned the corner. Then, he opened the courtyard door and walked in..
