2342 Inheritance.After a Sichuan Airlines vacant plane landed, Xia ruofei’s paradise was allowed to enter the runway and take off.

The plane accelerated on the runway and finally leaped lightly into the blue sky.

In a short while, the plane had climbed to the cruising altitude, and the seat belt indicator light quickly went out.

The flight crew came over to ask Xia ruofei and Ge Jun what they wanted to drink. Xia ruofei asked for Ge Jun’s opinion and ordered two glasses of red wine.

The entire flight was only about two hours long, so Xia ruofei did not plan to eat anything on the plane.

After the red wine was served, Xia ruofei asked the flight attendant to return to the front cabin. He opened his backpack and took out a manuscript that still smelled of ink. He smiled and passed it to Ge Jun.

Ge Jun had already guessed what Xia ruofei had given him. However, when he saw the words “three scrolls of cloud contact (one)” on the cover, he could not help but feel excited. His hands that were holding the manuscript started to tremble.

“Junior Brother Xia, this is the [three cloud rubbing scrolls]?” Ge Jun asked in a trembling voice.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”to be exact, it’s the first volume of the” three volumes of cloud contact. “” Senior brother GE, I’ve been treating uncle song at his house for the past two days, and I’ve been copying this manuscript at night when I have nothing to do. I’ve only written the first volume for now, and I’ll give you the other two when I have time. ”

“Three volumes of cloud rubbing” was written in classical Chinese. Typing on a computer might not be as fast as writing by hand. Besides, there were many illustrations in the medical book that were difficult to draw with a computer. Hence, Xia ruofei chose to write by hand and even specially used a brush.

“No hurry! There’s no hurry!” Ge Jun said excitedly,”junior Xia, you didn’t forget to copy the manuscript when you were treating Secretary song. It’s really hard on you!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”actually, I have a lot of free time at uncle song’s house.” Senior brother GE, you don’t have to be so polite. This medical book originally belonged to your GE family. I’m just returning it to you in one piece!”

“Thank you! Junior Xia!” Ge Jun said sincerely.

Xia ruofei chuckled,”you’re really welcome. If this medical book were to stay with me, I’d only be able to improve my medical skills.”On the other hand, senior brother GE might be able to bring Ge Hong’s medical skills to greater heights. ”

“I ... Can pass it on to my disciples and clansmen?” Ge Jun asked.

“Of course!” Xia ruofei shrugged his shoulders and said,”Chinese medicine is gradually declining. Other than some objective factors, many Chinese medicine practitioners keep their own skills to themselves, which is also a very important reason. A lot of Chinese medicine inheritance was gradually lost because of this idea of keeping their skills as a last resort.”

“Don’t worry, Junior Brother Xia,”said Ge Jun with a straight face. I definitely won’t repeat the same mistakes, but I’ll also carefully observe the character of my disciples and family members to ensure that such precious medical skills are passed on to those who truly love Chinese medicine and hope to carry forward Chinese medicine!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”of course, I trust you, senior.”

In fact, the reason why Xia ruofei created the drama of ‘taking in a disciple on behalf of the master’ was to promote the <three cloud – rubbing scrolls>.

After receiving the first volume, Ge Jun could not wait to open the manuscript and read it on the plane.

During the two hours of flight, Ge Jun did not even lift his head. His eyes did not leave the manuscript, and he was completely immersed in it.

In fact, although the “three volumes of cloud rubbing” was lost, some of the content was still passed down from generation to generation through word of mouth. These contents also formed the theoretical support of GE family’s Chinese medicine.

Therefore, even though it was Ge Jun’s first time studying the <three volumes of cloud rubbing>, he felt a sense of déjà vu. Furthermore, this was the original medical book created by ancestor Ge Hong. It was a huge boost and transformation to the Chinese medicine knowledge he had previously learned.

In the past, there were many problems caused by incomplete inheritances, but when he read this manuscript, he felt like the clouds were cleared and the sun was seen.

Hence, Ge Jun was so immersed in it that he did not notice the passage of time.

When the plane started to descend, the seat belt indicator light lit up. With Xia ruofei’s reminder, Ge Jun finally broke away from his Deep state of mind.

“We’ve arrived so quickly?”he asked, as if he had just woken up from a dream.

Xia ruofei laughed.”Senior, if I didn’t remind you, you wouldn’t have noticed us when the plane landed and we all left.”

“This medical book is too attractive ...” Ge Jun said awkwardly.

“Haha!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”one look and I can tell that senior GE is a very focused person!”

The plane was about to land soon, and Ge Jun did not study the medical book anymore. He put the manuscript into his bag and carefully looked at it as if he was serving his family treasure. In a sense, this medical book was really their GE family’s family treasure.

After a short period of hovering and waiting, the Gulfstream public jet was soon granted permission to land blindly.

When the plane touched the ground and started to glide, Ge Jun smiled and said,””Junior Brother Xia, the enjoyment of the rich is really different! Look at this private jet ... Compared to a normal flight, it’s like a beggar ... Not only did we save time, but we also didn’t have to line up. The flight is so smooth, it’s like it stopped on the ground and didn’t start!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”The Gulfstream business plane’s cruising altitude is much higher than ordinary commercial planes. At that altitude, the air flow is generally more stable. So, it is very rare to encounter bumps and such situations.”

As the two of them chatted, the plane had already passed through the runway and landed on a long – distance seat.

The flight attendant swiftly opened the cabin door and lowered the accommodation ladder. Xia ruofei and Ge Jun took their luggage and stood up to get off the plane.

After walking out of the restricted area of the airport, Xia ruofei saw Wu Qiang among the people who were waiting for him.

Xia ruofei met up with Wu Qiang and handed his luggage to him.

At this time, Ge Jun also met up with the people who were picking him up. A red flag sedan was sent by the health Bureau to pick him up.

The group walked out of the airport departure hall.

Xia ruofei said,”senior GE, let’s split up here!” You’re welcome to visit my house when you’re free!”

Ge Jun asked,”Junior Brother Xia, are you really not coming back with me?” I was going to introduce you to a few friends in the Chinese medicine world! Besides, those good – for – nothing disciples of mine should also come and pay their respects to you, their martial uncle!”

Xia ruofei laughed and waved his hand.”I really can’t today, I still have something to do! You can bring my martial nephews to my place some other day! My house’s courtyard is in liuhai Lane, and it’s very easy to find from the inner street of Desheng Gate!”

Ge Jun nodded and said,”alright!” Then I’ll visit you another day!”

Xia ruofei nodded and parted ways with Ge Jun outside the airport. The two of them got into their respective cars and left the airport.

Wu Qiang was driving the Toyota Elfa commercial car today.

To be honest, Alphard was known for its unparalleled comfort. Xia ruofei did not feel that there was anything special about the air first – Class cabin. He had only been in the plane for two hours, which was much more luxurious than the air first – Class cabin.

In his opinion, it was just a means of transportation that was more comfortable than ordinary cars or off – road vehicles.

Xia ruofei adjusted the seat back a little and lifted his legs up a little. Then, he sat in the soft seat in a more comfortable position. After chatting with Wu Qiang for a while, he closed his eyes and took a nap.

Xia ruofei only opened his eyes when the car drove into liuhai Lane.

The alley wasn’t very spacious, and Elfa’s car was much longer than an ordinary family car. Fortunately, Wu Qiang’s driving skills were good. He controlled the car and drove through the alley nimbly. In a short while, he arrived at the door of his house.

Xia ruofei immediately saw a black Mercedes – Benz car parked by the road. He squinted at the license plate and his face darkened, showing a trace of displeasure.
