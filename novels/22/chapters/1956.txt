1957 Arrival in Hong Kong (1)

The Gulfstream G650 was allowed to enter the runway after a Boeing plane landed and left the runway.

After taxiing into the runway at the end of the runway, the Gulfstream plane accelerated rapidly on the runway against the sun. The people on the plane suddenly felt an obvious back – pushing feeling. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Then, the nose of the plane rose slightly, and the plane jumped into the sky.

The flight from San Shan to Hong Kong was only about two hours. The Gulfstream G650 was equipped with two Rolls – Royce engines and could reach a maximum speed of 0.925 Mach, which was much faster than the general commercial aircraft, so the entire flight time was shorter.

About 20 minutes after taking off, the plane had climbed to a cruising altitude of 41000 feet. At this altitude, it could avoid most of the crowded routes and bad weather.

Therefore, the entire flight was just as Captain Liu An had said before taking off. It was quite stable.

Less than an hour had passed on the cruise, and the plane began to slowly lower its altitude again.

When the plane landed smoothly on the runway of Hong Kong International Airport, the setting sun was still high above the sea in the West of the airport. Sitting in the cabin, one could see the sparkling sea. In fact, this was just a Bay, and on the opposite side was Pearl.

The Gulfstream G650 plane slowly entered the tarmac through the runway. It was far away from the busy parking space next to the terminal and had a quiet feeling. The only thing that matched the busy Hong Kong airport in his impression was the various models of aircraft taking off and landing on the runway in the distance.

The sound of the plane’s engine was rapidly decreasing. After the car was shut down, Captain Liu An walked out of the cockpit first. He handed over the follow – up work to Captain Zheng Daming, who was acting as the co – Pilot.

“President Xia!” Liu An walked over and greeted Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Not bad. The flight was very stable.”

“Thank you!” Liu An said,”I wish you a happy life in Hong Kong!”

At this moment, the air stewardess had already opened the cabin door and let the accommodation ladder down. Xia ruofei nodded and said,” then we’ll be leaving first!” Captain Liu, I wish you all the best in the next few days!”

“At your call!” Liu An said.

He led the crew to see Xia ruofei and the others off at the cabin door.

There were already three cars parked on the tarmac. One of them was a small refrigerated cargo van, the other was a Mercedes-Benz luxury business vehicle, and the third one made pang Hao and the others’ eyes light up with an extended Phantom of a Rolls-Royce. Judging from the thick body of the car, it should be a customized bulletproof model.

Xia ruofei could not help but raise his eyebrows as he saw MA Xiong standing beside the car. Ma Zhiming, his wife, and their daughter, Huan Huan, were also with MA Xiong. Liu Qian was also in the welcoming party.

In fact, this Rolls Royce Phantom was one of MA Xiong’s cars. It was also a limited edition. There were only two of them in Hong Kong, and the cost was more than 100 million Hong Kong dollars. Although the mass-produced Phantom was the most luxurious car in the market, it paled in comparison to MA Xiong’s limited-edition extended bulletproof Phantom.

“Uncle Xia!”

Huan Huan was the first to show an extremely happy expression. She ran towards Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei also let go of his luggage. He squatted down and opened his arms, and Huanhuan jumped into his arms.

“Huanhuan has grown taller!” Xia ruofei laughed and touched her nose.

An innocent smile appeared on Huan Huan’s porcelain doll-like face. She said proudly, “Yup! I’m already in primary school!”

Even though she had not met Xia ruofei many times, she did not feel unfamiliar with him.

Before the age of four, Huanhuan lived in her own world. She had almost no reaction to external stimuli and was considered a person with severe autism.

Xia ruofei’s appearance was like a crack in the dark World. The light from the outside world shone in and Huanhuan walked out completely.

To her, this was like a rebirth in a sense. It was Xia ruofei who had brought her out of her lonely world. Xia ruofei was the first person she had seen when she left this world, so she had a natural closeness to Xia ruofei from the beginning. This closeness did not drift apart with time.

It could be said that Xia ruofei had a special place in Huan Huan’s heart. In a sense, even Ma Zhiming and his wife could not compare. Of course, these were two completely different feelings, and there was no way to compare them.

In fact, when Ma Zhiming and Tian Huixin saw that Huan Huan and Xia ruofei were so close, they were both happy and envious.

MA Xiong also greeted him with a smile.

Xia ruofei carried Huanhuan easily with one hand and dragged her luggage with the other.

“Mr. MA, why did you come to the airport in person? As a junior, I can’t afford to do that!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Xia Sheng is the MA family’s benefactor. Of course I have to welcome him personally!”MA Xiong laughed heartily.

Then, MA Xiong pouted at the airplane behind Xia ruofei and asked with a smile, ” “This model of plane is not bad, right? Xia Sheng, you should’ve bought a private jet A long time ago. That’s more befitting of your status!”

MA Xiong’s private jet was also a Gulfstream G650. In fact, many tycoons in the world preferred Gulfstream series business jets. When he saw the logo of paradise Corporation on the plane, he naturally thought that Xia ruofei had bought it recently.

Xia ruofei didn’t explain much and said,””It’s indeed very good! Mr. MA, let me introduce you to the elites of our company!”
