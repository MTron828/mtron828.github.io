Chapter 884: Drinking and chatting merrily (1)

Translator: 549690339

In the villa, other than the sounds of a few burly men punching and kicking he Dong, as well as he Dong’s agonized cries, no one else dared to even breathe loudly.

Yang Jianren leaned back on the sofa with a sullen face until he Dong’s screams gradually died down. He then said indifferently,””That’s enough,”

The Men in Black immediately stopped and walked behind yang Jianren. They crossed their arms and scanned the other people in the living room with a murderous look.

The few people who had accompanied yang Jianren to the West River Moon Club with he Dong couldn’t help but shiver. They looked down at the floor under their feet, their hearts filled with apprehension.

At this moment, he Dong was curled up on the floor with a face full of blood, occasionally letting out weak moans. His entire person was like a dead dog, and his face was bruised and swollen, mixed with blood, looking rather miserable.

These superficial wounds were nothing much, as those few burly men had been very ruthless. The blood that occasionally flowed out from the corners of he Dong’s mouth showed that his internal abdomen had also suffered considerable injuries.

Yang Jianren didn’t have the slightest bit of pity. He Dong had always been one of his dogs, but this dog had been quite obedient in the past, and he’d been quite comfortable with it, so he’d always kept it by his side during this time.

Today, he Dong caused him to get into such a big mess, so he naturally would teach him a harsh lesson without the slightest hesitation. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Yang Jianren leaned back on the sofa and squinted at he Dong. He said indifferently,””I’ll give you one day to get out of the three mountains. The next time I find out that you’re in the three mountains, it won’t be as simple as today. I’ll throw you to Min River to feed the fish, do you understand?”

Yang Jianren suddenly raised his voice in the last sentence, and he Dong was so scared that he shivered. He quickly said weakly,””Yes ... Yes ... I know ...”

“Get lost!” Yang Jianren spat and pouted.

He Dong hurriedly struggled to get up from the ground and staggered towards the door. After taking two steps, his legs gave way and he fell to the ground again.

“I’m sorry, I’m sorry ...”He Dong repeatedly said.

Then, he struggled to get up, but he was beaten up so badly that he couldn’t get up no matter how hard he tried.

Yang Jianren’s other lackeys were watching from the side. He Dong’s status was similar to theirs, and they all worked for yang Jianren. Seeing he Dong’s tragic state, they couldn’t help but feel sad.

But under the fierce gazes of a few burly men, not a single one of these people dared to move. They only looked at he Dong with some pity.

Yang Jianren said impatiently,”Two men go and help him up. Don’t let him die in my house!”

Those few lackeys hurriedly went up to help he Dong up and supported him as they left the villa.

There were two people who had a good relationship with he Dong, and they even helped him flag down a taxi.

After he Dong left yang Jianren’s Villa, he found a small hospital to treat his external injuries and then prescribed some medicine. On the same day, he bought a ticket and left Sanshan city like a stray dog.

This time, he was so scared that he didn’t even pack up his personal belongings. He only put away his cash, bank cards, and some valuable electronic devices before leaving in a panic, not daring to come back.

In the villa, yang Jianren glanced at everyone and said,””Pass down the order. Our people are not to provoke that young master Xia in the future. If anyone causes trouble for me, don’t worry about me not showing any mercy!”

“Yes!” Everyone responded in unison.

Yang Jianren waved his hand tiredly and said,”You may all leave. I want to be alone for a while.”

After the lackeys and thugs left, yang Jianren got up and went to the wine cabinet. He took out a bottle of red wine, poured half a glass, and drank it all in one gulp.

Yang Jianren lowered his head and thought for a while. Guangzhi Cao should be almost done with his meal by now, so he took out his phone and called Guangzhi Cao.

Before he made the call, he had already thought about what to say. The mysterious young master Xia really made him feel guilty. After leaving the West River Moon Club, he had been feeling uneasy and uncertain.

Therefore, yang Jianren wanted to contact Guangzhi Cao. First, he wanted to explain it to him. Second, he wanted to find out what Guangzhi Cao was up to. He wanted to know who this young master Xia was.

What yang Jianren didn’t expect was that after the phone rang twice, a mechanical electronic voice came through. “I’m sorry, the number you’ve dialed is currently on the line ...”

Guangzhi Cao hung up the phone.

Yang Jianren’s expression changed slightly, and he felt that things were getting worse.

The new Secretary was transferred from another province. No one knew much about this Secretary song. All the leaders and cadres were very cautious in their work during this period of time, including yang Jianren’s father, yang Jinsheng. He was afraid that something would go wrong in his work and he would be burned as the first fire of the new Secretary.

This was especially true when yang Jinsheng was at an important juncture in his progress.

Yang Jinsheng also knew what his son was like, so he specifically told him to be more honest during this time and not to cause trouble for himself outside.

Yang Jianren didn’t take it seriously at first. He was already used to the bright life under his father’s power. He didn’t think that changing the Secretary would affect his life at all, so he continued to do what he wanted.

He just didn’t expect that he would really cause trouble for his father so soon, and it didn’t seem to be a small one.

Although yang Jianren was foppish, he was not an idiot.

Guangzhi Cao didn’t greet Xia ruofei when he entered the room. He only noticed Xia ruofei when he Feng said “Mr. Xia”.
