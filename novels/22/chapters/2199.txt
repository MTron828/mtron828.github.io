2200 An easy breakthrough_Of course, he was still a little nervous. After all, he would have to tell Ling Qingxue everything about him and Song Wei after the spirit body Fusion cultivation. Subconsciously, he still hoped that he could delay it.

After Ling Qingxue had consolidated her cultivation, the two of them stopped cultivating.

Because he had only cultivated for a few hours, according to the difference in the flow of time, only a few minutes had passed outside the array.

So when they left the time formation, the sun was still shining.

Ling Qingxue giggled.”Ruofei, I didn’t expect to break through so quickly. It seems like even the heavens want me to enjoy the sun for a while longer!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”wife, you can go to the stern deck.” There’s no shelter there, and there’s a comfortable sofa. It’s perfect for sunbathing. ”

“Yes, yes!” Ling Qingxue nodded and said,”I’m going to take a shower!”

Her cultivation had just broken through, so it was natural for her body to discharge some impurities. At this moment, her body was sticky and uncomfortable. As a little sister who loved cleanliness, it was naturally unbearable for her.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded,”sure!” You go take a shower! I’ll start the yacht and find a place where the school of fish often appear. Let’s play some sea fishing ...”

It was faster to catch directly with the net, but it was not as fun as fishing.

“Good, good!” Ling Qingxue said happily.

Thus, one of them went into the cabin to take a shower, while the other went directly to the bridge and started the yacht to move forward. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Actually, Xia ruofei did not know much about the ocean currents and the habits of the fish. However, with his strong spiritual power, he could detect the activities of the fish in the water. It was not difficult for him to find an area with rich fish resources.

He turned the steering wheel to control the yacht to move forward while spreading out his spiritual power.

Although his spiritual power would be blocked by the sea water, it was easy for him to detect things dozens of meters below the water’s surface with his spiritual power cultivation of spirit gathering realm.

The underwater world appeared clearly in his mind. Soon, Xia ruofei found an area with a lot of fish. He smiled, stopped the ship, and anchored it. Then, he got up and walked to the stern.

Ling Qingxue was dressed in a pink bikini and was lying on the sofa on the open – Air deck at the stern. Her eyes were slightly closed and she looked like she was enjoying herself.

Under the sun, her body was glistening with oil. She had obviously applied sunscreen in advance.

If an ordinary person were to wear a bikini outside in this weather, they would most likely be shivering from the cold. However, Ling Qingxue, who was already at the third level of the aura refining realm, didn’t feel cold at all.

Bathed in the sun, Ling Qingxue’s beautiful figure was revealed in her bikini, especially her slender legs that were slightly bent. It was a soul – stealing temptation.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but secretly swallow his saliva.

Ling Qingxue heard the commotion and opened her eyes to look over. Her eyes met Xia ruofei’s fiery gaze.

Her heart couldn’t help but tremble slightly. A sense of joy from the bottom of her heart spontaneously arose. Xia ruofei didn’t hide his admiration at all. What was more worth being happy than being sized up by her lover?

“Are you going fishing?” Ling Qingxue asked.

“Oh! “It’s fine ...” Xia ruofei returned to her senses and said,”you can bask in the sun for a while! We’re out here for leisure, not to fish. ”

“En!” Ling Qingxue leaned back on the soft fabric sofa and said coyly,”I really want to play at sea for a few more days. This feeling of relaxation and freedom is really great ...”

“I’ll definitely bring you out more often in the future!”Xia ruofei said with a smile.

After he finished speaking, he lay down beside Ling Qingxue and naturally put his arm around her round shoulders.

Ling Qingxue snuggled into Xia ruofei’s arms and shifted into a more comfortable position.

The two of them closed their eyes and took a nap under the sun. They felt that they were far away from the hustle and bustle of the city. After coming to the vast sea, time seemed to have slowed down.

After an unknown amount of time, the sun was no longer as hot as it was at noon. It was gradually setting in the West, and the Golden sunlight shone on the sea, making the waves shimmer beautifully.

Ling Qingxue reached out and touched Xia ruofei’s arm lightly. She said,””Let’s go fishing, ruofei! Otherwise, the sun will be setting soon!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”where did the mountain come from?” Even if it does, it should fall into the sea ...”

“I meant what I said!” Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”if you’re so picky about your words, you’ll lose friends easily, you know?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you’re right, wife!” I’ll go prepare the fishing rod now!”

After that, he jumped up from the sofa and went to the cabin to get a fishing rod.

The two of them each took a fishing rod to the affinity platform at the stern and sat down on one side.

The intimate platform was the closest to the sea, and the sea was almost level with the platform. If the waves were a little bigger, the intimate platform would be wet. Moreover, this affinity platform had no guardrails. It was equivalent to a protruding piece at the end of the yacht, surrounded by water on three sides.

The spot where Xia ruofei had chosen to stop the boat had a lot of fish. The two of them started to have some harvest after a while.

Although the fish she caught weren’t very big, and most of them were clownfish that were very common in the sea, Ling Qingxue was still very happy. Every time she felt the fishing rod sink, she couldn’t help but cry out in surprise. Then, she quickly turned the reel and began to pull back the line.

By the time the sun had completely set below the surface of the ocean and the night had started to cover the waters, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue had already caught more than ten fish.

The two of them stood up to continue fishing. Although Ling Qingxue wanted to play for a while longer, the sky was already dark, and visibility was very low. On top of that, they had not had dinner yet, so they decided to end fishing for the time being.

Xia ruofei looked at the dozens of fish in the bucket. They were not very big. The biggest one was only the size of a palm, and they were all small fish from the sea.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”wife, these fish ... Let’s just barbeque them!” Tonight’s dinner will be mainly barbecue, how about it?”

“I’ll listen to you!” Ling Qingxue said with a smile.

“Alright!” Xia ruofei picked up the bucket and said,”let’s have a barbeque party for two tonight!”

“I’ll help!” Ling Qingxue was also excited.

The two of them walked into the small kitchen on the yacht. Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””Qingxue, I’ll go and prepare the barbecue. You can deal with these fish first!”

“How should we handle this?” Ling Qingxue asked.

“Hmm...You’ll be in charge of removing their internal organs. If there’s a bigger Gill, remove it too ...” Xia ruofei said,”if there’s still time, make a few cuts on the fish. That’s about it!”

Ling Qingxue was very enthusiastic. She replied without hesitation,””Alright! Leave it to me!”

In fact, it was best to marinate the fish before roasting it so that it would be easier for the flavor to enter.

However, Xia ruofei did not trust Ling Qingxue’s skills, so he decided to do the process himself.

After assigning the task to Ling Qingxue, Xia ruofei went into the cabin to find the barbecue equipment.

A simple barbecue grill, special charcoal for barbecue, and all kinds of seasonings were readily available on the yacht.

Xia ruofei moved them to the deck of the flying bridge. Then, he put the charcoal into the grill and started a fire.

After successfully starting the fire, Xia ruofei went to wash his hands and then went to the kitchen to help Ling Qingxue.

It was not tiring for men and women to work together. Soon, the ten or twenty fish were all processed.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue took them to the deck of the flying bridge. Then, Xia ruofei put on disposable gloves, grabbed the seasoning that he had just prepared, and applied it on the fish.
