Translator: 549690339

After that, song Rui told the waiters in the room to leave first and told them not to serve the dishes for the time being. They were not to enter the room without permission.

Xia ruofei watched as the waiter left and closed the door. Then, he looked at song Rui and said with a faint smile,””Did you get into some big trouble?”

Song Rui chuckled awkwardly and did not answer Xia ruofei’s question. Instead, he asked uneasily,””Ruofei, I know you’re very good at medicine. I wonder if you can cure ... That kind of illness?”

“What kind of illness is it?” Xia ruofei was confused by song Rui’s words.

Song Rui’s expression became even more awkward. He looked at Xia ruofei with dissatisfaction and said,””You’re playing dumb, right?”

Xia ruofei’s expression suddenly became interesting. He couldn’t help but glance at song Rui’s crotch and asked,””Don’t tell me it’s ... That kind of illness!”

Song Rui nodded and said,””Do you have any ideas?”

Although the two of them seemed to be speaking in riddles, their meaning was clear.

Xia ruofei said disdainfully,”song Rui, you’re the young master of a rich family. Can you not be so desperate?” Don’t you think you’ll be embarrassed if this gets out?”

“Don’t talk about embarrassing things anymore,” song Rui said gloomily.”I’m worried about my life now, okay?”

“Why is his life in danger?” Xia ruofei was also very surprised. He then asked with a strange expression,”could it be AID ...”

“Stop, stop!” Song Rui shouted,”I break out in cold sweat whenever I mention this word!”

Xia ruofei stood up and said,””No way? It’s that serious? Just how rotten is your private life?”

Song Rui quickly said,”I’m really wronged this time!” Don’t get too excited, I’ll tell you slowly. ”

“You say it! “I’m listening ...” Xia ruofei said as he glanced at song Rui with a strange expression.

Hence, song Rui told Xia ruofei the whole story with a gloomy face.

It turned out that song Rui had returned to the capital some time ago because of the company’s matters. As the young master of a top wealthy family, although song Rui was gradually on the right path now, he had finally returned to the base camp. He must have had many friends to invite him.

When these rich Playboys were welcoming song Rui, they naturally brought wine and women.

The only bad things were the wine and the woman.

Song Rui hadn’t seen his friends for a long time, and that day was a welcoming banquet for him, so this guy drank too much.

Moreover, it was the kind of drunkenness that only lasted for a short while.

When song Rui woke up the next morning, he found a soft and tender body in his arms. He looked closely and saw that it was a fourth – or fifth – tier star who had been asked by his friends to accompany him for dinner last night.

Song Rui was used to this kind of thing. Although he rarely went out to play, he was not against it. After all, the other party was not a chaste woman. It was something that both parties were willing to do.

Song Rui even took advantage of the time when he was the most energetic in the morning and pulled the small star to do a ‘morning exercise’.

Of course, song Rui also casually mentioned it to a friend in the entertainment industry and arranged a good supporting role for this small star.

He had thought that this matter would be over just like that.

But what song Rui didn’t expect was that a few days ago, he suddenly received a call from a friend, saying that the small star was diagnosed with AIDS. Many people in the industry who had short – term relationships with this small star were shocked and went to the hospital for a screening.

Although the small star did a good job of keeping it a secret and didn’t reveal anything in the entertainment news, it was impossible to hide this kind of thing from the people in song Rui’s circle, so there was no doubt about the authenticity of the news.

When song Rui heard the news, he was stunned. He happened to have a low fever these two days.

He didn’t dare to tell his family about it, and he didn’t even dare to do the examination in the southeast province.

Otherwise, the image of a prodigal son turning over a new leaf that he had painstakingly built up would be completely destroyed. Moreover, if his strict father found out about this shameful matter, he could not imagine what kind of situation he would face.

In any case, directly stripping him of his current position in the company and grounded him at home would probably be the lightest punishment.

Of course, the most important thing was not the punishment, but the problem of his own life!

Although song Rui didn’t dare to go and screen it rashly, he searched for information on the internet for a day and a night like a madman. The more he looked at the information, the more scared he became. He felt that many of the symptoms matched him ...

Song Rui was still so young. He had never thought that he would face a life – and – Death situation at this age, so he was on the verge of a mental breakdown.

At this most torturous moment, he suddenly thought of Xia ruofei, who had successfully cured his grandfather of terminal cancer. As if he had found a life – saving straw, he quickly called Xia ruofei.

Even the world’s top experts could not cure terminal cancer, which spread throughout the body. There should be a way to cure AIDS, right?

Xia ruofei looked at song Rui with a weird expression and asked,””You didn’t even wear a condom when you did it with that small star? Aren’t your safety awareness a little too poor?”

Song Rui said dejectedly,”I must have worn it that morning!” The problem is, I was so drunk that I lost my memory of the night before. I don’t have any memory of it at all!”

“Can’t you just ask her to verify it?” Xia ruofei asked, trying to hold back his laughter.

“How do we verify it? People like her have messy private lives. She can’t possibly remember it so clearly. ” Song Rui said dejectedly,”besides, I have so many symptoms that match it!”

At this point, song Rui counted with his fingers and said,””You see ... I’ve been having a fever, sweating, and my appetite has been bad. The lymph nodes in my jaw are swollen, and ... I’ve lost three pounds this week!”

Xia ruofei quickly waved his hand and said,”Okay, okay, okay. Don’t forget it. I’ll take a look at you first!” Give me your hand!”

“Taking her pulse, right?” Song Rui immediately said,”men on the left and women on the right, right?”

After saying that, song Rui immediately extended his left hand.

Xia ruofei glanced at song Rui and said,””Do you think you’re reading my face? Men on the left and women on the right! A Traditional Chinese Medicine doctor needs both hands to take a pulse because they are in charge of different meridians and organs ... Since you’ve reached out your left hand, then let’s use your left hand first!”

Then, Xia ruofei placed his finger on song Rui’s pulse. He closed his eyes slightly and focused on checking his pulse.

Song Rui’s heart was beating fast. He stared at Xia ruofei nervously, hoping to get some information from his expression.

However, Xia ruofei was like a Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner, his face was as calm as an ancient well.

After a long while, Xia ruofei said indifferently,””Change your hand!”

Song Rui immediately retracted his left hand and put his right hand on the table.

Xia ruofei looked at song Rui indifferently and continued to check the pulse on his right hand.

During this period of time, whenever Xia ruofei was free, he would study the medical information attached to the human – shaped jade talisman. He had made great progress, especially some long – Lost Chinese medical books, which had benefited him a lot.

Hence, Xia ruofei’s current level of Chinese medicine was not the same as before. In the past, he was just putting on an act to hide the spirit Heart Flower petal solution. Even though he consciously learned Chinese medicine by himself, what he learned was all from the internet or publicly published books. Furthermore, he did not have any famous teachers to guide him. Hence, he could only be said to be half – baked.

However, it was completely different now. There were so many precious Chinese medicine books and records, and they were accompanied by many medical insights. It was as if there were many famous teachers guiding him. At the same time, these Chinese medicine knowledge were directly transmitted into his mind, so it was very convenient and thorough to understand.

Hence, Xia ruofei’s current medical skills were probably much higher than those white – haired Chinese medical Masters. The only thing he lacked was clinical experience.

After a long time, Xia ruofei finally moved his fingers away and slowly opened his eyes.

Song Rui didn’t notice the smile in Xia ruofei’s eyes. As soon as Xia ruofei finished checking his pulse, he immediately asked,””RUO Fei, how is it?” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei tried to hold back his laughter. He let out a long sigh and said,””Song Rui, you’re really sick ...”
