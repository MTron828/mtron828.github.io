Actually, Xia ruofei’s hearing was much better than the average person ‘s. Although song Qiming was covering the microphone, Xia ruofei could still vaguely hear what he said.

It was such a small matter, but song Qiming still did it personally. He even specifically instructed he Feng to satisfy his requests. This made Xia ruofei feel slightly touched.

After he Feng left, song Qiming continued to talk to Xia ruofei,””Xiao Xia, I’ve already spoken to Deputy Mayor he Feng of the clock tower Division. I’ll get Secretary Xiao Cao to give you Mayor he’s contact information later. In addition, if you have anything in the future, you can also directly ask Xiao Cao to do it for you. ”

“Secretary song, thank you very much,” Xia ruofei said sincerely.

Song Qiming laughed heartily and said,””You and I don’t need to be so polite! Little Xia, if there’s nothing else, I’ll hang up first. My comrades in the Bell Tower District are still waiting for me to eat!”

“Okay, okay. Goodbye, Secretary song!” Xia ruofei said.

Not long after he ended the call with song Qiming, Xia ruofei received a call from a local phone in Sanshan.

“Hello!” Xia ruofei answered the call.

“Hello, are you Mr. Xia?” The young voice on the other end of the phone asked very politely.

“I’m Xia ruofei, and you are ...”

“Oh, hello, Mr. Xia! I’m Guangzhi Cao, Secretary song’s Secretary. The Secretary asked me to give you Mayor he’s contact information. ”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei immediately said,”Oh, it’s director Cao!” Hello there!”

“You’re welcome. You can just call me Xiao Cao!” Guangzhi Cao quickly said.

Song Qiming called Guangzhi Cao over and gave him Xia ruofei’s phone number. He asked Guangzhi to contact Xia ruofei immediately and give him he Feng’s contact number. He also told Guangzhi to do his best if Xia ruofei needed his help. If he had any difficulties, he should report to him immediately.

Guangzhi Cao had just become song Qiming’s Secretary, so he was at his most cautious stage. This was the first private matter song Qiming had assigned him, so Guangzhi Cao treated it very seriously. At the same time, he paid more attention to Mr. Xia.

Although Xia ruofei sounded young on the phone, Guangzhi Cao still kept a low profile.

Xia ruofei laughed.”I wouldn’t dare. Director Cao is the Secretary of Secretary song!”

“You’re too kind, Mr. Xia. ” Guangzhi Cao quickly said,”I’m just an ordinary staff member who serves the leader.”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”director Cao, let’s add each other on WeChat!” You can just send me District head he’s contact information through WeChat. ”

“Alright, alright.” “Mr. Xia, please don’t call me director Cao,” Guangzhi Cao said.”I’m not worthy of that title!” I’m just a small soldier in the Secretary Department! Not to mention the municipal Party Committee Office. ”

“You’re too humble!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”since I’m working for Secretary song, it’s only a matter of time before I have to solve the problem.”

Song Qiming was the Secretary of the municipal government and the leader of the Provincial Party Committee. How could his Secretary be an ordinary clerk? As long as Guangzhi Cao had enough experience, he would at least be appointed as the Deputy Director of the first Secretary Department, and he would even become the Deputy Director of the municipal Party Committee Office.

Xia ruofei continued,”brother Cao, we’re not strangers. You don’t have to call me Mr. Xia. You can just call me by my name.”

Guangzhi Cao was delighted to hear that Xia ruofei had changed the way he addressed him. He quickly said,””Alright, I’m a few years older than you, so I’ll call you brother Xia!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”brother Cao, you’ve just started working for the Secretary. You must be very busy. When you have some free time, let’s hang out together. I’ll treat you to a drink!”

“Alright! Then I’ll be waiting for brother Xia’s good wine!” Guangzhi Cao said with a smile.

The two chatted for a while. Xia ruofei considered that Guangzhi Cao still had to serve his leader, so he didn’t talk to him for long and hung up.

However, Xia ruofei’s first impression of Guangzhi Cao was not bad. After a chat, they felt that they had gotten closer.

Not long after the call ended, Guangzhi Cao searched for Xia ruofei’s number and added him on WeChat. He also sent he Feng’s number.

Xia ruofei sent a thank you emoji.

He didn’t contact he Feng immediately to remind him that song Qiming was still doing research in the Bell Tower District. Besides, it was lunchtime at his place and he Feng must be busy receiving the leaders. Xia ruofei thought about it and decided not to cause any trouble.

Xia ruofei finally called he Feng in the evening. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

In fact, he didn’t know that he Feng had been waiting for “Mr. Xia ‘s” call the whole afternoon.

Song Qiming’s schedule in the Bell Tower District lasted until the evening, but in the afternoon, he was mainly talking to the members of the Standing Committee of the district Committee. He Feng was only a Deputy District Chief who was ranked in the middle and did not enter the Standing Committee, so he had nothing to do in the afternoon.

He Feng’s mind was filled with the task that song Qiming had given him. He had also called the director of the district Education Bureau in advance to find out about the enrollment situation of the second primary school in the bell tower this year and instructed him to make preparations in advance.

The main purpose of this preparation was to let the Director of Education personally understand the situation of the special class of the No. 2 primary school in the bell tower this year and arrange for better teachers to be assigned to that class. This was a matter that Secretary song had personally asked about. That child would definitely be arranged to be in the special class.
