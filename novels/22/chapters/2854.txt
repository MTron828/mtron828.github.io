2855 A dream start (1)

The sun at around oneo’ clock in the afternoon was still quite strong. Under the sunlight, the projection of the stadium’s ceiling made the entire Stadium appear to have two distinct parts, which were commonly known as the “Yin – yang field.” Whether it was for the broadcaster or the fans, the experience was very bad.

The broadcasting unit had to constantly adjust the camera’s luminosity according to the position of the football, and the fans ‘eyes would also be very uncomfortable.

In addition, on this warm winter afternoon, many fans could not help but feel a little drowsy. Even when the referee blew the whistle for the game, everyone would cheer loudly, but they always felt that the excitement was not as high as the late game.

However, after the opening, the fans ‘mood experienced a brief low tide and quickly rose to an extremely high height. The entire elprat Stadium seemed to be boiling!

The reason was simple. As soon as the game started, Espanyol scored.

At this moment, the time was displayed on the scoreboard. The first minute of the match had not even passed.

The camera cut back to the start of the game. Espanyol was determined to win this game. While everyone was still preparing to kick off, the players of the RCD Espanyol club had already shown a fierce offensive posture to encourage the Espanyol to get the right to start the ball. Before the start, the Espanyol players in the middle and front field were lined up in a straight line behind the center line, waiting for the referee to blow the whistle, and then everyone rushed to Herona’s half of the field together.

Generally, using this formation at the start of the game was the most direct embodiment of a team’s desire to attack.

The Spanish team was not bluffing. The referee blew the whistle and the game began.

Iglasias passed the ball to Wu Lei, who was also in the starting lineup, and then began to rush to the front field. At the same time, the other players in the middle and front field of Espanyol quickly pressed past the half of the field and spread out in Herona’s half.

Xia ruofei was among the attacking players.

Because everyone plugged in quickly, Wu Lei didn’t even pass the ball back as he usually did. In just a few seconds, there were several points for the ball in the front field of Herona.

Xia ruofei’s speed was extremely fast. He was almost sprinting at full speed and had already far surpassed iglysias.

Wu Lei only took a glance at the ball before he raised his leg and dangled it over Xia ruofei’s head without hesitation.

Wu Lei’s control of his footwork was not very precise. He was just trying to make a shot at the right time. Moreover, the head coach had made it clear before the game that he had to pass and make more balls for Xia ruofei in this game so that Xia ruofei would have more chances to shoot.

Xia ruofei did not turn back to look at the ball to judge where it would land. His spiritual power had already spread out and he had already predicted where the ball would land. Hence, he did not need to slow down. Instead, he stomped on the ground and increased his speed.

Wu Lei’s pass drew a parabola and quickly fell from the sky.

Xia ruofei did not rush to the football’s best landing point to run because he would not have a chance to receive the ball. He would have been cleared by the opponent’s header from the back.

Xia ruofei had chosen a spot slightly ahead. When he ran to his position, Herona’s defensive midfielder had already blocked his position.

However, Xia ruofei only squeezed lightly and used a reasonable collision to push the opposing player to his side. He took the best position to receive the ball. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

In the blink of an eye, the football had already fallen from the air.

Xia ruofei opened his arms and trapped Herona’s defensive midfielder behind him. At the same time, he jumped back slightly in the direction of the ball and stopped the ball with his chest.

The soccer ball bounced off Xia ruofei’s chest after a clever diversion. It was completely under Xia ruofei’s control.

At this time, Herona’s defensive midfielder was still behind him, desperately trying to squeeze forward. In fact, Herona’s defensive midfielder had completely lost his position, but he had to use as many small movements as possible to interfere with Xia ruofei so that he could not easily take the ball.

Otherwise, with Spain already firing arrows and several attacking players in the middle and front field already in Herona’s half of the field, if the ball was easily divided by Xia ruofei, it would immediately become a great threat.

However, the defensive midfielder of Herona had overlooked the possibility of Xia ruofei turning around to break through. In a sense, he had also blocked his position. Xia ruofei’s back was facing the goal and he was stopping a high ball. Another Herona midfielder not far away had come to help with the defense. Under such circumstances, it was very difficult for Xia ruofei to turn around.

However, Xia ruofei was just that unexpected. After he stopped the ball with his chest, the football only bounced up slightly and then fell down. He did not wait for the ball to land on the ground. It was basically at his waist. He suddenly stretched out his right foot and gently flicked it.

The ball drew an extremely beautiful arc and went over Xia ruofei’s head. It also went over the defensive midfielder’s head and landed behind them.

As Xia ruofei picked the ball, he nimbly lowered his center of gravity and quickly went around Herona’s defensive midfielder. The entire pick, turn, and pass were done in one go. It made people think of Ronaldinho at his peak.

Xia ruofei’s turning speed was extremely fast. When he circled around Herona’s defensive midfielder, the football had not even landed on the ground.
