Ling Qingxue’s face immediately turned red. Her face was already red after drinking two glasses of wine, and now she was even more shy, making her look even more beautiful. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel a little lost. Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”bad guy!” What are you thinking about all day?” Xia ruofei showed an innocent expression and said,””I just wanted to find a place to rest! Today, your dad forced me to drink a little bit of white wine. I’m very dizzy now and want to sleep!” Xia ruofei pretended to be confused and asked,””Qingxue, what do you think I’m thinking?” Ling Qingxue bit her lower lip, her eyes wide open. She looked at Xia ruofei for a long time before saying,””You’re a bad guy! He did it on purpose ...” Xia ruofei burst out laughing. However, Ling Qingxue was really concerned about Xia ruofei. She quickly asked,””RUO Fei, is your head really that dizzy?” Xia ruofei immediately groaned.”Yes ... Not only do I feel dizzy, but it also hurts ... It’s as if something is shaking in my head ...” “Then ... Then hurry up and lie down for a while ...” Ling Qingxue said in a hurry,”let’s go!” Let’s go upstairs ...” Ling Qingxue did not notice Xia ruofei’s sly smile. After she finished speaking, she held Xia ruofei’s hand and walked upstairs. Very quickly, they pushed open a door and entered a room. Once he entered, Xia ruofei could smell a faint fragrance. He looked at the furnishings in the room – a light pink dressing table, a princess bed with a muslin curtain, and all kinds of cute dolls ... Obviously, this was Ling Qingxue’s bedroom! “Qingxue, just find me a guest room ...” Xia ruofei was a little embarrassed. Ling Qingxue blushed and said,””It’s the same! Quickly lie down for a while. ” Ling Qingxue then pressed on Xia ruofei’s shoulder and made him sit on the edge of the bed. “Ruofei, I’ll go make you some honey water to cure the alcohol!” Ling Qingxue said,”you should lie down and rest for a while!” After speaking, Ling Qingxue turned to leave. But Xia ruofei hugged her waist. Xia ruofei was sitting on the edge of the bed, while the tall Ling Qingxue was standing. So, when Xia ruofei hugged him, his face was immediately stuck near Ling Qingxue’s small belly. Ling Qingxue groaned and struggled to say,””RUO Fei ... RUO Fei ...” “What?” Xia ruofei finally stopped and looked at her with burning eyes. Ling Qingxue shyly avoided Xia ruofei’s gaze and said in a low voice,””I can’t today ... I ... I’m not feeling well ...” The fire in Xia ruofei’s heart immediately subsided like the tide. He lay on Ling Qingxue’s body like a deflated ball. Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”hurry up and go down!” You’re so heavy ...” Xia ruofei turned over with Ling Qingxue in his arms. The two of them lay on their sides and looked at each other. “Qingxue ... Why didn’t you say so earlier ...” Xia ruofei said gloomily. “How would I know you’re so evil!” Ling Qingxue glared at Xia ruofei and said,”do you expect me to tell you not to move when you enter the house? my ... My relative is here.” At this point, Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but blush and giggle. Xia ruofei turned over gloomily and lay on his back on Ling Qingxue’s fragrant princess bed. He looked at the muslin canopy above his head and said,””You little evil spirit ...” Ling Qingxue turned around and gently placed her face on Xia ruofei’s broad chest. She said softly,””Alright...Ruofe...In a few days...It will be fine in a few days. By then, you can do whatever you want ...” Ling Qingxue’s face was already red from embarrassment, as if it was about to bleed. Seeing Ling Qingxue’s shy look, Xia ruofei’s heart couldn’t help but flutter. He reached out to hug her delicate body and said,””You said it yourself! You’re not allowed to run when the time comes!” Ling Qingxue bit her lower lip and nodded slightly. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but hold Ling Qingxue’s beautiful face and kiss her deeply again ... Xia ruofei stayed in Ling Qingxue’s boudoir for a few hours. He only drove out of the Ling family villa when the effects of the alcohol had subsided in the evening. Back at the farm villa, Xia ruofei and ye Lingyun had a simple dinner together and then went upstairs to their room. He took a long, cold shower in the bathroom before the fire in his heart was slowly suppressed. Thinking about how Ling Qingxue had said shyly that she would let him do whatever he wanted in a few days, Xia ruofei’s heart could not help but flutter. His face revealed a look of anticipation. …… For the next few days, Xia ruofei mainly stayed in the farm. He had originally planned to travel around, but elder song was currently recuperating in Sanshan city. He had to prepare Chinese medicine every two or three days. Although Xia ruofei did not have to personally send her to guling courtyard, it was the security staff officer, Xu Wu, who brought a doctor from the medical team to collect the medicine from Xia ruofei. However, he would definitely not be able to leave Sanshan for a long time. Moreover, if anything were to happen to elder song’s condition, he could deal with it immediately if he stayed in San Shan city. Therefore, the travel plan was temporarily put on hold. Xia ruofei had invited Ling Qingxue to the farm to play a few times, but the girl probably knew what was going to happen and was still a little shy. She kept saying that she was busy with work and did not come. Xia ruofei did not want to be too impatient. Of course, the main reason was that he did not want to put pressure on Ling Qingxue. Everything on the farm was running smoothly, and the construction progress was also very smooth. For a moment, Xia ruofei, the boss, had nothing to do. And Xia ruofei was someone who couldn’t stay idle, so he started thinking of ways to get some money. The last time, the spirit map space’s upgrade was only half completed, and Xia ruofei had been thinking about it all this time! Xia ruofei started to take stock of the resources he currently had and quickly made a decision ...
