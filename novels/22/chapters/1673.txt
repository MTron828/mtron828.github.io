Chapter 1674: Popular all over the country (1)

Brook was sent to the ambulance first, and the police sent someone to the hospital to record his statement.

Before they got into the car, Xia ruofei said to Brook,””Captain Brook, if the injury is too serious, please remember to contact me. Maybe Chinese medicine has a better solution!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Xia ruofei had a good impression of Brook. Although he was the one who saved the situation, Xia ruofei would not have been able to create such a miracle without Brook’s guidance.

Hence, Xia ruofei did not want to see Brook being injured and have to bid farewell to flying.

“Okay, Xia!” Brook said gratefully. Thank you very much!”

Xia ruofei smiled and patted Brook’s shoulder before sending him to the ambulance.

Other than Brook, several passengers had suffered minor injuries during the explosion and the violent jolts. All of these needed to be handled by the A.I. Staff.

Alex stayed behind to accompany Xia ruofei to deal with the police’s questions.

After the ambulance left, Xia ruofei prepared to follow Alex to the special passage specially opened by the Australian Airlines. They would go through the immigration procedures first, and then cooperate with the police to make a statement.

At this moment, a voice came from behind,””Sir, please wait a moment!”

Xia ruofei heard the familiar Chinese and immediately turned his head. He only heard the sound of the shutter clicking a few times. Then, he saw a young face behind the single – lens reflex camera.

“I’m a passenger on this flight!” The young man said excitedly,”we all heard that you saved the entire flight! Thank you!”

Although Xia ruofei did not want to expose his identity, he was in a foreign country and they were Chinese people who had gone through thick and thin together. Since the other party had already taken a photo, he would not ask them to delete it.

He could only smile and say,”you’re welcome. I can’t live if the flight got into an accident. I only did it to save myself.”

After the passengers on the flight were evacuated, they gathered in this area to queue up for the entry procedures.

A special passage had been opened at the customs of Saipan, but many people were still waiting there because of the large number of people.

The Chinese passengers gathered around and expressed their gratitude to Xia ruofei. Many of them even took out their phones to take pictures. Some even took pictures with Xia ruofei and asked for his signature.

Xia ruofei was desperate. He could understand the feelings of his fellow countrymen who had just survived the disaster. He cooperated with everyone’s request for a group photo, but of course, he declined to sign an autograph.

The smile on Xia ruofei’s face was almost frozen. Finally, Alex and the other staff of Quang came to help him out of the situation. The Chinese people finally let Xia ruofei go. When he left, whether it was the Chinese passengers or the other foreign passengers, they all gave Xia ruofei a warm round of applause.

As they walked into the special passageway, Feng Rao asked with a smile,””Ruofei, how does it feel to be a big star?”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and said,”sister ran, don’t you know me?” I really don’t want to be in the limelight!”

Social media was so developed nowadays. Xia ruofei could foresee that these photos would soon spread to every corner of China. By then, he would be in the spotlight. He did not know how long it would take for the popularity to drop.

Feng Jing couldn’t help but chuckle. She thought of how Xia ruofei used to push her to the front and even made her a slightly famous “internet celebrity”. Now that Xia ruofei was going to enjoy the same “treatment”, she couldn’t help but feel a little mischievous and wondered how Xia ruofei would react.

Under special circumstances, Xia ruofei and Feng Jing were able to get their entry procedures done quickly after showing their Chinese passports.

According to the principle of local jurisdiction, the incident would be the responsibility of the local police of Saipan. Of course, most of the passengers were Chinese and Australian. As the main parties involved, China and Australia would also participate in the investigation of the incident. Of course, the Civil Aviation investigation Department should be the main party involved.

After entering Saipan, Xia ruofei was quickly invited by the local police to understand the situation. Feng Jing was also in the cockpit at the time, so she also made a statement.

In addition, as Saipan was the territory of the United States, the American Civil Aviation investigation Agency had already set off. By then, the Civil Aviation teams from China and Australia would also be there. Xia ruofei still needed to cooperate with their investigation.

Hence, after they left the police station, Alex had already arranged for Xia ruofei and Feng Jing’s accommodation and other related matters on behalf of qplease airlines.

Qishang did not arrange for a designated hotel in Saipan base, but specifically chose the best local hotel, the Grand Hyatt Hotel.

The Kaiyue hotel in Saipan was located on the legendary Micro Beach, surrounded by 14 acres of tropical gardens and reef lakes. It was a luxurious and tranquil place unique to the Northern Mariana Islands.

The hotel was about 11 kilometers away from the airport. After the group came out of the airport, they arrived in about 20 minutes by car.

The hotel was located on the beach. Naturally, Xia ruofei and Feng Jing’s rooms had an ocean view. Alex even specifically asked if they were a couple because it involved booking a few rooms, which made Xia ruofei and Feng Jing blush.
