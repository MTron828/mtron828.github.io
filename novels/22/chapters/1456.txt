Pang Hao said with a bitter expression,””Pingzi, did you come here today to deliberately attack me? I’m so handsome, and I’m considered a high – Class employee, but I still don’t have a girlfriend. You’re so lucky in love, is there any justice in this world?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but say,”Guan Ping, aren’t you a little too explosive?”

When Guan Ping heard the teasing of his two bad friends, he couldn’t help but smile bitterly. He picked up the glass and drank a large glass of beer, and began to pour out the bitter water.

The real estate agency that Guan Ping was in had several teams in each store. The store manager was in charge of all the teams, and the supervisor of each team had several salespeople under him.

Guan Ping had been working hard ever since he joined the company. He had completed a few big orders in the first half of last year, so he was promoted to Deputy Director. His future had been bright.

However, ever since the manager, who had been training him, was transferred to another store as the Vice store manager, his days had become a little difficult.

Originally, the supervisor had recommended him to take over, but the company’s headquarters had parachuted a female supervisor.

The female supervisor’s surname was Bai. She was a young woman in her early thirties who still retained her charm. It was said that her husband was the Deputy Supervisor of another store in the company.

There were many rumors about this director Bai in the company.

Many people said that she used her body to get to the top. When she was just an ordinary sales lady, she often flirted with clients for sales. Later, she jumped ship to a real estate agency company and quickly won the “favor” of many leaders in the company’s headquarters.

Some people even said that manager Bai’s husband was also a “wife makes the husband more powerful.” He had become the deputy manager of a big store despite his mediocre performance. In addition, his personality was a bit weak, so he turned a blind eye to his wife’s lifestyle problems.

Guan Ping had naturally heard of these rumors, but he didn’t take them seriously at first. It was harder for women to survive in the workplace than men, especially for outstanding women. There were all kinds of rumors and gossip accompanying them. When this manager Bai had just taken office, he had been in a rush, but he felt that she was quite outstanding.

However, after spending some time together, Guan Ping felt that something was wrong.

Manager Bai seemed to be a little too concerned about him. He often called him to the office for a private chat, and sometimes, intentionally or unintentionally, he would do some intimate actions.

Guan Ping had worked his way up from an ordinary sales consultant, so he was naturally very slick in dealing with people. Therefore, he tried to keep a certain distance from this manager Bai without falling out with her.

He didn’t know what manager Bai saw in him, but this kind of hidden harassment was getting more and more intense.

There was even one time after the team dinner, director Bai had specifically asked Guan Ping to send her home. In the car, under the influence of alcohol, he had touched Guan Ping and said a lot of explicit words.

Guan Ping could not avoid it, and could only choose to sternly refuse. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Ever since then, Guanping’s days in the company started to be difficult.

Manager Bai’s meticulous care for him in the past had suddenly turned into picking on him and criticizing him severely at every turn.

Guan Ping was after all a vice – Manager, how could he have any prestige in the team?

What’s more, after some time, Guanping was transferred to another store without any warning.

Although he was also a Deputy Manager of a team, this store was far inferior to his original store in terms of size and location. Naturally, their performance couldn’t be compared.

For a real estate agent whose main income was based on performance, this was undoubtedly cutting off Guan Ping’s source of income, and his income was reduced by a large amount.

Moreover, this all – knowing manager Bai seemed to have greeted the new boss of Guanping, and Guanping’s new store was not doing well.

Not only did the store manager and Deputy Store Manager not look happy, but other teams often openly snatched their orders, making the sales consultant in his team complain.

The days in Guanping could be said to be quite difficult to endure.

After hearing Guan Ping’s complaints, pang Hao said angrily,””How can there be such a shameless woman? Is there no one who can teach her a lesson?”

Guan Ping smiled bitterly.”This woman has a ‘Godfather’ in the headquarters. She’s also very close to many store managers. I’m just a Deputy Supervisor, barely a sales backbone. To put it bluntly, I’m just an ordinary employee. How can I fight with her?”

Xia ruofei sat there quietly and asked,””Pingzi, what are the future prospects of this company?”

Guan Ping pondered for a while and said,”the real estate agency industry ... How should I put it?” “The profits are definitely good, but the competition is very fierce. The biggest disadvantage is that the influence of policies is too obvious. Often, the state or local government will introduce one or two regulatory measures, and many small intermediary companies will close down. Also, the industry standards need to be improved. When the business can’t continue, there are also cases of them running away with the funds from the users ...”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”understood ...”

Pang Hao, who was standing at the side, saw that Xia ruofei did not have any reaction and could not help but say,””Ruofei, since Hiroshi isn’t happy with this company, why don’t we ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and interrupted pang Hao. He turned to Guan Ping and asked,””Hiroshi, if I’m not mistaken, the company you’re working for is called pioneer real estate, right?”
