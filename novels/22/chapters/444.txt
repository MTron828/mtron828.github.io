Chapter 445: The big banquet (1)

Wu Liqian’s head was buzzing. She couldn’t believe her ears.

Wasn’t song Rui’s old man the old man who had appeared in the news almost every day in the past few years? Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

For a small farm in Changping County, an office building that cost less than a few million Yuan was completed, and he even sent his grandson to congratulate him?

Could it be that after a few years of retirement, the old man had become so idle?

Of course, Wu Liqian knew that an old chief like elder song, even if he was no longer in his position, his influence in the country was still unparalleled. What’s more, although he had retired, the song family was still one of the top families in China’s political scene. No matter what, it was impossible for them to have the time to pay attention to such a small farm.

The only explanation was that Xia ruofei had a very high status in the old man’s heart.

Wu Liqian couldn’t help but take a few more glances at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei was also surprised. He said,””No way? The old general is actually concerned about such a small matter, what right do I have to do so?”

“I think so too,” Song Rui grinned and said,”you must have brainwashed my grandfather!”

Xia ruofei punched song Rui’s chest and laughed.””Get lost! I was just being humble, and you took it seriously!”

“I don’t think you’re overwhelmed by the favor!” Song Rui laughed and said,”if this were any other person, they would have gone crazy with joy, right?”

“Nonsense, Who are you? I’ve seen big scenes!” Xia ruofei said.

After he finished speaking, he reached out to song Rui and said,””Hand it over?”

“What do you want?”

“Nonsense! Since the Bureau chief sent you here, would he let you come empty – handed?” Xia ruofei said bluntly,”since you’re here to congratulate me, then quickly bring out the gift!”

“You’re really not holding back ...” Song Rui smiled bitterly and handed the long paper box to Xia ruofei.”Hold on to it!” This is a piece of calligraphy that the old master personally wrote this morning. You’re lucky ...”

Song Rui’s tone was sour.

Because elder song rarely gave inscriptions to others, his calligraphy was priceless. Even song Rui, as elder song’s grandson, had begged him several times but failed to get an posthumous child.

Of course, it was also possible that elder song knew what kind of person his grandson was, so he didn’t write for him easily.

But no matter what, song Rui was very envious when he saw Xia ruofei get elder song’s calligraphy so easily!

As for Wu Liqian, who had been paying attention to the situation here, she was even more shocked after hearing it.

Xia ruofei felt as if he had found a treasure and quickly took the paper box. Elder song’s personal inscription was not as exaggerated as an amulet, but at least it had a significant meaning.

At this moment, Liang Weimin came over to remind Xia ruofei that the auspicious time had arrived and that he had to prepare to go on stage to give his speech.

He said it as if Xia ruofei was a groom waiting for the wedding ceremony.

Hence, Xia ruofei did not have the time to introduce song Rui to the entrepreneurs and officials. He asked pang Hao to find a seat for song Rui.

As for elder song’s calligraphy piece, Xia Rufei handed it over to Ling Qingxue and said,””Qingxue, you have to help me take good care of it. This thing is too precious ...”

“Don’t worry! I’ll keep my hand on it!” Ling Qingxue chuckled.

“Yes, don’t give it to anyone else.” Xia ruofei said.

After he finished speaking, he walked towards the temporary stage in the small square. After two steps, Xia ruofei hurried back and took out the gift box from Hengfeng group from his pocket.

Xia ruofei stuffed the gift box into Ling Qingxue’s hands and said,””This is a gift from Mr. MA from Hong Kong. Please keep it well for me. There is a pair of bracelets inside for you. Open it and see if you like it.”

Ling Qingxue nodded.”I understand. Ruofei, you can go now!” She said.

The emcee that Liang Weimin had invited had already started speaking on stage. After a brief opening speech, Xia ruofei went up to the small stage amidst the applause of the audience.

Now that Xia ruofei had seen the world, he did not prepare a script and started his speech in front of the microphone.

Of course, the content of the speech was nothing more than to thank the local government for their support, to thank the higher – ups, to thank the business partners, and so on. In the end, Xia ruofei also announced that the first batch of foreign employees of paradise Corporation would be allocated a single apartment in the mixed – use building. If the employees got married and brought their family members over, they could apply to change to a two – bedroom apartment. Xia ruofei had specially reserved more than ten two – bedroom apartments. Besides five for entertaining guests, the remaining ten were reserved for the employees.

Following that, Xia ruofei also announced some incentive systems. For example, those who were promoted to supervisor level would receive better treatment in terms of housing. In reality, at the current stage of Tao Yuan farm, the only supervisors were Cao tieshu and Lei Hu. Pang Hao and ye Lingyun were considered to be in the middle level of the company, and their positions were slightly higher than Cao tieshu and the others.

Of course, Xia ruofei also announced that the company was going to recruit a few cleaners and chefs. In addition, he was going to recruit a new batch of farm workers and expand the security team. The farm would provide free lunch for the employees, and the company’s cafeteria would provide breakfast and dinner. The employees could use their credit cards to pay for their meals, so the food would naturally be much cheaper than outside.

When the employees of Tao Yuan farm heard this, they cheered. At the same time, when they heard that Xia ruofei wanted to continue recruiting, their thoughts started to wander. Tao Yuan farm’s treatment could be said to be first – Class in the surrounding areas. It was even better than some of the companies in the city. As for the treatment of the factories in the county and town, it was not on the same level as that of Tao Yuan company.
