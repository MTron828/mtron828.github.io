Therefore, after hearing Qingfeng Luo’s words, Zheng Yongshou immediately said,””Yes! Master!”

Then, he took out his phone and said,””Bo Shan, you’ve heard the words of the sect master, right? Arrange a schedule to arrive at Evarts Island as soon as possible and report to me!”

“Yes! Junior uncle Zheng!” Wang Boshan said,”please wait for a moment, sect master. I will do it now!”

“En!” Zheng Yongshou hung up the phone and turned to Qingfeng Luo. He said respectfully,”master, martial nephew Boshan is already making arrangements. Do you think ... We should head to the airport now and wait?”

“Alright!” Qingfeng Luo nodded and said. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The area they landed in was sparsely populated, and it was difficult to get a ride. However, this was not a problem for the two cultivators. The two of them were very fast, and under the cover of the night, they soon came to a road.

The two of them walked along the road, and after a while, a taxi passed by. They got in the car smoothly and soon arrived at the Meilan Airport in Ye City.

Peach Blossom Island.

After Wang Boshan hung up the phone, he looked at Xia ruofei and said respectfully,””Master, junior uncle Zheng’s last words must be to send us some kind of message!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”it’s not hard to guess!” What he wanted to say was definitely sword Kinesis flight. Since Qingfeng Luo and Zheng Yongshou were able to travel such a long distance from your sect’s star Island to Ye City in Nanhai province on their flying sword, it means that when they arrive at evates Island, they will most likely not choose to take a boat or a helicopter, but a flying sword!”

“Master is wise!” Wang Boshan said with admiration.

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”Let’s not worry about this for now. You should hurry up and book the tickets according to Zheng Yongshou’s request!”

“Yes! Master!” Wang Boshan quickly said.

He quickly booked tickets for Qingfeng Luo and Zheng Yongshou from Ye City to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and then transferred to Australia’s BlackBerry. After that, they would switch to a passenger plane to evac.

This was already the best route because Ye Cheng did not have a direct flight to Lisbon, so they could only add a transit in Kuala Lumpur.

The flight from Ye Cheng to Kuala Lumpur would take off in about two hours. After Wang Boshan booked the ticket, he quickly sent the relevant information to Zheng Yongshou and called him.

On the phone, Wang Boshan used a secret code to send a simple message to Zheng Yongshou, similar to “the situation is known, and the corresponding arrangements have been made.”

Xia ruofei had specifically instructed him to add this before he had called.

Xia ruofei watched as Wang Boshan finished his call. He sat on the sofa and pondered for a moment. Then, he said to Li Yifu,””Looks like I’ve still underestimated the ability of an early golden core cultivator! He was actually able to carry Zheng Yongshou on his flying sword for such a long distance ... I still don’t know enough about golden core cultivators!”

“Grand uncle – Master, what about the follow – up plan ...” Li Yifu asked hesitantly.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it’s okay. As long as Luo Qingfeng falls into the trap, it won’t be easy for him to escape!” However ... Since it’s very likely that they’ll land on the island directly, I’ll still have to go and check it out again to avoid giving themselves away at the last minute!”
