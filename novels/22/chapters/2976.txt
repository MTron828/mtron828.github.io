When they heard this, Wu Ming and Luo Feng couldn’t help but look at each other.

The impatient Wu Ming couldn’t help but say loudly,””Elder Tong, you must have introduced the wrong person! Our hand – written copy of the “glittering jewel true understanding” only has the second volume, and there is no first volume. It is also completely unsuitable for Qi refining stage cultivators to practice. All the fellow Daoists present today have a very good understanding of our lingjue mountain’s “glittering jewel true understanding.”Aren’t you misleading everyone with your introduction?”

Hao Qingsong had long since received Shao Qingyang’s voice transmission and understood the entire situation, so Wu Ming’s reaction was within his expectations.

Hao Qingsong stroked his beard and said with a smile,”young master Wu, please calm down. The ‘true understanding of the glittering jewel array’ that I’ve introduced was not provided by the lingjue mountain. It was submitted to the auction by another fellow Daoist at the last minute. I’ve already confirmed that it is indeed the complete content of the first and second volumes. There are no mistakes in my introduction.”

Hao Qingsong’s words were like a heavy bomb. It could be said that a single stone caused a thousand ripples, and all the cultivators from the various great sects that had participated in the auction were shocked.

Especially Wu Ming and Luo Feng, their eyes were wide open and their faces were filled with disbelief.

After he came back to his senses, the hot – tempered Wu Ming immediately exploded. He shouted,””Hao Qingsong, what is the meaning of your falling leaves sect’s actions? Are you trying to embarrass our spirit Vulture mountain? Our “the truth of glittering jewels” is about to be filmed, but you guys suddenly inserted another “the truth of glittering jewels.” Is there such a coincidence in the world?”

“Young sect Master Wu seems to have misunderstood us!” Hao Qingsong said unhurriedly. The auction is a spontaneous platform for fellow Daoists to exchange information. It’s just that this year it’s our Fallen Leaf sect’s turn to host it. In principle, as long as there’s no problem with the items you provide, we can’t stop you from entering the auction process for no reason. Could it be that after your sect hands in the ‘glittering jewel Wonderland’, the other fellow Daoists have no right to do so? It didn’t seem to make sense. And the “glittering jewel true understanding” submitted by this fellow Daoist is also different from the one submitted by the spirit Vulture mountain. As I’ve said just now, this handwritten copy contains the complete contents of the first and second volumes. ”

Hao Qingsong’s words naturally implied that the remnant scroll of the spirit Vulture mountain couldn’t be compared to the handwritten copy that was currently being auctioned.

Even though he didn’t say it out loud, the meaning was obvious.

Wu Ming flew into a rage out of humiliation and shouted in exasperation,””Then why is it that an item submitted at the last minute can be auctioned before our handwritten copy is about to be auctioned? Isn’t this blocking our path to wealth? How could there be such a coincidence? Hao Qingsong, you still dare to say that you didn’t do it on purpose?”

“Young sect Master Wu,” Hao Qingsong’s expression turned serious as he said,”your esteemed sect came to Shuangqing city two days ago. There doesn’t seem to be anything we’ve been lacking in in our hospitality, right?” I’ve met sect leader Wu a few times, so we can be considered friends of the same generation. But you always call me by my name. Is this how fellow Daoist Wu Tiancheng teaches his child?”

He was directly saying that Wu Ming had no manners.

Wu Ming’s face alternated between red and white. He snorted coldly and said, “Don’t try to change the subject! If it wasn’t for the fact that your fallen leaves sect has gone too far, would I be so angry?”

“Then What do you mean, sect Master Wu?” Hao Qingsong asked with a faint smile. “What should we do to stop you from getting rich?” Did you deliberately put this obviously more complete manuscript up for auction after your sect ‘s? Wouldn’t that be unfair to the fellow Daoists who might be willing to pay a high price for your sect’s copy? Will the other fellow Daoists also start to question our fairness? We can’t be criticized by so many fellow Daoists for the sake of the lingjue mountain’s wealth, can we? Young sect leader Wu, we, the fallen leaf sect, are hosting this auction to ensure that we have a clear conscience. We don’t expect everyone to understand. If young sect leader Wu wants to misunderstand us, we have nothing to say. But ... Can I ask sect leader Wu to be patient and not interfere with the order of the auction?”

Hao Qingsong’s words could be said to be reasonable and well – founded. Even Xia ruofei, who was sitting in the private room and watching the show with a smile, couldn’t help but give a thumbs up.

It was no wonder that Shao Qingyang had arranged for Hao Qingsong to host this auction. This old man really did have some skill. At the very least, his eloquence was much better than many cultivators who only cared about cultivating.

Wu Ming was truly rendered speechless by Hao Qingsong’s rebuttal.

More importantly, the cultivators of the other sects also believed that there were better things in Xuanji. Who would want a defective product?

If it was really the first and second volumes of the glittering jewel Wonderland, and it was complete, and the first volume was suitable for Qi refining stage cultivators, then the value of this handwritten copy was undoubtedly much higher than the one in the lingjue mountain. After all, in the current cultivation world, Qi refining stage was the backbone of the sect!

Moreover, the first and second volumes combined could even benefit Aurous core stage cultivators! nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Luo Feng, who was in the same box as Wu Ming, had been frowning the entire time. He didn’t say anything at first, but his mind was spinning quickly as he thought of a solution.

It was only after Wu Ming was rebuked by Hao Qingsong in a manner that was neither servile nor overbearing that he suddenly opened his mouth and spoke in a clear voice,”Elder Hao, there’s something I don’t understand. I hope elder Hao can advise me!”

Hao Qingsong’s brows slightly twitched, and he calmly said, “You’re elder Luo of the spirit Vulture mountain, right? What do you want to say?”

Hao Qingsong secretly raised his guard. Wu Ming, this hothead, wasn’t difficult to deal with. The truly difficult one was an old fox like Luo Feng.

Luo Feng said indifferently,”as we all know, the” glittering jewel truth “of our lingjue mountain is very helpful to the cultivation of the spiritual power of Aurous core stage cultivators. This has already been proven.” However, who could guarantee that this handwritten copy of the “true glittering jewel technique” that had suddenly appeared was the real one? Could it be that the falling leaves sect has already examined it?”

“Elder Luo, you must be joking. We naturally won’t take any cultivation technique items. Otherwise, we won’t be able to bear the responsibility if the cultivation technique is leaked!”

The corner of Luo Feng’s mouth slightly curled up as he said,””If that’s the case, does that mean ... Even your sect, as the organizer, can’t guarantee the authenticity of this item? What if a fellow Daoist was full of hope and spent a high price to buy this so – called ‘the glittering jewel manual’, only to find out that he had been scammed? In the worst case scenario, if some Rascal sees this loophole in the future and often uses this trick to swindle spirit stones in future auctions, won’t we also be unable to guard against it?”

Luo Feng’s words were full of profound meaning. He had grasped the easiest part to attack, and he kept emphasizing words like “it’s hard to distinguish between real and fake “and” so – called “to make the cultivators present more vigilant and suspicious.

Hao Qingsong’s expression froze for a moment before he forced a smile and said,”Elder Luo, you’re exaggerating things to scare us. Although we haven’t read the contents of the manuscript, we’ve examined the fellow Daoists who submitted the items. It’s not as if any cultivator who claims to have a cultivation technique can directly enter the auction process.”

Luo Feng seemed to have seen the light of victory, so he naturally followed up,”Elder Hao’s words are wrong! No matter what, the fact that cultivation technique items could not be inspected was a huge flaw. Otherwise, there wouldn’t have been such a farce of two handwritten copies of the “truth of the glittering jewel” today! If this problem can’t be explained clearly, I believe that fellow Daoists won’t be able to buy it with ease!”

Luo Feng’s words had caused some of the cultivators to become worried. Some of the cultivators who were originally excited and excited had calmed down a lot.

Hao Qingsong couldn’t help but feel a little troubled. Luo Feng’s relentless pursuit was within his expectations, but when Shao Qingyang had sent him a voice transmission, he had said that the spirit Vulture mountain might raise such a question, but the star Seizer sect would resolve it on their own.

Although he said that, Luo Feng had already forced him into a corner, and the star Seizer sect still didn’t say anything!

As he thought of this, Hao Qingsong couldn’t help but cast his gaze towards room 20.

In room 20, Luo Qingfeng looked at Xia ruofei worriedly and said,””Master, this Luo Feng is a bit hard to deal with!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”True gold fears no fire. He’s just putting up a last – ditch struggle!”

With that, Xia ruofei shot a look at Luo Qingfeng, warning him not to speak. Then, he waved his hand to remove the sound – proof barrier and said in a clear voice,””Elder Luo’s words are so ridiculous! Isn’t the spirit Vulture mountain offering a hand – written copy of a cultivation technique? Why is our ‘the truth of linglang’ being questioned so much, while yours can be auctioned in the open? Was this saying that only the officials were allowed to set fires, but the commoners were not allowed to light lamps? The spirit Vulture mountain is really overbearing!”

Xia ruofei’s words were equivalent to admitting that the star Seizer sect had submitted the two volumes of the glittering jewel true understanding.

The cultivators attending the auction couldn’t help but look at the ore with a hint of amusement. The spirit Vulture mountain and the star Seizer sect had fought over it. Although Wu Ming had proudly expressed that he was doing it for the sake of the sect, many people still thought that he had admitted defeat because of the budget. Soon, Wu Ming’s harsh words caused the star Seizer sect to fall into quite a bit of trouble.

It could be said that these two sides had already clashed today.

At this time, the star Seizer sect took out the handwritten copy of the “glittering jewel true understanding” and cut off the lingjue mountain. This was even more explosive.

Of course, there were also some cultivators who were wondering if the star Seizer sect was doing this on purpose to disgust and disgust the evil heart Mountain. Otherwise, how could it be so coincidental that the star Seizer sect also happened to have a hand – written copy of the ‘true understanding of the glittering jewel’? He had never heard anyone mention it before!

Hence, when Xia ruofei revealed his identity, many cultivators started to doubt the authenticity of the first and second volumes of the glittering jewel truth.

Upon hearing Xia ruofei’s voice, Wu Ming couldn’t help but fly into a rage. He shouted,””Why is it you again? You still dare to say you didn’t do it on purpose? Since when did your star Seizer sect have the “true glittering jewel Scripture”? No one here has ever heard of it before! Suddenly appearing on camera, I think you guys are here to cause trouble!”
