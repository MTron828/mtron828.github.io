Chapter 1135: The Jade Leaf works (1)

Translator: 549690339

After song Rui returned to his room, he didn’t even have time to lie down and sleep. He quickly asked,””What’s wrong? Do you need any help?”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”not for now. I’ll call you if I need anything.” You can just give me the car keys. ”

“Alright, you wait here, I’ll bring it over for you!” Song Rui said.

Xia ruofei tidied up the room after he hung up.

Xia ruofei had kept the most valuable glass – Type King’s Green square plate and the gold ingot in the realm. Yingying’s safe was much safer than any other safe in the world.

Now, Xia ruofei’s control of the space was far better than before. Without Xia ruofei’s clear instructions, the spirit map space would not indiscriminately swallow the Jade that was sent into the space. Hence, the king’s Green square card was very safe to put in the space.

Xia ruofei took out a stack of cash from the space and put it in his bag. Then, he was ready to leave.

At this moment, there was a knock on the door. Song Rui came over with the car keys.

Xia ruofei picked up his bag and walked out. After opening the door, he took the key from song Rui and said,””Thanks!”

“Ruofei, you had some drinks this afternoon. Can you drive?” Song Rui called out from behind,”do you want me to call a driver for you?”

Xia ruofei didn’t even turn his head. He waved his hand that was holding the car keys and said,””It’s okay, I’m fine with driving. Don’t worry!”

They took the elevator to the underground parking lot. Xia ruofei found song Rui’s Phaeton and quickly set the navigation to the Temple of Earth hospital. Then, he drove out of the parking lot.

It was not yet the rush hour in the capital. Although there were many cars on the road, the traffic was not too heavy. Xia ruofei drove nimbly through the traffic and arrived at Ditan hospital.

After he parked his car, he grabbed his bag with one hand and called Feng Jing with the other. He then rushed toward the outpatient building.

“Chairman!”

“Boss Feng, I’m here. Where are you guys?” Xia ruofei asked urgently.

“The image center on the fourth floor ...”

“I’ll be there immediately!” Xia ruofei hung up the phone and quickened his pace.

They took the elevator to the fourth floor of the outpatient department. Feng Jing was waiting at the elevator entrance. When she saw Xia ruofei, she called out with an ashamed expression,””I’m sorry, Chairman! I didn’t take good care of Lu You ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”let’s not talk about this for now. Where’s Lu You?” How is she?”

“She kept saying that she’s fine, but she injured her head. We were worried that there might be a problem, so we insisted on coming over for a checkup!” Feng Jing replied,”she’s doing a CT scan right now!”

Xia ruofei and Feng Jing talked as they walked towards the CT room.

Xia ruofei asked,”what happened?” How did you get your head injured when you followed him to the set to knock on the door?”

Feng Rao was a little embarrassed. “It’s all my fault for not taking good care of her. The weather forecast today said that it might rain in the afternoon. We have to finish all the scenes in the morning, so time was a little tight and the set was a little busy ...”

Feng Rao continued,”miss Lu was chatting with Duff the whole time. I was busy coordinating with the filming departments, so I didn’t notice her. I don’t know when she went to the other side. They were assembling the crane over there. In the end, one of the cranes suddenly fell off and hit miss Lu on the head ...”

Feng Rao revealed a look of lingering fear when she said this.

At that time, the crane that weighed more than 100 Jin had fallen from a height of more than two meters and landed on Lu You’s head. She had been scared silly when she saw this scene.

Her first reaction was that she was done for. Something big had happened.

With that height and heavy arm smashing into his head, even if he didn’t die, he would definitely be seriously injured.

Everyone was stunned by this scene.

When everyone ran over, Lu You stood up as if nothing had happened. Although she was also quite frightened, she did not seem to be injured at all.

However, at least five or six people saw the crane smacking Lu You’s head. Hence, even though Lu You kept saying that she was fine, Feng Jing didn’t dare to let her guard down. She immediately stopped filming and brought Lu You to the hospital for a checkup.

After all, modern medicine was so brilliant, but there were still many unknown areas in the brain. Feng Jing was also very worried that Lu You would be injured without her realizing it.

After Xia ruofei heard this, he felt a little relieved. From Feng Rao’s description, it was likely that the amulet had taken effect. Otherwise, even if he had suffered internal injuries, he would not have been able to feel no pain and act as if nothing had happened.

Xia ruofei looked at Feng Rao and comforted her,””Boss Feng, don’t worry too much. You know your own body well. I don’t think there’s a big problem!”

“It’s all my fault ...” Feng Jing blamed herself.”Chairman, should we inform miss Lu’s family?” Tian Shu ... Would director Tian ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it’s not that serious. Let’s take a look at the results first.” If there’s nothing else, don’t disturb Auntie Tian!”

“Alright ...” Feng Jing said.

The two of them waited at the door for a while. The door to the CT room opened and Lu You walked out with a coat in her hand.

After seeing Xia ruofei, Lu You was also stunned.

“What are you doing here?” Lu You asked.

“Can I not come?” Xia ruofei said unhappily,”I heard that you’ve gone to the film set to be a superwoman!”

Lu You lowered her head.”I didn’t know that an accident would happen. Do you think I wanted to?”

Feng Rao saw that the two of them were about to quarrel, so she quickly came over and said,””Chairman, it’s my fault for not doing a good job of on – site safety management. It has nothing to do with miss Lu ...” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei glanced at Lu You and saw that she looked like a wronged little wife. His heart softened and he could not bear to blame her anymore.

“Come with me for a moment!” He said.

“Why?” Lu You raised her head and asked.

Xia ruofei didn’t say anything and pulled Lu You’s hand to the side. Lu You’s face heated up, but she didn’t shake Xia ruofei’s hand off. She followed Xia ruofei to the side, half – pushing and half – backing.

Feng Rao’s eyes turned sad when she saw this.

Xia ruofei pulled Lu You to the stairwell of the emergency exit.

Lu You saw that Xia ruofei had brought her to a corner with no one around, and her heart was beating wildly. She did not dare to look Xia ruofei in the eye. She lowered her head and asked,””What do you want to do?”

Xia ruofei didn’t say anything. He reached out his hand towards Lu You’s chest.

Lu You was so embarrassed that her face turned red. She thought to herself,”is this guy’s beast nature going out and he wants to molest me here?”

Lu You was clearly overthinking.

Xia ruofei’s hand grabbed the necklace around her neck and pulled it out.

When Xia ruofei saw the Jade Leaf, the stone in his heart finally fell to the ground.

Since Lu You was wearing this Jade Leaf, the protective jade talisman must have taken effect. Otherwise, Lu You wouldn’t be in this state.

Lu You saw that Xia ruofei was holding the beautiful jade Leaf and knew that she had misunderstood. However, she quickly saw Xia ruofei reach out and grab the Jade Leaf that was still warm from her body. Her pretty face instantly became hot and she was so embarrassed that she did not dare to look Xia ruofei in the eye.

Xia ruofei did not notice Lu You’s bashful look. He focused on using his spiritual power to check the Jade Leaf.

As he had expected, some of the energy in the amulet had been consumed. It was obvious that the amulet had been activated when the crane hit Lu You’s head in the morning.

However, even though it had consumed some energy, the Jade talisman could still be used.

According to Xia ruofei’s estimation, this Jade Leaf could at least block a few bullets at close range. It was only a beam that weighed a little more than a hundred pounds, so it did not consume much energy.

Xia ruofei finally felt relieved.

Out of habit, he wanted to stuff this Jade Leaf into Lu You’s collar. He only realized that it was inappropriate when he reached out halfway, so he quickly put his hand down.

Xia ruofei smiled awkwardly and said,””You can put it in yourself!”

“Oh ...” Lu You’s face was red as she quickly stuffed the Jade Leaf into her clothes.

“No matter where you are in the future, you have to be more careful. Today’s situation is very dangerous!” Xia ruofei said.

“I know.” Lu You felt sweet in her heart and said softly.

“Tell me about the situation when the crane came crashing down!” Xia ruofei said.

Lu You thought for a while and said,”I can’t remember the exact details. I only remember hearing someone beside me shouting for me to Dodge. But I didn’t have time to react. The crane came crashing down on me ...”

When Lu You said this, she felt a lingering fear in her heart. At the same time, she also revealed a confused expression and said,””Then, I seemed to have seen a beam of light. The arm hit my head and rolled on the ground, but I didn’t feel any pain. I asked President Feng and the others, and they said that I didn’t see any light. They even said that I was hallucinating because of the injury to my head ...”

When Lu You said this, she also asked worriedly,””Xia ruofei, do you think my head is really injured and I just didn’t notice it?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”now you’re afraid?” Don’t worry! You’ll definitely be fine this time, but if you’re so careless next time, then I can’t be sure ...”

“How can you be so sure? “The results are not out yet ...” Lu You suddenly stopped. She thought of Xia ruofei’s action of checking the Jade Leaf just now and suddenly had an idea.

She pulled out the Jade Leaf that she had just stuffed into her clothes and asked, somewhat dumbfounded,””Could it be ... Could it be that it protected me?”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Looks like you’re not that stupid after all ...”

Lu youjiao glared at Xia ruofei and asked in disbelief,””So ... When the crane came crashing down, the ray of light I saw was ... Was ... Was not my hallucination?”
