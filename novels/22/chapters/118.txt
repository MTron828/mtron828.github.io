[This is the last chapter of the public page. It will be on the shelves at 12 noon tomorrow. Steel gun would like to ask for your subscriptions and monthly votes in advance. Thank you, everyone!] Hengfeng hospital’s Traditional Chinese Medicine clinic was very professional. It had all the necessary facilities to decoct Chinese medicine. There was a charcoal stove, a claypot, and unrooted water that was stored in a specially pure water bucket. Xia ruofei put the herbs into the claypot, added an appropriate amount of rootless water, and started to boil the medicine. The process of boiling the medicine was very boring, but he could not be distracted at all times. Although it was just a medicine to fool the public, Xia ruofei still followed the procedures listed on the internet strictly and spent more than half an hour to boil the medicine. He poured the medicinal soup into a porcelain bowl that was specially used to store Chinese medicine. Then, he poured the remaining unused medicinal herbs and the dregs into the furnace and burned them all. In this way, even the most brilliant Chinese medicine doctor would not be able to find out the specific prescription of his medicine. Xia ruofei checked again vigilantly. After confirming that it was safe, he summoned the spirit painting and took out the preservation box from the medium. After a few days of accumulation, he had 13 petals now. This was under the condition that Xia ruofei increased the frequency of using petals to two every three days. Otherwise, he could have saved more. Although the amount of exotic flower petals would increase greatly after the farm started operating, and there might even be a situation where they would be short of money, Xia ruofei still insisted on strengthening himself. After experiencing the torture of the terminal illness, Xia ruofei was very clear – headed and realized that only the improvement of his personal strength was real. Otherwise, everything else was just floating clouds. Xia ruofei used a pair of tweezers to carefully pick up one of the blue petals and put it into the medicinal soup. The flower petals dissolved into the medicinal soup without a sound. He stirred the medicinal soup with a spoon and did the same thing as last time. He placed the porcelain bowl into the spirit map space and used the difference in the flow of time to cool down the medicinal soup in a few minutes. Xia ruofei took out the medicine that had cooled down from the medium and kept the painting in his body. Then, he walked out of the room with the porcelain bowl. Dean Qin had been waiting outside the door for more than half an hour. He didn’t even sit down; he was anxiously pacing back and forth. Dean Qin quickly walked over when he saw Xia ruofei.””Mr. Xia, is everything settled?” “En!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Dean Qin, let’s go to the ICU!” “Okay, thank you ...” Dean Qin quickly said. The two of them hurried to the elevator. A cerebral hemorrhage was a very dangerous disease, especially since MA Xiong had fallen into a deep coma so quickly. Under such circumstances, the death rate was more than 90%, and they all died within a few hours to a few days, so the two of them felt a sense of urgency. As soon as he saw Xia ruofei and Dean Qin, Ma Zhiming immediately walked up to them. Most of Ma Zhiming’s relatives were watching from a distance with complicated expressions. Ma Jia, who had been spitting sh * t just now, even sneered and looked at Xia ruofei with disdain. In fact, not to mention Ma Jia and these relatives, even Dean Qin and the hospital’s brain experts also felt that Ma Zhiming was desperate. With such serious symptoms of cerebral hemorrhage, he could die at any time. How could Chinese medicine be effective? “Xia Sheng!” Ma Zhiming shouted. “The medicine is ready,” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”there’s no time to waste. Let’s give it to old master Ma immediately!” “Okay, okay ...” Ma Zhiming quickly said. He personally accompanied Xia ruofei and entered the ICU under Dean Qin’s guidance. Everyone put on sterile clothes and went through a full set of disinfection procedures before they finally entered MA Xiong’s ward. This was the first time that Ma Zhiming had seen his father since he returned to Hong Kong. The White – haired MA Xiong was lying on the hospital bed with his eyes closed. He looked extremely Haggard. His body was connected to all kinds of wires, and advanced medical equipment monitored his body’s various indicators at all times. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but take a few more glances at the skinny old man on the bed. He couldn’t associate him with the tycoon who was famous in the business world of Hong Kong. MA Xiong started from scratch and accumulated tens of billions of assets after decades of hard work. He was the ‘King of jewelry’ in Hong Kong. At the same time, the Hengfeng group founded by MA Xiong had been involved in many industries such as food and beverage, medical care, and finance in recent years. It was a true business Kingdom. However, such a business giant still seemed so vulnerable in the face of a sudden illness. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel the fragility of life. So what if he was rich? If the King of Hell wants you to die at midnight, you really won’t live to see five. “Daddy ...” Ma Zhiming’s voice was a little choked. “Master Ming, Mr. MA is in a deep coma. He doesn’t respond to external stimuli ...” Dean Qin said in a low voice. Xia ruofei carefully placed the medicine on the bedside table and said,””There’s no time to waste. We’ll feed the medicine to old Mr MA immediately.” “Mr. Xia, Mr. MA doesn’t have any swallowing reaction,” Dean Qin quickly said.”Should we perform a gastric intubation?” It was also very important to be careful when administering medicine to a patient in a deep coma. This was because a normal person would let the food enter their esophagus through swallowing, but there would be no swallowing reaction in a patient in a deep coma. The amount of Chinese medicine was relatively large. If it was taken directly, the success rate would be very low, and it was even likely to choke the lungs. However, if intubation was needed, the patient would suffer because the catheter usually entered through the nostril and was directly placed into the stomach. The process was naturally very painful. Of course, unconscious patients generally wouldn’t feel this kind of pain. Xia ruofei pondered for a moment.”Not for now. Let’s try it in small amounts first. If it really doesn’t work, we’ll intubate again.” “Ah? “This ...” Dean Qin was shocked.”Mr. Xia, this is too dangerous. No, no...” Dean Qin didn’t expect Xia ruofei to make such a layman’s decision. He didn’t have any hope for Chinese medicine to begin with, and now Xia ruofei’s decision made him even more suspicious of Xia ruofei’s medical skills. That was because Xia ruofei did not even know what was common sense! If it wasn’t for Ma Zhiming, Dean Qin would have scolded him. Ma Zhiming said without thinking,”Dean Qin, listen to Xia Sheng!” “This ... This ... Alright!” Dean Qin sighed and spoke. This was the case with private hospitals. They were the young owners, so they had the final say. Professionalism was useless. Dean Qin stood aside and watched as Xia ruofei made a scene. Xia ruofei lifted the head of the bed and scooped a small amount of the medicine. He gestured for Ma Zhiming to come over and help hold MA Xiong. Then, he held MA Xiong’s jaw and used a little force to make MA Xiong’s mouth open a slit. He used his other hand to hold the soup spoon and put the small amount of medicinal soup into MA Xiong’s mouth bit by bit. Dean Qin shook his head. Xia ruofei’s actions were too unprofessional. However, Xia ruofei was still very calm. After feeding her a small mouthful, he waited for a while before scooping up a large spoonful and preparing to feed her a second mouthful. Dean Qin almost couldn’t help but stop Yingying. It didn’t matter if the first mouthful was small, but the second mouthful was full. If Xia ruofei continued to mess around, the patient would be in danger. However, to Dean Qin’s surprise, Xia ruofei successfully fed him the entire spoonful of medicinal soup and quickly scooped another spoonful. Dean Qin took a closer look. When Xia ruofei was feeding him the medicine, MA Xiong’s throat was obviously swallowing! Dean Qin’s eyes almost popped out ... What was going on? Why would MA Xiong, who was in a deep coma, suddenly have a swallowing reaction? Could it be that his coma index has increased? Dean Qin pounced on the devices that were monitoring MA Xiong’s vital signs ...
