When Mayes found that the front door of his house was crowded with reporters, he was not in the situation at all.

Many of the reporters drove directly to Meyers ‘residence after leaving the press conference of the Espanyol club. Most of these reporters had partners, so on the road, one of them was in charge of driving, and the other was writing articles on their laptops. In short, they were racing against time and didn’t want to waste any time.

At first, Mayers didn’t notice anything unusual. After the news was exposed, there were many reporters wandering around his house. He had been locked in his house and didn’t show his face at all. He wanted to wait until the news died down.

He didn’t expect more and more reporters to appear at his door since 10 am. The sounds from outside kept coming in, making him upset.

Although the reporters were restricted by the law and could only gather outside his yard, they had all their cameras set up and aimed at his house.

Mayers was still a middle – Class man in his early years. He had bought the small detached house that he was living in now and had a lot of assets. However, a few years ago, due to business failure, his family had sold all of his other assets, leaving only this property. His wife had divorced him and left him with his children. He was left alone in this small building that was not bad.

In recent years, Mayes had not been looking for a proper job. He had basically been relying on the savings left from selling his assets and the government’s unemployment relief. His only hobby was football, and he was a die – hard fan of bar?a.

He used to be the backbone of Barcelona’s die – hard fan organization. Every match day, he would bring a large group of fans to cheer for Barcelona. When he had more money, he would also go on an expedition to cheer for Barcelona.

However, everything had changed since yesterday.

A few days ago, he had cooperated with Pablo to shoot that video for 500 euros, and now he was full of regret. But didn’t he take the 500 euros so that he could cheer for bar?a in the next away game?

In the past two years, he had basically not had any extra expenses. He was not particular about what he ate at all. He could even eat bread for a week in a row to fill his stomach. However, as long as he supported bar?a, he would not feel the pinch when he spent money.

However, after the incident, his annual pass was written off by Barcelona, and the fan organization quickly cut him off and fired him. He used to be a team he loved deeply. When he was in negative news, he abandoned him without any hesitation.

Thus, Mayes’s mood had been terrible for the past two days, as if his faith had collapsed.

More and more reporters gathered at the door, which made Meyers even more upset. Even though he had closed the doors, windows, and curtains, the voices of the reporters continued to reach his ears, as if countless bees were buzzing in his ears.

Mayers ‘mood was also extremely irritable.

He couldn’t hold it in any longer. He opened the window, stuck his head out, and shouted,””You’re harassing my normal life! Get lost immediately! Otherwise, I’ll call the police!”

The reporters were in this line of work. How could they be frightened by Mayes’s words? They were able to accurately grasp the boundaries of the law and know how to achieve the effect without breaking the law.

So, not only did Mayes’s loud shout not scare the reporters, but several reporters also took the opportunity to ask questions.

“Mr. Mayers, we’ve seen your latest video and came to you to verify it. Is the recording still there?”

“Mr. Mayers, don’t you want to say anything about the way The Sports Daily and Pablo shirked responsibility and put the blame on you?”

Mayers was stunned when he heard this.

He subconsciously asked,”what are you talking about?” What video? What recording?”

“Mr. Mayers,” a reporter shouted.”Since you’ve already chosen to film the truth to the outside world, why are you still running away?” It’s better to face the media openly!”

“What the hell are you guys talking about?” Mayers felt like he was about to collapse. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

When the reporters saw Mayes’s state, they also felt a little strange. One of them shouted,””The video you took yourself! “You said that you didn’t lie on purpose in the interview, but that Pablo paid you to follow his script. You even said that you saved the recording and the media are welcome to come and collect evidence! We’re here to collect evidence!”

Mayers felt as if he had been struck by lightning. He stood at the window in a daze, as if all the noise made by the reporters outside the courtyard had disappeared. His mind was blank.

After a long time, Mayers gradually recovered. He hid in the room and closed the window tightly. At the same time, he also pulled the curtains tightly.

Mayers leaned against the wall and muttered to himself,””Could it be ... Could it be that it wasn’t a dream? I ... I really met God? And ... God even took a video? What the hell is going on?”

Mayes had a very realistic dream last night.

In his dream, a person who emitted holy light came to him and used gentle words to calm him down. Under the guidance of the person whose face he could not see clearly, he followed his inner thoughts and said the words that made the reporters excited.
