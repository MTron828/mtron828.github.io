He was worried that Xia ruofei would bear a grudge because of this. That would not be worth it.

Hence, he rushed to the hotel early in the morning and explained to Xia ruofei immediately.

MA Xiong did not know that Xia ruofei had already met up with Blake in the hotel.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei was not a petty person and would not vent his anger on the Hengfeng auction house because of this.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I understand!” Mr. MA, since the auction allows ordinary guests to pay the deposit, we can’t break the rules ...”

MA Xiong heaved a sigh of relief and said,”Thank you for your understanding, Xia Sheng! Don’t worry, it’ll be fine if Blake goes to the auction, but if he dares to play any tricks, I won’t let him off easily!”

At the beginning of the year, MA Xiong should have supported Xia ruofei to go through legal procedures with Blake and Sue him for slander. In fact, MA Xiong had also put a lot of pressure on Blake’s catering group.

However, Xia ruofei’s request was for George Blake to make a public apology in the media. This was completely unacceptable to Blake’s group as it was a huge blow to their reputation.

Therefore, Blake’s group had asked an old friend of MA Xiong to mediate the situation.

MA Xiong still owed this friend a lot of favors in his early years. In the end, he could only go to Xia ruofei’s side with an apologetic heart.

Xia ruofei was relatively easy to talk to. He knew that MA Xiong must have his own difficulties. Moreover, it was not a big deal, so he agreed to let it go.

If Blake had provoked him this time, MA Xiong would not have cared about his feelings and would have settled both old and new scores to give Xia ruofei an explanation.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Mr. MA, it’s not that serious. I think he came to the auction to buy some truffles. He couldn’t have flown all the way from Europe to cause trouble, right?”

In fact, Xia ruofei had overestimated Blake. Although Blake didn’t want to cause trouble, the main reason he came to Hong Kong was because he knew that Monica was in Hong Kong. That was why he had come here.

In addition, he had also found out from the brochure that the truffle supplier for the auction was Xia ruofei’s paradise Corporation. If he could embarrass paradise Corporation at the auction, he would be more than happy to do so.

“I don’t think he would dare to!” MA Xiong said.

Xia ruofei’s eyes were cold as he said,””Even if he doesn’t cause trouble, I don’t want our truffles to be bought by Blake’s group.”

MA Xiong was stunned for a moment before he said awkwardly,”Xia Sheng, he’s already gotten a ticket to the auction. With the black group’s financial resources, there’s no way he’ll return empty – handed. After all, your truffles are of extremely high quality, and the harvest this year isn’t very good. High – end ingredients like this are rare everywhere!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Even if it can’t be avoided, we have to make him bleed a lot and hit him until he’s in pain!”

MA Xiong chuckled and shook his head.”The quality of this batch of truffles is so high. No matter who wants to buy it, they’ll definitely have to pay a huge price!”

Xia ruofei knew that MA Xiong did not understand what he meant but he did not explain further. He just smiled and changed the topic.

After breakfast, MA Xiong accompanied Xia ruofei and Feng Jing to the grand banquet hall on the third floor of the hotel to check out the auction venue.

The auction would start at 9:30 in the morning.

Then, MA Xiong returned to the lounge next to the banquet hall while Xia ruofei returned to the Presidential Suite to change into a formal suit.

In addition, he also had to take out the truffles from the spirit map space and put them in the cold cabinet in advance. In a while, the people from the auction house would come to the room to collect the truffles.

At around nineo’ clock, Feng Rao accompanied the manager of the auction house, Dong Jiajun, to Xia ruofei’s room. Xia ruofei took out the precious truffles from the freezer. Dong Jiajun examined them carefully and handed them to the staff who came with him. They then escorted the truffles downstairs.

Xia ruofei, who had changed into formal wear, took the elevator to the third floor with Feng Jing.

The big banquet hall on the third floor had been renovated. Whether it was the sign – in area at the entrance or the interior of the hall, the logos of paradise Corporation and Hengfeng group were hung everywhere. Exquisite promotional posters could be seen everywhere.

The screen at the entrance of the banquet hall and the large projector screen in the hall were also playing the promotional video that Hengfeng auction house had specially hired an elite team to rush out. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The guests attending the auction also arrived one after another.

In addition to the local tycoons, peace guards, and social celebrities, there were also many people with western faces coming out of the hotel’s internal elevator. Most of them were rich people and representatives of famous catering companies in Europe, America, and Australia invited by MA Xiong.

What made Xia ruofei feel a little regretful was that Tang He from the United States and Tang Yitian from Australia could not make it because they had other work schedules.

The two Mr. Tang called Xia ruofei to express their apologies.

At the same time, the two of them asked Xia ruofei to leave them some top – grade truffles. They expressed that they were willing to buy them at the price of the auction.

On one hand, it was to support Xia ruofei’s business. On the other hand, they really liked truffles, a top – notch delicacy.

Xia ruofei received the guest list in advance.

Other than Blake’s group, who had come uninvited and paid the deposit, the world’s most famous Western restaurant chains were all present. In addition, the Michelin restaurants, which might not be particularly large but were very famous in the industry, had also sent representatives to attend.

In addition, there were at least five European and American tycoons with assets comparable to Tang He and Tang Yitian who came in person.

Seeing the list, Xia ruofei jokingly said to Feng Jing,””CEO Feng, I’m guessing that Hong Kong’s airport will be very busy these few days!”

Feng Rao couldn’t help but chuckle. The preparations for the auction had gone very smoothly, and she was in a good mood.

Most of these rich people had come by private jet. It was estimated that the tarmac of Hong Kong airport could hold a small private jet exhibition.

At this moment, MA Xiong, who was dressed in a suit, walked over quickly.

“Xia Sheng! I’ll introduce you to a few friends later!” MA Xiong laughed and said,”mainly some old friends in Hong Kong. They are also very interested in you.”

“Oh? I’m just a young man, how can those rich people recognize me?” Xia ruofei joked.

“I might not have noticed you before, but after the one – headed abalone auction, I’m afraid not many people in the upper class of Hong Kong haven’t heard of you!” MA Xiong laughed and said,”a few of my old friends are complaining to me! They said that I didn’t inform them in advance, and as a result, I missed the chance to get the top – grade abalones. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you can tell them that there will definitely be more abalones. They just need to recognize the Paradise corporation’s brand. That’ll be fine.” Of course, there’s also your Hengfeng auction house!”

MA Xiong couldn’t help but laugh.

Dong Jiajun and Feng ke were in charge of the auction this time. MA Xiong was a man of virtue and prestige, so he didn’t have to personally welcome the guests at the entrance. After exchanging a few pleasantries, the two of them prepared to enter the hall and wait.

At this moment, Blake, who was wearing a custom – made Armani suit and had smooth hair, also walked out of the elevator.

He walked to the door and saw Xia ruofei. He stopped and looked at Xia ruofei with lightning – like eyes.

Xia ruofei, on the other hand, looked at Blake calmly.

After a long time, Blake curled his lips and said,”I heard that the truffles for this auction are all provided by your company? If the quality is good enough, our black group will consider taking care of your business. ”
