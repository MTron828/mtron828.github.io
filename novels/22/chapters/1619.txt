Chapter 1620: Greetings to elder song (2)

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”wait for my call!” I’ll call you when I’m free. ”

“En!” Song Wei smiled at Xia ruofei gratefully.

“There’s no need to be too anxious. The progress of my cultivation is very smooth. ” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll probably be staying in the capital for a few more days this time. I’ll try to help you break through to Qi disciple Level 3!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“I know.” Song Wei smiled and said,”hurry up and go! Don’t delay the important matters!”

Xia ruofei waved at Song Wei and turned on the left turn signal. He started the car and left the capital University.

At around Sixo’ clock, the traffic started to get worse. Fortunately, Xia ruofei had already driven out of the Urban area Center and was approaching the song family’s old house in the western suburbs of the capital.

At the foot of the lush green Hill, there were already guards on high alert.

Xia ruofei had made a call on the way here, so manager Lu had already sent elder song’s personal guard, Chen Gang, to wait at the outermost sentry post.

When he saw Xia ruofei’s Land Rover from afar, Chen Gang immediately said a few words to the Sentry at the gate and then jogged towards Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei obediently stopped the car in front of the yellow warning line. Chen Gang ran over and said to Xia ruofei,””Hello, Mr. Xia!”

As he spoke, he pulled open the door to the passenger seat and sat in the car.

A Sentry quickly walked over, and Chen Gang said,””The visitor registration is done. You just need to show them your id for them to check!”

Xia ruofei nodded, rolled down the window, and passed his driver’s license to the driver.

Even though elder song’s personal guard came to welcome them, the Sentinel still checked the documents meticulously. At the same time, he also checked the car to prevent other people or dangerous items from being brought in.

It could be seen how tight the security was.

After the inspection, the Sentry waved at the Sentry tower, and the bar in front of the gate slowly rose.

Xia ruofei took back his driver’s license and nodded at the saluted guard. Then, he started the car and drove into the elegant courtyard.

Although it was called a large courtyard, it actually occupied the entire mountain top.

Each household was separated by a large distance, forming individual courtyards.

Xia ruofei had been here once during elder song’s birthday. With his memory and the Special Forces ‘sensitivity to directions and landmarks, he did not need Chen Gang’s directions this time. He drove to elder song’s house with ease.

Manager Lu was waiting for him at the entrance of the mansion, hidden by the trees.

Xia ruofei quickly backed the car into the parking space, got out of the car, and walked over.

“Manager Lu, you’re killing a junior!” Xia ruofei extended his hand from afar and said,”how can I trouble you to welcome me personally?”

Although manager Lu was only elder song’s staff, his rank was on par with Tian Huilan ‘s. In other places, he was definitely a high – ranking official. Furthermore, he was elder song’s most trusted secret. Xia ruofei was also very respectful of him.

Manager Lu laughed heartily and said,”you little Xia!” His mouth was getting sweeter and sweeter! It’s not in vain that the Bureau chief Nags about you all the time!”

Xia ruofei said,”then I’m even more terrified. What right do I have?”

“Hahaha!” Manager Lu said,”to be honest, you’re the first one among the younger generation who can make the chief look so favorably upon you! Hurry up and go in! The chief is waiting for you!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said,”Oh right ...”

He took out a gift box of jaded skin cream from his bag and handed it to manager Lu.””It’s just a small token of my appreciation, you can give it to Auntie!”

Manager Lu was stunned. He did not expect Xia ruofei to have prepared a gift for him.

The jadeshi cream was now very famous. Even if manager Lu, a man, didn’t care about it, his wife often talked about it. She had long become a loyal fan of the jadeshi cream.

Moreover, this was a product of Xia ruofei’s company. Manager Lu had spent some time to understand what chief Wanwan was concerned about, so he naturally had to know the situation.

Therefore, manager Lu recognized it at a glance. It was the high – end series of jaded skin cream, jaded bone ice skin, which was priced at 3888 Yuan per box.

Of course, this was only the public price. In fact, it was very difficult to get this series because there were only a few of them on sale. Moreover, the price from the scalpers had never been less than 5000 Yuan a box.

The value of this gift wasn’t great to manager Lu, but the sincerity was rare.

Manager Lu thought for a moment and said with a smile,””Ruofei, I’ll take it! I’ll thank you on behalf of your Auntie. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Hi!” They were all products from their own company and were not worth much! By the way, if you’re done, give me a call and I’ll have someone send it to you. ”

“No need, no need.” Manager Lu smiled and said,”if my wife needs it, she will go online to buy it!”

“Why do you need to buy it online when you’re using it on your own people?” Xia ruofei did not allow any room for discussion.”It’s decided then! If you don’t agree, I’ll send you two boxes every month ...”

Manager Lu couldn’t help but be surprised. Then, he smiled bitterly and said,””You little Xia ... Alright, alright! I’ll give you a call when my wife runs out of them, but don’t send her the jadeskin series. The basic version is enough for her!”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei said readily.

The two of them chatted as they walked through the courtyard and arrived at the backyard where elder song lived.

The weather in the capital was still relatively cold. The backyard, which had been planted with a lot of vegetables, now seemed a little desolate. The vegetable fields were all bare.

Under manager Lu’s lead, Xia ruofei walked through the courtyard and saw elder song drinking tea in the central room.

After seeing Xia ruofei, elder song immediately showed a kind smile. He waved and said,””RUO Fei is here! Come over and sit ...”

“Hello, Grandpa song!” Xia ruofei walked over and bowed to elder song respectfully.

The old man in front of him could be said to be confiding in him, almost treating him as a junior of his own family.

Although Xia ruofei didn’t want to rely on elder song for his own personal gain, he still respected this legendary general from the bottom of his heart.

“Good, good, good!” “Sit down,” elder song said with a smile.

Xia ruofei sat down on the chair beside elder song. He looked at elder song across the coffee table and asked,””Chief, how’s your health?”

“Very good!” Elder song laughed heartily and said,”if it wasn’t for the organization’s restrictions, I would have let a few of my doctors take a break!”

“Ruofei,” manager Lu said with a smile,”the Bureau chief’s body has been in good shape recently, and his mental state is getting better day by day. His old buddies can’t help but come to his house to ask for advice on health – Maintenance recipes!”

Elder song couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

Xia ruofei didn’t need to ask. He could tell that elder song was in good health. He was much better than the last time he came to visit.

There was no doubt that this was the work of the Spirit gathering Jade Guanyin.

Being bathed in spiritual Qi all day long, it would be strange if elder song’s body was not well!

Based on the current situation, as long as he trained hard and was supplemented by the “nutrient solution” provided by Xia ruofei, elder song could live for another 20 to 30 years without a problem.

Moreover, this was not the kind of life that relied on the hospital’s instruments and drugs to prolong life. It was a very good quality of life in old age.

Elder song’s value to the entire song family went without saying. It could be said that as long as old song was alive and well, the song family would get better and better, and no one would dare to covet it.

From this point of view, Xia ruofei’s contribution to the song family was huge. It was no wonder that not only did elder song favor him, but even his children were grateful to Xia ruofei and were very friendly.

Elder song also looked at Xia ruofei carefully and said with relief,””Not bad, not bad! It looks like you’re in good shape too! Young people should also take care of their health!”

“Thank you for your concern, Grandpa song. I’ll be careful!” Xia ruofei said respectfully.

Eccentric song smiled and nodded. After chatting for a while, he suddenly asked,”By the way, I heard that you went to xiangnan province with the Qiming family’s girl some time ago?”
