Chapter 1660: An earth – shattering event (1)

“Guli, were there any abnormalities in the cockpit before this?” asked Captain Brook quickly.

“About forty minutes ago, I entered the cockpit and asked the two pilots what they wanted to eat for lunch. At that time, I didn’t find anything unusual. Later, I went to the back cabin ...” Guli said.

Captain Brook then looked at the other first – Class flight attendants.

“The co – Pilot, Mr. Wilkinson, had gone to the washroom once ...” One of the flight attendants said.

“What? Wilkinson has left the cockpit!” Brook cried out.

The first thought that came to Brook’s mind was that there was something wrong with Captain Johansson! After the co – Pilot left, he was the only one left in the cockpit.

However, the flight attendant immediately said,””When Mr. Wilkinson left, he called me into the cockpit according to the rules. I only left after he returned to the cockpit.”

Since the plane crash at wings of Germany caused by the pilot’s suicide, most of the world’s airline companies had urgently updated a new rule, which was to always maintain two or more people in the cockpit.

Wilkinson’s actions were completely in line with the rules.

Brook was confused. He asked again,””What else is there?”

“When Wilkinson came out of the washroom, he brought Captain Johannson’s lunch into the cockpit.” Another flight attendant said,”he also told me to send his lunch in half an hour. I was delivering his lunch when I realized that I had lost contact with the cockpit ...”

“I’ve seen Captain Johannson’s lunch before ...” Brook felt that something was not right.

The plane was now slowly descending to 28000 feet. Brook’s heart was racing. He was about to knock on the door and try to get in touch with the cockpit when he suddenly saw the indicator light of the communication device next to the cockpit door flash. Then, the communication device also made a prompt sound.

Brook and Guli looked at each other. Then, Brook stepped forward and picked up the communication device with a serious expression.

“This is the cockpit!” The voice of the co – Pilot, Wilkinson, came out of the communication device.

“Wilkinson, this is Brook!” Brook quickly replied. What was happening? Quickly open the cockpit door!”

“Captain Brook, I have decided to end my life!” Said Wilkinson calmly.

Brook felt as if he had been struck by lightning. The worst situation had happened.

He quickly said,”Wilkinson!” Don’t do anything stupid! Quickly open the cabin door!”

Wilkinson remained unmoved and calmly said,””Captain Brook, I’ve been planning for this day for a long time. I’ve long lost the courage to live. My only wish is to do something earth – shattering so that all of Australia and the world will remember my name forever!”

Brook’s face turned pale. Such crazy words came out of Wilkinson’s mouth, but he was so calm. It was clear how strong his will was. Besides, Brook could almost tell from Wilkinson’s words that this man might have already suffered from serious depression.

But how did he pass the psychological assessment? What are the company’s aviation doctors doing? Brook roared in his mind.

He could only try his best to calm his tone as he tried to persuade her.””Wilkinson, you must not go to the extreme! This is just a mental illness. You can recover through active treatment!”

“Captain Brook, don’t do things in vain.” “I’ve been waiting for this day for far too long. No one can persuade me to turn back, not even God!” Said Wilkinson with a chuckle.

“No...” Brook said in despair,”where is Captain Johansson? What did you do to him?”

“He’s already gone to see God before us. ” “I want to apologize to his family. He’s a good old man, and he’s going to retire in three months ... I put a highly toxic drug in his lunch. I didn’t want to do it, but if I didn ‘t, he’d definitely stop me!”

“You’re crazy ...” Brook felt his blood turn cold.

“Even though you can’t help me convey these words to Captain Johannson’s family, don’t you still have the black box?” “If they can find it at the bottom of the sea ...” Said Wilkinson with a smile.

The black box contained a cabin sound recorder that would record all the sounds in the cockpit. If the plane crashed and the rescue personnel could find the black box, Captain Johannson’s family would indeed receive Wilkinson’s “apology.”

After listening to Wilkinson’s words, Brook finally realized that they were now in the middle of the vast ocean.

If the plane crashed, there would basically be no corpse left. Just thinking about it was enough to make people shudder.

“Don’t be like this, Wilkinson!” Brook pleaded,”there are more than 200 passengers on the plane, and so many crew members. They are all innocent ...” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

From Brook’s words and expression, the crew members had already guessed the truth of the matter. Their faces were all pale and their hearts were filled with despair.

“Perhaps this is God’s choice!” Wilkinson laughed and said. Goodbye, Captain Brook! Don’t worry, I’ll control the plane to fall into the sea smoothly. I’ll try my best to make everyone feel more comfortable at the last moment ...”
