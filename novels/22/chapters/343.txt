Chapter 344: Chapter 334 – finally together (1)

Xia ruofei arrived at the West River Moon Club at around 11 am. However, Ling Qingxue was still nowhere to be seen even when it was almost 12 am. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile bitterly, but there was nothing he could do about it. He had said everything just now, but he didn’t set a specific time. Ling Qingxue had also said that she was busy at the company, so what was the point of coming a little later? ‘It seems like this girl is still angry ...’ Xia ruofei thought to himself. However, he quickly revealed a vicious expression and muttered to himself,””If you dare to not take your husband seriously, I’ll teach you a lesson later ...” Unfortunately, Ling Qingxue could not hear Xia ruofei’s harsh words. He waited for a full twenty minutes before there was a soft knock on the door. Then, the waiter pushed open the door of the private room. A series of footsteps could be heard, and Ling Qingxue’s graceful figure appeared at the door. Ling Qingxue had put on light makeup today, and her white jade – like skin looked even more crystal clear and moving. She was wearing a white knitted sweater under her long beige windbreaker, which outlined her proud curves. Pencil – grey skinny jeans tightly wrapped around her long legs. Xia ruofei could not help but think of one thing when he saw her. Below the chest were the legs ... Ling Qingxue naturally felt Xia ruofei’s slightly invasive and heated gaze. Her pretty face blushed slightly, and at the same time, she felt a trace of shyness and joy in her heart. As long as this man was her sweetheart, even if he showed his lecherous face in front of her, the girl’s heart would only be filled with joy. Ling Qingxue smiled and said,””Miracle doctor Xia, scoundrel Xia, I’m here. Please sign the contract ...” Xia ruofei chuckled as he walked up to Ling Qingxue and grabbed her hand. He even touched Ling Qingxue’s soft, white hands mischievously. Ling Qingxue’s face turned slightly red. She tried to break free, but to no avail, so she let Xia ruofei do as he pleased. “It’s almost 12:30, you must be hungry!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”let’s eat first!” “Then the contract ...” “That’s a political task my father – in – Law gave me. Are you afraid I won’t sign it?” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Ling Qingxue lowered her eyes and asked,”what father – in – Law?” I haven’t agreed to marry you yet ...” “It’s only a matter of time, so don’t mind the details!” Xia ruofei chuckled. Ling Qingxue looked around the private room and said,””I haven’t scolded you yet! Didn’t you say you were going to eat? Why did he find such a place? This doesn’t look like a place to eat!” This private room had a quiet and elegant environment, but it was not like the layout of a normal restaurant’s private room. Strictly speaking, this was actually a suite. The room they entered was a small dining room, which was connected to a reception room and a large lounge next to it. All the furnishings were very complete. And with the warm lighting and soft music, the entire private room had an ambiguous atmosphere. Ling Qingxue’s heart couldn’t help but beat faster, and her face slowly turned red. “Didn’t I already tell you? Don’t mind the details!” Xia ruofei said,”there are tables and chairs here. Why isn’t this a place to eat?” “There’s still a bed!” Ling Qingxue blurted out, and her face immediately turned red. Xia ruofei smiled and pressed Ling Qingxue down on the chair.””Let’s eat first, let’s eat first. Don’t let my wife starve ...” Ling Qingxue rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei flirtatiously and did not say anything else. “Waiter, please serve the dishes!” Xia ruofei called out. Xia ruofei didn’t even need to order when he came here. President Zheng had arranged everything properly, and all the dishes had been prepared. They were just waiting for Ling Qingxue to come and they would be served immediately. Soon, waiters in cheongsam entered the room with plates of dishes. Because there were only two people, the amount of food arranged was not much, but each dish was very exquisite. As for the ingredients, they were naturally Taoyuan vegetables. Four dishes and a soup, the color, smell, and taste were all complete. In the end, the waiter even brought a bottle of red wine that had already been awakened. She poured the wine into the wine glasses in front of them and placed the bottle on the table. She bowed slightly and left. Xia ruofei had already instructed that all the waiters would leave after the dishes were served and that no one was to disturb them without permission. Xia ruofei smiled and raised his glass.””Qingxue, it’s been a long time since we’ve sat down and had a meal together. Come, let’s have a drink first,” Ling Qingxue nodded lightly and quietly picked up her glass. She lightly clinked her glass with Xia ruofei’s and took a small sip. Xia ruofei, on the other hand, raised his head and drank the wine in one gulp. As someone who was born in the military, he had always been drinking wine and eating meat in large mouthfuls. He had no interest in such an elegant thing as tasting red wine. This was really a waste of the expensive bottle of Laffer red wine that boss Zheng had carefully prepared. After drinking a mouthful of red wine, Ling Qingxue’s face immediately blushed. Her fair face with a tinge of red and her moving eyes made Xia ruofei’s heart race. He poured himself some more red wine and then said,””Qingxue, you’ve ignored me for three days. Your anger should have subsided by now ... I’m more wronged than Dou ‘E!” Ling Qingxue glanced at Xia ruofei and said,””He deserves it! Who told you to treat another woman behind my back ... That one that hurts?”Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels
