Chapter 3: Spiritual Map Space

Xia Ruofei vaguely remembered that when his grandfather was still alive, he would often fiddle with the scroll in his hand. It looked like an old item, but that was all. After so many years, Xia Ruofei did not find anything special about it.

Xia Ruofei even vaguely remembered that when this scroll was opened, it was a painting. The contents of the painting were very simple, it was just a piece of grassland with a clear spring.

When he was young, Xia Ruofei had asked his grandfather about the background of this painting out of curiosity. In the end, even his grandfather did not know much about it. He only knew that it was passed down from his ancestors.

Why would an inconspicuous painting suddenly emit golden light?

“What exactly is going on?” Xia Ruofei muttered to himself as he reached out to pick up the scroll and slowly opened it with a curious expression.

However, it was different from the past. The moment Xia Ruofei opened the scroll, the golden light intensified. Then, he suddenly felt a huge pulling force coming from the painting.

Immediately after, he felt his vision blur, as if he had teleported. In the next moment, he realized that he had appeared in a completely unfamiliar place.

This was too strange.

The instinct from being in the special forces made Xia Ruofei instinctively make a defensive move. Then, he quickly scanned his surroundings, hoping to find a safe hiding spot to avoid being attacked from both sides.

However, he soon discovered that the location he was in was practically unobstructed. There was no place for him to use as a bunker—he was standing on a land of black soil. This piece of land was estimated to be only one acre or so. Looking around, he could see the end of it.

The area beyond one acre was covered in faint green fog. With Xia Ruofei’s eyesight, he could not see anything beyond.

At the center of this black land was a clear spring. The spring water gurgled out, forming a small pond about a meter in radius.

Beside the pond, there was a plant that he could not identify. It was about a foot tall and had long leaves that were two fingers wide. The leaves were green and looked full of vitality.

Of course, the most eye-catching thing was the flower growing on the plant.

This flower only had three petals, and each petal was different in color. They were blue, yellow, and red.

However, this simple flower that had three petals gave off a delicate and alluring feeling, as if it contained the truths of the world.

Even Xia Ruofei, who was still in shock, couldn’t help but stare at the flower for a few more seconds.

However, he quickly regained his focus—now was not the time to be distracted.

He was clearly looking for a first-aid kit in the rental apartment earlier. Why did he suddenly appear in this strange place?

The surroundings and the area above were all shrouded in a hazy green mist and he was unable to see through.

Hence, Xia Ruofei’s top priority was to find a way out and leave this place.

Hence, the first thing Xia Ruofei did after regaining his senses was to walk towards the boundary of the land.

This piece of black land was almost circular, with a diameter of about 28 to 29 meters. Soon, Xia Ruofei arrived at the edge.

He reached out his hand tentatively and soon discovered that the mist was like an invisible barrier. A soft but tough force blocked his hand.

Xia Ruofei did not believe it. He took a few steps forward and changed another position to continue testing out. The result was the same.

The green fog looked extremely thin, but not only could it block one’s vision, it also formed a barrier that could not be seen with the naked eye. This barrier did not have any lethality, but it was extremely tough and could not be penetrated.

“What should I do?” Xia Ruofei could not help but mutter to himself. “There is no way out…”

Helpless, he could only return to the small pond at the center of the land.

Suddenly, Xia Ruofei widened his eyes and looked around quickly. The more he looked, the more surprised he seemed.

“This… why is it so similar to the contents of the painting?” Xia Ruofei could not help but mutter to himself.

There was a circular piece of land with a clear spring in the middle. There was a nameless plant beside the pond and there was a misty green fog around it… Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Xia Ruofei remembered seeing this painting when he was young. Other than the lack of green grass on the ground, it was exactly the same as the painting he had seen before!

“Could it be… that I’m in that painting?” Xia Ruofei had a bold thought.

Xia Ruofei was also shocked by his own thoughts, but the more he thought about it, the more he felt that it was possible. After all, the changes in environment was only after he opened the scroll.

Xia Ruofei had been in the army for many years and had received much education. At that moment, he felt as if his worldview had collapsed.

He stood beside the pond in a daze for a long while.

Xia Ruofei, who had gone through the harsh training in the Lone Wolf Assault Team, had an extremely calm mind. No matter what, he would not lose his cool. However, such a strange experience still made his mind temporarily blank.

After a long while, he thought of a serious problem—how should he leave this place?

For an elite of the special forces to be trapped in a painting without being able to do anything, this was truly a huge joke.

Xia Ruofei smiled bitterly and muttered to himself.

“God… Am I going to be trapped here forever… I want to go out!”

Just as he finished speaking, Xia Ruofei suddenly felt his vision blur. That familiar pulling force and dizziness struck him again. In the next moment, he realized that he had returned to the messy rental apartment.

In his hand was the painting.

Xia Ruofei widened his mouth in shock.

“It is actually controlled by voice? That can’t be.”

He couldn’t help but cast his gaze at the painting in his hand. This painting still looked ordinary. The old scroll was covered in mottled traces, and it was obvious that it had the aura of time.

Xia Ruofei carefully observed the contents of the painting and was even more certain that he had just entered the painting.

As an elite of the special forces, he would subconsciously remember many details.

For example, the plant by the pond that he couldn’t name, as well as the delicate and beautiful flower with only three petals on it.

With a glance, Xia Ruofei quickly spotted the plant in the painting. The flower on it and even the veins of the leaves were exactly the same as what he saw by the pond.

There was actually a hidden secret within the painting. There was another mysterious space within it!

The usually calm Xia Ruofei could not help but become very agitated.

He had found a treasure this time!
