Xia ruofei didn’t immediately answer Zhao Yongjun’s question. Instead, he asked curiously,””He’s being sent out at such a low level, and it’s in the southeast province, which is so far away from Beijing. It seems that this grandson’s position in the Liu family is very ordinary!”

“Then you’re wrong. On the contrary, he’s the favorite grandson of the Liu family’s old master! Otherwise, we wouldn’t have arranged for him to enter the system to develop. ” Zhao Yongjun said,”but this guy is really useless. He was only released this time because he had no choice ...”

Then, Zhao Yongjun briefly told Xia ruofei about Liu haojun ‘s’ glorious history ‘and said,””I despise this kind of people the most! It wasn’t a big problem for a man to be unable to control his lower body, but this guy didn’t care about anything at all. He directly made a move in the Department he led, and when there was a problem, he immediately shirked it. Even a rabbit wouldn’t eat the grass by its nest! The people in the industry all despise him!”

After Xia ruofei heard this, he couldn’t help but frown. So this Liu haojun had a past record! Now that Wu Liqian was working with him, could it be that he had that kind of intention again?

Xia ruofei realized that this matter might be more complicated than he had imagined.

“RUO Fei, how did this bastard offend you?” Zhao Yongjun smiled and said,”tell your bro!”

Xia ruofei didn’t hide anything from Zhao Yongjun. He briefly explained the time of the Tao Yuan pharmaceutical factory project and said,””I definitely want to give this achievement to Wu Liqian ... By the way, sister Qian used to be aunt Tian’s Secretary. Aunt Tian only demoted her before she was transferred to the publishing and Reform Committee. I’m on very good terms with her!”

“That’s a little unsightly,” Zhao Yongjun said.”He didn’t even follow the most basic rules of officialdom ... If this happened to anyone else, it would be a little unbelievable, but I believe that Liu haojun would definitely do it!”

“If he wants to steal sister Qian’s political achievements, he’ll have to see if he has good teeth!” Xia ruofei laughed coldly. Big brother Zhao, thank you for your information!”

“Do you need me to give you a call in the capital?” Zhao Yongjun asked. Or we can go to the three mountains again. Don’t worry, with us here, he won’t dare to be presumptuous!”

“You’d better focus on the peach blossom Association’s matters first!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ll handle this myself. If you really need my help, I won’t hold back!”

“That’s good! Anyway, you’ve been managing the southeast province for so long, and your connections are not bad! You can handle it yourself!” Zhao Yongjun smiled and said,”but I won’t let that B * stard off easily either. I’ll spread this news around the capital and let everyone see how low this B * stard can be!”

“Thank you, brother Zhao!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Hey! You don’t have to be so polite with me. ” Zhao Yongjun smiled and said,”it’s just a matter of talking. “Besides, I might not even need to do it myself. I just need to tell Xiao Rui, and he’ll definitely be willing to spread the news. As long as it’s related to the Liu family’s generation, Xiao Rui doesn’t even need to mobilize anyone. He’ll definitely be in a state of high spirits!”

Xia ruofei suddenly thought of the scene when song Rui was up against Liu haofan and couldn’t help but laugh.

After chatting with Zhao Yongjun for a while, Xia ruofei hung up the phone as he was still thinking about the Tao Yuan pharmaceutical factory project.

He sat behind his desk and subconsciously spun the pen in his hand. After thinking for about ten minutes, he picked up the phone on his desk and called Dong Yun’s office.

“Chairman!” Dong Yun said.

“Director Dong, tell the people in Changping County that the company headquarters has just moved and things are getting busy. I’m afraid we won’t have time to receive them in the near future!” Xia ruofei said.

“Ah?” Dong Yun exclaimed and asked,”Chairman, are you sure you want to reply to them like this?”

“I’m very sure!” Xia ruofei said,”just say what I said, and don’t change a single word!”

“Alright!” Dong Yun immediately said.

She was smart and didn’t ask for further reasons, because she knew that when her boss had made a decisive decision, the only thing she had to do was to firmly carry it out.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”also, let Xue Jinshan form an inspection team. You will personally lead the team to Changtai County, Qingyuan county, and a few other surrounding counties and cities to re – inspect the location of the pharmaceutical factory.” This trip will be more high – Profile! Take the initiative to contact the media and release the news!”

The surprise in Dong Yun’s heart could not be any greater. The location of the branch of Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory had actually been carefully verified. In addition to taking into account factors such as geographical location and climate, it had also been specially connected to the farm of Taoyuan company.

Now that the Changping County had given them such a huge discount, it could be said that both parties were happy to see the entire project being moved to Changping. However, Xia ruofei had already started to inspect the new site before the two parties had even had their first contact. This was really puzzling.

“Chairman, are you ... Not satisfied with the conditions offered by Changping?” Dong Yun asked carefully.

“There are other reasons.” Xia ruofei said,”just do as I say!”

Dong Yun knew that Xia ruofei did not want her to ask too many questions, so she immediately said,””Understood, I’ll make the arrangements immediately!”

The first thing Dong Yun did was naturally to reply to the people at Changping County.

Just as Dong Yun finished her call to the county party Committee and began to discuss with Xue Jinshan about the new site selection, Liu haojun couldn’t wait any longer in the office of the Changping County party Committee. He directly called the Deputy Director of the county party Committee, Guo Zhiguang, who was in charge of the specific coordination of this matter.

“Director Guo, how’s the contact with the Paradise Corporation going?” Liu haojun asked in dissatisfaction.

“Secretary Liu, I was just about to report to you!” Guo Zhiguang quickly said. Two minutes ago, peach blossom company gave us a reply ...”

“Oh? What were they waiting for? Hurry up and arrange the reception work!” Liu haojun said happily.

In his opinion, it was naturally the Paradise company who came to discuss the project happily. After all, he had specifically asked Guo Zhiguang to reveal a little bit of the preferential rates that the county could give to the Paradise company.

Guo Zhiguang smiled bitterly.”Secretary Liu, the Paradise Corporation said ... Their headquarters have been moving recently. There are many complicated matters. They might not have time to talk about this project for the time being ...” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Liu haojun was stunned, and his face immediately darkened. He said,””What the hell? This company was so arrogant? Chief physician Guo, could it be that while you were communicating and coordinating ...”

“Secretary Liu,” Guo Zhiguang quickly complained,”I was very polite when I talked to them. They also said that they would arrange it as soon as possible. I just don’t know why they suddenly changed their minds ...”

“There’s such a thing?” Liu haojun was suspicious.

Guo Zhiguang suddenly thought of something and quickly said,””Oh right, paradise Corporation also called us a little earlier to ask about the people who will be participating in this meeting. Then, not long after, their attitude took a 180 – degree turn ... I’m also puzzled!”

“I know!” Liu haojun said with a dark face. Since they’re not in a hurry, we shouldn’t rush them either! I’d like to see how crazy this company can be!”

“Okay, Secretary Liu ...” Guo Zhiguang quickly said.

Liu haojun hung up the phone with a heavy thud. His face was very ugly.

Since ancient times, people did not fight with officials. Liu haojun felt that the Paradise company would definitely not dare to go against them. No matter what the reason was for the Paradise company’s ambiguous attitude, they must not get used to this bad habit!

Liu haojun even thought that he should find an opportunity to teach this company a lesson when necessary! Even if the peach blossom company’s headquarters moved away, didn’t they still have so many businesses in Changping County?

However, before Liu haojun could put his thoughts into practice, a piece of news sent him and Guo Zhiguang into a state of confusion after only half a day.
