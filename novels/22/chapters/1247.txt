Guo Hongjiang, Zheng jianian, and the others couldn’t help but laugh.

“I think Xia Sheng’s medical skills are top – notch. If there’s any health problem during the race, he’ll definitely be able to solve it easily!” MA Xiong said with a serious expression.

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”Old Mr. MA, you’re flattering me. I’m not that amazing. I just know a little art from my ancestors.”

“Don’t be so humble, Xia Sheng,”MA Xiong insisted. Director Guo, boss Zheng, you guys might not know yet, right? Last time, I had a serious cerebral hemorrhage, and even our Hengfeng hospital’s Dr. Qin announced that there was no point in resuscitating me. It was Xia Sheng who pulled me back from the brink of death, and there were no sequelae!”

Guo Hongjiang and the others immediately widened their eyes.

They had all heard about MA Xiong’s serious illness, but MA Xiong’s health was related to Hengfeng’s stock price, so some detailed information couldn’t be obtained by outsiders.

Therefore, it was the first time that Guo Hongjiang and the others had heard of this detail.

The way they looked at Xia ruofei had changed.

These super – rich people would have more than enough money to spend in a few lifetimes. The Paradise Corporation had top – grade abalone, truffles, and wild ginseng that was hundreds of years old. Perhaps they would value Xia ruofei more and would look up to him. They would actively seek cooperation, but there was a limit to their value. After all, they were no longer so desperate for money.

However, with Xia ruofei’s amazing medical skills, it was a completely different story.

The richer a person was, the more afraid they were of death. Moreover, everyone was the same when it came to diseases. Didn’t you say that you could escape Death’s Scythe just because you had a net worth of hundreds of millions? even a legendary figure like gang leader Qiao couldn’t compare to pancreatic cancer, right?

Therefore, in the eyes of these rich people, a doctor with excellent medical skills was far more worth befriending than the boss of a company with endless potential.

Xia ruofei did not expect MA Xiong to bring up such a story from the horse racing incident. He could not help but smile bitterly.

MA Xiong observed his expression and immediately smiled.”Xia Sheng, director Guo and the others are my old friends. They won’t tell anyone about your medical skills, so don’t worry!”

After he finished speaking, MA Xiong turned to Guo Hongjiang and the rest and said,””Director Guo, boss Zheng, Xia Sheng is a person who doesn’t like trouble, so he didn’t let me tell you about his medical skills. It’s better for you to know this yourself, but don’t spread it.”

Guo Hongjiang understood tacitly and quickly said,””I understand, I understand! Chairman MA, Mr. Xia, don’t worry! We know the severity of this ...”

Zheng Yinian also expressed his opinion without hesitation.””This matter is only known to the few of us. It will definitely not be spread.”

Elder Zheng had lived for 60 to 70 years and was even more aware of the stakes involved.

Guo Hongjiang’s attitude towards Xia ruofei became even more enthusiastic.””Mr. Xia, is there anything else you’ve come to Hong Kong for besides the auction? I still have some face in Hong Kong, if you need my help, don’t be shy. ”

Xia ruofei smiled.”This time, it’s mainly about the auction. It’s been successfully completed. If there’s nothing else, I’ll be returning to the mainland in two days.”

“It’s rare to come here, so there’s no hurry to go back!” Guo Hongjiang quickly said,”Hong Kong still has many places worth visiting! Also ... If Mr. Xia is interested, I can take you to the race track. You won’t see such a lively place in the mainland. ”

Xia ruofei nodded.”I’ll thank you first, director Guo. I don’t have anything urgent to rush back to. I’ll follow old Mr. Ma’s instructions in Hong Kong.”

“Chairman MA, Mr. Xia is finally here in Hong Kong. You have to give me a chance to be the host!” Guo Hongjiang said to MA Xiong.

“I’ll definitely give you face since you’ve asked for it yourself, Chairman Guo!”MA Xiong laughed. Don’t worry! Even if you didn’t say so, I would have asked Xia Sheng to stay for a few more days. He’s my Savior!”

Guo Hongjiang was overjoyed, and the Zheng family’s young master quickly extended an invitation to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei naturally responded very politely. Anyway, he had come to Hong Kong and Island to listen to MA Xiong’s arrangements. It didn’t matter whether he returned to the mainland a few days earlier or later. There was nothing particularly urgent during this period of time. The Cordyceps in the medium was also in the harvesting process, so Xia Qing couldn’t finish it in a short time. The top – grade abalone and truffles couldn’t be put up for auction right away. The company’s operations were quite smooth, and it didn’t matter if he was still the boss.

Guo Hongjiang and Zheng jianian were definitely not the only guests invited by MA Xiong. Hence, after exchanging pleasantries for a while, MA Xiong introduced Xia ruofei to other friends.

However, he did not promote Xia ruofei’s medical skills anymore. He must have a special relationship with Guo and Zheng.

MA Xiong pulled Xia ruofei to the side and whispered,””Xiasheng, I told elder Guo and elder Zheng about your medical skills without discussing it with you. Please don’t take it to heart ...”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Old Mr. MA is definitely doing this for my own good. Why would I take offense?”

Xia ruofei understood immediately that MA Xiong was doing this to build his own network.

His company had impeccable products and huge potential. The only thing lacking was that its Foundation was too weak and its Foundation was not deep. This needed time to slowly accumulate.
