Xia ruofei pouted and said,””I really regret not recording your pathetic state back then! Others might not know, but I do! Why are you acting in front of me?”

“I don’t like what you just said!” Song Rui said,”I told you. It’s called strategy ... Strategy, understand?”

“Screw you!” Xia ruofei laughed and scolded,”you’re a little too arrogant! Don’t you know your own worth?”

“You won’t have any friends if you keep talking like that ...” Song Rui said gloomily.

“You’re the one who didn’t understand the situation!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I guess you didn’t ask Zhuo Yiyi why she suddenly accepted you, right?”

“What other reason could there be?” Song Rui grinned and said,”of course, he was charmed by my personal charm! Of course, she was also moved by my meticulous care!”

“Oh my ...” Xia ruofei said,”without my help, would you have done this?” Last time at my house, you had too much to drink. I’ve done a lot of thinking for you!”

“What?” Song Rui couldn’t help but be confused. He was stunned for a while before he asked,”you ... You’re helping me persuade Yiyi? How come I didn’t know about it?”

“Brother is a living Lei Feng! Do good deeds without leaving your name!” Xia ruofei said unhappily,”if you weren’t so arrogant today, I wouldn’t even have bothered to say anything ...” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Song Rui knew that Xia ruofei was probably telling the truth. The change in Zhuo Yiyi’s attitude towards him seemed to have happened after the gathering at Xia ruofei’s courtyard house. He had thought that it was because of her sincerity that could break through metal and stone! Now that he thought about it, it made sense.

Song Rui laughed dryly and said,”it’s a misunderstanding!” It was a misunderstanding! I really don’t know about this. I’ll ask later ...”

“Don’t be so silly as to really ask Zhuo Yiyi!” Xia ruofei quickly said,”girls are thin – skinned, be careful of her embarrassment turning into anger! You two are together anyway, so why bother with these things?”

“That makes sense! That makes sense!” Song Rui quickly said,”thank you, ruofei!”

“We’re all brothers, don’t say that ...” Xia ruofei saw that song Rui was thanking him so seriously that he was too embarrassed to continue teasing him.”Alright, I’ll hang up now. Gather the rest of us. Also, if Zhuo Yiyi is free, ask her to come over too!”

“Alright!” Song Rui said,”see you tonight!”

“See you tonight!”

After hanging up, Xia ruofei called Qin Yanan first. She and he Yu were still on their way to the hotel. Xia ruofei told her to finish her work early and go home for dinner. Anyway, there was still one day left tomorrow. Most of the issues that needed to be communicated had already been settled by Xia ruofei and Gao Jun. Qin Yanan was only responsible for the routine correspondence of the procedures.

Then, Xia ruofei found Song Wei’s number. He hesitated for a while but still dialed it.

After a few rings, he heard a voice message,”on a call.” He was stunned.

Don’t tell me he won’t even pick up the phone? Even if he wanted to avoid suspicion, there was no need to be so ruthless, right? He could not help but smile bitterly.

If that was the case, then he had two girlfriends in name, but in reality, he was not even as good as a single dog. As long as Song Wei and Ling Qingxue weren’t together, he wouldn’t be able to see any of them!

It seemed that he had a long way to go! Xia ruofei said in his heart.

Just as he was letting his thoughts run wild, his phone rang.

Xia ruofei picked it up and saw that it was from Song Wei. He quickly picked it up.

“RUO Fei, I’m sorry! “I was in the library just now, so ...” Song Wei said shyly.

Xia ruofei was relieved. He had misunderstood. At least the situation was not as bad as he had thought.

He laughed and said,”it’s fine!” It’s fine! By the way, why are you still in the library at this hour? Have you had lunch?”

“I finished eating and came over.” Song Wei could feel Xia ruofei’s concern for her. She smiled and said,”I’m going to finish the previous topic. I’m going to the library to find some information.”

“But you still have to rest!” Xia ruofei said,”if I don’t sleep in the afternoon, I’ll break down in the afternoon!”

“You’re exaggerating!”Song Wei chuckled. So what if he didn’t have a lunch break for one or two days? Not to mention that I’m a cultivator! How could he be that weak?”

“I’m just concerned about you,”Xia ruofei chuckled.

“You’re so talkative!” “You’re in the capital?” Song Wei asked shyly.

She knew that Xia ruofei was going back to the capital today, so she had returned to school two days earlier. Now that Xia ruofei had called her, she could guess that he had already arrived in the capital.

“En!” Xia ruofei said,”well ... I just settled down and called you to invite you over for dinner!”

Song Wei’s heart was filled with sweetness, but she still said,””I have something on tonight! We’ll talk about it later ...”

“You didn’t mention anything about not meeting Qingxue alone in your agreement, did you?” Xia ruofei could not help but ask.

“That’s not the reason!” Song Wei quickly said,”don’t think too much! I really have something to do!”

Actually, no matter how busy Song Wei was, she would still have time to have a meal with Xia ruofei. She did have some concerns and did not want Ling Qingxue to misunderstand.

Xia ruofei was well aware of this, but he could only smile bitterly in his heart. He said unwillingly,”Weiwei, big brother Zhao, song Rui, and the others will be coming over tonight. Oh, and your classmate, Zhuo Yiyi, too. Are you ... Really not free?
