Chen shun saw that the driver didn’t move and couldn’t help but say anxiously,””Hurry up and drive! I have something urgent to attend to ...”

“Sir, you ... Why don’t you change to another car?” The taxi driver said hesitantly,”Taoyuan farm is too remote. I don’t usually go out of the city at night ...”

“You want to refuse?” Chen shun glared at the driver.”I’ll file a complaint against you!”

Chen shun’s impolite attitude also made the taxi driver a little angry. Moreover, this was a busy street, so the driver was not afraid of Chen shun. He turned off the engine and leaned back in the seat, saying, “I’m sorry, the car suddenly broke down, so I can’t leave even if I wanted to! If you want to file a complaint, go ahead! Don’t forget to record the car number!”

“You!” Chen shun was already in a bad mood, and after hearing the driver’s words, he wanted to fight him even more.

However, he was in a hurry at the moment and didn’t have the mood to create more trouble. He could only glare at the driver and said,””I’ll definitely file a complaint against you!”

With that, he opened the door and got out of the car, then slammed the door shut.

The driver started the engine again and said,””Go complain if you want! Who knows if you’re a robber or not! Taking a taxi to the wilderness in the middle of the night!”

With that, he stepped on the gas and the car drove away.

Chen shun was stomping his feet in anger. This was truly a case of a leaking House meeting a rainy night, and a ship meeting a headwind again! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Previously, Chen shun had run so fast that the purchasing Commissioner could not catch up with him. He only ran out of the alley now.

When Chen shun saw him, he said,”what are you waiting for?” Hurry up and stop a car! Remember to pay up first!”

He didn’t want to be misunderstood as a car Bandit again.

Finally, they managed to hail a taxi. Chen shun and the purchasing Commissioner got in the car and hurried to Taoyuan farm.

......

On the farm, Xia ruofei, Tang weiran, and the others had drunk just right. They were a little tipsy, but not too much.

Tang weiran was in a good mood. After dinner, she wanted to visit the farm.

Actually, it was late at night and it was winter. Xia ruofei really couldn’t figure out what was there to see. However, for the sake of the one hundred million Yuan order, Xia ruofei agreed.

He asked ye Lingyun to find an electric patrol car. In addition to the driver, there were two rows of seats facing each other at the back, which could seat six people if squeezed.

Xia ruofei and Lin Zhongming were sitting opposite Tang weiran and Zheng Xu. As for Feng Jing, she was a girl. Xia ruofei didn’t want her to be exposed to the wind, so he asked her to go back and rest.

Xia ruofei asked the veteran to drive around the farm and try to turn to places other than the orchard. Along the way, he gave a brief introduction to the situation on his farm.

The car wasn’t going very fast and he was still wrapped in a coat. Moreover, his body was hot after drinking, so Tang weiran didn’t curl up into a ball. He listened to Xia ruofei’s explanation with great interest and even praised her from time to time.

Of course, it was mostly flattery. In such a short time, and in the middle of the night, how could she really see anything different?

The electric car drove along the extended greenhouse and cold storage, which was basically the route that the Veterans usually patrolled.

After going around this area, he would be near the gate of the farm. Next, he would enter the area where the first phase of the farm had been built. It also included neat vegetable greenhouses, Pomfret breeding workshop, Tea Studio, Tiandi fengdou production studio, and employee apartments.

However, when the car arrived at the gate, everyone saw two bright car lights. They could vaguely see a small car parked outside the cordon at the gate.

Who would be here in the middle of the night? Xia ruofei muttered in his heart.

The veteran who was on duty at the entrance today quickly walked over and said,””Chairman, two people who claimed to be Tongren Hall’s staff just came to the door and said they want to see you!”
