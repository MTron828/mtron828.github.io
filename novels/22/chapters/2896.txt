2897 The great Savior_

After Davis laughed, his gaze slowly fell on Charlie, and he slowly said, “Charlie, you know what? Just because I was born a few years later than you, all the glory was concentrated on you. Since young, you were raised as the successor of the family, while I was like a pet in captivity! God ... That feeling was terrible! I swear you’ve never experienced it before. It’s a good thing that I’ve been waiting for this day. Do you know how it feels? ”

As Davis spoke, he walked up to Charlie and loaded the large-caliber pistol in his hand.

Even at this time, Davis was still extremely cautious. He always kept a safe distance from Charlie.

Davis slowly raised his gun and aimed it at Charlie’s forehead. Then, with a cruel smile on his face, he said, “Charlie, what I feel now is ... The sky is finally bright!”

Davis looked up at the dark sky as if he was looking at a bright future. He said, ” “Charlie, my brother! Let’s bid farewell ...”

Charlie slowly closed his eyes. He no longer had any hope of getting lucky. He knew that his head would be shot into a pulp like a watermelon in the next moment. At such a close distance, he might not even be able to hear the sound of the gunshot before he was hit. Then, his consciousness would fall into eternal darkness.

At this moment, Charlie was filled with the fear of death and the unwillingness to accept his fate.

As a formidable person with hundreds of billions of assets, what kind of enjoyment could he not get? He didn’t expect that his life would end in such a tragic way when he was only in his forties ...

At this moment, a chuckle was heard.

The laughter wasn’t loud, but it seemed to ring in everyone’s ears. It was extremely clear.

Davis’s expression was ugly as he turned around and shouted,””Who is it? Who’s laughing?”

Davis had just been brewing his emotions, enjoying the most carefree moment of his life, so who was it that would spoil the mood and laugh? Are my words so laughable?

Davis’s confidants looked at each other in dismay. They also heard laughter, but it didn’t come from any of them.

Other than the few of them, there were only Davis and Charlie on the deck. Charlie had already closed his eyes to welcome the arrival of death, while Davis was venting all the grievances he had suffered for the past twenty to thirty years. Naturally, they couldn’t laugh like this.

Who else could it be?

Everyone suddenly recalled that just half an hour ago, they had killed dozens of yacht staff on this deck and threw their bodies into the sea. Could it be ... Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Thinking of this, everyone couldn’t help but shiver, and a trace of fear flashed in their eyes.

If they were on land, they wouldn’t have suddenly made such an Association. After all, even if the probability was very low, there was still the possibility of uninvited guests. But this was the vast sea! Moreover, it was a remote Sea area far away from the traditional sea route. Other than a few people on duty in the cockpit, all the living people were here.

The cockpit was more than a hundred meters away from the second floor of the deck, so the sound from there would not reach them no matter what. Even if it did, how would his subordinates have the guts to laugh at Davis?

Davis also noticed the strange expressions on his confidants “faces. Clearly, they hadn’t opened their mouths just now. Davis couldn’t help but be startled. Who was the one who laughed just now? Was he hearing things?

“Did you guys hear that?” Davis asked.

“Boss, are you talking about laughter?” One of the burly men quickly said,”we heard it too, but this isn’t ...”

“I know!” Davis said impatiently.

Although Davis didn’t believe in ghosts and gods, he couldn’t help but feel a little scared. After all, this place was like a Shuraba. The desperate wails of the staff before their deaths echoed in his ears. Now, strange laughter came from the vast sea. It was really too strange ...

Charlie had also opened his eyes. A gurgling sound came from his throat as he revealed a terrifying smile and said,”Davis, I heard that laughter too. It must be the vengeful souls of hessilin and the others ...”

Hathaway was one of the two new Hollywood stars who had gone out to sea with Charlie this time. The two new actors had thought that their future would be very smooth since they had managed to get close to Charlie, the head of the cohe family. Even though they knew that they were only Charlie’s playthings, a Big Shot like Charlie would be able to live a life of luxury and wealth if they could even get a little bit of it out of his fingertips.

The two young actresses would never have dreamed that on this super – Luxury yacht supported by a Mobile Palace on the sea, there was actually a fatal killing intent brewing. Their dream of becoming stars had just begun, but it had already been destroyed.

It was not hard to imagine how unwilling these two actresses were before they died.

“You shut up!” Davis shouted madly,”I’m not afraid even if they’re alive. They’re just a bunch of ants! Now that they’re all dead, why would I be afraid of them?”

“But your face is already filled with fear!” Charlie said immediately.

He didn’t have any hope of survival, so he was going all out, not afraid of angering Davis.

The veins on Davis’s face bulged. He suddenly raised his gun and pointed it at Charlie. He gritted his teeth and said,””Then I’ll let you see God first ... No! It was to see Satan! Go and be with your hessilin!”

With that, Davis pulled the trigger madly, and Charlie had already anticipated this. His whole body trembled, and he closed his eyes to welcome the arrival of death.

However, after waiting for a few seconds, Charlie did not hear any gunshots, nor did he feel any pain.

Could it be that I’m already dead before I can even feel it? This thought emerged in Charlie’s mind.

However, he did not have the legendary near – Death experience. He did not feel light all over, nor did he feel the Holy Light that was like heaven. He could even feel the sea breeze blowing on his body.

Charlie tried to open his eyes, and he immediately saw a strange scene. Davis was pulling the trigger with a ferocious expression, but the trigger seemed to be cast in iron. No matter how much force he used, it wouldn’t move.

At this moment, Charlie had even forgotten the fear of death. He looked curiously at Davis, who was like a gust of wind, and wondered what kind of game he was playing. Was the trigger of that pistol that heavy?

Davis was on the verge of a mental breakdown. He didn’t know why the gun seemed to be stuck, and he couldn’t buckle it at all.

What was even more terrifying was that when he wanted to throw the gun away and change it, he found that the gun seemed to be stuck to his hand with superglue, and he couldn’t shake it off no matter how hard he tried.

Could it really be a ghost coming to claim his life? A thought came to Davis’s mind as goosebumps rose all over his body. Being blown by the sea breeze, he shivered all at once.

Xia ruofei was the one who had led the way.

Actually, when Xia ruofei found the yacht, Davis’s men had already finished the massacre and were throwing the bodies into the sea. This scene caught Xia ruofei’s attention.

While he was flying on his sword towards the Super – Luxury yacht, he had heard the conversation between Charlie and Davis. This conversation gave Xia ruofei a general understanding of the whole situation.

So this was a feud between brothers in a wealthy family!

Xia ruofei didn’t know much about Charlie and Davis, so he couldn’t be sure who he was leaning towards. However, in his heart, he naturally would not acknowledge Davis. After all, Charlie had not treated Davis unfairly. The Coch family had always been like this, focusing on nurturing a successor so that the other members of the same generation would not have to worry about food and clothing, and could live an extravagant life. And Davis wanted Charlie’s life, that was his brother! It could be seen that this person’s mentality had been completely distorted.

Besides, Davis had killed dozens of innocent people. Such a brutal act would naturally arouse Xia ruofei’s disgust.
