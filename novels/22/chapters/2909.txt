2910 Who can’t be tolerated_

Madel, who had dealt with Zhang Chao a few times, looked up at him and said,””Mr. Zhang, today our respected Mr. Irade has come to talk to you in person. I hope you can give us a satisfactory answer.”

Sanchez, the female Deputy Mayor of quachaquarkos, also said with a reserved expression,””Mr. Zhang, the harbor Group under Mr. ERAD’s name is an important investor in our kuachakuros city. I hope that this meeting can reach a satisfactory result for both sides. Of course, this is only my personal wish and does not represent the city government of kuachakurakos. ”

The so – called Harbor Group was just a shell, and the mastermind behind it was the notorious drug lord gang, the Bay group. This port group was in charge of some of the Bay Group’s business in the state of vilacru, and the nominal boss was ERAD.

This was something that almost everyone in Mexico knew, but Sanchez, as the Deputy Mayor of quachaquarkos, could still say those words with a serious face, as if the harbor Group was a clean company.

The state Councilor of the state of veracris, Fernando, who came with him, just glanced at Zhang Chao indifferently without saying anything, but the pressure he gave Zhang Chao was not small at all.

When Zhang Chao saw the other party’s formation, he knew that they were determined to win today.

He couldn’t help but complain in his heart. The Chinese were already a vulnerable group in Mexico, especially when the opponent this time was one of the largest drug lord gangs in Mexico. It seemed that it would be difficult to keep the foundation of Huafeng shipping today ...

Zhang Chao squeezed out a smile and went up to him.””Everyone, please go to the reception room! Let’s sit down and talk!”

At this time, ERAD, who had not said a word since he got out of the car, finally opened his mouth. He narrowed his eyes and stared at Zhang Chao, saying,””Chinese, I heard that you’re not willing to transfer this warehouse?”

Zhang Chao forced a smile and said,”Mr. ERAD, it’s not that we don’t want to sell it. It’s just that the price you gave is too low. It’s far lower than the market price. If we sell it at this price, our many years of Foundation will be equivalent to being lost ...”

ERAD’s brows furrowed slightly, and he tilted his head and asked,””Madeline, how much did you offer them?”

Madel quickly smiled and said,”Mr. ERAD, we bid 500000 US dollars. In fact, this price is already very high. The land at the port is not worth much, and their warehouse is very old. It’s about this price. These damn Chinese people are too greedy!”

When Zhang Chao heard this, his lungs were about to explode. Madeline was completely lying with his eyes open. Just the shipping company building and the land alone were worth more than 500000 US dollars. The warehouse behind covered a vast area. Even without the value of the building, the value of the land alone was almost five million US dollars.

If Huafeng shipping’s industries were sold at a price of five million US dollars, buyers would definitely rush to the door to trade.

What’s more, Huafeng shipping didn’t want to sell it at all. It was Madeline who took a fancy to this land and wanted to use it as a transit and storage base for drug trade. That was why he used his power to oppress people. It was obvious that he wanted to force the purchase.

“Medel, 500000 dollars is indeed a little inappropriate ...” ERAD said after a moment of silence.

When Zhang Chao heard this, he couldn’t help but feel a little surprised. Could it be that this drug lord leader still had a little conscience? Or did he think that the price was so low that even he could not bear to look at it?

In any case, Zhang Chao was more or less relieved to hear this.

However, what ERAD said next made Zhang Chao’s heart fall to the bottom again. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The corners of ERAD’s mouth twitched slightly, and he said,””This price is really too high! Madel, as the person in charge of the kuachakuros branch, you must be careful when you spend every penny. You can’t squander it at will! Don’t you understand this logic? You actually want to buy such a broken place for five hundred thousand dollars? Is it because the company has too much money and has nowhere to spend it?”

“It’s my fault, Mr. ERAD!”Madel quickly lowered his head and said. I also want to complete the transaction as soon as possible and hope that these Chinese people will agree to this deal as soon as possible by giving them a certain amount of interest. I just didn’t expect these people to be insatiable and want more money ...”

Zhang Chao was so angry that he almost couldn’t control himself and started cursing.

Could he be more shameless than this? This was a complete lie!

However, in the end, reason still triumphed over impulse. Zhang Chao knew that once he fell out with ERAD, he would definitely be the one to suffer in the end. At that time, not only would he not be able to protect the shipping company, but even the personal safety of his people would not be guaranteed.

Although the Hong sect’s branch in Mexico had a certain level of combat power, how could they compare to the drug lord group that was armed to the teeth?

It was no exaggeration to say that once he had a falling out with these people, the entire Huafeng shipping company might be massacred tonight, becoming one of the tens of thousands of murders in Mexico every year.

There were countless murders and firefights in Mexico, and people died every day, but only a few cases could be solved.
