Chapter 402: I’m still a child (2)

“Didn’t you just say that it’s fine?”Xia ruofei asked in surprise.

Wasn’t this girl’s change of stance a little too fast?

Lu You said anxiously,”I just suddenly don’t want to go in!” Why are you so motherf * cking? Please help me take it out! Just bring it to the entrance of the farm. ”

Lu You’s words had a hint of coquettishness in them, and she seemed to be a little nervous.

Xia ruofei didn’t think too much about it. He smiled and said,””Alright, alright, alright, I’ll do my best! How long will it take you to get there?”

“You can come out now! I’ll be there in five minutes at most. ” Lu You said.

Then, she added,””My mom said that we’ll take five portions in total!”

Xia ruofei almost laughed out loud. He had never told Tian Huilan a clear number, and he believed that Tian Huilan would not take the initiative to ask for a few portions. This was clearly Lu You ‘s’ fake imperial edict ‘.

However, he was too lazy to expose her now. He laughed and said,””I know.”

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei went back to the villa and found a paper bag. Then, he took out the jaded skin ointment from the spirit map space and put it in the paper bag.

He came to the courtyard and said to Madam song,””Madam song, I’m so sorry! My friend has something to discuss with me. Please take a seat, I’ll be back at the entrance of the farm. ”

“Go ahead, ruofei!” Madam song nodded kindly. We’re here to talk to uncle Li, you don’t have to worry about us!”

When Xia ruofei walked to the gate of the farm with his bag, Lu You arrived in her BMW MINI.

She turned her head in the spacious open space at the entrance, parked the car, and then stepped out.

Lu You looked around the farm nervously and then walked toward Xia ruofei.

“Did you bring your things?” Lu You looked at the paper bag in Xia ruofei’s hand and asked.

Xia ruofei chuckled and nodded. He handed the paper bag to Lu You and said,””It’s all inside!”

“Thanks!” Lu You took the paper bag and said something in a hurry. Then, she turned around and walked toward the car, as if she was in a hurry to leave this place.

Xia ruofei laughed behind Lu You and said,””By the way, miss Lu, when Secretary Tian called me, he didn’t say how many portions of Jade skin cream he wanted ...”

Lu You stopped in her tracks. She turned around and said without changing her expression,””Oh, really? But when my mom told me, she told me to bring five back!”

“Oh! That’s fine too. ” Xia ruofei said with a half – Smile,”I originally prepared eight portions for Secretary Tian. Since she only wants five portions, I can save some ...”

Xia ruofei was not spouting nonsense. This time, he had made more than 30 sets of jaded skin ointment at once. Considering that Tian Huilan would mail two or three sets to Tian Huixin, then keep two or three sets for himself, and then leave two or three sets as a gift at a suitable time, he calculated that eight sets were more suitable.

Lu You’s eyes widened when she heard that. She quickly said,””Ah? What did you just say?”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”it’s nothing. You should go back.” Be careful on the road, I have guests at my villa, so I won’t keep you ...” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Wait, wait, wait ...” Lu You called out.”A man keeps his word. You said you would give me eight portions, so you should give me eight portions ...”

“But you only want five!” Xia ruofei put on an innocent look and said,”I will definitely follow Secretary Tian’s instructions strictly!”

With that, Xia ruofei actually turned around and walked into the farm.

“Wait!” Lu You shouted anxiously from behind,”hey, wait ...”

Xia ruofei’s back was facing Lu You. He couldn’t help but burst out laughing.

However, he was also a little puzzled. With Lu You’s personality, she should have caught up to him by now. However, although Lu You was shouting anxiously, she actually stood still on the spot and did not move.

After Xia ruofei took a few steps, he confirmed that Lu You would not chase after him. He did not want to tease her anymore. He stood still and turned around.”Miss Lu, the jaded skin ointment I gave to Secretary Tian is all in that paper bag. Take a look and see if the number is correct!”

With that, Xia ruofei smirked at Lu You and strode into the farm without stopping.

When Lu You heard Xia ruofei’s last sentence, which seemed to have made no sense, she also felt that something was wrong. She quickly opened the paper bag and counted.

1、2、3……8!

There were a total of eight porcelain bottles, not a single one more or less.

Lu You bit her lower lip lightly and looked at Xia ruofei’s back view that was getting further and further away. She stomped her feet in anger and shouted,””Xia ruofei, you bastard! You’re playing with me again ...”

After saying that, Lu You felt a little embarrassed. She could not help but burst out laughing with a red face. She had always had a cold and elegant image. After she revealed a smile, she appeared particularly moving. Even Hong Tao, who was on guard at the door, could not help but be a little dazed.

Lu You glanced at the farm nervously. Then, she quickly got into the car with the paper bag and drove away quickly.

Xia ruofei returned to the villa and chatted with li Zhifu and the others in the yard. Then, he asked Mrs. Song and song Rui to stay for dinner.

Mrs. Song agreed after a few polite words. As for song Rui, who had been drooling over Taoyuan vegetables for a long time, he didn’t even try to be polite. Instead, he smiled and brought out a bunch of dishes he wanted to eat.

He did not treat himself as an outsider.
