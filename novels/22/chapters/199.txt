Chapter 200: Chapter 196 – deep affection (1)

Xia ruofei hugged Ling Qingxue from behind and said with a smile,””Alright, I’ll listen to you! I won’t sell these blood red Dragons no matter how much you pay me. I’ll just raise them well! This is the proof of our love!” “En!” Ling Qingxue nodded her head in happiness. “But ... I still have to prepare a gift for your father.” Xia ruofei replied,”after a while! Give me some time to prepare. I’ll definitely give your father a surprise!” “It’s actually fine ... My dad doesn’t lack anything now ...” Ling Qingxue said softly. “Oh, really? He doesn’t even lack top quality blood red Dragons?” Xia ruofei asked with a faint smile. “That’s not the same,” Ling Qingxue said without hesitation.”As long as it’s a good Arowana, he won’t feel it’s too much no matter how much we give him ... But ... Didn’t we agree to keep the blood Dragons for ourselves?” Ling Qingxue suddenly stopped and looked at Xia ruofei in surprise.””Don’t tell me you can find such a perfect red Arowana!” Xia ruofei smiled mysteriously and said,”it’s not impossible!” But I’m afraid it’ll be a little difficult to find a pair as big as this one, but there’s still hope of finding a smaller one. Besides, other than being shorter than this pair, the quality won’t lose to them!” “Really?” Ling Qingxue asked, pleasantly surprised. “Would I Lie to You?” Xia ruofei chuckled.”But you have to give me some time ...” “That’s for sure! Although I don’t know much about Arowana, my dad talks to me every day, so I know a little about it. “I know that this kind of top – grade Arowana is hard to come by ...” Ling Qingxue said with a nod. “In any case, you can rest assured!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”when I find him, I’ll pay your father a formal visit. I’ll definitely give him a good gift for our first meeting!” “En!” Ling Qingxue said as she nodded happily. Xia ruofei already had a plan in mind, so he did not mention the gift anymore. Hu ‘Zi’s mother and the others had also deliberately left some space for the two of them. They had gone out to buy groceries and had not returned. After Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue were intimate with each other in the house for a while, they decided to go to the beach together. The two of them still remembered the last time they went to the beach. That was the first time Xia ruofei talked to someone about the past in the Army, and it was also the first time their hearts were so close. That beach had become a beautiful memory for them. Holding hands, they walked to the courtyard. Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Wait a minute! Drive my car to ...” With that, Xia ruofei jogged into the house and entered the garage from the inside of the villa. The sound of an engine revving could be heard, and the garage’s electric door slowly opened. The pure black Knight XV let out a low roar and slowly drove out of the garage, stopping beside Ling Qingxue. The Porsche 911 that Ling Qingxue drove next to the Knight XV looked like a petite woman standing next to a super muscular man. It was the first time Ling Qingxue had seen Xia ruofei’s car. Her beautiful eyes were filled with surprise, and her cherry – like mouth was slightly agape. She did not expect Xia ruofei to have changed to such a domineering armored SUV. It was only when Xia ruofei poked his head out and called her to get in the car that she snapped back to her senses. She quickly walked to the passenger seat, opened the door, and climbed into the car. Ling Qingxue had been sizing Xia ruofei up ever since she got into the car. It was as if she was meeting him for the first time. “Ruofei, this is an off – Road vehicle worth tens of millions!” “When did you become so rich?” Ling Qingxue asked. “I can’t afford this car! This is a gift from someone else. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”but strictly speaking, I didn’t take it for free ... I did help him a little.” “You’re giving me such an expensive car just because I did you a small favor?” Ling Qingxue was even more surprised.”Who could be so rich?” Xia ruofei did not want to hide it from Ling Qingxue. Since the two of them were together, as long as it did not involve the core secrets of the spirit map space, there was no need to hide things like MA Xiong’s car. “You’ve heard of Hong Kong tycoon MA Xiong, right?”Xia ruofei smiled. “Hong Kong’s King of jewelry? MA Xiong from Hengfeng group?” Ling Qingxue took a deep breath and said,”you actually know the Super – rich MA Xiong? And you even helped him?” It wasn’t that Ling Qingxue didn’t believe Xia ruofei. It was just that the news was too shocking. It made her feel unreal for a moment. “It’s just a coincidence. I’ll tell you in detail in the future. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”anyway, you just need to know that although your boyfriend is very good at making money, I’m not good enough to buy a ten – million – Yuan off – Road vehicle in such a short time ...” “Then I’m relieved.” Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”I thought you went to rob a bank!” Her attention quickly shifted to the interior of the car and the equipment. “There aren’t many cars like this in China!” Ling Qingxue said,”and your car seems to have been modified! I’ve seen the Knight XV at a luxury car show, and the interior is quite different from yours. ” “Yes, old Mr. MA spent a lot of money on the modification. He was planning to keep it for himself, but he gave it to me later.” Xia ruofei said and continued to ask,”Qingxue, do you like this car? Why don’t you drive it back? I basically don’t need them, and I put them in the garage most of the time!” “I don’t want to!” Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei in amusement and said,”what girl drives such a domineering car? I think I’ll just drive my 911 ...” Xia ruofei laughed.”That’s true. My Qingxue is a cute girl. But when she drives this car, she immediately becomes a tough girl.” “You’re so annoying!” Ling Qingxue rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and said. The car soon arrived at the seaside. The two of them got out of the car and strolled on the beach hand in hand. It was almost evening, and their shadows were long under the setting sun, forming a beautiful silhouette ... It was still the same rock. The two of them snuggled up to each other and looked at the endless sea in front of them. The sound of the waves hitting the shore rang in their ears. They quietly felt the flow of time as if they were the only two people left in the world. Xia ruofei could not help but lower his head and kiss Ling Qingxue’s Red lips ... It was not until the sky turned dark that the two of them drove back to the villa. Hu Zi’s mother and the rest had already returned. Xia ruofei then introduced Ling Qingxue to ye Lingyun. Ling Qingxue greeted ye Lingyun graciously and then took Lin Qiao’s hand to sit on the sofa in the living room and whisper to her. Ye Lingyun was naturally happy for Xia ruofei and even secretly gave him a thumbs up. Very quickly, Hu Zi’s mother prepared a sumptuous meal. The family sat around the table and had a happy dinner. During the meal, Hu Zi’s mother kept putting food into Ling Qingxue’s bowl. The more she looked at Ling Qingxue, the more she liked her. This was a joy that came from the bottom of her heart. After Hu Zi’s death, Xia ruofei had treated Hu Zi’s mother as his own and treated her like his own. Didn’t hu Zi’s mother also treat Xia ruofei like her own son? Now that her son had found such an outstanding girlfriend, as a mother, she was really overjoyed. After dinner, because Ling Qingxue still had to drive back to the city, she took her leave after sitting for a while. Xia ruofei walked her to the door and reminded her to drive carefully. He watched as the orange Porsche 911 disappeared from his sight before he returned to the villa with a smile.
