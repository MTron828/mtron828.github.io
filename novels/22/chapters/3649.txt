Tang Yitian laughed and said,&quot;I know you’ve been thinking about thisl&quot; I’ve already found out about the situation in advance. Of course, it’s all Steve. It was provided by Galini! This guy didn’t even hesitate to betray his own brother. You cultivators really have terrifying means. &quot;

Xia ruofei smiled.&quot;It’s very scary to the enemy. We’re on the same side. Why would you be afraid that 1’11 use this method against you, big brother Tang?&quot;

&quot;l’m not worried about that.&quot; Tang Yitian laughed.&quot;I know you very well, ruofei! &quot;

Then, Tang Yitian continued,&quot;let’s get back to the main topic.&quot; Kalini went out to sea yesterday, but you should be able to find him at any time with your flying boat. &quot;

&quot;Even if he’s hiding on the moon, I ll still be able to find him,&quot; said Xia ruofei, nodding.

He was not exaggerating at all. It had been proven that the black Phoenix flying ship was capable of short – distance space travel. At the very least, reaching the moon would not be a problem.

Xia ruofei continued,&q not; big brother Tang, Steve.&quot; Galini should know the general range of activities of Grello, right? Otherwise, it wouldn’t be easy to find him in the vast sea. &quot;

&quot; Grello. Kalini owns a super – Luxury yacht and often goes out to sea with a group of bad friends. Of course, there are also groups of beautiful women. &quot; Tang Yitian said,&quot;they usually don’t have a clear destination. The only thing we can be sure of is that the yacht will be in international waters, because it’s more convenient and safe for them to carry out some more exciting activities on the yacht.&quot; 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Xia ruofei raised her eyebrows and said,&qiiot;&quot;In that case, it won’t be easy to find him in the sea! But it didn’t matter. He couldn’t just keep wandering in the open sea! I’ll just wait a few more days in Sydney!&qnot;

&quot;If I couldn’t find him, 1 wouldn’t have said so much to you.&qnot; Tang Yitian laughed. Steve. Galini had always been worried about Grello. Of course, he did not doubt his loyalty, but he felt that he was brainless and easily caused trouble. So, in fact, Steve. Galini has always arranged spies around greello to report his situation at any time. &quot;

Xia ruofei’s eyes lit up and he said,&quot;so, as long as Steve …&quot; If Galini wants to know Grello’s location, then there’s definitely no problem?&quot;

Tang Yitian nodded with a smile. He took out a small device from the desk drawer and handed it to Xia ruofei.&quot;This is Steve’s name from two days ago. He asked me to pass this to you when we met. The spy he arranged had a satellite positioning system before going out to sea. You can easily find the yacht’s location through this equipment. &quot;

&quot;Alright!&quot; Xia ruofei said happily,&quot;that’s easy!&quot;

&quot;Ruofei, I know that Grello deserved to die. Even if he didn’t do those things to Paradise Farm and Xiao Liang, the sins he usually committed are more than enough to die a hundred times.&quot; Tang Yitian said,&quot;but I still hope that you don’t hurt the innocent. Although the other people on the yacht aren’t good people, after all …&quot;

&quot;What kind of person do you think I am, big brother Tang?&quot; Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand. A homicidal maniac? How could I possibly kill ordinary people? Don’t worry! The target of this operation is only greello alone. &quot;

&quot;I… i thought you were going to destroy the yacht !&quot; Tang Yitian laughed dryly. For example, directly sink the yacht and fake a sea disaster ….&quot;
