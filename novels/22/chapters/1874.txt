Chapter 1875: For a beauty in a fit of anger (1)

Translator: 549690339

Although Xia ruofei’s words were harsh and his tone was tough, Wu Liqian could not help but feel a trace of warmth in her heart. She knew very well that Xia ruofei’s anger was because of her.

Otherwise, from the peach blossom company’s perspective, there was no difference between her, the executive Deputy County Head, and Liu haojun, the deputy party secretary, who was in charge of this project. As long as the preferential policies were in place, it would be fine.

It was like going to a restaurant to eat, as long as the taste of the dishes was to their taste, it would be fine. As for whether the restaurant had changed chefs, the customers would not care!

However, Xia ruofei, the ‘customer’, not only did he care, but he also reacted strongly and used such harsh methods. There could only be one reason – he was fighting for justice for the ‘chef’, Wu Liqian.

At this moment, Wu Liqian thought of all the injustice she had suffered after Liu haojun took office. She suddenly had the urge to cry, but she forced back the tears that were about to burst out of her eyes and took a few deep breaths to calm herself down.

“Ruofei, listen to me ...” Wu Liqian tried her best to keep calm.”I’m very grateful that you’re fighting for me, but this matter concerns the development of Changping County. From your company’s point of view, it’s not good for you to have such a strained relationship with the local government ...”

Xia ruofei said nonchalantly,”sister Qian, I’ve said it before. Our company’s focus is not in Changping County. We only have one farm here. To be honest, as long as we have the core technology, I can open another farm like this anytime. It won’t cost much. So, your reason is not valid!”

“RUO Fei ...”

“Listen to me first!” Xia ruofei interrupted Wu Liqian in a domineering manner.”As for the development of Changping County, I’m sorry, but I’m not obliged to help it. I haven’t reached the level where I can help the world yet, not to mention that I can’t even protect my friends at my side, what face do I have to help the world?”

At this point, Xia ruofei said firmly,””So, don’t try to persuade me anymore. I know how to deal with this! Don’t think too highly of Liu haojun. He’s just a nobody in the capital’s circle! I’m not so weak that I can’t even win against such a good – for – nothing young master!”

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Wu Liqian was silent for a few seconds, then said softly,””Alright...Ruofei, thank you!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Sister Qian, you don’t have to be so polite with me. We’re friends!”

Wu Liqian’s tears almost burst out again. She bit her lower lip to hold back the urge to choke up. She smiled with tears in her eyes and said,””Mm! It’s so good to have a friend like you ...”

Hearing Wu Liqian’s weak voice, Xia ruofei’s heart suddenly moved.

He thought of the information Zhao Yongjun had given him about Liu haojun. The reason why Liu haojun had been “banished” far away from the capital in advance had caught Xia ruofei’s attention.

At that time, Liu haojun could no longer stay in Beijing due to his lifestyle, so his family arranged for him to be demoted in advance. More importantly, Liu haojun had taken advantage of his subordinates in his department and did not want to take responsibility for it, which was why the matter had become so serious.

Xia ruofei immediately thought of Wu Liqian, who was a standard beauty! Moreover, people in their early thirties were the most attractive. Needless to say, those of the same age would definitely be attracted to young and mature women like Wu Liqian who had very good looks. In the eyes of the young people in their teens and twenties, how could those girls of the same age be a match for a mature woman like Wu Liqian?

Therefore, Wu Liqian was at the stage of killing anyone of any age group. In addition, she was single, so it was hard to guarantee that Liu haojun wouldn’t have any other ideas.

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei asked,”sister Qian, other than jumping out to compete with you for political achievements, did Liu haojun do anything else?”

Wu Liqian hesitated for a moment. She was full of grievances and wanted to pour them out, but when she thought about how Xia ruofei was already so impulsive just because of the project snatching incident, if she told Xia ruofei what Liu haojun had done these days, wouldn’t Xia ruofei rush to the county party committee’s courtyard to teach Liu haojun a lesson?

Just as Wu Liqian was in a dilemma, Xia ruofei continued,””Sister Qian, don’t try to hide anything. I think if Liu haojun really did something, it wouldn’t be hard for me to find out ...”

“You ...” Wu Liqian was not used to Xia ruofei’s strong attitude, but she had to admit that he was right.

The fact that Liu haojun had been pestering her was no longer a secret in the political system of Changping County. It might have even spread throughout the entire political circle of the three mountains. With Xia ruofei’s connections in the three mountains, he could find out everything by simply asking someone.

So, as long as Xia ruofei was determined to investigate, there was no point in Wu Liqian hiding it.

Thinking of this, Wu Liqian sighed and said,””Since you want to hear it, I’ll tell you my grievances! I’ve been really suffocated these days ... But you have to promise me that you won’t be impulsive after hearing it, and you’re not allowed to use any extreme means, or else it’ll become unreasonable ...”
