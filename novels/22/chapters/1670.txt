Chapter 1671: God’s arrangement (1)

Brook’s nerves were still tense. He stared at the speedometer and saw that the plane’s speed was rapidly decreasing under the effect of the reverse push and brake. When the speed reached 70 knots, Brook shouted,”Xia, reverse the slow car!”

Originally, Brook was worried that the running track would be too short, so he was prepared to take a risk and push back later.

However, Xia ruofei’s landing this time, other than being a little heavier, was perfect. The landing gear touched the ground as soon as he entered the landing area. It could be said that he had made the best use of the runway.

Considering the fact that Xia ruofei had never flown a plane before, the landing could be said to be perfect, or even a miracle.

Brook felt much more at ease when he saw the plane’s speed drop. He followed the procedure and reminded Xia ruofei to place the propeller in slow motion at 70 knots to protect the engine.

“Understood!” Xia ruofei said. Then, he followed what Brook had taught him and slowed down the car.

The anti – thrust deceleration effect decreased, but the plane’s speed did not increase significantly. It was still slowly decreasing, and soon it dropped to taxiing speed.

This time, Xia ruofei didn’t need Brook’s reminder and immediately turned off the power source.

“Xia,” Brook said after some thought,”do you have the confidence to fly the plane onto the runway?”

Saipan airport only had one runway. If the plane was forced to land on the runway, it was equivalent to the closing of the airport. Now that everything was so smooth, Brook naturally wanted to make it more perfect by letting the plane enter the runway so that it would not occupy the runway.

Xia ruofei was full of confidence. He smiled and said,””We’ve already descended from such a high place, what’s the point of entering the slippery track? No problem!”

“OK!”Brook immediately contacted Tatai.”Tatai, flight QF108 has requested to leave the runway from the next exit!”

“I agree!” Taitai said bluntly.

The usually calm tower administrator was also unable to suppress his excitement.

He had seen very clearly from the tower that the Airbus A350, which had lost its right windshield, had landed steadily on the runway. He could not believe that it was piloted by a passenger who had never been in contact with a fixed – Wing plane. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

This administrator had once dreamed of flying, but he was eliminated during his aviation theory study stage. Later, he really couldn’t bear to leave the aviation field, so he changed his career to undergo administrator training. He had paid a lot of effort to be able to take on this extremely stressful job.

Seeing the scene of Xia ruofei’s landing, the officer found it hard to suppress his dream of flying.

Later, he really re – signed up for the company’s Pilot Recruitment. In the end, he successfully passed through a series of training and became a pilot, obtaining the career he had dreamed of.

Of course, this was all a story for later.

Xia ruofei naturally did not know that his actions would affect the life of an ordinary supervisor.

At this time, he was carefully controlling the plane, leaving the runway from the next exit and driving it onto the runway.

Fire engines, ambulances, and police cars were already lined up on the slippery track parallel to the running track. All sorts of police lights were flashing.

When the plane was taxiing, these special vehicles followed the plane on the runway.

When Xia ruofei controlled the plane to turn steadily into the runway, a guide car drove in front of the plane while the other cars stopped at the entrance of the runway. After the plane turned into the runway, they followed it.

The guide car brought the plane to an empty tarmac, and the staff sent a signal for the plane to stop.

When the plane landed steadily on the tarmac, Xia ruofei followed Brook’s instructions and quickly turned off the engine and the electric doors.

Even now, Brook still felt like he was in a dream. Now that his feet were on the ground, he still couldn’t believe that it was a passenger who had never flown a plane before who landed the plane. Even though he had seen it with his own eyes, he still couldn’t believe it.

Xia ruofei heaved a long sigh of relief, unfastened his seat belt, and turned around to smile at Feng Rao.””Sister ran, we’re finally on solid ground! I’m really afraid that I’ll slip and crash the plane ... If that’s the case, I’m really sorry. I was kind enough to let you go to Australia to relax, but I almost got you killed ...”

Feng Jing’s eyes were still teary. She could not explain what she was feeling. She did not pay attention to what was happening outside during the entire landing. She maintained an awkward position and stared at Xia ruofei without blinking. That was why her waist was sore and in pain.

When the plane touched the ground, she suddenly felt touched and couldn’t stop her tears.

At this time, the plane had been surrounded by all kinds of special vehicles. The crew members were organizing the passengers to evacuate. Everything was busy but orderly.

With tears in her eyes, Feng Rao burst into laughter and said,””You’re really stupid and bold! You’ve never even flown a plane before, yet you dare to sit on it!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”sister ran is on the plane!” I can’t just sit here and wait for death! I can only bite the bullet and do it!”

Feng Jing’s face reddened. Xia ruofei didn’t mean to say anything flirtatious. He even said it in a joking tone. However, after experiencing life and death together, Feng Jing’s heart throbbed even more intensely. Even a casual word from Xia ruofei could make her imagination run wild ...
