1965 Gift (2)

Liu Qian’s face turned red and she said,””President ... I ... I mean ... I don’t want it! This is too precious!”

“You’ve worked hard these few days. Consider it a reward from the boss!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Feng Jing had also finished distributing the jaded skin cream to everyone. There were only two bottles left. She put one bottle into her bag and then stuffed the last bottle into Liu Qian’s hands. She smiled and said,””Since the chairman gave it to you, you should accept it!”

“Then ... Alright!” Liu Qian happily took the jaded skin ointment.”Thank you, Chairman!”

At this moment, Huanhuan, who was in Xia ruofei’s arms, pouted and said,””Uncle Xia, Huanhuan is a girl too! Why was there no present? I also want that ... Jade skin cream!”

Everyone could not help but smile when they heard this. Xia ruofei gently pinched Huanhuan’s delicate little face and said,””Huanhuan is still young, she doesn’t need makeup for the time being ...”

Then, Xia ruofei changed the topic and said,””But uncle Xia has prepared another gift for you!”

“Really? I have a gift too?” Huan Huan immediately asked with her eyes wide open in joy.

“Of course! How could uncle Xia forget about Huanhuan when he bought her a present?” Xia ruofei said.

He then gestured for Feng Rao to take out the Hello Kitty toy from the paper bag.

“HelloKitty!”Huan Huan exclaimed in surprise.

Feng Rao stuffed the doll into Huanhuan’s hands and asked with a smile,”Huanhuan, do you like this gift?”

“I like it! I love Hello Kitty the most!” Huan Huan answered without hesitation.

“Then, do you want to thank Auntie?” Feng Rao asked jokingly.

“This is a gift from uncle Xia. I want to thank him,” Huan Huan said after some thought.

Then, Huanhuan’s soft lips kissed Xia ruofei’s cheek.

Everyone was overjoyed to see this.

Feng Jing giggled.”Uncle Xia bought this, but Auntie gave it to you just now. Don’t you need to thank Auntie?”

Huan Huan tilted her head and thought for a while before she said,”Mm! Thank you, Auntie!”

“Good girl!” Feng Jing turned her head and pointed to her cheek.”Should I kiss Auntie too?”

Huan Huan immediately showed a hesitant expression. After a long while, she said unwillingly,””Alright then ...”

Then, she leaned over and planted a kiss on Feng Rao’s cheek. However, she did so with much force.

Feng Rao looked at Xia ruofei, who was laughing non – stop, and couldn’t help but complain in her heart. This guy’s luck with women was really scary. Even such a young girl was captivated by him ...

Ma Zhiming and Tian Huixin also walked over.

“Xia Sheng, you’re always the one who has to pay for it. How can you accept it?” Ma Zhiming said.

Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s just a gift for the child. It won’t cost much. Mr. MA, you’re too kind!”

At this moment, a strong voice sounded from the door of the private room,””Everyone, I’m sorry! There was a traffic jam, so I’m a little late!”

Xia ruofei turned around, a look of surprise on her face.

The man standing at the door was the famous Fengshui master of Hong Kong, Xu lang.

“Uncle Xu!” Xia ruofei greeted her happily.

MA Xiong and the others also went up to him. As the host, MA Xiong also smiled and said, “It’s my honor that uncle Xu is willing to give me the honor! We’ve just arrived, and ... We haven’t even sat down yet!”

Xia ruofei noticed something interesting. The old Ma Xiong, Guo Hongjiang, and the others also addressed Xu Lang as “uncle Xu”. It was like a symbol for Xu lang, or rather, a symbol in Hong Kong’s Feng Shui world. It was deeply rooted in people’s hearts.

Xu lang smiled and said,”I heard that Xia Sheng is coming to Hong Kong. Of course, I’m here to get a drink!” Chairman MA, I haven’t seen you for a long time, and you look much better. It seems that you have a benefactor to help you!”

“Thank you for your kind words!” MA Xiong was overjoyed. In fact, Mr. Xia is our Ma family’s greatest benefactor!”

Although Xu Lang’s words were not as direct as steel, they were not that far off. Therefore, his words were completely different from the auspicious words that ordinary people would say casually. MA Xiong was naturally very happy to hear it.

Xu lang nodded in agreement and said,””Xia Sheng is a Dragon among men! With Xia Sheng’s help, Chairman Ma’s career and health will be greatly benefited!”

Other than Guo Hongjiang, everyone else had a strange look on their faces.

There was no other reason than Xu Lang’s high evaluation of him.

He was a Dragon among men. Even tycoon li, who had a close personal relationship with Xu lang, had never received such high praise from him.

Could it be that this young man’s future achievements would be higher than that of mogul li? Zheng jianian and the others couldn’t help but feel a sense of absurdity.

However, the person who said that was Xu lang, the famous uncle Xu, so they had no choice but to believe him.

Previously, they were respectful to Xia ruofei because of MA Xiong or because of the high – Quality one – headed abalones and truffles provided by his paradise Corporation. However, things were different now. Because of Xu Lang’s comment, Zheng jianian and the others regarded Xia ruofei more highly.

“Uncle Xu, Xia Sheng, everyone’s here. Please take your seats!” MA Xiong laughed.

“Good! Xia Sheng, please!” Uncle Xu said readily.

“Uncle Xu, please go first!” Xia ruofei took a step back.

Everyone walked towards the large round dining table.

When they sat down, MA Xiong initially insisted on letting Xia ruofei sit at the head seat. Of course, Xia ruofei strongly disagreed. Not to mention the difference in wealth, he was just a young man. Other than the people from the Paradise Corporation, who else was not a senior? Moreover, he was here as a guest today, so what was it like to sit on the main seat?

After a series of rejections, MA Xiong sat on the main seat helplessly.

Then, everyone sat down regardless of their status. As the main guest, Xia ruofei sat on the right side of MA Xiong. Uncle Xu sat on the left side of MA Xiong. Next, the Hong Kong team and the people from the Paradise Corporation sat on empty seats. This way, they could avoid the trouble of giving in to each other and it was also beneficial for everyone to interact.

Once the guests were seated, the service staff began to pour wine for everyone.

The first to taste was naturally the two bottles of expensive rotten wine that Xia ruofei had brought. Although there were many people present, when the two bottles were opened, everyone could still get a few glasses.

MA Xiong sniffed the glass and took a sip. He was surprised.”The wine fragrance is very special! As for the taste ... There was the smell of apples and oranges, and also a hint of mineral! The texture was rich! I’ve tasted Tokai’s eszenia before, and I feel that this bottle of xiasheng’s noble rot wine is of a higher quality than Tokai’s top essence wine!”

Xia ruofei had heard Old West introduce Tokai’s eszenia, also known as essence wine, to him before. It was also a type of expensive rotten wine, but it was the best of the expensive rotten wine and was well – known all over the world.

This kind of wine was brewed with the juice that naturally flowed out of the precious rotten raisins during the storage process due to gravity. The sugar content was extremely high, and the sugar content was generally 500 900g/L, which was much higher than honey. The alcohol content was about 1 3%, which could be stored almost permanently without going bad.

Because of the brewing process, the production was so low that it made people’s hair stand on end. As a result, the price was not something that ordinary people could afford.

MA Xiong’s evaluation was indeed high.

Other than the people from the Paradise Corporation, everyone present knew what was good. They couldn’t help but take a small sip.

Xia ruofei’s two bottles of noble rot wine received even more praise. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Xia ruofei also felt a sense of anticipation. After all, it had been a long time since he last tasted the expensive rotten wine. The time accelerated in the spirit map space and the primordial realm. The taste must have been richer.

So, he also raised his glass and took a sip.

At that moment, MA Xiong laughed and said,””It’s such a coincidence today that the first main course I’ve prepared for everyone is French foie gras. It’s made from the foie gras of the top lande goose that was air flown over from Austria. The top expensive rotten wine and the top French foie gras are simply a match made in heaven!”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei almost spat out the wine in his mouth.
