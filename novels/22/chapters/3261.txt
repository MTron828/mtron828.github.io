3262 Set off in full gear (1)

In Houston, America.

The sun was shining brightly, and there were no clouds in the sky. The black Phoenix flying ship hovered above a warehouse in the suburbs. Li Yifu stood respectfully in the courtyard to welcome them.

Xia ruofei was the first to jump off the flying boat, followed by Chen Nanfeng and the others.

“Senior granduncle, seniors, and fellow Daoists, you’ve had a long journey!” Li Yifu bowed and called out.

Xia ruofei kept the black Phoenix flying ship as he smiled and said,””You’ve worked hard! You’ve been keeping an eye on him in America all this time!”

Chen Nanfeng, Mu Sheng, and the others also greeted Li Yifu with a pleasant expression.

“This is what this disciple should do!” Li Yifu quickly said.

“Did everything go well after receiving the last batch of supplies and equipment?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Everything is going smoothly! Elon Musk didn’t play any tricks, and everything was delivered with good quality!” Li Yifu said,”the items are all in the warehouse. Grand uncle – Master, please come in!”

Xia ruofei nodded and the group of people followed Li Yifu into the warehouse.

Half a month ago, Xia ruofei had been here as well. He had personally received the Dragon Ship and the first batch of five Eva suits. They had been transported to this warehouse as well.

As Li Yifu walked, he said to Xia ruofei,””By the way, granduncle, Elon Musk’s son just had a comprehensive examination two days ago, and the results showed that the tumor in his body has completely disappeared. From a medical point of view, he has completely recovered. Those United States doctors thought it was incredible!” Elon Musk specifically asked me to convey his gratitude to you!” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”we’re just taking what we need.” By the way, I left your contact information with him, and he gave us a spaceship. I promised him that if he unfortunately gets an incurable disease in the future, he can ask me for help, and I will help him three times. My trip to the moon this time might not be short. If he really contacts you during this time, you have to explain it to him. ”

“Understood, martial granduncle!” Li Yifu said.

“Fellow Daoist Xia, you’ve sacrificed too much for our trip to the moon!” Chen Nanfeng said.

“Yup!” Mu Sheng also said,”we can’t let little brother Xia suffer a loss! If this American really needs you to treat him, we will provide all the rare herbs you need!”

“Agreed!” Liu Mansha nodded. Also, the trip to and from the moon will take a long time, and the energy consumption of the flying boat will also be very large. We’ve already discussed earlier that the required origin crystals will be borne by our sects, and we’ll hand them over to fellow Daoist Xia before we set off. ”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Seniors, you’re too polite. Since we’re working together, there’s no need to be so calculative ... Although I’m not as wealthy as you big sects, I can still afford the crystals we’ll use on the journey.”

“It’s one thing that you can afford it, but we can’t do that. ” Chen Nanfeng smiled and said,”if this gets out, we’ll be the ones taking advantage of the younger generation. It’s not nice to say! That’s why! We’ve already discussed it, so just do as we say!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”then I won’t stand on ceremony with you!”

As they spoke, everyone walked into the warehouse.

The corners of the warehouse were neatly stacked with boxes.

There were 13 slightly bigger boxes, which contained the entire set of EVA spacesuits.

The rest of the smaller boxes were all mass produced oxygen supply modules.

As the production of the oxygen supply module was relatively simple, apart from the ones that were delivered last time, Elon Musk had prepared a total of 3000 sets this time. The surplus was quite large. Even if Xia ruofei and the rest of the nine people were to use their EVA spacesuits the entire time, it would be more than enough to use for two months. Furthermore, with the Dragon Ship, they could spend most of their time in the ship and did not need to use the oxygen supply from the oxygen supply modules. This meant that the oxygen supply modules could last longer.

Once Xia ruofei entered the warehouse, he used his spiritual power to check all the supplies and equipment.

In fact, Chen Nanfeng, Mu Sheng, and the others were doing the same thing. However, they didn’t know much about spacesuits, so they couldn’t see any problems.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”there’s no problem with the items. Everyone, come and claim them!” We’ll split the oxygen supply modules equally. Everyone’s storage artifacts should be able to store them, right? If you can ‘t, just tell me, I can store more!”

The EVA suit was made according to everyone’s body size. There were nine specifications in total, with two sets of each. Of course, this included the five sets that were delivered last time. All the EVA suits were numbered, so everyone just had to find their own two sets according to the corresponding number.

Chen Xuan and the others took out the five spacesuits that they had used previously. Following the serial numbers, they found two of their own and kept them in their storage artifacts.

Xia ruofei also kept his own two sets.

Xia ruofei also told Ling Qingxue to keep her spacesuit.

This was the safest way. There were too many unknown factors in space. Xia ruofei could not guarantee that he would not be separated from Ling Qingxue. If that happened and Ling Qingxue’s EVA suit was with Xia ruofei, the outcome would be tragic. Therefore, as a last resort to save their lives, everyone had to keep their own EVA suit.
