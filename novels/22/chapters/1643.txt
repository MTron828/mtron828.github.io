Chapter 1644: A sharp turn for the worse (2)

Liu haofan said angrily,”do I need you to teach me that?” Damn it ... I’m so tired, cleaning up your mess every day!”

After that, he hung up the phone and began to contact various parties in an attempt to control the public opinion on the internet.

The only way Liu haofan could think of was to delete the post.

However, if it was five years ago, this method might have worked, but now that the mobile internet was so developed, there were as many self – Media as there were hairs on a cow. Once a piece of information spread, it was difficult to completely remove it from the internet.

With Zhao Yongjun and the others adding fuel to the fire, how could the online posts about the haunted construction site in Xiaotang town be completely deleted?

Therefore, after Liu haofan got busy, the mainstream media no longer reported on this. Actually, there were very few mainstream media reporting on this. After all, this was considered feudal superstition and did not conform to the mainstream values.

However, Weibo, WeChat public account, circle of friends, and other platforms couldn’t delete all of them. Weibo and WeChat articles about the ghost in little Tang town were still spreading in various WeChat groups.

Even though Liu haofan contacted Penguin corporation’s headquarters and matched the keywords to the relevant articles on WeChat official account, and a large number of official articles were deleted, new official accounts immediately emerged like bamboo shoots after the rain and published similar articles. It didn’t matter even if their accounts were banned.

This was naturally the work of Zhao Yongjun and the others.

In the end, Liu haofan’s efforts were in vain. He had lost many favors, but he couldn’t stop the public opinion from spreading.

Liu haofan had no choice but to get together with Zhou Tianyu, trying to come up with a plan.

In a private room of a high – Class club in the capital, Liu haofan dismissed all the drinking princesses and lit a cigar. After taking a long puff, he exhaled a long puff of smoke, as if he was trying to get rid of all the depression in his heart.

“Tell me! Old Zhou!” Liu haofan said with a dark expression,”do you have any good ways to deal with this? If this goes on, we’ll really lose all our capital on this land!”

Zhou Tianyu was also worried and said,””Young master Liu, it’s obvious that someone is behind this. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have spread so fast!”

Liu haofan waved his hand and said,”there’s no point in investigating who’s behind this now!” Our top priority now is to deal with this public opinion crisis, and how to solve the haunted land!”

After all, Liu haofan was from a big family, so he was more magnanimous when dealing with things. He knew that there must be someone behind this incident, but he was not sure if it was a deliberate plan or a smooth sailing. However, he was able to grasp the key to the matter and did not immediately investigate who was behind the turbulent public opinion.

After all, as long as this matter was handled well, he would have plenty of time to slowly find the mastermind when he was free.

Zhou Tianyu thought about it and said,””Young master Liu, we can’t suppress the public opinion anymore. Refuting the rumors now is not very convincing, and the key problem hasn’t been solved. Even if we’re lucky enough to get through this, what if a similar incident happens again?”

Zhou Tianyu’s words reminded Liu haofan. His eyes lit up and he suddenly had an idea.”Old Zhou, what do you think ... We should find a few Feng Shui masters to help and see if they can get rid of the dirty things? As long as there’s nothing wrong with the land, it’ll be easy for us to turn the public opinion around. ”

“Young master Liu, that’s not a bad idea!” Zhou Tianyu revealed a look of joy and said,”our company does have a few cultural and environmental consultants, but they usually only look at the Fengshui of the building and participate in the overall design planning. Sometimes, they help with the Fengshui layout and haunted things ...”

“I don’t need your men!” Liu haofan said. I’ll go find him from the Huaxia mystical society! They are all experts with real ability. I don’t believe that they can’t deal with a few little ghosts!”

Zhou Tianyu was overjoyed,”that’s great!” The members of the metaphysics society have real talent and knowledge. They’re not comparable to those swindlers!”

“Then it’s settled!” Liu haofan said,”I’m in charge of finding them!”

......

The next day, Liu haofan brought two old men to the real estate company.

If Xia ruofei was here, he would have recognized them immediately. One of them was du Qinghong, the president of the Sanshan mystic society whom he had met in Ling Xiaotian’s office a while ago.

In fact, du Qinghong was not only a leading figure in the field of mysticism in the three mountains, but he was also quite famous in the country. He was also a member of the Huaxia mystic society.

This time, du Qinghong had also come to the capital to participate in a national exchange event organized by the Huaxia mystical society. His good friend, director Shen Zhongliang, also known as the old man beside him, Qianqian, had been invited to help Liu haofan, so he had followed along.

Zhou Tianyu personally went to the headquarters of the Tang real estate to welcome them.

“Director Zhou, let me introduce you. This is the director of the Chinese mystical society, Shen Zhongliang, elder Shen.” Liu haofan said,”this is old Shen’s friend. He’s also the master of metaphysics, du Qinghong, old du!”

Zhou Tianyu quickly said,”old Shen, old du, how are you?” I’ll have to trouble you this time!”

Shen Zhongliang was slightly bigger than du Qing. His hair and beard were all white, and he looked like a Sage.

He smiled at Zhou Tianyu and said,””Director Zhou, you’re too kind. Let’s go to the scene directly! Tell us more about the situation on the way!”

“Alright, alright!” Zhou Tianyu said quickly. At the same time, he waved his hand and a Ford van that he had prepared slowly drove over.

“Please!” Zhou Tianyu respectfully asked the two Feng Shui masters to get into the car first, then he followed Liu haofan into the car.

The Ford van drove in the direction of the suburbs town of Tang.

On the way, Zhou Tianyu didn’t dare to hide anything. He told the two Feng Shui masters everything that happened at the construction site.

Shen Zhongliang and du Qinghong fell into deep thought after hearing the story.

“Old Shen, what do you think the problem is?” Liu haofan couldn’t help asking.

“It’s hard to say now, we’ll only know after we’ve seen the scene,”Shen Zhongliang said with a frown.

Du Qinghong also nodded.”Feng Shui is ever – changing. There are too many possibilities to deduce it based on what happened. We still have to investigate the site to come up with a more accurate conclusion.”

Liu haofan was still rather respectful towards the two Feng Shui masters. Shen Zhongliang had a very high reputation in the capital. Even the old master of Liu haofan’s family treated Shen Zhongliang with great respect. Hence, he naturally did not dare to put on airs in front of Shen Zhongliang.

“Then, old Shen ... Do you think there’s a good chance of solving the problem?” Liu haofan asked humbly.

Shen Zhongliang pondered for a moment and said,”little Liu, based on general manager Zhou’s description of the situation, there are many possibilities of this happening. However, most of them can be resolved. It’s just that the difficulty level is different.” Of course, I can’t give you any guarantees since I’ve never seen it Live!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Thank you, old Shen!” Liu haofan revealed a hint of joy.

He didn’t need Shen Zhongliang’s guarantee. In fact, he had already gotten the answer he wanted. Shen Zhongliang had never bragged about Feng Shui. Since he had said so, it meant that the possibility of solving the problem was very high.

Shen Zhongliang also thought so.

However, when Shen Zhongliang arrived at the construction site, he felt that he had been too optimistic.

The car stopped in front of the mobile house by the lake. The weird things happened near the mobile house, so Zhou Tianyu told the driver to stop there.

Of course, the place was empty now, and the workers had already left.

As soon as Shen Zhongliang and du Qinghong got out of the car, their expressions changed. They looked at each other and saw the shock in each other’s eyes.

Immediately after, the two of them took out their compasses at the same time and quickly checked their bearings. They also mumbled some words, as if they were calculating some important data.
