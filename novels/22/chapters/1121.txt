As soon as the door was opened, song Rui looked inside and asked,””Ruofei, has Lu You left?”

Xia ruofei leaned against the door frame and smiled.””Are you that afraid of her? Even if you’re not interested in her, you don’t have to be so afraid, right?”

“Not really, I just don’t want to see her ...” Song Rui chuckled.

Xia ruofei laughed evilly and turned around.””Lu You, song Rui said that he doesn’t want to see you!”

Song Rui was so frightened that he almost turned around and ran. However, he had only turned around and taken two steps when he realized that Xia ruofei was teasing him on purpose. He stopped and turned back to look. Indeed, he did not see Lu You.

Song Rui was so angry that he glared at Xia ruofei and said,””You can’t do this!”

Xia ruofei said,”hehe ... You’re so timid!” She had already left! Come in ...”

Song Rui then followed Xia ruofei into the room with a peace of mind.

As soon as he entered, song Rui asked impatiently,””RUO Fei, you should have rested well, right? Then, about my matter ...”

Xia ruofei glanced at song Rui and said,””You’ve really fallen for Zhuo Yiyi?”

“Of course!”

“Not just for fun? She’s a good girl!” Xia ruofei was a little worried and asked again.

As if he had been insulted, song Rui immediately said loudly,””Do I look like that kind of person? Let me tell you, ruofei, I fell for Zhuo Yiyi at first sight, and I was serious about wooing her. I was aiming for marriage. ”

“Alright, alright, alright! I’ll believe you, alright?” Xia ruofei said.

He took out a cigarette box and threw a cigarette to song Rui. Then, he took out a cigarette and lit it up. After taking a deep puff, he said,””I don’t have much experience in chasing girls, but I can give you a few suggestions.”

“You’re too humble,”song Rui quickly said,”you’re an expert in this aspect! Hurry up and tell me!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s useless for you to keep pestering her. Once Zhuo Yiyi gets used to this kind of interaction, she will subconsciously treat you as a good brother. So, you should give her some hints when necessary.”

Song Rui said gloomily,”I did!” Don’t even talk about hinting, I think it was basically a clear indication, but that girl seemed to be naturally slow in this aspect, she didn’t react at all ...”

“Then let’s just make it clear!” Xia ruofei said casually.

“No! If she rejects me, it’ll be hard to ask her out in the future. ” Song Rui said,”I can’t fight a battle that I’m not confident in!”

“You’re quite meticulous!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it seems like you’ve really taken it to heart.”

“Nonsense ...” Song Rui said.”What other good ideas do you have?”

“Since you can’t even hint or point it out, you might as well reveal your identity to her.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”with your family background, there aren’t many girls who aren’t moved.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Didn’t I tell you yesterday? I don’t want the lady to be with me because of my family background. ” Song Rui said gloomily,”this time, I really want to be in a pure relationship!”

“In that case, why don’t you just create some difficulties for her in her work and life, and then you can help her solve them.” Xia ruofei said,”with your strength, this should be as easy as blowing off dust, right? She might fall in love with you after a few times. ”

“Isn’t this playing tricks?”song Rui scratched his head and said. No, no, what kind of rotten idea is this? Can you do it?”

Xia ruofei leaned back on the sofa and said,””You can’t do this, you can’t do that. You’re quite hard to please!”

“It’s mainly because the methods you mentioned are a little unreliable ...” Song Rui smiled apologetically.”Help your brother think about it again!”

Xia ruofei took a puff of his cigarette and stubbed it out in the ashtray. He said,””In that case, I only have one last suggestion. Whether you agree or not, or whether it’s effective or not, I’ll just give you this one.”

“You say it, you say it!” Song Rui quickly said.

“Since a frontal attack is not effective, then we’ll take a roundabout route!” Xia ruofei said slowly,”war is all about strategy and tactics. You can’t just rush and fight when you’re chasing girls, right?”

Song Rui showed a thoughtful expression and asked,””Tell me in detail, how do we do it from the side?”

Xia ruofei replied,”she’s just doing the work of the people around her!” “Her best friends, colleagues, friends, and so on ... Start with them and build a good relationship with them. Let these people around Zhuo Yiyi often say good things about you, or deliberately make fun of the two of you. As time goes by, Zhuo Yiyi will probably be influenced by them without her knowing!”

Song Rui’s eyes slowly lit up after hearing this.

“That’s a good idea!” Song Rui said excitedly,”you don’t say, but it’s quite feasible! During this period of time, whenever I asked Zhuo Yiyi out for a meal or to play, she would often bring along some colleagues and friends. After a while, I’ve already gotten to know quite a few of them! It’s just that I didn’t specially interact with them ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”then let’s start now!” Give them some small gifts, treat them to a meal, help them out a little, and so on. They should be easily bribed by you. ”

“How can you call it bribing?” Song Rui chuckled and said,”I’m taking a roundabout route. You said it yourself!”

“Okay, okay, take a detour from the side ...” Xia ruofei shrugged his shoulders.
