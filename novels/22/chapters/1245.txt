Chapter 1246: A perfect ending (1)

Translator: 549690339

Just then, Xia ruofei felt his phone vibrate.

He took it out of his pocket and saw that Feng Jing had sent him a WeChat message: Chairman, you’ve already become the focus of everyone just now. You should do this job of showing your face! ‘Sacrificing’ you alone is better than both of us ‘sacrificing’, right?

There were also a few snickering emojis attached to the message.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile bitterly,’so he’s throwing me out!’

However, since everyone was clapping and Dong Jiajun kept signaling to him from the stage, Xia ruofei had to go up even if he had to force a duck to the perch.

Fortunately, he was used to big scenes in the past two years. Even in front of a Big Chief like elder song, he could remain calm, so there was no problem with stage fright.

Xia ruofei muted his phone, stood up, and walked towards the stage. He buttoned the first button of his suit.

Xia ruofei took the microphone from Dong Jiajun and said with a smile,””There was a small interlude in today’s auction, but the overall effect was very good. Once again, on behalf of the Paradise Corporation, I would like to thank my friends for your support! I would also like to thank everyone for your recognition of our company’s products!”

Then, Xia ruofei started to’ shamelessly ‘promote the peach blossom company.””Our company is a company that specializes in high – end agricultural products, pure Traditional Chinese Medicine cosmetics, and high – end Traditional Chinese Medicine herbs. Since the beginning of the company’s establishment, we have determined to go on the high – Quality route. I believe that friends who know our company know that in the past two years, we have launched Taoyuan brand vegetables, fruits, abalone, truffles, and so on, all of which are of the highest quality. Not long ago, our company’s Jade skin cream has created many sales miracles in a short time ...”

Xia ruofei had been speaking on stage for four to five minutes, but no one felt bored.

Some people might have participated in the last auction of the best abalone, and some people might be using the jaded skin cream, but many people didn’t know that these famous products came from the same company in the mainland.

After Xia ruofei’s brief introduction, many people could not help but be shocked.

With so many products, any one of them could become a company’s fist product, but this paradise Corporation seemed to have no end, pushing out one product after another.

Even the world’s richest people with billions of dollars had developed a strong interest in the Paradise company.

As the best in the business world, they naturally knew that the potential of such a company was almost infinite.

Perhaps the current scale of paradise Corporation was insignificant compared to their company, but no one could predict what would happen in the future.

To borrow the words of a great man, the Paradise Corporation was like the sun at eight or nine in the morning, rising slowly!

Xia ruofei didn’t take up too much time. He knew that when things reached an extreme, they would reverse. If he said too much, it would only annoy others. In the end, the news media would only report the essence of the story.

So, he stopped his self – praise at the right time and said with a smile,””I was planning to hold another private auction tonight, but someone’s quite tactful. Now that I only have a piece of white truffle, it seems like there’s no need to hold another auction ...” He thought.

Everyone couldn’t help but smile when they heard this, and many of them turned their heads to look at Blake.

Blake sat in his seat with a dark face. He stared at Xia ruofei on the stage with a venomous look.

This was a grudge, but Xia ruofei did not care. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He continued,”so I’ve decided that the final truffle will be auctioned here!” Hmm...I’ll donate all the money I earn from the auction to the Hong Kong Charity Association! I hope everyone will bid enthusiastically. This is also a good deed! I’ll return the stage to Mr. Lu and let him host the final charity auction!”

There was a round of applause from the audience. Many people were praising Xia ruofei’s charity. The White truffle was worth at least 200000 US dollars. It was a commendable act to donate it all in one go.

The media reporters were also writing furiously. It seemed that they would also report this detail in detail.

Blake was even more jealous and hateful that all the good things were taken away by Xia ruofei. He had gained both fame and fortune! Although he had paid more than 200000 dollars, Xia ruofei had earned a few hundred thousand dollars more from the truffle that Blake had bought! He had earned a lot of money, at least 500000 dollars more, and had a good reputation in the end.

As for Blake himself, he suffered a double loss and became the biggest joke of this auction.

In everyone’s eyes, Blake was simply a clown through and through.

Xia ruofei took two steps towards the entrance of the stage and stopped. She picked up the microphone again and said,””Oh right, there’s something I almost forgot to tell you. Tao Yuan company and Hong Kong’s Hengfeng industry have reached a strategic cooperation agreement. In the future, our company’s top food ingredients, Chinese medicinal herbs, and other precious products will be auctioned together with Hengfeng auction house. I hope that everyone will continue to support us and Hengfeng auction house!”

Xia ruofei paused and then smiled mysteriously.””For example, the top – grade abalone we auctioned last time, or the top – grade truffles we have today ... We will continue to sell them in the future! “In short, please remember one thing. You can buy the world’s top ingredients and Chinese medicinal herbs from the Paradise Corporation at the Hengfeng auction house! For more specific information, please pay attention to either the peach blossom company or the Hengfeng auction house’s official website!”
