2993 A shallow friendship (1)

Mu Sheng glanced at the big bag of spirit stones and directly used his spiritual power to grab some of them from the air and piled them on the ground. Then he smiled and said,””Fellow Daoist Xia, you can keep the spirit stones you need to purchase the remaining five firecloud pills! After you’ve prepared the firecloud pills, you can just give them to us. ”

Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and smiled.”Sect leader mu, do you trust us that much?”

Mu Sheng laughed and said,”I think I’m quite good at judging people!” Fellow Daoist Xia is a man of great ambitions, so why would he betray us for mere spirit stones?”

Xia ruofei didn’t hesitate and kept the 5000 spiritual stones. He said,””I’ll prepare the five firecloud pills as soon as possible. I won’t delay your son’s treatment!”

“In that case, I’ll have to thank fellow Daoist Xia in advance!” Mu Sheng said happily. Then, he said to mu Jianfei,”Fei ‘er, why don’t you quickly thank fellow Daoist Xia?”

Mu Jianfei quickly bowed and said,””Thank you, Xia ... Senior!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Brother Jianfei, it looks like you’re a few years older than me. I don’t dare to call you senior. We can just call each other brothers!”

Mu Sheng waved his hand and said,”fellow Daoist Xia is the junior Brother of sect leader Luo. According to seniority, it’s reasonable for Fei ‘er to call you senior. What’s wrong with that?”

“Sect leader mu, it’s better for us to discuss our own matters.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”brother Jianfei, what do you think?”

Mu Jianfei naturally didn’t like to be one generation lower than him. So, after hearing Xia ruofei’s words, he couldn’t help but look at Mu Sheng. He saw Mu Sheng nod his head slightly, so he reluctantly said,””Then ... Then we’ll do as brother Xia says! I really have to thank brother Xia this time! Regardless of whether my injuries can recover successfully or not, I will definitely remember brother Xia’s kindness in my heart!”

“Brother Jianfei, you’re too polite!” Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s just a fair trade. Your father has paid enough spiritual stones, and it’s in advance.”

“Business is one thing, but you can’t forget the favor!” Mu Sheng waved his hand and said,”if you could only buy the firecloud pill with spirit stones, Fei ‘er’s injury wouldn’t have been delayed until now. Fellow Daoist Xia, the whole vast waves sect is grateful for your help!”

Xia ruofei could see that Mu Sheng was really forthright and his words came from the bottom of his heart, so he smiled and cupped his hands.

“Fellow Daoist Xia, what I’m going to say next might be a little profound, but I’m on good terms with fellow Daoist Xia, so I’d like to say it,” Mu Sheng continued.

“I’m all ears!”Xia ruofei smiled.

Mu Sheng nodded and said,”fellow Daoist Xia, your sect has made a big splash in this auction, especially fellow Daoist Xia. It’s your first time in the world of cultivation, but you’re already dazzling.” This was a good thing, but it could also bring a lot of trouble. You must know that many of the people attending today’s auction have never followed the rules, and it wouldn’t be wrong to call them evil. As the saying goes, one must always be on guard against others, so fellow Daoist Xia should be prepared!”

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile.”Thank you for your reminder, sect leader mu. I will be on high alert. I will be careful at all times!”

Mu Sheng nodded with relief and said,””If there’s a need, Daoist Xia and sect leader Luo can leave with our surging waves sect after the auction. This way, we can look out for each other.”

Mu Sheng’s words touched Xia ruofei.

Anyone with eyes could see that Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng had become the focus of attention. Not only did they carry a large number of spiritual stones, but they also had a pair of valuable storage rings. Therefore, after the two of them left the auction, their journey would not be peaceful. Mu Sheng had taken the initiative to help Xia ruofei bear the burden regardless of the danger. For someone who had just met him, Mu Sheng’s action was undoubtedly very magnanimous.

Without waiting for Xia ruofei’s reply, Mu Sheng immediately said,””Fellow Daoist Xia, please don’t misunderstand. This mu is doing this for Fei ‘er’s sake. After all, we still need fellow Daoist Xia to provide us with firecloud pills! The one who doesn’t want anything to happen to you two is definitely me, haha ...”

Xia ruofei nodded.”Thank you, sect leader mu. If there’s a need, I’ll take the initiative to contact you.”

“Alright!” Mu Sheng said. We won’t disturb you any longer ...”

Then, Mu Sheng took out a name card and a jade pendant from his storage ring and handed them to Xia ruofei. He said,””After fellow Daoist Xia has prepared the firecloud pills, you can contact the person on the name card at any time. Use the jade pendant as a token and he will send the news back to our vast waves sect as soon as possible!”

Xia ruofei looked at the name card and the jade pendant and kept it. “”No problem! If everything goes well, I should be able to get it ready in three to five days. ”

“Farewell!” Mu Sheng cupped his hands at Xia ruofei, then left the private room with mu Jianfei and mu Hua.

The No. 20 private room was quiet again, leaving only Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

After Xia ruofei set up the various shielding barriers again, he said to Luo Qingfeng,””Qingfeng, Mu Sheng looks like a good person. What’s his reputation in the world of cultivation?”

“It’s considered a more positive one!” Luo Qingfeng said,”he’s forthright and righteous. He rarely has any negative news. Also, he’s usually blunt to people he doesn’t like, so there’s also a small group of people who hate him ...”

“In that case, he shouldn’t have any other purpose in inviting us to travel together?” Xia ruofei said.

“Master,” Luo Qingfeng quickly said,”after all, we’re not friends yet. My understanding of Mu Sheng is only superficial. For safety reasons, we should ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.”I know that. I don’t really intend to travel with them.”

Mu Sheng’s cultivation level was a little higher than Luo Qingfeng ‘s, but he was not of much use against those late – Stage golden core cultivators. Moreover, he had brought mu Hua and mu Jianfei with him, so they would definitely be a burden. Whether they could be of any help was another matter, and they might even become a burden instead.

The most important thing was that if it was just Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng, Xia ruofei could deal with any emergency that they could not resist. In the worst case scenario, he could hide in the spirit map space with Luo Qingfeng. This way, they could avoid the search of strong enemies.

Anyway, Luo Qingfeng’s sea of consciousness had already been imprinted with a soul seal, so he could never betray Xia ruofei.

Previously, he did not tell Luo Qingfeng about the spirit map space because he thought that it was better to avoid unnecessary trouble. If it was really an emergency, there was no need to avoid Luo Qingfeng.

In fact, Xia ruofei’s first soul slave, Liu chengfeng, knew about the spirit map space.

If he were to travel with Mu Sheng and the others, he would naturally have many concerns and would not be able to use the spirit map space anytime and anywhere.

“Let’s not think too much about it. We’ll take it one step at a time!”Xia ruofei said.

After saying that, Xia ruofei picked up the pair of rings that Mu Sheng had left behind and started to play with them.

This pair of storage rings was indeed very exquisite. The Phoenix patterns carved on it were lifelike, and the shape was small and exquisite. It was very beautiful, and one could tell at a glance that it was the type for girls.

Although these were made by ancient cultivators, even in modern times, according to the aesthetic standards of the secular world, these rings were still quite beautiful. They were not inferior to the standard of jewelry designers.

Of course, from a cultivator’s point of view, they might value functionality more.

Hence, after fiddling with it for a while, Xia ruofei tried to use his spiritual power to enter the storage ring.

The ownership of this pair of storage rings had been canceled before the auction. At the moment, it could be directly explored with mental power, but once the blood ownership was established, only the master’s mental power could penetrate it.

Basically, all storage rings were designed this way.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power went in and felt a space that wasn’t very big. It was about 10 meters in length, width, and height, exactly the same as the introduction before the auction.

It was Xia ruofei’s first time experiencing the space in the storage ring.

His first thought was that there was a huge difference between this kind of storage space and a spirit map space. The most obvious thing was that the space in the storage ring was dead. There was no life force at all, and there was no air at all. If a living thing was forcibly put into the storage space, it would naturally die instantly.

However, the spirit map space was completely different. Even if he used his spiritual power to sense it from the outside world, he could feel the exuberant vitality.

The space within the ring was naturally empty.

Xia ruofei scanned the two rings with his spiritual energy and suddenly felt something special ...
