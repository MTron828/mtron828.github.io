3209 Flying in the sky and Embracing the Moon (2)

Liu Mansha’s disciple, Yu xiner, nodded and said,”Master, that’s true. At that time, it was an arms race between two superpowers, so many projects were more radical and rushed. However, the Americans did successfully land on the moon in the 1960s.”

Yu Xin ‘er was also a young person. She had once lived in modern society and even had a postgraduate degree. Therefore, she was very clear about the historical common sense of the Cold War and the arms race between the two superpowers.

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”there are also some doubts on the internet. They say that the Americans landing on the moon is a huge scam and a fake.” However, this is not the scope of our discussion. In fact, even 70 to 80 years ago, human technology could already achieve the moon landing. So, with the help of some modern technology, we may be able to make our moon landing journey smoother. ”

“Indeed, the EVA suit can provide both pressurized and oxygen. However, there’s a limit to the amount of oxygen it can provide. In any case, I don’t think it’ll last for half a month!” Chen Xuan replied.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I think it’s five to eight hours!” Even with the backup oxygen tank, it shouldn’t exceed nine hours. Naturally, it’s far from enough. ”

“However ...” Xia ruofei changed the topic.”Modern spacesuits are all modular. As long as we prepare enough oxygen modules and replace them after use, theoretically, we should be able to last long enough.”

“I still need to prepare a few more spacesuits as backup.” Yu Xin ‘er thought for a moment.”After all, it’ll be very dangerous if the spacesuits malfunctioned during such a long voyage.”

Xia ruofei nodded and smiled.””That’s true. Whether it’s oxygen or the spacesuits, we have to calculate it according to the return trip and leave enough oxygen. Otherwise, it’ll be quite dangerous if we run out of oxygen on the way!”

Xia ruofei, Chen Xuan, Yu xiner, and the other young people started to discuss the oxygen supply for the journey. Chen Nanfeng and the other older generation cultivators could not even interrupt.

In the end, Xia ruofei said,”in theory, the plan we just discussed should be able to solve most of the problems.” What’s more important now is whether the airboat can fly in outer space and whether its performance will be affected if it can. ”

“That’s right.” Chen Xuan nodded.”Our discussion will be meaningless if the flying boat can’t be used. It’s simply unrealistic to rely on sword Kinesis flight to the moon. However, I still have one question. Where are we going to get so many spacesuits and support modules? You can’t find this on the market. ”

Mu Sheng asked,”nephew, didn’t you just say that the United States are using this to land on the moon?” “Also, didn’t you just say that some people from China have entered outer space and have such spacesuits? can’t we just go and get them? Let’s not touch the Chinese for now. It’ll be a waste not to take the American stuff!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be shocked. Stealing a spacesuit from NASA? If it were golden core cultivators like Mu Sheng or Chen Xuan, they would definitely be able to destroy NASA. It wouldn’t be difficult for them to steal a few spacesuits.

However, Xia ruofei still shook his head and said,””I’ll think of a way to get some through legal channels. If it doesn’t work, we’ll go and ... Get it!”

Xia ruofei felt that the word “steal” was a bit uncouth, so he copied Mu Sheng and used the word “take”.

“Can fellow Daoist Xia come up with a solution?” Liu Mansha asked.

“I’ll try!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll ask my friend United States to think of a way to see if there are any legal channels to solve the problem of the spacesuits.”

“Alright!” Chen Nanfeng said. Then I’ll leave this matter to fellow Daoist Xia! If there’s any cost, our sects will bear it together!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”The spacesuits are definitely not cheap. However, money is nothing to us. It’s best to use money to solve our problems!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Chen Nanfeng and the others all nodded in agreement.

Xia ruofei continued,”putting aside the issue of whether the flying boat can be used, we still need to determine the candidates for the moon.” Due to the harsh environment and limited resources, we can’t have too many people. ”

At this point, Xia ruofei looked at Chen Nanfeng and the others. After hesitating for a while, he said,””First of all, I think ... We should choose people who can sense the music!”

Xia ruofei’s words were equivalent to excluding Chen Nanfeng, Mu Sheng, and Liu Mansha, the three masters.

The three of them were naturally not too willing, and they all slightly frowned in unison.

Xia ruofei said,”seniors, please don’t misunderstand. I’m just thinking that the screening mechanism of this song is so complicated, and we haven’t figured out the criteria yet. I think it’s best to follow the results of the screening. If we can’t sense the wonderful situation of the song and force our way in, I’m afraid there will be some unknown dangers.” “You must know that the moon is seven to eight hundred thousand li away from earth. There’s not even a blade of grass, no one, not even air. If we really encounter any danger, I think ... The possibility of survival is extremely low!”

Chen Nanfeng and the other two all revealed thoughtful expressions.

To be honest, with their cultivation base, they could not be said to be able to do whatever they wanted in the cultivation world, but they could not meet many evenly matched opponents. Such an expert would naturally have a kind of self – confidence that came from the heart.

However, when it came to the moon, which was 700000 to 800000 miles away, the unfamiliar and harsh environment there was terrifying. Even Chen Nanfeng and the others were convinced by Xia ruofei’s words.

This song was indeed very strange. Whether it was the selected or not, no one could figure out the reason behind it. Xia ruofei and the others were also selected for no reason, while Chen Nanfeng and the other two were eliminated with confused faces.

No matter what, the screening mechanism that took so much effort to come up with couldn’t be just a child’s play. There must be a purpose.

If one was not selected and forced to go, they might really encounter great danger. If they were not careful, they would die.

At Chen Nanfeng and Liu Mansha’s level of cultivation, they naturally cherished their lives even more. After all, they still had many days to live! Moreover, his status in the world of cultivation was so high that it was indeed not advisable to take risks.

Chen Nanfeng lowered his head and muttered to himself for a while. Finally, he resisted the temptation of the secret realm and slowly nodded.”I agree with fellow Daoist Xia’s opinion. If you can’t sense the music, then don’t add to the trouble this time!”

Since Chen Nanfeng had already expressed his opinion, Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha naturally did not have any objections. The two of them smiled bitterly and agreed.

This also meant that these three leaders of the sects would no longer have the chance to come into contact with the mystic realm that might exist on the moon.

Chen Nanfeng said,’even so, there are still a lot of people who can connect with music. We have to keep it simple! Shen tianfang and Chen Xuan must participate in the competition. How about this? Our sect will send two people, and each of your three sides will send one. How about it?”

There were three people from the first heaven society who could sense the music. They were Shen tianfang, who was in the mid – Aurous core stage, Chen Xuan, who was in the early Aurous core stage, and Xu yurou, who was in the Qi refining stage.

As for the surging waves sect and soaring Flower Valley, only one Jindan stage elder was able to sense the wondrous situation in the music. The rest were Qi condensation disciples.

Chen Nanfeng’s plan had indeed reduced the number of people by a lot. The first heaven society’s high – end combat forces could all participate, while the surging waves sect and soaring Flower Valley could also send golden core cultivators. Even Xia ruofei himself was in the early golden core stage. It could be said that it was relatively average.

The first heaven society had two tokens, so it was only natural that they had more spots.

Everyone fell into deep thought after hearing Chen Nanfeng’s plan.
