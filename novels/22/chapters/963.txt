Translator: 549690339

After checking in at the VIP counter, Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao stood at the security entrance and said goodbye to Liang Qichao and Tang Yitian’s family.

Xia ruofei called Tang Haoran over and said,””Haoran, master is not with you. You must be more careful when you cultivate. At the same time, you must persist every day and not slack off!”

“I know, master!” Tang Haoran looked at Xia ruofei with some reluctance and said in a low voice.

The little guy had always been close to Xia ruofei. Ever since he became Xia ruofei’s disciple, there was a sense of worship and respect in this closeness. If Xia ruofei wanted to return to his country, the person who would be most reluctant to see him leave was Tang Haoran.

Xia ruofei patted Tang Haoran’s head and smiled.””Don’t look so sad ... Master will come to Australia again soon. ”

“Really?” Tang Haoran suddenly raised his head and asked.

“When have I ever lied to you?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I still have some matters to attend to at the winery. I’ll have to come back in two months at most! When the time comes, I’ll check on your cultivation progress! If you’re lazy ...”

“Master, I promise I won’t be lazy!” Tang Haoran said quickly.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”then I’ll see what you do!”

Then, Xia ruofei looked at Tang Yitian and said,””Big brother Tang, call me at any time if there’s any problem with Haoran’s cultivation. If the situation is urgent, you can send him to China directly by private jet!”

“Alright!” “Thank you, ruofei!” Tang Yitian said.

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand,”you don’t have to be so polite.” By the way, I’ll have to trouble you to take care of Paradise Farm and my two wineries. ”

“That’s a must. Don’t worry!” Tang Yitian said with a smile.

Xia ruofei nodded and looked at Liang Qichao.””Brother Liang, I’ll leave the farm to you. This batch of experimental planting is almost over, so quickly come up with a demand plan. I’ll prepare the seeds needed for large – scale planting when I return to China!”

“Understood!” Liang Qichao grinned.”You don’t have to worry about the things here!”

With such a strong ally like the Meiya group, Liang Qichao was now full of confidence in running his farm well. Thinking of his achievements in Australia and being noticed by Grandpa Tang He, Liang Qichao was grateful to Xia ruofei from the bottom of his heart.

While Xia ruofei was talking to Tang Yitian and the others, Lin Qiao was also talking to Jennifer.

She also had a reluctant expression on her face. After all, Jennifer was her idol for many years! And after this period of time, her friendship with Jennifer had also warmed up rapidly, and now they were already close friends.

“Qiao’ er, it’s time to go!”Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Oh ...” Lin Qiao said reluctantly. Then, she seized the time to say a few words to Jennifer before she walked toward Xia ruofei.

The big luggage had already been checked in. Xia ruofei took his simple luggage and waved goodbye to everyone with Lin Qiao. Then, they walked into the International security check. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

……

More than nine hours later, the Boeing 787 of Heron Island Airlines was approaching its destination, the Changping International Airport in Sanshan city, after a long flight.

Compared to the excitement of going to Australia, Lin Qiao seemed to be in low spirits on the return trip. She was silent most of the time. She was either watching movies with the multimedia audio and video equipment in the first – Class cabin or resting with her eyes closed. She rarely spoke to Xia ruofei.

For Lin Qiao, the experience of the past 20 days was like a dream, a very dreamy and beautiful dream.

In this dream, she met Jennifer, the female star she admired the most, and even became her best friend. This was something that she would not have dared to dream of before.

Of course, the most important thing was that Xia ruofei belonged to her alone in these 20 days. The two of them toured Australia together. Whether it was the beautiful Great Barrier Reef, the gloomy Port Arthur prison, or the exotic southberg National Park, they left their footprints and laughter.

However, she had to wake up from her dream.

As the plane got closer to the three mountains, Lin Qiao felt like she was losing Xia ruofei.

After the plane landed, Xia ruofei would become Ling Qingxue’s boyfriend again, and she could only be a naughty and unruly sister.

Lin Qiao knew very well that although Xia ruofei doted on her to the extreme, it was completely the love of an older brother to his younger sister. She had never entered the depths of Xia ruofei’s heart.

Xia ruofei also noticed Lin Qiao’s silence, but he thought that Lin Qiao was a little depressed because she had finished her journey and left her idol, Jennifer, at the same time, so he did not take it to heart.

No matter how reluctant Lin Qiao was, the plane finally landed smoothly on the runway of Changping International Airport.

After a short wait, the cabin door opened.

Xia ruofei took his small suitcase from the luggage compartment and said with a smile,” “Qiao’ er, why are you in a daze? It’s time to get off the plane!”

Lin Qiao felt like she had just woken up from a dream. With a flash of disappointment in her eyes, she stood up and said,” “Oh ... Then let’s go!”

Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”what’s wrong?” He didn’t look very happy! You’ll be going to university on Egret Island in a few days, and a colorful new life is waving at you! Why do you look so sad?”

The acceptance of the first batch of undergraduate students was very fast. While they were still touring Australia, the letter of acceptance had already been sent to Tao Yuan farm. Of course, this was found out by Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao when they had a video call with Hu Zi’s mother.

Before going abroad, Xia ruofei had taught Hu Zi’s mother how to use WeChat to video chat. This was also something that Hu Zi’s mother had asked for. As international long – distance calls were too expensive, she had always maintained a frugal habit.

It was fine if Xia ruofei didn’t mention going to college on Egret Island, but once he did, Lin Qiao became even more dejected.

She would be leaving the three mountains very soon. Although Egret Island was very close to the three mountains, and the time between cities had been shortened to less than two hours after the high – speed rail was established, they were no longer living in the same city. Furthermore, Xia ruofei already had an outstanding girlfriend like Ling Qingxue.

In Lin Qiao’s eyes, her hope was extremely slim.

She squeezed out a smile and said,”I’m fine. Maybe I’m a little tired from the long flight.” Let’s go, brother ruofei!”

Then, Lin Qiao naturally held Xia ruofei’s arm.

Xia ruofei was already used to Lin Qiao’s intimate actions and did not feel uncomfortable. The two of them walked out of the cabin affectionately.

The plane landed at around 19 O’ clock in China Standard Time. When Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao walked out with their checked – in luggage, it was already past 7:30 in the evening.

Lei Hu was still the one to receive them. He had been waiting at the International departure hall for a long time. When he saw Xia ruofei and Xia ruofei, he immediately went up to them and took their luggage from Xia ruofei’s hands.

“Brother Xia, you must be tired from the journey!” Lei Hu asked with a smile as he led the two forward.

“It’s alright, Qiao’ er is a little tired!” Xia ruofei smiled and continued to ask,”is there anything urgent in the company?”

Xia ruofei was just asking. The company was now under the management of Feng Jing and the others and was on the right track. Under normal circumstances, there would not be any problems. Moreover, if there was an emergency, Feng Jing would have called him long ago.

“Everything is normal!” Lei Hu laughed. Oh right, class monitor ye has already returned to the farm. ”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, then he smiled and asked,””This kid has already finished his apprenticeship? Could it be that he didn’t perform well and was chased back by old man Li Zhifu?”

Ye Lingyun had been on Mount Wuyi for the past half a year, learning how to make tea from li Zhifu. Xia ruofei didn’t expect him to be back so soon.

Speaking of which, ye Lingyun was the person in charge of security. However, because he had not been in position for a long time, Lei Hu was temporarily in charge.

“I’m not too sure about that,” Lei Hu laughed.”In any case, class monitor ye himself said that he’s finished his apprenticeship. It was his master who asked him to come back!”

“This kid ...” Xia ruofei laughed and scolded,”I’ll interrogate him properly later!”

Just as they walked out of the International departure hall and were about to head to the parking lot, Xia ruofei’s phone rang.

Xia ruofei took it out and looked at the caller ID. He raised his eyebrows and answered the call immediately.
