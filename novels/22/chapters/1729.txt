Chapter 1730: Handling it with ease (2)

Xia ruofei pointed at Feng Rao and said with a smile,””I’m the president’s superior. You’re just trying to demote me!”

Feng Rao was laughing hysterically at the side, and her fans were also very happy. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

It was still the short – haired girl who said,””President Xia, does the overbearing President sound nice? How could he be called a bossy Chairman? It sounds so LOW!”

“Alright, alright!” Xia ruofei surrendered.”You can call me whatever you want! As long as you’re happy ...”

Seeing Xia ruofei so approachable, the fans gradually became more courageous and started to say,”

“Hehe! You’re the best, President Xia!”

“President Xia, you’re so handsome!”

“President Xia, do you have a girlfriend?”

......

“Why do I feel like you guys are harder to deal with than the reporters?” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.

Her words caused another round of laughter. The reporters had not left and were still filming Xia ruofei’s interaction with his fans. They laughed even harder when they heard what she said.

In the end, Xia ruofei took photos with his fans and even signed autographs for them. He was satisfied with being a big star.

Then, he did not need to take the passenger route anymore. Whether it was the reporters or the fans, they all left on their own accord. After all, Xia ruofei had given them face and they did not want to make things difficult for him.

After walking out of the airport, Xia ruofei heaved a sigh of relief and said to Feng Jing,””Sister ran, I think it’s more tiring than running a five – kilometer weighted cross – country! Look at my back, it’s all wet ...”

“Now you know how hard it is to become famous!” Feng Rao grinned.

Xia ruofei replied,”I’ve always known!” That’s why I’ve always pushed you to the front desk, right? It was a mistake this time ...”

Feng Rao glared at Xia ruofei and said,””You still have the nerve to say that? Hmph! You’re getting your retribution now ...”

As the two of them were talking, a voice rang out from the side,””Xia yingxiong! You’re so haughty now! Why didn’t you tell us in advance that you’re coming back?”

Xia ruofei followed the sound and saw Zhao Yongjun, song Rui, Liu Jian, Xu Zixuan, Hou Liang, Wei Jun, and the others all at the airport.

Of course, his driver, Wu Qiang, was also with these people.

It was song Rui who had just spoken. He walked over and sized Xia ruofei up and down while making a clicking sound. “It’s really different being a hero! He had a strong aura! We saw so many reporters interviewing you just now, but we didn’t dare to come out and meet them. We were afraid that you wouldn’t acknowledge us poor brothers!”

Xia ruofei rolled his eyes and said,”Song Rui, I didn’t tell you, but aren’t you here? How? You’re asking Wu Qiang for my flight number again?”

Zhao Yongjun laughed and said,”why would we need to find Wu Qiang?” The moment you got on the plane in Australia, news of your return was all over the place. Just open Weibo and you’ll see your flight number, landing time, and all sorts of other things!”

“D * MN ...” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but say,”will I lose my freedom in the future?” Do I have to wear a mask and glasses when I go out?”

Song Rui laughed and said,”you just found out!” We’ve been in Beijing for the past few days, and we’ve heard so much about you that our ears are getting calluses! I say, you’re really something, kid! You can get into such a big trouble just by taking a plane, I should say that you’re lucky! Or should I say that you’re a little unlucky!”

“Who knows!” Xia ruofei said with a bitter face,”I’ve been thinking these few days if I should ask for a fortune – teller or find a master to help me change my luck ...”

Zhao Yongjun and the others almost burst out laughing. To them, Xia ruofei was the real master! The plot of land in little Tang town had been a godly operation that left them in awe.

However, because Feng Zhu was here and Wei Jun and the others didn’t know the details, Zhao Yong Jun and the others didn’t mention the nine rotation universe formation.

However, song Rui said,”yes!” Who told you to leave us to work so hard and go to Australia to have fun?”

“Alright, alright,” Zhao Yongjun said,”it’s a cold day, so let’s not stand here and talk. Let’s go back and talk!”

“Let’s go! The car is ready!” Song Rui said.

“Ruofei, I won’t be going back with you guys,” Feng Jing said.”I’ll just take a flight back to Sanshan. I’ve been away for so many days, and there’s a lot of work to do at the company!”

“President Feng, we’re back in the country, so let’s take a rest!” Zhao Yongjun said. Let’s do our part as hosts. ”

Xia ruofei also said,”yeah!” Sister che, you must be tired from the long journey. You can rest in Beijing for the night. There’s no need to rush the company’s matters!”

After that, Xia ruofei pulled Feng Jing’s luggage and said,””Let’s go! Let’s go back to the courtyard house first!”

Feng Jing had no choice but to follow them. Of course, she was not that determined to go back, especially after Xia ruofei asked her to stay. It was even more difficult for her to refuse.

The group of people took three separate cars and returned to the big siheyuan in liuhai Lane.

Zhao Yongjun asked Wu Qiang, Hou Liang, and Wei Jun to go out and buy things together. They were prepared to have a gathering at siheyuan that night.

Feng Rao greeted everyone before finding a guest room to catch up on her sleep. The ten – hour flight had been quite tiring. Although first – Class was very comfortable, she definitely didn’t get as much sleep on the ground.
