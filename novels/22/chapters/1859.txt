Xia ruofei laughed and said,”sister Qian, isn’t this little money like a drizzle to the government?” You’re the magistrate of a County! You can’t be that timid, right?”

“I’m a coward, why do you care?” Wu Liqian showed a rare girlish side and said somewhat unreasonably.

Wu Liqian was usually serious at work, and the staff around her were very careful in front of her. But in fact, she was only in her early 30s and had not even been in a serious relationship. After tearing off her usual disguise, her mentality was sometimes similar to that of a girl in her 20s.

“Alright, alright, alright! It’s all my fault, okay?” Xia ruofei raised his hands and begged for mercy.

At this moment, the main dish of the night, the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup, was served.

Xia ruofei changed the topic and said,”sister Qian, come, come, come!” Let’s eat first, and we can talk about the investment ...”

“En!” Wu Liqian, who was in a good mood, said with a smile.

Very few people in the three mountains had never tried the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup. The famous Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup in the spring Gathering garden had become the representative of the high – end food in the three mountains. Of course, that was all in the past. Right now, the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ dish had the best reputation, and it was undoubtedly the Ling Ji private kitchen.

Wu Liqian had been working in the municipal Party Committee for many years and was even the leader’s Secretary. She had tried the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ in juchun garden many times, but this was the first time she had tried the signature ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ of Ling Ji private kitchen.

After opening the jar, the extremely rich fragrance was already enough to make Wu Liqian’s fingers move.

The waiter helped to scoop out the various genuine ingredients that had been boiled over slow fire for more than ten hours. Then, Wu Liqian couldn’t wait to blow on them while tasting them.

“Be careful, it’s hot ...” Xia ruofei said, amused.

“It tastes really good!” Wu Liqian said as she chewed,”no wonder it’s so expensive. You have to line up and make a reservation!” You really get what you pay for!”

Usually, Wu Liqian paid a lot of attention to her image, which was a compulsory course for leaders. However, in front of Xia ruofei, she could throw away all her pretense and be her true self.

After tasting the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’, Wu Liqian tried the noble rotted sweet wine that Xia ruofei had prepared. She was full of praise for the unique taste and sweetness.

After a while, Wu Liqian said,””Ruofei, I’m very supportive of your company’s investment plan! We will also do our best to get more preferential policies for you, including taxes, land, supporting facilities, and so on!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Sister Qian, you’ve said what I wanted to say ... That’s why I’m looking for you. We’ve done some research and have decided on a piece of land. It’s about three kilometers West of our farm, about 1000 mu! I hope that the Chang Ping District can grant us this land. Of course, it’s best if the price is favorable. At the very least, it’ll be sold at the standard of industrial land!”

Wu Liqian nodded and said,”it’s not a big problem to get the land. You took this land to build a pharmaceutical factory, so you can definitely transfer it as industrial land. As for the price discount on this basis, I will do my best to fight for you!”

Xia ruofei snapped his fingers and said,”Big sister Qian is bright!”

“Your company’s investment in a pharmaceutical factory will be a boost to the economy of the entire Changping County,” Wu Liqian said with a smile. “It can also provide hundreds of jobs. As the local government, it’s naturally our duty to protect the development of the company! Don’t you worry about that!”

Wu Liqian paused and continued,””In terms of tax, I will also strive for the greatest discount for you. The discount period is usually five years, and the first three years will be the biggest discount. For a big tax collector like the Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory, it is even possible that the company’s income tax and value added tax of the first three years” County – Level savings will be returned in full! In addition, there are also benefits such as corporate executives being exempted from personal income tax for three years ...”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”sister Qian, we only want the benefits that are allowed by the policy. To be honest, I can accept it as long as the benefits are not worse than other companies.” Of course, it’s best if you can get more benefits, provided that you don’t violate any principles or discipline. I still want to use this to contribute some political achievements to you! It would be bad if it backfired. ”

Wu Liqian’s heart warmed. She smiled and said,””Don’t worry! I can clearly distinguish between public and private matters, and I won’t joke around with my political future!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”that’s the best. I’m just giving you a reminder. Whether you give a discount or not, it’s a matter of adding flowers to a brocade. It’s best if you have it, but it’s not unacceptable if you don ‘t. The earlier our factory goes into production, the earlier we can generate profits. This is the main point!”

Wu Liqian smiled and said,”yeah!” For a money – sucking monster like the Paradise pharmaceutical factory, the faster the better. ”

Wu Liqian continued,”in addition to land and tax, the local government will also undertake the construction of some infrastructure, mainly the roads from the factory to the main road, as well as power transmission lines, water transmission network, and so on. Of course, this also requires enterprise funding. After all, these are all for your family!”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei nodded. Even if we don’t have these, we will still build what needs to be built. ”

The meeting between the two was a bit different. Under normal circumstances, it would definitely be companies trying to get as many preferential policies as possible, while the government needed to grasp a balance. They could not drive away the investors, but they could not damage the government’s interests too much.

However, Xia ruofei and Wu Liqian were different. Wu Liqian would not hide anything from Xia ruofei and would try her best to get the best preferential policies for Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei was not like other companies who were eager for profits. Instead, he would consider things from Wu Liqian’s perspective from time to time. He was too easy to talk to.

Of course, this was only a private meeting between the two of them. Wu Liqian couldn’t make the decision on her own.

After they finished discussing the factory, Xia ruofei also mentioned the expansion of the farm.

After Wu Liqian heard this, she pondered for a while and said,””Ruofei, I actually have a suggestion.”

“Go ahead, sister Qian.” Xia ruofei quickly said.

“Since the land you have your eyes on is connected and adjacent to the farm, I think you might as well use the name of paradise Corporation to buy the entire piece of land, including the current area of the farm.” Wu Liqian said,”although the initial investment will be more, the future development of the farm will not be limited by the lease agreement. Moreover, if we buy it in one go, we won’t have to pay rent in the future.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Can it be operated like this?” Xia ruofei asked cautiously.

“It’s not a big problem,” Wu Liqian explained with a smile,”it may involve more compensation and transfer funds. After all, some of the land on the farm now belongs to the village! However, there should be no problem if I meddle in the operations of the entire plate. ”

Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory was a highly sought – after project. As long as the party Committee and government leaders of Changping County weren’t stupid, they wouldn’t turn down such a good project.

To put it bluntly, the pharmaceutical factory’s branch factory could be invested anywhere. If Changping County wanted these projects, they naturally had to show their sincerity, including the preferential policies that Wu Liqian had mentioned earlier, as well as the land to meet the needs of the peach blossom company as much as possible.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and nodded.””Then let’s follow this plan!”

Wu Liqian nodded and said,”later, you can ask your people to make a more detailed investment plan and difficult requirements. Report it to me directly. Leave the rest to me.”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said happily,”sister Qian, you’re so awesome! We’re already negotiating for a bank loan, so there shouldn’t be any problems. As long as it’s settled in Changping County, the first phase of 500 million Yuan will be in place immediately!”
