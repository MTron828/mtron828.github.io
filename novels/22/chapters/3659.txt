“I’ll go!” Song Wei said,”you’ve been cultivating too hard these past few days. Furthermore, you have to accompany us in our joint cultivation … You should take a break!”

“I’m fine!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”cultivation requires a balance between work and rest. 1 cook to relax my mind. It’s good for cultivation!”

“Then … Alright!” Song Wei said.

“Why don’t we come over and help you?” Ling Qingxue said.

“Don’t!” Xia ruofei quickly waved his hand and said,”you guys stay here quietly. That’s the best help you can give me!”

Song Wei couldn’t help but burst into laughter. She pulled Ling Qingxue to the living room to watch TV.

Xia ruofei did it himself and quickly prepared a sumptuous dinner.

In two days, they would be going on a long journey again and there were too many uncertainties. Xia ruofei did not know if he would encounter any danger so he wanted to take advantage of the time when everyone was together to take care of his two female friends.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue also felt that tonight’s dinner was much more sumptuous than usual, so Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but ask,””Ruofei, why did you make so much delicious food today?”

“Isn’t it because you guys have been cultivating too hard, so I’m prepared to reward you?” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“No, there must be something wrong with you!” Ling Qingxue said,”a woman’s sixth sense is very accurate. Don’t try to hide it!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”I’ve almost never left my room for the past two months. We’ve been living together every day. What can 1 hide from you?”

“Qingxue, RUO Fei hasn’t been out for a long time. He’s been living right under our noses. Why would he hide anything from us?” Song Wei chuckled.

“Yup!” Xia ruofei said,”Qingxue, don’t think too much.”

“Are you really fine?” Ling Qingxue asked.

“Of course it’s true!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”actually, the reason why I made so many dishes today is to reward the two of you. On the other hand, I’m going out in two days. Since the two of you might have to cook by yourself, 1’11 let you enjoy it while I’m still on Peach Blossom Island.” “Oh …” Ling Qingxue reluctantly accepted Xia ruofei’s instructions and then asked casually,”where are we going this time?”

Xia ruofei replied nonchalantly,”I’m just going back to Huaxia to settle some matters. It’ll take a few days at the least. It’ll take at most half a month. 1 should be back!”

It was normal for Xia ruofei to leave the Peach Blossom Island and return to the secular world. After all, he had a company in Huaxia. He was not alone like those old – School cultivators. He had many relatives and friends in the secular world. It was normal for him to return to deal with some personal affairs.

Xia ruofei had said that he was going back to Huaxia on purpose so that Song Wei and Ling Qingxue would misunderstand and think that he had gone to deal with a private matter in the secular world. This way, they would not be too worried.

If the two of them knew that Xia ruofei was a guest at the first heaven society, they would inevitably be worried about his safety.

Besides, Xia ruofei was not lying. The headquarters of the first heaven society was also located in Huaxia.

In fact, most of the cultivation sects were located in Huaxia. There were not many overseas sects, and they were not very powerful.

As expected, Ling Qingxue and Song Wei didn’t ask too much about it. They didn’t think that Xia ruofei would be in any danger after leaving Paradise Island for Huaxia.

Hence, the two of them were happily feasting on the food. Since Xia ruofei had said that they would have to rely on themselves in two days, they naturally had to enjoy it now.

In the next two days, other than accompanying Ling Qingxue and Song Wei in their joint cultivation, Xia ruofei also locked himself in his room during the time that he had originally used to cultivate. However, he was not cultivating. Instead, he was making some preparations for the trip to the first heaven society.

Some backup plans might never be used, but once they were needed and he was not prepared, he might pay the price of his life.

He was about to face a Yuanying stage cultivator, so no matter how cautious he was, it was not too much.

Soon, it was the third day.

Xia ruofei woke up early in the morning. After bidding farewell to the people of Paradise Island, he left the island on his black – Phoenix flying boat and flew toward the Inland of Huaxia.

Xia ruofei’s departure this time was no different from any other time he returned to China. Hence, after Song Wei and Ling Qingxue saw him off in the flying boat, they did not have much to worry about and went straight back to their room to cultivate. “Of course it’s true!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”actually, the reason why I made so many dishes today is to reward the two of you. On the other hand, I’m going out in two days. Since the two of you might have to cook by yourself, I’ll let you enjoy it while I’m still on Peach Blossom Island.” “Oh …” Ling Qingxue reluctantly accepted Xia ruofei’s instructions and then asked casually,”where are we going this time?”
