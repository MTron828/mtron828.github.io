2504 New shareholders, new atmosphere (1)

The joy on Wu Lei’s face disappeared in an instant. He then hesitated and said,””There’s a saying on the internet that the jaded skin cream and heart – nourishing soup were both developed by President Xia. Some people say that President Xia’s Chinese medicine skills are very high. “However, there are also many people who have opposite opinions. After all, President Xia is so young ...”

In fact, the rumors on the internet were not groundless. After all, Xia ruofei had treated many people and many people knew about his medical skills. Although this kind of news was mostly spread among the upper – Class circle, it was inevitable that some people would spread it on the internet.

Zhou leiyun was on good terms with Zhao Yongjun. Although he didn’t know that Xia ruofei could cure cancer, he at least knew that Xia ruofei was highly skilled in Chinese medicine. He was also very sure that Xia ruofei was the main person who developed the heart – nourishing soup and the jaded skin ointment.

Therefore, after hearing Wu Lei’s words, Zhou leiyun laughed and said,””Wu Lei, I can tell you responsibly that President Xia’s Chinese medicine skills are very high. Since he said so, he must have a certain level of confidence. You can consider President Xia’s suggestion.”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”general manager Zhou, are you that confident in me?” What if I was just bragging? Wu Lei won’t be able to play this season. It’ll be a great loss for you and the club!”

“You’re also one of the club’s shareholders, aren’t you?”Zhou leiyun shrugged. I’m not the only one who lost it!”

Wu Lei could not help but be speechless. In fact, after listening to Zhou leiyun’s words, he was already tempted. After all, he had only missed one round of the league tournament in a week. After the league tournament ended, he still had at least seven or eight chances. Moreover, if he could completely solve the problem of his shoulder joint injury, it would be good for his form.

After all, even though he could play football now, he was always worried about hurting his shoulder joint again. There would be a certain psychological shadow, and it was naturally impossible to fully play his technical movements.

However, the moment Zhou leiyun finished speaking, he immediately started to joke with Xia ruofei.

For the two big bosses, this loss was nothing, but it was different for him!

...

He was already 27 years old this year, and every game he played was precious to him. If he could not play this season, he would have to wait until the new league season in September to start playing.

In this case, Wu Lei was more inclined to go for surgery at the end of the season.

Xia ruofei saw Wu Lei’s conflicted expression and smiled.””Wu Lei, since I made this suggestion, of course I have some confidence. I’m also a shareholder of the club. I can’t sacrifice the interests of the players for no reason, right? Besides, you’re already a benchmark for Chinese football! Your influence is very important to the club. I won’t joke about this kind of thing. ”

At this point, Xia ruofei paused and continued,””Of course, the final decision is still up to you.”

Wu Lei nodded gratefully and said,””I understand. I will consider it seriously. Thank you, director Xia! I ... I still need to discuss it with my family, so I can’t give you an answer immediately ...”

“I understand!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”come, come, come! Drink another one!”

After that, they did not talk about any more sad things. They ate and chatted. In a foreign country, there was a special sense of intimacy between fellow countrymen. Although Xia ruofei and Zhou leiyun were Wu Lei’s bosses, they did not put on any airs. Wu Lei gradually let go of his reservations and the atmosphere became more and more harmonious.

After dinner, Zhou leiyun made an appointment with Xia ruofei to go to the Spanish club the next day to handle the relevant documents for the transfer of shares. Then, he bid farewell and went back to convince Xia ruofei to buy a Manor in Barcelona. He could stay there for about a month in a year.

Xia ruofei and Wu Lei went back to their rooms to rest.

After Xia ruofei returned to his room, he took a shower in the bathroom. After changing into a loose bathrobe, he sat on the sofa in the living room and turned on his phone. He asked about everyone’s situation in the WeChat group.

After all, this was a foreign country and he was unfamiliar with the people and place. Since he had brought these employees out, he had to be responsible for them.

...

Dong Yun replied to Xia ruofei in the group. She was still out with her employees. The nightlife in Barcelona was very rich. To the young girls and boys, everything here was very fresh.

Xia ruofei didn’t ask for too much. He just reminded everyone to be careful.

Under normal circumstances, there would not be any problems with the company of Zhou leiyun’s men. Although the security in Europe was not as good as in China, it was still pretty good in Barcelona.

……

The next day, Xia ruofei and his staff split into two groups.

Zhou leiyun sent two subordinates who were familiar with the situation in Barcelona to accompany Dong Yun and the rest on a trip, while Xia ruofei went to Espanyol.

It just so happened that Wu Lei also had to go for training, so the two of them left the hotel in the business car sent by the club.

The hotel wasn’t too far from the club’s training base. It was about seven or eight kilometers away, a ten – minute drive.

Soon, Xia ruofei could see the blue outer wall of the Espanyol club training base from afar. The wall was inlaid with a huge white team emblem and the words “real Espanyol Football Club” in Spanish.

Wu Lei was sitting beside Xia ruofei. He introduced,””Director Xia, this training base is called Dani Halk base. It’s named in memory of the Spanish legendary Captain, Dani Halk, who passed away in 2009.”
