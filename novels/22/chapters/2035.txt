2036 The aftermath (2)

Whether it was gold coins or antiques, they definitely could not be sold through normal auction channels. If they went to the black market, the price would be discounted. In addition, there would definitely be losses in the process of whitewashing such a large amount of money.

According to Li Yifu’s plan, no matter how much these things were actually worth, he would transfer all of them to Xia ruofei and he would pay for the loss. This way, the Hong sect would not lose any money.

Hearing that, lui hai hurriedly said,”understood!” Don’t worry, uncle Yi, we’ll take care of it!”

With Li Yifu’s words, this hot potato finally had a place to go. Although it would be troublesome to evaluate the price and find a safe channel to sell it, the Hong sect had been in Europe and the United States for so many years. It was still possible to do this.

Li Yifu told lui hai to keep it a secret from Xia ruofei and then hung up the phone.

Lui hai put away his phone and said to Lu zhengfeng,””Uncle Yi has spoken. He wants us to evaluate the price first, then apply for funds from the higher – ups and send it directly to Mr. Xia. What we need to do now is to figure out the value of this batch of property, and then find a suitable channel to exchange them for money. Uncle Yi will take care of the rest!”

Lu zhengfeng also heaved a sigh of relief and said,””That’s much easier!”

……

Xia ruofei didn’t know the result of the discussion between Li Yifu and lui hai. After he returned to his room, he put the small gray box into the spirit map space. The White realm Fox was still confined in a small space by him. Naturally, he didn’t need to worry that the little guy would take away the precious realm stones.

Of course, he was also rather wary of the realm Fox’s spatial talent, so he still instructed Xia Qing to inform him as soon as the little fellow showed any signs of escaping, so as not to let it waste these realm stones.

Although Xia ruofei wanted to let the spirit map space absorb the world stones directly, this was a foreign land after all. Moreover, with so many world stones absorbed, the space would probably level up again. It would be bad if there were any strange phenomena, so he decided to let the space absorb them when he returned home.

After keeping the world stones, Xia ruofei went to take a shower and went to bed.

Although he had killed a few people that night, it did not affect his sleep. He still slept all the way until dawn.

When he woke up, Xia ruofei was also thinking about it. He did not know if it was because of the improvement in his cultivation that his respect for life seemed to have decreased a lot. He still remembered the first time he went on an actual combat mission. After he had personally killed a drug dealer, he could not eat for a week. Every time he closed his eyes, he would see the bullet hole in the drug dealer’s forehead that was bleeding ...

Although he had killed the core members of the Mafia last night, and every one of them deserved to die, he did not have any psychological trauma at all. This made Xia ruofei a little uncomfortable.

Just as he was sitting on the bench under the eaves in the backyard, staring at the light rain in the garden in a daze, a sweet voice came from behind him.

“Mr. Xia! What are you thinking about?”

Xia ruofei turned around and realized that Monica was already behind him.

Monica was wearing a long black down jacket, and her hot figure was wrapped in the down jacket. She was less sexy and attractive, but more cute.

Looking at Monica’s relaxed smile, Xia ruofei felt that his hard work these few days had not been in vain. This trip to Italy was not in vain.

He stood up with a smile and said,”I’m not thinking about anything. I’m just in a daze!” Monica, did you sleep well last night?”

“Of course! This is the most peaceful sleep I’ve had in the past few months!” Monica looked into Xia ruofei’s eyes and said sincerely,”Xia, thank you!”

Xia ruofei smiled and made room for Monica to sit down.

The two of them sat side by side on a bench facing the garden.

“Monica, do you have any plans for the future?” Xia ruofei asked.

Monica’s face revealed a trace of astonishment as she said,””I don’t know ... I grew up in Turin, and I have many good memories. However ... This city has also left me with many bad memories ...”

“The Gelman family is history,” Xia ruofei said.”If you’re willing to stay in Turin, no one will cause you any trouble!”

“I know ...” Monica said.”I think I need to think about it and ask Rousey for his opinion ... Xia, can we stay for a few more days?”

Xia ruofei shrugged.”Of course! You can stay as long as you want!”

“Thank you!” Monica stood up and said,”I’m going to see Rousey. There are no nurses here. I have to take care of him!”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat.””Have you done a detailed examination of Rousey’s condition? Is there any possibility of recovery?”

“I’ve seen a lot of doctors over the years. This is the after – effect of severe polio, which can only be improved through rehabilitation training. The possibility of a complete recovery is very low!” Monica said sadly.

Then, she quickly smiled and said,””But Rossi is a very optimistic young man, and he’s quite smart! Although he needs the help of a wheelchair, he can still take care of himself in most situations!”

“I can tell!” Xia ruofei nodded.

“Then I’ll head over first, goodbye!” Monica said.

“Goodbye!”

After Monica left, Xia ruofei said without looking back,””Ah hai, come out! What are you hiding there for?”

Xia ruofei had already noticed that lui hai was hiding behind them, but Monica was here just now, so he pretended not to know.

Lui hai walked out from the corner with embarrassment,””Mr. Xia, I saw that you were talking to miss Grasso and was afraid to disturb you ...”

“Is there something you need?” Xia ruofei asked.

“It’s like this. That Carlos woke up in the hospital. He wants to see miss Grasso. We can’t make the decision, so we have to ask you ...” Lui hai said.

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment before he remembered who exactly karlas was.

“This old man isn’t dead yet?” he asked, raising his eyebrows.

Lui hai smiled embarrassedly,”after all, he’s a victim of the Geerman family!” That’s why when our brothers from the Hong sect left, they took him to the hospital for the sake of humanity ...”

Speaking of which, he had to thank old Gehrman for beating him up so badly that the brothers from the Hong sect would take him down the mountain and help him inform the Grasso family to send him to the hospital. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

If he had really been imprisoned somewhere in the manor, he would have died in the explosion last night.

“This old man is quite lucky!” Xia ruofei said,”he wants to see Monica? What are they trying to do?”

“Yes,” lui hai said,”he said that he hoped miss Grasso could take over the family. He’s willing to give up his position as the family head and assist her with all his might!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said with a smile,””This old man is quite smart!”

Obviously, he knew that the Gelman family was finished, and the underground Kings of Turin would be the Chinese from last night.

Monica was clearly very close to this Chinese mafia group.

If he didn’t say anything, Monica would have every reason to take revenge on him and the entire Grao family based on the various suppression and restrictions he had placed on Monica and her brother in the past.

A pure business family like them could easily crush the Gelman family, let alone this Chinese organization that was even more terrifying than the Gelman family.

Therefore, it was wise for him to give up the position of The Family Leader to Monica. Maybe he could get her forgiveness. Under Monica’s leadership, with the support of the Chinese, the family would be able to do well in Turin, and their business would grow.

It had to be said that this old man had a good plan!
