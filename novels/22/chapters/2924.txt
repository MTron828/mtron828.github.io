2925 Cleaning up the house (1)

As the person in charge of the Bay group’s region, Manino was not a good – for – nothing either. He quickly controlled his emotions and said calmly,””ERAD, stop all operations for now. This matter is rather complicated!”

Manino knew ERAD too well. Once this dangerous guy got angry, he would not recognize his family. If Manino were to severely reprimand him at this time, he might lose his mind and destroy Huafeng shipping company first.

If such a thing really happened, then Manino could forget about being the person in charge of the region.

Therefore, what he had to do now was not to condemn them, but to stabilize ERAD first.

After hearing this, ERAD said in confusion,””Mr. Manino! This company is looking down on the authority of the Bay group. If we don’t punish them severely, who will respect us in the future?”

The most common tactic used by the Bay group in the past was to deal a heavy blow to their opponents and those who had offended them. The greater significance of this was to deter others and make those who wanted to go against the Bay group in the future think twice.

From this perspective, there was no problem with what ERAD did today.

“ERAD, I didn’t say we’re not taking any action,” Manino said with a pleasant expression.”I just asked you to stop for a while. Things are a little complicated, and I can’t explain it in a few words.”

“But ... If we delay any further, they might all run away!” ERAD argued.

“Then we’ll monitor and follow them first!” Manino said impatiently,”in short, without my authorization, you are not allowed to take any action! ERAD, this matter is very important. I have to remind you that this is an order from the Feyer Manor. You just have to follow it unconditionally!”

Feyer Manor was the favorite Vacation Manor of the head of the bay group, Goodman. He spent most of his time there, and the middle and senior members of the Bay group were all familiar with the place. Many of them had been to the luxurious Manor on the Caribbean.

ERAD’s heart trembled when he heard this. He would at least dare to explain or argue when he felt that the orders of his immediate superior, smanino, were inappropriate. However, he did not dare to question Goodman’s orders at all. Even if he knew it was wrong, he did not have the courage to resist.

In the eyes of the middle – Level leaders of the Bay group like ERAD, Goodman was like a god.

“Understood!” ERAD quickly said,”Mr. Manino, I’ll call a halt to the operation immediately!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Mm! Stay in kuachakuros and wait for my next order!” Manino said,”remember, without my permission, you are not allowed to do anything to the Chinese! This is what Mr. Goodman personally ordered!”

“Alright! Mr. Manino!” ERAD said, somewhat dejected.

However, he didn’t have the guts to go against Goodman’s will. After hanging up, he immediately called Madeline and reluctantly called off the emergency operation.

However, ERAD was definitely not willing to let the Chinese go just like that. He also ordered Madeline to monitor the outside and try not to alert the Chinese people inside.

ERAD did not know that Zhang Chao was very decisive. After they were chased away by Xia ruofei, they left Huafeng shipping company without any hesitation. Even if Manino didn’t call to stop them in time, they wouldn’t be able to hurt the Chinese employees of Huafeng shipping. At most, they would raze the buildings there to the ground.

What ERAD didn’t expect even more was that his superior, Simino, gritted his teeth and cursed after hanging up the phone. Then, he immediately picked up the phone and mobilized his troops. In an instant, all the armed personnel in several cities near kuachakuros were mobilized. It only took 30 to 40 minutes to drive from ishwatlan, which was the closest to kuachakuros.

At the same time, Manino took a helicopter and rushed to kuachakuros. At the same time, he called to report to Goodman, who was waiting anxiously at Feyer Manor.

After Manino and ERAD finished their call, they basically figured out what had happened. There was no doubt that ERAD was the one who started it.

After listening to Manino’s report, Goodman was silent for a few seconds. Then he gritted his teeth and said,””ERAD can’t be kept! You go and execute it personally! The entire process had to be photographed and recorded! I have to give them an explanation!”

Manino didn’t know what kind of pressure Goodman was under to the point that he wanted to clean up his own family. Although there was still a gap between ERAD and Goodman, Goodman had always admired ERAD. This guy was ruthless and didn’t recognize anyone. He could be said to be the most fearsome subordinate of the Bay group.

Getting rid of ERAD was also a big loss for Goodman.

However, Goodman only needed a few seconds to think before making a decision. This meant that he was under a lot of pressure and didn’t have time to think.

This was just Manino’s basic judgment. He was not stupid enough to ask Goodman.

At a time like this, feigning ignorance was the best choice. To Manino, all he had to do was to carry out the orders.

Furthermore, while Goodman admired ERAD, Manino didn’t like ERAD.

The reason was simple. ERAD was too domineering. He relied on the contributions he had made to the group over the years. Sometimes, he would obey Manino’s orders on the surface but disobey them on the inside. Although he still respected Manino on the surface, he was actually doing things his own way, which made Manino very unhappy.

If not for this incident, ERAD would have been promoted to the person in charge of the region in the next few years. By then, he would be on the same level as Manino. Moreover, ERAD dared to fight and kill. Once he became one of the people in charge of the region, he would definitely pose a threat to Manino’s position.

It was even possible that Manino would be forced to move away from the Northeast region, which was the most lucrative area, in order to move Elard.

Therefore, when Goodman made the decision to get rid of ERAD, Manino was secretly happy.

“Alright, Mr. Goodman!” He quickly replied. I’m already on the plane to kuachakuros! On the phone, I was worried that he would do something desperate and pose a threat to the safety of the Chinese people, so I stabilized him first! The armed forces I’ve mobilized from a few cities near kuachaquarkos are also rushing there! Don’t worry! When I get there, I’ll catch him off guard and take him down! And I’ll personally execute it!”

“Let’s do this!” Goodman said,”you have to end the battle quickly and give me feedback as soon as possible! There’s an honorable Sir waiting for my reply!”
