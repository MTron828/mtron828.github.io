3044 Returning to peach source Island (2)

Translator: 5496903“Everything is normal. Don’t worry!” Li Yifu quickly said,”the few days that you were not on the island, it was calm outside. No cultivators spied on us or barged into the Taixu xuanqing formation! I’m guessing that the cultivation world hasn’t noticed this cultivation paradise yet. ”

“That’s good! I don’t want everyone to know about this. It’s best for us to develop our strength in a low – Profile manner!” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”of course, if a cultivation sect or force finds Paradise Island and covets our precious cultivation land, we won’t be afraid!”

Through this auction, Xia ruofei had a better understanding of the forces in the cultivation world.

It could be said that in the current cultivation world, there were still people who had a higher cultivation than Xia ruofei. Many of the sect leaders and elders of the top sects and even first – Class sects had reached the intermediate or even advanced stage of the Golden core realm.

However, not many people could defeat Xia ruofei even if they had all their trump cards.

If they were just defending, Xia ruofei would not be afraid of anyone, especially with the Taixu xuanqing formation on the Peach Blossom Island.

Even outside, if Xia ruofei could not defeat them, he could escape. He could hide in the spirit map space and escape with the black flying boat while the enemy was unprepared. With the speed of the black flying boat, most of the Aurous core stage cultivators would not be able to catch up even if they were to ride their flying swords at full speed.

After Li Yifu heard Xia ruofei’s words, he couldn’t help but feel a sense of pride. He nodded heavily and said,””With senior granduncle here, this disciple has a backbone!”

Then, Li Yifu added,”by the way, great uncle – Master, the staff members for the recruitment of disciples have arrived one after another. However, because they haven’t been screened by you yet, I haven’t let these people who arrived later come into contact with work for the time being. They’re all living together.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”is everyone here?”

“Yes, I am!” Li Yifu said,”these people are enough to ensure the normal operation of the Peach Blossom Island, and they can also get enough rest.”

“Mm! Then let’s screen all the newcomers today. ” Xia ruofei said,”Oh right, how are the guards?”

“Everything is normal!” Li Yifu said,”they have already taken on the tasks of guarding, patrolling, and guarding the dock. Also, the guards have recently organized several live ammunition training sessions, so the ammunition consumption is relatively fast. They applied to me once, but I didn’t bother you with such a small matter and directly approved it for them!”

Xia ruofei nodded approvingly and said,”Well done!”

Then, Xia ruofei took out a piece of paper from the spirit map space and handed it to Li Yifu.””There should still be a lot of materials left from the activation of the formation last time! Can you see if you can gather all the items on this list? If you can ‘t, go buy them as soon as possible!”

“Yes!” Li Yifu said. Then, he asked curiously,”what’s this about, grand uncle – Master?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Recently, I’ve made some progress in the field of arrays. I feel that there’s still a lot of potential to be discovered in the Taixu xuanqing array of our Peach Blossom Island. So, I’ve thought of a transformation plan and am preparing to upgrade our current array!”

Xia ruofei knew the structure of the Taixu xuanqing formation by heart, so he didn’t need to wait until he returned to the Peach Blossom Island to start drawing up the plan.

In fact, when he was modifying the star evolutionary formation of the star Seizer sect, he often had some inspiration for modifying the Taixu xuanqing formation. At that time, he had casually recorded them down, and then used some of his spare time in the star Seizer sect to come up with a plan to modify the Taixu xuanqing formation.

In fact, it was much easier to draw up this plan than to modify the stellar evolution formation.

After all, the stellar evolution formation was designed and set up by someone else. No matter how well he understood the principle and structure of the stellar evolution formation, it could not be compared to the Taixu xuanqing formation. After all, the Taixu xuanqing formation was set and activated by Xia ruofei himself. Every part of the design and every thought was his own.

Li Yifu’s spirit was lifted when he heard this, and he quickly said,””Yes! This disciple will go and check the materials!”

Xia ruofei stopped Li Yifu with a smile and said,””Don’t rush! You go and organize all the new employees to come to the Yanhuang building for the last round of interviews. I’ll do the screening here, and you go prepare the materials. This won’t delay either side, right?”

“Yes, yes, yes!” Li Yifu quickly said,”great uncle – Master, can we go to the meeting room on the third floor?”

“Sure, I’ll go down now!” Xia ruofei said.

Li Yifu immediately started contacting people and asked them to organize the new employees to come to the Yanhuang building for interviews. He specifically asked benilatti to be in charge of the staff organization and on – site management. Then, he went to the warehouse and found all the materials according to the list provided by Xia ruofei.

These new employees were all ordinary people and were easier to hypnotize than the star Seizer sect’s disciples. Xia ruofei’s screening speed was extremely fast. By the time Li Yifu had gathered the materials, he had already screened through everyone.

These people were recruited by Li Yifu through his company in the United States and the Hong sect. They had gone through several rounds of screening before coming to the island, so they were very reliable.

Xia ruofei checked each and every one of them. No one had sneaked in with an ulterior motive.

Of course, there were different levels of loyalty. Some people came to work purely for the high salary. This was human nature. Xia ruofei naturally did not think that these people were unreliable.

He told the results of the screening to Li Yifu and asked him to arrange for everyone to start their respective positions today. This would also greatly relieve the pressure on the staff on the island in the early stages.

Then, Xia ruofei brought Li Yifu along and started to modify the formation without stopping.

This kind of modification was mainly minor adjustments. Moreover, he had the experience of modifying the star evolution formation, so it was naturally easier for him to modify the Taixu xuanqing formation that he was more familiar with.

After a day or so, Xia ruofei had successfully made a “small upgrade” to the Taixu xuanqing formation.

After restarting the formation, Xia ruofei carefully checked all the functions to make sure that there were no problems. At the same time, he could clearly feel that the effect of the formation had increased by a lot.

He heaved a sigh of relief.

Although he was full of confidence before the modification, it was still a theoretical thing after all. It could only be considered a true success after being tested in practice.

Li Yifu could also feel that the spiritual Qi on the island, which was already saturated, was slowly increasing again. He was both surprised and happy, and his admiration for Xia ruofei could not be any greater.

Li Yifu even suggested that the kitchen prepare a few more dishes today to celebrate.

However, after testing the array, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Yifu, this time the adjustment range isn’t big, and the operation of the formation plate in your hand hasn’t changed much, so there’s no need to learn anything else. “I still have some matters to attend to, so I’ll be leaving Peach Blossom Island for a few days. During this time, you’ll be in charge of Peach Blossom Island. No matter what happens, ensuring the safety of Peach Blossom Island and the safety of the people on the island is your first priority. When you encounter a powerful enemy that you can’t resist, you must not hesitate to turn the defense level of the Taixu xuanqing formation to the maximum, and then inform me at once!”

Li Yifu was stunned when he heard that. He looked at Xia ruofei and asked,””Senior granduncle, you’ve only been back for a day and you’re leaving again?”

“I won’t be gone for long this time.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I have something to deal with!”

Then, Xia ruofei said,”now that I have a flying spiritual treasure, it’s much more convenient to travel. If anything happens here, I can come back very quickly.” There’s no problem with you controlling the formation, so you don’t have to worry so much. In short, if a strong enemy invades, you just have to directly maximize the protection of the formation! They won’t be able to break in for a while!”
