Chapter 1044: Chapter 665 – hands – off shopkeeper, who’s the strongest? 1

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei did not expect MA Xiong to come to the hotel to welcome him personally. It was beyond his expectations.

MA Xiong had a very high status in Hong Kong. Needless to say, his assets were worth tens of billions. He was one of the top ten richest people in Hong Kong all year round. He also had many titles such as the director of the Hong Kong horse race, Sir Angela, and so on. There were probably no more than ten people who had the same social status as him in Hong Kong.

Although Xia ruofei had saved MA Xiong’s life, he was still a little flattered by such a high standard of treatment.

Hence, Xia ruofei opened the door and stepped out before the car even came to a complete stop. He then walked quickly to MA Xiong.

He said,”old Mr MA, how can I let you come and welcome me personally?” This is really too much for this junior!”

MA Xiong laughed and said,”Xia Sheng is a benefactor of the MA family! You’re worthy, you’re worthy ...”

Some of the hotel’s top executives, who were being cautious, couldn’t help but be secretly speechless when they saw this scene.

When MA Xiong personally came to the hotel to welcome the guest, they were already secretly guessing how distinguished the guest had to be for MA Xiong to treat him so seriously.

When they saw the young Xia ruofei, their eyes almost popped out of their sockets. They thought that the person MA Xiong welcomed so seriously must be a super – rich man or a Big Shot in the political and business world. They did not expect it to be an ordinary – looking young man.

Xia ruofei and MA Xiong were speaking in Mandarin, so the Hengfeng hotel’s senior management couldn’t help but Mutter in their hearts,”Could he be the son of some famous rich family in the mainland? Even so, Chairman MA shouldn’t have placed so much importance on it, right?

With MA Xiong’s status and special position in Hong Kong, he could directly talk to the political Giants in the mainland. Even if he was the young master of the Hong family, MA Xiong didn’t have to welcome him personally, right?

The hotel management who attended to the guests were all guessing. Meanwhile, MA Xiong had already exchanged a few words with Xia ruofei before he turned to look at Feng Jing.

“Xiasheng, this must be President Feng from your company, right?” MA Xiong said with a smile. He was really young and promising! I heard from Jiajun that they’ve been very happy working with boss Feng!”

Feng Jing was a little nervous in front of this legendary rich man. She quickly went up and greeted him,””Good day, old Mr. MA!”

“Good, good, good!” MA Xiong didn’t put on any airs as he asked with a smile,”is everything going well with the preparations for the auction? If your company has any requests, just tell Jiajun, he’ll do his best to cooperate!”

“Alright, thank you, old Mr. MA.” Feng ke said.

Only then did Feng Rao realize how close Xia ruofei and MA Xiong were.

She had been in Hong Kong for four or five days and had been feeling a little strange. On the one hand, the reception was very warm, and on the other hand, there was almost no resistance in her work. Whenever she asked for improvements, the Hengfeng auction house would try their best to satisfy her. If they couldn’t do it, Dong Jiajun would personally explain it to her patiently.

Feng Jing’s plans for the auction had all been realized, and it was so smooth that she found it hard to believe.

Originally, Feng Jing was prepared for difficulties. After all, the Hengfeng group was a giant Financial Group, and the Hengfeng auction house was also a well – known auction house in the industry. As for the Paradise Corporation, it was only a small company with a small reputation for the time being.

In such an unequal cooperation, the weaker party would definitely be at a disadvantage. Some reasonable requests might not even be met. Not to mention, Feng Jing wanted to use this auction as an opportunity to promote paradise Corporation as much as possible, so she was already prepared for a tug – of – War.

However, all the preparations she had made were almost useless.

Today, Hengfeng group’s general manager Ma Zhiming had personally gone to pick them up, and a legendary figure like Chairman MA Xiong had also personally come to the hotel to welcome them. Moreover, both parties were so familiar with each other. Feng Jing suddenly realized. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

She remembered that Xia ruofei had strongly dissuaded her from coming to Hong Kong a few days ago to coordinate the auction.

Only now did Feng Jing realize that Xia ruofei didn’t think there was a need to coordinate at all. He just didn’t want to dampen her enthusiasm so he didn’t say it.

Feng Jing couldn’t help but sneak a glance at Xia ruofei.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei did not notice her. He was still smiling as he spoke to MA Xiong.

The group of people exchanged a few words at the entrance of the hotel and began to walk in.

The precious one – headed abalone had already been placed back into the thermal container. A burly Man in Black followed Xia ruofei with the thermal container in his hand.

MA Xiong chuckled.”Xia Sheng, I’ll still arrange for you to stay in the Presidential Suite on the top floor. If you need anything else during your stay, just let Yu Hao know. He’s the General Manager of this hotel.”

A middle – aged man in a suit and leather shoes beside MA Xiong quickly bowed to Xia ruofei and handed him a business card with both hands. He said respectfully,””Xia Sheng, please give me your guidance!”

Xia ruofei took the name card with a smile and said,”Then I’ll have to trouble President Yu for the next two days!”

“I don’t dare! He didn’t dare! “You’re welcome ...”Yu Hao quickly said.

MA Xiong and Ma Zhiming personally accompanied Xia ruofei and Feng Jing to the Presidential Suite’s special elevator to the top floor.

When they arrived at the huge, luxurious living room, MA Xiong couldn’t wait to see the top – grade one – headed abalones that were going to be auctioned.
