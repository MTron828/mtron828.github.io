Chapter 196: A sudden attack (part two)_1

“Looking at the fish again?” Ling Qingxue didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. Can’t you be serious?” “What do you mean by no serious business?” Ling Xiaotian said in all seriousness,”I’m so busy with work all day long. I don’t have any other hobbies except for Arowana. I’ll look at them occasionally to relax my nervous nerves so that I can have a better job!” Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”as expected of the chairman!” You can even say that you’re absent – minded during work hours in such a fresh and refined way ...” This pair of father and daughter, one was obsessed with Arowana, while the other was crazy about meat. It really lived up to the saying that if Wanwan wasn’t a family, she wouldn’t be married into the same family. Ling Xiaotian laughed and scolded,”you little girl, how can you say that?” Your father only has this one hobby, and you still have the heart to limit me? Look at those big bosses, which one of them doesn’t have a loose relationship and change their mistresses every other day? Did I?” Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”you can also find a companion!” I have no objections. ” Ling Qingxue’s mother had passed away from an illness a long time ago, and Ling Xiaotian had been single all these years. “Why are you talking about this again?” Ling Xiaotian was a little embarrassed.”I’ve been busy all day long. Where would I find the time and energy?” “You’re not that busy, are you? “You still have time to browse the Dragon Peak forum ...” Ling Qingxue said with a smile. “You ... I’m too lazy to tell you! “You don’t understand ...” Ling Xiaotian was at a loss for words. He said,”elder li called me today and said that he saw a pair of top quality blood red Dragons on Dragon Peak. They were going crazy on the internet, so I clicked on it to take a look ...” Ling Xiaotian pointed at the computer screen and said,””The result really shocked me! Qingxue, look at this pair of blood – Red Dragons ... This hair color, this body! Also ... Everyone has deduced that these blood red Dragons are at least 85 centimeters long. Do you know what this means?” “Stop, stop!” Ling Qingxue quickly said,”I don’t know anything about all these things you’re saying. You should keep it for yourself ... Eh?” Ling Qingxue’s eyes fell on the photo on the screen and she couldn’t help but be stunned. “What’s wrong?” Ling Xiaotian asked. “Oh ... It’s nothing ...” Ling Qingxue said. However, her eyes never left the screen. The more Ling Qingxue looked at the photos, the more familiar she felt the furnishings in the photos were. In particular, there was a photo that took half of the television background wall. The patterns on the background wall, the style of the television cabinet, and the pot of devil’s ivy on the cabinet ... Isn’t this ... RUO Fei’s house? Ling Xiaotian was not very familiar with the furnishings in Xia ruofei’s house, but Ling Qingxue could remember them clearly. There was a huge commotion in her heart. Did this pair of blood red Dragons belong to RUO Fei’s family? Then ... Ling Qingxue’s eyes fell on the photo with Lin Qiao. Ling Xiaotian was pointing at the photo and said,””Qingxue, look at this one ... By comparing it to this little girl, it’s easy to estimate the length of the blood Dragons ...” Ling Qingxue didn’t hear a single word. She just stared at the screen in a daze. Ling Xiaotian spoke excitedly for a long time, but he did not hear his daughter’s response. He turned around and looked at her strangely. When he saw Ling Qingxue’s stunned expression, he couldn’t help but ask,””Qingxue ... Qingxue ...” “Ah?” “What’s wrong with you?” “I ... I’m fine!” “You’re really fine?” “I’m really fine. What could be wrong with me?” Ling Qingxue squeezed out a smile. Then, she took a deep breath and said as if nothing had happened,””Dad, if you’re not leaving, I’ll go first? I’m so hungry ...” “You go first!” Ling Xiaotian said,”I will leave later!” Ling Qingxue nodded and walked out of the office. “Qingxue, are you really alright?” Ling Xiaotian asked as he lifted his head. Although he was obsessed with the top blood red Dragons, he still noticed that something was wrong with his daughter. “I already said I’m fine!” Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”Oh right, I have something to do in the afternoon. I won’t be going back to the company after I eat ...” “Alright, you’ve been exhausted these past few days. Go home early and rest after you’re done. Don’t come to the company.” Ling Xiaotian nodded and said. “Mm! Dad, I’ll be leaving then ...” …… Taoyuan farm, a small villa. Xia ruofei was playing with lightning in the yard after lunch. Lin Qiao, who used to be disdainful of ornamental fish, was still in the living room watching the fish. Out of the four of them, she loved the pair of Blood Dragons the most. Whenever she had time, she would stand in front of the fish tank and watch it for a long time. Just then, Xia ruofei heard the sound of a car engine. Everyone had been at home these few days, so Xia ruofei had instructed ye Lingyun not to lock the farm’s Gate during the day. Soon, an orange Porsche 911 appeared in Xia ruofei’s sight. He was stunned for a moment. He was all too familiar with this car. Wasn’t this Ling Qingxue’s car? While Xia ruofei was still in a daze, Ling Qingxue had already opened the car door and alighted. Ling Qingxue had obviously put in a lot of effort in her dressing up today. She had light makeup on her face, a pair of tight – fitting black jeans, and long brown calfskin boots, which made her long legs look even more attractive. She was wearing a long beige trench coat and a black and white shirt with wavy dots. She also had an orange scarf on her head, which formed a beautiful scenery in winter. Ling Qingxue first put her hands in the pockets of her trench coat and tilted her head slightly to look at Xia ruofei. Then, she took off her sunglasses and revealed a half – Smile. Xia ruofei asked,”Qingxue?” Why didn’t you call me before you came?” “I have some free time in the afternoon, so I came over!” Ling Qingxue smiled.”What’s wrong? Do I need to make an appointment to see you now, boss Xia?” “That’s not it! “I’m just a little surprised ...” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”come in and sit!” With that, Xia ruofei led Ling Qingxue into the villa. Ling Qingxue came up and naturally held Xia ruofei’s arm. Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, then turned to look at Ling Qingxue. Ling Qingxue smiled sweetly at Xia ruofei and said,””Let’s go!” “Oh ... Okay!” Xia ruofei said. He felt that Ling Qingxue was not quite right today, but he could not put his finger on what was wrong. Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue walked into the villa. Lin Qiao heard Xia ruofei’s footsteps and said happily,””Brother ruofei! I just saw them eating the small fish, their speed is really good ... Huh?” Lin Qiao turned around and saw Ling Qingxue holding Xia ruofei’s arm. She was stunned. After entering the house, Xia ruofei wanted to separate from Ling Qingxue without leaving a trace. After all, his relationship with Ling Qingxue was not confirmed yet. In front of Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao, Xia ruofei would definitely feel a little embarrassed. However, when he tried to break free, Ling Qingxue’s grip on his arm tightened. She leaned her entire body against Xia ruofei’s and her beautiful face gently leaned on his shoulder. Ling Qingxue didn’t seem to notice that there was another person in the room until Lin Qiao spoke. She raised her head slightly and smiled sweetly at Xia ruofei.””RUO Fei, who is this?” [PS] announcing the VIP Reader group number: 295848872, genuine readers are welcome to join the group (after joining the group, you need to verify the screenshot of the full subscription).Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎
