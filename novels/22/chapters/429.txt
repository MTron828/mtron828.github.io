Chapter 430: Chapter 375 – in jail again (2)

This made Qin Xiao Yu even more worried. She could vaguely feel that it was not that Xia ruofei’s file was incomplete, but that she did not have enough authority to see it.

Her superb skills and mysterious military service experience had made Qin Xiao Yu quite vigilant and her heart was hanging on the edge along the way.

So when she saw Xia ruofei sleeping soundly, Qin Xiao Yu was also furious. She motioned for the police officer beside Xia ruofei to get out of the car, then bent down and shouted,””Hey! Get up!”

Xia ruofei smacked his lips, adjusted his position, and continued to sleep.

Qin Xiao Yu was so angry that she pushed Xia ruofei and shouted,””Quickly get up!”

She had never seen such a big – hearted criminal suspect. He was already caught in the police car and could still sleep. He even slept the entire way to the police station and refused to wake up. This was really weird.

Qin Xiao Yu called out a few times before Xia ruofei woke up in a daze.

“Get out of the car!” Qin Xiao Yu said coldly.

Xia ruofei shrugged his shoulders and slowly got out of the car.

Qin Xiao Yu and the two police officers brought Xia ruofei into an interrogation room that was already prepared.

The interrogation room was equipped with cameras from multiple angles. Other than that, the furnishings were very simple. In front of it was a long desk with three seats. One of the seats had a computer monitor in front of it.

Opposite the desk was a metal chair fixed to the ground. There was a fence around the chair, a little like a small table for children to eat. There were two thick metal rings on it, which were obviously for the person who was being sent to sit.

After Xia ruofei entered, he walked over and sat on the chair.

One of the police officers went forward to lock the buckle and took out the handcuffs from his waist. He hesitated for a moment and looked at Qin Xiao Yu who was in a daze at Peach Blossom Farm. Xia ruofei’s amazing skill of getting rid of the handcuffs had left a deep impression on him. Now, he was a little hesitant about whether he should handcuff Xia ruofei and whether there was any meaning to it.

Qin Xiao Yu frowned and shook her head slightly. The policeman immediately kept the handcuffs and walked back to the table to sit down.

The other police officer had already turned on the computer with both hands on the keyboard. He was obviously in charge of taking notes.

Qin Xiao Yu, who was sitting in the middle, said with a hint of sarcasm: “”You’re very familiar with the procedures! Do you go to the police station often?” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“It’s alright ...” Xia ruofei smiled faintly.”Officer Qin, if you have anything to ask, can you ask now?”

Qin Xiao Yu snorted coldly and asked in a business – like tone: “Name?”

“Xia ruofei.”

“Age”

……

After the first few routine questions, Qin Xiao Yu said coldly,””Xia ruofei, tell me in detail where you went and what you did the night before yesterday, from 8 to 8:30 p.m. On the 18th of April.”

Qin Xiaoyu paused for a moment and added,””We already have clear evidence in our hands. You’d better think clearly before you answer. I don’t need to repeat the principle of leniency to those who confess and severity to those who resist, do I?”

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”I was surfing the internet at home on the farm that night. After I received a WeChat message from my friend, I went to the zero – degree dream bar in the beijiangbin area and picked her up. Then, I went home. If I remember correctly, it should be around the time you mentioned!”

“Picking up a friend?” Qin Xiao Yu sneered and said,”did nothing else happen?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””The owner of the bar is too nice to my friends. He insisted on having my friends stay, so I had to use some tricks ...”

“Xia ruofei! Don’t be so cheeky! Correct your attitude! This is the Public Security Bureau!” Qin Xiao Yu rebuked.

Xia ruofei shrugged his shoulders, still looking relaxed.

Qin Xiao Yu stared at Xia ruofei and asked: “that night, there were a total of thirteen people who were injured. This is the little trick you were talking about?”

Xia ruofei pouted.”That’s impossible. I know what I’m doing. No one will die!”

“So, you admit that you were the one who hit him?” Qin Xiao Yu continued to ask.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes, I did.”

Qin Xiao Yu and the other two police officers looked at each other and saw a trace of joy in each other’s eyes. Qianqian’s case had been solved too smoothly, in less than three days, the murderer had been caught.

Qin Xiao Yu said to the policeman on her right,””Da Qiang, go and settle the relevant procedures and arrest him!”

“Alright!” Da Qiang stood up and said.

“Officer Qin, don’t you want to know why I hit you?” Xia ruofei’s tone turned cold as he asked,”don’t you police know anything about that master Luo? I wonder what kind of person he is?”

Qin Xiao Yu said coldly: “no matter what the reason is, no matter what the victim did before, it’s illegal for you to hit someone. Moreover, you hit him so seriously.”

Then Qin Xiao Yu continued to speak in a business – like manner: “”Xia ruofei, describe in detail how you attacked him!”

Xia ruofei sneered.”Yes, I know that even if that master Luo is a scumbag, he’s still protected by the law. But do you know what would have happened to my friend if I hadn’t arrived in time that night?” She just went to the bar to spend some money, and she was taken to his room by the subordinate of the victim you mentioned. She was even forced to drink an entire bottle of wine!”
