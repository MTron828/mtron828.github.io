Lin Jiaxin was still a young girl who had just graduated not long ago. She blushed at Liu Qian’s bold words and didn’t know how to respond.

Xia ruofei laughed.”That’s enough, Liu Qian. Jiaxin is as pure as a little white rabbit. You have the cheek to tease her like this?”

“Alright, alright!” Liu Qian said with a smile. Jiaxin was really pitiful! Even the chairman can’t help but stand up for her, I can’t afford to offend her ... Then let’s invite the chairman to present the award to Jiaxin!”

Xia ruofei nodded and took the display board with the words “grand prize” printed on it from the staff. He turned around and handed it to Lin Jiaxin.

Lin Jiaxin’s face still had a hint of red as she said in a low voice,”Thank you, Chairman!”

Xia ruofei laughed and replied,”you’re welcome!” By the way ... The one – month promise is still in effect. If you find a boyfriend within this period, you can apply for one more slot from the company. ”

Xia ruofei glanced at Liu Qian and said,””Forget about being a girlfriend!”

His words made everyone burst into laughter again.

“I understand, thank you, Chairman!” Lin Jiaxin said with a red face.

Lin Jiaxin walked down the stage under everyone’s envious eyes. Liu Qian also put away her playful expression and said seriously,”Finally, let’s invite the chairman to give us his instructions!”

After that, Liu Qian walked down the stage and left the stage to Xia ruofei. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The employees in the audience also focused their attention on Xia ruofei. Liu Qian had left some suspense since the beginning of the annual meeting. She said that Xia ruofei was going to announce an important decision of the company, so everyone was very curious about what it was.

The audience was silent. Xia ruofei held the microphone and said with a smile,””It’s not really an order. I’m just using this occasion to announce something!”

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and continued,””The first thing is, for the sake of the company’s development, after boss Feng and I have discussed and decided to make some adjustments to the company’s structure, we will set up two branch companies, Taoyuan agricultural products company and Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory. Cao tieshu and Xue Jinshan will be in charge of the branch companies! “In addition, the company’s leadership will be expanded. Xiao Qiang will be promoted to the Chief Marketing Officer, pang Hao to the Chief Financial Officer, and Feng Jing to be the president. The company will also set up two vice presidents and one Chief Administrative Officer positions, which are currently vacant!”

At this point, Xia ruofei paused for a moment to give everyone some time to digest the information.

The employees in the audience were also excited after hearing this, especially those who had been promoted to the company’s leaders and the head of the branch office. Although they had already accepted the pre – Appointment talk a few days ago, after the official announcement of the appointment, they still couldn’t help but feel excited, as if they were full of motivation to start a business.

Xia ruofei continued,”due to business needs, the company will set up two new departments directly under the company, the overseas business department and the e – commerce business department. Jiang Limei and Luo Xing will be the directors of these two departments.” The directors of the finance and marketing departments will be held by pang Hao and Xiao Qiang!”

Xia ruofei saw that the audience was still silent, so he smiled and said,””The structure and position adjustments have been announced. I suggest that everyone give a warm round of applause and congratulate our newly appointed colleagues!”

The employees finally came back to their senses and applauded enthusiastically. Xiao Qiang and the others also quickly stood up and bowed slightly to express their gratitude.

“We have limited time today, so I won’t invite the above few colleagues to come on stage to give their inauguration speeches.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”after you go down, all the departments will have a meeting to straighten out the working relationships as soon as possible. After the spring Festival, our company will officially start to operate according to the new structure!”

Xia ruofei continued,”as for the second thing, I believe everyone has noticed it. Recently, the employees of the Human Resources Department have been very busy. They have gone to various departments to do a large number of surveys and assessments. Some of them have even been asked to check their files. I’m sure everyone is guessing that the company has made some important move. Today, I’ll reveal it to everyone!”

“The next step will be a personnel reform. All personnel will be divided into ranks!” Xia ruofei said,”according to the nature of the position, it is divided into management and technical positions. Each position has 10 levels, corresponding to different salaries and benefits! The employees in the Human Resources Department have been working overtime recently to complete the first level – ranking work!”

After the staff in the audience heard this, they couldn’t help but start discussing.

The company’s management was standardized, and the personnel ranking system was imperative. However, this was related to everyone’s vital interests. Everyone was concerned about what rank they would be set and whether their salary and treatment would be affected.

Xia ruofei gestured with his hands and said,”everyone, stop discussing!” Let me finish! There would be a very detailed and scientific standard for the ranks of personnel. It would be issued in the form of company documents, and everyone could read it! Moreover, there were also very clear assessment criteria for the promotion of ranks, so everyone could clearly see their own channel of Ascension. “Also, please don’t worry. After the first ranking, the results will be published on the company’s internal website. If you have any questions, you can directly report to the HR department!”

“Also, I can tell you clearly that under the new hierarchy system, most of our colleagues ‘salaries have been increased. Xia ruofei continued,”the personnel grading system is just to clarify everyone’s career development path and to promote everyone’s enthusiasm for work. It’s not to reduce the benefits!”
