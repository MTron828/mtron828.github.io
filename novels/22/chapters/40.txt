41  Chapter 39 - making trouble from within (1)

    Xia ruofei turned off the engine and pulled up the handbrake before picking up his phone. When he saw that it was Ling Qingxue calling, he immediately picked it up.

  "Qingxue!" Xia ruofei said with a smile.

  "RUO Fei, where are you? I just came to your house and a woman said you've moved away. " Ling Qingxue asked anxiously.

  Xia ruofei laughed and asked,"

  "Was it a middle - aged woman who spoke very harshly?"

  Xia ruofei had already guessed that the woman Ling Qingxue was talking about was the fierce landlady. Although the fierce landlady could earn two months 'deposit for free, he was in such a hurry to check out the house. She must be worried that the house had been damaged or something had happened, so she would definitely come to check it out at once.

  "Yup! "You sound like you've eaten gunpowder ..." Ling Qingxue's tone was still a little indignant."You're getting impatient after asking a few more questions ... Oh, you haven't said anything yet! Why did he suddenly move? Don't tell me you're trying to avoid me?"

  Xia ruofei laughed and said,"

  "What are you thinking? Didn't you say yesterday that my living environment was too bad? I thought that what you said made sense, so I simply found another place to live. Why? You're looking for me? Why didn't you make a call first? Wouldn't it be embarrassing for you to make a wasted trip?"

  "Nonsense! Didn't we agree to sign a supply contract in the next two days?" Ling Qingxue pouted and said,"I didn't think that you would go missing again. This time, you're even worse. You even moved the entire house away ..."

  "I'm sorry, I'm sorry ..." Xia ruofei apologized profusely."There's no hurry to sign the contract. It's getting late. We'll start supplying tomorrow, right?" I'll give you an address, and you can just ask the person who picks up the goods to bring the contract over!"

  Ling Qingxue thought for a moment and said,"

  "That's fine too ... But you're not allowed to disappear again!"

  "Don't worry! I'm still counting on those vegetables to make a lot of money!" Xia ruofei laughed and said,"I'll treat you to a meal when I have time!"

  "This is more like it!" Ling Qingxue chuckled.

  The two of them chatted for a while more before they hung up. Xia ruofei sent the address of the holiday villa to Ling Qingxue.

  Then, Xia ruofei used WeChat to share his location with Ling Qingxue. This way, he would not have to worry about Ling Qingxue's men not being able to find him tomorrow.

  Xia ruofei returned to his room and opened the Taobao platform on his computer. He confirmed the delivery of each order and entered the express delivery number. After he was done, he went to the bathroom to take a shower and then put on his slippers and went downstairs to the kitchen to prepare food.

  After dinner, Xia ruofei gave Liang Qichao a call to express his gratitude. He also told him that the succulent seedlings had been delivered and asked him to check and receive them in the next few days.

  Liang Qichao was very happy. At the same time, he kept reminding Xia ruofei not to forget about the White - skinned lunar boundary. Xia ruofei naturally agreed.

  Back in his room, Xia ruofei carefully locked the door and took out the spirit map scroll. With a thought, he entered the medium.

  It had been three days since he plucked the petals. Xia ruofei entered the medium and ran straight to the nameless plant by the pond. As expected, the Tri - colored flower bloomed on the branch again. It had a natural charm that made Xia ruofei focus his eyes on the flower.

  Xia ruofei was completely at ease now. It seemed that the Tri - colored flower's pattern was that once it was picked, it would recover in three days.

  He squatted in front of the tricolored flower and admired it for a long time before reluctantly taking out a le - knot preservation box and a pair of tweezers. No matter how beautiful the tricolored flower was, it would not grow again if it was not plucked. This was a strategic resource to Xia ruofei, so once it grew, it had to be plucked and preserved well.

  Xia ruofei carefully used a pair of tweezers to pick off all three petals and put them in a Tupperware.

  In addition to the two remaining petals from the last harvest, there were already five petals in the safety box.

  Xia ruofei thought for a moment and reached out to pick up a petal with a pair of tweezers. Then, he carefully extended his hand. The moment his hand touched the petal, the petal immediately burrowed into his palm. Immediately after, he felt a familiar warm current.

  Xia ruofei couldn't help but moan in comfort.

  After absorbing the flower petal, Xia ruofei could clearly feel that his body had been strengthened. This strengthening was all - Round, including his strength, hearing, vision, and reaction.

  Xia ruofei had already made up his mind to harvest the petals every three days. He would keep two petals and absorb one for himself to strengthen his body.

  He felt that in the long run, there would definitely be unexpected benefits.

  There was still a lot of the "medicinal liquid" that he had mixed for Hu 'Zi's mother's treatment. Xia ruofei filled another bottle of mineral water and was prepared to send another bottle to Hu' Zi's mother in a few days.

  At the same time, he took out the small stainless steel wine pot he bought a few days ago and filled it with the 'medicinal liquid'. This flat wine pot could be carried with him, and he could take it out at any time in an emergency.

  ……

  The next morning, Xia ruofei woke up and went into the spirit map space to harvest the ripe vegetables. After weighing them, he placed about 20 catties of each type of vegetable in a basket and brought it outside.

  Xia ruofei had also sprinkled a lot of space pond water on the vegetables. To a certain extent, it could replace the preservation effect of the spirit map space.

  After moving the vegetable basket to the small garage on the first floor, Xia ruofei went to make breakfast for himself.

  The breakfast was also very simple. It was all ready - made bread and milk. After heating it a little, they finished the meal.

  At around eighto' clock, Xia ruofei heard a honking sound from outside the villa. He stood up and looked outside. He saw a white van parked at the entrance of the courtyard.

  Xia ruofei walked out. When he passed by the door, he pressed the remote control to open the courtyard door.

  When they reached the villa's courtyard, Xia ruofei realized that Ling Qingxue's flashy orange Porsche 911 was right behind the small truck. He could not help but smile bitterly. This girl had still come personally.

  The two cars stopped and Ling Qingxue quickly got out of the Porsche 911. The moment she saw Xia ruofei, she shouted,"

  "Ruofei, this place you found is really good! Facing the sea, flowers blooming in the warm spring! Not bad, you're directly buying a big villa!"

  Xia ruofei greeted him with a smile and said,"

  "How can I afford it! I rented this!"

  At this moment, a man in his late twenties got down from the front passenger seat of the small truck. When he saw Ling Qingxue and Xia ruofei chatting happily, he could not help but look at Xia ruofei warily. Then, he quickened his pace and walked towards the two.

  The man was dressed in a suit and leather shoes. He wore a pair of glasses and looked decent. He walked in front of the two of them and glanced at Xia ruofei. Then, he said,

  "Qingxue, is this our new supplier? Introduce me to them!"

  Ling Qingxue's brows furrowed slightly as she said,"

  "Manager he, I've reminded you more than once. You can call me manager Ling or miss Ling, but please don't call me 'Qingxue'. Our personal relationship is not that close!"

  Manager he's face turned red and white. He opened his mouth, but before he could speak, Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei and smiled."

  "RUO Fei, this is he Dong, the manager of our Ling Ji restaurant chain's procurement department. The procurement department is in charge of signing all the supply contracts for our food ingredients procurement."

  Ling Qingxue had no intention of introducing Xia ruofei to he Dong. She said indifferently,"

  "Manager he, please take out the contract!"

  Xia ruofei saw Ling Qingxue's frosty expression in front of others. Even if he did not have any other thoughts about Ling Qingxue, he still felt a little proud.

  As the host, he had to be polite, so Xia ruofei took the initiative to extend his hand to he Dong and said with a faint smile,"

  "Manager he, nice to meet you! I'm Xia ruofei. "

  He Dong ignored Xia ruofei's outstretched hand. His dark eyes swept over Xia ruofei, not hiding his hostility at all. Then, he said to Ling Qingxue in a business - like tone,"

  "Manager Ling, the chairman has always emphasized the strict control of ingredients. Before coming here this time, the chairman has also specifically emphasized the issue of food safety, so before signing the contract, I still have a few questions to confirm with Mr. Xia. Please understand."

  Ling Qingxue's eyes flashed with anger. However, Ling's restaurant was a large - scale chain enterprise that was even looking to go public in the future. It was not something that those small family workshops could compare to. The company had its own rules. Even if she was the Chairman's daughter, she still had to follow them.

  He Dong precisely grasped this point and occupied the moral high ground first.

  Ling Qingxue snorted and said,"

  "Hurry up! The restaurant is still waiting for these dishes!"

  He Dong revealed a fake smile and said,"

  "It'll be quick. It's just a routine inquiry."

  Ling Qingxue turned to look at Xia ruofei. Her eyes were apologetic and uneasy. She was afraid that Xia ruofei would be angry.

  Xia ruofei smiled at her and shook his head to show that he didn't mind.

  When he Dong saw the two of them making eyes at each other, an unknown fire rose in his heart. His gaze towards Xia ruofei was filled with coldness.

  He put on a serious face and asked," RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

  "Mr. Xia, although you were recommended by manager Ling, Ling's restaurant is a famous chain in Sanshan city. We have very high safety standards for our ingredients. May I ask if you have your own vegetable planting base?"

  "Not yet, but it will be built soon." Xia ruofei replied indifferently.

  "That means there's no one." He Dong said coldly with a dead fish face, then continued to ask,"then do the vegetables you provided have an Inspection and Quarantine certificate issued by an authoritative organization?"

  "No, I didn 't," Xia ruofei shook his head."These new vegetables are the latest research ..."

  "You don't have to explain!" He Dong interrupted Xia ruofei and said,"this is clearly a 'three - no - none' product! It's impossible for Ling Ji to acquire it! I'm sorry, manager Ling, but I can't sign this contract!"
