3032 The star evolution formation (1)

Xia ruofei nodded and walked into the room.

In the center of the room was a main control array disc the size of a millstone. It was surrounded by many supplementary array talismans.

Xia ruofei took a quick look and realized that even though the control center was in this room, the entire Zhai Xing Lou was closely related to the sect’s protective array. The ancestor of the Zhai Xing sect who had set up this protective array must have had a very high level of attainment in the Dao of arrays.

Luo Qingfeng said with a hint of pride,””Master, this sect – protecting formation is called the stellar evolution formation. It was personally set up by a genius elder of our sect five hundred years ago. As a result, star Seizer tower underwent a thorough transformation. Although we, the younger generation of disciples, have failed to live up to expectations these years and the star Seizer sect’s position in the cultivation world is only in the middle, in terms of defense, the existence of the stellar evolution formation is enough to deter most top – notch sects from rashly invading!”

“Yes!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”although I’ve only taken a preliminary look, I can feel that this array is really amazing!”

“Thank you for your praise, master,” Luo Qingfeng said. More than two hundred years ago, the top sect of that time, the myriad beasts sect, had formed a deadly enmity with the ancestors of my star Seizer sect, and once attacked with the entire sect. Not only were the myriad beasts sect’s cultivators stronger than the star Seizer sect, but they could also control wild beasts and even had a spirit beast. Ordinary sects couldn’t stop them at all, but in the face of the stellar evolution formation, even the myriad beasts sect was helpless. They attacked for more than a month, and in the end, they could only bitterly retreat!”

Xia ruofei said with great interest,”I didn’t know that the star Seizer sect had such a glorious history!” What about the myriad beasts sect? Why had he disappeared now? Don’t tell me you guys killed them instead?”

Luo Qingfeng laughed drily.”Master, you must be joking. The star Seizer sect’s strength has been on a decline for the past 300 years. How could they possibly have the ability to provoke the myriad beasts sect?” However, the myriad beasts sect had indeed disappeared without a trace. About a hundred years ago, it was said that the myriad beasts sect had discovered an incredible ancient cultivation ruin, and all the stronger cultivators in the sect had been sent there. None of them had returned, and they had lost their most powerful combat strength. The myriad beasts sect was usually quite domineering, and they had offended many forces. When this news spread, the sect was quickly torn apart! I heard that our star Seizer sect received the news a little too late and didn’t get a share of the loot. My Grandmaster was regretful about this for a long time!”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei felt a little emotional. Although Luo Qingfeng had only briefly described the history of the destruction of a sect, Xia ruofei could still feel the cruelty of the law of the jungle in the cultivation world.

This also reminded him once again that no matter what, he could not forget to work hard to improve his own strength. At the very least, he had to have the ability to protect himself.

Whether it was the Peach Blossom Island or the star Seizer sect, they were now Xia ruofei’s capital.

“Master, the star evolution formation’s formation diagram is also stored here. This old servant will find it for you!” Luo Qingfeng said.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”alright, I’ll take a look at the structure of this formation.” Since it was a formation set up by the ancestors of the star Seizer sect, it must be pretty good! I might not be able to improve it ...”

“Master, the star evolutionary formation is still much weaker than the Taixu xuanqing formation on the Peach Blossom Island.” Luo Qingfeng said,”therefore, I believe that master will definitely be able to come up with a better plan to further strengthen the star Seizer sect’s defense!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”The reason why the Taixu xuanqing formation was set up successfully was because the terrain there had formed a natural formation. I only made some changes to it. You can say that I’m taking advantage of the situation!” If I were to set up such a great formation out of thin air, I’m afraid that I wouldn’t be able to do it even if I were given fifty years!”

“Master, you are too humble ...” Luo Qingfeng said.”You are the most talented young man I have ever seen. Whether it is in terms of cultivation or array Dao, you have made me feel ashamed!”

Xia ruofei thought to himself,”actually, I’m the strongest in the laws of space. What you said is only slightly better than the average cultivator.”

As he spoke, Qingfeng Luo took out a key from his storage ring and opened a cabinet in the corner of the room. He carefully took out a drawing from it.

Xia ruofei took it and looked at it. The drawing was made of animal skin, but he could not recognize what animal skin it was because it had been too long. The drawing was full of mottled marks, and the drawing and words were a little blurred. However, if one looked closely, they could still recognize it.

Xia ruofei opened the blueprint and looked at it carefully with the help of the light. What surprised Xia ruofei was that the star Seizer sect had already used electric lights. Even the interior of the star Seizer tower was equipped with LED lights that were of decent brightness.

According to Qingfeng Luo, this was a set of power generation equipment that Wang Boshan had specially introduced. The power station and substation were located near a mountain stream not far from the sect. They used the drop in water flow to generate power and then transmitted it to the sect.

Of course, those facilities were also maintained by specialized disciples. At the same time, they were also hidden by arrays. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

In order to introduce electricity into the sect, Wang Boshan also specially transferred a group of disciples from the sect to the electricity school for training. The subsequent construction and equipment maintenance were all done by this group of disciples.
