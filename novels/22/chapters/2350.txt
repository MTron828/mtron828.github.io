2351 The African continent (2)

For example, Xia ruofei only found out that he needed a small yellow Book called “International Certificate of Vaccination or preventive measures” when he came out of his closed – door cultivation. He flipped through his backpack and saw the small yellow Book.

Zhao Yongjun had naturally prepared this for him.

Xia ruofei did not get any vaccine.

The environment in Africa was relatively harsh, and there were still some stubborn diseases that could not be eliminated, such as malaria. Once you were infected with these diseases, your life could even be in danger.

However, Xia ruofei did not have to worry about that. If a cultivator was infected with a disease, he would be a laughing stock.

Xia ruofei followed “international practice” and inserted a 10 – dollar note into his passport. He quickly passed through the customs.

He walked out of the airport and got into a taxi, heading to the hotel he had booked online.

For the convenience of transferring flights, Xia ruofei had booked a hotel near the airport.

Along the way, Xia ruofei looked out of the car window curiously. It was his first time in the mysterious continent of Africa.

Ethiopia was a poor and backward country. However, as the capital of Ethiopia, it looked good. At least, it was better than the stereotypes in Xia ruofei’s mind.

There were almost no pedestrians on the streets in the early hours of the morning. The shadows of the buildings on both sides of the road could be seen in the dark. Xia ruofei did not feel uneasy after coming to a foreign country. After the novelty had passed, he leaned back lazily in his seat and closed his eyes to rest.

The hotel was very close to the airport, so they arrived in no time.

Xia ruofei went to the front desk of the hotel and was greeted by a sleepy black girl.

Xia ruofei used English and sign language to communicate with the tanned girl with much difficulty. Finally, they completed the check – in procedures.

He took the room card and took a creaking elevator to the fifth floor where the room was located.

Looking at the mottled elevator and the tattered carpet after leaving, Xia ruofei really suspected that this hotel could reach the standard of a three – Star hotel.

Or was it that the standards for a three – Star Ethiopia a three – Star in China were different?

Xia ruofei felt that it was fortunate that he had chosen a ‘three – Star hotel’ for the convenience of his transit. If he had chosen a ‘five – Star hotel’ in the city center, he would have felt even worse.

After finding his room, Xia ruofei opened the door and entered.

He inserted the room card into the power access, turned on all the lights, and looked around the room.

This hotel was indeed a little old, and the furnishings in the room were obviously quite old.

However, he was quite satisfied with the fact that, although it looked a little shabby, at least the sanitary conditions were good. It was not as dirty and messy as he had imagined.

Xia ruofei then used his spiritual power to check the entire room.

The first thing Xia ruofei would do when he was in a strange place was to check the surroundings.

Fortunately, there were no messy micro cameras or listening devices.

Xia ruofei threw his bag on the bed and walked into the bathroom to take a shower.

In fact, according to China’s time, it was already six or seven in the morning. Xia ruofei had also slept on the plane, so he was not sleepy at all.

He didn’t book a hotel to sleep, but mainly because he had to wait for nearly ten hours. It would be hard to stay in the airport all the time, so he might as well find a hotel. Even lying down and resting for a while would be good.

Xia ruofei was in the middle of a shower when the room suddenly turned dark.

He subconsciously released his spiritual power and found that the entire hotel was pitch black. Only then did he realize that there was probably a power outage.

Power failure was a distant word in the eyes of the Chinese.

Except for power company maintenance or force – less natural disasters, there were basically no large – scale power outages in China. The days of power shortages were long gone.

The water from the showerhead turned very cold.

Xia ruofei did not mind. Even if it was ice water, he could still wash it. As for the darkness, it didn’t matter at all. The eyes of a high – Level refinement stage cultivator were much stronger than night vision. At least, they wouldn’t see black and white things like night vision.

Xia ruofei finished his shower and wiped his body clean. Then, he took out some home clothes from the space and changed into them. After that, he went out to lie on the bed and rest.

He was very energetic now, and it could be said that he was not sleepy at all.

So, he didn’t force himself to sleep. Instead, he took out his phone and read the news for a while. Before he left, he applied for international roaming for the phone number he would be using for the summer. Although the network signal here was a little bad, it was still usable.

Xia ruofei lay down and rested for a few hours. When it was past nine in the morning, he went downstairs to find something to eat.

In the hotel restaurant, Xia ruofei ordered a toast and a glass of beef oil and fruit juice.

The bread tasted ordinary. It felt like it had been baked, and there was a faint burnt smell.

However, the beef oil fruit juice left a deep impression on Xia ruofei. The fragrance was very strong, and it should be of high purity.

He finished his breakfast unhurriedly and asked for an extra glass of beef oil and fruit juice.

After eating, Xia ruofei returned to his room upstairs and packed his luggage. He then went downstairs to check out and asked the front desk to call a taxi.

For this, Xia ruofei even gave a tip of 50 dollars to the black – hearted girl at the front desk.

The dark – skinned girl’s eyes lit up. Xia ruofei had no doubt that if he revealed a trace of desire, this dark – skinned girl would definitely lean over without hesitation.

The local monthly salary was only equivalent to a few hundred Chinese dollars. The tip Xia ruofei had given was almost half a month’s salary for a front desk attendant.

However, Xia ruofei was not that hardcore. His taste was more traditional. He could accept blondes from Europe and America, but as for dark – skinned girls...Forget it.

Xia ruofei got into a taxi and headed back to Bo Lai airport.

It was morning, local time, so the people outside could see it clearly.

Xia ruofei realized that his first impression Ethiopia last night was based on the concept of “haziness makes beauty.” When the veil of the night was removed, he realized that even as the capital of Ethiopia, the level of development in Ethiopia was relatively backward. The buildings outside looked a little shabby. From the hotel to the airport, Xia ruofei could already see a few unfinished buildings.

After returning to Bo Lai airport, Xia ruofei went through the procedures at the counter and entered the restricted area of the airport.

Borai airport was actually very small, and Xia ruofei found his boarding gate very quickly.

There was still more than an hour before his Ethiopia flight took off. Xia ruofei found an empty seat and sat down.

He put his hand into his backpack, but in reality, he took out a book from his space and started to read it casually.

After a while, a hesitant voice sounded beside him,””You’re ... Chinese?”

The man spoke in Mandarin, but his accent was a little strange. Xia ruofei followed the sound and saw a young black man in his early twenties smiling at him. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Yes, I’m from Huaxia!” Xia ruofei nodded.

“Hello, hello!” The young black man said enthusiastically,”let me introduce myself. My name is fdaslkja asdfa Daka ... Well, that’s not important! Our African names are really too long, even I sometimes can’t remember them clearly. You can call me Daka!”

Xia ruofei wanted to laugh,’clock in? Is this to remind you to check in at work?”

Daka grinned, revealing a mouth full of white teeth.

He nodded and said,”actually, this is just a syllable in my name. It’s easier to remember, so my friends all call me that.” By the way, I have a lot of Chinese friends because I studied in Beijing for three years! I also learned my Chinese at that time!”
