2483 Another piece of good news (2)

Translator: 5496903He felt a little bored after staying for a while, so he asked Wu Qiang to drive him to the Paradise gathering.

Xia ruofei’s Toyota Elfa was very recognizable. The security guards of the Paradise Association were very familiar with it. Hence, when the car arrived at the entrance of the Association, the security guards immediately let it through.

Zhao Yongjun wasn’t in the club today. Song Rui and Hou Liang had been staying in the club for the past few days. The environment here was very good, and there was a formation to gather spirit Qi. It was quite comfortable to stay in the club.

Zhao Yongjun also had other businesses, but he would come to the Paradise society whenever he had time.

The shareholders had reserved rooms that were not open to the public. No matter when they came, they would have a place to stay.

As for the small villa by the lake, it was reserved for Xia ruofei. No one was allowed to enter it.

As soon as Xia ruofei walked into the main hall of the peach blossom society’s main building, song Rui and the others, who had been informed by the security guard at the entrance, came out to welcome him.

“What a rare guest! President Xia, how come you’re so free today to take care of my business?” Song Rui exclaimed exaggeratedly.

Xia ruofei glanced at him and said,””Stop mocking me! Otherwise, I’m going to ask you for your gambling debt! Or ... Let’s play a few more rounds of golf?”

Song Rui immediately shrank his neck and said,””You can’t do this!”

Hou Liang, Xu Zixuan, and the others couldn’t help but laugh. Hou Liang stepped forward and asked,”Brother Xia, what do you want to play today?”

“So you have everything here?” Xia ruofei teased.

“Although it’s not too accurate, it’s about the same!” Xu Zixuan grinned and said,”although our Paradise Club has only been open for five to six days, it has already spread in the circle. Our reputation is simply explosive!”

“Look at you guys!” Song Rui said,”this is just the beginning, okay? You’re already so excited over such a small situation. What about the future?”

Xu Zi Xuan said weakly,”brother Rui, who was the one who looked at the Paradise gathering’s single day flowing water and couldn’t stop smiling?.”

Xia ruofei burst into laughter. He patted song Rui’s shoulder and said,””The pot calling the kettle black. That’s you, Xiao Rui!”

After being exposed by Xu Zixuan, song Rui couldn’t help but feel a little embarrassed and angry. He said,””Xuan Zi, you’re cutting yourself off from the people! Is this the attitude a small shareholder should have? Ah?”

Xu Zi Xuan hurriedly raised his hands and begged for mercy: “Brother Rui, I was wrong! I won’t dare to do it again ... Even if you drool at flowing water, I won’t dare to go out and say anything!”

“Hahaha!”

Everyone was convulsing with laughter.

After some small talk, Xia ruofei and the rest went upstairs to book a private room. They asked the waiter to bring some peanuts, melon seeds, and a plate of fruit over. Then, they took a few bottles of beer. The few of them drank and chatted. The atmosphere was quite lively.

Xia ruofei clinked his bottle with song Rui’s and took a big gulp of beer. Then, he said,””Xiao Rui, liangzi, I still have to give you a warning. Our paradise society’s current momentum is very good, so you must not make a wrong decision in a moment of hot – headedness! Who knew how many pairs of eyes were staring at this place! If something goes wrong, it won’t just be a loss of money, it might even affect the family. ”

“Ruofei, don’t worry!” It was rare that song Rui did not argue with Xia ruofei. He said seriously,”I can still distinguish right from wrong! In the Paradise gathering, there are a lot of entertainment items, but there are two things that we absolutely don’t touch. One is women’s lust, and the other is drugs. Those young models and internet celebrities, if they have the ability, they can come in with the members. We don’t care, but we definitely won’t provide such services ourselves. ”

Song Rui paused for a moment before he continued,””And then there’s drugs. We definitely won’t get involved in this business. Not only that, but the entire club is also under strict surveillance. We definitely won’t allow members to bring those things in. Whether it’s ice cream or weed, they can do whatever they want outside. In any case, once they enter the door of Paradise Club, these things must be put an end to!”

Xia ruofei nodded approvingly and said,””Well done! This rule should be established! He couldn’t leave any room for gossip! The conditions of the peach Garden party are unique, and we don’t need those crooked ways. We can already have a very good development by relying on the upright business!”

Song Rui, Hou Liang, Xu Zixuan, and the others all nodded in agreement.

In fact, before the opening of the Paradise gathering, everyone had already formed a consensus and thought so. However, Xia ruofei saw that the Paradise gathering was doing well these days. Song Rui, Xu Zixuan, and the others were even a little out of it, so he couldn’t help but remind them.

Pulling up his sleeves at the critical moment was what a true friend should do.

Everyone was drinking, chatting, and singing. It was very lively.

At this moment, Xia ruofei’s phone on the coffee table vibrated. He glanced at it and saw that it was Feng Jing calling. He immediately stood up and took his phone out of the private room. After drinking some wine, the few of them were roaring and singing rock and roll. It was like a group of demons dancing around. He could not hear their voices and could not pick up the call.

Xia ruofei walked out of the private room. When the thick door closed, the ghostly wails and howls of the singing in the room were suddenly cut off. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

He swiped the screen and answered the call.

“Sister Che! Is there something you need?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“Are you a little too happy to return home? “My Dear Chairman ...” Feng Jing asked with some resentment.

Xia ruofei was becoming more and more “ridiculous”. He used to go out often but would come back in a few days. Now, he would go out for ten to twenty days, even for a month or two. He did not care about the company’s Affairs in between. He could really rest assured!

If it was a more ambitious general manager, he might be more than happy to do it!

However, Feng Jing had put all her heart and soul into the company’s operations and had no interest in it at all. It was also because she was more serious and responsible that she would not make decisions on her own when Xia ruofei was not around. Instead, she would report to Xia ruofei over the phone.

After hearing Feng Jing’s words, Xia ruofei laughed dryly and said,””Sister che, I still have some things to deal with in Beijing. Aren’t you helping me to keep an eye on the company? I’m not worried! By the way, did you call me today for something at the company?”

Feng Jing was helpless against Xia ruofei’s shamelessness. Every time Xia ruofei praised her, saying that “the capable do more work”, the resentment in her heart would disappear.

Feng Rao grumbled in her heart,’this guy really has me in his palm!

She said,”we’ve already completed the deal with miles Pharmaceutical Group in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province. President Dong asked me to ask you when you’ll have to go and inspect it!” Also, the next step is the transformation of the production line and the adjustment of the pharmaceutical company’s structure. You have to make the final decision!”

Xia ruofei’s eyes lit up and he said,”sure!” Dong Yun’s actions were very fast! It’s worthy of praise!”

“It’s mainly because of the pharmaceutical Group. They’ve suddenly become very cooperative during this period of time. Otherwise, for such a large group, the workload of just checking the accounts would be terrifying.” Feng Jing said,”President Dong has worked hard this time! Don’t forget to reward him!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”no problem!” Give a big red packet to everyone in the handover team!”

Speaking of money, Xia ruofei suddenly remembered something and asked,””By the way, sister che, have you transferred the three million euros I asked you to transfer a few days ago?”

A few days ago, after Xia ruofei signed the contract with Zhou leiyun, he transferred 30 million euros from his overseas bank account to glory world corporation’s account.

As for the three million euros that sponsored the chest advertisement, he had called Feng Jing and asked the company’s finance to transfer it directly to the Spanish football club.

“I’ve already arranged for the financial department to transfer the money. It should have been transferred.” Feng ke said.

“That’s good! That’s good!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Oh right, I’ve thought of a better reward plan!”
