Although the possibility was small, Xia ruofei still had to be careful.

“We understand!” Xu Yougang nodded and said.

Xia ruofei smiled.”The first option is for you to continue working for me in secret. I’ll personally pay you. As for the salary ... It’ll be the same as the salary of the Vice President of the security Department! I don’t need your help in normal times, nor do I need you to be responsible for security issues. However, you may be required to carry out some tasks at certain times. ”

Xia ruofei was different from the other rich people. As a cultivator, he did not need a bodyguard for his own safety. If he really met someone who could threaten his safety, it was not something that the bodyguard could handle. Furthermore, the bodyguard was always with him, which made it more inconvenient for him to do some things. In addition, if the Liu family found out something, it would be easier for them to link Liu haojun’s incident with Xia ruofei.

So, if Xu Yougang and the others chose this plan, he needed to keep quiet and live like an ordinary person. When needed, he could use their investigative expertise to help Xia ruofei do things that were inconvenient or inconvenient for him to do. That would be enough.

Xia ruofei did not care about the money he had to spend on these people.

“What about the second plan?” Xu Yougang asked.

“The second option is to go abroad to work.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I have a big farm in Australia and I need someone I can trust to be in charge of security there. If I go abroad, the salary might be higher since it is based on the local employee’s treatment standards. However, I will be far away from my family, so it’s up to you to make the choice ...”

Xu Yougang and the other three looked at each other and said,””Chairman, we need to discuss this!”

“Of course, you guys can discuss it slowly!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Lei Hu, come with me. I have something for you to do!”

“Alright!” Lei Hu replied.

Xia ruofei and Lei Hu stood up and left the guest area, leaving Xu Yougang and the others to discuss.

After walking to his desk and sitting down, Xia ruofei passed the note with the address to Lei Hu and said,””I asked the company to buy a batch of materials for me. They’re now stored in the temporary warehouse of the building. Help me transport these materials to the warehouse at this address.”

Xia ruofei then took out the key to the warehouse and handed it over.”Oh, this is the key to that warehouse. After you put the items there, you can return the key to me!”

“Understood!” Lei Hu took the key and the note and said,”I’ll contact the car in a while. It’ll be done by today!”

Xia ruofei nodded.”You can contact President Feng for the details. She personally handled the materials.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Alright!” Lei Hu said,”Chairman, if there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave first!”

“Mm! Go!” Xia ruofei said.

Lei Hu greeted Xu Yougang and the others before leaving Xia ruofei’s office to look for Feng Rao to discuss the materials.

Xu Yougang and the other three discussed in low voices for a while and came to a decision. They came to Xia ruofei and Xu Yougang said,””Chairman, we’ve already discussed it!”
