Store manager Liu’s face turned pale, and his head buzzed. He didn’t even know when Vice – President Jiang hung up the phone.

It took him eight years to go from an ordinary salesperson to a store manager.

Store manager Liu’s education level was not high to begin with. How much hardship had he gone through to get to where he was today?

Now, because of a moment of impulse, everything was gone.

Besides the real estate agency industry, he didn’t know anything else. It was simply a fantasy for a 40 – year – old man to compete with young people in a new industry.

Store manager Liu thought of his monthly house loan and car loan, and his family’s hunger for food. If he lost this job, how was he going to survive in the future?

When he heard the beeping sound from the phone, he put his phone back into his pocket in a daze and slowly turned to look at Bai Jingjing.

Not far away, Bai Jingjing had also finished her call.

He didn’t even need to ask. Bai Jingjing’s expression was as if her father had died.

Bai Jingjing smiled bitterly at store manager Liu and said,””I’ve been fired ... And ... Banned from the entire industry ...”

Just now, they threatened that even if Guan Ping resigned, he would not be able to survive in the real estate agency industry. Now, all the consequences were on them. It was a huge irony.

Store manager Liu was really regretful now. Why did he provoke this Sly Fox? If it weren’t for Bai Jingjing, he would still be the manager of the store. Not only did he enjoy a high salary, but he would also get a share of the sales of everyone under him.

Now, everything was gone.

‘There’s a knife above lust ...’ Such a thought appeared in store manager Liu’s mind.

Then, a bolt of lightning flashed across his mind, and Guan Ping’s figure appeared. He couldn’t help but shiver.

The one who tied the bell needs to untie the bell!

That young man was Guanping’s friend, if Guanping could say something, he might be able to let him off.

With that thought in mind, store manager Liu felt as if he had found a life – saving straw. Without a word, he took out his phone and quickly found Guan Ping’s number and dialed it.

Bai Jingjing didn’t know how to react, but she heard store manager Liu mumble,””Guanping, answer it! I beg you, pick up the phone!”

Bai Jingjing suddenly realized that she had Guanping’s number as well. However, she was too late for manager Liu. Even she couldn’t get through to him.

Hence, Bai Jingjing could only walk towards store manager Liu with her eyes sparkling. No one knew what she was thinking.

......

In the Knight XV SUV.

After Xia ruofei gave ye Lingyun pang Hao’s address, he leaned back on the passenger seat and closed his eyes to rest.

Pang Hao’s income this year was quite impressive. He had already taken out a mortgage at the end of the year to buy a Big Four – room apartment of more than 130 square meters, which was also a real estate developed by jianda group. After Xia ruofei had informed him of this, Liang Weimin had even readily given him a big discount.

The house was furnished and furnished. Pang Hao had added some furniture and electrical appliances, and the whole family moved in. They would be living in the new house this year for the new year. Now, pang Hao’s parents were quite satisfied with him, and they held their heads high in front of their relatives and friends.

“Pingzi, give uncle and Auntie a call and ask them to come downstairs to pick up chubby boy.” Xia ruofei suddenly turned around and said,”it’s getting late. Let’s not go upstairs!”

“Alright!” Guan Ping laughed as he took out his phone.

Just as he was about to make the call, his phone vibrated.

Guan Ping took a look at the caller ID, and his face turned ugly. He snorted and said, “It’s Liu Chengdong!”

“You mean that store manager Liu?” Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and asked.

“En!”

Xia ruofei revealed a look of understanding. It seemed that uncle Liang was really efficient! It had only been ten minutes!

“You take it! “Let’s hear what he wants to say ...”Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Guan Ping nodded his head, and pressed the answer button, before coldly saying,”Store manager Liu, do you have any other advice?”

On the other end of the phone, store manager Liu was no longer as arrogant as he used to be in front of Guan Ping. He said,””I don’t dare! Little Guan ... No, no, no, Guan Ping! It’s our fault for what happened today. I’ve been too rough with you while you were in the store, and I’ve made you suffer a lot. I’m really sorry ...”

A look of surprise appeared on Guan Ping’s face. If it wasn’t for the number and voice, he would have thought that it was someone else. He had been transferred to manager Liu’s store for two to three months, but he had never seen manager Liu speak to his subordinates in such a tone.

Even when Guanping had made it clear that he wanted to resign, manager Liu was still acting all high and mighty. Why did his attitude suddenly take a 180 – degree turn?

“Manager Liu, are you making fun of me?” Guan Ping frowned and said,”I don’t have time to joke with you!”

“Guanping, I really know I was wrong ...” Store manager Liu lowered his posture even more.”Please, please help me put in a good word for your friend! I really can’t lose this job! My mother is old and sick! My wife doesn’t have a job, my child is going to primary school soon, and I still have a house loan and a car loan ... If I lose my job, this family will really be over ...”
