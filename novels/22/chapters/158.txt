Chapter 159: Chapter 156 – the running monster

Monica simply stopped and ran for more than an hour. She had already completed the target amount of exercise. She walked to the side and sat down. As she wiped the sweat off her body with a towel, she looked at the two men on the treadmill with great interest. Xia ruofei was no different from when he first started running. His breathing was still steady, his pace was still steady, and there was not much sweat on his body. Monica’s beautiful eyes bloomed with a strange light. She loved sports. When she was on business trips around the world, the hotel gym was a must-go place for her. She had seen many fitness experts, but she had never seen someone like Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei’s body did not look strong. He even looked like a weak scholar. However, it was as if he would never die from running. Looking at Xia ruofei’s state, Monica had the illusion that he could keep running. Could it be a mysterious force from the ancient East? Monica muttered in her heart. Blake, who was beside him, was in an extremely sorry state. He was sweating profusely, and his mouth was wide open like a fish that lacked oxygen. He gasped for air, and his face had become very pale. He could no longer maintain a steady pace, and he could barely keep up with the speed of the treadmill. In the beginning, Blake would turn his head from time to time to look at Xia ruofei provocatively. Now, he was too busy to take care of himself. He gritted his teeth and forced himself to hold on because he could see Xia ruofei running non-stop from the corner of his eye. On one side, Blake, who was in a difficult situation, was still holding on. On the other side, Xia ruofei was still calm and composed. He even had the time to remind Monica, ” ” Monica, I think you’d better take a shower first. Otherwise, you’ll catch a cold easily. ” “Are you showing concern for me? ” Monica asked with a smile. ” Uh ...” Xia ruofei scratched his head and said, ” a friendly reminder! ” “Hahaha! Dongfang boulther s shy!” Monica pointed at Xia ruofei and laughed. “Bolt of the East?” Xia ruofei was stunned. “You can run so well, aren’t you the same as bolt?” “He’s a sprinter, okay?” Xia ruofei said, not knowing whether to laugh or cry. “It’s all the same ...”Monica said, overjoyed. Blake was already at his limit. When he saw Xia ruofei and Monica chatting happily, he felt exhausted and anxious. He couldn’t help but feel weak in his legs and fell on the treadmill. The treadmill changed into a conveyor belt in seconds, and Blake was directly “transported” to the back. Then he rolled to the ground and gritted his teeth in pain. Monica laughed even harder when she saw this. The staff of the gym quickly came over to help Blake up and asked him if he was injured. Blake was in so much pain that he kept gasping for cold air. He pointed at his ankle. The staff quickly called the sports doctors in the fitness center, and several people helped Blake to the side to treat his wounds. Blake and Xia ruofei’s competition had been seen by the people on treadmills and other equipment nearby. Now that Blake was in such a sorry state while Xia ruofei was still running at a steady speed, they couldn’t help but look at Xia ruofei. Most of the guests in the hotel were Chinese. Most of them were secretly cheering for Xia ruofei, thinking that he had a strong Chinese spirit. Monica smiled and said,”Xia, run slowly!” I’m going to take a shower first, I’ll come and see you later ...” “Alright! I’ll see you later!” Xia ruofei said as he ran. After Monica left, Xia ruofei increased the speed of the treadmill and ran at a faster speed. All the facilities in the Jiahua Hotel were first – Class. The treadmill was the latest model from aikang. Its performance was definitely the best. However, after running at such a high speed for a long time, the sound of the motor became a little heavy, as if it could not bear the weight. 10 minutes, 20 minutes ... Xia ruofei kept running tirelessly. He had been running for almost two hours and was running at an average speed of more than 13 kilometers per hour. Slowly, Xia ruofei attracted the attention of many people. Some people saw Xia ruofei running when they first entered the gym; When he was done with his preparation, Xia ruofei was still running. All kinds of equipment had been practiced. Xia ruofei was running; Xia ruofei was running on the treadmill, sweating profusely. Xia ruofei was still running when she came back from the shower ... It was just a simple run, but because of the continuous running, the shock it brought to people was far greater than that of the strong men who did bend lifts and somersaults. Everyone looked at the seemingly tireless Xia ruofei as if he was a monster. Some people were even discussing in low voices. “This person is really fierce! He was already running when I came in, so it must have been an hour! Such a fast speed ...” “An hour? It had already been more than two hours! And it’s always been this fast!” “Awesome!” “Just now, a white man challenged him, and he ran until he was disabled ...” “I’ll go! To raise the prestige of our country!” …… Monica returned to the gym after her shower. Xia ruofei was still running tirelessly ... After treating his injured ankle, Blake returned to the gym after a shower. When he saw Xia ruofei still running on the treadmill, he could not help but touch his forehead. What kind of monster was this! Why did she provoke him for no reason? Blake wailed in his heart. He picked up his coat and backpack and limped out of the gym without a word. Monica had already changed into a light pink sports jacket. She was sitting on the leather chair opposite Xia ruofei’s treadmill, her hands supporting her face as she watched Xia ruofei run. Xia ruofei could feel that many people were looking at him, especially Monica’s beautiful blue eyes, which were staring at him without moving. He felt a little uncomfortable. After running for another ten minutes, Xia ruofei reached out and pressed the switch. The speed of the treadmill gradually slowed down and finally stopped. In fact, if Xia ruofei wanted to run, he could still continue running for a long time. Xia ruofei jumped down from the treadmill easily. He reached for the towel on the pole beside him and symbolically wiped the sweat off his face. In fact, he did not sweat much. Xia ruofei could easily complete this kind of exercise when he was in the Army, but he was not as calm and relaxed as he was now. After running 20 to 30 kilometers of off – Road carrying weights, his clothes must be wet inside and out. How could he be as relaxed as he was now? All of this was naturally brought about by the petals of the strange flower. When Xia ruofei finished his run, there was even a burst of applause in the gym. Xia ruofei picked up his coat and said goodbye to Monica. He was going back to the Presidential Suite to take a bath. The conditions there were much better than the gym. Monica smiled at Xia ruofei and said,””Xia, aren’t you going to treat me to a cup of coffee?” [PS] announcing the VIP Reader group number: 295848872, genuine readers are welcome to join the group (after joining the group, you need to verify the screenshot of the full subscription).Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com
