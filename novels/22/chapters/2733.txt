2734 A duel between Jindan (1)

“Yes! Master!” Zheng Yongshou said,”I wish Master a Swift victory!”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand,”don’t run around!” If you’re attacked from the depths of the formation, even I won’t be able to save you!”

“I understand! I understand!” Zheng Yongshou said,”I promise I won’t leave!”

Xia ruofei nodded and disappeared into the mist.

Zheng Yongshou sat on the ground and let out a long breath. Up until now, he had completely completed the task that his master had given him. Qingfeng Luo had already entered the trap, and the rest was up to his master.

Zheng Yongshou was very confident in Xia ruofei, and he did not think that Xia ruofei would not be able to take down Luo Qingfeng.

In fact, Xia ruofei was not that optimistic. He had never come into contact with a golden core stage expert before, so he really did not know how much power Luo Qingfeng could burst out when he was in trouble.

……

Qingfeng Luo was calm. Even though he could not tell the direction with the compass and was surrounded by thick fog, he did not panic. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

According to his experience, even if the Taixu xuanqing array on this Island was activated intermittently, it should not be able to maintain for a long time. After all, the facilities used to activate the array on the island were very old. In his opinion, it was a miracle that the array could be activated. When he used his spiritual power to observe the outside just now, he found that several man – made facilities related to the activation of the array were in a state of damage.

Qingfeng Luo did not just wait there. He walked forward carefully based on his experience and took out an ancient bronze mirror from his storage ring.

Qingfeng Luo reached out and touched the surface of the mirror. The mirror began to change slowly, and finally turned into a transparent crystal.

He injected his spiritual power into the mirror, and the surface of the mirror immediately emitted a trace of light. Then, he looked through the mirror and saw that the fog in front of him actually began to slowly disperse, becoming thinner and thinner.

The corners of Luo Qingfeng’s mouth curled up slightly, and he was secretly pleased.

This was a treasure that he had found in a trade fair in the cultivation world a few years ago. At that time, many cultivators had seen this bronze mirror, but no one had found its profoundness. In the end, he had picked it up at a very low price.

Luo Qingfeng found that there were very complicated array patterns inside the bronze mirror. As long as he used a special method to activate it, he could see through illusions. It was very useful in solving maze arrays.

Luo Qingfeng did not know the origin of this mirror, but after buying it, he named it the “void exploration mirror”.

When he saw that the void exploration mirror could be used, he was overjoyed and further increased the strength of his spiritual power.

The image displayed on the void exploration mirror became clearer and clearer, and the part that was covered by the fog was slowly revealed.

“It seems that this array has indeed been in disrepair for a long time. A trapping array is only so – so!” Luo Qingfeng muttered to himself.

After the fog was seen through, it was naturally easy to determine the direction.

While Luo Qingfeng used the void exploration mirror to observe his surroundings, he began to calculate in his heart.

Array Dao was an extremely complex field of knowledge. It involved terrain, environment, astronomy, geography ... And many other theories. It was even related to Feng Shui. Anyone who had a certain level of research in array Dao would have extremely strong computational abilities. This was because whether it was setting up or breaking array techniques, they all needed to go through a large amount of calculations.

Even the most basic small – scale spirit gathering array would have to be set up in different ways depending on the time and place.

“I’ve found the kun position. Then ... I should take three steps to the right, and then one step to the left!” Luo Qingfeng muttered to himself.

As he spoke, he confidently took three steps to the right and then one step to the left according to his judgment.

Xia ruofei, who was hiding not far away and observing secretly, could not help but exclaim in surprise when he saw this scene. He was surprised that Luo Qingfeng’s judgment was very accurate. If they continued walking at this pace, they would be out of the range of the trapping array completely after another ten to fifteen meters.

Of course, this was only a trapping formation. The power of the Taixu xuanqing formation was not limited to this. The large formation also included a maze formation, an illusion formation, a killing formation, and many other formations. Moreover, these formations were still in a completely deactivated state. Xia ruofei had only released a trapping formation to test Luo Qingfeng’s strength.

Luo Qingfeng’s ability in array Dao surprised Xia ruofei, but he did not panic.

On the contrary, Xia ruofei’s fighting spirit was even more exuberant.

Although Luo Qingfeng had taken the right steps, Xia ruofei was not in a hurry to change the situation. Instead, he focused his attention and observed Luo Qingfeng’s every move as he broke the array.

The expression on Qingfeng Luo’s face became more and more relaxed. Every time, he would first use the void exploration mirror to confirm the position, and then after careful calculation and analysis, he would confidently take a few steps forward. Next, he observed and confirmed again, and then calculated again.

In a short while, Luo Qingfeng had already advanced about ten meters in the array.

As the controller of the array, Xia ruofei could see it clearly. He knew that Luo Qingfeng only needed to walk another three to five meters and he would be out of the range of the trapping array.

Qingfeng Luo clearly knew that he was moving forward on the right path and was only a few steps away from success. The smile on his face grew wider.
