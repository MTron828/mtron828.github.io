2549 First goal in La Liga (2)

Palrejo only felt a blur in front of his eyes. He only saw the number 25 on the other side’s back. He did not even have time to pull the other side to make a tactical foul. The other side had already moved the ball forward and was out of his control.

The one who rushed up to intercept the ball was Xia ruofei.

He had been lying in ambush in this area for a long time. He saw that the ball was high and floating, and although the captain of the other team, palrejo, was more accurate in his judgment of the landing point, he had the opportunity to intercept the ball with his own jump.

Xia ruofei made a decision in an instant. His timing was perfect and he intercepted the ball cleanly.

Ruby’s eyes widened. He didn’t even dare to blink as he stared at the situation on the field.

Xia ruofei’s timing was perfect. Valencia had just resolved one of the Espanyol’s attacks, and their players were dispersing. Since they were switching between offense and defense, it was Parejo’s turn to counterattack after he received the ball, so the other Valencia players were running away quickly.

However, the ball was intercepted, which meant that they had to change from an offensive formation to a defensive formation all of a sudden. It was easy to have loopholes in the change.

If they could seize this loophole, it was very likely that they could create a good scoring opportunity.

Ruby’s only worry was that Xia ruofei lacked experience and did not know what to do after stealing the ball.

However, Ruby was overthinking.

No one, including the Spanish players, knew that Xia ruofei had strong spiritual power. So, when it came to the breadth of mind, no player in the world could compare to Xia ruofei.

Because with Xia ruofei’s spiritual power, it was not as simple as “having eyes on the back of one’s head”. It could be said that there were no blind angles at all.

Therefore, after he intercepted the ball, he did not even look up. With a sweep of his spiritual power, he knew the situation on the field and the positions of the players on both sides like the back of his hand.

Xia ruofei immediately found the best way to deal with the ball. When Xia ruofei intercepted the ball, Wu Lei, who had finished “holding his head in frustration” in the penalty area, was jogging back and had just passed the last defender of the opponent team.

Wu Lei’s awareness was indeed strong. When Xia ruofei intercepted the ball, he almost subconsciously continued to accelerate towards the center circle. Then, he made a huge arc, a classic horse – hoof reverse run, and inserted himself into the opponent’s penalty area.

This required the team members to have a good understanding of each other because Wu Lei was active near the offside line. If they hesitated, he would be in an offside position.

Although Xia ruofei had never cooperated with Wu Lei before, his spiritual power allowed him to see the situation on the field clearly. Just as Wu Lei was about to pass the last defender on the other side, Xia ruofei passed the ball over the head.

This pass was also very skillful. It made a beautiful arc, and the height was just right. It could ensure that the opponent’s defensive player could not head the ball, and it could also ensure that the drop point was very accurate, just a few steps in front of Wu Lei.

A single blade again!

Unlike the previous times when there were interference from the opposing players not far away, there was no defender around Wu Lei this time. The full backs of Valencia raised their hands in unison to signal that Wu Lei was offside, but the assistant referee was unmoved, and the main referee did not say anything.

There was no one around to interfere, and the ball was passed just right, so Wu Lei did not need to adjust at all. He ran two steps after the ball, lifted his right foot, and shot directly.

He deliberately played a rolling ball and the football went straight to the lower left corner of the goal at a very fast speed.

Valencia’s 1.9 – meter – tall goalkeeper, Neto, could not react in time. Youyou definitely could not stop the ball with his speed. Neto only made a symbolic side – dive, and his eyes followed the trajectory of the ball.

At this moment, he could only pray that Wu Lei missed.

But this time, Wu Lei did not disappoint the Chinese fans who were on tenterhooks. The shot was powerful and the football was fast. It went straight to the dead end of the goal.

Neto did not even touch the ball and just watched the football fly into his goal.

Neto was so angry that he slammed his fist on the grass. He could not lose his temper at his teammates because the ball was mostly to the No. 10 Captain, parrejo. It was his ball that was intercepted, which led to the RCD Espanyol’s beautiful offensive cooperation.

The moment Wu Lei’s goal was scored, Ruby, who had been maintaining a motionless posture on the sidelines, jumped up and kept waving his fists in the air, celebrating the goal with passion.

The home fans of Valencia let out a huge sigh at that moment, while the Spanish fans in the away stands cheered loudly, shaking the entire stands.

Xue Jinshan and the others also became the most popular people in the stands. Many Spanish fans ran over to shake their hands, hug them, and constantly gave them thumbs up.

Xue Jinshan asked the staff of glory world Corporation,””What did they say?”

The employee was also very excited. He shouted in a hoarse voice,””They are all saying that our Chinese players are awesome!”

This shot came entirely from the cooperation of two Chinese players, including the chairman of their paradise Corporation, Xia ruofei. Xue Jinshan and the others suddenly felt a sense of pride.

All the work groups of the Paradise Corporation were in an uproar as everyone was enthusiastically discussing the ball just now.

“The Chairman’s passing is so cool!”

“A beautiful arc!”

“Tears! I can vaguely see Xiaobei’s elegance!”

“That was a beautiful goal! Two Chinese players broke the defense of Valencia!”

All the major online platforms in Huaxia also welcomed a wave of traffic. All the posts related to football, Xia ruofei’s Tieba, and forums were filled with a large number of posts. Even peach blossom company’s official Weibo account gained some popularity and gained a lot of fans.

Shen fangjian and Jia Tianning of wuchui Hall were even crazily speaking.

When Xia ruofei quickly passed the ball after he intercepted the ball, Shen fangjian shouted,””A direct pass! We saw that Wu Lei had already started moving ahead of time, and that was a huge opening! The pass was beautiful! It was a beautiful arc! The ball landed accurately at Wu Lei’s feet. He did not hesitate to shoot! The ball went in! The ball went in! The ball is in!”

The entire process only took a few seconds, but Shen fangjian’s mouth was like a machine gun. He spoke very quickly and when Wu Lei finally scored the goal, his voice was already hoarse from shouting.

After calming down, Shen fangjian said,”We want to congratulate Wu Lei! After creating a penalty kick in the previous round, he had taken a big step forward in this round. He scored his first goal in La Liga, which was also the first goal for a Chinese player in La Liga! This moment will be recorded in history!”

Jia Tianning said,”we noticed that the one who helped Wu Lei was Xia ruofei, who is also from China!” The pass was too beautiful. Whether it was the timing of the pass, the speed of the ball, the height, or the drop point ... It was almost perfect! Wu Lei’s position when he receives the ball is quite comfortable. All he needs to do is to raise his leg and shoot!”

“Valencia’s players are surrounding the referee to complain!” Shen fangjian said,”they’re probably complaining that Wu Lei was offside! But from the perspective of our broadcast, there’s no problem with this goal!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“It’s definitely not an offside!” Jia Tianning said,”when Xia ruofei passed the ball, there was a Valencia defender at the far end who was behind!”

Shen fangjian said,”if it was an offside, the referee should have reminded us in the video. There’s no response now, which means ... Let’s watch the replay!” Xia ruofei intercepted the ball beautifully. He stopped the ball with his chest and chased after it for two steps. He did not look up at all and directly raised his leg to pass the ball! This was the moment when Xia ruofei passed the ball. Through the frozen image, we could see that Wu Lei was at least half a body’s length behind the last defender of the opponent team! This is a good shot!”

As soon as Shen fangjian finished speaking, the scene had already cut back to the court. The main referee simply asked the video assistant referee through the headset and immediately pointed his finger to the center circle.

The goal is valid!
