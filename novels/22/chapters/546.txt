Ling Xiaotian was taken aback when he heard this, but he immediately smiled and said,””RUO Fei! I was just about to make a call! This little li came on his own ...”

Then, Ling Xiaotian said to his Secretary,””Let him in!”

“Alright,” he said.

Soon, Li Jing entered the office with an excited look on his face. He stopped in his tracks from a distance and bowed.””Good day, Chairman!”

Then, he saw Xia ruofei sitting on the sofa in the reception area. He quickly turned to Xia ruofei and bowed.””Good day, Mr. Xia!”

Li Jing had been appointed as the sales manager of Ding Feng winery. Naturally, he knew that the winery belonged to the chairman and his future son – in – Law, Mr. Xia. The two of them each held half of the shares.

In other words, Xia ruofei was also a boss who could decide his own fate. The only difference was that Xia ruofei did not participate in the specific management.

Xia ruofei smiled at Li Jing warmly and nodded in greeting.

“Xiao Li, what’s the matter that made you come all the way here?” Ling Xiaotian asked directly.

“Chairman, our newly released Drunken Eight Immortals wine sold well like hotcakes!” Li Jing exclaimed excitedly. The sales are steadily rising!”

Ling Xiaotian revealed an interested expression and said,””Oh? How did it sell? Tell me the details!”

Ling Xiaotian had never doubted the success of the Drunken Eight Immortals wine, because he himself was a wine lover. He knew that the Drunken Eight Immortals wine was a huge temptation to those who truly understood wine, especially with its affordable price. It was hard not to sell it.

However, he also knew that this wine had just entered the market, and it was only available in Sanshan city. All kinds of advertising plans had not been launched yet. What results could it achieve in a short ten days by word of mouth?

Ling Xiaotian was also very curious.

Li Jing swallowed his saliva and said,””Chairman, Mr. Xia, the 1000 boxes of wine we sent to the major channels in advance have been sold out. So far, we have distributed more than 5000 boxes. Moreover, the marketing managers of many channels that our public relations couldn’t get in previously have taken the initiative to call to ask for goods. A conservative estimate is that we can clear one – third of the inventory this month!”

Ling Xiaotian couldn’t help but take a deep breath. Even though he was mentally prepared for the sales volume, the result was still beyond his expectations. Even Xia ruofei looked a little excited.

“Chairman, there’s even better news.” “The administration department of Sanshan city also called me. They wish to order a batch of Drunken Eight Immortals from the factory as their designated wine for official reception. I’ve already agreed to supply the wine at the agreed price of 138 Yuan per bottle. I’ve also sent the contract to director Wang of the administration department. After the procedures are completed, we can officially sign the contract!”

Ling Xiaotian couldn’t help but slap his thigh and said happily,””Well done! Li, it seems that I was right to send you to the winery to manage the sales!”

Li Jing felt a wave of guilt wash over him. He was completely helpless in the face of the initial sales difficulties. Even now, he still didn’t know what was going on, but drunken eight immortal had somehow become popular.

So he said humbly,”Chairman, it’s all because our products are good ...”

Ling Xiaotian waved his hand and said,”I used to work in sales when I was young. I know that this is not an easy job. I have to beg for help. It has been hard on your sales department during this period!”

Li Jing almost burst into tears when he heard that. A confidant!

Although Ling Xiaotian looked very boorish, he had a way of winning people’s hearts.

Ling Xiaotian thought for a moment and said,”little li, go back and inform everyone that we must fight a beautiful battle in the first month!” When the final sales figures are out, everyone in the factory will get a reward!”

“Yes! Thank you, Chairman!” Li Jing said excitedly.

Xia ruofei’s mind started to race. He did not expect drunken eight immortal to be so successful. Now that his farm was in the midst of constructing infrastructure, he needed money. The increase in sales from the winery would undoubtedly relieve the financial pressure.

Although the first batch of Drunken Eight Immortals was the most ordinary one – month wine, it was still priced at 150 yuan a bottle.

The 100 tons of wine were bottled into 200000 bottles and more than 30000 boxes.

If all of them were sold, the sales would reach more than 30 million Yuan.

The profits of wineries were quite high, many of which were more than 30%. The Dingfeng wine factory was even more so. The Drunken Eight Immortals wine had not invested much in its craftsmanship or cost. It had been reborn entirely because of the spirit map space. In addition, there had not been much advertising in the early stages. Therefore, the profit was very likely to reach more than fifty percent, which was a conservative estimate of about fifteen million.

Of course, the Drunken Eight Immortals wine was only being sold in the three mountains region at the moment. It was impossible to digest all 100 tons of wine in a month.

However, according to Li Jing’s estimation, even if one – third of the inventory was consumed, it would still bring in a profit of at least five million Yuan. Xia ruofei would get 2.5 million Yuan, which would be enough to support the construction of the project for a long time.

And this was only the first month, and it was just the most ordinary one – month wine.

Xia ruofei had no doubt that by the time drunken eight immortal finished selling all the 30000 – plus bottles of the potion, they would be sold out, and the supply would be in short supply every month.

By then, Xia ruofei would be able to get about eight million Yuan from the monthly profits of Eight Immortals drunk.
