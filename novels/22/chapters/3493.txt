Chapter 3494: Holy Land for cultivation (2)

Translator: 549690339

The highest heaven formation was a very powerful formation that could assist in cultivation. On the fifth level of the trial Pagoda, Xia ruofei had solved the function of this formation with perfect results. That was why he had received this set of formation flags as a reward.

Xia ruofei had personally experienced the magic of this formation when he was on the fifth level of the trial Pagoda.

Not only did it have a powerful function of gathering spiritual energy, but it also had a very obvious effect of focusing one‚Äôs mind when cultivating in the array. In addition, it could also silently temper one‚Äôs body and increase one‚Äôs mental power. It was simply too heaven ‚Äì defying.

With such a set of arrays, coupled with the Taixu xuanqing array, it could be said without exaggeration that this building on Paradise Island was definitely more suitable for cultivators to cultivate than any other cultivation Holy Land in the cultivation world.

Xia ruofei carefully surveyed the surrounding environment of the building. At the same time, he also felt the concentration of spiritual Qi in the area under the operation of the Taixu xuanqing formation.

Then, he simulated it in his mind and threw out this set of array flags with a wave of his hand.

Under the control of Xia ruofei‚Äôs spiritual energy, the array flags landed in their respective positions accurately.

A few stone pillars rose from the ground.

Using array flags to set up the highest heaven formation would not be like the fifth level of the trial Pagoda, where the area of the array would be filled with stone pillars. This was like a miniature version of the stone pillar array, but it did not lack any functions.

Xia ruofei took out a few crystals from the spirit map space and threw them out skillfully. These crystals were accurately embedded into the grooves on the stone pillars.

After Xia ruofei checked it, he used his spiritual power to communicate with the core of the formation and started the Luotian formation with familiarity.

Instantly, an invisible aura enveloped the entire building.

The outer Taixu xuanqing formation also trembled slightly, but it quickly regained its calm.

As expected, as long as he adjusted it properly, the two formations could be used together without any problems.

Xia ruofei couldn‚Äôt help but show a trace of pride on his face. He looked at the building in front of him. A Holy Land for cultivation had been born just like that. However, it didn‚Äôt look like a paradise or the abode of an immortal. Instead, it looked like a modern building, which was a little strange.

While Xia ruofei was still admiring his masterpiece, Luo Qingfeng was the first to fly out of the building on his flying sword.

With an excited expression, he respectfully asked,‚Äù‚ÄùMaster! Is this your new formation?‚Äù

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile and said,‚Äù‚ÄùYou were cultivating just now, right? How was it? How do you feel about the effect?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is unbelievable!‚Äù Luo Qingfeng said excitedly,‚Äùthere is such a magical array in this world? Master, I feel that as long as I‚Äôm within the range of the formation, there‚Äôs an invisible force tempering my physical body at all times, and my mental energy seems to be slowly growing on its own! In addition, the effect of clearing the mind is extremely good, and the efficiency of cultivation can be greatly improved!‚Äù

Xia ruofei laughed.‚ÄôThis is an auxiliary cultivation formation that I got from the secret realm. Its effect is unparalleled!‚Äù

Li Yifu and the others were Qi refinement cultivators, so their senses were not that sharp. However, Qingfeng Luo could really feel the huge difference between before and after.

In comparison, the spiritual energy that had become denser after the layering had become the most insignificant function that was least paid attention to.

In Qingfeng Luo‚Äôs opinion, the most precious thing was naturally the nourishment of the spirit body, the improvement of the spiritual power, and the tempering of the physical body. Of course, the refreshing and concentrating effect was also very rare. For cultivators, this was the best treasure to improve the efficiency of cultivation!

In particular, the improvement of his mental power, the nourishment of his spirit body, and the tempering of his physical body were all going on at all times.

In other words, even if one were to lie down and sleep within the array‚Äôs range, one would find that they had been improved the next day. Moreover, it was the most difficult to improve their spiritual power and physical strength!

This was too heaven ‚Äì defying!

Xia ruofei let the Taixu xuanqing formation run for a while. At the same time, he tried to activate the different functions of the formation and patiently tested the modified formation.

Although he was very confident in his array skills, the Taixu xuanqing array was, after all, arranged on the basis of a natural array. Moreover, the changes just now were actually quite large. Therefore, he still carefully adjusted every function to ensure that there were no problems with the operation of the array and that it met his requirements.

The formation had been running for about ten minutes. Xia ruofei checked all the functions and nodded in satisfaction.

Then, he adjusted the Taixu xuanqing formation to its Daily Alert state, took out the set of formation flags of the highest heaven formation, and prepared to set up the highest heaven formation around the building.
