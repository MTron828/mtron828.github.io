Chapter 936: Is your tone big?

Translator: 549690339

Brodie’s maniacal laughter came to an abrupt end, as if his throat had been choked.

He looked suspiciously at Liang Qichao, who had just walked over with a dark face, and a hint of fear flashed in his eyes.

Brodie naturally knew who Liang Qichao was.

Paradise Farm was one of the top quality farms in the Hunter Valley area. It covered an area of 6000 hectares, which was equivalent to dozens of Golden Oak wineries.

Of course, the business model of a farm and a winery was different, and it couldn’t be judged just by the size of the land.

What really made Brodie apprehensive was the background of Paradise Farm.

The farm owners and winery owners in the Hunter Valley area all knew that although Paradise Farm was an independent company, it was backed by the United States ‘shengbang group.

Compared to the shengbang group, which was like a financial aircraft carrier with tens of billions of dollars in volume, the Golden Oak winery was like an ant in front of an elephant. They were not on the same level at all.

Of course, shengbang group was shengbang group, and Paradise Farm was Paradise Farm. The two were only related and could not be compared.

Moreover, although shengbang group had been doing global operations, their headquarters were far away in the United States. Their influence in Australia, especially in the Hunter Valley area, was naturally not as strong as that in the United States.

Brodie wasn’t scared witless by Liang Qichao’s words. He frowned and asked,””Liang, I didn’t offend Paradise Farm. Is he your friend?”

Liang Qichao had been nearby, and he had immediately come over when he saw the tense situation. He had heard Brodie’s insults, so he didn’t give Brodie a good look.

Liang Qichao said coldly,”Brody, I have to correct you. Not only is Mr. Xia ruofei my friend, but he’s also a major shareholder of Paradise Farm. You said that you didn’t offend Paradise Farm. I don’t think so!”

Liang Qichao’s words were like thunder. Not only was Brodie dumbfounded, but Zheng Peng and tan Lili were also so shocked that their eyes and mouths were wide open. They were like two clay sculptures.

Paradise Farm was very famous in the Hunter Valley area. It was also one of the few farms and wineries that were not open to visitors. Even tan Lili had heard that the owner of Paradise Farm was a super rich man. When he bought the farm, it was just a casual purchase. Therefore, the farm was considered private land, unlike other farms and wineries that were open to tourists.

Now, Liang Qi actually said that Xia ruofei was the major shareholder of Paradise Farm. Could he be that super – rich man? Even if he wasn ‘t, he must have a close relationship with that rich man.

Zheng Peng and Brody both knew that Paradise Farm was backed by shengbang group, and they shuddered.

But Brodie still forced himself to say,””Liang, even if this Mr. Xia is the major shareholder of Paradise Farm, isn’t it a little too arrogant and overbearing for him to say that he’s going to shut down our Golden Oak winery?”

Brody didn’t think that he was the one who arrogantly said he would bankrupt West first.

Some people could only see others in the wrong, while they were always right.

Liang Qichao said coldly,”you’ll find out soon enough.” By the way, I forgot to tell you that Mr. Xia is not only a major shareholder of Paradise Farm, but also a good friend of Mr. Tang He of shengbang group. I think as long as Mr. Xia asks, Mr. Tang He should be very happy to help him kill some annoying flies!”

Brodie’s heart sank. If shengbang group really wanted to deal with a mere Golden Oak winery, it would be a piece of cake. The resources that such a huge and domineering consortium could mobilize were too terrifying. They had no chance to resist at all.

Brodie’s expression changed several times, and he finally couldn’t help but step forward and say,””Mr. Xia, I’m sorry. I offended you just now. I hope you ...”

“Brother Liang, Qiao’ er, let’s go get some food!” Xia ruofei didn’t even look at Brody. He turned around and left with Liang Qichao and Lin Qiao, leaving Brody standing there blankly, his face red and white.

Brodie looked at Xia ruofei’s departing figure. A trace of regret flashed in his eyes, but it was quickly replaced by a venomous expression.

Zheng Peng and tan Lili also looked at Xia ruofei’s back in awe. They didn’t even have the mood to compete. If Xia ruofei was only the owner of West Winery, Zheng Peng would have a sense of superiority. After all, Wilkinson winery was larger in scale. However, Xia ruofei was a major shareholder of Paradise Farm and even had a good relationship with a legendary rich man like Tang He. Wilkinson winery was not even worth mentioning in his eyes.

After a long while, Zheng Peng said carefully,””Mr. Brody, I think they’re just trying to scare you. Even if shengbang United States really wants to deal with the Golden Oak winery, it won’t be easy. The Golden Oak winery is in the wine industry, and has no business intersection with shengbang group ...”

Brody nodded and said,”yes!” I don’t believe that Chinese man has that much influence! It’s impossible for Tang He to mobilize such a huge amount of resources to deal with our winery for such a young man. It’s impossible!”

Brodie seemed to be talking to Zheng Peng, but it sounded more like he was encouraging himself.

“Yes, yes, yes, he must be bluffing!” Zheng Peng quickly agreed.

Brodie glanced at Zheng Peng and said indifferently,””Zheng, I’m a little tired. I need to go and rest for a while. Please excuse me!”

Zheng Peng quickly nodded and said,””Alright, alright. Take care, Mr. Brody ...”

……

“Ruofei, why did you guys fight with Brodie?” Liang Qichao asked.

Xia ruofei said calmly,”he tried to hit on Qiao’ er as soon as he came up. Then, he said that he looked down on us Chinese. He even said that he would bankrupt my West Winery. I couldn’t help but say a few words to him.”

Lin Qiao also said angrily,”I don’t think the father and son are good people!” Brother ruofei, I almost couldn’t help but scold him just now!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”I’ll take care of this. You have to pay attention to your ladylike image!”

“I don’t want to! If he had continued to pester me shamelessly, I would have definitely scolded him!” Lin Qiao pouted and said.

The undisguised lust in Brodie’s eyes only made Lin Qiao feel a little annoyed. However, he ridiculed the Chinese and threatened Xia ruofei, which made Lin Qiao loathe him from the bottom of her heart.

Liang Qichao’s eyes turned cold as he asked,””Ruofei, do you want me to report this to your grandfather?”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.”There’s no need for that now. It’s just a Golden Oak winery. There’s no need for Mr. Tang to personally ask about it.”

Liang Qichao was stunned for a moment before he said,”do you have another way?” This is Australia, not China! Also, although our Paradise Farm is much bigger than the Golden Oak winery, strictly speaking, we are not in the same industry. It won’t be easy to deal with their winery. On the contrary, if the Golden Oak tree were to target your West Winery, you wouldn’t be able to escape!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”don’t worry!” If I really need help, I won’t stand on ceremony with elder Tang, let alone you!”

“That’s good!” Liang Qichao grinned and said,”as long as you know what you’re doing!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Brother Liang, I saw you talking to a lot of people just now. Did you get anything?”

Liang Qichao got excited and said,””The harvest is really not small! I just talked to the person in charge of the Mei ya group’s Hunter Valley area, and he’s very interested in our paradise vegetables. He said that when we start to mass produce vegetables in the future, he can help us promote it in the supermarket. He also gave us a lot of autonomy in the pricing!”

Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows in surprise and asked,”He also knows about Taoyuan vegetables?”

“After the first batch of experimental vegetables ripened, I sent some to the people – in – charge of the Hunter Valley area of several major channels,” Liang Qichao said with a smile. “They tasted it in person and gave it a very good review. We’ve only talked about some implications today. We’ll still have to discuss the specifics in the office. ”

“Not bad, not bad! You’re getting more and more into it as a farm manager. ” Xia ruofei praised him.”The next time I see Mr. Tang, I’ll definitely ask for a reward for you!”

“Praise me as much as you want, I don’t mind!” Liang Qichao chuckled.

“Don’t you want your face?” Xia ruofei couldn’t help rolling his eyes.

Lin Qiao couldn’t help but burst out laughing. Then, she quickly covered her mouth.

“Ruofei, have you chosen the future direction of your West Winery?” Liang Qichao couldn’t help but ask. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Mm! The Hunter Valley’s Semillon is well – known, and uncle Carter’s brewing technique is also very good. Our winery’s Semillon is very unique and highly recognizable, so we should be using this wine as our main wine in the future. ” Xia ruofei said.

“I’ll introduce you to the person in charge of the Hunter Valley area of the Maya supermarket chain.” Liang Qichao said,”in Australia, whether it’s agricultural products or red wine, channels are very important. Without the support of channels, no matter how good your product is, it’s useless.”

Xia ruofei wanted to tell Liang Qichao that he knew the boss of the Meya group. Not only that, but his family was also indebted to him. There was no need for him to get to know the person in charge of Hunter Valley.

However, he didn’t want to dampen Liang Qichao’s enthusiasm, so he smiled and nodded,””Alright! It’s good to have a chat with him when I have the chance. ”

Liang Qichao looked around and said,””He’s over there. Let’s go. Let’s go over now!”

Just as Liang Qichao was about to bring Xia ruofei over to meet the leader of the Maya Group’s Hunter Valley area, there was a sudden commotion.

Xia ruofei’s five senses were more sensitive than the average person ‘S. He could hear the voice very clearly. He could not help but frown.
