Chapter 482: Chapter 394 – returning gifts (3)

Besides, the spirit map space had only absorbed jadeite other than the strange black stone. Xia ruofei had tried other jades in the Jade Shop, but the spirit map space did not react at all.

That was why Xia ruofei put the White jade away with a peace of mind.

At the same time, Xia ruofei took out ten portions of jaded skin ointment from the medium. He had brewed more than 30 portions last time and had given away a lot recently. There were still more than 20 portions left. He took out half of them at once.

Xia ruofei found a paper bag and put the jaded skin ointment in it. Then, he carried the paper bag to the door.

“Lu You, I’m really very grateful for this!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”this is for you. You must accept it!”

Lu You didn’t know what was going on, but she was still happy that Xia ruofei had given her a gift.

She took the paper bag and opened it with a trace of anticipation.

When Lu You saw the familiar porcelain bottle, she couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise,””It’s jaded skin cream!”

One, two, three ...

Lu You quickly counted and realized that Xia ruofei had given her ten bottles of Jade skin cream at once. She was so happy that her face turned red.

The last time Tian Huilan had personally called, Xia ruofei had only given her eight bottles, and that included the few bottles for Tian Huixin. This time, he had actually given her ten bottles. This made Lu You very surprised.

Although the jaded skin cream was not circulated much, it had long become famous in the upper – Class circle. Those who had used it were full of praise, and those noble ladies who had seen the extraordinary effect of the jaded skin cream but had no chance to use it had inquired about the news through various channels, wanting to get a portion for themselves.

Unfortunately, the number of people who could get the jaded skin cream from Xia ruofei could be counted on one’s fingers. The noblewomen could only get information about Tian Huilan’s level at most. The jaded skin cream was extremely limited, and Tian Huilan could not meet everyone’s requirements. The rarer something was, the more expensive it would be. This jaded skin cream had become even more precious in the circle.

After all, even Tian Huilan couldn’t ask Xia ruofei for the jaded skin cream again and again. What was she, a Standing Committee member of the Provincial Party Committee, to him?

Under such circumstances, Lu You was given ten bottles of jaded skin cream at once. The happiness she felt could be said to be multiplied.

“So many ... Are all for me?” Lu You asked happily.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Yup! You’ve helped me so much, so this Jade skin cream is a small gift from me!”

“Thank you!” Lu You held the paper bag full of jaded skin ointment tightly in her hands and said happily.

The jaded skin cream was a huge temptation to girls. Even if Xia ruofei gave Lu You the equivalent of gold, she would not be so happy from the bottom of her heart.

Lu You was a little uncertain. She asked,””Xia ruofei, a gift is a gift, but the condition you promised me still counts, right?”

Xia ruofei looked at Lu You’s worried expression and couldn’t help but find it funny. He said,””Yes, yes! This is my little gift to you in return, and it has nothing to do with my previous conditions!”

“It’s bright!” Lu You gave Xia ruofei a big thumbs up and said happily,”thanks!”

Lu You, who had unexpectedly received ten bottles of jaded skin cream, drove back to the city happily. Xia ruofei watched the BMW MINI gradually disappear into the distance and couldn’t help but feel a little emotional.

The encounters in life were really wonderful. When he and Lu You first met, they didn’t get along. As long as the two of them were together, they would inevitably bicker. At that time, even if Xia ruofei was beaten to death, he would not believe that their relationship would become so good in the near future. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Of course, at that time, Xia ruofei would not have thought that the tsundere miss Lu would also smile and would even inadvertently reveal a coquettish expression ...

Xia ruofei sighed with emotion. Just as he was about to go back and continue his research on how to make the spiritual Jade, Feng Jing brought pang Hao and Qin Xiaojun back to the farm from the city.
