2723 Scheming against a golden core cultivator (3)

At this point, Xia ruofei took out a piece of paper and handed it to Zheng Yongshou, saying,””If anything happens, you can call Wang Boshan directly. This mission was originally completed by the two of you. Moreover, Wang Boshan is still waiting for Qingfeng Luo on Peach Blossom Island, so you won’t arouse any suspicion if you call Wang Boshan. There are some code words on it. It’s enough to pass on simple information. Take the time to remember them. ”

Xia ruofei had come into contact with this field when he was in the military. This morning, when he was perfecting the plan, he had also made a simple code comparison form. Through this code form, he could completely meet the needs of simple information delivery.

In fact, it was not complicated. It was just a simple sentence with specific keywords. Different keywords had different meanings. Xia ruofei had come up with several possibilities, such as “everything is as usual” or “change the waterway”.

As for the news that they were departing from the star Seizer sect or that they were about to arrive, Zheng Yongshou could have called Wang Boshan openly and asked him to prepare for the reception. It would definitely not arouse any suspicion.

“Yes!” Zheng Yongshou quickly replied. Master!”

He took the piece of paper and quickly memorized it. After a few minutes, he handed the paper to Wang Boshan and said,””Master, this subordinate has noted it down.”

“Yes.” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”if the situation changes, Wang Boshan might contact you and use the same code.”

“Alright!” Zheng Yongshou said.

After a while, Wang Boshan had also memorized the secret code. He respectfully returned the paper to Xia ruofei and said,””Master, this subordinate has also remembered it!”

“En!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”you guys can go back! Zheng Yongshou will leave today and return to the star Seizer sect. After Wang Boshan sends Zheng Yongshou off, he will come directly to Paradise Island!”

“Yes! Master!” The two of them replied in unison.

Xia ruofei stood up and walked to the deck. He untied the cable of the speedboat and gently landed on the speedboat with his toes.

On the deck of the fishing boat, Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou cupped their fists at the same time and said in unison,””This subordinate will see you off, master!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand without looking back and drove the speedboat in the direction of the Peach Blossom Island Pier.

Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou also turned the ship’s bow and returned to Evarts Island. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

After returning to the peach source Island, Xia ruofei personally led Li Yifu to make some arrangements on the island. They were mainly targeting the points where the Taixu xuanqing formation had been activated. The two of them disguised and arranged each point.

Then, the two of them returned to the project department building and waited for news while they cultivated.

After Wang Boshan arranged the return trip for Zheng Yongshou, he personally sent Zheng Yongshou to the small airport on evatz Island. After Zheng Yongshou’s plane took off, he returned to the evatz Island dock and drove the fishing boat to Paradise Island.

……

Two days later.

In the South China Sea, there was an Island surrounded by spiritual Qi.

This place seemed to be covered in fog all year round. Not only could radars and satellites not detect the existence of the island, but as long as a ship entered the nearby Sea area, the navigation and compass would spin randomly, unable to give the correct direction at all.

Over time, this area of the sea became a mysterious area. In addition, it was far away from the traditional sea routes, so fewer ships passed by here.

The people of the secular world had no idea that there was a cultivation sect in this sea.

This was the star Island, the headquarters of the star Seizer sect.

There was a mountain that was a thousand meters tall on the island, and many antique – looking buildings were built against the mountain. In the dense fog, the pavilions could be vaguely seen, making it really look like a paradise on earth.

The ancient building at the highest point was the residence and cultivation place of Luo Qingfeng, the sect master of the star Seizer sect.

In a quiet room, a middle – aged Daoist in a sky – Blue Daoist robe was sitting cross – legged on a futon with his five hearts facing the sky.

There wasn’t even a strand of white hair on his head, and the skin on his face was quite tight and smooth. He looked to be in his thirties.

In fact, this middle – aged Daoist was already more than 150 years old.

He was the sect leader of the star Seizer sect, Luo Qingfeng, the only gold core realm expert in the sect.

A light knock on the door was heard.

Luo Qingfeng opened his eyes with a hint of displeasure on his face. He raised his voice and said,””What is it? Didn’t I say that no one is allowed to disturb me when I’m cultivating?”

Outside the door, a young and tender voice said with some fear,””Reporting to sect leader, martial uncle Zheng Yongshou has returned. He said that he has something important to report to you, so this disciple is bold enough to ...”

“Yongshou is back?” Luo Qingfeng’s eyes lit up. He stood up and said,”let him in!”

“Yes!” The Daoist child outside the door secretly heaved a sigh of relief and rushed out.

Qingfeng Luo paced back and forth in the room, his excitement evident on his face. From the moment Wang Boshan sent back the news, to the moment Zheng Yongshou confirmed that the island in the South Pacific Ocean had a natural array that was far higher level than the sect’s great sect – protecting array, he had always been thinking about this matter.

Qingfeng Luo knew the importance of this matter, so he did not even reveal it to his most trusted Junior Brother. He only instructed Zheng Yongshou and Wang Boshan to operate in secret and seize the time to control the island.

The two of them hadn’t made any progress for a long time, and now that Zheng Yongshou had suddenly come back to report in person, it was obvious that there had been a major breakthrough in that matter.

Luo Qingfeng thought to himself,’as long as I can get my hands on that cultivation paradise, the rise of the sect will be imminent! He hoped that Yongshou would bring back good news ...

He calmed himself down, then walked to the futon and sat down. After all, he was a golden core cultivator, and his face quickly returned to its usual calm and tranquil state.

Soon, footsteps could be heard from outside, followed by a knock on the door. Zheng Yongshou said,””Master, disciple has returned. I have something to report to you!”

“Come in,” Luo Qingfeng said indifferently.”Let’s talk inside!”

“Yes!” Zheng Yongshou replied.

Then, Zheng Yongshou pushed the door open and walked in. He bowed slightly in front of Qingfeng Luo and said in a tone that was trying hard to suppress his excitement,””Congratulations, master! That matter ... It’s done!”
