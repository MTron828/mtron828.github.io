Li Yifu looked at Xia ruofei, obviously asking for his opinion.

Xia ruofei didn’t plan to be a person behind the scenes. He smiled and said,””Mr. Masker, we hope to get at least 18 sets of spacesuits using the latest technology and the best materials. Of course, it would be best if you can get more!”

Elon Musk had vaguely guessed that Xia ruofei was the mastermind behind this matter, so he was not too surprised. However, he was still deeply shocked when he heard the number.

Just the 18 spacesuits alone were worth about 500 million US dollars.

Therefore, aerospace was a very, very money – burning industry. It could only be developed with the help of a country, and it had to be a country with a strong overall National Strength.

Although Elon Musk was involved in the field of Commercial Space Transportation, he still didn’t have the confidence to enter those high – cost projects, and even so, he was still reducing the cost. The booster recovery technology was also to save costs.

Obviously, Xia ruofei’s needs were not limited to this. He paused for a moment and continued,””In addition to as many EVA spacesuits as possible, we also need enough oxygen supply modules. We also need these oxygen supply modules to be easy to replace. The demand for this is relatively large. Simply put, it needs to be able to support nine adults for two months of continuous use. ”

Elon Musk couldn’t help but be dumbfounded. Generally speaking, an EVA suit could allow astronauts to work and survive in a space environment by hours. How could someone wear a heavy EVA suit for two months in a row? How much oxygen would that require? Based on a rough estimate, if nine people were to consume it at the same time, each oxygen supply module could last for six hours. Each person would need to consume four to five oxygen supply modules a day. Nine people would need about 40 oxygen supply modules a day.

In other words, in order to meet Xia ruofei’s requirements, he would need at least two to three thousand of these oxygen supply modules.

Elonmask felt that his brain could not keep up.

The cost of mass production of the oxygen supply module was much lower than the entire EVA suit, and it did not involve any key core technology. Plus, oxygen didn’t cost much on earth, so it wasn’t a problem of money.

What Elon Musk was thinking was, if these things were to be used in space, how high would the launch cost be if thousands of oxygen supply modules were sent to space with the astronauts? There probably wasn’t a rocket with such a powerful thrust capable of such a task.

What if it was used on earth? What kind of environment would require people to wear heavy spacesuits on earth for two months?

It was important to know that spacesuits were very heavy. On earth, due to gravity, it was difficult for ordinary people to move their arms and almost couldn’t move. Only in low or zero gravity space environments could astronauts move, but they still appeared very clumsy.

Even if he had enough oxygen, he would still starve to death if he wore this for two months on earth! He couldn’t eat at all!

And on earth, why did they need an oxygen supply module? Couldn’t he have just breathed?

The more he thought about it, the more he felt that Xia ruofei’s request was too strange.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Mr. Masker, the technology behind the oxygen supply module isn’t very advanced. The production cost isn’t high either. If it’s mass produced, it should be ready soon, right?” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“There’s no technical difficulty in this,” Elon Musk said with a bitter smile.”I just don’t understand why you bought so many oxygen supply modules ...”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”It’s not convenient for me to tell you this, but don’t worry. We won’t implicate you. The FBI and CIA won’t be able to find any clues.” Of course, the premise is that there are no flaws in the production and transportation links. I think Mr. Masker should be able to do this. ”

Elon Musk nodded with a bitter smile and said,””Although it’s a bit troublesome, I think it shouldn’t be a big problem. Mr. Xia, do you have any other requests? It’s better to say it all in one breath! I’m afraid my heart won’t be able to take it ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”that’s my main request!” Of course, we also hope to be able to purchase your company’s passenger spaceship. If I’m not wrong, it should be called the Dragon spaceship! This name is quite in line with our Chinese aesthetic!”

For cultivators, their ability to survive in space far exceeded that of ordinary people. They didn’t need to prepare space food like ordinary astronauts. They only needed to store enough ordinary food in their storage magical equipment. With simple mental control techniques, they could easily taste these foods in space. They didn’t need to change eating into the process of “squeezing toothpaste.”

If they could buy a Dragon spacecraft from SpaceX, the exploration team members would be able to stay in the spacecraft during the voyage and would not need to wear heavy spacesuits the entire time. This was naturally a better choice.

“What?” Elon Musk was dumbfounded. After a long while, he muttered,”Mr. Xia, you ... What do you want to do?”
