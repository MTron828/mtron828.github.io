Xia ruofei didn’t tell Zhao Yongjun and song Rui who the buyer was. When they saw MA Xiong get out of the car, they couldn’t help but rub their eyes in surprise.

MA Xiong was a world – Class billionaire! Even if he wasn’t a household name, at least Zhao Yongjun and song Rui had heard of him.

“I’m not seeing things, right?” Zhao Yongjun mumbled,”this is Mr. MA Xiong from Hong Kong’s Hengfeng group?”

“It shouldn’t be wrong.” Song Rui knew more about Xia ruofei.”Ruofei has a good relationship with Hengfeng group. I just didn’t expect him to be able to hire old Mr. MA.”

While they were talking, Xia ruofei had already taken a few steps. They quickly calmed themselves down and quickly followed.

“Old master Ma, you’ve had a long journey!” Xia ruofei greeted him with a warm smile.

“Hahaha! I’m not tired at all when I think about the king’s Green square card!” MA Xiong laughed heartily and gave Xia ruofei a warm hug.

After MA Xiong got out of the car, more people got out of the car one after another.

Xia ruofei was a little surprised. Ma Zhiming had also followed them to the capital. Besides them, there was also a white – haired old man in a Chinese tunic suit and a few attendants in suits.

This lineup was too huge! Xia ruofei said to himself.

Ma Zhiming greeted Xia ruofei enthusiastically as soon as he got out of the car. He was now very grateful to Xia ruofei.

Previously, Ma Zhiming’s unmentionable disease was something that even the Urology experts in Hong Kong could do nothing about. However, after taking the pill that Xia ruofei had given him, he began to get better rapidly. Although he was still in the process of treatment, his physical condition had improved a lot.

MA Xiong gave Xia ruofei a brief introduction. The White – haired old man in a Chinese tunic suit was the chief appraiser of Hengfeng group’s jewelry and jade products. His name was Liang Chongshan. The other person was the General Manager of Hengfeng group’s Capital Branch, Chen Zhilin. As for the other followers, MA Xiong did not introduce them.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded at Chen Zhilin. Then, he said to Liang Chongshan,””Hello, old Liang!”

Liang Chongshan’s expression was serious. He looked at Xia ruofei and said,””This is Mr. Xia? I’ve seen the photo you sent to Chairman MA, and with all due respect, I doubt the authenticity of the photo. I don’t think there’s such a perfect glass type of Emperor’s Green jade card. Either the photo has been retouched, or the authenticity of the item has yet to be tested!”

Both MA Xiong and Ma Zhiming spoke Mandarin with a strong Hong Kong accent. On the other hand, master Liang’s Mandarin was perfect, but his words were not pleasant to the ear. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

MA Xiong and Ma Zhiming both looked embarrassed. In fact, Liang Chongshan had volunteered to go with them to the mainland this time because he didn’t believe that there was such a high – Quality King’s Green square plate as shown in the photos. In order to prevent the company from suffering losses, he strongly requested to come to the capital with MA Xiong.

Liang Chongshan was one of the company’s founding members. He had fled from the mainland to port when he was young. It was said that his hometown was Beijing.

Not long after Liang Chongshan arrived in Hong Kong, he entered MA Xiong’s company. At that time, Hengfeng jewelry was still an unremarkable small jewelry store. It could be said that he was a senior figure who followed MA Xiong to conquer the world, so MA Xiong respected him.

On the way here, MA Xiong had repeatedly told Liang Chongshan to be careful of the way he spoke when he met Xia ruofei. He did not expect Liang Chongshan, who had a low emotional intelligence, to express his opinion so straightforwardly.

MA Xiong felt extremely awkward.

Because that would show that he did not trust Xia ruofei. Not only did he bring the chief appraiser of the company, but the chief appraiser was also merciless.

MA Xiong cleared his throat and explained with an apologetic smile,”Xia Sheng, old Liang’s just like that. He’s a little more direct with his words. Please don’t mind him!”

“Yes, yes, yes, Xia Sheng. We have absolute trust in you!” Ma Zhiming also explained in a hurry.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””It’s nothing. I’ll let the truth speak for itself!”

Xia ruofei was not as flustered and exasperated as Liang Chongshan had expected. He felt as if he had punched cotton, and there was an indescribable discomfort.

At this time, Zhao Yongjun and song Rui also walked out of the hotel lobby.

Xia ruofei immediately ignored Liang Chongshan and formally introduced Zhao Yongjun and song Rui to MA Xiong.

MA Xiong would not put on any airs with Xia ruofei’s friends. Besides, Xia ruofei had hinted at their background, so MA Xiong was even more enthusiastic.

Although he had been living in Hong Kong for a long time, MA Xiong knew that the children of the rich families in the mainland were very powerful. Most of the Hengfeng Group’s business was in the mainland, and it was the same in the capital. It was good to have a good relationship with top rich people like Zhao Yongjun and song Rui.

Of course, as a world – Class billionaire, MA Xiong wouldn’t bow down to anyone. However, he wasn’t reserved and the smile on his face became more enthusiastic.

Even so, Zhao Yongjun and song Rui still felt flattered. After all, the man in front of them was a legendary rich man! Furthermore, their base was in Hong Kong, which was different from the businessmen and tycoons in mainland China. MA Xiong’s courteous treatment made them very comfortable.

After some small talk, Xia ruofei led MA Xiong and the rest back to their hotel room in the elevator.
