Two white truffles and two black truffles. Each piece was huge. Before Xia ruofei could speak, there were already gasps from below. Even Monica’s face was filled with disbelief. This was because just by looking at them, those two pieces of white truffle were not inferior to the final piece of truffle at the Grao family’s truffle auction. The White truffle on the right was even slightly bigger than the one they had. It was the same for the two black truffles. The black truffles were smaller than the White truffles, but these two truffles were probably more than 1000 grams. Any of these four truffles would cause a sensation at an auction, but they all appeared at the same time today. Besides, Monica also noticed that there was an even bigger sealed container beside Xia ruofei. The red silk on it had not been removed. It was obvious that it was the finale of the press conference. She couldn’t help but cover her mouth with her hand. As expected, Xia ruofei smiled confidently and said,””Ladies and gentlemen, the second batch of items will be these four truffles. I hope that we will not disappoint you. Of course, even if these four truffles can’t satisfy your needs, it’s fine. I believe that our grand finale will definitely surprise everyone!” After that, Xia ruofei handed the microphone to the auctioneer and walked down the stage. The auction for the giant truffle officially began. The first item on the stage was a 1100 – gram black truffle with a starting price of 10000 dollars. Black truffles of this size were very rare, so the price skyrocketed at the beginning of the auction. Many people who felt that they could not compete for the White truffle focused their attention on the two black truffles. In a short while, the price of the black truffle had reached 30000 dollars. In the end, the black truffle was sold for 33000 dollars. The second piece of black truffle weighed 1300 grams, and the final price was as high as 50000 dollars. After the two black truffles were sold, the auction for the White truffle finally began. The auctioneer placed the first piece of truffle on the electronic scale. The big screen displayed the scale’s reading in real – time,”1.46 kg!” It was exactly 0.01 kg heavier than the one the Grao family had auctioned off previously. With a boom, the audience immediately boiled over. “God, the record for the largest white truffle of the year was broken again in just half an hour!” “Unbelievable, this is simply unbelievable!” “I can’t believe what kind of record will be set in the subsequent auctions!” …… The experienced auctioneer waited for everyone’s exclamations and discussions to gradually die down before he said,””1.46 kilograms of premium white truffle. The starting price is 100000 dollars, and each bid must be no less than 5000 dollars. Let the bidding begin!” The auctioneer didn’t say any provocative words, because he knew very well that there was no need for him to incite at this moment. Everyone’s enthusiasm had completely boiled over. Sure enough, as soon as his voice fell, the bidding sounds rang out one after another. ” 150000 dollars!” ” 180 thousand dollars!” “Two hundred thousand!” Although the minimum bid was 5000 dollars, the guests who had just gone through the last auction raised the bid by tens of thousands. It was not until the price reached 300000 dollars that the momentum of the bidding began to slow down. After all, in the last auction, the price of the White truffle was a little high. However, at this moment, MA Xiong made his move again. He raised the sign in his hand and said,” 350 thousand dollars!” Then, he smiled and explained,””At Ms. Grasso’s auction just now, I offered $350000 for a white truffle of the same weight. Xia Sheng is my good friend, so I can’t favor one over the other!” MA Xiong’s words caused a burst of laughter. Many people looked at Xia ruofei enviously. This young man must be very lucky to have the support of a world – Class rich man like MA Xiong! After MA Xiong made this bid, everyone gave him face and didn’t raise the price any further. In fact, this was the limit of the price. If they raised it any higher, they would be seen as a spendthrift. As a result, the first piece of white truffle, which weighed 1.46 kilograms, was successfully sold for $350000. When the auctioneer went to get the second piece of truffle, Xia ruofei picked up the microphone and said with a bitter smile,””Mr. MA, can you take a break for the next auction and not bid? You’ve already gotten two pieces of top – grade white truffle today, shouldn’t you leave some for others? You see, once you bid, no one else dares to compete with you!” The guests in the audience burst into laughter. Many of them felt that Xia ruofei had spoken their minds. With MA Xiong’s wealth, no one could compete with him if he was determined to compete. “Sure!” MA Xiong laughed. Xia Sheng, if it doesn’t reach your ideal price, you can’t blame me anymore!” “Thank you, thank you!” Xia ruofei cupped his hands and said,”I definitely don’t blame you ...” In fact, Xia ruofei was very grateful. He knew very well that MA Xiong had set a benchmark. The price of the first piece of white truffle was the same as the one from the Grasso family. In MA Xiong’s mind, Xia ruofei’s truffle was not inferior to the one from the Grasso family. With such a standard, the following auctions would have a reference. Besides, Xia ruofei did not want MA Xiong to spend any more money. With MA Xiong’s wealth, it would be easy for him to buy his truffles at ten times the price. However, it would lose the meaning of the auction and would be a favor to him. This was not the result Xia ruofei wanted. The auctioneer placed the second piece of white truffle on the electronic scale. From the outside, it looked slightly bigger than the first piece, so everyone was waiting for the result with anticipation. Sure enough, the reading of the electronic scale was displayed on the big screen: 1.53 kg. He had once again broken the record for the largest white truffle of the year. However, by now, everyone had already developed a certain level of immunity. Although they were still exclaiming in surprise, at least there were no more exaggerated exclamations. “That’s right,” the auctioneer said with a smile.”This white truffle weighs 1.53 kilograms. It’s also the largest truffle produced this year so far.” The auctioneer emphasized the word “currently”. Many people could hear it, and the answer was obvious. Everyone’s eyes fell on the only sealed container on the stage that was covered by red silk. The auctioneer quickly announced the price of the truffle.””The starting price is 150000 dollars, and each increment must not be less than 5000 dollars. The bidding starts now!”
