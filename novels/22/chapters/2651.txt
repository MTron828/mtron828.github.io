2652 Using the chess pieces (2)

The content of the message was also what he had agreed on with Liu chengfeng.

There was a hidden meaning in the stock code. Liu chengfeng could tell at a glance that the set of stock code that Xia ruofei had chosen today meant that it was relatively urgent. After he received the text message, he would call Xia ruofei as soon as possible to ensure his safety.

After sending the text, Xia ruofei carried his backpack and got off the plane.

Liu An led the flight crew to stay in Jinling. The plane was parked at Lukou airport for necessary maintenance, and the crew was staying in a nearby hotel.

Xia ruofei’s phone rang just as he left the airport’s restricted area.

Xia ruofei took it out and glanced at the number. He immediately picked up the call as he walked out.”Chengfeng, is it convenient to talk now?”

“Master, I’m doing something near the sect.” “What can I do for you?” Liu chengfeng asked respectfully.

Xia ruofei had already walked out of the airport. He walked to a place with fewer people and asked in a low voice,””I need to confirm something with you. Do you know stars Corporation? Is this company established by a cultivation sect in the secular world?”

“Stars Corporation?” Liu chengfeng was slightly taken aback, but he immediately replied,”master, the star Seizer sect’s company in the secular world is called stars Corporation. If they don’t have the same name ...”

Xia ruofei’s heart sank and he said,”It shouldn’t be the same name ... Star Seizer sect ... Is the person in charge of stars Corporation called Wang Boshan?”

“Master, I really don’t know much about this.” “I’ve only heard about the star Seizer sect’s arrangements in the mortal world,” Liu chengfeng said, somewhat ashamed.

Liu chengfeng immediately added,””Master, I’ll go get some information immediately!”

Xia ruofei said,”no need!” Your primary task is to protect your own safety. If you deliberately inquire about information, it will easily make people feel that something is wrong! Let me emphasize once more, you are not to deliberately inquire about any information in the sect, and it is the same normally!”

Liu chengfeng could not help but feel touched. Under the effect of the soul seal, his loyalty was already very high. Furthermore, Xia ruofei had never treated him as a chess piece that could be sacrificed at will and had even helped him improve his cultivation. This made him even more loyal to the Wufu soul seal. It could only control people and would not make them lose their minds. Their basic judgment was still the same as normal people.

“I understand, master!” Liu chengfeng was touched.”Don’t worry, I’ll protect myself!”

Liu chengfeng continued,”however, the sect has a collection of information about the other sects. It’s very safe for me to read this information ... This time, because my cultivation has improved, the sect has paid more attention to me. I’ve also started to take charge of some Affairs. I can come into contact with this information often during my work. It won’t raise any suspicion.”

It turned out that the development of technology in the secular world had also brought some changes to the sect. For example, in the fallen leaves sect where Liu chengfeng was, many people used mobile phones, and the sect also bought some computers. Although they could not connect to the internet, they could be used to store some information. Not being able to connect to the internet was just right to ensure the security of the information.

Of course, it was impossible to store cultivation techniques in a computer. In fact, better cultivation techniques could not be converted into electronic documents. They could only be stored in Jade storage media.

The fallen leaves sect’s computers mainly stored the situation of the cultivation world, information about the major sects, and some spiritual medicine illustrations.

Liu chengfeng had broken through one level this time, and was considered one of the higher leveled disciples in this generation of the falling leaves sect. He had also spent less time to reach the eighth Qi layer from the seventh Qi layer. The elders of the sect all thought that Liu chengfeng’s talent was a late bloomer, and now it had finally burst out. Therefore, the sect paid more attention to him and gave him more power.

The elders of the falling leaves sect naturally didn’t know that Liu chengfeng had spent more than ten days in the spirit map’s space where time flowed thirty times faster than the original level. The density of spirit Qi in the environment was far greater than even the core cultivation grounds of the falling leaves sect. After staying in such an environment for more than a year, how could he not have broken through?

Liu chengfeng was now in charge of a lot of basic work in the fallen leaves sect, including the management of the computer room. Liu chengfeng had more contact with the secular world. He knew how to use mobile phones and computers. The work in the computer room could be said to be important, since the computer had a lot of important information. It was also true that it was not important, after all, it was the same logic as the data room in the secular world. Liu chengfeng’s position was simply a Data Manager, but he could manage the computer room in the sect. It was also a symbol of status.

Because of this, Liu chengfeng could access the information openly. The computer also needed to be maintained, and the information in the computer needed to be sorted and sorted out. The information that the sect disciples found out needed to be entered and supplemented in time. These were all Liu chengfeng’s duties.

After hearing Liu chengfeng’s explanation, Xia ruofei was relieved. At the same time, he felt a little surprised. It was as if the heavens were helping him. Liu chengfeng was in charge of this job, so naturally, he could get in touch with more things about the cultivation world and collect more information.

Xia ruofei said,”that’s fine. Help me understand the star Seizer sect’s situation without arousing suspicion. Also, help me understand the situation with the stars Corporation.” Then find a chance to go out and send it to me by email. Is that okay?”

Xia ruofei had heard from Liu chengfeng that there was a small town near the fallen leaves sect’s base. Sometimes, the young disciples of the sect would take the opportunity to go to the small town’s internet cafe to surf the internet.

The current cultivation world was not isolated from the world as many people thought. The development of science and Technology in modern society was also affecting them little by little.

“No problem!” Liu chengfeng answered without hesitation,”master, it’s very convenient for me to go out now!”

“That’s good. I’ll be waiting for your news. ” Xia ruofei said,”by the way, since you’re in charge of the computer room, I hope that you can collect and sort out all kinds of information about the cultivation world under safe circumstances. Also, under the premise of ensuring safety, you can pass me this information.”

Xia ruofei had never stopped trying to understand the situation of the cultivation world on earth. Now, Liu chengfeng, the chess piece he had placed in the falling leaves sect, was starting to play its role. Liu chengfeng could easily access all kinds of information collected by the falling leaves sect. This was simply a heaven – sent opportunity!

After all, the fallen leaves sect was the strength of the entire sect and had always occupied an extraordinary position in the cultivation world. Their ability to collect information in the cultivation world was something that Xia ruofei could not compare to.

Liu chengfeng immediately replied,”understood!” Master, I’ve been doing this all along, but there’s a lot of information and I can’t stay in the computer room all day, so I can only use the limited time to organize it intermittently. But don’t worry, I’ll finish this job as soon as possible!”

“You’ve done well!” Xia ruofei said,”first of all, you have to ensure your own safety. I have emphasized this many times. I believe you know that I don’t want to sacrifice you as a dispensable chess piece. As long as you work hard with me, your future achievements will not be limited to the Qi refining stage!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Thank you, master!” “I’ll definitely work hard!” Liu chengfeng said excitedly.

“Mm! Be careful. ” Xia ruofei said calmly,”I’ll wait for your good news.”

After Xia ruofei hung up the phone, he looked up at the sky, and a dark look flashed across his eyes.

If the star Seizer sect really had set their eyes on the Peach Blossom Island, then the situation would truly be quite bad. However, the situation was still unclear. Xia ruofei could not make any judgment based on his guess.

All he could do now was wait patiently.

Xia ruofei would not act rashly before he received the information from Liu chengfeng.

Only by knowing yourself and your enemy can you win a hundred battles.
