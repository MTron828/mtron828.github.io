Xia ruofei drove the car to Liang Qichao’s side. Before the car even came to a complete stop, Liang Qichao opened the car door and sat in eagerly. He asked,””RUO Fei, where’s the White – skinned lunar realm?” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”in the car!” Let’s talk inside!” “Good, good, good!” Liang Qichao said, then stuck his head out of the car window and shouted for the security guards to open the gate. Xia ruofei drove directly to the three – story office building in the immortal meat stall and stopped. After getting out of the car, he went to the back of the car and took out the pot of White Lunar boundary that he had taken out earlier. “Brother Liang, let’s talk in your office,” he said to Liang Qichao. “Let’s go, let’s go!” Liang Qichao said. He had been itching to get the White – skinned lunar plant. When they arrived at Liang Qichao’s office, Xia ruofei placed the White – skinned lunar basin on the coffee table and said with a smile,””This is the White – skinned lunar boundary I told you about last time. Let’s see if it’s good enough for you.” The White – skinned lunar boundary was still kept in a plastic bag by Xia ruofei. Liang Qichao couldn’t wait to open the bag. When the White – skinned lunar boundary revealed its true appearance, Liang Qichao couldn’t take his eyes off it. It was almost perfect, and its leaves were as beautiful as the misty rain. Liang Qichao was mesmerized by it. After a long while, he reluctantly looked away and said to Xia ruofei,””RUO Fei, this white – skinned lunar boundary is simply perfect! I won’t say anything else. If you can think of your brother Liang when there’s something good, I’ll remember this favor! I’ll take this white – skinned lunar boundary. There’s no reference price for a white – skinned lunar boundary of this grade, so I’ll bid 150000! I wonder if your friend is able to accept this price?” The last time, the ice lantern dew was sold for 250000 Yuan, but that was because Liu Minghao lost his mind during the auction and became a spendthrift. In fact, it was not worth that much. Liang Qichao had offered 150000 for the White – skinned lunar realm because he thought it was as valuable as the ice lantern he had gotten last time. Of course, the ‘friend’ that Liang Qichao mentioned did not exist. It was just an excuse. “No problem, I can make the decision!” Xia ruofei smiled. “That’s great!” Liang Qichao said happily,”thank you! RUO Fei!” “I’ll transfer the money to you directly,”Liang Qichao said. “Alright!” Xia ruofei replied readily,”there’s no rush. We can go for a walk when we have the time.” “That won’t do!” Liang Qichao said,”friendship is friendship, and business is business. Money and goods must be settled! Oh right ... It’s still the same account from last time, right?” After getting Xia ruofei’s confirmation, Liang Qichao immediately picked up the phone on his desk and gave instructions to the finance staff of the immortal meat stall. Then, he greeted Xia ruofei warmly.””Come, come, come, have some tea! I just got my hands on some high – grade Tie Guan Yin a few days ago!” The two of them came to the coffee table and sat down. Liang Qichao skillfully picked up the tea set for kungfu tea and began to make tea. Xia ruofei smiled and said,”brother Liang, there’s something I need your help with!” Liang Qichao was brewing tea with his head lowered. He said without looking up,””What is it? As long as big brother can do it, I’ll definitely do it for you!” “I’ve bought a piece of land in the suburbs and I’m preparing to build a farm.” Xia ruofei said,”I heard from Qingxue that your family is in the real estate business. You’re familiar with the design and construction industry, so I would like to ask you to help me with the arrangements.” Upon hearing this, Liang Qichao replied without thinking,””No problem! Tomorrow, I’ll arrange for the most capable manager in my dad’s company to help you take a look. He was the one who helped with the planning and design of My Immortal meat stall. It’s not bad, right?” “That’s great!” Xia ruofei was overjoyed.”Thank you, brother Liang! By the way, I’ll also have to trouble you with the construction work!” “That’s even less of a problem! We have our own construction team!” Liang Qichao smiled and said,”after the planning is done, if you think the budget is acceptable, I’ll let the construction team in at any time!” “Alright! I’m confident in brother Liang!” Xia ruofei said happily,”the fees and such will be based on the market price. You said it yourself. Business is business!” “Haha, sure!” Liang Qichao said. The two of them continued to talk about the succulent plants. Liang Qichao was very interested in the high – Quality seedlings of the Taoyuan meat workshop, but a young master like him naturally couldn’t spend all his time on the internet, so he didn’t make it in time for the release this time. He still regretted it a lot. Xia ruofei smiled and said that he would ask his friend to save a few pots for him next time. While they were chatting, Liang Qichao’s phone rang. He picked it up and said,””Hey...Yes, it’s me...You found one? How big is it ... Oh, only 70 centimeters? Or new material? Those basically didn’t have any core ... Not enough, not enough, far from enough! We all want at least one meter of old material, you have to work hard to look for it ... Please ... Oh, okay, thank you!” After hanging up the phone, Liang Qichao sighed and put his phone away. “Brother Liang, what’s the matter?” Xia ruofei asked. “Hey! “Don’t even mention it ...” Liang Qichao shook his head and said,”I’ve been looking for some gold Phoebe zhennan material, but this wood is so rare that it’s almost extinct. It’s hard to find it!” “Phoebe zhennan?” Xia ruofei’s interest was piqued.”I’ve heard of it too. It’s very expensive, right?” he asked. “Isn’t that so! “Even a small bracelet costs more than 100000 Yuan. The whole piece is even more priceless ...” Liang Qichao smiled bitterly.”But this time, I only need the whole piece. You can’t buy it even if you have the money!” Then, Liang Qichao started to talk about the Phoebe zhennan wood with Xia ruofei. It turned out that the one who really needed the Phoebe zhennan material was Liang Qichao’s grandfather, who was also his father’s uncle. The old man was an United States Chinese. He had left China for the United States when he was very young. After decades of hard work, he had earned a huge family business and had a high status in the United States. In fact, Liang Qichao’s family business was quite big now, and the initial start – up capital was provided by this old man. When people got old, they would start to think about their own funeral. The old man wanted to find a piece of Phoebe zhennan material to make his own longevity material, which was also a coffin, so that he could use it when he was old and returned to his roots. Besides, the old man had no children. Only Liang Qichao’s father had a few relatives, so everyone was very concerned about this matter. The whole family started to search for the gold Phoebe Wood. This was because it was very likely that this would add a lot of points to the old man’s mind. The most realistic thing was that the old man might even be biased in the future distribution of the inheritance. After explaining the whole situation, Liang Qichao asked tentatively,””Ruofei, does your friend who cultivates premium quality meat have any ideas? As long as the wood meets the requirements, the price is definitely not a problem!” There was no correlation between the cultivation of meat and wood, so Liang Qichao was a little desperate. “Brother Liang, is this urgent?” Xia ruofei asked after some thought. Liang Qichao laughed and said,”it’s not urgent. After all, the old man’s body is still strong!” But even if it’s not urgent, it’s still urgent. My father is worried that his cousins will find it first ...” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile and said,””Alright, I’ll ask him later and ask him to keep an eye out for you!” “Alright, thank you, ruofei!” Liang Qichao said courteously. He didn’t have much hope. At this moment, Xia ruofei suddenly had an idea.
