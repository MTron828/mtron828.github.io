Chapter 460: Chapter 387 – you get what you pay for 1

Xia ruofei was shocked. He glanced at the document and looked up at Feng Jing. He asked,””So fast?”

Feng Jing smiled.”Chairman, I haven’t made a comprehensive long – term plan. I’ve just sorted out a few problems that need to be solved. I’m here to report to you.”

Xia ruofei nodded.”Yes, we have our priorities. That’s right.”

He then said,”President Feng, let’s sit down and talk!” I’ll take a look at what you’ve written. ”

The two of them walked to the sofa in the guest area and sat down. Xia ruofei personally poured two glasses of water and placed one in front of Feng Jing.

Feng Rao bowed slightly and thanked him.

Xia ruofei laughed at himself.”My company can’t even gather enough people. I can only do things like serving tea and pouring water myself.”

“I’ve already written that in the report,” Feng Jing said immediately.”The first thing we need to do is to set up the company’s framework and form an efficient and capable administrative team. Otherwise, we won’t be able to carry out much of our work.”

Xia ruofei nodded his head in agreement and started to read through Feng Jing’s report.

Unlike government documents, which were complicated and cumbersome, Feng Jing’s report didn’t contain any nonsense. She went straight to the point.

She sorted out many issues in the report, including recruiting, forming teams, brand promotion, expanding the farm, and so on.

After Xia ruofei quickly looked through it, he raised his head and said to Feng Rao with a pleasant expression,””President Feng, the things you wrote fit the company’s situation very well. You found the main point of the problem and could write such a report in half a day. It’s not easy!”

“Chairman, I’ll give you a detailed report,” Feng Jing said with a smile.

She was holding the same report in her hand. She must have been prepared to report it before she came.

Xia ruofei looked out of the window at the darkening sky and said,””President Feng, there’s no rush for this! You’ve just taken office today, and it’s getting dark. Why don’t we go eat first?”

“There’s no rush to eat. The sooner the company gets on the right track, the sooner we can create greater profits.” Feng Rao insisted.

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. He did not understand the working conditions of senior white – collared workers in large companies. In a cruel competitive environment, many people regarded working overtime as a norm. In fact, Feng Jing had long been used to working overtime. Moreover, she had just taken over today and was at her peak. How could she have the mood to eat when she was handed over to manage such an incomplete company?

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”CEO Feng, the Emperor doesn’t need hungry soldiers!” How about this, I’ll tell Lei Hu to get some food from the cafeteria. We’ll talk while we eat!”

After the staff canteen was put into use, all three meals were prepared for Xia ruofei since Lei Hu and the rest lived on the farm. It was also to make it more convenient for Xia ruofei to eat when he needed it. The staff in the canteen could eat for free. Cao tieshu’s wife would wait for the staff to finish eating, and then she would have Dinner on the Farm before going home.

Feng Rao nodded in agreement. Xia ruofei immediately took out his phone and gave Lei Hu a call, asking him to bring two servings of food to the office.

Feng Jing waited for Xia ruofei to finish his call and immediately started reporting. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”CEO Feng, I’ve told you this morning that you can make decisions on all matters of the company, big or small. How about this? we don’t have to report the less important things. Let’s talk about the important parts!”

“Alright!” Feng Rao nodded. “Chairman, I’ll talk about forming a team first. I think this is the most urgent work for the company. The entire company’s operation is actually irregular now. It may be fine when the business volume is low, but once the business volume increases and the company’s scale expands, there will be big problems with the current model. Especially if we encounter an emergency and need crisis public relations or other similar situations, the shortcomings of our current management model will be prominent.”

“I agree,” Xia ruofei nodded. That’s why I’m looking for you, the General Manager!”

“Thank you for your trust, Chairman,” Feng Jing said with a smile. As for the company’s administrative team, there was no need for a Deputy General Manager for the time being. According to their functions, they were divided into three major areas: administration, finance, and marketing. The administrative part included human resources, customer service, and training. The finance department was mainly in charge of financial affairs; Marketing, on the other hand, included sales, marketing, and e – commerce. “My opinion is that we should first recruit the three directors of administrative finance and marketing. In addition, we should recruit three to five staff members for each department. The framework of the company can be almost set up. As the company expands, we’ll further refine the work of each department and do it step by step. ”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””Director Feng, I already have a suitable candidate for the financial director. It’s a classmate of mine. Since the establishment of the company, he has been helping me with the financial work. However, he has never done any professional financial work in a big company, so I hope you can help him. ”

“Alright,” Feng Rao immediately replied. Then, when we are recruiting finance staff, we can consider recruiting those with strong abilities, preferably those with experience in big companies. As a director, you only need to have good management skills and a certain degree of professional judgment. ”
