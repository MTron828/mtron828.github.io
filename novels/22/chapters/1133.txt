Chapter 1134: Priceless (1)

Translator: 549690339

Zhao Yong Jun was stunned and said in surprise,””Ruofei, the king’s Green of the glass type is hard to come by. Besides, this is at least a Jade from the late Qing Dynasty and has a certain cultural value. Are you really going to sell it for cash?”

Song Rui, who was standing beside him, said,””If it were me, I would definitely sell it too. Didn’t brother Zhao just say it was worth hundreds of millions? A piece of Jade can’t be eaten or drunk, it’s more practical to exchange it for money!”

“You know nothing!” Zhao Yongjun laughed. This kind of King’s Green could not be bought with money! Why did he need so much money? When money reaches a certain level, it’s just a number. It’s meaningless!”

Then, Zhao Yongjun turned to Xia ruofei and said seriously,””RUO Fei, do you really want to sell it? You have to think clearly!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”let me understand the market first.” Besides, I’m still in the start – up stage, and I haven’t reached the stage where money is just a string of numbers like brother Zhao said. Money is still very important to me!”

Actually, Xia ruofei had seriously considered it.

First of all, this jade pendant was so precious that it was worth more than a hundred million Yuan. Whether he gave it to Ling Qingxue or kept it for himself, it was basically impossible to wear it. Especially if he gave it to Ling Qingxue, then his safety would become a problem.

Usually, this kind of precious Jade product would be bought and kept by rich collectors.

On the other hand, it would be a waste if this piece of Jade was left for the spirit map scroll to devour.

Now that the spirit picture scroll had devoured Jade, the degree of evolution was very low. It had to be a large amount of Jade or directly devour world stones.

Although the emperor’s Green jade was of high quality, it would only evolve a little if it was devoured by the spirit map. It was not worth it.

If he exchanged it for money, the effect would be immediate whether he invested it in starting a company or investing in a siheyuan in Beijing.

Taking ten thousand steps back, if Xia ruofei really needed a large amount of high – Quality Jade in the future, he could use the detection function of the spirit map scroll to go directly to the distribution center of raw jade stones, such as the Myanmar public market, to buy raw jade stones without restraint.

Because of the existence of the spirit painting scroll, high – end Jade was no longer a scarce resource for Xia ruofei.

Even if it was the rare glass type of King’s Green, Xia ruofei could find it in a large number of raw jadeite stones if he was willing to spend time.

Hence, the king’s Green tile that Zhao Yongjun thought was precious was not as attractive as a pile of cash in Xia ruofei’s eyes.

Zhao Yongjun saw that Xia ruofei really wanted to sell the square plate, so he lowered his head and thought for a while. He said,””Ruofei, it’s very difficult to set a price for such high – end Jade because it’s priceless. If we want to maximize our profits, we’ll have to sell them through an auction. ”

Zhao Yong Jun paused, then continued,””According to my experience, if this big square plate were to be auctioned, the price would not be lower than 150 million!”

Song Rui took a deep breath and shouted,””Damn ... Ruofei is rich! Auction! It had to be auctioned! Do you want me to help you contact your friends in the auction house?”

Zhao Yongjun glanced at song Rui and said lightly,””Young master Song, do you know more people from the auction house than me?” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Song Rui’s expression froze and he laughed dryly.””Then ... Of course, big brother Zhao has more friends!”

Zhao Yongjun said to Xia ruofei seriously,””Ruofei, if you really want to auction it, I can help you contact a few big auction houses in the capital. This King’s Green can be the finale of the auction. Everyone will definitely welcome it.”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Thank you, brother Zhao. I’ll think about it first. If there’s a need, I won’t hesitate to ask!”

Zhao Yongjun patted Xia ruofei’s shoulder and said,””If I wasn’t a little tight on funds, I would’ve bought it ... This is the king’s Green of the glass type! Such a huge jade square tablet, tsk tsk ...”

Zhao Yongjun said with an envious expression.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”brother Zhao, I’m sure you’re no less experienced than me in picking up scraps!” Is there a need to be so exaggerated?”

Zhao Yongjun smiled bitterly.”All the treasures I’ve picked up in my life can’t compare to what you’ve done this time!”

Song Rui laughed and said,”brother Zhao, I told you that RUO Fei is a magical guy!” You’ll realize that he’s amazing in many ways after you’ve been with him for a long time!”

Song Rui’s words came from the bottom of his heart. He was already used to Xia ruofei’s miracles. Whether it was when he pulled elder song back from the brink of death from late – Stage cancer, or when he cultivated the best vegetables, fruits, Chinese medicinal herbs, and even ‘magical weapons’.

In contrast, it was a very normal thing for song Rui to pick up one or two hundred million Yuan from a trip to pan garden.

Zhao Yongjun nodded, then said seriously,””RUO Fei, Xiao Rui, it’s best to keep this a secret. The value of this piece of Jade is too high, and it’s hard to guarantee that no one will have evil intentions. In addition, if qiangzi knows about the whole thing, he will have a bit of a grudge in his heart. ”

It was your ability to pick up scraps in the antique trade. As long as you had a good eye, people would only be envious of you no matter how much you earned.

However, this pair of wood carvings were given to him by Xu Qiang. If he knew that Xia ruofei had found a King’s Green square token, he would probably regret it so much that his intestines would turn green. Although he would not change his words, he would definitely be traumatized.

Therefore, the best way to deal with it was to get rich in silence. This was also a good thing for Xu Qiang. Sometimes, being kept in the dark was also a happy thing. Otherwise, he would probably regret it for days and nights without being able to eat or sleep.

Xia ruofei and song Rui immediately nodded in agreement.

Zhao Yongjun and song Rui were Xia ruofei’s best friends, so they would not spread the news. Xia ruofei did not like to show off, so he kept a low profile and would not publicize it.

Then, Xia ruofei smiled and said,”brother Zhao, if you have time, please help me contact your friend who is selling the courtyard house!” If it’s possible, I’d like to look at a house in the next one or two days!”

Zhao Yongjun laughed,”you’re really going to sell this King’s Green square tile to buy a siheyuan?” That friend of mine is also a collector. I guarantee that if you use this Jade token to exchange for the courtyard house with him, he will definitely agree without even frowning!”

Xia ruofei said,”brother Zhao, I haven’t thought of how to deal with this big square tile yet. Let’s go and look at the houses first!”

“Alright! I’ll contact them in a while!” Zhao Yongjun said readily,”if everything goes well, we can go see the house tomorrow! We’ve all drunk at noon, so let’s take a break in the hotel in the afternoon! I’m going to get a room too!”

“Alright! Then I’ll leave this matter to you!” Xia ruofei didn’t stand on ceremony with Zhao Yongjun.

He sent Zhao Yongjun and song Rui to the door of the room, then closed the door and went back to his room.

Looking at the king’s Green square card on the coffee table, Xia ruofei felt like he was in a dream. He didn’t expect to pick up such a big deal when he followed Zhao Yongjun to pan garden to watch the show.

Xia ruofei had a preliminary plan on how to deal with the king’s Green square card.

Auctioning could naturally maximize profits, but the reason he asked Zhao Yongjun about the approximate price of this jade square plate was because he had other plans.

Hengfeng group’s MA family had a very close relationship with Xia ruofei. Hengfeng group had started out in the jewelry business. Now, Hengfeng jewelry occupied a very important position in the Hengfeng Group’s business sector.

Hence, Xia ruofei had the intention to sell this Jade token to the MA family.

As a leading company in the jewelry industry, Hengfeng group would definitely be interested in this kind of high – end King’s Green jade. A square plate of King’s Green jade like the Kasaya, which was an object from the late Qing Dynasty, could be the treasure of the Hengfeng jewelry store.

Xia ruofei did not mind doing MA Xiong a favor since he had asked for the approximate price in advance. He believed that as long as he could find MA Xiong, the old man would be ecstatic and buy the king’s Green.

Compared to auctioning it off, it was much faster to sell it and earn money. Besides, MA Xiong would definitely not let himself suffer a loss in terms of price.

Xia ruofei was still thinking of selling this piece of Jade to buy the siheyuan that Zhao Yongjun had mentioned!

Although he hadn’t seen the house yet, Xia ruofei was very tempted after hearing what Zhao Yongjun said.

Xia ruofei took out his phone and was about to call MA Xiong.

However, just as he was looking for a number in his contact list, his phone vibrated.

Feng Jing’s number was displayed on the screen.

Xia ruofei did not hesitate and immediately answered the phone. He asked calmly,””Boss Feng, what’s the matter?”

Feng Rao’s voice carried a hint of panic.”Chairman, miss Lu had an accident on set!”

Xia ruofei’s mind buzzed and he quickly asked,””What’s the matter? Is Lu You injured?”

Putting aside the fact that Lu You was Tian Huilan’s daughter and had a special status, Xia ruofei could vaguely tell that this little girl had feelings for him. This made him very concerned about Lu You’s safety.

“Chairman, don’t worry. It doesn’t look like a big problem.” Feng Jing said hurriedly, but she was still a little uncertain.”We’re on the way to the hospital. We still need to do a full – body checkup!”

At this moment, Xia ruofei had calmed down. He had just given Lu You a protective jade talisman. Normal dangers would definitely not be able to harm Lu You. However, he was still a little worried.

“Which hospital are you going to?” he asked immediately.

“Temple of Earth hospital!”

“I’ll be right there!” Xia ruofei said without hesitation,”if anything happens, call me immediately!”

“Alright ...” Feng Jing said.

Xia ruofei couldn’t care less about the king’s Green square card. He picked up his phone and called song Rui.

“Song Rui, are you in your room? Can I borrow your car? I have something urgent to attend to!”
