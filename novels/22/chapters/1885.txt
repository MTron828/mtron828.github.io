Chapter 1886: The distinguished guest (3)

Translator: 549690339

This post was actually quite normal. The title was “Hello, everyone! I’m Xia ruofei, thank you for your support!” The content of the post was nothing more than using Xia ruofei’s tone to greet his fans and hope that everyone would support him as always in the future.

One had to admit that Xia ruofei’s fan activity on Tieba was quite high. Although there were many such posts every day, and 99.999% of them were fake, many people still clicked on it when they saw the title.

After Ling Qingxue posted the thread, she refreshed the page a few times and realized that there were already a few comments. She said excitedly,””Ruofei, someone left a message!”

However, when she saw the content of the message, her small face couldn’t help but fall and she said,””Why does everyone believe it?”

The following posts were all filled with disbelief. Some said that this set of trickery had already been used to it. Some calculated it carefully and said that this was the 386th post on Xia ruofei’s forum that was pretending to be Xia ruofei. There were also some who directly teased her and said that she was Ling Qingxue ... Ling Qingxue was speechless.

Xia ruofei took the phone and looked at it. He couldn’t help but laugh. He said, “That’s exactly what I wanted. He didn’t go back on his word with Cheng Xiaoxiao, nor did he start a rhythm. It’s perfect!”

Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”is there no basic trust between people?” No! I don’t believe it. It was me who posted this, but no one believed it?”

After that, Ling Qingxue took Xia ruofei’s phone.

Xia ruofei didn’t stop him and just laughed.””Wife, don’t try it in vain. No one will believe me because I almost never interact with my fans. I don’t even post much on Weibo ...”

A sly look flashed across Ling Qingxue’s eyes as she typed on her phone,””That’s not for sure. Who said I don’t have a way? Just wait and see!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”sure!” Let’s see what other skills my wife has yet to show!”

While Ling Qingxue was competing with the Tieba forum, Xia ruofei was watching the commotion from the side. On Cheng Xiaoxiao’s side, she quickly helped Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue order their dishes.

She had just finished setting the menu when Bastian pulled her to the side and said,””Cheng, before Mr. Xia leaves, you’ll just serve that table. You don’t have to worry about the rest! We must make sure that Mr. Xia and that beautiful lady return satisfied!”

Naturally, Cheng Xiaoxiao couldn’t ask for more, and she immediately said,””Alright! Mr. Bastian!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Also,” Bastian continued,”add a Burgundian snail for them, and a bottle of 1990 ‘s’ Marquis Wang dry red wine ‘. Just say that it’s a gift from the corner restaurant for our distinguished guests!”

Cheng Xiaoxiao couldn’t help but take a deep breath when she heard this.

She did not expect Bastian to be so generous. The Burgundian snail was a famous dish of the restaurant and one of the signature dishes of the restaurant’s France chef. Not only that, but he also gave the Marquis dry red wine, and it was from 1990. This gift was not ordinary.

The king of the Marquis was one of the most famous wineries in the Bordeaux region. The collection of dry red wine Bastian had just mentioned easily cost thousands of dollars a bottle. As far as Cheng Xiaoxiao knew, this corner Western restaurant only had a total of three bottles of 1990 ‘King of the Marquis dry red wine, and they were not for sale. There was no list of drinks, so customers couldn’t order them even if they wanted to.

Bastian had actually gifted him a bottle. One could imagine how important Xia ruofei was to him!
