Chapter 1623: Present (1)

Elder song and manager Lu both picked up their teacups and took a sip. Elder song praised,””Not bad, not bad! It seems that ruofei’s tea – making skills have improved a lot!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”The Way of Tea is about life. I’m just showing off my skills in front of an expert.”

With that, Xia ruofei also picked up the teacup and took a sip. The unique fragrance of Da Hong Pao assailed his nose, and the tea left a rich aftertaste in his mouth.

The tea that Xia ruofei gave to elder song was of course the best quality. The tea leaves used were all directly cut from the branch of the mother tree, Da Hong Pao. They could be considered the second generation of the mother tree, Da Hong Pao, and their basic characteristics of asexual reproduction could be said to have been completely preserved.

In addition, these tea leaves were personally made by Xia Qing, so the quality was much higher than the Da Hong Pao sold by the peach Garden company on the internet. Of course, even the peach Garden Da Hong Pao sold in bulk could definitely be regarded as the top quality tea. Those tea leaves that cost thousands or even tens of thousands of Yuan per 500 grams could not be compared to the peach Garden Da Hong Pao at all.

“Ruofei, you’re too humble!” Elder song laughed and said,”I’m making tea by myself, but it feels like it lacks a bit of artistic conception. It seems that I’m still an ordinary person after all!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Grandpa song, that’s the feeling of your country!” Xia ruofei said,”a merchant like me is a normal person!”

Although elder song had retired many years ago, as a leader, as long as he didn’t enter the eight Treasures mountain, how could he be completely away from politics? Elder song still maintained the habit of reading newspapers and documents every day. He was also very concerned about the state affairs.

“You child ...” Elder song laughed heartily,”it’s no longer the era where merchants are inferior to others ...”

Xia ruofei chatted with elder song and manager Lu for a while before he remembered that he had not taken out his gift.

“Grandpa song, I’ve brought you a small gift. Please wait a moment ...”

Xia ruofei walked to the side and took out a black jade Bell from his bag. He walked straight to elder song.

Before he came to the capital, Xia ruofei had already decided to give elder song a Jade statue.

Although this spiritual weapon was worth more than 100 million Yuan in du Qinghong’s eyes, Xia ruofei was not stingy with it. In his eyes, this highly respected legendary general was not only a kind elder, but also his absolute idol when he first started the Army.

The main reason was that the statue of Guan Yu seemed to have a strong Jianghu aura, but Zhong Kui was a Famous Door God in traditional culture, so it was appropriate to give it to elder song.

Xia ruofei passed the Jade carving to elder song and smiled.””I got a rare black jade by chance some time ago, so I carved a few trinkets for it. I’ll give you this jade carving of a Bell!”

Eccentric song naturally knew what was good for him. When he saw the Jade carving of the bell tripod, his eyes couldn’t help but reveal a trace of brilliance.

Although he didn’t know that this magic tool was worth more than 100 million Yuan, the rarity of the Jade, its material, and the lifelike carving made it seem like the Jade was worth at least 10 million Yuan.

Besides, the spirit – gathering Jade Guanyin that Xia ruofei had given him had many uses. How could this Zhong Yuan Jade statue be just an ordinary statue? If it had other functions, its value would be even more difficult to estimate.

“Ruofei, you’re asking me to make a mistake!” Grandmaster song said with a bitter smile. This gift is a little too expensive ...”

In the past, elder song accepted everything that Xia ruofei gave him, be it tea leaves, wine, or the valuable spirit – gathering Jade Guanyin. He did not treat Xia ruofei as an outsider. He just treated it as a token of respect from a junior.

However, elder song still hesitated today.

This was because this Jade statue was clearly more valuable than the spirit – gathering Jade Guanyin.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””How could I let you make a mistake? Besides, I’m not asking you to do anything for me. You’ve already retired, so this has nothing to do with the organization’s discipline, right?”

Strictly speaking, Xia ruofei’s words were a bit of an excuse. Even if elder song had retired, how could his influence be underestimated? Moreover, he was not related to elder song by blood. The saying that a junior was filial to his elders was not convincing, even if the truth was so.

Elder song looked into Xia ruofei’s eyes. Xia ruofei didn’t avoid his gaze. He looked at him calmly.

Xia ruofei’s eyes were very clear, without any utilitarian color. Even under elder song’s power, he was calm and composed. As the saying goes, selfless at the bottom of the heart, the world is wide.

Elder song looked at Xia ruofei for more than ten seconds before he smiled.

“RUO Fei, What if I don’t accept this jade carving?” Elder song asked with interest.

Xia ruofei replied without hesitation,”then I’ll take it back!” I can’t force you if you don’t like my gift!”

Eccentric song couldn’t help but laugh.”I thought you were going to say you were going to smash it.”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Grandpa song, are you doubting my intelligence?” This Jade statue is very valuable, why would I be against money?”

Xia ruofei’s casual reply made elder song even happier. He pointed at Xia ruofei and said,””You’re an honest child!”

“Then, are you going to accept it or not?” Xia ruofei asked.
