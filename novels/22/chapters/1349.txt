Translator: 549690339

Zhao Yongjun and the others walked over. Other than song Rui and Liu Jian, there was also a beautiful girl in a light yellow short down jacket. It was Song Wei.

It turned out that Zhao Yongjun and the others had taken a detour to pick up Song Wei.

Song Wei smiled at Xia ruofei and said,”RUO Fei, I came uninvited today. I hope you don’t welcome me?”

“I wouldn’t dare! You’re an important guest that we can’t even invite normally!” Xia ruofei chuckled.

Zhao Yongjun also quickly noticed Tian Xiaojun and the other two squatting by the courtyard wall. He couldn’t help but frown.

However, Xia ruofei was the host today, and Hou Liang and the others had arrived earlier. If there was anything, Hou Liang would have settled it already, so Zhao Yongjun only glanced at it and didn’t ask much.

Naturally, everyone introduced themselves to each other when they met.

The main thing was that Xia ruofei was introducing his girlfriend, Ling Qingxue. Of course, he also introduced Liu Zhe to Zhao Yongjun and the other two. Liu Zhe and Song Wei were already familiar with each other, so there was no need for another introduction.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue knew each other. The last time they had dinner at the lingji private restaurant, the two girls had exchanged WeChat messages.

Therefore, the two of them smiled and nodded in greeting.

After some small talk, the group of people followed Xia ruofei into the private room in the courtyard.

Outside the courtyard, Tian Xiaojun and the other two were still crouching in front of the wall.

Xia ruofei and the others were chatting so enthusiastically beside them, but no one paid them any attention. Except for Zhao Yongjun who glanced at him when he first arrived, everyone else treated them like air.

After the lively exchange of greetings, the courtyard outside became quiet. They could faintly hear the laughter of Xia ruofei and the others in the room with the heater on. Tian Xiaojun and the other two were squatting at the foot of the wall in the cold wind, their hearts filled with horror. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Hou Liang and Xu Zixuan were already big shots that Tian Xiaojun didn’t even dare to provoke in his dreams. He didn’t expect that there would be a few more coming. Liu Jian, Zhao Yongjun, song Rui ... All of their names were like thunder piercing Tian Xiaojun’s ears.

These people were so familiar with Xia ruofei and even treated him as the center of attention.

What kind of person was this?

Why had he never heard of it in Beijing?

Tian Xiaojun was also wailing in his heart.

If he had known that Xia ruofei was so powerful, he would not have dared to set his eyes on the Paradise Corporation even if he had a hundred guts! Just the thought of it was enough to make one feel afraid, let alone foolishly leading a group of people to attack the three mountains.

Not only had he come to the three mountains, but he had also impatiently contacted Xia ruofei through Liu Zhe.

Now that he thought about it, Xia ruofei had treated him like a clown in the room just now! His own clumsy performance not only made him a laughingstock, but the words he said were like water that had been poured out, and could not be taken back.

Tian Xiaojun didn’t even dare to think about how Zhao Yong Jun and the others would deal with him.

“Brother Jun, what should we do?” Xia Ling shivered in the cold and asked helplessly.

Tian Xiaojun said in annoyance,”you’re asking me, but who the F * ck should I ask?” I don’t even know what to do now!”

“Brother Jun, why don’t we ... Go in and apologize and plead for mercy?” Zhong Zixin said in a low voice.

She really couldn’t stand it anymore. In order to look pretty, she wore less clothes. The wet and cold climate of the three mountains was completely different from that of the capital. The cold wind seemed to penetrate into her bones, and she felt that her whole body was frozen.

“Apologize now?” Tian Xiaojun said unhappily. It’s too late! Let’s wait! Let’s see what kind of regulations those few Masters will come up with ...”

Then, Tian Xiaojun could not help but glare at Xia Ling and said, “I’ve told you long ago, we’re all people with status, don’t fight so fiercely all day! If you had been more polite, we wouldn’t have offended Xia RUO...Master Xia so badly. ”

Xia Ling opened her mouth innocently, but did not dare to talk back.

However, there was no lack of silent criticism. Before they came, Tian Xiaojun had said that he wanted to suppress Xia ruofei with his imposing manner. However, he had official duties and could not rush to the front line, so the task of “main attacker” had fallen to Xia Ling. Now, Tian Xiaojun was blaming Xia Ling for speaking too harshly and offending Xia ruofei. How could Xia Ling accept this?

......

In the courtyard private room.

The heater in the room was on. Zhao Yongjun and the others had brought six people, including Xia ruofei, Ling Qingxue, Song Wei, and Liu Zhe. They filled up the ten – seater table.

After everyone had taken their seats, the dishes that had been prepared earlier were served like running water.

Xia ruofei was very serious about today’s dinner.

The ingredients were all vegetables from the Paradise. Furthermore, he had also prepared the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall and Chinese perch. These two dishes were still in the process of being prepared and had not been served yet.

As for the wine, he used the best wine on the market, the Drunken Eight Immortals. Considering that Ling Qingxue did not like to drink white wine, Xia ruofei even specially prepared a Semillon white wine that had been aged for a long time in the medium.

This was the new batch of wine he had bought from Old West’s winery when he first went to Australia.

It had only been half a year, but not only was the West Winery now under his name, but even the once – largest Golden Oak winery in the Hunter Valley area had become his property.

Every time he thought of this, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel emotional.

Other than Song Wei and Ling Qingxue, who were drinking half – Lon, everyone else poured themselves a cup of Drunken Eight Immortals wine.

Xia ruofei even said to Song Wei,””I bought this wine from Australia. It’s an authentic semiron from Hunter Valley, produced by an old winery with a history of a hundred years!”

“Then I’m going to have a good taste!” Song Wei said with a smile.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.”I’ve already bought the winery. I’ve also improved the quality of the grapes this year. If everything goes well, we should be able to produce the new Semillon grape next year. I’ll leave some for everyone then!”

“What a nouveau riche!” Song Rui cried out,”you bought the entire winery without saying a word. Do you have to be so pretentious?”

Zhao Yongjun also laughed and said,”well done, ruofei!” We’ll let these country bumpkins experience the domineering power of the Xia country’s tyrants!”

Song Rui immediately said,”brother Zhao, who are you calling a country bumpkin?” Who was he calling a country bumpkin? You’re the country bumpkin, your entire district is filled with country bumpkins ...”

Zhao Yongjun said,”Are you sure?” The people living in our community are all generals, and they are at least lieutenant generals ...”

Song Rui was at a loss for words. He really didn’t dare to respond to that. The old men in the Army were not to be trifled with ...

Seeing Xia ruofei’s friends bickering with each other, Ling Qingxue and Song Wei found it very interesting. They could not help but cover their mouths and laugh.

Liu Zhe, on the other hand, was a little reserved. At the same time, he looked at Xia ruofei with envy.

Hou Liang specially sat down beside Liu Zhe and chatted with him from time to time. After knowing that he had ‘accidentally’ injured Liu Zhe, Hou Liang had been feeling a little guilty.

“Come on! Let’s eat some hot food to fill our stomachs first, then we’ll drink!” Xia ruofei picked up his chopsticks and said,”but don’t eat too much! There will be two more main dishes later!”

Zhao Yongjun immediately said,”yes, yes, yes!” When I was in Beijing, RUO Fei had been bragging about his two dishes to me. He said that we’ve never tried them in Beijing before and that we’ll definitely be amazed by them!”

“I’m really looking forward to it!” Xu Zixuan laughed and said,”brother Xia, don’t blow your own trumpet! Brother Jun, brother Rui, and the others are all experienced and knowledgeable!”

Xia ruofei said confidently,”you’ll know when you try it later!” Come, come, come, quickly eat! We haven’t even touched our first glass of wine!”

Hence, everyone picked up their chopsticks and drank their first glass of wine under Xia ruofei’s lead.

Even song Wei and Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but take a big gulp of the cheese, mainly because the taste of the Semillon was too good. The wine had a rich, layered fruit fragrance, and it left a lasting aftertaste.

After putting down the wine glass, Zhao Yongjun threw out the question in his heart,””Ruofei, what’s going on with those guys outside the hospital?”
