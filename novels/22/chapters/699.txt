Chapter 700: Trial mass production success (2)

The new drug’s production environment and production process were all the contents of the preliminary examination. The environmental hygiene of the factory area naturally had to be clean and tidy.

Although the provincial Food and Drug Administration would definitely not make things difficult for the peach blossom company during the first trial, they still had to do what they needed to do on the surface.

After returning to the farm, Xia ruofei immediately gathered Feng Jing and the company’s middle management, including pang Hao, Xue Jinshan, and the others for a meeting.

The main focus was to research the new drug approval, trial production, and clinical trials.

Xia ruofei sat in the middle and said,””Chief Feng, fellow colleagues, today, I have brought along Jin Shan and finished debugging the production line of paradise pharmaceutical factory. Now, the sterile workshop of the pharmaceutical factory is ready to produce the heart – nourishing soup that meets the standard at any time.”

Feng Rao was very excited,”that’s great!” Chairman, you’re so efficient!”

Adjusting the production line in one day and solidifying the production process, such efficiency was simply heaven – defying.

Of course, this was all thanks to Xia Qing, the “Shennong”. It was because he had tasted it personally time and time again and gave targeted feedback that Xia ruofei could quickly adjust the parameters in a targeted manner.

It could be said that every adjustment was done on the right path, without any detours. This way, the efficiency was naturally surprisingly high.

Otherwise, it might take ten days to half a month to complete the debugging.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”the laboratory data from Kanayama showed that the medicine we produced is basically the same as the heart – nourishing soup that we brewed by hand. I’ve checked it myself. It can be confirmed that our mass production experiment is a success.”

Xia ruofei paused and continued,””I gathered everyone here today to arrange the work for the next period.”

“Chairman, just tell me what you need to do!” Feng Jing said. We’ll definitely do our best!”

......

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”the main work for this period of time is naturally the preliminary review and clinical trials of the heart – nourishing soup. Of course, the daily operation of the company must also be guaranteed. This will depend on everyone’s respective duties.”

“I can’t help much on my end,” pang Hao said with a grin.”But I’ll definitely do a good job of providing logistical support for everyone.”

“Why can’t I help? You’re the God of Fortune!” Xia ruofei jokingly said,”the approval of the new drug and the trial production will require a lot of money!”

“As long as you agree and sign it, I’ll naturally give you my full support!” Pang Hao chuckled. We always only look at the boss’s signature. However, if we spend too much and we don’t have enough liquid funds, don’t blame me!”

“Don’t worry! In the future, you’ll only have to worry about having too much liquid capital, which will benefit the bank!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

He then said,”alright, back to the main topic!” First of all, you have to keep a close eye on Kanayama regarding the approval of the new drug. You can contact the provincial Drug Administration directly and give you full authority over it!”

Xue Jinshan nodded.”I understand, general manager Xia. I’ll contact the Food and Drug Administration immediately and ask them to inspect the pharmaceutical factory. This is also a very important procedure in the preliminary examination.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”during the on – site inspection, they will definitely need to look at our production process and test the medicine that we’ve produced. Besides, the clinical trials will be in full swing soon. By then, Peking Union Medical College Hospital will also need a large amount of heart – nourishing soup. Therefore, the trial production can not be delayed. It must be carried out as soon as possible.”

“President Xia, the workers are all ready – made now. The quality of these workers is very good, and their professional abilities are also very strong. They should be able to take on the job directly after some simple training,” said Xue Jinshan. The parameters of the production line have also been adjusted, and we can start production at any time. ”

“Yes,” Xia ruofei nodded,”but there’s some preparation work to be done before the trial production. First of all, the packaging of the heart – nourishing soup, including the glass bottles that are compatible with our filling and sealing equipment, as well as the packaging box and the exterior design. CEO Feng, let’s leave this matter to the company’s administrative office! Immediately contact the design company and the manufacturer to solve the packaging problem as soon as possible. ”

“No problem!” Feng Rao immediately said.

“Time is of the essence. I’ll give you three days. Can you complete it?” Xia ruofei asked Feng Rao.

“Although I’m a little nervous, it should be fine.” Feng Jing replied,”I’ll get them to work overtime on the design!”

In fact, the main task was still to design the packaging. As for the matching glass bottles and straws, Min Jiang pharmaceuticals had cooperated with a supporting manufacturer when they produced the Chinese medicine soup. He just had to contact them, negotiate the price, and place the order directly.

Xia ruofei nodded and continued,””The second thing is the storage of the required medicinal herbs. This is also of utmost importance!”

Xue Jinshan thought for a moment and said,”director Xia, the initial stage is only for clinical trials. The demand for the medicine will not be too large. We can order the medicinal herbs needed to brew the heart – nourishing soup from large Chinese medicine shops.”

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said,””It’s a temporary solution, but it can’t last long! After we expand our production scale, we won’t be able to solve the problem by ordering from pharmacies. ”

“Chairman,” Feng Jing said,”in the long run, I think we can sign an acquisition agreement with the nearby villagers and provide them with a certain amount of subsidies to encourage them to grow the Chinese medicinal herbs we need.”

Xia ruofei’s eyes lit up and he said,”that’s a good idea!” This way, we will have a stable source of raw materials, and we don’t have to worry about being controlled by others in the future. ”

Feng Jing hesitated for a moment.”Chairman, the only thing I’m worried about is the confidentiality of the formula. It’s very easy for someone to speculate the rough formula from the variety of herbs we entrusted the villagers to grow.”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”first of all, we can ask the villagers to plant a few more herbs and set up a few bewitching arrays.” Secondly, to be honest, I’m not afraid of people knowing the recipe of the heart – nourishing soup. Without the correct ratio, production process, and process, even if others can guess the recipe, they simply can’t make an effective heart – nourishing soup!”

“If that’s the case, then I’m relieved!” Feng ke said.

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said,””Jin Shan, you’ll be in charge of purchasing the medicinal herbs needed for the early stages of the trial production from the pharmacy ... Or perhaps you can go to Tongren Hall! I’ll give you the contact information of Qiantang Tongren Tang’s CEO Lin. You can tell him my name and he’ll definitely give us the best price. ”

“Yes, President Xia!” Xue Jinshan jotted down notes in his notebook as he spoke.

Xia ruofei continued,”as for mobilizing the villagers to plant the Chinese herbal medicines ... I’ll have to trouble you, director Xiao. You’ll be in charge, right?”

Xia ruofei said as he looked at the company’s Marketing Director, Xiao Qiang.

Although Xiao Qiang wasn’t confident, he still reluctantly nodded and said,””Alright,” he said.

Xia ruofei seemed to have seen through Xiao Qiang’s thoughts. He smiled and said,””I’m more inclined to the villages near our farm. I’ll talk to the county leaders later. Director Xiao, you’ll listen to me when the time comes. After I’ve coordinated with them, you can go directly to the leaders in the town and ask them to help mobilize the villagers.”

When Xiao Qiang heard that the chairman would personally coordinate, the trace of concern in his heart disappeared without a trace. He quickly said,”I understand! Chairman, I’ll definitely do my best to complete the mission. ”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it’s good to have confidence!” Director Xiao, Jin Shan will give you a list of the medicinal herbs we need later. Please come up with a proposal first, including the overall plan, the subsidy standards for the villagers, and so on. The more detailed, the better!”

“Alright, I’ll get started on this matter immediately after the meeting is over!” Xiao Qiang nodded. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

After Xia ruofei assigned this task, he looked at Xue Jinshan and said,””Jinshan, before the exterior design and packaging production are completed, you should familiarize the workers with the production procedures and clarify their respective positions. You can demonstrate and train some of the medicinal herbs. My only request is that these workers should be familiar with the process in three days and can start production at any time.”

“Yes! President Xia. ” Xue Jinshan immediately said.

Xia ruofei had said all that he needed to say. Basically, all the work had been divided. He asked if everyone had any other questions and immediately clapped his hands. He stood up and said,”Then, today’s meeting will end here. Everyone, take your places and perform your duties! Dismissed!”
