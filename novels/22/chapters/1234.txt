Chapter 1235: An old friend visiting late at night (2)

Translator: 549690339

It was past oneo’ clock at night.

Monica sat up from the bed with a satisfied expression. She lowered her head and kissed Xia ruofei’s forehead before putting on her clothes.

“Monica, it’s so late ... You should sleep here!” Xia ruofei said guiltily as he leaned against the headboard.

“Mr. MA will definitely come to see you tomorrow morning,” Monica said with a smile.”And I think your beautiful general manager will come early too. I think you don’t want to be found by them, right?”

Xia ruofei’s expression froze for a moment. However, he remembered that Monica had taken the initiative to look for him at around 10 O’ clock at night. It was already the latter half of the night after they had sex. At this time, women needed comfort the most, but she still had to put on her clothes and leave by herself.

Xia ruofei’s heart was filled with guilt. He sat up and hugged Monica, who was putting on her clothes.”Stay! Just sleep here, I’ll wake you up earlier tomorrow ...”

Monica felt her body go soft and she fell on Xia ruofei. She hesitated for a while but still nodded.

Xia ruofei was overjoyed. He laid down with Monica in his arms and covered her with the blanket. Then, he snuggled into the blanket and hugged her tightly from behind.

Although the beauty in his arms was full of seduction, Xia ruofei knew that it was too late and he had a press conference to attend the next day. Hence, he only hugged Monica and whispered in her ear,””Go to sleep!”

Although Monica’s back was facing Xia ruofei, she felt a sense of security when Xia ruofei hugged her tightly with his strong arms. It was as if all the troubles Italy had been thrown to the back of her mind.

Soon, the two of them fell into a deep and sweet dream.

Initially, Xia ruofei wanted to wake Monica up at six.

It was only around 5:30 when he felt movement. The habit he had developed over the years made him always vigilant even in his sleep, so he immediately woke up.

Through his drowsy eyes, Xia ruofei saw that Monica had already quietly gotten up and started to put on her clothes.

“Monica ...” Xia ruofei called out.

Monica was shocked. She turned around and said with an apologetic tone,””My dear, did I wake you up?”

Xia ruofei picked up his watch from the bedside table and glanced at it. “”Isn’t this too early? You can sleep a little longer ...”

“It’s better to leave early,” Monica said with a smile.”It won’t be good for you if someone comes looking for you. I know you Easterners are more conservative. Besides ... If I go downstairs now, I can go back to my room and have a beauty sleep!”

“Alright then!” Xia ruofei said as he got off the bed.

Monica pressed him down and said,””My dear, you don’t have to get up, just sleep a little longer! I can go downstairs by myself ...”

After she finished speaking, Monica stared at Xia ruofei with a smile.

Under Monica’s gaze, Xia ruofei could only nod and say,””Alright, I’ll listen to you ...”

“Be good, close your eyes and go to sleep!” Monica playfully pinched Xia ruofei’s face and said.

Xia ruofei saw that Monica was treating him like a child and couldn’t help but find it funny. However, he still closed his eyes.

Monica chuckled and quickly put on her clothes. Then, she kissed Xia ruofei’s face, who had his eyes closed, and left the bedroom.

Xia ruofei heard the door open, and then light footsteps came from the corridor outside the Presidential Suite.

He knew that Monica had already left.

Xia ruofei opened his eyes. With his hands behind his head, he stared at the ceiling in a daze.

Last night’s madness was still vivid in his mind, and Monica’s fragrance was still lingering on the bed.

He had thought that he would feel guilty and empty after Monica left, but he didn ‘t.

After that one night with Monica in Australia, Xia ruofei was like a child who had done something wrong. Whenever he thought of Ling Qingxue, who was thousands of miles away, he could not help but feel extremely guilty. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

However, this feeling had faded a lot today.

When he recalled the scene last night, he felt a faint warmth in his heart.

Xia ruofei was no longer a Virgin. From Monica’s behavior last night, he knew that Monica had rarely had sex with a man and a woman. She might even be like what she had said half – jokingly in Australia the last time. She would be like a Chinese woman who kept her chastity for him.

Xia ruofei turned over with a complicated expression. He buried his head in Monica’s pillow and took a deep breath. He let out a long sigh in the faint fragrance.

She felt less guilty, but more conflicted ...

Xia ruofei couldn’t fall asleep anymore. He laid on the bed and let his thoughts run wild for a while. Then, he got out of bed and washed up. He changed into a set of sports attire and hung a towel around his neck. He took the elevator to the hotel’s gym.

In fact, Xia ruofei’s current physical fitness did not need the equipment in the gym at all. Moreover, the strength of the equipment would not be of much use to Xia ruofei.

Whether it was the ‘great Dao Arts’ or the little golden man’s body – tempering movements, they were both extremely effective in strengthening and training the body.

However, he might have thought of the first time he met Monica, so he came to the gym without thinking.

The Hengfeng Jiahua Hotel was mainly hosting guests from all over the world who came to participate in the auction these few days. In order to take care of everyone’s living habits and considering that some guests still had jet lag, some of the hotel’s facilities, such as the gym, swimming pool, tennis court, and so on, were all changed to be open 24 hours.

When Xia ruofei arrived at the gym, he realized that there were already a few people working out.

It was only six in the morning.

In fact, Xia ruofei only wanted to sweat. Even if the strength training machines were at their maximum, Xia ruofei felt as light as a feather. So, he walked straight to the treadmill.

Without any preparation, Xia ruofei set the treadmill to 13 kilometers per hour and started running.

This speed was definitely too fast for most long – distance runners, and ordinary people couldn’t hold on for long.

However, Xia ruofei’s breathing was steady. He adjusted his headphones as he ran. Then, he found his favorite music on his phone and played it.

He placed his phone in front of him and put on his Bluetooth Sports Headset.

The reason why he had set this speed was because when Xia ruofei first met Monica, there was a guy who came to challenge Xia ruofei. In the end, he was crippled by Xia ruofei.

It was the same Hengfeng Jiahua Hotel and the same gym. The only difference was that it was in Shen Cheng last time and in Hong Kong this time.

Of course, this time, there was no sexy beauty by his side, and at the same time, there were no annoying flies.

Just as Xia ruofei was thinking about this, God seemed to have heard his thoughts. A white man in Adidas sportswear with a small sports bag walked to Xia ruofei’s side.

Seeing Xia ruofei’s speed, the Caucasian felt that this scene was familiar. He couldn’t help but turn to look at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei happened to look over at the same time. When their eyes met, both of them looked surprised.

This man was Blake, who had been jealous of Xia ruofei at the Hengfeng Jiahua Hotel gym in Shen Cheng. He had almost lost his ability to compete with Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei remembered that this guy was the Vice President of a France food chain, brak group. He had a bad relationship with Xia ruofei during the truffle auction.

Xia ruofei furrowed his brows. This guy had been rude to the Huaxia truffle that he had looked down on at the auction. Xia ruofei had wanted to Sue him for slander, but for some other reason, MA Xiong had helped to mediate. Xia ruofei had thought that it was not a big deal, so he had let it go.

He didn’t expect to meet this guy in Hong Kong again.

Could it be that MA Xiong had also invited the black group to the auction? When Xia ruofei thought of this, he couldn’t help but feel unhappy.
