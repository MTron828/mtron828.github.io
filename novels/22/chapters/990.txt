Chapter 991: Delicious food in the jar (2)

Translator: 549690339

Putting aside Xia ruofei’s relationship with Ling Xiaotian, it was a big deal for a billionaire to cook for him.

When Xia ruofei saw the waiters serving the dishes, he suddenly remembered that he had prepared a Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup. He smiled and said,””Uncle Ling, please take care of Secretary song and the rest. I have also prepared a gift for your opening. Go and get it from the car.”

Ling Xiaotian was stunned for a moment before he smiled and said,””You child, we’re family, so why did you prepare a present ... Besides, it’s not too late to take the present after dinner!”

Xia ruofei laughed.”My gift can only be given before the meal. Please wait a moment!”

With that, Xia ruofei stood up and left the room quickly.

Ling Xiaotian looked at song Qiming and smiled as he shook his head.””This child, she’s keeping us in suspense ...”

“Young people! You’re full of energy. ” Song Qiming smiled and said,”our Weiwei is too quiet. She’s a girl and she likes to study ancient tombs and unsolved cases in history all day long ...”

Song Wei pouted and said,”Dad, aren’t we talking about RUO Fei? Why are you talking about me again?”

Song Qiming laughed and said,”why can’t I scold you?” Speaking of which, you’re one or two years younger than RUO Fei!”

……

Xia ruofei quickly walked through the courtyards and arrived at the parking lot. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

He took out the thermal box from the trunk and returned to flying Snow Pavilion.

“RUO Fei, what is that thing? You’re so mysterious!” Ling Qingxue asked with a smile.

Xia ruofei laughed as he placed the thermal container on the table. He opened the buckle and said,””The answer will be revealed soon!”

With that, Xia ruofei opened the lid of the thermal container and put on a pair of heat – resistant gloves that he had prepared in advance. He then took out the small wine jar with the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ inside.

Xia ruofei had kept them in suspense for so long that song Qiming’s family and Ling Xiaotian’s father and daughter’s attention had long been drawn over. When they saw Xia ruofei take out a small Shaoxing wine jar, they all felt very strange.

Could it be that after all that effort, all he got was a jar of wine?

Only Ling Xiaotian was slightly surprised. If it was just a jar of wine, why would Yingying be so careful to keep it in a cooler box? He also noticed that Xia ruofei had put on heat – resistant gloves when he took the wine jar.

Thus, Ling Xiaotian immediately asked with some hesitation,””RUO Fei, this ... This is the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup?”

The reason why he was a little hesitant was that he felt that it was a little too unexpected for his future son – in – Law to give him a jar of ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’. He was a chef with very good culinary skills. Moreover, Ling Ji private kitchen was a private kitchen Restaurant with the characteristics of Sanshan. It was natural that ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ was on the menu.

Not only did Ling Xiaotian know how to cook this dish, even his disciples knew how to cook it.

Under such circumstances, Xia ruofei would give a jar of ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ as a congratulatory gift? No matter how he thought about it, it felt a little strange.

Therefore, even though Ling Xiaotian had some guesses, he was not sure.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it ‘s’ Buddha Jumps Over the Wall ‘. However, my’ Buddha Jumps Over the Wall ‘is a little different from the’ Buddha Jumps Over the Wall ‘that you guys usually eat!” Since Secretary song is here today, I’ll treat everyone to my cooking!”

Song Qiming said with great interest,””This is the most famous dish in the three mountains! Did RUO Fei personally cook it? Then we’ll have to try it ...”

Ling Xiaotian felt like laughing at the fact that he had been making ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ for decades. This kid actually used a jar of his own ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ as a congratulatory gift? This was really a bit of a loner!

However, he did not want to embarrass Xia ruofei in front of song Qiming’s family. He smiled and said,””I didn’t expect RUO Fei to know how to cook! Then our Qingxue will be in for a treat in the future ...”

Ling Qingxue’s face heated up, but her heart was filled with sweetness. She rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,””How can his cooking skills be compared to yours! I think ...”

Ling Qingxue stopped mid – sentence as a unique fragrance began to fill the room. Xia ruofei had already opened the jar that was sealed with lotus leaves.

Sealing was also a crucial process in making the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup.

Obviously, Xia ruofei had done this almost perfectly.

When Xia ruofei took out the small Shaoxing wine jar, it looked ordinary and the taste inside did not leak out at all. However, when Xia ruofei opened the sealed lotus leaves at the mouth of the jar, the strong fragrance immediately attracted everyone’s attention.

Even Ling Xiaotian was no exception.

He even took a few deep breaths without caring about his image, and his face revealed a look of surprise.

“Not bad, ruofei!” Song Qiming chuckled. Just the smell alone is enough to make me want to eat ...”

“Secretary song, Auntie Fang, please have a taste!” Xia ruofei said immediately.

After that, Xia ruofei called for the waiter to bring a few bowls over and personally served everyone food.

There were dozens of main ingredients and secondary ingredients in the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ dish. There was also some attention to the cooking. For example, precious ingredients such as abalone, sea cucumber, fish pond, and fish glue were naturally required in every bowl. In addition, the special pigeon eggs and pig’s feet were also distributed equally.

Soon, Xia ruofei had filled up a few large bowls. The waiter immediately came over to serve the bowls to song Qiming and the others.

After the stirring just now, the extremely alluring fragrance was even stronger.

Dozens of precious ingredients affected each other, and after the secret recipe of the Chinese medicine, the smell was very special, as if it could arouse the cravings in people’s hearts.

Song Qiming picked up his chopsticks and said with a smile,””Ruofei, then we won’t be polite!”

Xia ruofei stretched out his hand and made a ‘please’ gesture. Then, he picked up a pair of chopsticks and started to cook ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’. This was his first time cooking ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’, and he did not even remove the seal after it was done. Hence, he was very excited to see what it would taste like.

The two youngest sisters – in – Law, Ling Qingxue and Song Wei, were the fastest. Even beautiful women could not resist the temptation of delicious food!

They quickly picked up their chopsticks and spoons, and chose the Tiger skin pigeon egg at the same time. They blew on it while putting it into their mouths. They carefully bit through the skin, tested the temperature, and then took a big bite.

On the other side, song Qiming, his wife, and Ling Xiaotian had also picked their favorite dishes and started tasting them.

After song Qiming tasted a piece of abalone, he immediately praised it. “”It tastes really good! RUO Fei, I’ve tried ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ twice since I came to the three mountains, but it wasn’t as good as the one you made today!”

Song Qiming was the leader of the Provincial Party Committee. Although he had not been in office for a long time, he had attended some Foreign Affairs activities or press conferences to receive foreign guests. The ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ that was served on such occasions was naturally the most authentic. It was custom – made directly from the origin of the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’, juchun garden.

However, just as song Qiming had said, even the authentic ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ from juchun garden did not taste as good as the one he had made today.

After tasting the two pieces of duck meat, Fang Liyun also said a lot of words of praise.

Song Wei, Ling Qingxue, and Ling Xiaotian didn’t express their opinions.

The two beautiful women were busy with their mouths. After eating the shark’s fin, they immediately ate the sea cucumber and didn’t have time to talk.

Ling Xiaotian was even more shocked.

He was the most experienced person today. He had only taken a bite of the fish gelatin in the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup and immediately felt that Xia ruofei’s special gift was different from the rest.

Ling Xiaotian immediately savored the other ingredients carefully. Then, he closed his eyes, revealing an intoxicated expression.

After a long while, Ling Xiaotian finally said,”ruofei, I’m really in awe of you!” I’ve been a veteran chef who has been cooking ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ for decades. I feel like I’ve finally tasted the authentic ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ today ...”

Xia ruofei was a little embarrassed as he said,””Uncle Ling, it’s actually my first time ...”

Ling Xiaotian’s eyes widened as he sighed,””You ... Are too much of a blow!”

A burst of laughter suddenly came from the private room.

Ling Qingxue rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,””Dad, you’re an expert. Tell us what’s so special about ruofei’s jar of ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’!”
