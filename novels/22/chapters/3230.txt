Elon Musk wanted to hang up the phone and reject the call. After all, he was not in the mood to talk business with Li Yifu. Not to mention that Li Yifu’s business was too risky, and he was not interested. However, rejecting the call was obviously very impolite, especially when the other party was a rich man like Li Yifu. If he rejected the call rudely, he might really offend the other party.

Therefore, despite his reluctance, Elon Musk still picked up the phone, but his tone was a little cold.””Mr. Li, what’s the matter?”

“Mr. Mersk, I hope to see you again.” Li Yifu said.

“I’m sorry, Mr. Li, I’ve left Silicon Valley. ” “I have something to do at home these two days, so I’m temporarily away from work,” Elon Musk said. In addition, I think I’ve made my stand clear on what you want to discuss, Mr. Li. It’s true that we can’t cooperate on that project because of risk control. I’m really sorry ...”

“Is Mr. Masker in Los Angeles?” Li Yifu smiled and asked,”I happen to be in Los Angeles too!”

Elon Musk’s expression changed slightly, and he said,””What does Mr. Li mean? You followed me?”

In fact, there were many thoughts in Elon Musk’s mind at this moment.

This was because Li Yifu’s proposal to purchase spacesuits and space equipment was too sensitive. Moreover, Li Yifu’s Chinese identity made it difficult for Elon Musk not to think that the Chinese government was behind this matter.

He had just left Silicon Valley, and the other party had already come to Los Angeles.

This made elonmask wary.

“Mr. Masker, please don’t misunderstand!” Li Yifu smiled and said,”I’m not here to talk business with you. I heard that your child has some health problems, which is really unfortunate. I’m willing to provide you with some medical help. ” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

A hint of displeasure rose in elonmask’s heart.

Obviously, Li Yifu had spent a lot of effort to investigate him. Otherwise, how could he have caught up with him Los Angeles so quickly and even found out about little X’s situation?

Although Elon Musk did not deliberately keep it a secret, this did not mean that he could accept his privacy being invaded.

Therefore, elonmask’s tone became less polite.

He snorted and said,”Mr. Li, what do you mean by medical help?” Mr. Li, do you think that I can’t find the best doctor and hospital to treat little X?”

“Of course I don’t think so,” Li Yifu replied indifferently. However ... As far as I know, the malignant degree of Strigoi is very high, especially your child’s condition, which seems to be more serious. Even under the best conditions currently available, I think the survival rate does not seem to exceed 40%, right?”

“So what?” Elon Musk felt that his patience was about to run out, and his tone became more and more stiff.

“This survival rate is simply a gamble!” Li Yifu said somewhat exaggeratedly,”Mr. Masker, do you think I would still call you if the only condition I could provide was a 40% survival rate, or just a little increase?”

Elon Musk’s heart skipped a beat. He pretended to be calm and asked,””Mr. Li, What do you mean ... With the medical help you provide, what is little X’s survival rate?”

“More than 90%,” Li Yifu said indifferently.”If you don’t take into account some unexpected factors, it’s 100%!”

Li Yifu had full confidence in Xia ruofei’s medical skills.

In fact, he had full confidence in Xia ruofei’s ability in any field.

To put it bluntly, it was blind worship.

After listening to this, Elon Musk couldn’t help but take a deep breath. Then, he came back to his senses. He felt that this was impossible, especially in the eyes of a person who especially believed in science. Everything had to conform to the laws of science, including his son’s illness. Obviously, from a scientific point of view, the treatment plan proposed by Dr. Mannu’s team had reached the top level in the world, and the patient’s survival rate had been raised to the limit. Li Yifu said something like 90% or 100% as soon as he came up. He sounded like a charlatan.

A trace of displeasure rose in elonmask’s heart. He felt that Li Yifu was making fun of him.

“Mr. Li, your joke is not funny!” He said coldly.

“It seems that Mr. Masker doesn’t believe what I said.” Li Yifu said calmly.

“Uh – huh!” Elon Musk said coldly,”does Mr. Li think that your words have a trace of credibility?”

Li Yifu laughed and said,”won’t we know if it’s credible after we try?” You don’t even have the courage to try, and you’re in such a hurry to come to a conclusion?”

“What Mr. Li said doesn’t conform to the laws of science at all, so there’s no need to try!” Elonmask was unmoved.

“Scientific law? Is it a rule that your son must undergo surgery?” Li Yifu sneered.”Does science say that he has to face terrifying chemotherapy at such a young age? Science has also stipulated that there’s a fifty to sixty percent chance that he won’t live past five years old?”

“Mr. Li, please mind your words.” Elon Musk’s face was as dark as water.”Little X has unfortunately contracted this disease. This is something that no one wants to see.”

Li Yifu’s tone became a little more relaxed as he said,””Mr. Masker, I’m not trying to provoke you on purpose. I just want to tell you that there’s no loss in giving yourself another chance to try. On the contrary, it’s very likely that we’ll usher in a miraculous turn of events!”

Li Yifu continued,”I’ve brought a Chinese medical expert here. He’ll treat little X from a Chinese medical perspective.” Our specialist has already understood little X’s condition. He’s very confident in curing this type of illness. ”

Without waiting for elonmask to speak, Li Yifu struck while the iron was hot and said,””Mr. Masker, using the traditional Chinese medicine treatment method, there is no need for surgery, and there is no need to go through the self – harming chemotherapy, so the damage to the body is almost zero. Even if it doesn’t work, you might as well give it a try. Could it be that the situation can get any worse?”

Li Yifu’s last words finally moved Elon Musk.

He hesitated for a moment.”Mr. Li, I don’t know much about traditional Chinese medicine. Can the specialist you brought really treat patients with such a condition?”

“I know this may be hard to believe, but it’s the truth,” said Li Yifu. In fact, the expert I brought here has successfully cured a serious malignant brain tumor. Please note that it’s a cure!”

Elonmask took a deep breath and said,””Okay, I’m willing to try a new treatment method, provided it doesn’t cause any harm to my body.”

“Of course, I can guarantee that.” Li Yifu said.

Elon Musk hesitated again and asked,””Mr. Li, this treatment ... Is it related to the business you talked about the day before yesterday ...”

Li Yifu chuckled and interrupted Elon Musk’s words, saying,””Let’s not talk about this for now. Let’s see the effect of the treatment first. How about it?”

Elon Musk knew that even if the two sides did not sign any agreement, Li Yifu was not a character that could be easily manipulated. If the treatment was really effective, he would most likely have to take the risk to complete this super large order. Otherwise, with Li Yifu’s power in the United States, he would not be able to afford to launch a crazy revenge.

“Alright!” After a brief hesitation, Elon Musk said decisively,”Mr. Li, please bring the medical experts to my Manor! Right, where are you guys now? I’ll send a car to pick you up. ”

“Beverly Hills Hotel.” Li Yifu said.

“OK!””Please wait at the hotel for half an hour!”

“No problem!” Li Yifu smiled and said,”Mr. Masker, you will know in the future that this is a very wise decision. This decision will bring your child a healthy physical state!”
