Chapter 928: Improved grapes (1)

Translator: 549690339

Old West nodded and said,””Alright, then we’ll have to start planning for grape planting this year. We currently have three types of grape varieties, namely Semillon, Tempranillo, and Fiano. We can start planting grapes in September, so let’s change most of the species to Semillon!”

The West winery’s Semillon was their signature wine. It was reasonable for Xia ruofei to focus on this wine after taking over the winery, so Old West was not surprised.

However, he did not understand why Xia ruofei shook his head after hearing his words.

Xia ruofei said,”uncle Carter, there’s no hurry to change the breed. I’ll come to Australia in September and October. We’ll talk about it then.”

Old West couldn’t understand why Qin Zhuan wanted to sell half – llon grapes, so he had to change some of the existing grapes to half – llon grapes! Was there any other way?

But now that Xia ruofei was the boss, Old West didn’t ask much. He just nodded and said,””Okay, boss!”

Xia ruofei continued,”we’ll just continue with the sales model for the existing stock of wine in the winery.”

Australia was located in the Southern Hemisphere, which was the opposite of China’s season. The grape – picking season here was about March or April. The grapes of winery West had been harvested, and the wine had been brewed this year, so their main job for the next period of time was to maintain the normal operation of the winery.

“Understood!” Old West nodded.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””Uncle Carter, you should take Qiao’ er back to the winery! I want to walk around the vineyard. ”

Old West was a little confused by his boss’s request. He had already looked around. What was so nice about the vineyard?

He didn’t know that Xia ruofei had only wanted to confirm that the area was planted with Semillon grapes. What he was going to do next was the main purpose of this trip.

However, Lin Qiao was smart. She blinked at Xia ruofei and asked in Chinese,”Brother ruofei, do you want to see how to improve the Semillon grapes?”

Just two days ago, Xia ruofei had mentioned to her that it was better to improve the grapes than to improve the wine. This girl had taken it to heart, so when Xia ruofei mentioned that he wanted to walk around the vineyard alone, she immediately thought of this.

The improved grapes were an exclusive secret. He couldn’t let Old West be there! This was Lin Qiao’s thought.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”almost!” You stay in the winery obediently, I’ll get this done quickly!”

“Yes, sir!” Lin Qiao said with a mischievous smile.

Then, she said to Old West in English,””Uncle Carter, my brother wants to see grapes. Let him see as much as he wants. Let’s go back first!”

Old West couldn’t figure out Xia ruofei’s motive for doing this. He shrugged and said,””Alright! Boss, we’ll go back first!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

He watched as Old West and Lin Qiao’s figures gradually disappeared between the grape racks, so he also walked toward the area where the Semillon grapes were planted.

The vineyard in Australia was not quite the same as what everyone had expected. They had neatly arranged a row of wooden stakes that were half the height of a person and hung iron wires on them. The grapes were also growing in neat rows.

There was a 1.5 – meter gap between the grape racks, and the ground was covered with green grass. From a distance, they formed straight green “forest”.

Xia ruofei went around a few rows of grape racks and soon arrived at the Semillon grape plantation.

Without much hesitation, he took out a military dagger from the space and began to collect the grapevines.

It was a 10 – hectare vineyard. Xia ruofei took a grape vine at a distance and one would not be able to tell if they did not look carefully.

Very quickly, Xia ruofei had cut down thirty to forty grapevines and stored them all in the spirit map space.

According to the information that Xia ruofei had searched online in advance, the branches he had chosen were well – developed, with short joints, normal colors, full buds, and free of disease and insects. Such branches were the most suitable for cutting.

Then, Xia ruofei walked back while enjoying the scenery.

After returning to the winery, Lin Qiao immediately gave him a questioning look. Xia ruofei smiled and made an “OK” gesture to Lin Qiao. Lin Qiao immediately smiled happily.

They stayed at West Winery for dinner, and Xia ruofei gave some instructions on the winery’s management.

Of course, what he proposed was the general direction. He still adhered to his previous style of management and gave Old West and his wife full power. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Even when Old West was going to Melbourne to deal with the company’s aftermath, Li Du directly gave him and aunt kaberli a month’s leave and told them to close the winery and deal with their personal affairs. They could come back to manage the winery after they had resolved their worries.

In fact, Xia ruofei did not care much about the profits of the winery. Even if the winery had to close down for a month, it was nothing to him.

What he was really concerned about was whether the “improved” Semillon grapes would be able to produce a better and more unique white wine with the grapes harvested the next year after they were planted in September and October.

After leaving the winery, Xia ruofei brought Lin Qiao back to Paradise Farm.

Lin Qiao had been having a lot of fun these two days. Now that the acquisition was complete, Xia ruofei was going to take Lin Qiao to Sydney tomorrow, so he wanted her to rest early today.

After returning to the farm villa, Xia ruofei greeted Lin Qiao and the two of them went back to their rooms.

Xia ruofei locked the door as soon as he entered the room. At the same time, he also locked the window and drew the curtains. On one hand, Xia ruofei didn’t want to be woken up by Lin Qiao who had broken in. On the other hand, Xia ruofei still had to go into the spirit map space to do something tonight. He had to ensure his safety first.

Even though they were in his own territory, Xia ruofei still maintained his cautious habits. He checked the room carefully to make sure that there were no audio or video bugs. Although Xia ruofei trusted Liang Qichao very much, he could not guarantee that someone had set up those devices without Liang Qichao knowing. The spirit map space was Xia ruofei’s top secret and he could not afford to be careless.

After making sure that everything was safe, Xia ruofei summoned the spirit painting scroll from his palm.

Xia ruofei didn’t hesitate. He entered the mountain and sea realm in the spirit map space. He had sent the grapevines here in the afternoon.

“Master!” Xia Qing had long noticed the grapevines that Xia ruofei had brought in, so she had already been waiting in the mountain sea realm.

“Have you dealt with the grapevines in the afternoon?” Xia ruofei asked.

“It’s been handled according to your instructions!” Xia Qing said immediately.

After saying that, Xia Qing took out a big plastic tidying box, in which the grape branches were neatly stacked. He had already cut these branches into two to three sprouts, short branches about 20 centimeters.

“Yes!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”go to the Archean realm!”

The two of them brought the cut grapevines to the Archean realm.

Xia ruofei said,”Xia Qing, cut these grapevines in the Archean realm. After you harvest them, collect the grapes and store them.” Also, remember to take some grape seeds and soak them in the petal solution of the spirit Heart Flower before planting them. When this batch of grapes is harvested, remember to inform me in time!”

Grapes usually took two to three years to bear fruit, and some could bear fruit in the first year. Xia ruofei believed that in the spirit map space, the time would be even shorter. It was impossible to really take two to three years.

Moreover, due to the flow of time at thirty times the normal rate, it would probably take ten days at most in the outside world for the grapes to bear fruit.

Xia ruofei wanted to make a comparison. One was the grapes that were directly harvested from the cutting of the Semillon grapevines from the West Winery and grown in the spirit map space; The other method was to use the seeds of the grapes as seeds and soak the seeds in the petals of the spirit Heart Flower. After planting the seeds, the grapes would be harvested. He wanted to see which type of grapes was better.

In reality, grapes were generally reproduced by transplanting or cutting. It was rare to directly plant grape seeds because there was a wide variety of grapes, many of which had been grafted and improved. If the seed bud sprouts were directly used, it was likely that the excellent characteristics of the previous generation could not be inherited.

In fact, in the countryside, some of the grape seeds that people spat on the roadside after eating grapes would germinate and grow, and finally bear fruit.

However, wild grapes like this usually tasted sour.

However, Xia ruofei still wanted to give it a try because he felt that the Reiki in the spirit map space and the magical power contained in the petals of the spirit Heart Flower might have a special effect on the grape seeds.

If the experiment was successful, then it could be considered an improved grape variety from the root.

Moreover, after the grapes were planted, the lifespan could be as long as 60 to 70 years. It could be said to be a permanent solution.

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing replied without any hesitation.

Xia ruofei asked Xia Qing to cut the grapes while he walked into the Phoebe zhennan forest with a saw, an axe, a rope, and other tools.

Tang He needed the Jinnan wood. Xia ruofei had to cut down the Xuanji Jinnan wood in advance. After cutting it down, it had to be dried in the natural environment for two to three years to form the best quality old material.

Therefore, if they were to cut it down now, they would be able to take it out after a month or so. By then, it would be just in time. The aureum ore was very precious, especially big and old materials. It would be reasonable for Xia ruofei to inform Grandpa Tang He after a while.

Xia ruofei found the two thickest Phoebe zhennan trees and measured them with a tape measure. The diameter of the bottom was about 1.1 meters. It was slightly smaller than the last piece of material sold. However, it was still quite precious when authentic top – Quality Phoebe zhennan materials were very rare.

After Xia ruofei secured it with a rope, he began to work with a saw.

With the experience from the last time, Xia ruofei was more skilled this time. After about two hours, two Phoebe zhennan trees had been taken down.

At this time, Xia Qing had also finished cutting the grapevines. Xia ruofei called Xia Qing over and asked him to clean the branches of the Phoebe zhennan. The branches should not be wasted. Xia ruofei told Xia Qing to take them for cutting.

Of course, Xia ruofei had asked Xia Qing to bring them to the mountain and sea realm to cut out. The primordial realm couldn’t expand with the upgrade of the space, so it was already a little crowded.

Besides, there were many Phoebe zhennan trees around, all of which had grown to a diameter of about one meter. Xia ruofei was not in urgent need of the wood of the Phoebe zhennan trees. He did not want to waste these branches, so he could just plant them anywhere in the mountain and sea realm. As for when they would grow, Xia ruofei was not the least bit concerned.

After he was done with the Silkwood, Xia ruofei arrived at the stone chamber in the mountain sea realm.

He sat cross – legged on the Jade futon and began to practice drawing the unlocking rune of the human – shaped jade talisman with his spiritual power ...
