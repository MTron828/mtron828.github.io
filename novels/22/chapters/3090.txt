3091 The newbie, Chen Xuan (1)

Chen Xuan’s rented house was about three kilometers away from the current headquarters of the Paradise Corporation. This distance was already very close. He decided to ride a public bike to and from work every day. Since Qin Zhuan was here to train, he had to experience the life of an ordinary person in all aspects.

This was a single apartment in a Commercial – Residential Building. It wasn’t very new, but it was very clean from the inside out. The layout of one bedroom, one living room, one kitchen, and one bathroom was more than enough for Chen Xuan to live alone. A small space wasn’t a problem.

Although it was called a one – bedroom and one living room, the bedroom was actually an open space. The small part that was connected to the bedroom was considered the “living room.”

The most satisfying part of the apartment was the relatively spacious bay window. As it was located on a higher floor, one could enjoy the scenery of the San Shan city from the bay window.

He felt that it was not bad to sit here and cultivate.

The rent for this small apartment was 1800 Yuan a month. For a new programmer, this was considered a relatively luxurious expense. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

However, Chen Xuan still decided to rent this apartment after a round of comparison.

This was because his cultivation could not be stopped, or else his cultivation would not progress but regress instead. Therefore, the requirement for privacy in his living space was relatively high.

He would rather save up in other areas and find a relatively good house.

Chen Xuan spent the entire day tidying up his room. He then went to the nearby supermarket to buy some daily necessities, laid out new bed sheets, and stuffed the refrigerator left behind by the landlord to the brim.

After he was done with his work, Chen Xuan headed to the small bathroom to take a shower. He changed into the casual clothes he had just bought from the supermarket and laid down on the sofa in the living room. To his surprise, Chen Xuan felt a sense of satisfaction.

The next day, Chen Xuan woke up early in the morning. He picked up a public bike near the neighborhood and slowly rode it in the direction of the peach blossom building.

Yesterday evening, Chen Xuan took the opportunity to take a stroll and did some research on the public bikes that were available in the neighborhood. He then chose a brand that was of better quality and had a better supply of bikes. He also topped up a monthly credit card with an unlimited number of uses in advance, which saved him quite a bit of money!

After arriving at the Paradise Corporation, Chen Xuan first went to the Human Resources Department to complete the employment procedures.

By now, the Paradise Corporation was already very formal and all the processes were standardized. Furthermore, Chen Xuan had a full set of real identities, including a bank card and everything else. So, he completed the procedures very quickly and obtained a green employee pass that represented his probationary period.

This worker’s card was very useful. When taking the elevator, different levels of worker’s cards had different privileges. In addition, when checking in to work, eating in the cafeteria, and other scenes, this worker’s card was used. It was also the so – called one – Card.

After settling the employment procedures, Chen Xuan, accompanied by a Human Resources Specialist, headed to the development Department.

The development Department was a newly established Department, and the biggest project in the near future was the construction of Paradise Mall.

The head of the development Department was yang Xincheng. He was the one who had interviewed Chen Xuan the day before yesterday. He was also a new head.

Yang Xincheng had a very good impression of Chen Xuan. He was elated to see that Chen Xuan had finally completed his employment procedures. He personally brought Chen Xuan around the research department.

Most of the staff in this newly established Department were technical staff transferred from other departments, and there were also a large number of newly recruited staff.

The office area had just been allocated to them. Even though everyone had just moved in, the office was still in good order. Chen Xuan could also feel that everyone was filled with energy. Clearly, this team was full of energy.

Everyone was extremely interested in the fact that their boss was personally leading a newbie who was familiar with the territory. One after another, they cast curious glances at Chen Xuan.

Yang Xincheng didn’t introduce Chen Xuan to everyone in a serious manner. Instead, he took Chen Xuan around for a while before placing him in a project team.

According to the needs of the peach Garden Mall project, the development Department divided into many project teams, and each team was responsible for one task.

In fact, most of the people here had only arrived a few days earlier than Chen Xuan. However, some of them had many years of work experience, so they were more valued.

Of course, the person – in – charge of each project team was basically an old employee of paradise Corporation.

“Taoran, Chen Xuan is in the field of PhD. Haven’t you been complaining about the lack of manpower? I personally interviewed Xiao Chen. He’s definitely good in terms of skills! I’ll leave him to you!” Yang Xincheng said to a balding man in his thirties with a smile.

In fact, other than a backpack and a plaid shirt, a programmer’s hair was also very prominent. Because they were often in a state of overusing their brains, in addition to the frequent scratching of their heads when they encountered bugs that could not be passed after repeated debugging, many programmers had sparse hair. They might not be balding, but the height of their hairline was basically proportional to their age.

The person in charge of Chen Xuan’s project team, Tao Ran, was completely bald. His head was shiny and his hair was sparse. However, he still persevered and tried his best to gather the hair around him, hoping to create the illusion that there was a small amount of hair in the middle ...

Tao Ran stopped typing and raised his head. He adjusted his glasses and looked at Chen Xuan.””President yang, thank you very much! I’m seriously short of manpower here, you’re sending charcoal in the snow!”
