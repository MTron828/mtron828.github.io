There were almost 500 to 600 comments on these posts about the match between Spain and Barcelona in the past two days. Compared to his previous articles, this was already a hit.

However, pabulo had just seen that the number of comments had soared to more than 3000, and every article was about that number.

Could it have been reposted or reported by some big media?

Pablo’s heart was filled with joy. He felt that his luck had really turned for the better. It seemed that when luck came, nothing could stop it! He was on the verge of becoming famous!

He hurriedly opened the post and read it. After reading it, his face suddenly darkened and his head buzzed.

The previous comments under the post could no longer be seen, and they were all squeezed to the bottom by the new comments. And the latest comments almost all had an icon of a Chinese flag, and the content was almost the same. At a glance, it was obvious that they were copied and pasted from several versions.

“I respect the facts! Boycott the unscrupulous reporters!”

“This reporter is a writer raised by bar?a. There has always been no limit to how much he can criticize the Spanish team! It’s not the first time nokapu has treated the away team this way. This is too shameless!”

“Barca’s dogs are just barking! Even the bar?a officials are too embarrassed to come out and deny it. You’re the only one barking here, a little reporter!”

……

In addition to these comments from the same version, there were also many netizens who replied to the emoji package. It was obviously an organized online operation.

After reading a few messages, Pablo couldn’t help but tremble.

However, he wasn’t just angry. Although he was angry at first, after calming down a little, he felt that this might not be a bad thing.

In any case, the thousands of comments that had appeared in the past few hours had objectively increased his popularity by a large margin. Even if these comments were all scolding him, so what? He didn’t feel any pain, and the Chinese netizens who were thousands of miles away could only scold him through the screen. There was no other way.

Pablo was in the news industry, and he knew that this matter would soon be discovered by the official media. If they reported it, the popularity would not only spread on social media.

The heavens are really helping me! Pablo smugly said in his heart.

Then he pulled out the keyboard and immediately began to write a new post on Facebook. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Today, I suffered the most large – scale cyber violence in my career. I have enough evidence to prove that these people who insulted me on Facebook are all from China. Although I’m only describing the facts objectively, they may feel that their idol has been offended, so they formed groups and insulted me in a very ungentlemanly way! We support the freedom of speech, but we firmly oppose personal attacks! “I would like to make it clear once again that I am responsible for every statement I make. I am merely stating the facts! This was the most basic conduct of a journalist! Those Chinese who doubted me, please show me the evidence. As long as you can prove that the Spanish team really encountered what Ruby said, I am willing to apologize!”

Pablo looked through his post and whistled in satisfaction before posting it.

A female colleague at the desk next to him glanced at him and said with a smile,””Pablo, it looks like you’re in a good mood! Did something good happen?”

Pablo laughed and said,”Daisy!” If you’re willing to have dinner with me, I’ll be in a better mood!”

Daisy chuckled and said,”please ... That would make my mood very bad! So, forget it!”

The reporters at the nearby tables couldn’t help but laugh. Pablo’s expression froze as he rubbed his nose awkwardly and shrugged.”Alright then! I hope you’ll accept my invitation next time!”

Pablo wasn’t happy, but he still maintained his gentlemanly demeanor.

He thought to himself,’Daisy, you’re only pretty in the office, but compared to those hot chicks outside, you’re still far from it!’ After I become famous, what woman can I not get? When the time comes, don’t come looking for me! Hmph!

After Xia ruofei handed the task to Qin Yanan, he did not pay any more attention to this matter. Meanwhile, Qin Yanan’s team in China had been monitoring online public opinion.

Originally, Qin Yanan wanted to arrange for some people to guide them. If necessary, according to Xia ruofei’s instructions, he would find some Internet Water Army teams under the name of public relations companies to add fuel to the fire on the internet.

However, she soon found that there was no need for this at all. The netizens were excited, and there was no need to add oil to the fire. Everyone had already taken action spontaneously.

As a result, Qin Yanan turned her attention to overseas, including Pablo’s Facebook, as well as the mainstream media and online forums in Spain. She had arranged for people to monitor public opinion.

The Chinese netizens formed a group to support Pablo, and tens of thousands of comments were left on Facebook in a short time. On average, there were more than 3000 comments under each post, and this news was quickly summarized and sent to Qin Yanan’s desk.

As she looked at the data collected by her team members, she sighed to herself. President Xia’s influence on China’s internet was no less than that of a – list celebrities. As long as it was related to him, there was no lack of popularity.
