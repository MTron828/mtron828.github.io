2046 Personally cooking (1)

The White realmfox tilted its head and thought for a while. It was very dissatisfied with Xia ruofei’s behavior of not letting the Eagle go until he saw the rabbit. However, there was no other way. The initiative was in Xia ruofei’s hands!

If it was like a few days ago, it would be able to comprehend new spatial laws every day and live a comfortable life. In any case, it was different from ordinary spirit beasts. It could eat ten or eight or even more world stones at a time, and it would not starve to death even if it did not eat for a long time. It was just that it was difficult for it to improve its cultivation.

However, the situation was different now. Xia ruofei was extremely lucky to have obtained so many realm stones. The realm Fox could only watch helplessly as the realm stones were swallowed by the spirit map.

Now, Xia ruofei had deliberately placed the remaining three world stones right in front of it, but it could only see them but not eat them.

The temptation of the realm stone to the White realm Fox was extremely great. If one were to compare it, it was equivalent to the temptation of an unparalleled delicacy to a glutton. The temptation would be more or less the same if it was magnified dozens of times.

Once the appetite of the realm Fox was stimulated, it would be difficult to suppress it.

In the end, the little guy had no choice but to accept Xia ruofei’s suggestion. It waved its paws in dissatisfaction.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’ll be a little busy for the next few days. Be good and stay in the space. If you can sense the world stone, let me know. It’s okay if you can ‘t. When I have time, we can travel around the world. It’ll all be up to you then!”

After talking to the white fox, Xia ruofei wanted to go into the medium to feel the changes after the upgrade. However, he heard Wu Qiang’s footsteps coming from the backyard. He looked up at the clock on the wall and knew that lunch was ready.

Therefore, he put away the spirit map scroll and waved his hand to remove the protective array. He then pushed open the door and walked out of the bedroom.

“Boss, it’s time to eat!” Wu Qiang quickly said as he turned the moon gate and saw Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”let’s go!” I haven’t tasted your sister-in-law’s cooking for a few days!”

Xia ruofei and Wu Qiang went to the backyard. Wu Xiujuan and Xia Xiaolan quickly came up to greet them.

Xia ruofei greeted them warmly and then looked at Xia Xiaolan. He asked with a smile,””Wu Qiang, when are you and Xiao LAN getting married?”

Xia Xiaolan’s face immediately turned red. Wu Qiang chuckled and said,”Boss, it won’t be that fast!”

“You’re not young anymore, it’s about time you get married!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”do you think that sister Xiaolan is not good enough? You still want to wait and see?”

“No, no, no!” Wu Qiang quickly replied. Xiao LAN is so beautiful, and it’s my good fortune to be able to marry her. Why would I look down on her?”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but burst into laughter. Xia Xiaolan’s face was red with embarrassment as she glared at Wu Qiang.

Wu Xiujuan also laughed and said,””Boss Xia, qiangzi listens to you the most. You should persuade him. This child is not enlightened!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

An elder sister – in – Law was like a mother. Wu Xiujuan naturally hoped that her brother – in – Law would get married soon. After all, he was not young anymore.

Not to mention, Xia Xiaolan was one of the best girls in their hometown. Now that they were working under the same roof, it was a good opportunity to be in a favorable position. However, Wu Qiang was a little slow in this aspect. The two of them did not progress very quickly, and Wu Xiujuan was also a little anxious.

“Sister – in – Law ...” Xia Xiaolan shyly called out.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Wu Qiang, Xiao LAN, sister – in – Law is right. You two are of the same age. It’s time for you to start a family.” Of course, it’s still up to you to decide on your own relationship. We’re just giving you a suggestion. ”

“I know, boss!” Wu Qiang puffed out his chest and said. I’ll work hard and propose to Xiao LAN when I have enough money!”

“Brother qiangzi ...” Xia Xiaolan hurriedly said,”I’m not after your money ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Wu Qiang, did you hear that?” Xiao LAN didn’t make any requests of you. You still don’t understand?”

Wu Qiang couldn’t help but laugh.

Xia ruofei continued,”you guys can discuss this among yourselves!” Wu Qiang is my brother, and sister Xiaolan is from the same family as me. If you two get married, I’ll take care of the car!”

After Wu Xiujuan heard this, she couldn’t help but smile.

After coming to Beijing to work, Wu Xiujuan felt that her brother – in – Law had really met a noble person. Not only was the salary high, but the job was also very easy. He could also live in such a good courtyard. Even the rich people in Beijing could not live such a life!

Now, Xia ruofei even wanted to give a car to Wu Qiang as a wedding gift. Such a boss was hard to find!

“Boss!” Wu Qiang quickly said. This gift is too generous, we don’t dare to accept it ... Besides, we’re not even married yet!”

“What’s there that you guys don’t dare to accept?” Xia ruofei said angrily,”this matter is settled! Let’s eat, let’s eat!”

With that, Xia ruofei walked into the dining room.

Wu Qiang and Xia Xiaolan looked at each other. They were both embarrassed and quickly avoided eye contact.

Xia ruofei walked to the dining table and sat down. Then, he looked up at them and said,””What are you guys doing? Come in and eat!”

“Boss, we can just eat in the kitchen ...” Wu Xiujuan said quickly.

“Wu Qiang, Didn’t I tell you? There aren’t so many rules in my house!” Xia ruofei frowned and said,”everyone is equal. It’s more lively to eat together! Isn’t it a waste for me to eat such a large table of food alone? All of you, come over here!”
