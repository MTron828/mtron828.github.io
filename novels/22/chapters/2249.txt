2250 Surprise“Pengpeng, open the door! Our guests are here!” Huang Lei said.

No one noticed that Xia ruofei’s expression had changed. He had already stood up and walked towards the wooden door before Peng Chang.

Peng Chang was stunned for a moment, but he quickly followed Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei strode over and opened the wooden door.

“surprise!”The three people outside the door called out in unison with a smile.

Xia ruofei didn’t mishear. The guests for the second episode were Tang Yitian’s family of three!

The three of them already knew that Xia ruofei would be the guest for the first episode. When they saw Xia ruofei’s dazed expression, they all laughed happily, especially Tang Haoran. He was so happy that he almost bloomed.

Xia ruofei didn’t expect the Jie Ji group to be so capable that they even invited Tang Yitian.

Jennifer could still be considered as a member of the entertainment industry. Although she was not in the Chinese entertainment industry and had retired for many years, she was still running an entertainment company!

However, Tang Yitian was a well – known Chinese entrepreneur in Australia. He was one of the richest people in Australia. It was unbelievable that he had been invited to a reality show.

It was obvious that Xia ruofei was the reason why the family of three could participate in the show.

However, Xia ruofei had no idea about it.

He wasn’t familiar with the entertainment industry at all. There might be many people in the entertainment industry whom he found familiar, but there weren’t many whose names he could call out. Therefore, he naturally didn’t care who the guest for the second episode was. The festival team didn’t take the initiative to tell him about this, so he didn’t care.

What Xia ruofei didn’t expect was that the festival Group had actually buried an Easter egg here and invited Tang Yitian’s family of three from Australia without a sound.

This was a big surprise for Xia ruofei.

“Big brother Tang! Jennifer! Haoran!” Xia ruofei exclaimed,”I didn’t expect you guys to come to this show!” This is too surprising ...”

Tang Yitian laughed heartily and said,””Ruofei, when the festival Group contacted us, they promised to give you a surprise! How was it? Are you surprised?”

“It almost turned into a shock!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Tang Haoran took a step forward and bowed to Xia ruofei respectfully.””Good day, teacher!”

This was under the watchful eyes of many cameras and television station staff. Hence, Tang Haoran did not address Xia ruofei as “master” but changed it to “teacher” instead. This way, it did not sound like he was from a bustling place.

Obviously, Tang Yitian and Jennifer had done their homework before coming and had given them instructions in advance.

Xia ruofei laughed and ruffled Tang Haoran’s hair.”Haoran has grown taller again! You’ll be a big boy in a few years!”

“Hehehe!” Tang Haoran enjoyed his master’s intimate actions and grinned.

Peng Chang was right behind Xia ruofei, but he was dumbfounded at the fact that he did not know any of the guests in the second episode! And it seemed that they were very close to Xia ruofei. Could it be that this season’s show had changed its style and no longer invited celebrities from the entertainment industry?

Tang Yitian was very famous in Australia, but not necessarily in China. People in the business world and political world might know him. Who would care about the rich people in the other hemisphere? No matter how rich they were, they wouldn’t give him any!

As for Jennifer, although she used to be a superstar, she became famous very early and then retired at a very young age. After so many years, Jennifer’s appearance and temperament had changed a lot. For a young man of Peng Chang’s age, unless Lin Qiao was a super fan of Jennifer herself, she might not be able to recognize him.

“Big brother Tang! Let’s go in! Let’s talk inside!” Xia ruofei said.

Peng Chang came back to his senses and quickly came forward to help Tang Yitian’s family with their luggage.

“Big brother Tang, Jennifer, this is Peng Chang,” Xia ruofei introduced with a smile.”He’s an Outstanding Newcomer who has just emerged in the Chinese entertainment industry. Although he hasn’t been in the industry for long, he already has a large number of fans!”

Peng Chang grinned and revealed his signature smile.””Hello! Welcome to the mushroom house, you can call me Pengpeng!”

“Hello!” Jennifer smiled and said,”the young man is very handsome!”

Peng Chang was a little surprised. He did not expect Jennifer to speak Chinese so fluently. After a slight pause, he quickly expressed his gratitude to Jennifer for her praise.

Tang Haoran also said very politely,””Hello, brother Pengpeng! Thank you for helping me with my suitcase ...”

Peng Chang also liked Tang Haoran very much. He immediately said,””You’re welcome!”

The group of people walked into the courtyard of the mushroom house. He Jiong, Huang Lei and Zhang Xing stood up to welcome them.

He Jiong had already known that the guests for this episode would be Tang Yitian’s family of three. However, for the sake of the program’s effect, he did not reveal it to anyone, not even Huang Lei.

He Jiong knew that Tang Yitian and his wife might not be very well – known in China, and Huang Lei might not be able to recognize them. So, to avoid awkwardness, he was prepared to quickly introduce the three of them.

However, when Huang Lei saw Tang Yitian’s group of three, he couldn’t help but Quicken his pace. At the same time, he said excitedly, “It’s Jennifer! Teacher he, your television station is really something! He could even invite Jennifer! He’s really remarkable!”

Seeing that Huang Lei also knew Jennifer, He Jiong felt even more relaxed. He said with a smile,””That’s a must!”

The two of them talked as they walked up to him. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

He Jiong stepped forward and said,”President Tang!” Jennifer! And little Haoran, welcome, welcome! I’m he Jiong, the host of xiangnan TV!”

“Nice to meet you, teacher he!” Tang Yitian said with a smile.

“Teacher he, I’ve heard so much about you!” Jennifer also said with a smile.

Xia ruofei laughed secretly at Jennifer’s habit of using idioms. Fortunately, she did not use them wrong this time.

“You’re too kind!”He Jiong said hurriedly. I don’t dare! I don’t dare!”

Although Jennifer had retired, she was still a genuine Oscar – Level superstar and was now running an entertainment company. Although she did not have much business in China for the time being, her influence in the entertainment industry was beyond doubt.

“This is Huang Lei, Huang Laoshi. He is a real teacher from the capital Film Academy!” He Jiong continued to introduce.

“I’ve seen the movies that Ms. Huang starred in,” Jennifer said with a smile.”Your acting is very good!”

Huang Lei was flattered and said,””Thank you! Thank you! Jennifer, I’m still your fan! I really like the role you played as the female hunter, Jessica, in Forest Mist!”

In fact, Huang Lei had started his career earlier than Jennifer and was also a little older than her. However, Jennifer had retired at a very young age, giving people the feeling that she was more like a senior in the entertainment industry.

“Jessica’s role is very attractive. ” Jennifer smiled and said,”when I first saw the script, I was immediately tempted. I didn’t even hesitate for a second and took on the role.”

“Your acting was very good!” Huang Lei said.

He Jiong saw that the two of them were not done “praising each other” and quickly took advantage of an opening to interject and introduce Zhang Xing to Tang Yitian and Jennifer.

“Little Star, Jennifer is a multi – talented superstar in film, television, and singing. She’s an Oscar – Level movie queen!” The “misty forest” that she starred in could be considered a classic! President Tang is even more amazing. He’s the king of the Australian retail industry and has almost occupied half of the entire Australian retail industry!”

He Jiong was introducing the guests to Zhang Xing. In fact, he was using this method to tell the television audience that although this episode’s guest did not look very familiar, he was not a simple person either!

Tang Yitian laughed.”Teacher he, you’re overpraising me. The competition in Australia’s retail industry is very fierce. Our Meiya group only occupies a small portion of the market share. We don’t even have half of the market share!”

“President Tang, you’re too humble! I’ve been to Australia a few times, and there are supermarkets and convenience stores everywhere in Australia!” He Jiong said with a smile,”it’s just that we didn’t know that the owner of the famous Meiya retail chain was actually a Chinese compatriot!”

“We Chinese people are very hardworking. We have Chinese people working hard in most places in the world!” Tang Yitian laughed.

“There should be applause!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Everyone clapped very cooperatively. Then, He Jiong chuckled and said,”You might not know this, but President Tang’s family and President Xia are actually good friends!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”let’s let big brother Tang and the others settle down first.” The story here is a long one!”

“Yes, yes, yes!” “Xiaoxing, Pengpeng, help me move the luggage!” He Jiong said.

Tang Yitian’s family first visited the mushroom house, then went to the second floor to choose a room. Actually, there wasn’t much room to choose from, so they only had to choose one of the two rooms.

As expected, they also chose the lake view room with the better view, which was the room Xia ruofei had stayed in last night.

Xia ruofei had already packed everything when he woke up today. The staff had also changed the bedsheets.

Tang Haoran had wanted to stay in the same room as Xia ruofei, but he was reluctant to leave when he heard that Xia ruofei was leaving after lunch.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Haoran, you’ll be done recording tomorrow. You can stay in my courtyard house then!” That place is much bigger than this!”

“Really?” “Thank you, teacher!” Tang Haoran said happily.

“Director Xia, why did little Haoran call you ‘teacher’?” Huang Lei asked curiously.

Before Xia ruofei could say anything, Tang Yitian explained with a smile,””Ms. Huang, our Haoran has been learning some martial arts to strengthen his body from ruofei.”

Huang Lei suddenly understood,”Oh, right!” President Xia used to be an excellent soldier, he must have real kung fu!”

Then, he patted Tang Haoran’s head and said with admiration in his eyes,””This child respects his teacher! It’s worthy of praise!”

Ever since they had entered the mushroom hut, Tang Haoran had always been very respectful towards Xia ruofei. Huang Lei had noticed this.

“Big brother Tang, we’ve finished watching everything upstairs. Let’s go downstairs and have some tea!” Xia ruofei said.
