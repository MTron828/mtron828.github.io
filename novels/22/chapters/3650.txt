Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei looked at the fierce – looking Grello with a playful expression. “It seems like you really don’t take my Paradise Farm seriously!” Said Galini. You used so many methods to deal with my farm, and even tried to assassinate my friend, but you didn’t even investigate it beforehand!”

Greello looked at the bare – handed and skinny Xia ruofei. A cold smile appeared on his face and he said,”I don’t care how you got on my ship, but since you’re here and dared to break into my bedroom, then you can stay! I heard that there are many piranhas in this area. I think they will be happy to enjoy your body!”

Xia ruofei shrugged.”The rumors are true. You are a true murderer. It’s not too much to die a hundred times.”

Grello. Galini looked at Xia ruofei and could not help but laugh wildly. His shoulders trembled violently as he pointed at Xia ruofei and said,””Chinese kid, you’ve lived for so many years, how can you still be so naive? In this world, strength was always respected. Those without strength deserved to be bullied! Didn’t your parents teach you anything when you were young?”

Xia ruofei nodded seriously and said,””Although you’re a bastard, you’re not wrong. This world respects strength.”

Grello. Galiny shrugged and said,”so?” You’re throwing yourself into a trap to die? Huaxia kid, I don’t know what my brother is thinking, he actually ordered me to suspend all operations on Paradise Farm, otherwise your broken farm would have been in the Galini family’s pocket long ago! But it doesn’t matter. As long as I want to, I can take your farm away at any time. Of course, you probably won’t be able to see that day!”

Grello. At this point, Galini started to stare into Xia ruofei’s eyes and said gloomily,””! heard that the kid in charge of the farm was quite lucky. Not only did he survive, but his recovery was also quite ideal. It seems that I was too kind last time. Don’t worry, he’ll be down there to accompany you soon! I’ll break his bones inch by inch and hang him on the gate of Paradise Farm. 1’11 let everyone see the consequences of offending the kalini family!”

Xia ruofei calmly looked at the crazy – looking Grello. “If God wants to destroy it, he must first make it crazy,” Galini said indifferently. “This saying is true!”

Grello. Galini’s eyes were filled with killing intent. He pulled out a large – caliber pistol from under his pillow, skillfully opened the safety, and loaded the bullet. Then, he pointed the black muzzle at Xia ruofei.

Grello. Galini’s movements were well – trained. Although this younger brother of his was simple – minded, his ability to move was not bad. Of course, in the eyes of ordinary people, he could barely be considered an expert. At least he was agile. Galini’s movements were as slow as a snail.

However, Xia ruofei did not stop him. Even though he had already detected a pistol under his pillow with his mental power, he was still stunned. Xia ruofei just looked at Grello quietly. Galini’s eyes were as calm as water.

Grello. Galiny was slightly stunned, and then he smiled wildly. With a loaded pistol in his hand, he felt even more confident.

He had a cruel smile on his face as he said,””You dared to sneak into my yacht alone. I thought you were a master with good skills! 1 didn’t expect this … This is really disappointing. The game hasn’t even started and it’s about to end. It’s really too boring…”

“No, the game … Has only just begun!” Xia ruofei smiled.

“Oh?” Grello. Galiny raised the gun in his hand and quickly pointed it at Xia ruofei. He sneered and said,””I really can’t see what chance you have to turn the tables! Oh right, I forgot to tell you. I hate you yellow – skinned monkeys the most. Wherever you go, you stick together as if the whole world belongs to you! “On the other hand, our noble white people have been occupied by you lowly races! Do you know? I’ve personally dealt with six Chinese before, and you’ll be the seventh soon. You should feel honored! Oh … By the way, you Chinese women are actually not bad. Three years ago, when I killed a Chinese man, his girlfriend happened to be there. That taste … Tsk tsk…”

Xia ruofei listened to Grello. At these words, a trace of coldness finally appeared on Galini’s calm face, and his eyes suddenly became much sharper.

Grello. Galini had been paying attention to Xia ruofei’s expression. He laughed wildly and said,””Do you feel very angry? Don’t you want to take revenge for your lowly compatriots? It’s a pity… You won’t have the chance … Because of your stupidity, you’ll soon follow in the footsteps of your compatriots.

Hahahaha…” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Xia ruofei quickly regained his composure and said,””Greello, you have successfully angered me. So … I originally wanted to give you a quick death, but 1 suddenly changed my mind.. If I don’t let you die a painful death, I’ll be letting down my innocent compatriots!”
