2161 Escape from the snake’s belly (2)

Xia ruofei gritted his teeth and twisted his body in the water. He dodged the attack by a hair’s breadth and did not become the Python’s food.

However, the purpleblood spirit Python had already caught up to him, so it was impossible for him to escape.

The purple – blooded spiritual Python was more agile in the water. After missing Xia ruofei in one bite, it swung its huge body towards Xia ruofei without any pause.

If he were to be entangled by the purple – blooded spiritual Python, Xia ruofei would have no choice but to hide in the spirit map space.

He relied on his agility to slip through the gaps between the Python’s bodies and then desperately floated up.

Xia ruofei had already realized that if he continued to dive, he would definitely die. In this situation, he might have a chance of survival if he ran up.

The pool was in the shape of an upside – down funnel, and the deeper it went, the wider it became. When it reached the surface of the water, its diameter was only a few meters, and the purple – blooded spiritual Python had to coil its body to accommodate it.

Hence, the closer they got to the surface of the water, the harder it was for the purpleblood spirit Python to display its massive body. Xia ruofei could then take advantage of its small size.

Xia ruofei stomped his feet and floated to the surface.

The purple – blooded spiritual Python had also turned its body around nimbly. The place where it had just been was about a hundred meters deep. The space was already very wide, and the purple – blooded spiritual Python could easily complete its turn.

The speed of the purple – blooded spiritual Python was extremely fast. In just a short while, it had caught up to Xia ruofei.

What was worse was that the suction force from its mouth was very strong, which could greatly slow down Xia ruofei’s speed.

Xia ruofei had only floated up for about 20 meters when he felt the water below surge. He subconsciously dodged to the side and saw the huge Python head suddenly swing up. Xia ruofei could even see the White and ferocious snake fangs.

He gritted his teeth and twisted his body nimbly. Then, he stomped hard on the purpleblood spirit Python’s body, increasing his speed. The purpleblood spirit Python’s attack missed, and Xia ruofei’s stomp caused its speed to slow down. The distance between the two of them increased by a few meters.

Just like that, Xia ruofei dodged the attacks of the purple – blooded spiritual Python again and again with the advantage of his small and agile body. It was like walking on a tightrope each time, and he would die in the snake’s stomach if he was not careful.

Of course, Xia ruofei had already summoned the spirit map scroll and held it tightly in his hand. If there was no way to hide, he would not hesitate to hide in the spirit map space.

In fact, Xia ruofei was soon in a desperate situation.

When he was about thirty meters above the water, although the purpleblood spirit Python’s huge body could not fully display its power, Xia ruofei had little room to move around.

The purple – blooded spiritual Python quickly changed its strategy. It no longer tried to use its body to wrap around Xia ruofei. Instead, it stretched its long body. This way, the resistance in the water was much smaller, and it floated up faster.

More importantly, after the long body was stretched, it was no longer restricted by the narrow space.

The purple blood spirit Python used one method of attack, which was to open its mouth and suck at Xia ruofei.

Finally, Xia ruofei felt that he could no longer float. He and the water around him were falling towards the mouth of the purple – Blood spirit Python, which was one or two meters below him. He could not resist the suction.

He could almost see the light from the water, but Xia ruofei had no other choice.

He made up his mind and with a thought, he disappeared into the pool and hid in the spirit map space.

Almost at the same time, the painting was sucked into the purple blood spirit Python’s stomach along with the large amount of water in the pool.

Xia ruofei stood at the entrance of the mountain sea realm’s cave, and his expression turned extremely ugly.

He immediately sent out his thoughts and observed that the environment of the spirit map scroll was extremely dark. There was no doubt that he was inside the Python’s belly.

Xia ruofei’s mind power could even sense some limbs. He knew that the purple blood spirit Python must have eaten many survivors and had not digested them yet.

Although he was very confident in the painting, Xia ruofei was still a little worried. He did not know if the purple – Blood spirit Python’s stomach acid would corrode the painting.

Even if the stomach acid had no effect on the spirit map, hiding in the snake’s stomach was not a solution!

At this moment, Xia ruofei suddenly had an idea!

He suddenly realized that this might be a good opportunity. ‘Isn’t the purpleblood spirit Python’s skin so tough that even the military dagger can’t pierce through its scales?’ He didn’t believe that the inside of its body could be as hard as its scales!

Xia ruofei also recalled that he had collected a flying sword in the green touring immortal abode. This flying sword was used by bi youzi even after he entered the nascent Soul Stage. Its sharpness was not something his original dagger could compare to.

Xia ruofei even felt that if he had taken out the blue immortal sword, he might not have had to run away in such a sorry state. Even the spirit map scroll would have been swallowed into the Python’s stomach.

However, this was also good. At least it would be easier to attack from the inside.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but think of the scene in Journey to the West where Sun Wukong entered Princess Iron Fan’s stomach. He suddenly felt that that scene was very similar to his current situation!

Xia ruofei did not hesitate. He summoned the blue travel immortal sword from his dantian.

The flying sword, which was emitting a sharp aura, was quietly floating in front of Xia ruofei.

He muttered to himself,”evil creature!” You chased me to such a sorry state and even ate those poor survivors. It’s time for you to pay the price!”

With that, Xia ruofei willed the flying sword to disappear from the spirit map. The next moment, it reappeared in the purple – blooded spiritual Python’s stomach.

Xia ruofei didn’t need to leave the spirit map space at all. He could control the flying sword easily with his mind.

Even if he didn’t practice “blue sword technique” and couldn’t use some powerful moves, the result of this battle was already determined by the sharpness of the flying sword and the unique position advantage.

Xia ruofei’s mind moved and the blue travel immortal sword immediately cut down on the thick meat wall in the purple – bloodied spirit Python’s stomach.

When the purple – blooded spiritual Python was swallowing, Xia ruofei had disappeared into thin air. Naturally, he felt very strange. He felt that he had swallowed something, but it did not seem to be a person. At least, it felt completely different from when he had swallowed the survivors outside.

It looked around the pool but did not find Xia ruofei. It then floated to the surface with a trace of doubt.

It had just floated up about seven or eight meters when it suddenly felt a sharp pain in its stomach. It couldn’t help but let out a terrible scream, and its body twisted violently.

The water in the pond splashed up like a boiling pot. The purple blood spirit Python writhed and writhed in a frenzy. Even a piece of iron would have been turned into a flat metal sheet if it were to be hit by such an intense pain. However, the stones by the pond were not damaged in the slightest. Instead, the flowers and plants on the shore were all scattered around. It was a mess.

Xia ruofei gritted his teeth as he controlled the blue travel immortal sword to stab and cut at the purple – blooded spirit Python’s stomach. There was even one time where the sword had pierced through the Python’s body, the tip of the sword coming out from the Python’s tough scales.

In an instant, a large amount of blood gushed out of the pool.

The amazing thing was that the blood was all purple. No wonder it was called the purpleblood spirit Python.

After a while, the water in the pond seemed to have been dyed a deep purple.

The purpleblood spirit Python’s struggle became even more frenzied, and its hissing continued.

However, no matter how powerful it was, it couldn’t do anything about the attack from the inside of its body. It couldn’t even Dodge. Moreover, its fragile flesh wall was like tofu under the attack of the flying sword. Everything was a big hole.

This was really a trap.

However, the life force of a purple – blooded spiritual Python was very strong. Xia ruofei had been attacking it for five to six minutes, but its body was already riddled with holes. It was still wriggling around. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

In the end, the purpleblood spirit Python’s struggles gradually weakened. It then floated motionlessly in the pool, leaving behind a scene of wolves ...
