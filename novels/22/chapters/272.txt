Chapter 273: Temporary gun (1)

The box was filled with shiny metal parts. Xia ruofei could tell at a glance that it was a pistol. He could even tell that it was a Type 92 pistol. As this was the standard equipment for commanders and special Forces, the type 92 pistol bullets he used in the lone wolf assault team could be counted in boxes. It was no exaggeration to say that Xia ruofei could assemble these parts in the shortest time even with his eyes closed. Xia ruofei reached out and grabbed a gun part. After a series of dazzling movements, a complete type 92 pistol appeared in his hands. The whole process only took four to five seconds. “Sure! I didn’t stop!” Xu Wu said with a smile. Xia ruofei said proudly,”I’m a little rusty. When I was in the Army, I only needed nine seconds to disassemble and combine them.” “Alright, alright, stop showing off!” Xu Wu said,”no one can compete with you lone wolf when it comes to playing with these standard equipment!” Xia ruofei waved the gun in his hand and asked,””What’s the meaning of this?” “This is the gun I’ve specially applied for special approval from the higher – ups for you to use during this mission, ruofei,” said Xu Wu with a serious face. However, you must immediately take it back after the mission is completed!” Xia ruofei whistled and turned the gun around in a carefree manner.””I didn’t expect to have the chance to touch the type 92 after leaving the Army. It seems that helping you guys on this mission was not in vain.” “I hope you won’t have the chance to use live ammunition ...” Said Xu Wu with a bitter smile. If Xia ruofei were to use this gun during this trip, it would be a very serious threat to his safety. As the first person in charge of elder song’s safety, Xu Wu naturally did not want to encounter such a situation. There was also a leather holster and a spare magazine in the box. The spare magazine was also filled with live ammunition. Each magazine had a capacity of 25 bullets. With one magazine and a spare magazine in the pistol, there were a total of 50 bullets. Xia ruofei took off his jacket and skillfully put on the holster. Then, he meticulously checked the gun, turned off the safety, and put the type 92 pistol back into the holster. After putting on his coat, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Xu Can, you’re too stingy. Since you’ve already applied for special approval, why don’t you just get a more powerful weapon? I’m not used to this small gun!” “Then what gun are you used to in the Army?” Xu Wu asked,”don’t tell me that you lone wolves are worthy of the desert Eagle?” “JS05! I used it the most in the Army!” Xia ruofei chuckled.”Xu Can, why don’t you go and apply for one?” “Swish!” Xu Wu was shocked and quickly said,”stop it! Did he really think this mission was a cross – Border decapitation operation? I’m telling you, there’s only the 92 – form, nothing else! And I only have 50 bullets!” The full name of the “JS05″ that Xia ruofei mentioned was the JS05 12.7MM sniper rifle. It was the only large – caliber anti – Armor rifle in China that could fire a secondary – Armor piercing shell. Currently, it was only equipped to some Special Forces. Xia ruofei’s lips twitched.”I knew it. Xu Can, the JS05 is a special equipment for Special Forces. I guess you’ve never played with it before?” Xia ruofei was right. Although Xu Wu was an elite of the guard Bureau, he had no chance to touch this kind of long – range destructive equipment that was specially equipped for Special Forces. The guard Bureau also had specialized snipers and sniper rifles, but they were all relatively light models. Xu Wu pushed Xia ruofei out of the room angrily and said,””Let’s go! Hurry up and leave! I’ve given you the gun and we’ve discussed the plan, so don’t stay here!” “Xu Shen, you’re killing the donkey when the grinding is done!” Xia ruofei laughed. “Get lost ...” Xia ruofei laughed heartily. After leaving Xu Wu’s office, he went straight to manager Lu. Manager Lu then talked to Xia ruofei about the rough schedule for this trip. After all, Xia ruofei had to take care of security work as well, so he had to know the schedule. After the two finished their conversation, manager Lu brought Xia ruofei to elder song’s room. This was the largest suite in Gu Ling courtyard. It had a bedroom, a study, a living room, and a small dining room. Manager Lu knocked on the door and brought Xia ruofei into elder song’s room. Elder song had specifically instructed that Xia ruofei did not need to report to him. Elder song was wearing reading glasses and reading the newspaper in his study. Even though he had retired, he was still concerned about the country’s Affairs. Reading newspapers and documents was something he did almost every day. Moreover, retired leaders of different levels also enjoyed the same treatment. Naturally, people like elder song could even read high – Level internal journals such as the Red Star internal reference. In today’s highly developed Information Network, only these old Chiefs still maintained such a traditional way of obtaining information. There were very few young people who read the newspapers, and they were used to obtaining information on the internet. Manager Lu and Xia ruofei did not disturb elder song. However, elder song’s hearing was very sharp. Even though the two of them had tried to be as light as possible, he could still hear their footsteps. He looked up and immediately put down the newspaper in his hand. He took off his reading glasses and put them on the desk. He stood up and said with a smile,””Little Xia, I’ll have to trouble you again this time!” “It’s my honor to be able to serve you, chief!”Xia ruofei replied in a manner that was neither humble nor overbearing. Then, Xia ruofei smiled and said,”besides, there’s a free tour if I stay with the chief!” If other people knew about this, they would be so envious of me!” Eccentric song laughed heartily and said,”Little Xia, come over and sit!” The two went to the living room outside the study and sat down. Manager Lu immediately started to make tea for them. He had been working with elder song for more than ten years and knew elder song’s habits like the back of his hand. Therefore, manager Lu always made the tea by himself and never asked the other service staff to help. Elder song often said that manager Lu’s tea was the best among the same tea leaves. “Chief, let me take your pulse again!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “Alright!” Elder song laughed and reached out his hand.”Little Zhou and little SU’s test reports said that they’ve basically recovered, but I’m only at ease after you, the little miracle doctor, have examined them!” The Xiao Zhou and Xiao Su that elder song was talking about were the newly appointed medical team leader, Zhou Jiaming, and the Deputy Team Leader, su Xiaohong. Xia ruofei took elder song’s pulse and said with a smile,””Chief, the situation is very good. You can stop taking the medicine after another month or so of consolidation!” In fact, Xia ruofei did not know how to feel the pulse, but he had absolute confidence in the petals of the wondrous flower. In the Chinese medicine that elder song had taken, there were almost two petals of the wondrous flower. Although the final stage of cancer was dangerous, two petals of the wondrous flower was enough to cure it. Of course, Xia ruofei was so sure because he had the Western medical examination report as evidence. As for the consolidation that he said would take about a month, the petal solution he added into the Chinese medicine during this period would naturally be less, because there was no need to waste it. “Good, good, good!” Elder song laughed and said,”I’m even more relieved to hear that! I thought that I would have to go down and play the bridge Card with the old general, but it seems that the old general will have to wait a little longer!” “Chief, you’re still alive and healthy!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “Hahaha! It’s all thanks to you, little guy!” Elder song said happily. Xia ruofei chatted with elder song for a while and then left. The journey would start early the next morning. Xia ruofei could not stay for too long in case he disturbed elder song’s rest. As soon as Xia ruofei walked out of elder song’s room, he heard a surprised voice behind him.””Ruofei, you’re here!”
