3024 Master Yuntai (1)

Bai Qingqing was a little annoyed,”what’s there to say? You must have seen it clearly! This isn’t a spirit stone at all, but a Space Stone in disguise. This small space is even simpler than the nested space. I should’ve thought of it earlier. You can even crack the nested space in a unique way, so how can this primitive small space be hidden from you?”

Bai Qingqing felt like she was asking to be humiliated.

In fact, it was just hoping that Xia ruofei didn’t notice the spiritual stone. It knew that if Xia ruofei noticed it, he would be able to tell at first glance.

The spirit stones had been piled up like a small mountain, and there were hundreds of thousands of them. If it were an ordinary person, it would naturally be difficult to find this Space Stone that looked exactly the same as the spirit stones in the mountain.

However, for cultivators, especially Xia ruofei, whose spiritual power had already reached the late stage of the spirit gathering realm, this was not a big deal.

Xia ruofei was used to being cautious. These cultivation resources came from the storage rings of the ancient cultivators. How could he be careless?

He had used his spiritual power to check all the resources and ancient books.

Even though there were a lot of spirit stones, it would only take a few breaths for him to assess the situation with his spiritual energy.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”There’s no need to talk about such obvious things. Didn’t you find anything else?”

Bai Qingqing was stunned for a moment. Then, she carefully examined the ‘spiritual stone’ in Xia ruofei’s hand and muttered to herself,””Could it be that there’s something strange about it?”

Bai Qingqing carefully sensed the spatial stone’s fluctuations and looked uncertain. She said,””Boss, there seems to be something different ... Although the rules of this space are extremely simple, there seems to be some unnecessary structures that are used to trigger something ...”

Xia ruofei gave Bai Qingqing a thumbs up and said,””As expected of the darling of space, your eyesight is not bad!”

Bai Qingqing smiled bitterly,”boss, don’t laugh at me. What space pet? it’s a joke in front of you!” If I’m the darling of space, then you ... You’re practically the ancestor of space!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. “You’re being very disrespectful! Aren’t you afraid that the God of space will find out and punish you?”

Bai Qingqing pouted and said,”if there really is a space God, I wouldn’t be slower than humans. Let’s not talk about this anymore. Boss, what I just discovered, is it right?” Do you have any new discoveries?”

“Didn’t I already praise you?” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”this means that your judgment is very accurate! As for the new discovery ... I can only confirm that there is a warning formation set up on this Space Stone, but it has not been triggered. ”

“Yes, yes, yes! It’s in an inactive state!” Bai Qingqing quickly asked,”boss, what does this mean?”

Bai Qingqing’s face was filled with a thirst for knowledge. In front of Xia ruofei, she could no longer be reserved. In the past, her greatest sense of superiority in front of Xia ruofei was that her comprehension of the laws of space was far superior to Xia ruofei ‘s. But now, not only did she not have any advantage, but she was even mercilessly surpassed by Xia ruofei ...

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said,””It’s probably related to the method I used to crack the nested space. If I used conventional methods ...”

After saying that, Xia ruofei glanced at Bai Qingqing and said,””Oh ... So it’s the method you’re going to teach me to break it.”

Bai Qingqing covered her face with her front paws and said,””Boss, if you keep talking like this, you really won’t have any friends ...” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Xia ruofei laughed and continued,””Alright! I’m guessing that if we use conventional methods to crack the nested space, the warning array on this spatial stone should be triggered ...”

Bai Qingqing said with some lingering fear,’so, boss, it’s a good thing you broke the nested space from the source? Otherwise, once the warning array is triggered, it’s possible that everything in the entire nested space would be blown to pieces with a bang?”

As Bai Qingqing said this, she subconsciously took two steps away from Xia ruofei.

If that was the case, the spatial stone in Xia ruofei’s hand was a time bomb!

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”that’s not the case.” Think about it ... This Yuntai has stored so many cultivation resources in the nested space. I guess that even if it’s not all of his wealth, it’s at least a large part of it. Did he hide so many things in the nested space just to let his descendants take a look and then blow them up? Then isn’t he a little too twisted?”

“Boss, if you put it that way ...” Bai Qingqing moved closer to Xia ruofei and said,”it does make sense!”

Then, Bai Qingqing looked at Xia ruofei and said,””Boss, if you’re so confident, it shouldn’t be just a guess, right? I remember you just swore that there were no cultivation resources in this space rock. Does that mean you can directly check the inside of the space rock?”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”I can’t see everything at a glance, but I can more or less sense some auras.” That’s why I’m pretty sure that there aren’t any cultivation resources in there, especially not realm stones. Otherwise, I would definitely be able to sense it!”
