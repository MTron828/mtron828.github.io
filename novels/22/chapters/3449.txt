Chapter 3450: Challenging the heavenly stairs alone (2)

Translator: 549690339

What Ling Qingxue didn’t know was that there was a reward for clearing one – third of the eighth level, but it wouldn’t have been this much. It was just that there was a high chance that she had fairy Lingbo’s bloodline aura in her body. Daoist Qing Xuan gave her so many rewards because of this and because there were indeed some rewards that should have been given out on the seventh floor of the trial Pagoda.

Of course, even though Ling Qingxue had taken the heavenly cloud Palace, Taoist Qing Xuan’s resentment was directed at Xia ruofei. On the contrary, he was more concerned about Ling Qingxue, who had the aura of fairy Lingbo’s bloodline.

Ling Qingxue did not know what was going on, but she was still pleasantly surprised to obtain so much yellow jade essence at once. With this yellow jade essence, Song Wei’s spiritual power would be greatly improved when they returned. On top of that, they had also obtained the Vermillion Jade Fruit, which Song Wei could also consume. With this, their cultivation should be able to reach a similar level.

Ling Qingxue calmed herself down and put the storage ring away without a word.

As Chen Xuan and the others chatted, they were also very interested in the situation after the sixth level of the trial Pagoda. Only Ling Qingxue had experienced it before, so everyone went to ask her.

Ling Qingxue thought about it and felt that there was nothing to hide. Other than the details of her and Xia ruofei challenging the levels together, she told everyone everything she knew. She told them about the situation on the seventh and eighth levels of the trial Pagoda.

Of course, she would never tell anyone that she had taken away the entire cloud Palace on the seventh level of the trial Pagoda.

After all, money could move people’s hearts. Even treasures like the yellow jade essence were enough to attract others ‘covetous eyes, let alone a Supreme treasure like the heavenly cloud Palace. One had to know that there were two golden core stage cultivators here, so Ling Qingxue still had this basic awareness of being on guard.

When everyone heard Ling Qingxue mention the trial Pagoda’s seventh level and the heavenly cloud Palace’s many obstacles, they couldn’t help but click their tongues and sigh.

When Ling Qingxue mentioned the trial of the stairway to heaven on the eighth level of the trial Pagoda, everyone held their breath. Especially when they heard that as long as one passed the trial Pagoda’s eighth level, they would be able to reach the top. When they heard that the ninth level no longer had any tests, everyone couldn’t help but sigh.

“That’s such a pity!” Yu xiner said,”Qingxue, if you work hard and make it through, you’ll be at the top!”

Yu Xin ‘er was about the same age as Ling Qingxue, and she had a more cheerful personality. Thus, during the long journey from earth to the moon, she had established a very good relationship with Ling Qingxue.

Xu yurou was in the same situation. She had a good relationship with Ling Qingxue.

Therefore, Xu yurou could not help but say,””Yup! Qingxue, does this mean that you can see the door of light that leads to the top of the tower? Success was right in front of him! That’s such a pity!”

Not only were the Qi condensation disciples sighing, even Yang Liu and Chen Xuan, the two golden core cultivators, couldn’t help but reveal a look of pity when they heard Ling Qingxue’s words. At the same time, they also felt a little envious. After all, Ling Qingxue had at least seen the door to the top of the trial Pagoda, while they were still a few levels away!

Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”I’ve already tried my best. However, the difference in strength is too great… At that time, 1 only climbed about one – third of the steps. 1 couldn’t hold on any longer and was thrown out involuntarily. Then, 1 was directly transported out.” So … I’m still not strong enough. Even if you give me ten more chances, I still won’t be able to make it

Ling Qingxue felt that if her cultivation could reach the peak of refined Qi level 9, and at the same time, her spiritual power could break through a small realm, reaching the late stage of spirit gathering realm, then she would have a certain chance of passing this stage.

Of course, this was only a chance. Moreover, if she accidentally broke through to the Golden core stage directly, then she would basically have no chance to try the Golden core stage’s heavenly stairs.

Willow looked at Ling Qingxue and said,””Every generation has its own talents! The younger generation’s performance is already so amazing. We’re really getting old…”

Chen Xuan also felt that his fighting spirit had taken a hit as he laughed bitterly,””The trial Pagoda tests your overall strength. Although cultivation is also a type of overall strength, if your cultivation is high, you definitely won’t be able to pass a few rounds. We’re still lacking in terms of overall strength … Speaking of which, 1 really admire brother ruofei. He and miss Ling have been cultivating for a much shorter time than us, but they’re so well – rounded. It’s really unbelievable…”

“I don’t know which stage fellow Daoist Xia has passed …” Yang Liu said,”with his strength, 1 think his results should not be below lady Qingxue’s. Perhaps he is the one who has the highest chance of reaching the top …”

Ling Qingxue’s thoughts were also drawn to Xia ruofei’s side by their conversation.

Ling Qingxue looked at the tall tower in front of her and thought to herself,”RUO Fei, you should have started to break through the levels by now! I believe in you, you will definitely succeed in reaching the top!

8th level of the trial Pagoda.

Xia ruofei had also arrived at the Obsidian stairway. He looked up at the hundreds of steps and the looming light screen door at the top. He took a deep breath and stepped onto the first step.

Xia ruofei’s body swayed a little as he felt a huge pressure. However, it did not cause him any trouble. Without any pause, he stepped on the ground with his other foot.

When Xia ruofei finally stood on the Obsidian stairway, he finally understood what Ling Qingxue’s mouth had told him about the “pressure”.

As long as he stood on the Obsidian stairway, there would be an invisible pressure on him.

There was also mental pressure, but it was not just mental pressure, but also real pressure.

It was as if the air pressure here had suddenly doubled, and every part of his body was being compressed. Moreover, this kind of pressure was much stronger than just an increase in air pressure. Even the vital Qi in one’s body would produce a shock, making one feel very uncomfortable. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

In addition, it was accompanied by spiritual power Pressure, which caused people to involuntarily produce many negative emotions such as cowardice, discouragement, retreat, and so on, which made this stage even more difficult.

Of course, it was only the first step. It did not affect Xia ruofei much. Whether it was spiritual pressure or other external pressure, he felt as if a breeze was blowing on his face. Basically, it would not be a problem for him to get used to it in one or two seconds.

Xia ruofei was not in a hurry to continue climbing. He stood on the first step and felt the invisible pressure. He could not help but be amazed.

He knew very well that the higher he went, the greater the pressure would be. Therefore, he wanted to take advantage of the fact that he was still feeling relaxed to experience it. It would be very helpful for him to deal with the pressure later.

After a while, Xia ruofei nodded to himself and stepped onto the second step.

Whether it was the spiritual power Pressure or the invisible external pressure, they both increased by a large amount.

However, to Xia ruofei, this was nothing. It was not enough to affect him.

He didn’t even stop. His left foot was still on the second step, and his right foot was on the third step, just like taking the stairs at home.

Xia ruofei had the confidence to do so. The first few steps were not challenging for him. Now that he had a general understanding of the pressure, there was no point in taking one step at a time. If his strength allowed him to, it was not a big deal to take such a big step.

Xia ruofei walked up the stairs one step at a time. After walking for more than ten steps, he finally stopped to take a break.

In fact, the pressure was not that great. However, as he walked, the external pressure was constantly increasing, and the vital Qi in his body was constantly fluctuating. So after walking for a while, he still needed to stop and rest, and at the same time, let his vital Qi calm down..
