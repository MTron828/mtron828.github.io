Xia ruofei immediately knew that Lieutenant Colonel Liao Jun was someone elder song trusted. Otherwise, he would not have said that.

Moreover, a Lieutenant Colonel in the field of technical skills, even if he was a senior engineer, would not be able to enter elder song’s sight under normal circumstances. It was even more impossible for elder song to be so clear about his position.

Hence, Xia ruofei immediately nodded and said,””Understood!”

“Engineer Liao, please follow me!” Xia ruofei said to Liao Jun.

Liao Jun nodded at Xia ruofei politely and said,””I’ll have to trouble you. ”

A person who could eat at the same table as elder song was definitely not simple. Liao Jun naturally would not neglect Xia ruofei just because he was young.

Xia ruofei brought Liao Jun to the guest room where he had rested last night. As he turned on the computer in the room, he said,””Engineer Liao, we’re going to visit an overseas IP address. Please note it down.”

“Alright!” Liao Jun said, and then immediately took out a pen and a small notebook that he always carried with him.

All technical experts had this habit. Many of them would carry a pen and notebook with them so that they could record information at any time.

Xia ruofei gave Liao Jun the IP address of the Morde organization’s internal website and then worked on the desktop computer to figure out the address to access overseas. There were some procedures to be done first. Xia ruofei’s method was simple. He bought a temporary VPN last night and successfully opened the internal website of the modr organization.

Of course, this was only a login interface, and no information could be seen.

Xia ruofei took out the encryption dog that he had burned last night and said to Liao Jun,””This is a copy of the Ukey that we made after cracking it. You have to use the UKEY to log into the website. Remember to bring it with you later!”

“Alright!” Liao Jun said with a smile.

These were all basic operations. As a Senior Network Engineer, Liao Jun naturally did not need Xia ruofei to explain too much.

Xia ruofei inserted the encryption dog into the USB port of the computer. After entering the password, he started to enter the Manzila account password in the login box. At the same time, he also gave the password for the encryption dog and the account password for the modr organization’s internal website to Liao Jun.

Liao Jun quickly recorded it down.

Xia ruofei had already opened the internal website of the modr organization. He combined the screenshots he showed elder song last night and showed them to Liao Jun. He demonstrated everything, including the specific address of the computer that was used based on the fixed IP.

Liao Jun’s professional abilities had always been very strong. He was a somewhat famous Network Security Expert in the garrison District. As for the things that Xia ruofei demonstrated, he basically had an idea of what was going on after just one look.

Liao Jun was also a talent valued by the song family. He more or less knew about the internal affairs of the family, so when he saw the information, he knew what it meant. Before he came, manager Lu didn’t disclose anything, but he emphasized that it must be kept absolutely confidential.

At this moment, a huge wave was set off in Liao Jun’s heart.

This was the rhythm of breaking the heavens!

However, he was also a soldier. Even if he was a professional technical Officer, he was still well – trained. He did not lose his composure and quickly recorded all the information that Xia ruofei had provided.

In the end, Liao Jun even did it himself. He had to admit that his skills were very good. In the end, when he located the address through the IP, he was much more skilled than Xia ruofei.

After Xia ruofei finished watching, he smiled and said,””No problem, engineer Liao. I’ll leave it to you then. Also ... Please keep it a secret.”

“Don’t worry about that!”Said Liao Jun with a straight face. I’ll keep my mouth shut!”

“Thank you!” Xia ruofei said.

The two of them left the room. Elder song was waiting in the hall. When he saw Liao Jun and Xia ruofei, he asked,””There are no more problems?”

Liao Jun straightened his back and replied,””Please rest assured, chief! I’ve already mastered it!”

“That’s good. Hurry up and change into your casual clothes. We’ll set off now!” Elder song said.

“Yes!” Liao Jun replied.

The staff brought Liao Jun to change his clothes while Master Song chatted with Xia ruofei in the hall.

When Liao Jun came out, elder song smiled at Xia ruofei and said,””RUO Fei, leave the follow – up to me! You can go back now ... Oh right, don’t tell Qiming about this yet. He’s still recovering!”

“Understood!” Xia ruofei replied without hesitation.

Just as elder song and Liao Jun were about to leave, Xia ruofei’s phone rang. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He took it out and looked at the caller ID, and his expression became a little strange.

Elder song turned to look at Xia ruofei and asked,””RUO Fei, what’s wrong?”

Xia ruofei waved his phone and said,””It’s commander Liu Qunfeng,”

Elder song couldn’t help but laugh and tease,”Could the Liu family be good at fortune – telling? Ruofei, answer the phone first! Let’s see what they have to say! I’m guessing it has something to do with Liu haojun ...”

According to elder song’s judgment, the Liu family probably had no idea that Liu haojun, who was thousands of miles away in the Shaanbei province, was about to pierce through the sky. Therefore, Liu Qunfeng must have called for something else.

Xia ruofei nodded and answered the call.””Hello, chief Liu!”

“Mr. Xia!” “I hope I didn’t disturb your rest,” Liu Qunfeng said.
