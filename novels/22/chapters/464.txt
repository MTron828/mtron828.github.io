Xia ruofei flipped to the third page.

Focusing his mind, he began to input his mental force into the page. The Golden stripes on the page slowly began to move, assemble, and disappose......And finally formed a golden text.

This was Xia ruofei’s third attempt to unlock the third page. The first time, he felt that he was just one step away. However, after taking the soup a few days ago, he tried for the second time and still failed. It was clear that the difficulty of unlocking the third page was getting higher and higher.

But this time, Xia ruofei was full of confidence. He had a feeling that he would have no problem deciphering the contents of the third page.

Although he already knew that he would only be able to read the contents of the ‘soul puppet’ after he had unlocked the fourth page, he was still looking forward to the contents of the third page.

This time, Xia ruofei was not disappointed. The Golden words on the third page flashed one by one until the last word appeared on the page. The Golden words had completely stabilized. He did not even feel that his spiritual power was unable to continue.

Xia ruofei heaved a long sigh of relief. As he read the contents of the third page, he sat on the Jade futon and started to recover his spiritual power.

He didn’t even try to unlock the fourth page because he knew very well that if he wanted to unlock the contents of the fourth page, he would have to consume the spirit nourishment soup at least three to four times, or the spirit map space would level up again to allow his mental power to suddenly increase by a large amount. Otherwise, in his current state, it would be a waste of time trying.

In comparison, Xia ruofei was more concerned about the third page.

The contents of the jadeshi ointment took up the entire second page, and the third page started off with the contents of the “spiritual puppet.”

This was also the first time Xia ruofei had read the third page carefully. Although he had read a part of it when he tried to unlock it with his spiritual power, it was not complete. Besides, he had to concentrate all his energy on releasing his spiritual power and could not be distracted by reading the words that had already appeared.

The information about the “soul puppet” was not complete, but Xia ruofei was still shocked when he read it. Of course, he was more surprised.

According to the book’s description, this “soul puppet” was somewhat similar to the puppets in wuxia novels, but there was a big difference. It could execute simple orders from its master and make independent judgments in certain situations.

As the content was incomplete, Xia ruofei could not fully understand the soul puppet. However, it seemed to rely on a core with many complicated symbols to work. This core was obviously the most important part of the soul puppet, equivalent to the human brain.

After it was completed, Xia ruofei needed to store mental strength in the core. It was this mental strength that made the soul puppet not an ordinary puppet but a certain level of self – consciousness. Hence, it would completely listen to the master who injected the mental strength.

Xia ruofei’s first thought was,”I can finally free myself from all the tedious and repetitive work in the interspace!”

The spirit map space was Xia ruofei’s ultimate secret. He definitely could not tell anyone, but there were many cumbersome tasks in the space that could only be completed by him alone.

If he had the soul puppet, Xia ruofei would be much more relaxed.

As the contents of the fourth page had not been unlocked, Xia ruofei had no way of making this magical puppet.

However, the third page listed a lot of materials and the manufacturing methods of some parts. Xia ruofei could start preparing now!
