After President Lin finished speaking, he secretly observed Xia ruofei. When Xia ruofei heard the price of 2.1 million, he didn’t even lift his eyelids and his expression was still very calm. ‘This young man is not an ordinary person ...’ President Lin thought. If a person from an ordinary family heard that a stick of ginseng could be sold at the sky – High price of 2.1 million Yuan, it was impossible for their expression to remain unchanged, no matter how good they were at maintaining their energy. Xia ruofei’s reaction could only mean that he was either very rich and 2.1 million was nothing to him, or that he was very familiar with the price and had expected it. President Lin muttered in his heart, isn’t the price too low? To be fair, this price was relatively fair, but this rare hundred – year – old ginseng couldn’t be measured by conventional standards, because it was in high demand but not in the market. The rarer something was, the more precious it would be. President Lin was thinking about whether he should raise the purchase price a little more. After all, if he missed out on such a precious hundred – year – old ginseng, he didn’t know when he would be able to find another one. Just then, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””This price is quite appropriate, but ...” At first, President Lin’s heart was slightly relieved, but when he heard the word “however,” he couldn’t help but feel nervous again. Xia ruofei continued,”I still have one wild ginseng. If I sell both of them, how much can you pay?” With that, Xia ruofei took out another paper box from his bag. Dr. Huang’s eyelids twitched when she saw a paper box of the same size. Could it be that there was another wild ginseng of similar size in there? Dr. Huang was shocked by his own thoughts. He thought to himself,”It was impossible! Absolutely impossible! Such wild ginseng could only be encountered by luck, and finding one was already a great fortune. How could he have two at the same time? President Lin gestured to Dr. Huang, asking him to verify that ran ran wasn’t an expert in this area. Professional things should be left to the professionals. Dr. Huang nodded and opened the box. Hiss ... President Lin and Dr. Huang gasped at the same time, and their eyes were filled with shock. It was such a Big Top quality wild ginseng! A situation that they didn’t even dare to imagine had actually occurred! Dr. Huang’s breathing became heavy. He immediately bent over and began to examine it carefully. President Lin looked at Dr. Huang nervously, and his palms were sweating. Xia ruofei smiled and said,”chief Lin, I was thinking of selling one at a time. After all, if I sell two at the same time, you might lower the price.” However, I see that your price is quite realistic, so I might as well sell them all to you! Of course, the premise is that the price can satisfy me!” Dr. Huang finished the identification process very quickly. He nodded slightly at Mr. Lin, indicating that there was no problem with the ginseng. The excitement on President Lin’s face hadn’t faded. He quickly calculated in his mind and said,””Sir, thank you for trusting us so much! We’ll take both of them for a total of 4.35 million Yuan. What do you think?” After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, President Lin naturally did not dare to lower the price. He had asked for 2.1 million for the previous one. The two ginsengs were almost the same size and weight. The total price should have been 4.2 million, but President Lin added another 150000 in hopes of making sure that Xia ruofei was satisfied with the price and could get these two precious hundred – year – old wild ginsengs. It was really too difficult to find pure wild ginseng these days. It could be said that it was almost extinct. These two ginsengs were purchased at the price of 4.35 million. If they met a rich Big Boss, Tongren Hall would make a big profit. In the eyes of an old Chinese doctor like Dr. Huang, such a precious wild ginseng should be kept as the treasure of the shop. It could be a rare medicinal herb that could save lives at a critical moment! Xia ruofei did not hesitate. He nodded and said,””Sure.” “That’s great!” President Lin said happily,”Thank you, sir! Thank you!” Soon, the pharmacy staff prepared the relevant transfer documents. After both parties signed, the pharmacy immediately started to transfer the money to the bank card that Xia ruofei had provided. When the staff was transferring the money, Mr. Lin personally chatted with Xia ruofei. He sounded like he was trying to test him, but Xia ruofei always changed the topic. At this time, a fat middle – aged man with a big belly walked into the Tongren Tang pharmacy in a hurry. The fat man was wearing a monkeller down jacket and a thick gold chain around his short and thick neck. He exuded a rich aura of a nouveau riche. As soon as the fat man came in, his eyes fell on President Lin and he said loudly,””Old Lin, I heard that you have the special grade Iron Skin maple?” When President Lin saw the fat man, he quickly apologized to Xia ruofei in a low voice and greeted him with a big smile. “Boss Hu, a new batch of goods arrived yesterday. I called you early in the morning to tell you about it!” President Lin said. “That’s nice of you, old Lin!”Boss Hu said with a satisfied smile. “Boss Hu, do you still want one kilogram?” President Lin asked tentatively. “Give me more this time!” Boss Hu said casually. You’ll run out of stock from time to time, and I don’t feel at ease buying from other places!” “Alright!” President Lin laughed. Then ... How much do you need?” “Two kilograms, I think!” “No problem!” President Lin said happily. Then, he quickly ordered the shop assistant to prepare the goods. Soon, the shop assistant brought out two large boxes of exquisitely wrapped iron – skinned maples and handed them to boss Hu. Boss Hu was obviously an old customer. He took it and opened it briefly, then said straightforwardly,””Alright! The bill please!” Xia ruofei was standing right beside the cash register, so when boss Hu came over, he moved to the side. Boss Hu took out a Platinum Card and handed it to the shop assistant. The shop assistant skillfully entered the price and handed the password device to boss Hu. Xia ruofei glanced at it and realized that it was two hundred thousand! He couldn’t help but be a little speechless. He couldn’t help but look at the two boxes in boss Hu’s hands. This iron – hide Kaede bucket is so expensive? If it’s 200000 Yuan ... Then one kilogram would cost 100000 Yuan! Xia ruofei calculated silently in his heart and couldn’t help but reveal a surprised expression. Very quickly, boss Hu finished swiping his card, bade farewell to Lin Zhong, and left with the iron maple bucket. At this moment, Xia ruofei also received a text message. President Lin walked over with a smile and said,””Sir, we’ve already transferred the money. Please check and receive it!” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.”Yes, I have. Thank you, Mr. Lin!” “You’re too kind!” President Lin quickly said,”Sir, this is my business card. If you have such good goods in the future, please consider our store at once!” Xia ruofei took the name card and smiled.””No problem,” he said. Then, Xia ruofei asked curiously,””By the way, Mr. Lin, can you introduce to me the fengdou that the boss just bought? Why is the price so high?”
