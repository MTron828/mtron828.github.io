2076 Another_Xia ruofei smiled as he admired the new yacht.””No problem! I’ll follow your arrangements!”

“Okay, Mr. Xia, we are now on the yacht’s underwater platform.” Liao Bo immediately introduced,”this model is a sports yacht. Although the size is relatively small in the entire series, the power is very strong ...”

Liao Bo was obviously very familiar with the business and some data was at his fingertips. He led Xia ruofei and introduced the yacht as they walked. Very quickly, Xia ruofei had a deeper understanding of this yacht.

The design of the yacht was very advanced and looked very high – tech. There was a large soft roof in front of the driver’s seat, allowing him to enjoy 360 degrees of sun without any shade.

On the lower floor, there was a circle of soft couches in the guest lounge area, as well as a large independent bedroom. Although the yacht was small, its layout was very reasonable. Every inch of space was used, and one would not feel crowded at all. There was only a luxurious and comfortable feeling.

After Liao Bo showed Xia ruofei around, the pilot, Liu Yi, started the yacht after getting Xia ruofei’s consent.

With the sound of the engine, the yacht slowly started and headed towards the sea.

This model of yacht had good sports performance. When it sped up, the sea breeze blew with a trace of salty smell, and the boundless sea made people feel relaxed and happy.

Xia ruofei sat in the driver’s seat for a while and then went down to the underwater platform at the end of the yacht. From there, he could see the snow – White water spray caused by the yacht, forming a white trace behind the yacht.

If it was summer, Xia ruofei would have jumped into the water to take a swim. Although it would not be a problem for him to go into the water no matter the temperature or environment, Liao Bo and Liu Yi would find it strange.

Hence, Xia ruofei held back the urge to go into the sea. After all, he would still be using the yacht in the realm after it was delivered. By then, he could enjoy the entire sea alone and swim however he wanted.

Liu Yi drove the yacht to the calm open sea, stopped, and anchored it. The yacht swayed gently with the waves.

Liao Bo started to introduce the entertainment facilities on the yacht to Xia ruofei.

In fact, many people who owned a yacht pursued a slow life. After all, only a few people drove a yacht like a speedboat.

They could choose a quiet harbor to fish, swim, or lie on the yacht to enjoy the beautiful sea and sky.

They could meet up with three to five confidants and have a small party on the yacht, tasting red wine and seafood barbeque ...

After stopping for about half an hour, the three of them drove the yacht back.

Today, Xia ruofei was mainly here to check on the yacht, including the custom – made interior, such as the jacuzzi and so on. He also wanted to experience the yacht’s performance. Everything was fine, so he returned to the yacht dock early. After all, there were still many procedures to be completed!

Soon, the yacht returned to the yuanhang dock.

After they went ashore, Liao Bo drove the electric car and brought Xia ruofei back to the office hall. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Mr. Xia, how do you feel?” The manager, Qin Lan, came out to greet him and asked with a smile.

“Not bad, you’ve basically met my expectations.” Xia ruofei nodded.

“If there’s no problem, the yacht can be handed over to you after you pay the remaining payment!” Qin Lan said with a smile.

“You’re in charge of all the relevant procedures, right?”Xia ruofei nodded.

Qin Lan nodded.”We’re the ones who handle all the registration procedures. We’re very familiar with the maritime department. It’ll be more troublesome for the customer to handle it by himself.”

In fact, before purchasing a yacht, one needed to apply to the maritime department, and the contract could only be purchased after it was approved.

Xia ruofei had signed a commission agreement when he made the order, so he did not have to go through these procedures himself. Now that the yacht had arrived at the port, Qin Lan’s company was in charge of the follow – up procedures. It was much more convenient.

Xia ruofei smiled.”That’s not a problem then. I’ll go and pay the rest.”

“Mr. Xia, this way please!” Qin Lan immediately said.

Xia ruofei swiped his card and paid the rest of the money. He had plenty of balance in his card and there was no limit to the amount he could swipe. 1.85 million was swiped out in one go.

Qin Lan personally received Xia ruofei. She put the card receipt, receipt, and some other administrative documents into a folder and handed it to Xia ruofei. She said,””Mr. Xia, thank you for your trust in our brand! Congratulations on owning your own private yacht! We’ll hurry up with the relevant procedures and complete them in a week at the latest. When the time comes, I’ll get little Liao to contact you!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said,”if I’m not at the three mountains by then, please send the documents to the peach blossom mansion in the Bell Tower District. I’ll get someone to collect them.”

“No problem!” Qin Lan said,”by the way, you can use the yacht as usual during this period. If you encounter an inspection by the maritime department, you can just show the documents I gave you just now.”

Xia ruofei nodded to show that he understood. It was similar to a temporary license plate of a car. It was valid for a certain period of time.

Qin Lan continued,”Mr. Xia, our company also provides yacht – related services, including berth rental, daily maintenance, and yacht Driver Services. You can consider applying for a member package. You will get a lot of discounts in terms of fees.”
