Chapter 384: The correct usage of jaded skin ointment (1)

Xia ruofei replied without hesitation,”there’s no need, uncle Ling. I’ve rented a warehouse in the city. You can just get someone to transport the wine to the warehouse.”

Now that Xia ruofei thought about it, it was much more convenient to rent a warehouse in the city. There were so many people in the farm. If the wine was transported to the farm, Xia ruofei would not be able to store it all in the origin space. However, if it was transported to the warehouse, there would be no such worries.

All he needed to do was to put all the wine in the warehouse into his interspace, then lock the door and leave.

“That’s even more convenient!” Ling Xiaotian said happily,”ruofei, I will instruct the winery’s management team to purchase a batch of 250 – kilogram wine jars. Arrange for people to transport the wine over in the next few days!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”uncle Ling, Drunken Eight Immortals is an old brand. The name and trademark are quite valuable, so we don’t need to change them. However, the outer packaging must be redesigned. It would be best to separate them into several different grades.”

“You don’t need to worry about these things!” Ling Xiaotian chuckled and said,”I’ve already instructed my men to do it. Also, in the initial stage of our new wine’s release, I’m also preparing to bombard the local media with a wave of advertisements to make our presence known!”

The Drunken Eight Immortals had a great reputation in the three mountains. Thus, Ling Xiaotian’s strategy was to establish himself locally. After the new Drunken Eight Immortals wine had gained a lot of reputation, he would gradually expand his business.

Xia ruofei laughed in embarrassment.”Uncle Ling, you’re advertising, building a new factory, and purchasing equipment. You must have spent a lot of money, right? Why don’t I invest some of my money in it?”

Initially, Xia ruofei did not want so many shares. However, Ling Xiaotian was insistent, so Xia ruofei had to agree reluctantly. However, Xia ruofei had also made his stand clear that after acquiring the winery, he would have to pay for the new investment according to the proportion of the shares. Otherwise, he would feel uneasy.

“I have a general understanding of the situation at your farm. Although you make quite a lot of money every day, there are many places where you spend money. You don’t have to invest in the winery ...” Ling Xiaotian said with a smile.

“That won’t do!” Xia ruofei quickly said.

Ling Xiaotian waved his hand and said,”let me finish first. I will register every sum of money I spend. When the time comes, the portion of money that you should pay will be deducted from your dividends!” It’s settled then, uncle Ling doesn’t lack this bit of money!”

“Then ... Alright!” Xia ruofei said embarrassedly,”I’m a little tight on cash recently. I invested in a farm in Australia and spent a lot of money ...”

“Woof! You’ve even invested it overseas!” Ling Xiaotian said in surprise,”not bad, ruofei. You’re expanding very quickly!”

“It just so happens that an elder has already bought a farm. He’s willing to take me to play, so I invested some money in it.” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”it’s just a small fight! How can I compare to you, who does big business like this?” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I heard that the return on investment of the farms in Australia is very average!” Said Ling Xiaotian. I’m afraid it’ll take a long time for you to recoup your capital. Won’t it affect your business in China?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”We’re planning to introduce Taoyuan vegetables to Australian farms. We’re also mainly selling high – end farm products. The profit margin should be much higher than that of traditional farms.”

When Ling Xiaotian heard this, he instantly felt much more at ease. He smiled and said,””That’s not a bad idea! It’s good that you’re confident. ”

Ling Xiaotian was well aware of the magic of paradise vegetables. Currently, Ling Ji restaurant was extremely popular in Sanshan city. It had taken the initiative in the competition between the restaurants of the same name. This was all thanks to paradise vegetables. Hence, when Ling Xiaotian heard that Xia ruofei was preparing to promote paradise vegetables in Australia, he was quite optimistic about it.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”Oh, right. Uncle Ling, you said that you wanted to order a big wine jar. I suggest that you order a few different styles to differentiate the different grades of white wine.”

“That makes sense!” Ling Xiaotian said. Little Xia, that’s a good idea! I’ll get someone to design a few different white wine bottles and packaging. After some improvements from your side, different wine jars can be filled into different bottles!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

Ling Xiaotian stood up and said,”ruofei, I’ll go back to the company and make some arrangements. Don’t leave in the afternoon. Stay at home and chat with Qingxue. I’ll be back in the evening. Let’s have a meal together!”

Xia ruofei quickly stood up to send him off. He thought to himself,”father – in – Law understands me. He’s trying to create an opportunity for me ...”

As they watched Ling Xiaotian’s car leave the villa, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue looked at each other. Ling Qingxue’s face blushed slightly, and she took the lead to return to the villa.

Xia ruofei chuckled and quickly caught up to her. He hugged her soft and delicate body.

Ling Qingxue’s body stiffened, and she said in a small voice,””Let me go ... Madam Chen is still at home ...”

“Shall we go upstairs then?” Xia ruofei asked, grinning.

“What do you want to do?” Ling Qingxue asked as she glanced at Xia ruofei.

“Yes,” Xia ruofei replied with a serious face.

Ling Qingxue was stunned for a moment. She thought about it carefully before she came back to her senses. Her pretty face instantly turned red and she kept punching Xia ruofei’s body. She said coyly,”Hooligan, pervert, bad guy ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and picked up his satchel from the sofa. Then, he put his arm around Ling Qingxue’s shoulder and walked up the stairs.”Wife, I’ve also prepared a gift for you! Come, let’s go to your room ...”
