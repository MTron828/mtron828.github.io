Chapter 1224: Chapter 747 – finalized_1

“Speak!” Feng Jing said.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”this auction is nominally a cooperation between paradise Corporation and Hengfeng group. However, when signing the relevant agreement, I will use the name of my offshore company. This is because I hope that all the profits this time can be transferred to my offshore company’s account.”

If the auction was held in Hong Kong or overseas, the profits could be easily transferred to the offshore company’s account. Xia ruofei was naturally not willing to let go of such an opportunity.

If the money was transferred to a domestic company’s account, there would be many cumbersome operations to transfer it out in the future. It might not feel much usually, but once a large amount of money was needed overseas and time was tight, it would be more troublesome.

After all, paradise corporation’s future development would definitely be out of China and into the global market.

Feng Rao nodded without any hesitation.”No problem. It’s all your money anyway ...”

Feng Jing couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

If it was in the past, she might have tried to fight for it, but now that the jaded skin cream sold well, paradise Corporation had a large amount of cash flow and would continue to earn money in the future, so she didn’t care much about the income from this auction.

Furthermore, as she had said, the entire company belonged to Xia ruofei. How could anyone have any opinions on how he wanted to handle the funds?

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”alright, it’s settled then!” I’m still in contact with the source of truffles. After I’ve finalized it with Hengfeng group in a few days, you’ll be in charge of the rest of the connection and coordination. ”

“Understood!” Feng Jing smiled.”I’m ready anytime.”

Xia ruofei had asked for her opinion on the funding as a form of respect. She felt warm inside and was in a good mood.

“Alright! Then you can go back to your work!” Xia ruofei stood up and said,”Ling Yun is urging me to get the green tea. I have to go and settle this!”

Feng Jing stood up and sent Xia ruofei to the office door. She smiled and said,””Our peach blossom Da Hong Pao is selling like hotcakes on the e – commerce platform! Ling Yun and the rest were also full of energy now! I think we need to set up a special department as soon as possible to be in charge of the tea leaves. Also, you’d better find a new Director of Security as soon as possible!”

Feng Rao pursed her lips and laughed.

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment and said,”that makes sense!” I think Ling Yun prefers to make tea leaves, so I’ll let him do this!”

“That’s what I meant!” Feng Rao said with a smile.

“I will consider it! Go and do your work! “You don’t have to see me off ...” Xia ruofei smiled and waved at Feng Rao before he left her office.

After Xia ruofei left Feng Jing’s office, he drove straight to the warehouse in the city.

Now that the warehouse had been bought by Xia ruofei, the core secret of the spirit painting scroll could not be leaked. It would be much more convenient to have such a transit point. Since the landlord was interested in selling it, Xia ruofei might as well buy it out.

When he arrived at the warehouse, he called ye Lingyun and asked him to bring a truck over to transport the tea leaves.

Xia ruofei had asked Xia Qing to prepare these tea leaves yesterday.

The quantity was not as much as the first time. The main reason was that the tea gardens in the mountain sea realm could only be harvested once every few months. Thus, they could only rely on the tea trees in the Archean realm to supply them.

Xia ruofei had already instructed Xia Qing to immediately pick and store the tea leaves once the tea trees at the Archean realm could be picked. Today’s batch was accumulated after three to four times of picking.

Xia ruofei calculated the time. Just as ye Lingyun was about to arrive, he took out the prepared tea leaves from the space and placed bags of tea leaves neatly in the warehouse.

Ye Lingyun arrived at the warehouse very quickly.

A small truck loaded up all the tea Green. On the way back, Xia ruofei asked ye Lingyun to get in his car.

“Ling Yun, I’ll have to trouble you again!” Xia ruofei said with a smile as he drove.

“I’m not tired at all. I like making tea!”Ye Lingyun chuckled. And I also feel a sense of accomplishment when I see the sales of our tea leaves are so hot!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”then, are you willing to specialize in tea leaves?”

Ye linyun was stunned for a moment and asked in surprise,””Brother Xia, tea leaves don’t require much energy! It’s all staged, is there a need to be fully responsible for this?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it might not be in stages!” In the future, after we sort out our relationship, I should have work all year round. ”

In theory, tea leaves could be picked in all Four Seasons, such as pre – rain tea, pre – rain tea, as well as autumn tea, summer tea, winter tea, and so on. The main difference was the variety of tea leaves and the different production areas, so the picking time would be different.

Therefore, it was not unreasonable for Tea Green to be provided every season.

Hearing this, ye linyun revealed a trace of joy and asked,””Brother Xia, can we really provide such high – quality tea leaves in the future?” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Are you interested in helping me manage this area? Don’t worry, you’ll be in charge of the tea leaves business, so your pay will still be on par with the company’s Department Director. You might even earn more, because this is linked to performance. ”
