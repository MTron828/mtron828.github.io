Chapter 3403: Light at the end of the tunnel (1)

Translator: 549690339

Originally, the mission for this level wasn’t a golden thread nether snake at its peak. Instead, it was a golden thread nether snake with a cultivation level equivalent to a middle Jindan stage cultivator. This kind of golden thread nether snake wasn’t fully mature yet and its strength was much lower. It was suitable for a golden core stage cultivator to train.

However, since it was Xia ruofei who was challenging the stage, the green – robed elder increased the difficulty.

Of course, since Xia ruofei was going through the levels with Ling Qingxue, according to the previous rules, the difficulty of the mission would be increased, and the number of missions would be doubled. Hence, the difficulty of this mission did not exceed Xia ruofei’s expectations.

The green – robed elder was indeed fond of talents. That was why he had focused on Xia ruofei’s progress. There was only a mirror in front of him that could check the situation in the trial Pagoda. He could only look at Xia ruofei’s side and naturally could not see the performance of the others.

Even so, the green – robed elder had no intention of “changing channels”. He did not care about Chen Xuan and the others who were also challenging the levels. All his attention was on Xia ruofei.

However, the elder only admired Xia ruofei. If Xia ruofei’s life was in danger during the trial, he would not help. The trial was a screening process. If he could not pass the trial, it would be useless even if he survived.

The world of cultivation had always been cruel to the extreme.

The green – robed elder had met many talented juniors in his long cultivation life. However, most of them had disappeared in the long river of history. Hence, he would not give Xia ruofei special treatment just because of his outstanding performance.

When Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue had encountered the goldthread nether snake, the elder in the green Daoist robe had thought that Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue were dead for sure. He felt a little regretful. He did not expect Xia ruofei to be so clear – headed in such a desperate situation. He had managed to find a way to survive even when there seemed to be no other way out.

The green – robed elder couldn’t help but Mutter to himself,””This little guy looks really good! Do you want to…”

Halfway through his words, the green – robed old man shook his head and said,””If he can’t even pass such a test, then he won’t be able to survive in the future. Return to that land of despair to struggle on whilst at death’s door? What’s the point of that?”

After mumbling to himself, the green – robed elder made up his mind and decided to wait and see.

The spirit painting was still rolling and flying upwards. Due to the gravity, its speed was naturally getting slower and slower. When the goldthread nether snake realized what was going on, it quickly chased after it along the cliff, its speed getting faster and faster.

Although the two humans had disappeared into thin air, the scroll that had suddenly appeared still made the goldthread nether snake chase after them relentlessly.

The distance between it and the spirit painting was also getting smaller and smaller.

At this moment, Xia ruofei, who was in the time formation of the spirit map space, was paying close attention to the situation outside while thinking of a solution. He had been in the formation for almost an hour but still could not come up with a good solution.

Once he left the spirit map space, the outside would be filled with poisonous mist. Even though he could put up his Yuan Qi barrier again, he was much slower than the snake. The cliff was at least three to four hundred meters high, and he wouldn’t be able to reach the top in time.

Moreover, even if he managed to escape to the top of the mountain, he still wouldn’t be able to defeat the goldthread nether snake if he didn’t make preparations in advance.

The mountaintop only had a radius of about three kilometers, surrounded by cliffs on all sides. The bottom was filled with poisonous fog, so there was no way to escape.

Xia ruofei couldn’t even repeat what he had done just now. He had thrown the scroll with all his might before the snake could react. Now that the snake had its eyes on the scroll and was moving at a faster speed, it would take at least two to three seconds for Xia ruofei to leave the spirit map and continue throwing the scroll. It would be enough for the snake to catch up. It would be even more dangerous then.

Xia ruofei racked his brain but could not think of a good solution. The main reason was that he had not found the snake’s weakness and had no idea where to start.

The most important thing now was to escape. It seemed that it would be very difficult to escape. The goldthread nether snake seemed to have its eyes set on the spirit map, and it had no intention of giving up.

Could it be that he could only hope that the spirit map scroll had enough defensive power to render the goldthread nether snake helpless? Xia ruofei thought to himself.

But even so, Xia ruofei was still very passive and things were out of his control.

Although Xia ruofei was in the time formation and the time flow was almost 2000 times faster than the outside world after the time formation of the upper realm was superimposed, he still had plenty of time. However, he could not think of a good solution no matter how hard he racked his brains. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, a voice rang in Xia ruofei’s mind.” “Fellow Daoist Xia, you don’t seem to be in a good state …”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, but then he realized that it was the voice of master Yuntai.

His first reaction was to move the mysterious ore into the time formation he was in..
