2802 Holding the whistle (1)

Six minutes of stoppage time made the Spanish manager, Ruby, furious on the sidelines. He pulled the fourth official and said,””It’s ridiculous. There weren’t many breaks in the second half, and they actually added six minutes? Why don’t you just make up for half an hour?”

The fourth official stared at Ruby and said,”please mind your words!” I’ll record your words!”

Ruby still wanted to say something to vent his dissatisfaction, but he was quickly pulled back by his assistant manager.

It was not a wise choice to go against the judges at this time. Ruby was so angry that he couldn’t control himself.

From Ruby’s big reaction, it could be seen how passive the Spanish team was at the moment.

There were often rumors that Barcelona was being taken care of. Whether in La Liga or in Europe, Barcelona often benefited from some controversial penalties, including in Europe. Barcelona often drew good lots in the groups. Other big teams struggled in the group of death, but Barcelona could easily sweep the weak teams and advance, which also produced many conspiracy theories that there was something fishy about the Champions League draw.

Today, Spain had lost a good game and now they were faced with such a long overtime. It should be known that a lot of things could be done in the end of the game in six minutes. The Spanish team was likely to not even be able to hold on to a single point, which Ruby could not accept.

The players on the field saw the time for the stoppage time and could not help but secretly complain. However, they did not have time to think about these boring games. They would not stop just because the regular time was up. After entering the stoppage time, Barcelona’s fierce attack continued. They had to do their best to hold on to the score.

Xia ruofei and Wu Lei also took part in the team’s defense. Xia ruofei even retreated to the penalty area to help with the defense.

Bar?a’s morale was high. Even though their physical strength had reached its limit, their offense was still as smooth as flowing water. Their skilled small – scale cooperation made their penetration in the middle extremely sharp, and the Spanish defenders could only run around.

At the 94th minute of the game, zujarís, who was in excellent form today, received a straight ball from lakiti ? and was about to make a powerful volley in front of the penalty area.

The Spaniard’s Center back, Naldo, rushed forward to block. He did not expect that zuárez’s shot was just a feint. A simple spike from him was enough to clean Naldo up.

Before Naldo, who had lost his balance, fell to the ground, he made up his mind and pulled on suyass ‘Jersey. Originally, suyass had already started to get ready to break into the penalty area to shoot, but with Naldo’s pull, he suddenly lost his balance and fell back heavily.

Buzzzzzz!

A sharp whistle was heard. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

After falling down, zuyares flew into a rage. He immediately got up from the ground and rushed toward Naldo.

After he dodged Naldo’s shot, he was already on his own. Even if he did not break into the penalty area, he would swing his leg and shoot directly on the spot. With his hot feet today, the probability of him scoring was still great.

However, Naldo’s pull made his hopes of scoring a goal vanish into thin air.

He had already scored two goals today, and one more would be a hat – trick!

If he could help the team beat Espanyol at the last minute with a hat – trick, he would definitely be the Savior of the game.

However, all of this was ruined by Naldo’s pull.

As soon as the referee blew the whistle, he quickly ran to the scene of the incident.

Nalmore stood up expressionlessly. He didn’t say a word in the face of the Furious suyass. However, just because he didn’t speak didn’t mean that Naldo was afraid. He still stared at suyass arrogantly and didn’t Dodge.

Just as the two of them were arguing, the main judge ran to the scene of the incident and separated the two of them. The teammates of both sides also ran over and separated the two of them.

Messi put his arm around zuyares ‘shoulder and said loudly to him,””Calm down! There was not much time left in the game! We need to score goals now. We can’t waste a single second!”

Despite suyass ‘stomach full of anger, he did not dare to act rashly in the face of the team’s absolute boss, Messi. After a few curses, he turned around and walked away resentfully.

On the other side, the main judge came to Naldo and said,”You should know what kind of punishment you will get, right?”

Naldo nodded and turned to the sidelines without a word. According to the rules of football, the last defender who committed a tactical foul on the opposing player would be sent off with a red card.

Just now, after zuyare had bypassed Naldo, he had already gotten the opportunity to face the goalkeeper alone. Naldo’s tactical foul had directly destroyed an absolute scoring opportunity, and zuyare had formed a single – handed knife at that time. There was no doubt about such a foul opportunity, and it would definitely be sentenced to death.

Sure enough, when Naldo walked to the sidelines, the referee behind him raised a red card high at his back.

The Spaniards ‘situation was even worse. Their main center back was sent off with a red card.

Of course, the only good news was: There was only a minute left until the end of the game. Even without Naldo, the remaining players could grit their teeth and persist.

Their only thought now was to keep this hard – won point.
