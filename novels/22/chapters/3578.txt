Jiang Dashan didn’t say anything, but Jiang Hua couldn’t help but laugh and said,””We’ve already gotten the money, so stop the land circulation? Who Do You Think You Are?”

“Has the peach blossom company signed an official contract with the village?” Xia ruofei asked indifferently.

Without waiting for Jiang Dashan and Jiang Hua to speak, Xia ruofei immediately continued,””As far as I know, in order to show their sincerity in the cooperation, the Paradise Corporation paid the land transfer fee in advance. In fact, the official contract has not been signed yet, am I right?”

Xue Jinshan had reported this to him when Xia ruofei was inspecting the pharmaceutical factory in the morning, so of course, he knew about it.

Xia ruofei looked at Jiang Dashan and said,””Old Secretary, if the Paradise Corporation wants to terminate the cooperation, it’s just a matter of one word. As for the money we’ve given out, we’ll naturally have to take it back.”

Jiang Dashan smoked his pipe and didn’t say anything. Jiang Hua sneered,””Who Do You Think You Are? Do you think you can terminate the cooperation just because you want to?”

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”Oh, I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Xia ruofei. I’m the chairman of the peach blossom company. The Peach Blossom Farm and the peach blossom pharmaceutical factory in Changping are all my properties.” Do you think… 1 can terminate the cooperation?”

Hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Jiang Dashan could no longer maintain his composure. His expression changed.

Jiang Hua’s mouth was also wide open as he looked at Jiang Cuihua in disbelief. He couldn’t understand why Jiang Cuihua had never mentioned that her godson was so capable and rich. Since the peach blossom company was Xia ruofei’s, why would Jiang Cuihua, as his godmother, hold onto him for the sake of 9000 Yuan?

Jiang Dashan cleared his throat and said,””Oh, it’s President Xia. This … There’s a misunderstanding…”

“1 don’t care if it’s a misunderstanding or not. 1 just want to know, first, my godmother didn’t sign it, and second, she didn’t give the authorization, so how did the land circulation fee go to someone else?” Xia ruofei asked coldly,”if there isn’t a clear explanation for this, I think it’s not as simple as just terminating the land transfer. Changping County’s TW station and ZF station have always been very supportive of paradise Corporation. 1 think they’ll be happy to help us investigate this matter. After all, we’re a big taxpayer and a star company. The land transfer this time is so important. It’s important to find out the ins and outs.”

“It was a mistake in our work.” Jiang Dashan felt a chill run down his spine.”Director Xia, 1 will investigate it thoroughly. Please give us a chance and don’t alert the higher – ups.”

Jiang Hua finally came back to his senses. He shouted,”Third Grandpa, what are you afraid of? He said he was Xia ruofei and you believed him? Maybe he was just pulling a Tiger’s skin and pulling a big flag? Besides … Even if he was Xia ruofei, so what? Did paradise Corporation want to terminate the cooperation just because they wanted to? We’ve already agreed on this! How could he take back the money he had given? There was no such logic! I’ve already spent all my money anyway! Even if they end the cooperation, I can’t pay them back! 1 don’t have money, but I’m dead!”

Xia ruofei sneered and said,””A scoundrel?”

“I’m just being shameless, what are you going to do?” Jiang Hua also went all out, his face was full of indifference.

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”the peach blossom company has dozens of law enforcers. They’re usually too free. It’s not a bad idea to give them something to do.” It was nothing more than a lawsuit and wrangling! We have time and patience. It doesn’t matter if you don’t have the money. The court will enforce it. Your house, car, cash, jewelry… I hope you can transfer them all without leaving any evidence!”

“You…”

“Oh right, even if you’re really a penniless pauper, do you think we can’t do anything to you?” Xia ruofei stared at Jiang Hua and said,”it’s only right and proper to pay back what you owe. Don’t think that the Paradise Corporation only knows how to reason with you. We don’t have any other means. You don’t think that a multi – billion dollar company can’t deal with a hooligan like you, do you?”

“Ah Hua! Don’t say anymore!” Jiang Dashan shouted with a dark face.

Then, Jiang Dashan said to Xia ruofei,””President Xia, I’m really sorry. Cui Hua is also our relative, we don’t mean to deliberately target her. This is a mistake in our work. Jiang Hua really can’t take out any more money. Our village will pay for this first and give it to cuihua. In the future, Jiang Hua will return the money to the village!”

“I don’t have money…” Jiang Hua muttered.

“You shut up!” Jiang Dashan scolded angrily.

Xia ruofei revealed a playful smile and said,””This little hooligan really can’t take out a single cent?”

“Isn’t this just a coincidence?” Jiang Dashan smiled apologetically.”Ah Hua invested the money. It’s not easy to get it back.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Xia ruofei walked up to Jiang Hua and stared into his eyes. He asked calmly,””Where did the money you took under false pretense go? Is there really not a single cent left at home?”

To others, Xia ruofei’s question did not sound special. But to Jiang Hua, it was as if his voice had a magical power that made him lose himself in it.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power had already reached the spiritualization realm. Hypnotizing an ordinary person who had no foundation in cultivation was a piece of cake. It was as easy as blowing off dust..
