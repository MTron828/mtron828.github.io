Chapter 1654: Temporary departure from the capital (1)

When the call came, Xia ruofei and song Rui were having a drinking contest. The others were also drinking and the atmosphere was very lively.

Xia ruofei didn’t look at the caller ID and picked up the phone.””Hey! Who is it?”

There was some gibberish from the phone. Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment before he realized that the person on the other end of the phone was speaking English. He took a look at the phone and realized that it was old West, the person in charge of the winery in Australia.

After Xia ruofei returned to her senses, she stood up and walked out of the private room. Then, she asked in English,””Uncle Wester? Is there anything I can help you with?”

“Boss,” Old West said.”I hope you can come to the winery immediately!”

Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat. He asked,””What happened? Is there a problem with the grape trees?”

“Yes,” Old West said seriously,”not only did something happen, but it’s a big problem! Boss, you’d better come and take a look yourself!”

Xia ruofei was confused. Those grapevines were high – Quality species that he had cultivated in the spirit map space. When he planted them, he had added a lot of spirit Heart Flower petal solution in the irrigation tower! How could there be a problem?

This didn’t make sense!

“What happened?” Xia ruofei could not help but ask,”uncle Wester, what’s wrong with those grape trees?”

Old West could no longer suppress his excitement and laughed.”Xia! Are you scared?”

Xia ruofei also came to his senses and said,””Uncle Wester, it’s such a wonderful afternoon. Instead of accompanying Auntie kaberli for her afternoon nap, you’re making an overseas call to play with me. Is there any meaning to it?”

There was a two – hour time difference between Australia and China, so it should be around three in the afternoon.

Old Wester laughed and said,””Boss, I’m not joking with you. Those grape trees are really abnormal! Do you know? The grapes in our two vineyard’s are completely ripe!”

Xia ruofei was a little confused and asked,””Isn’t it the season for grapes to ripen in Australia? What’s the problem?”

“Is there a problem? The boss! “I might not have explained it clearly ...” Old West said.”Our grapes are fully ripe, and they all meet the brewing standards! Moreover, the quality of the grapes was quite good! This was the first year of planting the grapes! My family has been running wineries for generations, and I’ve never seen a Semillon that could be used to make wine in its first year! The best species will take at least two to three years!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. So Old West was making a big fuss because of this!

He had grown these grapes in the spirit map space and had absorbed a lot of precious spirit Qi. He had also added the spirit Heart Flower petal solution into the irrigation pool, so in his opinion, it was normal to be able to harvest them and use them to make wine in the first year.

Hence, Xia ruofei did not even think about it.

It would be abnormal if it took two or three years to make wine! Besides, Xia ruofei could not wait that long.

Old West was still excited.””Boss, if I didn’t take a sample of the grapes for the test and everything was normal, I would have suspected that your grapes were genetically modified ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”uncle Wester, you even took it for testing?” Isn’t that a little too careful?”

“This batch of grapes is growing too fast,” Old West said seriously.”It’s beyond common sense. I have to be responsible for the winery’s customers! If it wasn’t for the test, I wouldn’t have known that the quality of this batch of grapes was so high! It was a miracle! It was God’s masterpiece! I can guarantee that this batch of Semillon will be the best of its kind in the market ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but find it funny as he listened to Old West’s passionate jabbering.

He said,”Alright, alright, uncle Wester, thank you for telling me this good news!” I’m very happy! Is there anything else?”

Old Wester was stunned for a moment and said,””Boss, of course there is! I want to ask when you’re coming to Australia? I’ll be able to confirm the time to brew the wine!”

Xia ruofei was also stunned. He asked,””Do you still need me to be there when you’re making the wine?”

“Of course! You’re the owner of the winery!” Old West said,”this is the most important and meaningful moment of the year for the winery. How can you be absent?”

After hearing Old West’s words, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel tempted.

The scenery in Australia was pleasant. Whether it was Paradise Farm or the winery, the environment was very good. In addition, Xia ruofei was also a little curious about the wine – making process, so he had the idea of going to Australia.

Of course, Old West’s attitude had a certain effect. His matter – of – fact tone made Xia ruofei feel a little embarrassed not to go. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

He pondered for a moment and said,”uncle Wester, I understand.” I still have some things to deal with in China. After I’m done here, I’ll come back as soon as possible!”

“Boss, you’d better hurry up,” Old West said.”It’s the rainy season in Australia. I can’t guarantee that our grapes won’t rot if we don’t harvest them soon ...”
