3066 The rising Dragon Order (1)

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, then immediately cried out in surprise,””Senior Yuntai, you’re awake!”

Layman Yuntai said,”that ... Please mind your words!” I’m in closed – door cultivation, not sleeping ... Why should I wake up?”

“Yes, yes, yes ...” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”you’ve finished your closed – door cultivation ... By the way, do you know this five Holy badges?” Oh ... This is the name given to this token by the cultivation world. It’s called the rising Dragon Token, right?” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Upon hearing this, Yuntai laughed and said,””The five Holy badges? What a stupid name ... But one thing is quite appropriate. There are indeed five Rising Dragon tokens in total. ”

“Then tell me about the rising Dragon Order!” Xia ruofei perked up.”Because many inheritances are missing, there are many different opinions about the five Saints ... Er, the rising Dragon Token. The mainstream opinion is that if you collect all five tokens, you can open a complete ancient cultivation cave ...”

“Ancient cultivation?” Layman Yuntai asked with some doubt.

“This is what the cultivation world calls the cultivators of your era.” Xia ruofei smiled and explained,”we usually call the cultivators of your era the ancient cultivators.”

“I’ve become an ancient cultivator?” Layman Yuntai had a very strange feeling.

“That ... Senior Yuntai, is it convenient for you to tell me about the rising Dragon Order?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Of course!” Scholar Yuntai replied readily. But ... I don’t know much either!”

Xia ruofei was happy when he heard the first half of the sentence, but the smile froze on his face the moment he smiled.

“Didn’t you recognize it at a glance?” Xia ruofei asked in confusion.

“That’s because the rising Dragon Token was very famous in our era, and it appeared many times in the cultivation world,”said layman Yuntai with a bitter smile. However ... Being able to recognize it did not mean that he understood it very well. In fact, in our time, everyone’s research on the rising Dragon Token has not yielded any results ...”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””So ... The rising Dragon Token isn’t the key to opening the ancient cultivator ruins?”

“If the ancient cultivator ruins you’re talking about is the immortal’s cave of a cultivator from our era ... Then I can tell you with certainty that it’s definitely not!” Said layman Yuntai.

Then, he continued,”I’ll tell you what I know!” I hope it will be of some help to you!”

“Thank you, senior Yuntai!” Xia ruofei quickly said.

“The first time this Rising Dragon Token appeared in the world of cultivation should be the year I first entered the sect. At that time, I was only a sweeping boy at the first level of the aura refining realm.” The voice of layman Yuntai was full of reminiscence of the passing of time,”at that time, it was the sect I was in that received a token. If I remember correctly, it should be the third token.”

Token number three was now in the hands of Valley master Liu of the flying flower Valley. When Xia ruofei thought of this token that had appeared more than three thousand years ago in the sect of master Yuntai, he couldn’t help but have a very wonderful feeling.

“About a hundred years later,” the scholar continued,”five tokens appeared in the world of cultivation one after another.”

“Have you guys tried to put the five tokens together and study them?” Xia ruofei could not help but ask.

“Of course! Otherwise, we wouldn’t have known that this token was called the rising Dragon! The second episode won’t know that there are five tokens in a set!” Layman Yuntai said,”at that time, the five sects that had obtained the rising Dragon Order gathered together under our sect master’s call and took out their respective tokens. When these five tokens appear in the same place, they will automatically combine together and the words ‘Rising Dragon’ will appear. That’s why we named them the rising Dragon Token. ”

Xia ruofei suddenly understood and said,”I see ... I finally know the origin of the rising Dragon.” Then, senior Yuntai, did you find anything after the rising Dragon Order was combined?”

“I was only in the Golden core stage at that time,” said layman Yuntai. “I was just an insignificant character in the sect. How could I participate in such an important matter?” However, I don’t think there were any results from the study, because everyone took the rising Dragon Token back after splitting it up. Our sect master also agreed that every fifty years, the people holding the rising Dragon Token would come to our sect to meet again. The purpose was naturally to study the rising Dragon Token ...”

“After such a long time, you still can’t find any results?” Xia ruofei asked in disbelief. “Indeed,” Scholar Yuntai said,”what’s even more surprising is that after almost 300 years, these five Rising Dragon orders all disappeared. Whether they were stored in a storage ring, in a secret room, or protected by layers of arrays, they all disappeared without exception, including the one in our sect. At that time, our sect leader thought that it had been stolen. After contacting the other forces with the rising Dragon Token, he found out that everyone’s Rising Dragon Token had disappeared ...”

“I can’t believe there’s such a thing ...” Xia ruofei could not help but frown.

It had been more than three hundred years ... It had been about that long since venerable mountain river had placed the rising Dragon Order in the spirit map space. Didn’t that mean that if this rule was still in effect, the rising Dragon Order could disappear at any time?

“It’s indeed very strange,” said master Yuntai.”And after the rising Dragon Token disappeared, it would appear in the cultivation world again after about ten years.” It’s also because of this that many sects and forces in the cultivation world have actually possessed the rising Dragon Token before. No matter which force has this token, everyone will gather together regularly and combine the tokens to study it, but there has been no progress. “
