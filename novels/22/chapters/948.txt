Chapter 949: Noob’s evolution (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei frowned and said,””If that’s the case, it’s going to be a little troublesome ... The spiritual energy in the outside world is very poor, and cultivation will be very slow.”

Xia Qing said,”master, it’s not that you can’t cultivate in the spirit map world at all. It’s just that you need to control the time. The spirit map world also needs a process to absorb spiritual energy and recover.” In addition, you can prepare as many jade stones as possible. It’s best to find a few more boundary stones. After the spirit map world has evolved, you can cultivate for a longer time. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I know.” Xia Qing, I’ll leave it to you to plan my cultivation time in the spirit map space in the future. You must ensure that the spirit map space itself is not damaged. ”

“Alright!” Xia Qing said,”master, I suggest that you read more of the inherited ancient books in the human jade talisman, especially in the area of using mental energy. Now that you are at the fourth level of Qi refining, you should be able to draw the spirit gathering talisman with the true Qi in your body and the use of mental energy after a certain amount of practice. In this way, you can also cultivate through the Spirit gathering talisman even in the outside world.”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said.

Xia ruofei was very interested in the knowledge in the ancient books. To him, it was as if a whole new world was slowly being unveiled. Everything was so fresh.

However, Xia ruofei was not in a hurry to study the books. He said,””Xia Qing, the last time you suggested for me to take Tang Haoran as a disciple, I have already discussed it with his parents and also obtained his consent. Tomorrow, Haoran will officially become my master, but I don’t seem to be ready to be a master yet ...”

After he finished speaking, Xia ruofei smiled bitterly. He was a newbie in cultivation and had no experience at all. How could he teach his disciples?

Xia Qing smiled and said,”is master worried about the matter of teaching cultivation techniques? In fact, there’s no need to worry about it at all, this child is just at the time to build his Foundation. According to my speculation, this child should have a pure yang Constitution, so you only need to choose a pure yang attribute cultivation method to teach him, and then leave a small part of innate pure Yang Qi for him. I believe that his cultivation speed will be very fast. ”

“He’s too young. I don’t know if he’ll be able to learn it,”Xia ruofei said.

Xia Qing smiled and said,”if he has a pure yang body, then cultivating a pure yang attribute cultivation technique will definitely yield twice the result with half the effort. Master, you can use your true Qi to circulate a few times in his body according to the cultivation technique’s route, and just remind him to remember it. I believe that with master’s control of mental energy, it should be very easy to do so.”

“That’s a good idea!”Xia ruofei’s eyes lit up.

“To be on the safe side, master can bring him into the spirit map space tomorrow,” Xia Qing said.”I’ll check and confirm for him. As long as he has a pure yang body, this method will definitely be effective.”

Xia ruofei hesitated and said,”bring the child into the spirit map space?” This is a little inappropriate ...”

The spirit map space was his biggest secret. He couldn’t reveal it even to the people closest to him, not to mention that Tang Haoran was still a child. It was hard to guarantee that he wouldn’t accidentally reveal it, and there would be endless trouble if that happened.

Xia Qing smiled and said,”master, since we’re going to bring him into the spirit map world, we can’t bring him in his conscious state.” You just need to check the ancient books related to spiritual power. With your spiritual Power’s realm, it’s easy to learn a few tricks to hypnotize people. ”

Xia ruofei finally understood and said with a bitter smile,””It seems that I still know too little about cultivation. I’ve decided to focus on studying those books and Scriptures. You can remind me when it’s almost dawn in the outside world!”

The time in the Archean realm flowed 30 times faster than the outside world. In theory, one night in the outside world was equivalent to more than ten days in the Archean realm.

“Alright!” Xia Qing said,”master, then I won’t disturb your cultivation and study.”

Xia ruofei nodded and then thought of something. He stopped Xia Qing, who was about to leave, and asked,””I’m going to officially take Haoran as my disciple tomorrow. I have to prepare a gift for him! Do you have any good suggestions?”

Xia Qing said without hesitation,””The best gift would naturally be the protective jade talisman that you made yourself, master!”

“A protective jade talisman?” Xia ruofei asked, frowning.

“Master, have you forgotten? The human jade talisman’s unlocking rune has another function, which is to be used as an amulet rune. ” Xia Qing said with a smile,”as long as you carve the runes on a Jade of good quality and inject true Qi into it, it can be guaranteed that it will not lose its effect for at least one or two years.”

“But I can only barely use my mind power to construct runes.” Xia ruofei said,”I think it’ll be difficult to carve the runes on the Jade since I have ten days left ...”

Xia Qing smiled.”It might have been difficult in the past, but master, you’re now a fourth – Stage Qi refining cultivator. Using true energy to complement your mental power, I think you should be able to do it after a few more practices.”

Xia ruofei frowned and said,”then I’ll have to practice first. If I really can’t do it, I’ll have to choose other gifts.” By the way, do you have any Jade in the space?”

Without the Jade, Xia ruofei would not have been able to come out in the middle of the night in Australia.

“There’s still a dozen jade stones left after I set up a spirit gathering array for the spirit heart tree.” Xia Qing nodded and said,”I can bring them to you at any time if you want to use them, master.”

Xia ruofei said,”I’ll practice using my spiritual power to construct runes first!” When I’m more familiar with it, I’ll try again with the Jade!”

“Yes, master,” Xia Qing said,”if you need anything, just tell me!”

Xia ruofei nodded and indicated for Xia Qing to go to the mountain sea realm to do her work. He then went to the spirit pond and laid down on a chair. He closed his eyes and began to “read” the ancient books in his mind.

In fact, this information had already been imprinted in his mind, but he still needed a process of digestion and absorption, especially when it involved the use of spiritual power and medical skills. Understanding the theory was one thing, and putting it into practice was another. These were not things that could be achieved overnight.

For the next few days (during the time of the primal realm), Xia ruofei stayed in the spirit map space.

In the first few days, Xia ruofei had spent most of his time digesting the knowledge in the books. He was very interested in the strange yet magical cultivation knowledge and allusions. He did not even have the mood to absorb and understand the vast knowledge of Chinese medicine in them.

After studying these books, Xia ruofei realized that even cultivation was divided into different systems. Someone like him who started by refining essence into Qi belonged to the cultivation system. There were also people who specialized in spiritual power and ancient martial arts.

Spiritual power and ancient martial arts were also divided into realms. For example, ancient martial arts cultivators were divided into yellow – rank, Mystic – rank, earth – rank, heaven – rank, and above them were Xiantian – rank.

Every realm of ancient martial arts was divided into the early stage, middle stage, and late stage.

The early, middle, and late stages of a yellow rank martial artist were equivalent to Qi disciple Level 1,2, and 3 respectively.

If a practitioner of ancient martial arts could reach the Xiantian realm, they would be comparable to a cultivator at level 10 of the Qi refining stage.

Xia ruofei was now at Qi cultivation stage level 4, which was almost the same as a Mystic early phase.

When he was learning this part, Xia ruofei felt that the title “Mystic class warrior” sounded familiar.

He carefully thought for a long time before he suddenly remembered something.

Back then, the evil young master Liang Haiming had coveted Ling Qingxue’s beauty and had been so bold as to send his subordinate, Black Panther, to kidnap Ling Qingxue. At that time, Xia ruofei was just about to go on a date with Ling Qingxue and had witnessed the scene of Ling Qingxue being kidnapped in the car.

Then, Xia ruofei drove his car and chased after Heibao’s car. Finally, he stopped Heibao’s car.

In a fit of rage, Xia ruofei killed for the first time after his retirement. After defeating Heibao, he stuffed all the people involved in the kidnapping into his car and created the scene of them driving drunk and falling off a cliff.

Later on, Xia ruofei even used the Hornet that he kept in the medium to send young master Liang to the end of his life.

When Xia ruofei saw the words “Mystic class warrior”, he finally remembered the desperate roar of Heibao, who was on par with him at that time.

“My master is a black level master, he won’t let you go ...”

At that time, Xia ruofei was filled with hatred and only wanted to go back and kill Liang Haiming. He did not take these words to heart.

Now, Xia ruofei realized that Heibao’s master must be a practitioner of ancient martial arts. Heibao must have been a practitioner of ancient martial arts as well, which was why he was so powerful.

Although there was no comparison, Xia ruofei felt that Heibao’s strength had reached a higher level. As for which level of the Golden class, he had no idea.

Xia ruofei could not help but frown.

He didn’t expect practitioners to still exist on earth, and he’d made an enemy of a Mystic without even realizing it.

However, he soon felt relieved.

It had been a long time since that incident, and there was no response from the Liang family in Beijing. This meant that it had been done flawlessly, and there was no beginning or end to it.

Taking ten thousand steps back, even if Heibao’s master found out that his disciple’s death was strange and eventually traced it back to him, he would only be a Mystic class martial artist.

Xia ruofei’s current cultivation was already equivalent to a Mystic early phase martial artist, and his strength was far beyond that. He had never stopped practicing the movements of the little golden men, so his body’s strength was definitely far beyond that of cultivators of the same level.

Not to mention that his mental strength was also very strong, and he also had a great killing weapon like the spirit map space. Just the inheritance in the human jade talisman was beyond the imagination of the people in the cultivation desert outside, which was barren of spiritual Qi.

With the combination of genuine Qi and mental energy, Xia ruofei had a lot of tricks up his sleeve. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Even if Heibao’s master was a Mystic late phase master, Xia ruofei wouldn’t be afraid.

Hence, Xia ruofei did not think about it anymore and continued to swim in the ocean of books, greedily absorbing the nutrients like a sponge ...
