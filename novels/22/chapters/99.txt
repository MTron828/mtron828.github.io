Lightning was a little confused by the sudden change in its surroundings. The air outside was much worse than the air in the space, which made it unhappy. However, when it saw Xia ruofei, it immediately pounced on him in surprise. It wagged its tail around Xia ruofei, trying to please him. Although Xia ruofei had only been outside for a few hours, it felt like it had not seen its master for a few days. It felt like they had finally met again after a long time. Xia ruofei stroked its smooth fur and smiled.””Lightning, this will be your home from now on.” Woof! Woof! Woof! Lightning called out happily and licked Xia ruofei’s hand affectionately. Xia ruofei brought lightning downstairs and turned on the heater in the guest room. He told lightning to rest in this room for the night and told it to go to the yard to relieve itself. Such a simple order was not difficult for lightning, who had intelligence, to understand. She could only make do with it tonight. Tomorrow, she would ask the construction team to help build a kennel in the yard, so that lightning could have her own room. Xia ruofei played with lightning for a while before letting it stay in the guest room on the first floor. Then, he went back to his bedroom to rest. The next morning, Xia ruofei first prepared the vegetables for Xi Jiang Yue club and Ling Ji restaurant. After the purchasing staff from both restaurants transported the vegetables away, he prepared a simple breakfast. The workers at the construction site were almost at work. Xia ruofei found manager li and asked him to find two carpenters to build a big kennel in the corner of the villa’s yard. Lightning was very satisfied with its ‘new home’ and wagged its tail at Xia ruofei. After settling the issue of Lightning’s accommodation, Xia ruofei brought it around the villa again, marking out its “sphere of influence”. In the future, lightning would have to shoulder the heavy responsibility of guarding the house. Xia ruofei checked on the progress of the construction site and went to the backyard to cook the cabbage. Soon, he had a leisurely day. At around fouro’ clock, Xia ruofei explained to lightning and drove away from the villa, heading straight for San Shan city. After picking Guan Ping up from the real estate agency he worked for, Xia ruofei found out that Yuan Lili had set the meeting place to be at their alma mater, the second high school of Xuanji Sanshan. “What’s the situation? How did you run to second middle school to meet up?” Xia ruofei asked as he drove. “Yuan Lili said that she wanted to visit the old place again. I guess they will be there in a few afternoons!” Guan Ping laughed and said,”we’re just working adults. We can only gather at this time and then go to the hotel together.” “A visit to an old place?” Xia ruofei laughed.”How long has it been since Yuan Lili last came back to the three mountains?” “I heard that she went abroad to study and then stayed in the United States to work.” Guan Ping said,”this time, I’m going out again after the engagement.” “Understood!” Xia ruofei nodded. Sanshan second high school was not far from Guanping company. It did not take long for Xia ruofei to reach the school. Having studied here for so many years, Xia ruofei was naturally familiar with the terrain here. He quickly found a parking space and parked the car. Then, the two of them strolled towards No. 2 middle school. When they arrived at the entrance of No. 2 middle school, they saw a group of people walking out of the campus. Surrounded by the crowd was a woman in her late twenties. She was dressed very fashionably and even had light makeup on her face. She was Yuan Lili, who was treating them today. Xia ruofei could still vaguely remember Yuan Lili’s appearance when she was in middle school. In comparison, she had indeed changed a lot. However, her outer appearance was still the same as before. If they met on the street, Xia ruofei might not be able to recognize her. Seeing the two of them, Yuan Lili showed a smile and said,””Guanping, you guys really came at the right time!” “The office workers can’t help it!” Guan Ping laughed and said,”I didn’t delay anything, did I?” “That’s true ...” Yuan Lili smiled and turned to Xia ruofei.”You’re Xia ruofei, right?” You haven’t changed much from back then!” “Yuan Lili, congratulations!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “Thank you!” Yuan Lili said with a faint smile on her face. At this moment, the other students came forward to greet him. One of the chubby boys punched Xia ruofei’s chest and scolded him jokingly,””Xia ruofei, I heard that you’ve been back for two to three months and you still haven’t come to find me. Do you not see me as your brother anymore?” This person was pang Hao, Xia ruofei’s good friend in junior high school. Xia ruofei had been in the Army for seven years and had basically cut off all contact with his junior high classmates. After he returned from the Army, he had no intention of contacting his classmates at all because of his terminal illness. After he obtained the spirit map space, he focused on his career development. Xia ruofei hugged pang Hao and said with a smile,””Little fatty, you’re becoming more and more horizontal! I should call you fatty now, right?” “You, this fellow, are you rubbing it in?” Pang Hao’s small eyes widened as he chided with a smile. The other students also came up to greet Xia ruofei, especially the female students. They looked at Xia ruofei with sparks in their eyes. These classmates in Sanshan city were more or less in contact with each other. However, Xia ruofei had joined the Army after graduating from high school and there had been no news of him ever since. Hence, he was a little mysterious to his classmates. Furthermore, Xia ruofei had absorbed a lot of petals from the exotic flowers. His entire aura had changed slightly, and there was a faint sense of affinity. This was one of the main reasons why little Huanhuan was willing to get close to Xia ruofei. In addition, Xia ruofei’s appearance was not bad, so the eyes of the single female students were shining. Suddenly, Xia ruofei became the focus of everyone’s attention. He was not used to it and could only pretend to be polite to the students who had a vague impression of him. At this moment, a voice rang out,””Haha, ruofei, it’s been ten years since we last met. You’re still so popular!” Xia ruofei turned around and saw a male student. He was wearing a suit and his leather shoes were as shiny as his hair. He looked like a groom. However, the fake smile on his face lacked some sincerity. Xia ruofei quickly tried to recall and then asked with uncertainty,””You are ... Liu Hang, class monitor Liu?” “I thought you didn’t remember me! Haha, not bad, not bad. You can still remember. ” Liu Hang said with a smile. Liu Hang was the class monitor of Xia ruofei’s third year of junior high. At that time, Xia ruofei was the Sports Committee member and also a member of the class Committee. However, they had never been on good terms. In the third year of junior high, Xia ruofei often skipped self – study at night to go out and play basketball. Liu Hang had snitched on him a lot. Hence, Xia ruofei could recall his name after a while. “Forget anyone but the class monitor!” Xia ruofei laughed when he saw Liu Hang’s confused look. “Haha, ruofei, I heard that you didn’t do well in the college entrance examination that year, so you went straight to the Army?” Liu Hang asked. Xia ruofei smiled faintly.”That’s right. I didn’t get in. I didn’t want to study either. So, I went to the Army!” “Actually, being a soldier isn’t bad. It’s a good way to train people!” Liu Hang said. Then, he immediately changed the topic and deliberately showed a puzzled look.”But as far as I know, there are people who retired from the Army for two years, five years, and eight years. Why did you come back after seven years? Did you make any mistakes in the Army?”
