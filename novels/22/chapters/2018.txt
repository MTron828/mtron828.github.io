2019 Chapter 1126 – one after another

Lui Hai’s Horton car was parked at the corner of the intersection. The bar across the street was a bit blurry in the drizzling rain. Lui hai fixed his eyes on the road ahead. Although he was confident in Xia ruofei’s strength, he still felt nervous.

Lui hai felt a shadow flashed by the door of the bar, but he didn’t see it clearly. It seemed that he was just dazzled. When he looked again, he didn’t see anyone.

However, only two or three seconds later, the door of the passenger seat was opened. Lui hai was shocked. He had been on the road for more than ten years, but he didn’t notice that someone was so close to him and opened the door.

Lui hai reached for a large – caliber pistol on his waist.

It’s me!

Hearing Xia ruofei’s familiar voice, lui hai relaxed.

A thought appeared in his mind. Could it be that he wasn’t seeing things just now The shadow at the bar entrance was Mr. Xia

The parking place was more than 100 meters away from the entrance of the bar, but Xia ruofei only took two or three seconds to get back to the car. He was several times faster than the fastest 100 – meter sprinter in the world ... Lui hai was speechless. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Xia ruofei sat down and said,It’s done! Let’s go to the next place!

Lui hai came back to his senses and answered excitedly,Yes!

He started the car and quickly drove out of the parking space, driving in the opposite direction of the bar.

After driving for another ten meters, lui hai saw a large group of people rushing out of the bar in anger through the rearview mirror ...

Those people naturally didn’t think that Moyes ‘murderer could run more than 100 meters away in just a few seconds, so they didn’t pay attention to the Hutton car that was gradually disappearing into the night. Instead, they spread out and searched the nearby area while shouting.

......

At 2108, Moyes Gehrman was killed by a mysterious Asian with a single palm at the Scarlet Dusk Bar, which he frequented the most. Then, the Asian left.

At 2120 am, the third son of the elder of the Gehrman family, Adam Gehrman, who was in charge of the family’s finances and was known as a business genius, was working overtime in the company office. He was killed on the spot by a black – clothed Asian with a finger through his temple.

Adam Gelman’s bodyguard watched as the eastern man jumped out of the 19th – Floor office window after killing Adam. It was as if gravity had no effect on him. He didn’t rely on any equipment to assist him. He only lightly grabbed the outer wall a few times during the fall and landed lightly on the ground. Then, with a strange flash, he disappeared into the night at an extremely fast speed. It was almost impossible for the naked eye to catch his movement trajectory.

At 2133, old Gelman’s younger brother, philgeman, who was in charge of the internal order of the family, was attacked by a mysterious Easterner on his way home after attending a dinner party and died on the spot.

Filgeman’s driver survived. According to his description, he was driving back normally when an Asian Man in Black suddenly jumped onto the front of the car as if he had fallen from the sky. It looked like he had only stomped his foot lightly, but the engine of the car had been destroyed through the hood.

Immediately after, the Asian man raised his hand, and a sharp light flashed. The car’s windshield broke, and when the driver turned back, he saw an ordinary stone embedded in the space between philgeman’s eyebrows. Phil’s eyes were wide open, and he had died on the spot.

At 2146, old Gelman’s second son, Pedro Gelman, who was in charge of the family’s drug business, was happily rolling flyers in his lover’s house when a masked Man in Black suddenly appeared in front of his bed. Before he could react, a punch landed on his heart. Without even making a sound, Pedro Gelman tilted his head and went to see Satan.

Pedro’s lover witnessed everything with her own eyes, and she was so scared that she almost had a mental breakdown. In her terrified and incoherent story, she said that the masked man was the incarnation of the devil.

The two first – Class bodyguards of the Gelman family who were standing guard below Pedro’s lover’s building didn’t react at all. They had no idea that someone had sneaked into the house and killed the person they were protecting.

At 2208, old Gehrman’s cousin, Silvio Gehrman, who was in charge of the family’s arms business, was conducting an arms deal. An Easterner in black sneaked into the abandoned car recycling factory where they were doing their business and nailed Silvio to the ground with a rusty steel bar. Silvio wailed for three minutes before he died.

The Men in Black were very fast, coming and going like the wind. The Gunners brought by Silvio could not react in time.

They vented their anger on the small family that bought firearms from the Gelman family. They thought it was a trap set by the small family, so the few people from the small family who participated in the deal were shot into sieves by the angry Gunners.

......

The core members of the Gelman family had been assassinated one after another. In less than an hour, five people had died.

The Moore Manor had been renamed to the Gelman Manor.

This place was originally the residence of the core members of the Moore family. After the Moore family was almost uprooted, the Gelman family took the responsibility of receiving the spoils of war.

Old ghelman’s eyes were bloodshot, like a wild beast. On the floor in front of him, there was a pile of ceramic fragments. A few minutes ago, these ceramic fragments had not turned into fragments. They were relics from the Ming Dynasty of China and old ghelman’s favorite collection. Now, they were smashed into pieces by the angry old ghelman.

The servants at home were hiding outside the door in fear. No one dared to come in to clean up at this time. They had no doubt that if they touched bad luck now, they would definitely be torn to pieces by the brutal old Gehrman!

From nineo’ clock in the evening, the news of the assassination of the core members of the family came one after another. Those who were killed were his most beloved grandson, his most valued son, his most trusted brother ... On each person was a photo left by the murderer, and on the back of the photo were Arabic numbers of different sizes ...

The assassination of each of them was no less than cutting a piece of flesh off old Gehrman’s heart.

Anger, sorrow ... A variety of emotions were intertwined. Old Gehrman’s body trembled involuntarily, and he had fallen into a state of madness.

Who are they Who did this! Old Gelman’s voice was hoarse as he roared,investigate it immediately! I’ll find him tonight, and I’ll tear him into pieces! Cut off his flesh and feed it to the dogs!

In the shadows, someone bowed slightly to old Gelman and then quickly disappeared into the darkness ...

Old Gelman panted heavily and only gradually regained his calm after a long time. His face was dark as water as he said,Immediately inform all the family members that from now on, no one is allowed to leave the manor! The family members who were outside had to return immediately! Tell them to pay attention to safety on the road! Bring more people to protect him!

Yes! Another person bowed slightly and disappeared into the darkness to convey old Gehrman’s orders.

In the rainy night, the Horton car was like a ghost that was taking lives as it shuttled through the city that was gradually filled with the smell of blood.

Lui hai, who was driving, couldn’t control his excitement, asking,Mr. Xia, there are still six main targets. This place is not far from Moore Manor. Should we go to the manor first

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,there’s no hurry. Let that old man live a little longer. I want him to personally see his family fall apart. He can’t do anything about it! I’ve decided to kill target number one last!

Yes! Lui hai answered,then we should go ... Near the museum. Target No. 5 lives there! According to our brothers intelligence, he should be in his own home right now!

Xia ruofei nodded and said,sure! However ... Inform zhengfeng that they can start the attack! Tell them to be careful. The Gehrman family must have received the news by now. Although it will inevitably increase the difficulty, at the same time, they will definitely be in a mess. This is the best time to make a move ...

Understood! Lui hai took out his phone excitedly and dialed the number,zhengfeng, Mr. Xia said we can start now!

Lu zhengfeng could not wait any longer. He had urged Xia ruofei to send his men from the Hong sect to collect intelligence and to keep an eye on every target. Thus, Lu zhengfeng had already known from his subordinates ‘reports that Xia ruofei had been successful in his assassinations without any effort.

Lu zhengfeng couldn’t wait to go to war with the headless Gelman family to vent the resentment he had accumulated recently.

Therefore, after hearing lui Hai’s words, LV zhengfeng was so excited that his voice changed,Received! Big brother hai, let’s get started!

Xia ruofei said indifferently,ah hai, tell zhengfeng to act according to his ability. If there’s any difficulty, he must inform me at once. I will go and help him!

Yes, Mr. Xia! Lui hai said.

Then, he said to Lu zhengfeng, who was on the other end of the phone,Zhengfeng, did you hear what Mr. Xia just said

I heard it! Big brother hai, please thank Mr. Xia for me! Lu zhengfeng said,please rest assured, Mr. Xia. Once things go south, I’ll immediately ask him for help!

En! Lui hai said,go! Be careful!

After hanging up, lui hai asked,Mr. Xia, now ... Shall we go to the museum first

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,no hurry! Let’s just wait for them! I think that after that old man learned of this series of news, he would definitely recall the core members of the family in a hurry! Drive the car into the forest and hide. Without my order, you’re not allowed to stick your head out, understand
