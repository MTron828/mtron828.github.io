Jennifer is quite successful in her children’s education.” Tang Yitian said proudly,”although his family is well – to – do, we’ve already started to cultivate his sense of independence when he was very young. It seems that the effect is not bad!”

“It’s indeed not bad!” Xia ruofei praised,”in the country, many children at Haoran’s age are still living a life of having everything provided for them. Without the adults, they can’t do anything. It’s very rare to have children as independent as Haoran!”

“The main credit goes to Jennifer!” Tang Yitian said happily.

“Oh right, big brother Tang, sorry to trouble you with the peach blossom company!” Xia ruofei continued.

This year, peach blossom company’s truffle auction would be held in Australia, and the location was chosen to be in Sydney. Tang Yitian had taken the initiative to handle many things here, including the reservation of the venue and the invitation letter sent by the Paradise Corporation. This would help them get their visas. He had also helped them book the hotels in advance and personally invited many famous people in Australia to come and support them. It could be said that he had done everything he could to the extreme.

“Ruofei, why are you being so polite with me?” Tang Yitian pretended to be angry. Isn’t your business my business?”

“I still have to thank him. Otherwise, wouldn’t I be an ingrate?” Xia ruofei laughed and asked,”big brother Tang, have the people from the Paradise Corporation arrived?”

“Not all of them are here.” Tang Yitian said,”three of them came as the advance party. I’ve already arranged a hotel for them. The auction will be held in that hotel too. It’ll be much more convenient for them!”

“You’re really thoughtful, big brother Tang.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Oh right, please book an extra room at that hotel and arrange for elder Zheng to stay there too!”

Zheng Yongshou followed Xia ruofei and was more or less cautious. Moreover, he didn’t want more people to know about Xia ruofei’s discussion with Tang Yitian. Even Zheng Yongshou, who had no problem with his loyalty, didn’t want to expand the scope of his information.

“A small matter!” Tang Yitian said with a smile. He took out his phone and made a call.’Tve asked the driver to drive you here. Mr. Zheng, you can go to the hotel now. They’ll help you check in!”

“Okay. Thank you, Mr. Tang!” Zheng Yongshou stood up and said.

Xia ruofei looked at Zheng Yongshou and said,””Old Zheng, have a good rest after you get to the hotel. Also, meet up with the people from the Paradise Corporation and see if there’s anything else you need to do. When the auction starts, come and find me. I’ll prepare the truffles and give them to you.”

“I understand! Mr. Xia!” Zheng Yongshou said.

Soon, the sound of a car’s engine could be heard from outside. The driver arranged by Tang Yitian drove a black Mercedes – Benz to pick up Zheng Yongshou.

Zheng Yongshou slightly bowed to Xia ruofei and Tang Yitian, then turned around and left. He got in the car and went directly to the hotel.

Jennifer smiled and said,”ruofei, if you have anything to discuss, go to the study!” I’m going to see how they’re doing with lunch! Haoran, you come with mom too!”

“Let’s go! Let’s sit in the study!” Tang Yitian stood up and said.

The two of them went to the study room. Xia ruofei sat down and asked with a smile,”Big brother Tang, judging from your excited look, the Foundation’s progress should be quite smooth, right?”

“It’s more than just relatively smooth! It’s simply too smooth!” Tang Yitian said happily,”! really didn’t expect that, Steve. Galiny was also so good at calculating his own wealth! And he really didn’t hold back at all! He was particularly experienced in handling such cases. In just over a month, almost all of the Galiny family’s assets in the mining industry had been transferred to the foundation without anyone knowing. In fact, these assets already belong to the foundation. As long as we want, we can change the owner of their company in a minute!”

Xia ruofei was not surprised by this, Steve. He had put a soul seal on Galiny, so his loyalty was absolutely full. Even if it was against his own business, or even if he was told to die, he would definitely not hold back.

If Steve. It was extremely abnormal for kalini to consider his own interests and the interests of the kalini family in this process.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it’s good that it went well!” I’m still worried that the secret might be leaked. When the time comes, 1’11 have to use thunderous means to suppress some idiots who are ready to make a move!”

Steve. Galiny is too professional!” Tang Yitian smiled and said,”he’s personally handling this matter. It’s simply flawless.” There were a few times when 1 overlooked small problems, but he was the first to notice them and filled in the gaps. I guess he’s done this kind of thing before … To be honest, I’m really impressed by her!”

“So, Grello? If Galini were to suddenly die at this time, there wouldn’t be any impact?” Xia ruofei asked calmly.

Xia ruofei used such an emotionless tone to say such murderous words. Even Tang Yitian couldn’t help but shiver.

Even though he knew that Xia ruofei was on his side and would not use the methods of a cultivator against him, he still could not help but feel a chill down his spine.

Tang Yitian steadied his mind and said,””It really doesn’t matter at this time! Even if there was a small – scale internal turmoil, it would not affect the overall situation! It can be said that we’ve already won!”

Then, Tang Yitian changed the topic,””However, I still suggest that we wait for a few more days.”

“Oh?” Xia ruofei asked in confusion,”since there’s no impact, why do we have to wait?” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Isn’t the Taoyuan company’s truffle auction in Sydney in a few days?”Tang Yitian said with a smile. If only Grello was still in Sydney. The Galiny family is not to be trifled with. Hence, Sydney will definitely be filled with tension and the police will increase their patrols. The celebrities I’ve invited might also give up on going to the auction for safety reasons …”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”understood!” He would let him live for a few more days. He had already waited for more than a month, so he didn’t care about a few more days. It just so happens that big brother tang can also take advantage of these few days to further strengthen his control over the Galiny family’s business and take precautions in advance against the Galiny family’s actions because of Grello. The internal turmoil and external pressure caused by Galini’s death.”

“That’s what I meant!” Tang Yitian smiled and said,”don’t worry, Grello. We’ve been keeping track of Galiny’s whereabouts, and this is Steve. Galiny provided it to me! So if you want to take his life, just go straight to him. He definitely won’t be able to escape from our hands!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. Then, he asked,””By the way, how’s Paradise Farm? Brother Liang’s recovery should be pretty good too, right?”

Xia ruofei calculated the time. The ointment that he left for Liang Qichao should be almost used up.

In other words, if everything went well, Liang Qichao’s injuries should have recovered by now.

Tang Yitian said,”the farm did as you asked and didn’t open new channels, but I’ve strengthened the support for Paradise Farm, including the sold well. Paradise Farm’s products have been adjusted to the most eye – catching position, so recently the sales have also increased significantly. At least, it can be basically the same as before when we sold them through multiple channels!” “Big brother Tang is really too awesome!” Xia ruofei gave him a thumbs – up and asked,”how’s brother Liang’s recovery? There shouldn’t be any problems, right?”
