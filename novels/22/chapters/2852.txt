2853 Getting unjustly ridiculed (1)

The two pieces of news that Xia ruofei released at the press conference on behalf of the Spanish club, in addition to giving The Sports Daily a headache, making Pablo completely disheartened, and making Meyers go all out, the most depressed one was the Herona club.

Xia ruofei announced at the press conference that he would be representing the Espanyol club in the weekend’s home game against Herona, which chilled the hearts of the club members.

Since the beginning of the season, Herona had been struggling in the relegation zone. Now, there were only a few rounds left, and they were still in the third – to – Last position. If they could not seize the time to grab points, according to the promotion and demotion rules of La Liga, the last three teams would be relegated. The probability of Herona being relegated to La Liga was already very high.

In the face of a mid – to – Low team like the Spaniards, it should have been a chance for Herona to grab points.

Even if Espanyol had killed off bar?a in the last round, on paper, Herona still had the ability to fight. Although the Spaniards ‘morale was high after their victory over bar?a, and it was a home game, Herona was still preparing for the league tournament this weekend with the mentality of at least one point.

Of course, this was under the premise that Xia ruofei did not appear.

Although Xia ruofei had only played one and a half games, his fame in La Liga was no less than that of the first – tier star players. Therefore, everyone knew about his situation. Everyone knew that Xia ruofei was not a professional player at all. He was a shareholder of the club and had a large company in China. He rarely trained with the team and would only come back to participate in crucial games.

Therefore, Heron did not even consider Xia ruofei.

Otherwise, based on Xia ruofei’s performance, their chances of getting points would be very slim.

Herona’s coaches and players were also secretly glad that Xia ruofei was not a regular player in the Spanish club. Otherwise, when the two teams met, the probability of winning would be too low.

They did not expect Xia ruofei to suddenly announce that he would be staying for the match this weekend in just a few days. The reason was that the Chinese players ‘abilities had been questioned by some reporters, so he wanted to slap them in the face with his actions.

The coaches and players of the Herona club felt like crying but had no tears to shed. This was a complete lie!

If one were to ask who hated The Sports Daily and Pablo the most, the Spanish fans might not be in the first place, because the first place must be the players from the Herona club.

There were even some Spanish fans who, after watching the news, cheered and thought,”Please, the media, doubt Xia and Wu to your heart’s content! This way, Xia could play more games for the team!

This was probably the first time that their own fans wanted their own club’s star players to be dissed!

……

After an emergency consultation, The Sports Daily finally released another statement in the afternoon.

This time, the statement was much more sincere. Although they still said that it was Pablo’s personal behavior and that the newspaper did not know that Pablo had fabricated completely fake news, they still expressed their sincere apologies for their work mistakes and apologized to the real Espanyol club, Espanyol fans, Xia ruofei, and Wu Lei who had been hurt. They also said that they would strengthen the review of news material in the future to prevent such incidents from happening.

In addition, The Sports Daily also strongly condemned Pablo’s unethical behavior in a statement, calling Pablo a “scum of the reporter community” and calling for his media peers to ban Pablo.

At this juncture, The Sports Daily could only stomp on Pablo. This was not considered adding insult to injury. At most, it could be said that they had a strong desire to survive in order to protect themselves.

In any case, after this incident, the credibility of The Sports Daily had dropped significantly. Although they had no credibility in the past and were very biased towards bar?a when reporting, it was the first time they had created fake news out of nothing. No matter how they tried to push the blame away and say that they were completely unaware, the public would not believe them. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

In that case, The Sports Daily was really a little wronged, because they did not instruct Pablo to do so. It was just that when they reposted, the editor – in – chief in charge of review had a trace of suspicion. However, from the perspective of being Pro – Barcelona, they reposted it immediately. So from this point of view, they could be considered to have brought it upon themselves.

The storm of public opinion became fiercer and fiercer. In addition to The Sports Daily, the other sports media in Spain and Europe seemed to be enjoying a feast. They constantly dug out news topics from various angles and followed up on the matter. They mercilessly beat the dog when it was down.

In the evening, another piece of news appeared in the public’s view.

This was a statement issued by the International sports reporters Association.

The abbreviation for the International sports reporters Association was AIPS. It was a top professional organization representing the International sports media. It had more than 9000 members around the world and represented the leading international newspapers, websites, journals, and radio and television channels of the five continents.
