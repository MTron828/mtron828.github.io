Chapter 1768: Act first and report later (1)

Xia ruofei didn’t know how to react. He was stunned and asked,””Insert advertisements?”

Gao Jun nodded with a smile.

Xia ruofei spread his hands.”Our Paradise Club doesn’t seem to need any advertisements. If we were to film the show on this land, it would be a very good advertisement in itself. However, with our target customers ...”

At this point, Xia ruofei shrugged his shoulders. Wasn’t he going back to the original topic? We don’t even care about the location of the show’s recording location that others are fighting for, so why would we care about the placement of advertisements?

Gao Jun chuckled and said,”President Xia, of course I know that the Paradise Club doesn’t need to insert advertisements, but the Paradise Corporation does!” And ... Agricultural products are naturally compatible with our program! The effect of inserting advertisements will be very good!”

Xia ruofei finally understood that Gao Jun was talking about this. He had to admit that Gao Jun’s suggestion made Xia ruofei’s heart beat faster.

Gao Jun saw through Xia ruofei’s intentions and continued,””Director Xia, you can think about it. In our program, the guests will eat Taoyuan vegetables and use Taoyuan Da Hong Pao to serve the guests. Then, they can exchange their labor for the Drunken Eight Immortals white wine ... We will also design a special advertisement slogan, which will be verbally broadcasted from time to time in the program. Finally, we will record several versions of scene advertisements, which will be inserted in between the programs ...” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Xia ruofei understood. He had watched the previous two seasons of life you yearn for. The treatment Gao Jun mentioned should be second only to a certain brand, monkey – faced Misha. It might even be more effective than Duoduo’s advertising.

The key was that it was free, so it was hard for Xia ruofei not to be tempted.

Xiangnan TV’s advertising fees had always been much higher than the average level of the industry, especially for such high – frequency placement advertisements, which cost an astronomical amount.

More importantly, the products of paradise Corporation were really in line with the theme of this show. It could be said that they could be planted seamlessly.

Not only Taoyuan vegetables, Da Hong Pao, and Drunken Eight Immortals, but also Chang Jiang anchovy, Cordyceps, iron – Skin dendrobe, and even the Jade skin cream could also be implanted.

Xia ruofei was well aware of the influence of such a phenomenal show. Peach blossom company’s reputation was not bad, but the only thing that really exploded in popularity was the Jade skin cream. The other products could only be said to be well – known in a small area. If they could make use of the show’s popularity, the company’s reputation would definitely rise by a large margin. The benefits for their future development were obvious.

“Brother Xia, I think the platform is a good idea,” Hou Liang said.”Why don’t you consider it?”

“Ruofei, I’ve heard of this show from xiangnan TV. It’s very influential. I think this cooperation will be beneficial to both sides!” Ling Qingxue chimed in.

Gao Jun smiled at Xia ruofei. He was confident that Xia ruofei would fall for him.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””Gao tai, thank you for your kind intentions, but I’m only a shareholder of the Paradise Association’s project. It’s not appropriate to use the Paradise Association’s resources to exchange for the benefits of our paradise Corporation. Let’s forget about it ...”

Gao Jun was stunned. He had offered such a good condition, but Xia ruofei had rejected it? Moreover, he had rejected her so directly ...

“Brother Xia, that doesn’t exist!” Hou Liang quickly said. We’re all Good Brothers, no one would care about this! Besides, working with xiangnan TV will also bring many benefits to the Paradise chapter!”

“It’s okay ...” Xia ruofei smiled and said to Gao Jun,”Gao tai, I’m sorry!”

With that, Xia ruofei pulled Ling Qingxue away.

“Young master hou, President Xia has quite the personality!” Gao Jun said with a bitter smile.

“Gaotai, brother Xia doesn’t have the final say in this matter!” Hou Liang quickly said. Don’t be in such a hurry to choose another place. I’ll talk to brother Jun and the others, and brother Xia will definitely agree!”

Gao Jun nodded.”Alright, I’ll be in Beijing for the next two days. I hope you can give me a definite answer before I return to xiangnan!”

“Definitely!” Hou Liang said. Definitely! I’ve troubled you for the high platform!”

“Young master hou is too polite!” Gao Jun smiled and said,”your business is my business. Besides, if we can reach a deal, it’ll be a win – win situation!”

“No matter what, I owe you a favor!” Hou Liang said,”Gaotai, I’ll take my leave first. I have to quickly find brother Jun, brother Rui, and the others to talk to them!”

Gao Jun smiled and nodded. Hou Liang went to find Zhao Yongjun and the others. Gao Jun wasn’t in a hurry to leave. Instead, he strolled around the scene with great interest, occasionally exchanging a few words with people he was familiar with.

On Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue’s side, Ling Qingxue asked in confusion,””Ruofei, director Gao’s suggestion is actually not bad! It’s a great opportunity for your company. Why did you give it up so easily?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”there will be many opportunities in the future. I don’t think I can do this this time ... We’ve all invested in Paradise Club. I only have a small share. I can’t use Paradise club’s resources to benefit my own company!” Even if brother Zhao and the others don’t care, I think this will change our pure brotherly relationship ...”

Ling Qingxue didn’t quite understand, but she still said,””Alright! As long as it’s your decision, I’ll support it!”

Xia ruofei gently touched Ling Qingxue’s nose and said,””Of course! The wife sang along with the husband! Your performance today was not bad! Continue to maintain it!”

Ling Qingxue pinched Xia ruofei’s waist and said,””I was just saying it casually, look at how smug you are!”

Xia ruofei burst out laughing.

At that moment, the number of people at Xu Lang’s side had gradually decreased. Hence, Xia ruofei brought Ling Qingxue along and walked over.

“Uncle Xu, thank you so much for today!” Xia ruofei said sincerely.

Xu lang laughed.”Mr. Xia, I’m just telling the truth. You don’t have to thank me.”

“In this day and age, it’s not easy to speak the truth. I’m especially touched that you’ve stood up for us in this situation!” Xia ruofei said.

“Hahaha! You’re too kind!” Xu lang smiled and said,”Mr. MA, Mr. Zheng, and Mr. Yang all told me to take care of you as much as possible if I met you in the mainland! I’m just doing what an old friend entrusted me to do. You don’t have to take it to heart. ”

Xia ruofei thought to himself,”it’s because of old Mister MA Xiong and the others.”

In fact, it was easy to guess that Xu lang was not related to Xia ruofei and the rest. Even if he had noticed something, there was no need to express his support so directly and clearly! Moreover, Xu lang had actually said some flattering words today.

Perhaps MA Xiong and the others had only mentioned it casually, but it had helped Xia ruofei a lot.

“Mr. Xia, is this your girlfriend?” Xu lang took the initiative to ask.

Xia ruofei quickly introduced,”yes!” Uncle Xu, her name is Ling Qingxue!”

“Hello, uncle Xu!” Ling Qingxue greeted him.

Uncle Xu looked at the two of them with a smile and said,””The two of you look like a couple. After you get married in the future, you’ll definitely be able to live a happy life!”

Ling Qingxue was instantly overjoyed. She hurriedly said,””Thank you for your kind words, uncle Xu!”

Xu Lang’s status was not ordinary. He was one of the top Feng Shui masters in Hong Kong. What he said was not just some ordinary auspicious words. It could even be said to be the words of gold and Jade.

Under normal circumstances, Xu lang would not say such things if he was not confident. If he was not careful, his reputation would be ruined. If Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue’s marriage was unfortunate in the future, and his words were to spread, it would be a slap in the face.

Xia ruofei also thanked Xu lang.

“I’m just telling the truth, you don’t have to be so polite ...”Xu lang said with a smile.

Then, Xu lang looked at Xia ruofei deeply, but he did not say anything.

In reality, Xu lang could tell from Xia ruofei’s facial expression that he was not only destined for a noble life, but he could also tell a few things about his marriage. However, it was not appropriate to say it in front of Ling Qingxue.

What surprised Xu lang was that even though Xia ruofei was clearly destined for many women, his physiognomy showed that he and Ling Qingxue were a harmonious and loving couple. He had only ever seen such a face on Haojiang’s gambling King he.

While Xu lang, Xia ruofei, and Ling Qingxue were chatting happily, Hou Liang found Zhao Yongjun.

Zhao Yongjun was currently chatting with a few special guests. He saw Hou Liang giving him a look from the outside, so he excused himself and quickly ended the conversation.

Zhao Yongjun walked in front of Hou Liang and asked in a low voice, “What’s wrong, liangzi?”

Hou Liang quickly recounted how Gao Jun had taken the initiative to offer an olive branch and offered very favorable conditions, hoping that the life you yearn for would work with the Paradise Club, but was rejected by Xia ruofei.

“What’s there to consider? just say yes!” Zhao Yongjun immediately said.

“But brother Xia ...” Hou Liang was stunned for a moment before saying.

“Why do you care what RUO Fei thinks?” Zhao Yongjun asked,”has director Gao left yet?”

“He’s still at the scene!”Hou Liang looked around and said.

“Bring me to him!” Zhao Yongjun said.

Soon, Hou Liang brought Zhao Yongjun to Gao Jun and gave him a simple introduction.

Then, Zhao Yongjun went straight to the point,””Director Gao, I think the conditions you mentioned to ruofei just now are very good. I can represent paradise to reach an agreement with you first!”

“Really?” Gao Jun was very surprised and asked. But President Xia didn’t seem to agree to it ...”

Gao Jun was also afraid that Zhao Yongjun and the others would have internal opinions that were not unified. If there were any changes to the show’s cooperation, it would be troublesome if they had to find a recording venue at the last minute.

Zhao Yongjun said without hesitation,”RUO Fei’s opinion doesn’t represent anything. Heng Rui company is in charge of The Peach Blossom Spring Association. I am the legal representative of Heng Rui company. I can make the decision on this matter!”
