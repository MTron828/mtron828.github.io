2355 Begin the operation (2)

Bao Guijun and the others also came back to their senses and ran over,”Good day, master!”

This group of people had completely given up on resisting, and their fawning looks were completely different from those of the Morde organization.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,””Time is precious, so I won’t waste any more time. Let’s hurry up and start assembling the mobile house!”

“Yes, master!” Bao Guijun and the others responded.

Xia ruofei’s mind moved slightly, and the half – finished parts that were scattered all over the place slowly floated up. Then, he accurately found a set of parts for the mobile house and used the invisible spatial force to place them in their respective positions.

Bao Guijun and the others immediately climbed up the ladder with their tools and used bolts and nuts to lock the parts one by one.

There were still too few people in the realm. This was a strong feeling that Xia ruofei had after completing this task.

Thirty mobile temporary houses could only be assembled one by one due to the lack of manpower.

By the time all thirty mobile temporary houses were assembled, more than ten hours had passed.

Bao Guijun and the others were so tired that they almost fell to the ground. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Xia ruofei looked at the results of the dozen hours of work with satisfaction and said,””Everyone has worked hard. Xia Qing, give everyone some extra food. Consider it my reward to them, and there is no need to deduct points!”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing said without the slightest hesitation.

When Bao Guijun and the others heard this, they felt their strength come back. They all rushed to express their infinite gratitude to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”Okay, okay!” After you’re done eating, take the time to rest. Everyone worked overtime today, so you can get up an hour later!”

“Thank you, master!” Bao Guijun said excitedly.

They had already passed the initial stage of fear. Now, it seemed that Xia ruofei was still a kind master. Although there was heavy work every day and they had no freedom, at least they were safe. They could clearly feel that living in this environment, even if they were so tired that they didn’t want to move a finger, they could still be full of energy the next day.

These days, everyone felt that their physical fitness had become much stronger.

Xia ruofei said,”remember this. As long as you are loyal to me and no longer have any fantasies, you can live a better life. Other than losing your freedom, you will feel like you are in heaven! Also.....You will have new companions soon. At that time, if any of you perform better, I can consider selecting a few managers!”

Bao Guijun and the others were even more excited. Becoming a manager meant that they didn’t have to do heavy physical labor, and it was easier to earn points. Their living conditions would also be greatly improved.

Since Xia ruofei wanted to recruit some new people, they would have an innate advantage if they arrived a few days earlier. As long as they worked hard, they could become managers.

From this point of view, it seemed that becoming the first batch of free labor was not a bad thing.

Xia ruofei gave a simple boost to everyone’s morale and brought Xia Qing around the area.

Originally, there was only one mobile house here, but now it had become a small village.

Thirty – one mobile temporary houses were arranged in five neat rows, with six mobile temporary houses in each row. The other mobile temporary house that Bao Guijun and the others were staying in occupied a row in the front.

This ‘small district’ of mobile temporary houses also had roads, drains, and so on. In addition, every mobile temporary house had a toilet, and the living facilities were basically in place.

Xia ruofei decided to wait for the new batch of people to come in before making further changes. For example, he could connect a water pipe from the big River in the distance so that the mobile house community could have running water.

As for electricity, it was a resource shortage in the realm for the time being. There was no day and night here, so electricity was indeed not a necessity for life.

Of course, as more and more people joined in the future, this problem would eventually have to be solved.

Xia ruofei encouraged Xia Qing with a few words, and then left the space with a thought.

He put the painting back into his body and immediately used his mental power to investigate. He didn’t find anyone peeking nearby, so he opened the door of the bathroom and walked out.

He had been in the spirit map space for more than ten hours. It was already around four in the morning the next day in the outside world.

Xia ruofei made something to fill his stomach, then lay on the bed to catch up on sleep.

After the baptism of the in – Flight meal’s unique taste, Xia ruofei had no interest in arulei’s local food at all. He did not even have the slightest confidence in the hotel’s restaurant.

Anyway, there were a lot of ingredients in the interspace, and there were also a lot of resources stored. Things like doujinshi were piled up like a mountain in the interspace.

Of course, those things were mainly prepared for Bao Guijun and the others. They could use their points to exchange for these living supplies from Xia Qing.

The time difference was not a problem for a cultivator. Xia ruofei could adjust to it easily and was not affected at all.

As long as he wanted to sleep, no matter what the environment was, whether he was sleepy or not, he could enter a deep sleep state in a very short time. This was also trained in the years of being a soldier.

Xia ruofei slept until two or three in the afternoon.

After he woke up, he went to the bathroom to wash his face. Then, he sat on the bed and used origin crystals to cultivate for a while. It was only after FiveO’ clock that he stood up in high spirits.

Xia ruofei took the elevator down and strolled around arulei for a while. With a backpack and a camera around his neck, he looked no different from an ordinary backpacker.

However, when he came out of a public toilet, he had changed his appearance.

Not only did he change his clothes and appearance, but he also put his camera and backpack into the interspace and replaced them with a satchel. In addition, he also made use of the disguise and investigation skills he learned in the Army to make his skin slightly darker. In addition, he deliberately controlled the adjustment of his muscles and bones, making him look like a completely different person.

Now, Xia ruofei did not have any Chinese characteristics on him. He looked more like someone from Southeast Asia.

He waved at a taxi and asked the driver to take him to the nearest used car shop. Without much effort, he successfully bought a used pickup truck. A new pickup truck like this cost about 10000 dollars and the car shop offered 7000 dollars. Xia ruofei did not even negotiate the price and bought it.

The car shop Naturally welcomed such a generous customer. Even when Xia ruofei asked not to go through the transfer procedures for the time being, the shop owner agreed to Xia ruofei’s request. Xia ruofei also knew that the car’s origin was not very clean, and the shop owner probably did not care what he took the car for.

This kind of situation was almost impossible in China. After all, if the car had a serious accident before the transfer, the original owner would have to bear the responsibility.

However, arulei’s side was clearly much more chaotic than China ‘s.

Xia ruofei didn’t spend much effort on the transportation problem. After he gave a 50 – dollar tip to the sales assistant, the assistant enthusiastically took him to buy a barrel of gasoline and loaded it in the back of the pickup truck.

Xia ruofei drove the pickup truck towards the outskirts of arulei.

His destination was the town of Basoko, which was about a hundred kilometers away.

The structure of the modr mercenary group was quite strict. It was impossible to wipe out the whole organization with only the confessions of Bao Guijun and the others. This was because Bao Guijun’s level was still too low, and it was impossible for him to come into contact with the higher – ups of the organization.

As the saying goes, a cunning rabbit has Three Burrows. It was impossible for all the higher – ups of the modr organization to stay in one place and wait for Xia ruofei to wipe them out.

This town of Basoko was the breakthrough point that Xia ruofei had found.
