Chapter 3453: The battle bet (1)

A huge wave of spiritual pressure hit him in the face. Xia ruofei suddenly felt his head buzzing. Fortunately, he was mentally prepared, so he was only slightly dazed. He quickly resisted it with his strong spiritual power.

At the same time, a powerful squeezing force and the invisible force that stirred the world Qi descended.

The two – hundredth step was indeed another obstacle. Whether it was the spiritual pressure or the external pressure, it was clearly much stronger than the one – hundred – and – ninety – ninth step. The extent of the increase was far greater than the previous steps.

Xia ruofei felt that the external pressure was more than a hundred times his weight.

It was as if he was bearing ten to twenty thousand Jin of pressure at any time, and it was coming from all directions at the same time. There was no place on his body that he could Dodge.

That invisible force was even more threatening. The moment Xia ruofei stepped onto the 200th step, the vital Qi in his body seemed to be boiling and shaking violently.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei was prepared. He started to circulate the “great Dao technique” immediately. After about two cycles, his vital Qi started to calm down.

As for the external pressure, with his Yuan Qi filling his entire body, even though it was already a little uncomfortable, it was not to the extent of being unable to withstand it.

Just like that, Xia ruofei quickly and steadily stood on the 200th step. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

In the hidden space enshrouded in purple mist, although immortal mountain river looked relaxed, he was actually clenching his fists.

When he saw Xia ruofei standing firmly on the 200th step, he couldn’t help but cheer in his heart. His eyes even revealed a smile.

“Congratulations! Brother mountain river!” Taoist master Qing Xuan was also very pleased.”You have accepted a good disciple!”

“Thank you, Daoist Qing Xuan!” Immortal mountain river cupped his hands and said,”Speaking of which, 1 haven’t taught him for even a day. I’m not worthy of being his teacher!”

“Brother mountain river is too modest!” Daoist Qing Xuan laughed and said,”who in the world doesn’t know about a treasure like the mountain and river spiritual map? You’ve even left such a treasure to him, as well as those cultivation resources, including some precious inheritances. Other than not personally teaching him, you’re more competent than most Masters!”

Immortal mountain river said with a smile,”actually, I also want to teach my disciples well.” However, the situation is already so bad … But this child really didn’t let me down. Whether it’s talent or perseverance, he’s a top choice! If there’s a chance, 1’11 definitely bring him by my side and teach him well for a period of time!”

Daoist Qing Xuan was silent for a moment before saying,””There will definitely be a chance! This child is indeed very talented. I believe that you master and disciple will be able to meet very soon!”

“Let’s borrow Daoist Qing Xuan’s auspicious words!” Daoist master mountain river said with a smile.

Taoist Qing Xuan laughed and said,””Brother mountain river, your disciple has successfully bought through this threshold! You should be more relaxed now, right? Why don’t we make a bet?”

“A bet?” “What do you want to bet on, Daoist Qing Xuan?” immortal mountain river asked curiously.

“Let’s bet on how many steps this child can reach!” Daoist priest Qing Xuan chuckled and said,”I’ve been coveting that green gourd of brother mountain river’s for a long time … How about it? Do you dare to take a bet?”

Hearing this, immortal mountain river couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows and said,””Daoist Qing Xuan, you have a big appetite! He actually has his eyes on my green gourd …”

“I’ll naturally take out something of equal value!” Daoist priest Qing Xuan laughed and said,”brother mountain and river are very familiar with my hidden treasures. Just tell me which one you like! As long as you can win, you can take it!”

“If I’m not mistaken, Daoist Qing Xuan should have a bottle of nascent formation pills …” Immortal mountain river said after a moment of silence.

Qing Xuan Daoist priest was stunned for a moment, but he quickly reacted and said with a smile,””It seems like brother mountain river really cares for this disciple of yours! He had just broken through to the mid – Stage of the Golden core realm! You’ve already started to prepare for him to form his nascent soul!”

Immortal mountain river smiled.”This child is practicing the ‘great way of Dao’. The quality of his Jindan is much stronger than that of ordinary cultivators, and his development potential is also very great. However, the disadvantage is that it is extremely difficult to break through the bottleneck when forming the Yuanying. Moreover, a little carelessness can put his life in danger. If 1 had a bottle of nascent formation pills, it would be much safer, and the success rate of forming a nascent soul would also be greatly improved.”

Daoist Qing Xuan pondered for a while and said,””No problem! Since brother mountain river has spoken, 1’11 give you this bottle of nascent formation pills, regardless of whether you win or not! Take it as my gift to this little kid!”

Hearing this, immortal mountain river waved his hand and said,””You don’t have to do that. Let’s have a normal bet. If Daoist Qing Xuan wins, 1 will naturally give you the green gourd with both hands. And if I’m lucky enough to win, you only need to give me a bottle of nascent formation pills!”

Qing Xuan shook his head with a smile and said,””The stakes are not equal, 1 can’t take advantage of this! Just do as I say! If brother mountain river wins, the nascent condensation pill will go to Xia ruofei. And if this poor Daoist is lucky enough to win… Give me Daoist brother’s Green gourd, and 1’11 give this nascent condensation pill to martial nephew as a meeting gift and give it to that little baby!”

Immortal mountain river couldn’t refuse and could only say,””Thank you very much, Daoist Qing Xuan..”
