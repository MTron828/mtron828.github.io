Chapter 440: Housewarming (1)

Lu You carefully walked into Tian Huilan’s office.

At this moment, Tian Huilan was standing in front of the floor – to – Ceiling window, looking out the window in deep thought.

“Mom!” Lu You carefully called out.”Mom!”

Tian Huilan came back to her senses and looked at Lu You with a complicated expression. She pointed to the guest sofa at the side and said,””Sit down!”

Lu You walked to the sofa and sat down. She was very nervous.

She knew very well that she had caused a big trouble this time. Her mother was quite angry, and she didn’t know what kind of anger and punishment she would face.

Tian Huilan walked back to the guest sofa and sat down next to Lu You. Then, she said,””Youyou, isn’t your mother being unreasonable?”

Lu You said uneasily,”mom, I didn ‘t!” I ... I shouldn’t have gone to such a dangerous place alone. Please don’t be angry with me ...”

“Can you tell me why you suddenly went to the bar to get drunk?” Tian Huilan waved her hand.

Lu You’s face turned slightly red. She didn’t know how to answer him.

Suddenly, she remembered what Xia ruofei had said and immediately understood. She looked upset and her eyes turned red. She lowered her head and said,””I ... I’m just very annoyed ... I want to go for a walk ...”

“Upset?” Tian Huilan frowned and said,”you’ve never been short of food and clothes since you were young. Your family’s conditions are better than most people ‘s. Moreover, whether it’s your grandfather or me, we’ve both doted on you like a baby. What else is there for you to be upset about?”

“I ...” Lu You looked like she wanted to say something but stopped.

Seeing this, Tian Huilan sighed and waved her hand.”Forget it, I can guess even if you don’t tell me. Is it because of the marriage with the song family?”

Lu You lowered her head and bit her lower lip. She didn’t say anything with tears in her eyes.

It wasn’t because she was good at acting. In fact, when Tian Huilan mentioned the marriage, she felt all kinds of grievances. She had been troubled by this for the past few days. She had even angered Xia ruofei the other day all because of this damn marriage.

Tian Huilan had seen Lu You’s expression. In addition to what Xia ruofei had said, she was even more certain of her judgment. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

She couldn’t help but feel a sense of fear. She didn’t expect her daughter to be so resistant. She didn’t have the courage to watch the surveillance video a second time. If Xia ruofei hadn’t appeared in the bar in time, she couldn’t imagine what kind of harm her daughter would have suffered. She felt like she would go crazy just thinking about it.

If he really caused that kind of damage, it would be useless even if he dismembered Fang Luo and the others into a thousand pieces.

At the thought of this, Tian Huilan was filled with gratitude towards Xia ruofei. At the same time, an alarm bell rang in her heart. She felt that she had really pushed Lu You too hard. If this continued, she really did not know what would happen.

“Youyou, you can tell me if you’re feeling anything,” Tian Huilan said. “How could you go to such a complicated place to drink alone?”

“Mom, I know I was wrong. Don’t be angry anymore. I won’t do it again ...” Lu You said with tears in her eyes.

Tian Huilan sighed.”I know you’re very resistant to this marriage ... Forget it. You’re still in college, so you should put your studies first. We’ll talk about it after you graduate!”

Lu You suddenly raised her head and asked in surprise,””Mom, really?”

“I said I won’t force you to interact with Xiao Rui, and you’re that happy?” Tian Huilan said dejectedly.

“No... I’m just ... Just ...” Lu You stuttered.

“Say no more. Since I’ve promised you, I won’t force you these few years.” Tian Huilan said,”but don’t be happy too soon. This marriage was decided by your aunt Wang’s family and I a long time ago. If we cancel it rashly, there will be too many implications. We can only do this for now.”

“I know ...” Lu You said.

This time, not only was she not punished, but she even got Tian Huilan’s promise that she would not force her to date song Rui while she was in college. This was already a great surprise to Lu You.

As for what would happen after graduation, there were still a few years to go! He would just talk about it when the time came.

Tian Huilan then repeatedly reminded Lu You that if song Rui asked her out, even if she rejected him, her attitude shouldn’t be too stiff. Lu You naturally agreed. Now that she knew song Rui’s position, she didn’t feel any pressure.

Following that, Tian Huilan naturally gave all sorts of instructions to Lu You, telling her not to do anything stupid in the future, especially in places like bars and nightclubs. She absolutely couldn’t set foot in them.

Lu You, who was in a good mood, naturally agreed.

As the Secretary of the municipal Committee, Tian Huilan’s schedule was very full. Naturally, she couldn’t talk to Lu You for too long, so she quickly let Lu You leave.

When Lu You walked out of the municipal Party Committee Office building, she still felt like she was in a dream.

When she’d come, she’d had the tragic image of a warrior who’d never return. She’d already mentally prepared herself to be severely reprimanded or even grounded by Tian Huilan. She didn’t expect the final result to be far beyond her expectations. Not only was there no punishment, but her attitude towards the marriage had also loosened. This was simply a huge surprise.

This was all thanks to the advice that Xia ruofei had given him before he left.

Hence, the moment Lu You came out, she couldn’t wait to call Xia ruofei.
