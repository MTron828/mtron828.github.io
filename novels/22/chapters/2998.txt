2999 A perfect ending (1)

Chen Xuan maintained his gentle smile and said,””Thank you very much, Valley master Liu.”

Liu Mansha looked at Xia ruofei’s outrageously young face. Perhaps it was because she thought of the two handwritten copies of the “the true understanding of glittering jewels”, but the trace of unhappiness in her heart quickly disappeared.

Liu Mansha smiled.”Fellow Daoist Chen is decisive in handling matters, and fellow Daoist Xia is also very bold. You two should be able to become good friends.”

Chen Xuan nodded his head in agreement and said,””Brother Xia and I hit it off quite well, and we feel like old friends at first sight. That’s right, although we haven’t found all five Saint tokens, since the fourth token has already appeared, I think the fifth token shouldn’t be far away. In the future, when the five Holy badges are United, it will definitely involve the exploration of the secret of the five Holy badges. I’ve already promised brother Xia that I’ll give him a spot!”

Liu Mansha’s beautiful eyes could not help but reveal a strange look. Even though they still did not know where the fifth token was, Chen Xuan had promised to give Xia ruofei a spot first. This was a huge favor.

In the future, when the five tokens were combined into one, the forces holding the token would definitely cooperate to explore this secret. At least, between the soaring Flower Valley, the surging waves sect, and the first heaven sect, none of them wanted to have any conflicts with each other, nor did they have absolute confidence in snatching the token from the other party. Thus, a win – win cooperation was an inevitable choice.

However, even so, each force would not have many slots. After all, with more people, things would easily go wrong.

According to Liu Mansha’s thoughts, it would be best if each token only allowed two to three people. She would bring along a capable assistant and a disciple who would be heavily nurtured. Any more than that would not be suitable.

She knew that the first heaven sect and the vast waves sect had similar thoughts.

This way, even if the first heaven society had two tokens, they would have about six spots. Obviously, each spot was very precious. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Chen Xuan had actually given Xia ruofei a spot just to borrow 110000 spiritual stones.

Liu Mansha could tell that something was different. At the very least, one thing was for sure. Chen Xuan had shown Xia ruofei enough kindness.

Compared to the star Seizer sect and the first heaven society’s strength and status in the cultivation world, this kind of kindness was naturally very precious to Xia ruofei. At least, that was what Liu Mansha thought.

She actually admired Xia ruofei, a young man, and was very happy for him.

Liu Mansha also knew that Chen Xuan was informing her in advance. Even though she still didn’t know where the fifth token was, cultivators had a much longer lifespan than ordinary people. There was still a high chance that they would be able to gather all five tokens one day in the future. Chen Xuan informing her so early was also a form of respect for Liu Mansha and soaring Flower Valley.

Even though Chen Xuan was the young sect master of the first heaven society, he still gave off the impression that he was refined and cultured.

Although he had broken through to the Golden core stage in his early forties, which was absolutely a shocking speed in the current cultivation world, he had never shown an overbearing appearance in front of others. Even in front of low – Level cultivators, his tone was very kind.

Young master Chen’s affinity was well – known in the cultivation world.

Liu Mansha had an idea and said with a smile,”Oh, really? Then I’ll congratulate fellow Daoist Xia in advance!”

“Thank you, Valley master Liu!” Xia ruofei also said with a smile.

Chen Xuan chuckled.”Please take your time. I’m going back to my private room. The auction isn’t over yet!”

Since Chen Xuan had come out to borrow spirit stones, there were naturally people in his room who would follow up with the auction. However, since he had already obtained the spirit stones, he had to return as soon as possible. With sufficient spirit stones, he could show his determination to buy the spirit stones.

“Since I’m already late, there’s nothing else for me to look for fellow Daoist Xia about. I’ll be heading back first!” Liu Mansha said with a smile.

Xia ruofei stood at the door of the room and smiled.””Alright, take care, you two!”

After seeing Liu Mansha and Chen Xuan off, Xia ruofei returned to the private room. He sat on the sofa and leaned back comfortably. After lending out the spirit stones, the auction for the day had ended. The last five Saints token had nothing to do with him.

Luo Qingfeng, who was sitting beside him, asked carefully,””Master, why don’t you think of a way to get the five Holy badges? This is an extremely rare treasure!”

Xia ruofei spread his hands and said,”I don’t have enough spiritual stones!” As you know, we only have a little more than 110000 spiritual stones. Look at the price now, it’s already over 130000 spiritual stones. I want to, but I don’t have the strength!”

“Actually, master, you can use other treasures to pay for the spirit stones,” Qingfeng Luo said in a low voice.”You can even promise to give me a number of Chi – amassing pills. They’ll definitely be more popular than spirit stones!”

Although a Qi gathering pill was not worth many spiritual stones, Xia ruofei could increase the price without limit. After all, the cost of making a Qi gathering pill was very low and the materials were mostly ordinary herbs. The most important resource was the spiritual Qi. Compared to the rich spiritual Qi in the spirit map, the little amount of spiritual Qi consumed to make a Qi gathering pill was not even a drop in the ocean.

So, in theory, Xia ruofei could raise the price without limit.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”why go through so much trouble?” If we lend out the spirit stones, the fire power will be dispersed, and we can still get interest, right?”
