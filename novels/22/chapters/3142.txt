3143 Heading to the capital (2)

“Boss!” Wu Qiang called out respectfully.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”Wu Qiang, ask sister – in – Law to prepare some of her signature dishes. Also, bring a box of Drunken Eight Immortals from my wine cellar to the backyard. I’m going to invite my friends to dinner tonight!”

“Yes!” Wu Qiang replied.

“Prepare the car. We should be using it tomorrow morning.” Xia ruofei said.

It was already afternoon when they set off from the three mountains. The sky was gradually darkening, so it would take at least the next morning for them to reach the Forbidden City.

Xia ruofei looked at the people present and said,””The car can’t fit all of them. Give brother Zhao a call and borrow two commercial cars and two drivers from the club. Drive over here tomorrow morning!”

“Yes!” Wu Qiang replied.

Zhao Yongjun was Wuqiang’s old leader. They usually kept in contact. Since Xia ruofei asked to borrow a car, Zhao Yongjun naturally wouldn’t say no.

“En, if there’s nothing else, you can go!” Xia ruofei said,”tell all the staff that they are not allowed to enter this courtyard without permission. I have something important to discuss with my friend!”

“Understood!” Wu Qiang said,”boss, I’ll go down first!”

Xia ruofei nodded slightly. Wu Qiang bowed to everyone and left the courtyard quietly. He even closed the door to the backyard.

Song Wei went to the side to make a call to her friends in the cultural relic restoration team of the Forbidden City’s Natural Museum. Xia ruofei personally led everyone to their rooms.

There were plenty of rooms here, so everyone picked a guest room each.

After that, Xia ruofei brought everyone to his master bedroom.

The room in the middle of the master bedroom and the room on the right were completely connected. It was basically an open space. Usually, it was very good to entertain friends here. It was not a problem to even have a small party.

Xia ruofei waited for everyone to take their seats before he took out some tea leaves from the medium and started to brew tea.

At this moment, Song Wei walked in with a phone in her hand. She smiled and said,””I’ve already contacted them. Tomorrow from 9 to 10 am, all the equipment will be for our use. Is there enough time?”

“That’s enough!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s just a small scan! You’ve worked hard, Wei Wei! Sit down and have some tea!”

As everyone sat around the coffee table, Chen Xuan placed the token on the table.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but pick up the token and look at the floating Points on it carefully, especially the floating Points with the repeated black dots. However, he couldn’t figure out anything even after racking his brain!

He also knew that it would not be easy to achieve any results in such a short period of time. Otherwise, the Masters of the ancient cultivation world would not be at a loss. The reason why the rising Dragon Token was an unsolved case in the ancient cultivation world was because it was difficult to solve.

“It seems like I can only place my hopes on the supercomputer,” Xia ruofei thought to himself.

On the Clearwater flying boat, Chen Xuan took out some high – quality tea leaves for everyone to enjoy. Although he had already given the last bit of wild tea he brought to Xia ruofei, the flying boat naturally did not lack good tea leaves.

“Brother Xia, the first heaven society doesn’t have a large business in the secular world, but we have an office in the capital. When we arrive in the capital today, let me settle the place for you!” Chen Xuan chuckled.

Hearing this, Song Wei smiled and said,”Brother Chen, the capital is ruofei’s territory. Of course, he’ll settle the accommodation!”

“Yeah!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”if not, wouldn’t that be a slap to my face?”

Mu Sheng laughed and said,”isn’t little brother Xia’s territory in the three mountains?” How did the capital become your territory?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’m sorry, sect leader mu. I don’t have much territory, but I have many friends in the capital. I’ve also bought some properties ... By the way, let’s stay at my house today!” I bought a courtyard house in liuhai Lane in the capital. It’s quite spacious. ” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Siheyuan?” Liu Mansha smiled and said,”is it an ancient building? This is quite to my liking!”

“It’s not particularly old. It’s a Qing Dynasty building with some renovations done at the back.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“That’s good!” “It’s a deal then. We’ll stay at brother Xia’s house today!” Chen Xuan said.

“Oh, right. Brother Xia,” Chen Xuan continued,”have you thought of who you can find to coordinate with the people in the Forbidden City?”

Before Xia ruofei could reply, Song Wei asked curiously,””RUO Fei, you’re going to the Forbidden City for business?”

“We want to borrow the high – definition scanning equipment from the Forbidden City’s Natural Museum,” Xia ruofei explained.”Song Rui or brother Zhao should be able to help us with this, right?”

Song Wei laughed and said,”why do you have to go so far?” You’re looking for my help!”

“You?” Xia ruofei could not help but turn to look at Song Wei. Then, he realized.

He patted his forehead with a bitter smile and said,””I’m really giving up what’s near and seeking what’s far! I almost forgot that you major in archeology. You must have been in contact with the relic restoration team of the Forbidden City’s Natural Museum, right?”

Song Wei smiled and nodded.

“Is it okay to borrow equipment from them?” Xia ruofei asked.

“What problem could there be?” Song Wei said,”just leave it to me! When we arrive in Beijing, I’ll make a few calls first. As long as they don’t have a lot of cultural relics that need to be scanned, then it’ll be fine!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said.

Then, he chuckled and said to Chen Xuan,””Brother Chen, look, the problem has been solved ...”

Chen Xuan was speechless. Xia ruofei had not even thought of who to ask for help. Whoever he caught was the one he was looking for!

However, this also showed that Xia ruofei did not think much of the equipment. Chen Xuan was relieved.

Although the speed of the Clearwater flying boat was not as fast as Xia ruofei’s Black flying boat, it only took about an hour to travel from the three mountains to the capital.

After chatting for a while, the airboat was already close to the sky above the capital.

The Clearwater flying boat hovered above a secluded alley near the siheyuan. Everyone jumped off the flying boat, and Chen Xuan kept it.

Everyone followed Xia ruofei and walked along the alley for a while before they arrived at the main entrance of Xia ruofei’s courtyard house.

Liu Mansha and Mu Sheng couldn’t help but sigh in admiration when they saw the spacious and bright door.

At their age, although they had not experienced the Qing Dynasty, most of their childhood living environments were buildings of this style. Furthermore, all of these cultivation sects had ancient buildings. Hence, when they saw this courtyard house, they naturally felt a sense of familiarity.

Xia ruofei used his fingerprint to unlock the door. Then, he turned around and said with a smile,”Everyone, please come in!”

Security guards were also living in the side rooms on the side of the main entrance. They were comrades recruited by Wu Qiang.

After hearing the sound, the veteran had already walked out of the penthouse and saw Xia ruofei walking in.

The veteran was so scared that he quickly stood at attention and shouted,””Mr. Xia, you’re back!”

...

Xia ruofei’s return was very sudden. He did not inform them to prepare a room or to pick him up.

However, under Wu Qiang’s leadership, the staff of the courtyard house had kept the place in order. Everyone had their own duties and did their best to complete their work, so they were not afraid of Xia ruofei’s sudden attack. The veteran just felt that it was a little sudden.

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile and said,”tell the kitchen to make more dishes. I’m inviting my friends to dinner.” Also ... Clean up the guest rooms in the middle courtyard. My friends are staying here today. ”

“Yes! Mr. Xia!” The veteran quickly said.

Xia ruofei continued to lead the group inside while introducing the siheyuan to them. Xia ruofei nodded with a smile and said,”tell the kitchen to make more dishes. I’m inviting my friends to dinner.” Also ... Clean up the guest rooms in the middle courtyard. My friends are staying here today. ”

“Yes! Mr. Xia!” The veteran quickly said.

Xia ruofei continued to lead the group inside while introducing the siheyuan to them.
