2532  A crazy suggestion (1)

    The next day, at the Espanyol club.

  In the office of the club's manager, Jiang Xiaochen.

  Jiang Xiaochen's eyes widened as he looked at the first team's head coach, Ruby, and asked,""What did you just say? Can you repeat that?" Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

  Ruby looked at the agitated Jiang Xiaochen and said calmly,""Mr. Jiang, you heard me right. I hope that the club will do its best to sign a professional contract with Mr. Xia ruofei before the winter window closes."

  "Coach Ruby, do you know who Mr. Xia ruofei is?" Jiang Xiaochen was so angry that he laughed.

  Ruby had clearly thought it through before he came, so he didn't hesitate and said directly,""Mr. Jiang, of course I know. Mr. Xia is one of the shareholders of our real Espanyol club ..."

  "Why are you making such an absurd request when you already know?" Jiang Xiaochen stared at Ruby and said,"do you think Mr. Xia will sign a professional player contract with the club? How much are you going to give him? How much do you think the annual salary is enough to move the boss of a company with a net worth of hundreds of millions of euros?"

  "Mr. Jiang, can you let me finish?" Ruby asked casually.

  "Alright, speak! You tell me!" Jiang Xiaochen sat on the chair and looked at Ruby speechlessly.

  Ruby cleared his throat and said,"Mr. Jiang, of course I know Mr. Xia's identity. I also know that a professional contract has almost no appeal to Mr. Xia ..."

  "It's not almost!" Jiang Xiaochen rudely interrupted Ruby and said,"not to mention our club, even if Barcelona and real Madrid were to throw out an olive branch, Mr. Xia would definitely not be moved! Do you know how popular Mr. Xia's company is in China? Do you know how much money he is making every second? Let him sign a professional contract with our club? This is crazy!"

  Ruby looked at Jiang Xiaochen quietly and only spoke after he finished,""Mr. Jiang, I know ... Mr. Xia selection criteria can't be that low, right?"

  At this point, Jiang Xiaochen immediately realized that he had misspoken and quickly said,""I'm not is from a rich family, and I also know that a small temple like the Spanish club can't accommodate a God like Mr. Xia. But! The winter transfer window is about to close, and our non - European Union players have not yet used up their spots. If we give this extra spot to Mr. Xia, then ... It may bring a completely different change to our club! After all, he's the major shareholder of our club, right? For the club's development, maybe he'll be willing to sign this professional contract?"

  Jiang Xiaochen looked into Ruby's eyes and asked,"What changes can there be? Good! Even if, as you said, Mr. Xia signed a professional player contract with our club and completed the registration with the Spain football Association, what does that mean? You can't be so naïve to think that Mr. Xia can stay in Spain all the time and step forward when the team needs him, can you? He can't even stay in Spain for a long time. What changes can he bring to the team?"

  "Of course I know that, Mr. Jiang," Ruby said. I don't expect Mr. Xia to be the team's regular player. It's just that in some key games to avoid relegation, if Mr. Xia can be a substitute for the team, I'll be very satisfied. I think ... There's still a possibility. "

  Jiang Xiaochen couldn't help but rub his forehead and asked helplessly,""Coach Ruby, why did you suddenly want Mr. Xia to become a club player? This ... This idea was too crazy! And I'm puzzled ... Didn't Mr. Xia just bump a few balls on the sidelines yesterday and then compete with Rocca for a fixed - point free kick? He had not taken any physical fitness tests or comprehensive football tests. He had not even participated in a training class. How could you be so sure of him? The LA Liga's selection criteria can't be that low, right?"

  At this point, Jiang Xiaochen immediately realized that he had misspoken and quickly said,""I'm not saying that Mr. Xia is not strong ... It's just that ... There's an old saying in China that there are specializations in the field. After all, Mr. Xia is a businessman and has never played professional football before. I think that in terms of football ability alone, he should still have a certain gap with professional football players."

  Ruby said seriously,"Mr. Jiang, I can say with responsibility that Mr. Xia's free kick alone is enough to make any La Liga team willing to sign him!" I carefully analyzed the video of Mr. Xia's free kick last night and found that his stability is really high. He kicked such a difficult elevator ball a total of nine times, and each time he made a perfect free kick, not to mention that. What's more rare is that these nine free kicks, the trajectory of the football, the arc, the position of the goal, and even the time of the football in the air, were almost exactly the same! One time can't explain the problem, but nine times is enough to explain the problem. I believe that even if Mr. Xia kicks the ball 10 more times, he can still steadily kick the ball in! Teacher Jiang, do you know what this means?"

  Ruby looked at Jiang Xiaochen with a fanatical expression. Before Jiang Xiaochen could reply, he said,""This means that as long as the team creates a free kick within 30 meters of the opponent's goal, there is a high probability of it being converted into a goal! If it was a crucial game, such a goal would mean three points! It's even related to the success or failure of staying in the league!"
