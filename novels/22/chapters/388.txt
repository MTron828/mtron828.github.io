Chapter 389: Chapter 357 – eating and taking (2)

Ever since Hong Tao and the others had arrived, the security of the farm had become even more formal. They each had their own duties, and there would be people on duty at the gate of the farm at any time, so now foreign cars could no longer drive in directly.

Xia ruofei was speechless. How impatient was this girl? How much time had passed? She was already at the entrance of the farm.

Although he had spent more than an hour refining the jaded skin ointment, that was in the original space. In the outside world, it had only been two to three minutes. Therefore, after calculating the time it took for him to come from the city, Lu You must have driven over directly after she had finished her call with him.

“Sure, pass the phone to the security guard!” Xia ruofei said with a bitter smile.

“Hello?” A steady voice came from the phone.

“I’m Xia ruofei. Who are you?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Brother Xia! I’m hu Zi!” The security guard Lei Hu on the other end of the phone immediately said.

“Oh, it’s Hu, let that girl in! She’s my friend, you can just ask her to drive the car directly to the villa. ” Xia ruofei said,”Oh right, tell the brothers that her car can enter directly in the future!”

“Understood!” Lei Hu said crisply.

Xia ruofei hung up the phone and set aside the half – finished ingredients in the kitchen.

He took off his apron and hung it up. As he walked out, he muttered to himself,””This girl really knows how to pick a time. She came at this time, could it be that she wants to eat with me again? You’re eating and taking, what a huge loss ...”

When Xia ruofei reached the entrance of the villa, he saw a red BMW MINI driving into the courtyard.

Xia ruofei had seen this car before. It was the car that Lu You usually drove.

In fact, Tian Huilan was very low – Key. Lu You was a college student, so it was a little ostentatious to drive a BMW MINI that cost more than 300000 Yuan. However, this car was a gift from Tian Huixin for Lu You’s 18th birthday, so Tian Huilan couldn’t really say much.

The MA family was a world – Class wealthy family. As the young mistress of the MA family, it was naturally nothing for Tian Huixin to give her niece a car.

After the car stopped, Lu You opened the door and stepped out.

Today, Lu You was wearing a short brown leather jacket, black slim – fit jeans, and Martin Boots. Her tall figure was brought out perfectly, and she looked cool. However, the gray wool hat on her head added a bit of youthfulness to her.

She took off her sunglasses and hung them on the V – neck of her knitted sweater. Then, she closed the door and walked towards Xia ruofei.

“You’re really fast!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Lu You’s face turned slightly red and she felt a little embarrassed. However, she still argued,””Didn’t you say you’d come in the afternoon? It’s already five past twelve, so it’s already afternoon ...”

“Alright! I’m speechless ...”Xia ruofei shrugged and said,” let’s go in!”

The two of them came to the living room of the villa. Lu You directly sat on the sofa. Her gaze landed on Xia ruofei but she did not say anything.

Xia ruofei understood and smiled. He turned around and walked into the kitchen. He opened the refrigerator and took out the three containers. Then, he went to the living room and placed the containers on the coffee table.

“Here, the face mask you wanted!” Xia ruofei said.

Lu You was originally crossing her legs, but when she heard this, she immediately put her legs down and sat up straight. She couldn’t wait to open a Tupperware.

She saw half a box of black jaded skin ointment and asked in surprise,””This ... Is the Jade Flower that sister Qingxue was talking about ...”

“It’s jaded skin cream!” Xia ruofei did not wait for her to finish and quickly corrected her,”it’s the real deal. This is the same as the one I gave Qingxue. Each can be used about five times. One use a day is enough.”

“Thank you!” Lu You quickly closed the preservation box and hugged the three boxes of Jade skin cream in her arms.

Xia ruofei looked at Lu You and said,””You’re welcome. Just don’t make me prescribe Chinese medicine to treat aunty pain in front of Qingxue again ...”

Lu You’s face couldn’t help but heat up. She also knew that what she had done the last time wasn’t very kind. After all, she was still a Virgin, and her aunt’s pain was cured by Xia ruofei. Now that she was talking about this topic, she was naturally a little shy.

“I know ...” Lu You lowered her gaze and said in a low voice,”haven’t you already cleared up the misunderstanding between you and sister Qingxue? Don’t take it to heart ...”

“I’m just afraid that you’ll trick me again in the future. ” Xia ruofei said in a bad mood.

“By the way, not all three boxes are for you!” He added.

Lu You immediately raised her head and said with a smile,””I know. Yueyue has a share too!”

Xia ruofei scratched his head awkwardly. However, that was indeed what he thought. Since he had given it to Lu You, he would not be able to hide it from Jiang Yue. If that little girl knew that he had prepared the jaded skin ointment for Lu You but had not considered her, she would be very sad! Therefore, it was better for those who saw it to get a share.

In any case, it was something that he could do easily.

Seeing that Xia ruofei did not say anything, Lu You looked at him with a faint smile and said,””It seems that you’re quite good to Yueyue! I always think of her when there’s good things ...”

Xia ruofei said unhappily,”isn’t it all your fault?” You didn’t bring her to the farm last time, so everything’s fine now, right?”

“Didn’t you agree to it yourself?” Lu You said immediately.

Xia ruofei was anxious.”How would I know? forget it. Let’s not talk about this!”

He felt that the two of them were about to quarrel again after a few words, so he stopped in time.

However, Xia ruofei felt that he and Lu You might have been enemies in their past lives. Anyway, they would start arguing after a few more words.

He calmed himself down and said,””These three portions of jaded skin cream, you and Jiang Yue will each take one. Help me pass the remaining portion to Secretary Tian!”

“Alright, I got it.” Lu You nodded and said.

If someone else had asked her to bring Tian Huilan a gift, she would have refused without even thinking. However, Xia ruofei was different. Xia ruofei had a close relationship with her family, and Lu You now understood Xia ruofei. She knew that Xia ruofei was not the kind of person who would suck up to the rich and powerful. He had given Tian Huilan a gift purely because of their friendship. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Lu You carefully placed the three small preservation boxes into her bag. Then, she leaned back comfortably on the sofa, picked up the remote control, and turned on the television.

Xia ruofei stood at the side with his eyes wide open.”Young miss Lu, you ...”

Lu You glanced at Xia ruofei and said,””I’m watching TV!”

“No... I’ve already given you this ...” Xia ruofei said tactfully.”Shouldn’t you ... Go home for dinner?”

Lu You raised her hand to look at her watch and said,””It’s already past 12 o’ clock. I’ll miss the meal time if I go back. I’ll just make do with your meal!”

After saying that, Lu You’s gaze returned to the television.

Xia ruofei stood at the side, speechless. He felt as if 10000 alpacas were galloping across his heart. Make do with it ... Make do with it your head ... This is the first time I’ve seen someone so reluctant to freeload a meal ...

Seeing that Xia ruofei did not move, Lu You looked up at him and asked,””What’s wrong? Was there not enough food? It’s fine, I don’t eat much, I can’t eat much ...”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He shook his head and said reluctantly,””Alright, then watch TV for a while. Lunch won’t be so soon ...”

“Yes, yes!” Lu You stared at the TV and nodded.

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and walked into the kitchen. He did not realize that Lu You’s eyes were on his back. The corners of her mouth slowly curled up into a beautiful arc, and a smile flashed across her eyes.

Xia ruofei started to get busy in the kitchen. He washed the rice, steamed the rice, grilled fish, stir – fried vegetables ... After more than half an hour, he started to serve the dishes to the dining room.

At this moment, Xia ruofei saw Lu You who was watching television in the living room. She was eating a bag of biscuits.

‘This girl really doesn’t treat me as an outsider ...’ Xia ruofei thought to himself.

Lu You also saw Xia ruofei. She waved the biscuit bag in her hand at Xia ruofei and said,””I’m a little hungry, can I eat a packet of your biscuits?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”eat more if you like. It’s okay.” But ... It seemed to be Lightning’s food! I just put it on the coffee table yesterday. ”

Lu You was stunned for a moment and said subconsciously,””Lightning?”

Then, she reacted.

“Ah ...”

Lu You shrieked and hurriedly threw the bag of biscuits in her hands on the coffee table ...
