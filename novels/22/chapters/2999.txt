3000 A perfect ending (2)

The ‘interest’ that Xia ruofei was talking about was naturally the quota that Chen Xuan had given.

Luo Qingfeng thought for a moment and said with a smile,””What master said makes sense. The purpose of competing for the token is nothing more than to explore the secret of the Legend of the Five sacred medallions. Since Chen Xuan has agreed to give master a spot, it will not affect master’s exploration of this secret.”

Xia ruofei smiled.”There’s one more thing. The star Seizer sect’s Foundation is still a little weak. Although this token won’t bring about any great disaster, it will do more harm than good.”

Luo Qingfeng was touched and said,””You’re so thoughtful, master,”

While the two of them were chatting, the auction was still ongoing.

However, they were now very relaxed and were completely in a state of watching a show.

In the end, with the addition of 110000 spirit stones, the first heaven sect won the five Saints badge without any suspense.

The final price was also jaw – dropping, reaching 190000 spirit stones.

This price had already far exceeded the expectations of Liu Mansha, Luo Feng, and the others. When they saw this price, they couldn’t help but smile bitterly and shake their heads. Even if there hadn’t been so many surprises, the spirit stones they had brought would not have been enough to compete for this token.

Liu Mansha and the others had still underestimated the attraction of the five sacred badges.

Of course, there were some unexpected factors that caused the price to rise so high.

This unexpected factor was the Black Dragon cult.

This time, the Black Dragon cult had prepared more than expected. The spiritual stones they had brought were far more than Liu Mansha had expected.

The second half of the auction was basically a competition between the first heaven society and the Black Dragon cult.

When the price reached 180000 spiritual stones, the Black Dragon cult was still insistent.

This number had basically reached the limit of the first heaven sect.

If Chen Xuan had not borrowed 110000 spiritual stones from Xia ruofei, they might not have been able to compete with the Black Dragon cult.

However, with the large sum of spiritual stones from Xia ruofei, the first heaven society was full of confidence. They had almost 300000 spiritual stones.

As such, just as Chen Xuan’s bid broke through 180000 spiritual stones, he immediately placed a bid of 190000 spiritual stones.

The Black Dragon cult, which had been following the bidding closely, probably ran out of spiritual stones and fell silent.

Thus, Chen Xuan obtained the five sages token as he wished. This was also the second five sages token that the first heaven sect had.

In fact, the first heaven society only carried around this number of spiritual stones. They would have a little less, but not by much. Therefore, the spiritual stones they borrowed from Xia ruofei were not used up by much. At most, they were only a fraction of the total.

However, without Xia ruofei’s spiritual stones, the first heaven society would have lost.

This way, the Black Dragon cult would obtain a five Saints token, which would add a lot of variables to the future.

Hence, even though he did not use many spiritual stones, Xia ruofei’s act of borrowing spiritual stones was a timely help and Chen Xuan had to accept it.

In room 20, Xia ruofei saw that the auction had ended and couldn’t help but smile.””Today’s auction is really exciting!”

It was Xia ruofei’s first time interacting with people from the cultivation world. Everything was new to him.

Of course, the auction this time was full of ups and downs. Qingfeng Luo had participated in many auctions, and he had to admit that this auction was indeed more exciting than the previous ones.

“Yes!” Qingfeng Luo nodded and said,”it’s because the master attended the auction that there are so many interesting stories!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you’re flattering me!” My cultivation level is nothing in front of those sect big shots. What stirred up the auction was actually the last auction, and we have nothing to do with it. I still have this self – awareness. ”

Luo Qingfeng smiled and said,”master, you’re being too humble. You’re even underestimating yourself!” If those sect leaders and elders knew your true cultivation level, their jaws would definitely drop!”

At this time, on the main auction stage, Hao Qingsong also secretly heaved a sigh of relief. Although there had been some interludes, on the whole, the auction had been completed smoothly. As the host of the auction, Hao Qingsong’s heart had been in his mouth the entire time.

This was especially so for Xia ruofei’s side, where unexpected situations occurred one after another, catching Hao Qingsong off guard. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

He said,”thank you, fellow Daoists!” The auction had come to a successful end! We’ve prepared a banquet to welcome fellow Daoists to join us!”

The banquet after the auction was basically a reserved program. It was mainly to provide a platform for cultivators to communicate face – to – Face. Sometimes, the banquet after the auction would also facilitate private transactions between cultivators.

After all, some treasures were not easily priced with spirit stones, and cultivators exchanged for what they needed. This was the mainstream method of private transactions.

Of course, not everyone was keen to participate in such an exchange.

For example, Chen Xuan of the first heaven society had directly raised his voice the moment Hao Qingsong’s words fell.”Many thanks for fellow Daoist Hao’s kind invitation, but we still have some urgent matters to deal with in our sect, so we’ll be taking our leave first.”

Then, some cultivators who didn’t like to join in the fun also said their goodbyes.
