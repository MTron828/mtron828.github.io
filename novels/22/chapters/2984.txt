2985 The pair of phoenixes (1)

This pair of storage rings was listed in the auction booklet, and everyone knew that the handwritten copy of the “glittering jewel true understanding” remnant from the lingjue mountain would no longer appear. So unless there was another item that cut the queue, it was time for them to appear.

All the cultivators who were interested in the two storage rings sat up straight, including Xia ruofei, who had been thinking of buying them for Ling Qingxue and Song Wei.

Xia ruofei took one last look at the first volume of the glittering jewel Wonderland, the ink still wet, and threw it on the coffee table.

Luo Qingfeng could not help but look at the manuscript, his eyes full of anticipation.

Xia ruofei turned to look at Luo Qingfeng and said,””After Shao Qingyang has finished reading it, you can keep this cultivation technique! I’ll find some time to write out the contents of Volume two and three for you. ”

Hearing this, Luo Qingfeng could not help but be surprised and happy. At the same time, he was also a little puzzled. He could not help but ask,””Master, the third volume?”

“The third volume can also be practiced by golden core cultivators. For golden core cultivators, after mastering the contents of the third volume, the speed of their spiritual power cultivation will be at least 20% faster than those who only learned the first two volumes!” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

Luo Qingfeng was overjoyed and quickly said,””Thank you, master! Thank you, master!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”you’re welcome. You’ve helped me with many things. It’s only right that I provide you with some resources.” Right, you can choose some disciples in the star Seizer sect to teach the contents of the first volume, but the prerequisite is that the disciples must be absolutely reliable!”

In this auction, the star Seizer sect had been in the limelight. As the saying goes,”the rafter that sticks out rots first.” It was not necessarily a good thing for the star Seizer sect to attract so much attention, especially when their own strength was still far from the level of a top sect. Hence, Xia ruofei had long made up his mind to help the star Seizer sect improve its strength. Whether it was its hard or soft power, it had to be improved accordingly.

From the perspective of a high – Level cultivator, Xia ruofei was at least comparable to a cultivator in the intermediate stage of the Golden core realm. Even if he were to face a cultivator in the advanced stage of the Golden core realm, Xia ruofei, who had a variety of means, might not be unable to fight. On the other hand, Qingfeng Luo was only at the early – Stage golden core realm. If he invested some cultivation resources, he still had a high chance of reaching the mid – Stage golden core realm. This kind of high – Level combat power was already considered top – notch among the first – Class sects. Compared to the top sects that had four to six Aurous core stage cultivators at the helm, it was naturally still a little worse.

There was also the work of laying the foundation. Xia ruofei had asked Luo Qingfeng to choose loyal and reliable disciples to teach the glittering jewel truth to in order to improve the overall Foundation of the star Seizer sect.

The importance of mental power in cultivation was self – evident. Take Xia ruofei as an example. Even though he did not specifically cultivate mental power techniques, the great Dao Arts itself was a technique that cultivated mental power, true Qi, or primordial Qi at the same time. His mental power cultivation had always been at the forefront, which had also brought great benefits to his cultivation. Some bottlenecks were easily solved.

If the core members of the star Seizer sect were able to receive a huge boost in their spiritual power, then their cultivation bases would also experience rapid growth in the near future.

Of course, Xia ruofei also had some ideas to improve his hardware, but he did not plan to discuss it with Luo Qingfeng for the time being.

All in all, he had been nurturing the star Seizer sect as an important force in his own power.

If Xia ruofei’s group of people could be considered a sect, then the star Seizer sect could be considered a subsidiary or peripheral force of the sect.

When Luo Qingfeng heard that the glittering jewel Wonderland could be passed on to his disciples, he was naturally moved to tears. He quickly said,””Don’t worry, master! This old servant will definitely be strict ... Uh ... This old servant has a presumptuous request ...”

“Go ahead,” Xia ruofei said with a kind smile.

“Before I choose a disciple to teach the” true understanding of the glittering jewel array,”I would like to ask you to check on me again.” Luo Qingfeng said carefully,”this is the only way to ensure that such a precious cultivation technique will not be passed on to the wrong person ...”

Luo Qingfeng was well aware of the power of Xia ruofei’s hypnotism technique. This cultivation technique had been given to the star Seizer sect by Xia ruofei, and its value could be seen from the auction price today. Thus, he did not want the cultivation technique to be leaked because of his misjudgment.

Asking Xia ruofei to personally guard one of the obstacles was naturally a safe and wise choice.

“Sure,” Xia ruofei replied indifferently. However, if I’m in the Peach Blossom Island, you’ll have to run there to find me. ”

“No problem!” Luo Qingfeng quickly replied. If the disciples he brought could pass the master’s test, their reliability would naturally not be a problem. If this disciple has any disloyal thoughts, this old servant will directly clean up the sect on the Peach Blossom Island, and there is no need to worry about the secret of the Peach Blossom Island being leaked. ”

Luo Qingfeng’s words were filled with killing intent. Xia ruofei chuckled and said,””We’ll talk about it later! Actually the “glittering jewel truth” isn’t a particularly precious cultivation method, but since it was sold to the flying flower Valley at a high price, if we don’t keep it a secret and let this cultivation method go to waste, that would be a bit unkind. So we still have to keep it a secret, including the fallen leaf sect, I also have a request. ”

“Yes! Master!” Luo Qingfeng said with a slight bow.

At this moment, Hao Qingsong, who was on the main auction stage, had already started to introduce the pair of storage rings. Xia ruofei’s attention was also diverted to that side, and he no longer discussed the issue of the ‘truth of the glittering jewel’ with Luo Qingfeng. Luo Qingfeng also sensibly sat down quietly at the side, not daring to disturb Xia ruofei.
