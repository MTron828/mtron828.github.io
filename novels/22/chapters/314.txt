Chapter 315: Art – like vegetables (1)

“Taoyuan vegetables are actually supplied by your farm!” Liang Weimin said in shock. Liang Qichao also called out,”ruofei, you’re really good at keeping secrets!” We’ve known each other for so long, and I’ve even been to your farm a few times, but you never told me that you’re actually growing Taoyuan vegetables in your greenhouse!” Xia ruofei chuckled.”It’s not a big deal. It’s just a little better – looking than normal vegetables, tastes better, and is a little more expensive.” “It’s more than just a little expensive!” Liang Qichao said resentfully,”it’s been fine recently, but the price was sky – High a while ago, okay? If I had known that you were growing Taoyuan vegetables, I would have gone home to show my filial piety to my parents!” “It’s not too late to know now!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”if uncle and aunty want to eat Taoyuan vegetables in the future, feel free to come to my farm and get them!” “Ruofei, I won’t be polite then!” Liang Weimin chuckled and said,”it’s fine that Taoyuan vegetables are expensive, but the main thing is that there’s too little of them. You can’t eat them even if you have money!” Elder Tang’s interest was piqued after hearing this. He had always been a glutton, and he had never had any resistance to good food. Moreover, he was a world – Class rich man and had basically tasted all the top food. Now, when he heard Liang Weimin and the others speak so highly of paradise vegetables, and even Liang Weihua was shocked when he heard that Xia ruofei was the supplier of paradise vegetables, the old man’s appetite was also hooked. “Brother Xia, it’s a deal! We’ll go to your farm for a meal at noon!” Said elder Tang. “We welcome you!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. The group walked towards the door. Liang Weihua’s mood was a little low, and he said directly,””Uncle, I’m not feeling well, so I won’t be able to accompany you for lunch ...” Elder Tang chuckled and nodded. He didn’t seem to be unhappy with Liang Weihua’s behavior today. However, Liang Weihua was clear that the old man had long cultivated to the realm where he could not show his emotions. Today’s incident would more or less leave a bad impression on the old man. Thinking about this, Liang Weihua’s hatred for Xia ruofei grew even stronger. Liang Weihua’s family of three bade their farewells and left. The other relatives of the Liang family also tactfully bade their farewells. If they were at the XI Jiang Yue clubhouse, they would definitely not let go of the opportunity to be in close contact with the old man and would definitely go with him. However, now that Xia ruofei had invited old master Liang, no matter how thick – skinned they were, they were too embarrassed to go and join in the fun. Liang Qichao was also forced to stay behind to arrange for the transportation of the Phoebe zhennan materials, so only Liang Weihua and Yuan Shan were left to accompany elder Tang. Xia ruofei led the way in the pickup truck while Liang Weimin drove the Mercedes – Benz. Elder Tang and Yuan Shan were in the car while elder Tang’s assistant and two bodyguards drove another car and followed behind. Soon, the three cars arrived at Taoyuan farm. Xia ruofei stopped the car at the shed. Elder Tang and the others got out of the car. The old man looked at the beautifully planned farm and couldn’t help but exclaim in admiration. He took a deep breath of fresh air and said,””Brother Xia, this place of yours really lives up to its name. It’s like a paradise!” “Old master, you’re too kind!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”these greenhouses are growing all – Natural and pollution – Free Peach Garden vegetables.” Xia ruofei then invited elder Tang to take a look. Elder Tang naturally agreed. Liang Weimin and his wife were very curious about the vegetable farm in paradise and followed closely. Xia ruofei led the group into the vegetable greenhouse. Cao tieshu and the workers were not in this shed. There were several long sheds like this in Tao Yuan farm, and now Cao tieshu was busy with the workers in other sheds. Hence, Xia ruofei personally explained to elder Tang. In reality, elder Tang had been mesmerized the moment he stepped into the greenhouse by the rows of fresh and green vegetables. The greenhouse was filled with cabbages and had just been automatically watered. The cabbages ‘green leaves were all covered in droplets of water, just like a Jade plate holding a clear pearl. It was a pleasing sight to the eye. “Brother Xia, I’m getting more and more interested in your paradise vegetables!” Elder Tang said,”these cabbages are like a piece of art. It’s hard to imagine how they’ll look when they’re served on the table ...” Xia ruofei smiled.”Today, I’ll cook a table full of dishes for the old man and uncle and Auntie. How about using all the ingredients from our Taoyuan farm?” “I’m really looking forward to that!” Old master Tang laughed. “Old man, this way please!” Xia ruofei brought elder Tang on a tour of the farm before heading straight to the villa. Ye Lingyun had already finished his lunch and brought little black out for a patrol. Xia ruofei brought the few of them into the empty villa. As soon as they entered the living room, elder Tang and the others were immediately attracted by the pair of Blood Dragons. “This Red Arowana is too perfect!” Liang Weimin couldn’t help but ask,”ruofei, where did you find such a high – Quality Blood Red Dragon? And they were actually a pair! It’s unbelievable. ” “I’m lucky. A friend of mine is about to emigrate, so he gave me the red Arowana ...”Xia ruofei smiled. After that, Xia ruofei made tea for the three of them and asked them to help themselves. He then went into the kitchen to prepare lunch. Xia ruofei had stored some vegetables and fruits in his interspace. These were all produced inside the interspace and were of better quality than the vegetables in the greenhouse outside. After Xia ruofei entered the kitchen, he immediately contacted the interspace with his mind and took out a large pile of ingredients. Other than vegetables and fruits, Xia ruofei also used the invisible force of space to take out two big fish. Then, he started to get busy in the kitchen. Including elder Tang’s assistant and bodyguards, there were a total of seven people eating today. Xia ruofei had prepared seven or eight dishes, mainly Taoyuan vegetables, fish head tofu soup, and braised carp. After a while, Xia ruofei started to serve the dishes one by one. There was stir – fried cabbage that looked like jade, tomato salad that exuded the fragrance of melon and fruit, and milky white fish head tofu soup ... Each dish could make people have a strong appetite just by looking at it, not to mention the waves of alluring fragrance. Soon, elder Tang and the others couldn’t help but walk into the dining room. Xia ruofei returned to the kitchen and brought out the main dish. Other than the rice, he also prepared a large plate of dumplings stuffed with pork and cabbage. The cabbage was naturally produced in the realm. Xia ruofei saw that there were noodles in the fridge that ye Lingyun had woken up, so he made dumplings on the spur of the moment. In the kitchen, he also took out a few bottles of wine from the medium. These were also the ones he had gotten from the medium last time and stored in porcelain bottles in case of emergency. However, these few bottles of wine were just ordinary Drunken Eight Immortals without any added petals. Of course, after being stored in the spatial space for so long, these bottles of wine were much more mellow than the ones he had given to Ling Xiaotian previously. They were definitely top quality wine. Xia ruofei carried the dumplings and the Drunken Eight Immortals wine out of the kitchen on a tray and went straight to the dining room. “Old man, uncle, aunty, please sit down!” He said with a smile.
