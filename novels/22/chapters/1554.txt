“The price will naturally be higher than before!”

“We all know the rules!”

“President Yu, don’t say anything else. Forty – two million! I’m taking this piece of material!”

” 43 million!”

” 45 million!”

Yu mingdong didn’t need to say anything more. These experienced Jade merchants took the initiative to start bidding.

Yu mingdong still looked at the piece of material with some reluctance, but his peers had already started bidding. If he changed his mind, he would undoubtedly become the target of public criticism.

If this piece of material was cut out according to everyone’s prediction, it would be worth at least 60 to 70 million Yuan. However, Yu mingdong was a little superstitious about Xia ruofei’s luck today. Since Xia ruofei felt that it was not good, he would not be entangled with it anymore.

Fatty Luo couldn’t help but join the competition. For a businessman, what was face? Everything was based on profit.

” 48 million!” Fatty Luo raised the bid by three million in one go, looking as if he was determined to win.

“Old Luo, you’re such a Big Boss, so don’t fight with us!” Someone said unhappily.

Fatty Luo said with a smile,”fair competition!” Everyone here is much richer than me, so don’t flatter me to death!”

“Hmph, then 49 million it is!” The person who had just spoken couldn’t help but add a million.

Fatty Luo’s luck wasn’t very good today, and he hadn’t managed to get a few good pieces of jade. His demand for raw jade was also very high, so he was very envious of this piece of Jade.

“Forty – nine million five hundred thousand!” Fatty Luo shouted through gritted teeth.

“I’ll round it up to 50 million!” Someone else shouted,”director Yu, and everyone else in the industry, don’t forget that this is still a half – baked material. This price should be about right ... Everyone, please be magnanimous. Our factory is also waiting for the rice to be cooked!”

“Chief Xue, everyone’s lacking good raw materials these days!” Fatty Luo said. 51 million! I’ll just take it as making friends with President Yu!”

This price was already very high. After all, there was still a risk in semi – Bright materials. Once the bet failed, the value might shrink rapidly.

The Jade merchants began to hesitate because they could see fatty Luo’s determination. If they continued to raise the price, they might not be able to buy this piece of Jade. Instead, it would benefit Yu mingdong for no reason, and at the same time, it would make fatty Luo hostile.

Therefore, the bidding momentum suddenly stopped.

However, there were still people who didn’t give up and continued to add tens of thousands, but fatty Luo had his eyes on this piece of material, and in the end, he successfully won it for a price of 53 million.

“Old Yu!” Fatty Luo rubbed his hands gleefully and said,”I’ll transfer the money to you now! Thank you for giving away your love!”

Yu mingdong nodded slightly and said,”we’re just helping each other!” I still have to thank you for taking care of my business!”

The small unhappiness from before seemed to have disappeared as they closed the business.

Fatty Luo eagerly looked for the organizer’s staff and signed the transfer agreement under their witness. After all, he did not have any personal relationship with Yu mingdong. They could not trust each other like Xia ruofei and Yu mingdong, so he was more cautious.

Fatty Luo then readily transferred 53 million Chinese dollars to Yu mingdong’s account and successfully completed the transaction.

Xia ruofei watched coldly from the side. He had personally seen fatty Luo “defeat all the heroes” and finally win this raw stone that he had thought was a hot potato.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but sigh. This really confirmed the saying that “enemies don’t meet”!
