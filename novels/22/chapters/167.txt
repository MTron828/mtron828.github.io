Chapter 168: Chapter 165 – unusually hot

Even though some people had guessed this before, when they really saw the truffles on the stage, it was still a very shocking visual impact. There were a total of 12 truffles, seven of which were white truffles, each of which was no smaller than the one that everyone had just shared. The remaining five black truffles were not much smaller than the White truffle. If the organizer of the auction was a traditional truffle dealer like the Grao family, perhaps everyone would be less surprised. However, Xia ruofei was just an unknown young man, and the Paradise Corporation was even more so a small, unknown company. It was really unbelievable that they could produce so many huge truffles at once. Moreover, many people had noticed that in the middle of the display stage, there were five sealed containers covered under the red silk, not directly seen to everyone. This also made people’s imagination run wild. The truffles displayed in front of everyone were already big enough, could the remaining pieces be even bigger? According to normal thinking, this was definitely the case. Good stuff sank to the bottom! However, everyone felt that this was too shocking. For a time, the sound of discussion was endless. Everyone’s anticipation for this auction was getting stronger and stronger. Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ll start with the auction of these 12 truffles.” I can guarantee that all the White truffles come from the same place, and the black truffles are of the highest quality!” With that, Xia ruofei gestured to the side, and a professional auctioneer strolled onto the stage. There were specializations in every field, and professional things should be left to the professionals. Xia ruofei walked down the stage and sat beside MA Xiong. “Xia Sheng, the effect is very good!” MA Xiong laughed and gave him a thumbs up.”To be able to come up with such a complete marketing plan in just a few hours, xiasheng is really good at business!” Xia ruofei smiled humbly and said,””It’s all thanks to Mr. Ma’s rich resources. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be able to realize my ideas no matter how much I wanted to!” As the two of them chatted, the auction, which had attracted a lot of attention from the beginning, finally officially began. The first item up for auction was the 5 pieces of black truffles. The auctioneer picked up a piece and placed it on the electronic scale. Then, he smiled and said,””Ladies and gentlemen, the next Black truffle is 356 grams. The starting price is 300 dollars, and each increment must not be less than 50 dollars. Please place your bids!” The price of black truffle was generally lower than that of white truffle. It was one – fifth or even one – tenth of the price of white truffle. The price of an authentic France black truffle was about 500 US dollars per kilogram. However, Xia ruofei’s Black truffle weighed more than 300 grams and was of high quality. Hence, the starting price was not considered expensive. Of course, compared to the truffles that would be auctioned later, this was only an appetizer. Perhaps the tasting session was too exciting, but in fact, when everyone was sharing the White truffle, the price was more than 300 dollars in a high – Class Western restaurant, so everyone’s enthusiasm for bidding was quite high. In the end, the black truffle was sold for 800 dollars, which was far more than the market price of black truffle, and it was a good start to the press conference. The next four truffles gradually increased in weight. The heaviest truffle reached 538 grams and was sold for more than 1000 dollars each. The black truffle that was more than 500 grams reached 1500 dollars. The five pieces of black truffles brought Xia ruofei nearly 6000 dollars in income. Of course, this amount of money was nothing to Xia ruofei. What he valued more was the enthusiasm of everyone. Seeing the black truffle’s popularity, Xia ruofei’s heart was completely at ease. Next up was the auction of the White truffle. There were a total of eight pieces of white truffle. The lightest piece had already been shared with everyone for free in the previous segment, and the remaining seven pieces were all over 512 grams. The first piece of white truffle, which weighed 520 grams, was auctioned first. “Ladies and gentlemen, next up is the exciting white truffle auction!” The auctioneer said in a very infectious and exaggerated tone,”I believe that everyone has already tasted the incomparable taste of white gold just now. Just now, I was also very honored to have a share in the audience. It was really an unforgettable experience! This is the first time I’ve ever hated my job so much. If I wasn’t the auctioneer today, I would be able to sit in the audience and participate in the bidding like everyone else. In order to taste the wonderful white truffle again, I’m willing to give up everything!” The auctioneer’s exaggerated expression caused the guests to laugh out of goodwill. At this time, the auctioneer’s face turned serious and said,””Okay, let’s get back to business. This 520 grams of white truffle has a starting price of 5000 dollars, and each bid must be no less than 300 dollars! Please place your bids!” ” 5500 dollars!” ” 5800 dollars!” ” 6188 dollars!” Perhaps it was because they had just tasted the same white truffle, but everyone’s bids were much more enthusiastic than before. The competition for the first piece of white truffle was extremely intense, and the price quickly reached 8000 dollars. After 8000 dollars, the bidding momentum began to slow down a little, but it was still increasing bit by bit. Of course, MA Xiong and the other super – rich people didn’t touch the truffles. Their target was the bigger truffles under the red silk. In the end, the first piece of white truffle was sold for 9600 US dollars. It was won by the boss of a restaurant chain from the capital. The following six pieces of white truffles were auctioned off. Everyone was bidding enthusiastically, and the final price did not disappoint Xia ruofei. Each piece was more than 10000 US dollars. Especially the last piece of 878 grams of white truffle, which was sold for 50000 USD. It was far beyond Xia ruofei’s expectations. The explosive scene was also beyond Xia ruofei’s expectations. The seven pieces of white truffles brought Xia ruofei a total income of 130000 US dollars. On the stage, the auctioneer smiled.”Thank you for your enthusiasm. The auction for the first batch of truffles has ended. Next, let’s welcome the CEO of the Paradise Corporation, Mr. Xia ruofei!” A round of applause immediately broke out in the auction hall. The auction of the first batch of truffles had completely stirred up everyone’s enthusiasm, and everyone was full of anticipation for the next truffles. Xia ruofei walked on stage with a smile and took the microphone.””We’ll be auctioning four truffles for the second batch. I’m sure you won’t be disappointed!” Xia ruofei didn’t say much and directly walked to the long display stand. Other than the largest sealed container in the middle, Xia ruofei had removed the red silk cloth covering the other four containers ...Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m
