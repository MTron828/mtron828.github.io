Chapter 1063: The mysterious buyer (1)

Translator: 549690339

Li Kai had always given the outside world the impression of a gentle and elegant young master, but this kind of elegance had a trace of unruliness and forthright.

Of course, he had the capital to do so.

Today’s incident was a typical Li Kai’s style.

It was almost an open secret that he did not get along with Zheng zhilun. Almost everyone in the industry knew about this.

In the bidding just now, Zheng zhilun had clearly been played by Li Kai. Li Kai might not have wanted to buy the abalone at all, but he had deliberately raised the price with Zheng zhilun, raising the price of the king of abalones to a staggering 8.5 million Hong Kong dollars.

He Xinyi was stunned for a moment, then she immediately pursed her lips and smiled.

In comparison, this young master Li had really been merciful to her!

He Xinyi could not help but want to laugh when she saw Zheng zhilun’s expression, as if he had just eaten a fly.

Zheng zhilun was indeed on the verge of going berserk. He could have bought the abalone for six to seven million, but Li Kai had forced him to bid 8.5 million.

Having been tricked by Li Kai in front of so many people, Zheng zhilun was really embarrassed today.

He took a few deep breaths to calm himself down.

No matter what, at least he had gotten the abalone. It was just an extra two million, nothing much!

Zheng zhilun snorted coldly and looked at Lu zhongguang, who was a little distracted on the stage. He said unhappily,””Mr. Lu, shouldn’t we start the countdown?”

Lu zhongguang came back to his senses and quickly showed an apologetic smile.

For an experienced auctioneer like him, being distracted during the auction was a low – Level mistake.

It was just that the drama that Li Kai and Zheng zhilun had put on together was too exciting and intense. Even Lu zhongguang could not help but be a little “immersed” in his character.

“The highest price is 8.5 million Hong Kong dollars offered by Mr. Zheng from Xinyu group. Are there any higher offers?” he quickly said.

Everyone laughed. How could there be a higher price?

Even Li Kai had stopped playing, and the others had long since withdrawn from the competition. Moreover, with the price being raised to such a sky – High price, who would still follow up?

Everyone felt that the final owner of this abalone was already set in stone, even though Zheng zhilun won without showing his face.

Of course, Lu zhongguang was just going through the procedure.

“8.5 million Hong Kong dollars going once!” He quickly said. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“8.5 million Hong Kong dollars going twice!”

“8.5 million ports ...”

Lu zhongguang had already raised the auction mallet, ready to end the last shocking auction.

However, the hand that was holding the auction hammer stopped moving. A look of disbelief appeared in his eyes, and even his words were a little incoherent.”8..7 million Hong Kong dollars!”

Although Zheng zhilun was a little unhappy at first, he felt that the overall situation had already been set. It was a little expensive, but he could only wait to pay and receive the goods.

He didn’t expect a higher price to be offered.

Zheng zhilun’s first reaction was to turn his head and glare at Li Kai. He did not expect Li Kai to be dumbfounded as well, looking in one direction in surprise.

Zheng zhilun followed Li Kai’s gaze and realized that the bid of 8.7 million Hong Kong dollars was not made by anyone in the auction. Instead, it was made by the person with ID 06, one of the 15 long – distance online buyers.

The buyer was the one who had raised the price to 5 million Hong Kong dollars at the start of the auction.

Later on, when Li Kai and Zheng zhilun were at loggerheads and the two of them were rapidly increasing the price, this buyer number 06 had given up, as if he had quit the competition.

He did not expect that when Zheng zhilun thought that the dust had settled, this person would actually interfere.

The other guests in the venue also felt that their mood was like a roller coaster. They thought that today’s good show was over, but they didn’t expect another wave of excitement to come immediately.

The most excited people were the media.

The reporters were already excited from the beginning of the warm – up. This was a high – Quality, extra – large two – headed abalone worth one to two million Hong Kong dollars! They directly cooked two on the spot, this paradise Corporation was really generous!

The following auctions also came in wave after wave, with almost no low points. The prices also kept rising, and the media reporters who were watching were all excited.

And the last wave of bidding competition made people’s blood vessels even more excited.

Zheng zhilun could not help but curse in his heart when he saw the price of 8.7 million Hong Kong dollars on the big screen.

Today was really a bad day!

Everyone’s eyes were focused on Zheng zhilun. Zheng zhilun felt as if there was a dagger on his back, as if he was being roasted on a fire.

It wasn’t that he was short of money, but if his second uncle knew that he had spent so much money on an abalone, he would inevitably have a bad impression of him and think that he was a prodigal.

But if he backed down just like that, he, young master Zheng, would lose all face today.

It was already embarrassing enough to be tricked by Li Kai. If they still couldn’t get the abalone in the end, it would be even more embarrassing.

Therefore, Zheng zhilun was caught in a dilemma.

Lu zhongguang, on the other hand, was extremely excited. He said passionately,””Today’s auction for the abalone King is really full of ups and downs and fierce competition! Our mysterious buyer No. 06 has bid 8.7 million Hong Kong dollars. Are there any other guests who want to bid higher?”

When Lu zhongguang said this, he looked at Zheng zhilun.
