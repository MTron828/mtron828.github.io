Chapter 1091: Great teacher and apprentice (2)

Translator: 549690339

“Don’t worry about it, ruofei,”Tang Yitian greeted him with a smile,”we’ll leave after sitting for a while!”

Xia ruofei still filled a pot of water and boiled it on the base. Then, he smiled and walked to the small reception area of the suite and sat opposite Tang Yitian’s family.

“Haoran, how’s your cultivation recently?” Xia ruofei asked directly.

Feng Jing had been present during the meal, so Xia ruofei did not ask about it. In fact, he was very concerned about it.

Tang Haoran immediately replied respectfully,””Master, my cultivation is going quite smoothly. It’s just that my progress is a little slow. I still haven’t felt the threshold of Qi disciple Level 2 ... If only I could cultivate every day as fast as the first time I absorbed the innate pure Yang Qi ...”

Tang Haoran had already gotten a glimpse of the path of cultivation. Before Xia ruofei left Australia, she had also taught him a lot of general knowledge about cultivation, including the innate pure Yang Qi that had been in his body for many years. Hence, he naturally would not refer to the innate pure Yang Qi as a “flaming monster”.

Compared to the time when he absorbed the innate pure Yang Qi, although his cultivation had improved, his speed was as slow as a snail.

In fact, Xia ruofei had the same feeling as well, so he immediately smiled and said,””You can’t eat everything in one go. The innate pure Yang Qi that master left for you is already the limit that your body can bear. Any more and it will cause harm to your body!”

Tang Yitian and Jennifer didn’t know much about cultivation, so after hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Tang Yitian quickly said,””Haoran, you can’t go wrong by listening to your master. You can’t be careless in your cultivation ...”

“I know, dad!” Tang Haoran said. Master definitely won’t harm me ...”

Xia ruofei and the other two couldn’t help but laugh when they heard Tang Haoran, a child, say such old words.

Xia ruofei continued,”Haoran, don’t be anxious when you’re building your foundation. You must do it step by step to build a solid foundation. Only then will you be able to go further in the future. Do you understand?”

“Yes, master!” Tang Haoran said.

When Xia ruofei was in Australia, he had already made a basic judgment. No matter how talented Tang Haoran was, it would take at least a few months for him to break through to the second level of the Qi refining stage on earth, where the spiritual Qi was so scarce.

Therefore, he was not disappointed with Tang Haoran’s current cultivation progress. Everything was within his expectations.

“When you have a solid foundation, I will find a way to increase your cultivation speed.” Xia ruofei said.

Tang Haoran’s eyes immediately lit up.”Thank you, master!”

Xia ruofei patted Tang Haoran’s head affectionately and said,””Come with me, I want to check on your cultivation progress and see if you’ve been slacking off during this time ...”

Then, Xia ruofei said to Tang Yitian and his wife,””Big brother Tang, sister – in – Law, you two sit here for a while!”

“It’s fine, it’s fine,” Tang Yitian said quickly.”We don’t have anything else to do tonight. You should give some advice to Haoran!”

This was related to his son’s cultivation, so Tang Yitian was naturally very concerned.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. Then, he brought Tang Haoran into the bedroom.

After Tang Haoran sat down cross – legged, Xia ruofei immediately used his spiritual power to check on Tang Haoran’s cultivation.

Xia ruofei’s cultivation was much higher than Tang Haoran ‘s, especially his spiritual power cultivation. So, after a quick examination, he could see Tang Haoran’s condition.

The true energy in his meridians had indeed become more condensed, and the total amount had increased by quite a bit. It was obvious that he had persevered in his cultivation during the time when the two of them had been separated.

Otherwise, it would be like rowing a boat against the current. If he did not advance, he would fall behind. Even if he slacked off for a few days, his cultivation would fall behind significantly.

Xia ruofei let Tang Haoran get up with satisfaction and said with a pleasant expression,””Not bad, not bad! Haoran, you really didn’t let master down. As long as you continue to cultivate, it shouldn’t be a problem for you to break through to the second level of the Qi refining stage within three months!”

Initially, Xia ruofei had estimated that Tang Haoran would need at least six to seven months or even a year’s time. Now, it seemed that he had underestimated Tang Haoran’s talent. This kid’s cultivation speed had exceeded Xia ruofei’s imagination.

“Really?” Tang Haoran was pleasantly surprised.

“Would master lie to you?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”but the premise is that you must persevere every day and not relax at all!”

“I definitely will!” Tang Haoran said firmly.

Through this period of cultivation, Tang Haoran had clearly felt the benefits. His body was much stronger than before, and his strength was also very great. If he used true energy, even Tang Yitian’s strength couldn’t be compared to his.

For a child, this change naturally made him surprised and happy. At the same time, his desire for power became stronger.

When he heard Xia ruofei say that he could break through in three months, Tang Haoran was suddenly filled with motivation.

Xia ruofei said seriously,”by then, you should be able to feel the bottleneck between the first and second stages of the Qi refining stage. When you are about to break through, it’s best for you to come to China. I have to be by your side to be at ease.”

Tang Haoran was touched and said,””I know, master ...”

Xia ruofei patted Tang Haoran’s head and began to answer his questions.

After all, Tang Haoran was still a child, and he spent most of his time cultivating alone. It was not easy for his master to have time to guide him, so he immediately threw out all the questions he had accumulated during this period of time.

Although Xia ruofei had never cultivated the “fierce yang Scripture”, the “great Dao Sutra” that he had cultivated pointed straight to the source. Moreover, he had only taught the contents of the “fierce yang Scripture” to Tang Haoran after learning it.

Hence, Xia ruofei began to answer Tang Haoran’s questions after thinking for a while.

Cultivation was like this. If a person were to put in all his effort, his efficiency would not be very high. However, with a few words of guidance from a great teacher, the fog would immediately be cleared, and one would feel as if good fortune had come to one’s heart.

Tang Haoran was like this now. He was beaming with joy as he listened. Some of the questions that had troubled him for many days were all solved.

By the time Xia ruofei finished explaining to Tang Haoran, more than an hour had passed. When he brought Tang Haoran out, Tang Yitian and Jennifer were watching TV on the sofa, not at all impatient.

Seeing Xia ruofei come out, Tang Yitian quickly asked,””RUO Fei, how’s Haoran’s cultivation?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Haoran is very talented. He’s also very hardworking. His cultivation progress is faster than I thought.”

“That’s good, that’s good ...” Tang Yitian said happily.

“Don’t worry, big brother Tang!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ve just checked. There’s no problem. Your Foundation is very solid. I’ve also answered some of the questions he had during his cultivation. He just needs to persist in his cultivation every day. ”

“Okay, okay, okay. We’ll make sure to keep him in check.” Tang Yitian quickly nodded.

“I’m very self – aware, okay?”Tang Haoran pouted. I’m the one who wakes up to cultivate in the morning. You and mom are still sleeping ...” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Tang Yitian couldn’t help but blush. He said,””You ...”

Jennifer, on the other hand, could not stop giggling.

It was getting late. Xia ruofei chatted with Tang Yitian’s family for a while before they said goodbye. At the same time, they made an appointment to pick Xia ruofei and Feng Jing up from the hotel the next morning.

Tang Haoran originally wanted to stay with Xia ruofei, but Tang Yitian was afraid that he would disturb Xia ruofei’s rest, so he took him away without any explanation.

After sending off Tang Yitian’s family, Xia ruofei returned to his room. He took out his phone and dialed song Rui’s number.

“Young master Xia! You finally have time to call me back!” Song Rui said exaggeratedly after picking up.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel a little apologetic. This guy seemed to have a lot of resentment.

He also knew that song Rui had something to discuss with him, but he had interrupted him twice.

Hence, Xia ruofei explained,”I’m on a business trip in the capital!” I’ve been busy all day, so I called you back as soon as I was done. ”

Song Rui couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise,””What? You’re also in the capital?”
