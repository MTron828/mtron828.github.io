This time, the space upgrade had used up five world stones, and it was based on the surplus space energy from the previous upgrade. According to Xia ruofei’s experience, the spirit map space’s difficulty increased with each upgrade.

Hence, Xia ruofei was not sure if the remaining seven world stones would be able to upgrade the realm again. All he could do was to pray to the heavens.

The Jade Emperor, Tathagata the Buddha, Taishang Laojun, Guan Yin Bodhisattva ... Xia ruofei prayed to all the gods he could think of, and soon, the seven world stones were completely absorbed.

When the last World stone was absorbed by the space and turned into nothing, Xia ruofei was stunned. Then, his heart sank. There was no movement in the spirit map space.

Clearly, 7 world stones were not enough to upgrade the realm to the next level. This was an awkward situation ...

The mountain and sea realm in the spirit map space.

Xia ruofei and Xia Qing stood at the foot of the mountain. In the herb garden in the distance, the White realm Fox was greedily comprehending the wonderful spatial rules.

“Do I have to level up again?” Xia ruofei asked.

Xia Qing nodded silently. He couldn’t say too much, but his meaning was clear.

Xia ruofei nodded and waved his hand. A huge invisible force immediately enveloped the White realm Fox, who was seriously comprehending the laws of space. It was then carried out of the herb garden and flew to Xia ruofei.

The White realm Fox was immersed in the mysterious space rules. It was naturally very unhappy that Xia ruofei had interrupted it.

“Little fellow, do you have any way to find new world stones in the shortest time possible?” Xia ruofei asked.

The White realmfox was stunned for a moment and then shook its head repeatedly. In its heart, it was filled with disdain for Xia ruofei.”Do you think realm stones are like cabbages?” If I could find it so easily, why would I stay in that dark place for more than a month and not bear to leave?

“Aren’t you very sensitive to world stones?” Xia ruofei’s eyes widened as he asked,”hurry up and sense it! I have an emergency!”

The realm Fox chirped a few times and gestured at Xia ruofei with a look of disdain.

“What does it mean?” Xia ruofei turned around and asked.

Xia Qing smiled bitterly and said,”master, world stones are extremely rare in any era. It’s already very lucky that we were able to obtain so many world stones at once. Even a world Fox wouldn’t be able to find them so easily.”

“Then what use do I have for you?” Xia ruofei looked at the white fox and said,”I’ve provided you with such a good place for free to comprehend the space rules, but you’re so lazy at the critical moment. You can’t help at all ...”

The White realmfox panicked, afraid that Xia ruofei would drive it out of the spirit map space. The rules of space here were extremely attractive to it, and it was impossible to come into contact with them in the outside world. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Xia ruofei looked at the white fox and said,””Little guy, don’t act pitiful with me. I don’t buy it! I’m really in need of world stones right now. Quickly, help me think of a way!”

The White realmfox seemed to be struggling, as if it was having a mental struggle.

One had to lower one’s head when one was under the roof ...

In the end, the white fox opened its mouth in pain and spat out a black stone.

Xia ruofei’s eyes brightened. He was extremely familiar with this aura. It was undoubtedly a world stone.

“You still have stock?” Xia ruofei said.

“Master, the world stones that the world Fox can’t finish absorbing are stored in the body first.” Xia Qing explained.

“But ... I clearly saw it biting those world stones into pieces!” Xia ruofei said.

Right now, they were looking at a complete world stone.

“I guess it’s temporarily unable to absorb so much, so it swallowed some whole. Now, it’s storing them in its body!” Xia Qing said after thinking for a while.

The White realmfox nodded its head quickly. It was feeling very depressed. It had only been in this place for a short while, and it had already paid a protection fee of a realmstone. It was really too expensive!

As long as Xia ruofei had the realm stone, it was fine. He didn’t care if the realm stone was disgusting when it was spat out from the realm Fox’s body, nor did he care how it was left behind. He immediately threw the realm stone into the air and with a thought.

The invisible force of the spirit map space immediately enveloped the world stone and began to absorb it rapidly.

The White realmfox looked at the shrinking realmstone in the sky with heartache. Immediately, it closed its eyes and began to comprehend. When the surrounding space absorbed the realmstone, the spatial fluctuations would become more distinct. This was a good opportunity that could not be missed.

Xia ruofei simply stayed in the space and stared at the world stone that was being absorbed. He was filled with anticipation and apprehension at the same time.

The spatial dimension was absorbing the world stone at an extremely fast speed. The black world stone was shrinking at a speed visible to the naked eye, and it was completely absorbed in a short while.

Xia ruofei’s eyes, which were full of anticipation, suddenly dimmed. The space still showed no signs of upgrading. The world stone was like a small stone thrown into the sea, not causing any waves at all.

Xia ruofei immediately turned to look at the white fox.

The white fox was so scared that it took a few steps away and looked at Xia ruofei with vigilance.

“Hehe ... Little fellow, do you still have any more world stones?” Xia ruofei looked at the white fox with ill intentions and said,”can you give me another eight or ten Yuan for emergency use?” I’ll just take it as I borrowed it from you. I’ll return it to you the next time I get it!”

The White realmfox shook its head frantically. What a joke! That was the last piece, and it had saved it up by scrimping. Where was it going to find eight or ten pieces now?
