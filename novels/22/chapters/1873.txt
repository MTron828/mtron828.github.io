Liu haojun clenched his fists discreetly, gritted his teeth, and left Zeng jianzhang’s office.

Zeng jianzhang shook his head, picked up the phone on the table, and called Wu Liqian.

Xia ruofei’s instructions to the Paradise Corporation had thrown the entire Changping County into chaos. It could be said that he was able to change the situation with little effort.

……

When Xia ruofei received Wu Liqian’s call, he was preparing to pack his things and leave work. Ling Qingxue couldn’t resist the urge to cultivate and had made an appointment with him to stay at the farm tonight. He was going to pick Ling Qingxue up and the two of them would go back to Taoyuan farm together.

Xia ruofei stuffed a few unfinished documents into his briefcase and walked out with his bag in one hand while taking the phone with the other.

“Sister Qian!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Ruofei, what’s going on over there?” Wu Liqian asked in an unfriendly tone.

Xia ruofei pretended to be confused and asked,”What do you mean what’s going on? Sister Qian, I don’t understand what you’re saying!”

“Are you playing dumb with me?” Wu Liqian said unhappily,”what’s with the inspection at Qingyuan? Also, the county party Committee has already contacted you about the meeting. Why did you reject it?”

Xia ruofei strode into the Chairman’s private elevator and pressed the button for the basement. Then, he smiled and said,””Isn’t an inspection normal? If you go to the market to buy vegetables, you have to compare the goods with three stores! Not to mention a billion – dollar project? As for the negotiation ... We didn’t reject it! It’s just that I’ve been busy recently and it’s hard to arrange my time, so I have to postpone it ...”

“Stop playing dumb with me!” Wu Liqian said,”that’s not what you told me two days ago.”

“What did I say?” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”I really don’t remember. I don’t know if it’s because I’m old, but my memory isn’t that good ...”

“Rascal!” Wu Liqian pouted and said,”ruofei, I’m not joking with you! “You promised me back then that this project would be invested in our Changping. Now that you’ve suddenly changed your mind, our Secretary even thinks that I’m not happy with you and that I’m up to no good behind your back ...”

Wu Liqian suddenly realized that it was inappropriate and shut her mouth in time. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Xia ruofei stepped out of the elevator and went to his own parking space. He opened the door of the Knight XV and threw his briefcase in. He leaned against the car and said,””Continue! Sister Qian, why did you stop?”

Wu Liqian was silent for a while before she said,””Ruofei, don’t get involved in this! I don’t want ...”

“Sister Qian, I’m not involved!” Xia ruofei said,”I did promise you a few days ago that I would invest in Changping. But you said it yourself, I did promise you, but I didn’t promise that bullsh * t Deputy Secretary!”

“RUO Fei!” Wu Liqian said,”no matter who’s in charge of this project, the final preferential conditions will not change. This is a win – win situation. The people of Changping County will get real benefits and Changping’s financial income will be able to reach a new level. This is what I want to see. As for personal honor and loss, I don’t care too much ...”

“You can ignore it because you are of noble character. But I have to care!” Xia ruofei said firmly,”this is a gift from me to you. Liu haojun is nothing! Did a good – for – nothing second generation want to overturn the heavens? I can’t get used to his bad habits! Just tell your Secretary that as long as Liu haojun is in Changping, I won’t invest a single cent in Changping! If they piss me off, I’ll move the farm away and we’ll break up!”
