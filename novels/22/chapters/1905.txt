Chapter 1906 Without anyone knowing (3)

The success or failure of a matter often depended on these very small details. Xu Yougang had always paid great attention to the details.

Xu Yougang said to the micro microphone in his inner pocket,””Aijun, I’ve entered unit 1902. Find a high point nearby where you can use binoculars to observe the entrance of Building 3. Once the target returns, report immediately!”

“Understood!” Zhang Aijun said calmly.

Then, Xu Yougang quickly took action. He put his Casual Backpack on the ground and took out the micro camera and listening device from inside.

Xu Yougang looked around. He pulled a chair over and planted a bug on the crystal Light in the living room.

This was one of the most commonly used lampshades. On one hand, once the light was turned on, very few people would look directly at the light source. Even if the light was not turned on, ordinary people would not deliberately look up at the lampshades, so the probability of being discovered was extremely low. On the other hand, there was a ready – made power source here. Just connecting one would ensure that the bug would continue to work.

Then, Xu Yougang installed a miniature camera at the corner of the curtain box. The power source was connected to the electric motor of the curtain, so it was very hidden.

Xu Yougang checked the image through a handheld receiver device and adjusted the angle of the camera to ensure that the image could cover the entire living room. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Next, Xu Yougang entered the bedroom and did the same thing. He installed a micro camera and a bug in the bedroom.

In the bedroom, Xu You just found a socket under the TV facing the big bed. He thought for a moment, then took out a screwdriver, opened the socket box, and connected a short wire from inside to power the camera. Then, he stuffed the small camera into one of the screw holes and put the socket box back.

The missing screw did not affect the fixing of the socket box. Unless it was a professional like Xu Yougang, it was almost impossible to notice that there was a camera hidden in the screw hole.

After the installation was completed, Xu Yougang said into the microphone,””Aijun, check the long – range image and audio reception!”

“Alright!”

On the rooftop of an old residential area, Zhang Aijun placed the binoculars aside and took out a laptop from his bag. He quickly turned it on and inserted a small receiver into the USB port.

A client had been installed on the desktop. After Zhang Aijun turned it on, the images from the two cameras immediately appeared on the laptop.

“The image is very clear, and there’s no lag at all!” “Squad leader Xu, you really get what you pay for!” Zhang Aijun said.

“Take off your headphones and try out the sound – receiving effect of the eavesdropper!” Xu Yougang said.

“Understood!” Zhang Aijun took off the Bluetooth headset from the walkie – talkie and put on the headset from the computer.”Done!” He said.

“Sound test! A sound test! “1,2,3,4,5,6 ...” Xu Yougang said.

“No problem! The sound is very clear!” Zhang Aijun said.

Xu Yougang went to the living room and tried the audio recording function. After confirming that the equipment was working, he said,””Aijun, continue monitoring! I’m preparing to leave!”

“Received!” Zhang Aijun said.

Xu Yougang quickly put all the things that he had just touched back to their original places and cleared all traces of his entry. Then, he opened the door of Room 1902, flashed out, and locked the door.

There were surveillance cameras in the elevator, so Xu Yougang took the stairs directly. He soon reached the first floor.

Although there would often be people passing by after dawn, he still found an opportunity to climb over the wall and leave the community ...
