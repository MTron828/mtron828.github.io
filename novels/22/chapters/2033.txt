2034 An unexpected gain (2)

Then, Xia ruofei used his spiritual power and said to Xia Qing,””Watch it! Report to me immediately if anything happens!”

“Yes! Master!” Xia Qing said respectfully.

Next, Xia ruofei placed two layers of space outside the space cage where the White realmfox was imprisoned, locking it up tightly.

The rules of space here were different from the outside world. The White realmfox had used all its strength, but it still couldn’t shake the space cage. Now that there were two more layers, it had to accept its fate and stopped going crazy.

Xia ruofei then retracted his spiritual power.

He closed the small box and said,””Ah hai! Zhengfeng! Come in!”

After lui hai and lui zhengfeng came in, Xia ruofei said to them,””Hurry up and let the brothers come in to move! Oh right, I want this box ...”

“Yes!” Lui hai and lui zhengfeng said in unison.

From their point of view, everything in the treasure room was Xia ruofei’s spoils of war, including the box in his hands. Hence, they were only curious about the item in the box and were not dissatisfied at all.

After the members of the Hong sect came in, Lyu hai and Lyu zhengfeng divided the work.

Lyu hai went outside to supervise the people moving the boxes into the car, while Lyu zhengfeng stayed in the treasure room. He found a stack of white paper and wrote a seal. Before each box was moved out of the treasure room, the seal was stuck on it.

One of the brothers was inside, and the other was outside. This basically put an end to the possibility of this batch of treasures being stolen.

It was a little troublesome to move the antiques and oil paintings, but it was easy to find a few boxes in the large Gelman Manor.

They found boxes of different sizes and stuffed them with waste paper, foam, and other shock absorbers. They also packed the antiques and oil paintings on the wall one by one, put on seals, and carried them out.

One van couldn’t fit everything, so lui hai asked people to drive two more vans and finally loaded all the items in the treasure room.

Old Gehrman watched helplessly as his family’s treasures were taken away. His heart felt like it was bleeding, but he had no other choice.

Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to check. He even considered the box’s unique attribute of shielding his spiritual power. After checking with his spiritual power, he personally knocked on the walls a few times to make sure that he did not miss any hidden space. Then, he left the treasure room through the secret passage.

“Sir, everything has been loaded into the car!” Lu zhengfeng said respectfully.

“What about the other brothers?” Xia ruofei nodded.

“It’s almost done!” Lu zhengfeng said,”those that need to be cleaned up have been cleaned up. Those that need to be taken away have also been loaded into the car!”

Xia ruofei nodded and looked around. He realized that other than old Gehrman, who was tied up and thrown on the carpet, the bodyguards and Butler were all gone.

He could roughly guess what would happen to these people. Basically, anyone who could pose a threat to the Hong sect would not be able to escape death. After all, this was the Gehrman Manor. Those who remained were the loyal followers of the Gehrman family. If they were not eliminated, they might become a hidden danger in the future. And those who were indeed old, weak, women, and children would also be driven out of the manor area.

“Then it’s about time to retreat ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Then, he slowly walked to old Gehrman and squatted down.

Although old ghelman no longer had any hope of staying alive, he still couldn’t help but tremble when the moment came, and his eyes were full of fear.

At this moment, old Gehrman finally experienced the fear and despair in the hearts of the people he tortured and killed before they died.

However, to his surprise, Xia ruofei did not kill him directly. He only patted him lightly and said with a smile,””Goodbye, Mr. Gelman!”

After he finished speaking, he stood up and walked straight out.

Old Gelman was stunned. You’re letting me off just like that? This didn’t make sense!

And ... Since you don’t intend to kill me, can you please release that damn rope first?

Not only old Gelman, but also Lyu hai and Lyu zhengfeng were stunned.

Lui hai hurried to catch up with Xia ruofei, saying in a low voice,””Mr. Xia, we can’t let this old man Live!”

“I know!” Xia ruofei said without turning his head.

Lui hai thought for a while and said,””Understood!”

“Understand what?” Xia ruofei smiled and glanced at him.”I didn’t ask you to kill him! Let’s go! Don’t let our brothers wait, hurry up and get in the car!”

“Ah?” Lui hai was stunned.

After all this talk, you still want to let this old man go?

Although he was full of questions, Xia ruofei was no different from a God in his heart. He did not hesitate to follow Xia ruofei’s order and immediately called Lu zhengfeng to follow.

At first, Lu zhengfeng was a little worried about the treasure in the van and wanted to escort it with the van. However, Xia ruofei stopped him and let him go with him.

What a joke, with him in the convoy, the treasures in the Vans couldn’t possibly fly away.

Thus, it was still Lu zhengfeng who drove. Xia ruofei, Lu hai, Monica and Monica all sat in the same car. Soon, the team drove out of the Gelman Manor.

The huge Manor was quiet. The bodyguards, guards, and other staff members had either been killed by the Hong sect brothers or driven out, leaving only old Gelman, who was tied up and thrown on the ground.

As the car drove on the private road outside the manor, Xia ruofei, who was sitting in the middle row, suddenly asked with a smile,””You guys don’t understand, right?”

“I don’t dare!” Lui hai said hurriedly,”Mr. Xia must have his own reasons for not killing old Gelman. We dare not speculate!”

Xia ruofei took out the remote control from his pocket with a smile and handed it to lui hai.

Lui hai was stunned and took it subconsciously.

While driving, Lu zhengfeng turned his head and took a look. He asked curiously, “Isn’t this the old man’s remote control? Speaking of which, she was really shocked by him at that time! I didn’t expect that old man to be bluffing!”

Xia ruofei revealed a mischievous smile and said,””Zhengfeng, why don’t you try pressing it?”

“Isn’t this thing broken?” Lyu zhengfeng was confused. He held the steering wheel with one hand and took the remote control from Lyu hai with the other.

Then, he found the only button on the remote control and pressed it hard.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

A violent explosion sounded behind him, and the entire ground shook.

Lu zhengfeng, who was driving, was even more shocked. His hands trembled and he almost drove the car into a ditch. Fortunately, Xia ruofei was prepared. He held the back of the driver’s seat with one hand and adjusted the direction for him with the other.

Lu zhengfeng stepped hard on the brake and stopped the car.

The other vehicles in the convoy were also shocked by the explosion and stopped one after another.

Lu zhengfeng turned around and looked at the Gelman Manor that had been blown to ruins. His voice had changed a little.”Mr ... Mr. Xia, what’s going on?”

Xia ruofei held back his laughter and said seriously,””Zhengfeng! Well done! All the evidence of our activities in the manor will be destroyed! I told you that there was no need to deal with the surveillance video!”

“No... I ...” Lu zhengfeng looked at the remote control in his hand, and the scene of old Gehrman pressing it hard but not being able to move kept appearing in his mind.”Didn’t old Gehrman just ...”

“You’re talking about that old man!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you’ve blown him up with your own hands! The explosives were buried right under his butt. I’m guessing that he’s been blown up to the point where not even his bones can be found!”

“I ...” Lu zhengfeng did not know whether to laugh or cry.

Xia ruofei’s godlike image in his mind started to crumble. Where did such a naughty God come from? When the explosion happened, he was so scared that he almost peed his pants ... And he had already killed so many core members of the Gelman family, so why did he keep this old man alive? He even tricked him into pressing that button ...

Killing people was nothing to Lu zhengfeng, but he would still have a little shadow in his heart if he blew a person up until not even the bones were left.

Lui hai also looked at lui zhengfeng with a funny expression,””Alright, alright, hurry up and drive! The police should be here soon! By the way, inform the brothers in the front car that we’ll take a slight detour and not let the surveillance cameras along the way capture us!” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Oh! Alright!” Lu zhengfeng said quickly. Then, he restarted the car and directed the convoy to continue moving forward through the walkie – talkie.
