“Yes, master!” Liu Kuan, who had been waiting at the door, walked in and said to Xia ruofei respectfully,”Mr. Xia, this way please!”

“Dad!” Liu Qunfeng quickly said. I’ll do it!”

“You stay!” “I have something to say to you!” Old man Liu said indifferently.

Xia ruofei glanced at Liu Qunfeng, then nodded at elder Liu and left the room with Liu Kuan.

Although Xia ruofei had left, his mental strength was still in the direction of old master Liu’s room, monitoring every move of the Liu father and son.

Even if Liu Qunfeng didn’t invite him for a follow – up, he would have gone to the Liu family’s courtyard and used his mental power to investigate. He wanted to at least know how the Liu family was going to deal with Liu haojun.

Judging from old master Liu’s current attitude, Liu haojun’s fate was most likely grim.

In the room, elder Liu looked at Liu Qunfeng sternly and asked,””Qunfeng, do you really want to tip off your son so badly?”

Liu Qunfeng had sent elder song out and immediately welcomed Xia ruofei in. They had not been alone for the entire time.

When Xia ruofei was checking on old master Liu, old master Liu did not let Liu Qunfeng leave.

However, the last two times, Liu Qunfeng was trying to find a chance to leave the room.

The first time was when he suddenly suggested that Xia ruofei perform acupuncture on old master Liu. According to Xia ruofei’s rules, no one was allowed to watch when he was officially treating old master Liu. This way, Liu Qunfeng could leave in a justified manner.

The other time, he offered to send Xia ruofei out. He had the same purpose.

Old man Liu was so happy that he was able to see through Liu Qunfeng’s little plan. At the same time, he ruthlessly destroyed Liu Qunfeng’s little plan.

Liu Qunfeng didn’t dare to look at elder Liu. He looked down at his feet and said,””Dad, I didn’t want to disclose anything ...”

“Hmph! You know best in your heart whether you’ve thought about it or not!” Old master Liu snorted coldly and said,”didn’t you hear what Mr. Xia said just now? In my current state, I can’t even accept acupuncture. If I continue in this state, the treatment will be greatly affected! The peaks! You guys are really filial! You’re afraid that I’ll recover too quickly? You’re always looking for something to give me trouble, right? I don’t think I’ll be killed by the cancer cells. Instead, I’ll be angered to death by you unfilial descendants!”

Liu Qunfeng’s heart skipped a beat, especially when old man Liu’s sharp gaze fell on him. He felt like he was being stared at by an ancient beast, and he felt uncomfortable.

“Dad!” Liu Qunfeng explained. I really didn’t know about this ...”

“So, haojun made his own decision?” Old man Liu said coldly.

“Dad!” Liu Qunfeng quickly said. This might not be the case! Maybe someone was trying to frame him! Haojun and song Qiming have no grudges, how could he ...”

“No grudges? I don’t think so?” “Song Qiming is the leader of the southeast province and Sanshan city. Liu haojun suffered a crushing defeat in the southeast province and came back with his tail between his legs. Doesn’t Liu haojun hate song Qiming at all?”

“Even if he had an opinion, he shouldn’t be so crazy as to assassinate song Qiming!” Liu Qunfeng retorted helplessly,”if we’re talking about hatred, he should hate Xia ruofei the most. Why would he spend so much money on song Qiming?” This doesn’t make any sense!”

“Are you trying to say that the song family is trying to frame you?” Old man Liu asked coldly.

“That’s possible!”Liu Qunfeng said. Maybe the song family couldn’t find the murderer, so they deliberately concocted these things to extort us ...”

“Enough! Do you think I’m an idiot?” Old master Liu slapped the bed and said sternly,”you don’t have to say anything. You can stay here for the next two days and don’t go to the office for the time being!”

It was obvious that elder Liu wanted to put Liu Qunfeng under house arrest, and the biggest purpose was to prevent Liu Qunfeng from disclosing any information.

Liu Qunfeng’s face changed slightly, and he said,””Dad! Haojun is your grandson! How could you be so cruel ...”

“What nonsense are you talking about?” Elder Liu glared at Liu Qunfeng and said,”alright, calm down first!”

Then, old man Liu raised his voice and said,””Liu Yong! Liu Chuang!”

“Chief!” Two burly men appeared at the door.

Liu Qunfeng’s expression changed when he saw the two of them. He knew that his father was serious this time.

“Take Qunfeng to rest!” Old man Liu said indifferently. You have to take good care of his life. ”

“Yes! Chief!” The two of them replied in unison.

“QUN FENG, hand over your communication device!” Old man Liu said,”I hope you won’t make the same mistake again ...”

Liu Qunfeng took out his two phones and put them on the bedside table. Then, he followed the two men out of elder Liu’s room like a zombie.

Liu Qunfeng knew very well that there was no way he could hide his communication device in front of Liu Yong and Liu Chuang. Instead of being found by the two, he might as well hand it over himself, or it would be more embarrassing.

Old man Liu had mobilized the most elite force in the family to watch over him, which showed how determined he was.

Haojun, it’s up to you whether you can get through this ... Liu Qunfeng said in his heart, I really can’t help you anymore ...

Xia ruofei walked to the courtyard and prepared to get into the car. He had been monitoring elder Liu’s room with his mental power all the way down the stairs, so he knew exactly what had happened.

“What an exciting show!” Xia ruofei muttered to himself.

Liu Kuan walked Xia ruofei to the car. When Xia ruofei got into the car, the electric door of Elfa slowly closed, and Liu Kuan still stood by the car.

The Toyota Elfa started the car slowly. Liu Kuan also bowed slightly to greet Xia ruofei.

After the car left the Liu family’s courtyard, they drove for about a hundred meters. When the car made a turn, Xia ruofei suddenly said,””Wu Qiang, stop by the side.”

“Boss, this seems to be a no – parking area ...” Wu Qiang could not help but remind him.

“It’s okay. Just pull over to the side. I’ll pay the fine.” Xia ruofei said straightforwardly.

“Understood!” Wu Qiang no longer hesitated. He slowly pulled the car to the side and turned on the double flashing lights.

Xia ruofei leaned on the soft space capsule chair with his eyes closed as if he was half – awake, but in fact, his spiritual power was locked on to elder Liu’s room.

From now on, he had to keep an eye on the Liu family. At least, he had to know how the Liu family would deal with Liu haojun.

If Liu haojun was really lifted up high and then put down lightly, Xia ruofei would not hold back. He would use his own methods to take Liu haojun’s life.

In the room.

Old man Liu watched Liu Qunfeng being taken away by Liu Yong and Liu Chuang with a blank expression. Then, he sat on the bed silently and didn’t move for a long time.

This time, he really felt the pain.

In just an hour, the losses of the Liu family could be said to be extremely painful, while the song family naturally made a lot of money.

Because of Liu haojun’s matter, the Liu family had fallen into a completely passive situation. Elder song had personally come to question them, which put a lot of pressure on elder Liu. After an intense confrontation, the Liu family had given up a lot of benefits, and elder Liu had personally promised that he would severely punish Liu haojun and give the song family a satisfactory explanation.

When he thought of the huge amount of benefits he had given away today, his heart felt like it was bleeding. He couldn’t help but curse again,””Bastard! He’s an absolute bastard!”

No one knew if he was referring to Liu haojun or the greedy old song.

After a moment of silence, old man Liu picked up the phone on the bedside table and dialed a number. He said indifferently,””Come to my place immediately!”
