Pyol and the two survivors used all their strength to push the raft, and it started to move forward.

This was their hope to return to civilized society! The three of them felt like they had an endless supply of energy. As the wooden sticks reduced the friction below, the speed of the wooden raft became faster and faster. Finally, it rushed into the sea.

Puyol and the others followed behind and quickly stepped on the water to jump onto the raft. They then used the suggested oars to stick into the sand, trying their best to stabilize the raft.

According to his observations over the past few days, this time was about to be low tide. If it was not fixed, the raft would soon float outside.

He chose this time to go out to sea to save some energy.

If it was a high tide, they might row desperately, but the raft would still be spinning around the island!

David quickly jogged over, handed John Junior to Puyol, and then climbed up the raft with some difficulty.

On the other hand, Xia ruofei lightly stepped on the ground and landed on the raft five to six meters away. This unintentional display of his skills had made Puyol and the others full of admiration for him. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Xia ruofei came to the edge of the simple deck and sat down.””Let’s go!”

“Let’s go!”Pyol’s voice trembled. Let’s go!”

He and the other survivor pushed the oars hard, and the raft began to slide towards the sea.

The survivors were both excited and complicated. They looked at the deserted island behind them and thought that as long as they could return to civilization this time, they would never go out to sea again, especially in this damn place. They would never come back for a second time.

Xia ruofei, on the other hand, had a faint smile on his face as he looked at the green Immortal Island. “I’ll be back! By then, I should have completely refined the residence – guarding wooden token ...”

Elder Puyol led the survivors to row the oars with all their might, and the raft gradually left green Immortal Island with the help of the low tide.

The small island became smaller and smaller in everyone’s vision. The survivors paddled hard. At this time, someone inadvertently looked back and suddenly exclaimed,””Everyone, look! The island ... The island ... It’s gone!”

“Don’t joke around. How far did you draw? how could it have disappeared ... Ah! “He’s really gone ...”Puyol shouted.

When they looked back, they could no longer see the deserted island that they had lived on for many years. The view of the sea was very good today, and they could see very far away. How could the deserted island disappear? They had only rowed a thousand meters at most!

Xia ruofei’s face was calm, but he was actually very shocked.

Elder Puyol and the others did not see it, but he had been paying attention to the situation on the island. He was sitting on the edge of the simple deck with his back facing the direction of the raft. It could be said that he had a clear view of the situation on green Immortal Island.

Just now, Xia ruofei clearly felt that the space around green travel Immortal Island seemed to have been distorted and then the entire Island disappeared from his sight.

Xia ruofei had an epiphany and said in his heart,”‘Perhaps the situation is the opposite. The space we are in is instantly distorted, which is why we can see such a magical scene ...’

In any case, one thing seemed to be clear, and that was that they had now left the range of green travel Immortal Island.

Moreover, because of the mansion – guarding wooden token in his body, Xia ruofei could still vaguely sense the location of green travel Immortal Island. He only felt that the immortal Island was very, very far away from him.

However, no matter what the herb garden was, he could still rely on the trace of the mansion – guarding wooden token to find the green Immortal Island.

At this moment, Puyol carefully said,””Divine immortal, can we see ... If the positioning equipment you brought is back to normal?”

Xia ruofei came back to her senses and nodded.””Alright! You guys continue to row forward ...”

“Okay, okay ...” Puyol said quickly.

Xia ruofei took out the GPS locator. As expected, after turning it on, the GPS found the satellite.

Xia ruofei looked at his current position and couldn’t help but exclaim,””I’ll go ...”

Puyol immediately stopped paddling and ran over to ask carefully,””Daoist immortal, what’s wrong?”

Xia ruofei looked at Puyol and asked with a smile,””I remember you said that the location of the disaster was in the Atlantic Ocean, right?”

“Yes, the cruise ship’s route was in the Atlantic Ocean.” Puyol said.

“Pjoll, can you guess where we are now?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“Could it be ... Not in the Atlantic Ocean?” Puyol asked.

“See for yourself!” Xia ruofei turned the GPS screen to Puyol.

After Puyol took a look, he couldn’t help but rub his eyes. He took another look and then exclaimed,””Impossible! How ... How could this be possible? We’re actually in the Indian Ocean ... And not far from Australia ... Mr. Deity, this ... This device isn’t broken, right?”

“The equipment must be good!” Xia ruofei said.

“That’s impossible! We were in the Atlantic Ocean, and although we drifted along with the lifeboats, how far could we have drifted? This place is almost half the earth away from where we were at that time!” Puyol’s face was filled with disbelief.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Puyol, don’t look at this matter with fixed thinking.” Have you ever seen an Island that just disappeared? Have you ever seen such a huge Python? Also, have you ever seen someone as strong as I am?”

Every time Xia ruofei asked a question, Puyol would shake his head.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”that’s right.” There are many things that can’t be explained by science!”

Puyol also felt relieved. He smiled and said,””You’re right. As long as we can return to civilization, it doesn’t matter if it’s the Indian Ocean or the Atlantic Ocean!”

“Hahaha!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”we’re quite lucky. This place isn’t too far from the usual sea routes. There might be ships passing by ...”

“I hope so! “Now that the island has disappeared, we can’t go back even if we want to. If we can’t find help, we’ll starve to death or die of thirst here ...” Puyol said.

“Don’t worry! With me here, you won’t die ...”Xia ruofei said,” alright, put in more effort!”

After Xia ruofei saw their current location, he tried not to use the satellite phone to ask for help. Perhaps he could directly meet a cargo ship passing by. After all, they were not far from the traditional route.

His main concern was that using a satellite phone or the internet would leave traces.

After all, after he found help for Puyol and the others, he would definitely leave before the rescue ships arrived. If he left any traces, it was likely that people would trace them back, and it would be troublesome.

When Xia ruofei discovered that there was someone on green Immortal Island, he had already changed his appearance. Even if Puyol and the rest returned to the civilized society, they would never be able to discover his identity.

Although Xia ruofei could use some technical means to cover up the traces of using the internet, he was not 100% sure. So, he decided to try his best not to use satellite phones or the internet.

With the GPS positioning, Puyol and the others followed Xia ruofei’s guidance and headed towards the busy cargo route.

In the evening, Puyol and the others, who had been paddling for the whole day in turns, were exhausted.

Xia ruofei asked David and the others to rest and eat something to recharge their energy.

He called Puyol over and took out five handheld flame signals from his backpack and handed them to him.

Xia ruofei said,”Puyol, this Sea area is very close to the traditional transport route. However, the sea is vast. The probability of encountering ships is very low. These handheld fireworks are very effective at night. You can see them from far away.” So, from now on, release a distress signal every few hours, understand?”
