Chapter 111: The strong Wu Liqian (1)

Deng Ming, who had an unforgiving look on his face, immediately frowned when he heard this. The look in his eyes as he looked at Wu Liqian became complicated, and his mind was spinning rapidly. He had indeed invested a few million Yuan in a project in Changping County a few days ago. Wu Liqian’s words carried a faint threat, and Deng Ming immediately became vigilant. Could it be that she really dared to cause trouble for my project? Deng Ming said in his heart. He quickly analyzed the situation and was very depressed to find that Wu Liqian seemed to really have the confidence. Behind her stood Tian Huilan, a member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and the leader of the three mountains, while his father was only a Deputy Mayor who was ranked at the bottom. If Wu Liqian really wanted to stand up for him, his father, the Deputy Mayor, might not be able to do anything. A county official was not as good as the current one. No matter how powerful Deputy Mayor Deng was, he couldn’t directly interfere with the Deputy County Head of Changping County, especially when the Deputy County Head had such a terrifying background. After weighing the pros and cons, the expression on Deng Ming’s face changed again and again. In the end, he said with great unwillingness,”County Head Wu, since you’ve stepped in, I’ll give you face. Let’s end this matter here!” Wu Liqian finally smiled and said,””Thank you, Xiao Deng.” Deng Ming looked at Xia ruofei and the rest with a dark expression, then said to his scoundrel friends,””Let’s go!” Wu Liqian pondered for a moment and said,””Xiao Deng, wait a minute. Let’s talk in private.” “Do you have any other instructions, Mayor Wu?” Deng Ming asked, frowning. Obviously, he was very dissatisfied with Wu Liqian’s use of his project in Changping County as a threat. Wu Liqian smiled and motioned for Deng Ming to follow her. When they arrived at a place where no one was around, Wu Liqian said in a low voice,””Xiao Deng, I really hope that today’s matter will end here. You know what I mean.” “County Head Wu, isn’t that all?” Deng Ming asked. I’ve already followed your instructions and endured being slapped in the face. What else do you want?” When he spoke, the hatred in his eyes was obvious. Wu Liqian knew that a pampered man like him would definitely use all kinds of means to deal with Xia ruofei. He would also make it so that no one could find any evidence that he was the one who did it. The reason why she called Deng Ming to the side was to help Xia ruofei solve the problem. Therefore, Wu Liqian said to Deng Ming with a meaningful tone,”If that’s the case, that’s naturally the best. Xiao Deng, I just wanted to give you a reminder. There’s no other meaning. By the way ... Secretary Tian also admires RUO Fei very much. There are some things that you have to consider carefully before doing. ” Deng Ming’s eyes narrowed slightly when he heard Wu Liqian’s words. Wu Liqian didn’t do much. She patted Deng Ming’s shoulder and walked toward Xia ruofei. Deng Ming stood in a daze for a moment before he called his friends to return to the private room. Xia ruofei smiled and said to Wu Liqian,””Sis Wu, thank you for helping me out!” “It’s nothing,”Wu Liqian said with a smile. By the way, this Deng Ming is the son of the government’s Deputy Mayor Deng. He’s a bit extreme, so if he comes looking for trouble with you again in the future, you must tell me, and I’ll help you to coordinate. ” “Alright! Thank you so much, sis Wu!” Xia ruofei said. “Mm! I still have a few old colleagues over there, so I’ll go back first. ” Wu Liqian said with a smile. Wu Liqian did not hesitate to help Xia ruofei today, even if it might offend Deputy – Mayor Deng. She was very clear about Xia ruofei’s position in the Tian family. On this trip back to the three mountains, Wu Liqian had also gone to Tian Huilan to report her work. Tian Huilan had also mentioned that Xia ruofei was running a farm in Changping County. Although she had not explicitly instructed Wu Liqian to take care of him, her meaning was clear. Based on Wu Liqian’s understanding of Tian Huilan, Xia ruofei’s position in her heart was definitely not a small one. As Tian Huilan’s most trusted subordinate, Wu Liqian naturally had to support Xia ruofei. After Wu Liqian left, Xia ruofei said to pang Hao,””Little fatty, I’m leaving too. You tell Yuan Lili and the others.” “Ah? You’re leaving just like that?” Pang Hao said in surprise,”they’re still waiting to offer you a toast!” Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.”I can’t drink anymore ... Please help me apologize to Yuan Lili. Tell her that I have something to do. I’ll go back first.” By the way, you have my number. We’ll contact each other later!” “Alright then ...” Pang Hao said,”ruofei, thank you for today!” “We’re brothers, no need to be so polite!” Xia ruofei patted pang Hao’s shoulder and said. “Lingyun, let’s go,” he said to ye Lingyun. “Yes! Instructor Xia!” Ye linyun replied. The two of them walked side by side toward the elevator, while pang Hao returned to the private room. In Deng Ming’s private room, his gang of scoundrels were adding fuel to the fire with one sentence after another. “Young master Deng! Today’s matter is too depressing!” “Yup! We can’t just let it go like this ...” “Who’s that kid? How arrogant!” “I’ll ask Ah Biao to bring a few people to deal with him!” Deng Ming was a little annoyed by the People’s words. He waved his hand and frowned.”Alright, alright, let me think about it!” “Young master Deng, you’re not going to just take this lying down, are you? What did that female County Head say to you to make you so afraid?” “She said that the kid is very close to Secretary Tian ... But I think she’s probably bluffing!” Deng Ming said after taking a deep puff of his cigarette. “Absolutely! I’ve never heard of him in Sanshan city. How could he know Secretary Tian?” “She’s using the Tiger’s skin as a banner! Young master Deng. ” “I think so too!” Deng Ming nodded. Ah Hua, find someone to investigate this kid’s background and find out who he is!” “Alright!” Ah Hua grinned. Deng Ming threw the cigarette butt on the ground and stomped on it,””He better have some background, otherwise ... I’ll definitely teach him an unforgettable lesson!” …… Xia ruofei and ye Lingyun walked out of the West River Moon Club side by side and arrived at the parking lot outside the third workshop and Seventh Street. “You didn’t drink, right?” Xia ruofei asked. “No, I didn ‘t!” “Alright then, you drive!” Xia ruofei said as he threw the car keys to ye Lingyun. “Yes!” Ye Lingyun didn’t say much and didn’t ask where Xia ruofei was going. He just took the keys and started the pickup. Xia ruofei set the navigation route back to Taoyuan farm on his phone and clipped his phone on the stand above the central console. Ye Lingyun nodded in understanding and drove the pickup truck forward according to the navigation. Xia ruofei passed another cigarette to ye Lingyun and took one for himself. The two of them smoked without saying a word and the car was silent. Xia ruofei stubbed out his cigarette in the ashtray when the car was on the highway. He asked,””Ling Yun, tell me, why did you suddenly retire from the military when you were doing well? And you’ve even become someone’s personal bodyguard. This isn’t your style!”Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com
