Chapter 764: Xiao hei’s appearance (1)

Guo Zhan’s experience was also very rich. He muttered to himself for a moment before loudly saying,”The beach!”

Xia ruofei nodded.”Yes, one side of Sanshan city faces the sea. Although the port and pier are already under control, it’s not difficult to smuggle as long as they have money. They only need to contact a small fishing boat in advance and they can escape to the high seas!”

“If a ship is arranged in advance in the International waters ...” Guo Zhan’s expression could not help but become serious.

“I think they’re more likely to choose this route of escape than to escape into the forest.” Xia ruofei said.

“There’s no time to waste!” Guo Zhan immediately stood up and said,”this loophole must be filled as soon as possible!”

Guo Zhan had too many things to do since yesterday. The death of old Luo, the squad leader, had also made him a little confused. In addition, Jin Gang’s injury also affected his heart. While he was looking after Jin Gang in the General Hospital, he also had to coordinate with the major units in the military and land, so it was inevitable that he would miss something.

Xia ruofei said calmly,”Wolf King, I think we can still make it.” Think about it, if you were them, would you escape on an illegal immigration ship the moment you held professor Liang hostage?”

Guo Zhan also slowly calmed down. He thought for a moment before his eyes brightened and said, “That’s right! Yesterday, we immediately sealed off the airport, port, dock, and all major traffic routes. We also strengthened the patrols in the coastal waters. As long as the other party is not an idiot, they will not take the risk to break through at this time!”

Xia ruofei snapped his fingers and said,”Yes! The most likely choice for them is to find a safe place to hide for the time being. Our high – pressure situation can’t last long. When the situation is less tense, they will be able to escape at ease!”

Guo Zhan nodded in agreement with Xia ruofei’s point of view. He continued,”But we can’t let our guard down. I’ll immediately coordinate with the higher – ups to contact the coast police and ask them to increase the frequency of their patrols. At the same time, I’ll inform the border police stations and the local coastal governments to increase the intensity of their inspections and form a deterrent against illegal immigration ships!”

After that, Guo Zhan immediately took out his secret mobile phone to contact the relevant military department and arranged the work in an orderly manner.

After the phone call, Guo Zhan slightly frowned and said,””Blood Wolf, we are just surrounding them. It’s like waiting for a rabbit, but we can’t get more information to attack ...”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”Wolf King, how about this?” Today, I’ll give Xiao Jin another dose of medicine. The toxins in his body will basically be completely removed, and we won’t have to stay in the General Hospital anymore. Gather the comrades from the two teams together. I want to go to the scene to take a look. ”

......

“Live?” Guo Zhan said,”Tian Feilong has already done a thorough inspection of the scene. He didn’t find any useful information.”

Tian Feilong was an intelligence expert of the lone wolf commando team. He was also the highest level of on – Site Investigation among the lone wolf commando team. If there were any clues at the scene, it was basically impossible to escape his eyes.

Xia ruofei laughed.”Captain, I’m not doubting Xiao Tian’s skills. But we don’t have any useful clues anyway. It’s not like we’ll lose anything if we go to the scene. If there’s a new discovery, won’t we make a profit?”

Guo Zhan thought for a moment and nodded,”en!” It’s fine to go and take a look. ”

Hence, Guo Zhan started to contact the team members while Xia ruofei called Feng Jing, Ling Qingxue, and Hu Zi’s mother. He told them that he had something to do in the next few days and told them not to worry.

Xia ruofei even gave Lei Hu a special call to remind him that he was still worried about Xue Fei. Although this bastard must be suffering in the hospital now, it was hard to guarantee that he would not send people to harm Lin Qiao.

Hence, Xia ruofei asked Lei Hu to personally drive Lin Qiao back to the farm and ordered him to strengthen the security of the farm in his absence.

After the two of them had arranged everything, they went to the intensive care unit together.

Xia ruofei did the same thing as last night and added the spirit Heart Flower petal solution into the bag.

But this time, he appropriately reduced the dosage. After Qianqian took the medicine yesterday, the poison had been cleared by about 80%. This time, he could not take as much medicine as yesterday.

With the petal solution of the spirit Heart Flower, the toxins in Jin Gang’s body would definitely be cleared very quickly. Furthermore, the remaining components of the petal solution would also be of some help to the recovery of his external injuries.

Guo Zhan had no more worries.

He called a team member to come to the hospital to take care of Jin Gang. Before the team member arrived, he greeted the General Hospital and left the specialist building with Xia ruofei.

When they arrived downstairs, Xia ruofei said to Guo Zhan,””Captain, I have something to do. Let’s meet at the north gate of Sanshan University in half an hour!” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Alright!” Guo Zhan said,”don’t bring too many people to the scene this time. I’ll inform everyone to be on standby. I’ll bring Tian Feilong over to wait for you.”

“Alright!”

Xia ruofei drove the Knight XV off – Road vehicle and said goodbye to Guo Zhan. After leaving the General Hospital, Xia ruofei took a small detour and drove to a relatively secluded location without any cameras. With a thought, he summoned Blackie, who had been living in the Spirit map space.

Blackie left the environment of the spirit map space and suddenly arrived at a strange place. It was suddenly flustered and agitated. However, when it saw Xia ruofei beside it, it immediately quieted down. It wagged its tail at Xia ruofei and obediently lay down in the front passenger seat.
