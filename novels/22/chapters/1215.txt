It turned out that after li Chenggong had explained everything, he knew that he would not be able to escape from prison. His hatred for Xia ruofei grew deeper and deeper. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Previously, he was still a little afraid of Xia ruofei’s strange methods. However, now that he was about to be transferred to the detention center, he would have to go to prison if his sentence was longer. He felt that even if Xia ruofei wanted to take revenge on him, he would not go to prison.

Therefore, after explaining the problem, li Chenggong started to complain about calling the police. He said that Xia ruofei had used violence on him that night and even broke his arm.

Deputy Director Xu had actually seen li Chenggong’s dislocated arm before. However, Xia ruofei had fixed it back for him. He hated scum like li Chenggong to the core. He felt that li Chenggong deserved the pain.

However, li Chenggong had made a big scene, saying that Deputy Director Xu was deliberately covering up for Xia ruofei. After all, there were other people in the special task force, so Deputy Director Xu had no choice but to take li Chenggong to the hospital for an injury examination.

The result was shocking.

Originally, when an arm was dislocated, even if it was reset, it was definitely impossible to recover completely in a short period of time. The condition of the joint could be seen through an x – ray.

However, when li Chenggong went to the hospital for a checkup, there was no injury at all.

Li Chenggong couldn’t believe the result and insisted on changing the hospital for a check – up. He even said that Xia ruofei had not only broken his arm, but had also pressed his acupuncture points and made him mute.

No one in the special task force believed li Chenggong’s words. They thought that he was just acting crazy and speaking incoherently.

Maybe he had more serious problems that he had not explained, so he pretended to be crazy to avoid it!

Therefore, the leader of the special task force increased the investigation of li Chenggong. Although no other major problems were found in the end, li Chenggong’s intentional obstruction of vision and framing of the witness were also regarded as a crime for resisting the investigation, and became a basis for a heavy sentence.

This made li Chenggong want to cry but had no tears.

Little did he know that even if Xia ruofei removed his shoulder joint and put it back on dozens of times, as long as Xia ruofei did not want to, he would not leave any traces of damage.

As for the one who made him unable to make a sound with a touch of his hand, no one would believe him if he told them.

Liu Zhe had told Xia ruofei about this after the incident. Xia ruofei only smiled and did not take it to heart.

The transfer of ownership of Hengli building went very smoothly. Feng Jing was very careful in handling these specific matters and there would be no mistakes. Xia ruofei was also very assured.

The transfer of property rights took some time, but the provincial Power Construction Company had already left, so under the supervision of the state – owned assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the property of these floors was officially handed over to the Paradise company.

On the day of the handover, Xia ruofei also came to the scene.

This was the first time he was checking out his company’s future headquarters on the spot.

Looking at the 15 – story building in front of him, although only the top six floors belonged to paradise Corporation, this was in the city center. Not to mention a six – story office building, even an ordinary residence was an unreachable goal for many people.

Two years ago, Xia ruofei was still a poor veteran. Now, he had such a huge fortune. Even Xia ruofei felt like he was dreaming.

After a simple ceremony was held for the transfer of assets, the Paradise Corporation took over the six floors. As for the water and electricity accounts, they would have to wait until the transfer procedures were completed before they could be transferred.

The reason why Feng Jing took over the building in advance was that she wanted to plan, renovate, and renovate it as soon as possible so that she could move the headquarters over.

After the people who attended the handover ceremony left, Feng Jing and Xia ruofei stood in front of the floor – to – Ceiling window on the 15th floor.

Everything here had been cleared out, and the entire floor looked empty.

Feng Rao was very excited. She smiled at Xia ruofei and said,””Chairman, how is it? Did he feel that the mountains were small? This will be our company’s headquarters in the future!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”this is only the 15th floor. What’s there to see?” Do you think it’s Dubai’s Burj Khalifa?”

“State of mind!” Feng Rao said. I’m talking about the state of mind! Although we only have six floors, this is the company’s first core fixed asset!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Boss Feng, what are you going to do with the six floors? have you decided?”

Feng Rao nodded without hesitation. “I’ve been thinking about this for the past few days. If the company’s headquarters is moved out, we’ll have plenty of space. The General Manager, vice general manager, and administration Department can occupy one floor. The marketing department is relatively large, and in the future, the e – commerce area will continue to be strengthened, so it’s estimated that we’ll use two floors, one for finance and security, and two more floors. The bottom tenth floor will be used for mobility. After the company expands in the future, the overseas business department may have to be an independent Department. They had a special place to work. And the 15th floor of this top floor will naturally be the chairman’s office!”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. He didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”Boss Feng, Are you sure? This floor was 1500 square meters! You made it into a big office?”
