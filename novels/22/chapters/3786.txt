Chapter 3787  Adventures in the North Pole (1)

    Ling Qingxue and Song Wei were no longer newbies with no actual combat experience. After all, they had followed Xia ruofei to the underground palace of the ancient tomb of Mount Yu. In particular, Ling Qingxue and Xia ruofei had explored the mystic Luna realm together. Therefore, after receiving Xia ruofei's voice transmission reminder, the two of them did not show any signs of surprise on their faces. They did not even use their spiritual power to investigate further.

  This was because they absolutely believed in Xia ruofei's investigation results. If they subconsciously released their spiritual power to investigate, they might be overreaching themselves and the other party might notice.

  "Sure!" Song Wei replied without changing her expression. Then let's go down first! Let's see what's going on with this barrier. "

  The three of them slowly lowered their flying swords. Not only were Song Wei and Ling Qingxue's movements a little clumsy, even Xia ruofei pretended that he was not very familiar with it and slowly returned to the ground.

  After the three of them jumped onto the ice, they put away their flying swords, as if they were not prepared for any danger.

  Xia ruofei brought Song Wei and Ling Qingxue to the front of the barrier. They observed and talked about the situation of the barrier as if they were discussing how to break through it.

  In reality, Xia ruofei had already been sending messages to Song Wei and Ling Qingxue.

  At the same time, Xia ruofei's spiritual power had already locked onto the three cultivators who were getting closer, but they did not notice at all. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

  From this point, Xia ruofei could basically judge that even if these three people's cultivation was higher than his, it was probably not much higher. If they were nascent Soul Stage cultivators, even if Chen Nanfeng had just broken through to the early stage of the nascent Soul Stage, even if his spiritual power was not as strong as Xia ruofei 's, if Xia ruofei really used his spiritual power to detect them, he would definitely be able to sense it.

  However, Xia ruofei did not let his guard down. After all, there were three of them and the situation was still unclear.

  Hence, even though he appeared to be unconcerned, in reality, Xia ruofei was already ready to launch his strongest attack at any time.

  In addition, he had asked Song Wei and Ling Qingxue to get as close to the barrier as possible just in case.

  If the other party's strength was beyond his expectations and he could not match it for the time being, he could at least use the mansion - guarding wooden token to open the outer enchantment of the green Immortal Island in an instant and the three of them could hide in the green Immortal Island.

  Although the energy barrier would not last long, Xia ruofei would be able to escape with Song Wei and Ling Qingxue in the black Phoenix flying ship with this precious time.

  As for green travel Immortal Island, he could only stay here for the time being. After all, even if he relied on the mansion - guarding wooden token, it would still take some time to take away the entire Immortal Island.

  Xia ruofei had already analyzed the current situation thoroughly in just a few short breaths.
