2670 Initial screening (1)

This time, Xia ruofei did not inform anyone but Liu Qingfeng about his arrival at the Peach Blossom Island. He even strictly ordered him to keep it a secret. The purpose was naturally to prevent the possible existence of a mole from leaking the news.

Xia ruofei had taken Peach Blossom Island from the Liu family, and the fact that the star Seizer sect had found the courtyard in liuhai Lane in the capital in such a short time meant that someone must have informed them.

On the way to the airport in the morning, Xia ruofei had called Liu Qunfeng to ask about it. As he had expected, when the Liu family was still in control of the island called green cloud Island, someone had asked them to buy the island and had kept raising the price. However, old man Liu valued green cloud Island very much and did not care about it.

Therefore, Xia ruofei had a basic judgment. The star Seizer sect had already set their eyes on peach source Island before he had obtained it. They had only been using secular methods, hoping to buy the island in a low – Key manner. After he had obtained ownership of the Peach Blossom Island, the star Seizer sect had still used the same method.

The other party wanted to keep a low profile. Xia ruofei could roughly guess that their purpose was to not make too much of a commotion so that other cultivation sects would not notice.

To Xia ruofei, this was an advantage. He could use some methods to stall for time.

The fact that the star Seizer sect was able to so quickly learn of the island’s change in ownership meant that someone within the island had definitely informed them. This was a very high possibility.

Liu Qingfeng was a core member of the Liu family. Under normal circumstances, he would not be the mole. Moreover, Xia ruofei needed Liu Qingfeng’s cooperation in many aspects when he was doing things on peach source Island, so he could only assume that Liu Qingfeng was clean.

The first thing he did when he arrived at the peach source Island was to identify the mole.

Otherwise, the various arrangements he had made on the peach source Island would all be leaked by the mole. The star Seizer sect also had a formation master named Zheng Yongshou, who might be able to deduce that he was setting up a formation from the limited information.

If that was the case, the star Seizer sect would definitely lose their patience.

By that time, Xia ruofei would not be in position. How could he resist a golden elixir realm master like Luo Qingfeng?

Hence, Xia ruofei made a list of all the middle managers who were still on Peach Blossom Island.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei’s memory was superb. He had only met these people once or twice, but he remembered their names, looks, and the scope of their work. Then, according to his own analysis and judgment, he roughly ranked them according to the degree of suspicion. The most suspicious ones were naturally the first to be screened.

After all, although he had concealed the news that he had come to Paradise Island, the island was only so big. Although paradise had landed under the cover of night, it would definitely be noticed by people with ulterior motives. With a little analysis, it was not difficult to determine that he had come to the island.

Xia ruofei got into Liu Qingfeng’s car and drove towards the only high – rise building on the island, the project department building. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

On the way, Xia ruofei had first screened Liu Qingfeng.

Liu Qingfeng had brought a bullet – proof Mercedes – Benz. After Xia ruofei got into the car, he asked the driver to raise the partition that isolated sound and vision on the grounds that he had to discuss important things with Liu Qingfeng.

Immediately after, Liu Qingfeng fell into a state of hypnosis in an instant.

Xia ruofei’s question was simple.”Did you tell anyone that I obtained Paradise Island?”

Xia ruofei was satisfied with Liu Qingfeng’s answer, even though he was completely defenseless.

“The family has a strict order,” he said.”It’s forbidden to disclose this matter to anyone. I didn’t tell anyone, including my wife.”

After Xia ruofei got the answer, he immediately removed the hypnosis. Through some simple methods, Liu Qingfeng would not remember what happened in these few seconds. For him, it was just like being stunned.

Xia ruofei didn’t need to ask any more questions, nor did he need to test Liu Qingfeng’s loyalty. Liu Qingfeng was originally loyal to the Liu family, and it was only a short – term cooperation with him. With old master Liu’s personal instructions, Liu Qingfeng would definitely do his best during this time.

That was enough.

Seeing that Liu Qingfeng was out of the hypnosis state, Xia ruofei immediately said,””In about five hours, a transport plane will land on Peach Blossom Island. I’ll send you the details later, and you can ask the airport to prepare in advance.”

“Yes, Mr. Xia!” Liu Qingfeng quickly responded.

He didn’t know why he was suddenly in a daze, but fortunately, he didn’t delay his conversation with Mr. Xia.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and continued,””When I’m talking to someone later, arrange for reliable people to monitor the rest. If any of them make any strange moves, especially if they try to contact the outside world, then decisively control them!”

“Alright! Mr. Xia!” Liu Qingfeng replied, and then he hesitated for a moment,”Mr. Xia, is there a problem with our people?”

“It’s just a suspicion for now,” Xia ruofei said indifferently.”Someone leaked the ownership of Peach Blossom Island. Some people even found my home in the capital ...”

“There’s actually such a thing ...” Liu Qingfeng was also very surprised.

He had nothing to say about Xia ruofei’s arrangement. Although many people on the island knew that Peach Blossom Island had changed hands, only a few middle managers could know the exact situation.

Xia ruofei did not say a word along the way. He just leaned back in his seat and closed his eyes to rest. In fact, his mind was spinning fast. He was thinking about every step of the cultivation. The sect’s strength was too terrifying. He had to make sure that there were no mistakes in every step. Otherwise, he might not be able to protect Paradise Island and might even be in danger of his life.

The car drove into the underground parking lot of the building in the night. Xia ruofei and Liu Qingfeng did not alarm anyone and took the elevator directly to the floor of Liu Qingfeng’s office.

Xia ruofei walked into the office and turned to ask,””Has everyone been gathered?”

“Everyone’s here. “Liu Qingfeng nodded and said,” I just informed everyone that there’s a middle – rank meeting, so everyone is in the conference room now. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”let’s start!” Pay attention to monitoring and don’t alert others, and don’t cause unnecessary panic. ”

“Understood!” Liu Qingfeng replied.

Xia ruofei walked into the office calmly and sat down on the guest sofa.

Liu Qingfeng, on the other hand, calmed his mind. First, he arranged a few guards, and at the same time, he ordered two confidants to keep an eye on the monitoring of the conference room.

After that, he took a deep breath and walked into the meeting room on the other side of the floor.
