Chapter 771: Nowhere to hide (3)

“Mark out the area immediately and send people to investigate!” Deputy bureau chief Lu said immediately.

“Yes!” The police officer in charge of the technical department said.

The distribution of surveillance cameras in the urban – rural junction was not as dense as the urban area, and there were some blind spots. Soon, the system marked out several areas nearby according to the last location of the van Truck.

The truck could only have been parked in one of those areas, otherwise it would have been captured by other cameras.

A large number of police officers were dispatched.

“Squad leader Xia, do you want to take little black with you and follow the police?” Tian Feilong asked.

Xia ruofei said,”I feel that even if we find the truck, the possibility of getting any more clues is low. However, we still have to go.”

After he finished speaking, Xia ruofei turned his gaze to Guo Zhan.

Guo Zhengzhi thought for a while and nodded slightly.

Soon, Xia ruofei and Tian Feilong boarded a police car with xiaohei and headed to the designated areas for investigation.

Guo Zhan was in charge of the command center of the Public Security Bureau.

With the Skynet system’s help in analysis, the scope of investigation was not large, and there was no doubt that they would find the car. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

As expected, before Xia ruofei’s car arrived at the destination, another team’s message came through the walkie – talkie, saying that ran ran and the others had found the van.

......

Hence, Xia ruofei’s team immediately changed their route and headed straight for the cargo van.

This was an abandoned mechanical processing plant in the northern suburbs of the city. The white van was parked in the overgrown yard of the factory.

This area was a blind spot for the surveillance cameras.

Once Xia ruofei got out of the car, he immediately ran to the cargo van with xiaohei. The police had already received orders to cooperate with them, so they did not stop Xia ruofei and xiaohei.

After opening the trunk, Xia ruofei patted Blackie’s head. Blackie jumped up like lightning.

It sniffed around the interior of the car. Xia ruofei asked,””Little black, is there the smell you smelled in the car?”

Little black immediately barked twice, then nodded very humanly.

Although it was confirmed that the group of people had used the car to sneak into the campus and kidnapped professor Liang, Xia ruofei was still a little excited after getting the confirmation from Blackie.

He was 100% sure now!

Xia ruofei quickly waved at Blackie, signaling for him to get off the car.

“Xiao hei, can you sniff around here and see if you can find the smell from earlier?” Xia ruofei said.

Blackie immediately sniffed around the cargo van. After a while, it shook its head at Xia ruofei in frustration.

The police were also very surprised by Black’s understanding of human nature, but their attention was more focused on finding clues.

Seeing that black didn’t find any clues, officer Wang, who was leading the team, couldn’t help but ask,””Do you need us to get a police dog?”

“Little black is much better than a police dog,” said Tian Feilong with a smile. Yesterday, the police dogs of the SWAT team didn’t find any clues, but today, black had dug out this clue! So, it’s useless even if you send the police dogs over. ”

“Then how could there be no smell left behind?” Officer Wang said in confusion,”there’s still a residual smell in the car!”

Xia ruofei and Tian Feilong looked at each other and said in unison,””They’ve changed cars!”

“Let’s go!”Xia ruofei said. Let’s return to the command center!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”officer Wang, please leave a few comrades to check this car and see if there are any clues left!” Feilong, contact Wolf King with the secret phone immediately and ask the comrades in the command center to use the Skynet system to carry out an in – depth analysis. Find out which blind spots along the way are in chronological order and see which blind spots will allow them to switch cars easily!”

“Understood!” Officer Wang and Tian Feilong said at the same time.

Xia ruofei looked at the cargo truck and said,””Let’s go! Since we’ve caught this clue, they won’t be able to escape!”
