2417 Witness it with your own eyes_Chapter 1334: the first Prince!

Xia ruofei sat in the car without saying a word. Wu Qiang did not ask much and just sat quietly in the driver’s seat.

With Xia ruofei’s spiritual power, he could see everything in the Liu family courtyard.

He could “see” Liu Qunfeng walking around like a trapped beast under the watch of Liu Yong and Liu Chuang. There were a few times when he wanted to rush out, but he was stopped by Liu Yong and Liu Chuang.

Liu Qunfeng’s face was full of fear. He could already feel his father’s killing intent. If he couldn’t do anything, then Liu haojun would really be doomed.

As a father, how could Liu Qunfeng take such a blow?

From this, it could be seen that old master Liu was truly a formidable figure. Compared to the interests of the family, or to be more precise, the survival of the family, the affection of ordinary people was nothing in his eyes.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power also detected that old man Liu was slowly getting out of bed. He walked unsteadily to the window and looked into the distance.

He continued to probe with his spiritual power without making a sound.

In the Liu family’s courtyard.

About twenty minutes after Liu Qunfeng was taken away by Liu Yong and Liu Chuang, a black Audi drove into the courtyard. A middle – aged man in a beige Tang suit hurried into the building.

Throughout the entire process, Xia ruofei patiently sat in the car and kept a close watch on her with his spiritual power.

The middle – aged man in the Tang suit quickly arrived at elder Liu’s room.

Liu Kuan knocked on the door and walked in, then said softly,””Master, Liu Feng has arrived.”

Old man Liu slowly turned around and said,””Let him in!”

“Yes!”

After Liu Kuan finished speaking, he stepped aside and made a gesture of invitation.

The middle – aged man in the Tang suit strode in and stopped a few meters away from old master Liu. He bowed respectfully to old master Liu and said,””Third great uncle, you were looking for me?”

“Oh,” old man Liu said and slowly walked to the bed. Liu Feng quickly stepped forward and helped old man Liu to sit down by the bed. He covered him with the quilt and then stood aside respectfully with his hands down.

Old man Liu said in a low voice,””Xiao Feng, go to xiabei province and help me kill someone ...”

Liu Feng nodded without thinking,””Yes! Third great uncle, who is the target?”

“Liu haojun,” Old man Liu said expressionlessly.

Liu Feng couldn’t help but tremble with a look of disbelief on his face. He couldn’t help but take a step back and then cried out,”Third great uncle! You ...”

The muscles on old man Liu’s face twitched a few times before he said,””You didn’t hear wrong, and I’m not crazy ... Your mission target this time is my grandson, Liu haojun. Do you understand?”

“I heard you clearly!” Liu Feng subconsciously replied, then immediately waved his hand and said,”no, no, no... Third great uncle, what did haojun do wrong? You can teach him a good lesson! But ... But ... But there’s no need to ... Kill him!”

This was simply too shocking. Even now, Liu Feng could not believe that those words had really come out of old man Liu’s mouth.

Elder Liu didn’t answer Liu Feng’s question. He looked out of the window and the scene of the negotiation with elder song appeared in his mind.

In fact, there were only Master Song and master Liu in the room. Liu Qunfeng had only seen the evidence that Master Song had asked Liao Jun to show, and then master Liu had asked him to wait at the door. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Of course, someone had been watching over Liu Qunfeng since then.

The negotiation between the two of them was still fresh in old man Liu’s mind.

After seeing the evidence, old man Liu was a little flustered. At the same time, he realized that this was the biggest crisis for the Liu family.

Old Liu didn’t haggle over the conditions that elder song had proposed. He quickly agreed to them.

“Old Liu, there’s one last condition. Liu haojun can’t be kept ...” Elder song said.

“You’re talking nonsense!” Old master Liu was furious.”Old song, don’t push your luck!”

Elder song looked at elder Liu calmly and said,””You know it very well. You don’t have to look angry. That can’t hide your inner thoughts at all.”

Old man Liu snorted and said,””This condition is too much. I can’t agree to it! He’s the eldest grandson of my Liu family!”

“Song Qiming is my most valued junior!” Elder song raised his voice.”What? Liu haojun’s status was higher than song Qiming? Qiming can die, but Liu haojun can ‘t?”

“Isn’t song Qiming fine?” Old man Liu said vaguely.

“Hahaha! You call that fine?” Elder song laughed coldly.”If it wasn’t for RUO Fei, Qiming would have been dead by now! Moreover, he was severely injured. Whether he could recover and how long he would need to recover, everything was unknown! They should pay the price for doing such an appalling thing! Or ... Is this the Liu family’s will, and Liu haojun is just a chess piece that you pushed out?”

“Don’t you slander me!” Old master Liu quickly said,”you know very well what the truth is! Why drag our entire family into this? Old song, haojun has indeed made a huge mistake this time. He can not be forgiven! But ... Couldn’t he just let him live? We can immediately send him overseas! She would never let him return to the country! And by limiting his account, he will never do such a thing again!”
