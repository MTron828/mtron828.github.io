Chapter 383: The opening of the winery (3)

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”uncle Ling, you should be running out of the nutrient solution from last time, right?” I’ve brought you another bottle this time. ”

“That’s great,” Ling Xiaotian said hurriedly.”I forgot to tell you about this when I called. I didn’t expect you to be so meticulous and still bring it over.”

Xia ruofei took out the bottle of diluted flower petal solution from his satchel and handed it to Ling Xiaotian. Ling Xiaotian took it as if he had obtained a treasure and then directly locked it in the safe.

During this time, he had witnessed the magical power of this “nutrient solution.” Once the red Arowana lost their energy, they would immediately become active after a little drop was dropped into the fish tank. It was even more effective than stimulants.

After talking about the Blood Red Dragon, Ling Xiaotian naturally brought up the wine factory.

“RUO Fei! Now, the winery’s acquisition procedures have been completed. ” Ling Xiaotian said,”I’m planning to build a new factory and bring in new production equipment. The old production equipment has no intention of stopping production for the time being, so the liquor of the Drunken Eight Immortals is still in constant supply. In addition to the stock we have, the most urgent thing for us now is not to build a new factory or bring in new equipment, but to process and improve the existing liquor!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The reason why Ling Xiaotian had bought this winery was because of Xia ruofei’s improvement technique. Otherwise, with the quality of the previous Drunken Eight Immortals, although some of the old third Hillmen liked it very much, it was not enough to have a broad market prospects and could not attract him to buy it.

However, after Xia ruofei’s modification, it was different. Ling Xiaotian could be considered an expert in wine country. After drinking the Drunken Eight Immortals provided by Xia ruofei once, he knew that this wine would definitely be popular on the market.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Uncle Ling, I don’t have any problems. We can proceed at any time.”

He thought for a moment and said,”however, the process of processing and improvement may take some time, and it can’t be done in the winery. We have to transport the finished wine out in large vats first, and after we finish the improvement, we will transport it back to bottle it. The process is relatively more troublesome, but it is also requested by my friend.”

Xia ruofei had always said that the improved formula of the eight Drunken Immortals was shared by him and his imaginary friend. Therefore, he naturally used his friend as an excuse.

This was because his so – called improved processing was actually storing the white wine in the original space. Through the rich spirit Qi environment and the unique time flow difference, the quality of the white wine could be changed. Therefore, it definitely could not be carried out in the winery.

Ling Xiaotian nodded his head to show his understanding. He then asked,””How long will this process take?”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”at least a month!” Of course, the longer the time, the better the quality of the wine. ”

“That’s for sure. ” Ling Xiaotian nodded and said.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”uncle Ling, this is what I’m thinking. From now on, the winery will stop selling the old Drunken Eight Immortals wine. We will try to recover the funds from all major channels as much as possible. We will immediately start the development of the new wine.”

“I also have the same intention!” Ling Xiaotian said. He then asked,”ruofei, how much wine can you guys handle at most?”

Xia ruofei calculated in his heart and said,””Under extreme conditions, a hundred tons a month is not a problem.”

A hundred tons of wine might sound like a lot, but if one were to use those big wine jars that weighed five hundred catties, it would only be around four hundred jars. Although the original space was not very big, it was definitely enough to fit them all. Besides, Xia ruofei did not need to place the wine jars on the ground. They could be stacked together.

If he was worried that the wine jar would be too heavy, he could just order some steel frames that were more stable.

Ling Xiaotian said happily,”there’s only about 80 to 90 tons of wine in the factory, so there shouldn’t be a problem!” We’ll transport them all out at once to improve and process them!”

He thought for a moment and said,” 100 tons a month, that’s 1200 tons a year. That’s about the annual output of a small or medium – sized winery.” Ruofei, can you increase the production in the future?”

Ling Xiaotian had considered that if the market response for the Drunken Eight Immortals was good, they would definitely increase the production. In that case, 1200 tons a year would not be enough.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”uncle Ling, it’s possible to increase the production, but there’s a limit to it. However, I personally think 1200 tons is enough. From now on, we have to go for the high – Quality products. The rarer something is, the more expensive it is!”

Xia ruofei paused and continued,”for example, for the 80 to 90 tons of wine, we can improve a batch of Drunken Eight Immortals, which can be sold in about a month. Then, we can leave a portion to make better quality wine. If you give me two months, three months, or even longer, the wine produced will be much better than the Maotai Wuliangye. Think about it. Can we set a low price for such wine? Quantity has never been the key to winning such high – end liquor. ”

As Ling Xiaotian listened to Xia ruofei’s words, his eyes brightened. It was obvious that he had already agreed with Xia ruofei’s point of view.

“Alright! Let’s set the monthly production at 100 tons!” Ling Xiaotian said straightforwardly and then asked,”ruofei, How do I hand over the wine? Are you going to ship it directly to your farm?”
