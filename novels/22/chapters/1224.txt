“I don’t care about that!” Ye linyun replied nonchalantly. Brother Xia, if that’s the case, I’m willing to!”

“I knew you’d be willing!” Xia ruofei smiled.

It was Xia ruofei’s sudden idea to let ye Lingyun learn how to make tea, and ye Lingyun only followed Xia ruofei’s orders.

However, ye Lingyun had been with old Mr. Li Zhifu for several months. Old Mr. Li treated him as his own and taught him all his skills without reservation. In the process, ye Lingyun gradually fell in love with the tea – making industry and enjoyed the sense of achievement brought by the process.

Ye linyun chuckled and scratched his head.

Xia ruofei said,”there’s no hurry. We’ll adjust after the new year.” However, during this period of time, you can consider a suitable candidate to replace the head of security. If necessary, you can secretly observe those veterans. ”

“Understood!” Ye Lingyun said, puffing out his chest.

After returning to the farm, ye Lingyun brought a few veterans to start a new round of tea – making, while Xia ruofei returned to his small villa.

Xia ruofei finally contacted MA Xiong after two days.

When MA Xiong received Xia ruofei’s call, he knew that the matter was basically settled. There was a trace of joy in his voice.””Xia Sheng, is there any progress with the truffle?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”haha!” I didn’t fail you!”

“That’s great!” MA Xiong couldn’t help but slap his thigh and asked excitedly,”xiasheng, how’s the quality of this season’s truffles? How much is the production?”

“Mr. MA, there’s no need to doubt the quality of the products from the Paradise Corporation,” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

MA Xiong was stunned for a moment before he chuckled. “That’s true ...”

Xia ruofei continued.”You don’t have to worry about the quantity. It will definitely exceed your expectations!”

“Oh?” MA Xiong’s interest was immediately piqued. He asked,”xiasheng, can you tell me more about it?”

“Of course!” Xia ruofei laughed.

The auction needed to be warmed up in the preparation stage. Some information might be disclosed on the day of the auction, but it was impossible to keep everything a secret from MA Xiong.

“We can provide about 90 kilograms of truffles for the auction this time. Most of them are white truffles, and about ... Black truffles,” Xia ruofei said.

“What?” Before Xia ruofei could finish, he was interrupted by MA Xiong’s shocked voice.”Xia Sheng, did I hear you wrong? You mean ... 90 ... Kg? And it’s mainly white truffle?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”of course!” Old Mr. MA. ”

“This ...” MA Xiong was in disbelief.”Xia Sheng, this is unbelievable ...”

In a good year, the entire world only produced about 3 tons of white truffle.

It sounded like three tons was dozens of times more than 90 kilograms, but that was the weight of all the White truffles produced in all the production areas in the world combined. Furthermore, it was in a year with a good harvest, which spanned several months of production.

The truffle – picking season had just begun, and Xia ruofei had managed to gather 90 kilograms in just a few days. Even if he only had half of the White truffle, it was still 45 kilograms!

Furthermore, Xia ruofei had said that white truffle was the majority of the 90kg.

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”old Mr. MA, do you need to take a break?” I’m worried that your heart won’t be able to take it. I’m so far away, so I won’t be able to save you in time ...”

MA Xiong laughed out loud and said in a self – deprecating manner,”The older I get, the more impatient I become ... But, Xia Sheng, you’ve really given me a big surprise! Xia Sheng, continue! I’m already mentally prepared. ”

“Yes, old Mr. MA.” Xia ruofei said,”in this batch of truffles, the White truffle is about 55 kilograms. But that’s not the main point ...”

At this point, Xia ruofei kept her in suspense and paused.

“Oh?” MA Xiong asked. Then what’s the news that’s even more shocking?”

“Mr. MA,” Xia ruofei said with a smile,”my truffles are usually heavy. It’s perfect for an auction!”

MA Xiong’s spirits were suddenly lifted. At the truffle auction at the beginning of the year, Xia ruofei had brought out a piece of white truffle that had broken the world record and was sold for a sky – High price of 1.25 million US dollars. MA Xiong was there at the time and had a deep impression of it.

“Can you break the record set at the beginning of the year?” he quickly asked.

Xia ruofei smiled and said in a relaxed manner,””That’s for sure! And I can tell you that the record this time will be greatly improved. ”

Xia ruofei could hear MA Xiong’s heavy breathing on the other end of the phone. He could not help but worry if the old man’s heart could take it.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Mr. MA, I’ll keep you in suspense for the specific data. Next, I’ll let our company’s director Feng take charge of this matter. She will send you the detailed data. In short, we will definitely earn both fame and fortune at this auction!”

“Good, good, good!” MA Xiong said,”xiasheng, it’s really not a bad idea to work with you!”

Xia ruofei continued to ask,”Mr. MA, I would like to confirm the location of the auction with you. I have discussed it with my colleagues in the company. We think it is more appropriate to place it in Hong Kong. After all, our abalone auction was very successful last time!”

“Sure, I agree!” MA Xiong said without much hesitation.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”it’s decided for now. I’ll ask chief Feng to communicate the details to the Hengfeng auction house.” By the way, Mr. MA, I hope you can invite as many socialites and influential people in the industry as possible. It would be best if the famous truffle families in France and Italy could send people. ”

“Alright. Since you have such a good item in your hands, we’ll definitely do our best to promote it. The bigger the influence, the better!” Said Ma Xiong. Don’t worry, I’ll take care of the guests!”

“That’s great!” Xia ruofei said happily,”Mr. MA, I hope we have a happy cooperation! Truffle’s delivery season is still long ...”

MA Xiong was experienced and immediately understood the underlying meaning. He quickly asked,”Xia Sheng, you’re saying that ... This truffle auction can be held more than once?”

“If nothing unexpected happens, I can get more truffles.” Xia ruofei did not hide anything and said directly,”but this time ... I think 90 kilograms of top – grade truffle is enough.”

MA Xiong was overjoyed and said,”Right, right, right, things are precious when they are rare! Xia Sheng, I’ll make a reservation with you first! As long as there’s truffles being auctioned, you must have priority in cooperating with our Hengfeng auction house!”

Xia ruofei laughed.”Of course! It’s always been a pleasure to work with you!”

MA Xiong also laughed out loud.

After discussing the general direction with MA Xiong, Xia ruofei hung up the phone and told Feng Jing that the negotiations were successful. He asked her to communicate and coordinate with the Hengfeng auction house in a day or two. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The person of contact was still the General Manager of the Hengfeng auction house, Dong Jiajun, who was urging Xia ruofei to do something. MA Xiong had to send his most capable person to follow up.

Xia ruofei made a table with the specific data of this batch of truffles. He also took many photos of the truffles with a single – lens reflex camera and sent them to Feng Jing by email.

The auction house had to come up with a plan to warm up and promote the items according to the situation. They also had to design some promotional posters and advertisements. Xia ruofei had provided some essential materials.

This time, MA Xiong didn’t even send anyone to check the quality of the truffle. He had a blind trust in Xia ruofei. Of course, this was built on their successful cooperation.

The preparations for the auction were going on in an orderly manner. The time was set to be two weeks later at the Hengfeng Jiahua Hotel in Hong Kong.

The Hengfeng auction house’s official website had been hyping up for a long time, and all sorts of promotional activities were being carried out in an orderly manner. Feng Jing hadn’t gone to Hong Kong yet, so she was mainly communicating with Dong Jiajun through email and phone calls.

Xia ruofei also began to make preparations to go to the port. However, at this juncture, Xia Qing, who was in the spirit map space, took the initiative to contact Xia ruofei through divine sense, which was a rare thing ...
