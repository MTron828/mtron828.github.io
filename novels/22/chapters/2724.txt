2725 Great trickery (2)

“Yes! Thank you, master!” Zheng Yongshou said excitedly.

He had laid out so much so that Luo Qingfeng would take the initiative to bring him along.

Although in theory, he had to accompany Luo Qingfeng and lead the way for him, he could not rule out the possibility that Luo Qingfeng would go by himself after asking for the location. After all, golden core cultivators could ride flying swords, and it was more convenient for them to travel alone.

Now that Luo Qingfeng had taken the initiative to bring him along, he had achieved his goal.

“Teacher, after disciple and martial nephew Boshan took over the peach source Island, we dismissed everyone on the island. Now, only martial nephew Boshan is staying on the island, waiting for your arrival.” Zheng Yongshou continued.

“Mm! You guys have done well. ” Luo Qingfeng said,”those ordinary people are a hindrance on the island. It’s better to disband them.” In the future, when the island needs to be built, we’ll just recruit more people. The most important thing now is to activate the formation. ”

Luo Qingfeng’s thoughts were in line with Xia ruofei ‘s. Unfortunately, his wish could never be realized because Xia ruofei had already activated the Taixu xuanqing formation completely.

“Yes! Master!” “Yes,” Zheng Yongshou replied, then continued,”I brought martial nephew Boshan to survey the Paradise Island carefully, and we did find something ...”

“Oh?” Luo Qingfeng asked with interest,”could it be that you can see through such a large array?”

“That’s not it ...” Zheng Yongshou said hurriedly,”it’s just that I still saw some clues and wanted to report it to master.”

“Oh? Then tell me. ” Luo Qingfeng was also interested and said with a smile.

“Yes!” Zheng Yongshou said. He secretly took a deep breath and said according to what Xia ruofei had taught him,”I found out that the array on this Paradise Island is not just a natural array. I didn’t investigate it in detail before, but this time, after handing over the island, this disciple walked around the entire Peach Blossom Island and found many traces left by cultivators, but they were all very old. This disciple surmised that this Island once had ancient cultivators. Perhaps it was because of the island’s natural formation that the ancient cultivators were attracted to it. They had also successfully activated the formation, but with the passage of time, no one maintained it and it lost its effectiveness. Only the naturally formed parts can still be seen. ”

Luo Qingfeng’s eyes shot out two rays of light as he said,””In that case, it does make sense! If ancient cultivators once lived on this Island, and there are traces of an artificially activated formation, then we’ll have even more clues. This way, the difficulty of activating this natural formation will be greatly reduced!”

The more Luo Qingfeng spoke, the more excited he became. He then asked,””Yongshou, did you find anything else other than these?”

Zheng Yongshou lowered his head and said,”master, I found spiritual energy gathered in a place that was suspected to be left behind by ancient cultivators. After excavating it, I found this item about three feet deep ...”

With that, Zheng Yongshou took out the small box that Xia ruofei had prepared for him and threw out the last stun grenade.

Zheng Yongshou handed the small box to Qingfeng Luo with both hands as he said,””Master, this disciple is slow – witted and doesn’t know what this is. However, this item is rich in spiritual energy and it can be seen that it is not an ordinary item. Therefore, this disciple doesn’t dare to hide it and will immediately bring it back to the sect for master to deal with.”

Qingfeng Luo nodded and opened the box.

His eyes suddenly opened, and an inexplicable look of surprise appeared on his face. He saw that there was a spirit crystal in the box, which was emitting a strong spirit Qi.

Qingfeng Luo held the spirit crystal in his hand and felt the spirit energy within it. He found that more than half of the spirit energy contained in the spirit crystal had been consumed. However, it was still a rare cultivation treasure for the current cultivation world on earth.

“This thing ... You found it on that Island?” “What?” Qingfeng Luo asked in disbelief.

“Yes, master!” Zheng Yongshou said,”there are many similar ancient cultivator ruins on the island, and there are many places where spiritual energy is concentrated. However, I know that this is a serious matter, so I didn’t continue to excavate and immediately rushed back to the sect to ask master to make a decision! Martial nephew Boshan will guard the Peach Blossom Island well. Almost no cultivators will go there, and the ordinary people of the secular world will not be able to threaten the safety of the island. ”

“You’ve done well!” Luo Qingfeng said with satisfaction,”what’s even more remarkable is that you can only think of the sect and not have the slightest greed in the face of a cultivation treasure with such rich spirit energy. I am very pleased!”

This was actually a spiritual crystal that Xia ruofei had prepared in advance. He had even specially chosen a spiritual crystal that he had used during his cultivation. He had been using this spirit crystal all along. Later, when he got better origin crystals, he changed to origin crystals, so he had already absorbed a lot of the spiritual Qi in the spirit crystal.

Not only did Luo Qingfeng not doubt it, but he was even more convinced.

The reason was simple. After so many years, the array on the Peach Blossom Island had lost its ability to gather spiritual energy, and the spiritual energy in the spiritual crystal had gradually dissipated. This was in line with the actual situation. If it was a spiritual crystal full of spiritual energy, it would cause Luo Qingfeng to be suspicious.

Qingfeng Luo was very satisfied with Zheng Yongshou’s disciple. Although he wanted to generously give the spirit crystal to Zheng Yongshou, the spirit crystal was too precious. After hesitating for a long time, he did not give it up.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m
