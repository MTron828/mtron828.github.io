Chapter 288: Gunshots in the small town (1)

Xia ruofei saw that song Rui’s face had turned pale and couldn’t help but laugh.”Yo! What’s wrong?” As he spoke, he stood up and walked to the window to take a look. He immediately frowned, and his eyes revealed a sharp light. He saw that there were more than a hundred Men in Black on the street, surrounding the door of the shop. These people were holding steel pipes and even machetes in their hands. They all looked fierce, and several of them were smashing the rolled – up Curtain Door downstairs with steel pipes. Xia ruofei’s expression changed.””Chief, there are a lot of people outside. The situation is a little complicated. For your safety, I suggest you evacuate first!” “Uncle Niu, do you have a back door here?” Xia ruofei asked immediately. “Yes, yes, yes!” Niu Yusheng hurriedly said,”young man, quickly escort the Bureau chief out from the back door!” Unexpectedly, eccentric song snorted and said,””I’m not leaving!” “Chief!” “Grandpa!” Xia ruofei, song Rui, and manager Lu couldn’t help but shout. “Xiao Xia, I can’t leave!” Elder song said calmly. We’re leaving, what about brother Fu?” “Then let’s go together!” Xia ruofei made a prompt decision.”We’ll settle the score with them later!” At this moment, Li Guizhi came up the stairs with a pale face.””The back door is also blocked! We’re surrounded by people now, we can’t get out ...” Xia ruofei’s expression turned ugly. If it was just him, he would be able to escape safely even if there were twice the number of people. However, there were two old men and song Rui and the others. Other than himself, they had no other combat power. There were more than a hundred people outside, armed with weapons. No matter how good Xia ruofei was, he couldn’t fight against so many people. If a conflict broke out, it would be difficult for him to protect elder song in such a chaotic situation. The sound of knocking on the door was getting louder and louder. Xia ruofei knew that the rolling curtain Door would not last long. He pondered for a moment and made a prompt decision,””Go! Everyone, go downstairs!” The group of people followed Xia ruofei to the shop on the first floor. Xia ruofei took a look and realized that the back door was made of metal and looked quite secure. Moreover, those people were mainly focused on the front door, and there were only a few people guarding the back door. There was no movement at the back door. Hence, Xia ruofei said,”uncle Niu, you and Xiao Rui will guard the back door. If anything happens, you must inform me immediately. If they really want to smash the door, you must try your best to block them!” “Alright, don’t worry!” Niu Yusheng said. Niu Yusheng and song Rui stood guard at the back door while Xia ruofei brought elder Song, Li Zhifu, manager Lu, and Li Guizhi to the shop. Xia ruofei asked Li Guizhi to find a stool for the two old men to sit down. Elder song and Li Zhifu still looked very calm. The two old men seemed to have the spirit of not changing their expressions even if Mount Tai collapsed in front of them. Of course, as a man who had been through mountains of corpses and seas of blood all his life, he wasn’t afraid of such a small battle. Li Zhifu’s life was full of ups and downs. He had also experienced the era of bandits. At his age, he was naturally not timid. Xia ruofei asked Li Guizhi to take care of the two elders and then said to manager Lu,””Manager Lu, immediately call Xu Wu and Huang Fang and ask them to come over for reinforcements. Also, immediately inform the local government! This group of people is really lawless. I don’t think this matter can be settled peacefully today!” Manager Lu’s face was also livid. He didn’t expect that someone in the local area would be so rampant. They didn’t care about the law at all. He looked at elder song and saw that elder song had no intention to object. He immediately said,””Alright! I’ll make the call immediately!” After Xia ruofei was done with the arrangements, he walked to the shop’s rolled – up Curtain Door. He knew that hiding in here was not a good idea. This group of people was extremely daring. Now that they had already started to smash the door, they would break in sooner or later. Elder song looked at Xia ruofei and said,””Little Xia, be careful!” Xia ruofei turned around and smiled.””Don’t worry, chief!” A cold light flashed in Xia ruofei’s eyes as he finished speaking. He skillfully pulled out a Type 92 pistol from the holster under his arm, loaded the bullet with a click, and strode towards the store. This bunch of lawless people dared to surround one of the core members of the organization, elder song. Even if they killed a few of them, it would be for nothing. Just then, Xia ruofei heard the commotion outside getting louder. “Brat, hurry up and obediently come out on your own!” “We won’t be so polite when we smash the door open!” “Those who dare to hit brother de’s people are really looking for death in the toilet!” Xia ruofei said lazily,”what are you shouting for?” It called for his soul! Your Grandpa is coming out!” Xia ruofei unlocked the door on the roller shutter and dashed out. He then quickly locked the door again. Li Zhifu watched as Xia ruofei rushed out alone. He couldn’t help but worry,””Little song, this young man ...” “Brother Fu, don’t worry!” Elder song smiled calmly. He’ll be fine!” Manager Lu walked over and said respectfully,””Chief, I’ve already contacted the relevant responsible comrades in the southeast province. The local government of Mount Wuyi should be making an emergency response immediately. In addition, Xu Wu and Huang Fang are also rushing over as soon as possible!” Elder song nodded slightly, indicating that he understood. Outside. Xia ruofei walked out of the shop and saw that the street was filled with big Men in Black suits, all looking at him fiercely. In the middle was a middle – aged man in a rice – colored Tang suit. He was like a moon surrounded by stars. One look and you could tell that he was the leader of this group. This middle – aged man was Wu De. When he saw Xia ruofei coming out of the shop, he squinted at him and asked,””Is it him?” Beside Wu De stood a Lackey with a bloody nose and a swollen face. He was one of the hooligans that Xia ruofei had taught a lesson to in the afternoon. He immediately said,”brother de, it’s him!” He’s the one who hit us!” Wu De’s eyes flashed fiercely. He raised the cigar in his hand and pointed at Xia ruofei. He said lightly,””Break both his hands first!” “Yes!” The black – robed men responded loudly. Then, more than a dozen people grabbed steel pipes and looked at Xia ruofei with ill intentions. They surrounded him step by step. Xia ruofei’s face revealed a mocking smile. He slowly raised his hand and raised the gun. He said in a relaxed manner,””If you’re not afraid of death, then come up and try.” The Men in Black then saw that Xia ruofei had a gun in his hand. They were so scared that they stopped in their tracks and looked hesitant. Wu De could not help but raise his eyebrows and stare at the gun in Xia ruofei’s hand. After a moment, he revealed a mocking smile.””Little friend, you can’t possibly think that you can scare people with a toy gun, right? Do you really think we’re scared of you?” Wu De’s underlings also came back to their senses and ridiculed him one after another. “It’s a toy gun! Fortunately, brother de’s eyes are sharp!” “You don’t say, this toy gun is quite realistic!” “Hehe, it’s a pity that this kid met brother de. Ordinary people might really be intimidated by him!” When the Men in Black heard this, they felt relieved. They thought it was impossible. Gun control in China was very strict. How could this young man take out a gun so easily? Unless he was a Desperado, but even so, he wouldn’t dare to pull out a gun in public! Thinking of this, the Men in Black flew into a rage out of humiliation. They felt embarrassed that they had been intimidated by Xia ruofei’s “toy gun”. They greeted him and quickened their pace. Some even raised the steel pipes in their hands, wanting to teach Xia ruofei a lesson. Pa! A clear gunshot was heard. Then, with a clang, a steel pipe fell to the ground, and a terrifying bloody hole appeared on the knee of one of the black – shirted men. At such a close range, the kneecaps of the Man in Black were shattered, and he fell to the ground from the impact. A moment later, the intense pain was transmitted to his brain through his nerves. He let out a heart – wrenching scream and rolled on the ground while holding his already crippled leg. Xia ruofei’s expression was still calm. Wu De and the others were shocked to see that the barrel of the type 92 pistol in Xia ruofei’s hand was emitting a faint green smoke. The scene suddenly became deathly silent ...ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels
