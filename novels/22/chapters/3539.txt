Chapter 3540: A clear rejection i

Translator: 549690339

Li chenghui was still a little uneasy, worried that Li Yifu would blame him for sleeping in. After all, for the executives of big companies, there was no difference between working days and rest days. Their schedules were full. Li chenghui had been busy with work for more than ten days in a row. It was not easy for him to get a day off. He did not expect Li Yifu to call him at this time, and he was still in bed.

In fact, Li Yifu did not care about this at all. He ignored li chenghui’s explanation and said directly,””Chenghui, are you planning to arrange a marriage between Hongyan and the song family in Beijing?”

Li chenghui was slightly stunned. He didn’t expect that his uncle would know about this. He quickly said,””Uncle, 1 do have this idea. It was song Zhilan, CEO song, who suggested it. However, both parties haven’t discussed the details yet, so I didn’t report it to you …” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Why would Li Yifu usually care about such a small matter? He didn’t care if the report was made or not, so he said directly,””Forget about the marriage. Explain to the song family and reject it tactfully!”

“Ah?” Li chenghui was stunned.”Uncle, is there something wrong?”

“Don’t ask so much, just do as I say!” Li Yifu said,”call song Zhilan immediately. Don’t waste a single minute. Do you understand?”

“Alright!” Li chenghui quickly said.

Li chenghui still attached great importance to the marriage. The marriage with the song family was, strictly speaking, a higher status for the Li family. It was rare for song Zhilan to take the initiative to bring it up, so li chenghui was naturally happy to see it happen. However, Li Yifu directly called him and asked him to reject this matter. He didn’t dare to disobey, even if he felt that it was a pity.

Li chenghui’s wealth and status were all given to him by Li Yifu.

It was no exaggeration to say that Li Yifu could strip him of all this with just a word. Although he was now in charge of the Kyushu group and had a great say in the Board of Directors, it was entirely because Li Yifu had given him power. If Li Yifu was not satisfied with him, there was no difference if someone else took over.

Therefore, li chenghui did not dare to disobey his uncle’s order.

However, he still felt very regretful and puzzled at the same time, so he couldn’t help but ask,””Uncle, could it be … That the song family is going to be in trouble? Then we have to take appropriate measures in advance! Our nine regions and the song family have deep cooperation in many fields …”

Li Yifu had called him early in the morning and made the unquestionable decision to cancel the marriage. The only reason li chenghui could think of was that something was going to happen to the song family, and Li Yifu had heard the news in advance. Otherwise, why would Li Yifu be so firmly opposed to the marriage when it was greatly beneficial to both sides?

Li Yifu didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”What nonsense is this? The song family was doing very well! Chenghui, it’s not as complicated as you think. It’s just that this marriage isn’t suitable, so I asked you to reject it.”

Speaking of this, Li Yifu recalled Xia ruofei’s words and quickly reminded him,””Chenghui, you have to speak to the song family properly. You have to pay attention to your wording and don’t let them have any ill feelings. I won’t ask much about the specific business matters, but to express our apology and sincerity, you can give some concessions on the cooperation project. In short, you have to do what you want, but don’t offend the people!”

Li Yifu had learned from Xia ruofei that song Rui of the song family was his good friend, so he could not help but pay more attention to the song family. That was why he had specifically warned li chenghui, in case li chenghui’s words were inappropriate and offended the song family.

“Alright! Alright! “I see …” Li chenghui quickly replied.

He couldn’t help but break out in a cold sweat. Fortunately, his uncle explained a few words, and he almost misunderstood.

If he hadn’t asked any more questions just now, and then came down and pondered blindly, he might really have made a wrong judgment, and it might even affect the subsequent decisions.

Any project that the Kyushu group and the song family cooperated on in China would involve hundreds of millions of funds. Perhaps a decision on his side could directly ruin a project worth hundreds of millions of Yuan, which would have a great impact.

“The song family must continue to maintain a good relationship,” Li Yifu said.”In the future, we can cooperate more in – depth, so we might as well give them some benefits.” Of course, 1 won’t ask about the details. I’ll just point out a general direction, and you guys can grasp it.”

“I understand! I understand!” Li chenghui said,”uncle, do you have any other orders?”

“No, that’s all!” Li Yifu said,”remember, after you hang up the phone, call song Zhilan immediately. Also, you must pay attention to your words!”

“Don’t worry, uncle! I’ll remember it all!” Li chenghui quickly said.

After Li Yifu hung up the phone, li chenghui finally recovered. He found that his back was soaked in sweat…

His wife was also woken up by the noise. She rubbed her sleepy eyes and asked,””Chenghui, did uncle call? What’s up so early in the morning?”

Li chenghui lifted the quilt and got off the bed as he said,””Don’t worry about it, you should sleep a little longer! 1’11 go to the study to make a call…”

Beijing, the song family’s old residence.

After Xia ruofei went out to make a call, he did not mention song Rui again. Elder song and song Zhilan were also very curious about how Xia ruofei was going to prove it, or what he was going to prove. However, Xia ruofei was going to keep them in suspense even if he had to punish himself by drinking three glasses of wine. Naturally, they could not ask. They just drank and chatted while waiting..
