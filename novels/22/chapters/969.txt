Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile bitterly. Feng Rao was really obsessed with the mass production of jaded skin cream! It was supposed to be a heartwarming scene for a boss to give his employee a small gift, but when it came to Feng Jing, the atmosphere changed.

How could this be related to work ... Xia ruofei was speechless.

He was glad that Feng Jing wasn’t his girlfriend. It was a bittersweet feeling to be in a relationship with such a strong woman!

However, it seemed that Ling Qingxue was also a strong woman. She was quite cold in front of other members of the opposite sex, and only in front of Xia ruofei would she show her girly side.

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”CEO Feng, I’m ... Researching the mass production method. I’ve already made some progress. Don’t worry ...”

“Really?” Feng Rao’s big eyes looked at Xia ruofei as if she could read his mind.

If I didn’t remind you, you would’ve forgotten about this ... Feng Jing thought to herself.

Xia ruofei replied with a serious face,”of course it’s true!” I didn’t forget to study the formula while I was in Australia. There are many problems to be solved in mass production, and I still need a little time ...”

“Alright,” Feng Rao nodded. Chairman, please hold on a little tighter! This skin care product is definitely going to subvert the market. The earlier it’s launched, the earlier it’ll be profitable!”

“I know, I know!” Xia ruofei said,”how can I not make money? Don’t you worry!”

Feng Rao thought for a while and asked with a smile,”Chairman, and ...”

“You’re looking for an office building in the city, right?” Xia ruofei didn’t wait for Feng Jing to speak.”I’ll ask a friend to help me look for one tomorrow!”

Feng Jing chuckled. She knew that she was Xia ruofei’s subordinate and that Xia ruofei had no need to explain to her so patiently. However, Xia ruofei had always respected her opinion and even ‘feared’ her on some issues. This made Feng Jing’s heart warm.

Just then, Xia ruofei’s phone rang. Feng Jing quickly stood up and said,””Chairman, you should answer the phone! I won’t disturb you any longer ...”

Feng Rao showed him the bag of lavender and sheep oil in her hand and said with a smile,””Thank you for your gift!”

Xia ruofei chuckled and waved at her.

When Feng Jing left, she carefully closed the door to Xia ruofei’s office.

After returning to her office, Feng Jing’s face was still slightly warm, making her look as beautiful as a peach blossom. She looked at the lavender and sheep oil in her hands, which cost at most a thousand or two, and a faint smile appeared on her face.

……

In the chairman’s office.

Xia ruofei picked up the phone after Feng Jing closed the door. He smiled and said,””Good Morning, Secretary song!”

Song Qiming had called early in the morning. Xia ruofei must have thought that it was about Song Wei.

Xia ruofei was still feeling guilty about this. He did not calculate the time properly before leaving the country. As a result, after Song Wei finished her first course of treatment, she did not receive the following pills. Although Xia ruofei had thought of that excuse in a hurry, he still felt a little guilty whether song Qiming and the others believed him or not.

Since he had promised her, he should do his job well. He felt that he was not responsible enough for this matter.

If it was anyone else, they would have put in a lot of effort to work for the Secretary of the municipal government. Xia ruofei, on the other hand, actually went overseas for a trip. If song Qiming did not call him, he would have forgotten about it.

Hence, after greeting song Qiming, Xia ruofei immediately took the initiative and said,””Secretary song, if it’s convenient, I’ll come over to check up on Song Wei. I’ll also come up with the medicine for the next stage.”

“Xia, there’s no rush for the follow – up,” song Qiming said with a smile.”We’ll talk about it when you’re free ...”

If it was before the results came out yesterday, song Qiming would have been more anxious. However, now that he knew that Song Wei had gotten much better, even better than when she was in the early stage of the poison, he was not anxious at all.

Xia ruofei was stunned. He did not expect song Qiming to call him so early in the morning to tell him not to worry. This was beyond his expectations.

Song Qiming continued,””Little Xia! I’m calling you today to thank you! Wei Wei’s condition has improved greatly ...”

Then, song Qiming told Xia ruofei about the new progress of the poison research at 301 Hospital in the capital, as well as the results of Song Wei’s blood test that took place overnight.

Xia ruofei suddenly realized and laughed.”So it’s like this! That was at least not a failure! I’m more confident in the next healer!”

Song Qiming laughed and said,”you little Xia!” I think you’ve always been very confident! After all, we’re already used to Western Medicine’s diagnosis methods ... In fact, the Chinese medicine passed down from our ancestors is the real profound one!”

Song Qiming could not help but sigh.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Secretary song, since the treatment is effective, we should work harder. Let’s start the second treatment as soon as possible after I’ve checked on Song Wei!”

“Okay, okay ...” Song Qiming said happily,”but our family would like to treat you to a meal to express our gratitude ...”

“There’s no need for that, Secretary song!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”since we’re all on the same side, there’s no need to be so polite!”

“I should, I should!” Song Qiming said,”this is a task assigned by our comrade old Fang. If I can’t complete it, I’ll be criticized when I go back.”

Xia ruofei wanted to decline, but he suddenly had an idea. He smiled and said,””Secretary song, since it’s Auntie Fang’s order, I’ll do as she says. But don’t stay at home tonight, it’s too much of a bother. Let’s find a place to eat!”

Seeing that Xia ruofei had accepted the invitation, song Qiming said happily,””Sure! If it’s convenient to eat out, then tonight ...”

“Secretary song, I’ll decide on the location!” Xia ruofei spoke first.”Today, I’ll treat you to authentic local food from the mountains!”

Song Qiming was stunned for a moment. Then, he chuckled and said,””Alright, alright, alright, you decide on the place! But when the time comes, we’ll let Xiao Cao pay the bill. You’re not allowed to snatch it from us!”

“Alright! I’ll send the address to director Cao after I’m done!” Xia ruofei said readily.

Xia ruofei naturally wanted to invite song Qiming to Ling Ji private kitchen for dinner.

Ling’s private kitchen was opening today. Although there was only one store, it was the beginning of Ling Xiaotian’s high – end Dining Plan. As his son – in – Law – to – be, Xia ruofei couldn’t help much with anything else, but it was very meaningful to have the Secretary of the municipal government over for a meal.

This was Xia ruofei’s way of supporting Ling Ji’s private kitchen.

After ending the call with song Qiming, Xia ruofei immediately called Ling Qingxue.

“Student ruofei, don’t tell me you can’t come tonight because you have something on!” The moment Ling Qingxue picked up the phone, she pouted and said,”I’ve already told my dad. If you don’t come, I’ll lose face ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I wouldn’t dare!” Even if there’s a huge matter, I have to decline it! This was a high – end restaurant that his wife had personally established. It was the first restaurant in the history of the Ling Ji F & B Kingdom! It’s of great significance!”

Ling Qingxue giggled and said,”not bad, not bad. Little comrade, you’re quite enlightened!” Tell me, what’s the matter? I’m busy here!”

Xia ruofei immediately said seriously,”Qingxue, I’ve invited an important guest over tonight. Can you help me prepare a private room? it’s best if it has a good environment.” We have about five or six people ...”

Ling Qingxue smiled and asked,”what kind of guest is it that President Xia values so much?” Didn’t you say you’d eat with us tonight? Why did he bring a guest? Don’t tell me you’re going to rush to both sides?”

Xia ruofei didn’t beat around the bush and said directly,””The newly appointed Deputy Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee and the Secretary of the committee of Sanshan city, song Qiming!”

Ling Qingxue was stunned for a moment, then immediately reacted. She said with some excitement,””Municipal Party secretary song? Ruofei, you invited Secretary song to our Ling Ji private kitchen for a meal? He has already accepted the invitation?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”yes!” My father-in-law’s new shop is opening. As his son – in – Law, I have to give him some face! How is it? this God should be able to hold up the scene, right?”

Ling Qingxue was so excited that she even forgot about Xia ruofei’s “father – in – Law” and “son – in – Law.” She asked nervously,””Ruofei, Secretary song is coming. What should we do?” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei said casually,”just receive them normally!” This time, they’re the ones treating me to a meal, not me ...”

Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”I’m talking about serious business with you!” You’re talking nonsense again ... Forget it, forget it, I’m not going to talk to you anymore. I have to quickly tell dad to get the best private room in the restaurant. In addition, it’s best to get my dad to personally cook two dishes tonight ...”

“Qingxue, you don’t have to be so tight ...” Xia ruofei said, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.

Before he could say the word “Zhang”, Ling Qingxue had already hung up the phone in a hurry. Xia ruofei could only smile bitterly and shake his head.

If Tian Huilan had still been the Secretary, Ling Qingxue might not have paid so much attention to her. After all, she knew that Xia ruofei was close to Secretary Tian’s family. The last time someone had come to her company to find trouble, it was Xia ruofei who had invited the great God, Tian Huilan, to clean up the mess.

However, song Qiming was different. He was the newly appointed Secretary. Everyone in the political and business circles of Sanshan was trying their best to get close to this new Secretary. And what was the temper of the new Secretary? Almost no one knew what she liked, which was why Ling Qingxue was a little nervous.

Xia ruofei had wanted to give Ling Qingxue a call to explain, but on second thought, he felt that it was not a bad thing to be fully prepared, so he decided not to call.

He sat behind his desk and began to consider a problem.

Today was the grand opening day of Ling Ji’s private kitchen. As Ling Qingxue’s boyfriend, he had to prepare a gift for her tonight.

What kind of gift to prepare was very particular. Everyone was family, and things that were too expensive would seem tacky, and things that were too ordinary would seem too insincere.

Hence, Xia ruofei had to think about it carefully.

“What should I give you?” Xia ruofei mumbled to himself,”Ling Ji’s private kitchen mainly serves authentic three mountain cuisines. Then ...”

Xia ruofei suddenly had an idea. His eyes brightened and his face revealed a touch of joy.

He found that there was a gift that was perfect.
