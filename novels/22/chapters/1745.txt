Chapter 1746: Liquid gold (2)

Of course, Xia ruofei had already made a list of the materials needed to make the puppet and asked Feng Jing to use the company’s power to purchase the materials for bi an. They could be purchased through normal channels. Although some of them were extremely expensive, at least they were not precious materials that could not be found in the secular world.

As long as Xia ruofei’s cultivation improved, especially in the area of spiritual power, he would have the chance to make a puppet.

Other than being busy with these daily tasks, Xia Qing also had a new task, which was to cultivate oak trees in the Archean realm. When they grew to a certain size, she would transplant them into the mountain and sea realm.

Xia ruofei was planning to plant an Oak Forest in the mountain sea realm. Tomorrow, he would be replacing his two wineries with new oak barrels. He would need a lot of wood!

Other than Xia Qing, the White realm Fox was also comprehending the spatial rules day and night.

Xia ruofei did not disturb them. After walking around the medium, he left in a flash and returned to his room outside.

After he went to the bathroom to take a shower, he went to bed early and went to bed. In the afternoon, he cultivated with Song Wei in the time formation. It was equivalent to cultivating for many days in a row. Therefore, in line with the principle of relaxation, he did not cultivate the great Dao Arts before going to bed.

The next day, Xia ruofei had nothing to do so he strolled to the guguo temple and tried some of the local snacks. Then, he walked to Houhai and Shichahai. After returning to the courtyard house, he went to the basement to look for a blockbuster movie. It took him more than two hours to watch it.

Of course, Xia ruofei’s carefreeness only lasted for one day.

At night, he received a call from Zhao Yongjun,””Ruofei, do you have time tomorrow?”

“I’m free!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”but ... Brother Zhao, can’t you let me rest for a few more days?”

“I’m fine with that!”Zhao Yongjun laughed. But tomorrow, we will bring the designers to the site to survey and measure, and communicate our design requirements. Didn’t you say that you’d be there when the people from the design company arrive?”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei said,”sure!” Then I’d better go ...”

“You’re willing to do this. We didn’t force you!” Zhao Yongjun joked.

“Yes, yes, yes, I volunteered!” Xia ruofei said helplessly.

This plot of land completely covered the nine rotations heaven and earth formation. Once it was set up, it would be very helpful for cultivation. Hence, Xia ruofei had to state his specific needs in terms of design, especially for the formation eye. He had to build a house.

Of course, Xia ruofei could choose to come up with his own opinions after the design draft was out. However, that would be too troublesome. He might as well make a trip down personally to clarify the requirements.

“Alright, let’s meet at little Tang town at nineo’ clock tomorrow morning!” Zhao Yongjun said.

“No problem, I’ll be there on time.” Xia ruofei agreed.

......

The next morning, Xia ruofei got into Wu Qiang’s Land Rover and went straight to little Tang town.

The two of them arrived at the plot of land at around 8:40 pm. Xia ruofei had especially arrived a little earlier. After he got out of the car, he walked all the way to the lakeside and personally checked it out.

Xia ruofei was very satisfied with the results. In just over a day, under the operation of the formation, the land had completely changed. Not only was the yin Qi swept away, but the entire atmosphere had also changed, making people feel very comfortable.

Xia ruofei also noticed that the hot spring resort, which was previously contaminated with Yin Qi, had now been swept away. The atmosphere was even better than before. It could be considered that they had benefited from this place.

In fact, although the influence of those rumors still existed, the hot spring resort’s business had obviously picked up in the past two days. It was conceivable that when the rumors were dispelled, the business there would be very prosperous.

Xia ruofei even realized that there was a small amount of spiritual Qi within the formation. Although it was a far cry from the spiritual Qi in the spirit map, it was a miracle in the outside world, especially in such a harsh cultivation environment.

Especially around the eye of the array, the concentration of spiritual energy could even allow cultivators to break free from the restrictions of cultivating at midnight and dawn. Of course, if a higher level cultivator cultivated here, this little bit of spiritual energy would be quickly exhausted.

In other words, this formation still needed a certain amount of time to accumulate.

In fact, even Wu Qiang could feel the difference. He was standing beside Xia ruofei and was very close to the array core.

Wu Qiang couldn’t help but say,”director Xia, this piece of land seems to have changed!” I feel so refreshed standing here, and my mind seems to have cleared up a lot. ”

Wu Qiang had experienced the night when the yin formation was activated. Before he came to little Tang town today, he was still a little uneasy. Although the aura of the yin formation was invisible to the naked eye, the uncomfortable feeling was real.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”this is just the beginning!” It would be better in the future! Wu Qiang, when the club is built, I’ll get them to give you a membership card. You can come over to relax when you’re free!”

“No need, chief Xia!” Wu Qiang quickly waved his hand and said. I ... I don’t know how to enjoy this!”

Xia ruofei laughed.”You’re enjoying it. You don’t need to learn!”

Wu Qiang still tried his best to decline. Xia ruofei smiled and did not say anything. Anyway, there was still a long time before the club was open. If he really wanted to force the membership card to Wu Qiang, he believed that Wu Qiang would not dare to refuse.

Xia ruofei had always been very generous to the people around him.

The two of them chatted for a while before they saw a light yellow Toyota Coaster slowly driving toward them.

“They’re here! Let’s go!” Xia ruofei said.

He brought Wu Qiang along and walked towards the main road. When the two of them reached the intersection, the car slowly came to a stop.

The electric door slowly opened and Zhao Yongjun was the first to jump out. He laughed and said,””RUO Fei, you’re early enough!”

“In case you guys criticize me for being lazy!” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”brother Zhao, you didn’t bring 20 to 30 people here, did you? They’re actually using such a big car ...”

“Hehe! We’re all here, and a few people from the design company came as well. There’s also some equipment, so I simply borrowed a bigger car. ” Zhao Yongjun said.

At this time, song Rui, Liu Jian, Xu Zixuan, Hou Liang, and Wei Jun also got out of the car. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but roll his eyes. These guys were really idle! All of them were here. Didn’t they have other things to do? Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

His bad friends greeted Xia ruofei one after another. Song Rui’s eyes still had a trace of fear in them. It was really unbearable to recall what happened to Qianqian that night!

Then, the people from the design company also got out of the car. Xia ruofei finally understood why Zhao Yongjun had used coaster. There were more than ten people from Qingqing design company. Some of them were in work clothes and were even unloading equipment from the car.

One of them, a middle – aged man in his early forties with a slicked – back hairstyle, got out of the car and walked straight towards Xia ruofei and the rest.

Zhao Yongjun smiled and introduced,”ruofei, let me introduce you. This is the founder of the future design company, Lu Yifan, CEO Lu.” Yifan, this is ...”

“There’s no need to introduce you, Mr. Soldier.” Lu Yifan laughed.”There aren’t many people in China who don’t know about President Xia!”

Zhao Yongjun was stunned for a moment, then smiled and said,””I almost forgot, ruofei is a big star now!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile bitterly. At the same time, he found it interesting that Lu Yifan addressed Zhao Yongjun as “master Jun”. This form of address was rather pungent and didn’t seem like something that people in the rich and powerful circles would call.

“Yifan, I still have to introduce you. RUO Fei is not only an important partner and major shareholder in our project, but he’s also Xiao Rui’s and my best friend!” We’ll also take RUO Fei’s opinion as the main point in the entire project’s design. You two can communicate well when the time comes!”
