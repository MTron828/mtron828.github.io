A netizen’s comment on the video was very representative. He said,”I can see that this brother’s excitement is completely uncontrollable. I understand this feeling too well. It’s really difficult to be a Chinese fan!

There were also netizens who said,”this is the video with the most severe shaking I’ve ever seen, but I’ve watched it several times. When President Xia scored that goal, and then the brother who made the video screamed, I couldn’t stop my tears from flowing ...”

There were many similar videos and highlights that went viral on the internet. The topic #Xia ruofei, Wu Lei scores a goal #shot to the top three most searched topics in a short period of time, and it had a strong momentum.

When Xia ruofei, Zhou leiyun, and Zhao Zhenghao were talking about this, he could not help but laugh.”Director Zhou, it seems like your company’s stock is going to rise!”

When Wu Lei first joined the Spanish team, the stock price of Zhou leiyun’s company had soared. As long as Wu Lei scored a goal or the Spanish team won, it was great news for Zhou leiyun’s company. The stock price would rise every time.

Zhou leiyun was also overjoyed. “It’s at its daily limit at the opening today ...”

“What a good fellow!” Xia ruofei said,”so my goal has earned you more than one or two billion! And I’m afraid one day is not enough! Perhaps it would continue to rise in the next few days! How much money would that be! You capitalists make money fast!”

“If CEO Xia’s company goes public, the scale will soon surpass mine!” Zhou leiyun said,”but you can’t bear to, CEO Xia!”

“I’m in the industry, not the capital ...” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”director Zhou, do you think ... If the Spanish make it into the qualification tournament, your stock will rise again?”

“This ... It’s probably going to increase a little!” Zhou leiyun laughed and said,”but things haven’t even started! We’re still far from the European region, and this is only possible because we won the Kings ‘cup at Barcelona and saved a place for the Kings’ Cup champion to participate in the UEFA Europa League ...”

“The situation is much better now that we’ve won against Barcelona!” Zhao Zhenghao laughed and said,”the main thing is that the team’s morale has been greatly boosted, and the chances of winning the next few games are not small.”

The next few opponents of Espanyol were not particularly strong. They were considered to be weaklings among the lower – tier teams in the league. With the current lineup and morale of Espanyol, the chances of winning a few games in a row were still very high.

Of course, if Xia ruofei was always on the team and participated in every game, the chances would be higher.

“Then I’ll be counting on your blessings!” Zhou leiyun was in an extremely good mood, and he chuckled.

After chatting for a while, they saw that it was about time, so they went back to their rooms.

Xia ruofei used the computer in the hotel room to browse the news reports, mainly from the Spain media. Now that he had no problems listening, reading, and writing Spanish, reading the news was a piece of cake.

Xia ruofei saw that the pro – Real Madrid media, represented by Maca, had given the Spanish team high praise. Their comments on Xia ruofei and Wu Lei were also very objective, even a little flattering.

In addition, the media was gloating over Barcelona’s failure. This was something they were happy to see. Of course, RCD Espanyol would not admit that they were just a “ditch.”

There was a comment in the Maca newspaper: In terms of the performance of this game alone, Messi was far from comparable to the Chinese player Xia ruofei of the Spanish team. In other words, no player in the Barcelona team had a better performance than Xia ruofei, including the very eye – catching zuyare. It could be said that it was Xia ruofei’s wonderful play that helped Espanyol take away the three points that bar?a had gotten.

When Xia ruofei saw the article, he couldn’t help but smile bitterly. Maca news was trying to make him hate them! When the bar?a fans saw such an article, other than scolding Maca news, they would definitely be full of resentment towards Xia ruofei.

Of course, even without this report, the bar?a fans would still hate Xia ruofei to death.

Naturally, Xia ruofei did not care about these things.

From the Spanish team’s perspective, Xia ruofei felt pretty good reading these reports.

However, the Catalan region’s sports daily and several other media outlets close to bar?a reported in a completely different style.

Their reports were almost the same, basically with the tone of “the Spanish team was lucky and won a difficult victory in nokapu.”

Basically, for some of the details of the game, it was just a stroke of brush. The home team had lost the game, and they had lost to a weak Espanyol. Who would break the game apart and analyze it? Wasn’t that the same as sprinkling salt on the universe team’s wound?

They did not report too many details of the game, but the game was so eye – catching that the media could not pretend not to see it! As a result, the regional media in Katai, represented by The Sports Daily, focused on some highlights on and off the field.

For example, sports daily wrote an article with the title of “Xia ruofei has praised Messi many times and called him a great player.” The author of this report was Pablo, the reporter who had asked Xia ruofei a question at the press conference yesterday.
