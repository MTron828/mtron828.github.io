“I can’t make the decision on this matter!” Xia ruofei said,”we have to see if Monica is willing! How about this ... I’ll find a suitable opportunity to ask her. ”

“Alright!” Lui hai said. He looked at the direction where Monica left and said with a smile,”Mr. Xia, you’re so nice to Ms. Grasso!”

In fact, lui hai had seen all the things that Xia ruofei had done for Monica. But what puzzled him was that although Monica was grateful to Xia ruofei and respected him, she didn’t seem to admire him like a man and a woman.

Could it be that a super awesome man like Mr. Xia still had girls he couldn’t hit on?

“You’re the one who talks too much!” Xia ruofei said,”let’s settle the Hong sect first!” You’ll be busy for a while from now on!” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Hehe!” Lui hai smiled,”it’s all thanks to you, Mr. Xia!” We won’t be able to stay idle for a while!”

“By the way, is there any reaction from the glory society?” Xia ruofei asked.

Lui hai said seriously,”our brothers in the Italy Freemasonry are paying close attention to the movement of the glorious Association. So far, they have not done anything unusual. According to our spies, the elder behind the Gelman family is very angry. He even proposed to take revenge on the Italian Freemasonry ...”

“Oh? What’s the attitude of the glory society’s higher – ups?” Xia ruofei did not find it strange that the Hong sect had a mole in the glorious society. He was more concerned about the collective will of this huge mafia organization.

After all, if it really turned into a full – scale conflict, Xia ruofei would not be afraid of them. However, there would be casualties in the Hong sect. No matter how powerful Xia ruofei was, he could not protect all the brothers in the Hong sect.

Moreover, this kind of full – scale gang conflict in Italy and even all of Europe would definitely cause heavy casualties.

Naturally, Xia ruofei did not want to see such an outcome.

“Yes.” Lui hai smiled,”the glory society isn’t United. The old Mafia family has many factions. It’s hard to pass such a radical motion! “Besides, we’ve only used the people from the Turin branch this time. It’s a local competition, so the glorious Association doesn’t dare to expand the scope of the conflict. That’s why the elder’s proposal wasn’t passed. ”

“That’s good ...” Xia ruofei heaved a sigh of relief.

Lui hai smiled,”don’t worry, Mr. Xia!” At most, they will express their dissatisfaction to me and the headquarters of the Hong sect in North America. If they really want to start a full – scale war with us, those big noses won’t dare to!”

Xia ruofei nodded.”We can’t let our guard down. Ah hai, you have to monitor the glorious Association’s movements closely. If there’s anything unusual, inform me immediately!”

“Yes!” Lui hai answered seriously.

……

After lunch, Xia ruofei called Monica over to the back garden and told her about the incident with Caras. He then asked,””Monica, what do you think of this matter?”

Monica was silent for a long time before she said,””Xia ... I’m conflicted too ... I’ve grown up in this family and have been in the truffle business ... It’s just that this family has left me with too many bad memories. I don’t know if it’s a good choice to go back ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I can see that you still have feelings for your family ...”

“No! I hate them!” Monica retorted,”ever since grandfather passed away, those carefree days have come to an end ... Especially this time. Rousey and I have been restricted by our family, and Calas even used Rousey to threaten me ...”

Xia ruofei looked at Monica and said,”I understand!” But think about it from another perspective, you only hate Calas and those family members led by him. Can they represent the entire family?”

Monica’s eyes revealed a hint of confusion as she said,””I don’t know ... Only uncle muntley and Aunt Jessica stood up for me in this family crisis, but they have been marginalized ...”

“Actually, many of our clansmen are probably angry but don’t dare to say anything!” Xia ruofei said,”you can’t expect everyone to be so selfless, but this is your family after all. Many of them are related to you by blood, some close and some distant ...”

Xia ruofei looked into Monica’s eyes and said,””Monica, I won’t interfere with your decision, but I can tell you that if you return to the family, Calas will give up his position as the head of the family. The Hong sect will support you unconditionally, and you can easily control the family! Who I think is good to you and who is not good to you;”You should have a scale in your heart as to who’s the majority that doesn’t dare to speak out, and who’s gloating over someone’s misfortune when they’re down. When you take control of the family, you can just drive those people who treat you and Rousey badly out of the decision – making circle or even the family. For people like uncle Monteli and Aunt Jessica, who will never leave you in times of need, you can totally put them in important positions! At that time, how the family operates will be up to you. I guarantee that no one will dare to say no!”

The confusion in Monica’s eyes gradually disappeared. She was obviously moved by Xia ruofei’s suggestion.
