Chapter 561: Earning 20 million Yuan (1)

Among the five employees who were finally selected to learn how to make iron – skinned maples, there were two security personnel and three shed workers.

Among the Veterans, Qin Xiaojun, who was the first to arrive at the farm, had also registered and passed the selection.

Qin Xiaojun’s major in the Army was explosives. He spent all his time fiddling with explosives, timers, and mines. When he came to work on the farm, the skills that the other three had learned could still be used in the local areas. However, his major was basically useless. It was the least practical.

Even though Xia ruofei had promoted Qin Xiaojun to the position of a team leader and he would only be learning how to make iron – hide maples, he still decided to sign up after much consideration.

Xia ruofei, Lei Hu, and the other veterans would not object to Jian Jia working on the farm. It would be good for Qin Xiaojun to learn another skill.

Xia ruofei trusted his old comrades more, so he appointed Qin Xiaojun as the leader of the group of five heading to Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province.

Qin Xiaojun and the rest took the bullet train, which was naturally faster than Xia ruofei’s self – driving.

Hence, Xia ruofei told Qin Xiaojun and the rest to find a hotel to stay in after they arrived in Anyue city. Of course, all the expenses would be covered by the company. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

He drove at Full Speed with master Luo and had a simple lunch at the highway service area. They finally arrived at Qiantang city at three in the afternoon.

Xia ruofei directly brought master Luo along. Under the guidance of the GPS, they arrived at the Qiantang Tongren Tang pharmacy.

President Lin of Tongren Hall had been waiting in the store for a long time.

As soon as Xia ruofei got out of the car, President Lin, who had been waiting eagerly, welcomed him warmly.”Brother Xia, you’ve had a long journey!”

His eyes lit up when he saw Xia ruofei’s car. “Brother Xia’s car is really good! If I’m not mistaken, it should be a limited edition Knight XV, right?”

“I think so ... I don’t know much about cars,” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

When President Lin heard this, the enthusiasm on his face grew even more.

Although it was a little tacky to use a house, car, and clothes to measure a person’s status, the fact that Xia ruofei could drive a limited edition Knight XV that was worth tens of millions still shocked President Lin. At least Xia ruofei’s financial strength was once again confirmed, and it also greatly increased President Lin’s confidence in further cooperation.

“President Lin, I didn’t keep a single tael of iron – Skin maple duel this time. It’s all in the car!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Thank you, thank you!” President Lin said happily,”thank you, brother Xia!”

After saying that, Mr. Lin hurriedly called the shop assistant over and took out the big bag of iron – hide Kaede from the trunk of Knight XV.

President Lin personally led Xia ruofei and master Luo into the back hall of the pharmacy.

“President Lin, let’s take a look at the item first!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”if the quality of the herbs can’t meet your standards, just tell me. I can bring it back. Anyway, I’m here for the gathering.”

“Don’t joke around, brother Xia!”President Lin quickly said. When have you ever sold something that wasn’t of the highest quality? How can it not meet the standard?”

Even though he said that, President Lin still quickly signaled the appraisal staff to open the bag and check the Ironhide maples that Xia ruofei had brought.

The person in charge of the appraisal was an old acquaintance. When Xia ruofei first came here to sell wild ginseng, it was this old Chinese medicine doctor Huang who was in charge of the appraisal.

Old Chinese physician Huang gave Xia ruofei a friendly smile, then opened the bag and took out a handful of iron – Skin maples.

When the iron – skinned fengdou was presented in front of director Lin and old Chinese doctor Huang, both of them widened their eyes in unison.

Old Chinese medicine doctor Huang immediately took a closer look at the iron maples, while President Lin squatted down and couldn’t wait to grab a bunch of them from the bag and look at them carefully.

Xia ruofei and master Luo looked at each other and smiled. Then, they looked at the two calmly.

President Lin and old Huang looked at it repeatedly for a long time. Old Huang’s eyes lit up. He put the iron maple in his hand closer and sniffed it deeply. He immediately showed a look of enjoyment. Then, he carefully tore a piece and put it in his mouth to chew.

After a while, director Lin and old Chinese doctor Huang exchanged a look.

Old Chinese physician Huang nodded slightly and said,””President Lin, there’s no doubt that boss Xia’s batch of fengdou is of the highest quality. It’s even higher quality than the special grade products we’re selling!”

Mr. Lin was in charge of the branch in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province, and the iron – Skin fengdou was a special medicinal herb in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province, so he naturally knew a lot.

After a moment of thought, President Lin said,””Brother Xia, you’ve given me a difficult problem ...”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, then he smiled and asked,””Big brother Lin, what do you mean? Could it be that the funds in the store ...”

“No, no, we have enough funds!” President Lin quickly said. Brother Xia! I’m in a difficult position on how to set the price for this batch of maple stalks!”

Xia ruofei laughed,”that’s easy!” Big brother Lin, you’ve seen my batch of fengdou, so you can set the price however you want. I believe that you won’t let me suffer a loss!”

“I’m just worried that you’ll be at a disadvantage, so ... Brother Xia, I’ll tell you the truth!”President Lin said with a bitter smile. The quality of your batch of iron – skinned fengdou is beyond our imagination. We’ve never purchased such high – Quality fengdou before, and we don’t even have a reference price ...”
