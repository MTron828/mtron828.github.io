2958 The appearance of the auction (1)

Then, Valley master Liu glanced at Xia ruofei.

Seeing this, Luo Qingfeng quickly introduced her,””Valley Head Liu, this is my Junior Brother Xia Tian, and this is my senior brother Li Yifu.”

Then, Luo Qingfeng immediately said,””Junior Brother Xia, senior brother li, this is the famous Valley master of the flying flower Valley, Liu Mansha. This is elder Yang Liu of the flying flower Valley. This is ...”

The third person was a beauty in a Palace dress who looked even younger. It was obvious that Luo Qingfeng did not know her, so he was stuck at this point.

Liu Mansha had obviously noticed the order of Luo Qingfeng’s introduction. Xia ruofei was in front, and Li Yifu was behind him. With a glance, she could tell that Li Yifu’s cultivation was only at the fifth level of the aura refining realm, while Xia ruofei’s cultivation ... She could not even tell.

Liu Mansha couldn’t help but take another look at Xia ruofei.

At this moment, elder Yang Liu of the soaring Flower Valley, who was standing beside Liu Mansha, said indifferently,””Sect leader Luo, this is Valley master Liu’s last disciple, Yu xiner. Xiner, why don’t you greet sect leader Luo of the star Seizer sect?”

Upon hearing this, Yu Xin ‘er cupped her fists at Luo Qingfeng and called out,””Xin ‘er greets sect leader Luo!”

“Hello, martial nephew Yu,” Luo Qingfeng quickly said.

At this moment, Xia ruofei and Li Yifu also cupped their fists and greeted Liu Mansha and Yang Liu.

Yang Liu returned the greeting with a smile, while a faint smile appeared on Liu Mansha’s face. She said,””Fellow Daoist Xia is really young and promising!”

Although Liu Mansha could not see through Xia ruofei’s cultivation, she could still tell his real age. He was in his twenties, yet he was Luo Qingfeng’s junior Brother. He also had a treasure that could conceal his cultivation. He must be a genius disciple that was highly valued in the sect. Just like Yu xiner, Liu Mansha had never thought that Xia ruofei’s cultivation could reach the Golden core stage. Furthermore, his spiritual power cultivation was on par with hers. Naturally, he thought that Xia ruofei must have brought a treasure that could hide his cultivation level.

How could a golden core cultivator in his twenties be possible?

“Valley Head Liu, you’re too kind,” Xia ruofei replied in a manner that was neither haughty nor humble.

After he had learned from Liu chengfeng that elder Yang Liu of the flying flower Valley was also very interested in the two storage rings, he had specifically inquired about the situation of the flying flower Valley when he talked to Luo Qingfeng at noon. Naturally, he knew that the valley master of the flying flower Valley, Liu Mansha, was already in the middle stage of the Golden core realm, and Yang Liu had also entered the early stage of the Golden core realm for many years. His accumulation was very deep, and his talent was also extremely outstanding. However, because of the continuous deterioration of the cultivation environment, he had not been able to break through to the middle stage of the Golden core realm.

Furthermore, Xia ruofei knew that Liu Mansha and Yang Liu looked like they were in their 30s, but in reality, they were both close to 80 years old. They were definitely grandmother – like figures.

There were many female cultivators in the world of cultivation who could maintain their youthful looks, but it was rare to see a cultivator from the flying flower Valley who had no signs of aging on his face. Luo Qingfeng had even specifically mentioned this to Xia ruofei at noon. Xia ruofei did not expect to meet a cultivator from the flying flower Valley in the elevator.

Xia ruofei thought to himself,”it’s probably because of the cultivation technique. If Song Wei and Ling Qingxue knew about this technique, wouldn’t they die of envy?”

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei suddenly felt that he should find some time to pick out a supplementary cultivation technique for Song Wei and Ling Qingxue.

The “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” was undoubtedly a very good cultivation technique. However, it had a lot of limitations. It required two people to cultivate it together. If one cultivated it alone, the progress would be very slow. Xia ruofei couldn’t be by their side all the time. Although they had embarked on the path of cultivation, they were still young and had their own careers. It was unrealistic to let them live in seclusion on the Peach Blossom Island and leave the world. Even Xia ruofei found it difficult to completely separate himself from the world. Therefore, it was very important to find them a supplementary cultivation technique so that they could cultivate during normal times.

Of course, this thought only flashed through his mind. Xia ruofei’s priority was to attend the auction.

After Xia ruofei and the rest greeted Liu Mansha and the other two, they did not say anything else. The flying flower Valley was filled with female cultivators, and all of them had cold personalities. Luo Qingfeng was not particularly familiar with them, so naturally, there was not much to talk about. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Fortunately, the elevator of a five – Star hotel descended very quickly. After a short silence, everyone heard a “ding” and the elevator had arrived on the third floor.

The door of the carriage opened. Two disciples of the falling leaves sect were waiting at the elevator door, ready to welcome the guests at any time.

Xia ruofei’s gaze went past the two disciples and landed on a figure not far away. That person was directing a few low – ranking disciples to move a box. When Xia ruofei’s gaze fell on him, he seemed to feel something and turned around inadvertently.

This man was Liu chengfeng.

A faint smile appeared on Xia ruofei’s face and he quickly looked away. As Xia ruofei had already given him instructions, Liu chengfeng’s eyes did not stay on Xia ruofei. He continued with his work after a quick glance.

The two falling leaves sect disciples at the elevator door walked up respectfully. One of them walked up to Luo Qingfeng and said respectfully,””Hello, sect leader Luo!”

The other disciple was naturally there to receive Liu Mansha’s group.

They had also arranged for a dozen disciples to wait near the electric ladder, ready to welcome any cultivators who headed to the auction venue.

Luo Qingfeng nodded reservedly. As an Aurous core cultivator and the sect leader of the star Seizer sect, it was natural for him to put on airs in front of the low – Level disciples of the fallen leaves sect who were in charge of receiving guests.

“Sect master Luo, seniors,” the disciple said.”The star Seizer sect’s seat is in room 20. Please follow me!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows. Wasn’t the auction held in the main banquet hall? Why was there a private room?

However, Xia ruofei did not ask. He would see it soon anyway, so he just had to follow.

The disciple on the other side also led Liu Mansha’s group to the other entrance of the main banquet hall.

Luo Qingfeng and Liu Mansha cupped their hands at each other from a distance, and then everyone went in different directions.

The disciple led Xia ruofei and the rest into the main banquet hall of the hotel.

Only then did Xia ruofei realize that the fallen leaves sect had already renovated the entire main banquet hall in advance for this auction.

In the middle of the banquet hall, there was a one – meter – tall stage covered with a thick red carpet. There was also a table, which should be the auction stage.

Around the main auction stage, there was a structure similar to that of a sports grandstand. However, there were no individual seats on the “grandstand”. Instead, there were independent private rooms built around the main auction stage. Except for the side at the entrance, the other three sides had individual private rooms.

The banquet hall was tall, reaching a height of about six meters. These small private rooms were located at a higher position, so they could surround and look down at the main auction stage in the middle.

Xia ruofei did a rough count and realized that there were 50 to 60 private rooms. In other words, there were about 50 to 60 families participating in the auction.

These small private rooms were all independent, and because the venue was very large, there was quite a large gap between the private rooms.

There was a path between every two private rooms, and following the steps, one could reach the main auction stage below.

The back of the box was not next to the wall of the main banquet hall, and there was also a circular passage.

That disciple had led Xia ruofei and the rest up the circular pathway from the entrance. Then, they walked all the way to the door of a private room with a sign that read “Erhuang”.

The falling leaf sect disciple opened the box and then bowed slightly,”Please come in, seniors! This is the box of the star Seizer sect!”

Xia ruofei and the other two walked into the private room.

Xia ruofei looked around and saw that the private room was made of wood, but the inner walls were wrapped with a layer of soundproof cotton. The side facing the main auction stage was a one – way glass, so privacy was still quite good.

There were three soft leather couches in the room, and in front of each sofa was a small coffee table with desserts, fruits, and drinks.

In addition, there were two cabinets on the side of the room. One of the cabinets was also filled with various snacks and other food. The other cabinet was filled with wine, red wine and white wine. There were also a few wine glasses on the top of the low cabinet.

“Not bad!” Xia ruofei laughed.

Considering that after the auction ended, the main banquet Hall’s facilities would definitely have to be removed. Thus, in order to hold the auction this time, the fallen leaves sect had indeed spent a lot of money.

Of course, money in the secular world was nothing to cultivation sects. Not many cultivators would value money in the secular world.

...

The disciple did not leave immediately after Xia ruofei and the other two entered the private room. Instead, he followed them in.

He first introduced some of the facilities in the room, including the wine cabinet, and then said,””Three seniors, this is the bidding device on the armrest of the middle seat. It’s very simple to use. When you see an item you like and want to bid, just press the blue button on the touch screen, and you can increase the price by one time according to the increase in price. If you want to add more spirit stones at once, you can also enter the price directly through the touch screen and press the blue button to submit after confirmation. After the bid is submitted, the big screen in front will display information such as the bid of a certain room ...”
