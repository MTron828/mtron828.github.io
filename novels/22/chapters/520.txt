Chapter 521: A deep sense of powerlessness (1)

Xia ruofei could already see Huo Dun Qian Qian from the corner of his eyes. He had no choice. His fat pig – like body was too big a target.

Xia ruofei stood up and said,””Old Mr. Tang, since the lawsuit has been arranged, let’s go! There’s nothing much to do at the airport. ”

“Sure!” Tang He said with a smile.

His original intention was to teach the customs officer a lesson, but after Jorgensen came back and reported what happened, he changed his mind. He had to destroy this villain’s reputation and make him a rat on the street.

The two of them stood up and walked out of the airport. Liang Qichao quickly followed them.

Smith saw that the person in question was about to leave, so he hurriedly jogged after him, shouting,””Please wait a moment, Mr. Tang!”

Two burly bodyguards blocked the two’s path. Their expressions were cold, and their thick arms stretched out, blocking the two of them.

“Mr. Tang, I’m very sorry for what happened today. Please give us a chance to explain!” Smith quickly shouted.

Tang He’s footsteps paused slightly. He turned to look at Xia ruofei and said with a smile,””Xia, do you want to hear what they have to say?”

“Not interested at all!” Xia ruofei shrugged.

Tang He raised his head and laughed,””Let’s go!”

After that, the two of them walked towards the exit without looking back. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Mr. Jorgensen, please help me,” Smith quickly called out. Everything that happened today was a misunderstanding. We will definitely punish Houton severely ...”

Jorgensen stopped and turned around. He said expressionlessly,”Mr. Smith, I’ve already asked Mr. Tang. He’s very indignant about what happened today! We’ve decided to entrust Lucas law firm to file a lawsuit against Mr. Horton for his words and actions of racial discrimination. At the same time, we will also Lodge a serious protest to your superiors in the name of shengbang group regarding the work of Sydney’s customs! There’s no room for discussion on this matter, so you’re on your own!”

When Smith and Houton heard that, they were dumbfounded as if they had been struck by lightning.

Lucas law firm was really famous and well – known!

The rich and powerful shengbang group was a super consortium with great influence all over the world.

Hutton was really courting death today. He had kicked the Titanium Alloy Plate directly ...

Hutton’s face was ashen, and the fat on his face trembled. He asked,”Mr. Smith, what should we do?”

Smith glared at Houton and said angrily,””Who knows what we should do! Houton, you’d better think about how to deal with the court case! By the way, you don’t have to come to work from today on. I’ll write your behavior in the report, and your dismissal notice will be sent to your house in three days at the latest!”

Upon hearing this, Huo Dun felt as if his parents had died and the sky was about to collapse.

In Australia, the federal civil servants were almost permanent. Unless they made a major mistake, they would not be fired.

But today, not only was he caught in the act of racial discrimination and was about to go to court, but he had also offended a super consortium like shengbang group, which even the federal government had to treat with respect. His direct supervisor, Mr. Smith, had written everything in the report truthfully, so his dismissal was almost inevitable.

The treatment of Australian civil servants was quite good. They were paid well, their working hours were not long, and they basically did not have to work overtime. They also had at least 20 days of annual leave. After working for 10 years, they could enjoy a long leave with full pay for half a year. The working hours were free, and many departments could choose their own working hours, such as 8 to 15 O’ clock or 9 to 16 o’ clock; Even after working for more than a year, one could apply for part – time, which meant that one could work part – time three to four days a week. Of course, the corresponding benefits would be slightly reduced.

It could be said that apart from China, there was no other civil service position in the world that would attract countless young people to sign up for. Australia was definitely one of them.

To be able to become a civil servant in Australia, whether it was a federal civil servant or a state government civil servant, one had to go through many trials and tribulations. The opportunity was definitely hard to come by.

Now that he was about to lose this well – paid job, how could hourton accept this reality?

“Mr. Smith, you can’t do this!” He begged. I’m just carrying out my duties. Even if the standards for Chinese passengers are relatively harsh, you can’t fire me for that!”

Smith sneered,”Hutton!” Is it also because of the strict standards that they call Chinese travelers ‘Chinaman’?”

“I ...” Houton was suddenly at a loss for words. He struggled in his heart for a long time, and as if he had found a life – saving straw, he shouted,”Mr. Smith, they have no evidence! At that time, only Jones, me, and the Chinese woman heard it! However, this is not absolute evidence. She did not record or video ...”

Smith looked at Houton in disgust and said,””Do you think that with Mr. Lucas in court, your arguments will have any hope of winning? Also, do you mean that you want Jones to perject himself?”

“I didn’t mean that, Mr. Smith ...”

“I don’t want to talk to you anymore, Mr. Hutton!” Smith said impatiently,”from now on, you are suspended! Now, I need to go back and think about how to deal with that damn complaint! As for you ...”
