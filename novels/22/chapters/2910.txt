2911 Who can’t be tolerated_

Zhang Chao could only suppress his anger and said humbly,””Mr. ERAD, the market value of these industries of Huafeng shipping is at least five million US dollars, and there is a demand but no supply. Five hundred thousand US dollars is really too low ...”

ERAD just glanced at Zhang Chao, then slightly raised his chin, looked at Zhang Chao with eyes that looked down on all living beings, and said indifferently,””Four hundred and fifty thousand dollars. You have three days to move!”

Zhang Chao’s face changed slightly and he said,””This is impossible! We can’t afford such a huge loss ...”

“Four hundred thousand dollars!” ERAD’s face sank, and he lowered the price again.”I hope that you will take the initiative to disappear from here today. Otherwise ... I will make you disappear!”

Zhang Chao fell silent. He looked up at Sanchez, Fernando, and several other government officials who had come to help behind ERAD. He found that these people were all looking up at the sky, as if they had not heard ERAD’s naked threat at all.

ERAD’s words were already a death threat. He had said it without any scruples in front of so many government officials and public servants. It could be said that he was extremely arrogant.

Zhang Chao knew that things would not end well today. He had two choices. One was to swallow his pride and accept this humiliating and unfair deal. The second option was to go all out and use the Hong sect’s power in kuachakuros to fight them.

The first choice was very humiliating. Perhaps he wouldn’t even get the $400000 in the end and would just have to get lost. However, Zhang Chao knew that if he accepted these conditions, his personal safety could basically be guaranteed.

The second option was relatively more courageous, but it would only be a momentary pleasure. The outcome would be quite tragic. Not only would he not be able to escape, but many of his brothers would also lose their lives. This was beyond doubt.

ERAD looked at the struggling Zhang Chao with interest and said meaningfully,””I’m from China, and the US $400000 offer is valid for five minutes. I might lower the price again if it’s more than five minutes!”

Zhang Chao took a deep breath and said,””Mr. ERAD, I’m afraid I can’t make a decision. I’m just a professional manager, and I need to consult the Board of Directors for such an important decision, so ... I hope you can give us more time. ”

ERAD wagged his index finger and said,””I’ve never accepted bargaining. You have four minutes and forty seconds to consider!”

Zhang Chao secretly gritted his teeth and struggled madly in his heart. He knew very well that the decision he made would likely affect the fate of a large group of brothers.

The disciples of the Hong sect were all hot – blooded people. If Zhang Chao had been in the past, he would have slapped anyone who spoke to him in this way. However, he was now the person in charge of Huafeng shipping. He couldn’t just care about his own happiness and put so many brothers in danger.

Zhang Chao gritted his teeth and frowned as he struggled with his thoughts.

“Chinese, do you know which two creatures I hate the most?” ERAD asked.

Zhang Chao raised his head and looked at ERAD in confusion.

ERAD obviously didn’t want to wait for Zhang Chao’s answer. After asking, he immediately said,”I hate rats and ... Chinese people the most!”

Zhang Chao’s face changed drastically when he heard this. A rush of hot blood rushed to his head, and his eyes turned red in an instant.

ERAD looked at Zhang Chao with interest and said with disdain,””There’s one thing in common between the Chinese and rats, and that is that their reproductive ability is too strong, so much so that they can’t be killed. No matter how humans exterminate the rats, there are still endless rats on earth. Aren’t you Chinese the same? Now, the whole world can see Chinese people everywhere. It’s really hard to be happy ...”

Zhang Chao’s chest heaved up and down violently. At this moment, all of his reason was burned out by anger. His blood – Red eyes stared at ERAD as he spoke word by word in Spanish, gritting his teeth,”Irade, I, F * ck, your, mother!”

The smile on ERAD’s face suddenly froze, and his gloomy face revealed a strong killing intent. He narrowed his eyes and said,””Chinese monkey, can you repeat what you just said?”

Before Zhang Chao could speak, a young voice came from the small building of the shipping company behind,””He just said that he wanted to F * ck your mother. To put it simply, he wanted to have sex with your mother!”

This young voice was also speaking Spanish, and it was much more accurate than Zhang Chao ‘s.

Zhang Chao’s expression changed when he heard the familiar voice. He could tell that it was Xia ruofei’s voice. He couldn’t help but complain.

Just now, he was so hot – blooded that he completely forgot that there were two “special envoys” sent by Li Yifu in the shipping company today. It was fine if they fought to the death with ERAD. At most, they would die. However, that Mr. Xia and the old man in the long shirt who did not speak from beginning to end were his uncle’s people! If anything were to happen to them here, how was he going to explain it to his adopted uncle?

Moreover, didn’t I just ask Lu Chunfeng to take them to the warehouse? Why would Mr. Xia appear here? Damn Lu Chunfeng, he dropped the ball again at the critical moment! Zhang Chao said angrily in his heart.

However, it was too late to stop him. Not only did Xia ruofei make a sound, but his voice had already appeared at the door of the building.

Xia ruofei walked to Zhang Chao’s side step by step. He stared at ERAD’s disgusting face and said,””You know what? In my eyes, a racist piece of trash is worse than a rat. At most, it’s a pile of stinky dog shit floating in the sewers!”

Zhang Chao was almost scared out of his wits when he heard this. He thought to himself that he was really done for this time!

This Mr. Xia looked gentle and elegant, but he was actually so angry! It must have been ERAD’s insulting remarks about the Chinese that had angered him, so he walked out without a care. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

However, even though it felt good, the result was extremely serious.

ERAD was famous for his ruthlessness among the middle – Level leaders of the Bay group. Even Zhang Chao had heard of this drug lord. Over the years, more than 200 people had died directly under his gun. If those who were killed indirectly by him were counted, there were countless more.

In Zhang Chao’s opinion, this Mr. Xia was completely seeking his own death!

Zhang Chao didn’t regret his impulsiveness just now. ERAD had insulted the Chinese in front of him. Even if he could turn back time, he would still choose to scold him. He would never back down, even if he had to pay the price with his life.

However, Zhang Chao regretted that he did not consider Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng. They were Li Yifu’s men, and he had to be responsible for them since they came to Mexico. This was equivalent to Li Yifu handing them over to him. If anything were to happen here, how could he face Li Yifu?

Zhang Chao quickly stopped Xia ruofei and said,””Mr. Xia, please don’t interfere in this matter! This is an internal matter of the Freemasonry ...”

Immediately after, Zhang Chao immediately said to ERAD a little nervously,””Mr. ERAD, I take back my rude words. This gentleman is my friend, not a shipping company’s staff. He just came from the United States and doesn’t know much about Mexico. He didn’t mean to offend you. I hope you can forgive him!”

Xia ruofei’s sudden appearance and the words he had said had even caused ERAD’s thoughts to freeze for a moment. In all these years, very few people had dared to say such things in front of him.

After Zhang Chao finished speaking, ERAD finally came back to his senses. The killing intent on his face became more and more intense, and he said with a grim smile,””Yellow – skinned monkey, do you think ...”

“Pa!”

A crisp slap was heard.

Xia ruofei, who was more than five meters away from ERAD just now, suddenly flashed when ERAD started to speak. Everyone only felt a blur in front of their eyes, and Xia ruofei’s figure directly appeared in front of ERAD. Those intimidating – looking bodyguards were completely non – existent.

Immediately after, Xia ruofei raised his hand and slapped him without any hesitation.
