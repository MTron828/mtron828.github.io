Chapter 691: The herb garden in space (1)

Xia Qing looked at Xia ruofei with a strange expression and said,””Master, as far as I know, pomfrets originally live in the sea. They only go upstream when they lay eggs. Isn’t this just right?”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, then he came to his senses. He smiled embarrassedly and said,””It really is! This is in line with the nature of the pomfrets!”

However, Xia ruofei changed his mind and said,””That’s not right ... These rays will all be in the sea, and I won’t be able to catch them when I need them!”

Although only a small part of the ocean had been unlocked, which was only about a hundred meters away from the coastline, it was foreseeable that the ocean would become even wider in the future as the space was upgraded.

Xia Qing smiled and said,”master, you’ve forgotten that this is the spirit map world!” You’re the absolute master of the spirit map world, so what’s the difference between swimming in the river and swimming in the sea? With a single thought, no matter where they are in the spirit map world, they can’t escape your control!”

“That makes sense!” Xia ruofei returned to her senses and said with a smile,”Xia Qing! The spirit map world is getting bigger and bigger. Sometimes, I really forget that this is just an artificial space ...”

Xia ruofei tried to feel it. Every blade of grass and tree in the entire space, including every little ray fish that had returned to the sea, could still be clearly sensed by him.

Furthermore, Xia ruofei could feel that as long as he willed it, the invisible spatial force could gather all these rays without any effort.

Xia ruofei was completely relieved.

With a slight thought, he used an invisible spatial force to lift the all – terrain vehicle, bringing Xia Qing, Blackie, and the others to float over the river easily, and landed steadily on the other side of the river.

Then, Xia ruofei continued driving, inspecting the upgraded mountain and sea realm of the spirit map space.

Xia ruofei realized that one – third of the mountain sea realm was a coastline, and the remaining two – thirds was still land. According to this trend, he was either on a continent or a Peninsula.

As for the specific situation, he could only wait for the realm to continue upgrading and expanding before the mysterious veil could be slowly lifted.

......

Xia ruofei walked along the coastline and the space membrane and returned to the starting point.

By now, he had a rough estimate of the area of the mountain and sea realm.

It had about 3800 mu.

In other words, it had nearly doubled in size compared to the last time he had absorbed the Jade.

And this was only the area of the land. If the area of the sea was included, it would definitely be more than four thousand mu.

Now that the mountain sea realm’s environment was more suitable for kun fish to grow, Xia ruofei decided to go to the Archean realm and transfer a portion of the kun fish to the mountain sea realm.

Of course, there were still some breeding fish left in the Archean realm.

That was because time was 30 times faster at the Archean realm. The speed of reproduction of the rays was naturally 30 times faster than normal. This way, Xia ruofei could expand the population of rays even more quickly.

Xia ruofei walked around the Archean realm and felt that it was too empty.

Other than the oak trees that he had transplanted earlier, there were almost no other crops.

That was because Xia ruofei had placed most of the valuable crops at the Archean realm. Wild ginseng and the like could obtain the greatest benefits under the time flow that was 30 times faster.

There was no need for Xia ruofei to grow crops that did not have obvious economic benefits in the realm. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Not to mention the time and effort, he wouldn’t be able to earn much money.

Xia ruofei furrowed his brows and expressed his thoughts. Then, he asked,””Xia Qing, this Archean realm is so spacious. It’s really a waste to just leave it here. Do you have any good suggestions?”

“Master, you can set up a medicinal garden here!” Xia Qing said after some thought.

“Herb garden?” Xia ruofei said,”I’ve never even heard of the immortal herbs you mentioned before. Where can I find the seeds to plant them?”

Xia Qing smiled.”Master, spirit herbs and immortal herbs can only be found by chance. They can’t be sought. The herb garden I mentioned isn’t for growing these immortal spirit herbs.”

“You don’t plant spirit herbs and immortal herbs? Could it be a normal Chinese medicine?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Yes!” Xia Qing nodded. Master, I’ve seen the herbs you bought from the outside world. To be honest, the quality is very poor! When you brew body tempering soup, spirit nourishing soup, heart nourishing soup, Jade skin cream, and so on, these herbs can only produce a little effect. ”

“No way? I ordered those herbs from a big pharmacy!” Xia ruofei said,”the quality should be guaranteed, right?”

Xia Qing shook her head and said,”that might be due to the external environment. In short, the medicinal properties of those herbs are very weak. In my opinion, they are not qualified!”

“So you’re saying we should plant it ourselves?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Yes!” Xia Qing nodded. Master, there’s a large piece of open space in the mountain sea realm, and we can plant large amounts of the herbs you need. The herbs produced in the spirit map world are definitely of a higher quality than the ones you bought!”

“It can significantly increase the efficacy of the spirit bearing soup and body tempering soup?” Xia ruofei asked.

“That’s for sure!” Xia Qing said without the slightest hesitation.

Xia ruofei nodded and decided,”okay!” Then he’d create a spatial herb garden! Xia Qing, give me a list of the Chinese herbs you need to plant. I’ll take care of the seeds, and you’ll be in charge of the specific work of opening the herb garden. Is that okay?”
