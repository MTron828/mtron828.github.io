Elder song looked at Xia ruofei and saw him nod his head. He said,””This time! Old Liu lives in Room 301, right? You don’t need the Liu family to pick you up, you can arrange a car ... Forget it, just use my red flag car! In addition, let little Fang go with ruofei!”

Manager Lu’s eyes revealed a strange look.

“Little Fang” was Colonel Fang Zhongming, who was in charge of the security of the song family’s old house. He was also an elite trained by the central guard force, so it was needless to say that he was skilled.

Elder song sent Xia ruofei in his own car and even sent his “guard leader” to accompany Xia ruofei. Naturally, it was to protect Xia ruofei’s safety. After all, his car was a bulletproof model specially used by the central leaders. It could even withstand the attack of small bombs. But this was only one aspect. More importantly, he wanted to show the Liu family the song family’s attitude, especially elder song himself.

“I understand! I’ll make the arrangements immediately!” Manager Lu replied.

Xia ruofei chatted with elder song for a while before they went to the dining room for lunch.

Most of elder song’s children were working in other places. Even those who worked in the capital did not live in the old residence. As for his grandchildren, they were all in awe of this Grandpa who was a soldier and would not appear in the old residence if there was nothing. Even song Rui, who came with Xia ruofei, was hiding somewhere.

Therefore, elder song was alone at lunch with Xia ruofei and manager Lu.

Elder song’s body was getting stronger by the day, so his doctor was also the most idle. He basically didn’t need to take care of his medicine every day like other old Chiefs, and he didn’t need to remind them of what to avoid from time to time. Elder song’s doctor even allowed him to drink a small glass of wine every day. This was the scientific conclusion made after assessing the old man’s physical condition.

Today, elder song raised the “limit” of the glass of wine that he had originally planned for the evening to the afternoon. Then, he asked Xia ruofei and manager Lu to pour the wine and drink with him.

In fact, elder song’s health wouldn’t be affected even if he drank a few more glasses. However, he would usually follow the doctor’s advice. In his words, the children were doing it for their work, and he shouldn’t cause extra trouble for them.

The lunch was not sumptuous, but the nutritional mix was still quite good. The taste was mainly light, which was also for the sake of a healthy diet for the elderly. However, after manager Lu knew that Xia ruofei would stay for dinner, he specially asked the cook to add one or two more salty and spicy dishes, taking care of Xia ruofei’s taste.

It was rare for him to have someone to eat with him today. Furthermore, it was the young man he admired the most, Xia ruofei. Therefore, elder song was very happy.

Everyone chatted as they ate. Elder song only took a small sip each time. Basically, he just took a light sip and then put down the glass, as if he couldn’t bear to finish the wine in one go.

Xia ruofei and manager Lu couldn’t help but smile at the old man’s childish behavior.

Elder song was very talkative. The meal lasted for more than an hour, and the small glass of wine in front of him also lasted for more than an hour. In the end, when it was almost time for Xia ruofei to leave, elder song finished the last mouthful of wine.

“Ruofei, don’t think too much when you go to see old Liu.” Elder song said meaningfully,”just follow your heart! No one can force you to do anything, not even the Liu and Gao families!”

“I understand, Grandpa song!” Xia ruofei nodded.

“Go!” Eccentric song smiled. I should go and sleep for a while ...”

With that, elder song walked towards the study alone. Not only was there a huge collection of books in the study, but there was also a bed in the compartment. Sometimes, when he was late reading documents, he would directly rest in the study.

Manager Lu personally accompanied Xia ruofei to the car in the front yard.

The red flag car that had picked Xia ruofei up in the morning was ready to set off. The car had just been washed and was black and shiny under the sun. There was not a single stain on it.

A man of about 34 or 35 years old, wearing a leather jacket, stood beside the car. His eyes were sharp, and his back was straight. One look and you could tell he was a professional soldier.

Manager Lu smiled and said,”ruofei, let me introduce you. This is Colonel Fang Zhongming. He’s in charge of coordinating the security work next to the chief. This time, the chief has specially appointed Colonel Fang to accompany you.”

Xia ruofei nodded and stepped forward.””Colonel Fang, I’ll have to trouble you!”

Fang Zhongming said in a neither humble nor overbearing manner,”you’re being too serious. This is my duty!” Please get in the car!”

Xia ruofei nodded and turned to manager Lu.””Manager Lu, I’ll be on my way!”

Manager Lu smiled and nodded. He patted Xia ruofei’s shoulder and said,””Ruofei, remember the chief’s words. The song family will always be your strong backing!”

Xia ruofei’s heart felt warm. He didn’t say anything and got into the car after nodding.

Fang Zhongming immediately sat in the co – Pilot seat and said to the driver,””Go to Room 301!”

“Understood!” The driver responded, turned the steering wheel, and drove the heavy red flag sedan out of the Fang family’s old house, heading in the direction of 301 Hospital.

At 2:25, the car arrived at 301 Hospital. Fang Zhongming didn’t say a word on the way, but looked straight ahead and glanced left and right from time to time. His Eagle – like eyes showed that he was always on high alert.

In fact, there was no danger on this trip, but Fang Zhongming had already formed a professional habit.

Elder song’s car had a special license plate, so he was allowed to enter at the entrance.

The driver didn’t ask any more questions and drove the red flag car through the courtyard area with ease. They came to another courtyard area that was obviously much quieter and more heavily guarded.

At the gate of the courtyard, the car stopped for inspection. Fang Zhongming got out of the car, showed his id, and registered at the Sentry post. Soon, the car was allowed to enter.

The red – flag car stopped in front of a building. Xia ruofei saw a middle – aged man with a slightly balding head standing in front of the building. When he saw the red – flag car, his eyes clearly narrowed, and then he walked over to greet him.

Xia ruofei and Fang Zhongming got out of the car.

When the balding middle – aged man saw Fang Zhongming, he looked even more serious, but he soon showed a kind smile and said enthusiastically,””Colonel Fang, you’ve come in person!”

Fang Zhongming nodded his head and said,””Hello, chief Liu!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Then, Fang Zhongming moved to the side and Xia ruofei appeared.

The bald, middle – aged chief Liu naturally looked at Xia ruofei. The sharp intent in his eyes did not escape Xia ruofei’s eyes. Xia ruofei did not mind and continued to smile.

Chief Liu smiled and said,”this must be Mr. Xia!” Nice to meet you!”

Xia ruofei looked at Fang Zhongming.

“Mr. Xia, this is Liu Qunfeng, the head of the xxx Department,” Fang Zhongming introduced.

Xia ruofei recalled that this was undoubtedly a very important Ministry. However, among the leaders, the Minister’s surname did not seem to be Liu. It seemed that this Minister Liu was a Deputy.

However, even if it was a Deputy profession, it was still a very impressive figure.

It was obvious that this wretched – looking balding middle – aged man was one of the sons of the Liu family’s old master.

“Good day, chief Liu,” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Hello, hello!” Liu Qunfeng smiled and said,”Mr. Xia, thank you for your help ...”
