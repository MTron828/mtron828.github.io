2915 A stray dog (2)

After the negotiations between the two sides completely fell apart, Zhang Chao had been mentally prepared to die Here today. He didn’t expect things to turn around so quickly. It was too much for him to take in.

When Xia ruofei said that he wanted ERAD to kneel and kowtow in apology, Zhang Chao did not stop him because he knew that no matter what, they had already formed a grudge with the Bay group, and they would not rest until one of them was dead. China was a country of etiquette, but gentleness, frugality, and humility were also important. To a drug lord who killed without blinking an eye, there was no need to be gentlemanly and thrifty!

Today, Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng had used absolute force to suppress their opponents. Otherwise, all the Huaxia people here would not have had a good time today. Being shot to death might not have been the worst outcome. Just like what ERAD had shouted just now, many people might have suffered and been tortured to death. In order to intimidate others, this was not the first time that these drug gangs had done such things.

So, since he had already offended the other party, what was the point of forgiving the other party now?

After Xia ruofei finished speaking, he looked at ERAD quietly and said,””I forgot to remind you that this offer is only valid for one minute. If you don’t make a decision within one minute, the conditions might be even more demanding!”

ERAD pulled a long face. Why did these words sound so familiar? It was as if he had just said something similar to Zhang Chao in a very pretentious manner. This was really karma! In the blink of an eye, the other party had returned the same words to him.

ERAD’s heart was struggling. His pride made it difficult for him to accept kneeling and kowtowing to the Chinese. However, in the face of death, dignity didn’t seem to be that important? Did he want his life? Or face? He had to give an answer within a minute.

Xia ruofei put his hands in his pockets and looked at ERAD calmly.

“You have thirty seconds ... Twenty seconds ... Ten seconds ... Nine ... Eight ...”

“I accept your offer!” Finally, ERAD could not bear the heavy psychological pressure and shouted,”I’m willing to kneel and apologize!”

After shouting out these words, the pressure on ERAD was finally released. Although his dignity was about to be trampled on, he felt relaxed all over, because he no longer needed to choose to retreat.

Xia ruofei shrugged his shoulders and made a gesture of invitation with one hand. Then, he crossed his arms in front of his chest and quietly waited for him to kneel.

ERAD’s knees slowly bent, and he finally knelt on the ground with a face full of humiliation.

At this time, Madel, Sanchez, Fernando, and the others all turned their heads. They didn’t dare to watch the scene of ERAD kneeling and kowtowing to the Chinese. Although it was meaningless for them to do so, because ERAD wouldn’t think that no one knew about it just because they turned their heads and didn’t look, ERAD’s usual fierce reputation was really too scary. They also subconsciously turned their heads away.

Zhang Chao and the others couldn’t suppress the excitement in their hearts. They couldn’t help but clench their fists and stare at ERAD without blinking.

ERAD finally bent down and kowtowed for the first time.

When he straightened his body, Xia ruofei said indifferently,””Again! The sound was not loud enough! Is this how sincere you are?”

At this moment, ERAD no longer had any dignity to speak of. However, his heart was like a surging volcano. It was just that it was suppressed and could not erupt at this moment. His hatred for the Chinese had long reached an extreme degree.

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, he gritted his teeth and kowtowed heavily. His forehead hit the cold concrete ground with a bang, making him feel like his head was buzzing.

The pain on his forehead was nothing. The greatest pain was the trampling of his dignity.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,””Let’s follow this standard! Counting the one just now, there were still 17 more! Hurry up! Everyone’s busy, so let’s not dawdle!”

How could ERAD not want to end this nightmare – like experience as soon as possible?

He gritted his teeth and started to kowtow.

The entire courtyard was silent, and the sound of ERAD’s forehead hitting the concrete floor was particularly loud. To Madeline and the others, this sound was like a knock on their hearts. Every sound would make their hearts tremble. At the same time, this sound was like a death knell that rang for them, making them feel as if they were seeing their end ...

ERAD finally finished kowtowing eighteen times, each one extremely loud. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

After kowtowing, ERAD’s forehead became bruised and swollen, and with his swollen cheeks, his face had completely changed shape, like a pig’s head.

He didn’t stand up immediately. Instead, he knelt on the ground and looked at Xia ruofei. It could be said that he was extremely humble.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”he’s flexible. He’s quite a character!” You can get lost now! However, before you leave, clean up the trash in this yard!”

The yard of Huafeng shipping was cleaned by someone every day. Although it was not spotless, there was no garbage.

Xia ruofei was talking about the bodyguards who were lying on the ground.

ERAD got up from the ground as if he had been pardoned. He glared at medel and said,””Get all these people into the car! Hurry up!”

Madeline trembled and quickly organized the bodyguards to help each other into the car.

Fortunately, the drivers did not come out. Otherwise, with so many cars, even the drivers would not be able to gather together. This was because almost all the bodyguards had lost their ability to move and could not drive at all.

Since Xia ruofei had spoken, ERAD didn’t dare to get into the car before the “garbage” was cleaned up. It wasn’t until all the bodyguards were stuffed into the car that he bowed to Xia ruofei and walked to his car. He didn’t pay attention to Sanchez, Fernando, and the others during the whole process, which made the politicians even more nervous.

During this process, it was not that ERAD did not have any evil thoughts. More than once, he thought of suddenly pulling out his gun and firing a few shots at Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng. As long as he could kill Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng, the remaining Huaxia people were nothing to be worried about. However, on one hand, he was really scared out of his wits. On the other hand, he felt as if someone was staring at him, as if he was being stared at by a venomous snake. He did not dare to act rashly.

He had already endured the humiliation of kneeling and kowtowing, so he didn’t dare to risk it again.

In the end, ERAD restrained his killing intent and got into his car obediently.

No one greeted the politicians, but they were not stupid. They all got into their cars.

When they came, they had made a big scene, all of them high and mighty, but when they left, they ran away like stray dogs.

The courtyard of Huafeng shipping company was quiet again. Zhang Chao and the others still felt like they were in a dream. It was not until the last car drove away in a hurry that Zhang Chao came back to his senses. He quickly arranged,”Ah Qiang! Immediately organize an evacuation! Don’t bring anything, just pack up the cash and important documents in the safe and leave! We can’t stay here any longer!”

Then, Zhang Chao said to Xia ruofei in a hurry,””Mr. Xia, thank you for today! If it wasn’t for you, I’m afraid none of our brothers would have survived! However, these drug lords are very brutal. We have completely offended them today. Their revenge will come very quickly, and it will definitely be a destructive revenge! That’s why we have to leave immediately!”

He did not wait for Xia ruofei to speak and said urgently,””We happen to have a truck as a tow truck. Let’s move your container first, and you can check the goods when we reach a safe place! At that time, we’ll think of a way to send the two of you out of the country! We’ll be completely safe then!”

Zhang Chao was indeed very anxious. He knew that as soon as he stepped out of this door, ERAD would definitely make a crazy call and order all the armed forces of the Bay group in quachaquarkus to gather and wipe out Huafeng shipping as soon as possible. So, the ferocious militants could appear at any time, and every second of delay would put his life in danger.
