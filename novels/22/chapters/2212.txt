Xia ruofei returned home feeling uneasy.

Now, he regretted “peeking” at Ling Qingxue and Song Wei’s conversation on the yacht. If he didn’t know that Song Wei had come to the three mountains to meet Ling Qingxue, he wouldn’t be so troubled.

Xia ruofei was also having an internal struggle.

Should he rush to the airport to take a look? Would these two girls fight? One of them was at refined Qi Level 4, while the other was at refined Qi Level 3. Their spiritual power cultivation was about the same. If they really had a conflict, the destructive power would not be small.

Besides, he would feel heartache no matter who he hurt.

Xia ruofei was confident that even though the two girls were cultivators, he would not be discovered if he were to “monitor” them without anyone knowing.

He hesitated for a long time, but in the end, he gave up.

Xia ruofei made up his mind. Do whatever you want! Anyway, things had already come to this. Now, it was equivalent to playing cards openly. As for the final result, he would let them discuss it among themselves!

After thinking it through, Xia ruofei decided to throw all the distracting thoughts out of his mind. He went to the master bedroom upstairs and filled the bathtub with water. He took off his clothes and stepped in, deciding to take a bath first.

After soaking in the bathtub with a massage function for more than half an hour, Xia ruofei finally got up and wiped the water off his body. Then, he changed into a comfortable Coral Fleece Bathrobe and went to the bedroom in his slippers.

He threw himself onto the bed and couldn’t help but look out of the dark window again. He let out a long sigh.

Usually, at this time, Xia ruofei would have already gone to bed if there were no special circumstances.

Although he had left the Army, he still maintained a regular routine.

However, he had something on his mind today, so he didn’t feel sleepy at all.

She leaned on the bed in boredom and read the news for a long time until there were no more new articles on the front page. Then, she threw her phone aside and closed her eyes in a daze.

After an unknown period of time, Xia ruofei seemed to have heard a knock on the villa door.

The vigilance he had maintained for many years made him sober up at once. He didn’t move, but he instantly released his spiritual force.

His spiritual power had reached the level of spirit gathering, so he could easily cover the entire villa with his spiritual power.

The next moment, Xia ruofei’s mouth was wide open in shock as he examined the situation. Ling Qingxue’s car slowly drove in, and the doors on both sides opened almost at the same time. Ling Qingxue and Song Wei stepped out of the car together.

“What’s the situation?” Xia ruofei had a question in his mind.”Why did they come back together?” Do you want to lay your cards on the table?”

Downstairs, Ling Qingxue and Song Wei had already entered the villa one after another. The sound of footsteps could be heard from the stairs.

Xia ruofei realized that they had gone upstairs.

At this moment, Xia ruofei quickly made a decision and pretended to be asleep.

It would be so awkward to see the two of them at this time! Xia ruofei did not know what to say.

He had imagined all sorts of scenarios where Ling Qingxue and Song Wei would meet, including the two of them getting into a fight over a disagreement, or one of them deciding to leave him, or even the worst case scenario where the two of them would never talk to him again.

However, he did not expect that these two girls, who were not as incompatible as fire and water, would come to his house together. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

One had to know that it was already the middle of the night!

Xia ruofei closed his eyes and listened to their footsteps as they walked towards the master bedroom.

“This guy must be sleeping ...” Ling Qingxue’s voice could be heard clearly.”We’re both heartbroken, but he’s acting like nothing has happened. I’m so angry ...”

“I don’t think so,” Song Wei replied weakly. His cultivation is much higher than ours, so how could he not hear us?”

“Could it be ... He’s pretending to be asleep?” Ling Qingxue said immediately.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but sweat. Indeed, women shouldn’t be together. How long had they been together? His IQ had obviously increased by a few percent!

He knew he couldn’t pretend anymore. Even if he didn’t get up now, Ling Qingxue and Song Wei would definitely come in.

Rather than that, it was better to take the initiative.

Xia ruofei sat up on the bed.

Outside the door, Ling Qingxue and Song Wei looked at each other. Then, Ling Qingxue took a step forward and was about to turn the doorknob to open the door.

At this moment, the ball lock on the door turned on its own, and the door opened gently without any wind.

The two of them looked into the room and saw Xia ruofei sitting at the head of the bed in his sleeping robe. He had an awkward but polite smile on his face.

After seeing the two of them, Xia ruofei laughed dryly and waved his hand at them.””Um ... Good evening!”

The moment Song Wei saw Xia ruofei, her face turned red and her eyes turned red.

Ling Qingxue glared at Xia ruofei and said,””What’s so good about it? I’m very bad!”

Xia ruofei scratched his head and said,”yes, yes, yes. It’s all my fault ...”

Song Wei’s head was slightly lowered. When she heard Xia ruofei’s voice, she quickly looked up at him and lowered her head again with a red face.

Ling Qingxue looked straight at Xia ruofei and said,””Hey! The guests are already at the door, is this how you treat them? You didn’t even get off the bed to welcome us, nor did you invite us in. Are you just going to let us stand at the door and talk?”
