2563 Hot search killer (2)

Xia ruofei: “smiley face””smiley face” no matter what, objectively speaking, it has indeed affected your work. I wanted to give you a ball for yesterday’s game, but I only took one ball yesterday. It was a hat – trick, so I’ll keep the ball for myself! That’s why I changed it to the Jersey I wore yesterday. I hope you don’t mind.

City Siege Lion: “President Xia, you’re too kind!” Why would I dislike it? I’m so happy that I’m going crazy. I can’t express my excitement with words. Thank you, President Xia!

Xia ruofei replied,”you’re welcome, you’re welcome ...”

After the netizens saw the screenshot of the private message, they all praised Xia ruofei for being approachable.

Some of Xia ruofei’s fans liked to call him “overbearing President”. This somewhat vulgar nickname was also widely circulated. So, those who did not know Xia ruofei well would subconsciously think that Xia ruofei was a little cold and overbearing when they saw this nickname.

This was a preconceived prejudice, and it was human nature. Xia ruofei could not change it, and of course, he had no intention of changing it. He had never cared too much about what others thought of him. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The private message that “the lion that can siege” had screenshotted changed many people’s impression of Xia ruofei.

After Xia ruofei replied to “the lion that can attack the city” ‘s private message, he stopped paying attention to Weibo. His Weibo would receive a large number of private messages, comments, likes, and mentions every day. If he looked at and dealt with every single one of them, he would not have anything else to do for the rest of the day.

Xia ruofei gave Jiang Xiaochen a call and told him that he was going to give the Jersey to “the lion that can attack cities”. He also sent the address to Jiang Xiaochen and asked him to arrange for the staff to mail it back to China.

Just as Xia ruofei was about to head downstairs for breakfast, Feng Jing, who had stayed behind at the company headquarters, called.

It should be around noon in China. To be precise, it should be around one or two in the afternoon. Feng Jing had called at this time, so she must have calculated the time difference and knew that Xia ruofei should have just woken up.

“Sister Che!” Xia ruofei answered the call with a smile.

“RUO Fei, you’re good!” Feng Rao chuckled.”You became a big star overnight!”

“Where? Where!” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”he’s just average. He’s far from Messi’s C – list!”

Feng Rao couldn’t help but say,”you’re the most irresponsible boss I’ve ever seen!” You don’t usually appear in the company and run around all day. This time, you actually went to Spain to play a game? Don’t tell me you’re going to play professional football in the future!”

“I won ‘t!” Xia ruofei quickly said,”I’m thinking about our company! I’m just playing around, how can I stay here forever?”

“You can play a hat – trick by kicking!” Feng Rao said,”what if you kick seriously?”

“Naturally, I’ll kill any God or Buddha that blocks my way!” Xia ruofei said without hesitation,”even if it’s bar?a, I can break their goal!”

“You’ve really gotten into character!” Feng Jing pouted and said,”don’t forget that you’re still the head of paradise Corporation and the backbone of everyone. Don’t get so happy that you forget your home!”

“How could that be!” Xia ruofei said,”I’m going to return to China with Xue Jinshan and the others. I may help the Spanish play a few games in the future, but I definitely won’t stay here for too long.”

“That’s good ...” Feng Jing heaved a sigh of relief.

Xia ruofei, her boss, really worried her to death. He usually did not do his job and did not care much about the company’s business. What was more, he often disappeared. She was really worried that Xia ruofei would be hot – headed and change his career to a professional player.

Feng Rao continued,”ruofei, you don’t say ... After this match, you’re almost the king of popularity!” In the future, our company doesn’t need to hire a spokesperson at all. You can just be the spokesperson for yourself, hehehe ...”

Xia ruofei touched his nose and smiled.””I’ll feed myself a bag of salt? Aren’t you afraid that I’ll be struck to death?”

Feng Ye was stunned for a moment before he realized what Xia ruofei meant. He couldn’t help but burst out laughing.

“I’m serious, ruofei. “Feng Rao continued. Your popularity right now is simply too explosive. If you don’t make use of it, it would be a waste of God’s gift! I have a preliminary idea. Can you organize a lucky draw event on your personal Weibo account and our company’s official account? The prize would be your Espanyol jersey or the area around some other team. I think the Spanish clubs will design some of your exclusive peripheral products!”

“The number 25 Jersey is already on sale. The peripheral products should also be in the design phase. I think they will be released soon.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ll leave it to you to make the arrangements. I have no objections.” Anyway, Yanan and the others can also log in to my Weibo account. As for the prizes, other than the Jersey I wore last night, there are no problems with the rest. I’ll just let the club know. ”

“I was just about to talk about that Jersey! That Jersey has a very high commemorative value. If it can be used as a grand prize, it will definitely attract a lot of people!” Feng ke said.

“I’ve already given this Jersey away!” Xia ruofei said,”it seems like sister ran doesn’t care about me enough! I gave out this Jersey on Weibo!”

After that, Xia ruofei briefly told Feng Jing about the “city – attacking Lion”.

Feng Rao’s pretty face became slightly hot as she said,””That’s fine too. The publicity will be even better this way. I’m sure your Weibo account will gain a lot of fans this time!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”Sister che, we don’t have to worry about sales. Why are you so keen on online marketing?”

“You don’t know how expensive rice and firewood are!” Feng Jing said coyly,”right now, our products are in short supply, but the pharmaceutical factory’s production scale will expand by several times soon. Don’t we need to digest this production capacity? And what if we launch new products in the future? Having a big V account, the publicity effect is much better than spending money on advertisements. I’m just preparing for a rainy day!”

“Yes, yes, yes! Sister ran is far – sighted, I admire you!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”anyway, we’ll do as you’ve planned! I have no objection ... Also, I’ll be back in two days, so let’s talk face to face!”

“Alright! Then we’ll talk about it after you come back!” Feng Rao said straightforwardly.

After Xia ruofei hung up the phone, he changed into a set of casual sportswear and went downstairs for breakfast.

To Xia ruofei’s surprise, many people had already remembered him after yesterday’s match. There were even two fans asking for his autograph at the entrance of the buffet restaurant.

Xia ruofei didn’t put on any airs. He immediately signed for them and agreed to take a picture with them.

Feng Jing’s style had always been Swift and decisive. Under her arrangements, Xia ruofei’s personal account and the peach blossom company’s official account quickly displayed the lucky draw event.

The condition to join the event was to follow the account and tag two friends.

The prize was a set of No. 25 Spanish home Jersey.

This series of actions had increased the number of fans on peach blossom company’s official Weibo. There was no need to mention Xia ruofei’s personal account. The number of fans had already exceeded 50 million. He was considered a very influential big V on the Weibo platform.

On Weibo’s hot search list,#Xia ruofei’s hat – trick in La Liga #was the most popular topic. Half a day had passed and it was still at the top of the hot search list.

Xia ruofei’s heroic image seemed to be more popular with the netizens than those young and fresh meat.

Under this topic was a certain popular young hunk who had almost no works, as well as a celebrity couple who had just announced their divorce.

These people had more or less bought the hot search through different channels, but they did not expect the competition on the hot search list to be so fierce. They did not even see any hope of reaching the top because the hot topic #Xia ruofei’s hat trick in La Liga #was still rising in a steep curve and did not seem to be declining at all.

Hence, Xia ruofei was given the nickname ‘the hot search killer’!

As long as she competed with him for the trending Searches, even if he didn’t spend a single cent and his competitors spent a lot of money to hire entertainment public relations companies to operate, the final result would still be Xia ruofei’s victory ...
