Chapter 337: I can cure (1)

“Brother Xia!” Jiang Yue called out worriedly. Lu You also frowned and said,”Xia ruofei, why did you agree to compete with him?” This orchid is mine, and Yueyue and I have been taking care of it. We can decide for ourselves!” Peng Hui smiled hypocritically at the side: “Lu You, don’t tell me you have no confidence in expert Xia? He had already agreed to it! Besides, there’s strength in numbers. I’m doing this for the sake of our gardening club, aren’t I?” Lu You snorted coldly and ignored Peng Hui. You Jun looked at Xia ruofei with hostility and mocked,””Specialist Xia, if you don’t dare, it’s not too late to regret it now. There’s a beauty to protect you anyway ...” Xia ruofei glanced at you Jun and Peng Hui indifferently. This kind of low – Level provocation was extremely childish in Xia ruofei’s eyes. He didn’t even have the interest to respond. These people were only university students, while Xia ruofei had experienced life and death situations on the battlefield and was diagnosed with a terminal illness. His mentality was completely different from these greenhouse flowers in an ivory tower. Moreover, he could talk and laugh with senior officials in the political world such as elder song, Tian Huilan, and big shots in the business world such as MA Xiong and Tang He. Therefore, although he was only a few years older than Peng Hui and the others, these people were no different from children in his eyes. Chen Song saw that Xia ruofei did not go back on his words and looked at Xia ruofei arrogantly. He said,””Mr. Xia, I’ve examined this pot of orchids carefully just now. Now, we’ll give you some time. You should take a good look too!” Xia ruofei walked to the pot of orchids and took a casual look at it. “”That’s enough, you go first!” Chen Song could not help but be stunned. He said,”You ... You’re done?” Xia ruofei nodded. “You’re not joking with me right?” Chen Song frowned and said,”the condition of this pot of orchids is very complicated. You can understand everything with just a glance?” “This is my business.” Xia ruofei said indifferently,”since you want to have a competition, then tell me your opinion first.” “Hmph!” Chen Song coldly snorted and said,”if that’s the case, then I’ll throw the brick to lure the Jade!” After he finished, he cleared his throat and pointed at the pot of orchid.””It’s obvious that this pot of orchid is a Black Orchid. Although the Black Orchid is a relatively common type of orchid, this pot of Black Orchid is not ordinary. If I’m not wrong, this should be one of the ten wondrous flowers of the Black Orchid, the ‘jade lion’. Everyone, look. Its flower shape is like the rising wind of a Green Lion. This is the distinctive feature of the Jade lion. ” Hearing this, Xia ruofei still had an indifferent expression. Peng Hui and you Jun were originally looking at Xia ruofei with a smug expression, but when they saw Xia ruofei’s nonchalant expression, the two of them suddenly felt bored and looked away at the same time. Lu You frowned.”There’s no need to say much about the breed of this pot of Black Orchid. Everyone in the gardening club knows it very well.” Lu You’s words naturally meant that Peng Hui and you Jun had told Chen Song in advance. Chen song’s expression slightly froze. He quickly continued,”Then let’s talk about the situation of this jade lion! I think it’s leaf blight. Look, there are obvious grayish – Brown spots on the leaves, and the area of the spots is very large. Some of the leaves have already withered and fallen off. It’s obvious that the disease is very serious. ” When Chen Song said this, he looked at Xia ruofei, who had a normal expression, and continued,””As for the suggestions on how to handle it, first of all, you have to stop watering the orchids and spray 75% of the hundred – fungi wetter powder, 600 times liquid, once every ten days or so, two to three times in a row! In addition, to prevent the spread of the disease, the pots of orchids next to it should also be sprayed with 1:100 drops of Bordeaux mixture. ” “I’m done. Expert Xia, it’s your turn to give your opinion!” Chen Song said as he looked at Xia ruofei. You Jun immediately shouted,””See that? Senior brother Chen’s analysis was very reasonable, and there was also a feasible treatment plan. This was what a professional should do! Some people call themselves experts. I’m afraid they can’t even tell what illness Mo Lan has!” “Expert Xia, if you really don’t know how to do it, then just repeat what senior Chen said!” Peng Hui also said sarcastically. Before Xia ruofei could say anything, Lu You glanced at the two of them as if they were idiots. Then, Lu You said,”are you done?” Don’t you feel that what this senior brother Chen said sounds familiar?” Peng Hui and you Jun were both stunned. “What do you mean?” Chen Song asked with a slight frown. Jiang Yue, who was standing beside Lu You, also reacted. She immediately shouted,””I remember now! This was almost exactly the same as the analysis of teacher Liu from the School of Bioengineering a few days ago! We also used something called hundred bacteria control, but it didn’t have any effect!” Peng Hui’s expression changed slightly. He tried to recall carefully and realized that Jiang Yue was right. Chen song’s analysis and solution were almost the same as what teacher Liu had said a few days ago. What was even worse was that the gardening club had already followed teacher Liu’s instructions and sprayed a hundred – Junqing solution. However, not only did Mo Lan not recover, her condition seemed to have worsened. In other words, Xia ruofei did not even need to say anything. It was clear that Chen song’s analysis and solution were wrong! How did this happen? Peng Hui cried out in his heart. At this moment, you Jun also snorted coldly and said,”So what if it’s the same? Senior brother Chen and teacher Liu were both professionals in this, so it was normal for their judgment to be similar! However, there’s an expert who hasn’t expressed his opinion yet!” Lu You was very disappointed with the top student of the Agriculture and Forestry University that Peng Hui had invited. Initially, after listening to Peng Hui’s introduction, Lu You had a faint trace of anticipation in her heart. She did not expect that Chen Song would not come up with an effective method at all. Instead, he mentioned some methods that had already been tested and failed. Lu You couldn’t help but look at Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei smiled and pointed at the pot of orchid.””I’m not as long – winded as this student. I only have one thing to say: I can cure Mo Lan’s illness!” What? Peng Hui and the other two looked at each other. This was an expert? There was no analysis, just one sentence: I can cure it! He couldn’t be selling great strength pills on the streets, right?! Cure all diseases? This was too much of a joke! Chen Song couldn’t help but ask,”Mr. Xia, tell me how you’re going to treat it!” You’re telling me that you can cure her?” Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”why not?” Wasn’t the analysis all for the sake of treating this pot of mo orchid? I told you I can cure it!” “I think you’re just bragging!” Chen Song sneered. Even I, a professional in this field, can’t see the real problem of this pot of orchids, and you can tell with just a glance? Since you already know, why don’t you dare to tell everyone?” Xia ruofei smiled and did not say anything. He did not want to respond to Chen song’s question. “I’m the gold medal winner of the last Southeast province flower exhibition!” Chen Song said,”may I know what awards you’ve won?” “I can cure the disease of this orchid.” “I’m an outstanding graduate from the school of landscaping. I’m guaranteed a postgraduate degree this year. My supervisor is also an expert in orchid cultivation!” “I can cure the disease of this orchid.” “I’ve dealt with several large – scale orchid pests and diseases, and I’ve succeeded every time!” “I can cure the disease of this orchid.” “Can’t you change your words? Do you only know how to say this?” Chen Song had an impulse to go berserk. “I can cure the disease of this orchid ...”
