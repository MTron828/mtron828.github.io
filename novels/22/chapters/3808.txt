Chapter 3809  Zhenyuan pill (1)

  There were already many arrays set up on the terrace of green travel Immortal Island, so Xia ruofei did not need to do any more.

  His mind communicated with the mansion - guarding wooden tablet. His figure flashed and directly entered the immortal Island, directly appearing in the green immortal abode.

  Xia ruofei didn't immediately find a courtyard to go into seclusion. Instead, he walked to the bottom of a Pavilion with ease. The pavilion was made of bamboo, the kind of purple black bamboo that was commonly seen in the Azure immortal abode. There was a pool beside the pavilion, and a small path led to the bamboo forest not far away. The environment was very quiet.

  Xia ruofei went up to the attic, opened a cabinet, and took out a Jade bottle.

  He stood in front of the window of the attic and looked around. He found that the environment here was very good. Through the bamboo forest, he could vaguely see the distant sea. From the other side, he could also see the ancient buildings from the high ground.

  Xia ruofei pondered for a moment and decided to cultivate in seclusion in this attic.

  Thus, he put down the Jade bottle and went downstairs to set up layers of protective arrays, alarm arrays, sound - proof arrays, and so on. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

  Then, Xia ruofei returned to the outside world and pointed out to Song Wei and Ling Qingxue the building where he had been in seclusion.

  After all, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue were free to enter and exit the Azure immortal abode. In order to prevent them from accidentally barging into his closed - door cultivation place, Xia ruofei naturally had to inform them in advance.

  After giving his instructions, Xia ruofei returned to the pavilion in green touring immortal abode.

  He took out a Jade futon from the spirit map space and placed it on the floor of the attic.

  Then, he reached out to take the Jade bottle, gently broke the barrier on the Jade bottle, and pulled out the bottle stopper.

  Xia ruofei poured out a white pill that was emitting a sweet fragrance from the Jade bottle. His eyes could not help but reveal a trace of eagerness.

  This elixir was very famous. It was called the "Zhenyuan elixir." Even in the golden age of the cultivation world, the Zhenyuan elixir was a very precious elixir. This Jade bottle was one of the many cultivation resources and treasures that bi youzi had left for Xia ruofei. There were only three Zhenyuan elixir in the Jade bottle.

  The effect of the essence enhancing pill was actually very simple and crude. It could increase the cultivation of a cultivator without any side effects. The cultivators who were most suitable to take the Zhen Yuan pill were the Golden core cultivators. This was because the effects of the Zhen Yuan pill were too strong for Qi refining cultivators. For a cultivator in the nascent Soul Stage, the enhancement of cultivation brought by the Zhen Yuan pill was very little. The effect was not obvious.

  After Xia ruofei had completely taken control of the green touring immortal abode, he had already discovered this bottle of Zhenyuan pills. He had seen records about the Zhenyuan pills in many cultivation manuals, so he recognized it at a glance.

  Xia ruofei was more eager to break through to the nascent Soul Stage, so he decided to keep the three essence enhancing pills for his closed - door cultivation. Thus, he left them where they were and did not organize them with other treasures and resources.

  Xia ruofei sat cross - legged on the Jade futon, then took out a large number of purple Yuan crystals and placed them around him. After doing all this, he took a deep breath, opened his mouth, and swallowed the essence enhancing pill in his hand.

  As soon as the primordial enhancement pill entered his stomach, Xia ruofei felt a warm current rising from his dantian.

  He quickly closed his eyes and concentrated, skillfully circulating the "great Dao Arts" technique, and continuously absorbing the thick energy released by the primordial enhancement pill.

  After about an hour, the medicinal properties of the Zhen Yuan pill were completely absorbed.

  Xia ruofei let out a long breath and checked his cultivation level. His eyes were filled with joy. In just an hour, his cultivation level had increased by a large margin. If he cultivated step by step, he would need at least two months of closed - door cultivation to achieve such an effect.

  One should know that Xia ruofei's cultivation environment was blessed by the heavens, much better than the so - called paradisiacal lands of many cultivation sects. Furthermore, he used purple Yuan crystals to cultivate without caring about the cost. Under such circumstances, his cultivation would increase by a lot after two months of closed - door cultivation. It was many times better than ordinary cultivators who cultivated in an ordinary environment with spiritual crystals or even spiritual stones.

  Besides, due to the special nature of the purplish - Gold golden elixir, it was much more difficult for Xia ruofei to improve his cultivation than ordinary cultivators.

  This Qi replenishing pill could save Xia ruofei two months of cultivation time. The effect was quite amazing.

  Xia ruofei was very satisfied with the effect of the primordial enhancement pill. The ninth Dragon - shaped elixir pattern on the purplish - Gold golden elixir was getting brighter and clearer. This was the last elixir pattern on the surface of the purplish - Gold golden elixir. As long as this elixir pattern was completely lit up, he would be able to break through to the nascent soul realm.

  Xia ruofei continued to work hard. Without hesitation, he poured out the second elixir from the Jade bottle and threw it into his mouth.

  He was probably the only one who ate the Zhen Yuan pill like it was candy.

  Once the Pearl entered his stomach, Xia ruofei immediately lowered his head and immersed himself in cultivation.

  This time, he circulated the "black origin Scripture".

  The mystic essence Scripture and the great Dao Sutra were undoubtedly the top cultivation techniques in the world of cultivation. Although the mystic essence Scripture's cultivation effect was slightly worse than the great Dao Sutra, if one kept cultivating the great Dao Sutra, the effect would not be that good after a long time. Furthermore, by taking turns to cultivate the two techniques, Xia ruofei could retain the freshness to the greatest extent and it seemed that the cultivation effect would be better.
