Chapter 219: Chapter 215 – beat him to death_1

What kind of person was song Zhengping? He immediately felt that something was wrong and couldn’t help but ask,””What’s wrong, manager Lu? What’s going on?” “Chief Judge song, it’s a bit complicated. Let’s go upstairs and see the Bureau chief first!” Manager Lu said with a bitter smile. I’ll explain it to you later ...” Song Zhengping suppressed the questions in his heart and nodded.”Alright,” he said. The group of them went upstairs. When they arrived at elder song’s ward, Xia ruofei and Xu Wu were walking out of the doctor’s lounge next door. “Staff officer Xu, hurry up and come back!” Xia ruofei said,”I need it urgently.” “Understood!” Xu Wu replied in a clear voice and jogged downstairs with the list. Xia ruofei smiled and greeted manager Lu and the rest. Song Zhengping had never seen Xia ruofei before. He asked,””Manager Lu, this is ...” “Oh! Chief Judge song, let me introduce you, this is Xia ruofei, Dr. Xia!” Manager Lu quickly said,”it was because of doctor Xia’s timely treatment that the chief’s condition was stabilized!” Manager Lu then said to Xia ruofei,””Doctor Xia, this is song Zhengping, the head of the judges of Xiang Nan Province. He is the eldest son of the Bureau chief.” “Hello, Chief Judge song!” Xia ruofei greeted song Zhengping with a smile. His attitude was neither humble nor arrogant. “Thank you! Doctor Xia, you’ve worked hard. ” Song Zhengping said sincerely. “You’re too kind, Chief Judge song. ” Xia ruofei smiled.”Let’s go see the chief first! His condition is quite stable now, so you don’t have to worry too much. ” “Okay, thank you, Dr. Xia,” song Zhengping said with a nod. The group walked into elder song’s room. Squad leader Lu was the only one guarding the room. He stared unblinkingly at the monitor. This was the task that Xia ruofei had just given him. Once the device rang an alarm, he had to feed elder song the Chinese medicine in the porcelain bottle. Squad leader Lu immediately stood at attention and saluted when he saw song Zhengping and the others enter. Song Zhengping nodded slightly and walked to elder song’s bed. Song Rui quickly followed. Song Zhengping’s eyes reddened when he saw his father’s Haggard face. He stood quietly by the bed and stared at elder song. Song Rui stood there obediently as well. The others stood quietly at the side, not bothering song Zhengping. After a long while, song Zhengping slowly reached out and gently touched elder song’s wrinkled forehead. He tidied up a lock of hair for him, then straightened up and gently wiped the corner of his eye. “Let my father rest!” Song Zhengping said. Let’s go out and talk. ” They went to the doctor’s lounge next door. Song Zhengping sat in the middle of the sofa and asked,””Manager Lu, why don’t I see Xiao Liang and the others? Why isn’t there a single nurse in my father’s ward? Tell me, what happened?” Song Zhengping had long noticed that the atmosphere was a little off, but it wasn’t convenient for him to ask in elder song’s room. Manager Lu and Tian Huilan looked at each other. In the end, manager Lu said,””Chief Judge song, regarding this matter ... I have to reflect on it first. Director Liang from the medical group has been temporarily detained by the people I sent. He’s in the big conference room on the first floor ...” “Oh?” Song Zhengping raised his eyebrows and looked at Xia ruofei thoughtfully. Then, he asked,”what’s going on?” Song Rui, who was at the side, could not help but ask,””Uncle Lu, is second Liang up to something again? That guy is really digging his own grave!” Song Rui and Liang Haitao both grew up in Beijing. They were both part of the third generation of the red generation. They saw each other often in the circle and could be said to know each other quite well. Liang Haitao was second in his family and people in the circle usually called him second young master Liang. However, song Rui and Liang Haitao had never really gotten along, so he always called him second Liang. Song Zhengping frowned and turned to look at song Rui sternly. Song Rui immediately shrank his neck and stopped talking. “Big brother song,” Tian Huilan said,”this matter actually has something to do with me. “I heard that elder song is in a critical condition. I also know that Xiao Xia’s medical skills are good, especially for some difficult diseases, so I decided to bring him here to check on elder song and see if there’s any way to treat him ...” “Thank you, Huilan,” song Zhengping said, nodding.”I thank you on behalf of my family and my father!” “Big brother song, you’re too polite.” Tian Huilan said with a smile. Song Zhengping was a little confused.””But this is a good thing! Manager Lu, why did you ...” Manager Lu smiled bitterly.”Director Liang doesn’t like others to interfere in Medical Affairs. Moreover, Dr. Xia is a Chinese medicine doctor. Director Liang...Has some prejudice against Chinese medicine. So when I asked Dr. Xia to come for a consultation, director Liang flatly refused.” Manager Lu paused and observed song Zhengping’s expression before continuing,””Then, the chief’s condition suddenly worsened. Director Liang performed an emergency rescue and stabilized the situation for the time being. It was also at that time that he judged that the chief might ... Not be able to hold on for much longer, so he asked me to rush you guys again ...” Then, manager Lu told song Zhengping everything about elder song’s second sharp decline in vital signs, Liang Haitao’s decision to give up on emergency treatment, Xia ruofei’s entry into the ward, their conflict, and how Xia ruofei successfully used the Chinese medicine that she had prepared in advance to stabilize and improve elder song’s condition. Song Zhengping listened very carefully. When he heard manager Lu say that Liang Haitao had given up on saving himself and even stopped Xia ruofei from making a last – ditch attempt, his face couldn’t help but darken. Song Zhengping snorted coldly,”this Xiao Liang is really messing around!” He still wanted to suppress Chinese medicine at that time? He was already at his wit’s end, yet he didn’t allow others to try? It seems that things have been going too smoothly for the Liang family recently. Even a junior dares to be so overbearing!” The song family’s influence was much greater than the Liang family ‘s. The three brothers of the song family had already grown their wings, especially song Zhengping, who was already a governor of a region. They already had enough strength to support this huge family. Therefore, even though elder song had died this time, the song family’s overall strength was still not to be underestimated. They were still a level higher than the Liang family. The murderous intent in song Zhengping’s words made manager Lu break out in cold sweat for Liang Haitao. It was obvious that song Zhengping was going to give the Liang family a good beating. As the instigator of this incident, Liang Haitao would probably be in for a rough time when he got back. At this time, song Rui couldn’t help but stand up and say angrily,””He even dares to delay my grandfather’s life! This second Liang was too gutsy! Uncle Lu, that grandson is on the first floor, right? Find someone to bring me there, I’ll beat him to death!”Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels
