Chapter 1606: Betrothal gift (2)

Translator: 549690339

Du Qinghong also suggested,”old Ling, this jade carving isn’t too big. In fact, I suggest you wear it with you. First of all, it’s the best effect. Second, wearing it for a long time will make your aura more and more compatible with it.”

Xia ruofei nodded in agreement with du Qinghong.

Thus, Ling Xiaotian said,”then I’ll just wear it with me!” Looks like I’ll have to add a few more bodyguards, in case old du takes them away one day ...”

Du Qinghong was so angry that he laughed out loud,”you old brat!” Am I that kind of person?” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“You wouldn’t go so far as to ...” Ling Xiaotian glanced at du Qinghong and said,”but as for magic tools ... That’s hard to say!”

Du Qinghong looked at Ling Xiaotian in disdain and said,””I can’t be bothered to argue with you!”

Then, he looked at Xia ruofei eagerly and asked,””Little Xia, do you have any more of these magical artifacts? As long as it’s of a similar quality to this Zhong Kui jade carving, even if it’s just a little worse, I can buy it at a high price! Don’t worry, uncle du won’t let you suffer a loss in the price ...”

Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei thoughtfully. She knew the origin of this Jade statue the best. According to her judgment, there should be more than one such Jade statue ...

Ling Xiaotian wasn’t joking this time and said,””RUO Fei! If you really have Extra Magic tools, you should consider old du! This old man is very obsessed with Feng Shui metaphysics, the kind that can’t move at the sight of magical artifacts ...”

Xia ruofei was very calm. He quickly organized his words and said,””Uncle du, I got this jade carving from my friend. I can help you ask ...” He said.

“Alright, alright, alright!” Du Qinghong quickly said. Then I’ll have to trouble you to help me find out. Tell your friend to consider me first. I’ll definitely make sure he’s satisfied with the price!”

Du Qinghong actually knew that the friend Xia ruofei was talking about might not even exist. However, he had lived for more than half of his life and still had some EQ. He saw through it but did not say it out loud. In short, he just had to make his attitude clear. If Xia ruofei really had extra spiritual artifacts, he would naturally remember what du Qinghong had said today.

Of course, du Qinghong didn’t have much hope. Magical weapons weren’t like cabbages. It was already a miracle to have one. Could it be mass produced?

What he did not know was that Xia ruofei could actually mass – produce them.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded,”no problem!” I’ll definitely pass on uncle DU’s words to ...”

Xia ruofei did not expect that a jade carving with formation patterns could be sold for such a high price. However, he did not let money get to his head.

He knew that this was a very niche market. Although there were many fortune – tellers on the streets, most of them were swindlers and real metahumans. When compared to the population of the country, they were definitely a very niche market.

Moreover, the rarer an item was, the more expensive it would be. If he casually took out eight to ten magic tools, it would be strange if the price could go up!

Besides, Xia ruofei also judged that the reason du Qinghong was so eager to buy it at such a high price was not only because of the formation patterns, but also because of the materials and workmanship of this jade carving. If he had used other jadeite or Jade to carve the formation, the quality might not be so high.

Therefore, he needed to come down and carefully think about whether to sell it or how to sell it. Of course, he couldn’t make a definite decision now.

Ling Xiaotian said,”old du, RUO Fei, let’s come over and have a chat while we make tea. That’s right. RUO Fei, you mentioned that you wanted to discuss the winery with me.” Let’s sit down and talk!”

Du Qinghong saw that Ling Xiaotian wanted to talk business with Xia ruofei, so he said tactfully,””Old Ling, I won’t join in the fun ... It’s almost time, I’ll take my leave first!”

Ling Xiaotian smiled and said,”let’s stay for dinner!” Ruofei and I were just chatting, we didn’t talk about any trade secrets ...”

“No, no, I should go back now ...” Du Qinghong waved his hand.

Then, he said to Xia ruofei,”Xiao Xia, don’t forget what I asked you to do!” If there’s any news, no matter if it’s day or night, no matter how far it is, please inform me at once!”

Du Qinghong took out a name card and handed it to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei took the name card politely and passed his own to du Qinghong.

This business card was made by the company for Xia ruofei. He was now a Big Boss with a net worth of hundreds of millions. Furthermore, paradise corporation’s business was booming and its reputation was becoming more prominent. As the chairman of the company, it would be too low if he did not have a business card.

Du Qinghong carefully kept Xia ruofei’s business card and left.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue went to the coffee table in the guest area and sat down. Ling Qingxue very naturally began to boil water and make tea, willingly doing the service work.

Ling Xiaotian leaned back on the sofa and asked with a smile,””RUO Fei, what do you want to discuss with me?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Actually, it’s nothing much. It’s just that I’m more efficient in processing new wines now. So, I’m thinking about expanding the production scale.”

“What’s there to consider? We have to expand it!” Ling Xiaotian said happily,”do you know how popular the white wine produced by our winery is? It’s completely in a state of supply falling short of demand!”

Xia ruofei knew that Ling Xiaotian would definitely agree. However, as his elder and partner, Xia ruofei naturally had to ask for his opinion to show his respect.

“Is it okay for the winery to expand its production?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Of course!” Ling Xiaotian said,”it’s because you’ve been controlling the production at your side, so the production has not been fully developed!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel a little stunned.””So I’m the one who’s lacking in our winery’s development ...”

Ling Xiaotian laughed and asked,””Ruofei, it’s a good thing to expand the production capacity. What scale do you think is appropriate? It’ll mainly depend on your post – production capabilities. ”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”let’s increase it gradually!” I hope that we can double the final production in a few months. That shouldn’t be a problem, right?”

“Of course, no problem!” Ling Xiaotian said happily,”I’ll inform the winery in a while and get them to come up with a concrete plan!”

Then, Ling Xiaotian couldn’t help but say,””The guys at the winery will be overjoyed to hear this news ... Hahahaha!”

Ling Qingxue had finished brewing the tea and served a cup each to Xia ruofei and Ling Xiaotian. She then asked with concern,””Ruofei, can you handle doubling the production capacity?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s not a problem. I’ve never fought a battle that I’m not confident in.”

To Xia ruofei, the so – called post – production was just putting the wine into the space and using the environment with rich spiritual Qi and the power of the time formation to quickly complete the transformation of the wine.

In the past, the production rate was controlled at a relatively low rate mainly because of the limitations of space.

Now that he was able to construct an independent small space at will, it was equivalent to achieving a leap from a two – dimensional space to a three – dimensional space. The space utilization rate had increased by several times, so it was naturally easy for him to handle twice the amount of Drunken Eight Immortals wine.

Ling Qingxue had a blind trust in Xia ruofei, so she did not say anything else.

The three of them chatted as they made tea. They talked about their recent situation and soon talked about the clubhouse project in Beijing.

Ling Xiaotian attached great importance to this collaboration with Xia ruofei. It was related to the early launch of the National Strategy of the Ling Ji F & B group. It was an important step to enter the capital city.

Xia ruofei also gave Ling Xiaotian a calming pill. Although he would not be the one to carry out the project, he could still play a leading role in it. With him as the major shareholder, Ling Xiaotian did not have to worry about any problems with the cooperation with those rich Playboys.

As they were talking about this, Xia ruofei’s phone vibrated.

He took it out and looked at the caller ID. He couldn’t help but laugh.”Uncle Ling, you’re really getting what you want ... We were just chatting! Song Rui called, probably to talk about our project!”
