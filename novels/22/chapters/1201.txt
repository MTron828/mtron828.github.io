Translator: 549690339

West Winery vineyard.

Xia ruofei was led by the excited Old West as they walked between the ridges. The two of them even squatted down to check on the condition of the grape seedlings from time to time.

“Boss, the vitality of this batch of grape seedlings is really good!” Old West praised,”we haven’t found any dead seedlings so far! It’s almost certain that the survival rate is over 99%!”

Xia ruofei also saw that the two or three tender shoots that had been left on the seedlings when they were planted had already sprouted and turned into small green leaves. It was obvious that they had begun to take root and absorb nutrients.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I didn’t lie to you, did I?” Uncle Carter, you’re not worried anymore, right?”

Old West rolled his eyes and said unhurriedly,””Boss, it’s just the first and most basic step. The most important thing is how many years it will take for the grapes to bear fruit. We still don’t know how good the quality of the grapes is, and whether they can meet the requirements for wine brewing.”

“A good start is half the success!” Xia ruofei laughed.”We’re already halfway to the revival of our winery. Isn’t it worth celebrating?”

Old Wester was stunned for a moment before he laughed heartily and said,””Boss, you’re a little different from the average Chinese. In my impression, most Chinese people are low – Key, humble, and many of them are pessimist, but you’re full of optimism!”

Xia ruofei stood up and dusted off the dirt on his hands. He smiled and said,””That’s because I have absolute confidence in this batch of seedlings! Uncle Carter, perhaps it won’t take a few years for you to be completely at ease!”

“Why?” old Wester asked, puzzled.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”uncle Carter, don’t worry so much. The only thing you need to do is to take care of the grapevines here and Golden Oak winery. Use the most scientific method to manage them. Leave the rest to time!”

Old Wester shrugged and said,”alright!” I’m a professional in this area!”

“Of course! I have absolute confidence in you!” Xia ruofei said.

Xia ruofei drove Old West to the nearby vineyard of the Golden Oak winery to check on the growth of the grape seedlings. Then, he returned to Paradise Farm with a peace of mind.

Xia ruofei stayed in Australia for two more days. He went to Sydney to visit Tang Yitian’s family and guided Tang Haoran in his cultivation. Then, he took a plane back to China.

After more than ten hours of long – distance flight, Xia ruofei dragged the boarding box out of Sanshan airport.

Once they left the airport, Xia ruofei was stunned. He saw that ye Lingyun, who had come to pick them up, was standing next to Feng Rao.

“Chairman, you’ve had a long journey!” Feng Rao said with a smile.

Xia ruofei said,”CEO Feng, why did you come here personally?” What’s the matter?”

“Of course it’s a good thing!” Feng Jing smiled and said,”let’s go. We’ll talk in the car!”

The three of them got into their cars at the parking lot. Xia ruofei asked,””What’s the matter? I even let you personally pick me up from the airport. It seems like this is the first time I’ve enjoyed such treatment, right?”

“Chairman, the second round of sales for our jaded skin cream has just ended,” Feng Jing said happily.”The situation is quite good!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”just for this?” Why don’t you just call me and tell me, or wait until I get back to the company?”

“This matter isn’t important?” Feng Jing looked at Xia ruofei coyly and said,”just like our previous judgment, after about half a month of preparation, the public opinion of the jaded skin cream did not decline. Instead, it rose. As the first batch of users started to use it, the magical effect of the jaded skin cream was revealed. The number of discussions on the internet went up all of a sudden!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Feng Rao was very excited. She continued,””Other than a few internet ghostwriters of unknown origins, most of them have positive comments. Many popular posts on forums and big vs on Weibo have posted their comments. There should be many professionals among them! They have a very high evaluation of our products!”

“This is all within our expectations!” Xia ruofei laughed.

“Then can you guess how long it took for us to sell it out this round? The stock released by the e – commerce platform is the same as last time. ” Feng Rao looked at Xia ruofei and asked with a smile.

“The last time we started ... I remember it was around two minutes?” Xia ruofei scratched his head and said,”since you’re asking me that, it must be faster ... This time ... One and a half minutes?”

“Stop guessing!” Feng Rao giggled. You definitely won’t be able to guess it! Let me tell you, it’s 59 seconds! In less than a minute, all the stocks were sold out!”

“Woof! These consumers were crazy! Our products are not cheap either!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“What is not cheap? 588 Yuan for a bottle, that’s the price of mid to high – end cosmetics, and we have so many portions. Compared to those international brands, it’s like a cabbage!” Feng Jing said,”but when it comes to effectiveness, those cosmetic products that cost thousands or even tens of thousands of yuan can’t even hold the shoes of our jaded skin cream!”

“Domineering!” Xia ruofei laughed and gave Feng Jing a thumbs up.

Feng Rao smiled in embarrassment and continued,””Chairman, you don’t know this, but once the sales time is up, the back – end orders skyrocketed. I’m even worried that the platform’s server won’t be able to take it ...”
