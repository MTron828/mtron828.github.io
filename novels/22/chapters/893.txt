Chapter 894: A strange poison (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei was young and strong, so he was naturally faster than song Qiming.

He ran up the stairs, followed by Guangzhi Cao. Guangzhi Cao followed song Qiming.

Soon, Xia ruofei arrived at the door of Song Wei’s room. He saw a woman squatting on the ground with a young girl in her 23s or 24s in her arms.

The girl was wearing a light blue dress and had long hair that fell over her shoulders. Her eyes were closed and her face was pale. Her skin was as white as white jade and flawless. She had an exquisite oval face and her facial features were very delicate and soft. Her two faint black eyebrows made her entire person exude a classical beauty.

The woman was naturally song Qiming’s wife, Fang Liyun, and the unconscious girl was song Qiming’s precious daughter, Song Wei.

Xia ruofei quickly took two steps forward. He had no time to greet Fang Liyun and reached out to feel Song Wei’s pulse.

Song Qiming and Cao Guangzhi were already at the door. Fang Liyun was in a daze and she shouted,””Song, Weiwei ... She fainted again ...”

After all, song Qiming was an old man. He had used up a lot of energy just now, so he was panting heavily. However, he was still calm.

“Liyun, don’t be nervous. Let Xia take a look first,” song Qiming said calmly.

Only then did Fang Liyun notice the young man who had rushed over to check Song Wei’s pulse. She quickly said,”Doctor Xia, please check on Weiwei ...”

Guangzhi Cao’s eyes narrowed when he heard Fang Liyun call Xia ruofei “doctor Xia”.

His understanding of Xia ruofei was limited to the fact that Xia ruofei had opened a very famous agricultural and agricultural products company in the southeast province. In addition, he seemed to have a wide network of connections, and even Secretary song took good care of him.

Guangzhi Cao did not expect Xia ruofei to be so skilled in medicine. Even Secretary song’s family had invited him to treat Song Wei.

Xia ruofei was feeling Song Wei’s pulse with his eyes closed. After Fang Liyun interrupted him, Xia ruofei opened his eyes and said with a pleasant expression,””Auntie, don’t be nervous. Let me check on Song Wei first.”

“Liyun, please be quiet. Don’t disturb RUO Fei,” song Qiming quickly said.

“Okay, okay, okay. I won’t say anything, I won’t say anything ...” Fang Liyun said hurriedly.

Xia ruofei asked Fang Liyun to lay Song Wei flat and asked her to wait at the side.

After Song Wei laid flat on the floor, her chest appeared even more perky. Through the light blue dress, one could even see a touch of pink. Xia ruofei’s eyes quickly shifted away.

Luckily, song Qiming, his wife, and Guangzhi Cao were too anxious to notice it.

Xia ruofei quickly cleared his mind and put his hand on Song Wei’s wrist again.

Xia ruofei was no longer a rookie in Chinese medicine. His brain had long surpassed that of ordinary people. After a lot of theoretical study, he was able to draw parallels by analogy. His actual medical skills were not weaker than ordinary doctors.

After taking her pulse, Xia ruofei could feel that there was no obvious sign of illness. Although it was more stable than the average person, it was still very strong.

“No wonder even the best Chinese medical practitioner couldn’t find a cure ...” Xia ruofei thought to himself.

Song Wei’s pulse could barely be considered as liver Qi going against the flow. However, it was very weak. Xia ruofei guessed that this was not the cause of the illness. It was because after this encounter, Song Wei had suffered a certain shock. In addition, the cause of the illness could not be found. It was caused by her depressed mood.

Xia ruofei’s medical skills were not as good as the Chinese medical doctor ‘S. He only took her pulse because he wanted to feel Song Wei’s condition.

After knowing that he couldn’t find anything, Xia ruofei immediately reached into his bag and took out a small bottle of diluted solution from the space.

To song Qiming and the others, Xia ruofei had just taken out a small porcelain bottle from his bag.

Xia ruofei opened the lid of the porcelain bottle and turned his head.”Aunty, please come and help Song Wei up.”

“Alright, alright!” Fang Liyun quickly replied.

She knelt on the ground and lifted Song Wei’s upper body. She let Song Wei lean on her legs and supported Song Wei’s back with her hands so that Song Wei was in a half – lying position with her head up.

Xia ruofei reached out and pinched Song Wei’s cheek. The smooth touch made Xia ruofei’s heart skip a beat. He calmed himself down and used some force. Song Wei, who was unconscious, opened her cherry – like mouth unconsciously.

Xia ruofei quickly moved the porcelain bottle closer and carefully fed half a bottle of the petal solution.

Then, Xia ruofei stood up and said,””Aunty, please hold on for a little longer and maintain this position. Song Wei should wake up soon.”

Xia ruofei was worried that Song Wei did not have any reaction from swallowing the flower petal while she was unconscious. There was still some flower petal solution in her throat. If she laid it flat now, she would easily cough.

He was very confident in the effectiveness of the petal solution. He believed that it would take effect soon and Song Wei should be able to wake up.

“Alright! Thank you, doctor Xia. ” Fang Liyun said.

“You’re welcome,”Xia ruofei said with a smile. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Then, he stood up and asked song Qiming,””Secretary song, how long has Song Wei been in a coma? How’s the frequency?”
