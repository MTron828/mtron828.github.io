Chapter 639: Reproduction of pomfrets (3)

One had to know that the success rate of reproduction was very low with only one pair of pomfrets.

Moreover, the environment of the fish pond was also very different from the breeding environment of pomfrets. They usually lay their eggs in tributaries or lakes with slow flowing water and a sandy bottom. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

This could only be attributed to the unique environment of the spirit map space.

Xia ruofei could be said to be the absolute master in the spirit map space. With just a thought, he could see everything in the fish pond. There were a total of 583 wild kun fish in this small fish pond, and every one of them had a very strong vitality.

This pair of ray fish can really give birth! Xia ruofei said in his heart.

In this space, the growth rate of pomfrets was very fast, and there was also the factor of time flow. It seemed that this small fish pond would soon be insufficient ...

Xia ruofei had no intention of expanding the fish pond. He was already planning to bring the clam fish to the farm to cultivate.

The farm’s fish pond had been idle all this time, and it was time for it to come in handy.

However, these fish were still small. Xia ruofei was going to wait until they grew bigger and had stronger survival abilities before sending them to the outside world.

In addition, the breeding environment of pomfrets was still very particular, so he definitely could not just throw them into the fish pond.

Rays were timid to begin with, and the slightest disturbance would easily cause a large secretion of adrenaline, which would then lead to death.

In layman’s terms, he was scared to death.

In addition, there were also requirements for water temperature, Ph, illumination, etc. The fish pond must be modified and protective measures must be added.

......

This required professionals to plan and build. In the future, the breeding process would also require people with relevant professional knowledge to manage it.

Xia ruofei decided to settle this matter once he left the realm. Coincidentally, the construction team was still working on it. He could also finish the fish pond transformation and hire a few professionals to be in charge of the kun fish cultivation.

The rays that were born in the spirit map space were definitely more vigorous than the average species. Furthermore, Xia ruofei would definitely inject some of the spirit Heart Flower petal solution into the fish pond, so the success rate of breeding them would be quite high.

Xia ruofei looked at it happily for a while. Once these pomfrets were cultivated on a large scale in the outside world, it would be an objective and stable source of income for the Paradise Corporation.

Although Xia ruofei had earned quite a bit previously, he had spent another 50 million on the Jade, and his funds were stretched thin again.

However, Xia ruofei was not flustered at all because the new batch of Ironhide Dendi was about to be harvested. Xia ruofei was prepared to take some time to harvest the Ironhide Dendi in the next two days. Then, he would call Qian Lijun and ask master Luo to bring the few farm employees back to the three mountains to make a new batch of Ironhide Dendi as soon as possible.

Just as Xia ruofei was about to head to the new space, he felt his phone vibrate. Now that Xia ruofei’s spiritual power had increased, he could pay attention to the outside world to prevent anyone from accidentally barging in or missing important calls.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power ‘saw’ the caller ID. It was Feng Jing.

He left the spirit map space with a thought and picked up the phone.

“President Feng!” Xia ruofei said.

“Chairman, I have something to report to you.” Feng Jing’s tone was a little heavy.”The process of approving a new drug seems to be very complicated. Most importantly, the entire process from the development of a new drug to the release of it on the market can take six to eight years, or even more than ten years!”
