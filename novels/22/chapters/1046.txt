Xia ruofei was embarrassed, but before he could explain, Feng Jing blushed and said,””Chairman, I ... I’ll go back to my room first ...”

“Ah?” Xia ruofei was stunned and quickly said,””Oh, Okay, okay, okay ...”

Xia ruofei heaved a sigh of relief as he watched Feng Jing leave. He warned himself that he should not be so outspoken in the future even though they were close.

Xia ruofei had left everything to Feng Jing, so he was very relaxed. After Feng Jing left, he started to stroll around the luxurious Presidential Suite. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

This Presidential Suite was generally the same as the Presidential Suite of Hengfeng Jiahua Hotel in Shen Cheng. However, because Hong Kong was the headquarters of the Hengfeng group, the Hengfeng Jiahua Hotel here was more luxurious.

This was reflected in the Presidential Suite, which was bigger and more luxurious.

The entire suite had a living room, dining room, bar, study, pantry, and eight bedrooms of various sizes. The master bedroom was more than 100 square meters in size. The entire side of the Super large master bedroom was covered with floor – to – Ceiling glass. After the electric curtains were slowly pulled open, one could enjoy the beautiful scenery of Port Victoria from all angles.

The bathroom had a custom – made sauna and a large Jacuzzi. The faucet was made of pure gold, the sink was inlaid with crystals, and all the toiletries were from hermès.

There was also the ‘Hengfeng Jiahua bed’, which was hand – made with dalayi latex from the United States, as well as the unique pillowcase that was embroidered with the guest’s name in advance. All of them had the same specifications as the Hengfeng Jiahua Hotel in Shen Cheng.

In addition, the biggest difference was that the Presidential Suite of the Hengfeng Jiahua Hotel in Hong Kong had a super large terrace with an borderless spa pool. It was called a bath pool, but in fact, it was more like a small swimming pool.

Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat at the sight of the large bathtub. He immediately returned to his bedroom and changed into the swimming trunks provided by the hotel. Then, he put on his bathrobe and went to the balcony.

Xia ruofei spread out his bathrobe on the long lounge chair beside the bathtub and jumped into the large bathtub.

The bathtub was equipped with a constant temperature heating system, and the water temperature was always maintained at about 25 degrees.

Moreover, this terrace extended from the hotel building, so there was almost no shelter around it. In addition, the entire bath pool was designed without edges, so the feeling of being in the bath pool was as if the surface of the water and port Victoria below were one. It was as if they were on the vast sea, and it was indeed relaxing.

Xia ruofei swam more than ten times in a carefree manner. Then, he laid back and floated in the water, looking at the blue sky. His body and mind were completely relaxed.

Just as Xia ruofei was about to fall asleep, a melodious sound came from the smart extension beside the bathtub. Then, an electronic voice prompted,”There was a visitor, a visitor ...

Xia ruofei raised his head and saw that the LCD screen had already automatically displayed the image taken by the security camera at the door. It was Feng Jing standing at the door.

Xia ruofei was curious as to why Feng Rao would return. However, he quickly got out of the bath, wiped the water off his body, put on his bathrobe, and walked out.

When he opened the door, Xia ruofei saw Feng Jing dragging a small suitcase and carrying her laptop bag.

He couldn’t help but be stunned. His mouth was wide open for a long time before he said,”President Feng, you ... You ...”

Feng Rao glanced at Xia ruofei and said,””Didn’t you invite me to stay here? I just went back to move things!”

“Ah?” Xia ruofei was shocked.

“The chairman doesn’t welcome me?” Feng Rao asked Xia ruofei with a half – Smile.

“No, no!” Xia ruofei quickly said,”please come in!”

With that, Xia ruofei stepped aside.

Feng Rao looked at Xia ruofei, who was in a bathrobe with water droplets on his hair, and blushed.

However, she pretended to be calm and said,””I’m saving the company’s business expenses! Hengfeng Jiahua hotel’s room fees are not cheap!”

She didn’t even have the confidence to say that because she had booked a hotel nearby for this business trip. However, the Hengfeng group was very welcoming and directly arranged for her to stay at the Jiahua Hotel, where the auction would be held, without charging a single cent.

Feng Rao had considered the fact that the auction would be held here, so she had agreed after a few words of rejection for the convenience of her work.

Xia ruofei chuckled and took Feng Jing’s luggage.””CEO Feng, you can choose any of the eight bedrooms here! It’s not a problem even if you want to live in the master bedroom!”

Feng Rao glanced at Xia ruofei and said half – jokingly,””I wouldn’t dare to do that ... I’d better choose a room further away from the master bedroom!”

Xia ruofei laughed drily and walked into the room with Feng Jing.

This room was relatively small. Generally speaking, the functions of a Presidential Suite were very complete. In many cases, the VIP who stayed in the Presidential Suite was not alone. There were usually secretaries, bodyguards, and other attendants. Looking at the layout of this room, it was obvious that the bodyguards ‘rooms were used by secretaries or servants. They were usually closer to the master bedroom.

However, although the room was small, it had a complete set of functions. It also came with a separate bathroom. The beddings, toiletries, and so on were the same as the master bedroom, and it was quite luxurious.

Xia ruofei said,”CEO Feng, this room is a little small!” There are a few bigger rooms over there, do you want to ...”

“This place is pretty good!” Feng Jing sat down on the bed comfortably and even pressed down on the soft latex mattress. She smiled and said,”I’ve stayed in many super five – Star hotels, but this is my first time experiencing a Presidential Suite! It’s all thanks to the chairman!”
