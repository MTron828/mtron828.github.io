Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”in two or three months at most, our company’s headquarters will be moved to the city. I feel that the company’s human resources structure has not been straightened out. For the long – term development of the company, we need to take this opportunity to adjust it.”

“I agree!” Feng Rao agreed. Chairman, do you have any specific ideas?”

It wasn’t that Feng Jing wasn’t capable enough in the management of the company, but that the company was developing too quickly. It could be said that paradise Corporation had been on the fast track from the very beginning, and after the release of the jaded skin cream, it continued to accelerate.

In such a rapid development period, the company had many new employees and many complicated matters to handle. Even Feng Jing couldn’t make adjustments in time.

After all, she was a professional manager and Xia ruofei had to make the final decision on many things. If Xia ruofei did not take the initiative to mention the general direction, she could not overstep her boundaries.

Xia ruofei said,”my initial idea is a two – Level structure. The company headquarters will be the first level. The pharmaceutical factory and the farm will form their own subsidiary companies.”

In fact, the pharmaceutical factory and the farm business were independent, so it was more appropriate to operate separately.

Not to mention other things, just the finance department alone urgently needed to be independent. Otherwise, all the transactions of funds would have to be reviewed and approved by the headquarters, which would involve a lot of human and material resources.

Xia ruofei continued,”also, the e – commerce Department is getting more and more powerful. My opinion is to set up an independent e – commerce Department from the marketing department.”

Then, Xia ruofei explained some of his initial plans for the past two days.

This included the salary grading system, the division of departments at the headquarters, and functional tasks.

Feng Jing listened attentively. She had the same thoughts as Xia ruofei.

After Xia ruofei finished, Feng Rao said,””Chairman, I have a general idea of what you’re thinking. I’ll sort it out later and try to come up with a plan as soon as possible!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”that’s a lot of work!” “Just the organizational structure of the two subsidiaries and the personnel adjustment at the headquarters will involve a lot of things. There are many problems that need to be considered. In addition, there will be a huge shortage of manpower. The recruitment can’t wait either. It has to be done in advance.”

“I understand!” Feng Rao said. I’ll personally come up with this plan and put some of your ideas on paper. I’ll give you a specific report then! Speaking of recruiting ...”

Feng Rao couldn’t help but rub her temples. “It’s not a big problem for the bottom – Level employees. They don’t have high requirements for academic qualifications and work experience. Basically, they can do the job after on – the – Job training. However, it’s more troublesome for the management. People with academic qualifications and ability may not be willing to come ...”

“Then let’s look for a headhunting company!” Xia ruofei said,”we’re not unknown now, especially after the jaded skin cream became popular. Our company is still quite attractive! As long as the treatment is good enough, I don’t believe that we can’t recruit talents!”

“Alright!” Feng Rao nodded. Then let the headhunting company do it! They are professionals!”

“Speaking of the pay, I’ve been thinking about the incentive system for our company for the past two days. For now, I don’t have any plans to finance or go public ...” Xia ruofei said.

Feng Jing couldn’t help but smile. She knew that it was not that Xia ruofei had no plans to go public for now, but that he would never do so in the future. The company’s potential was clear. If Feng Jing were the boss, she would not be willing to give away the shares of a company that was destined to appreciate in value.

Xia ruofei continued,”I’m not going to consider empty promises like options. In addition, I’ve been injecting capital into the company during its development. So, I don’t have any plans to distribute shares to the executives.” I’ve thought about it and I’m prepared to take out a portion of the dividends to reward the senior executives, temporarily setting it as director and above!”

Feng Jing’s heart skipped a beat. The company’s net profit was very high and she was the only one in the entire company who enjoyed a 1% bonus. If Xia ruofei were to reward the executives with a portion of the bonus, it would be a great boost to everyone’s enthusiasm.

“A 5% bonus.” Xia ruofei said,”find some time and come up with a distribution plan! It’s almost the end of the year, so I’m going to announce this plan at the company’s Annual Meeting and then cash it in!”

“Understood!” Feng Rao replied crisply.

A 5% bonus didn’t seem like much, but the company’s annual net profit was so high, and there weren’t many executives at the moment. In fact, everyone could get a considerable bonus.

Furthermore, he had spent a lot of money on the building this year. Next year, the bonus would probably be several times higher than this year. After all, the company had been developing rapidly. Even Feng Jing couldn’t imagine how much it would expand in a year.

She couldn’t help but feel happy for those lucky executives.

After talking about the bonus, Xia ruofei turned to look at Feng Jing with a smile.

Feng Rao’s face heated up under Xia ruofei’s gaze. She lowered her gaze and asked,””Chairman, why are you looking at me?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”The bonus I mentioned just now is for the other executives. I’ll give you two choices.”

Feng Rao couldn’t help but look up at Xia ruofei and asked,””Me? Wasn’t it stated clearly in the contract? It’s a 1% bonus!” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“You’ve worked so hard and achieved such remarkable results. How can a 1% reward be enough?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”in order to exploit your labor better, I’ve decided to increase the intensity of the reward. If you want the horse to run, you have to let the horse eat grass! And you have to eat good grass!”

“I hate you!” Feng Rao pouted. You’re actually comparing me to a horse ...”

“Aren’t you concerned about the two choices I’ll give you?” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”if you’re not interested, just pretend I didn’t say anything ...”

“You wish!” Feng Rao immediately said,”as a boss, you have to be honest. How can you take back your words?” Tell me, what are the two choices?”

Xia ruofei stopped smiling and said seriously,””First, a fixed dividend of 3%...”

Feng Jing couldn’t help but gasp. This was equivalent to her bonus being tripled!

“Chairman, that’s too high ...” She quickly said.

“I’m not done yet ...” Xia ruofei said.”Don’t you want to hear my second plan?”

Feng Rao smiled bitterly and said,”then tell me!” But don’t scare me anymore! Your first plan already gave me a heart attack ...”

“The second proposal is two percent of the shares!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Feng Jing was completely petrified. Xia ruofei was actually planning to give her some shares! No one knew better than Feng Jing how much potential paradise Corporation had and how much money it could make. If Feng Jing were the boss, she would also hold onto all the shares tightly in her hands.

And Xia ruofei was willing to give her his shares? Feng Rao’s heart couldn’t help but beat wildly. She was shocked, but at the same time, she couldn’t help but feel a sense of sweetness.

Xia ruofei continued,”however, this 2% share is limited. It will only take effect after you have worked for the company for five years. Moreover, I personally invested in Australia’s Paradise Farm, so it is not counted as paradise corporation’s assets. Also, after the re – signing of the contract, if I invest in the company, you will also have to invest in proportion. Of course, if you don’t have enough money, you can deduct it from the dividends ...”

Feng Rao was still in shock and did not know how much she had heard from Xia ruofei.

However, Xia ruofei’s requests were reasonable, including the time limit. If there was no such restriction, Feng Jing would immediately cash out the next day after he got the shares. Who would he cry to?

Of course, Feng Jing would never do that.

After Xia ruofei finished speaking, he looked at Feng Jing quietly and asked,””Boss Feng, you can think about it carefully and tell me your decision later.”

Feng Jing came back to her senses and said,””No need, Chairman, I’ve already made my decision!”
