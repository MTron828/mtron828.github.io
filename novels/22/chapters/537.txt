Chapter 538: The perfect engraving_3

“Alright!” Feng Rao jotted down notes in her notebook as she spoke and even made a heavy mark on it.

Xia ruofei continued.”I’ll prepare the seeds myself. You have to report to me the requirements of each type of seed at least five days in advance.”

“Understood!” Feng Rao said meticulously. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Xia ruofei thought about the batch of wine from West Winery and said,””By the way, I personally bought a batch of wine from Australia this time. This batch of wine can only be imported into China under the company’s name. You can also confirm this with manager Liang later. The goods will be sent to this address ...”

As Xia ruofei spoke, he wrote down the address of the warehouse he had rented in the city on a piece of paper and passed it to Feng Jing.

“Sure, Chairman,” Feng Jing nodded.

After talking about Paradise Farm, Xia ruofei asked,””By the way, did manager li bring out the design plan these few days?”

“Manager li sent me two proposals. He wanted to come to us personally to explain the design ideas, but considering that you’re not at home, I asked him to wait a little longer.” Feng Jing asked,”do you need me to ask him to come over immediately?”

“Show me the proposal first!” Xia ruofei said after a moment of silence.

“Alright!” Feng ke said.

Then, she handed another folder to Xia ruofei and said,””I printed this. If you need an electronic version, I’ll send it to your email later.”

“No need, I’ll take a look first,” Xia ruofei said.

Xia ruofei opened the folder and looked up.”President Feng, please sit for a while. You can pour yourself some water!”

“Chairman, please take a look at the proposal! “Don’t worry about me ...”Feng Jing said with a smile.

Xia ruofei nodded and lowered his head to look at the design plan provided by manager li.

The two plans each had their own advantages. One of them paid more attention to land utilization and planned 20 modern film Greenhouse greenhouses with a width of ten meters and a length of up to 100 meters. The specifications of the greenhouses were exactly the same as the existing greenhouses on the farm, and each cost 150000 Yuan.

The other one looked more beautiful, and the road planning was more convenient. The number of greenhouses had been reduced by two, and there were only 18.

Of course, a small and medium – sized professional cold storage warehouse would be added to each plan, which would cost about 3.5 million Yuan.

In fact, there was a lot of newly rented land this time. No matter which plan was adopted, the production capacity of the farm would be greatly improved. There were only eight vegetable greenhouses currently operating on the farm.

Xia ruofei flipped through the pages and compared the two plans repeatedly. After a long time, he raised his head and said,””Boss Feng, I’m more inclined to Plan B. Although there are two fewer greenhouses, the road planning is more reasonable, and there is reserved spare land near the complex.”

“I’m sure you’ll be the one to make the decision, but I personally prefer the second plan,”Feng Rao nodded.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”great minds think alike!” Then let’s decide on plan two! However, you can contact manager li and ask him to plan another dormitory building for me. It will be built next to the mixed – use complex. ”

“Chairman, the farm’s accommodation isn’t that tight!” Feng Rao was stunned. There were still many empty rooms! There’s no need to build a new staff dormitory!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”our company’s expansion has just begun!” There was no shortage of housing at the moment, and this was only temporary. Now, he was building an employee dormitory, which would be useful after the construction was completed! “Besides, I don’t want to wait until there’s a need to start work. Since the farm needs to be built, we’ll build it together. I don’t want to hear all kinds of noise from the construction site not long after the infrastructure is completed.”

If they were to build another staff dormitory, the overall budget might reach eight or nine million Yuan. Xia ruofei’s current funds were definitely not enough, but he was not worried at all.

There was a time limit for construction, and the funds weren’t paid in one go. They were usually divided into stages. Besides, he was so close to Liang Weimin that if the funds couldn’t keep up, it wouldn’t be a big deal to delay it for a month or two.

Now, Xia ruofei’s business was blooming everywhere. The farm and winery brought in a large amount of cash every day. Although they had not started to grow paradise vegetables in Australia, they still produced a lot of profits. The Angus cattle on the farm were also very popular, so there was no problem with funding.

Feng Rao thought about it and felt that Xia ruofei’s words made sense, so she nodded and said,””Okay, Chairman. I’ll inform manager li to perfect the plan and then come back!”

“En!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”President Feng, I have nothing else to do here. You can go back to your work!”

“Alright!” Feng Rao immediately stood up and left.

The task that Xia ruofei had given her made her very motivated. She could not wait to contact Liang Qichao and settle the matter of the export of seeds as soon as possible.

Xia ruofei stood up and left the office, heading back to the villa.

After the work arrangements were done, he could be a hands – off manager again.
