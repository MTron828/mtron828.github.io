“Hehe! Don’t you have a share too?” Xia ruofei laughed.”Today’s press conference was a success. Your status as an internet celebrity will definitely increase again!”

“You still say it!” Feng Rao said coyly,”the previous incident had already slowly died down, but this time ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but raise his head and laugh.

The audience had begun to leave in an orderly manner. Most of the e – commerce employees who had come here directly left, but there were still hundreds of real audience members and media reporters, most of whom went to the experience area.

At the press conference, the effects of the jaded skin cream were described by many celebrities as miraculous. The audience and reporters were naturally very interested, especially the media reporters. If they wanted to get first – hand material for the report, they naturally had to experience the effects of the jaded skin cream in person.

Feng Jing still had a lot of things to do.

She had to lead the team to deal with the aftermath. Besides, although Xia ruofei had settled the e – commerce channel, she still needed to discuss the specific things.

This included the opening of his own store, the specific time of release, and many other details.

Of course, Xia ruofei did not need to worry about these things. He had always been in control of the general direction and was used to leaving the specific problems to others.

“Chief Feng, can the production capacity of the pharmaceutical factory keep up?” Xia ruofei asked.

“It’s not a big problem!”Feng Rao replied without hesitation. The new production line had already been tested and put into use, so the production capacity was still relatively abundant! In addition, I’ve already asked the pharmaceutical factory to start production at full speed a few days ago! As for the skin code series, the jaded skin cream needs to be hand – boiled, and this time, you promised kyokuboku group that you would sell it at the same time. Are you okay with it?”

The original limited edition skin code series had to be pushed back for a period of time compared to the mass – produced version.

Of course, this was also due to the consideration of sales strategy. After the jaded skin cream was launched, it would first build up its reputation and accumulate word of mouth. When necessary, it could also be hyped up a little. Then, it would be more appropriate to release the luxury version of the skin code.

However, it was obviously unnecessary now. This press conference had already ignited the topic, and Xia ruofei had just promised Liu Dong to sell a limited edition jaded skin cream in jingbei mall.

“I’ve prepared the original jaded skin cream,” Xia ruofei said with a smile.”I can hand it over to the manufacturer at any time.”

After the jaded skin ointment was brewed by hand, it had to be further processed in the pharmaceutical factory, adding some expensive essential oil components, and then bottled.

“The quality must be guaranteed! I don’t want to lie to the consumers, and I don’t want the reputation that I’ve worked so hard to build up to be destroyed. ” Feng Rao said half – jokingly.

“Are you still worried that I’ll do the work?” Xia ruofei asked.

Feng Jing rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei, but she had nothing to say.

Just like today’s press conference, it looked dangerous before the start and was in danger of an empty space at any time, but Xia ruofei had solved it easily.

He’s never failed on anything he’s promised ... Feng Jing couldn’t help but think.

“That’s good!” Feng Jing said,”whether or not I can become famous all depends on this period of time!”

The Jade skin cream was extremely important to the entire peach blossom company.

The main reason was that the profits were simply too shocking!

Although Feng Jing complained on stage, emphasizing how precious the medicinal materials were, how harsh the production conditions were, and how high the cost was, Feng Jing and Xia ruofei both knew in their hearts that even the 3888 Yuan grade of Yushi cream only cost 20 to 30 yuan.

Of course, this account could not be calculated in this way. The most precious part of the jaded skin cream was naturally not the medicinal materials themselves, but the intellectual property rights.

Without Xia ruofei’s formula, even if they knew all the ingredients and gathered a group of experts to study it, they would not be able to crack the secret of the jaded skin cream. This was the true value of jaded skin cream.

But no matter what, the amazing profits of the jaded skin cream were objectively there.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”the other e – commerce companies ‘model is relatively simple. They just need to receive orders and deliver the goods. Meanwhile, President Liu has prepared a self – operating store for us at jingbei shopping mall, so we can use jingbei group’s powerful logistics channel. When the time comes, as long as we send a sufficient amount of goods to the jingbei logistics’ Sanshan branch, they will naturally coordinate and send them to several hub warehouses. After the customers place their orders, we don’t need to do anything. The entire process will be done through jingbei logistics.”

“I’ll settle everything by today and arrange for the pharmaceutical factory to prepare the goods,” Feng Jing nodded.”Don’t worry!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’ve always trusted you!” I’ll set up a banquet to reward you all tonight. After you’re done here, you can go over directly! I’ll send you the location on WeChat!”

“Mm! Take care, Chairman!” Feng ke said.

In the evening, Xia ruofei invited song Rui, Zheng bang, and the team led by Feng Jing to the celebration party. The atmosphere was very lively.

At the same time, there was a heated discussion on the internet.

The two keywords “Jade skin cream” and “paradise Corporation” quickly became hot search terms, and “paradise Corporation” once again appeared on Weibo’s hot search list after the abalone auction.
