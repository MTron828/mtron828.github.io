3051 Gathering at peach source Island (1)

Translator: 5496903Hearing that, Li Yifu quickly leaped up and landed on the deck of the airboat.

As soon as he steadied himself, Li Yifu immediately bowed and said,””Disciple greets martial granduncle!”

“No need to be so polite! Come in with me!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Then, Xia ruofei turned around and walked into the cabin.

This morning, Li Yifu had just seen the airboat from the rooftop. This time, he had really entered the airboat. Therefore, he was also very curious.

However, he still followed behind Xia ruofei obediently and did not look around.

Xia ruofei led Li Yifu straight into the cabin that was used as a guest room.

When Li Yifu saw Tang Haoran, Song Wei, and Ling Qingxue, he quickly bowed and greeted them.””Greetings to the two martial grandmother! Greetings, martial uncle Tang!”

Tang Haoran used to address Li Yifu as “Grandpa li.” However, after they had confirmed that they were master and disciple, Li Yifu would greet him very respectfully every time he saw him and insisted on calling him “senior uncle.” However, Tang Haoran was still not used to it. He seemed to be at a loss when Li Yifu, who had white hair, bowed to him.

Meanwhile, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue blushed at the same time, embarrassed by the way they were being addressed. Although Xia ruofei did not deliberately hide his relationship with Song Wei and Ling Qingxue in front of Li Yifu, who was a very traditional person and even li beihuai had more than one partner, he did not think that it was inappropriate for Xia ruofei to have two Dao partners. However, this kind of thing had never been made clear. This time, Li Yifu suddenly addressed them like this, which caught Song Wei and Ling Qingxue a little off guard.

Xia ruofei looked at Tang Haoran, Song Wei, and Ling Qingxue’s embarrassed expressions and could not help but laugh.

He clapped his hands to get everyone’s attention.

Then, he smiled and said,”it’s done!” I said that I would give everyone a surprise today. Now that everyone is here, it’s time to reveal the answer!”

Ling Qingxue said impatiently,””Quickly say it! Hurry up and tell me! I’ve been holding it in all this time! What kind of surprise is it?”

Li Yifu and Tang Haoran naturally would not ask about this. Anyway, Xia ruofei could make any arrangement for their own good. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Song Wei also smiled and said,”ruofei, you’ve kept us in suspense today!” We made such a big detour to bring me, Qingxue, and Haoran here. What kind of surprise is there for us?”

“Don’t worry,” Xia ruofei chuckled.”You’ll know soon!”

Xia ruofei took out items from the spirit map space and asked,””Tell me about your cultivation!”

Li Yifu was the most honest and didn’t even ask for the reason. He immediately said,””Reporting to senior granduncle, this disciple is slow and has only reached refined Qi Level 5.”

Ling Qingxue, on the other hand, held Song Wei’s hand and said with a smile,”Wei Wei and I are both refined Qi Level 4! Aren’t you the one who knows the best?”

Tang Haoran listened to their conversation and immediately said with a bitter face,””Master, my cultivation level is the lowest ... I’m only at refined Qi Level 2, but I’ll be able to break through to refined Qi Level 3 soon!”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but ask,”RUO Fei, why are you asking about our cultivation?” Also, what is this thing you took out? A tea set?”

Xia ruofei had indeed taken out a whole tea set. There was even a small red clay stove, high – Quality charcoal, and bottles of spirit pool water from the spirit map space. It was specially used to make tea.

“Yeah!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’m going to treat everyone to some tea! Foster husband, start a fire and boil some water!”

“Yes! Senior granduncle!” Li Yifu quickly came over to start a fire for the charcoal stove, and poured the spirit pool water into the kettle, placing it on the small red mud stove.

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but laugh,” He traveled a few thousand miles just to treat us all to tea? Do you mean to experience your airboat by surprise? That’s a pleasant surprise, but there’s no need to go through so much trouble!”

“Don’t be impatient!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”the answer will be revealed soon!”

After that, Xia ruofei called Tang Haoran to his side and said,””Haoran, master will now teach you the third level of the” fierce yang Scripture “. You must keep it in mind. After you break through, you can directly practice the third level of the cultivation method!”

“That’s great!”Tang Haoran said happily. Master, tell me! My memory is really good now, I can remember it very quickly!”

“Martial granduncle, then this disciple will leave first?” Li Yifu quickly stood up.

“No need!” Xia ruofei waved his hand nonchalantly and said,”we’re all friends here. There’s nothing you can’t listen to. If you really want to learn the fierce yang Scripture, I can teach you!” However, this is an extreme yang cultivation method, which is most suitable for Haoran’s physique. If you practice it, I’m afraid the effect won’t be very good!”

“It’s enough for this disciple to have the origin returning Scripture!” Li Yifu also said with a smile.

Since Xia ruofei had said that there was no need for them to leave, Li Yifu would not reject the task of boiling water. Of course, they had to stay to complete it.

In fact, when Xia ruofei was giving Tang Haoran pointers in the Tang family’s Manor in Sydney last time, he had found a quiet place to explain it to Tang Haoran. However, he had just met Li Yifu at that time. Although he had confirmed that there was nothing wrong with the Master – disciple relationship through Xia Qing, he did not know Li Yifu’s character after all. He had to avoid the topic. He had also observed Li Yifu for a long time before he decided to teach him the Guiyuan Scripture.
