Chapter 1152: An unexpected confession (2)

Translator: 549690339

Song Rui heaved a sigh of relief. He knew that Xia ruofei was just teasing him, but he had no choice.

Zhuo Yiyi casually put her arm around song Rui’s shoulder and said,””You’re a good friend!”

Xia ruofei almost burst out laughing.

After leading Zhuo Yiyi into the second courtyard, Xia ruofei introduced her to his friends. All the invited guests had arrived, and the party officially began.

There was no formal banquet today. Everyone gathered in the open space beside the pool for a barbecue and chat.

Zhao Yongjun’s chef had prepared a lot of ingredients, and Wu shuheng also drove back with a lot of beer.

The chefs were roasting all sorts of ingredients on the barbeque rack. At the same time, Xia ruofei’s friends were also cooking.

Everyone chatted as they ate. They clinked their big beer glasses and drank from time to time. The atmosphere was very relaxed.

Xia ruofei had also secretly observed for a while. He realized that Zhuo Yiyi’s relationship with song Rui was not bad, but she obviously treated him as a male best friend. She spoke to him casually and even touched him at times, but there was no hint of romantic feelings at all.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh to himself,’song Rui is known for hitting on countless girls and not getting involved with any of them. I didn’t expect that he would hit on a good brother when he finally liked a girl ...’

Lu You had clearly noticed the strange combination of song Rui and Zhuo Yiyi.

When Zhuo Yiyi first came in, Lu You saw another beauty and thought that she was also Xia ruofei’s confidante! However, if she paid a little attention, she could tell that Xia ruofei was not very close to her. Instead, song Rui was very attentive to her.

Xia ruofei was sitting on a deck chair under a pomegranate tree with a large glass of beer in his hand. There was a plate of grilled chicken wings on the stone table beside him. He was drinking and eating skewers while looking at song Rui and Zhuo Yiyi across the pool. He could not hide the smile on his face.

It was unknown when Lu You had also come over with a glass of wine. She sat on the stone bench beside Xia ruofei and pouted at song Rui and Zhuo Yiyi. She asked,””What’s the situation with those two?”

Xia ruofei turned and glanced at Lu You. He smiled and said,””Can’t you tell? The love of the man and the disinterest of the concubine!”

Then, Xia ruofei pretended to be enlightened and said,””Oh! I almost forgot that song Rui is your fiancé, right? Are you jealous?”

Lu You’s face instantly turned red. She placed the beer glass on the stone table and pinched Xia ruofei’s arm fiercely. She said coyly,””Wei ... Wei your head! I’ll tear your mouth apart if you keep talking nonsense!”

Xia ruofei quickly begged for mercy,”let go! Let go!” I’m going to spill the beer ...”

He even deliberately shook his hand a few times, and sure enough, beer spilled on his clothes and pants.

Lu You finally let go of Xia ruofei. She chuckled and said,””He deserves it! Let’s see if you still dare to talk nonsense!”

Xia ruofei wiped the beer off his body and mumbled,””He was your future ...”

As he said this, Xia ruofei saw Lu You’s eyebrows raise again. He quickly stopped and said,””I won’t say anymore, I won’t say anymore ...”

Lu You glared at Xia ruofei and took a sip of wine. Then, she said softly,””My mom talked to me yesterday. She said ... She won’t force me if I really don’t like song Rui.”

“Oh ...” Xia ruofei replied subconsciously. Then, he came back to his senses and widened his eyes.”What?” Did Auntie Tian really say that?”

Lu You glared at Xia ruofei in dissatisfaction and said,””What do you mean by that? It’s like you don’t want me to get rid of this problem!”

Xia ruofei quickly smiled apologetically and said,”no, no... I’m just too surprised!” Lu You, congratulations! I finally don’t have to marry someone I don’t like!”

Lu You nodded and said indifferently,””Thank you ...”

Xia ruofei glanced at Lu You and asked curiously,””Shouldn’t you be very happy? Why do I feel like you ...”

Lu You couldn’t help but shoot a quick glance at Xia ruofei with hidden bitterness. Then, she lowered her head and thought,’isn’t it all because of you, you idiot ...’

After a long while, Lu You said faintly,”it’s nothing. I’m very happy!” It’s just that I don’t reveal my emotions too much ...”

“That’s true!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Tell me about song Rui and Zhuo Yiyi,” Lu You said.

“I didn’t expect miss Lu to be such a busybody!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“It’s fine if you don’t want to say it ...” Lu You was a little embarrassed.

“Don ‘t, don’ t, don ‘t, I’ll talk!” Xia ruofei quickly replied,”their story! It’s a legend ...”

Then, Xia ruofei told Lu You everything that had happened between song Rui and Zhuo Yiyi, starting from the first time they had met.

Lu You listened very seriously. Very quickly, Xia ruofei told her that with song Rui’s help, Zhuo Yiyi had successfully joined the Yanjing Museum. Then, song Rui had also attacked her, but he had ended up becoming Zhuo Yiyi’s best friend, making her not know whether to laugh or cry.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh when he said this.

However, Lu You didn’t smile. Instead, she had a thoughtful expression.

In fact, Lu You’s inner thoughts were very intense at this moment.

She was well aware of Zhuo Yiyi’s situation. If song Rui really got together with Zhuo Yiyi, he would face unprecedented resistance.

According to Xia ruofei, song Rui was serious this time. He was not playing around. If that was the case, song Rui had thought it through and knew that he was going to face the wrath of his family.
