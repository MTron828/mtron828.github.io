Translator: 5496903Of course, these two fruits were not of much help to Xia ruofei’s cultivation.

But Xia ruofei quickly mumbled to himself,””I can’t use it, but Qingxue and Weiwei can! This fruit would definitely be of great help to them! By the way, Haoran will also need it. How could I forget to give it to him when we were in Australia? Forget it ... I’ll just keep it for now! He would give it to him the next time he went to Australia. It’s not necessarily a good thing for the child to grow too fast ...”

Xia ruofei kept the fruits in a small box in the cave. He was going to let Ling Qingxue consume the fruits first. As for Song Wei and Tang Haoran’s portion, he would keep it for now.

However, Ling Qingxue said that she wouldn’t be coming over tonight and wanted to have dinner with Ling Xiaotian, so he could only wait until tomorrow.

Since this matter was not urgent, Xia ruofei naturally would not make a special trip to the Ling residence. Even though Ling Xiaotian was very enthusiastic towards him and supported him to be with Ling Qingxue, he was still a little restrained when meeting his future father – in – Law.

Xia ruofei looked at the time. It was almost three in the afternoon. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

In order to break the barrier in the space, he had almost exhausted all his strength. Although he had recovered after using a petal of the spirit Heart Flower, he was still mentally exhausted. Therefore, he simply washed up and lay on the bed to rest.

Xia ruofei slept until FiveO’ clock. When he woke up, he was refreshed. After two hours of deep sleep, his spirit had almost completely recovered.

He first divided a wisp of spiritual power and continuously injected it into the mansion – guarding wooden tablet, continuing to refine the wooden tablet. Then he got up and went downstairs to prepare dinner.

Xia ruofei heated up the unfinished lunch and took out a Chinese perch from the medium to steam.

In the afternoon, Ling Qingxue had a special liking for this steamed beluga. The entire beluga had been completely wiped out by the two of them. Furthermore, Xia ruofei did not eat much. Most of the time, he was still picking up food for Ling Qingxue.

Having dinner alone at night, he could finally enjoy the most delicious food in the world.

Xia ruofei enjoyed his dinner.

With his current cultivation, he could go without food for a few days without any problem. When they ate, their appetites were also much larger than ordinary people.

The main thing was that his body was countless times stronger than an ordinary person ‘s, so his absorption was naturally much better than that of an ordinary person.

Therefore, during the meal, not only did he finish the pomfrets, but there was also almost nothing left of the other dishes.

Xia ruofei cleaned the table and washed the dishes. He touched his bloated stomach and smiled in satisfaction.

Even though he had become a cultivator, Xia ruofei still enjoyed the happiness of the world. His three meals a day were more like a ritual.

Xia ruofei often thought that if one’s ability to enjoy good food had deteriorated, what was the point of having a high cultivation?

At least for now, he had no interest in reclusive cultivation.

After packing up, Xia ruofei strode out of the villa. Like most ordinary people, he prepared to take a walk after dinner to digest his food, even though his strong absorption ability meant that he did not need to take a walk to digest his food.

The interior environment of the villa area was very quiet. The design of the villa was also well – arranged, and the rooms were very far apart to ensure the light and line of sight of each household. At the same time, some garden designs were used to ensure the privacy of the residents.

Xia ruofei walked along the clean roads of the district, feeling a sense of leisure and comfort.

Unknowingly, Xia ruofei had reached the townhouse area on the other side of the hill.

“I wonder how the renovation of sister Che’s Villa is going?” Xia ruofei said to himself.

He continued walking toward Feng Jing’s Villa.

Just then, an uncertain voice came from behind him.””RUO Fei?”

Xia ruofei’s body froze. He slowly turned around and saw Feng Jing standing not far behind him, looking at him with a faint smile.

Xia ruofei smiled awkwardly and waved at Feng Rao.””Sister che, what a coincidence!”

Feng Jing was still wearing her work suit, which made her look very capable.

She glanced at Xia ruofei and asked,””Mr. Chairman, when did you return to the three mountains? You’re getting more and more mysterious these days. I can’t even see your head or your tail ...”

Xia ruofei laughed drily,”I ... Only came back in the evening!” She had just arrived home! I’m a little tired, so I didn’t call you because I thought I’d see you guys at the office tomorrow ...”

As the boss, he had been away for more than ten days. Now that he was back at the three mountains, he had to hide for another day. Furthermore, he was caught red – handed by Feng Jing. Xia ruofei felt very embarrassed.

“I’m just asking,” Feng Jing chuckled.”Look at how nervous you are ... You’re the boss of the company. How would I dare to interfere with your schedule?”

The more Feng Jing said this, the more awkward Xia ruofei felt. He quickly changed the topic.”By the way, sister che, what are you doing here?”

“I’m here to check on the renovation progress!”Feng Rao shrugged. I’m so busy in the company during the day that I can’t leave! I can only come back to take a look after work ...”

She’s definitely complaining about being busy and not being able to respond to her ... Xia ruofei secretly thought.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said with a smile,””Sister che, didn’t you hand over the renovation to uncle Liang’s company? He’ll take care of you personally, so you don’t have to worry!”

“That’s true, but it’s still such an expensive house!” Feng Jing smiled and said,”this is basically all I have, and I’ve even paid a bonus in advance ... Although I trust CEO Liang, I can’t help but come and take a look after work. After all, this is my house! I can’t just be a hands – off shopkeeper!”

A hands – off shopkeeper! Xia ruofei’s expression froze for a moment. He thought to himself,”He was definitely alluding to me ...

Feng Rao looked at Xia ruofei and suddenly burst into laughter.”Alright! I’m not talking about you! Look at how guilty you are ...”

“How did I become a thief?” Xia ruofei immediately said,”besides, how am I guilty? I’m doing my job properly, do I need to feel guilty?”

“Yes, yes, yes!” Feng Jing looked at Xia ruofei coyly and said,”Mr. Chairman, do you want to accompany me to check on the renovation progress?”

“Alright! I’m honored!” Xia ruofei laughed.

The two of them walked side by side towards the townhouse nearby. On the way, Feng Jing habitually reported to Xia ruofei about the company’s recent situation.

Feng Jing was very familiar with the company’s operations. Even though she didn’t prepare in advance, she had all the data in her head and could easily report it to her.

“Oh right, there’s something I haven’t had the time to report to you.” Feng Jing said,”I couldn’t get through to you these few days when you were out at sea ...”

“What’s the matter?” Xia ruofei asked.

“It’s about the matter that you promised xiangnan TV to record the show. ” Feng Jing said,”xiangnan TV’s leader ...”

“What do you mean I agreed to it?” Xia ruofei interrupted Feng Jing and said,”you were the one who agreed to it, okay?”

“Fine, fine, fine,” Feng Rao chuckled,”I’ll take it as a promise, okay?” Didn’t I still ask for your opinion and get your consent?”

“Alright! Alright!” Xia ruofei said helplessly,”and then?”

“The recording time for the first episode has basically been set. It’ll be at the end of this month.” Feng Jing said,”it’s only been about ten to twenty days. Xiangnan TV has contacted us many times, hoping to discuss the recording of the show with you in advance.”
