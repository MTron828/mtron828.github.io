Xia ruofei nodded. At this time, the stone pillar that had just been hidden underground slowly rose up again with the clicking sound of the spring.

Xia ruofei quickly walked over and saw that the energy storage Pearl was still in the groove at the top of the stone pillar. It did not seem to have changed.

Xia ruofei reached out and picked up the energy storage Pearl. After sensing it for a while, he revealed a trace of joy. Although the appearance of the energy storage Pearl did not change, the amount of energy stored in it had increased by a few times.

Xia ruofei knew that the elemental storage Pearl had been successfully upgraded. If it was filled with elemental energy, it would be able to store almost all the elemental energy of an early stage nascent soul cultivator.

This time’s trial Pagoda’s fourth level mission was really worth it. Not only did he obtain more than 2000 pieces of yellow jade essence, but his spiritual power had also doubled. Even Ling Qingxue’s spiritual power had improved by leaps and bounds, and she had even broken through a major realm. Furthermore, Xia ruofei had also obtained an additional upgrade to the energy storage Pearl and a thousand elemental crystals as a reward. He had definitely earned a lot.

Xia ruofei checked the energy storage Pearl after it had been upgraded and realized that the energy he had stored was still there.

Previously, the energy storage bead was full, but after the upgrade, the capacity had increased several times, so the energy stored inside seemed empty.

Xia ruofei muttered to himself, then said to Ling Qingxue,””Qingxue, I’m going to take advantage of the time now to fill the elemental storage Pearl with elemental energy. Wait for me at the side. If anything happens, call me immediately!”

Ling Qingxue had already understood the function of the elemental storage Pearl, so when she heard Xia ruofei’s words, she immediately nodded and said,””No problem! I’ll help you guard!”

Xia ruofei laughed and rubbed Ling Qingxue’s head.””Sure! Even The Guardian knows about it!”

Ling Qingxue playfully hit Xia ruofei and said,””You’re touching my head again, my hair is all messed up!” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you should have a mirror in your storage ring, right?” Take it out and see how you look now. It doesn’t matter if your hair is messy, right? Anyway, it’s just a broken pot…”

Ling Qingxue immediately covered her ears and said,””! won’t listen, 1 won’t listen! You stinky scoundrel, you’ve touched on my sore spot!”

Ling Qingxue’s journey had been tough, especially after running for more than 10 hours in the dusty wilderness. She was extremely dirty. Girls were most concerned about their image, so how could they listen to Xia ruofei’s teasing?

“Qingxue, don’t you think that it would be the happiest thing if you could take a bath?” Xia ruofei asked after some thought.

Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”nonsense!” Of course…”

“Leave this to me!” Xia ruofei said,”1’11 help you think of a way, but you have to bear with it for a while longer. Let me fill up the energy storage Pearl first!”

Ling Qingxue looked around and frowned.””What can we do here?”

“You don’t have to worry about that, just help me guard!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Oh!” Ling Qingxue naturally knew that it was important.”Got it!”

Xia ruofei then took out the time array flag from the spirit map space and set up the time array in the blink of an eye. Then, he set up a few alarm and protection arrays on the outside before stepping into the array and taking out a crystal from the space.

He first used his spiritual sense to give Xia Qing a few instructions in the spirit map space, then sat cross – legged on the ground, absorbing the energy of the yuan crystals and pouring Yuan Qi into the yuan storage Pearl.

Xia ruofei did not know how difficult the next task would be. Since the energy storage Pearl had been upgraded and could contain all the vital Qi of an early stage nascent soul cultivator, he had to fill it up as soon as possible. The more vital Qi the better. Who knew when it would save his life?

Since Ling Qingxue was here, it was not convenient for Xia ruofei to enter the spirit map space. Hence, he could only use the time array flag to set up the array and directly inject the energy storage Pearl from the outside world. This would save him some time.

Of course, although the spiritual Qi on the fifth floor of the trial Pagoda was much denser than that on earth, it was still far from the spirit map space. If Xia ruofei were to absorb the spiritual Qi here to cultivate, the efficiency would be much lower. Hence, he took out origin crystals at the same time.

Of course, it would be a waste, but in order to save time, Xia ruofei could not care less.

What’s more, he had just obtained a thousand origin crystals, and they were filled with all the yuan Qi of an early stage nascent soul cultivator. One or two origin crystals were enough. In addition, he could also absorb the spiritual energy in the fifth floor of the trial Pagoda, so the consumption was even less. He estimated that at most one and a half origin crystals would solve the problem.

Naturally, Xia ruofei would not care about such a small consumption.

He immediately sat cross – legged on the ground and continuously poured the yuan Qi in his body into the elemental storage Pearl.

At the same time, he continuously circulated the “great Dao Arts” technique, extracting energy from the fifth level of the trial Pagoda and the origin crystals in his hand to maintain his cultivation.

Now, Xia ruofei’s spiritual power had doubled again. He had tried it just now and found that it was no problem to do two things at the same time. He could even spare some attention to pay attention to his surroundings.

Ling Qingxue stood outside the time formation, dutifully guarding the side. At the same time, she constantly scanned the surroundings, vigilantly watching the situation..
