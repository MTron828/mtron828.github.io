Translator: 549690339

In fact, Xia ruofei had really wronged Feng Jing.

He had lunch with Zhao Yongjun and the others in the city, then sent them to the airport. It was almost time for work when they returned to the farm.

When Xia ruofei’s flashy Knight XV off – Road vehicle drove in, it was coincidentally seen by Feng Jing, who was going downstairs to work. She had a few things to report to her, which was why she called just now.

Feng Jing was waiting at the door of Xia ruofei’s office. When she saw Xia ruofei, she smiled and asked,””Chairman, I hope I didn’t disturb your rest.”

“You’re asking the obvious ...” Xia ruofei said gloomily.”I haven’t even sat down for long when I got home, and you called me. Why are you resting?”

Feng Rao couldn’t help but smile and said,””Chairman, it’s normal to be busy at the end of the year, you have to get used to it! Besides ... If I could make a fortune like you, I’d be willing to be ten times busier!”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and shook his head. He opened the office door and walked in.

Although he hadn’t been here for a few days, the office was still spotless. The administrative office arranged for people to clean it every day.

Xia ruofei sat down on the chair and added some spring water into the teapot. Then, he turned on the heat.

He raised his head and said,”sit!” Right, didn’t we agree to call my name when no one is around? Why did he keep calling her Chairman? Sister Che!”

Xia ruofei’s half – Smile made Feng Rao’s face heat up. She then said coyly,””I’m still not used to it. ”

Xia ruofei laughed,”I’m just joking!” Sister ran, tell me, what important work do you have to discuss?”

Feng Rao glanced at Xia ruofei and said,””Can’t I report something not important to you? Are you still the boss?”

Xia ruofei laughed drily,”I have a capable general manager like you.” Alright, alright, I misspoke. Let’s talk about work, talk about work ...”

Seeing Xia ruofei’s embarrassed look, Feng Jing couldn’t help but burst out laughing. However, she quickly held back her laughter and flipped open her notebook with a serious expression. She started to report to Xia ruofei. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“First, I have a few things to report to you.” Feng Jing said seriously,”the handover procedures for the Hengli building have been officially completed. Now, the entire building belongs to our paradise Corporation. All the remaining payment has been settled. This work can be considered to be completed successfully!”

Xia ruofei nodded. This was within his expectations. The contract had been signed and the money had been paid. Even if the paperwork for the transfer of ownership went through normally, it should have been done after so many days.

“How’s the renovation going on for the few floors we plan to use?”he asked.

“Everything’s going as planned, but our requirements are a little high,” Feng Jing replied.”Plus, you’re so influential, so they won’t dare to mess things up. It might take some time.”

In the end, the renovation of the office building was handed over to Liang Weimin’s jianda company. His real estate company had a renovation company that met the requirements and was very experienced. Xia ruofei did not go through the bidding process and directly handed it over to Liang Weimin, who he trusted.

It wasn’t their first time working together, so Liang Weimin naturally attached great importance to Xia ruofei’s project. He sent the best construction team and repeatedly reminded them to ensure the authenticity of the materials and the quality of the project.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Slow work makes fine work. I’m not in a hurry!”

Feng Jing nodded with a smile.”It’s almost the Spring Festival, so the renovation company might be a little tight on manpower. They’re already working overtime. I’ve already spoken to the construction team. If they really can’t handle it, they can finish it after the spring Festival.”

“En!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”it’s not particularly urgent for us. The company is still operating on the farm. It’s just that everyone’s office environment is a little cramped. We’ll just have to overcome it for the time being.”

“Understood!” Feng Jing nodded and said,”regarding the sales of the pomfrets, we followed your plan and did some promotion on the internet. We also hired some paid posters to write some articles and contacted a few powerful distributors. In short, everyone is very interested.”

“I noticed it,” Xia ruofei said with a smile.”When I was on Heron Island the day before yesterday, I saw a Food Guide. It also promoted Ling Ji’s private kitchen ...”

“That article was published by the three mountains Evening News, and it was written by a proper reporter!” Feng Jing said with a smile. However, we contacted some online media and internet trolls to repost it ...”

“It’s not cheap, right?”Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“It’s the normal budget, nothing out of the budget ...”Feng Jing smiled.

“It’s fine even if you exceed it!” Xia ruofei said,”this is the money that should be spent. You can’t save it!”

Xia ruofei was not an old – fashioned person and did not have any moral mysophobia. It was normal to ask the media to help promote and give them some money for their appreciation and transportation. He did not reject it.

Xia ruofei then brought the topic back to the right track and said,””As for the choice of suppliers ... I’m inclined to only cooperate with one of them. As for who to cooperate with, it will depend on the conditions they offer and the subsequent negotiations.”
