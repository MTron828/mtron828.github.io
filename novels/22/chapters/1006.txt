Xia ruofei was the first to wave his hand and said,”forget it!” A good man doesn’t fight with a woman ...”

“Do you look down on women?” Zhuo Yiyi immediately said,”or ... Are you afraid that you’ll lose face if you lose to women?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you think I’ll lose to you?” However, student Zhuo Yiyi, trying to goad me into action is useless. I really don’t want to play this game, so you guys go ahead!”

This kind of breakthrough event tested one’s flexibility and balance. Of course, it also had a certain requirement on physical strength. To Xia ruofei, this was child’s play.

Not to mention that he had taken so much body tempering soup after obtaining the interspace and even embarked on the road of cultivation. With his skills in the Army, it was as easy as eating and drinking for him to quickly complete such a breakthrough.

Xia ruofei was not interested in things that were not challenging.

“Boring!” Zhuo Yiyi pouted as she said this, then turned her gaze to Song Wei.

“I don’t want to play either, I can’t swim!” Song Wei quickly replied. You’ll definitely choke if you fall into the water ...”

“Hey! You’re too disloyal!” Zhuo Yiyi said angrily,”Weiwei, there are lifeguards in the water. What are you afraid of?” Besides, are you that unconfident? Do you think you will fall into the water?”

“Yiyi, don’t try to persuade me,” Song Wei said with a smile. “I won’t try something I’m not confident in.” If you feel bored playing alone, you should persuade uncle song Rui!”

Hearing this, Zhuo Yiyi looked at song Rui and said,””Uncle, don’t tell me you don’t want to play?” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Song Rui said without thinking,”play!” Of course he was playing! I’m not like some people who cower in the face of danger!”

“Ha! Uncle, I’ve known you for so long, and this is the only sentence that I’ve ever heard!” Zhuo Yiyi said happily. She even shot a glance at Xia ruofei.

“Have you known me for a long time?” song Rui did not know whether to laugh or cry.

Zhuo Yiyi had only said it casually, but even though she realized her slip of the tongue, she still refused to admit defeat. She forced herself to say,””We’ve known each other for half a day, it must be ... More than a hundred thousand seconds! It hasn’t been long?”

Xia ruofei and Song Wei burst out laughing. Song Rui rubbed his forehead and said,””Yes ... It’s been long enough ...”

“Aiya, don’t mind these details!” Zhuo Yiyi said,”let’s go and change our tickets!”

With that, Zhuo Yiyi walked to Xia ruofei and Song Wei and extended her hand.

“Why?” Song Wei asked in confusion.

“The tickets! Don’t waste it even if you don’t want to play!” Zhuo Yiyi said matter – of – factly,”I’ve changed my ticket to play with uncle. Each of us can play four times!”

“Here you go ...” Xia ruofei hurriedly passed the tickets to Zhuo Yiyi.

Zhuo Yiyi took the tickets for the two of them and said,””Uncle, what are you doing? Let’s go!”

Then, she grabbed song Rui’s hand and ran toward the entrance of the checkpoint.

Caught off guard, song Rui stumbled and almost fell to the ground. Then, he was pulled by Zhuo Yiyi in an extremely sorry state and involuntarily ran to the ticket exchange office.

Xia ruofei and Song Wei found an empty sun chair and sat down. They each ordered a glass of fruit juice.

“Song Wei, your classmate is quite interesting!” Xia ruofei laughed.

Song Wei’s face reddened.”Yiyi is a person who speaks without thinking. Don’t mind her!”

“Why would I mind?” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you didn’t even mind song Rui being hit like that! Do you think I’m that petty?”

When Xia ruofei mentioned song Rui, Song Wei couldn’t help but look at the two people who were exchanging their tickets at the entrance. She revealed a meaningful smile.

Xia ruofei and Song Wei sat on the sunbathing chairs and watched Zhuo Yiyi and song Rui play the game.

Song Rui didn’t usually exercise, and his body coordination wasn’t very good. He stumbled through the first level, but slipped into the water on the next level.

On the other hand, Zhuo Yiyi was as tough as a man. There were a few times when she looked like she was about to fall into the water, but she managed to get past them without any mishaps and made it all the way to the finish line.

Zhuo Yiyi proudly received a small gift and then returned to the starting point from the finishing point. At this time, song Rui had just swum to the shore in a sorry state and was climbing up the escalator.

Zhuo Yiyi happened to pass by the pond, so she naturally couldn’t avoid a round of teasing.

The situation was similar for the second and third time. Although Zhuo Yiyi did not maintain her good luck and fell into the water halfway, she still passed more rounds than song Rui each time.

“This Yiyi girl is going to be proud ...” Song Wei smiled.

“Maybe song Rui let her win on purpose!” Xia ruofei’s lips curved up as he spoke.

“I don’t think so ...” Song Wei said.”He always looks so embarrassed when he falls into the water. If he’s pretending, he’s really trying his best ...”

“Let’s continue watching!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

His eyes were naturally sharper than Song Wei ‘S. Song Rui had indeed fallen into the water without any preparation, and he had slipped.

It was the second and third time. Although it was also very realistic, Xia ruofei could tell with one look that he had not lost his balance. Moreover, he had fallen into the water both times when Zhuo Yiyi happened to look at him. Hence, he had already figured it out.
