2405 Destruction_Going back to half a minute ago.

Xia ruofei had just finished off the last two soldiers in the tent when Douglas rushed out of his tent.

Xia ruofei kept the two unconscious soldiers into the spatial cage. Immediately after, he felt a huge sense of danger. This warning was more obvious than ever.

He quickly scanned the direction of Douglas ‘tent with his spiritual power. It was the only tent he had never visited. If there was any danger, it would most likely come from that direction.

At this time, Douglas had already raised his light machine gun and aimed at Xia ruofei’s tent with a ferocious expression.

Xia ruofei’s expression changed. He made the best decision in a split second. The tent had no effect on the bullets of a machine gun. Although Xia ruofei was in the tent, it was no different from being in an open area. Even if he was a cultivator and was much faster than the average person, could he be faster than a machine gun bullet?

Therefore, there was no way to hide now.

Xia ruofei did not hesitate at all. He immediately summoned the spirit map scroll from his palm and stuffed it under the mat beside him. Then, he entered the space with a thought.

Almost at the same time, machine gun bullets tore through the tent like raindrops, causing cotton wadding and rags to fly everywhere.

If Xia ruofei had been half a second late, he would have been in a bloody mess by now.

Although cultivators had strong bodies, Xia ruofei was only in the Qi refining stage. It was impossible for him to withstand bullets with his body.

After Xia ruofei entered the medium, he had been using a wisp of his spiritual power to check the situation outside. When he saw the terrifying scene in the tent, he felt a lingering fear. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

If there were people in the tent at this time, it would have become a living hell.

At the same time, Xia ruofei was also secretly speechless. This Boulder Douglas was really ruthless! Douglas definitely didn’t know that all the soldiers had been captured into the spirit map space. From Douglas ‘perspective, his soldiers must be in the tent. The only difference was whether the soldiers were alive or dead.

In fact, there was a high probability that the soldiers had been subdued by Xia ruofei and not killed.

If that was the case, then Douglas’s machine gun would be completely indiscriminate.

Of course, Xia ruofei had grown up in the People’s Army. Back then, he was in a completely different environment from these mercenaries. He just could not understand why a commander would be so indifferent to the lives of his soldiers.

Just as Xia ruofei’s thoughts were running wild, Douglas had already thrown away the machine gun and was approaching the tent with a pistol in hand.

Xia ruofei also put away his distracting thoughts and focused on Douglas ‘every move.

As Douglas slowly approached the location of the spirit painting, Xia ruofei stood up as well. His muscles were all tensed up and he was ready to attack.

One step, two steps ...

Douglas’s thick boots made a clicking sound when he stepped on the messy ground. He was naturally focused on the irregular spaces that were propped up by the messy tent skeletons, because only those spaces could possibly hide people ... Or corpses.

Naturally, Douglas did not pay any attention to the small scroll that was stuffed under the cushion. If there was a person under the cushion, he would be able to tell at a glance, unless the person could dig a hole big enough to hide in within a few seconds.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power was still sensing the outside world. When Douglas passed by the location of the spirit map scroll and took two steps forward, Xia ruofei gritted his teeth and left the space with a thought.

Now, he was already used to going in and out of the space, so he didn’t feel dizzy at all. Moreover, he had very precise control over his position after he left the space.

Just as Douglas took his third step, Xia ruofei appeared exactly half a meter behind him. This was the best distance to attack.

As soon as Xia ruofei returned to the outside world, he was already prepared. He stomped on the ground and pounced on Douglas. He clenched his fist and hit Douglas ‘chin with all his strength.

Douglas was indeed a battle – hardened veteran. He was able to react to the sudden attack because he had an extraordinary sense of danger. Although Xia ruofei’s appearance was sudden and silent, he still felt his heart palpitate at that moment.

Douglas leaned his body to the side almost instinctively and raised his left arm to block.

Xia ruofei was a little surprised, but his movements did not slow down. His fist continued to make whooshing sounds as it smashed towards his face.

In the blink of an eye, their forearms had already touched.

There was a crack. When Douglas ‘strong forearm collided with Xia ruofei’s arm, it was broken like a fragile branch.

Douglas felt a sharp pain, but he also staggered back from the tremendous force.
