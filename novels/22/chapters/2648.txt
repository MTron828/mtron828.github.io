2649 Chapter 1450 – missed (1)

Xia ruofei had already made arrangements for the follow – up treatment. Old man Liu and Liu Qunfeng had no reason to ask him to stay here. After all, Xia ruofei was not old man Liu’s family doctor.

Besides, Xia ruofei had said that his mobile phone would be available 24 hours a day and that he could be contacted if there was any situation. In addition, he would also come over regularly to check up on old man Liu.

What else could the Liu family say?

Old man Liu and Liu Qunfeng expressed their sincere gratitude to Xia ruofei again. Then, Liu Qunfeng personally sent Xia ruofei to the courtyard.

Xia ruofei had driven here by himself. However, he had called Wu Qiang in advance and asked him to take a taxi to the Liu family’s residence.

After waving goodbye to Liu Qunfeng, Xia ruofei got into the Toyota Elfa, which had been parked in the Liu family’s house for the past two days. Wu Qiang drove him straight to the Beijing International Airport.

After arriving at the airport, Xia ruofei asked Wu Qiang to drive back. He dragged his small suitcase that was used for decoration and walked into the private passage for the bus.

Yesterday, Xia ruofei had already informed the flight crew to make preparations. Not long after he boarded the plane, the plane was allowed to take off.

What Xia ruofei did not know was that not long after Paradise took off, a flight from Australia landed at the Capital International Airport. An old man in a light green long – sleeved shirt and a middle – aged man in a suit stepped out of the cabin.

The old man in the long robe sniffed, as if he was not used to the terrible air quality in the capital. He frowned and said,””Boshan, let’s hurry up. The air here is really uncomfortable!”

These two people were Zheng Yongshou and Wang Boshan from the star Seizer sect. They had been delayed for a few days due to some matters, and had only made a turn to Australia today. They had flown to the Huaxia capital city and didn’t have a direct flight to Huaxia. For their trip to Huaxia, they had to first go to either Sydney or BlackBerry to transfer flights.

Zheng Yongshou lived in the star Seizer sect all year round. Although the environment there was not as good as Xia ruofei’s spirit map space, it was at least much better than the outside world. When he arrived at the foggy capital, he suddenly felt uncomfortable.

On the other hand, Wang Boshan had been in the secular world for many years. In recent years, China’s economic development had been very dazzling. Wang Boshan had come to China many times because of business, including Beijing, so he was still able to adapt.

“Alright, martial uncle Zheng!” Wang Boshan replied respectfully.

The two of them hailed a taxi as soon as they left the airport and headed straight for liuhai Lane. Wang Boshan had already gotten some information about Xia ruofei through his internal line before they came.

Liuhai Lane wasn’t very wide, so they didn’t want to go in when they got out of the taxi, so they walked in.

Soon, they arrived at the entrance of Xia ruofei’s courtyard house.

Wang Boshan raised his head to check the house number and said,””Martial uncle Zheng, it’s here!”

Zheng Yongshou looked at the magnificent gate and nodded,””This house is not bad ... Much better than the chimney – like buildings outside.”

Wang Boshan didn’t know whether to laugh or cry as he said,”martial uncle Zheng, this house is good, but ordinary people can’t afford it.” There were more and more people in modern society, so the buildings were built higher and higher. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be able to accommodate them! To be able to afford such a large courtyard in the heart of the capital, it’s not an ordinary person. ”

“Even if he’s not an ordinary person, he’s still a person of the secular world. How extraordinary can he be?” Zheng Yongshou said indifferently.

Wang Boshan was also somewhat helpless towards this martial uncle who was almost otherworldly. What he actually wanted to express was that he lived in such a big house and looked like a person who did not lack money. It would obviously be more difficult to buy the green cloud Island from him.

Wang Boshan did not dare to refute and could only smile awkwardly,””Martial uncle, I’ll go knock on the door then.”

“Go!” Zheng Yongshou said indifferently with his hands behind his back.

Wang Boshan walked up the stairs and came to the front door. He wanted to knock on the door knocker, but he found that there was a doorbell device on the door, so he walked over and rang the doorbell a few times. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

After a short while, the small door at the side opened, and a man in his early thirties walked out. He looked at Zheng Yongshou and Wang Boshan with a trace of vigilance and asked,””Who are you guys looking for?”

He was a comrade – in – arms recruited by Wu Qiang. His name was Gu Yong and he was in charge of the security of the courtyard. He usually lived in the front courtyard.

Wang Boshan’s face revealed a smile and asked,””Hello, is Mr. Xia ruofei at home?”

“The boss is not here.” Gu Yong said.

“Do you know where he went?” Wang Boshan asked again.

Gu Yong looked at Wang Boshan and said lightly,””I’m sorry, but the boss doesn’t report to me where he goes. ”

Gu Yong knew that if it was someone Xia ruofei knew, they would definitely call him before coming. Even if they came rashly and couldn’t find him, they would still call. The two people in front of him clearly didn’t even have the boss’s contact information.

“Then ... Do you know when Mr. Xia will be back?” Wang Boshan asked, not giving up.

“That’s hard to say. ” Gu Yong said,”the boss doesn’t live in the capital often. Sometimes he doesn’t come for a month or two, and sometimes he’s here every day ... Why are you looking for him?”
