During the new year, other than a few production lines that were shut down, the rest of the production lines were still in operation. Of course, there were no three shifts these days. They were shut down from 8 pm at night to 8 am the next morning. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The main reason was that the heart – nourishing soup and jaded skin cream were currently in a state of supply shortage. If they did not work overtime to produce them, the supply pressure would be too great.

Xue Jinshan even jokingly told Xia ruofei that the most wasteful investment in Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory was the construction of a new warehouse because it was completely useless. The products were almost transported away by the trucks waiting outside the moment they were off the production line.

Xia ruofei and Feng Jing went to the workshop to greet the workers. The factory manager, Xue Jinshan, personally followed behind Xia ruofei and Feng Jing and gave red packets to the workers.

Coming out of the workshop, Xia ruofei told Xue Jinshan,””Kanayama, you’ve worked hard!”

“Director Xia, I’m full of motivation now. I don’t feel tired at all!” Xue Jinshan laughed.

He was now the leader of the branch company and was one of the higher – ups in Tao Yuan company. Moreover, the Tao Yuan pharmaceutical factory had brought him a great sense of achievement in his career. His classmates in the same period used to laugh at him for working in a company that sold agricultural products as a Medical University student. Now, they were all envious and praised him for his good taste.

“There’s nothing much to do today. You should go back early. ” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”otherwise, sister – in – Law would have an opinion!”

“Alright!” Xue Jinshan said,”today, assistant factory manager Lin is very generous and volunteered to be on duty. I will go back when it’s time and make it in time for the New Year’s Eve dinner!”

“Elder Lin, I’ll have to trouble you then!” Xia ruofei turned to look at assistant factory manager Lin and smiled.”Rest a few more days after the new year!”

Deputy factory manager Lin was called Lin Weiming. He had just been promoted and was the workshop director previously.

This time, the Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory was officially upgraded to a branch company, so the staff allocation naturally had to be strengthened. Therefore, a Deputy Director was promoted from the business and management positions respectively.

“Thank you for your concern, President Xia. This is part of our job!” Lin Weiming quickly said.

Xia ruofei nodded and patted Lin Weiming’s shoulder.”Do well! The company will definitely not mistreat everyone!”

“Yes, thank you, President Xia!” Lin Weiming was a little flattered.

Then, Xia ruofei told Xue Jinshan that Dong Yun would be coming over for research after the new year and asked him to do a good job of receiving her. After that, he ended the inspection and greetings at Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory.

Surrounded by the factory leaders, Xia ruofei and Feng Jing walked to the side of the Knight XV SUV. Another car arranged by Xue Jinshan was parked quietly behind the SUV.

Xia ruofei stopped in his tracks and looked at Feng Rao.””President Feng, are you really not coming with me to Qiao’ er’s place?”

Feng Rao smiled and said,”I’m not going. You guys can have a good New Year!” On behalf of the company, I’m going to have a New Year’s Eve dinner with the staff who stayed back at our farm. ”

Xia ruofei was initially worried that Feng Jing would feel neglected if she returned to the farm alone, so he wanted to bring her to Lin Qiao’s house for the new year. However, since Feng Jing insisted on having a New Year’s Eve dinner with the employees, Xia ruofei could not persuade her any further.

He could only helplessly say,”alright then!” President Feng, I’ll wish you a Happy New Year in advance then! We’ll ... See you next year!”

“See you next year!” Feng Rao chuckled.

Feng Rao got into the small car prepared by the pharmaceutical factory, while Xia ruofei drove the Knight XV off – Road. The two cars left the pharmaceutical factory one after the other and headed in different directions.
