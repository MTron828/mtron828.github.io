2933 Retreat after success (2)

Of course, The Chinese in Mexico didn’t need to buy drugs from the Gulf Group, but if something really happened to them, if the Gulf Group could provide protection, it would be an extra protective charm! Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Although he didn’t want to admit it, in Mexico the Gulf group’s words were sometimes more effective than the government ‘s.

Even after the video finished playing and the computer screen turned black, Zhang Chao still hadn’t recovered from the shock.

“Brother Zhang, Do You Believe Me Now?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

Zhang Chao seemed to wake up from a dream. He quickly nodded and said,”I believe you! He believed in him! Mr. Xia, I’m completely convinced ...”

At this time, Zhang Chao’s mind was like a stormy sea. He had attached great importance to Xia ruofei before, but it was mainly because of Li Yifu, which made Xia ruofei’s position in his heart very high. Of course, this morning, Xia ruofei had brought Luo Qingfeng along to defeat ERAD. This had caused Xia ruofei’s position in his heart to rise by a large amount. But even so, Zhang Chao still could not imagine that Xia ruofei could make a giant like the Bay group lower its proud head with his own ability.

Such an outcome was impossible even for Li Yifu to achieve.

The Hong sect might be able to resolve the conflict with all their strength, but it was only to resolve the conflict. They would have to pay a high price for it. However, Xia ruofei’s way of handling it was not to resolve the conflict at all. It was to make the other party yield. From the way Goodman was acting, he must have been under a lot of pressure.

This meant that Xia ruofei’s background was even greater than Li Yifu ‘s!

When this thought came to his mind, Zhang Chao couldn’t help but be shocked.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”brother Zhang Chao, I think you should organize everyone and get them to return to kuachakurakos as soon as possible.” After all, your roots are there ... Oh! By the way, Goodman also offered to pay you 100 million US dollars as compensation for emotional damage. I’ll give you his contact information later, so you can go and talk to them yourself!”

In his email to Xia ruofei, other than sending the video, Peter had also sent Xia ruofei the contact number that Goodman had left behind. It was mainly for the 100 million US dollars compensation.

Zhang Chao was shocked when he heard this. He waved his hand and said,””We can’t take this money!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Goodman gave it to you. Why can’t you take it?” Besides, if you don’t accept the money, Goodman will think that we’re not satisfied with how we handled this matter! I bet he won’t be able to sleep tonight!”

Zhang Chao quickly said,”Mr. Xia, we don’t deserve it. The whole thing is your credit. We didn’t do anything at all. How could we dare to take this money?” Besides, even if the entire Huafeng shipping was robbed by the Bay group, it would only be worth a few million dollars. 100 million dollars was too much! I think ... You should be the one to keep this money!”

Xia ruofei shook his head.”I’m not short of money. Besides, this is the money to compensate Huafeng shipping. Why would I want it?” Brother Zhang Chao, don’t decline. We’ve all suffered a lot of shock this time. You can give everyone more money later, and the rest will be used as the company’s operating funds. It’s decided!”

Xia ruofei’s words were unquestionable. The faint pressure made Zhang Chao unable to say anything.

However, after thinking about it, Zhang Chao still felt that the money was hot in his hands. After hesitating for a while, he braced himself and said,””Mr. Xia, we really don’t dare to take this money. Even if you blame us, we can’t take it! What do you think? We’ll do the contacting, but I’ll use the money to purchase firearms and equipment in batches after it’s transferred to your account!”

Zhang Chao thought that since Xia ruofei insisted on not accepting it and they did not dare to take it, and Xia ruofei came here for the firearms, they might as well exchange the money for firearms. In his opinion, this was the best of both worlds.

Xia ruofei did not know whether to laugh or cry,”why would I need so many firearms?” We’ve bought enough this time. ”

Zhang Chao quickly said,”firearms and equipment can be stored if they can’t be used up in a short time. Bullets, grenades, and the like are all consumables. Moreover, equipment will depreciate and be eliminated with the passage of time. They will always need to be replaced with new ones.” We’ll buy 20 million US dollars worth of firearms every year from now on, and we’ll give it to you over five years ... Mr. Xia, please don’t reject it, or we really don’t dare to take this money!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while. Since Zhang Chao insisted, he didn’t want to push it around for 100 million US dollars. He nodded and said,”Alright! Let’s do this then! However, you’ll be in charge of the purchase. I’ll take care of the transportation. You can contact Li Yifu when the time comes!”

“Alright!” Zhang Chao heaved a long sigh of relief and said,”Mr. Xia, it’s settled then!”

Xia ruofei saw that Zhang Chao was afraid that he would go back on his words and couldn’t help but find it funny. He smiled and nodded.”Alright! It’s decided!”

Zhang Chao thought for a moment and immediately said,””By the way, Mr. Xia. Do you think we should ship this container of goods back to kuachakuros port? Why don’t our company contact a ship to help you transport this batch of equipment out of Mexico?”

Xia ruofei shook his head and said,”no need. I’ve already said that we’ll take care of the transportation.” There’s no need to transport this batch of goods back to kuachakuros. Help me find a truck to pull this container to a more remote place and unload it. Then, leave the rest to us!”

Zhang Chao subconsciously wanted to fight for Qianqian. He also wanted to do something for Xia ruofei. He could not repay this favor, but he could at least do his best for Xia ruofei.

However, he thought about it again. Xia ruofei was able to make a giant like the Gulf Corporation yield in such a short time. It was clear that Xia ruofei’s power in Mexico was much greater than he had imagined. Perhaps he had better channels? Furthermore, Xia ruofei had said earlier that he wanted the goods to be unloaded at a remote place. It was obvious that he wanted to avoid people’s eyes and ears!

Thinking of this, Zhang Chao knew what he should do. He quickly said,””Alright! Mr. Xia, I’ll do as you say!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”then I’ll have to trouble you to help us transport the goods!” We’ll go with the car and won’t be accompanying you back to quachakuarkos. ”

“No problem!” Zhang Chao said,”the trailer of the truck is ready. We can set off now!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”then what are we waiting for?” Let’s go!”

He had been delayed in Mexico for more than half a day, and the trouble here had been solved for Zhang Chao. Now he just wanted to return to peach source Island as soon as possible. He didn’t want to waste a single moment.

“Yes! Mr. Xia, please follow me!” Zhang Chao said respectfully.

Soon, Zhang Chao brought Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng to the big yard behind the safe house. The container of firearms was placed there. The trailer of the truck was also there. It was the one that had been driven over from kuachakuarkos. The container was still loaded on it and had not been unloaded.

Zhang Chao first gave a few instructions to ah Qiang, asking him to inform everyone to stop their evacuation preparations and to stand by. Then, he asked for the truck’s key and personally drove Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng out of the safe house with the box of firearms.

Ishwaatlan and kuachakurakos were next to each other. Zhang Chao often came here, so he was very familiar with the roads here. He drove for about 40 minutes and arrived at a remote road.

There were very few vehicles here, and both sides of the road were barren land. There were almost no buildings in sight, so it could be said to be deserted.

Xia ruofei observed the surroundings and nodded in satisfaction. The place Zhang Chao had chosen was very much to his liking.
