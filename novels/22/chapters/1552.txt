Chapter 1553: Helping boss Yu cheat people (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry as he said,” chief Yu, don’t tell me you really believed that old man’s words? ” I don’t know anything about stone gambling! How can I give you any advice? ”

Yu mingdong didn’t think so. His action seemed absurd, but in fact, the Jade merchants who were watching didn’t find it strange.

In their line of work, they actually believed in luck. Tao Wu’s stone gambling itself depended on a bit of luck. How could there be someone who would win every bet? In their eyes, Xia ruofei was obviously very lucky today. Even if Xia ruofei did not know anything about stone gambling, perhaps his random advice would be right?

It was just like how some lottery fans would ask someone who didn’t buy a lottery ticket to pick a random one.

” Mr. Xia, ” Yu mingdong said with a smile, ” you’re in luck today. Just give me some pointers! ”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly,” I don’t know how to give advice.” If I cut it, the precious Jade inside will be cut in half ...”

“That’s all on me! I won’t blame you!” Yu mingdong patted his chest and said.

“Little brother, please help old Yu!”

“Yup! You’re in luck today, you can bet however you want!”

“We’re still waiting to witness the rise of this material! Stop hesitating!”

The surrounding Jade merchants also tried to persuade him.

Xia ruofei looked at Yu mingdong and felt that he wasn’t joking. Helplessly, he could only say, ” “Then I’ll really mess around. Don’t blame me if something goes wrong ...”

“No wonder, no wonder! ” Absolutely not ...” Yu mingdong said quickly.

Xia ruofei nodded and walked in front of the raw stone. Yu mingdong and the surrounding Jade merchants all held their breaths and stared at Xia ruofei.

In fact, Xia ruofei knew that Yu mingdong had lost this raw stone because of Huanhuan. When Xia ruofei had checked this raw stone, the reaction of the spirit painting scroll was far less than that of his piece of No. 1860. Yu mingdong’s bid price was three times that of Xia ruofei’s material.

The reason why Xia ruofei came over tonight was that he wanted to help Yu mingdong reduce his losses as much as possible.

Therefore, he came to the raw stone and began to grope around on it.

This raw stone was even bigger than the one that Xia ruofei had cut out earlier. There was a window in one of the spots. It was precisely because of this window that the Jade flesh could be seen under the thin layer of Stone Skin. The quality of the Jade was at least of the ice grade, which was why the price of this raw stone was so high.

Usually, when people who often gambled on stones appraised this kind of material, their focus would definitely fall on the window that was opened. This was because the window that saw green allowed them to observe the situation inside the raw stone as much as possible through the strong light of the flashlight.

However, Xia ruofei was different. He kept feeling around the surface of the material and touched almost every part of it.

In fact, Xia ruofei was not pretending that this raw stone was very big. The intensity of the reaction was different in different positions. The difference was very small, but it was enough for Xia ruofei to roughly guess the location of the Jade essence inside.

This judgment was enough for Xia ruofei.

After a long while, he straightened his body and drew a line on a protruding part of the raw stone. He said, “President Yu, why don’t you cut off this horn and wipe it inside? ”

Xia ruofei’s words stunned the Jade merchants. Under normal circumstances, such semi-bright materials would be bought from the window that was opened. This was basically common sense.

The position that Xia ruofei was pointing at happened to be the back of the window. It could be said that it was in the opposite direction.

Yu mingdong was also stunned, but he quickly came back to his senses and said,” “Good! We’ll open it according to Mr. Xia’s opinion!”

The Jade merchants immediately started discussing. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Hey! Old Yu is going all out!”

“Who asked that little brother to have such good luck today!”

“I’ll bet on it too ...”

......

The stonecutter received Yu mingdong’s instructions and didn’t say much. He directed the forklift to place the raw stone in place, slightly adjusted the position, and fixed it. Then, he turned on the power of the cutting machine.

There was a sharp sound of friction, and stone chips flew.

Very quickly, the protruding corner was cut off. The cut was white and there was no green at all.

Everyone couldn’t help but discuss in low voices.

However, Yu mingdong didn’t hesitate and said,” “We’ll start polishing the stone from here!”

Since he had chosen to believe in that illusory luck, Yu mingdong had no way of turning back.

The stonecutter picked up the hand grinder, changed the grinding wheel sheets, turned on the power, and started to grind from the new cut.

Everyone was also watching intently, each with different thoughts.

After a while, Xia ruofei suddenly raised his eyebrows. However, he did not say anything because the experienced stonecutter had also raised his hand and turned off the power of the grinding machine.

“Why did you stop!”

“Could it be that there’s green again? ”

While everyone was discussing, the stonecutter wiped the polished part with a wet cloth. After looking at it carefully, he turned back and said with a smile, ” “Congratulations, boss! It’s already green ...”

Like a stone that caused a thousand ripples, the Jade merchants who were watching the show became excited.

Yu mingdong revealed a happy expression. He quickly walked forward to take a closer look. He was so happy that his body was trembling.
