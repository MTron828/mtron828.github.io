Chapter 1245: Chapter 757 – big profit (2)

Translator: 549690339

Even if he called a high price, Xia ruofei would continue to bid, and he wouldn’t accept it. At most, the White truffle would be left unsold.

However, Xia ruofei had already said that he would be holding a small private auction in the evening. If this record – breaking white truffle was put up for auction, it would attract more people to attend.

Xia ruofei had only lost 10% of the charity funds and some Commission from the auction.

To Xia ruofei, who had earned a lot today, this was nothing.

After thinking through all this, Blake sat back in his seat like a deflated ball. He had given up on the auction.

The fight for the White truffle had just begun.

This white truffle wasn’t much heavier than the previous ones. The last one weighed 2.53 kilograms and was sold for 1.63 million dollars.

But this white truffle had the Halo of a world record!

Moreover, this was the final truffle of the day. Many of the rich people present had not gotten anything yet, so the price of this truffle had risen due to many factors.

Monica, who was beside Xia ruofei, couldn’t sit still either. She hesitated for a moment before raising her board and said clearly,””1.75 million dollars!”

“Ms. Grasso bids 1.75 million dollars!” Lu zhongguang immediately said,”the price has now reached 1.75 million dollars. This is a piece of top – grade white truffle that has broken the world record. It is one of a kind in this world! If we miss this opportunity, we might not encounter white truffle of such weight and quality for many years to come ...”

Lu zhongguang’s words were very tempting. This was also the most important embodiment of whether a professional auctioneer was valuable. A successful auctioneer like Yingying must have studied psychology very well. She had to be good at grasping the buyer’s psychology and use her words and body movements to arouse everyone’s desire to buy.

Lu zhongguang was obviously one of the Masters.

However, Xia ruofei was laughing in his heart. He had prepared four batches of truffles. The final item of each batch was a giant white truffle, and the weight of the individual truffle was gradually increasing.

In other words, for every truffle auction held by the Paradise Corporation this season, there would always be an item that broke the world record.

Of course, the buyers at the scene did not know.

The price of $1.75 million was not particularly high, so Monica’s offer was quickly refreshed by higher prices.

1.8 million USD!

1.88 million US dollars!

1.9 million USD!

In a short while, the price of the White truffle had exceeded the two million US dollars mark in an unprecedented manner!

The bidder was Nikola, a wealthy man from Romania.

Nicolay’s company was engaged in the sales of fertilizer and agricultural machinery. It might sound insignificant, but it was this insignificant industry that brought Nicolay billions of euros in wealth. He had also been crowned as the richest man in Romania for several years in a row.

Two million dollars was obviously a huge price. It wasn’t that the rich couldn’t afford it, but the price was already close to the limit of the truffle’s value. It wouldn’t be worth it if they offered a higher price.

Monica could only sigh helplessly and give up the competition when the price reached two million dollars.

Xia ruofei saw that Monica was a little disappointed. He couldn’t help but lean over and whisper,””Monica, don’t worry! I won’t let you return empty – handed ...”

Monica’s beautiful eyes glowed. She turned around and almost kissed Xia ruofei.

The two of them quickly separated a little.

Monica covered her mouth with her hand and asked in a low voice,””Xia, you still have truffles?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”If someone else wanted it, I wouldn’t have it. But you’re different. So ...” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Can the truffle’s quality also reach the level of today’s auction?” Monica asked in surprise.

She didn’t dare to hope for something as shocking as the final white truffle. As long as it reached about two kilograms, or even lighter, as long as the truffle was of good quality, her mission would be considered complete.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”don’t worry!” Let them fight for this truffle! I’ve left you a pretty good one ...”

Monica’s eyes flickered and she glanced at Xia ruofei flirtatiously. She chuckled and said,””Then I’ll get it from you tonight?”

Xia ruofei’s heart fluttered and he said,””That’s what I wanted to say too. I’ll wait for you ...”

Monica pursed her lips and smiled, nodding her head gently.

Just as the two of them were chatting, the price of the White truffle reached a new high.

Guo Hongjiang, the real estate tycoon from Hong Kong, directly quoted a price of 2.1 million US dollars, breaking the record price.

Guo Hongjiang’s net worth was close to 20 billion US dollars, and he was one of the richest people in Hong Kong.

He hadn’t made a move all this time, not even when the competition for the White truffle was so intense.

It was not until the price broke through two million dollars and the momentum stagnated that he made a bid without any warning. He even increased the price by 100000 dollars in one go. He was obviously determined to win.

The wealthy Romania man, Nicholas, frowned slightly. He thought for two to three seconds before raising his sign again.”2.15 million dollars!”

“2.2 million!” Guo Hongjiang didn’t even bother to raise his sign. He immediately announced his price without even a second of hesitation.

He was sitting in the middle of the first row, and the famous Mr. Guo was well known in Hong Kong, so Lu zhongguang immediately confirmed the price.

“2.2 million dollars!” Lu zhongguang’s voice trembled as he said,”every bid is setting a new record! The record price of a single white truffle would be greatly increased, and it might be difficult to break for a long time in the future! Is there anyone else who is willing to offer a higher price?”

Nicolay hesitated for a long time. Several times, he was ready to raise the sign, but then he put it down again.

As for the other buyers, they basically gave up when the price reached two million dollars.

Lu zhongguang was a little disappointed when he saw that no one else was bidding. However, this disappointment was fleeting. The auction today had been successful enough, especially the last piece of white truffle, which had dazzled the audience.

“2.2 million dollars going once ... 2.2 million dollars going twice ... 2.2 million dollars going three times! Deal!”

As the gavel fell, the last piece of white truffle was finally sold for the sky – High price of 2.2 million US dollars!

There was a burst of applause in the auction house, especially in the area where the Hong Kong tycoons were sitting.

In the end, this piece of top – Class white truffle fell into the hands of a tycoon in Hong Kong, and everyone felt honored.

Everyone expressed their congratulations to Guo Hongjiang. Guo Hongjiang, who was nearly 60 years old, also stood up and waved to everyone with a smile.

Although Blake had created a few small interludes in the first auction of the truffles, it was still a successful one.

Other than Xia ruofei who had won the bid for the 90 – kilogram truffle after the ‘fight’ with Blake, Xia ruofei had earned a total of US $17.644 million from the other truffles!

In this way, all the truffles harvested this season could bring Xia ruofei tens of millions of dollars in income.

This was definitely a shocking number.

Lu zhongguang expressed his gratitude to all the buyers, then completed his task and returned to the backstage.

The manager of the auction house, Dong Jiajun, walked up to the stage with a microphone and said with a smile,””Thank you very much to all the guests and media friends who are here! He was also very grateful for the full support of the Paradise Corporation! Without the high – Quality truffles from the Paradise Corporation, there would not have been such a successful auction today! Next, let us welcome the chairman of the peach blossom company, Mr. Xia ruofei, to the stage to say a few words to everyone!”

A round of applause instantly broke out in the venue. When Xia ruofei heard this, he was stunned for a moment. Didn’t Yingluo say that Feng Jing would go up? Why did it become me?
