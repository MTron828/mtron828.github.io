Chapter 1660: the first Prince!

Seeing Luo Qingfeng’s dazed look, Xia ruofei could not help but laugh and say,””Qingfeng, there’s nothing else for you to do here. Leave behind the formation map and go do your work! I need to think about how to improve the formation!”

Luo Qingfeng came back to his senses and quickly said,””Yes! Master, this old servant will take his leave!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Luo Qingfeng bowed respectfully to Xia ruofei and then left the control room.

After he left the house, the first thing he did was to go to Zhai Xing Lou and order the disciples guarding the perimeter to call Wang Boshan to Zhai Xing Lou.

It had been a few days since Wang Boshan had returned to the star Seizer sect. However, Luo Qingfeng had been following Xia ruofei all this time and was not in the sect, so he naturally did not arrange any specific Affairs for Wang Boshan. He had been idle.

Yesterday, when Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng returned to the star picking sect, the soul seal in Wang Boshan’s body had naturally sensed it. In fact, if Xia ruofei wanted to sense Wang Boshan, it would be easy. It was just that he did not pay attention to these small things.

Upon hearing the sect leader’s call, Wang Boshan rushed to Zhai Xing Lou.

Luo Qingfeng was waiting on the first floor of zhaixing tower. When Wang Boshan saw Luo Qingfeng, he immediately bowed and greeted,””Sect leader, you were looking for me?”

“Yes.” Qingfeng Luo nodded and said,”Boshan, you’ve been back to the sect for some time now. I’ve been busy all this time, so I don’t have time to arrange your Affairs ...”

“Yes!” Wang Boshan quickly said,”it’s already a great favor from master and sect leader for me to be able to get away from worldly affairs. It’s no big deal to wait for a while!” By the way, sect master, did master come to our sect?”

“Yes.” Luo Qingfeng nodded and said,”master is also at zhaixing tower, but he’s in seclusion. He doesn’t have time to meet you!”

“Yes, yes, yes! Master’s business is more important!” Wang Boshan quickly said.

“Boshan, have you settled all the matters in the secular world?” Luo Qingfeng asked.

“Yes!” Wang Boshan quickly replied. Junior Brother Chen is very smart, and before he joined the sect, he went to college and majored in business Administration. However, he has been in the sect for more than ten years and doesn’t know much about the outside world. After I taught him for a while, he got it. In addition, according to your instructions, I’ve already transferred the sect’s secular industries to Junior Brother Chen’s name. This disciple believes that with Junior Brother Chen’s ability, you will definitely be able to manage our sect’s secular industries better!”

“That’s good,” Luo Qingfeng said lightly. This way, I can arrange your matters with peace of mind ...”

Wang Boshan was overjoyed. Even in his dreams, he wanted to learn better techniques in the sect. In the past, he was not talented and it was impossible for him to do so. But now, because of Xia ruofei, he was called back to the sect.

Furthermore, even the sect master, Luo Qingfeng, was Xia ruofei’s soul slave. In Wang Boshan’s opinion, he and Luo Qingfeng were essentially of the same status. With this layer of relationship, his status in the star Seizer sect would definitely be extraordinary in the future.

From the looks of it, it was a good thing that he was captured on peach source Island!

Wang Boshan’s thoughts turned quickly and he quickly lowered his head,””Thank you, master and sect leader, for your cultivation!”

Regardless of the situation, he had to put his master first. Even if Luo Qingfeng was the sect leader, he was no exception.

Luo Qingfeng nodded and said indifferently,””Come closer!”

Wang Boshan thought that Luo Qingfeng was going to teach him the cultivation technique personally and was very happy. He quickly took a few steps forward and stood in front of Luo Qingfeng. He lowered his head and looked like he was listening.

Luo Qingfeng gently placed his hand on the top of Wang Boshan’s head.

Wang Boshan felt strange. If he was a child, Qingfeng Luo’s action could be explained as love. However, he was already a middle – aged man in his thirties or forties, and he was a little balding. Could it be that Qingfeng Luo had some kind of bad taste in touching his head?

Although he was not used to it, Wang Boshan did not dare to avoid it. Instead, he forced a smile and put on a very respectful look.

At this moment, a cold light flashed in Qingfeng Luo’s eyes. He released the yuan Qi in his palm and a strong force directly rushed into Wang Boshan’s head from the Baihui point on the top of his head.

The smile on Wang Boshan’s face froze. His eyes revealed a look of disbelief and a trace of confusion.

With a golden core cultivator attacking at such a close distance, how could Wang Boshan, whose cultivation was so weak, still have any physiology? Basically, the moment he spat out the vital Qi, the inside of his head had already turned into a paste ...

Until his death, Wang Boshan did not understand why Luo Qingfeng wanted to kill him.

However, he could only carry this question and sink into the endless darkness ...

Luo Qingfeng looked on expressionlessly as Wang Boshan fell to the ground in front of him. His heart was calm.

Even if it was not for Xia ruofei’s order, killing a low – Level cultivator was not a big deal for Luo Qingfeng.

To be able to become a sect leader in the world of cultivation and reach the Golden core stage, which one of them wasn’t ruthless and decisive? Which one of them hadn’t experienced life – and – Death battles and narrowly escaped death?

Qingfeng Luo took out a small bottle of powder from his storage ring, opened the bottle and gently sprinkled some on Wang Boshan’s body.

Soon, Wang Boshan’s corpse let out a sizzling sound and turned into a pool of blood in a short while. Even his clothes and other items were all melted in the blood.

Luo Qingfeng unhurriedly scattered another kind of powder. The blood on the ground quickly solidified, leaving a small pile of powder.

With a wave of his hand, Luo Qingfeng sent all the powder out of star – picking tower and scattered in the wind.

A living person like Wang Boshan had disappeared without leaving a trace.

Upstairs, Xia ruofei had already taken out a pen and paper from the spirit map space. As he pondered, he wrote and drew on the paper, jotting down some of his thoughts.

When Wang Boshan was killed by Luo Qingfeng’s palm, an invisible line in Xia ruofei’s soul sea broke instantly and disappeared quickly.

Xia ruofei stopped and scanned the building with his spiritual power.

In fact, he knew that Wang Boshan was already dead, but he wanted to confirm it.

The order to execute Wang Boshan was personally given by Xia ruofei. For such a scum who had committed heinous crimes, Xia ruofei naturally did not have any psychological burden.

Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to’ see ‘that Luo Qingfeng was dealing with Wang Boshan’s body. He nodded and said to himself,””Qingfeng’s ability to execute is not bad!”

Dealing with Wang Boshan was just a small matter. Since Luo Qingfeng had completed it in time, Xia ruofei naturally would not ask about it. He quickly bent over the table and began to draw again.

It was rather cumbersome to improve the stellar evolution formation. Although Xia ruofei had some ideas, he still had to consider all aspects of the original formation when he was implementing it. This was a test of his array Dao skills.

Fortunately, after being trapped for a thousand years, Xia ruofei’s array theory had made a qualitative leap.

In addition, his spiritual power had also reached the late – Stage of the spirit gathering realm, which was not inferior to some late – Stage golden core cultivators. Therefore, his calculation speed was much faster than before.

Xia ruofei was so engrossed in his study of the array that he did not notice the passing of time.

After Luo Qingfeng dealt with Wang Boshan, he immediately returned to this floor and personally waited in the corridor.

As for the other disciples who had been working in Zhai Xing Lou, they were still restricted to be on guard outside. They were strictly prohibited from coming within a fifty – meter radius of Zhai Xing Lou.

To Xia ruofei, studying array Dao was a very interesting thing.

Especially the improvements on the original foundation, it made Xia ruofei feel like he was talking to his ancestors from hundreds of years ago.

...

He was confident that if that senior of the star Seizer sect were still alive, he would definitely feel like he was a bosom friend.

Because Xia ruofei had almost completely understood every consideration that the ancestor had taken into account when he set up the star evolution formation. It could be said that his understanding of the formation was no less than that of the genius elder of the star Seizer sect who had set up the formation himself.

The formation control room was one of the most heavily guarded rooms in Zhai Xing Lou. Other than a thick and heavy door, there were no windows. The surroundings were also made of very strong defensive building materials.

The light in the room was on. Xia ruofei did not know whether it was day or night outside. He was completely immersed in the joy of improving the formation.

Unconsciously, a large pile of waste paper had been thrown around the table. Xia ruofei had thrown them aside after he had overturned his own thoughts.

On the table, there was a stack of printed paper. Some of them were filled with words, while some were drawn with various formation patterns.

Whether it was the words or the pictures, they all seemed to be a little scribbled.

Only Xia ruofei knew that every stroke in these pictures and texts was the crystallization of his wisdom.

Finally, Xia ruofei put down the pen in his hand and heaved a long sigh of relief. He felt relaxed. He had already drafted a plan that he thought was perfect.

Xia ruofei quickly tidied up the papers on the table and arranged them in order. Then, he walked over and opened the door.

Qingfeng Luo was waiting in the corridor not far away. When he heard the voice, he quickly walked over and bowed.””Master!”

...

“Qingfeng, have you dealt with Wang Boshan?” Xia ruofei nodded and asked.

“Yes! It had already been settled yesterday. I wanted to report to master as soon as possible, but I was worried that I would interrupt master’s thoughts. ” Luo Qingfeng said.

Xia ruofei had been in the control room for a day and a night.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” You’ve done well!”

Then, he showed the stack of papers in his hand and said with a smile,””I’ve already come up with a plan to improve the formation! In the next one or two days, we’ll make use of the time to improve this formation!”

Luo Qingfeng was overjoyed when he heard this. He quickly said with tears of gratitude,””Many thanks, master! Master has not rested for the sake of the star Seizer sect. This old servant, on behalf of all the disciples of the star Seizer sect, thanks master!”

With that, Luo Qingfeng’s knees went weak and he was about to kneel down.

Xia ruofei released his essence force and held Luo Qingfeng up. He said lightly,””Qingfeng, I don’t do this here. In fact, I had no choice but to use my soul seal on you. After all, my strength was far inferior to yours at that time. If I didn’t do that, I would have been in danger. Although we are master and servant in name, I have never treated you as slaves. As long as you work hard under me, you will be the same as before, and even better than before!”
