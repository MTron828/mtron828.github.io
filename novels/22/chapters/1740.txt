Chapter 1741: The King’s Woman (1)

Xia ruofei picked up his phone and saw that it was Feng Jing. He immediately picked up and said with a smile,””Sister che, we haven’t seen each other for half a day. Don’t tell me you’re missing me again?”

Feng Rao arrived at the three mountains at noon and sent Xia ruofei a WeChat message. However, Xia ruofei was busy with the nine rotation universe formation and only replied with a simple sentence.

“You’re getting more and more outspoken!”Feng Rao said, pouting. I might tell on you to Qingxue!”

“Qingxue would not believe lies!” Xia ruofei laughed.

After teasing her for a while, Xia ruofei asked,””Sister che, what’s the matter?”

“Yeah, there’s something I need to talk to you about,” Feng Jing said.”Didn’t you agree to open a verified Weibo account a few days ago?” The public relations department has been in contact with Weibo, and your personal Weibo account has been officially opened. ”

“Oh! That’s fast!” Xia ruofei replied casually. He was not very concerned about this matter.

Feng Jing continued,”the management company will usually have someone in charge of maintaining your Weibo. However, you can post a few of your own occasionally. You can interact with your fans when you have time.” Also...The first post after you’ve opened your Weibo, I think you should post it yourself! It’s more memorable. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”is that necessary?” I don’t usually use Weibo ...”

“It’s very necessary!” Feng Jing said,”these social media platforms have an astonishing amount of traffic. As a public figure, it’s very necessary for you to have a platform to speak for yourself. Do you know how influential a verified account with tens of millions of fans is? It’s not inferior to the provincial media at all!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”I know that. But I don’t think I’m a public figure. I’m not interested in popularity!”

Feng Rao was a little angry and said,””Just because you say it’s not, it’s not! Have you ever seen an incident that could remain in the top ten of the hot search list for more than ten days without any behind – the – scenes hype? And when you came out of the airport, did you hire those reporters and fans? “Even without the Quto incident, as the company’s scale and influence grow day by day, you will become a public figure sooner or later as the company’s boss! President Liu from kyokuboku mall, President Ma from Skycat mall ... Don’t you know all of them?”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly,”Alright, alright!” Wasn’t it just a few Weibo posts? And you’re telling me so many big reasones...I’ll post it, alright?”

“Ruofei, this is still a hot topic. If we open a Weibo account now, it’ll be good for both the company and you. Be serious!” Feng Jing said.

“I know!” Xia ruofei said,”send me your account and password on WeChat!”

After hanging up, Feng Jing quickly sent her Weibo account password to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei opened the Weibo app. After logging in, he saw that his Weibo name was “Xia ruofei”. It was already an eye – catching orange V certification, and the certification information was that he was the chairman of peach blossom company.

Xia ruofei nodded to himself. This was reasonable. He was just afraid that the verification information would say “main character of quaohang’s forced surrender” or “the light of the Chinese”.

Those who were in the know knew that this was the certification information submitted by the staff. Those who were not in the know would definitely say that Xia ruofei was boasting.

Then, Xia ruofei took a look at the number of fans and couldn’t help but gasp.

This Weibo account should have just been opened. He had not even posted a single post, but he already had more than 50000 fans. The background notification for new fans had turned the red corner into an ellipsis. In addition, there were countless private messages, which he could not read at all.

Xia ruofei had wanted to just post a few words and take it as a mission, but seeing the enthusiasm of the netizens, he couldn’t help but take it more seriously.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and decided to post a photo with some text.

However, he rarely took photos, let alone selfies. He searched through his phone’s photo album for a long time but couldn’t find a suitable one.

At this moment, Song Wei came out of the shower. She wiped her wet hair with a towel and asked with a smile,””What are you looking at?” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Xia ruofei looked up and saw Song Wei in a light yellow down jacket. Her tight jeans made her legs look even longer. There were still water droplets on her hair, making her look even more beautiful. Xia ruofei could not help but be a little dazed.

However, Xia ruofei’s gaze only froze for a moment before he regained his senses. He smiled and said,””The company has opened a personal verified Weibo account for me, and I’m preparing to send a message to everyone to say hello!”

Song Wei’s eyes lit up and said,”Yo! A big star opened Weibo! Come on! Let’s become each other’s fans!”

Song Wei took out her phone and looked at Xia ruofei’s Weibo. She quickly searched for it and followed him. Then, she urged Xia ruofei to follow her.

The number of Xia ruofei’s fans kept increasing. After a few pages of notifications, Song Wei pointed at one of the accounts and said,””This, this! Quickly pay attention!”

Xia ruofei looked at Song Wei, who was acting like a child, and laughed. He followed her.

Song Wei’s Weibo name was “VIVI,” probably using the harmony of “Weiwei.”
