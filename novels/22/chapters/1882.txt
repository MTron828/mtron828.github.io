He only said three words indifferently,””Done!”

“Understood!” Lei Hu immediately replied. I’ll get it done immediately!”

After arranging everything, it was time to get off work in the morning. Xia ruofei packed his things and stood up to leave.

He was going to have lunch with Ling Qingxue.

Now that the company’s headquarters had moved to the city, he had more opportunities to meet Ling Qingxue. It was much more convenient for them to have a meal together or even roll in the sheets together.

The company’s headquarters hadn’t set up a cafeteria yet, but now that online takeaway was quite developed, it wasn’t a big problem for everyone to eat.

It was just that Xia ruofei was not used to eating takeaway. Besides, he felt that it was not good for the health of the employees in the long run, so he was inclined to set up another cafeteria in the headquarters. After all, there were still so many empty floors! He would look for the jianda group to renovate and renovate it. It would be put into use very soon.

Even though it was a little wasteful to use an office building as a canteen in such a place where every inch of land was worth its weight in gold, Xia ruofei did not care much about that. He always believed that in order to make his employees feel a sense of belonging to the company, the boss had to always think for his employees and think from their perspective.

His suggestion was supported by Feng Jing, Dong Yun, and the other executives. They had already organized people to come up with a proposal.

However, in the short term, it would be impossible to eat in the cafeteria here.

Xia ruofei had made a reservation at a French restaurant in the city. This restaurant had just opened in Sanshan recently and was said to be a Michelin star restaurant. Business was booming as soon as it opened. Xia ruofei had only managed to make a reservation three days in advance.

He drove a Mercedes – Benz to the headquarters of the Ling’s restaurant. After picking up Ling Qingxue, the two of them went to the French restaurant called “corner”.

This restaurant was really located on a street corner. The restaurant had a 270 – degree floor – to – Ceiling glass, and most of the seats had a wide view of the street.

As they had already made a reservation, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue were quickly led by a waiter to a window seat along the street.

Then, a waitress came over with an iPad and asked politely,””Sir, do you want to order now?”

“Yes, I am!” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”do you have any recommended dishes? We’re here for the first time!”

“I suggest that the two of you try our signature dishes, premium beef ribs and white truffle mashed potatoes, as well as ...” The waitress explained with great familiarity. Then, she suddenly stopped and looked at Xia ruofei for two seconds. She asked in surprise,”are you chief Xia?”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment before he nodded and said,””My surname is Xia, but I can’t be sure if it’s the president Xia you’re talking about ...”

The waitress said excitedly,”it can’t be wrong. He’s the overbearing President, Xia ruofei!”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but burst out laughing. Xia ruofei was even more speechless.

He thought that the popularity on the internet had dropped, so he didn’t disguise himself this time. He didn’t expect to be recognized by the waiter as soon as he came to the Western restaurant around the corner.

The waitress suddenly turned into a fangirl. She held the iPad with both hands and said,””President Xia, I’m your super fan! We’re all proud of you as the three mountains people!”

Xia ruofei’s expression was a little unnatural as he said,””Oh ... Then thank you for your support!”

“Can I have your autograph?” The waitress said with an expression of admiration,”it would be even better if we could take a photo together!”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”no problem!” But ... I hope you won’t take a picture of the lady beside me ...”

“Since I’ve already recognized you, how could I not recognize the one beside you?” the waitress chuckled. You’re President Ling, right? The netizens are saying that you’re the overbearing President and that President Xia is the president’s man ...”

Ling Qingxue’s face immediately turned red. She had been watching the show with a teasing expression on her face, but she didn’t expect to get caught in the fire.

It seemed like this waitress was really a huge fan of Xia ruofei, she even knew Ling Qingxue’s situation so well.

The waitress quickly took out a small notebook from the pocket of her apron and removed the ballpoint pen from her back. She handed it to Xia ruofei with both hands and a sincere look on her face.

Xia ruofei took the pen and paper, raised his head and asked,””By the way, what’s your name?”

“I’m Cheng Xiaoxiao! They’re definitely your super fans!” The waitress said.

Xia ruofei nodded and scribbled down a few words in his notebook. I wish Cheng Xiaoxiao happiness every day! The next line was his signature.

Cheng Xiaoxiao saw that Xia ruofei had not only signed, but had also written a blessing to her. She almost fainted from happiness. She hurriedly and carefully put away the book, then took out her phone and said,””President Ling, please help me take a few more beautiful pictures!”

Ling Qingxue took the phone with a smile and said,””No problem!”

At this moment, a stern voice was heard.””Cheng! What are you doing? I just emphasized yesterday that you’re not allowed to disturb our customers. Your behavior is really disappointing!”

Cheng Xiaoxiao’s face turned pale with fright. Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue followed the sound and saw a white man in a suit standing behind Cheng Xiaoxiao with an angry face and a stern gaze.

“Mr. Bastian, I’m sorry ...” Cheng Xiaoxiao said carefully.

It was not easy for her to get this job at the corner Western restaurant. She had to go through three rounds of interviews before she could get a job. The competition was so fierce because the average salary of this restaurant was at least 30% higher than that of similar restaurants. It also had many chain stores in the country. If she did well, her career prospects would be very good.

Cheng Xiaoxiao didn’t expect that she would be caught red – handed by the manager after only a week. In such a high – end dining place, the requirements for the waiters were very strict, and one of them was that they were absolutely not allowed to disturb the customers. Cheng Xiaoxiao had made a big mistake.

Even if he was lucky enough not to be fired, this month’s bonus would probably be gone.

Xia ruofei naturally couldn’t bear to see his fan being punished. He smiled and stood up.”Sir, miss Cheng’s service is very professional. I was the one who suggested the group photo, so I hope you don’t blame her ...”

Cheng Xiaoxiao was suddenly moved. This feeling of being protected by her idol made her feel so warm that she wanted to cry.

The manager named Bastian’s expression eased a little, and he said in his still – stiff Chinese,””Sir, you don’t have to exonerate Cheng. We’re turning the corner ...” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Bastian’s mouth and eyes opened wide as he spoke. He stared at Xia ruofei for a few seconds before mumbling,”“oh! my god!”

Xia ruofei, Ling Qingxue, and Cheng Xiaoxiao couldn’t help but look at each other, not knowing what had happened.

At this moment, Bastian said enthusiastically,””So it’s the Honorable Mr. Xia! It’s our honor to have you visit our corner Western restaurant!”

Ling Qingxue and Cheng Xiaoxiao looked at each other, then turned to look at Xia ruofei in unison, their eyes full of admiration.

Ling Qingxue thought,”is RUO Fei that influential?” Even the foreigners admired him so much!

Cheng Xiaoxiao’s inner monologue was,”my idol is indeed my idol!” His personal charm could already ignore the restrictions of national boundaries! I didn’t expect Mr. Bastian to be a fan of our President Xia!

Xia ruofei was also a little dumbfounded. He asked,””Mr. Manager, we ... Have met before?”

Bastian said enthusiastically,”Of course! Oh no! To be more precise, I’ve seen you before ... And you shouldn’t have any impression of me!”

As expected! Cheng Xiaoxiao said in her heart.

Because this was basically the standard answer for fans to their idols. You have seen your idol, but your idol has no impression of you.

Xia ruofei was still in a daze. He did not think that he was that influential. If he was an Australian, it might be possible, but the French ... He probably had seen the news before. It was good enough that he could remember his name. Why would he worship him so much?

Bastian then reminded,”Mr. Xia, Hong Kong!” Hengfeng’s truffle auction ... I’m lucky to be able to attend it with my boss ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.
