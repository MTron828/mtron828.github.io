Chapter 187: Super large fish tank_1

When Xia ruofei returned to the villa, Lin Qiao, who always liked to sleep in, had already woken up and was watching ye Lingyun do push – ups in the courtyard. As soon as she saw Xia ruofei, Lin Qiao’s face bloomed with a smile.””Brother ruofei, where did you go so early in the morning? I’m waiting for you to have breakfast!” “Yo! Did the sun rise from the West today?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”our little lazy bug is up so early?” Lin Qiao blushed and said,””You’re the lazy worm! Quickly go in and eat!” Lin Qiao rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei in disgust and turned to return to the villa. Xia ruofei greeted ye Lingyun with a smile and walked in as well. Hu Zi’s mother had already prepared breakfast. When she saw Xia ruofei enter, she smiled and invited him to have breakfast. During the meal, Lin Qiao pestered Xia ruofei to ask him about Shen Cheng. Xia ruofei would pick some interesting things to tell her, such as the private jet, the Presidential Suite of a super five – Star hotel, and the auction. Of course, Xia ruofei didn’t tell them in detail about the auction that he had made 14 million Yuan in one auction. He was afraid that he would scare the two of them. However, Lin Qiao was also interested in the luxurious planes and presidential suites that Xia ruofei mentioned. She couldn’t help but mumble,””Rich people really know how to enjoy life ...” Xia ruofei laughed.”When we have money, we’ll buy a private jet too. One that’s even bigger than old Mr. MA ‘s!” “Mm! Brother ruofei! “Then you have to work hard ...” Lin Qiao said with a smile. “Haha, you have to study hard too. When you graduate from college, come and help me!” Xia ruofei laughed. “Alright!” “It’s a deal!” Lin Qiao said seriously. “It’s a deal!” After breakfast, Hu Zi’s mother chased Lin Qiao back to her room to do her winter vacation homework. Soon, the last semester of high school began. Lin Qiao’s homework was very heavy. Before the winter vacation, the teachers of various subjects gave out a lot of mock papers for everyone to do during the holiday. Meanwhile, Xia ruofei drove the Super SUV, Knight XV, straight to the San Shan city. Along the way, the armored monster naturally earned a lot of heads. Xia ruofei drove along the winding highway into the city. Then, he followed the GPS and headed straight for the nearest Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. Under normal circumstances, banks would only rest for three days. From the fourth day of the first lunar month onwards, all the bank branches would be open for business. It was the fifth day of the first lunar month today, so Xia ruofei was prepared to cash the 14 million Yuan check first. As the bank was closed during the new year, there were many people in the bank for business these two days. Xia ruofei parked the car and went to look at the ICBC bank. There were at least 20 people on the bench waiting for their numbers to be called. Just as Xia ruofei was about to go and get the number, he suddenly thought of something. He might as well look for the bank’s lobby manager and show her the 14 million cash check. Then, he told her that he was here to cash in the money and that the money would be directly deposited into his ICBC account. In addition to maintaining order in the lobby, answering customers ‘questions, and promoting wealth management products, the lobby manager’s responsibility was to find high – end customers. A business deal worth 14 million Yuan was definitely a big customer. Hence, the lobby manager enthusiastically led Xia ruofei to a counter with the words ‘service suspended’ and quickly found a counter staff to help Xia ruofei with the business. There was no problem with the check provided by MA Xiong. It was quickly cashed in and the 14 million was all deposited into Xia ruofei’s account. The counter staff who was serving Xia ruofei even took the initiative to upgrade Xia ruofei’s card to a Platinum Card. After settling his business at the bank, Xia ruofei drove to the ornamental fish market. He parked his car and walked into the ornamental fish market. He strolled all the way to a store that sold fish tanks. As soon as Xia ruofei entered the shop, the owner welcomed him warmly and asked,””Sir, do you need a fish tank?” “Yes, I want to buy a bigger fish tank.” Xia ruofei nodded. “Then may I ask what kind of fish you are raising? How big is it?” The boss asked. Xia ruofei said,”Red Dragon, that’s a big one. How big is your fish tank?” “Yo! It’s a Red Arowana!” The boss smiled and said,”the boss looks like a rich man!” “Boss, the requirements for a Dragon VAT are higher, so it’s usually custom – made,” he introduced. We provide professional fish tank customization services. Under normal circumstances, the length of the Dragon tank is three times the length of the Arowana and the width is 1.2 times the width of the Arowana. There are not many restrictions on the height of the Dragon tank, about 60 centimeters is enough. How big do you need?” Xia ruofei calculated silently and said,””Then it should be at least 2.8 to 3 meters long ... And a little wider, 80 centimeters wide!” The owner was taken aback. Very few people would order such a large fish tank. People who raised Arowana would make 1.5 meters, 1.8 meters, and a bigger one would be 2 meters. This was already considered a big size, but Xia ruofei wanted 2.8 to 3 meters. How big was his fish? Thinking of this, the boss said,”yo, Sir, your Red Dragon is almost one meter long?” That’s really the best! The red Arowana are at most 80 to 90 cm long. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s not that long yet, but it’ll grow up sooner or later!” The fish tank was completed in one step. By the way, can you make such a big fish tank here?” “Of course, no problem!” The owner quickly said,”the quality of the custom – made fish tank in our store is absolutely first – Class. This one is one of the best in the entire ornamental fish market. Don’t worry!” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. “Sir, please choose the style first!” The boss said. “Alright!” Xia ruofei followed the shop owner to the counter. The shop owner took out an album and showed it to Xia ruofei. “Sir,” the owner said,”here are all the fish tank styles that can be customized in our store. Take a look and see which one you like.” Xia ruofei casually flipped through it and asked,””Can you introduce me to a few high – end models?” “No problem, no problem!” The boss said happily. Merchants loved customers who didn’t lack money. Usually, such customers wouldn’t be too calculative about the price as long as the quality of the items was good. The owner enthusiastically recommended three fish tanks to Xia ruofei. The three fish tanks had different selling points, and of course, their prices were different as well. Xia ruofei thought for a while and chose a fish tank that cost around 8000. Among the three fish tanks recommended by the owner, this was the lowest price, while the other two cost around 10000 to 20000 each. The owner was a little surprised. He had thought that Xia ruofei would choose the other two more expensive models. Although this model was made of exquisite materials, with complete filters and lighting, its selling point was the quality of the materials and the exquisite workmanship. The other two were different. One was equipped with a professional multi – layer filter system, which could significantly improve the water quality. The other introduced the concept of intelligence. Through the supporting APP, one could check the water quality indicators at any time, and even remotely carry out the operation of filtering and changing water. Of course, the boss did not know that the water quality was the least of Xia ruofei’s concerns when he was raising Red Arowana. If he were to use the spiritual pond water to raise the fish, would he have to worry about the water quality? The materials and equipment were all ready. It would take about three days to order a fish tank. After Xia ruofei paid the deposit, he left the address of the villa to the boss and agreed to pay the rest after the fish tank was delivered to his house in three days. After settling the fish tank, Xia ruofei was ready to return to the farm. As he drove, he thought about the 14 million in his account and couldn’t help but feel an unbearable itch in his heart. He wanted to get some more Jade for the spirit map scroll to absorb.
