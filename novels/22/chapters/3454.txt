Chapter 3455: Don’t believe in evil (1)

Translator: 549690339

On the 300th level, the pressure still increased. However, Xia ruofei was already experienced, so he was well prepared. Although his body was a little shaky and the vital Qi in his body was shaking violently, he still stood firmly on the steps and quickly stabilized his vital Qi with the powerful “great Dao technique” technique.

Then, he climbed up step by step with a strong sense of rhythm.

If someone were to stand at the bottom of the Obsidian stairway and look up, Xia ruofei’s figure would be very small.

He had already climbed more than half of the steps.

However, the top of the stairs still looked out of reach.

The pressure from the stairway was getting stronger and stronger, and Xia ruofei felt that it was getting more and more difficult.

However, his heart was still extremely firm. He was determined to climb up and did not consider the gains and losses at all.

He didn’t even raise his head to look at the light screen gate at the top of the heaven staircase anymore, because he was worried that he would cower and feel despair because of the distance and the strong pressure.

Hence, Xia ruofei was now staring at the steps in front of him. With a determined expression, he climbed up slowly but with a strong sense of rhythm.

Three hundred and thirty steps, three hundred and fifty steps, three hundred and eighty steps…

Xia ruofei’s expression became more and more pained. Beads of sweat appeared on his forehead and his face turned red. The pressure was so strong that he couldn’t resist it with all his might. His body was constantly being squeezed by tens of thousands of pounds of force, and the vital Qi in his body was shaking more and more violently.

Although his steps were difficult, he still maintained a good pace, and just like that, he approached the four hundredth step.

On the three hundred and ninety – ninth step.

Xia ruofei stood firmly on the steps. The veins on his face were protruding and his sweat was dripping on the Obsidian steps. Although his legs were stable, there was not a single part of his body that was not under the pressure. He felt as if his bones were about to break. Even when he released all his vital Qi, he could not completely offset the pressure. He could only rely on his physical body to withstand it.

Xia ruofei was panting heavily. The great Dao technique in his body was running wildly, and the violent vital Qi was calming down bit by bit.

There was a hint of madness in his eyes. He made an exception and looked up at the light screen door at the top of the steps.

At this moment, he was only a hundred steps away from the top.

If he had just reached level 100, it would have been as easy as eating and drinking for him.

However, after nearly four hundred steps, each step he took required him to withstand a huge pressure. Although the light curtain Door was not far away, it actually seemed even more unattainable. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei caught his breath. His lips trembled as he squeezed out,””I’ve never believed in heresy!”

In fact, due to the huge pressure, it was hard for him to speak. It was also very physically exhausting. However, after Xia ruofei said it through gritted teeth, it seemed like he had used more strength.

He circulated his cultivation technique a few more times, and then his eyes revealed a trace of ruthlessness. He gritted his teeth and stepped onto the four hundredth step.

BOOM!

Xia ruofei felt his brain explode. A huge pressure hit him in the face. He felt as if he was at the bottom of the sea. The water pressure was enough to turn a submarine into scrap metal. At the same time, the yuan Qi in his body that had just calmed down was boiling like a pot.

The thing that gave Xia ruofei the biggest headache was that the spiritual pressure had increased to the point where he could not bear it. His head was buzzing.

In that hidden space enshrouded in purple mist.

Qing Xuan Taoist priest and immortal mountain river also secretly clenched their fists. Although their faces were calm, their eyes revealed a trace of tension.

Both of them knew that the 400th step was a hurdle. If Xia ruofei couldn’t withstand the huge impact, he might be thrown out instantly and be eliminated. Of course, strictly speaking, Xia ruofei had already passed the threshold of the 200th step. Even if he was teleported out, it wouldn’t be considered an elimination. However, if they couldn’t even reach the 400th step, this result would not meet their expectations.

If Xia ruofei could withstand the pressure on the four hundredth step, he would be able to continue for a few more steps. After the four hundredth step, the pressure on the subsequent steps would slow down. Most of the cultivators who could reach the four hundredth step were rarely eliminated at the four hundred first or four hundred second step. Most of them could go on for another ten or twenty steps, and some could even persist for a few dozen steps.

As such, level 400 was extremely important.

In the mirror, Xia ruofei’s body swayed a few times and his face showed an extremely painful expression. However, he quickly moved his right foot up the next step. His body was still trembling uncontrollably, especially his legs. This was a sign that he could be thrown out by the huge force at any time.

Qing Xuan Taoist priest and Shan He Zhenren could not help but worry, especially Shan He Zhenren. Although he and Xia ruofei had never met before, he admired this young man who had inherited his mountain river spiritual map. Xia ruofei’s performance in the trial Pagoda had made Shan He extremely satisfied..
