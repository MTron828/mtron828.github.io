3287 Victory of mathematics_

After Taoist Zhen Yang finished his question, he looked at Xia ruofei with a smile.

Xia ruofei looked relaxed. He thought for a while and said,””Daoist priest, the answer to this question is not unique. There should be at least 23 items in this pile, then 128, then 233, and so on. Each answer plus 105 would give a new answer, so there are countless answers. ”

Xia ruofei’s answer could be expressed mathematically as 23+105n, where n was a whole number greater than or equal to 1.

Xia ruofei’s answer was very rigorous and flawless. Even if old Daoist Zhen Yang wanted to find any flaws, it would be impossible.

Therefore, he only pondered for a moment before nodding and saying,””Scholar, you’re a genius! This problem has been solved!”

This time, old Taoist Zhen Yang didn’t even have the mood to ask Xia ruofei to explain the calculation method. He immediately judged that Xia ruofei had solved the problem successfully.

Very quickly, old Daoist Zhen Yang continued,”I have one last question, and I hope that you can answer it!”

Xia ruofei secretly heaved a sigh of relief. He was afraid that these basic math questions would go on and on. Although they were not difficult for him, they were a waste of time.

Moreover, the test on the first floor of the tower was mathematics, which was really unexpected.

Fortunately, the Almighty who set up these levels was not too mischievous, and only arranged three questions in total.

Hence, Xia ruofei only had one thought in his mind, and that was to end it as soon as possible!

Hearing old Daoist Zhen Yang’s words, he quickly said,”Daoist priest, please speak!”

“The last question is quite difficult, but I can only give you the time it takes for an incense stick to burn. I hope that you can continue to work hard and solve all the problems in one go!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.”Please speak. I’m all ears!”

“There are twenty trees today, four in each row,” Zhen Yang replied. How do I plant it to obtain the sixteen – element tree?”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei was slightly stunned. This time, old Taoist Zhen Yang really brought out a world – Class mathematics problem! However, this sixteen – row chart was not very challenging, because as early as the 16th century, mathematicians from ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, Ancient Egypt, and other places had completed the sixteen – row chart, and it was widely used in the decorative patterns of some elegant western buildings.

However, Xia ruofei thought about it again. This secret realm had existed for at least a few thousand years. At that time, the 16 – line Atlas had not been created, so this question was very difficult. If Xia ruofei did not know the answer in advance, he would not have been able to figure out the correct drawing method in the time it takes for an incense stick to burn.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei was well – read and had seen this classic mathematical problem before.

Hence, after Xia ruofei heard the question, he was confident that he could pass this round.

“Daoist priest Zhen Yang, can I have a pen and paper?” he asked with a smile.

Old Taoist Zhen Yang thought that Xia ruofei needed to do some deduction, which was normal. Many people had used up enough paper to fill a room to solve this question, but they might not be able to solve it.

Hence, Xia ruofei could not deduce it directly in his mind. He still had to use pen and paper.

Old Daoist Zhen Yang nodded with a smile and gestured for Qing Feng to bring paper and a brush. He even specially instructed Qing Feng to grind the ink for Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei walked to the side of the table, laid the paper flat on the table, and pressed it with a paperweight. Then, he picked up the wolf – Hair brush, dipped it in the ink, and began to draw on the paper.

A square quickly appeared on the paper. Xia ruofei marked the four corners black and then accurately marked two points on each side.

After entering the Golden core stage, Xia ruofei’s physical fitness had improved. He also had a strong spiritual power and was excellent in fine control. Therefore, he didn’t need a ruler at all. The square he drew was quite accurate, and every line was straight, as if it was printed on.

Then, Xia ruofei connected the two points on each side to the two points on the opposite side and the point on the other side, which was further away from them.

Another 24 straight lines were drawn without any error.

This way, an octagonal shape was formed inside the square.

Xia ruofei smiled and marked every top of the Octagon that was formed by the intersection of the internal lines in black. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Before Taoist Zhen Yang could react, Xia ruofei had already placed the brush against the inkstone and said with a smile,”Daoist Zhen Yang, I’ve already completed it!”

Old Taoist Zhen Yang thought that Xia ruofei was just making a draft and doing some calculations. He didn’t expect Xia ruofei to start answering immediately and even finish it in such a short time. This was a joke!

Xia ruofei was given five minutes to think and answer each question, but he always came up with the answer without thinking. Not to mention one question, even after he finished the first part of the three questions, he only burned one head in the time it took for an incense stick to burn!

It’s done?

Old Taoist Zhen Yang was in disbelief, but when he looked at the diagram that Xia ruofei had drawn, he immediately knew that Xia ruofei had solved the problem.

Even cultivators who were proficient in mathematics would be stumped by this problem. It was rare to find someone who could solve it in the time it took to burn an incense stick.

However, Xia ruofei had finished the question in less than ten seconds. He did not even hesitate to write down the answer as if he did not even need to think.

“Daoist Zhen Yang, is my answer correct?” Xia ruofei asked.

Daoist Zhen Yang came back to his senses with a wry smile.”Yes ...”

“This means that I’ve helped you ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Of course!” Old Daoist Zhen Yang said,”scholar Xia is indeed exceptionally intelligent. This old Daoist is in awe!”

“Where? You’re overpraising me!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”actually, the arrangement of the 16 lines isn’t that difficult. I can still arrange 18 or even 20 lines!”

“What?” When old Daoist Zhen Yang heard this, his eyes widened.”Scholar Xia, are you serious?”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded,”of course it’s true!” However, the Taoist priest’s question only asked me to draw out the arrangement of 16 lines, so I answered according to the requirements. ”

“Yes, yes, yes! This poor Daoist didn’t deny scholar Xia’s answer. ” Old Daoist Zhen Yang hurriedly said,”however, if you don’t mind, can you also draw out the 18 – line and 20 – line diagrams that you mentioned?”

After saying that, old Daoist Zhen Yang quickly added,”This can also be counted as the answer to the last question. If the answer is even better, then our true yang temple’s gift of thanks to you will be even more generous! Scholar Xia, how is it? Can you draw another one?”

This was equivalent to an additional question. If Yingying answered correctly, she would get extra points, but if she answered wrong, she wouldn’t lose any points.

As someone who had gone through nine years of compulsory education, Xia ruofei was already familiar with this model, so he was not surprised.

However, when he was a student, Xia ruofei was too lazy to study the additional questions.

But today, when he heard that the more lines of atlases he drew, the more generous the gifts would be, his eyes lit up.

Obviously, that was to say, the higher the quality of the answer, the greater the final mission reward!

How could Xia ruofei reject such a free gift?

Furthermore, this might be a difficult problem for other cultivators, but for Xia ruofei, it was a free point question!

Because of this twenty trees question, in the 18th century, the mathematician Gauss had already guessed that he could arrange the eighteen lines. However, until his death, he did not take out an Official Chart. It was not until the 19th century that the United States interesting mathematician Lloyd completed Gauss ‘conjecture and drew an eighteen – line chart. At the end of the 20th century, electronic computer technology flourished. With the help of computers, two experts successfully completed the twenty – line chart.

...

Xia ruofei had seen these two atlases and had memorized them.

As long as he could draw out the diagram that he had already memorized, he would be able to get more generous rewards. Why not?
