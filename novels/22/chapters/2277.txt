2278 Expanding the herb garden (2)

As expected, Bai Qingqing immediately nodded and said,””I promise! I will definitely not cause you any trouble!”

Xia ruofei nodded.”I’ll think about it. But I can’t do it these few days.”

Bai Qingqing was a little disappointed. She pouted and said,””Then don’t forget!”

“Don’t worry! When have I ever gone back on my word?” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Someone seems to have forgotten about embezzling my world stone ...” Bai Qingqing said disdainfully.

“I’m going to Sue you for slander!” Xia ruofei said,”what do you mean by I’m greedy for world stones? We’ve already agreed to distribute the world stones according to our contribution. I feel that my distribution is very fair, alright?”

Bai Qingqing snorted and said,”I’m too lazy to argue with you!” I’m going to comprehend the spatial laws!”

With that, a white light flashed, and Bai Qingqing escaped. She found a space node accurately, closed her eyes, and began to comprehend the laws.

Xia ruofei smiled and shook his head. With a flash, he appeared beside the mountain sea realm’s spatial herb garden. The area of the Archean realm was limited, so Xia ruofei had already asked Xia Qing to move all the herbs that were originally stored in the Archean realm to the mountain sea realm. He had built a simple herb warehouse beside the herb garden. There were rows of shelves in the warehouse, and they were filled with all kinds of common herbs.

It just so happened that Xia Qing was also busy in the herb garden. In fact, Xia Qing had already sensed Xia ruofei entering the space. However, Xia ruofei was talking to Bai Qingqing, so he didn’t come over to disturb him.

Seeing Xia ruofei walk over, Xia Qing immediately put down the medicinal hoe in her hand, bowed slightly, and called out,””Good day, master!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”Xia Qing, for a period of time from now on, the demand for the medicinal herbs to make the jaded skin cream and heart – nourishing soup will increase greatly. I need you to quickly expand the planting area. The main thing is to plant the medicinal herbs needed for these two products.”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing answered without hesitation,”I wonder how much Area Master needs to expand?”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and asked,”how long will it take to expand it by ten times?”

Now, the only one who could help Xia ruofei take care of all these things in the space was Xia Qing, the spiritual puppet. He had been trying to refine his own spiritual puppet, but the preparation work was very cumbersome, and his spiritual power cultivation was still a little weak, so the possibility of adding an assistant to Xia Qing in a short time was not high.

However, after taking over miles Corporation, the demand for the raw materials for the jaded skin cream and heart nourishing soup would definitely rise. It was unrealistic to completely rely on purchasing raw materials. The best solution was to build a base for raw materials in the realm.

In any case, the area of the mountain and sea realm was growing larger and larger, and there was simply no way to use up all the land. Furthermore, the spiritual Qi in the spatial zone was so dense that the growth cycle of medicinal herbs could be shortened by a lot, and the quality would also be much higher than those purchased outside.

Xia Qing thought for a moment and said,”if we’re just expanding the planting area, two months should be enough.” “However, medicinal herbs have a growth cycle. If we want this herb garden, which is ten times its current size, to be able to start producing in a short period of time, we can only use Archean realm to cultivate it. When the medicinal herbs grow to a certain extent, we can transplant them over. This might take longer ...”

“Is three months enough?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Enough!” Xia Qing said,”in three months, even if we can’t reach ten times the production, we can at least reach seven or eight times. As time passes, the production will gradually increase. In five months, we can definitely reach ten times the current production.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”very good!” Then, from today onwards, you will focus on this task. In addition, after you harvest these herbs, you have to separate them and store them separately. In a few days, I’ll purchase a few mobile rooms and medicinal storage devices. When the time comes, I’ll build a special medicinal material warehouse and place it next to this warehouse. ”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing nodded and said.

Although this task was very difficult and boring, Xia Qing, as a soul puppet, would obey the master’s orders unconditionally. Moreover, he did not know what was difficult and what was boring. He did not even need to sleep, and could work without rest. In addition, his work efficiency was much higher than ordinary people, so this seemingly impossible task was not a problem for him.

“You can go back to your work! I want to make a batch of pills. ” Xia ruofei said with a pleasant expression.

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing bowed slightly, then picked up the medicinal hoe and continued to work.

The next step was to expand the area of the medicine garden by ten times. Xia Qing estimated that for a long time, her main energy would be concentrated on the medicine garden.

Xia ruofei shuttled through the simple medicinal warehouse with ease and familiarity. He quickly picked out more than ten medicinal herbs that he needed to make the pills today.

The old man of the Liu family had pancreatic cancer, which could be said to be the most dangerous type of cancer. It was completely cured by Traditional Chinese Medicine, but the possibility was not high. Even if bianque was reborn, it was estimated that there was no absolute cure for this illness.

But even so, Xia ruofei was confident that he could delay the development of the disease with the help of Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture.

Moreover, he planned to add a very small amount of spirit Heart Flower petals into the pill today. This way, it would basically be foolproof.

Xia ruofei had already mastered a few lost medical books. Hence, his knowledge of Chinese medicine was not much worse than some Chinese medical experts. He might not be as experienced, but his theoretical level was definitely higher than others. After all, he had inherited a few lost medical books. Any one of them was a classic.

Hence, Xia ruofei could no longer just follow the prescription mechanically.

Xia ruofei had come up with this prescription based on his knowledge of Chinese medicine and the analysis of old master Liu’s condition. Although he had used an ancient prescription, Xia ruofei had added and deleted the amount of medicinal herbs according to his own understanding.

In other words, Xia ruofei had already passed the stage of rote memorization and had begun to integrate in the field of Chinese medicine.

He skillfully placed the best charcoal in the stove and started a fire.

Then, he added the spirit pond water into the claypot and began to put in the medicinal herbs one by one.

Now, Xia ruofei was very familiar with making pills. After about an hour, there were 20 to 30 round pills in the claypot in front of Xia ruofei.

The main ingredient of these pills was actually honey. Of course, there were also Chinese medicine ingredients in it, as well as a small amount of spirit Heart Flower petals.

However, after he had boiled the entire pot of medicine into an paste, he had only added a few drops of concentrated spirit Heart Flower petal solution. In terms of composition, it was probably only one – tenth of a complete spirit Heart Flower petal.

However, Xia ruofei felt that it was enough. He predicted that after taking all these pills, elder Liu’s health would improve to a certain extent. Even the tumor would shrink to a certain extent. Anyway, the effect would definitely be there.

However, because there were too few spirit Heart Flower petals, it was absolutely impossible to completely cure him.

These 30 pills were equivalent to a course of treatment.

After seeing the effect, Xia ruofei believed that the Liu family would treat him as a life – saving straw and worship him like a god. By then, he would have a way to advance and retreat.

Xia ruofei found a beautiful porcelain bottle and put all the pills in it. Then, he carefully sealed the bottle and waved his hand. The porcelain bottle disappeared into thin air. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

In reality, Xia ruofei had already used the invisible spatial force to send him directly to the stone room in the cave in the mountain sea realm. He was just waiting for him to take him out before he went to treat old man Liu.

As for now, of course, it was better to keep it in the space. At least, the medicinal properties would not be lost at all.

After making the pill, Xia ruofei left the spirit map space.
