Li Yifu chuckled.”Senior granduncle, luxury houses are different from ordinary houses. There’s no reference price. It’s mainly based on the environment and so on.”

The driver and the Butler didn’t understand Chinese, so Li Yifu didn’t have to worry too much.

Li Yifu continued,”I’ve looked up some information. The owner of this house is Environmental Protection. You can see that he has installed a lot of solar panels. Masker has always been committed to promoting the development of clean energy, such as electric vehicles. Solar energy is also a key part of his industry.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” This brother is quite interesting ...”

While they were talking, the car had already passed through an arch that looked like a Spain Castle and entered the interior of the mansion.

Masker, who had been informed by the Butler in advance, had already come out to wait. His girlfriend, glams, was also with him.

The Bentley slowly stopped. The Butler quickly got out of the car and opened the door on Xia ruofei’s side while the chauffeur opened the door on Li Yifu’s side. The two of them stepped out.

Elon Musk took a few steps forward. He saw Xia ruofei getting out of the car on the other side and was slightly stunned. He even looked into the car, hoping to see that there were still people who hadn’t gotten out.

In America, there was no such thing as “the older the doctor, the more popular he is”. However, Xia ruofei looked too young. The learning period of medical majors was longer. Most medical students at Xia ruofei’s age were still in their master’s or doctor ‘s! He didn’t even have much practical experience, so how could he be an expert who could cure serious brain cancer?

Elon Musk suddenly felt like he had been played by Li Yifu.

Li Yifu went around the front of the car and met up with Xia ruofei on the other side. Then, the two of them walked towards Elon Musk together.

“Mr. Li!” There was a trace of displeasure on Elon Musk’s face. He frowned slightly and asked,”may I ask if the Chinese medicine expert you mentioned on the phone is here?”

Li Yifu looked at Xia ruofei beside him and smiled.””Mr. Masker, let me introduce you. This is doctor Xia from China. Doctor Xia has cured many serious malignant tumors ...”

Elon Musk didn’t believe it at all, because if this young man in front of him was really so amazing, all kinds of reports would have been overwhelming. If he could even cure late – Stage brain cancer, this kind of achievement could have won the Nobel Prize that year, and there would be no suspense at all.

In other words, if Xia ruofei was really that amazing, he would not have been so unknown.

Elon Musk confirmed that he had never seen Xia ruofei in any reports when the Australian Airlines plane landed in Saipan. As a passenger who had never flown a plane before, Xia ruofei successfully landed and saved hundreds of people on the plane. Such a heroic story was favored by the Western media, and there were many reports on it in the global media during that period. Unfortunately, Xia ruofei was now using the image of Xia Tian. Even if Elon Musk had an impression of the news of the forced landing of Australian Airlines, he would never associate the Xia ruofei who had changed her appearance with the legendary hero of that time.

There was a hint of mockery in elonmask’s eyes, but he still asked politely,””Doctor Xia, may I ask which Medical University did you graduate from? Which hospital are you currently working at?”

Xia ruofei had a faint smile on his face.””I didn’t graduate from a Medical University. In fact, I didn’t go to college. Also, although I have a Chinese medical certificate, I don’t work in any hospital. ”

“Mr. Xia, you’ve opened your own private clinic?” “What’s wrong?” asked elonmask.

In the United States, private clinics and hospitals were also common, and often these private medical institutions had better standards and conditions. Of course, the cost of seeing a doctor in a private medical institution was also much higher. The general working class would go to a public hospital to see a doctor.

Xia ruofei shook his head and said,”I don’t have a clinic, nor have I been hired as someone else’s private doctor ...”

Elon Musk raised his eyebrows, then spread his hands at Li Yifu and said,””Mr. Li, this doctor Xia doesn’t seem to be the medical expert you mentioned ...”

“Mr. Masker!” Xia ruofei said directly,”Chinese medicine is more about inheritance. Many famous Chinese doctors are taught by their Masters. In our country, we also recognize the inheritance of Chinese medicine from Masters to disciples. That’s why not all Chinese medicine practitioners graduated from Chinese medicine universities.” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Xia ruofei paused and quickly continued,””Also ... I didn’t go to the hospital to work, and I didn’t do any medical work because I didn’t want to make it my profession. It’s just this time, and it has nothing to do with my medical skills. For example ...”

Xia ruofei glanced at Elon Musk and gramus. In fact, he had already used his mental power to probe them. At the same time, he had also used the “look” in Traditional Chinese Medicine to observe their situation.

After a slight pause of two seconds, Xia ruofei smiled and continued,””For example ... Even though I’m not a professional doctor, I can still tell at a glance that Mr. Masker has not been sleeping well recently, and he has serious tinnitus. In addition, if I’m not wrong, Ms. Glams ‘right arm had a fracture before, and because it didn’t recover completely back then, it often hurts, especially when the climate changes ...”

Both elonmask and gramus were stunned.

If it was possible to find out about Elon Musk’s health status and medical records through other means, then grams was not a particularly famous celebrity. Furthermore, she was not even Elon Musk’s girlfriend when her arm was fractured many years ago. She had just entered the entertainment industry and no one knew her at all. How could things from that time be found out by an investigation?

What’s more, Elon Musk’s sleep and tinnitus problems had only appeared recently. Because he had been busy with work recently, and then there was the matter of little X’s sarcoma, so he did not seek medical treatment at all. He only asked Dr. Manu briefly, so it was impossible to leave a medical record.

Unless this young doctor Xia bribed Dr. Mannu.

Regardless of whether the probability was high or not, there was no point in bribing Dr. Mannu because in the end, medical skills were the only thing that mattered. The patient was there, and little X’s illness would not get better just because Elon Musk and Grice were fooled.

Elonmask turned his gaze to grams.

With a look of disbelief on his face, he nodded and said,””When I was 18 years old, I fell off the stage during rehearsal and broke my right arm ... Over the years, my arm does hurt faintly when it rains and storms. He was very accurate ...”

“This is really shocking!” Elon Musk said,”doctor Xia, you can see so much and so accurately with your eyes. How did you do it?”

Xia ruofei said lightly,”Chinese medicine focuses on looking, listening, asking, and feeling. Looking is only one of the skills. A brilliant Chinese medicine doctor can indeed get a general judgment by observing the patient’s complexion without contact.” Of course, if you need a more accurate diagnosis, you’ll still need to take his pulse and ask about his medical history. Sometimes, you’ll also need to rely on some Western examination methods, such as CT, color ultrasound, and so on ...”

“I understand ...” Elonmask nodded, not fully understanding.

In fact, he was indeed a little confused by what Xia ruofei said. However, he had personally experienced what Xia ruofei had just shown him. Therefore, although he could not understand what Xia ruofei was saying, he still felt that he was better.

I don’t know, but it’s amazing!

The expression on Elon Musk’s face immediately became much warmer. He made an inviting gesture and said,””Mr. Li, doctor Xia, let’s go in and sit down. Please come in!”
