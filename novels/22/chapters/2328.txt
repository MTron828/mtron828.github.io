2329 It’s working (2)

In the past hour, Xia ruofei had used his spiritual power to check many times. His sea of consciousness was slowly recovering. This time, when his spiritual power came to the periphery of his consciousness, he clearly felt a trace of difference.

Song Qiming’s sea of consciousness was originally lifeless, like a silent dead land. This time, Xia ruofei felt a trace of life. Although it was weak, it was as if spring had returned to the earth or a withered tree had come back to spring.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel excited. He knew very well that this was a sign that he was about to regain consciousness!

The withered sea of consciousness had regained its vitality. Correspondingly, song Qiming’s brain activity should also gradually start to activate. At least, some of his primitive reflexes should recover.

Xia ruofei withdrew his mental strength without hesitation. Then, he stood up and carefully opened song Qiming’s eyelids. He put his hand into his pocket and took out a small flashlight from the medium.

After turning on the flashlight, Xia ruofei aimed it at song Qiming’s eyes.

As expected, song Qiming’s pupils avoided the bright light instinctively.

This was the simplest way to check. The light immunity reflex had recovered, which meant that song Qiming’s brain was no longer in a completely silent state.

Xia ruofei let out a long sigh of relief and pressed the call bell on the bedside.

Soon, the doctor on duty’s slightly nervous voice came from the communication device.”What happened?”

This was also because the on – call room could see the situation in the ward. In addition, the patient’s vital signs data would also be summarized and displayed on the monitoring screen in the on – call room. If song Qiming had given a warning because of some indicator, the doctor on – call would not have time to ask about the situation and would have rushed over directly.

Xia ruofei said,”please ask professor Chen to come here!” The patient might be regaining consciousness soon ...”

“Argh! This is impossible ...”The doctor on duty subconsciously blurted out, and then immediately said in a hurry,” it’s impossible. “I’m sorry! I ... I’ll inform professor Chen immediately!”

After a while, professor Chen came back with two neurosurgeons.

To Xia ruofei’s surprise, Ge Jun had also followed professor Chen to the intensive care unit. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Ge Jun nodded at Xia ruofei but did not say anything.

Professor Chen couldn’t wait to ask,””Mr. Xia, I heard from the doctor on duty that you told him that Secretary song might be regaining consciousness soon?”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”professor Chen, uncle song has recovered some basic reflexes. It seems that my treatment was right. I believe that he will regain consciousness soon!”

“How is this possible?” Professor Chen was dumbfounded.

However, he reacted quickly. He strode to the bed and began to perform a preliminary examination on song Qiming.

Professor Chen gasped as he examined the wound.

Pain reflex, light – repelling reflex ...

If song Qiming’s condition was considered brain – dead to professor Chen, he had a completely different conclusion now.

Even though song Qiming was still unconscious, it was obvious that his brain had not died. In fact, it seemed to be gradually working again.

Professor Chen was completely shocked when the electrocardiogram was done.

He stammered,”this ... This is too ... Too magical!” The patient’s brain is already very active ...”

After the operation on the day of the accident, song Qiming’s electrocardiogram was almost a straight line. Although it still showed some abnormalities, it was very close to a normal electrocardiogram.

Xia ruofei stood at the side calmly, knowing that he had already passed the stage of excitement.

He knew very well that as his sea of consciousness recovered, song Qiming’s brain would naturally start working again. There was no doubt about that. The only question was how long it would take for song Qiming to wake up.

After all, the soul was in the sea of consciousness. Not only was song Qiming’s sea of consciousness dried up, but his soul had also fallen into a deep sleep to protect himself.

The equipment in the intensive care unit was very complete, and most of the examinations could be done by the bedside. Professor Chen was busy at song Qiming’s bedside, performing various examinations repeatedly.

To professor Chen’s surprise, song Qiming’s condition was still improving during the examination.

This could no longer be described as a miracle, it was simply a miracle!

Ge Jun stood beside Xia ruofei and smiled,””Junior Brother Xia, I’m impressed! It seems that Secretary song will be fine ...”

Xia ruofei replied humbly,”I was just lucky!” It just so happens that I have some experience in treating brain damage. In terms of comprehensive medical skills, I can’t compare with you, senior brother GE!”

Ge Jun laughed and said,”I don’t think so!” Junior Xia, seeing how outstanding you are, I feel that I’ve really lived for ...”

He originally wanted to say “live like a dog”, but then he thought that it didn’t seem appropriate to describe himself like that, so he suddenly stopped.

Xia ruofei was amused. He looked at Ge Jun and said,””Senior GE, don’t belittle yourself. If you’re so humble, then 99% of Chinese medicine practitioners in China would probably find a piece of tofu and kill themselves ...”

Just as the two senior and junior brothers were “complimenting each other,” a wave of suppressed cheers came from the bedside.

Xia ruofei and Ge Jun looked over and saw professor Chen’s face flushed with excitement. He mumbled,””Unbelievable ... It’s simply unbelievable ... His spontaneous breathing and heartbeat have all recovered ... Oh my God ...”

Xia ruofei and Ge Jun looked at each other and a smile appeared on their faces.

Just then, Xia ruofei’s phone vibrated in his pocket.

Xia ruofei took it out and saw that it was Song Wei. He walked to the door and answered the call.

It turned out that Fang Liyun and Song Wei had been waiting in the lobby outside the intensive care unit. They were worried when they saw Xia ruofei had gone in for so long and had not come out even when it was almost time for lunch.

Then, they saw professor Chen walking in with a few doctors, and they became even more worried.

Fang Liyun and Song Wei had been waiting anxiously outside the door. They wanted to call Xia ruofei to ask about the situation, but they were worried that something had happened to song Qiming and he was in emergency treatment. If they called now, they would disturb Xia ruofei.

After hesitating for a while, Song Wei decided to call Xia ruofei because she couldn’t take it anymore.

Besides, she was very familiar with Xia ruofei’s abilities. She knew that even if Xia ruofei was trying to save song Qiming, he would not be affected by a phone call.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh when he heard the reason. He said,””Wei Wei, wait a moment!”

Then, he covered the phone and walked back to professor Chen.””Professor Chen, uncle song’s family is a little worried outside. Can you ... Let them in? I promise they won’t interfere with the treatment!”

Song Qiming’s identity was special, and Xia ruofei was technically his “senior”. Professor Chen could not reject such a small request. He nodded without hesitation and said,””No problem!”

Then, he turned to a graduate student who was also participating in the examination and said,””Xiao Li, go and bring Secretary song’s wife and daughter in!”

“Alright, teacher!” Graduate student Xiao Li immediately said and then walked to the door of the ward.

Xia ruofei finally let go of the phone and smiled.””Weiwei, professor Chen has sent someone to pick you up. Come in and talk! Don’t worry! Uncle song is fine!”

“Oh! Alright!” Song Wei’s voice was trembling. Xia ruofei could tell that she was nervous.

After hanging up the phone, professor Chen’s student, Xiao Li, came in with Fang Liyun and Song Wei who had changed into hazmat suits.

As soon as Fang Liyun entered the room, she asked nervously,””Ruofei, what happened? Why are there so many people here?”
