2939 Star level service (2)

Lin Yue quickly translated these words for Ma Jia and then said,””Yes, Mr. Captain! We really don’t know who this Captain Brook is ...”

Nelsen laughed and said,””That’s a lucky guy! If Mr. Xia had not been on the plane that time, Brook would have been buried in the sea! Therefore, when he heard that Mr. Xia had entrusted the Mei ‘ya group to rent the plane, Brook wished he could put on his flight uniform again and learn how to fly a Boeing plane again! Hahaha!”

Back then, Xia ruofei had turned the tide and saved an Airbus A350 from Macao. That was big news. It was also because of this that Xia ruofei became a popular celebrity on the internet. Therefore, whether it was Lin Yue or ma su, who was in a closed – off camp at that time, they were very familiar with this matter. When they heard what Nelson said, they immediately reacted. It turned out that Brook, whom Nelson had mentioned, was the captain of the plane that Xia ruofei had saved.

At this moment, a person came out from behind the accommodation ladder and said,””Nelsen! Can’t you leave me some face in front of my Chinese friends?”

Ma su and Lin Yue took a closer look and could still vaguely recognize that this should be the key figure in the forced landing of Captain Brook, Jian Jia, because of a Chinese man. Therefore, the local media had carried out a lot of reports. As one of the main characters, Brook’s image also frequently appeared in the media reports, so the two of them more or less had some impression of him.

Captain Brook was also wearing a short – sleeved flight uniform today, but he didn’t wear the captain’s epaulet. It was probably because there was a rule in Australia that retired captains were not allowed to wear epaulets to perform missions.

Nelsen laughed and hugged Brook. Then, he said to Ma Jia and Lin Yue,”Let me introduce to everyone, this is the lucky Captain, Mr. Brook! Under his strong request, the company agreed to let him participate in this flight mission as a consultant ...”

Nelsen shrugged and said,””God bless, I hope he doesn’t affect the safety of the flight!”

Brook glared at Nelsen and said,””Hell! You old man, stop talking!”

After that, Brook put on a sincere smile and said to Ma Jia and Lin Yue,”Hello, Chinese friends! Welcome to this flight!”

Brook was speaking Chinese, but his accent was very strange. Fortunately, he could barely understand what it meant. He probably learned it at the last minute and memorized the syllables.

“Thank you!” Ma Jia said in English with a smile. Captain Brook!”

Brook then switched to English and said,”For the next ten hours, I promise you’ll receive the best service from Quto’s staff! Because you’re Chinese and Mr. Xia’s employees, you’re qiuhang’s most distinguished guests!”

After Ma Jia heard the translation, she nodded and said,””Thank you very much! Thank you for your hard work, everyone!”

He sighed in his heart. Xia ruofei was no longer the little soldier in his company. Now, not only did he have a net worth of hundreds of millions, but he also had a prominent identity and amazing connections. Even the foreign airline company and pilot respected him so much.

“I’ve already taken up quite a bit of everyone’s time, so ... Let’s board the plane quickly!”Brook said with a smile. I don’t want to delay Mr. Xia’s business because of our small talk!”

Ma Jia nodded, then waved her hand and ordered,””Two roads to the left! Boarding! The two on the right, follow from the back!”

The security guards immediately formed two rows and stepped up the ramp in neat steps. They entered the cabin and placed their luggage and took their seats under the guidance of the flight attendant.

Ma su and Lin Yue stood beside the accommodation ladder. After all the members had boarded the plane, ma su said to Qin Yanan, who came to the tarmac to send the plane off,””Manager Qin, everyone has worked hard today, please go back!”

“Captain MA, then I wish everyone a safe journey!” Qin Yanan said with a smile.

Ma Jia nodded and shook hands with Qin Yanan before climbing up the accommodation ladder with Lin Yue. He stood at the cabin door and waved goodbye to Qin Yanan and the other two staff members on the tarmac. Then, he turned and walked into the cabin.

After everyone boarded the plane, the cabin door was quickly closed. The pilots entered the cockpit to prepare for take – off. Usually, during a dual flight, both flight units would be in the cockpit at the same time during the take – off and landing stages. This way, if there were any special circumstances, they could deal with it together to maximize the utilization of the cockpit resources. Therefore, the so – called taking turns to rest was when the plane was cruising in the sky.

Brook was not responsible for the flight, so he did not enter the cockpit immediately.

The arrangement of quinba was very thoughtful. The flight crew also arranged two Chinese female flight attendants. One of them was a senior employee who would be the chief flight attendant of the chartered flight.

After all, the Chinese face could make these Chinese passengers feel closer. Moreover, the Chinese of these two people was quite good, so they could communicate well with the passengers during the flight.

During the preparation stage of the flight in the cockpit, the Chinese female Purser gave everyone a routine safety reminder in Chinese.

Then, Brook appeared at the front of the cabin with a microphone in his hand. The female attendant stood beside him as a translator.

Brook greeted everyone with a smile. Then, he reminisced about the unforgettable horror in the air. Finally, he said with emotion,””It’s no exaggeration to say that Mr. Xia ruofei gave me a Second Life. He allowed me to fly my last flight and retire safely! I’m very grateful to Mr. Xia and all the Chinese people! Therefore, I’m very honored to be able to join the crew as a non – staff Consultant to serve our distinguished guests! I hope that everyone will be able to enjoy this trip in the next ten hours! If you have any needs, please feel free to ask me or the purser. We will do our best to satisfy you!”

After the Chinese chief flight attendant translated Brook’s words, the cabin was filled with warm applause.

Everyone felt a sense of honor and pride in their hearts. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

At the same time, everyone admired Xia ruofei even more. They were full of anticipation for their future work under Xia ruofei.

Soon, the flight controlled by quinba was allowed to be pushed out. Brook also returned to the cockpit after bowing to everyone.

The Boeing 757 heavy – duty aircraft of Qinba was moving and stopping on the runway before it was finally allowed to enter the runway and take off.

The pre – take – off inspection had been completed during the taxiing process. When the nose of the plane was aimed at the runway, Nielson immediately pushed the throttle handle to the take – off thrust. The plane gained a surge of power and began to increase its speed rapidly on the runway.

The security guards in the cabin felt a strong push on their backs, and the scenery outside the porthole was quickly moving backward.

The plane’s speed was getting faster and faster. When it reached VR, Nelson gently pulled the control stick back, and the heavy passenger plane suddenly rose into the air. The heavy body of the plane steadily flew into the sky under the effect of the lifting force on both wings.

The security guards looked at the building outside the porthole getting smaller and smaller, and each of them couldn’t help but feel excited. They were slowly looking forward to a new life.

After more than 20 minutes of climbing, the Boeing 757 finally entered the cruising altitude. When the seat belt indicator light went out, one of the flight crew’s pilots returned to the cabin to take a break, and the crew began to busy provide food service to the security members who were on the chartered flight.

Just as Brook said, Qinba provided service to everyone with the highest standards. Even the side dishes on the plane were much more sumptuous than those in the economy Class on ordinary flights. This was not agreed on in the charter contract. It was an additional service provided by Qinba.
