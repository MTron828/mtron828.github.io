Zhou leiyun had tasted the sweetness of investing in football clubs.

Initially, glory world corporation’s acquisition of the Spanish clubs did not cause much response in the country. Now, there were many Chinese clubs, including Granada, who was about to rush into La Liga, and even Inter Milan, who was in Serie A, were actually Chinese teams. It was just that the Spanish club made a clever move and brought in Wu Lei. In just two or three months, they had become a well – known club in China.

The direct benefit of this wave of reputation harvesting was that glory world corporation’s stock price continued to rise. Indirectly, there was also an invisible reputation, which was even more difficult to estimate. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

After Xia ruofei heard this, he shrugged and said,””That’s good! 100 million euros, it can only be more, not less. You have to think about it. If we play in Europe next season, we will face a situation of multiple tournaments at the beginning of the season, especially when RCD Espanyol has not appeared in the European arena for many years. We will definitely have all kinds of difficulties adapting to it. When the bench is not deep enough, we may collapse in multiple tournaments. Not only will we not gain anything in the European tournament, but the league will also fall into the mire of relegation. So, bringing in players is necessary. And we must bring in good players at all costs!”

“Understood!” Zhou leiyun nodded and said,”the club has already sent Scouts to inspect the players. Once Ruby Heard that the club was going to vigorously sign players, he became more enthusiastic about his work!”

At this time, Song Wei said,”wasn’t there a rumor some time ago that his former club, Real Betis, was going to invite him back and let him coach the Betis team next season?”

Zhou leiyun was slightly taken aback. He said in surprise,””I didn’t expect miss song to know so much about our club.”

Zhou leiyun had only said it casually, but Song Wei’s face had inexplicably heated up, and she actually felt a little guilty.

After all, to the public, Ling Qingxue was Xia ruofei’s official girlfriend. This was something that everyone knew.

“I just happened to see this news a few days ago,” replied Song Wei quickly.

Zhou leiyun smiled.”That’s true. Also, Royal Betis is really in contact with Ruby. I’m not sure if Ruby was tempted before, but he’s clearly rejected now.” This is all thanks to President Xia!”

“Just because I said that the club will spend no less than 100 million euros on the transfer fee next season?” Xia ruofei asked, raising his eyebrows.

“Not entirely ...” Zhou leiyun said with a smile.”Ruby told me frankly that, in addition to the 100 million euro transfer fee that President Xia said, which made him more confident about the multi – line battle situation that the team might face next season, what made him determined to renew his contract was president Xia’s superior skills. Although President Xia can not guarantee that he will participate in every game with the team, as long as President Xia can provide support for the team in key games, it will be much easier for him to be the manager. Maybe he can make a name for himself in the European arena next season!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”so you’ve been waiting for me here! It’s not enough to make me run around this season and you’re thinking about it next season?”

Zhou leiyun quickly smiled apologetically and said,”the capable do more work!” President Xia is a fan of football. Now that the club is United and the results are so gratifying, don’t you want the club to flourish in the future?”

Xia ruofei replied noncommittally,”it depends!” It seems that no matter how good the club’s performance is, I don’t have any benefits! On the other hand, someone’s company stock price ... It’s going up like crazy!”

Zhou leiyun replied without hesitation,”director Xia, glory world Corporation will always welcome any partnership with you on the capital level. I can transfer a portion of my shares to you or use your paradise corporation’s shares in exchange. There’s no problem with that!”

Zhou leiyun was determined to be deeply tied to Xia ruofei. If Xia ruofei was willing, he could not wait to give some shares of glory world Corporation to Xia ruofei for free. However, he knew that Xia ruofei would not take it for free, which was why he suggested a capital cooperation.

Of course, Xia ruofei wasn’t too interested in it. He smiled and said,””I was just joking, let’s talk about this later! Let’s watch the game first ...”

Zhou leiyun could not help but feel a little disappointed. However, since Xia ruofei did not seem to be interested, he could not rush to ask Xia ruofei to invest in glory world Corporation. Hence, he nodded and said,””Alright! President Xia, you can consider my suggestion when you have the time...Oh right, there’s another piece of good news for the club ...”

“Oh?” Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows.”Can you tell me?”

“Our opponent for seventh place, team sevilya, has just started their game. Our staff has sent news from the venue that they are now one goal behind!” Zhou leiyun smiled as he waved his phone.”It happened while we were chatting!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but say,””There’s basically no suspense in our game now. If the sevilya team ends with this score, then ... We can rise to the seventh place?”

“Yes, I am!” Zhou leiyun said excitedly,”if that’s the case, then the initiative will be in our hands in the remaining three rounds. As long as we don’t make any mistakes, we don’t have to hope that our opponents will make any mistakes to reverse the situation. After all, we no longer have the chance to face off against Sylvia!”

“That’s great!” After Xia ruofei finished speaking, he picked up the glass of wine on the coffee table and said,”then what are we still talking about? Let’s drink one! Let’s cheer for sevilya’s opponent!”

Zhou leiyun laughed out loud when he heard that and said,” that makes sense!” Drink one!”

Everyone laughed and clinked their glasses, then continued to watch the game.

“Oh right, ruofei, we made a bet just now on when you’ll score, and in the end ...”Ling Qingxue said with a smile.

“Who won in the end? ” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“No one won!” Ling Qingxue said, ” Wei Wei is the closest to the correct answer, but she’s still a long way off. Who knew you would score in 15 seconds! ”

“Yup! I’m embarrassed to say that I won!” Song Wei said.

“Therefore!” Ling Qingxue said, ” we had originally agreed that whoever lost would treat everyone to a big meal! In the end, we decided that you’ll be the one treating. Who asked you to not play by the rules? ”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”no problem! This meal is on me! You guys pick the place! That’s right, if the Spanish team could really rise to seventh place after this round! I’ll treat the entire team to a big meal!”

Naturally, there was no suspense in the game. The Spanish fans were singing and dancing in the stands for the entire half of the game, enjoying the joy of victory in advance.

To the Chinese fans in the stadium and the fans who were watching the live broadcast in China, it was actually a hat – trick by the referee, Xia ruofei, and a goal by Wu Lei. They even had three assists. Their performances were perfect!

However, everyone still felt that something was missing. It was Xia ruofei’s performance that raised everyone’s expectations, so everyone hoped that Wu Lei would score another goal in the second half.

Even if they couldn’t perform a hat – trick, they could at least do something like a plum blossom.

After all, a fish belly was not something that could be encountered often.

Wu Lei did not let everyone down. To be precise, the entire Spanish team did not let everyone down. In the 45 minutes of the second half, the Spanish team scored three more goals, one of which was the goal in the 80th minute.

The goal was not very exciting. Both sides of the game had some physical problems at this time. Wu Lei was still energetic. He still used his best running position and keenly found an opening. Then, he used his speed to tear open Herona’s defense. After breaking into the penalty area, he shot with a strong kick and steadily scored the ball.

After Wu Lei scored this goal, the Spanish team finally stopped their frenzied scoring. In the end, they swept Herona with an 8 – 0 disparity and obtained a hearty big victory.
