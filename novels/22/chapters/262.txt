At eighto’ clock in the evening, Xia ruofei’s flight landed smoothly on the runway of Sanshan Changping International Airport. After getting off the plane, Xia ruofei received a text message as soon as he turned on his phone. The message was sent by manager Feng of the southeast Branch of Hengfeng jewelry under the Hengfeng group of the MA family in Hong Kong. She told Xia ruofei that the 4 million Yuan worth of Jade that Ma Zhiming had asked her to prepare was ready and she could go over to get the goods at any time. It was already night time and there was still a hornet’s nest in the spirit map space. Even if Xia ruofei got the Jade, he could not use it to upgrade the space immediately. If the hornet’s nest mutated during the space upgrade, it would be even more troublesome. Although the previous upgrades had not affected the animals in the interspace at all, the hornet’s nest was different from the red Arowana and the puppy. They were very aggressive. Hence, Xia ruofei decided to deal with the hornet’s nest first before upgrading the interspace. Hence, Xia ruofei replied to manager Feng’s message and made an appointment to go over tomorrow morning to trade the Jade. After picking up the pickup truck at the airport overnight parking lot, Xia ruofei drove back to Taoyuan farm. The car’s headlights lit up the courtyard of the villa. Lightning came out from the doghouse in the corner of the villa. When it saw that it was Xia ruofei, the aggressive lightning immediately changed its posture and lovingly wandered around the car. Xia ruofei opened the door and got out of the car. He hugged lightning, who was standing on its hind legs, and affectionately rubbed its hair. He smiled and asked,””Lightning, how have you been these past few days when I wasn’t home?” Lightning immediately barked twice and wagged its tail even more vigorously. Xia ruofei smiled and said,”good girl. I’ll prepare something delicious for you tomorrow.” Let’s go back!” Lightning stuck out its tongue and licked Xia ruofei’s palm. Then, it went back to its kennel. Ye Lingyun had already seen Xia ruofei’s car enter the farm through the surveillance camera in his room, so he walked to the door at this time. “Brother Xia!” “Ling Yun, you’ve worked hard these past two days.” Xia ruofei smiled and continued to ask,”is everything normal at the farm and construction site?” “Don’t worry, brother Xia! Everything is normal. ” Ye Lingyun replied,”the construction progress is very fast. The first layer of cement has been completed!” “You’ve worked hard!” Xia ruofei patted ye Lingyun’s shoulder and said. “Brother Xia, have you had dinner?” “Do you want me to prepare something for you to eat?” ye linyun asked. “I ate on the plane.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’m going back to my room. You should rest early too!” “Woof! Brother Xia, you should rest!” Ye linyun said,”I still have to bring lightning for a patrol around 10 O’ clock later!” Ever since the Peach Blossom Farm officially started operating, ye Lingyun, the head of security, had been fulfilling his duties and would patrol a few times every night. Xia ruofei took two steps and turned back.””Ling Yun, I think you’re too tired. You have to check the surveillance cameras and patrol the area. There’s no one to change shifts with you!” “This is nothing, brother Xia!” Ye linyun laughed. It’s much easier than when I was in the Army ...” “Even so, you can’t do it in a row.” Xia ruofei said,”how about this, Ling Yun? let’s recruit two more people and make them the first batch of employees for the security Department of paradise Corporation! Otherwise, it won’t be good for you to always be the commander. See if there are any suitable candidates. It would be best if they are our retired comrades. Help me recommend two!” “Brother Xia, there’s no need ... I can do it alone!” Ye linyun said. “This is an order!” Xia ruofei did not give him any room for negotiation.”You can hold on now, but what about after a long time? Also, we’ll have more and more business in the future, and the scale of the farm will also grow bigger and bigger. Can you take care of it alone?” Xia ruofei continued,”it’s settled then. Look around these two days!” We’ll try to get the recruitment done within a week!” Seeing Xia ruofei’s determination, ye Lingyun could only say helplessly,””Alright then! I’ll contact my former comrades and ask. ” Xia ruofei nodded and continued to walk up the stairs. “Brother Xia, thank you!” Ye Lingyun said from behind Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei waved his hand without looking back and went upstairs in a hurry. After he returned to his room, Xia ruofei immediately locked the door and summoned the spirit painting from his palm. This time, he didn’t rush into the medium. Instead, he used his mind to sense the situation of the Hornets in the medium. When he noticed that the hornet’s nest was very calm and only a few hornet’s nest were flying around, he entered the medium. Under Xia ruofei’s deliberate control, he appeared more than 30 meters away from hornet’s nest. Once he entered the medium, Xia ruofei was on high alert. If there were any problems, he would leave the spirit map space at the first moment. Fortunately, everything was calm and the Hornet did not notice Xia ruofei’s sudden appearance. In fact, they enjoyed the environment of this space very much. The rich spirit Qi made them want to linger. From the time the hornet’s nest was put into the medium until now, only a little more than a day had passed in the outside world, but 30 to 40 days had passed in the medium. These hornet’s nest had already adapted to the environment in the space. Xia ruofei used his mind to connect with the space. Very quickly, an invisible force wrapped the hornet’s nest up as if it was covered with a transparent cover. Xia ruofei carefully approached the hornet’s nest. In reality, it was rather easy for Xia ruofei to kill the hornet’s nest in the space. He just had to use the invisible force of the space to restrain the entire hornet’s nest. Then, whether he used a flame torch to burn these Hornets or simply moved the entire hornet’s nest under the water of the fish pond, he could kill them all without missing a single one. However, when Xia ruofei thought about the terrifying killing power of the 2000 Hornets, he suddenly felt a little reluctant to kill them so easily. If I could use these Hornets, it would be equivalent to having an extremely lethal Hornet Army out of thin air! Xia ruofei said in his heart. At this thought, Xia ruofei tried to control the Hornet with his mind. After many attempts, the four or five Hornets outside could be controlled. However, Xia ruofei had to use the power of space to control them. To put it bluntly, the Hornets were controlled by the power of space. Xia ruofei couldn’t give the Hornets instructions with his mind and they would follow them to the letter. “Forget it. I’ll keep them for now and look at them after the space is upgraded!” Xia ruofei said in his heart,”but before that, I have to make sure that these Hornets will not pose a new threat.” Xia ruofei thought for a while and thought of a way to get the best of both worlds. After making his decision, Xia ruofei did not stay in the medium for too long. He was not even in a hurry to plant the wild iron – Skin Dendi. He flashed into the new space and played with Blackie and the others for a while. After giving them some food, he left the space with a thought. It was a quiet night. The next morning, Xia ruofei left Taoyuan farm in his pickup truck. However, he didn’t go directly to San Shan city to find manager Feng of Hengfeng jewelry to trade for Jade materials. Instead, he turned the car onto the National Highway leading to Changping County ...
