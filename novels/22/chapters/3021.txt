3022 Massive amount of resources (Part 2)

Xia ruofei reached out without looking back and took a spiritual stone from the pile of spiritual stones. He then turned to Bai Qingqing and grinned.””I guess you want this spirit stone, right?”

Bai Qingqing was stunned. She stammered,””You ... You ... How did you know? So ... You’ve already discovered it?”

“What did you find?” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”are you saying that this spiritual stone is strange? Was there a need to deliberately discover this? The fluctuations are so obvious ...”

Bai Qingqing was dumbfounded. It then realized that Xia ruofei’s attainment in the laws of space was much higher than its own. If it could notice the abnormality, how could Xia ruofei not notice it?

Although this spirit stone was hidden in a small mountain of hundreds of thousands of spirit stones, it was not eye – catching at all.

However, under the powerful mental power, there was naturally no way to hide.

Bai Qingqing was like a deflated balloon, and she said dejectedly,””Then just pretend I didn’t say anything! I’m sorry ... I’ll have to disturb you ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you really don’t want to leave any souvenirs?” Whoever saw it had a share! Don’t say I’m stingy! Other than this spirit stone, you can pick any other item!”

“No,” Bai Qingqing shook her head and said,”I don’t need it ... I don’t need these things that you human cultivators have ...”

Xia ruofei laughed.”Xiao Bai, it’s not that I’m being stingy. There’s really nothing in the nested space that you can use, including this spiritual stone that you’re interested in. It’s useless to you!”

Bai Qingqing opened her eyes wide and asked,””How do you know? You haven’t even opened it yet ...”

“Just because it’s not open doesn’t mean it can’t be seen!” Xia ruofei looked at the spiritual stone in his hand and said,”if you don’t believe me, you can stay. I will break it later!”

Bai Qingqing did not leave. She laid on the ground and said lazily,””Alright! I’d like to see what’s so special about this spirit stone and see if the final result is as you said!”

Xia ruofei rolled his eyes and said with a smile,””Little white, do you want to make a bet? I dare to say that after this spirit stone is broken, not only will there be nothing that you can use inside, there won’t even be any cultivation resources that cultivators can use! If I’m wrong, then I lose!”

Bai Qingqing shook her head and said,””Only an idiot would bet with you! I’m not gaming...I’m not gaming...I’m just staying to watch the show. Whether you’re right or wrong, it has nothing to do with me!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.

Bai Qingqing was scared of him. Furthermore, Xia ruofei’s high attainment in the laws of space had made Bai Qingqing lose confidence in her judgment.

Xia ruofei casually threw the spiritual stone that both he and Bai Qingqing had noticed to the side. He was not worried that Bai Qingqing would take the opportunity to do something under his nose. Even if Bai Qingqing wanted to do something, it would not succeed.

Then, Xia ruofei started to sort out his gains from the nested space.

In addition to a large number of spirit stones, spirit crystals, and origin crystals, the other gains were also not small.

Most of the pills stored in the porcelain bottles had lost some of their medicinal properties, but they could still be used. There were also a small number of relatively precious medicinal pills. Because they were well – preserved, they basically did not lose any medicinal properties.

There were also some cultivation techniques, secret techniques, and ancient books. Xia ruofei took a quick glance and put them aside. These things might be precious to ordinary cultivators, but they were harmless without comparison. The cultivation techniques and ancient books stored in this nested space were still a few levels lower than the knowledge that Xia ruofei had obtained from the Jade talisman of inheritance.

However, this was just the general idea. Among the large pile of ancient books, there was a personal letter that made Xia ruofei’s eyes light up. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

It was a personal letter on refining knowledge summarized by master Yuntai.

Although master Yuntai was an ancient cultivator and there was a gap between him and the modern cultivation world, he was still relatively famous among the ancient cultivators. The main reason was that he had appeared in many ancient books, and his deeds were quite legendary.

For example, having a pair of twin female cultivators as Dao companions would make countless cultivators envious.

Therefore, in general, the modern cultivation world knew more about master Yuntai.

Scholar Yuntai was good at forging.

Some of the magical treasures excavated from the ruins of ancient cultivators used by the seniors in the current cultivation world were made by master Yuntai.

Although there weren’t many documents and information passed down from the ancient cultivation world, everyone still judged that the Grand cloud scholar was at least a very famous expert in the field of refining weapons.

Naturally, Xia ruofei was interested in the notes left behind by such a master.

After a simple reading, Xia ruofei found that this master Yuntai’s refining skills were indeed very high. Although the refining experience he recorded in this Handbook was not systematic, it made Xia ruofei’s eyes light up.

Compared to the ancient books on refining in the Jade talismans of inheritance, the personal notes of the scholar Yuntai were more creative.

In the refining industry, innovation was very important.
