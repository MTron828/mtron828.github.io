2663 A decision made in one word_2

Zhong Lin couldn’t help but reveal a bitter smile and said,””This is the current situation in the Army. Many of us graduated from military school, but we don’t have a suitable profession when we go to the local area. Unless we change our profession, or go to the Qingshui Yamen and wait for retirement ...”

Ma su, who was sitting beside Xia ruofei, couldn’t help but say,””Wasn’t there a post some time ago that said that the profession of a retired official wasn’t suitable? “The following posts are both funny and sad. There are all kinds of professions. There’s submarine, tank Cannoneer, land missile, air defense radar ... After these people changed their jobs, most of them became officials and Deputy Directors in various government agencies, enterprises, and institutions ...”

“Deputy instructor MA is right. We’re still young and don’t want to live a stable life.” Zhong Lin said,”that’s why instructor Wu and I have the same idea, which is to follow the discharge treatment. Originally, we wanted to go back and start our own business. Today, Captain Guo told us that there was such an opportunity on President Xia’s side, and we were immediately tempted!”

“President Xia, if you don’t mind us, we’ll work for you in the future!” Wu Jiasong said.

Hearing this, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but look at Guo Zhan.

In the case of Wu Jiasong and Zhong Lin, directly retiring according to the veteran’s treatment was a bit of a desperate move, leaving no way out for themselves.

Xia ruofei was a little hesitant. They were full of enthusiasm now, so they could say anything they wanted. However, if they were not happy at Paradise Island or felt that they could not stand being isolated from the world, they would have nothing left if they left Paradise Island and returned home.

Would they blame him then? Xia ruofei muttered in his heart.

“What are you looking at me for?” Guo Zhan asked with a smile. This is your business! You can decide for yourself whether you want them or not! I can only guarantee that the officers and soldiers I recommend to you are of high quality and are absolutely reliable. You can use them without worry. As for whether I want them or not, that has nothing to do with me. ”

Wu Jiasong was more mature and he could see the concern in Xia ruofei’s heart. He said,””President Xia, you don’t have to feel any pressure. If Captain Guo didn’t provide us with the information, Zhong Lin and I were also prepared to be discharged.”

He then smiled in embarrassment and said,””Actually, there will be more money after retirement than transferring to another job. Our original intention was to use this money to start a business. However, if we were to work for you, although we are already common people, we can still deal with weapons and equipment. Moreover, there are many familiar comrades around us, so we changed our minds!”

Zhong Lin also said frankly,”and ... President Xia is giving me good treatment.” After we heard it, we were even more tempted ...” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Xia ruofei could not help but smile at Zhong Lin’s words. He was an honest man.

“So, no matter how long we can work in the future, at least this is our own choice. We will not blame anyone.” Wu Jiasong said,”also, if you think that our ability and quality can’t meet the requirements of the job, you can fire us when it’s time. We will have no complaints. The local rules are like this. How can there be an iron job?” We all know about this. ”

Xia ruofei didn’t hesitate anymore. He nodded and said,””Since the two of you have already said this, what else is there to say? Welcome to the paradise Corporation!”

Wu Jiasong and Zhong Lin looked at each other in excitement. They clenched their fists and cheered in their hearts.

“Come, I’ll toast to the two of you.” Xia ruofei stood up and said,”I wish that we will go to the next level in our work!”

“I also wish that the Paradise company will continue to prosper!” Wu Jiasong smiled.

“You can talk!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”come, let’s drink this glass together!”

After Xia ruofei, Wu Jiasong, and Zhong Lin had finished their drinks, Guo Zhan said,””Ruofei, there’s something that I have to tell you. Although the four of them are basically going to retire, it’s a critical time for the Army to reform. Furthermore, we’re going to move our troops over a thousand miles soon, so it’s impossible for them to leave the Army in the near future.”

“Understood!” Xia ruofei said,”do you think I don’t know the rules of the Army? Moreover, retired officials would leave the Army at least in March every year, and it wasn’t even the end of the year yet! The other people I’ve recruited can go over first, so it won’t delay things. ”

“It won’t take that long ... It’s mainly because the troops have been busy moving and defending during this period of time. All the surplus cadres are still holding their posts, and they are no exception. When the troops have moved to the new base and everything has settled down, I’ll approve their leave and let them take a break first. Didn’t you say that we’ll do some training after we recruit them? They’re all veterans in the training field. They can go over and help you, and at the same time, they can receive some training. ”

As Guo Zhan said this, he took a sip of his drink and continued,”When their leave is over, I’ll extend their leave if the unit isn’t particularly busy. This way, it won’t delay your work. You’ll have to let them go through the procedures in March next year. “
