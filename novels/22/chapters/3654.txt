Tang Yitian grabbed the phone and said,”Who is it?”

The other end of the phone said a few words. Tang Yitian quietly listened for a while, then said,””Alright, 1 got it!”

After hanging up the phone, Tang Yitian looked at Xia ruofei and said,””I’ve received the news, Grello. Galini is already dead, and he died in a terrible way H

Tang Yitian looked at Xia ruofei with a strange expression and said,””It’s really scary to offend you cultivators …”

Obviously, he had found out about Grello over the phone. Even though he knew that Xia ruofei would not use such a method to deal with him, he still trembled in fear at the exact situation when he died.

Xia ruofei said easily,”he was indeed ruthless, but as you said, he did it to Grello.” A person like Galini can never be too ruthless.”

“Hahaha! That makes sense!” Tang Yitian smiled and said,”ruofei, no matter what, this is something to be happy about. You’ve helped Paradise Farm and Xiao Liang vent their anger. Let’s have a good drink tonight!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

The two of them chatted for a while in the study before leaving for the dining room. The chef had already prepared a sumptuous dinner as quickly as possible. Even though Xia ruofei was eating alone, the standard was still very high.

Tang Yitian also sat down to drink with Xia ruofei. The two drank and chatted, and the atmosphere was very harmonious.

Just as Xia ruofei and Tang Yitian were drinking and chatting happily, greello suddenly stopped. The news of Galini’s death began to spread in Australia.

The Galini brothers played an important role in Australia, especially in the iron ore industry. Galini was at the prime of his life, so his sudden death was naturally explosive news.

Therefore, many Australian TV stations began to broadcast this news. Some news stations even started a live broadcast on the dock.

However, the reporters waiting at the dock were destined to be empty because the medical helicopter did not turn back directly, even though they were still on the way. Kalini had already breathed his last, but no one dared to bear such a responsibility, so they still flew to the Galini.

After landing on the yacht, the helicopter began to refuel, and the random medical staff rushed to grenno. In Galini’s bedroom, he was examined again. In fact, it was a very simple thing to confirm his death. The doctors on the ship would never make a mistake, so they were just following the routine procedure.

Confirm Grello. After Galini’s death, the medical staff carried his strange body, which was curled up into a ball, onto the helicopter and flew directly to the hospital.

The reporters on the dock saw that when the Galiny docked, in fact, Grello’s face changed. Galini’s body had been transported to a private hospital in Sydney.

However, the media was everywhere. Some of the media did camp at the private hospital that had a lot of cooperation with the kalini family. Not only did they capture the image of the medical helicopter landing on the rooftop, but some of them also managed to sneak into the hospital and capture blurry images of the bodies being transported.

After these images were broadcasted on television, they naturally attracted a lot of attention.

The news spread very quickly on the internet, and soon, the people all over Australia basically knew about it.

Paradise Farm.

Liang Qichao was sitting on the bed reading a book. He was injured and could not move. In order to help him recover as soon as possible, Daphne had limited the time he could use his phone. As a result, he had developed a good habit of reading.

Liang Qichao was reading a famous person’s biography when Daphne suddenly pushed the door open and walked in quickly.

“What’s wrong, my dear?” Liang Qichao raised his head and asked.

There was a strange look on Daphne’s face, and she said in a hurry,””Hurry up! He turned on the television! Switch to the Sydney News channel!”

“What’s wrong? What happened?” Liang Qichao was confused.

Daphne ignored Liang Qichao. She walked over quickly, picked up the remote control, and turned on the TV. Then, she quickly adjusted the TV to the Sydney News channel.

“What’s going on?” Liang Qichao asked, puzzled. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Don’t say anything!” Daphne glared at Liang Qichao and said,”see for yourself!”

On the TV, a reporter was speaking very quickly. The background behind him should be a hospital. Liang Qichao had no problem communicating in English, but he could only get a rough idea of what she was saying because she was speaking so fast.

Liang Qichao vaguely heard the words “kalini”,”luck”,”corpse” and so on. He was about to ask Daphne to explain the situation to him when the scene on the TV suddenly changed.

A host said,”according to the news from our reporter in Melbourne Steve.” Mr. Galini is about to hold a press conference on Grello. Mr. Galini’s death explained to the outside world! Next, we’ll cut to the scene Melbourne!”

After all, the host was more professional than the reporter, and he was not affected by the atmosphere of the scene, so his speaking speed was basically normal. In addition, there were subtitles on the TV, so Liang Qichao understood what he was saying.

He was dumbfounded and said,”greello.” Galini? He’s dead? Did i hear you right, Daphne?”

“Don’t worry,” said Daphne.”You didn’t hear wrong. The news has been confirmed long ago.. It’s all over the internet!”
