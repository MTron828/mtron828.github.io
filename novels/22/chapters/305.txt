Chapter 306: I can’t believe_1

“Lil Chao, this is no joke!” Liang Weimin said sternly,”can you be sure of that?” “Let’s go back to our room and talk,”Liang Qichao said with a smile. There are too many people here ...” “Yes, yes, yes, let’s go back to the room!” Yuan Shan quickly said. Just now, when the family of three was quarreling, the other relatives were looking at them from afar! It would be bad if they heard him talking about the big news of the Phoebe zhennan. “Let’s go!”Liang Weimin nodded and said. Back to the room!” The family of three took the elevator to the floor where their rooms were. As soon as they entered the house, Liang Weimin asked impatiently,”Lil Chao, what’s going on? tell me clearly!” “Dad,” Liang Qichao chuckled,”I was planning to give you a surprise tomorrow, but I think you can’t hold it in anymore today. I’ll tell you in advance!” Yuan Shan laughed and said,”you child, what’s with the surprise?” Your dad’s hair is turning white from all the worrying ...” “Dad, actually, I’ve been asking my friends to help me look for the big and old materials of the Phoebe zhennan,” Liang Qichao didn’t beat around the bush and said,”a few days ago, my friend finally confirmed that the material has been found. The quality is much better than the one at Liang Xiaojun’s house!” “Really?” Liang Weimin was a little skeptical.”The material that Weihua’s family found is already very good. I went to take a look. That Phoebe zhennan has a diameter of one meter, and the proportion of the core is also very high. The core diameter is at least 90 centimeters! You can find a better one? Is it so easy to find the best material of golden Phoebe zhennan nowadays?” Liang Qichao said unhappily,”what do you mean by easy to find?” I spent a lot of effort, okay?” “Dad, mom,” Liang Qichao continued,”my friend found this old Phoebe zhennan material. It’s 1.25 meters in diameter, and the core is 1.1 meters in diameter. It’s of very good quality too. Don’t you think it’s better than the one at Liang Xiaojun’s house?” “What?” Liang Weimin was shocked. His first reaction wasn’t surprise, but a deep suspicion. He frowned and said,””Little Chao, is this friend of yours reliable?” “Dad, what are you saying!” Liang Qichao said unhappily. “No... It’s not impossible to find a 1.25 – meter – Diameter Phoebe zhennan material, but ...” Liang Weimin said,”are you sure your friend said that the core diameter was 1.1 meters? Did you hear it right? This was obviously impossible! How can the ratio of core material be so high?” “Just because you’ve never seen it before doesn’t mean it’s impossible!” Liang Qichao said unhappily,”my friend wouldn’t lie to me!” Liang Weimin expressed his deep suspicion, and even Yuan Shan said with uncertainty,”Little Chao, this friend of yours ... Don’t tell me you met him while you were out eating and drinking, right? Society is complicated now. You can’t just do whatever others say!” Liang Qichao said, amused and annoyed,””Mom, dad, what are you thinking? Do you look down on your son that much? So the friends I make are all scoundrels? Then tell me, what do I get from him lying to me? Didn’t they still have to see the goods in the end? Can we pay for the bad stuff?” “That’s right, old Liang, our son has a point!” Yuan Shan immediately changed her stance. “It’s not that simple!”Liang Weimin shook his head. What if Wei Hua had deliberately arranged this? It’s a good thing little Chao didn’t rush to tell uncle about this, otherwise if we can’t get the Phoebe zhennan material, then uncle’s impression of our family, especially little Chao, will definitely be extremely bad!” The more Liang Weimin thought about it, the more he felt that it made sense. “Little Chao! You can’t tell anyone about this!” Liang Weimin said,”I think it’s probably fake news!” Liang Qichao smiled bitterly and said,”dad, I really admire your imagination ... Let me put it this way!” It’s impossible for RUO Fei to be someone arranged by uncle Wei Hua, and it’s absolutely impossible for him to harm me!” Seeing Liang Weimin frown, Liang Qichao quickly said,””How about this! I’ll call RUO Fei right now and ask him to take a few photos of the big stone and send them over. Is that okay?” “This is a good idea!” Yuan Shan’s eyes lit up as she said. Liang Weimin’s expression also eased a little, and he said, “That’s fine. As long as this is true, we’ll definitely thank him!” Liang Qichao shook his head helplessly. He took out his phone and called Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei was surfing the internet in his room. When his phone rang, he saw that it was Liang Qichao calling and picked it up immediately. “Brother Liang!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “RUO Fei, I hope I didn’t disturb your rest!” Liang Qichao asked. “I didn’t sleep so early!” Xia ruofei smiled.”Brother Liang, you should be in Shen Cheng city now, right? It’s so late. What’s the matter?” Liang Qichao said, a little embarrassed,””Ruofei, can you please take a few photos of that golden Phoebe zhennan and send them to me? After all, it’s a serious matter, and my dad is a little worried ...” Xia ruofei replied,”no problem!” But ... The material isn’t with me. It’s so late now, I’ll go shoot it tomorrow morning, okay?” “No problem, no problem!” Liang Qichao quickly said,”I’ll have to trouble you then ...” “Hey, what’s the trouble!” Xia ruofei said,”brother Liang, when is your cousin – grandfather coming over? I’ll be able to prepare in advance. ” “He should be back at the three mountains tomorrow!” Liang Qichao said,”I’m going to tell the old man after he’s seen the material at my uncle’s house. After all, he was the one who found it first! I’m guessing it’ll be at least tomorrow noon or afternoon!” “Alright! Then I know what to do!” Xia ruofei said. Shen Cheng, Hengfeng Jiahua Hotel. After Liang Qichao hung up, Liang Weimin immediately asked,””How is it? Little Chao, what did your friend say?” “No problem!” Liang Qichao said casually,”he said he’ll go take photos tomorrow morning.” “Why is it tomorrow morning?” Liang Weimin asked, frowning. “Then why not?” Liang Qichao said,”it’s already so late. Are you going to let him make a trip in the middle of the night? It’s not like that piece of material is in his house!” “I see ...” Liang Weimin muttered,”that’s fine too!” Then, Liang Weimin said in a very serious tone,”Little Chao, before you confirm this information, you absolutely can not mention the Golden Phoebe material, understand?” “I know, I know ...” Liang Qichao said impatiently,”I’ll listen to you, okay?” Dad, mom, if there’s nothing else, I’ll go back to my room!” “Go!” Liang Weimin said, waving his hand. Liang Qichao’s news made Liang Weimin destined to have another sleepless night ... The next morning, the Liang family gathered around the old master for breakfast. Liang Weimin pulled Liang Qichao to the side and asked quietly,””Little Chao, did your friend send the photo over?” Grinning, Liang Qichao took out his phone and showed the photo to Liang Weimin ...
