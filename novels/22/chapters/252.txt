Chapter 253: Super nutrient solution_1

In the Qingjiang villa district. In front of a mansion by the river in an excellent location, Ling Xiaotian was standing in the courtyard, looking forward to it. Ling Qingxue walked out of the villa and saw her father’s expression. She was both angry and amused.””Dad! You’ve been waiting outside since 6 am. Ruofei lives in the suburbs Changping, how could he have arrived so quickly?” Ling Xiaotian chuckled,”isn’t this the son-in-law-to-be’s first visit?” I’m so excited!” Ling Qingxue looked at Ling Xiaotian with disdain and said,””Dad, I think you’re not waiting for RUO Fei. You’re waiting for that pair of blood red Dragons!” Ling Xiaotian, whose thoughts had been seen through by Ling Qingxue, was not embarrassed. He chuckled and said,””It’s the same, it’s the same. It’s a daughter and son-in-law’s filial piety! Of course, I have to pay attention to it!” Ling Qingxue’s face blushed slightly, and her heart was filled with happiness. After the father and daughter chatted for a while, the sharp – eyed Ling Qingxue was the first to notice the Knight XV’s carriage. It was extremely eye – catching, and it was hard not to be noticed. “Dad! RUO Fei is here!” Ling Qingxue’s words were filled with joy. “Where is it? Where is it?” Ling Xiaotian hurriedly asked. Ling Qingxue pointed at Knight XV in the distance and said,””It’s that black SUV. ” After Ling Xiaotian clearly saw Knight XV’s domineering appearance, he couldn’t help but be stunned. He said,””Woof! Little Xia’s car is not bad!” “It’s more than “not bad”!” Ling Qingxue said proudly,”this is a limited edition Knight XV. There are only a few of them in the country!” Ling Xiaotian nodded and said,”yes, I’ve heard of this car. It’s worth more than ten million!” Little Xia’s financial strength is much stronger than I thought! You are worthy of my daughter!” “Dad!” Ling Qingxue said seriously. Even if RUO Fei is penniless, I will still like him! In my opinion, feelings and money are not linked!” Ling Xiaotian was stunned for a moment before he chuckled and said,””It’s daddy who’s too tacky!” Ling Xiaotian then sighed,”I’ve been doing business for so many years, and I’ve unknowingly been stained with the stench of money!” Qingxue, you and RUO Fei have taught me a lesson these past two days!” “Hehe!” Ling Qingxue stuck out her tongue mischievously and reached out to hold her father’s arm. While the father and daughter were talking, Xia ruofei had already arrived at the villa. “Uncle Ling! Qingxue!” Xia ruofei jumped out of the car and greeted the two. Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei, who was wearing a Bourney suit. Her beautiful eyes couldn’t help but flash with a strange light. Xia ruofei, who had absorbed at least dozens of petals of the exotic flower, had a natural affinity. Now that he was wearing a formal suit, his handsome appearance and tall figure made him look even more handsome. “Little Xia is here! Welcome, welcome!” Ling Xiaotian laughed as he spoke. However, his eyes were eagerly looking into the car, and he did not notice that Xia ruofei had specially tidied up his appearance for today’s visit. Xia ruofei knew what was going on. He blinked at Ling Qingxue and quickly walked to the back of the car. Xia ruofei opened the back door of the car and took out a large box from the spirit map space that he had found on the road. He placed the two blood red Dragons in the box. “Uncle Ling, this is the Blood Red Dragon that Qingxue and I are giving you ...” Xia ruofei said. “I’ll take it, I’ll take it ...” Ling Xiaotian said hurriedly. Then, he carefully took the tidying box. His eyes fell on the two blood – Red Dragons inside. He suddenly gasped and was stunned. He couldn’t move his legs at all. Ling Xiaotian’s eyes were fixed on the two blood – Red Dragons in the box. He muttered to himself,””Top – grade ... It’s definitely top – grade ... His hair color is perfect! This figure, this curvace...It’s too beautiful ... It’s simply unbelievable ...” Ling Qingxue laughed and said,”dad, let’s take it back to the house!” This pair of Blood Dragons is yours from now on, you can look at them as long as you want ...” Ling Xiaotian quickly said,”Qingxue, lower your voice!” Don’t disturb the pair of treasures ...” Ling Qingxue and Xia ruofei looked at each other and smiled bitterly. However, Ling Qingxue’s warning was still effective. Ling Xiaotian chuckled as he carried his luggage and walked into the villa. A large fish tank had already been prepared in the living room, right next to the huge television background wall. Ling Xiaotian carefully checked the temperature of the water, the pH level, and so on. Then, he carefully transferred the two red Arowana into the fish tank. Ling Xiaotian’s eyes were fixed on the two blood – Red Dragons in the fish tank, and his love for them was beyond words. “Xiao Xia, why do I feel that these two Blood Dragons seem to be a little dispirited?” Ling Xiaotian looked at it for a while, then said hesitantly,”it was still fine in your plastic box just now!” Xia ruofei went forward to take a look and saw the two Blood Dragons in the fish tank looking a little lazy. Xia ruofei thought for a moment and understood that these two fish were used to the spatial pool water. Occasionally, there would be petal solution, and they were not used to normal water. “Uncle Ling, I almost forgot ... Please wait for me!” Xia ruofei said. After saying that, he quickly walked out of the villa and returned to the car. He summoned the spirit map scroll from his palm and quickly contacted the space with his mind. He took out a bottle of the petal solution with the lowest concentration and immediately put the spirit map scroll away. Xia ruofei walked into the villa with the porcelain bottle and said with a smile,””Uncle Ling, these two fish are used to the nutrient solution that my friend and I concocted together, so they’re a little unaccustomed to the environment,” “Nutrient solution?” Ling Xiaotian was puzzled.”Do we need nutrient fluids to raise Red Arowana?” “You’ll know when you see it!” Xia ruofei smiled. With that, Xia ruofei opened the bottle and dripped a few drops of the flower petal solution into the fish tank. The two red Arowanas were invigorated and started swimming in the fish tank, wagging their tails. When Ling Xiaotian saw the immediate effect, he couldn’t help but widen his eyes. Xia ruofei wanted to laugh. The reason was simple. The two Blood Dragons were swimming in the fish tank to absorb the composition of the petals scattered in the water. “The effect is too obvious!” Ling Xiaotian took a deep breath and said,”little Xia, what kind of nutrient solution is this? There wouldn’t be any stimulants in it, would there? It’s very precious to the Blood Red Dragon. You can’t feed it to those random things!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”uncle Ling, don’t worry!” It’s absolutely natural and uncontaminated!” After he finished speaking, he passed the porcelain bottle to Ling Xiaotian and said,””Please keep this. Just drip a few drops every two days. This bottle can be used for a long time.” Ling Xiaotian hurriedly put it away as if he had obtained a treasure. Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”uncle Ling, you can ask me for more when you’re done. However, this kind of nutrient solution is quite difficult to make. You must take good care of it. Also ... It’s best to use it sparingly ...” Xia ruofei was a little embarrassed when he said the last part. However, even though the petal solution was of the lowest purity, it was still very precious. If he did not say a few words, it would be a waste if Ling Xiaotian wasted it. “Good, good, good! Don’t worry, Xia, I’ll lock it in the safe! I definitely won’t let anyone else touch it!” Ling Xiaotian hurriedly said.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m
