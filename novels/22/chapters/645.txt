Chapter 646: Chapter 463 – in full swing (2)

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”okay, I’ll go back and think about it.” Do the rest of the preparation work first, then add in the preparation process. “

Applying for patents was like a double – edged sword.

On the one hand, it could protect the rights of the patent owner, but on the other hand, it increased the risk of disclosing secrets.

Xue Jinshan thought for a while and asked,”President Xia, are you only applying for a domestic patent?” I think ... Since we don’t know anything about any medicine for autism, we should try to get all the patents we can, especially from the mainstream countries in Europe and America. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”no need.” Going overseas to apply for a patent is the same as giving the prescription to those big shots in the manufacturing industry. In a few years, their imitation medicine will be out. ”

Xue Jinshan couldn’t help but chuckle when he heard this.

As an industry insider, he naturally knew that some large pharmaceutical companies in Europe and the United States were actually a group of predators who ate people without spitting out their bones. The special drug for autism was like an alluring cake. Once they applied for a patent in another country, they could quickly obtain the patent application document through various shady means and immediately organize a team to replicate it.

As for the copyright infringement lawsuit, these rich and powerful pharmaceutical companies were not afraid at all.

They had a budget of hundreds of millions of dollars every year, which was used to fight all kinds of wrangling lawsuits. They had the world’s best team of lawyers, and they could even counter – Sue paradise pharmaceuticals for infringement of copyright. Then, they could drag the lawsuit for eight to ten years, using the legal costs to drag down their competitors.

Hence, Xia ruofei had no intention of applying for a patent overseas.

Although it was difficult to avoid the possibility of disclosing the patent in China, it would at least greatly increase the difficulty of plagiarism for pharmaceutical companies.

Moreover, as long as the core secret of the preparation process was not leaked, it would not be easy for those pharmaceutical companies to completely crack the formula.

Xia ruofei didn’t want to make huge profits from the heart – nourishing soup, but that didn’t mean that he was willing to let his own things be stolen by others, especially by foreign companies, and then become a tool for them to make huge profits.

......

“I understand, President Xia.” Xue Jinshan nodded and said,”then we’ll apply for the domestic patent!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes. Make all the preparations as soon as possible. Also, the prescription must be kept absolutely confidential. I’ll give you a new computer specially for you to write all kinds of application materials and application reports. All the work related to the prescription will be completed on this computer. Also, this computer is strictly prohibited from connecting to the internet!”

Xia ruofei had already decided that the computers in the Research Center of the pharmaceutical company would follow the military’s security measures and be directly isolated from the internet. The network card module and USB port would be removed, leaving only a CD drive. All the files would be transferred by burning the CD to ensure the safety of the prescription to the greatest extent.

“Understood!” Xue Jinshan replied solemnly.

Xia ruofei said,”you go first!” You’ll be working on the farm before the pharmaceutical company is listed. I’ll ask director pang to prepare an office for you and get you a new computer. ”

Xue Jinshan immediately and carefully put the prescription paper into his pocket, then stood up and left.

Xia ruofei raised his hand and looked at the time. It was almost time to get off work. He tidied up his desk and went to the staff cafeteria downstairs to have dinner before strolling back to the small villa.

At night, Xia ruofei transformed into a hardworking farmer uncle and worked tirelessly in the spirit map space to harvest the iron – Skin Dendrobium.

Qian Lijun had already replied to him that master Luo would take the train back to Sanshan with the employees of Taoyuan company who were studying at the Dendrobium fungi base the next morning. They would arrive around noon. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Hence, Xia ruofei had to harvest all the iron – Skin Dendrobium tonight.

Fortunately, after being tempered by the body tempering soup and the metal man body refining technique, Xia ruofei’s physical strength was many times stronger than that of ordinary people. In addition, time was 30 times faster than normal, so he had plenty of time.

Xia ruofei kept busy in the medium. When he was tired, he would sit down and drink some spiritual water. After more than ten hours, he finally harvested all the fresh strips.

Despite his amazing physical strength, being so busy without rest and sleep made him feel like he was about to collapse.

Xia ruofei drank a few mouthfuls of the spirit Heart Flower petal solution and recovered some of his strength. He then gathered the fresh strips together and weighed them in batches with the small scale in the space. There were about 2400 pounds.

Xia ruofei looked at the bags filled with the Ironhide vessel strips and could not help but smile bitterly. If he were to calculate the time, he would have been busy for days and nights!

If he had to suffer like this in the future, he really wouldn’t be able to take it.

At this moment, Xia ruofei thought of the soul puppet. He did not know if the soul puppet could help him complete this kind of repetitive and mechanical labor.

If the spiritual puppet in the medium could help him harvest the Ironhide Dendrobium strips or even pick tea leaves, it would be much easier for him.

During this period of time, Xia ruofei would enter the medium to process the parts of the array disc when he had the time. However, there were too many parts and every part was required to be very detailed. Hence, Xia ruofei’s progress was still a little slow. It would probably take some time before he could finish.

After resting for a while, Xia ruofei left the spirit map space with a thought.

Only two or three hours had passed in the outside world.
