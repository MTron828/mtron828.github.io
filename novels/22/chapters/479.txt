Chapter 480: Chapter 394 – returning gifts (1)

Liang Haiming flipped through a few pages and then slammed the stack of documents on the coffee table. With a dark expression, he gritted his teeth and said,””I want him dead!”

“Mister Liang, there’s a lot of fighting going on in Sanshan city right now. If this gets out of hand ...” The middle – aged man quickly said.

Liang Haiming raised his head abruptly and stared into the middle – aged man’s eyes. He asked,””You’re teaching me how to do things?”

The middle – aged man’s body trembled, and his face couldn’t help but turn pale. He said in a trembling voice,”I wouldn’t dare, I wouldn’t dare ... Young master Liang, what I meant was ... A batch of goods will be arriving in two days. I’m just worried that if there’s a murder, it will affect our deal ...”

Liang Haiming’s expression softened, and he gradually calmed down from his rage.

He had been in San Shan city for more than ten days for this batch of car parts from Germany. If the deal went well, he would earn at least 20 million in net profit.

After the high tariffs were removed, the profits brought by car smuggling were beyond the imagination of ordinary people.

Liang Haiming naturally wouldn’t go against money and create trouble at this time.

He pondered for a long time with a gloomy face and said,””Alright, I’ll let him jump around for a few more days! But ... You have to send someone to keep a close eye on me! And ...”

Liang Haiming picked up the stack of documents and flipped to one of the pages.

It was a photo of Ling Qingxue. In the photo, Ling Qingxue was wearing a black professional suit and walking out of the Ling Ji F & B headquarters with a smile on her face. From the angle, it was probably taken secretly.

Liang Haiming’s eyes were filled with lust as he pointed at Ling Qingxue in the photo and said,””Keep an eye on this woman and figure out her movement patterns. Before that kid dies, I’d like to invite him to enjoy a good show ...”

Liang Haiming’s face showed a crazy and perverted look. The middle – aged man lowered his head in fear and said,””Yes! Young master Liang!”

“Go! Pay more attention to the deal, don’t make any mistakes!” Liang Haiming said indifferently.

The middle – aged man bowed and took his leave.

After the middle – aged man left, Liang Haiming turned his attention to Ling Qingxue’s photo.

Ling Qingxue’s near – perfect body proportions, her beautiful face, and her two long, bouncy legs made Liang Haiming feel like a fire was burning in his lower abdomen. At the same time, his heart was burning with jealousy.

Motherf * cker! This kid was really lucky! Liang Haiming gritted his teeth and thought.

He was a lecherous man to begin with, and Ling Qingxue was his enemy’s girlfriend. So, he had already made up his mind. After the cargo ship successfully docked and the goods were cleared, he would stay in San Shan to deal with Xia ruofei. The first thing he would do was to capture Xia ruofei’s long – legged girlfriend and enjoy her.

When she was tired of playing with her, she would throw her to her fierce underlings and let them take turns to F * ck her, and then film it.

What happened next was simple. He just had to send out his most powerful men to catch Xia ruofei and break all his bones. He would also have to show him the exciting video before he died. He would definitely go crazy ...

This is the consequence of going against me, Liang Haiming!

Liang Haiming shuddered at the thought of the bloody and perverted scene.

He couldn’t help but grab his phone and quickly found the phone number of a young model and internet celebrity in Sanshan city.

“I’ll give you half an hour. Come to my room!”

Liang Haiming’s voice was filled with undisguised desire. Just by looking at Ling Qingxue’s picture and imagining the scene of his enemy’s woman moaning in pain under him, Liang Haiming’s desire was already burning.

At this moment, he urgently needed to vent.

……

Xia ruofei did not know that someone hated him to the core.

In reality, Xia ruofei had been passively responding to the entire incident. He had accused him of crippling Fang Luo because of Lu You’s request for help. As for Zhao he, he had wanted to harm him, which had provoked his thunderous counterattack. Even the operation to eliminate the underworld and evil that had caused Liang Haiming’s setup in the underground world of Sanshan city to suffer heavy losses was entirely because Lu You had almost been injured. It had been personally initiated by Tian Huilan and had nothing to do with Xia ruofei.

However, some people in the world were like this. They would never see their own mistakes, and all the problems were others ‘.

Besides, in the eyes of people like Liang Haiming, people like Xia ruofei, who had no background, were no different from ants. Getting someone to cripple him was already giving him face. He should be at his mercy. What? You actually dare to resist? Then I’ll crush you to death!

Unfortunately, Xia ruofei was not an ant. On the contrary, he was a peerless beast. When no one provoked him, he seemed harmless. However, once he was offended, he would immediately bare his terrifying fangs. This also meant that ... Someone was going to be in big trouble.

When Lu You arrived at Taoyuan farm, Xia ruofei had also just returned not long ago. After she parted ways with Xia ruofei at the Jade Market, she went straight back to Sanshan University, took the sheep – Fat white jade, and headed to the farm without stopping. There was less than an hour’s difference between the two.

Lei Hu already knew about Lu You’s BMW MINI, so he let her in without any obstruction. However, he still called Xia ruofei to report after Lu You entered.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates
