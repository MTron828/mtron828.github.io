Chapter 3372: Rewards obtained (2)

Translator: 549690339

Ling Qingxue did not know what was going on. She raised her head and looked at Xia ruofei in confusion.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I didn’t expect to have such a surprise!” Forget it, one herd of sheep is a rush, two herds of sheep are also a rush. You’ll be implicated and absorbed together!”

With that, Xia ruofei waved his hand. On top of the last stone pillar, there was a neatly arranged pile of Topaz essence. There were at least 500 of them. With the help of Xia ruofei’s spiritual power, they flew over steadily and landed beside Ling Qingxue.

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but widen her eyes and ask,””What’s going on? Didn’t you say that the mission reward was 500 Topaz essence? Why is there so much more?”

Xia ruofei laughed,”! don’t know!” But I’m guessing that this is your quest reward!”

“Me? 1 collected a yellow jade essence on the fourth floor of the trial Pagoda!” Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but blush.

This was quite embarrassing!

Xia ruofei had collected more than 2000 of them, while Ling Qingxue had only collected one. It was not even a fraction of Xia ruofei’s …

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Qingxue, don’t forget that we’re forming a team to complete the mission!” The number of missions is also doubled. Since we have completed the mission together, you should naturally have a reward! Speaking of which, you didn’t even get a reward for breaking the record, so it’s a bit unfair!”

Ling Qingxue blushed and said,”stop it!” I’ve only found one yellow jade essence, and you want the reward for breaking the record?”

Xia ruofei said,”it’s probably based on contribution. The reward for breaking the record can only be given to one person.” However, this expert who designed the mission is quite generous. At least he gave you the regular mission reward. It’s better than nothing!”

Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei’s expression as if he was barely able to accept it. She couldn’t help but burst into laughter and said,””You! You just know how to speak without thinking! If the higher being who set up the Tower of Trials saw this, he would definitely punish you!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’m telling the truth!” It was clearly two people who completed the mission together, so why didn’t they give you a record – breaking reward? However, the rules were not up to him, so he could only accept it reluctantly! “Fortunately, it’s not like we didn’t get anything. Qingxue, hurry up and absorb all the Topaz essence!” I’ll set up a time formation around you, it can save some time.”

“Mm! I got it!” Ling Qingxue nodded.

Although she felt that a thousand pieces of Topaz essence was too much, she knew that even if she wanted to give it to Xia ruofei, he would never agree. So, she decided not to say anything and just listened to Xia ruofei’s arrangements.

Ling Qingxue grabbed a piece of yellow jade essence and started to use her spiritual power to absorb the pure spiritual energy inside.

Xia ruofei took out array flags from the spirit map space and skillfully set up a time array around Ling Qingxue.

Then, he took out the energy storage Pearl and walked towards the first stone pillar.

Xia ruofei took a deep breath and placed the energy storage Pearl into the groove at the top of the stone pillar.

With a “ka da” sound, the energy storage Pearl was stuck in the groove. Then, the entire stone pillar began to sink slowly. Finally, it sank into the ground and completely disappeared, as if it had never existed.

Xia ruofei said to himself,”this thing can’t swallow cards, right?” If you don’t give me the demerit elemental storage Pearl, who should 1 go to?”

As Xia ruofei spoke, he used his foot to rub against the ground where the stone pillar had disappeared.

The ground here was no different from the surroundings. There was not a single crack or trace. Even when Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to investigate, he did not find anything unusual. It was as if it was one with the entire wilderness.

In a space filled with purple spirit Qi, there was a towering Hall. An old man with white hair and a white beard in a green Daoist robe had a huge mirror in front of him.

If Xia ruofei was here, he would be shocked.

That was because the mirror was like a monitor. On it was the fifth level of the Tower of Trials, and the image of Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue in the small space. Xia ruofei was in the middle of the image.

The green – robed old man’s face was full of wrinkles, and his seemingly turbid eyes revealed a trace of wisdom. He didn’t have any aura of cultivation, but he gave people a feeling of being as majestic as a mountain, making people feel a strong sense of respect and even have the urge to kneel on the ground.

When the old man heard Xia ruofei’s conversation with Ling Qingxue, saw him mumbling to himself after putting the energy storage Pearl in, and saw his childish action of rubbing his feet on the ground, he couldn’t help but feel angry and amused. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“This little guy is really frivolous!” The green – robed elder scolded jokingly.

Following that, the old man’s face revealed a trace of worry as he muttered to himself,””He broke all the records and passed all four stages. His array Dao is also good, but his cultivation is too low. Is he the person we are looking for? This little guy’s conditions are not bad. In time, he will become a great person, but what we lack the most now is time! Does he still have a chance to grow?”

After saying this, the green – robed elder looked at Xia ruofei in the mirror and

sighed,””The greatest sorrow of a genius is being born at the wrong time. 1 hope this kid can break through the shackles of fate …”

With that, the elder in the green Daoist robe waved his hand, and the image on the mirror disappeared.

Naturally, Xia ruofei didn’t realize that with Tao Wu’s current cultivation level, he couldn’t possibly sense the spying of an Almighty who was many levels higher than him.

He was bored to death as he strolled around the area. Ling Qingxue was absorbing the yellow jade essence in the formation. Although there was a time difference of nearly 90 times, it was not easy to absorb 1000 pieces of yellow jade essence, so it would still take some time.

The energy storage Pearl was also swallowed by the stone pillar. He did not know how long it would take for him to level up. Now, Xia ruofei had nothing to do other than to keep an eye on his surroundings.

After about half an hour, which was about two days in the array, Ling Qingxue had finally finished absorbing the yellow jade essence.

She impatiently stepped out of the array and said happily,””Ruofei, 1 think I’ve made another breakthrough in my spiritual power. I’ve reached the intermediate stage of the spirit gathering realm!”

Xia ruofei was stunned at first, then he immediately looked surprised and said,””Spirit gathering intermediate stage? It was equivalent to the psyche of an intermediate gold core cultivator! Not bad, Qingxue! You can definitely sweep away those in the refinement stage now! I’ll teach you a few more ways to use your mental power. Even if you’re facing an early Aurous core stage cultivator, you might be able to make them suffer a big loss if they’re caught off guard!”

Ling Qingxue was a little embarrassed as she asked,””Is he really that powerful?”

Xia ruofei said,”why Would I Lie to You?” My spiritual power cultivation is only at the late – Stage of spirit gathering realm! There was still a long way to go before he could reach the spirit transformation realm! You’ve already reached the intermediate stage of the spirit gathering stage, which means that you’re only one stage away from me! Looks like I’ll have to work hard when I get back. Otherwise, if my wife’s spiritual power cultivation is going to surpass mine, where will I put my face?”

Ling Qingxue saw Xia ruofei’s pretense and couldn’t help but burst out laughing.””Alright! Stop pretending! Who didn’t know that it was more difficult to improve one’s cultivation as one advanced? 1 don’t even know when 1’11 be able to break through to the late stage of spirit gathering realm! Moreover, you’re only at the late – Stage of the spirit gathering realm, so you shouldn’t be far from the spirit transformation realm! You only know how to trick me…”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”! may have exaggerated a little, but I’m not wrong about one thing. Your spiritual power has already reached the middle stage of the spirit gathering realm. It’s very impressive. 1 can’t say if there are any successors, but I’m pretty sure that there has never been anyone like you before!”

Then, Xia ruofei said seriously,””Qingxue, spiritual power is very important. Now that you have such a good foundation, you must practice hard to be worthy of such a good opportunity!”

Ling Qingxue said solemnly,”! will!” Don’t worry! From now on, I’ll take out at least two hours every day to train, I won’t let your efforts go to waste!”
