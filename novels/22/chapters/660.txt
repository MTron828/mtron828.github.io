Chapter 661: Spirit map world’s tea house (1)

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”what is it?” Can’t you just make the decision for the general matters?”

Feng Rao glared at Xia ruofei and said,””Are you addicted to being a hands – off shopkeeper?”

Xia ruofei smiled awkwardly and said,””Isn’t that because I have full trust in your ability? How many bosses do you think are like me in this world, letting my subordinates do whatever they want?”

“So I should be grateful, right?” Feng Jing asked with a half – Smile,”do I have to set up your memorial tablet at home and pray to you every morning and night?” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei suddenly felt a chill in his heart. He laughed and said,””It’s too much, too much ... There’s no need for this! Our company doesn’t advocate personal worship ...”

“You’re still talking ...” Feng Jing pouted and glared at Xia ruofei. She stomped her foot and said.

Xia ruofei wanted to slap himself. Wasn’t he rubbing it in? Just now, in the pomfrets breeding workshop, everyone seemed to understand what he had said, making him and Feng Jing very embarrassed.

Xia ruofei quickly changed the topic,”let’s not talk about this ... CEO Feng, didn’t you say that you had something to report?” Speak!”

Feng Jing glanced at Xia ruofei and couldn’t help but burst out laughing when she saw Xia ruofei’s serious expression.

When it came to serious matters, Feng Rao put away her girly attitude.

She said,”Chairman, the pharmaceutical company is just an empty shell now. The main energy is focused on the approval of new drugs. There are only a few people like Xue Jinshan. It’s fine for them to work on the farm for the time being, but I think we should think about it in the long run. Some things need to be prepared early.”

“Oh? What do you think we should prepare in advance?” Xia ruofei asked seriously.

“First of all, the ultimate goal of setting up a pharmaceutical company is to produce heart – nourishing soup,” Feng Jing said as she walked.”In the future, it’s possible to produce jaded skin ointment, so we’ll have to have our own pharmaceutical company sooner or later.”

......

“That’s for sure. ” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“I think there are only two ways. One is to get the government to approve a piece of land and start from scratch.” Feng Jing said,”the other condition is to acquire a ready – made pharmaceutical factory and transform it on the basis of that.

“That’s right. ” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”Mr. Feng, I’m more inclined to the second method. It will save us a lot of trouble and reduce our initial investment.”

Feng Rao nodded.”Yes, I’ve been collecting relevant information recently. I’ve been focusing on the pharmaceutical factories in the southeast province, especially those within the San Shan City area, especially those small factories that haven’t been doing well. I’ve been analyzing the possibility of acquiring them!”

Xia ruofei nodded approvingly.””What did I say? I’m at ease with you handling things! You always put work ahead of you, what do I have to worry about?”

“So, you agree?” Feng Rao blushed.

“I agree, I agree! That’s the correct way of thinking. ” Xia ruofei said without hesitation.

Feng Rao smiled and continued,””Chairman, no matter if it’s an acquisition or a new one, our company’s business must be getting bigger and bigger. I think the relocation of the company’s headquarters should also be put on the agenda.”

“Yes.” Xia ruofei nodded but didn’t say anything. He signaled for Feng Rao to continue.

“First of all, the pharmaceutical factory will definitely have more than just a few employees in the future. Also, the pharmaceutical company’s administrative team, the Research Institute, and the head office’s administrative team can’t all be concentrated on the farm, right? Moreover, the farm’s land is limited, so we can’t keep building staff dormitories, right?” Feng ke said.

“Yes, continue.” Xia ruofei nodded.

“Also, this place is indeed a little remote. Although the environment is good, the transportation is not convenient.” Feng Jing said,”besides, our company is destined to become bigger and stronger in the future. The company’s headquarters represents the company’s image. I’ve never heard of an international company’s headquarters being located in a small farm in a mountain village.”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”that makes sense!” This area is still at the junction of several villages, and the land area is limited. The continued development will be affected. ”

“There are many other benefits to moving the company’s headquarters to the city.” Feng Jing said,”first of all, it’ll undoubtedly be more attractive to young people. Secondly, there’s no need for us to continue building staff dormitories. We just need to provide rental subsidies. Also, with the expansion of the company’s business, it’ll be good for unified management in the city center and improve administrative efficiency.”

Xia ruofei agreed,”yeah!” It’s only a temporary measure now. Pang Hao has been complaining to me every day, and just running to the bank is tiring enough. ”

“Logistics, especially finance, is indeed a lot of inconvenience at the moment.” Feng Rao pursed her lips and smiled.

Xia ruofei pondered for a moment and said,”CEO Feng, I’ll listen to your opinion.” The farm will continue to expand to the seaside in the future, and even develop seafood breeding. The scale will definitely continue to expand, so after the company’s headquarters is moved to the city, the current office building, staff dormitory, and so on can be put to good use. ”

“The only problem now, Chairman,” Feng Jing nodded.”Is the company’s funds enough to support the construction of the headquarters in the city center?”
