Chapter 919: Returning to his old home (2)

Translator: 549690339

In fact, from yesterday to today, Xia ruofei had already used his spiritual power three times to enter little Haoran’s meridians. Hence, little Haoran had unconsciously developed a sense of closeness to Xia ruofei.

This was because mental energy was actually a type of wave. Everyone’s mental energy had a unique wave and frequency. Xia ruofei’s mental energy had been circulating through little Haoran’s meridians many times, so he naturally felt a sense of familiarity with this wave and frequency.

Although he was young, he knew that Xia ruofei was helping him, so he was especially close to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei also liked little Haoran very much. He gently pinched little Haoran’s face and smiled,””Then after a while, big brother will help you heal again and completely destroy those flaming monsters, okay?”

“Good, good!” Little Haoran cheered and jumped for joy,”brother, you must help me destroy them. These monsters are so bad. They chase me in my dreams every day and want to burn me to death with fire ...”

Xia ruofei’s heart trembled. This child was only six or seven years old. He must have suffered a lot ...

He squatted down and gently put his arm around little Haoran’s shoulder, saying,””Don’t worry! With big brother here, those flaming monsters will never appear again!”

“En!” Little Haoran nodded heavily.

Tang Yitian’s eyes were a little red, and Jennifer, who was more emotional, had long burst into tears. In her tears, there was the joy of her son’s escape from death, and also the heartache for his suffering all these years.

Lin Qiao’s eyes were also a little wet. The scene in front of Yingying was too touching.

Xia ruofei’s treatment of little Haoran lasted for about an hour. After they had chatted for a while, they heard a “ding” sound and the seat belt indicator light in the cabin lit up.

There was still a while before the plane began to descend, and the purser also informed everyone to return to their seats and fasten their seat belts.

Everyone returned to their seats. Xia ruofei asked the flight attendant to restore his and Lin Qiao’s seats. Then, he sat back in his seat and buckled his seatbelt as required.

The display in the first – Class cabin showed the real – time location of the plane.

Xia ruofei saw that the plane was already very close to Sydney. At this time, the plane’s altitude and speed were both slowly decreasing.

After more than 20 minutes, the jumbo jet passed through the clouds. As it descended, the view of Sydney could be seen from the porthole.

From Xia ruofei’s side of the porthole, they could see Sydney’s Harbor Bridge. The plane had a turn above the harbor Bridge so that passengers could enjoy the beautiful scenery.

In the distant port, white sails were scattered on the blue sea, like pearls inlaid in a blue curtain.

The weather in Sydney was very good today. The sky was clear, and even further away, the Sydney Opera House, the Sydney Tower, and other landmark buildings could be seen.

It was Lin Qiao’s first time in Australia, so she was very excited and couldn’t help looking out of the porthole.

Xia ruofei smiled and introduced her to some of the landmark buildings that the plane had passed by.

After another ten minutes, the plane finally landed smoothly on the runway of Sydney’s Kingford Smith Airport and began to taxied at high speed.

Under the effect of the automatic braking and the reverse engine injection, the plane’s taxiing speed rapidly decreased and it quickly left the side of the runway.

A few minutes later, the plane taxied smoothly to the parking lot, and the covered bridge slowly came closer.

The cabin door opened. Under the enthusiastic smiles of the flight attendants, Xia ruofei and the others carried their luggage and walked out of the cabin.

Lin Qiao took a deep breath and said naughtily,”Brother ruofei, is this the air of Australia? I don’t think it’s any sweeter than in China!”

“Do you want to see if the moon in Australia is rounder than the moon in China tonight?” Xia ruofei teased.

Lin Qiao burst into laughter.

Soon, everyone passed through the covered bridge and walked into the terminal. They came to the luggage transfer area. Xia ruofei smiled at Tang Yitian and said,””Then let’s part here, Mr. Tang! Keep in touch later, I’ll let you know in advance before I return!”

“Mr. Xia, are you really not going to visit me first?” Tang Yitian asked with a trace of regret.

Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s okay. My friend came from Hunter Valley to pick me up. It’s not good to stand him up.” We should be staying in Australia for a while. Besides, I still have to treat little Haoran! You’ll have plenty of opportunities to be the host if you want to. ”

Tang Yitian shrugged and said,”okay!” Then I’ll wait for your call!”

Jennifer also said to Lin Qiao with a smile,””Lin, I look forward to the day we meet again. I’ll prepare an autographed CD of Jennifer’s echoes for you!”

“Yeah!” Lin Qiao happily nodded. Thank you, Jennifer!”

Both parties waved goodbye at the luggage wheel. Little Haoran even turned back to look at Xia ruofei with every step he took. He seemed to be a little reluctant to part with Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei had come into contact with a few children, including Ma Zhiming and Tian Huixin’s daughter, Huan Huan, Tian Huixin’s friend, Xue Biyun’s child, Chengcheng, and this time’s little Haoran. All of these children were very close to Xia ruofei.

This was mainly due to the natural affinity Xia ruofei had after absorbing the petals of the spirit Heart Flower and drinking the soup of the spiritual gestment.

Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao waited for a while at the luggage wheel before they got Lin Qiao’s extra – large suitcase.

As it was winter in Australia, although there was central air conditioning in the airport and the temperature was maintained at about 24 to 25 degrees, it was still a little cold outside.

Before they came, Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao had also checked the weather forecast for Sydney and Hunter Valley. The lowest temperature in winter in Australia was about five degrees, and the highest temperature during the day could reach 18 or even 20 degrees.

Hence, Xia ruofei asked Lin Qiao to bring some warm clothes.

After getting the luggage, Lin Qiao took out a cashmere sweater and put it on. Xia ruofei was still wearing a T – Shirt and jeans. The temperature was not cold at all to Xia ruofei.

Before they left, Xia ruofei had reminded Lin Qiao of some things to take note of, including the things to pay attention to when passing the customs and the prohibition of bringing items into the country.

During the descent of the plane, everyone had already filled in the entry card, so after the two of them went through the procedures at the customs counter, they took the entry card and walked directly to the green marked passage.

This passage meant that there was no need to declare anything when entering.

Last time, Xia ruofei had been deliberately made difficult by an Australian Customs officer at this entry passage. Later, the officer had also made things difficult for other Chinese tourists and even called them “China people.” At that time, elder Tang, who had been picking them up, was furious. He directly used the strongest legal team of shengbang Corporation in Australia to Sue the officer for racial discrimination.

Although Xia ruofei had returned to the country, he was still paying attention to the progress of the case. The fat official could not compete with a big consortium like Sheng bang because Sheng bang did not care about the cost. The most famous lawyers in Australia had formed a team of lawyers to fight this small case.

Moreover, the official was not clean to begin with. He cursed, threatened Chinese tourists, and used insulting titles. These were all conclusive evidence that the luggage inspection department had no blind spots. Whatever the fat pig said could not be hidden in front of the lip – reading expert.

In the end, the charges of racial discrimination were established. Not only did the fat official lose his well – paid civil servant job, but he was also sentenced to three months in prison, fined 30000 Australian dollars, and deprived of the right to vote for three years. It could be said to be a rather heavy sentence.

Perhaps it was because of the impact of the lawsuit that had caused quite a stir in Australia, Xia ruofei realized that the customs officials did not deliberately make things difficult for the Chinese tourists when they passed through the customs.

Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao also passed the inspection without a hitch.

Xia ruofei was pushing two suitcases, one big and one small. Lin Qiao followed behind him with a face full of excitement. The two of them walked out side by side.

Many people were waiting outside to receive them, and many of them were holding signs with their names on them.

“RUO Fei, this way, this way!”

Xia ruofei heard Liang Qichao’s voice while he was looking for him. He turned around and saw Liang Qichao waving at him happily.
