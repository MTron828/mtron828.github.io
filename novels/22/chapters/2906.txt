2907 The Mexico Freemasons (2)

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Mr. Zhang, you’re too kind. We haven’t even thanked Mr. Lu for his warm reception!” Why would I blame him?”

Only then did Lu Chunfeng secretly heave a sigh of relief. He realized that his back was covered in sweat. When Xia ruofei said that it was inconvenient, he realized that he had spoken too quickly again. Although this person looked friendly and harmless, he was a person close to the Hong sect’s Big Boss, Li Yifu. These big shots were all in charge of big things. It was taboo for him to ask about it without knowing the immensity of the world.

Fortunately, the other party was magnanimous and did not get angry because of this.

Lu Chunfeng also secretly said to himself,”He really should control his mouth in the future, otherwise he might really cause himself big trouble!

After exchanging a few pleasantries, Xia ruofei said,””Mr. Zhang, Mr. Li should have already coordinated with you, right? The two of us are here to take the goods away. ”

“No problem!” Zhang Chao said readily. Uncle Yi had already given the order! Mr. Xia, this must be your first time Mexico, right? What do you think about this? Let’s have lunch together. I’ll be the host. ”

Xia ruofei said tactfully,”Mr. Zhang, there’s no need to eat. We’re in a hurry. We’ll leave as soon as we receive the goods.”

Zhang Chao said,”no matter how busy I am, I still have to eat.” “The two of you have come to Mexico arrived in quachakurakos. If my adopted uncle finds out that I didn’t even keep you for a meal, he will definitely blame me ... I know you’re in a hurry, so I won’t keep you! Let’s just treat this lunch as a welcoming banquet and a farewell banquet! You see, it’s almost eighto’ clock now. It’s almost time for dinner, isn’t it?”

Xia ruofei did not plan to stay for dinner. His plan was to take the things and fly back with Luo Qingfeng. If everything went well, they would be back to Peach Garden Island at night. There was no need to waste half a day here.

Besides, Xia ruofei knew that if he insisted on taking the things and leaving immediately, Zhang Chao would not force them to stay. If there was no other way, he could ask Li Yifu to call Zhang Chao and the problem would be solved.

Just as Xia ruofei was about to continue to decline, a young man in a black leather jacket peeked in and took a look. He hesitated for a moment but still walked into the reception room. He went straight to Zhang Chao’s side and whispered a few words into his ear.

Zhang Chao’s eyebrows raised slightly, but he quickly regained his calm and said,””I know. I’ll go over and handle it in a while.”

“Yes, brother Chao!” The young man quickly bowed slightly and left the reception room.

Zhang Chao then smiled at Xia ruofei and said,””Mr. Xia, even if you’re in a hurry, you should at least check the goods, right? There’s quite a lot of this batch of goods, and I estimate that it’s almost time for lunch after I’ve finished counting them. Can you give me the honor of being a good host?”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and nodded.””Then I’ll have to trouble you!”

Zhang Chao was overjoyed and laughed,””It’s our honor to have Mr. Xia here! Mr. Xia, how about this! I’ll get someone to bring you to inspect the goods now. I still have some things to deal with at the company, so I won’t be able to accompany you two for now. I’ll make a few more toasts to the two of you during lunch!”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”the guest should do as the host wishes!”

Zhang Chao nodded. He waved to call Lu Chunfeng over and said,””Feng, take the two guests to the warehouse to inspect the goods. Uncle’s goods are all in the same container. This is the container number!”

As he spoke, Zhang Chao handed a note to Lu Chunfeng and continued,””Remember, you lead Mr. Xia and the others to the container, open the lead seal, and leave immediately. Don’t disturb Mr. Xia’s inspection!”

Lu Chunfeng knew that this batch of goods must be a little sensitive, and it was not convenient for him to be present. He quickly said,””I understand! Brother Chao, don’t worry! Just leave it to me!”

Zhang Chao nodded, then excused himself from Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng and left the reception room in a hurry.

Under Lu Chunfeng’s lead, Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng passed through a long corridor on the first floor of the shipping company and came directly to the warehouse at the back.

The warehouse was very large. At a glance, there were at least thousands of containers. The warehouse also seemed very empty. If it was full, it could probably hold thousands of containers.

Lu Chunfeng was very familiar with the situation here, and he also had an impression of the container that Zhang Chao mentioned. The container that was sent two days ago was very heavy, and yesterday, it was about to be shipped away by the ship, but it was suddenly stopped.

Lu Chunfeng remembered the general area of the container. He took Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng through the warehouse and found the dark blue container in a short time.

The other containers were stacked together, but this one was placed alone. There were no other containers in the nearby area, so it was very easy to find.

Lu Chunfeng asked the worker in charge of the warehouse to find some tools to open the lead seal of the container. He did not open the door and said to Xia ruofei,””Mr. Xia, if you want to inspect the goods, you can just open the door and go in. That ... Brother Chao has instructions, so I’ll take my leave first!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Alright! Thank you!”

Lu Chunfeng took the worker who came to open the lead seal and left quickly. He also specifically told the management staff here not to approach the area of the container. No one was allowed to disturb them from checking the goods.

After Lu Chunfeng left, Luo Qingfeng immediately asked in confusion,””Master, why don’t you just take the goods and leave?”

Luo Qingfeng was really confused. What was there to be polite to these people? As for Zhang Chao’s words that it would take time to inspect the goods, it was not a problem for a cultivator. Moreover, Xia ruofei’s spiritual power was so strong that he could clearly see what was in the container with just a slight sweep. He did not need to spend time checking.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I wanted to leave directly, but Zhang Chao seemed to have run into some trouble. He did help us and he has a good relationship with my adopted husband. Since we’ve run into him, we can’t just stand by and do nothing. So, I decided to stay and see what’s going on.”

Xia ruofei had heard clearly what the young man in the leather jacket had whispered to Zhang Chao in the reception room. He knew that Zhang Chao was in trouble. Just like what he had told Luo Qingfeng, the firearms purchase was handled by the Mexican Freemasons. Now that they were in trouble, it would not be appropriate for him to just leave. Coincidentally, Zhang Chao had warmly asked them to stay for dinner, so Xia ruofei decided to stay here first. If Zhang Chao could solve the problem himself, Then Xia ruofei would pretend that he didn’t know about this. He would take the goods and leave after lunch. If Zhang Chao couldn’t handle it, Xia ruofei would help him in an appropriate way to return the favor.

Hearing this, Luo Qingfeng came to a sudden realization and said,””So master has other plans, this old servant has not thought it through.”

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”It’s nothing. You’ve rarely lived in the secular world. You might not be so clear about the ways of the world. This is normal.”

“Yes!” “Master, what do we do next?” Luo Qingfeng asked respectfully.

Xia ruofei smiled and pointed at the container.””Of course it’s to inspect the goods. At least put on a show!”

In fact, in this short period of time, Xia ruofei had already scanned the entire container with his spiritual power. He knew the exact number of weapons and equipment in it. After comparing it with the purchase list that he had personally drawn up, everything was clear.

The Mexico Freemasons were indeed very efficient. There was no mistake in the number of firearms, not even a single bullet. All the equipment was packed up and stacked neatly in the containers.
