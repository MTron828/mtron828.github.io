When Li Yao saw Dong Xinyu, he immediately shouted,””Dong Xinyu! Are you F * cking crazy ...”

The dazed Dong Xinyu did not even look at Li Yao. She only wanted to beg for Xia ruofei’s forgiveness. She ran past Li Yao.

“You ...” Li Yao angrily shouted.

“Boss Li, I’m sorry! Xinyu has just been completely blacklisted, and she’s in a hurry to apologize to Mr. Xia!” Fang Hongli explained in a hurry,”we’ll apologize to you later!”

With that, Fang Hongli quickly chased after Dong Xinyu.

Li Yao could not help but be stunned.

How many minutes has it been since Mr. Xia finished the call? Dong Xinyu had been completely banned?

It turned out that he had misjudged him. That Mr. Xia was also an amazing person!

Li Yao thought about it again. How could a person who could call a Big Shot like Tang Yitian his brother really be just an ordinary small boss?

Thinking of this, Li Yao couldn’t help but smile bitterly. He had really forgotten to check the Almanac when he went out today. What an unexpected disaster!

He shook his head helplessly and strode toward the parking lot. It was too deep for him to get involved in this. Li Yao already felt that he should get out of this as soon as possible. He didn’t want to sink deeper and deeper.

......

In Zola’s restaurant, the waiter swiped his card and gave Tang Yitian his signature on the bill.

Then, Tang Yitian, Xia ruofei, and the others also got up and walked out.

Just as they were walking out, Xia ruofei’s phone rang.

It was song Rui.

“Hello, song Rui.” Xia ruofei picked up the phone and asked,”is everything settled?”

Song Rui said in a relaxed tone,”yes. I’ve spoken to the SARFT. They emphasized that this person must be completely banned. Do it as thoroughly as possible. The relevant authorities should have already taken action.”

At this moment, Xia ruofei had reached the entrance of Zola’s restaurant.

As soon as he looked up, he saw Dong Xinyu, who was running back in a daze from the distance. The corners of his mouth could not help but curve up as he said indifferently,””I think ... I can already see the effect! I owe you a favor!”

“Hey! We’re brothers, why are you being so polite!” Song Rui said,”ruofei, I ...”

“Song Rui, I still have something to deal with here.” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll call you back when I’m done with my work!”

With that, Xia ruofei hung up the phone.

Song Rui, who was in a mansion in Beijing, heard the busy tone on his phone and couldn’t help but laugh.””F * ck! This guy hung up on me twice a day! I just finished helping him with something! You’re burning the bridge after crossing it? You really are ...”

However, song Rui and Xia ruofei were very close. He would not get angry over such a thing.

He also knew that something must have happened to Xia ruofei. Otherwise, he would not have hung up so quickly.

Besides, he was not in a hurry to look for Xia ruofei. It was not like he could not wait, so he did not really blame Xia ruofei.

At the entrance of Zola’s restaurant.

Xia ruofei had just kept his phone in his pocket when Dong Xinyu ran to him with a face full of fear.

“Mr ... Mr. Xia, it was all my fault before!” Dong Xinyu said anxiously,”I ... I failed to recognize your greatness. Please spare me! Don’t ban me!”

“Every adult has to be responsible for their own actions. It’s too late for you to say anything now!” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

“No! Mr. Xia, I ... I’ve worked so hard for so many years. It’ll all be over if I’m banned! Please let me go!” Dong Xinyu cried. I ... I ... I’ll do anything you want! Please don’t ban me ...”

As Dong Xinyu spoke, she tried her best to puff out her chest.

Not to mention being the spokesperson for paradise Corporation, Xia ruofei could do anything to her as long as he wanted. As long as he didn’t ban her, she would even give herself to him immediately without any objections.

Unfortunately, Xia ruofei had no interest in such a woman.

Dong Xinyu’s coquettish behavior only made Xia ruofei feel more disgusted.

Xia ruofei didn’t even bat an eye. He said indifferently,””It’s not that I didn’t give you a chance, it’s you who didn’t know how to grasp it. You can go!”

“Don ‘t! “No...” Dong Xinyu grabbed Xia ruofei’s clothes and said,”Mr. Xia, please give me another chance! I really know I was wrong ...”

Tang Yitian slightly frowned and raised his chin at the bodyguards who had been waiting at the entrance of Zola’s restaurant.

The few burly Men in Black suits immediately came forward and pulled Dong Xinyu away without any explanation.

Dong Xinyu was crying and struggling with all her might. However, Tang Yitian, Xia ruofei, and the rest had already gotten into the Mercedes – Benz RV [ 1]. Soon, the door was closed, and the vehicle left.

Only then did the few bodyguards let go of Dong Xinyu. They quickly got into another Mercedes – Benz and followed her steadily.

Dong Xinyu slumped to the ground. At this moment, her heart was like dead ashes, filled with despair.

She knew very well that she was done for. From the moment Xia ruofei made that phone call, she was destined to never have a chance in the entertainment industry. All her previous efforts and efforts had been in vain.

Fang Hongli sighed and helped Dong Xinyu up. She said,””Xinyu, let’s go back first!”

“Sister Fang, what should we do?” Dong Xinyu grabbed Fang Hongli’s hand and said,”why don’t we ... Go and beg President Xu again? He has a lot of connections in the entertainment industry, so he might have a way. ” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
