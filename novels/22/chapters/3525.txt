lu you nodded and did not say anything else.

she just didn’t know much about the cultivation world, but it didn’t mean that she was very stupid or naive, on the contrary, she, who had grown up in an official’s family, was a bit more mature than her peers, so she only half – believed and half – doubted deacon liu’s words.

she believed that the “meeting gift” given by that senior was very precious, but when deacon liu said that even the sect leader didn’t dare to covet it, she felt that it was more or less exaggerated.

attendant liu didn’t know if xia ruofei had really left, but even if he had, she didn’t dare to have any more evil thoughts.

she said to lu you,”lu you, i’m really not lying to you. just based on the fact that this senior can control a flying sword, he is not someone our water element sect can offend, he is at least a cultivator in the golden core stage, on the other hand, our sect master shen is only at the ninth level of the qi refinement realm, the difference of one major realm is like the difference between heaven and earth.” it’s not an exaggeration to say that this senior can annihilate our entire sect by himself, that’s why senior has said that you don’t have to worry at all. no one will dare to snatch these spirit crystals and cultivation techniques, you can return to the sect and cultivate in peace, i believe that with this cultivation technique, your cultivation will progress very, very quickly!”

after lu you heard this, she more or less believed it.

the scene of the flying sword appearing had also left an indelible impression in lu you’s heart.

“deacon liu, it looks like your injuries aren’t light, do you need to go to the hospital?” she asked after some thought.

lu you had not been in contact with cultivation for a long time, so her way of thinking was still the same as before, when she saw deacon liu’s pale face and dejected expression, as well as the fact that he had vomited so much blood just now, her first thought was naturally to go to the hospital to deal with her injuries.

“the hospital can’t treat my injuries … it’s useless even if i go!” manager liu said with a bitter smile, i’d better return to the sect as soon as possible to recuperate!”

Lu You nodded and said,”alright!” i’ll get a car to send you back to the hotel to rest! We need to clean up the scene here as well.”

Even if he wanted to return to the sect, he couldn’t just leave as he pleased. The earliest flight would be tomorrow. Moreover, this place was in a bad condition. There was a car roof in the field in front, so someone had to come over to take care of it.

Deacon Liu wasn’t good at these things in the secular world, and Lu You naturally had all sorts of connections in the capital. At least, it was very easy to deal with such matters.

Hence, Deacon Liu nodded and said weakly,””Alright… Thank you for your hard work!”

After sensing the senior’s admiration for Lu You, Deacon Liu no longer had that high and mighty feeling in front of Lu You. Instead, he subconsciously flattered her.

In reality, Xia ruofei really did not stay at the scene. After he displayed his skill of cutting the roof of a car with a flying sword, he quickly left. He had personally crippled Deacon Liu. He was very clear that Deacon Liu had lost his combat power and was even weaker than an ordinary person. Furthermore, there were no other cultivators around. Thus, Lu You would not be in any danger. Naturally, there was no need for him to stay at the scene.

Most importantly, Song Wei had just finished her dinner. He had to pick her up. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The staff drove the Alphard van back to the Paradise clubhouse. Xia ruofei decided to fly straight to the capital University.

Song Wei and her classmates did not return to the dormitory after dinner. Instead, she strolled around the campus and waited for Xia ruofei to meet her.

Xia ruofei landed his flying sword on the shore of the Wuming Lake. Because the weather was cold, there was almost no one on campus at night. After Xia ruofei added a concealment talisman, even if someone happened to pass by, they would not be able to see him landing from the sky.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power had already found Song Wei who was nearby. He walked towards her.

On the way, Xia ruofei took out his phone and sent Chen Xuan a WeChat message.””Brother Chen, 1 happened to find a friend from many years ago who has started to cultivate. Her name is Lu You, and the sect she joined is the water element sect. If it’s convenient, I would like to ask brother Chen to say hello to sect Master Shen and take care of my friend.

After sending the message, Xia ruofei thought for a while and sent another short message. By the way, 1’11 give my friend a spiritual crystal and a cultivation technique. It’s a small opportunity for her! He hoped that no one would covet these things.

Chen Xuan quickly replied,[brother ruofei, don’t worry!] i’ll contact Shen Hu right away. Your friend will definitely receive the best nurturing in the water element sect, and his spirit crystals and cultivation techniques will definitely not be snatched away.

Xia ruofei smiled and replied,”Thanks! I’ll treat you to a drink later!

On his way back to Capital University, he had already been thinking about this matter. In the end, he came to the conclusion that Lu You would not be in any danger if he revealed his friendship with Lu You to Chen Xuan.

After all, it was easy to find out that he and Lu You were friends. If Chen Xuan really went to find out, he would also find out that Xia ruofei and Lu You had not seen each other for a long time and they were just ordinary friends.

Hence, it was only natural for Xia ruofei to greet a friend he had not met for a long time in the capital and give him some cultivation resources when he found out that the friend had also started on the path of cultivation.

Even if Xia ruofei and the first heaven society became enemies in the future, Lu You would basically not be implicated. After all, they were just ordinary friends..
