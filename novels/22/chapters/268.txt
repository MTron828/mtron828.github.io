Xia ruofei skillfully got into that position. When the familiar pain appeared again, Xia ruofei was stunned. I can do this position again? Xia ruofei was so overjoyed that he even forgot about the intense pain from his torn meridians. It seemed like he could try again after a certain amount of time! Xia ruofei said in his heart. It had been almost half a day since he had tried to do this strange posture. Xia ruofei judged that his body was in the process of recovery and reconstruction. After his meridians were completely repaired from the previous attempt, he could naturally try again. Furthermore, this process of restoration and reconstruction would definitely make his body and meridians stronger! Xia ruofei started to concentrate and grit his teeth. The pain was still very intense. There was a cute pink clock on the opposite side of the princess bed in Ling Qingxue’s room. Xia ruofei could feel the passage of time. In his eyes, the second hand was like a slow motion camera on TV, shaking for a long time before moving one square. Xia ruofei knew that the pain had amplified his nerves and made him feel that time had passed very slowly. One minute passed. Two minutes passed. Three minutes ... Xia ruofei’s facial muscles started to tremble. He gritted his teeth and tried his best to hold on. Fortunately, his perseverance was far beyond that of ordinary people. If he were an ordinary person who had not undergone the cruel anti – captive training, he would have lifted his posture and quit the training as soon as the pain hit him. Xia ruofei’s eyes were red. He looked at the clock on the wall and saw that five minutes had passed. The intense pain made him dizzy, but he still grinned and revealed a smile that was uglier than crying. Last time, he had persisted for five minutes, and this time, he had obviously improved. Xia ruofei’s entire body trembled. Finally, after about five and a half minutes, he could not hold on any longer. He could not help but withdraw from that strange posture. It lasted half a minute longer than the last time ... Xia ruofei’s mouth twitched. He felt weak all over. He lay on the bed, panting. After a while, he recovered and slowly sat up. The feeling of warmth after the intense pain was so comfortable that Xia ruofei felt drowsy. He got up and moved his limbs. Suddenly, he heard a series of cracking sounds as if his bones were colliding. Xia ruofei clenched his fist and a series of cracking sounds could be heard. He casually waved his fist and there was a loud whoosh. Although there was no reference, he could feel that his strength had increased a lot. This strange posture was really heaven – defying! Just maintaining it for a few minutes had such an obvious effect on strengthening the body! Xia ruofei said in his heart. Furthermore, after drinking a pound of white wine, the dizziness had disappeared. Xia ruofei was now very clear – headed. “The alcohol must have been expelled from my body along with the impurities ...” Xia ruofei mumbled to himself. As he said that, he suddenly realized something. He raised his hand and saw that there was a layer of black grease – like impurities on the surface of his skin, and it was still emitting a foul smell. However, the impurities this time were obviously much less than the last time. They did not cover the entire skin, only thin pieces in some parts. Xia ruofei hurriedly opened the window and turned on the air conditioner. He adjusted it to the ventilation gear so that he could get rid of the bad smell as soon as possible. Thinking about how he had made Ling Qingxue’s fragrant room stink, Xia ruofei could not help but scratch his head in embarrassment. Then, Xia ruofei’s expression changed slightly. He quickly turned to look at Ling Qingxue’s princess bed. He had been sitting on top of it practicing that posture just now. After practicing, he had even laid on the bed sheet. The impurities that his body had discharged ... As far as Xia ruofei could see, there were two or three black stains on Ling Qingxue’s light pink bed sheet! If Ling Qingxue’s blanket had not been folded neatly at the head of the bed, it would have probably been stained as well. What should he do? He had dirtied Ling Qingxue’s bed sheets after staying here for a night ... Xia ruofei felt his head throb. He even regretted that he had been in such a hurry to practice this movement. Xia ruofei couldn’t stand the sour smell coming from his body. He decided not to care about the bed sheet for now and rushed into the bathroom to wash it. Fortunately, he had a change of clothes in the space at any time. He washed the long johns in the bathroom and hung them in the space to dry. As for his coat, although it smelled a little, he couldn’t change it. He didn’t bring anything else with him today except for a bag of wine. It didn’t make sense that he would change his clothes the next day. Hence, Xia ruofei hung the coat on the balcony outside Ling Qingxue’s room. It should be well – ventilated for the night and there should not be any smell. In the end, Xia ruofei came to the bed and looked at the bedsheet helplessly. After much consideration, he decided to wash the stains off. He couldn’t just leave such an obvious stain here, could he? Besides, he was going to lie on it to sleep tonight. Hence, Xia ruofei removed the bedsheets with a bitter face and took them to the bathroom. He repeatedly scrubbed the dirty spots and hung them on the drying pole on the balcony after confirming that they were clean. Xia ruofei did not know what Ling Xiaotian’s expression would be like when he saw the bed sheets being dried out in the sun tomorrow morning. However, it was useless to think about it now. He made up his mind and decided to sleep first. So he opened Ling Qingxue’s cabinet and looked for the spare bed sheets. While he was looking for the bed sheets, Xia ruofei accidentally opened a cabinet door. It was filled with all sorts of lace underwear. He quickly closed the cabinet door, but he could not help but let his imagination run wild. He could not help but imagine Ling Qingxue wearing those lace underwear. Can’t we just have a good night’s sleep? Xia ruofei smiled bitterly. After a while, Xia ruofei finally found the bed sheet. He laid it out, spread out Ling Qingxue’s fragrant blanket, and got into bed. His mind was filled with Ling Qingxue’s graceful figure, and he tossed and turned until very late at night before he finally fell asleep. The next morning, Xia ruofei only woke up when Ling Xiaotian knocked on his door and asked him to have breakfast. He got up and answered first. Then he ran to the balcony to put on his coat. He touched the bed sheet and it was still wet. It seemed that it was impossible to change it back in the morning. Xia ruofei had no choice but to open the door. Ling Xiaotian still did not leave and stood at the door, waiting. When he saw Xia ruofei come out, he smiled and said,””Ruofei, go and have breakfast!” Xia ruofei nodded and said after some hesitation,””That ... Uncle Ling, I accidentally dirtied Qingxue’s bed sheets last night. I’ve already washed them and hung them out to dry.” It was so obvious that Xia ruofei could not possibly hide it. He might as well take the initiative to say it so that Ling Xiaotian would not make blind guesses. There was not enough time for the bed sheets to dry in one night ... Xia ruofei suddenly realized that he had made a stupid mistake! Time! Time! Why didn’t he leave the bed sheets in the spirit map space last night? A few days had passed since he had spent the night in the spirit map space. The bed sheets must be completely dry by now! It was too late to say anything now ... Xia ruofei looked at Ling Xiaotian. As expected, Ling Xiaotian had a strange expression on his face. Staying in the boudoir at night and dirtying the bedsheets, no matter how one heard it, it was full of meaning. Xia ruofei quickly explained,”uncle Ling, I was too drunk yesterday. I accidentally vomited it out. However, I have already cleaned it up. I have also washed the bed sheets!” Ling Xiaotian smiled and said,”so that’s how it is!” It’s okay, ruofei, you can just leave it there, Madam Chen will take care of it!” “It’s fine, it’s fine. It’s just a matter of convenience ...” Xia ruofei said with a sigh of relief. “Let’s go eat!” Ling Xiaotian said with a smile. The two of them went downstairs together. Xia ruofei thought that Ling Xiaotian should have accepted his explanation, but he did not expect Ling Xiaotian to say in his heart,””Little guy! I’ve had two drinks with you, how could I not know your alcohol tolerance? You’re going to throw up from that little bit of alcohol? It seemed that the firepower of young people was exuberant! Should I have asked Qingxue to come back earlier?” If Xia ruofei knew what Ling Xiaotian was thinking right now, he would definitely vomit blood. This was like jumping into the Yellow River and not being able to clear his name!
