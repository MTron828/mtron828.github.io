Chapter 755: Starry Night rescue (1)

The caller was Niu Tao, a Lieutenant Colonel from the Military District. Back then, Xia ruofei had a conflict with the Deputy Director of the Linhai town police station because of Lin Qiao and her daughter. After asking Wolf King Guo Zhan for help, the local leaders of the southeast province were alerted. It was this Lieutenant Colonel Niu who accompanied Tian Huilan, who was also the mayor of Sanshan, and Chen Bo, the director of the Public Security Bureau of Sanshan city, to Linhai town overnight to deal with the matter.

Furthermore, Niu Tao had another identity. He was the former Squadron Leader of the lone wolf assault team. The reason why he was transferred to the provincial Military Region was because he had been seriously injured during a mission. After he recovered, his physical condition was no longer suitable for serving in the frontline troops, especially in special combat units. That was why he was transferred to the provincial Military Region.

It was because of this relationship that Xia ruofei and Niu Tao had a natural sense of intimacy. After that time, the two of them had exchanged contact information. They would contact each other occasionally, and Niu Tao had even asked Xia ruofei out for drinks twice.

However, because the two of them did not have much interaction in their work or career, they could be considered as friends of gentlemen, and they did not contact each other often.

It was already so late that day, but Niu Tao suddenly called. Xia ruofei had a bad feeling.

He quickly picked up the phone.

“Hello, brother bull!” Xia ruofei said in a calm voice.

“Blood Wolf, are you at the three mountains?”

Hearing the familiar code name and voice, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but open his mouth in surprise. The person on the phone with him was not Niu Tao, but the leader of the lone wolf assault team, Wolf King Guo Zhan, whom he had not seen since he retired from the Army.

Xia ruofei subconsciously straightened his back and said,””Wolf King, I’m in San Shan city now!”

“That’s great!”Guo Zhan immediately said. It’s not convenient to talk about it over the phone. Go to the military general Hospital immediately, Fire Wolf will be waiting for you at the door!”

“Fire Wolf” was Niu Tao’s codename in the lone wolf assault team. He was in the same batch as Guo Zhan, and the two of them had been through life and death together, just like Xia ruofei and Lin Hu. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Understood!” Xia ruofei replied without hesitation,”I’ll be there in ten minutes!”

......

With that, Xia ruofei immediately started the car. The Knight XV roared and rushed out of the parking lot like a wild horse. It screeched to a stop at the entrance. The huge car did a beautiful drift and rushed to the road.

Although there were still a lot of cars on the street at nineo’ clock, it was no longer the rush hour traffic. The Knight XV off – Road vehicle nimbly shuttled through the sparse traffic. With the dull roar of the engine, the car rushed in the direction of the military general Hospital.

Xia ruofei operated the car skillfully. It looked like he was in danger, but in reality, he was moving smoothly through the traffic. At the same time, he communicated with the spirit map space with his mind and took out two porcelain bottles. Inside were two bottles of spirit Heart Flower petal solution that he usually had. Both were the kind with higher concentration.

At the same time, he also took out a set of silver needles for acupuncture from the space and put them in his bag.

Guo Zhan had urgently called him at the military general Hospital. There was an 80% chance that there was an emergency, and it was very likely that someone had been injured, and the hospital had encountered some difficulties in treating them.

After all, his experience in the past year after his retirement was no secret to Guo Zhan. Xia ruofei had mentioned it during the last phone call. Guo Zhan must know that he had rich experience in dealing with some difficult and miscellaneous diseases.

Xia ruofei recalled that two or three months ago, when he was on the phone with Guo Zhan, he said that he might come to the three mountains to see him after a while.

Xia ruofei was sure that Guo Zhan was here for a mission in the southeast province. However, due to confidentiality, Xia ruofei, who was very familiar with the rules, did not ask for details.

Now it seemed that Guo Zhan had personally led a team to carry out a mission, and this mission seemed to have some trouble.

Xia ruofei’s mind quickly analyzed so many things.

The military general Hospital was also in the Bell Tower District. Xia ruofei used the Knight XV’s speed as much as possible, so it took him more than eight minutes to reach the hospital.

He immediately saw Niu Tao, who was dressed in casual clothes. He was standing under the sign of the General Hospital and looking around with a worried expression.

Xia ruofei blinked twice and honked a few times. Then, he rolled down the window and waved at Niu Tao.

Niu Tao looked over and saw that Xia ruofei was in the driver’s seat. He quickly jogged over and pulled out the front passenger seat.”Little Xia, drive forward. I’ll show you the way!”

“Brother bull, what’s the situation?” Xia ruofei asked as he started the car again.

“I’m not too sure about the details. ” Niu Tao said in a heavy tone,”you know the rules. Guo Zhan definitely wouldn’t tell me so much. I only know ... That their losses this time are not small ... Turn right at the intersection ahead!”

After Niu Tao pointed Xia ruofei in the right direction, he continued,””One person was sacrificed, and one person was seriously injured. He is still being resuscitated in the specialist building. Academician Cai zhengbin, the director of the General Hospital’s major surgery department, is personally acting as the chief surgeon. However, the situation is not very optimistic. Guo Zhan is also a little desperate, so he thought of calling you over ... We can only make a last resort in a desperate situation ... Sigh!”

Although Niu Tao’s words were not very pleasant and he seemed to have no confidence in Xia ruofei, Xia ruofei was not unhappy at all because his attention was not on the rest of the words.
