Xia ruofei felt the same way. He nodded and said,””You and I both lack understanding of the means of golden core cultivators. I didn’t expect Luo Qingfeng to have so many trump cards and so much power. Now I know that a person like him who has been cultivating for more than a hundred years has a terrifying Foundation. The overall strength of the cultivation world is also far higher than we imagined. If we really encounter cultivation sects in the future, we have to be more careful. ”

“Yes, martial granduncle’s words are extremely true!” Li Yifu nodded and said.

“But no matter what, the crisis this time has finally been resolved!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”from the results, it can’t be more perfect! Now that we’ve taken over a cultivation paradise like the peach source Island, we’ll be in a favorable position at the right time and place. Don’t waste such a good cultivation environment. After all, you’re not young anymore. If you want to advance further in your cultivation, you’ll have to put in more effort than ordinary people. ”

“I understand!” Li Yifu said,”senior granduncle, you’ve given me the Guiyuan Scripture and developed a treasure land like the peach source Island. If I still can’t make a breakthrough in my cultivation, I’ll really let down your care, senior granduncle! This disciple will never forget the great kindness that martial granduncle has shown this disciple!”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.”Since you call me senior granduncle, it’s my responsibility to guide you and provide you with the best cultivation environment.” You and I are on the same side, so there’s no need to be so polite. Although you have to work hard in your cultivation, you can’t be too hasty, or it’ll easily lead to an unstable foundation, and it’ll be more difficult to break through to the next realm in the future. ”

Li Yifu had not even reached refined Qi Level 5 yet, but Xia ruofei was already preparing for him to break through the shackles of the refined Qi stage in the future. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Li Yifu hurriedly replied,”your disciple understands. Thank you for your reminder, senior granduncle!”

“I’ll tell you what to do next!”Xia ruofei said.

“Yes!” Li Yifu said,”grand uncle – Master, please give me your instructions!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”the situation here is pretty much stable. I’ll be back in two days.” I’ll be focusing on recruitment in the coming days. ”

Xia ruofei had already recruited some veterans, including some excellent officers and retired soldiers of the lone wolf assault team. These people would gather at the three mountains for a short period of training before being sent to Paradise Island to be responsible for the safety of the entire Island.

Although the array could defend against the attacks of cultivators, the daily safety and the operation and maintenance of some safety facilities on the island required manpower.

Hence, other than the security personnel made up of elite veterans, Xia ruofei also wanted to recruit some staff to maintain the daily operations of the island, such as tower supervisors, weather forecaster, dock manager, and so on.

Xia ruofei continued,”foster husband, as the array continues to operate, the cultivation environment here will get better. So, I hope that you can stay on Peach Blossom Island and help me manage the entire Island.” Of course, the most important thing is that the environment here should be more beneficial for your cultivation. ”

Li Yifu showed a grateful expression and said without hesitation,””Thank you for your consideration, senior granduncle!”

Before he met Xia ruofei, he did not even dare to imagine that he could break through the shackles of the meditational stage. He did not even dare to imagine that there was a place with such dense spiritual Qi in the world. In the future, he would be able to cultivate in such a dense spiritual energy bath every day. He couldn’t help but be overjoyed at the thought of this.

“Besides the daily management of the island, I also hope that you can start learning about arrays. In the future, when I’m not on the Paradise Island, you must at least be able to control the arrays to a certain extent,” said Xia ruofei.

When Li Yifu heard this, he couldn’t help but feel a little uncertain.

He hesitated for a moment.”Grand uncle – Master, I don’t have any Foundation in the field of arrays. I’m afraid I won’t be able to meet your expectations in a short time ... Besides, the Taixu xuanqing formation is of such a high level. I don’t think I can control it with my weak spiritual power cultivation, right?”

Xia ruofei said,”I’ll make a simple Dharma Treasure that can communicate with the core array. This way, as long as you’re within the range of the array, you can control it to a certain extent. It doesn’t require a high level of spiritual power.”

“If that’s the case, I can give it a try, but I’m afraid ...” Li Yifu said.

“You must have confidence in yourself!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”the array path is not as difficult as you think. If you calm down and learn, you will definitely gain something!”

“Alright, this disciple will listen to senior granduncle!” Li Yifu said.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”Luo Qingfeng and Wang Boshan will leave Peach Blossom Island tomorrow.” I’ll let Zheng Yongshou stay behind to assist you. His array Dao level is also not bad, so you can also consult him often. I’ll give him a heads up, he definitely won’t dare to hide it!”

“Yes! Senior granduncle!” Li Yifu replied respectfully.

He was touched because Xia ruofei had been so thoughtful.

Xia ruofei stood up and walked into his bedroom. Then, he took out two books on arrays that he had prepared in advance from the medium. He had used his free time to copy them down.

Xia ruofei passed the two books on arrays to Li Yifu and said with a smile,””I should be staying on the island for another day or two. You should read these two books about array Dao in these two days. If there’s anything you don’t understand, just ask me directly.”

“Alright, martial granduncle!” Li Yifu said,”I will definitely study hard. It’s just that I’m not very talented. I’m afraid ...”

“Don’t worry! I don’t expect you to become an array expert. ” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”you only need to have a general grasp of the array Dao. It’ll be fine as long as you don’t know the concept of it.”

The control Dharma Treasure he was going to make could be controlled by different spiritual power techniques. Even cultivators who didn’t know anything about arrays could use some of the functions of the array as long as they mastered the corresponding spiritual power techniques.

However, he knew the truth but not the reason. Xia ruofei didn’t want Li Yifu to stay at this level, so he still hoped that he could learn some array knowledge.

Even if Li Yifu really didn’t have talent in this area, it would be good to have some knowledge of arrays.

Only then did Li Yifu let out a sigh of relief. He suddenly felt less pressure.

“Yes, martial granduncle!” He said. I understand. ”

In fact, Li Yifu was not afraid of difficulties, nor was he hesitating about Xia ruofei’s task. He was most worried that he would not be able to do the job that Xia ruofei had given him. If he made a mistake in the future or caused an accident because he did not know about arrays, it would not be good.

Li Yifu and Xia ruofei chatted for a while before he got up and went back to his room.

It was already four in the morning and the sky was starting to light up, but Xia ruofei was not sleepy at all.

Therefore, he simply took out the map of Paradise Island from the medium and began to study it.

In order to activate the Taixu xuanqing formation, Xia ruofei had made some changes. However, there was no large – scale construction, and the layout of the island was basically the same.

In the future, there would be many ordinary people working on the island. The big and small formations contained in the Taixu xuanqing formation naturally needed to be arranged to a certain extent, and some forbidden areas were drawn out on the island. Otherwise, the staff would be accidentally trapped in the formation in the future, and they would not be able to work and live normally.

It would be fine if it was a trapping array, but if he accidentally entered a killing array, he would lose his life.

Hence, Xia ruofei had to further plan the island’s functional zones according to the current layout. At the same time, he had to make adjustments to the array to ensure safety and the convenience of the staff on the island.

These drawings were left by the Liu family. Some of them were effect drawings, depicting the appearance of the island after the completion of the construction. Some were construction drawings, which clearly showed the functional area of each part of the island.

Although there were still some unfinished work when the Liu family withdrew, most of the construction had been completed. The layout of the island was basically the same as on the drawings.

As Xia ruofei looked at the blueprint, he used a pencil to write and draw on it. Soon, the prototype of an array formation was formed.
