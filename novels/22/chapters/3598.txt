Chapter 3599: The birth of the spiritual puppet (2)

Translator: 549690339

This set of bone armor looked very similar to the real person’s bone armor, except that there was a trace of metallic luster in the grayish – White color. Each joint of the bone armor was very precise, making the entire set of bone armor like a piece of art.

However, Xia ruofei was clear that this bone armor was only half – finished.

After that, the bone Gu had to be tempered by the flame and go through several processes at the same time before it could finally be transformed into a true spirit Gu.

Xia ruofei rested for a while, then put the soul puppet bone Gu aside and gathered a large amount of materials.

This time, the materials used were much more than the ones used to refine the spirit puppet bone Gu, and the variety was also more complex.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual energy moved slightly and a pale flame appeared in the center of the formation. Although it looked unremarkable, there was a soul – stirring power that was emitted from the flame.

Xia ruofei took a deep breath and raised his hand. A large amount of materials floated in the air and were mixed together.

Then, Xia ruofei waved his hand and the materials were sent above the flames.

Under the scorching heat of the flames, these materials were melting at a speed visible to the naked eye, and at the same time, they were constantly fusing with each other.

After a while, the original materials were all gone, only a large ball of fiery red magma – like liquid floating above the flame, constantly changing shape under the heat of the flame.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power was closely monitoring the situation of these materials. At the same time, he was constantly adjusting the intensity of the flames through the array.

This process lasted for a full three hours.

The lava – like liquid had been roasted by the pale – White flame for three hours, and after such a long time, the thick liquid had also shrunk by a size. Some of the impurities in it had been refined away.

Xia ruofei was constantly checking the situation of the materials. At this moment, he nodded to himself that the time was almost right and it looked exactly the same as described in &lt;&lt;artifact refining Journal&gt;&gt;.

Then, Xia ruofei had a thought.

The invisible spatial force immediately wrapped around the set of soul puppet bone armor and floated it up. Then, the set of bone armor was also thrown into the thick liquid above the flame.

This thick liquid immediately wrapped around the bone armor. As if it had a life of its own, it directly adhered to the bone armor and then continued to extend.

It didn’t seem like there was much of this thick liquid, but it completely wrapped around the bone armor in a very short time.

Just like that, the bone armor and the thick liquid continued to be roasted in the flame.

Xia ruofei was also constantly adding new materials.

After these materials were melted in the flame, they also attached to it.

The process seemed easy, but it was actually a test of control.

The weight of the materials, the processing method, and the order of throwing in had to completely meet the requirements recorded in the &quot;artifact refining Chronicles.&quot; As long as there was a mistake in any of these steps, then this refining would be a complete failure, and ail the previous efforts would be in vain.

Of course, there was still no problem with the control core. It was just that a lot of materials, time, and energy were wasted.

With the constant addition of new materials, the outer layer of the bone armor became thicker and thicker. Moreover, each layer of materials seemed to be reacting with each other, gradually showing a shape similar to human muscle and skin.

Although Xia ruofei was very clear about what would happen during the entire process, he could not help but be amazed when he saw it with his own eyes.
