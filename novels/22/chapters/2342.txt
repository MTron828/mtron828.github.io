2343 Beating_Wu Qiang looked at Xia ruofei’s expression through the rearview mirror and said,””Boss, this car wasn’t parked at the entrance when I came out.”

“I understand, Wu Qiang. Let’s drive in,” Xia ruofei said calmly.

“Yes, boss!” Wu Qiang didn’t say much and calmly replied.

He pressed a button on the remote control, and the back door of the courtyard slowly slid open. Then, he started the car and drove into the courtyard.

On the other side of the Mercedes – Benz, when Xia ruofei’s Toyota Elfa appeared at the alley, the people in the car had already seen it. However, it was not until the car had reached the entrance that the back door of the Mercedes – Benz opened. A middle – aged lady, who was dressed in jewelry, stepped out of the car.

The driver of the Mercedes – Benz jogged to the back, opened the trunk, and stood behind the middle – aged lady with some gifts.

The middle – aged lady still had a reserved smile on her face as she nodded slightly in the direction of Toyoda’s Elfa.

However, the smile on her face froze at the next moment because Elfa didn’t stop at all. He drove straight into the courtyard and ignored her.

The middle – aged lady was still raising her hand to greet Xia ruofei in the car in what she thought was an elegant manner. However, her arm froze in place halfway, and her elegant style instantly turned into a comical one.

When she came back to her senses, Xia ruofei’s Toyota Elfa had already driven into the courtyard house and the electric door was slowly closing.

The middle – aged lady’s face darkened. She stared at the electric door for a few seconds before she said to the driver coldly,””Go and knock on the door!”

This voice was extremely cold, as if it had come from an Ice Mountain that would never melt.

The driver, who had been working for the middle – aged lady for many years, naturally knew how angry his employer was when he spoke to her in such a tone. He couldn’t help but shiver. He quickly put down the gifts in his hand and jogged to the gate of the courtyard house.

In the backyard of the courtyard house, the electric door of the Elfa car slid open slowly. Xia ruofei got out of the car and walked towards the master’s courtyard in the middle.

Behind him, Wu Qiang was carrying Xia ruofei’s simple luggage and quickly followed.

Wu Qiang had seen everything that had happened at the entrance of the courtyard house. However, he was very clear that he should not ask what he should not ask. He had to maintain the good habit that he had developed in the Army.

At this moment, the doorbell rang. Wu Qiang subconsciously stopped in his tracks.

“Let sister – in – Law Xiujuan handle it!” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

“Okay, boss!” Wu Qiang replied.

Then, he shouted for his sister – in – Law, Wu Xiujuan, to go over and see who was messing around outside. In fact, he knew very well that the person who rang the doorbell must be the person in the car just now, but since his boss had ordered him to do so, he just had to do as he was told.

Xia ruofei did not stop and walked straight to the master’s courtyard in the middle.

Xia ruofei had recognized the black Mercedes – Benz the moment he saw it.

It was the Liu family’s car. To be more precise, it was the car of elder Liu’s daughter, Liu Lifang.

While he was treating elder Liu, the children of elder Liu would visit him from time to time. Liu Lifang would come in the same car every time. With Xia ruofei’s memory, he would never forget her after seeing her once.

What made him unhappy was that his plane had just landed and he had not even reached home yet, but the Liu family was already waiting here.

Liu Lifang’s intention was obvious – she wanted Xia ruofei to continue treating elder Liu.

However, Xia ruofei did not like this kind of aggressive attitude. He had made a verbal agreement with the Liu family and had also obtained some benefits by treating elder Liu’s illness. However, this did not mean that he had sold himself to the Liu family.

Strictly speaking, the relationship between Xia ruofei and Mr. Liu as doctors and patients, as well as the pharmaceutical company and the verbal promises that the Liu family had made to the song family, were just payment for the consultation.

How could a patient’s family call for a Doctor Who had just landed after a long – distance flight and had not even reached home? Shouldn’t you at least let me rest?

This wasn’t called inviting people, this was called forcing them to abdicate.

Xia ruofei would not let them have their way.

Xia ruofei had just arrived at the middle courtyard when Xia Xiaolan, who was working in the backyard, quickly walked over and said,””Boss, there’s someone outside looking for you. It’s Liu Lifang, the Senior Vice President of Liu’s group.”

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”help me reject it. Just say that I’m tired from the journey. I won’t be seeing any guests today.”

Xia Xiaolan was stunned for a moment. Wu Qiang, who was beside her, said,”Xiao LAN, don’t just stand there. Do as the boss says!”

“Oh!” Xia Xiaolan came back to her senses and said,”alright, I’ll go now!” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

She didn’t know why Xia ruofei, who had always been easy – going, would reject the guests who had already arrived at the door. However, she didn’t need to speculate about her boss’s decision and just followed it.

After Xia Xiaolan left, Wu Qiang put down Xia ruofei’s luggage and said,””Boss, you rest for a while. I’ll go down too.”

Xia ruofei nodded slightly.”Okay. Just call me when it’s time for dinner. No matter who comes, block them for me.”

“Understood!” Wu Qiang said concisely and to the point. Then, he bowed slightly to Xia ruofei, turned around, and left the master’s courtyard in the middle.

Xia ruofei put his phone aside and took out a set of loungewear. He went into the bathroom and took a nice bath.

He enjoyed the jacuzzi and unknowingly soaked in it for more than half an hour.
