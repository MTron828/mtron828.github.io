2208 Facing_Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile bitterly. Ling Qingxue was in a bad mood now, so everything seemed to be premeditated by Xia ruofei.

“Qingxue, then ... Can I use the condition of the bet on ...” He asked with an innocent face. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“You can ‘t!” Ling Qingxue did not wait for Xia ruofei to finish his sentence and interrupted him.”Do you think this is a game?”

Xia ruofei smiled awkwardly and said,””If I lose the bet, I’ll definitely fulfill my promise. I’m a man ...”

“You said you’re a man, but unfortunately, I’m a woman!” Ling Qingxue pursed her lips and said,”and she’s a woman with a narrow heart ...”

“Why would I? My Qingxue is the most generous!” Xia ruofei smiled apologetically.

He knew that he couldn’t afford to provoke Ling Qingxue, so he had to be extremely careful with his words.

Unfortunately, Ling Qingxue was not moved at all. She pouted and said,””You know how to flatter now?”

“I’m just telling the truth ...” Xia ruofei smiled.

Ling Qingxue glared at Xia ruofei. She did not know how to criticize Xia ruofei and was even more furious.

It was a sunny morning, and the view of the sea was quite wide. At first glance, one could see the boundless sea. However, the same view was not beautiful in Ling Qingxue’s eyes at all.

Many times, it didn’t matter what you saw. When you were in a good mood, even if it was dark clouds, you would still find it as beautiful as a painting.

Ling Qingxue did not say anything and Xia ruofei did not dare to provoke her. The two of them fell silent and the atmosphere became very heavy.

After a long while, Ling Qingxue finally said,””RUO Fei, my cultivation has already reached the peak of refined Qi Level 3, and I’ve also successfully combined cultivation with your spirit body. This is such good news, why don’t you quickly report it to Song Wei? Wasn’t she the one who directed all this?”

Xia ruofei looked embarrassed and said,””This ... There’s no hurry. I’ll let her know when I have time ...”

“I told you to contact her now, video call her on WeChat!” Ling Qingxue said, not allowing any room for discussion.

Xia ruofei explained helplessly,”there’s no internet at sea!” I can’t use WeChat ...”

“Did you forget about the equipment you introduced to me yesterday?” Ling Qingxue asked with a half – Smile. You told me yourself yesterday that even if there’s no signal in the open sea, we can connect to the internet through satellite on this yacht. There’s even WiFi coverage!”

Xia ruofei wanted to slap himself! Why would he show off this for no reason? This time, he couldn’t even hide ...

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Qingxue, why did you spend so much time and effort to contact Song Wei?” Don’t tell me you ... Want to talk to her?”

Ling Qingxue immediately replied,”of course not!” I just want to hear what you guys have to say! Didn’t you say that Song Wei was the one who suggested this? I have to see if you’re lying! So ... You’re not allowed to tell Song Wei that I’m by your side, not even a hint! Otherwise, I’ll ignore you for the rest of my life!”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei could not help but feel a headache. Ling Qingxue, on the other hand, was still looking at him with a burning gaze.

Xia ruofei was a little scared by Ling Qingxue’s stare. In the end, he could only nod helplessly.

“Take out your phone!” Ling Qingxue said, satisfied.

Xia ruofei said helplessly,”but we have to connect to the internet first!” We need to go to the cockpit ...”

“Let’s go together!” Ling Qingxue said indifferently.

Although Xia ruofei’s head was spinning, he could only nod and bring Ling Qingxue back to the cockpit.

Although he dawdled for a while, he still managed to connect to the internet.

Then, the two of them went to the stern of the ship. Under Ling Qingxue’s watchful eyes, Xia ruofei sent a video call request to Song Wei on WeChat.

Ling Qingxue was standing behind Xia ruofei. From this angle, she could see Xia ruofei’s phone screen and it just so happened that he was out of the range of the camera.

Before Xia ruofei opened his WeChat, Ling Qingxue had specifically warned him not to turn his phone around on purpose and take a picture of himself. He had to keep his phone in a fixed position.

Now that Xia ruofei was in the wrong and was full of guilt towards Ling Qingxue, he naturally agreed to whatever she said ...

The familiar dial tone came from the phone. Xia ruofei prayed in his heart. Please don’t answer it ... Please don’t answer it ... It’s best if you don’t even have your phone with you ...

However, things often turned out contrary to one’s wishes. Soon, the dial tone stopped, and the phone showed that it was connected.

Immediately after, the video call was connected.

In the video, Song Wei was wearing outdoor clothes and carrying a huge backpack. When she saw Xia ruofei, she said coyly,””Are you on the yacht? You really know how to enjoy life ... I’m still suffering in the wilderness! Aren’t you just drawing aggro?”

Ling Qingxue was standing right behind Xia ruofei. Hence, when Song Wei spoke to Xia ruofei in such a coquettish tone, Xia ruofei felt extremely embarrassed. However, he could not show it.

He could only try to maintain a more natural expression and asked,””You guys haven’t finished your field trip yet?”

“Soon, there’s still some finishing touches ...” Song Wei said,”are you in San Shan or Jing?”

“I’m currently at Mt. Three, but I’ll probably be going to Beijing in about ten days.” Xia ruofei replied,”I’m going to film a show on xiangnan TV’s life I’m looking forward to. I’ve already promised them.”
