“I heard you’ve returned to San Shan?” Song Wei said with a smile.

“Woof! You’re really well – informed!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I just got home yesterday. You know it already!”

“That’s right! We have a mole in Beijing!” Song Wei joked.

“Lady song, what are your instructions?” Xia ruofei asked.

“I wouldn’t dare to give you any instructions, Chairman Xia!” Song Wei said,”I need to talk to you about something!”

“Say it! I’m driving!” Xia ruofei said.

“Are you free tonight? I’ll treat you to a meal!” Song Wei said.

“What’s wrong? Why are you treating me to a meal out of the blue?” Xia ruofei joked.

“Why are you all fine?” Song Wei said,”you’re my Savior. Do I need a reason to treat you to a meal? Just tell me if you’re free or not!”

“It’s hard to say ... Tonight!” Xia ruofei muttered,”I should be free tomorrow!”

Xia ruofei had gone to Ling Xiaotian’s house for lunch this afternoon. He still wanted to spend the night with Ling Qingxue as a newly – wedded couple. Naturally, he was not willing to go out to socialize.

“Alright, tomorrow night then!” Song Wei replied without hesitation. I’ll also introduce a few friends to you. ”

“Friend?” Xia ruofei was stunned.

“They’re all powerful friends from the southeast province and Sanshan city. Most of their fathers are leaders ...” Song Wei said tactfully.

In fact, it was not tactful. The meaning was already very clear.

Xia ruofei suddenly felt a sense of déjà vu. Wasn’t this a replica of what song Rui did in the capital a few days ago? Song Rui had found some rich young masters from the capital. This time, when they returned to the three mountains, Song Wei immediately introduced him to such friends.

Xia ruofei immediately realized that this was not Song Wei’s personal action. It could be song Qiming’s intention, or even elder song ‘s.

He couldn’t help but feel a trace of warmth in his heart.

“I understand, I understand!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ll definitely be there tomorrow!”

“Then it’s settled!” “Drive carefully!” Song Wei said happily. I’m hanging up ...”

“I’ll see you tomorrow!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

When they arrived at Ling Xiaotian’s Villa, the father and daughter had just returned from the company.

They only got off work on time because Xia ruofei was coming over for dinner.

Recently, Ling Xiaotian’s company had been expanding rapidly, especially the private restaurant. Because of the secret Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup, business was surprisingly good. It had been preparing to open a branch not long after it opened.

In addition, the winery had also brought in a large amount of cash flow, and the hotel business was also quite smooth, so the father and daughter were busier by the day.

Ling Xiaotian was very happy to see Xia ruofei. He greeted him with a smile,””RUO Fei is here! Hurry, come in and sit!”

“Uncle Ling, how have you been?” Xia ruofei first blinked at Ling Qingxue, then asked with a smile.

“I’m busy! What a tiring life!” Ling Xiaotian laughed as he spoke.

Ling Qingxue took the Taoyuan vegetables and Drunken Eight Immortals wine from Xia ruofei’s hands and said with a smile,””Dad, you’re almost becoming a hands – off manager now, leaving everything to me to deal with, and you’re still working hard! I think I’m the one who has a hard life!”

“Then wouldn’t I still be in charge of the company? You! You should be content! I’m nurturing you! Who asked you to not have a brother? I have such a big family business, and in the end, didn’t I pass it to you?”

“I don’t care!” Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”I don’t even have a day of leisure ...”

“Qingxue, how can you speak to uncle Ling like that?” Xia ruofei deliberately put on a straight face and said,”you’re the heir of the lingji F & B group. You have to take responsibility!”

“Listen, listen, RUO Fei’s awareness is higher than yours!” Ling Xiaotian said,”I say, ruofei, Qingxue is a girl. It’s really hard for her to work like this all day. Why don’t you come to the company and help me?” Anyway, my company will be handed over to you two sooner or later!”

Xia ruofei quickly waved his hand and said,””Aiyo! Uncle, I can ‘t! I’m not cut out to run a company! In my small company, I’ve always left it to the professional manager and never managed it myself!”

When Ling Qingxue heard this, she laughed and said,””Dad! Can’t you tell? This guy is just standing there and talking, but once he’s serious, he’ll immediately run away ...”

Xia ruofei protested,”What do you mean I’m scared?” I’m being highly responsible for uncle Ling’s company, okay? A person like me who can’t accomplish anything but ruin things should be firmly excluded from your company’s leadership team!”

Ling Xiaotian couldn’t help but burst out laughing.”You little brat, you’re so good at slacking off and still have so many tricks up your sleeve. Alright, I won’t force you. It’s the same if you do your own business well. ”

“AI! Uncle is wise!” Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows at Ling Qingxue in a show of force.

Ling Qingxue, on the other hand, made a face at Xia ruofei.

“Don’t just stand in the courtyard, come in and have some tea!” Ling Xiaotian said.

When they arrived at the living room of the villa, Xia ruofei quickly found some tea leaves and took the initiative to prepare the tea. Ling Qingxue, on the other hand, carried her things to the kitchen to prepare lunch.

Ling Qingxue’s cooking skills were not bad. In a short while, she and the housekeeper had prepared a table full of dishes and called for Xia ruofei and Ling Xiaotian to eat.

In the afternoon, the two of them opened a bottle of Drunken Eight Immortals wine and chatted happily as they drank.
