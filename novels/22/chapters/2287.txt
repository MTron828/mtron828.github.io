2288 Emergency (1)

Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat. He knew that something big must have happened. Otherwise, Song Wei would not have lost her composure and become so helpless.

“Don’t worry, Weiwei,” he said quickly.”Tell me slowly. What happened?”

“My dad ... My dad ... He was in a car accident!” Song Wei sobbed. The situation seems to be very bad ... My mom ... Called me and asked me to go back as soon as possible. She said ... She said ... My dad ... He’s dying ... Wuwu ...”

At the end of her sentence, Song Wei could not help but cry.

Xia ruofei’s mind buzzed. This news caught him off guard. For a leader like song Qiming, the possibility of a car accident was too low.

However, it was not the time to ask for details. He quickly asked,””Wei Wei, where are you now? I’ll come and take you to the airport immediately!”

“I’m at school ... I checked the flights, the earliest one will take off in three hours ...”Song Wei said while sobbing.

“I’ll make the arrangements, you don’t have to worry about it!” Xia ruofei said,”wait for me at the north gate of the school now! I’ll be there immediately!”

“Alright!” Song Wei said.

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei immediately said to Wu Qiang, who was driving,””Wu Qiang, go to the north gate of Capital University!”

“Okay, boss!” Wu Qiang said.

He could hear Xia ruofei talking on the phone but he did not know what song Wei said. He only knew that something had happened.

Out of professional habit, Wu Qiang did not ask much. He quickly turned the car around at the next intersection and drove in the direction of Capital University.

Xia ruofei called the cabin crew from the car.

“Captain Liu, I’m Xia ruofei!” Xia ruofei said directly,”I have something urgent to attend to and need to return to the three mountains immediately. What’s the earliest time you can take off?”

Now, Xia ruofei was glad that he did not let the flight crew return to the three mountains but had them wait for orders in the capital. Otherwise, they would have been delayed even longer.

“Mr. Xia, two of our flight attendants have gone to the suburbs ...” Liu An was stunned for a moment.

The flight crew had been on standby in the capital city for the past few days. They could not stay in the hotel all the time. After all, if Xia ruofei wanted to use the plane, he would usually inform him in advance. Hence, Liu An agreed to let the two flight attendants go to the hot springs in the suburbs without much hesitation.

He didn’t expect Xia ruofei to use the plane at such a time, and in such a hurry.

If he asked them to come back at this time, with the traffic conditions in the capital, it would probably take at least two hours.

“It’s fine if they’re not here! It won’t affect my flight!” Xia ruofei said,”it’s fine as long as you and Captain Zheng are here! Captain Liu, just tell me, how long will it take to complete the flight preparation and route application?”

Liu An quickly calculated and said,””Director Xia, Captain Zheng and I have no problems with the flight preparations. We also have some special channels to apply for a flight route. If it’s an emergency request, we should be able to settle it within an hour.”

Xia ruofei said,”okay, then I’ll have to trouble you to get ready!” I’m on my way to the airport now!”

Xia ruofei thought that if it took too long for Liu An to apply for a flight route, he would have to use the connections of the song family to contact the Air Force and get special approval. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

However, since Liu An promised that he could finish it within an hour, there was no need to do so.

After all, it would take at least an hour for him to pick up Song Wei from Capital University and then go to the airport.

“Understood!” Liu An said immediately.

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei called Qin Yanan and told her that he had something urgent to attend to and had to go back to Sanshan immediately. He asked her and he Yu to take a civil flight back later, or they could just wait for orders in the capital. No matter how the matter at Sanshan was handled, Xia ruofei would definitely have to come back to the capital. The treatment for old master Liu was only half done.

Qin Yanan didn’t even think about it and chose to return to the three mountains. Xia ruofei was the target of their small team’s service guarantee. If Xia ruofei was no longer in the capital, there was no point in her and he Yu staying in the capital.

Xia ruofei didn’t want to dwell on such a small matter, so he agreed immediately. He told Qin Yanan to book a plane ticket back home. Yueyue was in a hurry, so she definitely wouldn’t wait for them.

After making the call, Xia ruofei thought of informing the Liu family as well. Although the pills could last for a week, he had to stop the acupuncture that was done once every three days.

He dialed Liu Qunfeng’s number.

Liu Qunfeng quickly picked it up and said enthusiastically,””Mr. Xia!”

“Chief Liu, I have something urgent to attend to and need to return to San Shan immediately!” Xia ruofei went straight to the point.”Stop elder Liu’s acupuncture for now. Just let him take his medicine normally.”

“No, Mr. Xia,” Liu Qunfeng quickly said. The old man’s condition has finally improved, you can’t leave at this time!”

Xia ruofei said impatiently,””Chief Liu, I have something urgent to attend to! Don’t worry, it won’t delay the treatment! Besides, he hadn’t finished the medicine for this course of treatment. I’ll definitely be back within a week no matter how things are handled. ”

“Mr. Xia, but ... Without acupuncture, will the effect ...” Liu Qunfeng said.

“I’m a doctor, and I know elder Liu’s condition the best. He won’t be affected. ” Xia ruofei said decisively.

“The problem is ... You’re not in the capital. What if something happens to the old man?” Liu Qunfeng said,”when the time comes, we’ll have no one to help us, right?”

In fact, this was what Liu Qunfeng was most worried about. They wanted to tie Xia ruofei to old master Liu and keep him by his side. Now that Xia ruofei visited every three days, they felt uneasy. However, Xia ruofei had a close relationship with the song family, and they relied on Xia ruofei to treat old master Liu, so they did not dare to force Xia ruofei to do something he did not want to do.

However, no matter what, Xia ruofei was still in the capital. If anything happened, they would be able to rush over immediately. If Xia ruofei were to return to the three mountains, they would not be able to call for help in time if something happened to the old man!

Xia ruofei frowned.”Chief Liu, I’m very clear about elder Liu’s situation. I’m also very confident that nothing unexpected will happen.”

Xia ruofei knew very well that as long as elder Liu took the pill according to plan, the cancer cell activity in his body would be suppressed and there would be no accidents.

Of course, if it was a sudden illness of some other elderly person, such as myocardial infarction or cerebral hemorrhage, it would be hard to say. After all, the medicinal properties of the spirit Heart Flower petals were not enough to deal with cancer cells, and it was impossible to further improve elder Liu’s physique.

However, the Liu family had so many medical staff, so it wasn’t as difficult to deal with sudden diseases as they had imagined.

“Mr. Xia, what’s so urgent that you have to leave my father behind and rush back?” Liu Qunfeng asked. We have an agreement, and we’ve also paid the consultation fee ...”

Xia ruofei was instantly displeased. He asked coldly,””Chief Liu, I don’t think I signed an Indenture! Is your Liu family going to restrict my personal freedom?”
