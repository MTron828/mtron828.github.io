Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei had a good impression of the bold Zhao Yongjun. He stood up and greeted him with a smile,””Brother Zhao, I heard that you’ve already returned home. I’m really sorry to call you out again!”

Zhao Yongjun patted Xia ruofei’s shoulder heavily and pretended to be unhappy.””What are you saying! If it wasn’t for your miraculous hand of rejuvenation, my dad might have retired by now! On the way back, my dad told me to thank you properly!”

“Hahaha! It’s nothing, you’re too kind, uncle Zhao!” Xia ruofei said,”brother Zhao, come in and sit!”

After a while, the people invited by song Rui arrived one after another.

Many of them had already met Xia ruofei at elder song’s birthday party. They did not feel any sense of superiority when they saw Xia ruofei. They were all very polite.

Even those who were not qualified to attend the birthday banquet saw that Xia ruofei was the focus of the crowd when they arrived at the private room. Even Zhao Yongjun and Liu Jian, the sons of the rich families, were polite to him. These people did not dare to neglect him and quickly came over to greet him with enthusiasm.

Soon, everyone was present. Song Rui arranged for everyone to sit at the table. Song Rui, Zhao Yongjun, and the others insisted that Xia ruofei sit at the main seat. Xia ruofei knew that he was the star of the night, so he sat down after a few words of rejection.

After everyone was seated, song Rui raised his glass and said,””Those who are here today are all my good friends. Everyone knows the person beside me. My grandfather admires ruofei very much and ruofei and I are like real brothers. I’ll formally introduce him to everyone today!”

Xia ruofei also smiled and stood up with his glass.””You’re all good friends of song Rui, so you’re also good friends of me, Xia ruofei. Let’s not talk more. I’ll give you a toast first!”

The guests at the birthday banquet naturally knew how important Xia ruofei was to elder song. The others were also smart and naturally knew what he meant. They raised their glasses and spoke very politely.

Then, song Rui brought two more glasses of wine.

After the three glasses, everyone started to toast to each other. Xia ruofei was the star of the day, so he had the most people toasting him.

Song Rui introduced Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but click his tongue. The people who came today were all rich and powerful people from all walks of life. Their fathers were all important figures in major ministries, large state – owned enterprises, and people’s groups.

Song Rui’s intention was obvious. He wanted to bring Xia ruofei into their circle and help Xia ruofei build up a huge network.

One of them was a lean young man. Song Rui even mentioned him,””Ruofei, his name is Hou Liang. He’s the son of director hou of the SARFT. He was the one who helped you with that little artiste’s matter a few days ago. He’s pretty good!”

“Thank you, young master hou!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Hou Liang quickly waved his hand and said,”brother Xia, you’re making me feel bad!” It’s just a small matter. It’s my honor to be able to help Brother Xia! Young master Song and the others all call me monkey. If you don’t mind, you can call me that too!”

Hou Liang’s father was the executive Deputy Chief of the SARFT. In the eyes of ordinary people, he was naturally a high – ranking official with great power. However, in the eyes of people like song Rui, he was a little lacking. Which family wasn’t from an important Ministry to be invited by song Rui tonight?

Even Hou Liang’s father was not qualified to attend elder song’s birthday banquet. The reason why Hou Liang was invited by song Rui today was mainly because he had helped Xia ruofei with something two days ago.

Therefore, when he heard Xia ruofei call him young master hou, Hou Liang was terrified.

Xia ruofei smiled gently and said,””Good! Houzi, let’s have a drink!”

Hou Liang instantly felt flattered. He hurriedly bowed and lowered his glass. After clinking glasses with Xia ruofei, he immediately raised his head and finished the Maotai in his glass.

“Brother Xia, I’ll drink first as a form of respect. Please do as you wish!” Hou Liang said as he showed Xia ruofei the bottom of his cup.

Xia ruofei smiled and finished the wine in his glass in one gulp. Xuxu could be said to be able to drink thousands of glasses without getting drunk. He would not drink a small glass casually. These rich Playboys loved their face the most. In a situation where their status was equal or even slightly higher, if you gave them face, they would think that you were worth befriending.

As expected, Hou Liang instantly felt proud. He said,”Thank you, brother Xia, for coming!”

Then, Hou Liang said in a low voice,”brother Xia, that little artiste called Dong Siyu doesn’t know what’s good for her. Do you want me to get someone to pass a message to her?” To let her serve brother Xia well?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile wryly. This group of nouveau riches were all jackals of the same lair. Hou Liang’s thoughts were exactly the same as song Rui ‘s.

Why was it that he couldn’t stand that small star and banned her, but he had to fall for her beauty?

Song Rui couldn’t help but laugh.

Xia ruofei glared at him and said,””Monkey, don’t bother yourself with this. I’m not interested in Dong Siyu at all. Just ban her and make sure she can’t work in the entertainment industry anymore. Consider it a lesson for her. There’s no need for her to do anything else.”

Only then did Hou Liang realize that he had misunderstood. He chuckled awkwardly and said,”I know, brother Xia!”

The rich Playboys came over to toast Xia ruofei, and he did not reject them. He drank until his glass was empty, as if he could never get drunk, which made the rich Playboys admire him. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎
