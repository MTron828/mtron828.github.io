2901 Decisive killing (2)

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”You know quite a lot! However, I’m not a sword immortal ... Alright, I’ve stayed here for a long time, so I’ll leave the rest to you!”

With that, Xia ruofei willed the blue travel immortal sword to carry him away from the yacht.

Charlie quickly dug into his pocket as he shouted,””Divine immortal, this is my contact information, please accept it! Charlie will never forget the kindness of saving his life! I hope that in the future, I’ll have the honor to share the burden with you, Daoist immortal!”

Charlie was thinking that this Eastern sword immortal probably didn’t care about worldly things like money. However, if the great divine immortal had some troubles in the secular world that he didn’t want to deal with, then he would have the opportunity to share the burden with the great divine immortal.

From Charlie’s point of view, it was an extremely rare opportunity to be able to establish a connection with such a magical Eastern immortal. Not to mention that he had received such a great favor today, even his life was saved by the divine immortal. He also sincerely hoped that one day, he could repay the divine immortal in an appropriate way.

However, Charlie found that after he finished speaking, Lord Divine immortal’s figure had become very small. It was obvious that he had flown so far away in an instant. He had to open his eyes wide to see the flying figure in the sky with the faint moonlight.

Charlie held a business card made of pure gold in his hand and stood in the cold wind, feeling lost.

At this time, an invisible force came and rolled up the name card in his hand, flying in the direction where the divine immortal had left.

At the same time, Charlie heard the voice of the deity from earlier. “I’ll keep your business card. I’ll contact you if I need it.”

Charlie’s dejection turned into ecstasy. He quickly shouted,””Yes! Thank you, Daoist immortal! You ... You take care ...”

In the end, he really didn’t know what to say. In his agitated mood, he finally forced out the two words,”take care.”

The Daoist immortal no longer made any sound, and his figure quickly disappeared into the night.

Flight, telekinesis, long – distance flying sword ... All of these mystical techniques shook Charlie’s heart.

Before today, he had never thought that the magical Immortals in Huaxia’s myths and legends actually existed in reality.

Seeing all of this with his own eyes today had truly exceeded his understanding.

Charlie stood in front of the deck railing and looked in the direction where Xia ruofei had disappeared. After a long while, he gathered his thoughts and turned to look at Davis.

Davis ‘pain had been slightly alleviated, mainly because of his strong desire to live. He couldn’t care about the pain in his wrists and ankles for the time being.

When Charlie looked over, Davis quickly revealed a pitiful expression and pleaded,”Charlie ... Brother! I beg you to let me go! I ... I’ve already become a cripple, and I can no longer pose a threat to your position. For the sake of us being brothers, you ...”

The men didn’t dare to say a word. They knew that their lives were in Charlie’s hands, and the most effective way was naturally to beg for Davis’s mercy. As long as Charlie was willing to let Davis go, they would naturally have a chance of survival.

Other than that, there was no other way. A few minutes ago, they were as strong as Bulls. Although the powerful large – caliber pistols were right next to them, they didn’t even have the strength to hold them. After the tendons in their hands were broken, it was impossible for them to raise the guns, let alone aim and shoot.

It could be said that they were now completely lambs waiting to be slaughtered.

Charlie stared at Davis, a strange smile on his face. He asked back,”Brothers? Davis, when you pointed this gun at my forehead and pulled the trigger, did you ever think about us brothers? did you ever think about our parents in heaven?”

As Charlie spoke, he walked over and squatted down to pick up Davis’s gun. He played with the gun in his hand and glanced at Davis with a playful look.

Davis begged with tears and snot,””I ... I was really possessed, I was just confused! Charlie, please don’t hold it against a cripple like me. Just ... Just treat me as a fart and let me go!”

Charlie couldn’t help but burst into laughter. He pointed his pistol at Davis’s forehead and said, “You’re flexible, you’re my good brother! Why didn’t I see it before? Oh! Right, you always act like you’re not scheming at all in front of me, and you’re also very hot – tempered. You can explode at the slightest disagreement, and you’re completely the image of a brainless rich second – generation heir ... Which one is the real you?”

Davis couldn’t help but be at a loss for words. He had indeed disguised himself very well in the past, so much so that Charlie basically didn’t have his guard up against him.

Based on his previous personality, even if a gun was pointed at his head, he would not have begged for mercy like this.

Charlie stood up and picked up a rope from the deck. He looked at the rope that they had used to tie up the corpse. There were still a few left.

Davis quickly moved his body in vain, trying to distance himself from Charlie. He shouted,”Charlie, what are you doing?”

Charlie easily tied Davis’s legs together and at the same time tied them to the deck railing as he said, “Don’t be afraid. Even if I want to kill you, now is not the time ...”He said.

After saying that, Charlie did the same thing and tied up the few big men.

They did not have any ability to resist and could only watch as Charlie tied them up like rice dumplings.

Charlie picked up two guns from the ground and said,””Please wait patiently. I’ll go to the cockpit to take a look.”

After that, he walked to the cockpit at the other end of the yacht with the gun in his hand. As he walked, he removed the silencer from the gun and threw it on the deck.

As they walked up the ramp to the third floor of the deck, Charlie turned around and smiled at Davis. The smile made Davis’s hair stand on end, and he could not help but shiver.

After a while, Davis and the others heard a few muffled gunshots from the cockpit.

Every shot seemed to hit their hearts, making them tremble.

The few big men were especially dejected. It was obvious that Charlie had already shot the few of their accomplices in the cockpit, so they would definitely be next.

If it was said that Davis, as Charlie’s brother, still had a chance to save his life, then these burly men, who had personally killed so many crew members, had the same status as the few people on duty in the cockpit. Since Charlie had killed the people in the cockpit, there was no reason to keep them alive.

After a while, Charlie’s figure appeared on the third floor of the deck.

In the eyes of Davis and the others, the current Charlie was simply the embodiment of Satan. Perhaps it was the fear in his heart, or perhaps it was because Charlie had just killed someone, but in the eyes of Davis and the others, Charlie’s body seemed to have an additional bloodthirsty and bloody smell.

Charlie walked down the ramp briskly and came to the second – Floor deck.

“Mr. Charlie, please spare me ...” One of the burly men could not hold back the fear in his heart and could not help but beg for mercy.

Charlie did not say anything. He raised his gun and killed the burly man who was begging for mercy. The shot was very accurate. The burly man only grunted and then stopped breathing.

“Looks like I didn’t pay the membership fee for the shooting club for nothing!” Charlie said with a smile.

Then, under the despairing gazes of the remaining few burly men, Charlie killed them all, one by one.

“This scene is so similar!” Charlie sighed.”Half an hour ago, this was how you treated the innocent staff and the lovely hetherlin ...”

After saying this, Charlie turned his gaze to Davis ...Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com
