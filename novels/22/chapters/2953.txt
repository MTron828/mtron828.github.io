As the saying goes, pulling one hair will affect the whole body. This was also the case for formations. A small change could cause a huge chain reaction.

In a short while, Xia ruofei had finished carving the array pattern. Then, he used his finger as a knife and carved three grooves on the surface of the main array talisman, connecting all the array patterns together.

Since the spirit stones were cut to a standard size, the grooves for embedding the spirit stones were all of the same size.

Next, Xia ruofei made the necessary changes to the eight small supplementary talismans in the set of talismans. This was much easier as there were very few changes.

It took him almost ten seconds to finish modifying one. After a minute or two, he put down the last auxiliary array talisman and said with a smile,””Done! Let’s try the effect! Qingfeng, can I borrow three spirit stones?”

Luo Qingfeng and Li Yifu were both stunned. Li Yifu was fine, but Luo Qingfeng had seen a lot. When he was young, he had the honor of watching his seniors carve talismans, but he had never seen someone like Xia ruofei who could do it so easily and so naturally. This was the first time he had seen someone inscribe talismans so easily.

Xia ruofei’s words brought Luo Qingfeng back to his senses. He quickly said,””Yes! Master!”

Then, Luo Qingfeng immediately took out three spiritual stones from his storage ring and handed them to Xia ruofei with both hands.

After Xia ruofei took the spiritual stones, he threw out a few talismans and set up a barrier in the room. Once the spiritual energy gathering formation was activated, it would absorb the surrounding spiritual energy. Golden core stage cultivators would be very sensitive to the fluctuations of spiritual energy in the surroundings, which could attract other people’s attention.

The barrier isolated the spiritual energy from the outside. The spirit gathering array could only absorb the spiritual energy in the room, so no one outside could sense any fluctuations.

Although the effect of the spirit gathering array would be much weaker, Xia ruofei was just testing it out. He did not need to activate the spirit gathering array completely, so it was enough.

After Xia ruofei had set up the barrier, he skillfully set up a spirit gathering array around the three of them.

Then, Xia ruofei waved his hand and three spiritual stones flew out. They accurately fell into the three grooves on the main array talisman. He had carved the grooves very accurately and the spiritual stones fit perfectly.

Once the spiritual stone was in place, Xia ruofei did not even need to use his spiritual power to activate it. The spiritual gathering array was activated immediately.

Xia ruofei and the other two, who were in the spirit gathering array, could clearly feel the spiritual Qi starting to gather. However, as the spiritual Qi in the room was limited, it soon became difficult to continue.

Even so, the effect of the spirit gathering array had already been verified.

Xia ruofei roughly estimated that after the upgrade, the efficiency of the spirit gathering formation had increased by at least 20%. And this was a conservative estimate.

Xia ruofei was very satisfied. He laughed and said, “I’ll take this! I should be able to sell it for a good price tomorrow!”

With that, Xia ruofei waved his hand and kept the spirit gathering talisman.

After the spirit gathering array was removed, the spirit Qi that had gathered earlier began to slowly dissipate again. Finally, the spirit Qi concentration in the room returned to the same level as the outside world.

Xia ruofei then removed the barrier.

He handed the talisman to Luo Qingfeng and said,””Qingfeng, I’ll give you this set of spirit gathering talismans. Tomorrow, bring it to the fallen leaves sect and add it to the auction.”

“Yes! Master!” Luo Qingfeng quickly said,”the effect of this array is very good. It’s a rare quality even among the spirit – gathering array talismans!” Even I can’t help but want to buy it, so I’m sure the people from the other sects will be very interested!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”if you want it, I’ll find some time to make a set for you!” I’ll keep this set for spirit stones!”

“Master,” Luo Qingfeng quickly said,”I’m just making an analogy. I don’t really want this set of talismans.” The star Seizer sect’s cultivation environment isn’t bad, so there’s no need for you to waste your time and effort to specially inscribe talismans for this old servant!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”we’ll talk about it later!” To me, carving a set of elementary level talismans like this isn’t too much of an effort. It’s quite easy ...”

From Xia ruofei’s point of view, these small talismans were not difficult at all. He felt that the ones that were more complicated, such as the array disc that was drawn to activate the Taixu xuanqing array. What was even more difficult, which Xia ruofei had not been able to complete so far, were the various formations that were required to make the spiritual puppet. In comparison, the spirit gathering talisman could only be considered a child’s play.

“Thank you, master!” Luo Qingfeng could only say.”I’ll thank you on behalf of the disciples of the sect!”

Even if Luo Qingfeng had the spirit – gathering array talisman, he would not be able to use it himself. It was mainly for the low – Level disciples of the star Seizer sect to use. Don’t look down on this set of spirit gathering talismans, as time passes, it will be very useful for the cultivation of low level disciples, and those Qi layer disciples are the foundation of the sect, maybe there will be a genius among them who will break through to the jiedan stage, making the influence of the sect rise by a lot.

Of course, even Luo Qingfeng had become Xia ruofei’s servant. Strictly speaking, the star Seizer sect was Xia ruofei’s own power. It was not a big deal for him to provide some cultivation resources. Moreover, it was not a big deal.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””In order to gather as many spirit stones as possible, I’ll auction off three more protective talismans in addition to this spirit gathering talisman.”

As Xia ruofei spoke, he took out three Jade talismans from the spirit map space and lined them up on the coffee table.

He said,”these three protective array talismans can be used individually, so you just have to wear them on your body.” Each protective talisman can block at least three attacks from a Qi Level 7 cultivator. It doesn’t need to be activated by spiritual power, and when it’s attacked, it will automatically activate the protective shield. ”

This type of talisman was even simpler than a complete set of spirit gathering talismans. When Xia ruofei had just started cultivating, he had made similar talismans and even gave them to people around him.

However, he had made these three talismans when he had the time. With Xia ruofei’s current cultivation and understanding of arrays, the protective talismans he made were naturally much better than the ones he had made before.

He had originally wanted to give it to Ling Qingxue, Song Wei, and Li Yifu for self – defense. After all, their cultivation levels were relatively low. If they were to encounter an enemy cultivator and he was not by their side, they might be in danger.

However, he had rushed to Shuangqing this time and had forgotten to pass it to Song Wei and the others. This time, he had taken it out to auction in exchange for spirit stones.

In any case, it was a very easy task for him to make this kind of jade talisman. He could just find some time to make a few more after the auction. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Luo Qingfeng’s eyes lit up and he said,””Master, this is good stuff! The higher – ups of those sects must have some trusted disciples, so this kind of talisman is most suitable for their disciples to protect themselves. It should be in high demand!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””I think so too! I’ll keep you for now and submit you to the auction tomorrow! Try to auction it before the storage ring, so that we can have an idea of how many spirit stones we can take out. Then we’ll have the confidence to bid for the storage ring!”

If he didn’t have enough spiritual stones, he could pay with spiritual crystals, which was much more popular than spiritual stones. However, Xia ruofei was not willing to use spiritual crystals unless he had no other choice.

“Yes! Master!” Luo Qingfeng did as he was told and kept the three protective array talismans in his storage ring.

He knew that Xia ruofei had a lot of treasures on him and was curious about what Xia ruofei would bring out for the auction. When Xia ruofei really brought out one treasure after another, he could not help but be speechless.

Whether it was the Qi gathering pill, the spirit gathering talisman, or the protective talisman, they were all very practical things for cultivators. Especially in the current situation where the cultivation environment was deteriorating, these auxiliary treasures were even more precious.

These were just things that Xia ruofei had casually taken out. Especially from Xia ruofei’s tone, it seemed that he had refined the Qi gathering pill himself and modified the spirit gathering talisman on the spot. He must have also made the protective talisman himself. In other words, as long as Xia ruofei wanted to, he could have as many of these things as he wanted!

Luo Qingfeng suddenly felt that following a master like Xia ruofei seemed to have a much better future than being the sect master of the star Seizer sect in the past ...
