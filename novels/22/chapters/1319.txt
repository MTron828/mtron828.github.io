Chapter 1320: The sincerity of Tongren Hall (2)

Translator: 549690339

Tang weiran suddenly understood. At the same time, he paid more attention to Xia ruofei’s “brother Lin”.

A kind smile appeared on Tang Wei Ran’s face. She took the initiative to reach out to Lin Zhongming and said,””You’re comrade Zhongming! I’ve heard of your name a few times in the capital. You were an expert in business at the Qiantang shop! You were the one who facilitated the cooperation with the Paradise Corporation on the tin can maple, am I right?”

Lin Zhongming quickly extended his hands and shook Tang weiran’s hand. Then, he said humbly,””You’re too kind, President Tang! That’s my job!”

Lin Zhongming looked at Xia ruofei gratefully. He could tell that Xia ruofei was trying to save his face.

“President Tang, big brother Lin, let’s go in and talk!” Xia ruofei laughed.

The group then walked into the conference room and took their seats.

After Tang Wei Ran sat down, she immediately said with a sincere expression,””President Xia, first of all, I would like to apologize to you and your company! Because of a few employees, there was a misunderstanding between the two sides, and even the cooperation was put on hold. This is the negligence of the group’s leaders!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”President Tang, you’re being too serious. It’s just business!” It’s normal for there to be disagreements in negotiations ...”

The more Tang weiran heard, the more she felt that something was wrong. Xia ruofei was being so generous. Was he not going to pursue the matter? However, Xia ruofei did not have such an attitude before he entered the room!

Just as Tang weiran was worried, Xia ruofei suddenly said,””It’s not necessarily a bad thing that we didn’t come to an agreement with Tongren Hall. I’m still confident in the competitiveness of our company’s products. I believe that the traditional time – honored brands such as henian Hall, Changchun Hall, and Huichun Hall will be very interested in our company’s Ironhide maples and Cordyceps. We’ve also been actively contacting these potential partner pharmacies in the past two days. In fact, we didn’t lose much in business, so President Tang doesn’t have to apologize ...”

Tang Wei Ran broke out in a cold sweat after hearing this. He quickly said,””President Xia, our Tongren Hall still places great importance on our business partner, Tao Yuan company. After the group’s Chairman, comrade Wei Jianming, heard about this matter, he personally instructed the discipline Inspection department to start an investigation and sent me to represent the group to continue discussing the cooperation with your company. President Xia, please consider continuing to cooperate with our Tongren Hall ...”

Xia ruofei had already gotten the information from Zhao Yongjun and knew the purpose of Tang weiran’s trip. He smiled and said,””President Tang, it doesn’t matter which company we work with. In addition to benefits, we value long – term cooperation more. In the past, brother Lin and I worked together quite happily on the sales of iron dukedom!”

Tang weiran smiled bitterly in her heart. Xia ruofei’s words were already very obvious.

His previous cooperation with Lin Zhongming had always been very pleasant. This time, the cooperation with aweto was basically just lacking a signature. If it wasn’t for the issue of authority, Lin Zhongming would have already returned to Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province with a bright performance.

Now, the situation had completely changed, and it was only because of Chen shun alone.

It seemed that if he didn’t show his sincerity and deal with Chen shun seriously, this negotiation wouldn’t be able to continue.

And this matter couldn’t be delayed. Didn’t Xia ruofei just say it? They had already gotten in touch with the strong competitors of Tongren Hall, such as the year of the crane Hall. The longer they dragged on, the more likely it would be for changes to happen.

Tang weiran didn’t think that Xia ruofei was bluffing, because he had gotten the exact news from Wei Jianming that Xia ruofei might turn to work with the year of the crane Hall.

After a moment of silence, he said,””President Xia, please wait for a moment. I’ll go out and make a call ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and gestured for her to go ahead.””Please go ahead, President Tang!”

Tang Wei Ran walked out of the meeting room and immediately made a phone call to the capital to ask about the results of the secret investigation.

In fact, this matter was very simple, and it could be found out without much effort.

The results of the investigation showed that Chen shun was sent by Chen Weinan, the Vice President of the chain company. He was sent very urgently without going through the company’s collective meeting.

The family relationship between Chen shun and Chen Weinan was no secret at all.

After Tang weiran understood the situation, she called Lin Zhongming out and asked kindly,””Comrade Zhongming, there’s something I’d like to know from you. Can you tell me the details of Chen shun’s involvement in the negotiation?”

Lin Zhongming had been angry with Chen shun for a long time. Although he was not clear about the current situation, he had seen Tang weiran’s attitude towards Xia ruofei.

Therefore, Lin Zhongming didn’t have any scruples. He directly appointed Chen shun to take over the negotiations, and then deliberately put on airs during the negotiations. He even offered a price that was far lower than the actual value of the purchase, and so on. He told him everything in detail.

Tang weiran’s face became uglier and uglier after she heard it.

Naturally, he could easily analyze that Chen Weinan had sent his nephew to pick the peaches. If the negotiation was successful, this cooperation would definitely be signed in the name of a chain company with paradise Corporation. At that time, Lin Zhongming would have nothing to do with it, and all the performance would belong to Chen shun. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

However, what Tang weiran didn’t understand was why Chen shun did such a simple task. Was this guy an idiot?

However, Tang weiran didn’t want to know why. He gently said to Lin Zhongming,””Comrade Zhongming, I understand the situation. I’m sorry for making you suffer this time! Don’t worry, the group won’t let this kind of evil spread. We’ll definitely deal with those with ulterior motives seriously!”

“Thank you, President Tang!” Lin Zhongming said with some excitement.

Tang weiran asked Lin Zhongming to return to the meeting room first. He called Wei Jianming immediately and reported his initial contact with Xia ruofei as well as Chen shun’s situation.

After Wei Jianming heard this, he couldn’t help but slam the table and say, “You’re simply a disgrace to Tongren Hall! If all the business managers below are of such quality, no matter how well we do our development strategy, it will all be a castle in the air!”

“President Wei, I’m responsible for this matter as the leader of the branch. I would like to reflect on my actions ...” Tang Wei Ran said.

“What responsibility do you have?” Wei Jianming interrupted Tang weiran and said,”it’s obvious that a middle – Level leader is ignoring the group’s interests for his own benefit!”

His words were equivalent to a conclusion. Not only would Chen shun be dealt with seriously, but even Chen Weinan would not be able to get away with it.

“President Wei, Mr. Xia probably wants to see our sincerity. Otherwise, the negotiation can’t go on ...” Tang weiran said.

“Yes!” Wei Jianming said without hesitation,”Chen shun will be fired. Chen Weinan has an unshirkable leadership responsibility. We’ll deal with him seriously after the group studies it. Let’s follow this tone and talk to Mr. Xia first!” I’ll talk to the discipline Inspection team and speed up the progress!”

“Understood!” Tang Wei Ran said,”President Wei, I’ll go in first. I’ll report to you as soon as I make any progress.”

“Mm! Thank you for your hard work, Wei Ran!” Wei Jianming said.

“No, no, it’s my duty!” Tang Wei Ran was flattered and quickly said.

After hanging up the phone, Tang weiran returned to the meeting room and said to Xia ruofei,””President Xia, I’ve just contacted the group’s Discipline Inspection department and found comrade Zhongming to understand the situation. The truth is basically clear. The chain company’s individual leaders were trying to seek benefits for their relatives, which led to the whole incident. Our group’s Chairman, comrade Wei Jianming, has personally instructed that Chen shun’s punishment should be severe. The initial decision is to punish and dismiss him. In addition, the chain company’s Deputy General Manager, Chen Weinan, who is responsible for the leadership, should also be investigated immediately. The corporation will deal with it seriously after the research!”
