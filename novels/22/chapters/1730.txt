Chapter 1731: Handling it with ease (3)

Xia ruofei, Zhao Yongjun, song Rui, Liu Jian, and Xu Zixuan came to the grape trellis in the middle of the main courtyard. Everyone was making tea and chatting. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Xia ruofei placed his things in his bedroom and asked,””Brother Zhao, how’s our plot of land?”

During his time in Australia, this was undoubtedly the land that he missed the most.

Initially, Xia ruofei was just doing business with his brothers and was not particularly interested. However, after he confirmed that there was a natural nine turns universe formation on that piece of land, his attitude changed.

This was a great place that cultivators could only dream of! With a little bit of arrangement on top of the formation, it could definitely become a treasured land for cultivation.

“Ruofei, what are you asking about?” Zhao Yongjun asked. If it’s just the procedures, then there’s no problem. We’ve already settled everything, and that land now belongs to our Hengrui company!”

Xia ruofei heaved a sigh of relief. Although this matter was almost set in stone before he left the country, Zhao Yongjun and the others were still going through the procedures when he left. As long as the procedures were not completed, this treasured land would not really belong to them, and there might be changes.

“That’s good!” Xia ruofei said,”brother Zhao, you’ve all worked hard these few days!”

Zhao Yongjun smiled.”Other than the procedures, everything else ... Is the same as before you left the country. There’s no progress at all!”

“Other aspects?” Xia ruofei asked, stunned.

“Yeah!” Zhao Yongjun shrugged. The design company was supposed to go to the site for an on – site survey and make some preliminary preparations for the construction, but they haven’t done anything yet. ”

“What’s wrong?” Xia ruofei asked,”could there be any flaws in the procedure?”

When song Rui heard this, he was furious and said,””Bullsh * t flaw! RUO Fei, did you forget something?”

Xia ruofei patted his forehead and said with a smile,””Oh ... You’re talking about the formation?”

Zhao Yongjun smiled bitterly,”ruofei, if you didn’t come back soon, I’d really have to go to Australia and kidnap you back ... That land is getting more and more strange!” No one dares to come near during the day, and it’s even gloomier at night. There’s also a lot of strange noises coming from there. I heard that the residents nearby drive away from that area at night!”

Xia ruofei said nonchalantly,”it’s normal. Formations will gather Yin Qi. People like song Rui, who have been drained by alcohol and women, are especially susceptible to it ...”

“You’re the one who’s been hollowed out by wine and women!” Song Rui was so angry that his face was red and his neck was rough.

Zhao Yongjun looked worried and said,””RUO Fei, after being delayed for so many days, will it be difficult for you to deal with it? This matter can’t be delayed any longer. There are more and more rumors about that land in the outside world now, and they can’t be suppressed!”

“What’s even more infuriating is that Liu er laughed at us every day, saying that there’s a big problem with that land. We became the scapegoats ...”Song Rui added.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”This Liu haofan lost such a huge sum of money and transferred the land to us at a discount. He still has the face to publicize it?”

“Isn’t there a big problem with that piece of land?” Zhao Yongjun said,”everyone in the industry is saying that we’ve been cheated!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”who’s the fool here?” Don’t we know? Don’t worry, big brother Zhao! I’m going to deal with that formation tomorrow! By then, we can start the follow – up work!”
