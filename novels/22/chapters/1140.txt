Chapter 1141: Negative emotional quotient (3)

Translator: 549690339

In his opinion, MA Xiong would have been deceived by this cunning young man if he was not there.

Liang Chongshan didn’t say anything, but Zhao Yongjun was furious. He took out his phone and looked for a number.””RUO Fei, aren’t you just asking for trouble? I’m not selling this King’s Green square card! I’ll contact my friend at the auction house for you. I don’t believe that without butcher Liang, we’ll have to eat pigs with hair? If this King’s Green square card is sold for less than 150 million, I’ll cut my head off for you to kick around like a ball!”

Xia ruofei looked at the haughty Liang Chongshan and could not help but shake his head. However, he quickly said,””Forget it, brother Zhao. Since I’ve already spoken to Mr. MA, let’s just let them see it first! You still have to check if the vegetables are fresh when you buy them in the supermarket! Such a valuable item must be inspected. Let whoever old master Ma wants to inspect the goods do it!”

Of course, Xia ruofei was giving MA Xiong face. As for Liang Zhongshan, Xia ruofei also hated him.

“You ...” Zhao Yongjun shook his head and put away his phone,”you’re just too good – tempered ... Okay! Let’s show them first!”

“Thank you for your understanding, Xia Sheng,” MA Xiong said gratefully.

Xia ruofei smiled slightly and did not say anything to tease him that he only had some friendship with the MA family. However, he did not have any good feelings towards Liang Chongshan. He did not know where this old man had lived to, his emotional intelligence was basically zero!

MA Xiong glared at Liang Chongshan and said,”Old Liang, if you want to see, then go!”

Liang Chongshan snorted and walked to the coffee table. He glanced at Xia ruofei and Zhao Yongjun with a hint of intimidation, then carefully opened the paper box.

Although Liang Chongshan was sure that the Jade inside was fake, he still didn’t dare to take it lightly. If the Jade was broken in his hands, he wouldn’t be able to explain himself. The other party was worried about not being able to cheat him of his money! Wouldn’t he be blamed for it?

In fact, Liang Chongshan was being too narrow – minded. Xia ruofei did not let his guard down. He was not far from Liang Chongshan and his spiritual power was constantly in a state of release. If Liang Chongshan really lost, he would definitely be able to protect this precious King’s Green square plate at the first moment.

Liang Chongshan had a disdainful look on his face as he looked at the Jade in the box.

Liang Chongshan’s eyes narrowed slightly when he saw the king’s Green square tile. He looked hesitant.

In his opinion, the workmanship of this square card could almost be mistaken for the real one, but he still stubbornly believed that it couldn’t be real, so he subconsciously wanted to find a flaw in this Emperor green square card. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Liang Chongshan snorted softly. He took out a magnifying glass and a strong flashlight that he carried with him. At the same time, he put on white gloves very professionally and picked up the square card gently.

Xia ruofei looked on quietly with a calm smile on his face. Zhao Yongjun and song Rui crossed their arms and stared at Liang Chongshan with a cold smile.

Liang Chongshan was very serious in his inspection. He observed almost millimeter by millimeter, and from time to time, he would shine a strong flashlight on various parts of the square card.

However, as time passed, Liang Chongshan’s expression became more and more serious. He was also muttering in his heart that he felt that the level of “forgery” of this large square card was very high. He could not find any flaws at all.

Under everyone’s gaze, Liang Chongshan also felt the pressure.

A thought uncontrollably grew in his mind. Could it be that this large square tablet was real? But ... How could there be such a perfect King’s Green jade?

Liang Chongshan’s forehead started to sweat.
