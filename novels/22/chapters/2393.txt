2394 Human lives are as cheap as grass (3)

Xia ruofei started the Ford SUV again and headed west.

Although the car’s Windows were all shattered and there were holes in all sides, the sound of the wind filled their ears as the car drove on. However, as a cultivator, this little bit of wind did not affect them at all. Xia ruofei directly increased the throttle to the maximum. The car whistled as it sped on the simple road, stirring up dust along the way.

Along the way, Xia ruofei was very quiet. He had not recovered from his emotions yet.

Speaking of which, Xia ruofei had seen blood on the battlefield and his mental strength was much stronger than the average person. However, when he saw the hellish scene in the coffee shop, he was still shocked.

The quiet town was instantly filled with cries and screams. The strong contrast made Xia ruofei feel that peace was hard to come by.

When he was living in China, this feeling was not very strong. But when he came to this war – torn country, Xia ruofei deeply felt the preciousness of a peaceful environment in China.

In the war – torn zones, human lives were as cheap as grass. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei drove for a few hundred kilometers without a word. From dawn to dusk, he did not stop for a rest.

The closer they got to the war zone, the more tense the situation became.

Xia ruofei saw a lot of people fleeing along the way, but there were very few cars that drove in the opposite direction like him.

Along the way, they passed by a few checkpoints set up by the government forces. Tony’s identification documents were complete and he was a reporter, so the government forces did not make things difficult for Xia ruofei. They only warned him that the battle area was very dangerous and that he had to be careful of his personal safety.

There were many war journalists active in vadira, and it was not the first time the soldiers had seen them. They knew that these journalists were not afraid of death, and it was useless to persuade them to stay away from the war zone.

In the afternoon, Xia ruofei could already feel the tension in the situation. The government forces and anti – Government armed forces in this area were at odds with each other, and the small – scale battles had never stopped.

At the most dangerous moment, a rocket landed less than a hundred meters in front of his car.

Xia ruofei’s strong spiritual power and keen sense of danger allowed him to step on the brakes in advance to slow down. If he drove at a normal speed, he might be hit by the rocket.

As a refinement stage cultivator, he was still far from being powerful enough to ignore the attacks of hot weapons. Large – caliber firearms, rocket missiles, high – Energy bombs ... Any one of them was enough to take the life of a low – Level cultivator.

Hence, Xia ruofei did not dare to delay. He even summoned the spirit painting scroll from his body and stuffed it into the pocket of his overalls.

This way, with his current reaction speed, even if he encountered an attack he couldn’t resist, he would have enough time to hide in space.

Other than the fleeing crowd, the stern – looking soldiers, and the sounds of gunfire from afar, there was an even more shocking scene. After entering the battle zone, Xia ruofei saw the corpses lying on the ground more than once.

It was unknown how these people died. They might have been hit by stray bullets, robbed, or even killed by the government forces. However, the war situation was tense, and no one had the time to deal with them, so their bodies were left in the wilderness.

Due to the bad road conditions and the frequent stops, Xia ruofei had only driven less than 400 kilometers in a day.

The handheld GPS showed that they were more than 300 kilometers away from the POTA region. Xia ruofei decided to make a break and travel through the night.
