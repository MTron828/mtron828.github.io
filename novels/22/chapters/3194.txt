3195 It’s actually a music score?_

“That’s right!” Chen Xuan nodded his head slowly.”The probability is indeed extremely low ... Brother Xia, this means that we’ve found the right path this time!”

Xia ruofei laughed and replied,”yes!” The problem now is how we can go further on this path until we reach our final goal and obtain the ultimate answer!”

“Fellow Daoist Xia, since the composition is confirmed, shouldn’t we start with the composition?” Liu Mansha smiled and asked in a negotiating tone.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I agree!” Let’s confirm the content of the music as soon as possible, and we might be able to find more clues!”

At this point, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile at Song Wei and said,”Wei Wei is really My Lucky Star! If not for your sudden inspiration, we wouldn’t have thought that this would be a song!”

“I didn’t mean to ... I don’t know what happened just now, but I subconsciously hummed it as a simplified music score,” Song Wei said with a red face.

“Invisible ... Uh, unintentional things are the most awesome!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”this means that you’re fated to play this song! So, you’ll have to put in more effort next! Let’s try to reproduce this song perfectly!”

Song Wei blushed and nodded,”If I can help, I’ll definitely spare no effort!”

Xia ruofei nodded.”Weiwei just hummed the first part of the song. How do you feel?”

Song Wei nodded and said,”actually, I didn’t think too much about it just now. I just followed 1 to 7 to correspond to do to si. Then, I felt that it shouldn’t be completely correct because it was obviously a bit of a mess.”

“Hmm ... We’ll think about this later!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”there are always more solutions than difficulties. Besides, we should have already overcome the most difficult part. The next step is nothing more than trial and error. The workload is not particularly heavy.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Mu Sheng and the others were also very excited. Liu Mansha pondered for a while and said,””Fellow Daoist Xia, let’s study this combination of numbers according to the music score!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”this should be the direction we should focus on!” But ... I think we should go back to the capital first!”

“That’s right!”Chen Xuan nodded. Since we can basically confirm that the answer is correct, we don’t need a supercomputer anymore. It’s not convenient here, so let’s go back to brother Xia’s courtyard house in Beijing!”

In fact, Chen Xuan wanted to return to the first heaven society more. However, he knew that Xia ruofei could not let his guard down completely. It was not appropriate for Xia ruofei to return to the first heaven society, at least not at this stage.

Similarly, if Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha requested to study the combination of numbers at the surging waves sect or the soaring Flower Valley, Chen Xuan would also have some concerns.

Therefore, Xia ruofei’s business in the secular world was the most suitable choice. After all, they didn’t have to worry about their safety or which side was too powerful. Even Xia ruofei, the owner, was the same as everyone else. He was even at a slight disadvantage because of his cultivation and background.

Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha were both people who had experienced many vicissitudes of life. Naturally, they understood the various considerations in this matter after a little hesitation. Therefore, the two of them did not raise any objections and readily agreed.

Hence, Xia ruofei kept his laptop for the time being and contacted the crew members who were still on standby in Xin Wu, asking them to immediately apply for a flight route back to Beijing.

After calling the flight crew, Xia ruofei called Wang Chi’s Ph.D. Student, Feng Xiaoyi, to ask about Wang Chi’s schedule. He found out that Wang Chi was having breakfast on the second floor of the guest house, so Xia ruofei went downstairs to look for him.

In the private room, Cai Songlin, the director of the Supercomputing Center, and some other members of the central team, including Deputy Director Wei, were having breakfast with Wang Chi.

“President Xia! Have you eaten?” Wang Chi asked with a smile after seeing Xia ruofei.

“It was a little easy to deal with!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you’re up early, academician Wang!”

Wang Chi laughed at himself.”When people get older, they sleep less. Nowadays, young people sleep until late in the morning. Only the old people who are about to die get up early!”

Cai Songlin smiled and said,”academician Wang, this is a healthy lifestyle!” It’s not related to age!”

Then, Cai Songlin said to Xia ruofei,””President Xia, I asked someone to treat you to breakfast in the room early in the morning, but since you went to the computer room, I asked the computer room to keep an eye on you. After you’re done with your business, I’ll invite you here for breakfast! These people aren’t working hard. I’ll have to criticize them later!”

Xia ruofei was a guest brought by Wang Chi. Although Xia ruofei had been waiting in the engine room the whole morning for some objective reasons, Cai Songlin still felt that he had not been very hospitable to his guests, especially in front of Wang Chi. He had to show his attitude.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”director Cai, it has nothing to do with our comrades in the computer room. Everyone is tired from work, especially engineer he. He couldn’t even sleep last night and was busy handing over work in the morning. I didn’t want to disturb him, so I quietly returned to the guest house.”

“Mr. Xia, did the program run smoothly last night?” Wang Chi asked.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”the first time wasn’t very smooth. I adjusted the algorithm and ran it again. The result was finally more ideal!” Fortunately, academician Wang, you helped me coordinate the flight time, and my program’s calculation was less than expected. I managed to complete the operation before the flight time ran out!”

Wang Chi revealed a strange expression and said,””So, you adjusted the algorithm program on the spot last night?”

In such a tight time, it was easy to find the parts that needed to be modified in a sea of code and then change the appropriate content. Perhaps a small bug could take a few days for a programmer.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”I was lucky. I found the part that needed to be adjusted immediately. Coincidentally, my train of thought was quite clear too. So, I changed it immediately!”

“Amazing!” Wang Chi could not help but give Xia ruofei a thumbs up.

“By the way,” Xia ruofei said,”academician Wang, what are your plans?”

Wang Chi smiled and said,”my work at new Wu is done. I’ll leave it to you.” If you want to stay in Xin Wu for a few more days or go to other places, I’ll take little Feng back to the capital first. ”

Xia ruofei smiled.”We’re also preparing to return to the capital. Let’s go together!” He said.

Xia ruofei was still worried that Wang Chi had some unfinished business here. They were all in a hurry to go back and continue studying the combination of numbers, so they couldn’t wait here forever. If Wang Chi couldn’t return to the capital today, Xia ruofei would go back first. At most, he would buy a first class ticket for Wang Chi and his teacher.

Since Wang Chi was also preparing to go back, it was the best of both worlds.

At this moment, the flight crew called. After Xia ruofei answered, he smiled and said,””Academician Wang, the flight crew just called. They’re taking off at 10:30 am. Is there anything else you need to do? Will we make it in time?”

Wang Chi chuckled and said,”sure!” Yes! Let’s prepare according to this time!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said,”then I won’t disturb your breakfast! Let’s set off at 9:30, we’ll meet downstairs at the guest house!”
