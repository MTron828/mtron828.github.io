Chapter 3424: A small test of one’s skills (2)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei felt embarrassed. He had broken through to the intermediate stage of the Golden elixir realm, but he couldn’t even deal with an ant. Wouldn’t it be too embarrassing if word got out?

With a wave of his hand, the blue travel immortal sword under the control of his spiritual power and the qushuang flying sword under the control of a Sword Art flew toward the ant at the same time.

The two flying swords, one in front and one behind, accurately cut the wound on the ant’s neck.

Puchi! Puchi!

Xia ruofei had used all his strength to attack the ant twice, and he had cut off the head of the ant.

A large amount of green liquid spurted out of the ant’s neck, and after twitching a few times on the ground, it finally stopped moving.

There were ten ants that were slightly behind. When they saw their companion’s tragic death, they also increased their speed and pounced in Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue’s direction.

Xia ruofei’s expression was calm. He controlled the two flying swords and launched wave after wave of attacks at the ants.

The noble Sword technique was very mysterious and the ants moved slowly. Hence, most of Xia ruofei’s attacks could easily land on the ants.

However, the physical defense of these ants was very strong, and ordinary attacks could not cause much damage to them.

Xia ruofei had asked Ling Qingxue to stay far away from him. He seemed to have attracted the ants ‘aggro as they were basically surrounding Xia ruofei and ignoring Ling Qingxue. Hence, he did not have much to worry about. He only needed to use a bit of his spiritual power to watch over Ling Qingxue’s situation and prevent any danger from arising.

With the distance between him and Ling Qingxue, if there was any danger, he could put Ling Qingxue into the spirit map space to protect her with a thought, so her safety was not a problem.

Xia ruofei used the floating steps and his speed was relatively fast. Hence, even though the ants were surrounding him, they could not even touch the corner of his clothes.

Apart from barging in, the green acid that shot out from their mouthparts was also a very sharp attack.

However, now that Xia ruofei was on guard, their acid attacks were not sudden. It was not difficult for Xia ruofei to dodge them.

Xia ruofei controlled the two flying swords and fought with the ants.

His main means of attack, other than using his flying sword, would also directly use his fists and feet to attack the ants that were close to him. Every attack was naturally filled with Yuan Qi, and he would go all out.

Therefore, although these ants did not suffer any external injuries, their internal organs were more or less injured to varying degrees.

Furthermore, as Xia ruofei was dealing with the ants, he realized that the fatal weakness of the ants seemed to be the front of their necks.

However, these ants were crawling on the ground, so it was difficult for the flying sword to attack the front of their necks. However, every time they were about to spray the green acid, they would raise their heads, which naturally exposed their weakest and most fatal spots.

After Xia ruofei found the pattern, he consciously controlled the two flying swords to look for the ants that were about to spray the green acid. The moment they raised their heads, he would cut their necks.

Xia ruofei’s control of the flying sword had become more precise and the speed of the flying sword had also become faster. Hence, he had never missed.

Of course, because the ants ‘physical defense was very strong, even if it was a weak part, it would usually take two to three swords to cut off their heads.

Xia ruofei fought with these ants for more than 20 minutes and finally cut off the head of the last ant with the qushuang flying sword.

Xia ruofei then kept his flying sword and carefully walked out of the battle area. The blood and green liquid that the ants had shed were all very corrosive. When the liquid touched the ground, it would not evaporate in a short time. Hence, Xia ruofei had to be careful to avoid the corrosive liquid when he walked.

Xia ruofei came to Ling Qingxue’s side, still a little out of breath.

Xia ruofei was a little tired as he fought the ants with his own strength without using the power of the formation.

However, actual combat was indeed the most direct way to test it. These ants were at least at the advanced stage of the Golden core realm. Their physical defense was many times stronger than that of an ordinary golden core realm cultivator. Xia ruofei was able to take on ten of them alone and finally finished them off. This showed that his combat power had been greatly improved.

If he were to fight with a cultivator like Chen Nanfeng, who was at the advanced stage of the Aurous core stage and infinitely close to the nascent Soul Stage, even if he could not win, he would still have a lot of time to deal with him. Even Chen Nanfeng would find it difficult to defeat Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei had gained so much from the trial that he could hardly believe it. His strength had also been constantly improving through the trials, especially after he had broken through to the intermediate stage of the Golden core realm after taking the Vermillion Jade Fruit, which had increased his strength by a large margin.

“Ruofei, are you alright?” Ling Qingxue asked, concerned.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,””I’m fine! It’s just a few ants, it’s not hard to deal with them!”

Ling Qingxue had watched the entire battle and naturally knew that these ants were not the kind of ordinary ants that could be easily killed. It could be said that if any one of them jumped out to attack her, she would only be able to run for her life, and she might not even be able to escape. So, this was actually a very impressive result. At least it was not as simple as a few ants as Xia ruofei had said…

“It’s good that you’re not injured! I was watching from the side just now, and I was so worried!” Ling Qingxue said.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it just looked dangerous. It’s nothing!” Isn’t that easy to solve?”

“Mm…” Ling Qingxue said,”RUO Fei, where are we going next?” Does this mean that the mission is complete?”

Xia ruofei said,”based on my intuition, the trial Pagoda’s seventh floor can’t be that simple.” Didn’t the mission prompt say so? Based on the completion rate and other factors, the points will be calculated and the rewards will be given! So, how can you just let us pass so easily? I guess there’s a follow – up mission. Let’s explore the side!”

Even though this Palace did not have its own space, it was still very large. Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue had just entered the main hall. There was still a large area that they had not explored.

“Alright!” Ling Qingxue nodded.

Thus, the two of them carefully crossed the area filled with the corpses of ants and walked toward one of the side halls.

The side hall was quiet, and there was nothing unusual.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue went around the side hall and came to the back of the main hall.

There were several entrances to the palace. Between the first and second entrances was a huge Plaza. There were many flowers and plants planted in the parterre on both sides of the palace. Xia ruofei did not recognize most of them, but he had some impression of them. He should have seen them in the realm Heart island’s spirit herb garden in the spirit map space. It was obvious that the flowers in the garden were not ordinary flowers and plants, but some spiritual herbs and medicines.

However, Xia ruofei knew that the items in the Tower of Trials could not be stored in the storage space. Besides, he did not know what kind of test would be waiting for them, so he was not in the mood to check the spiritual herbs.

The two of them looked left and right, then quickly crossed the square.

However, just as they were halfway through, the two doors of the second hall suddenly opened, and a figure flew out.

Xia ruofei’s eyes narrowed when he saw who it was.

These monsters looked like the Badgers on earth, but their bodies were covered with hard scales and they had a single horn on their heads.

Star Beast!

Xia ruofei did not expect to encounter a Star Beast again.

When he was on the second floor of the Tower of Trials, the mission he received was to kill 100 intermediate astral beasts, so this kind of fast and high defense monster could be said to be fresh in his memory.

He didn’t expect that he would encounter a Star Beast again after reaching the seventh level of the Tower of Trials. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Xia ruofei took a quick glance, and a notification appeared in his perceptual mirror. There were a total of 22 star beasts, and they were all intermediate – Level star beasts.

Xia ruofei’s expression turned serious..
