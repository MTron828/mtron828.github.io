    Ling Qingxue didn't say anything. She just held Xia ruofei's hand quietly.

  She could feel the sorrow and helplessness in the heart of the man beside her when he was telling the heroic story.

  So he had gone through so much in the Army all these years ... Ling Qingxue thought to herself. At the same time, she felt her heart ache.

  The Prince Charming of the past seemed to have become different after being tempered by blood and fire in the military. He was more manly now. This feeling was especially strong when Xia ruofei used a low voice to describe his life and death experiences with his comrades.

  Xia ruofei calmed himself down and wiped his face with his hand. Then, he said,"

  "I'm sorry ... I just remembered something from the past. " Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

  Ling Qingxue smiled and said gently,"

  "Why are you embarrassed? I like to hear it! As long as it's related to you, I like to hear it!"

  Xia ruofei smiled and said in a lonely tone,"

  "It's actually nothing much. It's nothing more than training and fighting. Our daily life is very monotonous, but we all enjoy it ..."

  "Then why did you leave the Army?" Ling Qingxue asked in confusion.

  Xia ruofei smiled and said,"

  "For some personal reasons ... Forget it, let's not talk about this! It's getting late, let's go back! I still have to prepare lunch!"

  Only then did Ling Qingxue realize that the two of them had been sitting there and chatting for almost two hours.

  Xia ruofei held Ling Qingxue's hand and walked down. When they reached the bottom, Xia ruofei was the first to jump down. Standing on the beach, he extended his hands to Ling Qingxue and said,"

  "Come! I'll catch you ..."

  They were at a height of about two meters. Ling Qingxue felt a little scared instinctively, but when she saw Xia ruofei's open arms and the warm smile on his face, she felt a sense of security. She smiled and nodded at Xia ruofei before jumping off the rock.

  Xia ruofei caught Ling Qingxue accurately. However, Ling Qingxue's jump seemed to be a little too strong, and the two of them were tightly hugging each other.

  Xia ruofei could clearly feel two soft mounds pressing against his chest. His two hands were firmly pressed on Ling Qingxue 's ***. Xia ruofei could not help but feel his body stiffen. He quickly moved his hands away as if they were burning.

  Ling Qingxue's face turned red and she quickly let go of Xia ruofei. Then, she glanced at Xia ruofei and walked away with her head lowered.

  Xia ruofei hurried to catch up with Ling Qingxue.

  The two of them didn't speak until they got into the pickup truck, and the awkward atmosphere was a little ambiguous.

pouted.

21:03

  "Why are you acting dumb! I'm the one who's at a disadvantage, alright?"

  After they got into the car, Ling Qingxue suddenly burst out laughing. Her face was red as she pouted.

  "Why are you acting dumb! I'm the one who's at a disadvantage, alright?"

  "I'm ... Sorry! "I didn't do it on purpose ..." Xia ruofei stuttered as he explained.

  "Who knows?" Ling Qingxue said in a low voice. She then raised her head and said,"I don't care, you have to take responsibility!"

  "Ah?" Xia ruofei was shocked.

  It can't be! Didn't I just accidentally touch that part? However, Xia ruofei did not dare to say this out loud. Otherwise, he would be beaten to death by Ling Qingxue.

  "What wonderful things are you thinking about?" Ling Qingxue glanced at Xia ruofei affectionately and said,"I mean, you have to compensate me! Lunch must be a sumptuous meal. If I'm not satisfied ... Hmph ..."

  Xia ruofei quickly said,"

  "Don't worry! I'll definitely use all my skills ..."

  After saying this, Xia ruofei felt that it was awkward and ambiguous. He quickly added,"

  "And ... I've prepared a surprise for you!"

  "Oh, really? Hurry up and tell me!" Ling Qingxue immediately couldn't hold back anymore and said.

  Xia ruofei smiled mysteriously and said,"

  "Since it's a surprise, you can't tell me in advance ... You'll know when we get back!"

  "Tsk ... You're keeping me in suspense again!" Ling Qingxue pouted and glared at Xia ruofei in dissatisfaction.

  Xia ruofei laughed and ignored Ling Qingxue. He started the car and drove back.

  After the ruckus just now, the awkward atmosphere between the two of them had disappeared. Moreover, the two of them had chatted for so long before, and they felt that the distance between their hearts had shortened a lot. Therefore, the journey back was filled with laughter and laughter.

  When they returned to the holiday villa, Ling Qingxue immediately pestered Xia ruofei for a "surprise." Xia ruofei laughed and said,"

  "I was going to take it out after dinner, but since you're in such a hurry, then go get it now! Wait for me here!"

  After he finished speaking, Xia ruofei ran upstairs.

  When he returned to his bedroom, Xia ruofei locked the door. Then, he contacted the spirit map space and took out a pot of all - encompassing brocade. When he was cutting yesterday, he had specially left two pots of succulent mother plants. One pot was for Liang Qichao's white - skinned lunar boundary, and the other was for Ling Qingxue's all - encompassing brocade.

  The two pots of succulent mother plants did not undergo cutting this time. After being nourished by the spirit map space and the petal solution, they had already recovered and were growing very energetically.

  Wanxiang, also known as the twelve rolls of hairy men, had no stem. Its fleshy leaves were arranged in a loose Lotus seat shape, and the leaves were slanted from the base, semi - circular in shape. As for the Wanxiang brocade, it was a variant of the Wanxiang brocade, with irregular stripes on its leaves.

  The rare thing about this pot of nature brocade was that it had both orange and pink mutated stripes. These two colored mutated stripes were extremely rare to begin with, and it was even rarer to have both of them on a body. Its value was no less than that of the top - grade ice lantern.

  Xia ruofei used his mind to take out a watering can and watered the all - encompassing brocade with some water from the spatial pond. Then, he kept the watering can and went downstairs with the flower pot.

  Downstairs, Ling Qingxue was looking forward to it. When she saw Xia ruofei coming down, she immediately ran over.

  When she saw the flower pot in Xia ruofei's hand, her eyes lit up. Then, she couldn't move her eyes away and stared at the Wanxiang brocade for a long time before she said excitedly,"

  "Dual - colored Wanxiang brocade? And they were orange and pink! Oh my God ... Ruofei, where did you get so many high - Quality goods? The ice lantern from last time was already very rare, and this time, you're bringing out such a rare dual - colored striped all - Nature brocade ..."

  Ling Qingxue had always loved succulent plants, so much so that her admirers, including Liang Qichao, Lu Ping, Liu Minghao, and the others, had also begun to study succulents. Therefore, such a top - grade all - Nature brocade was a fatal temptation to her.

  Xia ruofei smiled and said,

  "A present for you! How was it? Are you surprised enough?"

  "For me?" Sure enough, Ling Qingxue's eyes revealed a look of pleasant surprise."This ... Seems too expensive!" It's at least a few hundred thousand ..."

  Xia ruofei said deliberately,"

  "You don't want it? Then I'll take it back!"

  With that, Xia ruofei pretended to turn around and go upstairs. Ling Qingxue hurriedly snatched the pot of all - encompassing brocade and held it in her arms.

  "Who said I didn't want it? There was no reason to take back something that had been given away. Hmph! You little brat!"

  Xia ruofei didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

  "I've spent so much effort to prepare a gift for you, but in the end, it's still not good! You've actually become a petty person ..."

  Ling Qingxue's eyes flashed with a hint of a smile."

  "You talk too much! Hurry up and prepare your lunch! If you're not satisfied, I'm not leaving ..."

  Then, she hugged the flower pot and used her shoulder to push Xia ruofei towards the kitchen.

  Xia ruofei quickly said,"

  "Don't push me, don't push me. I'll go now, alright?"

  With that, Xia ruofei fled into the kitchen. Ling Qingxue giggled as she looked at Xia ruofei's back and muttered to herself,"

  "This guy is quite thoughtful ..."

  Ling Qingxue's heart was filled with sweetness. She held the flower pot in her hands and walked to

the living room to sit down on the sofa. Her eyes fell on the all - Creation brocade, and her eyes revealed an indescribable joy.
