Chapter 797: Another Meritorious Service (1)

The person who was hot on Xia ruofei’s heels was the beautiful police officer, Qin Xiao Yu, who Xia ruofei had a few unpleasant encounters with.

Although the two of them were still quite a distance away from Xia ruofei, Xia ruofei’s eyesight was already amazing. In addition, Qin Xiao Yu’s proud upper body was too obvious, so Xia ruofei recognized her at a glance.

Qin Xiao Yu was not wearing her police uniform, but was dressed casually. As she ran, the pair of big white rabbits in front of her chest jumped up and down, it was a spectacular sight.

However, the one who was running away in front was obviously not in the mood to appreciate this erotic scene. He ran forward for a while, panting, and then grabbed an electric pole. He panted as he shouted,””Hey! Little girl! I’m warning you, stop chasing me! Otherwise, I won’t be polite to you!”

He stopped and Xia ruofei could see him clearly. The escapee was about 35 or 36 years old and looked quite strong. There was an obvious knife scar at the corner of his eye that extended all the way down to his cheek, making him look very ferocious.

However, he was a man, but he couldn’t outrun a woman like Qin Xiao Yu. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but despise him. It seemed that this man was strong on the outside but weak on the inside, his body was very weak!

Of course, Qin Xiao Yu was not a flower that could be measured by the standards of ordinary women.

Qin Xiao Yu was also quite tired. Seeing that the person in front of her had stopped running, she also slowed down, panting as she walked towards the person and said,””If you have the ability, then run! Even if you run to the ends of the earth, I can still get you back!”

Her words were full of ambiguity, as if a couple were flirting. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. Although he was still a dozen meters away, his hearing was much better than the average person ‘s. The conversation between the two was clearly heard by him.

Qin Xiao Yu was quite proud of herself now. She was taking a break today and was shopping alone, but she didn’t expect to meet this Scarface at the entrance of a nearby shopping mall.

Qin Xiao Yu felt that this Scarface looked a little familiar, as if he was a murder suspect in the investigation report sent by the Bureau some time ago.

As a result, this off – duty beautiful policewoman with a sense of justice immediately went forward to take a closer look, but she didn’t expect that the scar – faced man would actually turn and leave when he saw someone approaching him.

Qin Xiao Yu couldn’t help but speed up her pace.

......

But as she walked fast, the scar – faced man walked even faster. In this way, it soon evolved into the scar – faced man running in front and Qin Xiao Yu chasing behind.

Qin Xiao Yu was in hot pursuit, she saw that Scarface was so guilty, she was even more certain that there was something wrong with this person, so naturally she would not give up.

Just like that, the two of them, one running and one chasing, unknowingly arrived near the warehouse that Xia ruofei had rented.

There weren’t many houses in this area, most of them were warehouses, parking lots and so on, and there were few people coming and going. Seeing that he couldn’t get rid of Qin Xiao Yu, the scar – faced man simply stopped.

Scarface glared at Qin Xiao Yu maliciously and asked,””Why are you chasing me? Did she miss a man? Little girl, you’re too bold!”

Qin Xiao Yu snorted coldly and said,””Cut the crap! If you don’t have a guilty conscience, why are you running? Let me ask you, what’s your name and where are you from? Take out your id!”

Scarface pursed his lips and said,”beauty, aren’t you being too nosy?” What does my identity have to do with you? Could it be that you’re also a police sister?”

Qin Xiao Yu slowly approached Scarface, took out her police badge and showed it to Scarface, saying seriously,””City Bureau’s Criminal Investigation Unit first team’s Deputy Captain Qin Xiao Yu! I suspect that you’re related to an intentional homicide case. Please come back with me to the Public Security Bureau for investigation!”

Scarface was still perverted just now, but after seeing Qin Xiao Yu’s police badge, a trace of fierceness flashed in his eyes. However, it was only a flash. As his back was facing Xia ruofei who was sitting in the driver’s seat of the pickup truck, even Xia ruofei did not notice it.

Scarface concealed his emotions very well. He pretended to be wronged and scared and said,””Officer, you can eat whatever you want, but you can’t say whatever you want! I just look a little fierce, how would I have the guts to kill people! Don’t wrong a good person!”

Then, Scarface put his hand into his pocket and mumbled,””You just want to check my id, right? I’ll just give it to you ...”

Qin Xiao Yu was still staring coldly at this suspicious Scarface, but at the same time, she was also very vigilant. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Of course, she was still very confident. Although this Scarface was strong and healthy, if he were to really fight, she, the Overlord flower who had won third place in the People’s Public Security University of China’s mixed martial arts competition, would not be afraid.

One must know that the People’s Public Security University of China’s Sanda competition did not discriminate between men and women. Qin Xiao Yu was able to get third place, which meant that she was still very strong.

This was also the boldness of the skilled!

However ... She had clearly miscalculated.

The Scarface’s hand slowly reached in, and then, under Qin Xiao Yu’s gaze, he suddenly took it out, and ... He was holding a replica pistol in his hand, the black muzzle pointed at Qin Xiao Yu.

Xia ruofei, who had been sitting in the car with the mood to watch a good show, suddenly sat up straight. His heart was in his mouth.

Qin Xiao Yu was also stunned when she saw the scar – faced man suddenly pull out a gun.

It was her day off today, so she didn’t bring any police equipment like a gun or handcuffs.
