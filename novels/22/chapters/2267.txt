The smile on Xia ruofei’s face became even more radiant. He asked with a smile,””Old Liu, are you talking about the two hidden cameras at my five and Seveno’ clock? Oh right, there’s also a recording device half a meter to the right of your bed. If that’s all there is to it, then your Liu family really wouldn’t be that complicated!”

Old man Liu was finally moved.

After Receiving Manager Lu’s call in the morning, the Liu family had arranged for the top intelligence experts to make some arrangements in the ward.

Xia ruofei had made it clear that he wanted to meet with elder Liu alone. However, due to various considerations, the Liu family decided to record the entire meeting.

This was what old man Liu had requested. He had wanted to make an issue out of Liu haojun’s incident. Once Xia ruofei admitted to it, the recording would naturally become evidence.

By then, not only would it be legally reasonable for the Liu family to deal with Xia ruofei, but they could also openly hand the matter over to the public security organization to deal with. After all, Xia ruofei had ordered the Veterans to fully monitor Liu haojun and even enter his house to set up a recording device. All of these were obviously illegal.

What old master Liu did not expect was that Xia ruofei, who had always been flawless, did not even hesitate when Liu haojun asked the question and admitted it directly.

What shocked elder Liu even more was that Xia ruofei knew everything about the gadgets that were installed in the ward. He even knew their exact location and functions.

These were all temporary arrangements, and after the arrangement, the intelligence expert stayed in an empty Ward not far away to operate the signal receiving equipment. During this time, there was no way to contact the outside world, so the possibility of the news leaking from the Liu family was very low.

The only possibility was that Xia ruofei had found the recording equipment after entering the ward.

However, Xia ruofei had not looked around since he entered the room. He had even sat on the stool by the bed and could not see what was happening behind him.

However, he was able to pinpoint the location of the camera so accurately. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

This caught old man Liu off guard.

He also knew that since Xia ruofei dared to say those words, it meant that Xia ruofei had absolute confidence that the recording equipment would not work.

This method was a little magical ...

In fact, old master Liu didn’t know that it was too easy for Xia ruofei.

When he entered the room, he used his mental power to perform a comprehensive examination of the entire Ward. After all, the Liu family had a faint hostility towards him, so he couldn’t let his guard down.

After finding out about the existence of the cameras and recording devices, Xia ruofei did not show it. Instead, he continued to deal with old man Liu.

The only thing he did was to set up a sound – proof barrier to keep both him and old man Liu within the boundary.

In this way, the recording device at the head of the bed naturally couldn’t record any sound, and the camera behind him couldn’t capture his front face, so the possibility of lip – reading and the like was non – existent. As for capturing his back, it was useless.

Not only that, the soundproof barrier could completely isolate the sound from the outside world. Even if someone in the next room used special equipment to record against the wall, they would not be able to collect any sound.

The Liu family wanted to leave some evidence through this meeting, but it was destined to be useless.

Hence, Xia ruofei was a little mischievous. When old man Liu brought up Liu haojun’s question, he did not deny it as he did before. Instead, he admitted it in disguise.

As long as he did not leave any evidence, Xia ruofei was not worried that the Liu family would find out that he was the one who had planned this. There were only two possible outcomes for ran ran to come here today. First, if he let go of this matter, then old man Liu would not have much time left. The Liu family, who had lost their pillar, would not be able to deal with him. Second, if he was involved in the treatment, everything would go according to his plan. By then, the Liu family would no longer be a threat to him, and old man Liu would definitely not risk his life for Liu haojun.

Hence, although Xia ruofei seemed to have admitted to the matter easily, he had actually rehearsed it in his mind countless times before he came. He had already predicted all of elder Liu’s possible reactions.

Old man Liu was stunned for a long time before he finally revealed a bitter smile.””The future generations are formidable! The future generations are to be feared!”

“Elder Liu, you’re too kind. I’m just a little more cautious.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Old man Liu sighed and said with a trace of fatigue on his face,””Little Xia, it seems that I’ve really underestimated you ... Since you’ve already said this, there’s no point in hiding it anymore. Why don’t you open your mouth and tell me! What are your conditions?”

Old master Liu knew that since Xia ruofei was willing to meet him, it meant that there was still room for negotiation. Besides, Xia ruofei would definitely have his own conditions. It was just a bargain.

Since he had tried all the methods and they were still ineffective, he might as well use them to negotiate the price.

Xia ruofei finally smiled. To be honest, he had a good impression of this old man who had once contributed a lot to the country after meeting him. Although he had used some words and tricks today, as expected, he was not as dark and vicious as the portrait he had in his mind before he came.

On the contrary, perhaps because he was about to reach the end of his life, the old man gave him a feeling of freedom. Even if he was not as righteous as elder song, he was at least able to let go of things.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Mr. Liu, it’s not a condition. After all, your condition is rather complicated. I don’t even know if I can treat you ...”

Old Liu waved his hand and said,”there’s no need to talk about this. If you can’t cure it, then no one else can. So the result is the same for me. Tell me your conditions!”

“Chief, you’re so straightforward!” Xia ruofei gave him a thumbs up and said,”I can try to treat you, but I’ve studied your condition before I came. It’s unlikely that you’ll recover in a short time. Even if I can control your condition through Traditional Chinese Medicine, I’m afraid you’ll need to take medicine for a long time ...”

Old master Liu’s eyes narrowed. He had already thought of this. No matter if Xia ruofei was confident or not, he would not be able to cure him easily. This was the only way for the Liu family to be held back and for Xia ruofei to be invincible.

Therefore, it did not matter whether Xia ruofei was telling the truth or not.

Old man Liu naturally wouldn’t be bothered by this. He smiled and said,””It’s better to live than die a good death. It’s always good to see more of this world ...”He said.

“It’s good that you’re mentally prepared. ” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Little Xia, I’m afraid the consultation fee won’t be too cheap if you treat me, right?” Old man Liu asked indifferently.

“The Liu family has a pharmaceutical factory in the East China region ...” Xia ruofei smiled.

Before he could finish, old man Liu said directly,””No problem. Within three days, the factory will be transferred to the Paradise Corporation!”

Xia ruofei had expected that old master Liu would agree, but he did not expect him to agree so readily.

The scale of the Liu family’s pharmaceutical factory was not something that paradise pharmaceutical factory could compare to. To be more precise, it was a Pharmaceutical Group with many branches in several provinces in East China.

Each branch factory was several times the size of the Paradise pharmaceutical factory. Including the expensive imported equipment in the pharmaceutical factory and the value of the land, the overall value of this Pharmaceutical Group was probably higher than the current paradise Corporation.

Before Xia ruofei went to see elder song, he had analyzed the Liu family’s situation. He was determined to get the Liu family’s pharmaceutical factory. Once he got the factory, he could immediately switch to producing heart – nourishing soup and jaded skin ointment with a little modification.

And by then, the production of these two products, which were in short supply, would increase by at least ten times!

“Xiao Xia, just state your conditions in one go!” Old man Liu said indifferently. We don’t need to waste too much time on these trivial things ...”
