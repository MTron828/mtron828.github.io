Chapter 1278: Chapter 773 – convinced_1

Translator: 549690339

Guo Hongjiang really thought that he was in a dream. He couldn’t help but secretly pinch his thigh, and he grimaced in pain.

It was rare to see a real estate tycoon in Hong Kong lose his composure.

Even when Xia ruofei led “star of Hong Kong” to Guo Hongjiang, his mind was still filled with the image of Xia ruofei riding “star of Hong Kong” on the training track.

The image of the “star of Hong Kong” with his strong figure and speed like the wind was still lingering in Guo Hongjiang’s mind.

“Director Guo!” Xia ruofei smiled as he handed the reins over.”Do you want to try?”

Guo Hongjiang came back to his senses. He waved his hand and said,””Oh, it’s okay ... I like horse racing, but I’m not good at it. I can’t ride a horse like the star of Hong Kong.”

As a billionaire, Guo Hongjiang could at most ride a gentle mare in the club. For a professional race like the “star of Hong Kong,” there was naturally a dedicated rider.

At that speed, falling off the horse was likely to be the end of their lives.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Actually, the ‘star of Hong Kong’ is quite gentle. You can try!”

Guo Hongjiang looked at the “star of Hong Kong” who was rubbing his head against Xia ruofei’s body. He had a strange feeling in his heart. Was this still the fierce horse that gave even professional trainers a headache?

And didn’t Mr. Xia know nothing about horse racing before? The way he rode the horse was even better than professional jock – riders. His coordination with the “star of Hong Kong” was also quite perfect. It was as if his whole body was stuck to the back of the horse, and he adjusted his posture naturally with the movement of the horse’s back. It was almost like he was one with the horse.

“Shall I try?” Guo Hongjiang was really eager to try.

If it was in the past, he would never have done something like this. However, after seeing Xia ruofei’s gallop today, he actually felt a little envious.

“Don’t worry!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”absolutely safe! I’ll take responsibility if anything goes wrong!”

Guo Hongjiang also made up his mind. He laughed and said,”With a Divine Doctor like you here, what do I have to be afraid of? I’ll give it a try today. I’m the owner of the ‘star of Hong Kong’! It doesn’t make sense that I’ve never ridden it before!”

After he finished speaking, Guo Hongjiang took the reins.

Xia ruofei patted the head of the star of Hong Kong and said,””Little guy, director Guo is your master, be careful when you run! Don’t play any tricks on purpose!”

The star of Hong Kong snorted and paced around.

Guo Hongjiang couldn’t help but find it funny. Xia ruofei was so serious. Could it be that the “star of Hong Kong” could understand?

He smiled, put his left foot on the stirrup, and then flipped over to sit on the horse’s back.

Although he had never ridden a professional horse race like the “star of Hong Kong”, Guo Hongjiang’s riding skills were still good.

Fortunately, Guo Hongjiang had cleared the entire training base. Even the bodyguards were waiting outside the training ground. Otherwise, those people would be frightened to see this scene.

Guo Hongjiang gently shook the reins, and the “star of Hong Kong” immediately understood and ran forward.

However, it was different from before. The “star of Hong Kong” was not running very fast, but it was very stable. Guo Hongjiang could not even feel much turbulence on the horse’s back.

Guo Hongjiang was very surprised. He couldn’t help but turn to look at Xia ruofei. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Then, he gently pinched the horse’s belly and shouted,””Faster!”

The next moment, Guo Hongjiang immediately felt that the “star of Hong Kong” had increased its speed, but it was still very stable. In the blink of an eye, he had ridden one round. It felt no different from riding the gentle mares in the equestrian Club.

When he was in front of Xia ruofei, Guo Hongjiang pulled the reins and got off the horse easily.

“Mr. Xia! I didn’t expect that not only are your medical skills brilliant, but your skills in taming horses are also so amazing!” Guo Hongjiang said excitedly,”it’s really hard to imagine that you’ve trained the ‘star of Hong Kong’ to such a level in just three days. My team spent two years and still couldn’t do it!”

In fact, from a professional point of view, the “star of Hong Kong” did not even meet the requirements to participate in the competition, because its wild nature had not been completely tamed, and it was also very violent.

However, the star of Hong Kong was born with superior conditions, and the existence of some minor flaws did not affect its ability to win in the arena.

Now, Guo Hongjiang could clearly feel that the “star of Hong Kong” had been reborn. From Xia ruofei’s previous gallop, the “star of Hong Kong” had fully recovered and was even faster than before.

All of this was because of Xia ruofei.

Guo Hongjiang found it hard to believe.

He finally understood why Xia ruofei had repeatedly told him not to do any X – ray for a month and to apply medicine every day to make it look like the star of Hong Kong was still under treatment.

If the real situation of the “star of Hong Kong” was known to the public, it would cause a sensation. Even Xia ruofei, the creator of this miracle, would not be able to bear the disturbance.

Guo Hongjiang reminded himself that he had to be careful with the things that Xia ruofei had told him to do. He couldn’t even reveal anything to his most trusted confidant. He had to follow Xia ruofei’s instructions and make it look like he was still in treatment. After a month or two, he would let the “star of Hong Kong” make a comeback.
