Chapter 961: Showing great mercy (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei was only dazed for a moment, but his eyes were clear again.

In his heart, Lin Qiao was like his younger sister. He could not have any improper thoughts about her.

Even though there were moments when he felt his heart palpitate, Xia ruofei immediately pushed these thoughts out of his mind.

Xia ruofei scratched his head in embarrassment and said,””Why don’t you ask Jennifer to help you later ...”

Although Lin Qiao would usually hold his arm and stick close to him, and he would sometimes rub Lin Qiao’s hair affectionately, these were still within the scope of a brother – sister relationship.

However, if he applied sunblock on Lin Qiao’s back as he did today, it would be a little over the line.

Lin Qiao pouted and said,”Jennifer needs to put on sunblock herself!” Don’t you see that Mr. Tang is also helping? Brother RUO Fei ...”

Xia ruofei saw the grievance in Lin Qiao’s eyes and his heart softened. He said helplessly,””Alright, alright, you can lie down!”

Lin Qiao immediately smiled and said,”I knew that brother ruofei wouldn’t leave me alone!”

After she finished speaking, the little girl immediately lay down on the recliner and said,””Brother ruofei, you have to apply it evenly! Otherwise, it won’t work!”

“I know!” Xia ruofei said with a bitter smile.

He squeezed some sunblock onto his hand and hesitated for a moment. In the end, he placed his hand on Lin Qiao’s smooth back.

Lin Qiao’s body obviously trembled, and Xia ruofei’s heart couldn’t help but waver.

He quickly shook his head and began to apply sunblock on Lin Qiao without looking sideways. He also forced out the distracting thoughts in his mind.

Lin Qiao’s shy face also showed a happy smile.

From her shoulders to her back, Xia ruofei dutifully applied the sunblock on Lin Qiao’s body.

It was Lin Qiao’s first time having such an experience. Her heart was beating wildly and her face was blushing.

After applying the ointment on his waist, Xia ruofei stood up as if he had been pardoned and said,””Alright, you can do the rest by yourself!”

No matter what, Xia ruofei did not dare to continue.

In fact, the process of applying the ointment on his back had already made Xia ruofei feel like he was walking on thin ice.

He wasn’t a Saint, so it was impossible for him to not have any distracting thoughts in his mind.

However, he had to constantly remind himself not to have any random thoughts.

To Xia ruofei, this was torture.

Lin Qiao wasn’t any better. After Xia ruofei finished applying sunblock for her, she said in a mosquito – like voice,””Thank you, brother ruofei!”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and waved his hand.””It’s fine. Quickly apply it and get ready to go into the water!”

“Oh ...” Lin Qiao secretly stuck out her tongue and a shy smile appeared on her blushing face.

Lin Qiao continued to apply sunblock on herself. Xia ruofei hurriedly turned around and rubbed his back on her. The scene was too tempting. Xia ruofei didn’t dare to watch it anymore.

Lin Qiao raised her head and glanced at Xia ruofei. He was wearing a pair of dark blue swimming trunks and his skin was very fair. However, his muscles were very strong and full of strength under the sun.

She shyly glanced at him and quickly looked away. At the same time, she couldn’t help but feel a little puzzled. Lin Qiao knew that when Lin Hu went home to visit his relatives, his body would be tanned to a bronze color, so dark that it was almost shiny. According to Lin Hu, they trained hard every day and were often exposed to the hot sun. She didn’t know why Xia ruofei’s skin was still so fair. Did he recover so well after being discharged from the military for a year?

Xia ruofei’s current skin color made many girls jealous.

Actually, it was impossible to recover from the dark meteoric black so quickly. Besides, Xia ruofei had never used any skin care products. He had only become like this after taking the body tempering soup and practicing the body tempering posture demonstrated by the little golden man. The impurities in his body had been expelled.

Actually, Xia ruofei was quite depressed sometimes. He was clearly a special Combat Elite full of strength and explosive power, but he had the appearance of a pretty boy.

On the other side, Jennifer was applying sunblock on Tang Yitian. Lin Qiao was a little envious of their loving look. She asked with a little shyness,””Brother ruofei, do you need me to help you put on some sunblock? The ultraviolet rays are quite strong today. ”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”ah? No need, no need, no need, my skin is thick, I’m not afraid of the sun!”

“Oh, I know ...” Lin Qiao said disappointedly.

After everyone was ready to stop, they went into the sea from the stern deck. Even Tang Haoran went into the sea with a Lifebuoy in hand.

Tang Haoran had been learning to swim since he was very young. Jennifer and Tang Yitian had good swimming skills, and Captain Emily and the two beautiful crew members were all professional at sea life – saving, so there was no need to worry too much about him.

Lin Qiao grew up by the sea and had a lot of fun in the sea. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Xia ruofei excitedly brought Tang Haoran around the yacht for a few rounds. Swimming in the vast sea, they felt free and unrestrained. It was as if the whole world had been cleansed.

Xia ruofei lay on the surface of the sea and looked at the sky – Blue dome. He couldn’t help but feel like he was riding the wind and returning to the immortal world.

It was not until Lin Qiao felt a little tired that everyone returned to the yacht. After having a lunch on the sea, the yacht lifted its anchor and set sail.
