Chapter 1403: Full of positive energy_1

Translator: 549690339

“Alright!”

“Well said, factory manager Xue!”

While the reporters below the stage were clapping, they couldn’t help but cheer. The scene became very enthusiastic. It didn’t seem like a press conference, but more like a fan meeting.

Xue Jinshan had clearly stated that the heart – nourishing soup was only for sale in the Huaxia region for the time being, and it could only be issued from the hospital. That meant that the current limited production was being used on the Chinese autistic people.

Moreover, he also expressed that he would coordinate and request the health department to jointly supervise and prevent individual hospitals and doctors from colluding with scalpers to privately prescribe heart – nourishing soup for people who didn’t need it to resell.

This made everyone even more excited.

After all, if the effect of the heart – nourishing soup was as good as it was previously introduced, and the price was relatively low, the supply in short supply would inevitably give birth to a group of scalpers. If it was not contained from the beginning, it was likely that patients who really needed this special medicine would appear, and they could only buy it from the scalpers at a high price.

In this way, the Paradise corporation’s low price policy was meaningless. Instead, it fattened up a group of scalpers.

Xue Jinshan pressed his hands down slightly and said with a smile, “I’d like to take this opportunity to report some good news to all of you from the media. Our heart – nourishing soup has been officially included in the new edition of the guided medication list for autism. This list will be announced very soon!”

After the reporters heard this news, they also had a feeling of sudden realization.

No wonder Jiang Liangyu and he kun came to today’s press conference openly. It turned out that the heart – nourishing soup had already been listed on the guided drug list before it was even on the market. Moreover, for such a good medicine with boundless merit, as the leaders of the government and the higher – ups, attending the press conference showed that they attached great importance to it. There was no need to avoid suspicion at all.

The reporters ‘enthusiasm for questions was even higher, and they all raised their hands.

At first, they thought it was just a routine interview, to collect the transportation fee, to get a draft, and to make some slight changes to the draft review platform. As for whether it could be published in their own media outlets, they didn’t even care.

Every year, there were as many press conferences of this size as there were hairs on a cow. If it wasn’t for the recent popularity of the Paradise Corporation, many media outlets wouldn’t have sent people to attend even if they had transportation fees.

However, at this point in time, the reporters had also realized that this wasn’t a simple press conference. It was very likely to go down in history. After all, from today onwards, Yangxin soup had officially entered the public’s view. No one could imagine how high Yangxin soup could reach in the future.

Xue Jinshan was full of confidence. He randomly picked a few reporters and let them ask questions.

The reporters ‘questions were all kinds of strange, but most of them revolved around the heart – nourishing soup. Some of them inevitably asked about the Jushi ointment. Xue Jinshan was very familiar with these two businesses. He basically didn’t need to look at the information prepared by the team in advance. A lot of data was at his fingertips.

Soon, the Q & A session was over, and the press conference came to an end.

Originally, the new drug launch could have ended directly, but today, two “uninvited guests” Jiang Liangyu and he kun came at the last minute. So, as usual, they had to ask the Leader to say a few words.

Xia ruofei had already made it clear that he would not go on stage or speak, but Jiang Liangyu and he kun were giving way to the staff when they asked for their opinions in advance.

If Jiang Liangyu had not come today, he kun would definitely have taken the responsibility to go on stage and put in a few good words for the heart – nourishing soup. However, since Jiang Liangyu had come, he kun would not be in the limelight no matter what. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

After a few rejections, Jiang Liangyu finally agreed to let him speak on the stage.

The staff member saw that the big shots had finally reached a consensus and was secretly relieved. He quickly informed Xue Jinshan on the stage through the walkie – talkie.

Xue Jinshan was almost done with the process and was just waiting for the news from the two leaders. So when he heard the exact news from the earpiece, he immediately smiled and said,”Finally, let us welcome Mr. Jiang Liangyu, the Deputy Mayor of the Sanshan People’s Government, to give a speech on stage!”

Jiang Liangyu stood up and buttoned his suit, walking up to the stage with a smile on his face.

Xue Jinshan politely shook Jiang Liangyu’s hand and passed the microphone to him. Then, he gave up the stage.

Jiang Liangyu was naturally used to giving a speech on various occasions. Although he did not prepare any script, he was still full of confidence.

He unhurriedly turned on the microphone and said with a smile,””Actually, I wasn’t going to give a speech at first. The main purpose of coming here today is to watch the ceremony, but since I’m on stage, I still have to say a few words. I’m not only representing myself, but also the People’s Government of Sanshan city. At the same time, I’m also entrusted by chief he kun of the provincial Drug Control Bureau to send a few words of blessing to Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory on his behalf!”

He kun, who was below the stage, smiled and nodded. Although Jiang Liangyu’s words were just for show, it made people feel comfortable.

Jiang Liangyu’s gaze turned to Xia ruofei, who was sitting below the stage, and said,””Just now, I was sitting next to CEO Xia of paradise Corporation. We also chatted for a while and found that we have a lot in common!”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. This Mayor Jiang was not following the routine! Didn’t the leaders always speak in a calm and steady manner? Why is this person letting his horse rein? I don’t even remember what we talked about just now, so how did I find something in common?
