However, after the tempering and baptism of the seven Star Pavilion, his talent had increased. He had actually seen many unusual details in this seemingly ordinary cultivation method.

These details all showed that this cultivation technique was not that simple. Perhaps its level and value were much higher than what it was showing now.

Xia ruofei was very interested in this technique that even the most ordinary disciples of the first heaven society could practice at will.

After returning to the small courtyard, Xia ruofei decided to spend more time studying the quiet environment. His instinct told him that he would find something interesting.

However, just as he sat down, he heard a knock on the door.

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and raised his voice.””Just come in! The courtyard door isn’t locked!”

The door to the small courtyard opened with a bang. Xia ruofei walked into the courtyard and looked up. When he saw that it was Chen Xuan, he couldn’t help but smile and said,””Sect leader Chen is working so hard. Why didn’t you stay there to take care of the old master? what are you doing here?”

“I wanted to ask you how your harvest was!” Chen Xuan replied with a wide smile.

“I told you in the main hall just now. Your talent should have improved a little.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“I didn’t ask about this!” Chen Xuan asked,”what happened after that? When you went to the area of the Golden core cultivators, what magic treasure did you get?”

Even Chen Nanfeng wanted to know. He could not clearly sense the situation in the seven Star Pavilion, so he had no idea what magical treasure Xia ruofei had obtained. He only saw a golden light flying in Xia ruofei’s direction and knew that he had most likely obtained something.

Xia ruofei didn’t want to hide it. After all, he had gotten it from the seven Star Pavilion of the first heaven society.

Moreover, the flying sword was originally taken out by the chubby kid’s weapon spirit to deceive Xia ruofei. The real reward was naturally the seven stars order that controlled the seven stars Pavilion.

Hence, Xia ruofei took out the Golden flying sword from the spirit map and used his spiritual power to levitate it in front of Chen Xuan. He then said,””This is it. The quality is quite good!”

Chen Xuan glanced at the Golden flying sword and a look of surprise appeared on his face.”This is a dazzling golden flying sword! It’s said that it was a magic weapon of one of our first heaven society’s ancestors. I didn’t expect that it would also be accepted into the seven Star Pavilion, and that the artifact Spirit would actually recognize you and give you the dazzling golden flying sword!”

“Isn’t it all thanks to you for passing me the “black origin Scripture”? I’m guessing it’s because I cultivate this cultivation technique that the artifact Spirit sees me in a different light!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Then shouldn’t you thank me properly?” Chen Xuan laughed.

“That’s a must! In the future, if brother Chen needs help, as long as it’s within my ability, I’ll definitely do my best to help!” Xia ruofei said.

“I’m just joking!”Chen Xuan quickly waved his hand. We, the first heaven society, owe you a big favor. Everyone has the opportunity to enter the seven Star Pavilion, but you’ll only be allowed to enter one more area for golden core cultivators. We can’t control what kind of magic treasures you can get. If you really want to count, we still owe you a favor!”

Following that, Chen Xuan could not help but burst into laughter.””That’s why we can’t calculate it clearly! Friends should help each other, why would they always care about gains and losses?”

“What brother Chen said makes sense!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”then 1’11 find a chance to buy you a drink to thank you!”

“This is possible!” Chen Xuan laughed heartily.”Brother ruofei, I won’t disturb you any longer!” Have a good rest here, 1’11 get someone to call you when it’s time to eat!”

Chen Xuan was actually here on Chen Nanfeng’s orders. Chen Nanfeng also wanted to know what kind of Dharma Treasure Xia ruofei had obtained. If it was too inferior, it would not be enough to repay the favor. In that case, Chen Nanfeng would have to consider giving Xia ruofei more benefits.

During the meal, Mu Sheng, Liu Mansha, and the others were also there. Naturally, it was not convenient for Chen Nanfeng to ask. After all, none of them had entered the special area. Including Mu Sheng, they had only stayed in the small spaces of the seven Star Pavilion. Only Xia ruofei had received such treatment. How could he reveal this in front of everyone?

Now, Chen Xuan felt much more at ease. After all, the dazzling golden flying sword was quite famous in the first heaven society. The quality of this flying sword was quite high. Now that Xia ruofei had obtained it, the first heaven society could be considered to have returned the favor.

Chen Xuan was in a hurry to return home to inform his father, so he did not stay long at Xia ruofei’s place. After he had found out the truth, he immediately stood up and left.

After Chen Xuan left, Xia ruofei returned to his room and sat cross – legged on the futon. He began to study the mysterious origin Scripture that he was very interested in.

Xia ruofei’s expression was as calm as water, like an old monk in meditation. It was impossible for him to grasp the fleeting inspiration every time, so he was neither sad nor happy. He kept looking for an unusual answer in some details.

Time passed by unknowingly.

Xia ruofei suddenly opened his eyes and looked in the direction of the courtyard gate.

He wasn’t in a state of cultivation, and he was in the first heaven sect, so he couldn’t be completely unprepared.

Just as Xia ruofei opened his eyes, there was a knock on the door.

“Come in!” Xia ruofei said in a clear voice.

He stood up as he spoke. He did not feel any soreness in his legs after sitting for a long time, but his clothes were wrinkled. Xia ruofei tidied his clothes as he walked out of the room.

“Senior Xia, the young sect leader asked me to take you to dinner!” Zeng Qing, the managing disciple, pushed open the door and said to Xia ruofei respectfully.

Zeng Qing had become Xia ruofei’s exclusive service staff. The sect had not assigned him any tasks. His only mission was to ensure that Xia ruofei’s food and living conditions were well taken care of.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.”! understand. Please wait a moment. I need to change my clothes.”

“Yes!” Zeng Qing said quickly, then stood in the courtyard with his hands down and waited.

Xia ruofei returned to his room and changed his clothes.

He was still used to wearing the casual clothes of the secular world. He was definitely not used to wearing those loose Taoist robes. So these days, among a group of cultivators dressed in long robes, Taoist robes, and tight – fitting clothes, Xia ruofei, who was dressed in casual clothes, seemed to stand out.

However, he had this strength and status, so others naturally would not gossip behind his back.

Xia ruofei did not change out of his Taoist robe this time, but he changed into a more formal suit as a form of respect for Chen Nanfeng.

After changing his clothes, Xia ruofei followed Zeng Qing and returned to the Empyrean one Pavilion.

This Hall was also the place where the first heaven society received their guests.

When Xia ruofei arrived, Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha had already arrived a few minutes before him.

This time, none of them brought their disciples along and came to the banquet in person.

“Nephew Xia, come, come, come! We’re just missing you!” Chen Nanfeng, who was sitting at the head of the table, greeted him with a smile.

Xia ruofei cupped his hands.’Tm really sorry. I took some time to change my clothes. I’ve made all of you wait. I’m really sorry!”

“We’re not outsiders, so there’s no need to mind these formalities!” Chen Nanfeng chuckled and said,”come, come, come! Sit down and talk!”

Xia ruofei then walked to the empty seat and sat down.

Today’s banquet was a little similar to the Imperial feasts in ancient imperial palaces. Everyone had a small table in front of them, and the dishes were naturally small portions for each person. Chen Nanfeng sat in the middle, Chen Xuan sat on the first seat on his left, and a golden core elder sat on the first seat on his right. Then, Mu Sheng, Liu Mansha, and the others sat.

Xia ruofei’s seat was arranged beside Chen Xuan.

After Xia ruofei sat down, Chen Nanfeng raised his glass with a smile and said,””Everyone, let’s have a drink together! The reason why I, Chen Nanfeng, could break through to the nascent Soul Stage was inseparable from the support of my old friends here for many years, especially nephew RUO Fei, who helped me at the critical moment of my breakthrough.. I will remember this kindness for the rest of my life! Let this first glass of wine express my gratitude to everyone!”
