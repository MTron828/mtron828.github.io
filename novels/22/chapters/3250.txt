Elon Musk hesitated for a moment, and said with some embarrassment,””Mr. Xia, I’m really willing to provide a Dragon Ship and an extended cabin for free. But ... If Mr. Xia can agree to a small request of mine, that would be even better. ”

“Tell me about it first,” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

The more subtle Elon Musk was, the more Xia ruofei felt that this “small request” might not be so simple, so he was very cautious.

“I’d like to hire Mr. Xia as my private medical consultant,”said Elon Musk. Of course ... I have a special medical team to serve you, so you don’t have to stay in the United States all the time. However, if I or my family encounter more troublesome health problems, I hope to receive your help. The salary will definitely satisfy you. You can ask for a salary and I will definitely satisfy it!”

After witnessing Xia ruofei’s treatment of little X, Elon Musk began to have this idea.

He was undoubtedly a rich man, richer than most people on earth. He could squander his wealth for a few lifetimes and could basically enjoy any material conditions he wanted.

However, on the issue of birth, aging, illness, and death, it was fair to everyone. If one really got a terminal illness, money actually didn’t have much use.

Gang leader Qiao was much richer than Elon Musk, but in the face of a dangerous and malignant tumor like pancreatic cancer, his money could only extend his life for a few years. In the end, it was not enough to turn the situation around.

Hence, Xia ruofei’s magical medical skills were extremely precious.

Elon Musk quickly realized Xia ruofei’s value, so he changed his previous cautious attitude and even offered to give Xia ruofei a Dragon spaceship for free, as well as a few extended cabins. To put it bluntly, he was interested in Xia ruofei’s ability to bring him back to life.

If he could make Xia ruofei his personal medical consultant, it would be like adding another layer of insurance to his life!

Of course, Xia ruofei would not easily agree to such a “small request” from Elon Musk. As an Aurous core stage cultivator, was it not a joke to be a medical consultant for an ordinary person? What’s more, it was foreseeable that he would spend more and more time on cultivation in the future. How could he fly to the United States for no reason because of the health problems of Elon Musk?

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””Mr. Masker, I’m afraid I can’t agree to this ... I think we should talk about business as usual! We can spend money to buy your company’s spaceships and expansion cabins, and we will definitely give you enough profit space! This seemed more convenient! Of course, if Mr. Masker is not willing to sell the Dragon Ship, we will not force you ...”

“Mr. Xia, you’ve misunderstood,” Elon Musk quickly said. “I don’t mean to use the spaceship to threaten you. I’ve said that it’s just a small request. If it’s not convenient for Mr. Xia, just pretend I didn’t say anything! However, I can still give you the spaceship and the expansion cabin for free as a token of my gratitude to Mr. Xia! You saved little X. This is not just business!”

Elon Musk was still clear about the basic situation. He knew that Xia ruofei’s medical skills were equivalent to the power to bring the dead back to life. Furthermore, little X’s treatment was still in progress. How could he easily offend Xia ruofei? Even if he couldn’t hire Xia ruofei as his private medical consultant, the benefits of having a good relationship with someone as powerful as Xia ruofei were obvious. If he were to suffer from a terminal illness in the future and beg Xia ruofei for help, perhaps he would be willing to help him because he had given him the spaceship for free today.

Of course, Elon Musk didn’t want to get a terminal illness in the future, but he still had the awareness to prepare for a rainy day.

If that day really came, as long as Xia ruofei cared a little about their friendship today, the spaceship would not have been given away for nothing.

Xia ruofei saw that Elon Musk was so understanding, and he had already said so much. He was too embarrassed to reject him too thoroughly.

After a moment of silence, Xia ruofei said,””I can make a move three times.”

Elon Musk was stunned for a moment, and he did not come back to his senses.””What?”

“I’ll be taking the spaceship. You have three chances to ask me for help in the future.” Xia ruofei replied,”of course, it’s only limited to health issues! You can use the three chances on yourself, your family, or even people who have nothing to do with you, but I can only help you three times. After that, we’ll be even. ” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Elonmask finally understood. He said in surprise and joy,””That’s great! Thank you! Thank you, Mr. Xia! You are a generous gentleman!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you’re welcome, Mr. Masker. We’re just taking what we need.” By the way, I need to remind you of something. ”

“Please speak!”

“I believe that you won’t use up all three chances in a short period of time.” Xia ruofei said,”so, I can’t guarantee that I’ll be free when you need my help one day. I can leave you a contact number. If I can’t come due to unforeseen circumstances, I’ll make the appropriate arrangements in advance. I hope you can understand.”

A practitioner’s promise was not something that could be casually made. If Xia ruofei went into seclusion for a few years and did not come out, and Elon Musk happened to ask him for help again, he would probably be in despair. Hence, Xia ruofei had also made things clear to Elon Musk in advance to avoid more problems later on.
