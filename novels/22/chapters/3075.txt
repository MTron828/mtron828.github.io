3076 Chen Nanfeng (2)

The function of the meeting hall, other than the elders discussing matters, was sometimes used to receive important guests. Usually, the sect leader and elders would personally receive them in the meeting hall to show how important they were.

Chen Xuan had thought that his father would meet Xia ruofei at his residence. After all, Xia ruofei was just a junior. It was already a great honor for his father to meet him personally.

He did not expect his father to meet Xia ruofei in the meeting hall.

This was at least the standard for receiving the sect leaders of other sects.

However, on second thought, Chen Xuan felt that this did not seem to be an attempt to criticize Xia ruofei’s performance at the auction. Anyone with eyes could see that even the sect leader of the star Seizer sect, Luo Qingfeng, seemed to listen to Xia ruofei’s words and even follow his orders.

Hence, Xia ruofei’s status in the star Seizer sect seemed to be above Luo Qingfeng ‘s.

Based on this logic, although Xia ruofei was young, his status was not lower than a sect leader. It was not too outrageous for his father to meet Xia ruofei in the meeting hall.

“Brother Xia, this way please!” Chen Xuan said with a smile.

Xia ruofei didn’t know much about the first heaven society, so he didn’t know the reason why the sect leader wanted to meet him in the meeting hall. He just followed Chen Xuan’s footsteps and went up the smooth mountain path.

Soon, the two of them arrived at the peak.

A majestic hall was built on the peak, and two disciples of the eighth level of the aura refining realm stood on both sides of the door of the hall.

Upon seeing Chen Xuan, the two disciples bowed and greeted him before making an inviting gesture.

Chen Xuan brought Xia ruofei into the hall.

Xia ruofei quickly observed his surroundings. The hall was about ten meters tall, which was equivalent to a three – story building. Purple – Gold pillars were neatly arranged, supporting the entire Hall. The hall was paved with smooth bluestone, and from the entrance of the hall, there was a path of about six meters wide paved with light blue stones.

On both sides of the road, chairs were neatly arranged.

At the end of the path were steps made of blue stones of the same material.

There was a small platform after the nine steps, on which there were tables and chairs.

A figure in a moon – White robe was sitting behind the table. Xia ruofei wanted to take a closer look but realized that he could not see the person’s face clearly.

Of course, this was not because Xia ruofei’s eyesight was not good enough. After becoming a cultivator, he could see even an ant at such a short distance.

However, when Xia ruofei’s gaze fell on the person sitting in the main hall, he felt that there was a layer of fog covering his face. He could not see clearly. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Of course, Xia ruofei knew that this man was Chen Xuan’s father, the current sect leader of the first heaven society, and a late – Stage golden core cultivator, Chen Nanfeng.

Therefore, he only caught a glimpse of it and did not dare to size it up without restraint.

Very quickly, Xia ruofei felt a gaze on him. This gaze was not overbearing, but it seemed to be able to destroy everything. It made Xia ruofei feel like he was being seen through.

“This child greets father!” Chen Xuan brought Xia ruofei to a stop about ten meters away from the steps. He bowed and said,”father, this is brother Xia, Xia Tianxia from the star Seizer sect!”

“Greetings, sect leader Chen!” Xia ruofei also cupped his hands and said.

“Is this our young friend Xia Tian?” Chen Nanfeng’s voice was heard.”You’re indeed a promising young man!”

Xia ruofei felt that Chen Nanfeng’s voice was actually very gentle, similar to Chen Xuan’s style. It was the kind that was very friendly. However, at the same time, he could feel that this voice seemed to have a kind of magic that made people submit.

Xia ruofei suddenly realized that this sect leader Chen must be highly accomplished in the aspect of spiritual power.

One must know that Xia ruofei’s spiritual power had already reached the late – Stage of the spirit gathering realm, which was stronger than most cultivators in the intermediate stage of the Golden core realm. However, Chen Nanfeng’s simple words had caused Xia ruofei to feel dazed.

This meant that Chen Nanfeng’s spiritual power cultivation was much higher than Xia ruofei ‘s.

Xia ruofei was shocked. Of course, Chen Xuan was not one of them. He brought Xia ruofei to the end of the Chain Bridge. The disciples guarding the Chain Bridge immediately bowed and greeted him.”Greetings, young sect leader!”

“Sect leader, are you free now?” Chen Xuan asked.

“Young sect leader, the sect leader has ordered that when young sect leader and this young master Xia arrive, they can go directly to the meeting hall. He is waiting there.” The disciple replied respectfully.

“Meeting hall?” Chen Xuan was taken aback for a moment, and a look of surprise appeared on his face. However, he quickly regained his composure and replied,”I understand.”

“This child greets father!” Chen Xuan brought Xia ruofei to a place about 10 meters away from the steps and stopped. He bowed and said,
