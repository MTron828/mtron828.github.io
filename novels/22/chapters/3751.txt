Chapter 3752: Treasure snatching in the magma (2)

Translator: 549690339

Was he really going to return empty handed? Xia ruofei felt a sense of helplessness.

So far, there was no problem with his safety. If he gave up on this cave, he could still return to the square relatively easily.

However, Xia ruofei was not satisfied.

He knew that since senior copper coffin had specifically pointed out this cave, it meant that there was definitely an opportunity here, and it should basically be within the scope of his ability.

He must have missed something. Xia ruofei said in his heart.

His greatest strength wasnt his talent for cultivation, but his psychological quality that had been trained during his military life. He had always been very calm when he encountered things, and the calmer he was, the calmer he was.

Xia ruofei quickly got rid of the negative emotions and calmly thought about the current situation.

It was unrealistic to explore the magma directly, so he ruled it out.

And using his spiritual power to investigate was obviously not feasible.

In fact, this had basically ruled out the possibility of finding clues directly through the magma Lake.

He could only rely on other aspects.

Xia ruofei shifted his gaze away from the lava lake and looked at the other parts of the cave

Xia ruofei was on high alert. He glanced at the watch on his spacesuit and saw that the outside temperature was about 200 degrees Celsius. He was further away from the lava lake. He knew that if he got any closer, the temperature would increase even more.

In reality, this temperature was already the spacesuits limit. However, Xia ruofei had put on an energy shield on the outside, so the spacesuit could still withstand it for the time being.

Of course, Xia ruofei didnt dare to step on the ground. He had been standing on the blue immortal sword.

He looked up at the lava lake and saw the red lava slowly rolling inside. From time to time, some bubbles would appear. Just looking at it was a bit shocking.

This was not a good place to stay, Xia ruofei thought.

He tried to release his spiritual power to check the situation in the lava lake.

Because the situation here was almost unobstructed, if there was any opportunity, it would probably be in this magma Lake.

However, Xia ruofeis spiritual power was quickly consumed the moment he came into contact with the lava. He could not go any deeper.

After a mere one or two meters deep, the consumption of spiritual power was already too much for him to bear.

At this depth of one to two meters, all he could detect was hot lava. He didnt find anything.

Although the lava lake was not big, it was at least a few dozen meters in radius. Even if it was one or two meters deep, Xia ruofei could not check it inch by inch. No matter how strong his spiritual power was, he could not support such a consumption.

Moreover, it was still unknown how deep this lava lake was. It was meaningless to check the surface of the lake.

Xia ruofei was at his wits end in this situation.

This lava lake was like a purgatory furnace. He couldnt just jump in to check it out, right? In such lava, the spacesuits protection was basically useless. Even a Yuan Qi protective shield would not be effective. If he had really jumped in, the only outcome would have been to turn into dust without leaving a trace.

It was unrealistic to explore the magma directly, so he ruled it out.

It was also impossible to use his spiritual power to investigate.

In fact, this had basically ruled out the possibility of finding clues directly through the magma Lake.

After a mere one or two meters deep, the consumption of spiritual power was already too much for him to bear.

At this depth of one to two meters, all he could detect was hot lava. He didnt find anything.

Although the lava lake was not big, it was at least dozens of meters wide. Even if it was one or two meters deep, Xia ruofei could not scan it inch by inch. No matter how strong his spiritual power was, he could not support such a consumption.
