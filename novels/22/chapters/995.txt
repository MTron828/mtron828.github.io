Chapter 996: Even a billionaire is scared (1)

Translator: 549690339

The call went through very quickly, and MA Xiong’s hearty and enthusiastic voice came through the receiver,””Xia Sheng, how are you?”

“Old Mr. MA, I feel full of vigor when I hear your voice!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it seems that you’ve been in good health recently!”

MA Xiong laughed and said,”that’s all thanks to Xia Sheng!” If it wasn’t for your miraculous hands of rejuvenation, I would have been living in the small box long ago!”

When MA Xiong had a sudden severe cerebral hemorrhage, his son, Ma Zhiming, and his daughter – in – Law, Tian Huixin, happened to be with Xia ruofei. It was Xia ruofei who had accompanied the two of them to Hong Kong overnight and used a solution of the spirit Heart Flower petals to pull him back from the gates of hell.

MA Xiong’s life was saved by Xia ruofei. Furthermore, Xia ruofei had a good relationship with Tian Huilan’s family, so MA Xiong was grateful and close to Xia ruofei.

“One is bound for good fortune after surviving a great disaster!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”old Mr. MA will definitely live to a hundred years old!”

“Hahaha! Since miracle doctor Xia has said so, I can rest assured!” MA Xiong said happily.

“Xia Sheng, is there anything I can help you with today?” he asked.

Xia ruofei hurriedly replied,”you’re too kind, old Mr. MA. I wouldn’t dare to accept your service!” However, I do have something that I need your help with. You’re highly respected in Hong Kong, and only you can help me with this!”

Xia ruofei’s polite words made MA Xiong very happy. He immediately asked,””Oh? Xia Sheng, tell me about it. As long as it’s within my means, I’ll definitely do my best to help!”

“I hope to hold an auction in Hong Kong, but the item is a little special ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Hahaha! Xia Sheng, I still have some influence in Hong Kong. No matter how special the auction item is, as long as it’s valuable, I’ll definitely help you!” MA Xiong said without hesitation. Then, he asked curiously,”xiasheng, what’s the special auction item you mentioned?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s dried abalone, the best dried abalone!” To be more precise, it’s a top – grade one – headed abalone!”

On the other end of the phone, MA Xiong fell silent.

It was not that Xia ruofei’s request was difficult for him, but he was so shocked by the news that he forgot he was on the phone with Xia ruofei.

One – headed abalone! This was something that only existed in legends. Even though MA Xiong was a billionaire, he couldn’t buy such a high – Quality abalone even if he had the money!

MA Xiong had lived for decades. He had been in the upper class of Hong Kong when he was young. However, even with his social status, he had only seen one – headed abalone two or three times in the past decades. Each time, there would only be one or two. He had only tasted one – headed abalone once!

Xia ruofei wanted to auction off a one – headed abalone?

“Old Mr. MA! Old master Ma!”

Xia ruofei’s voice brought MA Xiong back to his senses. He quickly said,””I’m sorry, Xia Sheng. Your news really shocked me, so I lost my composure ...”

“It’s fine, it’s fine. ” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”then ... About the auction ...”

“Xia Sheng, you’re not joking with me, are you?” Although MA Xiong knew it was a little impolite, he still couldn’t help but ask,”are you sure you want to auction off a one – headed abalone?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”Of course! How could I possibly make such a joke with you?”

“Then, the breed of the abalone ...”

“It’s an abalone!” Xia ruofei said without hesitation,”all the one – headed abalones I have are dried abalones made from high – Quality reticulated abalones!”

Many high – end three – headed abalones and two – headed abalones were reticulated abalones. MA Xiong was even more excited when he heard this. He immediately sensed the hidden message in Xia ruofei’s words.

“Xia Sheng, you mean ... You have more than one one one – headed abalone?” MA Xiong asked excitedly.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”old Mr. MA, to be honest, I have a total of 30 of these dried abalones. However, 25 of them are one – headed abalones. The remaining five are about 10 to 20 grams of difference!” We’re very close!”

MA Xiong was once again in shock.

When did one – headed abalones become so cheap that they could be produced in batches?

Twenty – five one – headed abalones? The other five were only ten or twenty grams away from the standard of a one – headed abalone.

MA Xiong felt like his brain was not working.

Fortunately, after Xia ruofei had treated him the last time, the spirit Heart Flower petal solution had cleared all the hidden dangers in his brain and even had a great nourishing effect. Otherwise, his cerebral vessels would have ruptured again in such a state of agitation.

However, MA Xiong was not dazed this time. He quickly asked excitedly,”Xia Sheng, can I send someone over to see the abalone? Don’t misunderstand, it’s not that I don’t trust you, but if we’re going to hold an auction, we’ll still need to confirm it first, and ... We’ll also need to collect some photos, videos, and the like of the auction items for some publicity ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”no problem!” You can send people over at any time, just come directly to the farm!”

“Alright then!” MA Xiong said. I’ll immediately give the order! As for the auction in Hong Kong, I’ve also sent people to prepare for it!”

MA Xiong had absolute trust in Xia ruofei. Besides, he had seen Xia ruofei take out many top – Quality truffles last year. Therefore, he was immune to Xia ruofei’s miracles.

“Old Mr. MA, thank you!” Xia ruofei said,”I’m not familiar with Hong Kong. Without your help, I wouldn’t be able to organize this auction!”

“Xiasheng, you don’t have to be so polite,” MA Xiong quickly said.”You’re helping our Hengfeng group!” It would definitely cause a sensation if so many top – Quality one – headed abalones were auctioned at the same time! By hosting this auction, we can also gain a lot of reputation!”

“Hahaha! This is a win – win situation!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Yes, yes, yes, a win – win situation!” MA Xiong also laughed.

The two of them discussed some more details and then hung up.

Xia ruofei did not plan to start the auction immediately. After all, it would take time to prepare and promote the auction. He also took the time to deal with some urgent work at hand so that he could have time to go to Hong Kong.

After Xia ruofei made up his mind, he got up and left the villa. He went to the chairman’s office in the complex.

The Dendrobium candids and baby salamander fish would be ready in the next two days. In addition, Paradise Farm, which was far away in Australia, would soon begin large – scale planting. Xia ruofei needed the administrative office to contact Australia in advance and calculate the required seeds. He had to make preparations in advance.

All these tasks had to be arranged, so Xia ruofei came to the office to deal with them.

He sat down in his office chair and was about to call Feng Jing to gather all the relevant people for a meeting when he heard a knock on the door.
