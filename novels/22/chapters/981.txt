No one would feel good about such a thing happening on the first day of business.

Tian Mingyi, on the other hand, crossed his legs and proudly looked at this scene in front of him. The corner of his mouth slightly curled up, and he said slowly,””Old Lu, I’ve said it before, a wise man submits to circumstances! Have you been living like a dog all your life? If you don’t even understand this, how can you be a store manager! You should go home early ...”

Manager Lu suppressed the anger in his heart and coldly looked at Tian Mingyi.

The two sides had already shed all pretenses of cordiality, and the other party’s intentions were even more obvious. Manager Lu no longer bowed down like before. If it wasn’t for the fact that there was no other way, who wouldn’t want to stand up straight?

Inspector Wu’s mouth twitched and he said,”brothers, check it out!” Principal Tian said that everyone should work hard today and he will treat us to supper later!”

“Alright!” The people from the safety supervision Department and the Environmental Protection Department all laughed and responded.

At this moment, a taxi stopped at the entrance of Ling’s private restaurant. Song Wei got out of the car and looked at the environment of the restaurant. She was interested.

As Song Wei was shopping with her best friend Zhuo Yiyi, she did not come with song Qiming. Instead, she took a taxi from Wanbao Plaza.

She strolled inside and was a little surprised.

This was a restaurant that Xia ruofei had personally recommended. Why did it feel like the service was so – so? This private restaurant was not like an ordinary hotel. This kind of antique building structure was more complicated. It was not normal for guests to not have someone to guide them on their first visit.

However, Song Wei didn’t mind. She walked around the wall and went straight inside.

Inspector Wu and the others were in the central room, ready to split up to “inspect” the place. When they saw someone walk in from the outside, they all looked over.

Tian Mingyi’s eyes lit up when he saw that it was a classic beauty with a graceful figure.

Song Qiming had just taken office in Sanshan city, so naturally, no one would know Song Wei.

In fact, at Tian Mingyi’s level, he could barely be considered as the second generation of an official. Even if Song Wei became more and more famous in the circle of the three mountains, he would not be qualified to come into contact with her.

Of course, Tian Mingyi did not forget his “proper business” just because a beautiful woman came.

So, he greedily glanced at Song Wei and said,””This beauty is here to eat, right? This shop is closed today, you can go back!”

Song Wei glanced at Tian Ming Yi indifferently and ignored him as she walked past him.

Tian Ming Yi smelled a fragrant wind passing by, but he couldn’t keep a straight face. So this beauty didn’t take him seriously at all!

Manager Lu also thought that Song Wei was one of the guests who had booked the room, so he quickly stepped forward and bowed,””Miss, I’m really sorry. The restaurant can’t be open tonight due to some unexpected circumstances. We will compensate the guests in each private room ...”

“Closed?” Song Wei asked with a frown. Why?”

“This ...” Manager Lu was a little hesitant.

Song Wei looked at the so – called “law enforcement officers” in various uniforms and suddenly understood.

“I’m in the flying Snow Pavilion’s private room that Mr. Xia has booked. Is he not here yet?”she said indifferently.

Song Wei knew that Xia ruofei could not have left after coming. If Xia ruofei had left because the store was closed, he would have called song Qiming to explain the situation before leaving.

Now that her father had not informed her of the change of location, it meant that either Xia ruofei had not arrived yet or he was already in the private room.

Manager Lu was also stunned when he heard the words “flying Snow Pavilion” and quickly said,”So you are a guest of the flying Snow Pavilion! Please come in! Mr. Xia is already here, I’ll get someone to take you there immediately ...”

Song Wei nodded her head lightly and smiled,”Thank you for your trouble ...”

Manager lü quickly beckoned for a waitress and asked her to lead Song Wei to the flying Snow Pavilion in the backyard.

Tian Ming Yi had also heard their conversation. Seeing that Song Wei was still walking in, he could not help but stand up and say,””Old Lu, what do you mean by this? Didn’t you hear the notice from inspector Wu? They actually let guests in? This is a public resistance to law enforcement!”

Tian Mingyi knew that the flying snow restaurant was booked by the two young men and women just now. That woman was the Vice President of lingji F & B, so when he found out that Song Wei was a customer of flying snow restaurant, the unhappiness in his heart was even more obvious.

Superintendent Huang’s face was dark as he said,”Manager Lu, there’s a problem with the attitude of your shop’s inspection! It seems like there’s a need to reorganize ...”

Song Wei did not go far. She turned around and asked with a frown,””Who are you people?”

“Can’t you see what kind of people we are?”Tian Mingyi said with a mischievous smile. Do you see the uniforms of our brothers? We’re the joint inspection team, and we’re conducting a surprise inspection of this shop!”

Song Wei looked at Tian Ming Yi and the rest with a meaningful look. She nodded and turned around to continue walking.

Tian Mingyi’s expression turned cold and he shouted,”stop!” Did you not hear what I said? This shop is closed today!”

Song Wei stopped in her tracks again and turned around to look at Tian Mingyi coldly.
