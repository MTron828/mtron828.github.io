Chapter 657: Stingray cultivation (3)

“Yes, President Xia!” Jiang Hua said,”director Xia, it doesn’t really matter if we give out the bonus or not. What I’m more concerned about is ... When will our fish arrive?”

Jiang Hua was very ambitious now and wanted to show off his skills quickly!

“Is the cultivation workshop ready?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

Jiang Hua stuck out his chest and said,”director Xia, everything is ready. At present, all the systems have been calibrated to the best state. The fish pond’s index parameters are also fully qualified.” In addition, the company also recruited ten workers for the cultivation workshop a few days ago. I’ve already conducted preliminary training for them, and they can start work at any time!”

Xia ruofei said happily,”that’s great!” Get ready to receive the fish!”

“Director Xia, will the fish be shipped over soon?” Jiang Hua asked in surprise.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”I’ve already contacted the fry. They’re just waiting for you!”

“Then what are we waiting for? Quickly take me to transport the fish!” Jiang Hua said impatiently.

“You don’t need to worry about this.” Xia ruofei laughed.”You just have to bring the workers to clean up the mess! I guarantee you’ll see the baby fish before noon!”

“Yes!” Jiang Hua said excitedly.

Today was the day that the project had been accepted. Xia ruofei then instructed Feng Jing to arrange for the finance department to finish the final accounts as soon as possible and settle the remaining payment.

Xia ruofei had never hesitated in this aspect. As long as there were no problems with the quality of the project, he would pay on time.

After thanking manager li once again, Xia ruofei drove the pickup truck away from the farm.

......

In the back of the pickup truck, there were a few large plastic boxes. Jiang Hua had specially prepared them for Xia ruofei to transport the fish.

These boxes were very thick, and they were both breathable and soundproof, which could effectively reduce the loss of Pomfret during the transportation process.

Xia ruofei went to the warehouse he rented in the city. He moved the boxes into the warehouse, carefully locked the doors and windows, and took out the spirit painting.

With a thought, Xia ruofei entered the space.

He didn’t go to the original space to disturb Xia Qing. Instead, he went to the river in the new space.

Xia ruofei first filled a few large boxes with water by the river. The water in the river and the space spirit pool came from the same source. Even the multi – layer purified water in the cultivation workshop could not compare to them.

Then, with a thought, Xia ruofei’s mind power quickly spread out and covered the entire River.

The situation of every salamander fish in the river entered Xia ruofei’s mind.

With a thought, the invisible spatial force gently wrapped around the kun fish and slowly brought them to the surface of the river.

This invisible force was very gentle, and the Ray fish did not notice it at all. It continued to swim in the small area. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

There were hundreds of water balls floating above the river, and each water ball had a salamander fish in it. It was a beautiful scene.

Then, the water balls slowly floated towards Xia ruofei and gathered in one of the large plastic boxes. They slowly sank into the water. There was no vibration throughout the entire process and the rays did not even realize that their environment had changed.

Xia ruofei did the same and quickly selected a thousand baby kun. In the past twenty days, the two baby kun had laid eggs again. Xia ruofei allowed the baby kun to grow to a certain size in the original space before moving them to the new space River.

After a while, Xia ruofei drove out of the warehouse. In the back of the car, there were a few large plastic boxes that were filled with a thousand sky – High salamander fish.
