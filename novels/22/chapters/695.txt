Chapter 696: Chapter 483 – final decision (3)

Since Xia ruofei had come to the beluga breeding workshop, he naturally had to take a look around. After looking at the fish ponds, Xia ruofei did not let Jiang Hua accompany him and asked him to do his own things.

Xia ruofei continued to stroll around the pomfrets cultivation workshop. Soon, he seemed to have unintentionally walked to the circulating pool.

The water in this large reservoir would go through multiple filtration cycles and be sent to each fish pond.

Xia ruofei used his body to block the view behind him and also the surveillance camera. He used a very secretive move to take a bottle of spirit Heart Flower petal solution and quickly poured it into the water reservoir.

This was a secret magical treasure that could ensure the rapid growth and tenacious vitality of the Pomfret! Xia ruofei would come over every once in a while to add some more.

With his skills, he naturally had a way to complete it without anyone knowing.

Moreover, as the boss, he would come over to inspect every once in a while, so naturally, it would not arouse any suspicion.

After adding the flower petal solution, Xia ruofei gestured to Jiang Hua in the control room and left the pomfrets breeding workshop.

Xia ruofei returned to the intersection and drove the pickup truck back to the small villa.

He looked at the time. There was still about an hour before dinner, so he decided to use this time to go to the spirit map world and make some arrangements for the herb garden.

After going upstairs and locking the door and windows, Xia ruofei took out the spirit map and entered the medium.

The small excavator he had bought was quietly placed next to the all – terrain vehicle, and behind the excavator was a large barrel of diesel.

Xia Qing was busy processing those seeds in the space.

......

He took over some of the empty plastic containers that Xia ruofei had left at the Archean realm. He fetched some spirit pond water and was currently soaking the seeds.

Seeing Xia ruofei come in, Xia Qing immediately put down the work in her hands and walked over quickly. She called out respectfully,””Master!” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Xia Qing, do you know why I didn’t let you cultivate the land first?” Xia ruofei asked.

“This subordinate does not know!” Xia Qing replied.

Xia ruofei pointed at the small excavator and said,””To do a good job, you must have sharp tools. It’s too inefficient to rely on you to excavate with your bare hands, so I bought an excavator!”

Xia Qing looked at the steel monster, which was even weirder than the all – terrain vehicle, and said in confusion,””Master, you’re saying ... This metal guy can dig?”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” And it’s countless times faster than you digging with your bare hands!”

Xia Qing looked at the excavator and still felt that it was unbelievable.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Xia Qing, I came here today to teach you how to use this excavator. After you learn it, you’ll have a powerful helper. The speed of opening up the herb garden will also be greatly accelerated!”

“Master, I ... I can also use this metal thing?” Xia Qing asked in surprise.

“Why can’t I? The machine is dead. As long as you learn how to operate it, you will naturally be able to use it!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll start teaching you how to use an excavator!”

Xia Qing quickly looked at Xia ruofei, afraid that she would miss some details and fail to learn.

Xia ruofei revealed a confident smile and said,””The first step ... Uh! Where’s the manual for this thing? I’ll take a look first!”

Xia Qing was speechless.
