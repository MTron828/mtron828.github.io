Chapter 1253: Getting on with serious business (2)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei glanced at Monica, took the agreement, and started to read it.

The important parts had been bolded, so Xia ruofei could easily find the key information.

1.55 million dollars!

Xia ruofei shook his head without thinking.””Monica, this price is too high! We’re friends, I can’t charge you so much money!”

This price was basically the same as a piece of white truffle that was about the same weight as the one at the auction. It seemed that Monica was referring to the auction price.

As expected, Monica’s lips curled up slightly as she said,””The 2.55 kg white truffle at the auction this morning was sold for 1.57 million dollars. I think the price I offered is very suitable.”

“That’s different. That’s an auction!” Xia ruofei said,”the auction price is affected by many uncertain factors. How can it be used as a reference? Besides, I’ve reserved this white truffle for you. If you’re going to sell it at an auction price, why would you look for me? Why don’t we just sell it at the auction?”

Monica smiled and shook her head.”Xia, feelings are feelings. Business is business. The two can’t be mixed together.” I can indeed make a bid at the auction, and our Grasso group can definitely afford more than 1.5 million dollars. However, if I make a bid, can you guarantee that I will be able to get that white truffle?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be speechless. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Although there seemed to be a lot of truffles being auctioned today, there were also quite a number of rich people attending the auction. Therefore, the competition for each truffle was quite fierce, especially for the White truffle, which was relatively heavy.

If Monica had participated in the bidding for the 2.55 kg white truffle in the morning, the final price might have gone up a lot.

Monica saw that Xia ruofei had stopped talking and smiled.”I was right, right? “So, our company is actually still at an advantage. Without any competitors, we can buy such a high – Quality white truffle at a more appropriate price ...”

Xia ruofei came back to his senses and said,””Something’s wrong! I almost got tricked by you! That’s not right. I reserved this white truffle for you, so it’s impossible for it to be auctioned. The nature of the two is different, and it can’t be measured by the auction price. Even if you want to use it as a reference, you can only use the general market price of truffles this year as a reference. ”

“Xia, I know you’re good to me.” Monica smiled and said,”but this is just a truffle acquisition business. I’m not representing myself, but the entire Grao group ...”

“Say no more. 1.3 million dollars!” Xia ruofei said without hesitation,”if you can accept this price, modify the agreement and print it out now. I’ll sign it immediately. If you still insist on the price of 1.55 million dollars, then I won’t sell this white truffle!”

Monica couldn’t help but be speechless.

Why was he being a scoundrel? Moreover, the seller insisted on lowering the price, and the buyer had no choice but to do so. How could there be such a strange thing?

Monica looked at Xia ruofei, and Xia ruofei stared back at Monica’s eyes. From his eyes, Monica could see his determination.

She smiled bitterly and said,””Alright, my man, I’ll listen to you ...”

Then, she found the price page on the computer and changed the price to 1.3 million dollars according to Xia ruofei’s request. Then, she printed out the page separately and replaced it with the corresponding page in the agreement.

Monica bound the agreement and handed it to Xia ruofei.””Can I sign now?”

Xia ruofei’s face finally revealed a smile. He readily took out a pen from the pen holder and signed his name on the seller’s position.

Monica also signed her name. Her English was written very elegantly and eternally, exuding a sense of elegance.

There were two copies of the contract.

Monica handed Xia ruofei one and smiled.””Alright, the deal is complete! I’ll get someone from the company to come and hand over the White truffle tomorrow. Before that, they’ll transfer the money to your account ... Oh, right, write down your bank account number for me. I’ll send it to the company tonight. You should be in Italy at this time ...”

Before Monica could finish her sentence, Xia ruofei had already picked her up by the waist.

“Ah ...” Monica cried out in shock.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”There’s still time to deal with these things tomorrow. Now that you’ve finished your business, it’s my turn to do my business.”

Monica laughed and said,””Xia, give me your bank account number!”

“We’ll talk later!”

“I haven’t turned off the computer!”

“You still care so much at a time like this?”

“Oh ... God ...”

A charming spring scene began to spread from the study room ...

The next day, when Xia ruofei woke up, Monica had already left his room, leaving only a few strands of golden hair on the pillow and a faint fragrance in the blanket.

Xia ruofei couldn’t even remember what time it was yesterday. He only remembered that Monica, who had gone limp, still asked him to write down his bank account number.

Xia ruofei turned his head and looked at the bedside table. The offshore company account that he had written on the note yesterday had indeed been taken away by Monica.

Another piece of paper was placed in the same position.

Xia ruofei took it and saw Monica’s familiar handwriting.

Xia, thank you for spending two wonderful and crazy nights with me, and thank you for the surprise. Someone will come to you with the agreement from last night. I’m going back to Italy today, and I’ll be flying back early in the morning. I’ll miss you and look forward to seeing you next time!

In the end, Monica even drew a sexy lip, which was probably drawn with lipstick.

Xia ruofei held the piece of paper and sat on the bed in a daze.

The experience of the past two days had undoubtedly been crazy. He had completely let go of his body and mind when he was with Monica.

He didn’t feel empty after having a good time. Looking at the beautiful handwriting on the note, a faint warmth gradually welled up in his heart.

His feelings towards Monica were very complicated. The first night of secret joy should have been based on desire, but this time, after being reunited after such a long time, that feeling seemed to have changed slightly.

Monica’s figure slowly appeared in Xia ruofei’s mind. Her every frown and smile, her sexy elegance, and her madness in bed ...

A warm smile gradually appeared on Xia ruofei’s face. He took another look at the note and solemnly kept it in the medium. To Xia ruofei, this was indeed a precious gift. Besides, such a piece of paper that could easily reveal a secret would only be safe if it was kept in the medium.

Xia ruofei composed himself, got out of bed, washed his face, and brushed his teeth. Then, he made a call to order breakfast.

On the balcony, Xia ruofei enjoyed the view of Port Victoria while enjoying the nutritious breakfast prepared by a Michelin star chef. He felt refreshed and felt that life was wonderful.

As soon as the service staff left with breakfast, Xia ruofei received a call from MA Xiong.

“Mr. MA, what’s the arrangement today?” Xia ruofei chuckled and asked,”are you going to the race track? Actually, I want to spend more time with Huanhuan!”

It was definitely not suitable for children to go to a crowded and fanatical race track.

“Xia Sheng, there’s a horse race this afternoon. Director Guo has contacted me. He wants to invite you to join him!” MA Xiong said with a smile.

“I have no problem with that!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”when I’m in Hong Kong, I’ll do whatever the host wants. I’ll follow your arrangements!”

“Hahaha! Xia Sheng is the most distinguished guest of the MA family. I’ll definitely entertain you well!” MA Xiong said,”but there’s something I can’t make the decision for you. You have to make the decision yourself.”

Xia ruofei’s smile froze and he asked curiously,””What’s the matter?”

MA Xiong pondered for a moment before saying,””There’s someone who wants to meet you. He can be considered an old friend of mine! But ... This is up to you to decide. If you don’t want to see me, I’ll go and reject you!”
