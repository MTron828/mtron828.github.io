Chapter 1836: Imparting cultivation technique (2)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei saw that Ling Qingxue was eager to try and quickly said,””Your control of true Qi is still very shallow. It’s best not to try it rashly, or you’ll easily lose control. In addition, when you really want to attack someone, you have to be careful with the use of true Qi. If you don’t control it well, it’s really easy to kill. Of course, the chances of you fighting with others are also very low. I’m just giving you a reminder. ”

Ling Qingxue nodded and said seriously,””Don’t worry! I’ll remember that!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””It’s already oneo’ clock, let’s quickly rest! I’m going to take a shower, you sleep first!”

“Oh ...” Ling Qingxue replied.

In fact, she was not sleepy at all. Her mind was very excited. However, she remembered Xia ruofei’s warning and could only suppress her thoughts of continuing to cultivate.

Xia ruofei came out of the shower and saw Ling Qingxue leaning against the head of the bed. She was still in high spirits. He couldn’t help but smile and say,”Why aren’t you sleeping! Staying up late was bad for girls ‘skin! Aren’t you afraid that you’ll get two dark circles tomorrow?”

Ling Qingxue giggled and said,”don’t you have the jaded skin ointment that you personally made?” What’s there to be afraid of?”

“That’s fine ...” Xia ruofei was speechless.

Ling Qingxue held Xia ruofei’s arm affectionately and shook it as she said,””Ruofei, I can’t sleep now anyway. Why don’t we just ...”

“I can’t cultivate anymore today!” Xia ruofei said firmly,”now is the time for you to build your foundation. If you advance too rashly, it will cause your Foundation to be unstable! It’ll be extremely disadvantageous to your future cultivation!”

Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”let me finish!” I didn’t say that I was going to cultivate today ... I was just thinking, since we can’t sleep, why don’t you tell me about cultivation? For example, what levels were there! What other famous experts were there! Or some interesting news, I really want to know ...”

“Alright, I’ll tell you if you want to hear it ...” Xia ruofei said affectionately.

The two of them lay on the bed in each other’s arms. Xia ruofei began to teach Ling Qingxue about cultivation, starting from the level of cultivation.

In fact, Xia ruofei did not have anyone to guide him. His cultivation knowledge was definitely not comparable to those from the famous sects. However, he had read many ancient books in the medium. In front of an absolute rookie, he was still qualified to guide him.

Ling Qingxue leaned comfortably on Xia ruofei’s arm and tilted her head, listening with great interest.

Xia ruofei talked for a full two hours. When he heard Ling Qingxue’s breathing becoming heavier, he lowered his voice. His low voice had a hypnotic effect, and Ling Qingxue quickly fell asleep ...

Xia ruofei carefully used his other hand to cover Ling Qingxue with the blanket. Then, he hugged her delicate body and closed his eyes.

The next morning, when Ling Qingxue opened her eyes, the sun was already shining into the room through the curtains. She drowsily touched the side of the room, but felt nothing.

However, Ling Qingxue was not surprised. Instead, she smiled. She knew that Xia ruofei must have woken up to prepare breakfast.

Ling Qingxue could even imagine Xia ruofei carefully getting out of bed and tiptoeing out of the door to avoid waking her up. Her heart was filled with warmth.

After washing up, Ling Qingxue put on her sleeping robe and slippers and went downstairs.

As expected, Xia ruofei was carrying a pot of thick porridge out of the kitchen. There were a few delicate side dishes on the table, and there were heart – shaped poached eggs on the plate.

Seeing Ling Qingxue coming down the stairs, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””You’re awake! The time is just right, come and eat!”

“En!” Ling Qingxue smiled sweetly and said,”RUO Fei, you’re the best!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’m touched!” Do you want a morning kiss?”

“Alright!” Ling Qingxue said.

She wasn’t embarrassed at all. She walked over, stood on her tiptoes, and kissed Xia ruofei on the cheek.

Xia ruofei shouted,”kissing the face is not sincere!” With such good weather and such a sumptuous breakfast, why don’t we have a French Kiss?”

Ling Qingxue’s face turned red and she said,”you’re pushing it!” I don’t want to ...”

Just as Ling Qingxue was about to walk towards the dining table, Xia ruofei suddenly grabbed her slender waist and pulled her in front of him. Ling Qingxue could not help but fall towards Xia ruofei. Then, Xia ruofei lowered his head and accurately kissed Ling Qingxue’s cherry lips ...

After a long time, Ling Qingxue escaped from Xia ruofei’s arms with a red face and said,””Bad guy! Another surprise attack ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said with satisfaction,””I’m showing you what the right morning kiss is! Wife, from tomorrow onwards, we’ll follow this standard operation!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“You wish!” Ling Qingxue rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei flirtatiously. Then, she walked to the dining table and started to enjoy the breakfast that Xia ruofei had personally prepared.

After breakfast, Ling Qingxue asked expectantly,””RUO Fei, can you teach me the first level of the” absolute beginning Heart Sutra “today?”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” But I have to go to the company headquarters first! I just moved there, and it’s not good for me, the chairman, to disappear all day ...”

“Ah?” Ling Qingxue was a little disappointed.

However, paradise Corporation was founded by Xia ruofei from scratch and was the center of his career. She could not ask Xia ruofei to not care about the company’s Affairs and just cultivate with her. That would be too selfish.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”don’t worry!” I’ve already arranged everything, it won’t delay your cultivation!”

Then, Xia ruofei caressed Ling Qingxue’s hair and said,””Before I go out, I’ll teach you the first level of the chant. Your job at home is to memorize the chant!”

Ling Qingxue’s mood immediately brightened.””Good! I’ll definitely remember it very quickly!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded,” The first level of the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” is much more complicated than yesterday’s entry – Level formula. It’s even more obscure and difficult to understand. I don’t expect you to be able to understand it, as long as you can rote and memorize this cultivation technique by heart, it will be fine! When I come back, I’ll explain it to you word by word. If you memorize the cultivation method in advance, it’ll help you deepen your understanding of it. ”

“I got it!” Ling Qingxue nodded her head.

Hence, the two of them went to the living room. Xia ruofei took a piece of paper and wrote down the first level of the “Scripture of the primordium origin”. He then read it from the beginning to the end with Ling Qingxue and gave her a rough explanation.

Then, Xia ruofei said seriously,””Qingxue, this cultivation technique must not be leaked to the public. You must remember that before I come back, this piece of paper must always be within your sight. You must also not take any pictures with your phone and you can’t reveal a single word to anyone. Do you understand?”

Last night, Ling Qingxue had listened to Xia ruofei talk about the general knowledge of cultivation. She was no longer completely clueless about cultivation. She knew the importance of this matter.

“Don’t worry!”She said with a straight face. Even if something unexpected happens, I’ll destroy this piece of paper at the first possible moment!”

Xia ruofei laughed,”I’m just giving you a reminder!” There won’t be any accidents on the farm. The security here is very tight, and little black and the others are guarding the yard. Don’t worry, just stay here and memorize the cultivation method!”

“En!” Ling Qingxue nodded.

Xia ruofei put on his coat. When he was about to leave, he thought for a while and turned back.”By the way, Qingxue, before I come back, don’t try to cultivate it, including the introductory cultivation technique from yesterday. Your true Qi has already met the minimum requirements to cultivate the” absolute beginning Scripture “. If I’m not by your side, it will be very dangerous if any accident happens during cultivation. You Must Remember This!”

“Don’t worry!” Ling Qingxue giggled and said,”you’re almost an old man, yet you’re still so naggy! I promise that before you come back, I will only recite the cultivation technique and do nothing else, is that okay?”
