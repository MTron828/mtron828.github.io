Chapter 1453: Staying overnight at the Ling family’s residence (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei received a lot of messages on WeChat. Other than Liang Weimin and some business partners, Liang Qichao, pang Hao, and other friends, including Wolf King and his old comrades in the Army, had also sent him well – wishes.

What touched Xia ruofei was that Grandpa Tang He, Tang Yitian and his wife, as well as MA Xiong’s family in Hong Kong, all sent him a message of blessing at midnight.

There was a time difference between United States and Australia and China. Tang He, Tang Yitian, and the others must have sent him a message on time.

Xia ruofei also saw a message in English. It was very simple, with only three words: “Happy Spring Festival.”

This was different from “Happy New Year.””Spring Festival” referred to the Chinese New Year, while the former meant “Happy New Year” in the world. In most cases, it referred to the Gregorian New Year, which was New Year’s Day.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile when he saw the sender.

This message came from far away Europe. It was from Monica.

Thinking of this foreign beauty who had had a few nights of fun with him, Xia ruofei’s heart wavered.

He quickly tapped on the virtual keyboard on his phone and replied to the messages one by one.

Most of the business partners greeted him out of courtesy. Xia ruofei also wrote a group message of thanks and well wishes and sent it back.

As for Tang He, Tang Yitian, and the others, including his old comrades and friends, Xia ruofei seriously replied to them one by one.

The reply to Monica was also very simple. Thanks! Miss U (thanks! I miss you!

Monica replied very quickly. There were no words. It was an emoji with a picture of a seductive red lips.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. This Little Vixen ...

It was already half past one in the morning when he finished replying to all the messages. He would still receive a few messages at this time. Xia ruofei turned off his phone and went to sleep.

At dawn, Xia ruofei’s biological clock made him open his eyes.

Even though it was the first day of the new year, Xia ruofei did not slack off. After a simple wash up, he sat cross – legged on the bed and felt the rich spiritual Qi of heaven and earth. He made the best use of his time to cultivate.

After finishing his cultivation, Xia ruofei opened the door and walked out.

Hu Zi’s mother was already preparing breakfast, and Lin Qiao, who stayed up until God knows what time last night, was still upstairs.

“RUO Fei, come over for dinner when you’re up!” Hu Zi’s mother said,”Qiao’ er usually sleeps until late in the morning. She went to bed so late last night. I don’t know what time she’ll wake up!”

“Godmother, Happy New Year!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Happy New Year, Happy New Year!” Hu Zi’s mother was also in a good mood. She said,”we’ll be eating leftovers today. Try to get over it!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”I know, I know. It’s the next year’s meal!”

This was also an old custom of the three mountains. No new rice was cooked on the first day of the first month of the lunar year. They had to eat the leftovers from the first night, which meant that they had more than enough food every year.

Of course, this was also something that Hu Zi’s mother had prepared in advance last night. It was not really leftovers.

China was so big, and the new year customs were different all over the country. For the three mountains, on the first day of the first lunar month, there was basically no sweeping, no dumping of garbage, no bathing, and no going far. In addition, one had to go to bed early at night, commonly known as “night lantern.” They were competing to see who slept early.

As a native of the three mountains, Xia ruofei naturally knew about these customs. Hu Zi’s mother did not have to bother explaining.

Although the breakfast was the New Year’s meal, it was still sumptuous. There were golden – fried taro rice cakes, Taiping rice noodles, and so on.

Soon, Xia ruofei finished a big bowl of rice noodles and a few pieces of taro cake. Hu’s mother saw that he was eating so happily and was genuinely happy.

Xia ruofei treated this place as his second home. The custom on the first day of the first lunar month was not to go far, so he might as well not go out and stay at home to chat with Hu Zi’s mother. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

When he was busy, he could only visit the forestry Bureau dormitory occasionally. There were not many opportunities to sit and chat without any disturbance.

Although she had taken very good care of the mother and daughter, Xia ruofei knew that it was far from enough. Especially after Lin Qiao went to the University on Egret Island, Hu Zi’s mother would feel even more lonely and would need the company of the old man even more.

This was also the reason why she was never tired of helping Lin Yue ‘e pick up Nan Nan, even though it was tough.

Lin Qiao didn’t go downstairs until 10 O’ clock.

Hu ‘Zi’s mother urged her to wash up while she herself went to heat up the breakfast.

Xia ruofei looked at Hu Zi’s mother, who was busy, and sighed. What a pity!

Xia ruofei stayed in the daguantian neighborhood for the entire day on the first day of the Lunar New Year. That night, Hu Zi’s mother urged them to go back to their room to rest early. This was because, according to the customs of the three mountains New Year, they had to sleep early on the first day of the Lunar New Year. The earlier the better.

For young people who were used to staying up late, this was really a little uncomfortable.

Xia ruofei didn’t know if Lin Qiao would obediently go to sleep after going back to her room. She probably hid under the blanket and secretly played with her mobile phone. Since he didn’t feel sleepy at all, he simply sat up to cultivate at midnight.

On the morning of the second day of the first lunar month, Hu Zi’s mother had already prepared a gift for Xia ruofei. Today, Xia ruofei was going to visit Ling Xiaotian. The second day of the first lunar month was the day that the son – in – Law of the three mountains would visit.
