Chapter 1766: A dream start (2)

One of the photojournalists ‘family members had been seriously ill recently, so he was physically and mentally exhausted.

He had the most profound feelings. He found that the negative emotions that had made him breathless these days seemed to have reduced a lot, and he became more cheerful.

And this change was completed unknowingly.

This made everyone feel very magical.

Xu lang paused for a moment before he smiled and said,””I believe everyone has the answer. That’s right, this is the aura I was talking about!”

Xu lang seemed to be in the mood to chat. After he finished, he continued,””I think many of you may still have some questions. The Feng Shui pattern that we usually talk about, isn’t it mainly about the design of the building, the placement of items, and so on? This is still a wasteland, so how can the Feng Shui have such a magical effect?”

“Yes, why?” A reporter asked.

He was really entranced by Xu Lang’s words and subconsciously followed his train of thought.

Xu lang smiled and said,”actually, this is what I wanted to talk to everyone about today. Good feng shui comes from nature!” In ancient times, Feng Shui rarely had artificial arrangements! Fengshui was just like women. Those who were born with average looks would never be able to dress up as beautiful women no matter how they decorated themselves. She’s a natural beauty, and even if she doesn’t dress up, she can still cause the downfall of a city. ”

After hearing Xu Lang’s metaphor, everyone smiled knowingly.

Xu lang continued,”so, real good Fengshui can’t be obtained just by setting up a trap.” For extremely good Fengshui houses, office buildings, and so on, one must first choose natural good Fengshui. If you choose a bad feng shui, no matter how you set it up, you’ll be like a village girl. No matter how you dress up, you won’t be able to cause the downfall of a city. ”

Then, Xu lang said firmly,””I’m sure that this place has natural good feng shui!”

The audience suddenly burst into a round of warm applause. Zhao Yongjun, song Rui, and the others were so excited that their palms were red.

Xu lang was too awesome. Zhao Yongjun and the others didn’t even dare to dream of such support.

Xu lang smiled and said,”of course, on the basis of natural Fengshui, man – made arrangements can also play the role of adding flowers to the brocade.” So, if Mr. Zhao and Mr. Xia don’t mind, I’m willing to be the cultural environment consultant for this project and give you some personal opinions on the design layout!”

Zhao Yongjun was stunned, because happiness came too suddenly.

Xia ruofei’s reaction was faster. He stood up and said,””Uncle Xu, we’ll wake up laughing in our dreams if we can invite a God like you. How can we reject you?”

Zhao Yongjun also came back to his senses and quickly said,””Thank you for your support, uncle Xu!”

Xu lang stood on the stage and said with a smile,”Then it’s settled! By the way, I’m very optimistic about your project. I hope to be the first person to buy a member of your club!”

Zhao Yongjun was about to be hit by this happiness. He didn’t even think and said,”No problem! It’s our honor that uncle Xu has taken a liking to our paradise gathering!”

Xia ruofei also said without hesitation,””Lifetime membership fee free! After the Club is open, you can come over at any time if you want, uncle Xu!”

Xu lang was like a gold – lettered signboard. He was personally acting as a cultural and environmental consultant, and he even took the initiative to apply for a membership card. This was more useful than a month’s advertisement on the National television.

As for the previous rumors, with Xu Lang’s strong support, they had long become a joke.

It wouldn’t be long before the incident at the groundbreaking ceremony spread throughout the upper circles of the capital. By then, who would have any concerns?

Not only would they not have any concerns, but once they thought about how Xu lang was so optimistic about the club, it was easy to imagine how the people in the upper – Class circle would rush to the club like ducks.

Xu lang was a weather vane! It was like betting with a gambling master in a casino. Since Xu lang was so impressed by the Fengshui here, it was definitely not wrong to get a membership card here. As for the membership fee, who would care about such a small amount of money when they were at their level?

Xu lang laughed.”There’s no need for it to be free. I’ll just pay the normal membership fee.”

“Then we’ll have to pay you a consultation fee!” Xia ruofei laughed.

Xu lang was stunned for a moment before he laughed out loud.”Then we’re ... Even? I’m using my work to exchange for membership, so it’s considered my labor!”

Xia ruofei said seriously,”how can we not owe each other anything?” Uncle Xu has helped us so much, how can the membership fee offset it? We owe uncle Xu!” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Xu lang laughed heartily and said,””Mr. Xia is indeed an interesting person! Then it’s settled!”

Then, Xu lang said,”that’s all I want to say to everyone. I’ve wasted everyone’s precious time. Thank you, everyone!”

Xu lang bowed slightly and returned the microphone to the emcee. He then turned around and walked off the stage.

A round of enthusiastic applause rang out from the audience. The applause only subsided when Xu lang returned to his seat.

At this moment, the emcee followed the original plan and said,””Dear guests and reporter friends! Today’s groundbreaking ceremony has come to an end! “When the guests exit, please go to the east side. We have prepared a gift for each guest and reporter. You can receive it at the exit passage! Once again, thank you for coming! Goodbye!”

After the event ended, no one was in a hurry to leave. The guests were all chatting with each other. Xu lang, Lu Shengsi, and a few other mystics were the most popular. They were surrounded by many people.

Zhao Yongjun whispered to Xia ruofei,””Ruofei, why do I feel like I’m in a dream? Isn’t uncle Xu’s support for us a little too much?”

“You’re still not happy that she’s being nice to you?” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“I didn’t mean it that way. It’s just that ... This is too unexpected! I even feel that it doesn’t make sense!” Zhao Yongjun said,”hey, ruofei, do you think it’s because of your friends in Hong Kong? Uncle Xu just said that some of your friends in Hong Kong are very close to him, and he even mentioned you before coming to China ...”

Xia ruofei also felt that this was the reason. He nodded and said,””Maybe! It’s also possible that the special Fengshui of this land has piqued uncle Xu’s interest!”

At this point, Xia ruofei winked at Zhao Yongjun. Zhao Yongjun immediately understood and the two of them smiled happily.

Xia ruofei said,”don’t think too much. Uncle Xu definitely has no ill intentions towards us. Besides, this matter is only beneficial to us. There’s no harm!”

“That’s right! For our paradise society, this is simply a dream – like opening!” Zhao Yongjun said with a smile.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”I’m actually quite interested in uncle Xu. I can see that you’re so happy that you’ve gone crazy. Is uncle Xu that influential?”

Zhao Yongjun looked at Xia ruofei with a strange expression and asked,””You don’t know who uncle Xu is?”

“I’ve heard of it, but I don’t know much. ” Xia ruofei shrugged his shoulders and said,”I’m not particularly interested in the metaphysics of Feng Shui.”

Zhao Yongjun rolled his eyes and looked around before telling Xia ruofei about uncle Xu’s story.

After Xia ruofei heard this, he couldn’t help but secretly click his tongue. So this person was really a legendary figure!

Zhao Yongjun only told two stories, and Xia ruofei even knew the main characters.

One of them was yang ruocheng, the head of royal entertainment and an entertainment tycoon, whom Xia ruofei had met at the truffle auction.

Uncle Xu had accurately predicted that yang ruocheng would encounter a major change, and that year, yang ruocheng’s business had indeed suffered a serious setback due to debt problems and was on the verge of bankruptcy. At the same time, yang ruocheng also developed westward under uncle Xu’s guidance. He went to the Middle East to do finance and foreign exchange. In two or three years, Dongshan Mountain Rose again, and then the entertainment aircraft carrier royal entertainment company was established.

Since then, yang ruocheng had been very respectful to uncle Xu.

In addition, it was said that once, uncle Xu took a look at Xie Feng, a singer who was not famous at that time, and told yang ruocheng that this person would definitely become famous in the future, and asked him to sign him immediately.

Yang ruocheng had long respected uncle Xu like a god, so he signed the contract without hesitation and focused on nurturing him.

Later on, Xie Feng became extremely popular and became the absolute pillar of royal entertainment. Not only did he earn a lot of money for royal entertainment, but it also made royal entertainment famous.

As for the second story, it was even more legendary. The protagonist of the story turned out to be the world – famous richest man, li ...
