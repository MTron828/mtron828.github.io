Chapter 1451: An unexpected encounter (1)

Translator: 549690339

“So be it if they want to check drunk driving!” Xia ruofei said nonchalantly and slowed down the car.

“It’ll be bad if they really check for drunk driving!” Ling Qingxue said anxiously,”you drank so much white wine last night. Even if you’re conscious, the alcohol content in your body must have exceeded the limit!”

What you’re afraid of will come.

As the police got closer and closer, Ling Qingxue could already see the breathalyzer in their hands.

What should I do?

Ling Qingxue subconsciously turned around to look. At that moment, Ling Xiaotian’s drunkenness had kicked in and he was sleeping soundly in the back seat. He was completely unaware of what was happening outside.

“Ruofei, let’s change seats!” Ling Qingxue said hurriedly,”there’s still time!”

In fact, Ling Qingxue had also drunk a few glasses of half – Lon. However, she was still hoping that she would be fine after a few hours. At least, compared to Xia ruofei, the possibility of her being detected to have excessive alcohol content would be much lower.

Xia ruofei laughed,”silly girl!” I told you I’m fine, there’s no need to change seats ...”

It would be terrible if they changed seats! He was sure that he would be fine, but what if Ling Qingxue’s alcohol content was over the limit? wouldn’t that be a disaster for the new year?

While they were talking, the car had already stopped beside the police. It was too late to change seats.

Ling Qingxue was extremely anxious. Her hands were clasped together tightly as she looked at the police officers outside the car window uneasily.

Xia ruofei laughed as he rolled down the window and stuck his head out. The chassis of the Knight XV was very high, so he had to lower his head slightly to see the police outside.

“Police! You’ve worked hard! He’s still on duty on the road during the new year!” Xia ruofei said.

The police officer heard Xia ruofei’s voice and couldn’t help but look up. He said in surprise,””Xia ruofei? Why are you here?”

The police officer looked up and Xia ruofei naturally saw her face. He couldn’t help but laugh and said,””Officer Qin? Aren’t you a detective? Why are you on duty on the road? Have you adjusted your work?”

This police officer was the policewoman Qin Xiao Yu who had dealt with Xia ruofei a few times.

The police officer next to Qin Xiao Yu had smelled the smell of alcohol when the car window was rolled down and thought that they must have been caught for drunk driving.

Now that he saw that the pilot actually knew Qin Xiao Yu, he could not help but hesitate and whispered,””Captain Qin, why don’t we ... Let it go?”

He felt that if he let the driver blow on it, he would most likely be caught red – handed, and that would put Qin Xiao Yu in a difficult position. He might as well pretend that he had not seen this car and just let it go.

Qin Xiao Yu naturally also smelled the strong smell of wine. She glared at her subordinate and said,””Do you know what you’re saying? Don’t forget your status!”

Their entire police team had been sent to the road to support the traffic police. This was a unified operation in the Bureau to prevent anyone from taking risks on New Year’s Eve and driving after drinking.

In fact, every year during the new year, drunk – driving was on the rise. Even though the crackdown on drunk – driving was unprecedented, some people still had the mentality of getting lucky.

Qin Xiao Yu was famous for not recognizing her own family. Not to mention that her friendship with Xia ruofei had not reached that stage, even if it was her good friend, if she committed a crime, she would never show favoritism.

That was why the police officer’s words made her feel a little angry.

Xia ruofei was still chuckling.”By the way, how’s fluffy four? Don’t let it suffer, or I’ll take it back!”

Si Mao was one of the dogs that Xia ruofei kept in the medium. Last time, under Qin Xiao Yu’s request, Xia ruofei gave her a dog, and this dog was si Mao.

Qin Xiao Yu’s expression was slightly stunned. Si Mao had grown up in the spirit map space and its intelligence was much better than the average dog. In the past few months, she and Si Mao had developed a very good relationship.

At this time, Qin Xiao Yu remembered that si Mao was a gift from this guy in front of her, if he was confirmed to be drunk driving ... Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Qin Xiao Yu could not help but feel conflicted, especially when she saw the gentle smile on Xia ruofei’s face. She, who was jokingly called The Iron Lady by her colleagues, could not help but hesitate.

However, she quickly hardened her heart and said with a straight face,””I’m on duty now. We’ll talk about unrelated things later!”

After she finished speaking, Qin Xiao Yu motioned for her subordinate to take out the breathalyzer and then saluted Xia ruofei as a routine.””Comrade, it’s a routine inspection. Please cooperate and blow some air!”

“He really doesn’t recognize his family!” Xia ruofei teased.

Qin Xiao Yu bit her lips secretly and personally took the breathalyzer from her subordinate and handed it over. Although she didn’t say anything, her meaning was obvious.

Xia ruofei laughed and puffed up his mouth to blow at it.

At this moment, Ling Qingxue did not dare to look in that direction anymore. Her heart was beating very fast. When she saw that Xia ruofei knew the police officer on duty, she still had some hope in her heart. She did not expect that the female police officer would still insist on testing the alcohol content.

Qin Xiao Yu secretly sighed and took the breathalyzer to take a look at the results. She was stunned.

The test result was 8mg/100ml, which was far from the 20mg drinking driving standard. As for the 80mg drunk driving standard, it was far from being enough.

This result surprised Qin Xiao Yu, but she was secretly relieved.

Qin Xiao Yu saluted Xia ruofei and said,””Thank you for your cooperation!”
