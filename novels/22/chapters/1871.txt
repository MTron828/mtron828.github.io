Translator: 549690339

Peach blossom Corporation had posted a piece of news on its official website, saying that the administrative Director, Ms. Dong Yun, and the factory director, Xue Jinshan, had led an inspection team to Qingyuan county yesterday afternoon for a business inspection. The main purpose was to inspect the site selection for the upcoming peach blossom pharmaceutical factory branch project.

The news also pointed out that the Qingyuan county party Committee and the county government attached great importance to this matter. The Secretary personally came out to receive the inspection team, and the two sides had a pleasant and warm discussion.

At the same time, peach blossom company’s official Weibo also released a piece of news. Compared to the official website’s steady post, the Weibo platform’s news was more down – to – Earth.

The Weibo post wrote,”my friends!” The Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory was preparing to open a branch factory, expand its scale, and increase its production! Yesterday, the expedition team had already started to choose the site for the investigation. We will be going to more places in the next few days. Chang tai, Qing Yuan, Ping Zhang ... Which one do you like?

The Weibo post was filled with 9 pictures, all of which were taken during the inspection of Qingyuan county yesterday afternoon.

At the same time, the blog mentioned five to six places, but there was no mention of Changping County.

When Guo Zhiguang reported to him, Liu haojun still didn’t believe it. When he personally turned on his computer and saw the contents of the peach blossom company’s official website and Weibo, he immediately became furious and almost smashed the monitor ...

Liu haojun gritted his teeth and shouted,”what are they trying to do?” Ah? Are you playing us like monkeys? Director Guo, immediately inform the fire department, safety supervision Department, Health Department, and Environmental Protection Department to conduct a joint inspection of Taoyuan farm today! I don’t believe I can’t deal with them!”

Guo Zhiguang hesitated for a moment. He wanted to say something but stopped.

Liu haojun glared at him and said, “What’s wrong? My words don’t work, do they?”

“No, no!” Guo Zhiguang quickly waved his hand and said,”Secretary Liu, I personally think ... We should calm down. Paradise Corporation is a star company and even the provincial leaders have a say in it. If we are too aggressive and too obvious, I’m afraid ...”

There was one more thing that Guo Zhiguang didn’t say out loud, as he was afraid of angering Liu haojun.

The Tao Yuan company was not afraid of the local government’s attack. Now that their headquarters had moved out, they were only left with a farm in Changping County. To be honest, even if the farm couldn’t continue operating, as long as the pharmaceutical factory was still there, the Tao Yuan company would still make a lot of money every day.

Furthermore, it was now in high demand. Which County around Sanshan city didn’t have a large piece of worthless land? As long as the peach blossom company showed any intention, they would definitely rush to give the company all kinds of discounts and ask Xia ruofei to open the farm and the pharmaceutical factory over to them.

Liu haojun snorted coldly and said,”our County’s functional Department is carrying out the normal supervision and supervision of the enterprises within our jurisdiction. Is there a problem? Even if they were some bullsh * t star enterprise, could they escape the supervision? Could it be that their farm is a place outside the law?”

Guo Zhiguang didn’t think much of it. Who would be fooled by these words? which of the leaders above were easy to deal with? Using such an excuse, wasn’t this an insult to their intelligence? If this matter were to blow up, there would be no way to clean up the mess in Changping County.

Guo Zhiguang could only advise him patiently,””Secretary Liu, I just don’t think it’s necessary to fight with them. They started a company to make money, and the local government’s purpose is to introduce funds and increase taxes to solve employment problems. I think it’s easy for both sides to find a cooperation point. “I think there must be some reason for this situation that we don’t know about. Otherwise, why would they go to other places directly when they don’t know what preferential policies the county is offering before the two sides have even contacted each other? You must know that two days ago, they were the ones who took the initiative to reveal their intentions to us! This is too abnormal, there must be something wrong with this ...”

After Liu haojun heard this, his anger gradually calmed down, and his expression became uncertain.

He stared at Guo Zhiguang and asked in a low voice,””You mean ... That person?”

As Liu haojun spoke, he turned his gaze to the government office building not far away. It was self – evident who the “person” he was referring to was.

“I can’t rule out that possibility,” Guo Zhiguang said cautiously. After all ... She was the first one to contact Tao Yuan company. She thought that it was a duck that was delivered to her mouth, but it turned out to be useless, so she might not be able to guarantee ...”

Liu haojun’s face darkened. He waved his hand and said,””I know, you can go back first! I’ll think about how to deal with it!”

After Guo Zhiguang left, Liu haojun smoked two cigarettes in the office. Then he stood up suddenly and walked out of the office. He went straight to Secretary Zeng jianzhang’s office.

Liu haojun was eagerly looking forward to this political achievement, so he and Guo Zhiguang kept a close eye on the peach blossom company’s movements and got the news as soon as possible. In contrast, Zeng jianzhang didn’t pay much attention to this matter, so he didn’t know that the peach blossom company had begun to inspect the other counties.

After hearing Liu haojun’s words, Zeng jianzhang couldn’t help but feel a little shocked.

“Comrade haojun, are you sure you didn’t make a mistake?” he asked, his eyes wide open.

“Secretary Zeng! Their official website and Weibo have already posted the news, how could they be mistaken?” Liu haojun said,”I even went to the Qingyuan government network. They also immediately released the news that the peach blossom company was investigating Qingyuan county! There’s no mistake about this!”
