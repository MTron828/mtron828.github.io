Chapter 1475: I’ll help you say hello_1

Translator: 549690339

Yao na glanced at director Jiang and director Wang, who were talking to Zhuang Cheng. Seeing that they weren’t paying attention to them, her face darkened. She put the glass on the table and said,””Yuanyuan, how can you be so insensible? Was it that easy to ask the Leader for help? Shouldn’t they liven up the atmosphere first? He can’t wait to ask for the leader’s help, that’s too eager for quick success!”

“But ...” Xu Yuanyuan said,”I’ve drunk a lot of wine, and it’s getting late ...”

At the dinner party today, a bottle of Drunken Eight Immortals wine that cost 888 Yuan had become the first choice for many people during social gatherings. At the same price, the taste was even better than those famous white wines.

She had already opened the second bottle. Thinking of this, Xu Yuanyuan couldn’t help but feel her heart ache. Her and Zhuang Yan’s actual monthly salary was less than 7000 Yuan, but today’s meal had cost them a few thousand Yuan.

The key was that they had no idea what was going on.

“Are you feeling heartache over the money?” Yao na glanced at Xu Yuanyuan and said sarcastically,”who doesn’t need money to do things these days? You can’t even bear to have a meal, what else do you want to do?”

“Sister – in – Law, I didn’t mean that. I just ... I just wanted you to mention me to chief Wang when the time is right ...” Xu Wanwan said with a frown.

“I know what I’m doing!” Yao na said.

Then, she ignored Xu Shuyuan and immediately raised her glass with a smile. Her expression changed faster than turning a page in a book because director Jiang raised his glass at her.

Seeing their brother and sister – in – Law standing beside the two leaders, Zhuang Yan and Xu Yuan Yuan looked at each other and saw a trace of helplessness in each other’s eyes.

Xu Yuanyuan and Zhuang Yan felt uneasy at the social gathering. They were not used to it.

Under Yao NA’s instructions, Zhuang Yan went to pay the bill in advance. When he saw the number on the bill, his heart ached even more.

The key was that he had spent so much money, but there was no progress at all. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

When Yao NA’s social interaction was about to end, she casually mentioned Xu Yuanyuan’s postgraduate entrance examination to bureau chief Wang.

Chief Wang nodded while picking his teeth. He laughed and said,”Hmm ... It’s a good thing to be a graduate student ... I’ll go back and understand the situation ...”

Yao na thanked Xu Yuanyuan for saying such a useless sentence and even asked Xu Yuanyuan to come over and give her a toast.

In the end, Yao na didn’t mention this matter again until the end of the dinner. Bureau chief Wang and director Jiang naturally wouldn’t take the initiative to make a promise. Instead, they talked about dirty jokes as if no one else was around, completely ignoring the two ladies in the room.

Xu Yuan Yuan felt like she couldn’t hold on any longer and wanted to escape immediately.

When they finally had their fill and everyone was ready to leave, Xu Yuan Yuan heaved a sigh of relief.

A group of people walked down the stairs. The more Yuan Yuan thought about it, the more depressed she felt. She had spent so much money and treated the two leaders to a meal with a smile, but in the end, there was no result. It was just a light – hearted perfunctory sentence.

Xu Yuanyuan finally couldn’t help but walk up to bureau chief Wang and ask,””Chief Wang, about my postgraduate entrance examination ...”

At first, director Wang was stunned. Since Yao na wasn’t paying attention to him, he had completely forgotten about Jian Jia. Then, he said in an official tone,””Little Xu! Didn’t I tell you? I’ll go and find out more about that matter of yours. ”

“But don’t get your hopes up,” he continued,”since there’s a rule on the number of working years, you’d better follow it!” Otherwise, if everyone wanted to further their studies, who would be able to work? Isn’t the unit in a mess?”

Xu Yuanyuan was stunned. She had treated him to a good meal, but not only did he not make any progress in his postgraduate entrance examination, but he was also criticized?

Yao na quickly walked over and said with a smile,””Chief Wang, Yuanyuan has just graduated from school and is still young. Please don’t take it to heart!”

“I’m not angry,”director Wang laughed and said,” since you’ve spoken up yourself, why would I be angry?” However, young people are still a little too impatient. There’s no harm in training for a few more years in the unit!”

“Yes, yes, yes ...” Yao na quickly agreed.

Then, she pulled Yuan Yuan to the side and said unhappily,””Yuanyuan, what’s wrong with you?”

“Sis – in – Law, this director Wang doesn’t want to help at all!” Said Xu Yuanyuan. Just now in the private room, he kept playing Tai Chi and didn’t answer directly at all!”

“How do you want him to answer you directly?” Yao na said sarcastically,”you want him to Pat his chest and promise that he will help you? Who Do You Think You Are? Don’t you understand that leaders always leave some room for discussion?”

“I ...” Xu Yuan Yuan was speechless.

However, she just couldn’t understand. Bureau chief Wang didn’t have any sincerity at all, so why did Yao na interpret it in a different way?

Yao na continued,”Yuanyuan, how can chief Wang not be angry when you keep asking him questions?” It was almost done, but if it’s ruined now, then you can only blame yourself!”

Xu Yuanyuan was stunned. She had no idea that Yao na had already started to push the blame away.

In fact, Yao na didn’t support Xu Yuan Yuan’s postgraduate studies at all. She felt that women should just stay at home and take care of their husbands and children. Especially when she heard that Xu Yuan Yuan was going to study and that Zhuang Yan had to help Xu Yuan Yuan take care of the elderly at home, she was even more against it.

That was why Yao na didn’t mention anything about Xu Yuanyuan in the private room today. Instead, she was very concerned about her husband, Zhuang Cheng, going to the provincial Department of Finance for an exchange.
