2496 Flying to Spain (1)

When Xia ruofei parked his car in the underground parking lot of the peach blossom mansion and took the elevator to the first floor, he found the coaster arranged by the company waiting in front of the building.

Although Xia ruofei had arrived earlier than the agreed time, the other employees who were on the same flight as him to Spain were earlier than him. Dong Yun was already waiting in front of the building. Xia ruofei was the last one.

Xia ruofei dragged the computer case and walked faster. He smiled at the employees and said,””I’m sorry! Sorry to keep everyone waiting!”

“Chairman, it was us who were so excited that we didn’t sleep last night! They’ve all come to the company this morning!” A girl with a ponytail said.

This girl was shi wen, who had only managed to grab a penny from the red envelope in the group the day before yesterday. She had a lively personality and was usually the joy of the team. Besides, Xia ruofei, the chairman, did not put on any airs, so she would not be submissive in front of Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”so I’m the one who harmed everyone!” If I had known earlier, I would’ve let everyone take the commercial plane there. ”

“I didn’t say that!” Shi wen quickly said.

Xia ruofei laughed and scolded,”look at your useless faces!” Get in the car!”

With that, Xia ruofei took the lead and got into the car with the boarding machine. Dong Yun and the employees also got into the car one by one. The electric door of the Toyota Coaster slowly closed with a beep. The car started smoothly and drove out of the city.

Sanshan city’s airport was located in Changping County. From the city to the airport, one had to take the winding highway and then the airport Highway. The whole journey took about 40 to 50 minutes.

Most of the people in the team were young people. It was their first time traveling abroad, and they were going to take the legendary Gulfstream plane this time, so they were all excited. The whole journey was full of laughter and laughter.

Xia ruofei and Dong Yun were sitting side by side. He felt very relaxed when he saw the young employees talking and laughing happily. In fact, he was about the same age as these employees, and some of them were even a few years older than him. However, his experience over the past few years had made him more mature than these young employees who had just entered the workforce a few years ago.

“President Dong, have you arranged for the four employees?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Don’t worry!”Dong Yun smiled and nodded. Everything has been arranged according to your instructions. “They set off for the capital city yesterday. The direct flight from the capital to Barcelona is about 3 am this morning. It’s just that the time is a little unfriendly, but they will definitely arrive in Barcelona before us! “Moreover, from San Shan to Jing city and from Jing city to Barcelona, the two shipping companies have booked business class for them. The comfort level of the long – distance flight is still guaranteed.”

“That’s good. ” Xia ruofei said,”by the way, they arrived early. Did someone pick them up in Barcelona?”

“It’s all arranged!” Dong Yun smiled and said,”you’re a Big Boss, so you don’t have to worry about these small things! A few days ago, you were criticizing factory manager Xue for being so detailed! How come when it comes to you, you seem to be even better?”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”You’re right, President Dong. I’ll humbly accept your criticism!”

“I’m just joking with you. I know you care about your employees!”Dong Yun said with a smile.

About 40 minutes later, Xia ruofei’s coaster arrived at the airport in Changping County and stopped in front of the private jet building.

Liu An was already waiting for Xia ruofei in front of the private plane building. He knew that there would be more passengers this time, and it was an overseas trip, so he had brought the crew to the airport in advance to prepare. He asked the second captain, Zheng Daming, to make the final flight preparations while he came to the private plane building to wait for Xia ruofei and the others.

With Liu An’s help, Xia ruofei and the others quickly completed the security check, border inspection, customs inspection, and other inspection procedures. They successfully entered the restricted area of the airport. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Paradise was parked in the parking lot next to the private jet building, so after the group left the private jet building and walked a short distance, they could see the public jet, paradise, glistening in the sun.

The paint coating of the peach blossom was very distinctive. In addition to the big LOGO of the peach blossom company, the body of the plane was also covered with fresh and green peach blossom vegetables and delicious peach fruits. When the employees saw the distinctive features of the peach blossom company on the plane, they could not help but feel a sense of pride.

They were all young people, so they didn’t deliberately suppress their emotions. Seeing this, they all shouted and quickened their pace, and in the end, they basically all jogged.

After arriving at the plane, the employees took out their mobile phones and took pictures of paradise. Of course, a few girls who loved to look pretty also took selfies.

When Xia ruofei, Dong Yun, and Liu An arrived at the plane, shi wen could not help but exclaim,””Chairman, let’s take a group photo! The sky was so blue today! It’ll definitely look great if you take a picture in front of the plane!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”sure!” Captain Liu, call Captain Zheng and the others down as well! Everyone, let’s take a family photo!”

The blue sky, white clouds, streamlined business planes, a group of young employees brimming with youth, and the crew members wearing flight and flight uniforms. Everything was so beautiful under the sun.

One of the employees had brought a tripod. He fixed his phone on the tripod, set the delay setting, and then ran to everyone. With the sound of the shutter clicking, this beautiful moment was captured.
