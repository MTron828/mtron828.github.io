Chapter 267: My wife, I’m coming!_1

After Xia ruofei left the medium, he went to the farm to patrol. In the greenhouse, Cao tieshu and his workers were carefully taking care of the growing vegetables. When he saw Xia ruofei, Cao tieshu excitedly reported the situation of the vegetable greenhouse. After the seeds that had been soaked by Xia ruofei had sprouted, they grew much faster than similar vegetables even in the outside world. Each of them was growing very well. Xia ruofei had even specifically instructed them to plant the vegetables green and not use any fertilizers or pesticides. Even so, there were no worm holes on the vegetables. In other words, after seed soaking and watering with a very small amount of flower petals, the pest control of these vegetables did not need to be worried at all. Xia ruofei felt a sense of achievement as he looked at the neat rows of vegetables in the greenhouse, as if they were soldiers being reviewed. To be honest, the profits from growing vegetables were insignificant to Xia ruofei. However, his goal was to build a high – end brand. High – end food brands had to have a rich variety, whether it was ordinary vegetables, fruits, truffles, or other high – end food that might appear in the future. Only by covering daily ingredients and high – end premium products could the brand’s popularity continue to expand. And it was precisely these daily ingredients that could expand the brand’s popularity and influence. It was not feasible to be a widow, it had to be fully developed. This was the thought that Xia ruofei had been following. Xia ruofei acknowledged the work of Cao tieshu and the other workers. After giving them a few words of encouragement, he went back to the construction site. As usual, manager li was personally guarding the construction site. The entire construction site was also in full swing. The workers each had their own duties, and each one of them was agile and skilled. One look was enough to tell that they were experienced construction teams. Liang Qichao was still very concerned about Xia ruofei’s Affairs, and manager li naturally spared no effort in his work. He put himself in the farm’s shoes in many places and tried to save costs while maintaining quality and quantity. In addition, in order not to interfere with the farm work and cause damage to the factory’s road environment, manager li also specifically asked the construction team to open a temporary side door here, so that all trucks and slag trucks could enter and exit from the side door. The first floor’s cement board had already been built. Some workers were watering and maintaining the cement board, while other workers were building scaffolding, cleaning the site, loading and unloading building materials, etc. In short, there was not much work on the main building, but the staff were not idle. He had used the scientific method of coordination to the extreme. Xia ruofei was very satisfied. He told pang Hao to order some food and wine from the county in the afternoon to reward everyone when they finished work in the evening. Xia ruofei returned to the villa after walking around. Now, only Xia ruofei and ye Lingyun lived in the villa. After Hu Zi’s mother returned to the city, ye Lingyun also took on a part – time job as a chef. He was the one who took care of the meals. Xia ruofei and ye Lingyun had lunch together. Then, without taking a break, they left Taoyuan farm in their pickup truck. He found a factory that specialized in making barbed wire fences and ordered some fences that could be assembled. Xia ruofei was going to set up a plot of land in the new space, which was about one and a half mu, and seal it up with barbed wire to allow the Hornets to breed and live. Therefore, he had to add metal windows on both the inside and outside of the wire fence. Xia ruofei’s plan was to form an area of 30 meters by 30 meters with a height of about 10 meters. The top of the area would be made of steel bars and covered with a wire fence of the same standard. Xia ruofei had ordered a fence of medium quality. With the addition of the top steel frame and other materials, the total cost was about 20000 Yuan. Xia ruofei paid the deposit and gave the address of the warehouse he rented to the manufacturer. He asked them to call him when they were done and send it to the warehouse directly. After setting up the fence, Xia ruofei was ready to return to the farm villa to take a look. He wanted to find some time to plant the wild Dendrobium candids that he had found at laoyan mountain two days ago in his interspace. As Xia ruofei was on his way back, his phone rang. Xia ruofei slowed down the car and picked up his phone. When he saw that it was his future father – in – Law, Ling Xiaotian, calling, he quickly put on his Bluetooth Earphone and answered the call. “Uncle Ling!” Xia ruofei said. “Ruofei, did you forget something?” Ling Xiaotian asked. Xia ruofei was stunned. Was his father – in – Law unhappy because he had not visited him these few days? He had been very busy the whole time. Besides, the last time in Ling Qingxue’s room, if it wasn’t for Ling Qingxue’s “relatives” coming, he would probably have done something outrageous. At that time, Ling Qingxue had shyly said that she would let Xia ruofei do whatever he wanted next time. Xia ruofei had asked Ling Qingxue out twice, but she had not turned up either time. Hence, Xia ruofei was too embarrassed to pay her a visit. This was to avoid Ling Qingxue’s awkwardness. At the same time, he did not want to be seen as a lecherous person in his girlfriend’s eyes. At the thought of this, Xia ruofei said,”uncle Ling, the farm has been very busy these past two days, so ... Is there anything I can help you with?” Could it be that there’s something wrong with the blood Dragons?” Ling Xiaotian smiled bitterly,”you brat, you’ve really forgotten everything!” To think that I’ve been looking around for information these past few days!” “Ah?” “Drunken Eight Immortals!” Ling Xiaotian reminded him in a bad mood,”do you remember what you promised me the last time?” Xia ruofei slapped his forehead and said,””Aiya! I really forgot about it. Uncle Ling, I’m really sorry ...” The last time they had a drink, Ling Xiaotian had a lot of admiration for Xia ruofei’s “improved” Drunken Eight Immortals. He even had the intention to cooperate with Xia ruofei to acquire the Dingfeng winery that produced Drunken Eight Immortals. The two of them would manage this improved liquor together. At that time, Xia ruofei had said that he would bring the mass – produced version of the Drunken Eight Immortals to Ling Xiaotian as soon as possible and would only make a decision after he had tasted it. Xia ruofei had been busy for a few days, and he had forgotten about it after his trip to Mount laoyan. Xia ruofei was naturally embarrassed to forget the first task assigned by his future father – in – Law. “Kid, you don’t seem to be very reliable ...” Ling Xiaotian said,”this is a business worth tens of millions, can you put in more effort?” Xia ruofei quickly smiled apologetically and said,”uncle Ling, it’s all my fault ... How about this?” I’ll give it to the person from your company who’s here to pick up the vegetables tomorrow morning and ask him to bring it to you as soon as possible. ” “Let’s not wait until tomorrow. If you’re free, come over now!”Ling Xiaotian said. I’m at home. ” “Uh ... I’m free, I’m free!” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”Please wait a moment. I’ll leave now!” “Good, good, good! Ruofei, remember to bring a few more bottles!” Ling Xiaotian said with a smile. He wasn’t really angry and Xia ruofei had admitted his mistake so nicely. He naturally wouldn’t blame Xia ruofei. “No problem!” Xia ruofei said readily. After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei sped up and drove back to Taoyuan farm. After returning to his room and locking the door and windows, he took out the spirit painting scroll and entered the medium. He found an empty porcelain bottle and went to the area where the wine jars were stored. He filled up five bottles of Drunken Eight Immortals, which were not fused with any exotic flower petals. Then, he calmly sealed the wine jar again. The time flow in the Suan ni area was 30 times slower than the outside world. Xia ruofei did not have to speed up in order to save time. After leaving the realm and putting away the painting, Xia ruofei found a bag and put the five bottles of wine in it. Then, he quickly went downstairs, got into the Knight XV, and drove towards the Qingjiang villa area in the city. On the way, Xia ruofei’s mind was filled with thoughts. He would definitely be able to see Ling Qingxue once they reached Ling Xiaotian’s Villa. It had been so many days, her ‘relatives’ should have left by now, right? Did that mean that he had the chance to get intimate with her in her room today? It was a little inconvenient to have a “father – in – Law” at home, but uncle Ling didn’t seem like the kind of person who would spoil the mood. He would probably take the initiative to avoid going to the company, right? Thinking of this, Xia ruofei felt that the evil fire that he had been suppressing for the past few days seemed to be on fire again. Thinking of Ling Qingxue’s graceful body and her long, seductive legs, Xia ruofei’s eyes were filled with passion. Wife, I’m coming ... ~
