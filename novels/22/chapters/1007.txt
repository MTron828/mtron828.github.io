Translator: 549690339

Song Rui had learned how to scheme ... Xia ruofei could not help but find it funny.

As expected, the two of them still had one last chance to clear the stage. This time, the two of them stood at the starting point together. It was Zhuo Yiyi who had taken the initiative to suggest that she would clear the stage with song Rui.

Song Wei also noticed this and turned to look at Xia ruofei in surprise.

The first obstacle was similar to the plum blossom dome. She had already played it three times before, so Zhuo Yiyi was also very familiar with the route and rushed over it with great strides.

Then, she didn’t move forward but stood there and waited for song Rui. Although they couldn’t hear her clearly from a distance, they could still see that she was encouraging song Rui.

Very quickly, song Rui had also successfully crossed the plum blossom dome. Just as he was about to jump onto the middle platform, Zhuo Yiyi even took the initiative to reach out and pull him.

“Uncle song Rui is so cunning!” Song Wei could not help but comment.

“You can tell?” Xia ruofei chuckled.

Song Wei glanced at Xia ruofei and asked,””You already saw through it, right?”

Xia ruofei laughed.”Just now at the entrance of the hotel. After you guys went in, this kid asked me for a razor to shave. I felt that something was wrong.”

Song Wei’s face revealed a trace of worry as she said,”Yiyi grew up in an ordinary family. I’m afraid that she and uncle song Rui ...”

Xia ruofei interrupted her and said,””The eight words haven’t even taken shape yet! Why are you so worried?”

“Yiyi is my best friend!” Song Wei said,”I don’t want her to get hurt ... Don’t be fooled by her carefreeness. She’s very innocent when it comes to love.”

“I can tell. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be so defenseless against song Rui ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“You’re still talking!”Song Wei said coquettishly. You’re also helping the evildoer ...”

“This is called the happiness of an adult, alright!” Xia ruofei said,”song Rui is different from before. Besides, Zhuo Yiyi is your best friend. This guy knows what’s important. He definitely wouldn’t play with her feelings.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“I hope so ... I don’t want Yiyi to get hurt ...” Song Wei nodded.

“I understand.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”don’t worry! I’ll find a chance to talk to song Rui. ”

“Thank you!” Song Wei said sincerely.

Xia ruofei turned to look at Song Wei and said,””Eldest niece, why are you being so polite with me?”

Song Wei was embarrassed and said, “Who’s your niece?”

Xia ruofei said matter – of – factly,”song Rui is my best brother. You’re his niece, so you’re my niece too.” That’s what Secretary song said the other day ...”

“If you keep talking ... I’m too lazy to talk to you!” Song Wei said angrily.

Xia ruofei laughed out loud and the two of them turned their attention to the race track.

While the two of them were talking, Zhuo Yiyi and song Rui had already worked together to reach the last stage.

At this moment, the two of them were climbing up. This time, song Rui also exerted his strength and agilely climbed up the last high platform. Then, he laid down and reached his hand down, pulling Zhuo Yiyi up the high platform together.

The two of them had successfully worked together to break through. Zhuo Yiyi was jumping up and down in joy and even hugged song Rui in excitement.

Seeing this, Song Wei couldn’t help but shake her head and said,””This silly girl ...”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Song Wei, I suddenly thought of something. If Zhuo Yiyi and song Rui really get together, wouldn’t you have to call her aunt?”

Song Wei was stunned ...

Xia ruofei laughed as he stood up and walked towards Zhuo Yiyi and song Rui.

Only then did Song Wei come back to her senses. She stomped her feet and quickly followed after him.

Zhuo Yiyi’s flight was at half past six in the evening, so after they had their break, the four of them left the water park and prepared to find a place to eat.

Xia ruofei was more familiar with this area. He drove them to a seafood stall not far from the airport.

Along the way, Zhuo Yiyi was still excitedly talking non – stop, especially about the heroic feat of their fourth successful joint effort. She even pulled song Rui along to obtain his proof.

After the two of them had worked together before, song Rui wasn’t as reserved as before. He smiled and echoed Zhuo Yiyi’s words.

Xia ruofei and Song Wei sat in the front row and looked at each other. Song Wei shook her head and thought,”This silly girl was really slow ...

Soon, they arrived at the seafood stall.

Xia ruofei ordered a bunch of seafood, including the most famous clam, scallops, oysters, shrimp, and so on.

Xia ruofei had to drive, and Song Wei was still recovering, so neither of them could drink.

However, Zhuo Yiyi said that seafood had to be paired with beer. She looked down on the two people who did not drink. Then, she called the waiter over and ordered a draft beer, ready to drink with song Rui.

Song Rui naturally did not reject her offer. He even laughed and poured Zhuo Yiyi some wine.

Soon, the seafood was served. Xia ruofei and Song Wei ordered fruit juice, while Zhuo Yiyi and song Rui drank beer.

They were all young people, so they naturally chatted freely. The food stall had a wide view, with a beach in front of them and a boundless sea further ahead. The environment was quite good, so the atmosphere of the meal was also very good.

Zhuo Yiyi had always been an easy – going person. After the meal, she had already become familiar with Xia ruofei and song Rui, and they naturally exchanged WeChat messages.

Xia ruofei clearly saw a flash of joy in song Rui’s eyes. He couldn’t help but find it funny. When had young master Song ever been so careful when he wanted to chase a girl?

However, this also showed that song Rui really cared about Zhuo Yiyi, who had fallen in love at first sight. He wasn’t just playing around like he used to.

Xia ruofei felt a little relieved. Of course, he knew that even if song Rui and Zhuo Yiyi were to get together, they still had a long way to go.

The biggest obstacle was undoubtedly the pressure from the family.

In a wealthy and influential family like the song family, song Rui was the eldest son and grandson. It was definitely not allowed for him to find a daughter from a humble family. Yingluo, the song family had already arranged for Tian Huilan’s daughter, Lu You, to marry him. Only a marriage of equal social status through political means would be considered the most suitable by the elders of the song family.

Xia ruofei could foresee how much resistance and difficulty song Rui would face.

Whether he could overcome these difficulties would depend on song Rui’s determination. Xia ruofei had no idea.

At a little past FiveO’ clock, the four of them had already had their fill.

Zhuo Yiyi rushed to pay the bill, and the group went out and got into the car. Xia ruofei then drove towards the airport.

On the way, Zhuo Yiyi’s phone beeped with a WeChat notification.

After she swiped on her phone to check, her face turned pale. She, who had been chattering non – stop for a long time, became a little quiet.

“Yiyi, what’s wrong?” Song Wei asked, concerned.

“I’m fine!” Zhuo Yiyi pouted.

Song Rui frowned slightly and asked,””Did you encounter any difficulties? Maybe everyone can help you!”

Zhuo Yiyi glanced at song Rui and said,””Uncle, if your grandfather is really elder song, he’ll definitely be able to help me ... But now ... Let’s forget it!”

Song Wei couldn’t help but turn to look at Zhuo Yiyi in amusement. This girl was really ... If she found out that song Rui’s grandfather was really elder song, she wondered what kind of expression she would make.

“What’s the matter? Who sent you a WeChat message?” Song Wei asked,”Yiyi, if you’re unhappy, just tell me! Do you still treat us as friends?”

“Gina sent it ...” Zhuo Yiyi said dejectedly.

“Gina?” Song Wei was stunned for a moment before she asked,”the one from the Faculty of Arts? When did you add her on WeChat?”

“It was during the interview that day!” Zhuo Yiyi pursed her lips and said,”she was the one who insisted on adding me!”

“What did she send?” Song Wei asked.

“What other content could it be?” Zhuo Yiyi sighed and said,”he’s just showing off to me ... Sigh! Let’s not talk about such unhappy things! I’ll just continue looking for a job after I return to the capital. It’s no big deal!”

“Hey! Don’t stop halfway!” Song Rui asked,”what is it? I still have a few friends in Beijing, they might be able to help you!”
