Chapter 634: Inspiring people (1)

He grabbed the herbs, weighed them, and brewed them ...

Xia ruofei was already very familiar with this process. The brewing process of the heart – nourishing soup was relatively simple. It was not difficult for Xia ruofei to control the heat. Soon, a bowl of steaming medicinal soup was ready.

Xia ruofei looked at the bowl of medicinal soup and was very excited.

This could become the ray of hope for thousands of families with autism!

When the medicine had cooled down a little, Xia ruofei lifted the bowl and gulped it down in one go.

The unique bitter taste of Chinese medicine filled his mouth, and at the same time, it had a faint fragrance.

There was no excruciating pain like being stabbed by a knife and a needle when he took the body tempering soup.

It did not have the warmth of the spring breeze when he drank the pregnancy soup.

After the medicinal soup entered his stomach, it seemed as if nothing had happened.

However, Xia ruofei could feel a cool sensation on his head. It was a very weak feeling. If he did not try to feel it, he might have missed it.

It was as if his entire brain had become much clearer.

Xia ruofei picked up a Chinese medicine book and started reading.

He quickly felt the difference.

......

The meridians, identification, and the subjects that were usually difficult to understand seemed to have become much easier today.

In simple words, his learning efficiency had increased a lot.

Xia ruofei could vaguely guess the reason why the heart – nourishing soup was included in the booklet. Yingluo was also an auxiliary artifact!

Xia ruofei flipped through the Chinese medical theory book in his hand unhurriedly. The feeling of clarity in his mind lasted for almost an hour before it gradually subsided.

After the obvious refreshing effect disappeared, Xia ruofei could still feel a slight improvement. Although it was very weak, if he took it for a long time, the improvement effect should be good.

The nourishing soup’s function as an “auxiliary artifact” was undoubted, and it didn’t do any harm to the human body. However, whether it had any therapeutic effect on autism and whether it would take effect quickly was still unknown.

However, Xia ruofei was still full of confidence and anticipation. After all, from the description of the medicine, the heart – nourishing soup was very effective.

Although the world’s medical field couldn’t solve this problem, and Chinese medicine for treating autism was the result of many parents ‘desperate attempts, everything in the spirit map space couldn’t be explained with common sense. The contents in the booklet were all fine works, and this couldn’t be measured by normal medical laws.

Xia ruofei decided to start the experiment immediately.

He had boiled two portions of the heart – nourishing soup at once. After pouring the other bowl of medicinal soup out of the claypot, Xia ruofei thought for a moment, took out a vacuum – sealed bag, and divided the bowl of heart – nourishing soup into two portions.

This was naturally considering Chengcheng’s young age, so the medicine was reduced by half.

Xia ruofei left the spirit map space and went downstairs to drive the Knight XV to Hengfeng hotel in the city center.

Half an hour later, Xia ruofei rang the doorbell of the business Suite where Xue Biyun was staying.

Xue bi Yun opened the door and was stunned when she saw Xia ruofei. She quickly stepped aside and said,”Doctor Xia is here! Please come in!”

Yesterday, Xia ruofei had left three days “worth of medicine. Xue bi Yun thought that Xia ruofei would only come back after three days.

As Xia ruofei walked in, he smiled and asked,””Aunt Xue, Chengcheng should have taken the third Chinese medicine, right? How’s the situation now?”

“Doctor Xia, I haven’t had time to feed him this Chinese medicine this afternoon!” Xue bi Yun said. It’s hard to feed Chengcheng, so I just coaxed him to finish feeding him. I’m going to give him the medicine in half an hour. ”

Xue bi Yun revealed a bitter smile as she spoke. All these years, she had been taking care of Chengcheng by herself. It could be said that she was the person who understood Chengcheng the most, but even so, taking care of him in daily life, such as eating, going to the toilet, and so on, was still very tiring.

If it was someone who didn’t understand Chengcheng’s temper, they wouldn’t be able to take care of him.

Xia ruofei nodded.”Okay. I’ll change the medicine later. I’ve already brought it over.”

As Xia ruofei spoke, he took out two sealed Chinese medicine bags and handed them to Xue bi Yun, saying,”Drink one for lunch and keep the other in the refrigerator. Feed him after dinner.”

Xue bi Yun took the medicine bag and asked curiously,”Doctor Xia, why did you suddenly change the medicine? The Chinese medicine you gave me yesterday, although I only took it twice, I think it already has some effect. In the morning, Chengcheng and I had eye contact a few times! This has never happened before!”

In fact, Xue bi Yun wasn’t sure if this was her illusion. For so many years, every time she went to seek medical advice, she would be filled with hope, but in the end, she would return disappointed.

Chengcheng had made eye contact with her a few times today and she was naturally very happy. However, she was afraid that it was just a coincidence, so she didn’t tell Xia ruofei.

She couldn’t help but bring it up when Xia ruofei suggested a different Chinese medicine.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Aunt Xue, yesterday’s prescription was exactly the same as the one Huanhuan took. After I went home yesterday, I thought about it for a long time. I made some improvements to yesterday’s prescription based on the reality of Chengcheng’s condition. So, let’s try the effect of the improved prescription first.” If it’s not ideal, it won’t be too late to exchange for the old formula. ”

“I understand, doctor Xia, I’ve troubled you ...” Xue bi Yun nodded.
