Xia ruofei was also very satisfied with the results of these two days.

The level of the Taixu xuanqing formation was very high. Originally, with Xia ruofei’s current cultivation in the array Dao, he could not set it up. However, the special terrain of the Peach Blossom Island had formed a natural formation. All he needed to do was to take advantage of the situation and activate the formation successfully. Naturally, the difficulty was reduced by a lot.

Even so, it still took a lot of Xia ruofei’s energy.

The arrangement of the formation had to be in accordance with the terrain. The natural mountains, rivers, cliffs, and precipices of the Paradise Island were all part of the formation. Even the magnetic field of the island was an important factor in the formation.

There were too many factors to consider for a formation of this level.

Xia ruofei had racked his brains. During this process, he had gained a lot of insight into the array Dao.

He looked at the drawing placed on the wooden box, his heart filled with a sense of achievement.

If Li Yifu wasn’t here, he would have taken out a bottle of wine from his space to celebrate.

Even though it wasn’t time to celebrate yet, he had undoubtedly completed the most difficult part of the work.

Xia ruofei rested for a while and sat down again. He took out a new piece of paper and started to write a construction plan.

With the blueprint of the core formation, Xia ruofei had a clear idea of how to construct each position.

The process of formulating the plan was very smooth. He almost didn’t stop, writing and drawing without a moment’s rest.

Xia ruofei only stretched and stood up when the sun started to rise.

A stack of detailed construction plans had appeared on the “table”.

Xia ruofei, who had stayed up for two consecutive nights, still looked very energetic. The excitement of getting closer to success made him temporarily forget about his mental and physical fatigue. For someone at refined Qi level 9, it was almost negligible.

Xia ruofei tidied up the drawings and construction plan, then looked at benilatti, who was obediently staying in the warehouse, and asked,””Did Wang Boshan contact you?”

Liu Qingfeng had sent people to bring benilatti here yesterday. However, the situation was different from what Liu Qingfeng was worried about. Xia ruofei did not need to spare any energy to look after him. It was no exaggeration to say that benilatti was even more loyal than Li Yifu.

“Reporting to Mr. Xia!” Benilatti quickly stood up and said respectfully,”I haven’t received a call yet.”

As Li Yifu was here, Xia ruofei had instructed benilatti not to call him ‘master’ but to address him as Mr. Xia.

Xia ruofei nodded. He had been keeping in touch with the people in the capital. Wu Qiang reported that Wang Boshan went to the courtyard in liuhai Lane again. Seeing that Xia ruofei had not returned home, he left in disappointment.

As for the three mountains, Xia ruofei had also asked Lei Hu to keep an eye on them. Once Wang Boshan and the old man in the long robe, who was suspected to be Zheng Yongshou, appeared near the company, Lei Hu would report to him immediately.

From the current situation, it seemed that the two men from the star Seizer sect were still in the capital, and after being refused the door twice, they hadn’t made any drastic moves.

However, Xia ruofei was not sure how long their patience would last.

In addition, Xia ruofei was most concerned about how many people knew about the Peach Blossom Island. It was reasonable to say that a natural formation like this was comparable to a heavenly abode, or even much stronger than an ordinary sect’s base. Even if the star Seizer sect had obtained this information, they should have strictly sealed off the information and controlled the scope of the information. Otherwise, if other sects found out about it, there would definitely be a bloody battle.

The last thing Xia ruofei wanted to see was the news that the Peach Blossom Island was protected by a natural formation. If that happened, trouble would come knocking on his door.

Moreover, with his current strength, whether he could protect the Paradise Island was still unknown.

After all, based on the information he had, there were at least golden core cultivators in the cultivation world on earth. For example, Luo Qingfeng, the sect leader of the star Seizer sect, who had just broken through to the Golden core realm not long ago, was not considered to be one of the top cultivators in the cultivation world.

Xia ruofei gathered his thoughts and said,””If Wang Boshan contacts you, you must deal with it calmly as I taught you. Don’t let it slip.” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Understood!” Benilatti said,”don’t worry, Mr. Xia! I’ll be careful!”

“I repeat, if Wang Boshan asks you if you have seen me on the Peach Blossom Island these few days, what would you say?” Xia ruofei asked indifferently.

“I must deny it!” Benilatti said,”I also want to take the initiative to tell Wang Boshan that apart from a portion of the personnel who returned to Paradise Island early, the rest of the people are still carrying out the completion of the project according to the established plan. There are no abnormalities.”

Xia ruofei nodded and continued to ask,””What if Wang Boshan asked you to continue providing more information about Paradise Island?”

Benilatti said without hesitation,””Agree to his request, and raise the price of the information by 20%!”

Xia ruofei then asked a few more questions that Wang Boshan might have raised. Bainilatti answered them smoothly.

These were all things that Xia ruofei had taught bainilatti in advance. He was indeed very firm in carrying out Xia ruofei’s orders. He had memorized the “standard answers” of these questions very well.
