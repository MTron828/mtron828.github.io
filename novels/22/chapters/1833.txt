In fact, the spiritual Qi in a spiritual crystal would not leak out under normal circumstances. Otherwise, after a long time, the spiritual Qi inside would have been lost.

Furthermore, Ling Qingxue would not be able to sense the spiritual energy in the spiritual crystal before she truly started cultivating.

However, it was easy for Xia ruofei to release the spiritual Qi from the spiritual crystal with a little push.

In a short while, Ling Qingxue’s surroundings were filled with extremely pure spiritual Qi. In such an environment, she was able to find a sense of Qi. In addition, her affinity with spiritual Qi was already at a high level, so it was naturally easy for her to find it.

After about ten minutes, Ling Qingxue shouted excitedly,””Ruofei, I can feel it! It’s like a warm current, and it’s a little itchy when it brushed past my body ...”

Xia ruofei’s eyebrows twitched. He knew that Ling Qingxue would have an easy time in the beginning stage of cultivation, but he was still surprised that she could sense Qi in such a short time.

However, he quickly regained his senses and shouted,””Don’t stop. Try to absorb this spiritual energy into your body and circulate it in your meridians according to the introductory art!”

The introductory mantra of the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” also had a Qi circulation, but the circulation route was very simple, and it did not involve many meridians. Of course, it would also pass through the dantian. The purpose was to let the beginners familiarize themselves with the spirit Qi as soon as possible and store part of the spirit Qi in the dantian.

“The moment I spoke ... That feeling disappeared!” Ling Qingxue said, a little dejected.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it’s normal!” It’s mainly because you’re not familiar with the spiritual Qi yet. As long as you concentrate again, you’ll be able to sense their existence very soon! But this time, don’t be distracted. You must try your best to guide the spiritual energy into your body and complete the Qi circulation according to the meridian route in the introductory art! When your dantian is able to retain a trace of spiritual energy, you will be considered to have completely passed the entrance test!”

“Understood!” Ling Qingxue said, full of fighting spirit.

Seeing Ling Qingxue close her eyes again and concentrate on feeling the spiritual energy around her, Xia ruofei smiled and walked to the lazy sofa at the side. He changed to a more comfortable position and lay down.

This time, after about seven to eight minutes, Xia ruofei felt the spiritual energy around Ling Qingxue start to flow slowly. A trace of spiritual energy was also absorbed into Ling Qingxue’s body.

The amount of spiritual energy was very small. Perhaps Xia ruofei’s usual breathing would have a few times more spiritual energy than it. However, to Ling Qingxue, it had a symbolic meaning.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but sit up straight and pay attention to Ling Qingxue’s condition.

From her facial expression, Ling Qingxue looked very relaxed, but at the same time, she was also very serious. Xia ruofei knew that Ling Qingxue must be fully focused at this moment. She was trying her best to control this small wisp of spiritual Qi and try her best to let it move according to the meridian route of the introductory formula of the “Taichu questioning Heart Sutra”.

After a while, Xia ruofei felt a trace of genuine Qi escaping from Ling Qingxue’s body. As expected, Ling Qingxue’s first attempt had failed.

The path of cultivation was full of difficulties and obstacles. It was equally difficult at the beginning. Even the most talented person could not have a smooth journey.

Ling Qingxue didn’t give up. She didn’t even take a break. She immediately started her second attempt.

This time, she was able to sense Qi even faster and successfully guided a wisp of spirit Qi into her body.

This attempt still ended in failure, but the progress had been made.

The third time, the fourth time ...

Ling Qingxue was getting closer and closer to success. Xia ruofei had been quietly observing from the side the whole time and did not interfere to help.

The first step of cultivation had to be taken by one’s own self. This was a step of extraordinary significance.

Finally, on her eighth attempt, Ling Qingxue managed to control her spiritual energy and complete a full circulation.

An almost imperceptible wisp of true Qi had also been produced in her dantian. This was the transformation of spiritual Qi. After true Qi was cultivated, it would stay in her dantian and not dissipate.

Even if it was consumed, as long as there was enough spiritual Qi to replenish it, the dantian would produce an equal amount of true Qi again.

Only after cultivating the first wisp of true Qi could one truly step onto the path of cultivation.

Ling Qingxue opened her eyes and looked excited.

She threw herself into Xia ruofei’s arms and said excitedly,””Ruofei, I’ve succeeded! I’ve succeeded!”

Xia ruofei gently patted Ling Qingxue’s back and said with a smile,””Silly girl, why are you so excited? You’ve only managed to cultivate a small wisp of true Qi. You still have a long way to go before you become a true cultivator!”

Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”it wasn’t easy for me to succeed. Can’t you say something to encourage me?” How can you dampen their enthusiasm like this?”

Xia ruofei said seriously,””At this time, what you need is a basin of cold water, not encouragement. I’m letting you understand the hardships of the road of cultivation, so that you can truly value it. This is not a road filled with flowers and applause. On the contrary, it may be a road of thorns. It may allow you to obtain power that ordinary people dare not imagine, but at the same time, you must face the hardships of this road alone. I can only provide you with some external help. The real cultivation still depends on you.”

Xia ruofei’s words caused Ling Qingxue’s excitement to decrease a little. She lowered her head and said,””I know! It’s just that I’m a little too excited since it’s my first time cultivating true Qi ...”

Xia ruofei patted Ling Qingxue’s head and chuckled.””It’s actually quite powerful! It’s the first time you’ve come into contact with cultivation, and in such a short time, you’ve succeeded after seven or eight attempts. This shows that you’re really talented!” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

In fact, Ling Qingxue’s talent could be said to have been personally cultivated by Xia ruofei. However, Xia ruofei would not say this out loud as he did not want to put pressure on Ling Qingxue.

Ling Qingxue chuckled and said,”that’s nice to hear!”

Xia ruofei said,”let’s rest for a while!” Take a good look at the feeling you got from cultivating just now. We’ll do it again after dinner!”

“I’m not tired at all!” Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”with true Qi, I feel like my entire body is filled with energy!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”It’s just an illusion. Your pitiful amount of genuine Qi isn’t even as strong as a strong man’s full – strength punch!”

Ling Qingxue immediately pouted and said,””You’re giving me another blow ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’m telling you the truth!” Moreover, I’ve told many people that cultivation should pay attention to the balance between work and rest. In fact, many things are the same, too much is as bad as not enough! If a person was constantly in a tense state, the effect of cultivation would not be much better. If they took a little break in the middle, they might be in a better state if they cultivated again. For example ... Right now, we can temporarily forget about cultivation and do something more interesting!”

After he finished speaking, Xia ruofei winked at Ling Qingxue. Ling Qingxue’s face turned red and she said,””Why is your brain filled with bad thoughts all day!”

……

After a long time, Xia ruofei walked out of the bedroom alone and went downstairs to prepare dinner. His cooking skills had improved a lot in the past year. His cooking movements were even more natural and smooth. He could probably get a chef’s certificate or something.

Of course, this was mainly because after training, the body’s coordination and reaction were much stronger than the average person.

Very quickly, Xia ruofei had prepared three dishes and a soup. At the same time, the rice in the rice cooker was ready.

He tried the taste of the food. The three dishes and the soup were all made with the ingredients produced by the space, so the taste was naturally excellent. As for the rice, it was a little less interesting. Although it was also very expensive authentic Wuchang rice, his mouth had long been spoiled by Taoyuan ingredients, and he still felt that it was not good enough.

Xia ruofei suddenly had a thought.”Could he also plant some rice in the space?

The mountain and sea realm in the spirit map space was extremely vast. Although Xia Qing had opened up a large medicinal garden and an Oak Forest, there was still a large area that was idle. If she could plant one or two mu of rice, it would not be bad!

Of course, he didn’t do this to make money, but to satisfy his appetite.

With Xia ruofei’s current net worth, even if the spatial rice was sold at a sky – High price, he would not be tempted. After all, the production of one mu of land was limited and it could not be sold at the price of gold!

In fact, if they really wanted to plant crops, it was obviously more suitable to plant wheat than rice. After all, rice needed paddy fields, and wheat could be cultivated in dry land.

However, Xia ruofei was a Southerner. He was more used to rice rather than noodles, so his first choice was still rice.

Therefore, Xia ruofei simply asked Xia Qing in the space if he could handle it.

Xia Qing was now in charge of too many things. Before Xia ruofei collected all the materials and successfully refined a new puppet, Xia Qing could be said to be working non – stop, with almost no time to rest.

However, Xia Qing still expressed that she could spare some time to plant rice.

Hence, Xia ruofei asked him to open up two mu of paddy fields first. After a few days, he would go and buy quality rice seeds.

After Xia ruofei placed the steaming hot dishes on the table, he went upstairs to call Ling Qingxue down for dinner.

In the past, the two of them rarely had the chance to have a meal together as everyone was busy with their own matters. These few days, Ling Qingxue could stay by Xia ruofei’s side every day and they could eat together almost every meal. They could also come into contact with mysterious cultivation knowledge. These days were simply perfect for her.

After dinner, Xia ruofei dragged Ling Qingxue, who was in a hurry to go upstairs to cultivate, out of the house. He took her for a walk on the farm for more than half an hour before returning to the villa.

He had always advocated a sense of relaxation, and he did not want Ling Qingxue to be in a rush for results.

After they returned to the bedroom, Xia ruofei said to Ling Qingxue,””Qingxue, you can start your cultivation now. Everything is difficult at the beginning. I believe that after you have your first successful experience, it will be much easier in the future.”

“En!” Ling Qingxue nodded.

Xia ruofei continued,”don’t think about anything else. Just gather as much genuine Qi as you can. Every time you complete a circulation, a small amount of spiritual Qi will be absorbed and converted into genuine Qi in your dantian. Small amounts will make a lot, and sand will form a tower. When you have accumulated enough genuine Qi, you will be able to cultivate the real ‘absolute beginning Heart Sutra’!”

Ling Qingxue was only practicing the beginner’s manual. It was prepared for beginners and was actually very inefficient. When her true Qi had accumulated to a certain level, she would naturally practice the first level of the “absolute beginning Scripture”. She would also have to practice it together with Xia ruofei to increase the efficiency of her practice.

Ling Qingxue sat cross – legged on the bed. Xia ruofei silently threw out two spiritual crystals and they landed steadily on both sides of Ling Qingxue.

While Ling Qingxue was working hard on her cultivation, Xia ruofei was not idle either. He was also holding a spiritual crystal in his hand. He sat on the carpet not far away and began to cultivate the great Dao Sutra.

One hour, two hours ...

After four to five hours, it was past midnight. Ling Qingxue finally opened her eyes. Xia ruofei also felt something and opened his eyes at the same time.

The Ling Qingxue now seemed to be different from before. Although there was no change in her appearance, her entire person’s energy was different, especially her eyes, which were shining brightly.

Only when one’s zhenqi had accumulated to a certain extent and they weren’t proficient enough in controlling it would they be able to emit divine light.

Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and jumped onto the bed. He reached out and felt Ling Qingxue’s pulse. A stream of spiritual energy entered his body.

After a long time, Xia ruofei opened his eyes and looked surprised.

“Qingxue, it’s only been four to five hours and you’ve already cultivated so much essential Qi?” he asked.
