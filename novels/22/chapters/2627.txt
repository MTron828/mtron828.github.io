2628 An interesting encounter (2)

At this moment, the phone in Wang Boshan’s pocket rang.

“Martial uncle Zheng, I’ll take this call first ...” He apologized.

These years, Wang Boshan had developed very well in the secular world, and some technological products of the secular world had gradually appeared in the star Seizer sect. Naturally, Zheng Yongshou would not be unable to recognize a mobile phone, but he was not used to using these things.

Zheng Yongshou nodded lightly and continued to lean on the sofa, thinking about how to take over the blue cloud Island. Wang Boshan stood up and answered the phone.

Wang Boshan chatted with the other party in English. Zheng Yongshou naturally didn’t understand at all, but when he saw the irrepressible joy on Wang Boshan’s brows, he couldn’t help but look forward to it.

After Wang Boshan hung up the phone, he said with joy,””Martial uncle Zheng, what did I say! As long as we wait patiently, there will always be good news!”

Zheng Yongshou couldn’t help but sit up straight and asked,””Boshan, what good news is it? Don’t keep me in suspense, tell me!”

“Yes! Junior uncle Zheng!” Wang Boshan said,”just now, one of my insiders on green cloud Island called me and told me that the ownership of green cloud Island is likely to change!”

“What?” Zheng Yongshou couldn’t help but cry out.

“Martial uncle Zheng, don’t worry. It should be a good thing!” Wang Boshan smiled and said,”according to my insider, the Liu family intends to transfer the blue cloud Island to a young man. My insider has also found out the identity of this person. His name is Xia ruofei, the boss of a agricultural product company in China. According to his past experience, I think this person should have nothing to do with the cultivation world!”

Speaking of this, Wang Boshan revealed a trace of excitement and said,””Martial uncle Zheng, our chance has finally come! As long as the Liu family transfers the island to Xia ruofei, it will be much easier to buy the island from him than from the Liu family!”

Zheng Yongshou also revealed a look of great joy and quickly said,””Then what are we waiting for? Hurry up and find this young man! Don’t worry about the money, just give him a price he can’t refuse!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

In the eyes of cultivators, the importance of money was extremely low. Although many sects had businesses in the secular world, these businesses were ultimately for the sake of better collection of cultivation resources and for the sake of cultivation services. If they could take over the green cloud Island, the star Seizer sect would not hesitate even if they had to give up all of their businesses.

“Martial uncle, please be patient, I’ll get it done as soon as possible!” Wang Boshan said. However, the Liu family hasn’t officially transferred the ownership of cyan Cloud Island to Xia ruofei yet, and Xia ruofei hasn’t returned to China yet, so we’re not in a hurry. But ... We can return to our country first. I’ll meet this lucky young man in person!”

“Alright!” Zheng Yongshou said. Good! Boshan, I won’t be returning to the sect this time. I’ll go with you to Huaxia. After I’m done with this, I’ll personally go back to the sect to ask for your reward!”

Zheng Yongshou wanted to report the good news to Luo Qingfeng as soon as possible, so he stayed in the secular world to wait.

Once this matter was completed, not only would Wang Boshan receive a lot of rewards, he, Zheng Yongshou, would also have a great contribution. At that time, he would not be able to avoid his rewards.

“Uncle – Master, I’ll arrange a plane for us to return to China!” Wang Boshan said excitedly.

……

Of course, Xia ruofei did not know that a cultivation sect had set their eyes on Qingyun Island. He and Liu Kuan took the peach source. After five to six hours of flight, the plane landed smoothly at Sydney’s Kingsford Smith International Airport.

The plane quickly left the runway and moved steadily on the runway, heading toward the parking lot.

At this time, Xia ruofei inadvertently looked out of the porthole and was surprised to find that on another taxiway parallel to the taxiway paradise was travelling on, an Airbus A350 with a very distinctive paint was also slowly gliding. On the wing tips of the plane was the striking LOGO of paradise Corporation, and on the body were the names of fresh vegetables and fruits and Paradise Farm.

Xia ruofei could not help but raise his eyebrows. This was too much of a coincidence! The aircraft that was gliding side by side with paradise was obviously the only Airbus A350,”ruofei”, which had a special coating.

When Xia ruofei and Feng Jing were on the flight to Australia, they encountered the depressed co – Pilot Wilkins who had poisoned the flight captain, Johannson. He locked the cockpit door and was prepared to bury the entire crew in the sea. It was Xia ruofei who helped the crew break down the door. When the only pilot, Brook, was unable to fly the plane due to his arms being seriously injured, Xia ruofei turned the tide. Under Brook’s technical guidance, he landed the plane in Saipan.

This epic – Level forced Xia ruofei to enter the public eye for the first time. He had embarked on the ‘road of no return’ of the ‘boss of an internet celebrity’.

To thank Xia ruofei, qiuhang not only gave him a cash reward and the title of ‘lifetime honored passenger’, but also named the repaired plane ‘ruofei’. They also changed the paint of the plane to a pattern that was very similar to the peach blossom company and Paradise Farm.

No matter which airport it appeared in, the delicate and alluring vegetables and fruits on the body of the plane would always be very eye – catching. Additionally, at the sight of such paint, those who understood the situation would naturally recall the soul – shaking forced landing. Therefore, it was very eye – catching wherever it was.

Xia ruofei had also seen the Chinese netizens on the internet who happened to board this plane. They had excitedly posted selfies on the internet, saying that this plane had too many connections with China, so the Chinese netizens felt quite close to it when they saw it.

It was Xia ruofei’s first time seeing the plane in person.

What was more interesting was that the “paradise” that Xia ruofei was on was also painted with vegetables and fruits. The style of the two parallel planes was very similar, and they both had the LOGO of “paradise Corporation” on them. One was on the tip of the wings, while the other was on the tail.

The passengers on the Airbus A350 also noticed this. Many of them screamed in excitement and took out their mobile phones to take pictures of paradise.

Xia ruofei also felt that it was too much of a coincidence. In a good mood, he also waved to the passengers on the vacant plane through the porthole.

Liu Kuan and the flight attendants of the peach source were also amazed.

As an aviation practitioner, be it a flight attendant or a pilot, they knew Xia ruofei’s experience like the back of their hands. Liu Kuan, as old master Liu’s butler, naturally knew the details of Xia ruofei’s disclosure. Therefore, they all knew the special meaning of the “ruofei” paint. Everyone felt that it was fate, especially the flight attendants, who couldn’t help but take out their mobile phones to take pictures.

Two planes with similar paint were gliding slowly across a runway. Next to the plane A350 for intercontinental flights, Xia ruofei’s Gulfstream G650 was like a Chihuahua next to a Tibetan Mastiff. The huge difference formed an interesting contrast.

Even the administrators on the tower noticed this interesting scene. It just so happened that the plane next to the vacant vacant vacant vacant vacant vacant vacant seat of the vacant vacant vacant vacant vacant vacant vacant vacant vacant vacant vacant vacant vacant vacant vacant vacant vacant vacant vacant seat of the vacant vacant vacant vacant vacant vacant vacant vacant vacant vacant vacant seat vacant vacant vacant seat, so ...

The next moment, Liu An, the captain of paradise, received instructions from the control tower’s control tower to change their parking spot temporarily. Naturally, the taxiing route also changed accordingly.

Liu An was stunned for a moment. Because private planes were generally parked at the long – distance seats, they were generally closer to the access passage for public planes. It was rare to change the parking spot at the last minute.

However, Liu An was still very professional. He quickly recorded the parking spots and the nodes of the gliding route, and then accurately repeated them.

The plane was still moving slowly on the runway. Xia ruofei and the others did not know that the parking lot had changed.

After turning a corner, paradise followed quandé’s “ruofei”. The two planes, one big and one small, glided forward like a hen leading a chick.

What surprised Liu An was that the two planes were travelling in the same direction.

In the end, after the Airbus A350 from quinba entered the parking lot, Liu An realized that their parking lot was actually adjacent to paradise.

Liu An then realized that this should be the intentional arrangement of the tower. He calmed his mind and controlled the plane to slide into the parking spot and land accurately. He then skillfully turned off the engine and the electric doors.

At this moment, the pilots and passengers on the peach source had already noticed that the ground crew had already driven over the airstair car that had been prepared earlier the moment the Airbus A350 landed. Some people had even started to lay a red carpet under the airstair ...
