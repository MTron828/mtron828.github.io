Chapter 948: Irresistible force (1)

Translator: 549690339

In simple terms, the first level of the great Dao Arts was equivalent to the beginner stage of cultivation. What one had to complete at this stage was what the Daoist often called “refining essence into Qi.”

In other words, he could transform the food he ate and the spiritual energy in the world into his own true Qi.

When the true Qi in the body reached a certain level, the quantitative change would lead to a qualitative change, and the cultivator would be able to enter the next stage.

The first level of the “great Dao Arts” divided the process of transforming essence into Qi into ten stages. Each stage had a corresponding cultivation technique and Meridian circulation diagram. If one completed the ten stages step by step, one would naturally be able to complete the first level of the “great Dao Arts.”

Xia ruofei had completely understood the obscure techniques that seemed to be filled with the ultimate truth of heaven and earth. Hence, he took a deep breath and tried to cultivate the first meridian circulation diagram after he had focused his mind.

The first step of cultivation was to sense the free energy between heaven and earth.

This was an extremely difficult threshold for ordinary people, but Xia ruofei had crossed it without any effort.

This was because the spiritual Qi in the spirit map space was thousands of times denser than the outside world. Furthermore, Xia ruofei was the owner of the spirit map space and had established a physical connection with the space. He was more sensitive to the spiritual Qi in the space.

Hence, as soon as Xia ruofei activated his mental cultivation method, the fog – like spiritual Qi floating in the air was attracted to him in a flash.

However, the moment the spiritual Qi was absorbed into Xia ruofei’s body, the innate pure Yang Qi that he had been suppressing in his dantian began to stir.

At this moment, Xia Qing’s voice was heard in Xia ruofei’s ears,””Master, please use the” great Dao mantra “to absorb the innate pure Yang Qi!”

Xia ruofei then came to his senses. The innate pure Yang Qi and the spiritual energy of heaven and earth were both energy in essence. Moreover, the energy contained in the innate pure Yang Qi was of a higher purity. He could completely use his heart cultivation method to absorb it.

It could be said that this was a higher level of energy. Even in the spirit map space, such pure energy was rare, let alone in the outside world where spiritual Qi was scarce.

This was also the main reason why Xia Qing had suggested Xia ruofei to absorb the innate pure Yang Qi in Tang Haoran’s body and suppress it.

Xia ruofei didn’t hesitate anymore. He immediately started to practice the first level of the “great Dao scroll”. The pure Yang Qi in his dantian was extracted bit by bit and started to circulate according to the first meridian circulation diagram.

In the process of circulating through his meridians, the innate pure Yang Qi was quickly transformed into true Qi, and the whole process was not delayed at all.

This was because the innate pure Yang Qi was extremely pure and had almost no impurities.

Xia ruofei operated the mysterious technique without any distractions. Traces of innate pure Yang Qi were extracted from his dantian and transformed into true Qi in the process of circulating his meridians. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

The amazing thing was that during the transformation of the innate pure Yang Qi, Xia ruofei’s meridians also absorbed a small part of the innate pure Yang Qi. His meridians became tougher and wider without him knowing.

This was also the magical effect of the innate pure Yang Qi.

Therefore, Xia Qing had strongly suggested that Xia ruofei temporarily suppress the innate pure Yang Qi in his body because cultivation could be done step by step. Even without such high – Level and pure energy, it would only take a little more time. However, the opportunity to use the innate pure Yang Qi to transform the body was something that could only be encountered by luck.

Xia ruofei didn’t notice the changes in his body because he was in a state of complete focus.

It didn’t take long for his genuine Qi to flow according to the first meridian circulation diagram. His meridians were already filled with a feeling of swelling.

Then, Xia ruofei immediately felt that the genuine Qi in his body seemed to have broken through a barrier.

Could it be that he had already completed the first meridian circulation diagram?

Xia ruofei couldn’t believe it either. According to the “great way of Dao”, each Meridian circulation diagram corresponded to a level in the Qi cultivation stage. The ten diagrams corresponded to Qi cultivation Level 1 to level 10.

And every level would have a bottleneck, and this bottleneck was not so easy to break through. Sometimes it would take time to accumulate, and sometimes it would also require a certain amount of comprehension.

Although he couldn’t feel the passage of time during cultivation, Xia ruofei could roughly make a judgment. It hadn’t been long since he sat down to cultivate, and there was still a large amount of innate pure Yang Qi in his dantian that had not been absorbed and digested!

In such a short period of time, he had broken through to the second level of the Qi refining stage. Moreover, the bottleneck only made Xia ruofei feel a slight delay, and then it was easily broken through as if it was nothing.

This made Xia ruofei feel that it was unreal.

However, after carefully examining the state of his body, he discovered that even though it was hard to believe, it was the truth. He had already broken through to the second level of the Qi refining stage.

The innate pure Yang Qi in his dantian had just been touched, and it was already difficult to suppress it with the simple magic art that Xia Qing had taught him.

Hence, Xia ruofei did not have much time to think about it. He immediately followed the second Meridian circulation diagram and started to circulate his heart technique.

After entering the second level of the Qi refining stage, the innate pure Yang Qi was consumed at an even faster rate. It flowed through his meridians like a rapid stream and was constantly being converted into true Qi. At the same time, it was nourishing and transforming Xia ruofei’s meridians.

As time passed, Xia ruofei soon felt the bottleneck of the second level of the Qi refining stage. Similarly, this bottleneck was no different from a decoration. Xia ruofei broke through it easily.

After that was the third level of the Qi refining stage. At this time, the innate pure Yang Qi in his dantian was about half of what it originally had.

All the mental cultivation methods and Meridian circulation diagrams had been deeply imprinted in Xia ruofei’s mind. As long as he had reached the cultivation level, he could easily follow the diagrams to circulate the mental cultivation methods. He did not need to go through the process of learning, adapting, and familiarizing himself with them.

At this moment, the innate pure Yang Qi in Xia ruofei’s dantian had formed a cyclone. The centrifugal force kept throwing the innate pure Yang Qi out and then it entered the meridians involved in the third meridian circulation diagram. Under the effect of Xia ruofei’s “great Dao technique”, the meridians continued to transform and transform into genuine Qi.

After entering the third level of the Qi refining stage, Xia ruofei’s cultivation speed did not slow down.

After a short while, he could clearly feel the existence of the bottleneck.

Xia ruofei didn’t try to break through the bottleneck on purpose. He just used his heart technique normally.

According to the description of the “great Dao Arts,” the three bottlenecks of the third, sixth, and ninth levels of the Qi refining stage were relatively large. They were equivalent to a small qualitative change.

However, Xia ruofei still managed to break through the bottleneck of the third level without realizing it.

In a short period of time, Xia ruofei went from a newbie with Zero Foundation to the fourth level of the Qi refining stage.

Xia ruofei was already numb to this. At this time, there was still about a quarter of the innate pure Yang Qi left in his dantian. Xia ruofei continued to use his heart technique.

After entering the fourth level of the Qi refining stage, Xia ruofei’s cultivation speed gradually slowed down.

The Qi cyclone in his dantian was now the size of a date. The Qi cyclone formed by the innate pure Yang Qi was spinning rapidly. Wisps of pure Yang Qi were released and absorbed by Xia ruofei’s meridians.

After an unknown period of time, Xia ruofei felt that there was no more innate pure Yang Qi left in his body. He had absorbed all of it.

At this time, if he used his cultivation method, he would be absorbing the spiritual Qi in the space.

Xia ruofei stopped at the right time. Jian Jia’s cultivation speed today was too fast. It was so fast that he felt a little scared.

He knew that going too far was as bad as not enough. If one’s realm was not stable enough, and one’s Foundation was not solid enough, no matter what one did, it would not be long – term. He believed that cultivation was the same.

Xia ruofei slowly stopped his heart technique. He felt the surging genuine Qi in his body, opened his eyes, and stood up.

Xia ruofei felt that his body was filled with energy. He even had the illusion that he could block a truck that was coming at him at high speed with one hand.

Xia Qing, who was guarding Xia ruofei from afar, saw this and quickly walked over.

“Master, how did your first training feel?” Xia Qing asked.

Xia ruofei scratched his head and said,””I can’t say for sure ... Isn’t this speed a little too fast? I’m already at the fourth level of the Qi refining stage!”

Xia Qing couldn’t help but stare blankly for a moment, but then she said in relief,””Master, it must be because the purity of the innate pure Yang Qi in your body is very high, and it’s relatively easy to break through the first few levels of the Qi cultivation stage. That’s why you were able to cultivate to this realm in one go.”

“Will it cause instability in the realm?” Xia ruofei asked, worried.

“Don’t worry, master,”Xia Qing said with a smile. You’ve already laid down a very good foundation by taking the spirit bearing soup, body tempering soup, and tempering your spiritual power. Moreover, during the transformation process, the innate pure Yang Qi will also nourish and strengthen your meridians. In the first three levels of the Qi cultivation stage, you completely relied on the innate pure Yang Qi to break through, so not only is your Foundation not unstable, it’s also much more stable than the average cultivator!”

“Then I’m relieved.” Xia ruofei also heaved a sigh of relief.

Xia Qing continued,”but I still suggest that you temporarily control the progress of your cultivation. After all, you’ve just started cultivating. If your cultivation speed is too fast, I’m afraid that your state of mind won’t be able to keep up, and it’s easy for heart demons to appear.”

Xia ruofei nodded.”Okay. I will stabilize my cultivation at Qi disciple Level 4. At the same time, I will use this time to learn more about the other legacy books in the human jade talisman.”

“Yes, that knowledge is very useful to cultivators.” Xia Qing said,”by the way, master, there’s one more thing I must remind you of. When you cultivate, your demand for the spiritual energy of heaven and earth is very large. If you often cultivate in the spirit map world, it will inevitably cause a loss of spiritual energy. Although the spirit map world has a certain self – repairing function and the spiritual energy will also be slowly replenished from the outside world, if the loss is too much, it will still hurt the foundation of the spirit map world.”
