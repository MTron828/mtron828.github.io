Chapter 1219: Chapter 745-I’ll dig! I’ll dig! I’ll dig, dig, dig, dig!_2

In any case, in the realm, as long as it didn’t touch the land, everything seemed to have stopped time and could maintain its original state. It was more effective than any preservation method in the outside world.

Therefore, these two truffles were the same as when they were first dug out.

Xia ruofei took the truffle from Xia Qing’s hand and let him do his work.

Then he waved his hand and called lightning, Blackie, and the others over.

Xia ruofei let lightning and the others smell the two truffles so that they would remember the smell.

Then, Xia ruofei said,”alright, let’s split up and look for truffles in the oak Forest!” Let me know when you find it!”

As soon as Xia ruofei finished speaking, lightning, Blackie, fluffy one and fluffy two rushed into the oak Forest.

In France or Italy, where truffles were produced, people would also use hounds to find truffles. However, many people had been training boars to find truffles for generations.

This kind of “Truffle Pig” was quite accurate in its search. It was said that mature truffles would emit a smell similar to that of a sow in heat, so specially trained boars were very accurate in finding them.

There was also a saying that pigs were trained to look for it because truffles would emit the smell of hormones, which was a fatal temptation to pigs.

Xia ruofei had never tried to verify it, so he did not know which one was correct. However, he had tasted the truffle and it did feel weird. As for whether it was the smell of a sow during estrus or the smell of hormones, Xia ruofei could not tell. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

But no matter what, Xia ruofei had absolute confidence in lightning and the rest. Their sense of smell was sharper than the best hunting dogs. After sniffing, they would definitely be able to find the truffles buried underground.

The result did not disappoint Xia ruofei.

Not long after lightning and the rest entered the oak Forest, Xia ruofei heard an excited dog bark.

Xia ruofei walked in quickly and saw Blackie running around a big oak tree. From time to time, it would use its nose to dig at the ground, looking very excited.

“There’s truffles down there?” Xia ruofei asked.

Blackie immediately wagged its tail and barked at Xia ruofei.

“Received!” Xia ruofei said happily.

They had found truffles so quickly. It seemed that this season’s truffles should have matured in large quantities.

With a thought, he retrieved a small shovel and a small shovel from the tool rack of the Archean realm. He first used the shovel to dig at the spot that little black had pointed at.

At the beginning of the year, Xia ruofei had already dug for truffles once. At that time, lightning was in charge of finding truffles, so he had some experience.

After using the shovel to dig 60 to 70 centimeters, he could vaguely see a black piece. Xia ruofei was overjoyed. He put down the shovel and picked up the small wooden shovel to dig around the truffle carefully.

If the truffle’s exterior was damaged, its value would definitely decrease. Hence, Xia ruofei was very careful.

After a while, a black truffle the size of a football was dug out. It had the fragrance of moist soil and an indescribable, strange fragrance. The experienced Xia ruofei could tell that this was the pure truffle fragrance. Only high – Quality truffles would have such a strong fragrance.

Xia ruofei weighed the truffle in his hand. It was at least two catties in weight. This size was considered very rare in the outside world.

What a good start!

Xia ruofei’s face revealed a satisfied smile.

While he was digging for the truffle, Blackie, fluffy one, fluffy two, and the others in the forest were also barking excitedly. Without a doubt, they had also found the truffle.

It seemed that this year’s production was very high, which was why the dogs could find the truffle so easily.

Xia ruofei casually took out a large plastic box from the Archean realm and placed the black truffle inside. Then, he walked into the forest.

He saw that every dog was running around a tree, looking very excited.

Blackie couldn’t help but reach out its claws to dig the soil. It had already dug out a small pit.

Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat. He quickly walked over and said,””If you find truffles, you can dig a pit of about 50 centimeters!”

Little black, fluffy one, fluffy two, and the others all looked confused. They clearly did not have much concept of 50 centimeters.

Without a word, Xia ruofei raised his shovel and started digging in the pit that Blackie had just dug. His arm strength was extremely strong, and he dug out a 50 – centimeter pit in a short while.

“It’s about this deep!”Xia ruofei said.

Truffles were usually found in soil that was around 60 to 70 centimeters deep, so a pit of about 50 centimeters wouldn’t hurt the skin of the truffle.

Xia ruofei had considered that the amount of truffles under the oak Forest might have exceeded his imagination. If he dug them one by one, it would waste too much time. If xiaohei and the rest could dig a hole half a meter deep first, it would save him a lot of trouble. It would be equivalent to marking them.

Of course, Xia ruofei could have marked the places with truffles and instructed Xia Qing to do the job.

However, Xia Qing already had a lot of work to do. The herb garden, Cordyceps, tea garden, meat garden, seafood ... He was busy almost every second of the day. Furthermore, truffles grew in the mountain and sea realm, and there was no time flow to increase the speed of time. It was a waste of time to dig out all the truffles.
