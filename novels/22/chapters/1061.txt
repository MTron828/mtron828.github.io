Chapter 1062: The crazy abalones (2)

Translator: 549690339

The starting price of the last abalone was zero Yuan. In fact, it didn’t matter how much the starting price was. Although it was zero Yuan, it was impossible for anyone to buy it at a low price in such a fierce competition.

Seeing the rich people in the VIP area below the stage and the 15 mysterious buyers who were eyeing the abalone covetously online, everyone knew that the transaction price of this abalone would definitely not be low.

At the very least, it would not be any cheaper than the two abalones that were worth an average of five million Hong Kong dollars.

Therefore, the starting bid of zero Yuan was actually a gimmick, which was also a common gimmick in auction houses.

As expected, someone immediately made a bid after Lu zhongguang finished speaking.

5 million Hong Kong dollars!

And the bidder was not any of the guests present, but a long – distance online buyer.

After the online buyer placed a bid, the screen on the other side would display a huge number, indicating the price and the buyer’s number.

Everyone couldn’t help but suck in a breath of cold air when they saw the price rise to the second highest price of the night.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile. Feng Jing had put in a lot of thought into this arrangement. It could be seen from this small segment.

The financial strength of these 15 online buyers was undoubted. Since they were able to participate in the auction, their desire to buy the top – grade abalones was definitely not a problem.

However, they were only allowed to participate in the bidding for the last Super – Large one – headed abalone, which was a little interesting.

These people who participated in the online auction were definitely not new. It was important to know that today’s auction was live – streamed on the Hengfeng auction house official website.

In other words, in the past hour or so, the 15 buyers who had strong intentions to buy the abalones could only watch the guests bid for the abalones one by one in front of the screen. Their appetites had long been whetted.

Finally, it was the last segment. They could personally participate in the bidding. The desire to buy that had been suppressed for so long naturally exploded all at once.

Lu zhongguang’s voice immediately rose by two or three degrees.””Bidder No. 06 has bid 5 million Hong Kong dollars! It seemed like this long – range buyer was determined to win! If our friends at the scene want to gain something, we can’t hesitate anymore!”

“5.2 million!” A voice sounded in the hall.

Everyone looked in the direction of the voice and saw Zheng zhilun holding the auction sign high up, looking determined to win.

Like the 15 online buyers, Zheng zhilun could not hold it in any longer.

He didn’t care about the slightly lighter abalones in front of him, so he didn’t even attack them. It wasn’t easy for them to get to the three abalones. When the first one was being auctioned off, he had a stroke and acted like a gentleman. When he saw that the beautiful and sexy he Xinyi was interested in buying it, he gave it up.

Unexpectedly, he Xinyi did not win against Li Kai and continued to bid when it was time for the second abalone. Zheng zhilun, who had already spoken, could only pinch his nose and continue to “carry on with his style.”

Seeing that this was the last abalone, Zheng zhilun bid without hesitation.

“Alright! Mr. Zheng from Xinyu group has bid 5.2 million!” Lu zhongguang said immediately.

As soon as Lu zhongguang’s voice fell, a new bid immediately appeared on the big screen. 5.5 million Hong Kong dollars

Each bid should not be less than 200000 Hong Kong dollars, but it was not limited to 200000 each time. As long as one was willing, they could naturally increase the bid by 300000,500000, or even 1 million.

This time, it was a long – distance buyer with ID 13.

At the same time, Li Kai also raised his sign and said,””Five hundred ...”

He was also stunned when he saw the price displayed on the big screen. Then, he said,””5.7 million Hong Kong dollars!”

It was obvious that Li Kai’s initial bid was not that high, but the long – range buyer beat him to it, so he had to adjust his bid at the last minute.

Lu zhongguang did not even have the time to bid 5.5 million before it was refreshed again, so he said directly,””Young master Lee from Chang Jiang group has bid 5.7 million!”

Zheng zhilun, who was also sitting in the first row, couldn’t help but have a dark expression on his face. Li Kai had already bought a one – headed abalone, yet he was still competing with him. Wasn’t this a little too much?

During the second item of the final auction, Li Kai, who had just bought an abalone for 4.8 million, had indeed given up and did not compete with he Xinyi. However, he was not on good terms with Zheng zhilun to begin with. Furthermore, this was a “King of abalones” that weighed more than 650 grams! Therefore, he would not show any mercy.

Although Zheng zhilun was very unhappy, he could not say anything.

Everyone was here to participate in the auction. You couldn’t possibly stop Li Kai from bidding just because he had already bought one, right? Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

He had a lot of money and wanted to buy a few more, who could stop him?

Zheng zhilun snorted coldly, then immediately raised his board and said loudly,”” 6 million Hong Kong dollars!”

After making his bid, he couldn’t help but glance at Li Kai.

Millions and tens of thousands of Yuan were nothing in the eyes of these two young masters. Zheng zhilun was a little angry and really wanted to fight for his pride.

Moreover, when he got the auction manual, he had already locked onto this abalone. His second uncle, Zheng qitong, the founder of Xinyu group, was going to celebrate his 70th birthday next month. He was prepared to use this top – grade abalone as a birthday gift.

Li Kai turned a blind eye to Zheng zhilun’s hostility. With a friendly smile on his face, he raised his sign in a gentle and refined manner and said calmly,””6.2 million Hong Kong dollars!”

These two young masters were at loggerheads! Everyone could see the signs.

He Xinyi, who was wearing a low – cut evening dress, looked at the two of them with interest. However, she did not make any more bids.

On the other hand, Xia ruofei, who was sitting in the third row, was very excited. This was the scene that the seller was most willing to see. If the two of them were in a disagreement, they would inevitably raise the price. Anyway, the seller would definitely be the one to benefit in the end.

Zheng zhilun was so angry that his face turned red. After taking a deep breath, he raised his sign and said,””6.4 million!”

Then, he looked at Li Kai and said with a fake smile,””Young master Li, my uncle’s birthday is next month. I hope to give this abalone to him as a birthday gift. Please be magnanimous!”

Although Zheng zhilun’s words were polite, there was a hint of resentment in them. Anyone could tell that young master Zheng was really angry.

Li Kai was naturally not afraid of Zheng zhilun. He only smiled faintly and said,””Then I’ll wish old master Zheng a long life in advance! However, I’m also very excited to see such a precious abalone. Let’s rely on our own abilities? Doesn’t this show that your gift is more sincere?”

Many people in the audience secretly laughed.

Li Kai naturally had to respect Zheng qitong. This old man was a legend in the business world. His status in Hong Kong was no less than his father ‘s. But Zheng zhilun ... He didn’t have to give him any face.

Zheng zhilun was so angry that he almost slammed the table and left. Spend more money to show his sincerity? To think he could think of that!

However, the other party had already made it clear that they would not back down, so Zheng zhilun naturally had no way out.

He gave Li Kai a dark look, then snorted and raised his board, saying loudly,””6.6 million!”

Li Kai raised his sign again without hesitation.””6.8 million!”

” 7 million!”

“7.2 million!”

“7.4 million!”

The two of them did not stop bidding. Lu zhongguang did not even have the chance to interrupt and announce the price. In just one or two minutes, the price of the abalone had risen to nearly eight million Hong Kong dollars.

The other guests had completely become spectators, and even the online buyers were silent.

Although there was no exact market price for the top – Quality one – headed abalone, everyone felt that the price was a little too high.

Eight million Hong Kong dollars! In Hong Kong, where land was expensive, one could buy a house. Just to buy an abalone? Wasn’t this a little too crazy?

Even if this abalone was a rare Super One – headed abalone, it shouldn’t be worth so much money, right?

The current price was 8 million Hong Kong dollars, which was offered by Li Kai.

Zheng zhilun’s lungs were about to explode from anger. He took a few deep breaths, raised his board, and said,””8.5 million!”

He had already lost his mind when he increased the price by 500000.

At this time, Li Kai shrugged and said,””Actually, my starting price in my heart is only about 7 million. I was just forcing myself to try just now. Since young master Zheng is so determined, I can only bear the pain and part with my treasure ...”

With that, Li Kai put the sign aside, clearly not planning to bid.

When the guests heard Li Kai’s words, they were stunned for a moment before they couldn’t help but laugh ...
