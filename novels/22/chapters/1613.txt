Chapter 1614: Different professions are worlds apart (2)

After breakfast, Xia ruofei looked at Song Wei and asked,””Song Wei, are you going back to school today?”

“Yeah!” Song Wei nodded. There’s something I have to deal with at school. ”

Xia ruofei could tell that Qianqian was a little disappointed. Last night should have been the best opportunity for Qianqian to cultivate together. Who would have thought that so many people would stay over at Xia ruofei’s courtyard house? furthermore, Zhuo Yiyi insisted on having a “bedroom meeting” with her. In the end, Qianqian could only give up.

“I’ll let Wu Qiang drive you!”Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Alright, then I’ll have to trouble you,” Song Wei said.

Zhuo Yiyi suggested,”Weiwei, why don’t you come to my house first?” You can also stay at my place! I just rented a two bedroom apartment and I’m looking for someone to share it with!”

Before Song Wei could say anything, song Rui immediately said,””It’s not safe to rent together! Wouldn’t it be more comfortable for you to live alone?”

Zhuo Yiyi shot a glance at song Rui and said,””You’re a typical ‘why don’t you eat meat paste’! Do you know how expensive the rent in the capital is? If I don’t find someone to share the rent, I’ll be working for the landlord ...”

“Then ... Then it’s best to find a girl to share the house with,” song Rui said with an embarrassed smile.”And she has to be single or without a boyfriend. Otherwise, it’s too inconvenient to live with a man ...”

Then, song Rui looked at Song Wei and his eyes lit up.”Why don’t you just share a room with Song Wei? Aren’t you two best friends? And we know each other so well that we don’t even need to break in when living together!”

“I’m going to live on campus this semester!”Song Wei quickly waved her hand. “There are a lot of things to do at school, and I often have to do field internships, so it’s not convenient to rent a house ...”

Xia ruofei looked at song Rui mischievously and said with a smile,””Actually ... I think it’s not a bad idea to share a room with the opposite sex! A boy can take care of a girl, and it’s more secure ...”

Song Rui was about to go crazy. He glared at Xia ruofei with murderous eyes.

Xia ruofei was just teasing song Rui on purpose. He did not expect Zhuo Yiyi to look thoughtful after hearing that. She said,””That sounds pretty good! If you can find a reliable guy to share the house with ...” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Xia ruofei quickly said,”Zhuo Yiyi, I was just joking!” We have to be careful when renting a house with the opposite sex. Safety is the most important!”

Song Rui couldn’t help but roll his eyes. You were the one who urged Yiyi to find someone of the opposite sex to share a room, and you were the one who persuaded her not to. You’re a good person both inside and out!

Xia ruofei saw that Zhuo Yiyi seemed to have understood his thoughts and could not help but smile bitterly. He thought to himself,’I can’t take the blame for this!’

His mind quickly turned and he said,””Yiyi, you’re considering co – renting mainly because of the burden of the rent, right?”

“Of course!” Zhuo Yiyi said,”who wouldn’t want to live alone if they had the ability? wouldn’t that be so comfortable? I still want to own a big siheyuan like you! Who asked me to not have money?”

Xia ruofei laughed.”You’re still young. Your future is full of possibilities!”

When he said this, he even looked at song Rui meaningfully. He urged her to stay in the courtyard house if Zhuo Yiyi really got together with song Rui and got past the song family. The song family’s old house was much bigger than Xia ruofei’s courtyard house and had more history.

Xia ruofei continued,”actually, song Rui had a suggestion yesterday. We are working together to build a clubhouse. The clubhouse might be built in a Chinese style. Aren’t you a cultural relic major?” “Song Rui hopes to hire you as a consultant, mainly to help us check on the renovation style and not make it look ridiculous. Of course, we will pay you for this job ...”

Song Rui was confused. When did his brother ever make such a suggestion?

However, he wasn’t a fool. He immediately came back to his senses and quickly said,””Yes, yes, yes! Yiyi, this is what you’re good at, and it can also bring you some extra income, so you won’t be unable to afford the rent. ”

Zhuo Yiyi asked hesitantly,”I ... Will I be able to do it?” You’ve invested so much ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”just remove the ‘mo’!” You have to have confidence in yourself!”

“That’s right!” Song Rui also encouraged him.”How can you belittle yourself? You’re a top student at Capital University! How many people could get into capital University every year? You’re an expert in this field!”

“Then ... I’ll try?” Zhuo Yiyi said hesitantly.

“Good! Then it’s a deal!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”we have to get the land first. After we successfully bid for the land, we will start the overall design work soon. We will need your help then! As for the remuneration ... Song Rui will discuss it with you later!”

“Alright then!” Zhuo Yiyi smiled and said,”thank you for trusting me!”

Zhao Yongjun and the others laughed as they watched. Who here wasn’t a smart person? They knew that Xia ruofei had given him the position of an advisor to help song Rui.

Since they were working on a project worth hundreds of millions, they naturally wouldn’t mind paying an extra person’s salary. Moreover, this person was song Rui’s sweetheart, so they wouldn’t have any objections.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”no need to thank me. If you want to thank someone, thank song Rui!” He was the one who recommended you!”

Zhuo Yiyi patted song Rui’s shoulder and said,””Brother! Interesting! I’ll treat you to a meal later!”

Song Rui didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”Alright ...”

Xia ruofei almost couldn’t hold back his laughter. After all the hard work, Zhuo Yiyi still treated song Rui as her best friend!

Song Wei, who was at the side, was also trying to hold back her laughter. Her best friend was really a little slow when it came to matters between men and women.

She also said in her heart,”I should find an opportunity to help uncle Rui!” He really looked pitiful ...

Song Wei then thought about herself. She seemed to be in a worse situation than song Rui ... At least he could still see the hope of working hard, but she could only carefully hide this secret and could not see any hope at all ...

Xia ruofei did not notice Song Wei’s dejection. He called Wu Qiang over and asked him to drive Song Wei back to school.

Zhuo Yiyi also suggested that they leave together, so Xia ruofei asked Wu Qiang to send the two of them to their destination.

After the two beauties left, song Rui immediately said to Xia ruofei,””Brother! That’s interesting!”

“You can’t blame me for causing trouble just now, right?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“That’s a different matter!” Song Rui said,”if Yiyi had really accepted your weird suggestion just now, I wouldn’t have let you off!”

Zhao Yongjun and the others couldn’t help but laugh.

After a round of laughter, Zhao Yongjun said,””Ruofei, let’s go to the scene in Xiaotang town in the morning!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”sure!” I’ll take your car!”

There were three cars left. Xia ruofei and song Rui got into Zhao Yongjun’s car, while Liu Jian and Xu Zixuan got into the other two cars. The group went straight to Xiaotang town in Pingchang District.

It was the rush hour in the capital, and the car encountered a traffic jam as soon as it left the alley.

No matter how much power these rich Playboys had, they had no choice but to move forward slowly in the traffic.

After finally passing through the congested road and reaching the relatively loose ring Road, Zhao Yongjun sped up a little.

After more than an hour of driving, the group finally arrived at their destination.

They were still in a barren land. Xia ruofei got out of the car and stretched. He took a deep breath and smiled.”Not bad, not bad! Even though it was a little remote! But at least the air here is much better than in the city!”
