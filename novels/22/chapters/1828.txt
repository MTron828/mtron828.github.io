Chapter 1829: Taking the medicine again (1)

Translator: 549690339

At first, everyone thought that it was just a formality. After all, the inauguration ceremony of a building was not big news. If it were not for Deputy – Mayor ni, more than half of the media would not have attended.

However, after hearing Xia ruofei’s words, everyone perked up their ears.

Because Xia ruofei had just quoted Deputy – Mayor NI’s words, which also mentioned social responsibility and the Paradise charity fund. Could it be that Xia ruofei’s decision was related to charity? Everyone couldn’t help but guess in their hearts.

Xia ruofei didn’t beat around the bush and said directly,””I’ve decided to hand over 5% of the company’s shares to the Paradise Charity Foundation. Every year, the dividends generated from this 5% of the shares will be fully invested into the charity Foundation!”

Xia ruofei’s words caused an uproar. Even Feng Jing, Dong Yun, and the others, who did not know about this beforehand, were shocked.

According to the statistics of some organizations, the annual profit of paradise Corporation was about 200 million Yuan, and 5% of the shares were also over ten million Yuan. To invest ten million Yuan every year for charity was not an ordinary courage.

What’s more, the 200 million profit was the current estimate. According to the development momentum of the Paradise Corporation, the future profit would be higher and higher. At that time, the 5% dividend would be even more.

Deputy – Mayor ni also looked at Xia ruofei with approval.

Although he was ordered to come, he had a good impression of Xia ruofei after a short interaction. He admired Xia ruofei even more after he announced his decision.

When one was poor, he would be good to himself, and when one was good, he would help the world. Xia ruofei’s company could only be said to be in its early stages and could not be compared to the giant companies at all. However, he was already thinking about taking care of the world and was taking big steps.

This was what a true entrepreneur was! Deputy Mayor ni sighed in his heart. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Xia ruofei’s speech was still in progress. He had been paying attention to Feng Jing’s hints.

Feng Rao made a few simple hand gestures and Xia ruofei knew that there were only a few minutes left.

Xia ruofei looked into the future and pointed out the key development areas of paradise Corporation. At about 11:20, he quickly returned to the topic and ended it.

Xia ruofei had been improvising the whole time and had not prepared any script.

Of course, with Xia ruofei’s level and mental strength, it was not a problem for him to speak off – script for half an hour.

Xia ruofei ended his speech amidst the applause. Chen Li walked up to the stage and said,””Next, let’s invite Mayor ni, Secretary Chen, director Guo ... And President Xia to come on stage to unveil the peach blossom mansion!”

The guests and Xia ruofei walked onto the stage one after another.

When the small stage was built, the unveiling part was taken into consideration. Its height was exactly the same as the steps of the peach blossom mansion.

On the right side of the main entrance, a plaque was already covered by red silk, making it impossible to see the true appearance of the mountain inside.

Xia ruofei and Chen Li both knew that there were only about three minutes left. He controlled the rhythm on stage and shook hands with the leaders and guests. Chen Li had also prepared some ‘nonsense’ to fill in the time.

It was about three minutes, neither long nor short. Xia ruofei and the others took about a minute to walk on the stage and make small talk. In front of the plaque, everyone pushed each other to the side. In the end, it was naturally Deputy Mayor ni who stood in the center, while Xia ruofei and Secretary Chen stood on either side of him. It took about half a minute.

Below the stage, Feng Jing was the most nervous of them all. Chen Li had used up the last bit of time she had, and a large Arabic number 10 appeared on the big screen.

This was also done in advance, even with the network matching time, the purpose was to be accurate to the second.

Chen Li quickly raised her voice and said, “Let’s start the countdown! 9! 8! 7……”

The numbers on the big screen also changed every second.

After the number ‘ 1’, the image of fireworks bloomed on the screen. At the same time, Chen Li also said loudly,”Please reveal the opening!”

Deputy – Mayor ni, the other guests, and Xia ruofei had already pulled on a corner of the silk cloth. After hearing Chen Li’s words, everyone exerted a little force, and the red silk cloth immediately slid off gently, revealing the plaque inside.

The plaque naturally had the words ‘paradise building’ on it.

The applause at the venue was thunderous. The sound of firecrackers and gongs also rang out at the same time.

Xia ruofei invited the guests to enter the building for a tour. This was the purpose of the question.

After the tour, all the guests, reporters, and employees of the Paradise Corporation took a bus to the Shangri – La hotel, which was not far from the building.

Feng Rao had booked a medium – sized banquet hall in advance, which could accommodate up to 20 tables. Of course, she didn’t book so many tables, but because of Deputy – Mayor NI’s arrival, many leaders came uninvited, so she had to call the hotel at the last minute and ask for three more tables.

Fortunately, the banquet hall was large enough. With a slight adjustment to the layout of the tables, it was easy to add three more tables. It was just that time was a little tight.

However, Shangri-La’s service was still very professional. Before Xia ruofei and the rest arrived at the hotel, everything had been adjusted and the additional ingredients had been prepared.

For such a large – scale banquet, they naturally wouldn’t use the expensive paradise vegetables, but they used Drunken Eight Immortals as the wine.

Of course, the management of public servants was stricter these days, especially since it was noon on a working day. Therefore, Deputy Mayor ni declined the drink and ordered the fruit juice directly. Since the leader took the lead, others naturally followed suit. The prepared Drunken Eight Immortals was suddenly out of the market.
