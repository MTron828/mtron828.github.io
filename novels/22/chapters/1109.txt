Song Rui accompanied them after serving tea. He was shocked when he saw Xia ruofei take out a birthday gift – it was an old rule for elder song not to accept gifts on his birthday. Even song Zhengping and his siblings came empty – handed today.

Song Rui quickly said,”ruofei, Didn’t I tell you?” Grandfather doesn’t accept birthday gifts!”

Song Rui was also a little nervous. He was afraid that elder song would be angry and even blame him for not explaining things clearly to Xia ruofei, so he sounded a little anxious.

However, elder song was still smiling. He looked at the gift box in Xia ruofei’s hand and said to song Rui,””Xiao Rui, Xiao Xia’s gift is a token of her sincerity. Even if we don’t accept it, you can’t be so anxious!”

Song Rui looked embarrassed. He scratched his head and laughed.”Grandpa, I ... Hehe, RUO Fei doesn’t know about the rules you set. Don’t be angry!”

Song Rui did not emphasize elder song’s rules to Xia ruofei. He only said that the old man did not accept gifts, so Xia ruofei did not expect song Rui to have such a big reaction. He was also a little confused.

There was a smile in elder song’s eyes as he explained to Xia ruofei,”Little Xia, I’ve set a rule many years ago, and that is to never accept gifts on my birthday. At that time, I was also worried that improper conduct would spread, so even Zhengping, Zhilan, and the others wouldn’t allow me to give them. So, this rule has been preserved for so many years.”

Xia ruofei was enlightened and he couldn’t help but feel respect for elder song.

“So that’s how it is!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”chief, you’re overdoing it! For example, I’m just sincerely expressing my blessings today, and I don’t have any utilitarian heart!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Song Rui and song Zhilan couldn’t help but secretly click their tongues. They dared to say that he was overdoing it in front of the old man. No one had the guts to do that! Even though elder song had retired, he was still very powerful. Even a high official like song Zhengping didn’t dare to be so bold in front of his father!

What made song Rui and song Zhilan jealous was that elder song didn’t get angry after hearing Xia ruofei’s words. Instead, he laughed.

“Little Xia, rules are rules. Don’t tell me that Zhengping and Zhilan’s birthday gifts to me would be mixed with a utilitarian heart? That’s impossible! But I have to settle this with a bowl of water! Otherwise, if the rules are flexible, then they can’t be called rules!” Elder song said with a smile.

Xia ruofei rolled his eyes and smiled slyly.””Chief, if you put it that way ... Then what I’m giving you today isn’t a birthday gift! It’s just a small token of my appreciation for coming to the capital to visit my elders. Of course, it’s your birthday today, so it’s easy to cause misunderstandings. I’ll send it over tomorrow!”

Elder song was stunned for a moment, then he laughed and pointed at Xia ruofei.”You little rascal ... Alright, alright, I’ll make an exception for you today! However, I won’t accept the gift if it’s not good! Hahaha ...”

Song Zhi LAN and song Rui couldn’t help but open their mouths wide, their eyes revealing a look of shock.

They didn’t expect elder song to make an exception. At first, they thought that even though elder song valued Xia ruofei, he wouldn’t be angry at Xia ruofei’s gift. They didn’t expect elder song to break the rule that he had set himself and accept the birthday gift for the first time in more than ten years.

Song Lao looked at song Zhilan and song Rui and said,””Today is a special case. Don’t spread it when you go out, understand?”

Song Zhilan and song Rui couldn’t help but look at Xia ruofei with jealousy. Then, they quickly nodded in agreement.

“Little Xia, open the birthday gift you brought!” Elder song chuckled and said,”I’m also very curious about what kind of gift you, a young Divine Doctor, will prepare for me!”

“Yes, chief!” Xia ruofei said as he opened the gift box and placed it aside.

The spirit – gathering Jade Guanyin in the box appeared in front of everyone.

Song Zhilan and song Rui also stretched their necks to look over. After seeing this Jade Guanyin, song Zhilan couldn’t help but feel a little disappointed.

She had thought that Xia ruofei would give elder song some expensive Chinese medicine or tonics. After all, Xia ruofei’s medical skills were so amazing. The most suitable gift for elder song was from the perspective of health.

Unexpectedly, Xia ruofei had given her a Jade Guanyin.

Although this Jade Guanyin looked expensive, it was nothing in the eyes of a lady from a wealthy family like Song Zhi LAN.

Her eyes were not bad. She could tell at a glance that the Jade Guanyin was made of glass. However, the colorless Jade was far from the top grade. In fact, even the best King’s Green could only meet her eyes.

Eccentric song revealed a trace of fondness.

Elder song’s judgment was naturally different from song Zhilan and song Rui. Song Zhilan was used to judging the value from the perspective of a businessman, while elder song valued Xia ruofei’s sincerity more.

Moreover, elder song could tell that the carving of the Jade Guanyin was extraordinary.

He laughed and said,”little Xia, the carving of this jade pendant is very good!” It gives off a natural feeling!”

“Chief, you’re too kind ...” Xia ruofei chuckled.

“What?” Eccentric song’s eyebrows shot up.

He was praising the carving of the Jade Guanyin, could it be ...

As expected, Xia ruofei continued with a smile,””This Jade Guanyin was personally carved by me because I feel that only things that are personally made can express my sincerity!”
