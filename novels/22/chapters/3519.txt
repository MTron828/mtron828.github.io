Chapter 3520: Noisiness (1)

Translator: 549690339

The driver was actually the security guard of the club. Usually, the Paradise Club provided free driving services for its members, so many security guards were also acting as drivers, and most of them had a driver’s license.

The young security guard heard Xia ruofei’s words and quickly stopped the car.

They were not far from the club and were in the suburbs, so parking by the roadside would not affect the traffic.

“Mr. Xia, what are your orders?” The security guard stopped the car and asked respectfully.

Although Xia ruofei was a shareholder of the club and did not show his face much, the security guard was one of the earliest to join. He was well aware of Xia ruofei’s status in the Paradise Club, so he did not dare to neglect him.

In fact, any member of the club had to be served carefully by the staff.

High – end clubs were all about service.

Xia ruofei sat up straight and said,”something came up at the last minute, so 1’11 get off here.” Drive the car back to the club! Just tell brother Zhao to arrange for someone to drive the car back for me tomorrow! He knows the place.”

The security guard couldn’t help but be stunned when he heard this. He subconsciously made an “ah” sound.

The parking lot was tens of kilometers away from Main City. Even though it was late at night in the outskirts, it was still quite remote. There were very few cars on the road. The security guard was taken aback when Xia ruofei requested to get off the car at such a place.

He was even a little worried that Xia ruofei might have drunk too much, so he quickly said,””Mr. Xia, where are you going? Let me drive you there! It’s not safe for you to be alone in this dark!”

What if Xia ruofei was really drunk and left him alone in the wilderness? if something were to happen, it would not be as simple as losing his job.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”brother, don’t worry!” 1 didn’t drink much tonight. The place I’m going to is a bit inconvenient, you just have to drive the car back to the club, brother Zhao won’t blame you. I’ve already contacted a friend to pick me up, so you don’t have to worry about this.”

With that, Xia ruofei pressed the switch and the electric door of Alphard opened slowly.

The security guard got out of the car worriedly and said,””Mr. Xia, how about… 1 wait with you? I’ll return to the club after you get in the car.”

Xia ruofei frowned and said,””It’s okay, you can drive back now. 1 don’t need your help here … Brother, how about I call brother Zhao and ask him to talk to you in person?”

“I don’t dare, I don’t dare!” The security guard quickly replied. Mr. Xia, then … Then I’ll really go back!”

The security guard was actually worried that something might happen to Xia ruofei, especially if he was drunk and in danger by the roadside. He would have to bear the consequences then. However, he looked at Xia ruofei and did not smell of alcohol. He was also fully sober, so he did not dare to go against Xia ruofei’s wishes.

He was the club’s major shareholder!

Besides, the security guard was a smart man. From Xia ruofei’s words, he guessed that Xia ruofei must have had something that was not convenient for him to see. That was why he chose to get off halfway. The car that came to pick Xia ruofei up was probably not convenient for others to see. The security guard was naturally worried that he would accidentally find out the secret of the Big Shot, so he did not dare to stay.

He quickly got into the car and quickly turned back.

After the Elfa commercial car drove away, Xia ruofei immediately flashed into the bushes by the side of the road. He took out the blue immortal sword and cast a few seals on his body to hide himself. Then, he silently activated the sword technique. The blue immortal sword instantly turned into a stream of light and flew in the direction of the Paradise Club.

Two minutes ago.

After Xia ruofei’s Elfa car left, a Buick GL8 drove over quickly. Lu You saw the car and smiled as she bade farewell to Zhao Yongjun, song Rui, and the others. Then, she got into the car.

The Buick minivan also started up quickly and drove out of the club.

Lu You sat in the middle row behind the driver. She had a complicated expression on her face.

At this moment, a cold voice suddenly came from the back of the car,””Lu You!”

The moment Lu You heard this voice, her body couldn’t help but tremble slightly. She quickly turned her head and saw a woman in her thirties sitting in the last row. She had a cold arrogance on her face and was looking at her with a calm expression. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

This woman was actually quite pretty, but her temperament gave people a feeling that strangers should not approach her. In addition, although she was wearing a professional suit that was common in the workplace, it looked a little out of place no matter how you looked at it. You couldn’t tell what was wrong with it, but it made people feel a little awkward.

Lu You quickly nodded and said,””Good day, Deacon Liu!”

The female Deacon nodded her head slightly in response to Lu You. Then, she asked indifferently,””Lu You, how did the discussion go?”

Lu You hesitated for a moment.”Manager Liu, it might not be easy to buy a club … I’ve done some research. Although this Paradise Club has not been open for a long time, its business has always been very good. It’s developing very well. Such a club…”

“I don’t want to hear your reasons!” Deacon Liu frowned and said,”the spiritual energy here is so dense that even cultivators can’t help but wander around, let alone ordinary people.. Of course, their business would be good! I’m just asking if you can do this well and buy the club!”
