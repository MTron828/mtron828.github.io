2450 The opportunity for a breakthrough_Translator: 5496903After they returned to the courtyard in liuhai Lane, Xia ruofei asked Wu Xiujuan to prepare two guest rooms.

He had thought that only Ling Qingxue would be coming, so he had not asked anyone to prepare a guest room. He had even thought that he could use Ling Qingxue’s visit to the capital as an opportunity to ease the somewhat awkward relationship between the two of them. It would be best if they could sleep on the same bed again.

However, this time, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue came together. Xia ruofei knew that it was impossible for them to live together.

It was already noon when they returned from the airport. Ling Qingxue and Song Wei went back to their rooms to pack up and went to the backyard to have lunch with Xia ruofei.

After the meal, the three of them returned to the courtyard in the middle. Ling Qingxue said,””Ruofei, can you arrange a car for me? Tomorrow is the opening ceremony, and I’ll be going to the peach blossom gathering in the afternoon to see how senior brother Wu and the others are preparing. ”

The “senior brother Wu” that Ling Qingxue was talking about was one of Ling Xiaotian’s disciples. Previously, he had been working at the Ling’s private kitchen of the three mountains. This time, he had been sent to the capital city to take charge of the Ling’s private kitchen of the peach blossom society. He could be considered to be in charge of the work alone.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”no problem!” I’ll go with you in the afternoon! It just so happens that I haven’t been there for a while ...”

“Don’t go in the afternoon!” Ling Qingxue said,”Weiwei is looking for you for something!”

“Ah?” Xia ruofei was stunned.

“I’m fine!”Song Wei replied with a flushed face. What could happen to me?”

Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”how can it be fine?” Didn’t we have an agreement? I’ll let this guy accompany you in your cultivation in the afternoon! It’s my turn to cultivate at night ... Now that this guy often runs out, and our cultivation technique needs his cooperation, it’s not easy to catch him, so of course we have to seize the opportunity!”

“It’s okay to train ... We’ll have plenty of time in the future ...” Song Wei said shyly.

Xia ruofei looked at Ling Qingxue and then looked at Song Wei. He thought for a moment and nodded.”Alright then! I’ll get Wu Qiang to drive you, and ... I’ll give brother Zhao a call! They should be at the club today!”

Ling Qingxue smiled and nodded,”sure!” You just have to make the arrangements!”

Ling Qingxue then took Song Wei’s hand and said,””Wei Wei! We’ve already come to an agreement, what’s there to be embarrassed about? If we don’t take the initiative to seize the opportunity to cultivate, then when can we improve our cultivation? What if the gap between us gets bigger and bigger in the future?”

Xia ruofei laughed dryly at the side and did not say anything. Song Wei blushed and nodded her head, saying,”I got it!”

Xia ruofei called Wu Qiang over and gave him some instructions. He asked Wu Qiang to drive Ling Qingxue to the peach blossom Association in a Toyota Elfa car and stay there in the afternoon.

He then called Zhao Yongjun.

Zhao Yongjun, song Rui, and the others were all at the club, busy preparing for the opening ceremony tomorrow.

Zhao Yongjun heard Xia ruofei say that Ling Qingxue would be there in a while, so he said,””Let sister – in – Law do it! If there’s anything you need us to coordinate with the private restaurant, you can also find me directly!”

“Thanks!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Why are you being so polite with me!” Zhao Yongjun laughed and scolded,”besides, isn’t this our own business? That’s right! Your sister – in – Law just arrived in the capital and wanted to come over to see her. You’re a major shareholder, how can you still have the nerve to hide?”

Xia ruofei glanced at Song Wei and Ling Qingxue and said awkwardly,””Big brother Zhao, I have some things to do this afternoon and can’t leave. Otherwise, I would definitely go with Qingxue!”

Zhao Yongjun wasn’t song Rui. He wouldn’t keep harping on this matter. Since Xia ruofei had explained, he didn’t say anything more. He just smiled and said,””Then you have to come over tomorrow! Please don’t be late!”

“Definitely not! Brother Zhao, don’t worry! I’ll definitely arrive early tomorrow!” Xia ruofei said.

“Alright! I’m busy here! I won’t talk to you anymore!” Zhao Yongjun said.

“Good! Then see you tomorrow!”

After Xia ruofei hung up, he said to Ling Qingxue,””You’re familiar with brother Zhao and song Rui. They’ll be there this afternoon. You can find them if you need anything! We’re all family, and it’s our own business, so you’re welcome!”

“I got it!” Ling Qingxue said,”then I’ll go over directly!”

After she finished speaking, she winked at Song Wei and clenched her fist to cheer her on, causing Song Wei to blush again.

Ling Qingxue went to the back yard to get a car. Only Xia ruofei and Song Wei were left in the yard. The atmosphere suddenly became a little ambiguous.

Song Wei blushed and stared at her feet. She said softly,”Ruofei, you should rest for the afternoon!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Let’s not stand here and talk. Let’s go inside!”

“Ah?” Song Wei was stunned. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Ah what?” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”of course, I have to cultivate in the house! Are we going to set up a time formation in the courtyard?”

Then, Xia ruofei held onto Song Wei’s hand and led her into his house.

After entering the house, Xia ruofei saw that Song Wei was a little reserved. He could not help but smile and said,””Wei Wei, you’ve been here countless times. Why are you acting so distant today?”

Song Wei was very familiar with this room. It was here that she had insisted on removing the peach blossom miasma. Xia ruofei had taken the risk and accidentally discovered the spirit body combined cultivation method.
