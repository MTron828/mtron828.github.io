2222 China’s good boss (2)

Xia ruofei laughed! You’re wrong this time ... Not only can I not make money for the company, but I might even have to spend a lot of money!”

“Ah? What exactly is going on! Don’t keep me in suspense. ” Feng Rao said with a smile.

“It’s like this. When I just came out, I saw a lot of delivery men delivering food upstairs.” Xia ruofei said,”it’s not a long – term solution for our employees to order takeaway every day! On one hand, it was a waste of money. On the other hand, their health might not be guaranteed. After all, the hygiene conditions of many take – out businesses were worrying. It would be troublesome if they got food poisoning from eating! Besides, the employees are working hard for the company, so we have to keep up with the logistics!”

“I’ve also noticed the problem you mentioned. ” Feng Jing replied,”but I haven’t thought of a good solution yet. In fact, many companies are in the same situation now, and we’re not the only one. ”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and then continued,””Sister che, this is what I’m thinking. In the short term, we can sign an agreement with a branded food and beverage company and ask them to customize healthy meals for us every day. Then, we’ll count the number of people who need to eat every day and report it to them in advance. In this way, we can pay the other party monthly, and I plan to have the company provide a certain percentage of meal allowance for each employee who eats. This way, the employees can eat delicious and healthy meals, and we can save on expenses. ”

“That’s not a bad idea!” Feng Jing said,”but the company might have to increase its fixed expenses.”

“There’s no need to save on this kind of money!” Xia ruofei said without hesitation.

“Alright! Since the boss has spoken, I’ll ask President Dong to bring out a Constitution!” Feng Jing smiled and said,”once you’ve taken a look and there are no problems, we’ll start implementing it!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” This matter could not be delayed! The earlier this was resolved, the earlier the employees could enjoy this benefit! In addition, I think Ling Ji restaurant is not bad. They’re a civilian restaurant, and they’re also a well – known enterprise in the province. Their hygiene conditions are definitely up to standard, so we don’t have to worry too much about food safety. ”

“Most importantly, Ling Ji F & B has a close relationship with our Chairman, so it’s naturally easier to talk about cooperation!” Feng Rao laughed. I understand!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sister che, I’ve said it just now. This is just a temporary solution.” In the long run, it was imperative to set up a staff cafeteria in the peach blossom mansion. I see that we have a lot of vacant floors now, so we might as well take half of the floor and plan it as a staff cafeteria!”

“Swish!” Feng Rao exclaimed,”ruofei, you’re really generous! If you rent half of this building, the monthly rent is not a small amount!”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”I never thought of using the empty floor for rent!” “I think it’s necessary to set up an employee cafeteria. The company should also provide food subsidies. For example, for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, an individual only needs to pay 5 yuan or 8 Yuan to eat three meals, and the rest of the money will be subsidized by the company. I think we should introduce the credit card system in the college cafeteria. It can only deduct the cost of the meal once a day. That way, the staff can swipe the card for every meal, but the fee will only be charged the first time they swipe the card. It doesn’t matter if he eats one, two, or three meals a day. The deduction will be the same. ”

“I understand what you’re trying to say,” Feng Rao said,”since you have such an idea, I certainly won’t object.” I’ll put your instructions on paper as soon as possible, and then try to implement them as soon as possible!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”this isn’t really an instruction. You executives can also study and see if my proposal is feasible.” In addition, let the finance department estimate how much money we need to spend every month to subsidize the food. In short, we have to do enough preparation work!”

“Understood!” Feng Rao replied.

Xia ruofei said,”these two plans must be implemented as soon as possible.” Also, once you’ve decided, inform all the employees on the company’s intranet so that everyone can be happy!”

“Alright!” Feng Rao smiled and said,”ruofei, it’s rare to see a good boss like you!”

“Don’t flatter me!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Oh right, don’t waste the other half of the floor. Since there’s a canteen on this floor, it’s unlikely that we’ll turn the other half into an office space in the future. I think we should just make an activity room! Purchase some fitness equipment. If there is enough space, get a badminton court and two table tennis and pool tables. Nowadays, the White – collar workers in the company sit in the office and often don’t move for a long time after sitting down. The young ones either have problems with their cervical vertebra or their shoulders and neck, and they also have scapulohumeral periarthritis. We should encourage employees to exercise more after work. After the construction of this activity room, it will be open to employees for free. Not only can they exercise during their rest time, but there will also be a 20 – 30 – minute break in the morning and afternoon. For example, at 10 am, everyone has been working for more than an hour. He could go down and exercise, and then come back to work until the lunch break; Set a break time between three to fouro’ clock in the afternoon and stay there until you get off work. ”

“You’re really thoughtful!” Feng Jing laughed.”If the employees knew about this, they’d definitely praise you to the heavens!”

“You’re exaggerating! I hope that the employees can have a sense of belonging to the company! They had put in so much effort and energy for the company, and the company would definitely not treat them badly. Sister ran, I’ll have to trouble you to plan these things first!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Oh right, thank you for picking me up at the airport tomorrow.”

“Why are you being so polite? it’s part of my job!” Feng Rao laughed. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

After ending the call with Feng Jing, Xia ruofei had already walked out of the peach blossom mansion.

At this time, he remembered that his car was parked in the underground parking lot. He couldn’t help but Pat his forehead, then turned around and walked in with a bitter smile.

He glanced at the security guard on duty at the entrance of the building and found that it was a veteran he knew, so he simply threw the car key over and said,””Xiao bin! Please help me drive the car up from the underground parking lot!”

“Alright! President Xia, please wait a moment!” Xiao bin quickly said, then ran into the building, from the stairs to the underground parking lot.

After a while, Xiao bin drove Xia ruofei’s Knight XV SUV to the ground.

Xia ruofei thanked Xiao bin, who had jumped out of the car, then got into the car and left, returning to the villa area by the river.

The house was quiet. It seemed like Ling Qingxue didn’t come back in the afternoon. Song Wei went back to the Provincial Party Committee’s family courtyard.

Xia ruofei laughed bitterly. He did not know what kind of situation he was in right now. Speaking of which, the two of them had already tacitly acknowledged the existence of this relationship, but it was as if he did not have a girlfriend. On the contrary, even Ling Qingxue had deliberately distanced herself from him.

Xia ruofei knew that it would take some time. Since the matter had been made clear, he could not rush it. He could only take it slow.

He went to the kitchen and made himself a simple lunch.

He didn’t go out in the afternoon. He had a short lunch break, then got up to clean the house. Then he went to the living room on the first floor to watch TV for a while.

As the sky gradually darkened, Xia ruofei started to look forward to it. However, neither Ling Qingxue nor Song Wei appeared.

Xia ruofei took out his phone and opened WeChat a few times, wanting to ask if the two of them would come over to cultivate tonight. However, in the end, he did not send anything and exited WeChat.

He shook his head with a bitter smile and went to the kitchen to make himself a bowl of noodles to finish his dinner.

It was a quiet night.

The next morning, Xia ruofei woke up early and cultivated for a while.

He did not go to the company in the morning. Instead, he chose to make tea at home and read a book. It was a rare moment of leisure.

At twoo’ clock in the afternoon, Xia ruofei, who had taken a short nap, got up and washed up. He changed into a tailored suit and went downstairs to drive straight to the peach Garden building.
