2550 Super long – range hanging shot (1)

In the stands, in front of the television, in front of the computer screens ... Countless Spanish and Chinese fans finally felt relieved.

Even louder cheers rang out in the away team stands.

Wu Lei rushed towards Xia ruofei as soon as he scored the goal. He pointed at Xia ruofei with a bright smile.

This gesture was very obvious. On one hand, it meant that most of the credit for the goal was Xia ruofei ‘s. On the other hand, it was to express his gratitude.

Xia ruofei laughed and ran over to hug Wu Lei. He ruffled Wu Lei’s hair and said loudly,””Lei Zi, that was a beautiful shot!”

Soon, the other players of Espanyol rushed up and surrounded Xia ruofei and Wu Lei.

After the referee confirmed that the goal was valid, the Spanish players had already walked back to their own half of the field with their arms around each other.

On the substitutes ‘bench, puado was still complaining to another substitute a moment ago, saying that Chinese football was weak, that Chinese players were not capable, but because of the boss, they got a lot of playing time, and that it was unfair to everyone.

However, the next moment, the two Chinese players on the field completed a beautiful cooperation and scored a goal.

There was no other Spanish player involved in the ball from the beginning to the end. Xia ruofei successfully intercepted it and then sent out a beautiful assist. Finally, Wu Lei completed the final blow.

Puador’s eyes instantly widened, as if his neck was being clutched, he couldn’t say a single word, his face alternating between red and white.

Without comparison, there would be no harm.

Compared to the two Chinese players who were substituted, puado’s performance in the first 30 minutes was simply a pile of stinky sh * t ...

The players on the substitutes ‘bench were also celebrating happily. As for Xia ruofei, Wu Lei, and the other players on the field, they did not notice the ashen – faced puado in the corner of the substitutes’ bench.

As the team was still one goal behind, the Spanish players quickly returned to their own half and urged the Valensia players to kick off quickly.

On the other hand, Valencia’s players were dilly – dallying. As long as the referee did not rush them, they would try to delay. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

After all, there were only two to three minutes left in the first half of the game, and the score was 2 – 1, with the home team still leading by one goal. Although it was a little unpleasant to be scored by the opponent at the end of the first half, it was better than being scored two times in a row, right?

Generally speaking, the team’s morale was the highest right after a goal. If they were not careful in their defense, it was likely that the opponent would continue to work hard and score more goals in one go.

If he returned to the locker room with a score of 2 – 2, he would be in deep trouble.

By the time the valentian team kicked off again, the regular time for the first half of the game was about to enter the last minute. The fourth official was already standing on the sidelines with the go – in card. As long as the time jumped to 45 minutes, the fourth official would raise the card.

The Spanish players did not give up just because they were running out of time. As soon as Valencia kicked off, the entire team immediately rushed forward and surrounded her.

Valencia was also a strong team with a long history. When faced with the Espanyol’s pursuit for the high post, they did not panic but passed the ball back and forth in the middle of the backfield in an orderly manner.

Valencia’s goal was very clear. They did not plan to take the initiative to attack with little time left in the first half. They just wanted to drag the time out until the end.

Like Xia ruofei and igglasias, Wu Lei was also crazily pressing forward.

Needless to say, the effect of the players in the middle and front field launching a rush at the same time in unison was really good.

The valentian team’s pass was getting closer and closer to their goal and was finally blocked by the Spanish team. They were a little unwilling to send a big kick to the front field, so they chose to return the pass to the goalkeeper.

At that moment, Wu Lei was almost in front of him, but Valencia’s defender was a little hasty, so his strength was slightly reduced.

Wu Lei’s flexibility was fully displayed at this time. The moment the other side passed the ball, he had quickly changed direction and changed to chasing after the ball.

The valentian goalkeeper, Neto, reacted quickly. When he saw that the pass was too small, he quickly abandoned the goal and went out.

Both Wu Lei and Neto were trying their best to chase after the football. In the end, because the football was rolling in the direction of the goal, Neto arrived in front of the ball a little earlier. He did not hesitate to make a long kick, trying to drive the ball to the front field.

At this time, Wu Lei had already caught up, and he subconsciously extended his foot to block it.

Wu Lei’s foot touched the ball, and the football changed direction. It did not fly toward the RCD Espanyol’s half of the field, but to the right flank.

Xia ruofei was in that area. Normally, it would be hard for the players to react to such a change in direction ball, but Xia ruofei’s reaction was much faster than the other players. A Valencia defender should have been closer to the ball, but he was stunned for a moment. Xia ruofei, on the other hand, regained his senses almost instantly and chased after the ball with big steps.

Xia ruofei intercepted the ball before Valencia’s defenders could. He did not make any adjustments or even lift his head. He kicked the middle part of the ball, and the ball flew in a high and Floating Arc towards Valencia’s goal!
