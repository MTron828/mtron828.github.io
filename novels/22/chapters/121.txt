Chapter 122: A medical miracle (1)

The second chapter, please subscribe! MA Xiong had noticed Xia ruofei a long time ago, but he was too young to think that she was Dean Qin’s assistant. MA Xiong was shocked by Dean Qin’s words. He quickly stood up and said to Xia ruofei,””So it’s Xia Sheng who used the hand of rejuvenation. I’m sorry for being impolite ...” Xia ruofei stepped forward to support MA Xiong. He smiled and said,””Old Mr. MA, you’re still very weak. Don’t mind these formalities. Quickly lie down and rest.” “No problem! I’m feeling great now. ” MA Xiong asked,”may I know which leading medical expert Mr. Xia is studying under?” Ma Zhiming said from the side,”daddy, Xia Sheng is a very skilled Chinese medicine doctor. Even ... Even my father-in-law’s acute myocardial infarction was saved in time by Xia Sheng!” I’m the one who invited him to treat you. ” Ma Zhiming originally wanted to say that Huanhuan’s autism was basically cured by Xia ruofei. However, considering MA Xiong’s physical condition, he was worried that he would be too emotional, so he changed his words at the last minute. “I see ...” MA Xiong said,”Mr. Xia, thank you so much ...” Xia ruofei smiled.”You’re welcome, old Mr. MA. You’re still very weak. You can rest here for the night and be discharged tomorrow morning.” We won’t disturb you any longer ...” Xia ruofei then gestured to Ma Zhiming and Dean Qin, and the three of them walked out together. Xia ruofei said as he walked.”Mr. MA, I hope you can keep the fact that I’m treating old Mr. MA a secret. I don’t want to be too shocking.” “Alright, alright!” Ma Zhiming quickly said,”Dean Qin, you have to tell the doctors and nurses about this. Tell them not to say anything when they go out. Also ... Don’t make a big fuss when my dad gets discharged tomorrow. We’ll leave quietly, and after a while, we’ll announce that my dad’s condition is stable and he’s resting at home. ” “Yes, master Ming!” Dean Qin said. The two of them had no doubts about Xia ruofei’s words that MA Xiong would be discharged the next morning. In fact, even if Xia ruofei said that he was actually Superman who wore his underwear on the outside, the two of them would probably believe him without a doubt. What he had witnessed today was too shocking. The three of them talked as they left the ICU. As soon as they appeared at the door, their relatives, who had different thoughts, surrounded them. Seeing Ma Zhiming’s Red eyes, Ma Jia immediately exclaimed,”Ming! Is second uncle’s condition not good? Didn’t I say that this mainlander was a liar?! How much money did he cheat you of? We’ll call the police immediately!” Ma Zhiming pulled a long face and said seriously,”Horse Deputy! If you dare to speak rudely to Xia Sheng again, don’t blame me for not acknowledging you as my cousin!” After he finished speaking, Ma Zhiming no longer paid attention to Ma Jia. Instead, he looked around and said loudly,”Everyone, disperse! Go back to work in the company! My dad’s condition has stabilized and he’s out of the critical stage. ” Ma Jia was dumbfounded. She had arrived at the hospital earlier than Ma Zhiming, so she was very clear about MA Xiong’s condition. The doctor had clearly said that it was very likely that he wouldn’t be able to last more than a day. How could his condition have stabilized so quickly and even passed the critical period? “This ... How is this possible?” Ma Jia cried out. Ma Zhiming suddenly turned his head and stared at Ma Jia, as if he could see through her heart. He stared at Ma Jia until she looked away guiltily. Ma Zhiming then asked meaningfully,”Sister Quan, do you really want something to happen to my dad?” “How could that be?!” Ma Jia quickly replied. You’ve misunderstood me, Ming. I ... I ... I’m just ...” Ma Zhiming snorted softly. Without waiting for Ma Jia to finish speaking, he directly walked toward his wife, Tian Huixin, and his daughter, Huanhuan. “Is daddy alright?” Tian Huixin asked. “Mm! Don’t worry!” Ma Zhiming nodded and said,”you know Xia Sheng’s medical skills.” Tian Huixin smiled and nodded. Then, she squatted down and said to Huan Huan,””Huanhuan, let’s invite uncle Xia to our house, okay?” Huan Huan immediately clapped her hands happily and said,””Alright!” “Xiao Xia, stay at our house tonight!” Tian Huixin smiled and said,”Huanhuan likes you so much. I also want you to play with her more.” “Alright! “Then I’ll have to trouble you ...” Xia ruofei smiled. “I won’t disturb you, I won’t disturb you!” Ma Zhiming said happily,”we can’t wait to welcome you!” The three of them left the hospital with Huanhuan. Ma Jia and her relatives looked at each other in dismay. Ma Zhiming’s family and Xia ruofei were sent to MA Xiong’s mansion on qianshui Bay Road by a Toyota. Xia ruofei’s eyes were opened. The mansion covered an area of nearly 20000 square feet and was located in the shallow bay, also known as the “Eastern Hawaii,” so its value could be imagined. Compared to this luxurious mansion with a tennis court in the front and a swimming pool in the back, Xia ruofei’s holiday villa in Sanshan city was simply too shabby! Naturally, the happiest person was Huanhuan when Xia ruofei arrived. She kept playing with Xia ruofei and laughed happily from time to time. The servants at home had never seen the young miss like this before. In the past, Huanhuan was always immersed in her own world and basically ignored others. Even when she was with Ma Zhiming and Tian Huixin, she was not as close as other children. It was already late when they got home. After dinner, Huanhuan kept pestering Xia ruofei to play games. Tian Huixin urged her several times before she reluctantly went to take a shower and sleep. Xia ruofei also returned to the guest room that Tian Huixin had arranged for him. The next morning, Ma Zhiming rushed to the hospital to pick up MA Xiong from the hospital. Before he was discharged, Dean Qin personally arranged for MA Xiong to do a thorough examination. The results shocked Dean Qin again. A series of brain CT and MRI results showed that the ruptured blood vessels in MA Xiong’s brain had been completely repaired. Not only that, but all the previous bleeding had also been naturally absorbed. Even some parts of his body that had suffered irreversible damage had miraculously recovered. In other words, MA Xiong was a completely healthy person now, even healthier than before he fell sick. Dean Qin felt like he had wasted all his years of studying medicine. Everything that had happened yesterday had completely overturned his understanding of medicine. Dean Qin’s medical skills were very high, and his love for medicine was beyond doubt. It was because of this that his heart felt like it was being scratched by a kitten. He really wanted to get to know Xia ruofei and discuss the treatment with him in depth. Xia ruofei only used one dose of medicine during the entire treatment to save the patient with a cerebral hemorrhage. It was a perfect recovery. This was definitely unprecedented. If the results were summed up, it would not be a problem to win the Nobel Prize in Medicine. However, Ma Zhiming knew that Xia ruofei did not like to be disturbed, so he naturally rejected Dean Qin’s request. Not only that, but he also repeatedly told Dean Qin to keep his mouth shut. Dean Qin could only helplessly watch MA Xiong and his son get into the car and leave. He felt like he had missed a great medical breakthrough, and he was quite unwilling, but there was nothing he could do. Not only that, but he also had to keep his mouth shut. Otherwise, he would not be able to keep his current job, let alone make a breakthrough in his medical research. MA Xiong was also anxious to return home. After the results came out, MA Xiong finally realized how serious his illness was yesterday. Without Xia ruofei, he would have died. Ma Zhiming also told him that Xia ruofei had cured Huanhuan’s autism, which made him even more excited. Huanhuan was the Pearl in his palm! Therefore, MA Xiong, the tycoon of Hong Kong, was thinking about how to thank Xia ruofei.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com
