Chapter 3705: How many are happy and how many are sad (2)

Translator: 549690339

The image of the chubby baby weapon spirit appeared in Xia ruofei’s mind. He held back his laughter and said,””Senior mu, you’ve gained something, so you won’t be returning empty – handed!”

“What’s the difference if 1 return empty – handed?” Mu Sheng smiled bitterly and then asked,”little brother Xia, how’s your harvest? Did your talent improve?”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”it should be an improvement!” I didn’t get any other treasures, so it should be an increase in my talent. However, I don’t know how much my talent has improved compared to before …”

No matter what treasures Xia ruofei had obtained, at least he would not return empty – handed.

As for the quality of the treasure, Chen Nanfeng had already done his best. He had even asked Chen Xuan to pass the first heaven society’s mystic essence Scripture to Xia ruofei. If Xia ruofei still couldn’t get a good treasure under such circumstances, then there was no one to blame.

Chen Nanfeng tried his best to sense it, but it was still a little blurry. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Of course, this was a normal situation. Previously, he was not able to sense the interior of the seven Star Pavilion clearly. As long as the situation of being completely shrouded in fog did not appear again, he would be more at ease.

Although Chen Nanfeng could not clearly sense what the treasure that was flying in Xia ruofei’s direction was, he could still vaguely sense that it was of a pretty good grade.

Chen Nanfeng could not help but secretly heave a sigh of relief. This way, the favor he owed Xia ruofei was almost paid back.

Chen Nanfeng’s spirit was roused as he continued to channel his vital Qi to maintain the seven stars Pavilion’s activation.

In the seven Star Pavilion, Xia ruofei sat cross – legged on a floating rock. Although he was also cultivating the mysterious origin Scripture, he did not fully devote himself to the study like he had just done. Instead, he sat there and cultivated according to the experience he had concluded.

With Chen Nanfeng’s blurry senses, he could not tell if Xia ruofei was fully focused on cultivation.

Very quickly, the light was getting closer and closer. In the blink of an eye, it was in front of Xia ruofei.

A golden flying sword floated in front of Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei opened his eyes and took a closer look. This was an extra Dharma Treasure that the chubby kid’s weapon spirit had given to Xia ruofei in order to not arouse Chen Nanfeng’s suspicion.

Of course, even if it was an extra treasure, the chubby baby’s weapon spirit still looked at Xia ruofei in a new light. Besides, if nothing unexpected happened, the entire Seven Star Pavilion would belong to Xia ruofei in the future. So, he would naturally not be stingy and would not give him an ordinary treasure.

Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to scan the sword and could see it clearly.

The Golden flying sword was of high quality. Even though it was slightly inferior to his blue travel immortal sword, it was still considered a rare flying sword in the cultivation world. It was not inferior to the flying sword that Chen Xuan had obtained from the seven Star Pavilion.

Xia ruofei silently calculated the time and felt that Chen Nanfeng should be closing the seven Star Pavilion soon. Hence, he did not delay any longer and immediately kept the Golden flying sword.

Xia ruofei didn’t drip his blood on this flying sword to make it his master because he was more comfortable with the blue travel immortal sword. Moreover, the quality of the blue travel immortal sword was even better than this golden flying sword. Naturally, he wouldn’t change his Dharma Treasure. As for this flying sword, Xia ruofei was only keeping it for now. When the time was right, he would give it to his close friends.

Not long after Xia ruofei kept the flying sword, he felt a slight dizziness. Then, he appeared at the entrance of the seven Star Pavilion.

It was obvious that Chen Nanfeng could sense the situation on his side. Seeing that he had already obtained the Dharma Treasure, he directly teleported him outside.

Of course, Xia ruofei already had control of the seven stars order. If he did not want Chen Nanfeng to sense his situation, he could do it with a mere thought.

However, Xia ruofei would definitely not do that because it would be meaningless. It would only make Chen Nanfeng suspicious.

The moment Xia ruofei left the seven Star Pavilion, Chen Nanfeng, who had his eyes slightly closed, opened his eyes and nodded at Xia ruofei with a smile.

There were still a few cultivators in the seven Star Pavilion who had yet to come out. Chen Nanfeng was maintaining the operation of the seven Star Pavilion, so he did not say anything.

Xia ruofei did not disturb Chen Nanfeng. He bowed slightly to Chen Nanfeng and then retreated to a corner. Like the other cultivators, he waited quietly.

Xia ruofei took a look at the seven Star Pavilion, which stood in the middle of the garden in the back hall. He could not help but feel a little emotional.

This was the treasure of the first heaven society!

Now, if he wanted to, he could completely replace Chen Nanfeng and control the seven Star Pavilion. His control level might even be higher than Chen Nanfeng’s.

Including shrinking the seven Star Pavilion and storing it in his dantian, he only needed a thought.

Of course, Xia ruofei would not do such a crazy thing. After looking at the seven Star Pavilion, he immediately looked away.

“Little brother Xia!” A low voice was heard.

Xia ruofei turned around and looked at the source of the voice. He smiled and said in a low voice,””Senior mu, you’re out too?”

The person who called Xia ruofei was Mu Sheng.

Mu Sheng smiled and said,”I’ve been out for a long time. In fact, most of the cultivators have already left the seven Star Pavilion. 1 saw that you haven’t come out for a long time, so I waited for you here.”

Xia ruofei nodded and asked,”senior mu, how was your trip to the seven Star Pavilion?”

Mu Sheng opened his palm with a bitter smile and said,””You can see for yourself!”

Xia ruofei took a closer look. It was a spiritual stone in Mu Sheng’s hand. The spiritual energy in it was quite low. It was obvious that it had lost some of its spiritual energy after a long time.

“You only got one spiritual stone?” Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and asked.

“Isn’t it?” Mu Sheng smiled bitterly,”! thought that even if I couldn’t improve my talent, I could at least get some good treasures. I didn’t expect that he would only give me one Spirit stone!” If this seven stars Pavilion really has an Artifact Spirit, it must be a stingy one!”

The image of the chubby baby weapon spirit appeared in Xia ruofei’s mind. He held back his laughter and said,””Senior mu, you’ve gained something, so you won’t be returning empty – handed!”

“What’s the difference if I return empty – handed?” Mu Sheng smiled bitterly and then asked,”little brother Xia, how’s your harvest? Did your talent improve?”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”it should be an improvement!” “1 didn’t get any other treasures, so it should be an increase in my talent. However, I don’t know how much my talent has improved compared to before …” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but think of the chubby baby weapon spirit. He tried to hold back his laughter and said,””Senior mu, you’ve gained something, so you won’t be returning empty – handed!”

“What’s the difference if 1 return empty – handed?” Mu Sheng smiled bitterly and then asked,”little brother Xia, how’s your harvest? Did your talent improve?”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”it should be an improvement!” “I didn’t get any other treasures, so it should be an increase in my talent. However, I don’t know how much my talent has improved compared to before …” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but think of the chubby baby weapon spirit. He tried to hold back his laughter and said,””Senior mu, you’ve gained something, so you won’t be returning empty – handed!”

“What’s the difference if I return empty – handed?” Mu Sheng smiled bitterly and then asked,”little brother Xia, how’s your harvest? Did your talent improve?”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”it should be an improvement!” I didn’t get any other treasures, so it should be the increase in my talent. However, I don’t know how much my talent has improved compared to before … I guess! 1 didn’t get any other treasures, so it should be an increase in my talent. However, 1 don’t know how much my talent has improved compared to before ….”
