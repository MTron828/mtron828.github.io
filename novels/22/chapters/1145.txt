Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei nodded and smiled.””This Old House is quite particular!”

“Of course! Overstepping the rules is a serious crime, and there are rules on what kind of residence an official of different rank will live in. ” Zhao Yongjun laughed and said,”there’s a lot of knowledge in this.”

“Ruofei, let’s go in. I’ll introduce you as we walk!” Wu shuheng said enthusiastically.

Thus, the group of people began to slowly walk inside.

There was a rack of grapes in the middle of the first courtyard, forming a green passage that directly connected to the drooping flower door of the second courtyard. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

There was a row of roses and peonies on the right side of the courtyard, two pomegranate trees in the corner, and a walnut tree on the left.

Wu shuheng brought Xia ruofei to the walnut tree. There was a passage with a glass roof and a row of steps leading down.

Wu shuheng smiled and said,”this used to be the cellar of the old house. The approval process was easier five years ago, so I took the opportunity to expand it into a two – story basement. There’s now a wine cellar, a gym, an audio and visual hall, a tea room, a storage room, and so on. It’s very functional!”

Xia ruofei and song Rui couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise. This was a huge sum of money!

This could only be done a few years ago. Now that the control was becoming stricter, it was absolutely impossible to complete the procedures for expanding the basement.

The house was so big, and there were two levels of basements under it, so the area was even more impressive.

Xia ruofei suggested to go down and take a look with interest.

Wu shuheng nodded and led them down the steps. After passing through a fingerprint lock, they went down to the basement.

There was a large hall on the first underground floor. It was about two to three hundred square meters in size and was covered with a thick cashmere carpet. There was a huge screen on the wall in front of it, and on the opposite side were three rows of soft, luxurious seats. Xia ruofei even suspected that he had entered the VIP hall of a movie theater.

At this moment, Wu shuheng smiled and said,””I like to watch movies, but I used to be busy with work and didn’t have time to go to the cinema often, so I often missed some blockbusters. So, I built a movie hall at home and installed a full set of professional digital video and audio systems. The effect of watching blockbusters is no worse than watching them in the cinema!”

Xia ruofei was speechless.

In addition to the Super large music and entertainment Hall, there was a fully equipped fitness room, an entertainment room with a standard snooker table and ping pong table, and a tea room decorated in an antique style.

Although it was a basement, the courtyard was very large, and there were lighting Windows next to some of the flowerbeds. With the addition of a natural light illumination system, the lighting was quite sufficient.

The second underground floor was divided into two. In addition to a large storage room, there was also a large wine cellar. Rows of wine racks looked spectacular, but since Wu shuheng had already migrated overseas, the wine cellar was now empty and did not store any red wine.

Even so, Xia ruofei and song Rui, who were visiting for the first time, could not help but secretly click their tongues. It was too luxurious to turn such a large space into a wine cellar.

Xia ruofei was also thinking to himself. If he bought this courtyard house, the first thing he would renovate would be this wine cellar.

This was because he already had the best wine storage space and did not need such a large space.

Of course, it was fine to leave a small portion and put some wine on it for show.

However, even if he wanted to renovate it, Xia ruofei did not know what to do. The courtyard house was quite large, and there were two levels of basements. Its functions were already very complete.

Xia ruofei felt a sense of absurdity when he thought about how he would be worried about the size of the house, especially when it was located in the center of the capital where every inch of land was worth its weight in gold.

However, there was still time to worry about these things after he had bought the house. Xia ruofei did not have to think so much now.

After the tour of the basement, Wu shuheng led the three of them further in.

Through the door of drooping flowers was the second courtyard. On the north side was the main hall and master bedroom. In the middle was a large courtyard with a Lotus VAT, pomegranate trees, grape trees, and lilac planted in it. It looked quiet and elegant.

The main room was very spacious and had an antique look on the outside, but the interior was very comfortable and had all kinds of modern equipment.

The second yard was the living space of the owner. In addition to the Lotus VAT and a small fish pond, Wu shuheng had also renovated a small swimming pool.

Wu shuheng smiled and introduced,”ruofei, I’ve put in a lot of effort when I was renovating this house. I’ve renovated it as old as possible without changing the appearance. The internal facilities have been modernized and intelligent as much as possible. The entire house has a floor heating system, central air conditioning, and many smart home appliances. I’ve put in a lot of money back then!”

“I can tell.” Xia ruofei said,”brother Wu put in a lot of thought into this house.”

“I bought it for my own use, so I used the best materials.” Wu shuheng said with a smile.

The group continued their tour.

The third courtyard was slightly smaller, but it still had eight or nine rooms and a small courtyard. This was mainly a place for utility purposes. The kitchen was also set up in this courtyard. There were also public washrooms, drying rooms, servant rooms, and so on.

In order to ensure the privacy of the owner’s living space, a small door was opened in the backyard for the servants to enter and exit. At the same time, there was a passage in the West that directly connected to the first courtyard. This way, the second courtyard could be relatively isolated. At the same time, it was surrounded by two courtyards, so it was naturally safer.
