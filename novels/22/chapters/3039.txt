Translator: 5496903Before Xia ruofei could finish, Luo Qingfeng kneeled on the ground with red eyes and said in a choked voice,””Master, what did this old servant do to deserve such love from master ...”

“Get up!” Xia ruofei said,”not all of these are for you. Many of them are also for the sake of increasing the overall strength of the star Seizer sect. The stronger the star Seizer sect is, the more help it will be to me!”

In fact, besides the glittering jewel Wonderland, many of these cultivation methods were obtained from the nested space of Yuntai scholar. However, Xia ruofei had also made a copy of them in the space and kept the original for himself. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Luo Qingfeng stood up and said firmly,””Master, this old servant will definitely look after this family business for master in the future! Do your best to increase the sect’s strength. When master needs it, you only need to say the word and the entire star Seizer sect will go through fire and water ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and interrupted Luo Qingfeng. He smiled and said,””I definitely won’t let my own people go through fire and water. You’ve been by my side for a while, don’t you know that? Qingfeng, don’t think too much. Just focus on developing the star Seizer sect. That’s the greatest help you can give me! Of course, I’ll contact you at any time if there’s anything. In the future, when you’ve cultivated enough disciples to guard the star Seizer sect, you can also go to the peach source Island to cultivate for a period of time every year. After all, the environment there is better. ”

“Yes! This old servant understands!” “Thank you, master!” Qingfeng Luo said excitedly.

Xia ruofei nodded and continued,””Oh right, I almost forgot about this ...”

With that, Xia ruofei took out a big bag from the medium and placed it on the table with a clang.

The opening of the bag wasn’t tied tightly, and a spirit stone fell out.

Qingfeng Luo’s eyes twitched. He walked up and opened the bag. He was stunned to find that it was full of 50000 to 60000 spirit stones.

Very quickly, Luo Qingfeng understood Xia ruofei’s intention. He quickly waved his hands in fear and said,””Master, you can’t do that! You’ve already given this old servant and the star Seizer sect too many favors! I definitely wouldn’t dare to accept this spirit stone ...”

Luo Qingfeng did not know that Xia ruofei had made a fortune from the storage ring. He knew that Xia ruofei had spent a lot of spiritual stones to buy the storage ring and the mysterious ore. Later on, he had also lent a large number of spiritual stones to Chen Xuan. Hence, he guessed that Xia ruofei did not have many spiritual stones left.

Under such circumstances, how could he dare to accept the 50000 to 60000 spiritual stones that Xia ruofei had given him?

Xia ruofei said nonchalantly,”just take it. Spiritual stones are not only useful for cultivation. More importantly, they can be used as money in the cultivation world. If you want to develop your sect, you’ll definitely need spiritual stones in many ways.” I still have a lot of spirit stones on hand, and these are only a small portion. You can keep them with peace of mind!”

Luo Qingfeng could not believe it. He knew that Xia ruofei did not even know what spiritual stones were before he attended the auction. In order to raise the spiritual stones needed to buy the storage ring, Xia ruofei had even refined Qi – gathering pills and sent them to the auction.

After the auction, Luo Qingfeng had not left Xia ruofei’s side. Where did Xia ruofei get so many spiritual stones from?

Therefore, Luo Qingfeng thought that Xia ruofei was just telling a white lie so that he would accept it.

However, it was precisely because of this misunderstanding that Luo Qingfeng was even more touched and followed Xia ruofei even more loyally.

“This ...” Luo Qingfeng looked troubled.

Xia ruofei’s face darkened. He frowned and said,””What’s wrong? Are my words not effective?”

Luo Qingfeng hurriedly lowered his head and said,” He didn’t dare! Master, how would this old servant dare to disobey your orders?”

“Then accept it!” Xia ruofei said in an unquestionable tone,”and this, it’s specially for you. Stay in the star Seizer sect and cultivate. You’re still too weak!”

Luo Qingfeng looked up and saw that Xia ruofei was holding a crystal in his hand. He was so scared that he almost lost his soul.

Not to mention crystals, even spiritual crystals were precious treasures to Luo Qingfeng. Now, Xia ruofei had given him a crystal with such pure energy? He could not believe his eyes.

In fact, he had no idea that Xia ruofei had obtained at least a few hundred thousand spiritual stones, a few thousand spiritual crystals, and a thousand origin crystals from the nested space left by master Yuntai.

Therefore, taking out 50000 spiritual stones to develop the star Seizer sect and giving Luo Qingfeng an origin crystal was not a big expense for Xia ruofei.

After all, Luo Qingfeng was absolutely loyal to him. One crystal was just a necessary investment to make Luo Qingfeng stronger. To Xia ruofei, this was a sure win.

Seeing that Luo Qingfeng was in a daze and did not speak for a long time, Xia ruofei could not help but frown. He directly stuffed the crystal into Luo Qingfeng’s hand and said,””Keep these well! I should go! If there’s an emergency, you can contact me through your phone!”

Xia ruofei could use his phone normally on the Peach Blossom Island. In the past, there had been no cell phone signal here at the star Seizer sect. However, signal towers had been installed on the nearby mountains. With that, cell phones could be used normally in most parts of the star Seizer sect.

Speaking of which, this was the credit of Wang Boshan. It was when he was in charge of the sect’s secular Affairs, through coordination, that he was able to build two base stations in this barren mountain.

Luo Qingfeng came back to his senses and quickly said,””Yes! Master, these origin crystals ...”

This time, he didn’t dare to decline directly, but his hesitation was still obvious.

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”I’m giving it to you. You should keep it. When have you ever seen me take back something I’ve given away?”

“...Yes!” “Thank you, master!” Luo Qingfeng said.

After saying that, Luo Qingfeng did not hesitate any longer. He immediately kept all the crystals, spiritual stones, and the martial arts manuals that Xia ruofei had given him into his storage ring. Then, he bowed to Xia ruofei.

He didn’t say much. As the saying goes, words can’t express gratitude for a great favor. If he said too many words of thanks at this time, it would be useless. It would depend on his future actions.

After a long time, Luo Qingfeng straightened up and said,””Master, this old servant will send you off!”

“En!” Xia ruofei nodded.

The matters at the star Seizer sect were basically done. The foundation had been laid, and they had been given a lot of cultivation resources. It was time for Xia ruofei to return to the peach source Island.

At this moment, Xia ruofei was anxious to go home.

Luo Qingfeng accompanied Xia ruofei to the top floor of zhaixing tower. Then, the two of them leaped onto the roof. In fact, Xia ruofei had jumped onto the roof first, and Luo Qingfeng had followed without knowing the reason.

Because if it was just sword Kinesis flight, the cultivator could directly release the flying sword, then jump out of the window, step on the flying sword, and fly away.

This was the highest point of the entire star Seizer sect. Standing on the roof of the house, one could see many antique – looking buildings scattered in a picturesque disorder in the valley where clouds and mist were curling up. The spiritual Qi in the air was still slowly rising at a steady rate.

Xia ruofei looked back at the beautiful scenery and said to Luo Qingfeng,””Qingfeng, look at this. Isn’t it beautiful? This is not only a force that I, Xia ruofei, have cultivated, but it is also the foundation of your survival. You must guard this Foundation well!”

“Yes!” Luo Qingfeng said with a serious expression. Master! This old servant will definitely remember master’s teachings!”

Xia ruofei nodded and did not say anything else. He simply said, “I’m leaving!”

Then, Luo Qingfeng saw Xia ruofei flip his hand, and a small and exquisite black flying boat appeared in his palm.

Then, Xia ruofei threw the flying boat out. The black flying boat expanded in the wind and became more than 20 meters long in the blink of an eye. It was a matte black with sharp edges and corners, and it exuded a futuristic feeling ..
