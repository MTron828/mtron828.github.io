Chapter 3638: Concentrating on cultivation (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei hesitated but did not stop Li Yifu. Instead, he accepted the three kowtows.

Then, Xia ruofei raised his hands slightly. Li Yifu, who had already broken through to the beginning stage of the Golden core realm, felt a gentle force lifting him up.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”my adopted husband, congratulations!” I’ve finally broken through the threshold of Jindan!”

Zheng Yongshou, Song Wei, and Ling Qingxue were all envious. Even Tang Haoran secretly clenched his fists and encouraged himself.

“If it wasn’t for senior granduncle,” Li Yifu said in a trembling voice,”I’m afraid that my cultivation would have stopped at refined Qi Level 3 for the rest of my life. Everything 1 have today was given to me by senior granduncle!”

Before Li Yifu met Xia ruofei, he never even dared to dream that he would be able to break through to the Golden core stage one day. At that time, he had relied on an incomplete technique to explore and cultivate by himself. It was extremely difficult for him to break through even one level of the Qi refining stage. He had to waste 20 to 30 years in the third level of the Qi refining stage.

After he met Xia ruofei, he had completed his cultivation technique and obtained unimaginable cultivation resources. He also had the precious wild tea and Vermillion Jade Fruit. Even the core disciples of the big sects might not be able to enjoy such treatment. Hence, his cultivation level had been rising rapidly.

Breaking through to the early – Stage golden core realm had an even more special meaning for Li Yifu.

This was because he was already in his fifties. If he remained stuck at the Qi refining stage, his body would quickly enter a declining period. At that time, it would be even more difficult to break through. Once one’s lifespan was exhausted, there would be nothing they could do.

Once one broke through to the Golden core stage, it would be like a carp leaping through the Dragon Gate. One’s lifespan would be extended by a large margin, and the body would also gain great benefits from the breakthrough, just like a computer system update.

In fact, Li Yifu’s age was considered young even among golden core cultivators.

Qingfeng Luo was much older than Yifu li.

People like Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan, who had reached the Golden core stage at such a young age, were extremely rare in the cultivation world on earth. Chen Xuan was born from his own talent and the first heaven society’s vast amount of resources. In the entire first heaven society, he was the only one who could break through to the gold core realm at such a young age. On the other hand, Xia ruofei had endless opportunities. In terms of resources, he was not any less than Chen Xuan.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”there’s no need to say this. You’re able to achieve what you’ve achieved. It’s the result of your own efforts.” Otherwise, no matter how many resources 1 give you, it’ll be in vain.”

Li Yifu felt the true energy in his body slowly transforming into vital Qi, and he was filled with mixed feelings.

Song Wei, Ling Qingxue, and Zheng Yongshou also came forward to congratulate Li Yifu.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it seems like 1 have good foresight!” They had prepared a celebratory feast in advance! Now that her adopted husband had successfully broken through to Jindan and ended his closed – door cultivation, everyone could have a good celebration! Let’s go! Don’t stand here and talk, let’s go upstairs!”

“Martial granduncle even prepared a feast?” Li Yifu asked doubtfully.

“Don’t listen to his nonsense …” Ling Qingxue said, feeling angry and amused at the same time.”He’s obviously hungry. He just happened to steam a few big abalones for dinner!”

Song Wei could not help but smile. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei laughed.”Then, what do you guys think? objectively speaking, the feast 1 prepared is very suitable for the occasion, right?”

“Indeed!” Zheng Yongshou quickly agreed with Xia ruofei without any principles.

“Senior granduncle, you’re so kind … I’m very grateful!” Li Yifu also said respectfully.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue could not help but look helpless. Zheng Yongshou and Li Yifu’s support for Xia ruofei was definitely without any principles. As long as Xia ruofei said something, it was definitely right. As long as it was Xia ruofei’s order, he would definitely carry it out.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’m just joking!” Go, go, go! Let’s all drink a few more glasses tonight!”

After that, they took the elevator to the luxury suite on the top floor.

“Mr. Xia,” Zheng Yongshou said as soon as he entered the house,”these dishes may be a little cold. I’ll go heat them up. Please wait a moment!”

“Alright, thank you for your hard work!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

While waiting for Zheng Yongshou to heat up the food, Xia ruofei asked Li Yifu to sit beside him and asked him about the details of his breakthrough. At the same time, Li Yifu had just broken through to the Golden core stage. He was still not used to his current cultivation. Besides, he had a lot of questions and needed guidance for such a big breakthrough. Xia ruofei’s experience was very helpful to Li Yifu.

After a while, Zheng Yongshou had already heated up the food. Song Wei came over to invite Xia ruofei to eat.

Li Yifu still had some hidden meaning. Xia ruofei laughed and said,””I’ll be staying on the Peach Blossom Island for the time being. You can ask me any questions you have. Let’s eat first!”

“Yes! Senior granduncle!” Li Yifu said respectfully.

Everyone sat down around the table. Zheng Yongshou was busy pouring wine for everyone. Xia ruofei laughed and said,””Today’s hard dishes are really prepared at the right time! Come, come, come, everyone, let’s raise a toast to celebrate your husband’s successful breakthrough to the Golden core stage!” Everyone raised their glasses. Tang Haoran also raised his glass of fruit juice and toasted with everyone..
