Chapter 752: Chapter 506 – hidden skill and fame (1)

The waiters at the side were all stunned. When they came back to their senses, their first reaction was not to save the people, but to cover their heads and flee in all directions.

These Hornets were too terrifying. In just a few seconds, they had already stung people’s faces until they were beyond recognition.

Moreover, they were so fierce that they attacked indiscriminately. They didn’t even let go of the passer – by guests. Who knew if they would come for him after they stung the two unlucky people who were watching the show? Wouldn’t he be out of his mind if he didn’t run away now?

All of a sudden, the waiters in the corridor scattered like birds and beasts. The security guards who had heard the news only dared to watch from a distance and did not dare to get close.

Xia ruofei’s lips curled up when he saw this scene on the surveillance screen.

Xue Fei deserved to be unlucky for having such a wicked idea on Lin Qiao!

However, Xia ruofei did not want to kill the two of them. Hence, Ma Feng and the rest attacked them together. After they stung the two of them until they looked like pig heads, they immediately flew to the bathroom under the command of Xia ruofei’s spiritual power. They flew out of the bathroom’s window and found a path tree to wait on.

After the Hornets flew away, the security guards and waiters who were hiding far away carefully came over and sent two more courageous waiters to the men’s and women’s washrooms to check. After confirming that there were no more hornets, everyone gathered around.

However, no one had any experience in dealing with a bee sting, so they could only ask about the patient’s condition and wait for the 120 ambulance to arrive.

Because there were two more unlucky people, they called 120 again. If only one ambulance came, it might not be able to take four people.

The manager of the nightclub also rushed over after hearing the news. Many guests also came to watch the fun, and the corridor was in a mess.

Lin Qiao went to the bathroom further away. After solving the “emergency” problem, she quickly took out the “hangover medicine” that Xia ruofei had prepared and drank it all in one go.

The spirit Heart Flower petal solution had an extremely strong restraining effect on all negative effects, so it was naturally not a problem to sober up.

......

The reason why Lin Qiao felt dizzy to this extent wasn’t because of the alcohol. Instead, it was because of the bottle of water provided by Hu Lili.

After Lin Qiao drank the water, someone came to propose a toast to her. She casually put the water bottle on the table, and Hu Lili took the opportunity to put the sleeping drug that she had prepared in advance into the bottle.

In order to prevent Lin Qiao from falling unconscious in the private room, they didn’t use too much of the drug. They only wanted to make Lin Qiao dizzy and slow down her thinking.

This kind of reaction was very similar to being drunk.

When most people realized that they had drunk a little too much, they would go to the bathroom, hide from the alcohol, or wash their faces with cold water.

Just as Lin Qiao was about to go to the bathroom, Hu Lili occupied the bathroom in advance.

Then, he dawdled inside and refused to come out. Lin Qiao had no choice but to go to the public bathroom outside.

There were already two female hooligans in the public bathroom. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

According to the plan, they would have a conflict with Lin Qiao, then teach her a lesson in the bathroom and force her to drink more knockout powder. When the drug took effect, they would take her to the private room upstairs that had been booked in advance.

Then, it was Xue Fei’s turn. This deranged rich kid wanted to Sully Lin Qiao. What was even more ridiculous was that he had arranged for Hu Lili to record the scene. He was even planning to use the video to blackmail Lin Qiao.

Lin Qiao just didn’t want to cooperate with him to cheat during the college entrance examination, but he took revenge on her so viciously. It was obvious to what extent he would seek revenge for the smallest grievance.

After Xia ruofei analyzed the situation, he had basically guessed Xue Fei’s plan. Hence, he did not hesitate to command the Hornet to teach them a lesson.

After Lin Qiao took the Chinese medicine concocted from the spirit Heart Flower petal solution, her dizziness immediately disappeared. It could be said that the effect was immediate.

She got some water from the sink and washed her face before walking out of the bathroom.

Lin Qiao wanted to go back to her room to inform her classmates and go home first. It was already past nineo’ clock. She didn’t want her mother and Xia ruofei to worry, so she planned to go back to the forestry Bureau dormitory and tell them that she was safe.

As soon as she came to the corridor, she saw that there was a lot of noise in front of her. Many people were gathered around the door of the bathroom in front.

Lin Qiao had to pass by the bathroom to return to the private room. She soon arrived at the scene of the incident.

“Excuse me ...” Lin Qiao said softly.

She parted the crowd and prepared to continue walking back to Room 607.

Four people were lying on the floor of the corridor, wailing in pain. Yingying and the other two bullies were also moved to the corridor by the waiters.

Xue Fei and Hu Lili’s faces were swollen like pig’s heads, and their voices were hoarse. However, Lin Qiao recognized their clothes.

“Xue Fei and Hu Lili?” Lin Qiao was shocked.”What happened to you?”

“Madam, do you know these two people?” The nightclub manager asked.

“I ... I’m not sure ...” Lin Qiao looked at the two of them and said,”they look like my classmates from their clothes.”

The manager also looked at the two pig – headed faces and quickly said,””That should be right! Both of them were stung by hornet’s bees and we’ve already called the emergency number. Could you please inform their families?”

“I don’t know how to contact their family!” Lin Qiao said with embarrassment. Why don’t ... I go to the private room and talk to our class monitor!”
