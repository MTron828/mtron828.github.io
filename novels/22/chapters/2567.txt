2568 Xia ruofei’s small fortune (2)

And all of this was brought to him by the magical spirit map space.

When they passed by Feng Jing’s little terrace, Xia ruofei looked up and saw that there were already a few clothes hanging on the balcony. It seemed that Feng Jing had moved in.

However, Feng Jing must have left for the office by now. Xia ruofei did not stop and continued to walk in the direction of his villa.

After a while, Xia ruofei returned home.

When he pushed open the door to the courtyard, he keenly discovered that there was someone in his house.

However, his nerves only tensed up for a moment before they relaxed again. This was because he could already sense that the person in his house was Ling Qingxue. At this moment, Ling Qingxue was busy in the kitchen.

A warm smile appeared on Xia ruofei’s face and he couldn’t help but walk faster.

He quietly opened the door and walked into the villa. He gently leaned the suitcase against the front door cabinet and then tiptoed to the kitchen next door.

Ling Qingxue was humming a song as she fried an egg in the kitchen. She was in a good mood.

In reality, Ling Qingxue did not inherit Ling Xiaotian’s cooking skills at all. When she first met Xia ruofei, Xia ruofei had never let her cook again after he had tried her cooking once because it was too unpalatable.

Today, Ling Qingxue had come over early to prepare breakfast. Naturally, it was because she had found out last night that Xia ruofei would be returning home today. She had even specially reported it to Ling Xiaotian and asked for half a day’s leave.

Usually, the company would have a regular meeting on Monday morning. It was simply unimaginable for her to take leave at this time.

Ling Qingxue still looked a little unfamiliar when she was frying the eggs. However, she was wearing an apron and her face was filled with a sincere smile, which warmed Xia ruofei’s heart.

With his cultivation level, it would be too easy for Ling Qingxue to not notice him.

Xia ruofei went behind Ling Qingxue, but she still didn’t notice.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but gently put his arms around Ling Qingxue’s waist. At that moment, Ling Qingxue realized that there was someone behind her. Her body stiffened, but she quickly relaxed when she smelled the familiar scent on Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei gently leaned his head on Ling Qingxue’s shoulder, greedily smelling the fragrance of her hair. He said softly,””Wife, I’m back!”

Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”you’re so annoying!” You didn’t even make a sound when you walked, you scared me to death!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you’re already at refined Qi Level 4. Normal gangsters can’t beat you!” What’s there to be afraid of?”

Ling Qingxue gently leaned into Xia ruofei’s arms and chuckled.”But there’s a big hooligan who’s already at refined Qi level 9. I can’t beat him! What do we do?”

Xia ruofei blew into Ling Qingxue’s ear and said,””What else can we do? I can only give in to him!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ling Qingxue struggled out of Xia ruofei’s arms, embarrassed and annoyed. She blushed and said,””How annoying!”

At this moment, a burnt smell came from the pan, and Ling Qingxue finally came back to her senses. She turned off the fire in a hurry and said,””It’s all your fault! The eggs are all fried!”

Xia ruofei took a look and said with a smile,””It’s fine, I don’t want this egg ... Also, wife, leave this kind of rough work to me! You go rest in the living room!”

“I was going to make you breakfast ...” Ling Qingxue pouted.

Xia ruofei saw that there were already two fried eggs on his plate. The price was just a little off. He smiled and said,””How about this! I’ll eat these two eggs, and I’ll fry two more for you! Can I?”

“Alright then ...” Ling Qingxue nodded.

With that, she took off the apron and solemnly put it on Xia ruofei. She said sternly,””Comrade Xia ruofei, I’ll leave this glorious post to you!”

Xia ruofei also stood at attention and said,””Yes! Don’t worry, I’ll complete the mission!”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but burst out laughing. She blushed and kissed Xia ruofei on the cheek like a Dragonfly skimming the surface of the water. Then, she giggled and left the kitchen.

Xia ruofei touched his face and smiled.

He quickly got to work in the kitchen. First, he threw away the half – burnt fried egg, then washed the pot several times, poured in the vegetable oil again, and picked up an egg.

Xia ruofei skillfully cracked the egg on the edge of the pot and then broke the shell ...

After a short while, two fried eggs were ready. Compared to the mixture of the egg white and egg yolk that Ling Qingxue had just fried, these two fried eggs were simply a piece of art. They were almost perfectly round, with a thin layer of egg white wrapped around the entire egg yolk. Some chopped green onions were sprinkled on top of it, and just looking at it was appetizing.

Then, Xia ruofei opened the refrigerator and saw that it was full of ingredients. It was obvious that Ling Qingxue had bought them yesterday. He could not help but feel warm inside.

Xia ruofei took out some bread and baked a few pieces. Then, he heated up two glasses of milk. Soon, two exquisite breakfasts were ready.

Xia ruofei brought the breakfast to the restaurant next door and smiled.””My wife! Wash your hands and come over for breakfast!”

“They’re coming!” Ling Qingxue soon arrived at the dining room. She looked at the breakfast on the table. The two eggs she had fried looked a little out of place, as if two piles of cow dung had suddenly appeared in an exquisite garden ...

Ling Qingxue imagined this scene. Then, she thought of how Xia ruofei had to eat these two “cow dung” and couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

Naturally, Xia ruofei did not know what Ling Qingxue was thinking. He looked at Ling Qingxue in confusion and smiled.””What are you laughing at? Quickly sit down and eat! I just baked this bread, and this milk, I specially took skimmed pure milk. You can drink it without worry, you definitely won’t get fat!”

“Oh, I made these two fried eggs. Try them!” Xia ruofei said again. Then, he brought the two eggs that Ling Qingxue had fried in front of him and said,”these two are mine! I’m so happy just thinking about it!”

Ling Qingxue looked at the fried egg in front of her and then at the “cow dung” in front of Xia ruofei. She felt bad and said hesitantly,””Why don’t we ... Switch ...”

Before she could finish her sentence, Xia ruofei covered the plate in front of him and said,””No! No! His wife made it herself, and he wouldn’t exchange it for anything! Don’t even think about it!”

Although Ling Qingxue knew that Xia ruofei was exaggerating on purpose, she still felt warm in her heart. She chuckled and said,””Don’t blame me if it’s not good!”

“How can it not taste good?” Xia ruofei said,”there’s a wife’s love in this!”

“It’s too mushy! Even I can’t take it anymore ...”Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but blush.” Eat!” Eat it! I won’t snatch it from you ...”

Xia ruofei chuckled, picked up a fried egg, and took a big bite.

He had already mentally prepared himself for the worst, so when he ate it, he was a little surprised. Although the Yingying didn’t look too good, at least it was edible. It was just that the heat was too old, and the egg yolk was all solid. Also, Ling Qingxue probably didn’t know that salt was needed to fry eggs, so the taste was quite light.

However, Xia ruofei did not show it. Instead, he gobbled down the entire fried egg in big mouthfuls. Then, he gave Ling Qingxue a thumbs up and said,””My wife! The taste was very good! Your cooking skills have improved a lot!”

Ling Qingxue asked in disbelief,””Really? You’re not saying this to comfort me, are you?”

“Why Would I Lie to You?” Xia ruofei said,”it’s really delicious!”

With that, Xia ruofei immediately picked up another fried egg and finished it in no time. He did not even give Ling Qingxue a chance to try it.

Seeing Xia ruofei’s face of enjoyment, Ling Qingxue mumbled doubtfully,””Really? I don’t even have confidence in myself ...”

Then, she picked up Xia ruofei’s fried egg and took a bite. The egg yolk slowly flowed out, and a fragrant smell filled the air ...

...

Xia ruofei’s fried eggs were really delicious!

The two of them chatted casually as they ate breakfast, and the air was filled with happiness.

Haruki Murakami’s words were very appropriate for a small but accurate happiness and satisfaction.

Two people in love, preparing breakfast together, leisurely enjoying the food prepared by each other, and chatting about topics that would never end.

Sometimes, happiness was really that simple ...
