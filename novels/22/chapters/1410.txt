Chapter 1411: If you don’t leave me, I’ll definitely ..._1

According to Feng Jing’s salary comparison table, the M9 position that she was assigned to only had an annual salary of 600000 Yuan, which was almost the same as the M8 position. The only person in the M9 position was the company’s president, so it was obvious that she had set her salary low on purpose.

“It’s not low,”Feng Rao said. ” 600000 Yuan a year is definitely a high salary for a company of our size. You’ll know if you look at the companies outside ...”

Xia ruofei glanced at Feng Rao and said,””You know what I’m talking about. How can you compare it to the outside world? “Let’s make a parallel comparison. This salary level is only the standard of a senior M7 or M8 position in the company. You’re a CEO ...”

“Ruofei, my income is high enough. Besides, the majority of my income is being shared!” Feng Jing said,”a bonus of 2% a year is much higher than your salary ...”

Feng Jing held 2% of the company’s shares as a reward from Xia ruofei. According to this year’s profit, she would be able to get 6 million Yuan in dividends.

Xia ruofei glanced at Feng Rao and said,””Sister ran, do you really think I’m a rookie? You do hold 2% of the shares, but how is that the same as the profit bonus?”

To put it simply, the dividends of the other executives were the company’s rewards and were distributed among everyone. However, Feng Jing and Xia ruofei were shareholders, so they couldn’t share all the profits. If Feng Jing got six million, Xia ruofei would get more than two hundred million.

In this case, would the company still have any development funds left?

Furthermore, even if it was a full bonus, the rewards for the top managers and outstanding employees amounted to about 15 million Yuan, which was split from the profits. This 15 million Yuan would naturally be deducted from Xia ruofei and Feng Jing’s share as well. The two of them had to bear the 15 million Yuan in proportion. If that was the case, Feng Jing would not get 6 million Yuan.

In fact, at the end of the year, everyone would agree on a dividend ratio. For example, 10% of this year’s profits would be used as shareholders ‘dividends, and the rest of the funds would be used as the company’s liquid funds.

If the company was in a period of rapid development and had a greater need for funds, it was possible that there would be no dividend at all. It was even possible that not only would there be no dividend, but the shareholders would also have to increase the capital in proportion and continue to invest in the company.

Hence, Feng Jing’s 2% shares didn’t mean that she would receive 2% of the profits every year. In fact, she didn’t get much money.

Of course, her shares were still very valuable. Even if they were valued at about one billion Yuan, her assets would still reach 20 million Yuan.

In other words, she had already become a rich woman after working at paradise Corporation for more than a year.

It was just that this money couldn’t be easily cashed out. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Feng Jing smiled.”Ruofei, I’ve already taken enough. Besides, I don’t have many places to use the money. What’s the point of saving so much money?”

“I’m preparing the dowry!” Xia ruofei chuckled.”Who would complain about having too much money?”

Feng Rao couldn’t help but glare at Xia ruofei. This guy was really rubbing it in!

Who didn’t know that at the end of the year, what older single women were most afraid of was the topic of marriage, as if the whole world was forcing them to get married ...

“Don’t talk nonsense!” Feng Rao said,” 600000 Yuan is not a low salary. Moreover, you’re an M10! The salary is only a symbolic one Yuan!”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”how can that be the same?” The whole company is mine, so I can decide how much I’ll be paid, right?”

“I’m also a shareholder of the company!” Feng Rao said, unconvinced.

“Sister che, your sense of being the host is very praiseworthy.” Xia ruofei tried his best to persuade her.”But you’re doing actual work after all. Besides, once the salary standard is set, it’ll be difficult to change it in the future. You don’t care if it’s a hundred or two hundred thousand less, but others do! Could it be that his other colleagues would always have M6M7? In the future, if they perform well in their evaluations or make great contributions to the company, even if they don’t become the president, they may still get the salary of M9. Although this may be a rare case, if they can be promoted to this level, they must be excellent employees. We can’t dampen their enthusiasm!”

“This ...” Feng Jing hesitated after hearing Xia ruofei’s words.

Xia ruofei struck while the iron was hot,”it’s settled then!” M9’s annual salary will be based on the standard of 800000 to 1000000 Yuan, and you’ll enjoy the benefits of dividends. Since you have the shares, I’ll cancel the dividends for you. However, as a senior M9 member who has made great contributions to the company’s development, your salary will be based on the upper limit of M9’s salary, and it will be calculated according to the annual salary of 1000000! No objections, right, sister che?”

“Ah? 1 million! Isn’t that too much?” Feng Rao couldn’t help but feel a little speechless.

This was almost double the standard she had set before.

“Not much, not much!” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”not at all. Sister che, I can’t wait to offer a million – dollar annual salary to keep a talent like you!”

“No, I won’t leave!” Feng Rao blurted out.

She did not even think before she said that. She said it subconsciously and her face immediately turned red as if Xia ruofei had discovered her secret. She felt guilty.

However, Xia ruofei did not think of it in any other way. Instead, he laughed happily.
