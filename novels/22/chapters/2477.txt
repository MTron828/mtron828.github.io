2478 Signing the contract (1)

Xia ruofei and song Rui came to play golf for leisure. So after hitting the ball, they chatted as they walked towards the hole.

Ling Qingxue, Song Wei, and Zhuo Yiyi were also with them.

With the blue sky and white clouds that were rare in the capital above his head and the green grass beneath his feet, Xia ruofei was naturally in a very pleasant mood with three beautiful women by his side.

Song Rui, on the other hand, was not in the mood to appreciate the beautiful scenery. He was still counting how many shots he had lost after this hole ...

After a while, the group arrived at the ball hole.

Song Rui still looked around with a trace of hope and muttered to himself,””Where’s the ball?”

Xia ruofei went straight to the hole and pointed at the golf ball lying quietly in the hole. He said,””Xiao Rui, can you tell me what a hole – in – one for a four – hole is called now?”

Song Rui’s face was full of disbelief. He took a few quick steps to the ball hole.

When he saw the golf ball in the hole, he could not help but mumble,””You really didn’t cheat?”

Xia ruofei shrugged.”You were right beside me when I hit the ball. How could I cheat?”

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue looked at each other and laughed at the same time.

Song Rui didn’t understand the situation, but Song Wei and Ling Qingxue, who were also cultivators, knew what was going on.

With Xia ruofei’s cultivation at refined Qi level 9, his control of his strength had long reached the level of fine control. In addition to the help of his mental power, the golf ball he hit was like a precisely – guided missile, hitting wherever he pointed.

If Xia ruofei had not mastered the key movements of golf at the beginning, there would be some deviations when he struck the ball. However, after a few rounds of adjustment, he would still be able to hit the ball. Not to mention that song Rui’s level was only relatively good among the amateurs, even a professional golf would lose to Xia ruofei!

Song Rui could not figure it out. However, he had seen Xia ruofei hit the ball violently and then made a hole in one with his own eyes. He had to believe it.

In the end, song Rui looked bitter and said unwillingly,””The hole – in – one of the four holes is called albatross ...”

At this moment, Zhuo Yiyi came forward and teased,””Song xiaorui, where’s my Swarovski?”

During the visit to the Paradise gathering in the morning, song Rui had bragged that he would compete with Xia ruofei in golf. If he won the money, he would buy a crystal necklace for Zhuo Yiyi. He even claimed that he would split the land with the rich.

He didn’t expect that he would be smacked by the tycoon instead ...

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”Yiyi, Xiao Rui is about to go bankrupt. I don’t think the crystal necklace is going to work anymore. I won quite a lot today, so why don’t I give you one?”

“Hey! A warrior can be killed but not humiliated!” Song Rui called out from the side.

“What if I write off today’s gambling debt?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“Then you can insult me however you want!” Song Rui said without thinking.

He closed his eyes and let Xia ruofei humiliate him.

Ling Qingxue and the other two couldn’t help but laugh.

They knew that Xia ruofei and song Rui were not really gambling. Even if song Rui was not as rich as Xia ruofei, tens of thousands of Yuan was not a big sum. Song Rui was just playing around.

At this moment, an electric car drove over from afar. Zhao Yongjun jumped out and said,””Ruofei, director Zhou’s legal counsel is here. He’s asking you to sign the contract!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Brother Zhao, you can just make a phone call. Why did you have to come personally?”

Zhao Yongjun laughed.”I also wanted to come out for some fresh air. It’s so tiring to entertain people in the club!”

That was what Zhao Yongjun said, but he was actually happy to do so. On the first day of the club’s opening, the members who were not short of money were already spending all kinds of things, and the momentum was quite good.

Even the Ling’s private kitchen was extremely busy. The northern market of the Ling’s private kitchen was basically still empty. The famous ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ in the southeast was basically the first time it entered the sights of the upper – Class circle in Beijing. After everyone had tried it, they were full of praise. Therefore, even though they had just finished lunch, there were still many members who went to order ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ and prepared to pack it back. There were also people who made reservations for tonight’s dinner and were prepared to invite their friends there.

It was a good thing that Ling Qingxue had asked senior brother Wu to prepare enough ingredients in advance. Otherwise, they really wouldn’t have been able to handle it.

The steadily rising sales volume meant high profits. The Paradise Club, which mainly focused on high – end products, had a shocking price tag. Whether it was food or entertainment, the profit margin was shockingly large. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Profits were one thing, but what made Zhao Yongjun even more pleased was the connections that the Paradise Club had gathered. With their high – Quality service and Zhao Yongjun’s background, people in the upper – Class circle would definitely go after them like ducks. After a long time, it would form a virtuous cycle, and the influence of the Paradise Club would naturally rise day by day.

Everything was going according to everyone’s initial expectations. In fact, it had even exceeded everyone’s expectations.

So even though Zhao Yongjun and the others said they were tired, they were actually very happy.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”director Zhou is so efficient!” Could it be that he’s afraid that I’ll go back on my word?”

“Brother Zhou is also trying to make friends with you,” Zhao Yongjun said.”He’s very sincere. ” Regarding Zhou Yuan’s matter ... I should let him off the hook! It’s not easy for brother Zhou to have such a good – for – nothing nephew ...”
