Ruby couldn’t help but show an unnatural expression. Although Espanyol was not as miserable as Herona this season and had established their advantage of staying in the league early on, on paper, Espanyol and Herona were basically similar in strength. Xia ruofei had so casually placed Herona in the weak ranks that Ruby felt that he was not showing his face.

After Xia ruofei left the field, Espanyol used their regular main players to score three goals in forty-five minutes of the second half. It seemed that the strength gap between the two teams was quite big, but this had to be looked at separately. Without the five-goal lead in the first half, the Spanish players could not play so casually, and the players of Herona could not be distracted, which led to frequent mistakes in the rear defensive line. Under such circumstances, it was normal to concede three goals.

Ruby thought for a moment and decided not to discuss the issue of Herona. He said sincerely, ” “Mr. Xia! Thank you very much for everything you’ve done for the team! The six points from these two games are valuable to the club. Maybe after the end of the season, they will look back and find that these six points will be the key to our entry into Europe! Especially against bar?a, that was an unexpected three points!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. ” “If possible, I’d even like to play for the team in the last three rounds, but I’m really sorry. I’m very busy at home, so I’m afraid I’ll have to rely on you all for the remaining three rounds!”

Ruby quickly replied,” Mr. Xia, please rest assured!” We’ll definitely do our best to get a spot in the European tournament!”

Xia ruofei had already ” exceeded his mission “. He had originally come to play one game for the team against bar?a and was going to leave. Now, he had played one more game and helped the team win a big victory of eight to zero. Not only did they obtain three points, but they also added eight goal difference for the team, five of which were directly related to him. For the club, if they needed to calculate the small points for the end-of-season tie, these eight goal difference might play a decisive role. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei had already helped the team through the toughest game. They had successfully defeated bar?a in the away game and then made Herona cry. This was like in a game. The most difficult obstacle had been pushed through and they had also gotten rid of a small fish. If they could not deal with the remaining opponents and could not hold on to the victory in the final stage, they would be too ashamed to face the elders of Jiangdong.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. ” “I heard that sevilya is still behind. If this score is maintained until the end of the game, then we’ll be in the top seven and basically have a place in the European tournament. Then ...... In the remaining three matches, as long as we do not make any mistakes, no one will be able to snatch the fruits of victory from our hands!”

Ruby nodded excitedly and said,””Yes! Our staff has been watching the game from the front. The score is still 1 – 0 and sevilya is behind!”

Xia ruofei said,”then turn on the TV and let’s watch the game together!” I don’t want to keep thinking about this matter!”

The home team’s locker room was well – equipped. As soon as Xia ruofei finished speaking, a player ran over to turn on the TV and quickly found the channel to broadcast the game.

Everyone looked at the live broadcast and saw that sevilia was still behind by 0 – 1. The second half of the match had just begun, so Xia ruofei and Zhou leiyun decided to watch the match with everyone.

The 45 – minute game was fast, but it was still quite torturous for the Spanish players, especially now that sevilya was behind. They could not wait for time to pass and the score to not change again.

Xia ruofei and Zhou leiyun sat in the middle of the front row. Ruby sat beside Zhou leiyun. Xia ruofei called Wu Lei, who had just finished his shower, to sit beside him. The three of them watched the game and chatted in Chinese.

The strength of the sevilya team was still quite strong, especially in the situation where they were one goal behind, their offensive was even more fierce.

Throughout the second half, Sevilla’s opponent, mallorgate, was jittery and did not have any decent counterattacks. The three lines were almost pressed together, so the Spanish players were also frightened.

Fortunately, even though Mallorca looked like he would concede the ball at any moment, luck was always on their side. In the second half alone, sevilia had already shot twice at the pillar. There was also a powerful header that was about to go in, but it was cleared by the Mallorca defender on the goal line.

The feeling of losing the ball at any moment made the Spanish players extremely nervous. They were even more nervous than Mallorca’s fans, and even more nervous than when they were playing.

As time passed, Mallorca miraculously managed to keep the goal from falling despite the wind and rain.

The Spanish players felt like every second was like a year. The game finally entered the injury stoppage time. The fourth official raised the sign. When everyone saw that the stoppage time was actually five minutes long, they could not help but curse.

Although the Spanish players knew that it was useless to curse in front of the television, they still subconsciously cursed. The broadcast camera also showed that Mallorca’s manager was very dissatisfied with the stoppage time and kept looking for the fourth official to protest.
