Translator: 5496903“It looks pretty cool!” Song Wei grinned.

“I tell you, this airboat is really fast!” Ling Qingxue said,”can you guess how long it took us to fly here from the three mountains?”

“Less than an hour?” Song Wei asked.

“Almost! To be precise, it’s only about half an hour. How about it? It’s fast, right?” Ling Qingxue said.

She then raised her eyebrows and asked,””Eh? Wei Wei, how did you guess? How did you guess the time?”

“Because RUO Fei called me and told me that we’ll meet on the rooftop of this library in an hour!” Song Wei said with a smile. I didn’t hear your voice, so he must have called me before he picked you up! You set off from the three mountains after he picked you up, and now you’re here on time. The flight time is naturally less than an hour!”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. He pointed at Ling Qingxue and said,””Qingxue, you seem to have become a little stupid! You’re asking such a simple question ...”

Ling Qingxue was embarrassed and embarrassed. She grabbed the soft flesh around Xia ruofei’s waist and said through gritted teeth,””I’ll let you laugh at me!”

Xia ruofei shouted exaggeratedly,”no, no, no!” I’m most afraid of this move! I admit defeat!”

Ling Qingxue saw Xia ruofei exaggeratedly begging for mercy. Although she knew that he was just pretending, she still let go of his hand with a smug look. Then, she glanced at Xia ruofei and said,””Let’s see if you still dare to make fun of me in the future!”

Xia ruofei sighed and said,””Qingxue, I’m just concerned about you! It’s said that a woman is stupid for three years after getting pregnant. You’re not even pregnant yet, and you’re already like this. What are you going to do if you get pregnant in the future? It’s really worrying ...”

Ling Qingxue’s face turned red instantly. She bared her fangs and brandished her claws as she pounced on Xia ruofei, shouting,””I’m going to kill you ...”

Xia ruofei was already prepared. He nimbly dodged into the cabin and shouted,””Stop, stop, stop! Qingxue, I’m just joking ... I won’t do it again!”

“I have to teach you a good lesson!” Ling Qingxue pouted.

“Don ‘t!” Xia ruofei used the control panel to avoid Ling Qingxue and said,”we still have to hurry! I was wrong, alright? Don’t delay the important matters!”

Ling Qingxue was also afraid of damaging the control panel, so she didn’t dare to charge at full speed.

Song Wei watched for a while before she smiled and said,”Forget it! Qingxue, RUO Fei has always been talkative, please spare him!”

Ling Qingxue just needed a way out. She immediately pouted and said,””Hmph! For Weiwei’s sake, I’ll let you off today! But I’ll record it down in my little notebook. The next time you offend me, we’ll settle old and new scores together!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Okay, okay, okay!” I promise I won’t do it again!”

As he spoke, he winked at Song Wei. Song Wei could not help but burst out laughing.

“By the way, Weiwei, is it okay for you to leave for a day or two?” Xia ruofei asked.

“I’ve already asked my classmates to apply for two days off after I got your call!”Song Wei nodded.

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said,”then I’m relieved! Let’s go!”

With that, Xia ruofei maneuvered the flying boat and started to ascend and accelerate.

“Ruofei, are we going to Australia?” Ling Qingxue asked curiously.

“Yeah!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I’m going to pick up my disciple, Tang Haoran!”

“Ruofei, you called all of us here. Is there something you need?” Song Wei asked from the side.

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but roll her eyes at Xia ruofei.””Weiwei, don’t mention it. I’ve been asking all the way, but this guy is tight – lipped and keeps us guessing!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”of course it’s a good thing to call you!” I’ll give you a surprise!”

“You’ve said it 800 times. What surprise is it?” Ling Qingxue asked in a bad mood.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I already said it’s a surprise. If I told you in advance, what surprise would there be?” Anyway, the answer will be revealed soon, so why the rush?”

Ling Qingxue looked at Song Wei and said,””I told you! This guy only knew how to keep people guessing! He’s tight – lipped!”

“Since ruofei feels that it’s not the right time yet, then let’s just wait!” Song Wei covered her mouth and laughed.

“That’s the way!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Qingxue, bring Weiwei to the deck to look at the scenery! We’ll be flying across the ocean in a while, and the scenery on the ocean is very beautiful! This time, we’ll fly a little lower, and I guarantee you’ll be able to enjoy the endless beautiful scenery!”

Xia ruofei had flown so high to avoid the plane’s normal cruising altitude.

Although the formation on the airboat could also avoid the risk of collision in advance, Xia ruofei still preferred to fly in a straight line. Therefore, he simply let the airboat fly higher than all the commercial aircraft. At this height, there were basically no other aircraft flying except for some fighter aircraft.

The next trip to Australia was across the Pacific Ocean.

It was actually quite boring to fly above the clouds, and there was basically no scenery to see.

Hence, Xia ruofei decided to fly at a low altitude this time. He would fly at an altitude of about 100 meters above the sea and avoid the route of commercial aircraft. The cruising altitude of the engine could not be so low.

After all, it was the vast ocean below. As they passed by an Island which had an airport, there happened to be a plane taking off from the airport and colliding with the airboat, the probability was so low that it could be ignored.

Ling Qingxue’s eyes brightened. She held Song Wei’s hand and said,””Wei Wei, let’s go to the deck to enjoy the scenery! By the way, RUO Fei, fly over the Forbidden City twice like you did just now! I’m sure Weiwei has never seen it from this angle before!”

Xia ruofei shrugged.”You said it’s too late. We’re already in Ji Province. How about I turn around and fly back?”

Song Wei was stunned. She was in the capital University Library when she got on the airboat! We’ve only been talking for a while, and we’re already in Ji Province? The speed of this airboat was really terrifying ...

“No need!” After Song Wei regained her senses, she quickly said,”ruofei, let’s hurry on with our journey! Anyway, with this airboat, we’ll have plenty of opportunities to see the Forbidden City from the sky in the future!”

“That’s true, then let’s hurry!” Ling Qingxue said,”ruofei, why don’t we go out to sea first? Don’t fly above the land!”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Then, he steered the flying boat to the East, preparing to fly over the sea before turning to fly to Australia.

The deck of the airboat was indeed the best spot for viewing the scenery. Song Wei was soon fascinated by the special viewing angle. The airboat was flying at a very low altitude this time, so the beautiful scenery along the way could be said to be unobstructed. Very soon, the Flying Ship was in the sky above the sea, flying over the boundless blue sea. The scene of the sea and the sky being one color made one feel very carefree and relaxed.

For the two – hour voyage, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue stayed on the deck.

Although they were tired of the sea view, the two seemed to have a lot to talk about as they sat on the deck and chatted all the way.

At around 11:30 am in China, Xia ruofei and the others arrived in Australia in the black airboat. The deck of the airboat was indeed the best spot for viewing the scenery.
