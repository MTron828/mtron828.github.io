Xia ruofei only smiled at Gore’s unprincipled flattery and said,””Mr. Gore is an expert in this area. Please give us your valuable advice.”

“I’m very happy to help!” Gore said with a smile.

He also knew that even if this young man was a high – Level executive in corner restaurant, he had to try his best to win him over. He would naturally do his best to help him.

Thank you in advance, Mr. Gore.” Xia ruofei said.

Then, he placed the thermal container on the operating table and said,””There are nine types of foie gras in here. Please identify them one by one, Mr. Gore.”

“Alright, alright!” As Gore spoke, he opened the thermal container.

This kind of charged insulation box could work for more than ten hours continuously and the temperature inside the box was maintained at 0 degrees. In this environment, the quality of foie gras could be preserved for about 24 hours.

Gore took out all nine vacuum – packed bags and arranged them in a row on the console according to their numbers.

When Gore saw the foie gras samples through the transparent vacuum packaging, he raised his eyebrows slightly, but he didn’t say anything. Instead, he put on gloves, took out nine plates, opened the foie gras samples, and put them on the plates.

“Wow ...” Gore finally couldn’t help but exclaim,”it looks really good!!”

The foie gras had a very beautiful light pink color and the texture was very delicate.

“If I’m not mistaken, this should be Strasburg foie gras,” Gore said with a smile. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Awesome!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Mr. Gore is indeed an expert!”

“Thank you for your compliment,” Gore said with a smile.”But this isn’t a great ability. I’ve come into contact with too many foie gras. The color of Strasburg foie gras is very special, so I can recognize it at a glance. Of course, Toulouse foie gras is also special, but it is usually ivory white in color. ”

“These foie gras are indeed from Strasburg goose. This is a young goose that I specially imported from Austria” Xia ruofei said,”we are trying a new way to breed them, so we are doing some control experiments.”

“Understood!” Gore said.

Next, Gore began to further identify the foie gras. He cut a small piece with a beautiful table knife and carefully observed each section of the foie gras sample. He even put the slices into an instrument for testing and recorded some data.

After more than an hour, Gore finally finished the initial work.

He took off his gloves, picked up a form and said to Xia ruofei,””Mr. Xia, there is no doubt that the quality of these foie gras is very high. At least, they have reached the admission standard of high – end Western restaurants. I have carried out a further analysis. The data shows that the highest quality sample should be sample No. 8. Its fat content has reached an astonishing 68%, which has exceeded the average level by a large margin!”

Bastian saw that Xia ruofei was confused and explained with a smile,””Mr. Xia, generally speaking, the higher the fat content in the foie gras, the better the taste and the higher the nutrition!”

“I see!” Xia ruofei nodded and then asked doubtfully,”it’s not good for the body if the fat content is so high, right? Don’t we all encourage low – Fat diet nowadays?”

“It’s two different concepts,”Bastian said with a smile. Generally speaking, the so – called high – Fat food referred to saturated fatty acid. This component would increase the body’s cholesterol content, which was not good for health. However, in fact, in the fat of goose liver, about 65% to 68% of it was saturated with fatty acid, which could lower the cholesterol level in the blood and soften the blood vessels. Therefore, an appropriate amount of food was actually more beneficial to health. Of course, in the end, foie gras is still a high cholesterol food. Overeating it is not good for the body. ”

Xia ruofei understood after Bastian’s explanation. He smiled and said,”I understand now! There’s an old Chinese saying that too much is as bad as not enough. No matter how good the food is, you can’t eat it without restraint!”

“Yes! Yes, I am!” Bastian said.

At this moment, Gore shook his head and said,””No, no, no! Mr. Xia, Mr. Bastian, this theory is applicable to ordinary foie gras, but sample No. 8 is different. According to the data I just tested, the proportion of the fatty acid in the fat of this foie gras sample is as high as 88%! It only has a very small amount of saturated fatty acid, so it’s really a healthy food!”

“God!” Bastian couldn’t help but take a deep breath and asked,”Gore, is there a problem with our equipment?”

“My Dear Boss,” Gore said with a smile,”I also suspected the existence of such a possibility at first! In fact, the data of these nine samples were very beautiful. The worst one had a fat content of 58%, which was already a high standard for foie gras. Moreover, among the fat in these goose liver samples, the lowest amount of saturated fatty acid is about 66%, which is also much higher than the average level. ”

At this point, Gore paused for a moment, then smiled and said,””So, I took a sample of foie gras from our store. It was ordered by Mr. Li. It was just air – flown from France last night. The test data is here ...”
