Chapter 1544: Cutting the stone on the spot (1)

Translator: 549690339

When Xia ruofei arrived at the public Jade bid again, it was already past nineo’ clock at night.

However, the place was brightly lit, and the atmosphere was very lively. There were many people gathered at the stone cutting site that was one wall away from the public square. The roar of the cutting machine never stopped, and there were cries of alarm from time to time.

“Mr. Xia!” Yu mingdong waved at Xia ruofei from afar.

His face was full of smiles, and he seemed to be in a good mood.

“President Yu, it seems like you’ve gained a lot!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“My luck is pretty good!” Yu mingdong said happily,”it’s all thanks to old he. He suggested that I raise the bidding price for several raw stones at the last minute. Otherwise, it’s really hard to say what the result would be ...”

At the side, He Ping smiled reservedly, but he was also very proud in his heart.

Xia ruofei didn’t think much of it. He didn’t know the standard of this stone gambling consultant, but he knew that Yu mingdong spent more than 20 million to buy that raw stone. He was most likely going to lose money.

Yu mingdong asked again,”Mr. Xia, don’t you still have a raw stone here?” Why don’t we just open them together today!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sure!” It’s good that you experts are here. When the time comes, we’ll need President Yu and elder he’s advice!”

“Mr. Xia also hit the bullseye?” He Ping asked, somewhat surprised.

Yu mingdong smiled and said,”Mr. Xia, you’re really generous this time!” I won a total of eight pieces!”

He Ping was even more surprised. He couldn’t help but take another look at Xia ruofei. However, when he heard Yu mingdong say that seven of the raw stones had only cost him a total of three million, he immediately lost interest.

Yu mingdong felt that there was no possibility of Xia ruofei’s seven raw stones increasing in price. However, that No. 1896 stone should be pretty good, so he smiled and said,””Old he, other than the seven Stones, Mr. Xia also won a good raw stone, No. 1896. You should remember it, right?”

He Ping could not help but raise his eyebrows and ask,””Number 1896? What’s the final price?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”I invested 8.6 million. I didn’t expect to win the bid!”

He Ping couldn’t help but take another look at Xia ruofei, and then said indifferently,””It’s too expensive ...”

Yu mingdong couldn’t help but feel a little embarrassed. He didn’t expect He Ping to speak so bluntly, which made him feel a little embarrassed.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””It’s only a few million. It doesn’t matter even if I lose money. I felt that the raw stone was very suitable for me the first time I saw it!”

“Yes, yes, yes! It’s hard to buy a good heart with money!” Yu mingdong quickly echoed.

He Ping also thought that Xia ruofei was one of those silly rich second generation kids. However, since Xia ruofei and Ma Zhiming were good friends, he didn’t make any more sarcastic remarks. He just smiled lightly and didn’t say much.

“Mr. Xia,” Yu mingdong said,”then you go and take out the raw stone. Let’s go and cut the stone together!”

“Alright, please wait a moment!” Xia ruofei said readily.

He went to the public auction site, found an empty Service Desk, and showed the deposit order. Soon, a staff member sent the raw stone over with a small forklift.

When they heard that Xia ruofei was going to cut the stone next door, the staff of the public bid said that they could help Xia ruofei send the raw stone over.

Hence, Xia ruofei followed the forklift and left the public square empty – handed.

The public Jade bid provided free stone cutting equipment, so many people would choose to cut the stones on the spot after winning the bid. If a few raw stones rose in price, it would also be a good publicity for the public Jade bid.

Yu mingdong brought Xia ruofei to the next room. The raw stones that he had bought were already stacked together. There were seven or eight pieces. The biggest one was raw stone No. 633, which he had spent more than 20 million on.

Shi Lei was guarding the raw stones with all his heart. When he saw Xia ruofei and the others, he quickly walked up to them and helped the staff unload Xia ruofei’s raw stone.

“Mr. Xia, why don’t you ... Open your raw stone first?” Yu mingdong asked with a smile.

Xia ruofei looked at Yu mingdong’s pile of raw gemstones. The largest one, raw gemstones No. 633, was naturally the most eye – catching. He pondered for a while and said with a smile,”let’s go first, President Yu!” I also want to gain some experience ...”

“Alright!” Yu mingdong said readily. Then I won’t be polite!”

He was also somewhat eager to open up his own raw stones. After all, the factory was still waiting for his harvest from the public bid!

Yu mingdong looked at He Ping and said politely,””Old he, I’ll have to trouble you then ...”

He Ping nodded slightly, signaling Shi Lei to move one of the raw gemstones out.

Xia ruofei had been paying attention to the situation over here. He smiled to himself when he saw this. It was just as he had guessed. He Ping had chosen a smaller raw stone.

As the most expensive piece, number 633 should have been reserved for the last.

He Ping took out a strong flashlight and carefully examined the condition of the raw stone. Then, he took out a pen and began to draw lines on the surface of the stone.

It was human nature to watch the fun, not to mention such an exciting stone cutting, so many people saw that the stone was ready to be cut and also came over.

Very quickly, He Ping drew the line. He let Shi Lei and the stone cutter master who was waiting at the side move the raw stone to the cutting machine.

“Let’s cut it according to this line. ” He Ping pointed at the raw stone and said,”if there’s no green, start wiping from the incision ...”
