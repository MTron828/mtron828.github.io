However, when everyone passed through the courtyard and arrived at the door, Xia ruofei, who was neatly dressed, opened the door and walked out with a smile.

“Welcome, teachers from xiangnan TV!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Xia ruofei’s appearance made Liu Yan and the others ‘eyes light up. Even Qin Yanan and he Yu’s eyes were slightly stunned. Today, Xia ruofei was wearing a set of handmade casual clothes from Ferragamo. He had a dark blue plaid long jacket on the top and a denim shirt on the inside. He matched it with loose gray breeches and a pair of yellow Martin Boots.

Ferragamo’s custom – made clothes were cut very exquisitely, and the materials used were of the highest quality. At the same time, they did not have a very conspicuous LOGO. Unless one was very familiar with the brand and could recognize it at a glance, it would feel like ordinary casual clothes, but overall, it gave people a feeling of quite a high class.

To put it simply, it was low – Key luxury.

This set of clothes was specially commissioned by Ling Qingxue’s friend in Hong Kong to get a designer from Ferragamo to tailor – make for Xia ruofei. There were several sets of clothes at once, both formal and casual.

This time, Xia ruofei considered that he was going for an outdoor leisure activity and it would not be right to dress too formally. Besides, in the show, the guests often had to do some work within their ability, such as chopping firewood, starting a fire, picking vegetables, and so on. This set of casual clothes happened to be loose, so Xia ruofei chose this set without much consideration.

It was also Qin Yanan’s first time seeing her boss wearing clothes of this style. The moment they saw Xia ruofei, all the girls, including her, could not help but feel their hearts beat faster. This set of clothes almost perfectly complemented Xia ruofei’s calm and composed temperament.

Xia ruofei’s body was well – built but did not give off the feeling of a muscular man. It was the kind that was well – proportioned and often had a gentle smile on his face. He gave off the image of a gentle and modest gentleman. The style of this dress was casual with a hint of casualness, which suited Xia ruofei’s temperament very well. At the same time, the Martin Boots and the denim shirt brought a slight contrast, making Xia ruofei have a unique masculine charm.

Liuyan was also stunned for a moment, then she quickly stepped forward and said,””Hello, President Xia! Sorry for disturbing you ...”

Before they came, Gao Jun had repeatedly reminded Liu Yan, who was leading the team, to give Xia ruofei the greatest respect.

As the director of the entertainment channel all these years, Liu Yan had seen countless big stars. But this was the first time the station head had come to the filming location personally and had even repeatedly reminded her, so how could Liu Yan dare to slight him?

“I’m not disturbing you, not disturbing you. ” Xia ruofei smiled.”Everyone, come in and take a seat!”

Several cameras were filming Xia ruofei from different angles, but he was not affected at all. He acted very naturally, which made Liu Yan feel a little relieved.

The group of people followed Xia ruofei into the house and sat down in the living room. Qin Yanan came up to Xia ruofei and introduced Liu Yan and the others.

“Mr. Liu, how should I cooperate with you for the next shoot?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“President Xia, I’m not a teacher!” Liu Yan quickly said. You can just call me little Liu!”

Xia ruofei looked at Liu Yan and estimated that she should be older than him. He smiled and said,””That’s not appropriate. How about I call you scenarist Liu?”

“Yes! I can!” Liu Yan quickly said.

She continued,”President Xia, just do your best. Wash up and eat. If you have anything to say to the audience, just say it to the camera.” After you have your breakfast, we have a segment where you can call the mushroom house to order. After recording, we’ll take a short break and then head to the mushroom house. ”

Qin Yanan had already told Xia ruofei about this yesterday, and Xia ruofei had a plan in mind.

For example, during the phone call segment, only he Jiong knew Xia ruofei’s identity in advance. After all, as the main star, Youyou had to do some preparation work in advance, while the other three did not know who the guests for this episode were. So, during the order ordering segment, one of the other three permanent guests had to answer the phone. What Xia ruofei had to do was to make sure that they did not guess his identity. He could change his voice, accent, and other means to confuse the public.

To put it bluntly, it was for entertainment.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Alright, I understand.”

After that, Liu Yan and the others left the house, leaving behind the cameraman and necessary staff. Another group of cameramen went to the backyard in advance to set up cameras.

Xia ruofei sat in the house for a while before he got up and went to the backyard for breakfast.

The cameraman followed them all the way and Xia ruofei was very natural.

In the dining room in the backyard, Xia ruofei introduced his breakfast to the camera with great interest, showing that he enjoyed the delicious breakfast in the capital city. At the same time, he complained about the weird taste of the soybean milk.

Liu Yan, who was standing at the side, was very happy. She thought that Xia ruofei’s performance did not seem like an amateur at all. Instead, he seemed like an experienced artiste who knew where to put on the show.

At least until now, the quality of the material was very high, and a lot of content could be edited out.

This included the contrast between the luxurious courtyard house that Xia ruofei lived in and the simple breakfast of soy milk, eggs, and deep – fried dough sticks. This also included his complaints about soy milk and so on.

After breakfast, Xia ruofei returned to his room and leaned back on the sofa. He took out his phone and dialed the fixed phone number provided by the festival Group.

……

In Xiaotang town, in the mushroom house of the peach blossom gathering, the recording of the show was also going on simultaneously.

The two main stars, He Jiong and Huang Lei, had already arrived at the mushroom hut earlier with the two popular young students, Peng Chang and Zhang Xing.

After they put down their luggage, they began to explore this new residence. Naturally, there were all kinds of exaggerated cheers and praises.

The environment of this season’s mushroom house could be said to be far better than the previous two seasons. Furthermore, there was a beautiful Little Lake in front of them, which gave them an invincible view.

In addition, everyone in the festival Group, including the four permanent guests, found this place to be very comfortable. It was as if there was a different smell in the air, which made them feel refreshed.

For urban people who had been in a state of sub – Health for a long time, coming here was simply a boost to their spirits, so everyone’s working condition was quite good.

After familiarizing themselves with the terrain, the two “parents,” He Jiong and Huang Lei, began to assign tasks to everyone.

Huang Lei, the well – deserved chef of the show, first asked Zhang Xing, who had just joined this season, to clean up everyone’s rooms, while Peng Chang was arranged to chop firewood in the yard.

After that, Huang Lei invited He Jiong to the long shed on the side of the courtyard near the lake to sit down and drink tea together. In Huang Lei’s words, this was called stealing a half-day’s leisure. Once the guests started to go on the show like a horse lantern, it would be difficult for the two of them to have such leisure time.

Although this was a reality show that focused on the slow life of the countryside, He Jiong and Huang Lei, who were the permanent guests, could be said to be both parents in the show. Especially Huang Lei, who took on most of the kitchen work, it was very hard for the entire season of the show. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Many fixed cameras had been arranged in the mushroom house to film the guests ‘every move from various angles.

There were also two cameras in the pergola.

He Jiong sat down on the bamboo chair beside Huang Lei and sighed comfortably. He then said,”Huang Laoshi, how about we make some tea?”

“Sure!” Huang Lei laughed. I know we’re in for a treat this season!”

He Jiong blinked his big eyes and chuckled, “That’s a must! This is because our quality of life has significantly improved this season. Everyone, look ... Clang clang clang!”

As he spoke, he picked up the beautiful tea can on the coffee table and showed it to the camera. Then he said in an exaggerated tone,””Dear audience and friends, do you see this? This season, our director team has actually prepared the precious Dahongpao from paradise for us!”
