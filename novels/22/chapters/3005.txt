3006 Arriving at the star Seizer sect (1)

Luo Qingfeng stood up and bowed slightly to Chen Xuan.””Many thanks, fellow Daoist Chen! I’ve benefited a lot from this cup of wild tea!”

“There’s no need to be so polite, sect master Luo,” Chen Xuan said with a smile.”This wild tea is only effective the first time you drink it. Many fellow Daoists in the cultivation world have drunk it before ...”

“It would be great if we could expand the planting of this tea ...” Luo Qingfeng said.

Chen Xuan and Mu Sheng laughed as they heard this. Mu Sheng said,””Sect leader Luo and little brother Xia are really worthy of being brothers! Their thoughts were the same! Just now, little brother Xia asked fellow Daoist Chen for the branches of the wild tea, and fellow Daoist Chen has agreed!”

“Actually, we’ve been sending out some wild tea branches every year to other fellow Daoists who need it,” Chen Xuan said with a smile.”It’s just that so far, no one has been able to successfully reproduce wild tea. Since brother Xia wants to try, the first heaven society won’t be stingy. It’s just a few branches!”

Luo Qingfeng could not help but look at Xia ruofei.

He had blind faith in Xia ruofei. He felt that since Xia ruofei asked for the branch, he must have a way to breed the wild tea successfully!

Qingfeng Luo thought that if the wild tea trees could be reproduced and there was a fixed amount of wild tea produced every year, it would be hard to estimate the effect it would have on the overall strength of the entire sect.

If there was enough wild tea, it was basically equivalent to all the Qi condensation cultivators in the sect being able to directly raise their cultivation by one level.

Xia ruofei smiled.”I still have to thank you, brother Chen. If I’m really lucky enough to reproduce a wild tea tree, I’ll definitely treat you to a drink!”

“Hahaha!” Chen Xuan chuckled.”I’ll be waiting for your good news then, brother Xia!”

Putting aside the effect of promoting cultivation, the taste of wild tea itself was also quite good.

Everyone sipped their tea and chatted, and time passed very quickly.

Before he knew it, the jadewater flying boat had already approached the territory of the star Seizer sect.

The disciple of the first heaven society who was controlling the flying boat turned around and said,””Young sect master, the star Seizer sect is not far ahead!”

“Alright.” Chen Xuan nodded and said,”land the airboat outside the star Seizer sect!” Be careful to find a quiet place and don’t disturb the ordinary people. ”

“Yes! Young sect leader!” The disciple controlling the flying boat said.

Actually, Chen Xuan was doing this for Xia ruofei’s sake. If they were all golden core cultivators, the flying boat would not need to land on the ground. They could just fly away from the flying boat.

However, Chen Xuan had mistakenly thought that Xia ruofei was only in the Qi refining stage. If the Clearwater flying boat was allowed to hover in the air, Xia ruofei would definitely be carried by an Aurous core stage cultivator when they left. This would more or less hurt his self – esteem.

Chen Xuan’s way of dealing with people was indeed reflected in all the details.

“Young master Chen,” Luo Qingfeng said.”Why don’t we go to the sect together?” Although our star Seizer sect doesn’t have top – grade tea leaves like wild tea to serve our guests, we do have a few pots of good wine. ”

Chen Xuan smiled warmly and said,””Thank you for your kind invitation, sect leader Luo, but I do have something urgent that I need to return to the first heaven society immediately. This time, I’m just sending little brother Xia off. Next time, if there’s a chance, I’ll definitely pay you a visit!”

In fact, everyone knew that although most of the forces would be intimidated by the first heaven society and Chen Nanfeng’s reputation and wouldn’t dare to make any small moves, they could completely rule out the possibility of others taking risks for the sake of profit. Therefore, Chen Xuan wouldn’t be loitering around outside for no reason. He would definitely return to the sect as soon as possible.

“Alright then!” Luo Qingfeng said,”the next time you come, I’ll definitely welcome you with open arms!”

Qingfeng Luo had drunk the wild tea of the first heaven society. Although it was due to Xia ruofei, in a sense, he had also owed the first heaven society a favor. Therefore, his attitude towards Chen Xuan was much better than before.

“Definitely!” Chen Xuan said with a smile.

While they were talking, the blue water Ark had landed in a Valley near the star Seizer sect. The ark trembled slightly, and the disciple of the first heaven society who was controlling the ark turned around and said,””Young sect leader, the airboat has landed! Seniors, you can disembark now!”

Chen Xuan nodded slightly, then personally sent Xia ruofei, Mu Sheng, and the rest off the flying boat. He also jumped down.

“Brother Xia,” Chen Xuan said to Xia ruofei,”when you’re done here, please come to the first heaven society to find me!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””No problem!”

“Don’t forget that we still owe you 110000 spiritual stones!”Chen Xuan chuckled. If you take too long, you can’t rule out the possibility that we’ll renege on our debt!”

Everyone burst into laughter upon hearing this.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”money is just a worldly possession. If brother Chen likes spiritual stones, you can keep them for your own use. I don’t mind.”

“Brother Xia is magnanimous!” Chen Xuan laughed. However, the first heaven society wasn’t one to go back on their word. Your brother was only joking!”

After that, Chen Xuan turned to Luo Qingfeng and Mu Sheng and said,””Sect leader mu, sect leader Luo, I’ll take my leave first!”

After saying that, Chen Xuan cupped his hands to everyone and leaped back into the flying boat.

Everyone watched the blue water flying boat fly away, and then Mu Sheng laughed and said,””Sect leader Luo, are we going back on our flying swords or ...?”

Luo Qingfeng looked at Xia ruofei and made a judgment in his heart. He then said,””Why don’t we walk up the mountain? We’re not far from the mountain Gate, and the scenery along the way is pretty good!”

Actually, what kind of scenery was there to see at night? Even if cultivators had better eyesight than ordinary people, they would not go to the mountains to see the scenery in the dark night for no reason.

Mu Sheng was well aware of Lao AI’s intention, or perhaps he thought he was well aware of it. He smiled and said,””Alright! Fei ‘er is so heavy, I’ll die of exhaustion if I carry him on the sword ...”

Mu Jianfei turned his face away with a bitter smile. Sect leader Luo is obviously concerned about fellow Daoist Xia’s feelings, so why are you talking about me? Is there any justice in this world?

However, on second thought, he and Xia ruofei were the only Qi refinement cultivators in the group. Jian Jia must have thought that Xia ruofei’s identity was a little special. It seemed that he was the only one who could be used as an excuse. There was no other choice!

The group of people then began to walk towards the main gate of the star Seizer sect.

In fact, this area was not completely deserted. The stone path leading to the mountain was still easy to walk on. Although no one would come at night, there were still some villagers who went to chop wood or collect herbs during the day.

Of course, the star Seizer sect was hidden in the depths of the mountains and was concealed by the sect’s protective formation. It was impossible for ordinary people to discover it, and they wouldn’t even have the chance to enter by mistake.

If someone really fell into the formation, they would only keep going in circles, and in the end, they might even faint from inhaling the fog.

Then, the star Seizer sect disciples responsible for maintaining the formation would send the unconscious villagers to the foot of the mountain and leave after they woke up.

From the perspective of these Hill – folk, it was natural that they had fallen into a “ghostly labyrinth”. Furthermore, after waking up, they had actually appeared at the foot of the mountain. This was the origin of some supernatural legends in this area.

After all, there would be one or two cases every year where ordinary people mistakenly entered the sect’s protective formation.

Luo Qingfeng led everyone on the mountain road with ease. This group of people were all cultivators. Mu Jianfei, who had the worst cultivation and was injured, could walk on such terrain as if it was flat ground, so his speed was also very fast.

After a while, Luo Qingfeng led everyone to a cliff.

He made a few hand seals and a spot on the cliff where vines were growing slowly became transparent, revealing a passage that was as tall as two people.

The star Seizer sect’s disciple who was guarding the gate appeared at the entrance of the passage in a flash. When he saw that the leader was Luo Qingfeng, he quickly bowed and said,””Sect leader!”

Luo Qingfeng nodded lightly and ordered,””Be careful and stay alert.”

...

“Yes! Sect leader!” The star Seizer sect disciple assented.

“Sect leader mu, please come in!” Luo Qingfeng greeted him with a smile. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

It was also Xia ruofei’s first time at the star Seizer sect. He followed Luo Qingfeng into the passageway and looked around curiously.

The tunnel was not very long, only about 20 meters or so. After passing through the tunnel, Xia ruofei saw a Valley with many ancient – looking buildings built according to the terrain. It was a spectacular sight.
