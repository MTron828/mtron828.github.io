Xia ruofeis eyes widened and he asked,good thing? Could it be that one of you is pregnant? It cant be Ive been in seclusion for almost half a year. If youre pregnant, you should be

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue both blushed. Ling Qingxue snorted and said,What nonsense are you saying? Youre the one whos pregnant!

Xia ruofei shrugged innocently and said,I also want to! But We dont have such a function!

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue couldnt help but burst out laughing.bender

Song Wei looked at Ling Qingxue and said,Qingxue, dont keep us in suspense! RUO Fei is definitely teasing you! His cultivation is so high, how could he not see it?

Only then did Ling Qingxue come back to her senses. She couldnt help but punch Xia ruofei and said,Hey! How can you be so bad! We were the first to share the good news with you, and you actually played me for a fool!

Xia ruofei laughed and reached out to grab Ling Qingxues fist. He gently pulled her into his arms and directly hugged her.

He smiled and said,Wei Wei, Qingxue, congratulations! He had finally broken through to the Golden core stage! Its not easy to take this step!

With that, Xia ruofei wrapped his arm around Ling Qingxues waist and walked to Song Wei. He pulled her into his arms as well. They were both close friends and he could not be biased. Xia ruofei walked out of the room and saw Song Wei and Ling Qingxue standing at the door.

He glanced at his two confidants, and his pupils suddenly shrank slightly. Then, an undetectable trace of joy flashed in his eyes.

However, Xia ruofei did not react. He pretended to be nervous and asked,What happened? Why did you suddenly knock on the door?

Ling Qingxue giggled and said,we didnt hesitate to interrupt your cultivation to call you out. Of course, its something important! Why dont you guess!

Xia ruofei pretended to be confused and said,Dont tell me someone ate a bears heart and a leopards gall to attack the Peach Blossom Island?

Then, he immediately denied himself,Impossible! That was impossible! If someone were to break in, how could you all still be so calm?

Seeing Xia ruofeis confused look, Ling Qingxue was even more amused. She giggled and said,Of course not! Keep guessing! Its a good thing!
