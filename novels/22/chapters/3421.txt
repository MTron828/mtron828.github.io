Chapter 3422: Tower of Trials “7th floor -2

Translator: 549690339

Ever since he got lucky and drew Ling Qingxue, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue had never been separated. When they entered the training space one level higher, the two of them would still be together.

However, Xia ruofei was still a little worried, so every time they entered the light curtain Door, he would hold Ling Qingxue’s hand tightly.

The two of them steadied their minds and quickly looked around, hoping to familiarize themselves with the environment as soon as possible.

There was no day and night in the trial Pagoda. There was always a gentle light shining on the ground, so Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue could easily see the situation around them.

They found themselves standing on a flat piece of land.

To be precise, it should be a huge square, because the ground here was paved with huge pieces of bluestone. These bluestone were cut very smoothly, and the entire square was paved with exactly the same bluestone.

The two of them were quickly attracted by a building in front of them. It was the only building in the square that they couldn’t see the end of, and it was difficult for them to ignore it.

It was a towering Castle, or perhaps it would be more accurate to call it a Palace.

The palace was also built with the same material, bluestone, and it gave off an ancient and simple feeling. It was at least a hundred meters tall.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue looked at each other. Neither of them said anything and walked straight towards the palace.

It was obvious that the trial Pagoda’s 7th level mission had something to do with this Palace.

As expected, a mission notification popped up in Xia ruofei’s perceptual mirror. [Tower of Trials seventh level mission: pass the test of the heavenly cloud Palace. After the mission is completed, you will receive the corresponding reward according to the completion rate of the mission. If the completion rate is lower than 60%, the mission will be considered a failure.]

Xia ruofei had already noticed that there was indeed a huge plaque hanging above the palace’s Gate that was tens of meters high. On it were the words “cloud Palace” written in traditional Chinese.

These three words were written with silver hooks and iron strokes, vast and powerful, and faintly revealed a sense of pressure.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but frown. The mission hint this time was very general. Basically, other than the fact that the mission had to be completed in this Palace, there was no other useful information, including the evaluation criteria of the mission completion rate. There was not a single word. Obviously, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue had to explore these on their own.

“Qingxue, the mission is here.” Xia ruofei said,”but the introduction is very general. It only asks us to pass the test of the cloud Palace. There is no other information. It seems that we have to figure it out ourselves!”

“Since we’re already here, we should definitely go in and take a look!” Ling Qingxue nodded.

“Of course, let’s go!” Xia ruofei said heroically,”let’s see what kind of tests there are in the cloud Palace!”

The two of them strode through the square and came to the main entrance of the cloud heaven Palace.

As they walked into the palace, the two of them felt the magnificence of the cloud Palace even more. They had to raise their heads to see the situation at the top, and the two doors in front of them were 70 to 80 meters high. The two of them looked especially small in front of the door.

The door of the heavenly cloud Palace was wide open. The two of them carefully crossed the threshold and walked into the main hall.

Before they could carefully observe the situation around them, they heard a series of creaking sounds. The two 70 to 80 – meter – tall palace gates actually closed by themselves.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue heard the sound and immediately turned around. When they saw that the palace door was closed, they only frowned slightly and immediately turned their attention to the surroundings.

Since they had decided to go to the heavenly cloud Palace, they had expected that there would be danger. They were also mentally prepared to be trapped in the heavenly cloud Palace.

“It seems like we have no way out, we can only charge forward!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“So what if there’s an escape route?” Ling Qingxue also chucklcd.”Arc you going to give up on the mission and run away?”

Xia ruofei laughed heartily.

Xia ruofei’s expression changed after he finished speaking. He asked,””Qingxue, do you hear something?”

“There’s no sound!” Ling Qingxue asked in confusion,”what did you hear?”

Xia ruofei’s expression was serious. He took out a large amount of formation materials from the spirit map space. These were the materials that he had prepared and could be used to set up the formation.

As he quickly set up the formation, he said,””I’m not too sure, but I feel like something is approaching us. Qingxue, you have to be careful and don’t stray too far from me. If there’s any danger, I can save you in time!”

“I got it!” Ling Qingxue said,”don’t worry! I’m not that weak, you should just focus on the test of the cloud Palace. If there is any danger that you can not resist, I will shout for help!”

Xia ruofei nodded. As long as Ling Qingxue called for help in time, he only needed a breath’s time to react and bring Ling Qingxue into the spirit map space to protect her.

The two of them had only exchanged a few words when Xia ruofei felt that the sound was getting louder and louder, as if a well – trained Army was approaching him.

Ling Qingxue finally heard some noise. She said,””Ruofei, I think I heard it too, but it felt a little messy…”

As soon as Ling Qingxue finished her sentence, Xia ruofei pulled her behind him to protect her because he could already vaguely see something in front of him.

It was an ant.

However, this ant was much larger than the largest ant on earth in the secular world. It was about a foot long.

Soon, more and more ants appeared in Xia ruofei’s sight.

These ants seemed to have the same habits as the ants on earth. They lined up neatly and walked towards Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue in an orderly manner.

These ants crawled out from the corners of the palace and quickly gathered into a powerful group.

Xia ruofei quickly checked the direction from which the ants had come. He had set up an AoE fire attack formation. It was impossible to adjust the formation in this situation. Fortunately, Xia ruofei had already verified the effect of the formation and did not need to make any changes.

One after another, the huge ants stepped into the array. Xia ruofei took a deep breath and formed a hand seal to activate the flame attack array.

In fact, there were still a few ants that had not entered the encirclement. However, the main ant Army was more than a hundred, and there were only ten or so ants isolated outside by the formation. It was no longer a big deal.

After the array was activated, a circle of flames was ignited, completely isolating the remaining eighty or so ants in the array.

As for the remaining ten or so ants, Xia ruofei could not be bothered with them for the time being as he was fully focused on controlling the formation.

After the formation was activated, in just two to three seconds, the raging flames had surrounded the eighty – odd ants in the formation.

When the ants saw the fire, they ran around in panic and did not even bother to attack Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei heaved a sigh of relief. Looking at the situation outside and inside the array, the ants were really afraid of fire. This was his first reaction when he saw these big ants.

It was precisely because of this that his first choice was this AoE flame attack array formation, which was also the one he had used to deal with the star Fern thorn ring.

The facts had also proven that his guess was still relatively accurate.

The ants trapped in the formation couldn’t help but tremble when they touched the fire. Then, they squeaked under the scorching flames.

Xia ruofei didn’t care about the crystals at all. He just activated the array with all his might. Soon, the flames had filled the entire array.

The 80 ants were running wildly in the array, but they couldn’t break through the wall of flames. After a while, the screams in the array gradually weakened, and after about ten minutes, it was completely silent….
