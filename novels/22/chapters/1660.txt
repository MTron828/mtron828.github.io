Chapter 1661: An earth – shattering event (2)

Wilkinson’s words sent a chill down Brook’s spine. He cried out,””No! No! Wilkinson, I beg you, please don’t ...”

However, his pleas were of no use. Wilkins ended the call without hesitation. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Brook felt weak all over. The communication device slipped from his hand and hung on the wall, shaking weakly ...

“Captain Brook, please think of something ...” Guli quickly called out.

Brook also came back to his senses. Now was not the time to be depressed. According to the trend, the plane would soon dive into the sea with a stable attitude, and the chance of survival was infinitely close to zero.

“Call the air Marshal over and tell him to bring the explosion – proof axe!” Captain Brook said decisively. Also, pull up the curtain for the first class cabin!”

In fact, Brook had almost given up hope. With the continuous hijacking in history, aircraft manufacturers had been more and more protective of the cockpit. The cockpit door was always one – way locked, and it was so strong that it was almost impossible to open it even with small explosives, let alone an explosion – proof axe. Of course, the aircraft did not have such things. It would be difficult to open the door even if they used small explosives. Now, they were just making their last attempt.

As for pulling the curtains, it was naturally to block the passengers ‘vision. Of course, this was better than nothing. If the explosion – proof axe was used to break the door, the noise would be heard by the passengers.

In fact, even though Brook and the flight attendants were whispering, Xia ruofei, who was sitting in the first class cabin, could hear everything clearly. He could even hear what Wilkins said through the communication device.

Of course, Xia ruofei had only listened attentively after he had felt that something was wrong.

Hence, among all the passengers, only Xia ruofei had almost fully understood the sudden crisis.

Xia ruofei also frowned slightly and prepared for the worst.

Once the plane was about to dive into the sea, the only way to protect himself was to hide in the spirit map space.

The possibility of an explosion if the plane fell into the sea was lower than if it crashed into the ground or a mountain. Hiding in the spirit map space still had a high chance of survival.

It was impossible for Xia ruofei to save everyone on the plane.

He wasn’t a Saint, but he couldn’t hide in there alone without caring about Feng Rao’s life. He would have to bring Feng Rao with him, and that would mean that the secret of the spirit map space would be exposed.

Xia ruofei’s mind was spinning as he quickly thought about how to get through this unexpected disaster.

The Air Force, who was hidden among the passengers, quickly rushed to the front cabin after receiving the notice. After Captain Brook briefly explained the situation, he ordered,””Use the explosion – proof axe to break down the door now! He used all his strength to slash! And he had to be fast! We don’t have much time left ...”

The air traffic police were also in despair. They had all been professionally trained on the plane and knew that it was impossible to open the cockpit door with an explosion – proof axe.

But what could he do? He could only clench his teeth and swing his axe at the cockpit door.

The huge impact almost caused the axe to fly out of his hand, but it only left a shallow mark on the cockpit door.

The air Policeman gritted his teeth and hacked at him once again ...

The voice made the passengers in the first class look uneasy. Feng Jing’s eyes were also filled with worry. She looked at Xia ruofei and asked,””What’s going on?”

Xia ruofei gave Feng Rao a comforting smile and said,””I’m fine, don’t worry!”

Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!

The sound of hacking could be heard, but the cockpit door did not move at all. A few young flight attendants had already started sobbing.

The passengers in the first – Class cabin were getting restless. Finally, a middle – aged white man stood up and walked toward the cockpit.

However, Captain Brook had already arranged for the flight attendant to guard the curtain.

“What happened?” The middle – aged white man asked with a frown.

Although the flight attendant was also very scared, she still squeezed out a smile and said,””Sir, there’s a small problem with the cockpit door, but it doesn’t affect the flight. The flight crew will fix it soon!”

The middle – aged white man tried to look inside, but his line of sight was blocked by the male flight attendant. The flight attendant said,””Sir, please return to your seat! Don’t affect the flight crew’s work!”

Perhaps it was because he heard that it was only a malfunction in the cockpit door, the middle – aged white man was still a little suspicious. However, he shrugged and returned to his seat.

All the first – Class seats were equipped with LED screens. Passengers could choose to watch movies, listen to music, or check the real – time location and status of the plane. Xia ruofei had already noticed that the plane had been dropping in altitude and had deviated from the scheduled route.

In addition, he had heard the conversation between Captain Brook and Wilkinson in the cockpit, so he knew that the situation was far more serious than what the flight attendant had just described.

Xia ruofei knew that the only way to save the plane was to open the cockpit door as soon as possible.

And the current progress didn’t seem to be going well ...

At this thought, Xia ruofei stood up and said to Feng Jing,””Sister ran, I’ll go ahead and take a look. Don’t worry, it’ll be fine ...”

Feng Jing nodded nervously. She was indeed a little afraid of Yingluo. She had been on international flights countless times, but this was the first time she had encountered such a problem.

However, when she saw Xia ruofei’s gaze, she immediately calmed down.

“Put on your seatbelt first!” Xia ruofei said after some thought.

“Alright!” Feng Rao did not hesitate and immediately fastened her seatbelt.

Xia ruofei strode forward and was stopped by the flight attendant.””Sir, the flight crew is dealing with a small problem with the cabin door. Please return to your seat.”

“I think Captain Brook might need some help,” Xia ruofei said calmly.

A strong male flight attendant blocked the path and stared into Xia ruofei’s eyes.”I don’t think so ... All you need to do is to sit properly and put on your seatbelt.”

Xia ruofei pouted. He didn’t have time to waste on this flight attendant. Of course, he wasn’t angry. After all, she was just fulfilling her duty.

Xia ruofei took another step forward. The male flight attendant was on guard and reached out to block Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei gave a light push. It looked like he did not use much strength, but the 1.85 – meter tall, strong male flight attendant was like a fragile straw. He stumbled and made way for Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei quickly walked towards the cockpit. The male flight attendant looked at him in disbelief. He could not understand how this skinny asian man could have such strength.

However, he quickly came back to his senses and realized that he still had to fulfill his duties. He quickly chased after her and shouted,””Mister, stop! You can’t go there!”

However, the first – Class cabin was only a few steps away from the cockpit. Xia ruofei looked like he was taking a stroll, but he was actually very fast. The male flight attendant could not catch up with him at all.

Soon, Xia ruofei arrived at the cockpit door. He saw the security officer gritting his teeth and using the axe to hack at the motionless cockpit door. His back was already drenched in sweat.

Captain Brook saw Xia ruofei walking over and could not help but frown.””Qiao Sen! Why did you ask this gentleman to come?”

The male flight attendant named Qiao Sen said with a bitter face,””I’m sorry, Captain Brook. I tried to stop him, but I couldn’t ...”

Captain Brook said to Xia ruofei seriously,””Sir, we are currently dealing with an unexpected situation. Please return to your seat immediately! This place might be dangerous. ”

“Mr. Captain,” Xia ruofei asked with a smile,”do you want me to sit in my seat and wait for Mr. Wilkinson to fall into the sea with everyone?”
