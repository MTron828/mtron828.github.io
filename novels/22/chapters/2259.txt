2260 Elder song summons (2)

This was undoubtedly very important to the gradually declining Li family.

Therefore, Li Zhe spared no effort to please Xia ruofei and song Rui. However, the two of them had already discussed outside that they would not accept any new shareholders for the time being. Hence, they accepted all kinds of flattery from Li Zhe and pretended to be confused about all the hints and explicit hints that he wanted to invest in the company.

Li Zhe’s status was also a little lacking. If song Rui did not relent, he did not dare to show the slightest bit of impatience. He could only sigh in his heart and continue to carry on his shamelessness. From now on, he would continue to get close to song Rui and the others.

To Xia ruofei, this drinking session was definitely not as enjoyable as drinking with his brothers. Not only was it because everyone at the table had their own thoughts and did not feel like a simple gathering of brothers, but another important reason was that the Liu family’s matter had more or less affected Xia ruofei’s mood.

So, at nineo’ clock, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Everyone, it’s getting late. I suggest that everyone finish the wine on the table and go back to their own homes. How about it?”

Naturally, no one objected to Xia ruofei’s suggestion. Gao Jun quickly asked the waiter to pour the rest of the wine together, then took the initiative to stand up and make another toast. Everyone divided the remaining wine, and each person poured half a glass.

Gao Jun raised his glass and expressed his gratitude. Then, everyone toasted and the dinner was over.

The Assistant Director, Luo Xue, who was brought by Gao Jun, left the room quickly after finishing the last glass of wine.

When Xia ruofei and the others walked out of the private room and arrived at the entrance of the Prince’s Mansion’s private kitchen, Luo Xue had already directed the guests ‘cars to wait at the entrance. Ran ran had come down earlier to inform the driver.

Wu Qiang drove Xia ruofei’s Land Rover and sat in the first row. Gao Jun and the others sent Xia ruofei and the other two off first. It was not convenient for cars to turn around and many people were preparing to leave at this time, so Xia ruofei did not reject them. He cupped his hands to everyone and got into the car.

Qin Yanan and he Yu also got into the car separately. The two of them had also been toasted a lot tonight, and their faces were red. However, they seemed to be in a good condition, and their eyes were relatively clear. They probably didn’t drink too much.

Xia ruofei rolled down the window and waved at Gao Jun and the others with a smile. Qin Yanan gestured for Wu Qiang to drive.

The car started slowly. Song Rui stood by the window and said,””Ruofei, contact me by phone tomorrow!”

Xia ruofei nodded understandingly and rolled up the window.

The car drove smoothly all the way and returned to the courtyard house in liuhai Lane after about 40 minutes.

Xia ruofei brought Qin Yanan and he Yu to the courtyard in the middle. He stopped and said,””Yanan, Heyu, you also drank a lot tonight! Hurry up and go back to your room to rest!”

“Yes, Chairman!” Qin Yanan and he Yu responded at the same time.

Xia ruofei continued,”I have something to do tomorrow. I need to go out. You don’t have to accompany me.” You can choose to sleep in or walk around the capital. ”

“Then we’ll have to thank the chairman for his understanding!” Qin Yanan said with a smile.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”if you go out to play, remember to issue an invoice. The company will pay for the expenses!” Alright, go back to your rooms and rest ...”

After Xia ruofei returned to her room, she took a quick shower and sat on her bed to cultivate the great Dao Arts. After she was done, she lay down to rest.

The next morning, when Xia ruofei was eating breakfast in the backyard, she saw that Qin Yanan and he Yu had also arrived. She couldn’t help but ask jokingly,””Eh? It’s not easy to give you a day off, why don’t you sleep a little more?”

Qin Yanan said cheekily,”President Xia, you’ve already promised to reimburse our travel expenses. How can we let down your good intentions?” Of course, I have to get up early! There are a lot of scenic spots in Beijing!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”that makes sense!” Then hurry up and eat breakfast! Oh right, let Wu Qiang drive with you! I’m not using a car today!”

When they went to elder song’s place, the song family must have sent a car to pick them up, because ordinary cars that wanted to enter the area where elder song lived would have to go through a strict inspection, which was too troublesome.

Qin Yanan quickly waved her hand and said,””President Xia, no need! No need! We can even take a taxi or the subway! There’s no need to trouble brother Wu!”

Xia ruofei thought about it and realized that Qin Yanan and Xia Ling probably wanted to be free as well. They could go wherever they wanted. Besides, Beijing’s subway traffic was indeed very convenient. As long as they didn’t become “human meat cans” during rush hour, the experience was pretty good.

Hence, he said,”that’s fine!” I’ll respect your opinions. However, you two girls must be careful when you go out! If there’s anything, you can call me or Wu Qiang immediately!”

If he let Wu Qiang follow them, there was no need to worry about their safety. However, if they were to travel by themselves, Xia ruofei would still be worried.

“Don’t worry, President Xia!”Qin Yanan said with a smile. We’ll be careful!”

Xia ruofei nodded and did not say anything else. He sat down and started eating breakfast.

After eating, Qin Yanan and he Yu said goodbye to Xia ruofei and went out to take a taxi to the capital.

Xia ruofei, on the other hand, returned to his courtyard. He sat by the stone table and made tea. The fragrance of the tea leaves calmed Xia ruofei down.

At around 9 am, Xia ruofei received a call from song Rui.””RUO Fei, come out! We’ll be there in about five minutes, at this side of liuhai Lane!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei replied.

He got up and went back to his room. He picked up a bag that he had prepared in advance yesterday and walked to the front yard.

The bag contained high – Quality iron – Skin maples, which were also iron – Skin dendrobes produced in the space. They were personally made by Xia Qing, and the quality was better than the iron – Skin maples sold by the Taoyuan company and Tongren Hall.

Of course, no matter how high the quality was, it was still an iron – skinned maple bucket. Compared to eccentric song’s status, this gift was really nothing.

However, with Xia ruofei’s relationship with elder song, he did not have to spend so much effort to prepare a gift every time. It was just a kind gesture.

Xia ruofei strolled to the front yard and waited in the alley outside for two minutes. He saw a black sedan with a red flag driving over from the side of Desheng Gate. He saw song Rui sitting in the front passenger seat.

The car stopped at the entrance of the courtyard house. Song Rui stuck his head out and said,””Ruofei, get in the car!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The chauffeur had already gotten out of the car. He quickly walked to Xia ruofei’s side and opened the back door.

Although the driver was wearing a black suit, his short hair, straight back, and sharp aura showed that he was a soldier, and a high – Quality soldier at that.

Xia ruofei nodded at him and got into the car.

The chauffeur returned to the car, and soon, the red flag sedan started slowly and drove steadily towards the other exit of the alley.

Xia ruofei and song Rui did not speak along the way.

Song Rui sat in the front passenger seat and looked at his phone absentmindedly. Xia ruofei simply leaned back in the soft seat and closed his eyes to rest.

The car drove for about an hour before they arrived at elder song’s antique house.

The red flag car drove in through the open middle door and stopped in the first courtyard.

Xia ruofei did not wait for the chauffeur to open the door. He pushed the door open and got out.

Xia ruofei’s old acquaintance, Master song’s personal secret, manager Lu, stood beside the car with a smile on his face. He said to Xia ruofei,””Comrade ruofei, the chief has been waiting for a long time.”

Xia ruofei said half – jokingly,”then I’m in big trouble. Grandpa song is very busy. How can he waste so much time for me?”

“If that’s the case, then let’s not waste any more time and hurry up to see the chief!” Manager Lu laughed.

“You’re right, manager Lu!” Xia ruofei agreed.

Manager Lu made an inviting gesture and said,””RUO Fei, this way please!”

Xia ruofei looked at song Rui, who had just gotten out of the car. Seeing that he had no intention of following them, he nodded and walked towards the courtyard in the middle.
