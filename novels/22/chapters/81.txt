Chapter 82: Chapter 80 full pot (1)

It rose! And it was a huge increase! After a few seconds, the crowd started to stir. Boss Chen, who had been sitting next to them, couldn’t help but stand up, his expression very interesting. Master Xu’s mouth was also slightly agape. He hurriedly wiped the cut carefully, so that everyone could see it more clearly. There was a hint of green on the palm – sized cut surface, with some white mist mixed in. However, it was obvious that the green was very pure. “It should be Yang Lu!” “I wonder how it’s like to plant water?” “It shouldn’t be too bad! This raw stone is only 250000 Yuan, it must have increased by a lot!” Everyone was in a heated discussion. Boss Chen’s expression changed slightly as he said,””Brother Xia, are you willing to sell this piece of material? I’ll buy it back for 500000 Yuan!” A 250,000 – Yuan raw stone’s value had doubled just because a “window” was opened and a little green was revealed. This was the charm of stone gambling. Xia ruofei smiled and said,”boss Chen, you know I’m not short of money. Isn’t stone gambling just for fun?” Let’s just open them all first!” Xia ruofei knew very well that the value of the Jade in this raw stone was definitely more than 500000 Yuan. Naturally, he would not sell it just like that. Boss Chen was a little disappointed, and the crowd also tried to persuade Xia ruofei. “Little brother, 500000 is enough! If we rub the stones again, we’ll have nothing left if it collapses!” “Yup! If you sell it for 500000 Yuan, you’ll be able to make up for all the losses you’ve suffered earlier, and you’ll even make a small profit. Not bad!” “Greed is like a snake trying to swallow an elephant ...” Xia ruofei smiled and ignored the crowd. He motioned for master Xu to continue. It was already green, so he naturally couldn’t cut it again. Master Xu changed the grinding machine and began to rub the stone along the surface. Master Xu was indeed an experienced master. His hands were very stable as he held the grinding wheel and slowly rubbed the surface of the stone. Everyone’s eyes were focused on the raw stone. Except for the grinding sound of the grinding wheel and the raw stone, no one on the scene spoke. After more than half an hour, the raw stone was slowly unraveled by master Xu’s hands, gradually revealing its true appearance. It was a whole piece of green jade, about the size of a volleyball. The green color was evenly distributed, and it looked full of vitality under the light. “You look very healthy! It’s at least yang green!” “But the water head is average, and the transparency isn’t very high. It should be a dry green species ...” “That’s amazing! This little brother was only bought for 250000 Yuan!” “Yup! He’s struck it rich this time ...” Everyone was discussing and their words revealed their envy of Xia ruofei. This was not the first time Xia ruofei had seen an undiscovered piece of Jade, but he was still attracted by its beauty. If he didn’t need funds, he would definitely take it back and let the spirit map scroll absorb it. However, the construction of the farm was very important, so this piece of Jade could only be sold. Of course, Xia ruofei did not say anything because he knew that there would be people who wanted to buy it. Sure enough, after a few seconds of silence, a middle – aged fat man took the lead and said,””Little brother, I’m willing to pay 1.6 million for this piece of Jade. Sell it to me!” As soon as the fat middle – aged man finished speaking, another old man with a goatee immediately said,””Such a big piece of dried green, and it’s only 1.6 million? You’re bullying this little brother for not knowing, okay? I’ll pay 1.8 million!” “1.9 million, I’m taking it!” Another person had joined the competition. Xia ruofei stood at the side with a smile. He didn’t even need to say anything. Everyone would naturally start bidding, and he only needed the highest bidder to win. Very quickly, the price had reached 2.1 million. The highest bidder was the little old man with the goatee. At this moment, boss Chen, who had not participated in the bidding, suddenly said,””I’ll take the 2.1 million ...” His words stunned everyone. Someone had already bid 2.1 million! Even if he was the owner of spirit Jade house, that raw stone already belonged to Xia ruofei. Now that it was being sold as a raw material, there should be a first come, first served basis, right? However, boss Chen only paused for a moment before he continued,””2.1 million, plus the 300000 Yuan of Jade in exchange for this piece of dry green material! Brother Xia, how is it?” Previously, Xia ruofei had asked for 300000 Yuan worth of Jade, but he had not paid for it. Now, boss Chen was using these jades as a bargaining chip, which was equivalent to a bid of 2.4 million Yuan. “2.4 million? Boss Chen ... Isn’t your price a little outrageous?” The old man with the goatee said,”aren’t you afraid of losing money?” Boss Chen smiled and said,”old Gu, most of the Jade materials that brother Xia wants are broken pieces, but this piece is a whole piece. I estimate that you can take out 28 to 29 bracelets. The rest of the materials can be used to make some small accessories. You should make a small profit.” The goateed old man sighed. He knew that he couldn’t beat boss Chen, so he didn’t plan to bid anymore. Xia ruofei also knew when to stop. He smiled and said,””Boss Chen, deal!” “Hahaha! Refreshing! Brother Xia, thank you!” Boss Chen patted Xia ruofei’s shoulder and said. The onlookers shook their heads and sighed when they saw that they couldn’t get the Jade. Some people were envious of Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei had spent a total of 400000 on the raw stones. He had earned 1.7 million just by reselling them. On top of that, he had also obtained a Jade material worth 300000. He had made a lot of money! Boss Chen was also a straightforward person. He immediately printed out a standard jade trade contract and signed it with Xia ruofei. Then, he told the shop assistant to transfer the money to Xia ruofei and kept the volleyball – sized dry green type jade. At this time, the shop assistant who was preparing the Jade in the next shop brought over a bag of Jade worth 300000 Yuan. Boss Chen personally handed it to Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei checked it and confirmed that there was no problem. The deal was officially closed. “Boss Chen,” Xia ruofei asked with a smile,”you said that I can pick one or two stones from the pile over there. Does that still count?” Boss Chen was stunned for a moment, then laughed out loud.””Brother Xia, you’ve already earned two million Yuan. Would you still be interested in those low – grade raw stones?” Xia ruofei laughed,”who told you to give it to me for free?” Who wouldn’t want raw gemstones that don’t cost money?” “No problem!” Boss Chen laughed. Who asked me to spread the word? Brother Xia, you can pick whichever you like, or even a few more. Just take it as a thank you gift from me!” Hearing this, Xia ruofei no longer stood on ceremony. He walked over and pretended to rummage through the pile of raw stones. Then, he picked up the raw stone that could make the spirit painting scroll vibrate on its own and said with a smile,””This will do!” Boss Chen glanced at the raw stone and smiled.””Alright! Brother Xia, do you need me to open this stone on the spot?” Boss Chen didn’t care about this unremarkable raw stone at all. Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ll just take it!” Otherwise, how embarrassing would it be if he didn’t get anything? I’ll go home and cut it myself!” Boss Chen couldn’t help but laugh out loud. Then he said,””Brother Xia, you’re the person with the best luck I’ve ever seen in stone gambling! I’m going to participate in the Myanmar public Jade bid soon, are you interested in accompanying me? I can pay you according to the highest standard of a stone gambling consultant!” Xia ruofei replied without even thinking,”I appreciate your kindness.” Besides, Myanmar is a poor place with no pretty girls, so I’m too lazy to go and join in the fun!” Xia ruofei was cautious by nature. If he didn’t need money urgently, he wouldn’t have come to gamble again. Xia ruofei naturally avoided the Myanmar public bid that boss Chen had mentioned. Mr. Chen could tell that Xia ruofei knew nothing about stone gambling. He attributed the two gains that Xia ruofei had made to luck. In fact – Boss Chen had been in this business for more than ten years and had seen similar situations like Xia ruofei ‘s – therefore, he did not suspect anything at all – Xia ruofei’s rejection was within his expectations. Why would a rich young master Care about such a small reward? After chatting with boss Chen for a while, Xia ruofei left spirit Jade house with the bag of Jade. On the way back, Xia ruofei could not suppress his excitement. This time, he had really returned with a full load! Besides, Xia ruofei had a feeling that the biggest reward of this trip was not the two million Yuan in cash or the three hundred thousand Yuan worth of Jade. It was highly possible that the unraveled black raw stone was the biggest surprise of his trip ...Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))
