Chapter 292: Chapter 288 – Clear (1)

Xu Wu had arrived later and did not know much about the situation, so he turned to look at Xia ruofei. “The Bureau chief is very safe ...” Xia ruofei said calmly. Upon hearing these words, du Xiaohai suddenly heaved a long sigh of relief. Since he received the call from the leader of the Songping Municipal Party Committee, du Xiaohai had been in a state of high tension. Now, he had suddenly relaxed. This Deputy Department Director level cadre who had seen many big scenes actually felt like he was about to collapse. “That’s good, that’s good ...” Du Xiaohai said. Xia ruofei’s expression was cold. He frowned and said,””Secretary du, I think the most important thing now is to catch all these thugs! Du Xiaohai couldn’t help but shiver and quickly said,”Yes! We’ll definitely punish him severely!” After saying that, du Xiaohai turned around and ordered,”Director Guo, Captain Xiang Zhong, immediately order our comrades to arrest all these thugs! If any of you escape, I’ll hold you guys responsible!” “Yes!” “Yes!” The director of the Public Security Bureau and the captain of the armed police responded at the same time. Then, they saluted Xia ruofei and Xu Wu and immediately went to command the police to arrest all the hooligans who were under the control of the police and armed police. Wu De had been in WYS city for so many years and was now considered to have some status. Naturally, he could recognize du Xiaohai at a glance. Wu De saw that du Xiaohai was so polite to the two young men with guns, even with a trace of respect, and they repeatedly mentioned the “chief” in their conversation. How could he not know that he had caused a big disaster this time? The armed police behind him clipped his hands behind his back and handcuffed them. The cold handcuffs made Wu De quiver. He also recovered from his daze and quickly shouted,””Big Brothers, I ... I didn’t intend to besiege the chief! I didn’t ... Didn’t know that the Bureau chief was there ... I’m being wronged ...” Xia ruofei strode over and looked at Wu De coldly, saying,””It doesn’t matter if you know it or not. The truth is that you led more than a hundred people in an attempt to attack the country’s leaders. Don’t be too arrogant. If you walk at night too much, you’ll eventually meet a ghost! Of course, the prerequisite is that you can save your dog life this time ...” How could Wu De still have the prestige of a local tyrant at this time? “Big brother, I was wrong!” He cried bitterly. I really don’t know ...” At this moment, Wu De’s intestines were really green with regret. If he could turn back time, he would never choose to threaten and tempt li Zhifu. He wouldn’t even open a tea factory at all. He already had enough money. Even if he didn’t do anything, it was enough to live a carefree life. But now, it was too late to say anything. Because of his arrogance, he had fallen into the abyss of eternal damnation. Xia ruofei looked at Wu De coldly and turned around to leave. Du Xiaohai’s eyes were about to spew fire as he said loudly,”Handcuff them all and take them away!” Du Xiaohai hated these hooligans to death. Perhaps because of today’s incident, his position as the Secretary was over. Du Xiaohai was only in his forties this year. He was considered very young among the Deputy department directors. He was also the youngest member of the Standing Committee of the Songping Municipal Party Committee. It could be said that he had a bright future and was a rising star in politics. However, because of the stupid behavior of these hooligans, this new political star was likely to fall. The armed police soldiers and police officers handcuffed all the gangsters in an orderly manner. Under the watch of the armed police with Type 95 automatic rifles, these little punks were all very well – behaved, not daring to even breathe loudly. They all obediently allowed themselves to be captured. “Comrade, may I ask where the chief is now?” du Xiaohai asked carefully. Can we meet the Chief? I have to personally reflect on what happened today to the Bureau chief ...” “Secretary du, please wait for a moment. I’ll go ask for instructions,” Xia ruofei said calmly. “Alright, alright, sorry for the trouble!” Du Xiaohai quickly said. Xia ruofei nodded slightly and turned to walk towards the door of the shop. He didn’t have a good impression of du Xiaohai. As the head of the local government, du Xiaohai had managed his jurisdiction so badly. First of all, he was not a competent Secretary. Even if du Xiaohai had no direct relationship with Wu De, the Secretary would always be the first person responsible. As long as there were any problems in the jurisdiction area, the Secretary must take the leadership responsibility. Xia ruofei left du Xiaohai behind and walked to the door of the shop. He opened the small door on the rolled – up curtain and bent down to get into the shop. He closed the door as soon as he entered, blocking du Xiaohai’s uneasy and inquiring gaze. “Little Xia, what’s the situation outside? Why do I hear gunshots?” Eccentric song asked calmly. “The situation is under control.” Xia ruofei said,”the local government has sent out police officers and armed police to arrest all the hooligans and ruffians who were causing trouble!” Then, Xia ruofei continued,”chief, I was the one who fired the gun just now. There were more than a hundred people surrounding the shop and someone was even smashing the door. I had no choice but to fire the gun to establish my authority. Otherwise, the situation would have gotten out of control and this place would have been in danger.” “You did the right thing!” Elder song smiled and nodded. Little Xia, are there any casualties?” “I shot down two of those hooligans.” Xia ruofei said,”the others are fine.” Elder song looked at Xia ruofei approvingly and nodded. Xia ruofei then asked for further instructions.”Chief, du Xiaohai, the Secretary of the municipal government of WYS city, is outside with the comrades from the Public Security Bureau and the armed police Squadron. Do you ... Want to meet them?” Elder song pondered for a moment and turned to manager Lu.””Xiao Lu, did the southeast province send someone down as well?” “Chief,” manager Lu replied immediately.”According to the feedback from the general office of the southeast Provincial Party Committee, the team is led by the southeast Provincial Party Committee’s political and legal secretary, comrade Lei Yong. He’s on his way to Mount Wuyi along with related comrades from the provincial political and legal Committee and the provincial Public Security Department. In addition, the main leaders of the Songping Municipal Party Committee are also on their way to Mount Wuyi.” Elder song nodded and said to Xia ruofei,””Little Xia, I won’t be meeting the leaders of the local party Committee and government for the time being. Let’s go back to the hotel after we’re done dealing with the matters outside. Otherwise, when comrade Lei Yong arrives later, we’ll have to meet him again.” Elder song had originally been afraid of trouble, so he had hidden from everyone and come to visit in plain clothes. But after today’s incident, everyone in the southeast province’s officialdom knew that he had come to Mount Wu Yi. It was no longer possible to ask for a “plain clothes”. The Secretary of the political and legal Committee of the Provincial Party Committee had come from the provincial city 300 to 400 kilometers away in person. It was reasonable for elder song to meet him, so he thought that they might as well just be together. It must be known that the leaders of all levels set off as soon as they received the news, which meant that their arrival time was different. If elder song met du Xiaohai now, he would have to meet him again when the main leaders of the Songping Municipal Party Committee arrived later. He would have to meet him again when Lei Yong led his team to Mount Wuyi. This was too troublesome. Xia ruofei immediately replied,”understood!” Chief, I’ll go out first. Please rest here for a while. We can return to the hotel after the area outside is cleared. ” “Mm! Little Xia, you’ve worked hard. ” Eccentric song said with a smile. Xia ruofei opened the door again and du Xiaohai quickly went up to him, looking at Xia ruofei with hope in his eyes. “Secretary du, I’ve asked the chief,” Xia ruofei said indifferently. The chief has instructed you to focus on dealing with the aftermath here first. When Secretary Lei of the Provincial Party Committee of political and legal arrives, he will meet you all. ” Hearing this, du Xiaohai’s face suddenly turned pale, and he seemed to have lost his soul.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m
