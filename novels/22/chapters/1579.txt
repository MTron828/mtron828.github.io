Chapter 1581: Four times the original price (3)

Translator: 549690339

Of course, this was not because Song Wei was greedy. It was the kind of love a girl would have for beautiful jade. Especially since she had personally chosen this piece of Jade from thousands of raw stones. She had cut it out from such an ordinary stone. This sense of achievement was incomparable. Although she had relied on Xia ruofei’s guidance, Song Wei still felt very accomplished.

Yu mingdong hesitated and said,””Miss song, I wonder if you’re willing to sell this piece of Jade? I’m willing to pay five hundred thousand to buy it!”

At first, the onlookers were fantasizing about competing for it. After all, the quality of the Jade was not bad, and it was not small either. It was enough to get a bracelet.

However, as soon as Yu mingdong’s price was announced, everyone suddenly became depressed. The price that Yu mingdong quoted suddenly hit the ceiling. Even if they got it at this price, they would at most break even. Only those Jade merchants who were particularly short of raw materials and did not get much from this bidding would buy it at a loss.

Song Wei held the waxy Jade and said,””President Yu, I’m sorry! I want to keep this piece of Imperial Jade for myself ...”

Xia ruofei could not help but ask,”Song Wei, why?” Now you can make several times more by selling it, so it’s useless for you to keep one piece of Imperial Jade!”

Song Wei looked at Xia ruofei and whispered in his ear,””Because I personally discovered it! Since you’re so skilled, I’d like to ask you to help me carve a few accessories ...”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”Song Wei, to be honest, this piece of Jade isn’t of the highest quality. It can’t even be compared to your Doraemon pendant ... I think the best option is to sell it and cash it out. As for the other jade products you want, I can find better ones ...”

Song Wei’s eyes lit up and asked,”Are you talking about the few raw stones you bought ...”

“I can’t guarantee that. Who can guarantee that there won’t be Jade inside and what quality it will be?” Xia ruofei quickly replied. But I have a good relationship with the MA family of Hong Kong, so it’s not a big problem for me to buy one or two pieces of top – grade Jade. ”

Song Wei nodded. After a moment of silence, she said to Yu mingdong,””Mr. Yu, I’ve decided to transfer this Imperial Jade to you. The price will be as you said, 500000 Yuan!”

“Thank you!” Yu mingdong was overjoyed. Thank you! Miss song, thank you for giving up your treasure! I’ll transfer the money to you immediately!” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

In fact, Yu mingdong’s surprised expression was more of an act. He didn’t have to be so happy for a small piece of glutinous Jade. Besides, there was no profit at this price.

He was giving face to Xia ruofei, and he also wanted to repay him.

Yu mingdong asked for Song Wei’s bank account number, then quickly wrote a check and handed it to Shi Lei. He asked him to go to the bank staff working at the public property next door to transfer the money.

Soon, Song Wei received a notification from the bank that 500000 Yuan had been transferred to her account. She couldn’t help but feel a little surreal. In just a few hours, her 120000 Yuan had become 500000 Yuan? She had only written a list and she had earned 380000 Yuan!

Was there any faster way to earn money?

Xia ruofei’s mind turned and he stopped Yu mingdong, who was about to cut his raw stones. He said,””CEO Yu, you should sign a formal transfer agreement for your deal with Song Wei!”
