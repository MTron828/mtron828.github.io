Chapter 652: Sensing the Jade Leaf.1

“Master, world stones can promote the growth of the spirit map world,” Xia Qing said. “As long as there are enough world stones, the spirit map world can expand quickly.”

“World stone?” Xia ruofei revealed a doubtful expression and said,”I once gave Ling tukong ... Ling tu world to absorb jadeite. Xia Qing, is the world stone you’re talking about jadeite?”

Xia Qing shook her head and said,”master, as far as I know, the jadeite contains a very small amount of world stone. If the spirit map world absorbs a large amount of it, it can also expand. However, the amount required is extremely large.”

“Then what is a world stone?” Xia ruofei asked subconsciously. Then, he had a flash of inspiration and quickly asked,””Xia Qing, the world stone you mentioned, is it a type of black stone?”

Xia Qing nodded and said,”the vast majority of world stones are indeed black in color. However, there are some exceptions occasionally.” I can sense the aura of fresh world stones in the spirit map world. Master, you must have let the spirit map world absorb world stones recently. ”

Xia ruofei felt excited. It was true! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The black rough stone that time was the world stone that Xia Qing was talking about. No wonder the effect was so good after absorbing it that time. It was much better than the effect of jadeite that was several times better.

This was the correct way to promote the upgrade of the spirit map space!

Furthermore, Xia ruofei noticed a key point in Xia Qing’s words!

He impatiently asked,”Xia Qing, you said earlier that you can sense the aura of the world stone?” So you can help me find the world stone?”

Xia Qing revealed a guilty expression and said,””I’m very sorry, master. I rely on the spirit map world to exist, so I can’t leave it. ”

The surprise on Xia ruofei’s face froze. So it turned out that he was overjoyed!

He sighed and asked,””How did this happen? Xia Qing, are you really unable to leave the spirit map world? I should be able to easily send you to the outside world. ”

......

Xia Qing said,”master, I completely rely on the core formation of the spirit map world to survive. Even if my body can leave the spirit map world, I can’t bring my consciousness out. So, when I go to the outside world, I can only be a puppet that can’t move and has no consciousness.”

After Xia ruofei heard this, he realized that this shortcut would not work. He could not help but feel depressed.

“Master,” Xia Qing reminded,”the spirit map world can actually sense the world stone.”

Xia ruofei forced a smile and said,”I know that. That’s how we found the world stone last time.” But the spirit map world’s sensing range is too small, and the outside world is so big. It’s like looking for a needle in a haystack ... Forget it, I’ll think of a way slowly ...”

Xia Qing thought for a moment and said,”master, I actually have another way, but I don’t know if it can help you ...”

“Oh? Tell me!” Xia ruofei said.

“I know of a formation that is specially used to find the sensing world stone.” Xia Qing said,”actually, I also have this kind of array on me.”

Xia ruofei’s eyes lit up.

“I should be able to find a way to set up this kind of formation.” Xia Qing said,”master, you should be able to bring the array to the outside world with you. It should be able to help you find the world stone.”

“Then how wide can the sensing range be?” Xia ruofei asked hurriedly.

“It’s definitely larger than the spirit map world. ” Xia Qing thought for a moment and said,”but I’ve never tried it before, so I can’t say for sure. But at least, there shouldn’t be a problem within a ten – mile radius.”

Xia ruofei was overjoyed. Even if the Suan ni was five kilometers in diameter, it was much larger than the spirit map’s sensing range. One must know that the spirit map would only tremble when one was very close to it, and this was only for the world stone. For ordinary jadeite, Xia ruofei would only be able to sense it when he touched it.

If he could sense the presence of a world stone within a five – kilometer radius, it would be of great help to him in his search for it.

“Xia Qing, you can start setting up the formation now!” Xia ruofei asked anxiously,”Oh right, do you need any materials?”

“Jade. The higher the quality, the better!” Xia Qing said.

Xia ruofei was a little worried and said,””I can’t bring the Jade into the medium! It will be directly absorbed by the spirit map world. ”

Xia Qing smiled and said,”master, I’m here!” You just have to bring the Jade in, it won’t be absorbed directly!”

“You still have this ability!” Xia ruofei smiled in surprise and asked,”is suet white jade okay?”

In terms of high – Quality Jade, there were still some of the Supreme – grade suet white jade that Lu You gave Xia ruofei last time. It would be perfect if he could use it.

This was because Xia ruofei usually didn’t have high requirements for the quality of the Jade he bought. Instead, he pursued quantity. Besides, Xia ruofei didn’t keep any Jade. Every time he bought it, he would give it all to the spirit map space to absorb.

“Sheep – Fat white jade is fine,” Xia Qing nodded.

“Alright, just you wait!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll take the sheep – Fat white jade from the outside world in a while.”

“No problem,” he said. Xia Qing grinned.

With a thought, Xia ruofei disappeared from the space.

After returning to the room outside, Xia ruofei immediately took out the sheep – Fat white jade that was locked in the cabinet.

To be safe, he did not put all the sheep – Fat white jade into the space. Instead, he chose a larger piece of scrap and put it into the space with a wave of his hand. He then controlled the sheep – Fat white jade to appear in front of the primordial stone tablet.
