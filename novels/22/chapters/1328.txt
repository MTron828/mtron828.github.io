Chapter 1329: The first appearance of the Chinese perch_1

Translator: 549690339

Just as Chen shun and Chen Weinan were being taken away by the discipline Inspection team in despair, a contract signing event involving hundreds of millions of dollars was going on at the three mountains Paradise Farm thousands of miles away.

There was no grand ceremony, nor was there a lot of media support. Only less than ten people from both sides were present. The scene of the signing ceremony was a little low – Key compared to its actual value.

It must be known that this contract involved a total of 136.6 kilograms of top quality Cordyceps, and the purchase price for this Cordyceps was 780000 Chinese dollars per kilogram, which was equivalent to a total transaction amount of 106 million Yuan.

And this was not a one – time deal. The contract also stated that for the next three years, peach blossom company would provide no less than 200 kilograms of Cordyceps sinensis of the same quality every year, and the purchase price would increase by 5% every year.

According to the total contract amount, it had already reached 500 to 600 million Chinese dollars.

Lin Zhongming signed the contract on behalf of Tongren Tang. Under Xia ruofei’s insistence, the main body of the contract was signed by Tongren Tang chain company in the East China region.

As the representative of the group’s leadership, Tang weiran witnessed the entire signing ceremony.

When Lin Zhongming signed his name, his whole body trembled. This contract was like a golden step, and he seemed to see a bright future.

Xia ruofei was also in a good mood. After signing the contract, not only would the 100 million fund gap be solved, but he would not need to use the overseas funds and it would bring more than 6 million in cash flow for the company. In the next three years, the company would have an additional revenue of 100 to 200 million each year. There was nothing better than this result. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

After the negotiations with Chen shun fell through, Xia ruofei did think about cooperating with other Chinese medicine companies. Although the process might be a little complicated, the quality of this batch of wormgrass was there. He didn’t have to worry about not being able to sell it.

Of course, after the Tongren Tang Group showed their sincerity, the Vice President Tang weiran came to apologize personally and even took the initiative to raise the purchase price. Xia ruofei went with the flow and continued to cooperate with Tongren Tang.

After all, he had already gained some face, so there was no need to be too pretentious.

Moreover, objectively speaking, Tongren Hall’s channels were very powerful. At least, among the Chinese medicine companies in the country, they were one of the best.

With Xia ruofei’s lazy personality, he would try to avoid as much trouble as possible. He was happy to see this result.

Both parties signed the contract and exchanged it before they both signed it and shook hands.

The assistant, Liu Qian, pressed the shutter in time and took a photo for the information.

“Happy cooperation, President Xia!” Lin Zhongming said with some excitement.

“Big brother Lin, it’s a pleasure working with you!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“President Xia, I will personally follow up on the funds. I promise that the transaction will be completed within two days!” Tang weiran said happily.

Because the transaction amount was beyond the authority of the East China region, it had to be approved by the Tongren Tang chain company in Beijing. The East China region also needed time to mobilize the liquid funds.

However, Tang weiran had personally guaranteed that there would be no problem with the funds.

Even if it was an ordinary acquisition contract, Tongren Tang rarely delayed or even reneged on the debt. After all, the reputation of a century – old company was still very important. However, the accounting period might be longer. In this era where channels were King, Tongren Tang, who had such a huge sales channel, was the strong party in most of the transactions.

“Then I’ll leave it to you, President Tang!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”we are indeed in a hurry to use this money. We’ve really troubled you ...”

“No, no, no!” Tang Wei Ran said,”we’ll hand over the money and the goods at the same time. This is a natural thing to do! President Xia is already very supportive of us by giving us three days to raise the funds!”

Tang weiran was just saying nice things. They weren’t buying vegetables on the street. How could they hand over the money and the goods?

This was for pharmaceutical companies. If it was a supermarket or other retail channels, they would transfer the goods in advance. After the goods were sold, there would be a three to six months accounting period. From time to time, they would even ask the suppliers to participate in various promotions to reduce their profits and transfer the cost of their promotions.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”President Tang, brother Lin, don’t be in a hurry to leave. Let’s have a few more drinks this afternoon. Also ... I have something good for you to try!”

“Oh?” Tang Wei Ran’s eyes lit up.

The peach Garden vegetables he had tasted last night had already left a deep impression on him. The Drunken Eight Immortals wine was even more so.

Tang Wei Ran couldn’t help but ask,””President Xia, could it be that your company has a new product?”

Xia ruofei smiled mysteriously and said,””You’ll know when the time comes! It can be considered our new product! Please give us your valuable opinions after you’ve tried it!”

“Then we have to have a good taste!” Tang weiran said with great interest,”President Xia is really capable! Your company hasn’t been established for a long time, but it’s doing well in the field of agricultural products, Traditional Chinese Medicine, and even in the field of cosmetics. Every product is eye – catching!”

Tang Wei Ran had been working in a company for so many years, so she had a very unique vision.

In the two days he had been at the Paradise company, he had naturally collected some information about the company.

She didn’t know if she didn’t look, but she was shocked when she did.
