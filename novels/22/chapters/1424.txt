After Feng Jing gave pang Hao a call, the two of them continued walking out. They soon saw him waiting at the entrance of the banquet hall. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“President Xia, what are your instructions?” Pang Hao asked jokingly.

Pang Hao’s mood was rather brilliant when he found out that he would be receiving a year – end bonus of one to two million Yuan.

A year ago, he was still a specialized student in a third – rate college, doing odd jobs in the finance department of a small company. His monthly salary was so low that it was not even enough for him to spend.

After he came to paradise Corporation, not only did he manage the entire finance department alone, his salary increased several times, and his year – end bonus was so big that he couldn’t believe it.

With this year – end bonus, he could buy a house in the city soon. It might be a little difficult to pay in full, but it was definitely not a problem to pay the down payment. Now that his monthly income was so high, a few thousand Yuan monthly payment was not a problem.

Who would dare to look at him with colored glasses in the future?

In the past, at the end of the year, when relatives and friends gathered, pang Hao always felt a little inferior. Other families ‘children graduated from prestigious schools and received high salaries in large companies, but he could not even support himself. The intentional or unintentional comparisons between his relatives made him feel like he had a dagger on his back.

This year, however, he was looking forward to the reunion dinner. Dear aunties, please tremble in fear ...

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”let’s talk while we walk!” You and President Feng can take my car back. ”

The Paradise Corporation had purchased quite a number of vehicles, including two buses, mainly for the Paradise pharmaceutical factory, which had more employees. However, Xia ruofei was used to driving by himself and did not ask the company to assign him a driver.

After all, he was used to being free, and he often had to go to the warehouse in the city to deal with some things related to the spirit map space, such as iron maple, Tea Green, Drunken Eight Immortals wine, and so on. If a driver followed him, it would be inconvenient for him to do things.

The three of them walked out of the hotel together.

Xia ruofei asked,”fatty, I just want to know how much liquid funds we have in our account. If we want to take it out, how much can we take out?”

As the financial manager, pang Hao was responsible and responsible. Some data came out of his mouth without any need to think.

He said without hesitation,”this year’s net profit is about 300 million Yuan. However, the annual meeting expenses are about two million Yuan. In addition, according to the bonus plan you announced, there is another 15 million Yuan to be spent at the end of the year. So, it’s about 280 million Yuan!”

At this point, pang Hao changed the topic and said,””But we don’t have that much cash on our books. Some of the money has already been used on other projects, including the down payment for the production line of the pharmaceutical factory and the purchase of the property. We still have about 180 million in liquid funds on the company’s books! Of course, I’ll have to go back to the company to confirm the exact figure, but this figure should be close. The up and down fluctuations should not exceed five million. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and asked,””Then, is the 80 million in liquid funds left by the company enough? Will it cause pressure on the capital chain?”

Feng Rao, who was standing at the side, jumped in shock. Before pang Hao could reply, she hurriedly asked,””Chairman, you want to transfer 100 million? Was he planning something big again? It’s still dangerous for a company to have too little liquid capital, especially when we’re about to undergo structural adjustments and the finance of the two branch offices need to be independent. This 180 million is all the liquid capital of the company’s headquarters and the two branch offices!”

The Paradise Corporation had developed to its current scale, and its daily expenses were quite high. For example, the employees ‘salaries were a huge expense. In addition, although the profits of the pharmaceutical factory were frightening, the expenses were not small either. The pharmaceutical factory was still a labor – intensive industry, with a large number of employees. Moreover, the production line was running 24 hours a day, so the daily electricity bill was not a small amount.

In addition, there were various taxes, management fees, purchase fees of raw materials, and so on ...

Xia ruofei smiled.”I’m not planning to do anything big. I’m just short of money recently. Considering that the company has made quite a lot of money this year, I want to take out some of the funds for my own use ...”

“What do you need such a large sum of money for ...” Feng Jing suddenly realized Xia ruofei’s purpose and quickly said,”Chairman, I don’t lack money. You don’t have to take such a large sum of money for me!”

When Xia ruofei said that he wanted to take the 100 million from the company’s account, Feng Jing was mainly worried about the company’s cash flow and didn’t think about anything else. However, she quickly realized that Xia ruofei wanted to give her a bonus.

Xia ruofei did not lack money at all. Feng Jing knew that Xia ruofei had a large amount of US dollars in his overseas account. It was at least tens of millions, which was equivalent to hundreds of millions of Chinese dollars. Why would he need to take any profits from the company? What’s more, what kind of thing would require a hundred million Yuan?

The only possibility was that Xia ruofei wanted her to get a share of the profits.

After all, there were two shareholders in the company legally. Although her 2% shares were very small, she was still one of the shareholders.

If Xia ruofei took out 100 million Yuan of profit, he would have to give 2% to Feng Jing, which was equivalent to dividends.

Xia ruofei was not short of money, but if he did not take any dividends, Feng Jing would not be able to get the same amount of dividends.
