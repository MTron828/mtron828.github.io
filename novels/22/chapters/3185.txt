In fact, the software analyzed the data very quickly. After all, it was only a combination of the first 1000 digits, and the amount of data was not large. However, to Xia ruofei and the others, the progress bar was moving extremely slowly.

Of course, this was an illusion.

With great difficulty, the progress bar finished running and a prompt box popped up: The analysis was successful.

“Brother Xia, you open it!” Chen Xuan said.

Xia ruofei heard Chen Xuan’s trembling voice and couldn’t help but laugh.”Regardless of whether it works or not, the data is here. There’s no need to be so nervous ...”

“I wasn’t nervous before, but now I’m suddenly nervous!” Chen Xuan didn’t try to hide his nervousness, as though there was nothing to be embarrassed about.

In fact, even Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha couldn’t help but feel nervous.

Mu Sheng was calmer. He said in a deep voice,””Little brother Xia, I suggest that the four of us check the results first, and the rest of you can leave for a while. What do you think?”

The others were mu Jianfei, Yu xiner, Song Wei, and Ling Qingxue.

“No problem!” Xia ruofei replied nonchalantly.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue weren’t involved in this matter to begin with. If they took a second look at the contents, it would only invite more trouble.

Hence, Song Wei and the rest went to the other side of the lounge and sat down on the sofa.

Xia ruofei, Chen Xuan, Mu Sheng, and Liu Mansha were gathered in front of their laptops.

“I’m opening it!” Xia ruofei said. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Open!”

“Open it!”

Xia ruofei double clicked on the analyzed data folder.

In fact, what was generated was a thousand text documents. The content was the first thousand combinations that were arranged in order. After complicated calculations and comparisons, the supercomputer felt that the 1000 combinations had the highest possibility.

The file name of each document was a number, from 1 to 1000.

Everyone looked at the first article with hope. Xia ruofei double clicked the document.

The first document was naturally the one that the supercomputer thought had the highest possibility of being published. It was also what everyone was looking forward to the most.

However, when everyone glanced at the contents of the document, they couldn’t help but reveal a confused look. Although they were all Chinese characters, they couldn’t understand what they meant when they were connected together. Or rather, this was a completely meaningless combination of words!

There were more than 3000 Floating Points on the token, which meant that each document was only about 3000 words long.

Xia ruofei and the rest finished reading the document very quickly.

With the brain development level of a golden core cultivator, they could basically memorize the content.

The four of them exchanged glances, wanting to see if anyone else had discovered anything. However, the result was clearly that everyone was very confused.

In the end, Xia ruofei said,””How about this! Let’s read the second chapter first and see how it goes after a few more chapters!”

Next, Xia ruofei and the others continued to read seven to eight documents, but the result was the same. They were all meaningless combinations of words.

In fact, the higher the number, the more reasonable it should be.

Even the first chapter was full of messy combinations of words, so the later chapters were naturally not any better.

Xia ruofei’s heart sank as he realized that something might have gone wrong.

However, with a serious attitude, they still had to check all 1000 documents.

Xia ruofei said to Chen Xuan,”brother Chen, let’s bring out a few more computers. The four of us will split 250 documents each. Read them as soon as possible and then we’ll discuss.”

“I guess that’s the only way!” Chen Xuan replied dejectedly.

Chen Xuan had put in a lot of effort into this algorithm. From the looks of it, it seemed as though all of his efforts were in vain. Naturally, he was in a bad mood.

Xia ruofei had placed a laptop in the spirit map space, and Chen Xuan had two laptops as well, so they had enough in a short while.

In fact, if it wasn’t enough, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue would definitely have some. The two of them had just received storage rings and wanted to stuff their entire house into them. Things like laptops and single – lens reflex cameras must have been kept in their storage rings.

Xia ruofei copied the entire file onto the portable hard drive and asked Chen Xuan to copy the file to the other computers.

Xia ruofei said,”okay, now every computer has a complete data folder. All 1000 documents are the same. But to increase efficiency, the four of us will split up and each of us will look through 250 documents. This will be faster!”

Xia ruofei quickly explained,””Our flight time is until eight in the morning tomorrow. The data doesn’t look very good, so we have to speed up the verification process. If we can find the problem and solve it in a short time, we can still run the program again!”

“Alright!”

“We know!”

“Sect leader mu, please check documents 1 to 250! Valley leader Liu specifically looks through files 251 to 500, and brother Chen is in charge of files 501 to 750. I’ll check the last part. ” Xia ruofei quickly distributed the tasks.”Does anyone have a different opinion?”

“Let’s arrange it this way! There’s no time to waste!” Liu Mansha said.

Hence, everyone took a laptop each and started to check the documents.

Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha only needed to learn the basic computer operations.

The four of them did the same thing and quickly flipped through the documents.

Their eyes quickly swept across the computer screen, and then the mouse continued to roll down. Occasionally, there was the sound of the mouse clicking, which was the sound of closing old documents and opening new documents.
