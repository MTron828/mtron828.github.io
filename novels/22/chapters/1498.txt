Chapter 1499: Underground Palace_2

Translator: 549690339

“Song Wei, how are you?” Xia ruofei asked anxiously.

He heard Song Wei’s weak voice from his earpiece. “I’m fine ... I just bumped into something and felt my breath hurt ... Ruofei, what happened just now?”

When Xia ruofei thought of what had just happened, he felt a lingering fear.

He pretended to be relaxed and said,”it’s nothing. It’s all in the past!” Song Wei, the stone door is open, let’s get ready to go in!”

“You’re really fine?” Song Wei asked with concern,”why do I feel like you’re particularly tired?”

“I’m really fine!” Xia ruofei said,”I’m just a little exhausted ...”

Song Wei couldn’t understand. Xia ruofei was just standing there with his hands on the stone wall. How did he lose all his energy?

However, there were too many things that she could not understand tonight. For example, the mysterious and terrifying trap and kill array. She vaguely felt that this was a field that she had never understood before. Xia ruofei must know more than she did, so she did not get to the bottom of it and only nodded silently.

Xia ruofei was not stingy with the petals of the spirit Heart Flower. He took out two more petals from the spirit map and placed them in his palm.

With the protective gloves blocking her view, Song Wei naturally couldn’t see anything.

The true Qi in his body was recovering rapidly, and his dantian was full of vitality again.

Xia ruofei then took off his backpack and searched inside. He took out a bottle of mineral water and passed it to Song Wei. He smiled and said,”Have some water!”

This was naturally the spirit Heart Flower petal solution that he had taken out from the spirit map space. Furthermore, it was the kind with a rather high concentration.

Xia ruofei was filled with guilt when Song Wei was pushed out by the repulsive force and hit the stone wall so hard.

After the intense scene just now, Song Wei also felt her mouth was dry. She nodded and said,””Thank you ... It should be fine if I take off my gas mask now, right?” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei immediately took off his gas mask. At the same time, he released his vital energy around the two of them, forming an invisible protective shield.

“It shouldn’t be a problem for a short time,” he said.”I’m going to take it off for some fresh air!”

Song Wei couldn’t wait to take off her gas mask. Girls loved to look pretty. After putting on the gas mask, she looked like a pig’s head. If it wasn’t necessary, she wouldn’t be willing to wear it all the time!

Song Wei gulped down more than half of the bottle of water. The petals of the spirit Heart Flower naturally started to repair the places where she had been injured. Even her exhausted physical strength was slowly recovering.

Song Wei also felt that she had recovered a lot. She tidied her hair and smiled, “Let’s go in!”

Xia ruofei glanced at the stone door and nodded.””Good! Be careful and follow me closely!”

Song Wei was a little nervous, but at the same time, she nodded with anticipation,”Understood!”

Earlier on, Song Wei had already noticed the faint light coming from the stone door. However, she had focused all her attention on Xia ruofei. Now that the stone door was completely open, she immediately noticed the faint yellow light coming from the stone door.

The two of them looked in the direction of the stone gate. There seemed to be something vague, but they couldn’t see it clearly.

Xia ruofei had used a few petals of the spirit Heart Flower in a row. By now, he had recovered to his peak condition. He did not know if it was because he had overused his true energy just now, but he felt that his cultivation level had improved by a lot. It had not been long since he had broken through to Qi disciple Level 5. Under normal circumstances, he would need at least a few months to make a breakthrough.

However, just now, he had already faintly felt a bottleneck. It seemed that it would only be a matter of time before he broke through to Qi disciple Level 6.

Could it be that the extreme state is beneficial for the growth of cultivation? Xia ruofei said in his heart.

However, Xia ruofei did not want to experience the feeling of almost dying again. It was fine to try it under controlled circumstances.

Xia ruofei released his spiritual power to explore the area in front of him. At the same time, he released his genuine Qi to protect him and Song Wei. The two of them stepped up the steps and walked through the stone door.

After walking in, Xia ruofei realized that it was a six to seven – meter long tunnel. There were oil lamps on both sides of the tunnel, one meter apart from each other. They were giving off a dim yellow light.

“This ...” Xia ruofei and Song Wei were both shocked.

No one knew how long this underground Palace had existed. Even according to the experts ‘speculations, it was at least a building from the Ming Dynasty. The oil lamps on both sides of the corridor were still lit. Could it be that the lamp oil could not be used up?

And how could there be so many things to burn in this underground Palace?

“This is an eternal flame!” Song Wei said excitedly,”I didn’t expect the eternal flame to really exist!”

According to modern science, the eternal light was actually spontaneously ignited when the later generations opened the tomb, and the tomb would be extinguished due to the lack of oxygen when it was closed. However, the oil lamp in the corridor was obviously not the case.

Xia ruofei looked at the oil lamps and felt a strange feeling.

In fact, this underground Palace was full of strangeness, and he couldn’t help but be more vigilant.

“Let’s go in and take a look!” Xia ruofei said.

He reached out to hold Song Wei’s hand. In fact, Xia ruofei did this subconsciously when he felt danger. However, Song Wei’s heart was beating wildly. She glanced at Xia ruofei quickly but did not withdraw her hand.
