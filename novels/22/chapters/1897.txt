After hanging up the phone, Fang Chenchen sighed. When she returned to the dressing room, she said,””Sister Ling, be quick. I have something urgent to attend to later, so I have to go first ...”

“Alright!” The makeup room replied.

After removing her makeup, Fang Chenchen tidied herself up and hurriedly took the elevator down with her bag. She found her red beetle car in the underground parking lot of the TV station and quickly drove away in the direction of the West Lake Mansion.

Along the way, Fang Chenchen’s feelings were a little complicated. She hated herself for being vain, but at the same time, she kept telling herself that her current life was something she had never dared to imagine before. If she could endure it for another one or two years, she would be able to get a luxurious mansion in the West Lake Mansion.

The two voices kept clashing in her heart.

Fang Chenchen and Liu haojun’s meeting was a coincidence, but it was also inevitable.

A few months ago, Fang Chenchen was still a foreign reporter at the TV station. She was busy running around every news site and often had to work overtime to write scripts. Her life was very hard.

Not long after Liu haojun took office, Fang Chenchen came to Changping County for an interview. It was her first time meeting Liu haojun, who was representing the county at the event.

Her beautiful face and alluring figure made Liu haojun’s eyes light up, so she became the envy of many reporters. After the event ended, Qianqian got the opportunity to interview Liu haojun.

This encounter had completely changed the trajectory of Fang Chenchen’s life.

The two of them exchanged contact information, and Liu haojun had been contacting Fang Chenchen frequently since that day.

At first, Fang Chenchen did not think too much about it. Although she knew that Liu haojun was definitely interested in her, she did not show any signs of rejection. Even though she already had a family and a four – year – old child, she still wanted to change her life.

Of course, Fang Chenchen did not have the intention to betray her husband and family from the start. She wanted to maintain this ambiguous relationship and use Liu haojun’s influence to change her current situation.

However, if Liu haojun had his eyes on her, how could Fang Chenchen escape his grasp?

Fang Chenchen did not even dare to imagine that Liu haojun would do anything to achieve his goal.

She had taken her first step after a dinner three months ago.

That day, Liu haojun had organized a dinner party. Other than Fang Chenchen, the other people who attended were all from some of the powerful departments in the city and province. There was even a young division Chief who had come from the capital for a business trip.

That was also the first time Fang Chenchen had seen Liu haojun’s power. At the dinner, those higher – ranking leaders, including the division Chief of the capital’s Ministry, were very friendly to Liu haojun. They did not address him as “Secretary Liu” but “young master Liu” instead. Liu haojun was the center of attention.

From the conversations of those people, Fang Chenchen guessed for the first time that Liu haojun was from a big family in Beijing, which was the legendary “xxx party.”

That night, Liu haojun had repeatedly asked the higher – ups to toast Fang Chenchen, and she had drunk a little too much in no time.

After the meal, Liu haojun naturally took on the task of sending Chenchen home. Furthermore, he did not send Fang Chenchen home at all. Instead, he went straight to a five – Star hotel nearby and checked in.

Although Fang Chenchen had drunk a little too much, her mind was still relatively clear.

She knew very well what was going to happen next. When Liu haojun helped her into the room, she was a little hesitant, but when she thought of her plain and simple life and Liu haojun’s high – spirited look at the dinner, her last bit of hesitation disappeared.

Everything happened naturally under Fang Chenchen’s half – push and half – Agreement. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Liu haojun seemed to be particularly fond of wives like Fang Chenchen. That night, he had performed beyond his usual standards.

That was also the first time Fang Chenchen had stayed out all night. However, her honest husband was easy to fool. Just as the two of them were fighting, her husband even called to ask about it, but she dismissed him with a few words. She said that there was an urgent manuscript at the station and she might have to work overtime until very late, so she went straight to the office to sleep. Her husband even kept reminding her to rest and not tire herself out.

Liu haojun was already getting impatient. Fang Chenchen quickly dismissed her husband with a few words and hung up the phone. Otherwise, she was really worried that she would not be able to hold back and make that kind of sound.

The next morning, Liu haojun went straight to the point and laid out his conditions for Fang Chenchen, saying that he wanted to provide for her.

Liu haojun’s conditions made it impossible for Fang Chenchen to reject Qianqian’s 100000 Yuan monthly pocket money and a penthouse apartment in West Lake Mansion worth more than three million Yuan. Of course, the house was under Liu haojun’s name. He said that as long as Fang Chenchen accompanied him until he was transferred back to the capital, he would transfer the house under Fang Chenchen’s name before he left.

What made Fang Chenchen unable to refuse was that Liu haojun had also made it clear that as long as Fang Chenchen followed him, he would spare no effort in helping her in her career.

Fang Chenchen agreed without much hesitation.

Liu haojun’s promise was fulfilled very quickly. Other than the fact that the house was ready, she received 100000 Yuan in her account on the same day.

Moreover, as soon as she returned to the station, Fang Chenchen was informed that she had been transferred from the reporters ‘Department to a Festival Group to be a female anchor.

For Fang Chenchen, who used to be a broadcasting host, being a reporter was never a job she wanted. She enjoyed the feeling of being on the broadcasting platform more.
