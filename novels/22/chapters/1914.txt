Chapter 1915 Godly prediction (2)

In fact, when Liu Dong saw the photo sent through the multimedia message, he had already believed most of it. It was just that he subconsciously felt that it was hard to accept, so he kept giving himself psychological hints.

Liu Dong panted heavily. After a long while, he typed a line of words into WeChat with trembling hands,”Who the hell are you? What was his purpose?

“It doesn’t matter who I am,” replied “justice is not absent”. As for the purpose ... I just can’t stand to see an honest man being kept in the dark. He doesn’t even know that he’s being cheated on.

The word ‘green hat’ was like three sharp swords, stabbing into Liu Dong’s heart.

At this moment, justice is not absent sent another message.”I have more information and even videos, including the man’s identity. You can find the answer in the photos and videos.

When Liu Dong saw the message, he immediately gritted his teeth and replied,”How much do you want?

‘Justice is not absent’ sent a silly smile emoji with the following words: I’ve said it before, I’m just helping out when I see injustice, why would I want your money? If you want to know more, go to the night bar at 186 Chunfeng Road to find brother da.

Liu Dong’s eyes widened. Could it be Da Liu? He knew that the spring breeze road area was the territory where Da Liu hung out all year round. Although Da Liu had kept a much lower profile in the past few years and had a lot of legitimate business on the surface, he was still the boss of the spring breeze road area in reality. No one else dared to call themselves brother da there except him.

Liu Dong’s mind was already in a mess because of Fang Chenchen’s betrayal, and now that he knew that Liu Da had found out about it, he was even more troubled. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

If Fang Chenchen’s affair would make him suffer, then if Da Liu found out about it, it would be a fatal blow to his reputation.

Liu Dong and Liu Da both came from liujialing village, Xiaolou town, pingzhang County. They were considered relatives, and they were brothers three or four generations above them.

In the clan, the traditional view was still deeply rooted. If a man was betrayed by his own woman, then he would really be disgraced and would not have the face to see his ancestors. He would probably choose to end his own life.

Although Liu Dong was not as pedantic as the older generation, he definitely did not want this kind of thing to spread in his hometown. He could imagine that once this matter spread to Liu Jialing, his relatives would be disgraced along with him, and they would be criticized no matter where they went.

Liu Dong did not even dare to imagine that scene.

He typed a few words with trembling hands,”you are Da Liu?”

Ding dong! A WeChat notification rang out, and justice is not absent replied: Of course not. It’s just that only brother da can help you with this.

Seeing this, Liu Dong felt as if he had found a life – saving straw. He asked,”Did Liu Da know about this?

Justice is not absent immediately replied,”What do you think?

There was even a meaningful smiling emoji at the end.

Liu Dong almost fell to the ground. He reached out to hold the stove and steadied himself.

At this moment,’justice is not absent’ sent another message. You have half an hour. I won’t wait for you if you don ‘t.

After the message was sent, justice is not absent seemed to have disappeared. No matter what Liu Dong sent, there was no reply. Liu Dong also tried to contact the other party through the voice call function, but there was only the same ringtone, and no one picked up.

Liu Dong threw his phone aside dejectedly. At this time, his phone rang with a WeChat notification.

Liu Dong quickly unlocked his phone. It was still a message from justice. There were only a few words,”You still have 27 minutes.

Liu Dong snapped out of his daze. Without any hesitation, he took off his apron, stuffed his phone into his pocket, and strode out of the kitchen.

His four – year – old daughter, Mengmeng, was watching a cartoon in the living room. Liu Dong walked over and picked her up, saying softly,””Mengmeng, daddy has something urgent to attend to. I’ll drop you off at uncle Zheng’s house next door. Can you play with brother Qiang Qiang for a while?”

Mengmeng nodded and said,”alright!” But dad, you have to come back soon! I can’t sleep without you telling me stories ...”

Liu Dong almost burst into tears. He nodded and said,””I will! But if Mengmeng feels tired, you can sleep at uncle Zheng’s house for a while. Daddy will carry you home when he comes back ...”

“Mengmeng, wait for daddy ...” The little girl looked at her father and asked,”daddy, why are your eyes red?”

“I’m fine!” Liu Dong quickly turned his head and said,”I was in the kitchen just now because of the smoke!”

He carried Mengmeng out of the house quickly and came to the door of the house next door. He rang the doorbell and called,””Elder Zheng! Are you home, elder Zheng?”

Soon, the door was opened, and a man in his mid – thirties appeared. He was stunned when he saw Liu Dong,””Dongzi! Yo! Mengmeng is here too?”

“Hello, uncle Zheng!” Mengmeng said very sensibly.

“Hello, Mengmeng!” “You’re here at the right time,” Zheng said with a smile.”Your sister – in – Law made some dumplings today, come and have some with Mengmeng ...”

Zheng and Liu Dong were colleagues from the same unit. They had a good relationship. Later, they came to this building to look at houses together and bought two adjacent houses as neighbors. The two families often visited each other. Even when the house was renovated, they chose a similar style.

Liu Dong said,”old Zheng, I have something urgent to attend to. I need to go out. Chenchen ... She’s working overtime at the office. So ... I want to leave Mengmeng at your house first. Is that okay?”

“Why can’t I?” Elder Zheng smiled and said,”it’s good that you have a companion with our Qiang Qiang!”

Then, elder Zheng looked at Mengmeng with a smile and asked,””Right, Mengmeng? do you like to play with brother Qiang Qiang?”

“I like it!” The little girl said in a crisp voice.

“Look!” Elder Zheng smiled and said,”Mengmeng is at our house. Don’t worry!”

“Mm! Thank you, old Zheng!” Liu Dong said.

He then put Mengmeng down and said,””Mengmeng, quickly go in and play with brother Qiang Qiang! Remember to listen to uncle and aunty. Don’t be naughty, understand?”

“I know, dad!” Meng Meng said.

The little girl often came to the old Zheng family to play and was not shy with strangers. After changing her shoes, she happily went to play with her little friends.

“Dongzi, do you want to eat some dumplings before you leave?” elder Zheng stood at the door and asked.

“No, I really have an urgent matter!” Liu Dong said,”by the way, elder Zheng, Mengmeng hasn’t had dinner yet. I’ll have to trouble you and sister – in – Law!”

“Hey! What’s the trouble? your Mengmeng is so sensible. ” Said elder Zheng.

“Then I’ll be leaving!” Liu Dong said,”by the way ... If I come back too late, let Mengmeng sleep in your house first.”

“Alright! No problem!” Elder Zheng could tell that Liu Dong really had something urgent to attend to, so he said,”you should get back to your work! Mengmeng, don’t you worry!”

Liu Dong cupped his hands at Zheng and then quickly walked to the elevator.

……

In the old neighborhood opposite the West Lake Mansion.

A phone on the table rang. Xu Yougang picked up the phone and looked at the caller ID on the screen. He immediately answered the call.”Speak ... I understand. We’ll act according to the original plan!”

After he hung up, he turned to Zeng Liang and said,””It’s Aijun. He said that Liu Dong has already left. He took a taxi and is heading towards Chunfeng Road.”

“Boss, you’re really good at predicting things!” Zeng Liang said,”old Xu, what do you think boss’s brain is made of? How did he know that Liu Dong would call him after he received the first photo instead of calling his wife to question her? And why did she ask him to add her on WeChat instead of talking over the phone? I really don’t understand what’s going on here ...”
