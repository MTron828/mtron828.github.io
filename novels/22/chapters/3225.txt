3226 Breakthrough point (1)

“I see ...” Yu xiner was enlightened, but at the same time, she felt a little embarrassed.

“If that’s the case, then that Elon Musk is the key person,” Chen Xuan muttered.

“Of course!” Xia ruofei said,”he has absolute power in SpaceX! And he has the ability to help us accomplish this!”

“It seems that I have to start with this person.” Chen Xuan’s eyes lit up.

If a cultivator wanted to force an ordinary person to submit, he had countless methods. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Any one of them was enough to make an ordinary person suffer so much that they would rather die. Every second felt like hell. Even a Special Agent who had received professional anti – interrogation training would probably not be able to last long, let alone a super – rich man like Elon Musk.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”this is the only way ...”

Xia ruofei had an even more foolproof method, and that was the soul seal.

Wang Boshan had already been executed, and there was still a quota for the soul seal.

Xia ruofei could have used the soul seal on Elon Musk directly and turned him into a soul slave.

An ordinary person like Elon Musk would naturally not have any room for resistance. It could be said that he would definitely fall for it.

When that time came, Elon Musk would carry out any of Xia ruofei’s instructions without any hesitation. Naturally, it would not be a problem for the factory to produce all kinds of parts at full speed and finally assemble them into spacesuits.

However, Xia ruofei would not use this method so easily.

After all, he was just an ordinary person. No matter how rich he was, he could only be of limited help to Xia ruofei. It was not worth it to waste a soul seal slot because of this.

Xia ruofei wasn’t a cruel person. Otherwise, he would have killed the other party after using him. This way, he wouldn’t waste his soul seal. Or, he could try to strip away the soul seal. Although this might turn the soul slave into an idiot, at least he would be alive.

Under normal circumstances, Xia ruofei would not be willing to use such a method against ordinary people, including benilatti, who was still doing odd jobs on Peach Blossom Island. By right, he had lost his value long ago. To Xia ruofei, the most cost – effective way was to cut him down with one strike and empty the slot for the soul seal.

However, Xia ruofei knew that bainilatti was not evil and did not deserve to die. That was why he had kept him alive and did not even try to remove his soul seal.

Hence, Xia ruofei would not easily use the soul seal to deal with Elon Musk.

Li Yifu hesitated for a moment before saying,””Senior granduncle, in fact, Elon Musk suddenly left Silicon Valley yesterday ...”

“After you met him?” Xia ruofei asked.

“This has nothing to do with me ...” Li Yifu said with a bitter smile.”He must have some private affairs that are more urgent, so he postponed all his follow – up schedules and left Silicon Valley directly. Through some channels, this disciple is trying to understand the reason for Elon Musk’s hasty departure. ”

Elon Musk spent most of his time in Silicon Valley. Most of his industries were in Silicon Valley, including Tesla, SpaceX, and the Super battery factory.

Furthermore, during this period of time, because of the manned flight, Elon Musk’s schedule was very tight, and he had a lot of work to deal with every day.

For him to suddenly leave Silicon Valley at this time, it was obvious that he had encountered an emergency.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””Find out what he’s doing as soon as possible! We can’t delay this matter any longer. We have to hurry up and finish it. ”

“Understood!” Li Yifu said,”I’ve already asked people to speed up the investigation. I believe there will be news soon!”

Li Yifu’s phone rang just as he finished speaking.

He took a look at the caller ID and quickly said,””Senior granduncle, it’s the person this disciple sent to gather information ...”

“I’ll pick it up here!”

“Yes!” Li Yifu replied.

He picked up the phone, and his voice returned to its usual dignity.””Hello? Have you found out ... Don’t say too much over the phone, just come to the room and talk! I’m in room 1926!”

After Li Yifu hung up the phone, he said,””Senior granduncle, we have the latest news. I’m worried that mobile communication is not safe, so I asked him to come directly to the room to tell us!”

“Mm! It’s necessary to be cautious. ” Xia ruofei nodded.

Some special agencies in the United States were notorious, and all kinds of monitoring doors were frequently exposed. It was hard to say that the call was absolutely safe for a rich man like Li Yifu.

After a while, the doorbell rang.

Li Yifu got up to open the door. He looked at the people outside and said in English,””Come in and talk!”

Xia ruofei looked up and saw a white man in his forties following Li Yifu into the room with a respectful expression.

The white man’s figure was quite standard, at least not out of shape. However, his appearance was very ordinary, the kind that wouldn’t be easily found in a crowd. He had unkempt golden hair and a bag under his arm. He looked like an ordinary middle – aged man who was frustrated.

The white man did not expect there to be so many people in the room. When he saw Xia ruofei and the others, he could not help but hesitate.

“Mark, these are all friends I absolutely trust,” Li Yifu said indifferently.”You don’t have to worry. Just tell me what you found out!”
