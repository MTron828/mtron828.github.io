Chapter 810: Net abalone seedlings (1)

Translator: 549690339

Changping County had nearly one – third of Sanshan city’s coastline, and most of the abalone farming companies in the province were also located there.

Xia ruofei followed the information he had found on the internet and visited several farms, but he was not satisfied with them.

Most of the abalones produced in these farms were of low quality and the quality of their meat was not very good. Moreover, the breed of abalones they cultivated was the mixed – colored abalones from the southeast coast of China, which was obviously not in line with Xia ruofei’s high – Quality breed.

When it was close to dusk, Xia ruofei was ready to return to the farm after visiting the family.

To be honest, Xia ruofei didn’t have much hope. After all, he had noticed that the abalone cultivation in Changping County was very extensive. They took the general route, so it was not easy to buy high – Quality abalone fry.

However, when Xia ruofei entered the farm, he could not help but raise his eyebrows and show a hint of interest.

This farm was also built near the sea, but it didn’t have a floating platform on the sea surface like other farms. There were also no factories. Although the industrial cultivation took up a small area and produced high yield, the quality of the abalones produced was very poor.

At a glance, there were only a few small buoys on the nearby sea surface. There were also a few layers of isolation nets in the distance. A few small fishing boats were working on the sea surface, and it looked very peaceful.

Xia ruofei could tell at a glance that this farm was imitating the wild breeding method. He was immediately interested.

What Xia ruofei was concerned about now was the breed of abalones in this farm and whether they were selling abalones to the public.

Just as Xia ruofei was looking around with great interest, a young man walked over and asked,””Sir, is there anything I can help you with?”

“Oh! I’m here to take a look. ” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”is your boss here? I’d like to buy some abalones. ”

The dark – skinned young man grinned and extended his hand to Xia ruofei.””Hello, nice to meet you. My name is Tian Gang, the boss of this abalone farm. What’s your name, Sir?”

Xia ruofei looked at Tian Gang in surprise and said with a smile,””My surname is Xia. Mr. Tian, you look very young!”

“So it’s boss Xia, nice to meet you! I wonder what kind of abalone fry you want?” Tian Gang asked with a smile.

“To be honest with you, Mr. Tian, I visited a few farms today, but I wasn’t satisfied with them ...” Xia ruofei said.

Tian Gang pursed his lips and said,”boss Xia, I know a few farms nearby very well. Most of them use intensive cage cultivation. The taste of the abalones they raise is getting worse year by year. The price is also dropping. This kind of short – term success and profit – seeking practice has ruined the atmosphere of the entire industry ...”

“So, Mr. Tian’s farm is different from theirs?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“Of course!” Tian Gang said with some pride,”my breeding farm has always insisted on imitating wild breeding, even to the extent that it’s basically in a semi – Free State. Although the breeding cycle is long and the risk is relatively high, and we are likely to lose all our money once there is a Typhoon or other bad weather, the abalones cultivated this way are of the highest quality! It’s basically the same as a wild abalone in terms of taste. ”

Xia ruofei nodded approvingly and said,”Mr. Tian, I agree with your idea! You can’t follow the crowd in everything. Only by doing things to the extreme can you become the best in your industry!”

Tian Gang immediately felt a sense of regret for not meeting him earlier. He happily said,”It seems like great minds think alike!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Mr. Tian’s farm is indeed different from the others. I wonder what kind of abalone you have.” My requirements are quite high!”

“Boss Xia, you should have heard of the three big varieties of abalones, right?” Tian Gang said without hesitation. Although I personally don’t have a good impression of the Japanese, I have to admit that the Wei nation’s abalone is very good. They are recognized as the best abalone producer! The three varieties of abalones are all from the Wei nation, namely the net abalones, jibing abalones, and burlap abalones. The dried abalones used in high – end eateries in Hong Kong are almost all from the Wei nation. ”

“So, Mr. Tian, you’re bringing in one of the three most famous abalones in the world?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

Tian Gang proudly nodded and said,”My farm is full of net abalones and jibing abalones imported from Wei nation. If boss Xia wants to buy abalone fry ... I can also provide purebred net abalone seedlings here. The abalones I plant are specially imported from the Wei nation. They are pure – blooded and are all imitated wild breeding!”

Xia ruofei nodded in his heart.

His ideal breed of abalone was actually the net abalone. On one hand, the Hong Kong and Pacific Islanders loved this breed, so it would naturally be easier to sell in the future. On the other hand, among the three famous abalones, the number of heads of the net abalone was the least, and it was the easiest to raise two – headed abalones or even one – headed abalones.

“Mr. Tian, can I take a look at your net abalone seedlings first?” Xia ruofei asked after some thought.

“No problem!” Tian Gang smiled and said,”but we’re all imitating wild breeding in the coastal waters. If boss Xia wants to see it, you’ll have to take a fishing boat with me.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Alright!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”we can also visit Mr. Tian’s farm.”

Tian Gang enthusiastically led Xia ruofei along the path of the farm to the beach. There was a small dock there. Tian Gang called Xia ruofei over and they jumped onto a small fishing boat.

Tian Gang gestured to the fisherman, who immediately turned on the engine, and the small fishing boat sailed toward the cultivation area.

The breeding area was in the shallow waters and the entire area was surrounded by nets. The small fishing boat drove in from an opening and stopped at a buoy.

The two fishermen reached out and fumbled under the buoy for a while. Then, they worked together and carefully lifted a rope.

Only then did Xia ruofei realize that there was a small reef hanging from the rope. The surface of the reef was densely covered with abalone fry. These abalones were the same as the abalones that Xia ruofei had seen before, but they were only the size of a one – Yuan coin. There were many of them.

If someone with trypophobia saw this, they would definitely have goosebumps.

“Actually, this is a simulated reef that we made with cement,” said Tian Gang with a smile.”But after being placed at the bottom of the sea for a while, the surface is covered with a layer of seaweed, so it looks no different from a Real Reef.”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ve really learned something new!” If Mr. Tian hadn’t said it, I wouldn’t have known that it was fake! It’s simply passing off the fake as the real one!”

Tian Gang said,”boss Xia, it’s not easy to imitate wild breeding. I also specifically went to a large breeding farm in the Wei nation to get the information. The cost of our breeding method is extremely high. Moreover, it’s also very risky to breed it directly in the offshore area, so ...”

“As long as the quality of the abalones is good, the price is negotiable!” Xia ruofei smiled.

“Boss Xia, you’re so generous!” Tian Gang said happily, then pointed to the abalone fry on the simulated reef and said,”Mr. Xia, the abalones I grow here are from the Wei nation’s qianye County, which can be said to be the best quality abalones. Please take a look. The bottom of this abalone fry is wide and flat, and the shell is pure dark coffee color. After opening it, you can clearly see the bead – like bottom of the pillow. It’s definitely the most authentic thousand – leaf net abalone!”

Xia ruofei had always been inclined to bring in net abalones, so he had read a lot of information about the Wei nation’s net abalones on the internet yesterday. He knew that Tian Gang was not lying to him, and the quality of the net abalones here was indeed quite high.

After a moment of silence, Xia ruofei said,””Mr. Tian, your abalone fry is pretty good. I wonder how much it’s going to cost?”

Tian Gang thought for a moment and said,”an ordinary abalone fry is only one or two Yuan per seed. The cheaper ones are only a few cents. However, boss Xia, you also know that our net abalone seedlings are of high quality and high cost. So ...”

“Mr. Tian, you just have to give me the real price!” Xia ruofei smiled.

“Boss Xia, you’re so straightforward!” Tian Gang gave him a thumbs up and said. Then I won’t beat around the bush. When I sold these net abalone seedlings to the outside world, it was 3.80 yuan per grain. Since I’ve met boss Xia for the first time and he’s so forthright, I’ll just take it as 3.50 yuan per grain!”

Xia ruofei had learned the relevant information before. Tian Gang’s price was indeed more expensive than the average price on the market. However, considering the quality of the abalone seedlings, Xia ruofei felt that it was still acceptable.

Of course, if it was an ordinary farmer who wanted to bring in the seedlings, he would have to consider it. However, Xia ruofei had no concerns at all. These abalone seedlings were cultivated in the space sea and there was no need to worry about any risks. Furthermore, it could be predicted that they would grow better than in the best water in the outside world. In the future, one abalone could earn back the money of all the abalone seedlings. Hence, Xia ruofei did not care about the slight difference in price.

“No problem!” Xia ruofei asked,”Mr. Tian, how many abalone seedlings of this quality do you have?”

Tian Gang’s eyes couldn’t help but light up when he heard that. It seemed that he was a big customer!

He quickly said,”I just sold a batch a few days ago. I estimate that there should be about 11000 more. Boss Xia, how many do you need?”

“If they’re all of the same quality, I’ll take them all!” Xia ruofei smiled.

“Don’t worry about that, boss Xia!”Tian Gang happily replied. The quality of my abalone fry is the same, so the farmers on Heron Island are specifically looking for me to purchase them!”

“Alright, Mr. Tian, I hope to get the goods as soon as possible!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“I’ll get the workers to work overtime tonight. The abalone fry will be ready by noon tomorrow at the latest!” Tian Gang said without any hesitation.

Xia ruofei nodded.”Okay. I’ll come over tomorrow around 11:30.”

After the two of them returned to the shore, Xia ruofei paid the deposit of 5000 Yuan according to the rules.

After Tian Gang gave Xia ruofei a receipt, he warmly invited Xia ruofei to stay for dinner. However, Xia ruofei politely declined. After taking the receipt, she bid farewell to Tian Gang and drove away from the abalone farm.
