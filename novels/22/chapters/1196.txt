Chapter 1197: Earning a hundred million in two minutes (2)

Translator: 549690339

Huge profits! It was definitely a huge profit!

This was even faster than robbing a bank!

That’s why they say women’s money is easy to earn. Otherwise, how could all those cosmetic companies, big and small, earn so much money? After Xia ruofei had experienced it for himself, he finally felt the madness.

Of course, other cosmetic companies definitely did not have such a high profit rate like paradise Corporation.

Seeing that Xia ruofei was in a daze, Feng Rao gently pulled on his sleeve.

Only then did Xia ruofei snap out of his daze. He understood what Feng Jing meant and immediately announced loudly,””Dear colleagues, I have a piece of good news to report to you. During the launch of our new product, the jaded skin cream, our sales broke through 100 million Yuan in two minutes!”

The office was suddenly filled with cheers and applause.

Xia ruofei waited for the noise to die down before continuing with a smile,””And this is only because we’ve implemented a purchase restriction. If we open up the market for purchase, this number will increase by a large margin, or even several times!”

“Alright! Everyone’s mission has just begun!” Xia ruofei said,”the biggest test is yet to come. Whether we can handle so many orders in time and deliver the products to the customers as soon as possible will depend on everyone! My fellow colleagues, you’ve all worked hard! After this, I’ll treat everyone to a meal and give everyone red packets!”

“Boss, can I change it to travel benefits?”

Xia ruofei replied without hesitation,”sure!” Any travel expenses within 20000 Yuan will be covered by the company. However, we have to leave in batches ...”

After earning so much money in one go, Xia ruofei was naturally not stingy and generously promised generous benefits.

“Yay! Long live the boss!”

“Alright, alright. Everyone, get into position!” Feng Rao clapped her hands. I’m working overtime today to settle the order!”

Everyone in the office got busy. Some were doing some confirmation work in the background, some were contacting the logistics company, and some were sending the order data.

In the warehouse area of the pharmaceutical factory, many people were also busy printing orders, packing products, and so on. The logistics trucks of SF Express, which had been waiting in advance, also moved quickly. Everyone was united, so the efficiency was naturally quite high. The local buyers would receive the goods as soon as this evening.

Xia ruofei and Feng Jing walked out of the office.

Feng Jing grumbled with a smile,”Chairman, you’re too generous. You gave out 20000 per person in a single sentence. There are dozens of people participating in this ‘battle’!”

“The company is making money, what’s wrong with giving everyone some benefits?” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“The money hasn’t been transferred to my account yet!” Feng Jing said,”these e – commerce platforms all have a payment cycle. Besides ... We haven’t even settled on our building in the city yet! Don’t spend so much money next time ...”

Xia ruofei accepted her advice and smiled.””Alright, alright, alright! I’ll be more careful next time!”

In the next few days, everyone in paradise Corporation was in a state of excitement and business.

After all the orders were settled, everyone heaved a sigh of relief.

However, Feng Jing couldn’t rest. It wasn’t normal to mobilize people from various departments to fight the fire, so her top priority was to recruit people.

Fortunately, the customer service, after – Sales, and warehouse management of the e – commerce platform were not too professional. The academic requirements were not very high. As long as a person with a normal IQ had been trained for a period of time, they could basically do the job.

However, as the number of employees in the company increased, the relocation of the headquarters naturally became more and more urgent. The office space at the misty Paradise Farm was limited, and it was impossible to move all the recruited people to the suburbs. Food and lodging were a problem for these people.

Hence, while Feng Jing was handling recruitment matters, she would often find time to visit the city, hoping to find a suitable location, preferably a building, to prepare for the relocation of the headquarters.

Of all the orders, there were definitely cases of late payments and customers not wanting to return the goods after receiving them. However, these cases were extremely rare among the total of more than 50000 orders, so the sales figure had undoubtedly exceeded 100 million Yuan.

A few days later, the e – commerce platform’s payment was gradually transferred to the peach blossom company’s accounts.

The company that received the money the fastest was naturally the jingbei group. On one hand, with their relationship with Zheng bang, the money would have to be paid sooner or later, so Liu Dong was naturally willing to do them a favor. On the other hand, kyokuboku group’s logistics level was also the highest, which meant that the order completion was the most timely, and the money would be transferred the fastest.

A few days after jingbei group’s 20 million Yuan payment was received, the other four e – commerce platforms also gradually returned the money.

It was also the first time that paradise corporation’s account had such a large amount of cash flow.

One day, Xia ruofei had just arrived at his office when Feng Jing quickly entered with the financial statements.

She smiled and said,”Chairman, the payment from the five e – commerce platforms has all been transferred to our accounts. After deducting the channel fees, our net income has reached about 102 million!” This is the detailed report, take a look!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and laughed.””I only need to know the numbers. I won’t look at the specific reports!”

Feng Jing didn’t force him. She kept the report and said seriously,””Chairman, we can’t wait any longer for the relocation of our headquarters. It must be completed as soon as possible. So ... You can’t embezzle this 100 million Yuan to other places!”

Xia ruofei laughed.”I was wondering why you were so enthusiastic. You even personally sent the report over. It turns out that you were waiting for me here!”

Feng Rao blushed and said,””I’m doing this for the company!”

One must know that Xia ruofei had a ‘previous record’. Last time, he had earned nearly 200 million Yuan with great difficulty, but before he could even keep it, Xia ruofei had used it to buy a courtyard house.

Feng Jing didn’t want something like this to happen again. If she didn’t have enough funds to move the headquarters, she would really go crazy.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”Okay, okay, okay!” I promise I won’t use this money! If you don’t have enough funds for the relocation of the headquarters, you can come to me again!”

“That’s more like it. You’re like a boss ...” Feng Jing chuckled.

“I’ve never been a qualified boss!” Xia ruofei said with a sad expression on purpose.

“You only just found out!” Feng Rao chuckled.

The two of them joked for a while before Xia ruofei asked,””How’s the production at the pharmaceutical factory?”

“It’s very smooth! We’ve already hoarded a lot of goods!” Feng Rao laughed.”The jaded skin cream is so profitable that Xue Jinshan can’t wait to use all the production lines to produce it!”

Xia ruofei said seriously,”that won’t do!” The heart nourishing soup project was no less important than the jaded skin cream! Besides, this is a good thing to do. We can’t just focus on making money ...”

“He was just joking!” Feng Jing smiled and said,”Xue Jinshan has always been in charge of the heart – nourishing soup project. He has feelings for this project. How could he not care about it?”

“I knew it!” Xia ruofei also smiled and asked,”have you set the release date for the next batch of goods?”

“I’m pretty much sure, probably in half a month!”Feng Rao replied immediately. Our first batch of goods has been delivered to the consumers. Most of them will definitely use it at the first moment. The effect of the jaded skin cream is beyond doubt. It will definitely cause another wave of craze! We’re planning to hold it down for now and wait for half a month before we open it for purchase. By then, the sales will definitely be quite hot!”

Xia ruofei smiled and pointed at Feng Rao.””It seems like you’ve grasped the essence of hunger marketing! Alright, we’ll do it according to your plan!”

“Yes, Chairman!” Feng Jing stood up and left Xia ruofei’s office.

In another half a month, the jaded skin cream would usher in the second round of sales. It was still 50000 copies, but this time, there was no limited edition skin code series. The rarer something was, the more expensive it was. Only 100 bottles of this limited edition skin code series were sold in China a year. It was impossible to sell a year’s quota in two or three times! They would definitely have to keep it for the event and sell a small amount. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Even without the 30 bottles of limited – edition jaded skin cream, the sales of 50000 square meters of jaded skin cream would be at least tens of millions.

Although the second round of sales was important, Xia ruofei could not attend it personally. He had more important things to do and had to leave the three mountains for a while. He estimated that the second round of sales would have ended by the time he returned.

Just as everyone was busy preparing for the second round of sales, Xia ruofei had already arrived at Sanshan airport in the Knight XV SUV driven by ye Lingyun, dragging a small suitcase.
