Chapter 1230: Old child (1)

Translator: 549690339

Although Xia ruofei had already estimated that the benefits would be very considerable when he decided to cultivate the aweto, the data he obtained after the harvest today still made him feel a little dizzy.

Even now that the Paradise Corporation had entered the fast track of development, and the Taoyuan vegetables and Jade skin cream could reap a large amount of profits, the huge profits from Cordyceps sinensis still surprised Xia ruofei. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Xia Qing, quickly harvest all the aweto.” Xia ruofei said with a hint of excitement,”I’m going to expand the cultivation garden as soon as possible.”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing said,”I’ll go and continue digging for worm grass!”

“Wait!” Xia ruofei stopped Xia Qing.”Pick out 500 grams of wormgrass and wrap it in a gift box. I’ll use it these two days.”

“Understood!” Xia Qing said calmly.

During the day, Xia ruofei was still hesitating about what gift to give MA Xiong. After all, he was in someone else’s territory and it would not be good to go empty – handed. This batch of wormgrass was like a timely rain. The wormgrass itself was a precious herb with higher nutritional content than ginseng. It could enhance the body’s immunity and nourish the lungs and kidneys. For the elderly, this gift was perfect.

After giving Xia Qing a few more instructions, Xia ruofei left the space and returned to the outside world.

It was already past 10 at night. Since he had to fly to Hong Kong the next day, Xia ruofei took a shower and went to bed.

The next morning, Xue Ming, the manager of Hengfeng group’s San Shan office, personally brought a car to Taoyuan farm and sent Xia ruofei to the airport.

This time, MA Xiong had sent a private jet to pick Xia ruofei up.

Just like the top – grade abalone auction, Xia ruofei had to bring 90 kilograms of precious truffles. It was not convenient to take a civilian flight. In MA Xiong’s opinion, it was not safe either. Hence, he insisted on sending a plane to pick him up. Xia ruofei could not reject him and could only agree helplessly.

Xia ruofei and Xue Ming were old acquaintances. They exchanged a few words before Xue Ming personally placed the three boxes that Xia ruofei had prepared into the trunk of the Mercedes – Benz.

When they arrived at the airport, Xue Ming carried the precious truffles onto the plane. After he had settled down, he respectfully said goodbye to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei had been in MA Xiong’s Gulfstream G650 private plane many times. MA Xiong had even sent a plane to pick him up several times, so the flight crew was very familiar with Xia ruofei.

They were also very respectful to Xia ruofei because they knew that this young man had an extraordinary relationship with their Big Boss. Besides, Xia ruofei did not put on airs. He was very gentle to everyone, which made the crew members have a good impression of him.

The flight from San Shan to Hong Kong was very short. However, in the short two hours, Xia ruofei still enjoyed the best service.

Other than MA Xiong’s collection of fine wine, there was even a professional chef who was cooking for Xia ruofei on the plane.

The Gulfstream G650’s cruising altitude was higher than that of the general civil aircraft. This altitude level was more stable. Except for slight bumps during the take – off and landing, the rest of the time was quite stable.

Xia ruofei had basically enjoyed a French feast in the sky before landing in Hong Kong’s airport.

Ma Zhiming and Feng Jing went to the airport to pick them up. After exchanging a few pleasantries, they got on the car and returned to the Hengfeng Jiahua Hotel in Hong Kong.

As expected, the MA family had arranged for Xia ruofei to stay in the only Presidential Suite in Hengfeng Jiahua.

Xia ruofei knew that he couldn’t refuse. MA Xiong would definitely not agree to it, so he had no choice but to accept it.

MA Xiong had invited many upper – Class celebrities to this auction. Many of them were from Europe and America. The only Presidential Suite was reserved for Xia ruofei. It was clear that MA Xiong valued him.

Xia ruofei had just placed the three boxes of truffles into the specially prepared cold cabinet when MA Xiong brought Tian Huixin and Huan Huan to his room.

“Brother RUO Fei!” Huan Huan wriggled out of Tian Huixin’s arms and quickly pounced on Xia ruofei.

“Little Huanhuan!” A warm smile appeared on Xia ruofei’s face. He lifted Huanhuan up and kissed her on her tender little face. He said,”long time no see. Huanhuan has grown so much taller!”

“Yeah!” Huan Huan said proudly. That’s because Huanhuan has been very obedient during her meals!”

“Hmm, not bad!” Xia ruofei complimented them. He then carried Huanhuan and greeted MA Xiong and Tian Huixin.”Old master Ma, aunt Tian, nice to meet you!”

“Xia Sheng, you’ve had a hard journey!” MA Xiong said with a smile.

They all knew that Huanhuan and Xia ruofei were very close. She had always been very clingy to Xia ruofei, so they did not let Huanhuan get off Xia ruofei’s arms.

If it was any other guest, it would be a little impolite. However, the MA family treated Xia ruofei as one of their own, so it didn’t matter.

“Everyone, please take a seat!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”President Feng, I have some tea leaves in my bag that I brought from home. Could you please make some for everyone?”

“Alright,” he said. Feng Rao replied.

“Xiasheng, there’s no hurry to drink tea. I came here today to take a look!” MA Xiong quickly said.

Although he had already known the specific data of this batch of truffles many days ago and knew that Xia ruofei would not give an empty promise, as a glutton who loved truffles, he could not help but want to see what the giant truffle that was more than 5 catties was like. However, Xia ruofei did not put the giant white truffle that was nearly 6 catties on the auction.
