Section Chief li didn’t notice the change in Feng Rao’s expression. He continued to smile and said,”Miss Feng, a smart and beautiful woman like you should know how to make use of your advantages! The moment I saw you, I was sure that the balance power building definitely belongs to your paradise Corporation, because your company has a beautiful President!”

“Section Chief li, this is a bit too much!” Feng Jing said,”I’m not an easy woman ...”

“We’re all here to mingle around in the pugilistic world, so why pretend to be virtuous?” Section Chief Li’s smile disappeared as he said,”miss Feng, as long as you agree to my request, I can be more lenient with the first condition. If you don’t agree, then there’s no need to talk about this. It’s useless even if you give me two or three million!”

Then, Section Chief Li’s tone softened a little and he continued,””Miss Feng, I’m sure you know that if I don’t agree, your company won’t even have the right to compete ... What do you think? Just think about it! I’m still going to say the same thing – a wise man submits to circumstances!”

Feng Rao had already gotten everything she wanted, and she felt disgusted by Section Chief li. She didn’t want to pretend to be nice anymore.

Her expression turned cold as she stood up and said, “I’m sorry, Section Chief Li, I can’t agree to your conditions! Goodbye ...”

Section Chief li was taken aback. He didn’t expect Feng Jing to be so decisive. The feeling of having everything under control disappeared.

Division Chief li originally felt that Feng Jing was becoming more and more helpless under his gradual pressure. He was already close to breaking through her psychological defenses, so what happened next should be a matter of time.

All of this was beyond his expectations.

Seeing that Feng Jing was already walking out, Section Chief li panicked. He suddenly realized a very scary possibility.

He quickly stepped forward to block Feng Rao’s path and said,””Miss Feng, you’re leaving just like that? are you not going to give us face?”

“Section Chief Li’s conditions are too harsh. We can’t continue the discussion. What am I staying for?” Feng ke said. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Her voice was very calm because she knew that Xia ruofei would be by her side to protect her. She did not have to be afraid of anything.

“Miss Feng, you can leave if you want to. I never force anyone to do so, but ... I need to check if you’re carrying any unfriendly trinkets on you and in your bag ...” Section Chief li sneered.

“Section Chief li, don’t go too far!” Feng Rao’s expression changed slightly as she said,”you have no right to restrict my freedom, much less search me! This is illegal!”

“I know more about the law than miss Feng ...” Chief li curled his lips and said,”but I sincerely asked you to come here to talk, but you don’t seem to be very kind!” If that’s the case, then don’t blame me for being impolite ...”

Section Chief li was almost certain of the reason behind Feng Jing’s abnormal behavior tonight. He was both shocked and angry. He knew that he had been careless. Feng Jing might have recorded something that could be used against him.

The only thing that comforted him was that this was Shixin hotel, so he still had a chance to turn things around. Feng Jing hadn’t left yet, so as long as he got his hands on her and destroyed her, he would be invincible.

As for whether he would continue to control the Paradise Corporation or simply kick them out, it would depend on his mood.

With that thought in mind, a sinister look flashed across Division Chief Li’s eyes. He grabbed Feng Jing’s bag strap and pulled hard, trying to snatch her bag.

Feng Rao couldn’t help but scream as she tried her best to fight with Section Chief li.

At this moment, a loud bang came from the balcony, followed by the sound of glass shattering and falling to the ground. A figure rushed in from the balcony.

Section Chief li only felt a blur in front of his eyes. He didn’t see the person clearly at all. He didn’t even have a subconscious reaction before he felt a pain in his shoulder joint, and then his entire arm drooped down ...
