Chapter 684: Effective after one course of treatment (1)

Song Rui smiled and said,”uncle Zhao, I really didn’t mean to trample on your old Maotai!” RUO Fei had created a wine some time ago called the Drunken Eight Immortals. The fragrance and taste ... How should he put it? It made people unable to forget it after drinking it once! This wine is already quite famous in the South, but it probably hasn’t spread to the North of the Yellow River yet!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”I saw it yesterday at the Beijing office of the three mountains. It must have been sent directly from the southeast province.”

“Oh, really? Then I’ll have to find time to go to the Rong city hotel and get two bottles of wine to drink!” Song Rui said in surprise.

The conversation between Xia ruofei and song Rui made Zhao Cheng even more interested in drunken eight immortal. He couldn’t help but ask,””Doctor Xia, this Drunken Eight Immortals wine ... Hehe ... Can you get me two bottles and let me try it?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”general Zhao, I didn’t bring Drunken Eight Immortals with me to the capital.” Just wait for me to return to the three mountains! I’ll get the winery to send you a few bottles. Our production capacity hasn’t come up yet, so please don’t think it’s too little!”

“I won ‘t, I won’ T. I’m just trying the taste!” “It’s a deal then!” Zhao Cheng said happily.

“It’s a deal!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Why don’t I get someone to get a few bottles from the Rong city hotel and send them over now?” Song Rui said with some eagerness.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but roll his eyes.”Come on! Are you that addicted to alcohol? Didn’t you hear me say that there was also the Drunken Eight Immortals in the capital? I didn’t see you unable to survive! Alright, alright, don’t torment yourself anymore. Let’s drink! This Maotai is not bad!”

Xia ruofei took the initiative to raise his glass and toast Zhao Cheng.

After lunch, Xia ruofei said,””General Zhao, you’ve just taken the medicine. You can skip the medicine for this afternoon. You can take the second one after dinner.”

“Doctor Xia, you have the final say in the treatment. I will definitely obey and cooperate!” Zhao Cheng quickly said.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”okay, then let’s take a break in the afternoon if you have nothing to do!” When it’s about time, I’ll go to the pharmacy to brew the medicine. ”

......

“No problem!”

“Ruofei, I’ll leave uncle Zhao to you. I won’t stay here to accompany you,” song Rui said as he walked over.

“Go and do your work! I’m here, so you don’t have to worry!” Xia ruofei said.

“Yes, I’ll be done with my business in Beijing in a day or two. I’ll return to Sanshan city then. See you at Sanshan!” Song Rui patted Xia ruofei’s shoulder and said.

“As long as you don’t keep thinking about my cigarettes, my wine, and the vegetables, fruits, and flowers on my farm, Tao Yuan farm still welcomes you.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Song Rui rolled his eyes and said,”I’ve never seen such a petty person like you!” You’ve been telling me to smoke a few packs of your cigarettes for so long ...”

Xia ruofei raised his head and laughed, not feeling ashamed at all.

After sending song Rui off, Xia ruofei bade Zhao Cheng goodbye and went back to his room to rest.

Although it was not convenient for Xia ruofei to take out the spirit scroll in Zhao city, as the master of the spirit map world, Xia ruofei could still communicate with the spiritual puppet Xia Qing in the space even if he was in the outside world.

Xia Qing already knew that her master had found a clue to a world stone in the outside world, so she was very happy for Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei specifically asked Xia Qing if she would be affected when absorbing world stones in the spirit map world and if she needed to make any special preparations.

Xia Qing expressed that it didn’t affect her at all and that as long as Xia ruofei obtained the world stone, he could send it in at any time.

Xia ruofei was relieved when he heard this and did not continue to talk about this matter. Instead, he let Xia Qing wait patiently while he withdrew his mind from the spirit map space.

At around five in the evening, Xia ruofei got up and went to the pharmacy on the first floor. He skillfully found the herbs he needed and began to boil the medicine for Zhao Cheng’s evening drink.

As Xia ruofei lived here and there were many Chinese medicinal herbs here, Xia ruofei only made one portion each time and drank it on the spot.

Although it was a little more troublesome, the quality of the medicinal soup was better.

After preparing the Chinese medicine, Xia ruofei asked someone to feed it to Zhao Cheng. Actually, the main ingredient in the medicine was still the petals of the spirit Heart Flower, so it did not matter if he took it before or after the meal.

Soon, it was time for dinner. Zhao Cheng ate with Xia ruofei personally, with Colonel Jin Feng accompanying them.

After dinner, Xia ruofei went back to his room.

For the next few days, Xia ruofei had been living a secluded life.

Every morning, he would brew some medicine and practice martial arts in the spacious Chinese medicine room. After brewing the medicine, he would give it to Zhao Cheng and everyone would have breakfast together.

It was the same at noon and at night. Xia ruofei would always come to the first floor one or two hours earlier to prepare the Chinese medicine. Zhao Cheng would rest for a while after drinking the medicine and then eat.

Other than boiling medicine, Xia ruofei spent most of his time in his room, reading books, surfing the internet, and sometimes talking on the phone with Ling Qingxue.

If song Rui were to live such a life, he would probably be suffocated in a few days. However, Xia ruofei did not feel any discomfort.

……

In the blink of an eye, six days had passed.

Although Zhao Cheng and Xia ruofei talked and laughed every day, he was actually under a lot of pressure.

Just a few days after he was diagnosed, a leader from the headquarters had already spoken to him, intending to adjust his position. To put it bluntly, he wanted to weaken his authority and transfer him from a frontline commander position to some insignificant and idle positions.
