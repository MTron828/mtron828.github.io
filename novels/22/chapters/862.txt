Chapter 863: Lin Qiao’s troubles (1)

Translator: 549690339

“Mr. Xia,” song Qiming quickly said,”you can call me if you need anything in the future. This is my personal number.”

Then, song Qiming leaned over and handed Xia ruofei a business card.

It was an ordinary business card in an elegant beige color, and it even exuded a faint fragrance. There was only the name “song Qiming” on the card, and a mobile number below it.

There were no titles printed on the business card to show song Qiming’s status. There was no need to add a series of titles on the business card to highlight his status. Moreover, leaders of his level basically did not use business cards anymore. They were obviously prepared for personal friends.

Xia ruofei looked at the name card politely and kept it carefully. He smiled and said,””Thank you, Secretary song! I’ll have to trouble you in the future. ”

Song Qiming laughed.”Mr. Xia, you started a business to support our economic development. As the Secretary of the municipal government, I should be protecting our economic development!”

Although song Qiming had just gotten off the plane and did not know Xia ruofei at all, the fact that Xia ruofei was able to appear at elder song’s dinner and was personally introduced to him by elder song showed how important Xia ruofei was to elder song.

Xia ruofei also took out his name card and passed it to song Qiming. He smiled and said,””Secretary song, you can just call me Xiao Xia!”

“Alright, little Xia. We’ll all be at the three mountains in the future. We can get to know each other more!” Song Qiming said kindly.

After song Qiming arrived, Tian Huilan did not mention Lu You again. Instead, she talked more about the situation in Sanshan city with song Qiming.

After all, one was the relinquished Secretary and the other was his successor. Song Qiming had lowered his attitude and was completely asking for advice.

Tian Huilan didn’t keep anything to herself. She told song Qiming about her many years of experience in power at the three mountains, and she also emphasized the few tasks she had pushed forward during her time as the leader.

On the one hand, Tian Huilan wanted to help song Qiming get into the situation as soon as possible. On the other hand, she hoped that the work she had worked hard to promote could have a certain degree of continuity. She did not want it to be completely rejected just because of a new leader.

Of course, they were all comrades with the same political view, so the possibility of such a situation happening was very low.

They were all talking about high – Level topics, but Xia ruofei was not afraid. Occasionally, he would join in the conversation, and the atmosphere of the dinner was quite good.

After the meal, Xia ruofei and Tian Huilan bade their farewells. They knew that song Qiming had just taken over and elder song would definitely want to talk to him.

This was the real reason why elder song had asked song Qiming to rush to the three mountains overnight.

Elder song didn’t ask them to stay. He bade Xia ruofei and Tian Huilan farewell with a smile and told manager Lu to send them off. Then, he asked song Qiming to follow him to the study.

Manager Lu sent Xia ruofei and Tian Huilan downstairs. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Xiao Xia,” Tian Huilan suddenly said,”you drank quite a bit just now. You definitely can’t drive. Why don’t you take my car?”

Xia ruofei’s expression froze and he was in a difficult position.

“That’s good, safety first!”Manager Lu said with a smile. Besides, it’s not safe to drive on the mountain road so late at night. Xiao Xia, leave your car keys behind. I’ll have the staff send your car to the farm tomorrow morning!”

Since manager Lu had said so, Xia ruofei had no reason to refuse. He could only smile bitterly in his heart and nod.””Secretary Tian, I’ll have to trouble you then!”

Tian Huilan stroked her hair and said with a smile, “It’s no trouble at all. This place is closer to your farm. I’ll get the driver to send you first!”

“How can I do that?” Xia ruofei quickly said,”I’ll send you off first!”

“Wouldn’t that be a waste of gasoline? It’s decided, I’ll send you off first!” Tian Huilan said.

At this moment, Tian Huilan’s driver came over in her Audi. The driver jogged over to open the door.

After Tian Huilan got into the car, Xia ruofei also got into the car from the other side.

“Old Li, send little Xia back to the farm first!” Tian Huilan said.

“Alright, Secretary Tian!” The driver, old Li, started the car steadily and said without looking sideways.

The driver, old Li, had been to Taoyuan farm before, so he did not need Xia ruofei’s directions.

The car left guling courtyard very quickly. It was very quiet in the car. Xia ruofei felt a little uneasy. He didn’t know why, but he was a little worried that Tian Huilan would mention Lu You.

However, when the car drove onto the mountain road, Tian Huilan still didn’t say anything. She just leaned back in her seat and closed her eyes slightly.

Just as Xia ruofei heaved a sigh of relief, Tian Huilan suddenly said,””Xiao Xia, Secretary Qiming is elder song’s distant grandnephew. Elder song personally introduced you to him today. He will definitely value you greatly. If you have any problems in the future, you can look for him directly. As long as it doesn’t go against his principles, he will do his best to help you.”

“I understand, Secretary Tian!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”Secretary song is elder song’s grandnephew?” His age ...”

“It’s a distant relative, but it hasn’t been released yet!”Tian Huilan smiled. That’s why Secretary Qiming always calls elder song ‘chief’. According to the backup, he should be called granduncle. ”

“I see ...” Xia ruofei said with understanding.

He thought to himself,’this Secretary song doesn’t look young, but he’s actually song Rui’s clan brother. That kid’s seniority is quite high!’
