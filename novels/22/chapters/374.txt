Chapter 375: Powerful medicinal effect (1)

Xia ruofei immediately took out the preservation box that stored the petals of the spirit Heart Flower from the original space. Five petals were produced every three days. At this stage, the production was greater than the consumption. Hence, there were more and more petals of the spirit Heart Flower in the box during this period of time. There were already more than 30 petals.

Xia ruofei used a pair of tweezers to pick up one of the pieces and put it in his palm. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The petals of the spirit Heart Flower instantly melted and seeped into Xia ruofei’s skin.

The warm current appeared. Xia ruofei had long gotten used to this feeling. He picked up the water bottle beside him and took a few big gulps of the spiritual pond water. Then, he sat down on the recliner beside the spiritual pond and began to read the booklet leisurely.

It was only one page, and Xia ruofei had memorized the contents.

Previously, for the convenience of ‘practicing medicine’, Xia ruofei had bought many common Chinese medicine and stored them in the space. He also had all kinds of tools for decocting medicine.

Xia ruofei got up and went to a wooden shelf that was specially bought to store Chinese medicine. After checking, he realized that the Chinese medicine needed to make the body tempering soup could be found here.

He was waiting to recover his mental power. Since he had nothing to do, he decided to follow the method in the booklet and try to make a body tempering soup.

Xia ruofei took the clay pot and skillfully followed the prescription. He put the required herbs into the clay pot according to their respective quantities. Then, he added a petal of the spirit Heart Flower and fetched the spatial spirit pool water. He started a fire to boil the medicine.

A medicinal fragrance gradually filled the space.

Under the slow boiling of the fire, the water in the claypot became less and less. Xia ruofei began to boil the body tempering soup according to the prescription.

Xia ruofei was already very familiar with the method of brewing the medicine. However, the method described on the Golden page was a little complicated. For example, he had to add a few herbs in the beginning, add two more herbs before boiling the medicine for the first time, then turn off the fire to cool it down. When the temperature of the medicine dropped, he had to add another herb, and finally, he had to grind the last herb into powder. After the medicine was boiled and the dregs were removed, he had to add it into the medicine and stir it evenly.

Xia ruofei did not know what was going on, but he only needed to know the way. He did not need to know why. He just had to follow the procedures strictly.

After half an hour, Xia ruofei had made a body tempering soup for the first time.

Whether it was the color, smell, or taste of the medicinal soup, it was no different from what the prescription said. As for whether it could achieve the effect of the prescription, it would only be known after trying it.

The prescription said that after the body tempering soup was boiled, it should be taken immediately after it had cooled down.

Xia ruofei waited for a few minutes before he picked up the bowl and finished it in one gulp.

Although it was still a little hot, it was not unbearable.

This medicinal soup seemed to be less bitter than ordinary Chinese medicine when it entered his mouth. It had more medicinal fragrance and tasted quite good.

As soon as the medicinal soup entered his stomach, a familiar warm current gushed out. It was much stronger than when Xia ruofei used an entire petal of the spirit Heart Flower.

Xia ruofei was caught off guard. His face turned red and he felt like his body was on fire.

Xia ruofei’s skin turned red all of a sudden. It was as if his entire body had swelled up. Every inch of his skin was burning as if it was on fire. All the pores on his body felt as if they were being pricked by needles.

He didn’t expect the medicinal properties of this body tempering soup to be so violent.

Xia ruofei cursed the author of the booklet a thousand times in his heart. He had said everything but he did not explain the properties of the body tempering soup. Wasn’t this a scam?

Xia ruofei felt that he had to do something. Otherwise, he might really explode and die.

The first thing that came to his mind was the strange action demonstrated by the little golden man in the stone tablet.

He couldn’t think too much now. Xia ruofei sat on the ground and skillfully posed in a posture that was more difficult than yoga.

As soon as he did this, Xia ruofei felt more comfortable and the pressure on him decreased.

One minute ... Two minutes ... Three minutes ...

Xia ruofei could not feel the pain that he usually felt when he practiced this movement because the pain after taking the medicine was even worse ...

He couldn’t even feel the passage of time, and just maintained this position, motionless.

If Xia ruofei had a clock in front of him, he would be shocked because he had been holding on for far longer than usual.

Time slowly passed by.

The surging warm current in his body seemed to have found a way to vent out and gradually reduced. However, the speed of reduction was too slow and Xia ruofei was still in extreme pain.

He didn’t know how much time had passed, but he suddenly heard a light cracking sound, as if something had been broken.

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment and then realized that something was in his mind.

He closed his eyes to take a look, and his face immediately revealed a look of great joy.

It turned out that without realizing it, he had suddenly recalled the second set of movements the little golden man had demonstrated.

At this moment, Xia ruofei was still in the posture of the first set of movements, but he could no longer feel the pain of practicing them.

Xia ruofei had a sudden realization. He must have completed the first set of movements, which was why the second set of movements in his mind had been unlocked.
