Chapter 544: Chapter 425 – Sales surge (1)

Li Jing was sitting in his office, smoking a cigarette with a worried expression. The small office was filled with smoke, and a pungent smell filled the air.

Over the past few days, the news from various major channels that the new version of Drunken Eight Immortals had been on sale was not very optimistic. In fact, compared to the declining sales of the original version of Drunken Eight Immortals, the sales of the new version of Drunken Eight Immortals were even more pitiful. Almost no one was interested in it.

Li Jing had long anticipated this situation. After all, the price of the new version of Drunken Eight Immortals had been raised by a large margin! Moreover, the channels were not good enough, so it would be strange if he could have an outstanding performance!

Li Jing sighed, worried about how to write this month’s report.

At that moment, a young man barged into Li Jing’s office and said breathlessly,””Manager ... Manager li ... Yong Hui supermarket ...”

Li Jing frowned and said,”little Zheng, why are you so impatient?” You’re not a newbie anymore, have you forgotten the basic rules? Why didn’t you knock?”

Xiao Zheng scratched his head and said embarrassedly,””Manager, I ... I was so anxious that I forgot. How about ... I go out and do it again?”

Li Jing said unhappily,”forget it, forget it!” Have you caught your breath? What made you lose your composure? Did you just say Yonghui supermarket? Could it be that Yong Hui supermarket is taking our goods off the shelves? How many days has it been? Even if the sales aren’t good, it shouldn’t be that bad, right?”

As he spoke, he also secretly scolded the fat pig manager of Yonghui supermarket’s food department for having a big appetite. He showed him filial respect several times and even treated him to a meal, drink, and fun. Finally, he reluctantly agreed to give him an inconspicuous shelf space.

Could it be that the fat pig wanted to eat the rich again? Li Jing had a bad feeling about this.

“No, no, manager, it’s a good thing!” Xiaozheng quickly shook his head. This was great news! The 100 boxes of wine from Yonghui have been sold out, and manager Hu just called to ask us to send another 500 boxes over!”

“What?” Li Jing couldn’t believe his ears. He asked suspiciously,”did you hear me wrong?” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“How would I dare to make a mistake in such a big matter?” Little Zheng said,”I’ve confirmed it repeatedly. It’s true. Moreover, Yong Hui is quite anxious. They said that many customers are waiting to buy the wine and they want us to deliver the goods as soon as possible!”

Li Jing jumped up,”then what are we waiting for?” Hurry up and inform the warehouse to prepare the goods. You’ll take the car there personally and find out what’s the situation. ”

“Alright!” Little Zheng Xing turned around and left.

Li Jing sat on the chair, not quite understanding the situation.

“Could it be that someone just happened to be holding a banquet and bought so much wine at once?” Li Jing muttered to himself.

However, he quickly denied his guess that 100 boxes of wine were 600 bottles. Who would buy so much wine for a banquet?

Even if Li Jing racked his brains, he would never have imagined that the new version of Drunken Eight Immortals, which he had no high hopes for, would be sold out in Yong Hui supermarket ...

Li Jing, who was puzzled, was awoken by the ringing of a mobile phone. He came back to his senses and took a look at the phone. The call was from Deputy Manager Chen, who was in charge of drinks in the food department of Hualian supermarket.

Hualian supermarket was a large – scale chain supermarket that was not inferior to Yong Hui supermarket. It was also another large supermarket that Li Jing had spent a lot of effort to successfully get public relations. At least it had gotten a useless sales position.

Deputy Manager Chen was in charge of the liquor business. It was not an exaggeration to say that he was Li Jing’s God of Fortune.

Li Jing didn’t dare to delay and quickly picked up the phone.””Manager Chen, Hello!”

Deputy Manager Chen said enthusiastically,””Brother li! I hope I’m not disturbing your work. ”

Li Jing couldn’t come back to his senses. This Deputy Manager Chen was also not easy to serve. The salespeople of all the major wineries treated him like a god. Li Jing had gone to pay respects to him a few times, but Deputy Manager Chen had ignored him all the time. At most, he would hum a few words. He didn’t care about the sales manager of a small winery at all.

Why did his attitude suddenly take a 180 – degree turn today?

If it wasn’t for the familiar voice, Li Jing would have suspected that the person on the other end of the phone was an imposter.

Although he was surprised, he reacted quickly and immediately said,””Manager Chen, no matter how big the matter is, it can’t be as important as your matter! If you have any instructions, just tell me. As long as this little brother can do it, I will definitely not hesitate!”

Deputy Manager Chen laughed and said,””Brother Li, I just wanted to ask Youyou if you still have any stock of the new Drunken Eight Immortals wine that was produced a few days ago?”

Li Jing was stunned for a moment. Could it be that Hualian was also out of stock? Each of Hualian’s seven stores in the Sanshan District had a hundred boxes! This was much more than Yong Hui because Yong Hui was a local company and had many stores in San Shan city. However, the competition was also more intense. Li Jing had only taken down one of the stores.

On the other hand, Hualian sent 100 boxes to each store. Even if one store was out of stock, it was still very convenient to transfer goods between each other.

In fact, Li Jing didn’t even dare to think in this direction. He was already mentally prepared that the wine wouldn’t be sold out in a few months or even half a year.

So, Li Jing thought for a moment and said cautiously,””Manager Chen, we definitely have some wine in stock. You ...”

“You have stock?” Deputy Manager Chen said happily. That would be great! Brother li, this new product of yours is amazing! All seven of our stores have been sold out! Do you think you can ... Transport some over in case of an emergency? Otherwise, the customers will start a rebellion ...”
