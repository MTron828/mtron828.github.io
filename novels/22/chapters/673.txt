Chapter 674: Things don’t happen overnight (2)

When Qi Min heard this, he almost collapsed to the ground.

In the end, with the help of Lu Ping and Guo Ziyang, he left the private kitchen of the Wang family in a daze.

Standing at the entrance of the alley, the three of them looked around blankly. They looked at each other again and felt a deep sense of despair and powerlessness.

He had really kicked an iron plate this time! And it was a red – hot iron plate ...

In the private restaurant, fourth brother rubbed his hands and smiled apologetically.””Young master Song, CEO Xia, why don’t we continue to eat in the private room next door? Don’t worry, I’ll make a call to get it done immediately!”

Then, fourth brother looked at he kun and the others and said,””Bureau chief he, and these brothers and sisters, how about we all go over for a drink?”

Naturally, he kun wanted to build a relationship with the son of the head of the headquarters. However, he was in a position where he knew that he should follow Xia ruofei’s lead in this situation. Hence, he did not say anything. He only looked at Xia ruofei with a hint of anticipation in his eyes.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sure!” Then I’ll let fourth brother spend the money!”

“I don’t deserve it!” Fourth brother quickly said. I don’t dare! President Xia, please don’t call me fourth brother. You can call me CEng Xiaosi or just Xiaosi like young master Song!”

Xia ruofei hesitated for a moment. After all, he wasn’t in their circle and he wasn’t very familiar with fourth brother. It would be too frivolous to call him that.

After a moment of silence, he smiled and said,””Then I’ll still call you little fourth brother! So friendly!”

Fourth brother laughed out loud and said,””Yes, yes, yes, so friendly! So friendly! By the way, I can’t call you President Xia, can I? How should I address you?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”You can call me Xiao Xia or ruofei. That’s what my friends call me.”

“Alright! Then I’ll follow young master song’s example and call you ruofei!” Fourth brother said with a bright smile.

Fourth brother enthusiastically led everyone to the private room next door.

The private room next door was obviously much more high – end than the one he kun had just booked. Not only was it larger, but the furnishings were also more high – end.

Fourth brother made arrangements for the waiters to clear the dishes on the table and then instructed the kitchen to serve a banquet as soon as possible.

Following that, fourth brother personally raised his glass and gave a toast to everyone. After clearing the game, he wiped his mouth and said with a smile,””Young master Song, ruofei, let’s eat and drink first. I’ll go out and make a phone call.”

Xia ruofei knew that fourth brother must have gone to settle today’s matters, so he smiled and nodded.

Song Rui pouted and said,”Zeng Xiaosi, you’d better be quick!” You know my temper, I can’t let this matter drag on for the night!”

“I understand, I understand!” Fourth brother quickly said,”don’t worry, young master Song!”

This was the only chance to salvage the situation. How could fourth brother not use all his might to deal with it?

In fact, as soon as he left the room, he immediately called his father, Zeng Kewen.

If song Rui and the song family were not involved in today’s incident, the old man at home might not have been so alarmed. But now, the nature was completely different. Fourth brother called his father without any hesitation.

“Xiao si, shouldn’t you be eating with Master Song right now? Why are you calling me all of a sudden?” Zeng ke Wen asked seriously.

“Dad! There’s been an incident today, so I thought I had to report it to you immediately. ” Fourth brother said.

“You say it!”

“It’s just a coincidence today. We didn’t know about this beforehand, but one of young master song’s good friends ... Er, from what I can tell, this friend of his has a close relationship with the entire song family. At that time, young master song’s friend was eating in the private room next door. ” Fourth brother said in full detail,”and this President Xia invited a cadre of the general Administration of Drug Administration ...”

Fourth brother’s thoughts were clear as he reported, while Zeng ke Wen quietly listened. Even after fourth brother finished, the other end of the phone was still very quiet.

After a long while, fourth brother thought that his father had fallen asleep. At this moment, Zeng ke Wen suddenly asked,””Xiao si, what is Master song’s attitude?”

Fourth brother was stunned for a moment.”Ruofei and young master Song are Good Brothers. Young master Song is naturally on his side. Oh, that’s right. Young master Song did say that he doesn’t want things to be delayed overnight!”

“I understand ...” Zeng Kewen said.”Go back and tell director Xia that Qi Min and the other two will receive the notice of suspension for inspection tonight. The organization will immediately start the investigation process. As for the rest, I will arrange it. You don’t have to worry about it. Just entertain Master Song ... And director Xia!”

“I got it!” Fourth brother immediately said. He then asked respectfully,”father, do you have any other instructions?”

“There’s nothing else,” Zeng Kewen said,”just do what you need to do. I’ll take care of what I need to do.”

“Alright!”

Just as fourth brother was about to hang up, Zeng ke Wen suddenly thought of something and asked,””By the way, you just said that the person who accompanied President Xia to the headquarters was a leader from the southeast Food and Drug Administration?”

“Deputy bureau chief he kun.” Fourth brother quickly said.

“Oh! How about this, I’ll find time to meet little he tomorrow. ” Zeng ke Wen said,”tell him to keep his phone on and wait for my Secretary’s call.”

“Alright!”

Fourth brother, who had received his father’s personal instructions, returned to the private room with a peace of mind.

“Young master Song, ruofei, I just called my father to report tonight’s incident ...” He said with a smile.

He kun’s ears perked up when he heard this.

Fourth brother continued,”my father said that black sheep like Qi Min and the other two should be eliminated from the cadre. They should receive the organization’s decision to deal with them tonight!”

Song Rui nodded and asked lightly,””What about RUO Fei’s project?”

“My father will personally ask about it. There won’t be any problems!” Fourth brother quickly said.

“Not bad! Zeng Xiaosi, you’re quite sincere!” Song Rui finally showed a satisfied look and said,”although those scumbags from the general Administration of Drug Administration made me very unhappy tonight, I’ll let this matter go for the sake of your honesty!”

“Yo! Thank you so much, young master Song!” Fourth brother smiled and said,”we’re the ones in the wrong in this matter. What we did later was just to remedy the situation. We don’t deserve your praise!”

“Alright! “Don’t be humble ...” Song Rui said.”Let’s drink!”

“Here, young master Song, a toast to you!” Fourth brother quickly raised his glass and said.

After drinking a glass of wine with song Rui, fourth brother finally remembered he kun.

He put down his wine glass and said to he kun,””By the way, bureau chief he, my father said that he will find time to meet you tomorrow. Please make sure to keep in touch with your phone so that you don’t miss the call.”

He kun was overjoyed and said excitedly,””Good, good, good! Thank you, young master Zeng!”

He was too old to call him “fourth brother,” but “young master Zeng” was already very respectful.

“There’s no need to thank me,” Fourth brother smiled and said,”it was my father who asked to meet you. I didn’t play much of a role in it.”

“I have to thank you! I have to thank you!” “Oh, right.” He kun said and immediately asked,”Mr. Zeng, do I need to prepare any report in advance?” Please give me some advice ...”

Fourth brother thought for a moment and said,”director he, my father probably wants to have a simple talk with you.” There was no clear theme. If you really want to prepare in advance ... Why don’t you put some effort into the heart – nourishing soup project of the southeast province’s Taoyuan pharmaceutical company? I think my father will be more interested in this project!”

“I understand, I understand! Thank you, young master Zeng!” He kun said happily.

He looked at Xia ruofei with a complicated expression. He had thought that he had come to the capital to help Xia ruofei. He did not expect that things would develop to this point, and Xia ruofei was the one helping him.

If he could get in touch with director CEng this time, the help he would receive in his career would be immeasurable!

In this way, Xia ruofei was really her benefactor!

Just as Xia ruofei and the others were having a drink at the private kitchen of the Wang family, the general administration of medicine and cosmetics registration Division, especially the Chinese medicine and ethnic Medicine Division, was already in a mess ...
