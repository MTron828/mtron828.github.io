2616 Asking elder song for advice 2

“Of course!” Old master Liu said,”this is not a small matter after all. You can take your time to consider it. However ... I still hope that the progress of my treatment can be faster. I hope that it won’t be delayed because of the consultation fee. ”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”how is that possible?” I’ve been thinking of a way to cure your disease every night. ”

Old master Liu knew that Xia ruofei’s words were half true and half false. He had to believe it, but he couldn’t completely believe it either. However, no one was stupid enough to make it clear now, so he smiled and nodded.”I know all of this. It’s been hard on you, little Xia!”

“You’re welcome. This is part of my job, isn’t it?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”take your medicine and rest. I’ll come back in the afternoon to check on you!”

“Alright!” Old man Liu said.

As soon as Xia ruofei left elder Liu’s room, he saw Liu Qunfeng waiting in the corridor not far away.

“Mr. Xia!” When Liu Qunfeng saw Xia ruofei, he immediately walked up to him and asked with a nervous look,”how did the discussion between you and the old man go?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Mr. Liu has indeed suggested three payment plans for the treatment. I can choose from them.”

Liu Qunfeng looked at Xia ruofei nervously and asked,””Then you are ...”

“Don’t worry! I didn’t choose to take your group’s shares. ” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”to be exact, I didn’t choose any of them! I think it’s better to focus on the treatment now. It’s too early to talk about the treatment fee before we’re completely confident. ”

Liu Qunfeng heaved a sigh of relief. No matter what, it was good news that Xia ruofei did not choose the 40% shares.

Based on Liu Qunfeng’s understanding of his father, if Xia ruofei chose to take the 40% shares, the old man would not delay it for even a day. He would complete all the paperwork for the change of shares today. The other members of the Liu family would not even have the chance to object. Xia ruofei would then become the largest shareholder of the Liu family corporation.

At that time, would this large corporation with a scale of nearly 10 billion US dollars be surnamed Liu or Xia?

As the leader of the Liu family’s next generation, how could Liu Qunfeng face the doubts of so many people?

After all, not many people were successful in their official careers, and there were obviously more mediocre people. Many of the Liu family’s people had no hope in politics and were incompetent in business. They lived a decent life by relying on the dividends of their family group’s company.

Losing 40% of the shares all of a sudden, and possibly controlling the entire Liu family in the future, was definitely a disaster for these family members.

“Thank you, Mr. Xia!” Liu Qunfeng said sincerely. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”chief Liu, it’s too early to thank me. I just haven’t made a choice yet.” Maybe when I have to make a choice, I’ll be interested in the 40% shares again? As far as I know, the scale of the Liu family’s family business is not small. 40%... It’s much more valuable than my own small company. ”

Liu Qunfeng’s heart skipped a beat, but he forced a smile and said,””You must be joking ... The Paradise Corporation is the one with endless potential and a bright future. Although it’s small now, it has much more room for development than our family group!”

Xia ruofei laughed.”Chief Liu, don’t be so nervous. I haven’t made my choice yet.”

When you make your choice, it’ll be too late to say anything! Liu Qunfeng couldn’t help but curse in his heart.

Xia ruofei did not wait for Liu Qunfeng to speak and said,””Chief Liu, I worked overtime to boil the medicine until very late last night, so I’m still sleepy! I’m going to catch up on sleep, please excuse me!”

“Good! Good! Good!” “Thank you for your hard work, Mr. Xia!” Liu Qunfeng said.

Xia ruofei nodded and turned to the guest room that the Liu family had arranged for him.

After returning to his room, Xia ruofei set up a soundproof formation. Then, he took out his phone and dialed a number.

The call was picked up quickly. Xia ruofei asked with a smile,””Manager Lu? My little Xia!”

“RUO Fei!” On the other end of the line, manager Lu was also very enthusiastic.”What brings you here today?” Is there something wrong?”

“Did you guys receive the jaded skin cream set that I brought for Auntie last time?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

The last time manager Lu mentioned it, Xia ruofei had instructed Qin Yanan to arrange for the e – commerce Department to send some Jade skin cream to manager Lu’s lover.

“Got it!” Manager Lu said. I received it! I received it a long time ago ... But if you send so much at once, my wife won’t be able to use it all!”

Xia ruofei did not know how much the e – commerce Department had sent to them, so he smiled and said,””Use it slowly! The shelf life of our mass – produced version is quite long. If you still can’t use it up, you can give it to your relatives and friends! At present, the production of jaded skin cream hasn’t come up yet, so many people can’t buy it even if they want to!”

“You! You’re just too polite!” Manager Lu smiled and said,”Oh right, you’re looking for me for something, right?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Yes, I have something to ask Grandpa song. I wonder when he’ll be free.”

“You’re coming over?” Manager Lu said,”anytime! Even if the chief is busy, can’t you just wait here for a while? Didn’t the chief say it last time? This place is like your own home, who needs to report when going back to their own home?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”that’s what you said!” Next time, I won’t say a word and directly kill my way over!”

“Sure!” Manager Lu said.

Xia ruofei said,”manager Lu, let’s stop joking.” I can’t leave today, so I wanted to ask Grandpa song a few questions. What is he doing right now? Is it convenient for you to answer the phone?”

“I think he’s playing chess with his old comrade!” Manager Lu said,”how about this? I’ll help you keep an eye on it. When the chief is free, I’ll call back for you so that you can talk to him directly. How about it?”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said,”then I’ll leave it to you!”

……

Xia ruofei didn’t have to wait for long. About half an hour later, his phone rang. It was manager Lu.

As soon as Xia ruofei picked up the call, he heard old song’s angry voice.””RUO Fei, I heard from Xiao Lu that you were looking for me? Why didn’t you just come over?”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”Grandpa song, I’m busy with something. I can’t leave at the moment, so I called you directly to ask for your advice.”

“You’re at old Liu’s house, right?”elder song asked after a moment of silence.

“En!” Xia ruofei replied,”I’ve been staying here for the past few days.”

“Isn’t this old man recovering well?” Elder song asked,”why did his condition worsen all of a sudden?”

“The reason is a bit complicated. I’ll explain it to you when we meet again. Anyway, I’m not responsible for this at all, and the Liu family will admit it. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Grandpa song, it’s like this. Elder Liu came to talk to me today. It was mainly about the cost of the treatment. He gave me three plans, and the conditions were quite attractive!”

“Oh?” Elder song laughed and said,”it seems that this old man has really begun to cherish his life! Tell me, what are his conditions?”

Xia ruofei naturally would not hide anything from elder song. He told elder song about the conditions that elder Liu had given him.

In the end, Xia ruofei said,”Grandpa song, to be honest, all three conditions are very good. I don’t know which one to choose. So, I want to hear your opinion.”

After a moment of silence, eccentric song said,”Since you don’t know what to choose, let’s use the process of elimination! If you ask for my opinion, then the first thing I’ll eliminate will definitely be the forty percent shares!”

“Oh? Why?” Xia ruofei asked curiously,”I thought you would suggest that I choose these shares! After all, this seems to be the most valuable item. “
