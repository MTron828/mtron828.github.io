Translator: 549690339

Tang Yitian’s hearty laughter suddenly came from the expensive sound system in the car,””RUO Fei, what are you busy with? It’s been so long and you didn’t even think of calling big brother!”

This rich man who could shake up the entire Australian retail industry with just a cough did not put on any airs in front of Xia ruofei.

One must know that Tang Yitian was one of the few people in the world who vaguely knew Xia ruofei’s identity as a cultivator. Moreover, Xia ruofei was also Tang Haoran’s teacher.

The identity of a billionaire might be very prominent in front of others, but he would not hold back in front of Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei laughed as he drove.””I’m just busy! A small business can’t be compared to big brother Tang, who has a lot of chores to do all day long!”

“Hahaha! “Ruofei, you’re too humble ...” Tang Yitian said with a smile.”Your company’s abalone auction has caused such a big commotion. I’ve heard about it in Australia!”

Then, Tang Yitian complained again,”brother, you’re not a good friend!” Why didn’t they send me an invitation to such an interesting auction? If I can also participate in the remote auction, I’ll definitely help you!”

Xia ruofei smiled and explained,”the details are all handled by the people below. I’m not too sure.” Big brother Tang, I’ll definitely criticize the person in charge when I get back. How could I neglect you?” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Come on!” Tang Yitian said,”you’re willing to criticize your beautiful boss? Hahaha ...”

Xia ruofei was speechless. He didn’t expect Feng Jing to be so famous that even Tang Yitian, who was in Australia, knew about it.

Also, I’m on speaker ... Can you be a little more tactful? Xia ruofei glanced at Hu Zi’s mother, who was sitting in the front passenger seat, and smiled bitterly.

“Big brother Tang, you’re not looking for me just to condemn me, are you?” he quickly changed the topic.

Tang Yitian laughed and said,””Ruofei, I’m going back to China to attend an Entrepreneur Summit in a few days. I’m going to bring Jennifer and Haoran back with me. Haoran has been talking about you all day!”

Xia ruofei was also very happy to hear that. He was also very happy that Tang Haoran had found an extremely talented disciple.

Moreover, Tang Haoran had been cultivating on his own. Xia ruofei was worried that something might go wrong with him. It was good to see him and check on his cultivation progress.

“Big brother Tang, doesn’t Haoran need to go to school?” Xia ruofei asked.

It was September now, and the children in China were about to start school.

Tang Yitian laughed.”The school holidays in Australia are different from those in China. It’s usually divided into four semesters, and there are two weeks of vacation between each semester. Haoran’s school starts in early October. He’s still on vacation when I came back to China!”

Then, Tang Yitian said with emotion,””Basically, as long as there’s an opportunity, I’ll bring Haoran back to visit more often so that he won’t forget that he’s a Chinese. Although he was born in Australia and was an Australian citizen, the blood flowing in his body was the Yan Huang bloodline! No matter how far you go or how high you fly, you can’t forget the place where you started!”

In fact, Tang Yitian himself was born in Australia. However, he had received a traditional education since he was young, so he had a strong sense of identity with his motherland.

Unlike some people who went abroad to study and even forgot about their ancestors, it was not surprising that their children had become white – hearted Banana Men.

Hearing this, Xia ruofei was also filled with respect. He said seriously,””You’re absolutely right, big brother Tang! You can’t forget your roots, I support you!”

If he wanted to do something, he had to be a person first. Xia ruofei had very high expectations of Tang Haoran’s character. Otherwise, if he had mastered the cultivation method and did as he pleased to harm society, it would be a great destructive power.

That was why Xia ruofei did not hesitate to use his spiritual power to leave a mark in Tang Haoran’s young heart. Tang Yitian and his wife also attached great importance to Tang Haoran’s personality education, which Xia ruofei was very satisfied with.

“Big brother Tang, when are you guys coming back?” Xia ruofei asked.

“I haven’t decided on the exact schedule yet, but it’ll be in about a week!” Tang Yitian said. Ruofei, this Entrepreneur Summit is held in Beijing. After the summit, I’m going to take Haoran to visit the Forbidden City and the great Wall, and then we’ll fly to the three mountains to meet you!”

Xia ruofei nodded and agreed. Let me know after you’ve set your schedule!”

......

After returning to the three mountains, Xia ruofei resumed his carefree life.

However, Hu Zi’s mother moved back to the forestry Bureau dormitory the next day. The daguantian real estate that he had bought from Liang Weimin’s jianda group had been completely renovated according to Lin Qiao’s suggestions. However, even though they had used environmentally friendly materials, the newly renovated house still needed some ventilation, especially in the hottest period of summer when the formaldehyde was the strongest. Xia ruofei would definitely not let Hu Zi’s mother move in at this time.

Moreover, the house rented by the forestry Bureau’s residence was relatively closer to the bell Tower No. 2 primary school where Nan Nan studied. Therefore, Hu Zi’s mother was not in a hurry to cancel the rental.
