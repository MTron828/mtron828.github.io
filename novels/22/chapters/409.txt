Chapter 410: Xia ruofei’s anger (2)

Lu You bit her lower lip and nodded.””It’s that simple. Xia ruofei, I don’t have any friends of the opposite sex, so I can only ask you for help. You must help me. ”

Xia ruofei muttered to himself. He felt that things were not as simple as Lu You had made them out to be. What was Lu You’s identity? She didn’t like him, so why couldn’t she reject him?

Xia ruofei felt that something was wrong, but he could not figure it out.

At that moment, his phone flashed and a WeChat notification came in.

Xia ruofei picked up his phone and opened WeChat. It was a message from song Rui. Brother, I’m meeting that girl today to clear things up. I’m going in now! Haha, no matter how I think about it, your idea is still the most reliable!

After reading song Rui’s message, Xia ruofei suddenly had an idea.

He stared straight at Lu You’s face. All his questions seemed to have been answered. A few days ago, song Rui had said that his family had arranged a marriage for him. Today, Lu You had said that he had a suitor that he could not directly reject. Moreover, Tian Huilan had a very close relationship with the song family and was a hardcore political ally. The answer was obvious!

Lu You’s hair stood on end under Xia ruofei’s gaze. She asked unnaturally,””What are you looking at me for?”

Xia ruofei’s expression turned cold. He asked,””Lu You, the suitor you’re talking about is song Rui, right?”

Lu You’s expression changed when she heard this. She opened her mouth and wanted to explain to Xia ruofei, but Xia ruofei had already stood up and said coldly,””Do I look like a silly boy that can be used so easily?”

Lu You’s face was a little pale. She said weakly,””Xia ruofei, I didn’t ...”

Xia ruofei was not interested in her explanation and walked out of the door.

Just as he reached the door, Xia ruofei saw song Rui walking in.

The moment song Rui saw Xia ruofei, he was so surprised that his mouth was wide open. When Xia ruofei was about to walk past him, he grabbed Xia ruofei and shouted,””RUO Fei, what are you doing here? Did you receive the WeChat message I sent you?”

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”Oh, I’m having lunch here. Are you meeting that woman at this restaurant?” Then quickly go in!”

With that, Xia ruofei walked out.

Song Rui shouted behind him,”Hey!” RUO Fei, don’t go yet!”

Song Rui called him a few times, but Xia ruofei did not turn around. He waved at song Rui with his back facing him and made a phone call gesture before he continued to walk out.

“This kid, why is he acting so weird today?” Song Rui muttered to himself.

He didn’t think too much about it and just shook his head before walking into the restaurant.

Song Rui found Lu You’s seat and saw her sitting there in a daze. She was unmoved by his arrival and her eyes were a little red.

“Lu You, are you alright?” Song Rui asked.

Only then did Lu You raise her head. When she saw that it was song Rui, she frowned slightly and said indifferently,””Mr. Song, I’m sorry, I have something to attend to, so I have to leave first ...”

Lu You stood up after she finished speaking. Song Rui quickly said,””Wait, wait, wait! Lu You, I asked you out today because I have a few words to say to you. I won’t take up too much of your time. ”

Lu You furrowed her brows. There was a hint of disgust in her eyes, but she still sat down and said coldly,””Then tell me! To make it short, I really have something urgent to do ...”

Lu You’s attitude was very cold, but song Rui didn’t take it to heart. On the contrary, he was secretly delighted. He could tell that Lu You wasn’t interested in him at all. Since that was the case, the rest would be easy to discuss.

Song Rui didn’t beat around the bush and said directly,””Actually, I just want to make things clear to you. Although the elders on both sides are willing to get married, I personally don’t have any feelings for you. You also know that you can’t force things. If you force yourself to be together, neither side will be happy, so ...”

In the beginning, Lu You’s expression was very calm. However, the more she heard, the more surprised she became. Her beautiful eyes could not help but widen.

“You mean ...” She said.

“I don’t think you’d want to get engaged to someone you don’t know at all.” Song Rui said,”so, we are on the same side on this matter. I will try my best to fight against my family. I hope you will do the same. This way, the chances of the elders in my family changing their minds will be higher.”

“I agree!” Lu You immediately nodded.

When song Rui heard these two words, he suddenly felt relaxed and blurted out,””That’s great!”

As soon as he finished speaking, song Rui seemed to feel that something was wrong and quickly said,””Lu You, I’m not saying that you’re bad. The main thing is ...”

Lu You waved her hand and said,”there’s no need to explain. I understand.” What you said just now was actually what I wanted to tell you. Since we’ve come to an agreement, that’s for the best. Mr. Song, I really have something urgent to attend to. ” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

After saying that, Lu You stood up and walked out. After taking two steps, she turned back and said,””By the way, please help me place the order later.”

After saying that, Lu You took out her wallet and took out two hundred – Yuan bills. Song Rui quickly said,””Don ‘t, don’ t, don ‘t. I’ll just pay the bill.”
