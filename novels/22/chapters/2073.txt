2074 The yacht arrives at the port (1)

“Ah?” Ling Qingxue’s sleepiness was instantly gone. She sat up on the bed and said,”why didn’t you tell me in advance that you were coming back? I’ll pick you up at the airport!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”the farm is right next to the airport. Why do you have to make a trip all the way from the city?” I didn’t want you to suffer, so I told you when I got home!”

Xia ruofei continued,”stop talking about me. Why are you making the tender?” You’re actually sleeping at twoo’ clock, do you want to die?”

Ling Qingxue replied,”sometimes!” Recently, the company is expanding, so it’s normal to have more things to do ... Ruofei, my dad is already looking for a professional manager team. I’ll be able to relax slowly in the future. ”

“No matter what, try not to stay up late if you can.” Xia ruofei said,”Oh right, how’s your cultivation going while I wasn’t home?”

Ling Qingxue said gloomily,”ruofei, am I stupid?” When a person trains alone, there’s basically no improvement ... I’ve already tried very hard, but ...”

“Silly girl, Didn’t I tell you before? The “absolute beginning Scripture” cultivation technique is tailored for joint training. If you cultivate it alone, this cultivation technique is even worse than some unrated rubbish cultivation techniques!” Xia ruofei said,”that’s why it’s normal for your improvement to not be obvious. Don’t let your thoughts run wild ...”

“I know you’ve said that!” Ling Qingxue said,”but you also told me that I have to persevere in my cultivation every day!”

“That’s to let you familiarize yourself with the technique and maintain your sense of Qi. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”besides, if you don’t practice every day, it won’t just be a problem of not making obvious progress. You might even regress a lot! Cultivation is like rowing a boat against the current. You can’t slack off for even a moment. ”

“I know ... I’ll work hard!” Ling Qingxue said,”it’s good that you’re back now. We can practice together!”

“En!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ve been on the plane for more than ten hours today, so I’ll take a break first. I’ll go to the company tomorrow. Let’s have lunch together! If there’s nothing to do in the afternoon, we can practice together!”

Of course, Xia ruofei also hoped that Ling Qingxue’s cultivation would improve as soon as possible. It would be best if they could engage in a deeper joint practice as soon as possible.

Even though he still didn’t know how Ling Qingxue’s cultivation had reached that level and how he was going to tell her about Song Wei, there was always a way out. He had to let Ling Qingxue experience the wonderful feeling of the complete spiritual integration first. Only then would he be able to obtain Ling Qingxue’s understanding and acceptance.

“Alright!” Ling Qingxue said happily,”you can rest well on the farm today! We’ll contact each other tomorrow ...”

“Alright! Wife, I’m hanging up!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Bye!”

After the call, Xia ruofei got up and went to lock the door and windows. Then, he took out the spirit map and painting scroll, ready to go to the medium to patrol.

Just then, the phone he had just put down rang again.

Xia ruofei held the painting in one hand and waved his other hand. The phone on the bedside table slowly floated to his hand.

Xia ruofei took a look at the caller ID and saw that it was an unknown number.

This kind of number was often used for fraud, marketing, and other Harassment calls. However, Xia ruofei saw that this number was not marked by other users, so he hesitated for a while and answered.

“Hello!” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

“Are you Mr. Xia ruofei?” A very young voice came from the phone, as if he had heard it somewhere before.

“I am, and you are?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Hello, Mr. Xia!” The young man said enthusiastically,”I’m Xiao Liao from azmu!”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. Then, he immediately remembered that this Xiao Liao was Liao Bo, the salesman of azmu’s yacht.

“Oh, it’s manager Liao!” He immediately said with a smile. You’re calling me because you have good news, right?”

“Mr. Xia, you’re really good at predicting things!” Liao Bo chuckled and said,”I’m just here to inform you that the yacht you ordered has arrived at the port! When do you think it’s convenient for you to come and handle the delivery?”

Xia ruofei’s eyes lit up and he asked,”Oh?” Where’s the yacht now?”

“The yacht is already docked at the three mountains cruise dock.” Liao Bo said,”our company also has an office near the yacht dock. I can send you the exact location through WeChat! What time would be more convenient for you?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”let’s do it today!” Manager Liao, please add me on WeChat. This is the phone number, and just send me the location. ”

“Alright!” Liao Bo said happily,”please bring along the agreement that you signed when you made the order, your personal identification documents, as well as the receipt for the advance payment and other information. In addition ... The final payment is 1.85 million Yuan. Please also prepare it in advance.”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei said straightforwardly.

After ordering the yacht, Xia ruofei had put all the relevant information in a document bag and directly thrown it into the cave in the mountain and sea realm in the spirit map space.

Under the rules of the spirit map space, only Xia ruofei, the owner of the space, could enter the cave. It was safe enough to put it in the space, and it was even safer to put it in the cave. There was no need to worry about it being accidentally destroyed by the Hornet or the White sector Fox, who were the residents of the spirit map space.
