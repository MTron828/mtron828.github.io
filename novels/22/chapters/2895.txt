2896 The great Savior_

The Super-luxury yacht cost more than 1.5 billion US dollars to build, far more expensive than the average private jet. It was one of the most expensive yachts in the world, and its safety performance was almost the first at that time. Even if it encountered a storm at sea, it had a high probability of surviving it safely.

Therefore, Charlie was very relaxed on the sea.

He was on vacation in Hawaii this time, and then he went out to sea with two Hollywood female stars who had just made a name for themselves. For him, this was just a normal relaxation in his busy daily work. In the past, he often took this super luxury yacht to sea, and nothing had ever happened.

However, just as he was at his most relaxed, Davis’s men suddenly attacked.

There were more than ten people that Davis had planted in different positions. They suddenly attacked at the same time and killed Charlie’s best bodyguards at the first opportunity. Caught off guard, the bodyguards did not even have a chance to resist before they were shot and died.

The rest of the crew were all ordinary workers, and they had no room to resist the well-equipped Davis and the others. They were captured in the shortest time possible.

At the time of all this, Charlie was in the most luxurious master bedroom on the entire yacht with two Hollywood newbies. The good sound-proof environment made him completely unaware of what was happening outside.

When Davis, who had been hiding in the crew’s room, appeared in front of Charlie, Charlie was still in a state of confusion.

Everything was under Davis’s control.

The super-yacht seemed to be impregnable, but once the interior was infiltrated, all the security protection did not work, and it almost collapsed instantly.

Davis forced the crew to drive the yacht away from Hawaii and to the high seas far away from the traditional sea route.

Under the cover of the night, a tragedy played out in front of Charlie, making him feel like his eyes were about to burst.

Davis took everyone on the yacht, except for the people he had arranged to infiltrate and Charlie, to the second-floor deck and knelt in a row. Then, the few burly men he brought followed his instructions and killed all of them one by one with pistols.

The two Hollywood rookies were not spared either. Charlie watched helplessly as the two stunties, who had just been in bed with him, revealed a look of collapse and despair when faced with butcher’s muzzle. Then, the pistol equipped with a silencer emitted a weak tongue of fire. After the deep sound of the gunshot, the two stunties fell to the deck like gunny sacks. After twitching a few times, they returned to silence.

At this time, the second-floor deck was really a river of blood. Davis looked at the corpses of the innocent crew members he had ordered to be slaughtered, lying all over the ground. Not only did he not feel any discomfort, but he also felt a bloodthirsty pleasure.

Of course, it was more of the pleasure of the big plan he had planned for ten years finally succeeding in one fell swoop, and soon he would receive a hundred billion dollars in inheritance. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Who said that one would not want more money if they could not finish spending it? They were all born from the same mother and were all core members of the Coch family. On what basis did Charlie possess the majority of the family’s wealth and the powerful social status that the Coch family had brought to him, while he, Davis, could only sit around and wait for death with the dividends that seemed to be incalculable to ordinary people? These dividends and a small number of shares, in Davis’s eyes, were just some leftovers that were leaked out from the gaps between Charlie’s teeth. It was a kind of charity to his super reincarnation ability.

Davis had never lost his ambition, but he had hidden it well before he launched an attack, and finally succeeded.

He ordered his men to put all the bodies into bags, tie them to heavy objects with steel wires, and then push them into the sea one by one.

This area of the sea was far away from the mainland of the United States and the Hawaiian Islands. Traditional sea routes did not pass through here, so no ships would pass by here. In the vast sea, these corpses would never be found if they were thrown away.

Charlie watched helplessly as the bodies of these staff members were thrown into the sea like dumplings. His heart was filled with despair because he knew that he would be the next.

Davis had brought the yacht to the open sea, so he obviously didn’t intend to let the yacht return.

He must have thought of a way to leave. Maybe his ship was following him outside of his field of vision. When he left the yacht, he would blow up this Sea Palace worth more than a billion dollars and go back to the United States to seize his family property.

What Charlie didn’t expect was that Davis found it too troublesome to directly seize the family property, and the taxes were too high, so he actually concocted a will.

What made Charlie even sadder was that he really had no choice. Even if he knew that he would die after signing, he could only sign it obediently.

At the thought of this, Charlie couldn’t help but feel sad. His hand holding the pen trembled and hesitated for a long time. After a strong confrontation in his heart, his reason finally triumphed over his hatred. With tears streaming down his face, he signed his name on the will and wrote the time according to Davis’s request to be one year ago.

Davis took the will from his confidant. After confirming that there were no problems, he couldn’t help but be overjoyed and laugh.

On the other hand, Charlie’s face was ashen as he slumped down on the deck, his heart in complete despair.
