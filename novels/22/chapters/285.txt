“Brother, don’t come over ... I was wrong, I was wrong ... Please spare me!” The black – clothed man’s face was ashen as he repeatedly begged for mercy. “Who’s your brother?”Xia ruofei asked coldly. “Big brother! You’re the Big Brother!” The Man in Black hurriedly changed his words,”big brother, please let me go! I don’t dare to do it again ...” Xia ruofei’s eyes flashed with disdain. He asked,””Tell me, why are you looking for Mr. Li Zhifu?” “Big brother, it’s brother de who wants to cooperate with that old man ... Oh, no, no, no, with Mr. Li Zhifu. Brother de wants to invite Mr. Li to be the technical consultant of our Yuanshan tea factory ...” The Man in Black quickly said. “Oh?” Xia ruofei pursed his lips and said,”then your way of inviting people is really unique!” “Big brother, I was wrong!” The Man in Black said with a long face. But I’m only following orders! Old Mr. Li was unwilling to cooperate, so brother de asked me to bring some people to scare him ... We really didn’t want to hurt old Mr. Li! Brother de also said that if old Mr. Li is willing to come out of the mountain, he will give him an annual salary of 100000 Yuan!” Xia ruofei’s face turned cold and said,””You didn’t want to hurt old Mr. Li? Then what’s with the wound on his head?” Not only did elder song find out that li Zhifu’s injury had a hidden story, Xia ruofei also saw it clearly. Combined with the fact that these hooligans had come to threaten him, it was easy to analyze that li Zhifu’s injury was definitely related to these people. “I really don’t know about this, big brother!” The black – clothed man quickly replied. The night before yesterday, brother de asked us to warn this family. We ... We only broke a piece of glass in his house and did nothing else!” Xia ruofei stared coldly at the Man in Black. The Man in Black did not even dare to breathe. He lowered his head and no longer had the arrogance he had earlier. After a long while, Xia ruofei said calmly,””Get lost! Tell your brother de that if he doesn’t want to die, he better restrain himself. If he dares to harass old Mr. Li again, he will regret being born into this world. ” “Yes, yes, yes ...” The Man in Black said. Only then did he dare to stand up from the ground. However, because both of his arms were dislocated, it was hard to maintain his balance, so his entire body swayed. The burly Man in Black called out to a few of his underlings to help each other and left in a sorry state. Xia ruofei walked back and asked,””Uncle Niu, have these people been harassing old Mr. Li for a long time?” “It’s been a while. At first, they didn’t know that the old man lived here and even went to the village to ask around. Later on, they found out and came to visit almost every day. In the beginning, brother de was more polite, but my old man refused to give in, so he began to call some little punks to threaten us ... The glass of our house was smashed the day before yesterday! The old man happened to be beside the window and was a little frightened. He even fell down ...” “Then why didn’t he tell my grandfather about his injury?” song Rui asked curiously. “The old man is afraid of troubling song ... Bureau chief!” Niu Yusheng said. He had always been like this. He would rather carry everything on his own, afraid of causing trouble for others. Yesterday, he said that he wanted to move out! He said that those people had caused a ruckus and I couldn’t do business here anymore! He’s already over 90 years old, and he only has Guizhi as his only child. How can we be at ease and let him live outside?” “This old man ... He really has a character!” Song Rui said. Xia ruofei looked at song Rui and said,””Song Rui, didn’t you say that you have a lot of friends on Mount Wu Yi? You have to help old Mr. Li solve this matter completely!” “No problem!” Song Rui said without thinking,”I’ll contact my friend later. I guarantee that brother de will come to apologize tomorrow!” I won’t dare to harass old Mr. Li anymore!” “Then, thank you!” Niu Yusheng said,”but ... Don’t tell the old master that I was the one who told him about this! Otherwise, he’s going to nag at me again!” Niu Yusheng was also an old man in his sixties, but he still respected and feared his father – in – Law. It could be seen that li Zhifu’s daughter and son – in – Law were quite filial. The three of them talked as they walked into the shop, and Niu Yusheng pulled down the curtain Door. In the beginning, the burly Man in Black didn’t even dare to turn his head and ran forward with all his might. After running for some distance, he slowly stopped and gathered his courage to turn around. Seeing that Niu Yusheng’s electrical appliance repair shop had already closed, his eyes revealed a bit of resentment and hatred. He gritted his teeth and said,””Brat, you’re dead! You even dare to hit brother de’s people, just wait to suffer brother de’s anger!” Then, the Man in Black said to his lackeys,””Let’s go! Go to brother de!” “Boss, don’t you want to go to the hospital to check your arm first?” one of the lackeys asked. “Idiot! Is brother de’s matter more important than my injury?” The Man in Black cursed,”why aren’t you getting the car?” “Ah? I ... I’ll go?” The underling’s entire body trembled as he spoke. Their car was parked next to Niu Yusheng’s electrical repair shop. The underling couldn’t help but feel scared when he thought about going back to drive his car. “Nonsense! If you don’t go, I’ll go. ” The Man in Black said angrily,”can I still drive like this?” After saying that, the Man in Black raised his foot and was about to kick him. The younger brother quickly shouted,””Boss, I’ll go, I’ll go ...” Then, he carefully walked back and quickly got his car. The underlings helped the Man in Black into the car, and the car left yangdun town. When Xia ruofei and the others went upstairs, elder song and Li Zhifu were chatting and drinking tea. The two of them laughed happily from time to time. Seeing Xia ruofei, elder song asked,””Little Xia, you’ve settled it?” “Mm! Chief, it was just a few hooligans who caused trouble and I chased them away!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Eccentric song nodded and smiled. “Let’s sit down and have tea together! Brother Fu’s tea is really good! It’s even better than those specially supplied tea leaves!” “Little song, if you like it, you can take some with you!” Li Zhifu said with a smile. “Alright! Brother Fu, then I won’t be polite with you!” Elder song said happily. “Hey! What’s there to be polite about our home – made tea!” Li Zhifu said. Xia ruofei and song Rui also sat down and drank tea. One had to admit that li Zhifu’s tea – making skills were superb. Even Xia ruofei, who didn’t know much about tea, could clearly feel the difference from the tea he had drunk before. Perhaps he couldn’t understand the “rock charm” that li Zhifu mentioned, but he could taste the unique taste of this Da Hong Pao. Everyone drank tea and chatted. Soon, the sky gradually darkened. Li Zhifu called Li Guizhi to prepare dinner. Then, he smiled and said,”Little song, we haven’t seen each other for so many years. Why don’t you stay for a meal?” Eccentric song didn’t decline politely and said with a smile,””Alright!” Then, he asked manager Lu to call Xu Wu and Huang Fang to inform them that he would not be returning to the hotel for dinner. Just as everyone was having a good chat, the big man in Black and a few of his underlings drove back to the Yuanshan tea factory in the suburbs. As soon as he got out of the car, the Man in Black rushed into the general manager’s office of the tea factory and cried,””Brother de, you ... You have to make the decision for me!”
