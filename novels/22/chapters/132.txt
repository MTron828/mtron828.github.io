  The flow of time!

  Xia ruofei thought of this factor.

  The conditions of the two spaces seemed to be similar in all aspects. The only thing that he could not feel was the flow of time. Xia ruofei was in the spirit map space where time flowed twenty times faster. He felt exactly the same as the outside world.

  Thinking of this, Xia ruofei decided to do a test immediately.

  With a thought, he felt a familiar sense of dizziness. Xia ruofei was surprised to find himself in the room outside and not in the original space as he had imagined.

  This discovery surprised Xia ruofei.

  He picked up the small alarm clock from the bedside table and tried to communicate with the spirit map scroll with his mind. Soon, he found that he could enter the original spirit map space or the newly discovered space according to His will.

  It was clear that these two spaces were connected to each other, yet they were also relatively independent.

  Xia ruofei ordered in his mind. The next moment, he appeared in the newly discovered space.

  Xia ruofei was already very familiar with testing the flow of time. Before he entered the space, he had already checked the time on his alarm clock and phone to make sure that they were the same.

  And he would never bring his phone into the medium.

  Hence, after Xia ruofei confirmed the time on his alarm clock, he left the new space and returned to the outside world.

  After staying in the outside world for five minutes, Xia ruofei entered the new space again. He took a look at the clock and saw that five minutes had passed in the new space.

  As expected! RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

  The biggest difference between the two spaces was the flow of time!

  The flow of time in this new space was the same as the outside world.

  This discovery made Xia ruofei very excited. He thought of many possibilities.

  The flow of time in the original space was 20 times that of the outside world. He hadn't had time to test it after the evolution this time. If he was right, it should be 30 times.

  In the original space, it was definitely very suitable to plant some crops that required a particularly long time, such as slow - growing succulents or precious trees that needed hundreds of years or even hundreds of years to grow.

  However, the rapid flow of time also brought about a problem. Some animals or crops that needed a short time to mature were not suitable to stay in the original space.

  For example, if Xia ruofei kept lightning in the original space all year round, it would die of old age in no time.

  Another example was the vegetables in the space. The vegetables planted in the space would mature in a short time, which was a great help to Xia ruofei's capital accumulation. However, later on, he had to re - Plant them almost every one or two days.

  Hence, Xia ruofei had already started to reduce the amount of vegetables he planted in the interspace. He was satisfied as long as he could supply Xi jiangyue and Ling Ji restaurants. In the future, he would completely transfer the matter of growing vegetables to the Peach Blossom Farm in the outside world.

  With this new space where time flowed at the same rate, Xia ruofei could rear many animals. These animals would probably be as intelligent as lightning. He could even rear his own animal army, one that he could carry around with him.

  Besides, as the flow of time inside and outside was the same, Xia ruofei could stay in there for a longer period of time if he was safe. He could even sleep and rest there. The spiritual Qi here was rich, and the air was much better than the polluted air outside.

  He could even build his own paradise here.

  ……

  Xia ruofei thought of many possibilities and couldn't help but be elated.

  The original space was dedicated to cultivating precious species that required a long time, while the new space focused on plants and animals that didn't need a long growth period.

  The two could be said to complement each other.

  Xia ruofei vaguely felt that this new space was not as simple as the difference in the flow of time.

  This place was even more vast and had different terrains. There was also the mysterious stone tablet that was connected to him ... Xia ruofei felt that there were still many unknown in this space waiting for him to explore.

  However, he was not in a hurry. According to his experience after obtaining the spirit map scroll, as long as the space continued to evolve, the unknown would slowly shed its mysterious veil and gradually appear in front of him, just like the appearance of the new space today.

  However, thinking about leveling up, Xia ruofei had a headache.

  This upgrade had cost him seven million Yuan worth of Jade, and the next upgrade would probably cost him more than fourteen million Yuan ...

  Xia ruofei shook his head with a bitter smile and decided not to think too much for the time being.

  With a killing machine like the spirit map space, he would definitely be able to make money faster and faster. One day, he would be able to unravel all the secrets of the space.

  And maybe in the future, he could find something more suitable for the evolution of the space than Jade!

  Xia ruofei had a feeling that such a thing existed. He just needed a little luck.

  Perhaps the black rough stone that he had absorbed into the spirit map space during the last evolution was something that could evolve the space, unlike the Jade.

  After that, Xia ruofei left the medium. He would return to the medium the next day to collect the dried seeds.

  Xia ruofei kept the painting in his palm and went downstairs to look for Hu Zi's mother and Lin Qiao.

  After all, that raw stone could make the spirit map scroll vibrate on its own. Furthermore, Xia ruofei did not unseal it when he brought it back and directly let the scroll absorb it. He had no idea what was inside.

  Xia ruofei decided not to think too much about it. He took the small alarm clock and went from the new space to the original space to test the time flow.

  As he had expected, after the evolution, the time flow in the original space had become thirty times that of the outside world.

  This was undoubtedly extremely beneficial for the growth of Phoebe zhennan wood, truffle, and ginseng.

  Xia ruofei patrolled the original space and started to work. He had promised the workers that he would provide them with 'high - tech seeds'. He had already bought the seeds and stored them in the space. Now, he needed to complete the most important step, soaking the seeds with the Ravens.

  Xia ruofei had previously bought many plastic packing boxes of various sizes to keep in his interspace because these sort of packing boxes could be used in many situations.

  He took a dozen small tidying boxes and poured each kind of vegetable seed into one tidying box. Then, he took a large wooden bucket and began to prepare the petal solution.

  There were more seeds to be soaked this time. Xia ruofei used two petals to make a big barrel of solution.

  After he stirred the solution in the wooden bucket evenly, he poured it into a dozen small tidying boxes. Then, he left the space in a flash.

  He stayed in the outside world for a few minutes, which meant that a few hours had passed in the medium. The seeds should have fully absorbed the nutrients in the petal solution, so he returned to the original space.

  Xia ruofei laid a plastic sheet on the floor of the interspace and used a fence to scoop out all the seeds. He separated the seeds and spread them out on the plastic sheet, letting them dry naturally.

  He didn't waste the petal solution after soaking the seeds. He watered the Phoebe zhennan wood, the root of the oak tree, and the ginseng.

  After that, Xia ruofei left the medium. He would return to the medium the next day to collect the dried seeds.

  Xia ruofei kept the painting in his palm and went downstairs to look for Hu Zi's mother and Lin Qiao.
