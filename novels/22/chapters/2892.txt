2893 It’s fate (2)

While Luo Qingfeng was still in a state of shock, Xia ruofei had already flown over on his flying sword. He stopped above the deck of the yacht, jumped off the flying sword, and kept it in his dantian.

He waved at Luo Qingfeng and shouted,””Qingfeng! Come over! Come up and rest for a while!”

Only then did Luo Qingfeng come back to his senses. With a look of disbelief, he flew over on his flying sword. Even when he landed on the deck of the yacht and felt the yacht swaying with the waves, he still felt a strong sense of unreality.

Naturally, Luo Qingfeng could tell that Xia ruofei had stored the yacht in his storage treasure. Besides, Xia ruofei had said before he left that there was no need to worry about the storage treasure not having enough space. This meant that Xia ruofei must have brought a storage treasure with enough space.

However, Luo Qingfeng was still a little dumbfounded. The strange – looking ‘iron ship’ in front of him was more than ten meters long, but Xia ruofei’s storage artifact could actually fit it all in. There was obviously a lot of spare space. Xia ruofei had to transport a large number of supplies this time and also relied on this storage artifact. How big was the storage space of this storage artifact?

In comparison, the space in Luo Qingfeng’s own storage ring was pitifully small. The difference was like the difference between a thatched house and a luxurious Manor.

This yacht was the azmu Atlantis 34 that Xia ruofei had placed in the spirit map space. This yacht was considered to be of medium and small size among the azmu yacht series. It was a sports yacht and was not suitable for use in the distant sea. However, Xia ruofei only took it out to rest, so there was no problem.

There was a flying bridge on the deck. Xia ruofei did not need to drive the yacht, so he sat on the sofa on the deck.

He looked at Luo Qingfeng, who was standing there in a daze, and said with a smile,””Qingfeng, what are you doing? Come sit down and rest for a while! Aren’t you tired after flying for half a day?”

Luo Qingfeng seemed to wake up from a dream. He quickly bowed and said,””Thank you for your understanding, master!”

Then, he walked to the seat opposite Xia ruofei and sat down.

Xia ruofei sat comfortably on the soft sofa and looked up at the starry sky. He enjoyed the rare tranquility. Although the sound of the waves could be heard from time to time, it only served to enhance the quietness of the environment.

The last time he had this feeling was when Xia ruofei sailed the bigger azmu yacht out to sea.

Qingfeng Luo did not dare to speak as he was afraid of disturbing his master. He sat quietly to recuperate. Even though the spiritual energy in the air was very thin and impure, as an Aurous core stage cultivator, he could still absorb it directly, but the efficiency was very low.

However, Luo Qingfeng had the idea that it was better than nothing. He wanted to recover as much as possible so that he would not be a burden to his master in the following flight.

Time passed by quietly. Xia ruofei suddenly opened his eyes and looked confused. He asked,””Qingfeng, did you notice?”

Luo Qingfeng came out of his cultivation state and asked with a blank face,””Master, what did you find?”

Xia ruofei was slightly stunned. He had released his spiritual power to check the surroundings out of habit. In the end, he realized that at the edge of his spiritual Power’s sensing range, there was a luxury yacht floating with the waves.

That yacht was much bigger than the azmu Atlantis34 that Xia ruofei was on now. Even the bigger azmu yacht that Xia ruofei had been on the last time he went out to sea paled in comparison to the yacht he had just discovered.

According to the feedback from his spiritual power, the yacht was about 160 meters long and more than ten meters wide. It was obviously a super luxury yacht that could sail in the distant sea, and its endurance was much better than the azmu yacht he docked at the Yacht Club dock.

The Super – Luxury yacht was about ten kilometers away.

Xia ruofei did not expect that there would be other ships nearby when he was just looking for a place to rest. The sea was vast and boundless. The probability of this was almost like winning the lottery.

However, Luo Qingfeng did not notice anything. Xia ruofei was a little surprised.

It seemed that Luo Qingfeng’s spiritual energy sensing range was smaller than his own! Xia ruofei said to himself.

The position of the Super luxury yacht was basically at the edge of Xia ruofei’s spiritual power sensing range. If Luo Qingfeng could not sense it, it meant that it was already out of the range of his spiritual power.

“Ten kilometers to our North ... That’s about twenty miles. There’s a ship.” Xia ruofei chuckled.”This is too much of a coincidence!”

Luo Qingfeng was taken aback. His eyes widened as he asked,””Master, your spiritual power can cover an area of twenty miles?”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”if I use all my strength, I should be able to go further. However, 25 miles should be the limit.” This is also because after breaking through to the early Aurous core stage, my mental strength has also improved. Otherwise, the range would be even smaller. ”

Luo Qingfeng was speechless. Xia ruofei’s tone did not sound very satisfied. This was already very heaven – defying, okay?

Luo Qingfeng was too embarrassed to say that his spiritual power could cover less than 15 miles. Compared to Xia ruofei’s 25 miles, it was a huge gap!

They were both cultivators in the beginning stage of the Golden core realm, and Xia ruofei had just broken through yesterday. Why was there such a big difference between them? Luo Qingfeng was starting to doubt his life.

After Xia ruofei discovered the yacht, out of habit, he focused his spiritual power in that direction and investigated it in detail.

The corners of his mouth curled up slightly as he muttered to himself,””Interesting ...”

Then, Xia ruofei took out the blue travel immortal sword and said,””Qingfeng, you stay here to recover your energy. I’ll go and take a look!”

“Master,” Luo Qingfeng said subconsciously,”I’ll go with you!” If there’s anything, we can look out for each other!”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”there are only a few ordinary people on that ship. What could have happened?” I’ll be back soon. Don’t go back and forth, just rest here and recover! By the way, there should be some drinks in the refrigerator in the small kitchen at the stern. If you’re thirsty, you can take them and drink!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Yes! Thank you, master!” Seeing that Xia ruofei had already made his decision, Luo Qingfeng naturally did not dare to say anything more. He quickly nodded and agreed.

Xia ruofei leaped up and steadily stepped on the flying sword. Then, he activated his spiritual energy and vital Qi at the same time. The blue immortal sword immediately soared into the sky and brought Xia ruofei to the North at an extreme speed ...

At this time, the Super luxury yacht, which was about ten kilometers North of Xia ruofei’s azmu Atlantis34, was floating quietly on the sea. There was a circle of light blue atmosphere lights around the waterline of the yacht, dyeing the surrounding seawater a dreamy light blue. The entire yacht was brightly lit, and the four – story deck was brightly lit, but no one could be seen.

On the second floor of the yacht, a white man in his forties was sitting on the ground with a pale face. His back was against the railing of the deck, and his eyes were intertwined with despair, fear, and anger.

In front of him stood a white man who looked similar to him, but a few years younger. The white man held a large – caliber pistol in his hand, and four big men stood behind him.

The four men were all wearing waiter uniforms, but their white shirts were stained with blood. Of course, these were obviously other people’s blood. The four men were unscathed. They crossed their arms in front of their chests and looked at the middle – aged white man in front of them without saying a word.

“Davis, it’s no use even if you kill me!” The middle – aged white man gritted his teeth and said,”according to the federal law, after I die, all my assets will be inherited by my wife and child. You won’t get a single cent!”
