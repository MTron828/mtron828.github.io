Chapter 1833: Qingxue’s cultivation (3)

Translator: 549690339

“What ... What should I do?” Ling Qingxue asked nervously.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”don’t worry. I’ve checked your body. Your affinity with spiritual Qi should be relatively strong. This level might be difficult for others, but it’s nothing for you!”

Ling Qingxue finally relaxed a little.

Xia ruofei then started to teach Ling Qingxue the introductory pithy formula of the “absolute beginning Scripture”.

For people who were in contact with cultivation for the first time, these techniques and incantations were a little obscure, especially for modern people who had a weak Foundation in ancient language. They could not even recognize some of the rarely used words. Hence, Xia ruofei tried his best to explain the meaning of each incantation to Ling Qingxue in common language.

In fact, the most appropriate expression for the pithy formula of a cultivation method was naturally the original text. If it was “translated” into the modern Language, there would more or less be some deviation. In addition, everyone’s cultivation realm was different, and their understanding of the cultivation method was completely different. It was difficult to fully interpret the essence of the cultivation method.

Fortunately, this was only the introductory manual of the “Scripture of the primordium origin”. It was relatively simple. Besides, Xia ruofei was at Qi disciple Level 6 and had been cultivating with Song Wei for quite a long time. He had a deep understanding of this technique. At least, he was more than enough to guide Ling Qingxue.

After the first time, Ling Qingxue seemed to have understood a little, but Xia ruofei patiently explained it from the beginning.

This time, Ling Qingxue seemed to understand a little, but Xia ruofei did not rush her to find the Qi. Instead, he asked her to memorize the original text of the introductory art.

The introductory chant wasn’t long. Although it was a little obscure, with Ling Qingxue’s intelligence, it didn’t take long to memorize it even if she had to rote it.

Xia ruofei waited for Ling Qingxue to recite it proficiently before he explained it to her based on his own understanding.

Then, Xia ruofei said,”Qingxue, follow this chant and slowly sense the spiritual energy. You can recite the chant in your heart while you sense it. The effect might be better this way!” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Ling Qingxue was already eager to try. She immediately nodded and said,””Alright!”

Then, Ling Qingxue sat down cross – legged and closed her eyes.

Generally speaking, in the afternoon, the spiritual energy of the entire earth was quite mixed. In fact, only the four hours of midnight and Seveno’ clock were available. The spiritual energy was relatively pure and could meet the basic cultivation requirements.

It was several times more difficult to sense the spiritual energy at this time than at midnight or dawn.

Naturally, Xia ruofei was not willing to increase the difficulty of his girlfriend’s “game.” The reason why he let Ling Qingxue try it now must be because he was prepared.

Just as Ling Qingxue closed her eyes and tried to sense the spiritual energy, two diamond – shaped transparent crystals appeared in Xia ruofei’s hands. He placed the two crystals on either side of Ling Qingxue.

This chestnut – shaped crystal was naturally an extremely precious spirit crystal that contained a large amount of spirit Qi.

If a cultivator saw Xia ruofei using spiritual crystals to help a cultivator who had not even entered the sect to sense Qi, and he used two of them at once, he would definitely scold him for being a prodigal.

However, in order to ensure that his beloved woman could cultivate smoothly and find the sense of Qi in the shortest time possible to build her confidence in cultivation, how could Xia ruofei be stingy with two spiritual crystals?

Rich and generous, I’m just that willful!
