2003 Meeting but not knowing each other (1)

This scene happened so quickly that no one in the courtyard could react in time. No one could remember how the masked man had entered the courtyard. It was as if he had appeared out of thin air beside Toles.

It was not until Toles clutched his bleeding neck and fell to the ground that the people in the yard seemed to recover from the pause. The women let out ear – piercing screams in unison, while the men roared repeatedly. Their first reaction was to reach for their weapons at their waist.

Those who could attend the party at Toles ‘villa were basically members of mafia families. Their status in the Gelman family might not be as important as Toles’, but they were all armed, and many of them had guns.

Monica was also in a state of shock. Toles, who had brought her nightmares, was killed by the masked man with a wave of his hand like a chicken. Furthermore, the masked man was actually using the razor blade that she had brought in. She could not believe her eyes.

When her gaze fell on the masked man, she trembled and almost blurted out a name.

At this time, the masked man suddenly reached out and pulled out the pistol on Toles ‘waist. At the same time, he grabbed her waist and took her to the side.

Almost at the same time, Monica also heard the gunshot. She even saw the sparks from the bullet hitting the spot where she had been standing.

The gunshot brought her back to her senses.

Monica realized that even though Toles was dead, she was still in danger. She still had a slim chance of survival.

The sounds of gunfire and women’s screams filled the courtyard, making the scene very chaotic.

Monica was carried by the masked man and dodged left and right involuntarily. Several bullets brushed past her body and she was in danger.

The masked man did not say a word from the beginning to the end, but it gave Monica a great sense of security. It was as if she would be fine as long as she stayed by his side.

It was a state that was difficult to describe in words. A group of fierce gangsters were chasing them with guns, but Monica felt very calm and not afraid at all.

The masked man pulled her hand, and she immediately pounced toward the masked man.

She saw the masked man turn sideways and carry her on his back.

Then, Monica felt as if she was riding the clouds. The masked man stomped on the ground, and the two of them jumped at least three to four meters high. Without any equipment or run – up, such a jump completely violated the laws of physics. Not to mention carrying a person, even if they were to go to battle with light equipment, if they could jump so high, they could participate in an international competition.

Monica even saw masked man stomping on the head of a burly man when he was exhausted and falling. Then, he used the momentum to jump up again.

After a few ups and downs, the two of them had easily crossed the courtyard wall and jumped out of the encirclement. Monica could still faintly hear the flustered and exasperated shouts behind her.

The masked man didn’t stop. Instead, he carried Monica and went straight to the car park on the side of the villa.

He glanced around, then flashed to a black Mercedes – Benz. Out of all the cars, this was the only one with its engine on, and there was someone in it.

The Mafia wouldn’t give up so easily. He had to get out of the encirclement before they surrounded him again and leave this place safely. He couldn’t waste any time. It was obviously the most time – saving way to grab a car that still had its engine running.

The masked man opened the door of the passenger seat. A middle – aged man was trembling in fear, his body trembling like a sieve.

The masked man pulled the middle – aged white man out of the car with one hand.

The middle – aged white man quickly knelt down and begged for mercy.I beg you, please don’t kill me! I have no relationship with Toles!

Then, he saw Monica on the back of the masked man. As if he was holding onto a life – saving straw, he said,Monica! Quickly explain to your friend that we’re not on the same side as Toles! Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

No coincidence, no story.

In such a short period of time, the masked man had chosen this particular luxury car out of all the luxury cars. It was the car that the Grasso family had sent Monica here in.

The one who had just been pulled out and thrown to the ground by the masked man was the housekeeper of the Grao family. He was the head of the family’s most trusted person.

The masked man didn’t pay any attention to the Butler. He only coldly said one word to the driver in the driver’s seat,”out!”

The driver scrambled out of the car.

The masked man stuffed Monica into the car. As he closed the door, he pushed the engine cover with his hand and moved to the other side.

He quickly got into the car and started the engine.

When the Mercedes – Benz sped forward, the masked men closed the door at the same time.

From the moment the Butler was dragged out to the moment the driver was chased out to the start of the car, the entire process took less than five seconds. When Monica came back to her senses, the car was already speeding on the road like a wild horse.

Behind them, a group of gangsters fired at the car in anger, but their shots were not accurate at all. In addition, the masked man drove in a snake – like manner, so the chaotic gunfire did not even touch the paint on the car.
