Chapter 1650: Take the initiative (2)

This was a little too much! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

If they added another 30 or 40 million on top of this price, the two sides might still have a chance to negotiate. In fact, the bottom price that the senior management of Tang real estate had agreed on was 300 million.

Although the price was only 20 million Yuan lower than the actual market price, Tang real estate would still lose 110 million Yuan.

If he could negotiate 280 to 290 million with Xia ruofei and the others, there might still be room for negotiation.

However, when Xia ruofei came up and said that this was their bottom line and would not increase it by a single cent, the difference in opinions was too great.

Zhou Tianyu laughed bitterly and thought to himself that he shouldn’t have stopped them. The difference between the two sides was so big that there was no need to negotiate.

Xia ruofei looked at Liu haofan and Zhou Tianyu, who were dumbfounded, and said slowly,””Young master Liu, general manager Zhou, we naturally have our reasons for making this price. If you don’t mind, can I explain it to you?”

Liu haofan’s face darkened. He gritted his teeth and said,””I’m all ears!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Everyone knows that your company’s purchase price for this piece of land is falsely high. Under normal circumstances, its actual value is between 310 to 320 million.”

Liu haofan snorted softly. He did not refute Qianqian’s words, and he had no way of refuting her. He had indeed been a sucker back then.

However, he still couldn’t help but say in his heart,”That’s still far from 250 million. I’d like to see what you can say!

Xia ruofei continued.”Why did your company want to give up this land? I think we’re all smart people. There’s no need to point it out, right?”

Zhou Tianyu pretended to be confused,”CEO Xia, you’re talking about the rumors on the internet a few days ago, right?” You can’t use this kind of confusing thing as a reason to haggle over the price by tens of millions, right? Otherwise, it would be too farfetched ...”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”I’m sure young master Liu and general manager Zhou know very well whether it’s groundless or not. There’s no need to play riddles.” That’s a Yin gathering place, am I right?”

That’s right, Xia ruofei and the rest already knew how the metaphysics world defined the land after the natural array was activated.

Although Zhao Yongjun didn’t know what the Feng Shui Master Liu haofan had hired had said, it didn’t stop him from asking the relevant people to go to the scene to take a look.

Even the cultural environment consultants of other real estate companies could see the mystery of this land, which meant that not only a few top Fengshui Masters could see the yin gathering place.

Zhao Yongjun and the others also had connections in this area, so after they had people go to the scene to see, they naturally had the answer.

Xia ruofei’s words destroyed the last bit of hope in Liu haofan and Zhou Tianyu’s hearts. Their expressions turned ugly.

Xia ruofei smiled.”I’m sure you’ve hired a professional to take a look. Such an unsolvable Feng Shui situation has enveloped the entire land. Doesn’t that mean that its actual value has been reduced?”

Liu haofan snorted.”Director Xia, we don’t deny that there are some small problems with the land in the field of Feng Shui metaphysics. However, isn’t it a little too ridiculous to haggle the price of sixty to seventy million Yuan for such an empty and abstract argument?”

Xia ruofei revealed a confident smile and said,””Young master Liu, it’s not just an illusion. Some strange things have already begun to happen on that land. They’re the groundless rumors that director Zhou just mentioned on the internet.”

” In fact, we all know what a Yin gathering place means, ” he continued after a pause. ” This is also why the other real estate companies all gave up in the end even though they were a little tempted. ”

Liu haofan frowned and kept his mouth shut. He knew that Xia ruofei was telling the truth, but he was not willing to sell the land at such a cheap price. If it were not for the damn Feng Shui Bureau, the land would be worth at least four to five hundred million Yuan after two to three years!

Xia ruofei continued,” young master Liu, general manager Zhou, you may think that we’re taking advantage of the situation because the other companies are afraid to take over ...”

Liu haofan snorted and thought to himself, isn’t that so?

Zhou Tianyu smiled, ” I don’t dare, I don’t dare ... It’s a business negotiation! It’s normal for people to have differences in opinion!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,” actually, we’re already offering a good price ...”

Liu haofan almost slammed the table when he heard that. Could he be any more shameless? This is a price of conscience? then your conscience is too worthless, right?

Xia ruofei looked at Liu haofan and said, ” ” First of all, if we get this piece of land, it’s equivalent to shifting the risk of the yin gathering place onto us. It’s very likely that we’ll spend more than 200 million Yuan and get a piece of land that can only be used to build a Cemetery! ”

Liu haofan muttered in his heart,’ it’s not’ possible’, it’s’ certain’...’

Xia ruofei continued,” we’ve taken the risk. It’s not too much to ask for a discount, is it? ” This was the first. ” Secondly, after we get this piece of land, the first thing we have to do is to solve the Feng Shui Bureau problem. I believe you all know how difficult it is to deal with this Yin gathering place. To be honest, we’re not confident that we can solve this hidden danger. Even if we use some special methods to suppress it for a few years, the cost will be very expensive. We may have to pay an additional tens of millions of capital, and we’re also taking a huge risk of returning without any success. You have to give us a profit from this part of the money, right? ”

Zhao Yongjun wanted to laugh when he heard this. He felt that Xia ruofei had the potential to be a big liar. When they activated the array, they only bought some Chinese scholar trees and mirrors. Even if they used the best ones, they wouldn’t be worth much. Zhao Yongjun and the others spent less than 10000 Yuan. The Jade statue that Xia ruofei used might be worth more, but it couldn’t exceed 100000 Yuan.

It would probably cost about the same amount to reverse the formation, but Xia ruofei said he would spend tens of millions. He was really lying!

However, Xia ruofei’s words really scared Liu haofan and Zhou Tianyu.

At least, they no longer had indignant expressions on their faces. Instead, they showed a hint of struggle, and at the same time, they were also thinking quickly.

The negotiation had been going on for a long time, and they were basically playing cards.

After Zhou Tianyu and Liu haofan discussed in a low voice, they raised their heads and said,”President Xia, I admit that you have a point, but 250 million is too low. We can’t explain it to the Board of Directors ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”if we sell it now, we’ll only lose 160 million Yuan, and all the risk will be transferred to us.” If you still hold onto this piece of land, you may lose all 410 million in the future. I think the members of your company’s Board of Directors can’t even calculate such a simple account, right?”

Zhou Tianyu smiled bitterly,”that makes sense. However, we can’t do that. After all, we bought land ...”

“That’s because your company’s cultural environment consultant is incompetent!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s a fact now. You have to accept this result ...”

At this point, Xia ruofei saw that Liu haofan wanted to say something but stopped, so he laughed and said,””How about this! Today, young master Liu has personally come forward, so I’ll give young master Liu some face and add another 10 million! 260 million, this is already beyond our expectations, we can’t go any higher!”

Zhao Yongjun had also seen the situation of today’s negotiations and immediately said,””Haofan, director Zhou, we’re already very sincere with this price! You can discuss it, and if you can’t confirm it, you can report to the Board of Directors. On our side ... Just as RUO Fei said, it’s impossible to increase the price any further!”

Xia ruofei and Zhao Yongjun exchanged a look, then smiled and stood up.””I think ... Why don’t we do this for today? Brother Zhao and I are going to Pingchang District. There’s a piece of land there that’s pretty good. We have to go and inspect it as soon as possible ...”

After that, Xia ruofei and the other two picked up the folder in front of them, pushed away their chairs, and walked towards the door of the conference room.

He had only taken two or three steps when Liu haofan, who was opposite him, couldn’t help but shout,””Wait a moment!”
