2511 The mysterious power of the East (2)

“But Wu recovered in just six days! This was the truth! And the results of the examination just now showed that some of the small injuries on his body have healed. He’s now as strong as a bull!” Diego said excitedly,”he must have a way! This will be a revolutionary innovation for the recovery of sports injuries!”

As the team doctor, Diego knew Wu Lei’s physical condition the best. After all, he was the one who took part in Wu Lei’s transfer check – up the entire time. Hence, when he came to the hospital today for a full body examination, he decided to check on Wu Lei’s previous minor injuries as well. They were all contusions or physical injuries. They were not very serious injuries, but they would sometimes hurt faintly and even affect Wu Lei’s performance.

In the end, after today’s examination, except for his shoulder joint, which he was most concerned about, all the minor injuries on Wu Lei’s body had healed. It was as if Diego had found a treasure.

“Don’t be so excited! Don’t get too excited!” The interpreter quickly said,”I’ll ask him right away ...”

After that, the translator turned to Wu Lei.

Wu Lei saw how excited Dr. Diego was and how much he was talking about. He didn’t know what he was talking about, so he asked in confusion,””What’s wrong with doctor Diego? Is my examination result not too good?”

“No, no, no! Wu, the results show that you’re really close to being completely healthy!” The interpreter quickly said,”in the words of Dr. Diego, you’re as strong as a bull now!”

“So, I can participate in the team’s training?” Wu Lei asked in surprise.

“I don’t know about that, but I don’t think it’ll be a big problem judging from Dr. Diego’s condition,” the interpreter shrugged.

“That’s great!” Wu Lei could not help but wave his fist.

When he made the decision to accept the surgery, he actually had the intention to take a gamble. He did not gamble on the success rate of the surgery. The difficulty of the surgery itself was not too high, and the possibility of failure was not high. The only difference was the degree of perfection of the repair. He naturally gambled on whether the promised complete recovery within a week could be realized. This was because it sounded like a fantasy, but Wu Lei believed it for some reason.

Now, it seemed that he had made the right bet!

“Let’s not celebrate yet,”the interpreter said,” doctor Diego is going crazy! He asked me to ask you if you have any secret to your recovery. How can you increase the recovery speed by six or seven times?”

“I accepted the rehabilitation treatment of Traditional Chinese Medicine,” Wu Lei muttered to himself,”which included the external application of a pure Chinese medicinal ointment and the cooperation of acupuncture. However, please tell Dr. Diego that I’ve already promised the Chinese doctor not to reveal his name and identity. Please ask him not to ask for too many details ...”

Actually, the translator could more or less guess it. After all, he had been with Wu Lei for the past few days, and Xia ruofei had been visiting Wu Lei every day with the medicine box. No one else had come. Who else could this magical Chinese medicine doctor be other than Xia ruofei?

The translator had also returned to Spain from China not long ago. He knew Xia ruofei well. After all, Xia ruofei was a popular person on the Internet in China. Naturally, he had heard some rumors about Xia ruofei, including the rumor that Xia ruofei had personally developed the Jade skin cream. Now, it seemed that these rumors were not without reason!

As an expert in Huaxia, the translator was not prejudiced against Chinese medicine like a few Westerners. When he was in Huaxia, he had even experienced cupping and chinese massage, but he had never heard of such an immediate effect of Chinese medicine, so he was amazed.

In the face of doctor Diego’s anxious eyes, the interpreter translated Wu Lei’s words to him.

After hearing this, Diego was stunned. After a long while, he muttered to himself,”Chinese medicine is so magical. It’s indeed the mysterious power of the East ...”

The translator kept his professional ethics and did not reveal his guess. Although Diego was very tempted, he could not do anything if Wu Lei did not want to say more. He could only make up his mind to look for relevant information on Chinese medicine and do some research.

On the way back to the club, Wu Lei asked,””Doctor Diego, can I join the team’s joint training now?”

The team was preparing for the home game against valekano, and Wu Lei was in a very anxious mood.

“Of course!” Said Diego. Your body is completely fine! As the team doctor, I have the responsibility to report the players ‘physical conditions to the coaching staff in time. I should be the one to decide whether the players’ bodies are suitable for training and competition!”

Diego had a proud look on his face as he spoke.

Wu Lei was overjoyed,”thank you so much!” Doctor Diego!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Diego, who was sitting in the front passenger seat, turned his head and blinked at Wu Lei. He said,””You’re welcome, this is my job! And I think the parrot Legion needs new blood. If you can play, I hope you can perform well in the match against valekano this weekend. Of course, it would be even better if you score a goal!”

Parrots was the nickname of the Spanish club, and Diego was naturally a fan of the Spaniards. Otherwise, he would not have become the team’s doctor. It was hard to imagine a bar?a fan serving as the team’s doctor.

“Definitely!” Wu Lei clenched his fist and said.

The car first sent Wu Lei back to the hotel, then returned to the club.
