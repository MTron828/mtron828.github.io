Chapter 718: Chapter 492 – fruitful_2

A trace of disappointment flashed through Lin Qiao’s eyes, but it disappeared in a flash.

Feng Rao saw this and looked at Xia ruofei thoughtfully with a half – Smile, but she did not say anything.

Lin Qiao couldn’t wait to pick the lychees. Cao tieshu quickly said,”We still have to wait a little longer!”

After he finished speaking, Cao tieshu moved a ladder and placed it on a nearby lychee tree. Then, he used a pair of scissors to cut some leaves and placed them at the bottom of the basket.

Then, he came down and handed the scissors to Lin Qiao.”These lychees are very precious. You need to put something in the basket. Otherwise, they’ll rot easily after being rubbed.”

Lin Qiao took the scissors and climbed up the ladder nimbly.

Xia ruofei quickly went over to help hold the ladder and said,””Qiao’ er, slow down, don’t fall!” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“I’m fine!”Lin Qiao said with a smile.

The whole tree was filled with clusters of ripe red lychees. Lin Qiao quickly picked up one cluster and cut it off with a pair of scissors.

“Brother ruofei, catch it!” Lin Qiao said.

Xia ruofei reached out to take the heavy bunch of lychees and put them into the basket by his feet.

Lin Qiao picked the lychees very quickly because she could get any lychees on this tree.

The rate of bearing fruits on these lychees was also ridiculously high, almost twice as high as that of ordinary lychees.

......

This amount of yield surprised Cao tieshu, but he still had a trace of worry in his heart.

He had lived in the village for decades and was very clear that the soil and water in this mountainous area were not very good. He heard that there was a problem with the pH of the soil. In the past, some people had contracted it to plant fruit trees, but the fruits were all sour and astringent, and could not be swallowed at all.

These lychees, as well as the cherry trees on the other side of the mountain, bore fruits that were big and red. They looked extremely good, but Cao tieshu had no idea how they would taste.

He was worried that these were all embroidered pillows, bright on the outside, but in reality, they tasted extremely bad.

Then the fruit trees on this mountain, the initial investment would be wasted.

However, Lin Qiao didn’t think so much. She was happily picking lychees with a pair of scissors.

Very quickly, the small wicker basket that Cao tieshu brought was filled to the brim, and the lychees on this lychee tree did not seem to be lacking in any way.

Xia ruofei raised his head and shouted,”Qiao’ er, it’s almost done. It can’t fit anymore!”

Lin Qiao then got down from the tree, feeling unsatisfied.

This basket of lychees was bright red and exuded a natural fruity fragrance, which made people hungry just by looking at it.

Xia ruofei smiled and called Cao tieshu and Feng Rao over. He said,”Everyone, have a taste! This was personally picked by Qiao’ er!”

Xia ruofei said as he plucked the lychees and passed them to everyone.

Cao tieshu took the lychee and uneasily peeled off the outer skin, revealing the rich, round, white, and flawless flesh. At the same time, the fragrance of the fruit suddenly became stronger. He sniffed, gritted his teeth, and put the lychee into his mouth.

With a light bite, a sweet fruit juice immediately filled his entire mouth. This soft, fragrant, and sweet texture immediately made Cao tieshu’s spirit jolt. He could not help but chew a few more times, before spitting out a very small fruit core.

After eating this one, Cao tieshu couldn’t help but peel open the skin of the second lychee.

Feng Rao and Lin Qiao had also tasted the fresh lychees, and their eyes lit up.

“It’s so delicious! It was fragrant and sweet! “And there’s so much juice ...” Lin Qiao mumbled as she ate.

Feng Jing couldn’t help but praise,”Chairman, the quality of these lychees is so high!” I think it’s even better than the lychees sold in the premium fruit supermarket!”

Cao tieshu was also very excited.”Boss, these lychees are so delicious! I’ve never had such delicious lychees before!”

As someone from the southeast province, Cao tieshu had eaten many lychees before. However, the lychees produced by Tao Yuan farm gave him a completely different feeling. The natural and fresh fruit fragrance made him feel relaxed and happy.

On the other side, Lin Qiao kept eating lychees and couldn’t stop.

Seeing this, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but say,””Qiao’ er, don’t eat so much! This thing can get on fire! Aren’t you afraid of getting pimples?”

Lin Qiao gobbled up the food and said,”I don’t care if I have pimples, but I can’t let down good food ...”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry and said,”there’ll be cherries later!” Aren’t you going to save some of your stomach?”

Lin Qiao’s hand that was about to reach lychee retracted. She said,””That makes sense! Brother RUO Fei, let’s go pick some cherries!”

“Go! Let’s go see how cherry looks!” Xia Rufei said with a smile.

The group walked along the path of the orchard and headed to the other side of the mountain. Along the way, there were many fruitful lychee trees on both sides. The red lychees and the green leaves complemented each other, and it was a beautiful scene.

Cao tieshu carried the ladder, while Xia ruofei personally carried the small wicker basket.

There was half a basket of lychees in the basket, but Xia ruofei carried them with one hand as if they were nothing.

Soon, everyone arrived at the cherry Garden.

“It’s so beautiful!” Lin Qiao couldn’t help praising.

What came into view were rows and rows of cherry trees. These cherry trees were filled with purple – Red cherries.

The lychee’s skin was rough and had small pieces of shards, like a turtle’s carapace, so the visual effect was not as shocking as the cherry.

The cherries on this side were crystal clear, like rubies in the green sea.

The cherry fruits here were especially large, much larger than ordinary cherries. They were almost the size of a ping pong ball.

The sight of the fruits hanging from the tree was visually impactful.

Having tasted the top – grade lychees, Cao tieshu was now more confident in these cherries. He jogged over and set up a ladder on the trunk of a cherry tree.

In fact, the cherries drooped down, so they could be picked even if they were standing on the ground. However, it was obviously more convenient to pick them with a ladder.

Lin Qiao climbed up the ladder with the big scissors without any warning.

The cherries weren’t like the lychees, which had a large cluster. Normally, one could pick two or three with one cut. However, Lin Qiao was very fast. The whole tree was full of ripe cherries, which were purple – red in color. There was basically no need to pick, so the small basket was filled up very quickly.

Of course, the lower half was filled with lychees and about half a basket of cherries.

Xia ruofei called Lin Qiao down and took the cherries to the tap by the roadside. After washing them, he invited everyone to taste them.

Xia ruofei also picked up a big cherry and put it in his mouth.

The fresh red and tender fruit was full of juice. Xia ruofei took a light bite and the sweet juice immediately filled his mouth. This breed of cherry was moderately soft and hard. After absorbing the spirit Heart Flower petal solution in the irrigation water all year round, this cherry was full of rich fruit fragrance. The texture was very delicate and had a fresh taste, making people want to eat it again.

Even Xia ruofei couldn’t help but eat a few.

Lin Qiao and Feng Rao couldn’t help but eat four or five in a row. They couldn’t stop eating as if they had eaten Stride Gum.

Cao tieshu was also eating with great relish. However, he was also a little restrained in front of his boss. After eating a few, he was too embarrassed to take more.

“Delicious! It’s so delicious!” Lin Qiao said,”brother ruofei, these cherries are so sweet! And it’s very flavorful!”

“The fruit fragrance is very rich!” Feng Rao couldn’t help but praise,”the taste is also very special. It’s sweet and delicious!” It’s much more delicious than the cherry in the United States or the red embroidered ball in Japan!”

“What do you think of this batch of fruits from our Orchard?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“Do you still need to say that? One word, awesome!” Lin Qiao gave him a thumbs up.

“Boss, I’ve always been worried that the soil in this Orchard isn’t good,” Cao tieshu also said. “The fruits we grow can’t be eaten! I didn’t expect these cherries and lychees to be so delicious. It’s really unexpected!”

“It’s the same as our company ‘s,” Feng Jing said with a smile.”As always, we only produce quality products!”

“OK! Then what we need to do next is to sell these high – Quality fruits for the price they deserve!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’ll assign the work now!”
