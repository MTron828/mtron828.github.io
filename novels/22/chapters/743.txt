Chapter 744: Good intentions (1)

It was now evening, and although the nightclub was already open, it was still far from the peak of traffic, so it seemed a little deserted. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

As soon as Xia ruofei entered the door, a welcoming lady in light clothing came up and asked respectfully,””How many gentlemen?”

“Open a mid – sized bag for me,” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

“Alright, please wait a moment!” The hostess said, then she turned to the bar and said loudly,”a medium – sized private room!”

“Sir, please place your order here.” The hostess said politely.

Xia ruofei nodded and asked,””Is Room 605 empty? If it’s possible, I want this one. ”

Lei Hu had already found out in the afternoon that after Lin Qiao’s class gathering ended, they would continue singing at Haojue nightclub. The person in charge of booking the private rooms was Xue Fei, and he had reserved Room 607.

Room 605 was right next to Room 607.

The hostess was slightly surprised, but she was not too surprised, because many regular customers had their favorite private rooms. As long as the private room was not booked, the nightclub would try to meet the reasonable requirements of the guests.

“Has Room 605 been booked?” The hostess immediately turned to the bar counter and asked.

After getting a negative answer, the hostess immediately asked the staff at the bar to book room 605 for Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei added,”you can get me a fruit plate and snacks first. Also, I’ll get a bowl of seafood noodles. I’ll pay for them all.”

Xia ruofei had not had dinner yet and was prepared to make do with it.

......

“Alright!” The hostess said happily and immediately started to make arrangements for Xia ruofei.

They loved this kind of customer the most. If they were allowed to make arrangements, they could naturally arrange for more expensive items and more items. This way, their Commission would naturally be higher.

The things in KTVs and nightclubs were naturally several times more expensive than in other places. The cost of the private room and snacks was more than a thousand Yuan. Xia ruofei did not care about this small amount of money and paid the bill with his card.

Soon, everything was arranged. A waiter came to lead Xia ruofei to the elevator and turned on the lights and sound system. After a while, fruit plates and snacks were served.

Xia ruofei picked up the bowl of steaming seafood noodles and started eating.

At this moment, there was a light knock on the door of the private room, and then a woman with heavy makeup walked in with a big smile.

Xia ruofei put down his big bowl and asked lightly,””Is there something?”

The woman walked in front of Xia ruofei coquettishly and smiled in a flattering manner. She asked,””Boss, I’m the foreman on the sixth floor. Do you need a little sister here? The girls in our Haojue nightclub are all pretty, with good figures and good looks ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and interrupted her. Then, he took out his wallet and casually took out a small stack of hundred – Yuan bills and handed them over. He said,”I just need a quiet environment. I don’t want to be disturbed by anyone.”

The woman was stunned for a moment before she quickly reacted and took the money from Xia ruofei. She felt the thickness of the money and smiled.”I understand! Understood! Don’t worry, I promise that no one will disturb you!”

Xia ruofei nodded and looked at the TV screen.

The woman immediately bowed and left the room without a word, closing the door behind her.

Finally, it was quiet.

Xia ruofei picked up the bowl again and gobbled up the big bowl of noodles. Then, he took out a tissue and wiped his mouth. He pressed the service button and asked the waiter to take the bowl away.

The first thing Xia ruofei did after dinner was to check the empty private room to make sure that there was no recording equipment.

The experienced Xia ruofei was very serious when he did this. He checked the chandeliers, air vents, under the sofa, and other places that were easy to miss. He was meticulous.

This was a good habit he had developed in the Army. He would not take it lightly just because it was easy.

After a careful inspection, Xia ruofei finally confirmed that there was no equipment in the room that could take secret photos or videos. Or rather, the probability was extremely low.

It was rare to see a camera that could escape Xia ruofei’s eyes.

Then, Xia ruofei went to the private room’s bathroom. After locking the door, he used his mind and Hornet started to appear in his palm. If this scene was seen by anyone, they would be shocked speechless. It was more magical than magic.

After leaving the spirit map space, the bees flew around Xia ruofei. These bees were different from the rest.

Each of them had a small antenna on their head. If you looked closely, you would see that they were carrying a super – tiny camera the size of an adult’s finger on their back. The camera was fixed to the hornet’s body with a small black strap.

These Hornets were selected by Xia ruofei yesterday. They were the thickest of the first batch of Hornets to enter the spirit map space. Each of them was bigger than an adult’s thumb.

Therefore, these super – tiny cameras were fixed on top. Although it was a little awkward for them to fly, it would not affect their mobility.

This was an idea that Xia ruofei had come up with in his office yesterday afternoon.

These Hornets had been living in the medium for a long time. Besides, Xia ruofei’s spiritual power was much stronger than before, so he could easily control them.
