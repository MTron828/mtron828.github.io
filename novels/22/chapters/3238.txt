3239 Facts speak louder than words (2)

It was the first time in his life that Elon Musk had received acupuncture. He didn’t expect that the scary – looking silver needles would not only not hurt, but also give him a feeling of floating. This feeling was even more comfortable than the feeling of smoking marijuana when he was young.

Elon Musk could not help but close his eyes.

After Xia ruofei was done with the needles, she deftly removed the silver needles, disinfected them again, and put them back into the needle bag.

He then said,”Mr. Masker, it’s done.” How do you feel?”

Only then did Elon Musk open his eyes. He realized that the acupuncture had been completed, and the feeling of soreness, swelling, and heat at the place where the needle had been inserted was indeed slowly fading.

Elonmask felt that he had not had enough, and blurted out,””So fast?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Traditional Chinese Medicine is all about fairness and gentleness. It’s best if it’s just right. If the acupuncture time is too long, it may backfire.” Mr. Masker, please feel it. If there are no accidents, the tinnitus should have improved. ”

It was only then that elonmask remembered the important matter. He quickly closed his eyes and felt it.

Mannu could not help but laugh.”I admit that your performance is very good. However, you want to achieve the purpose of treatment with such a simple injection? aren’t you being too whimsical?”

“Shut up!” “What’s wrong?” shouted elonmask with a frown.

Mannu could not help but be stunned, and he looked at Elon Mask with his mouth slightly open.

With an unhappy expression, elonmask said,””Dr. Mannu, please keep quiet. I’m feeling if the tinnitus is getting better ...”

Tinnitus. If it was in a relatively noisy environment, it was basically impossible to feel any abnormalities. Only when the environment was quiet would the sound of tinnitus be infinitely amplified.

Elon Musk was carefully feeling if his tinnitus had been relieved, but Mannu kept on chattering at the side. He could not help but reprimand him.

Only then did Mannu react, his face alternating between red and white as he said,””I’m sorry, Mr. Masker ...”

Elon Musk waved his hand and said,””It’s nothing. Please keep quiet, everyone. Thank you!”

The room suddenly fell silent, and only the faint sound of breathing could be heard.

Although Mannu did not dare to speak anymore, he still looked at Xia ruofei with disdain. He did not believe that acupuncture alone could solve the problem of tinnitus.

Elonmask tilted his head and felt it for a while, and grams also looked at him nervously. After all, this was not only related to whether the problem of Elon Musk’s tinnitus could be solved. More importantly, if Xia ruofei’s superb medical skills were proven, little X’s survival rate would increase greatly!

However, in order not to affect elonmask, he did not dare to speak.

After a long while, a hint of excitement flashed in elonmask’s eyes as he said,””Everyone, I’m very sorry, but I have to leave for a while! Please wait here for a few minutes, I’ll be back soon!”

“My dear ...” Gramus asked worriedly.

Elonmask smiled and patted gramus ‘hand.””It’s alright, my dear. Take care of the guests. I’ll be back soon!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

After he finished speaking, Elon Musk looked at Xia ruofei again.

“Please!” Xia ruofei smiled.

Elon Musk quickly walked out of the room, then passed through the long corridor and took the elevator to the basement.

There was a very advanced film and music Hall here.

In order to have the best viewing experience, the facilities in the film and entertainment Hall were very advanced, including sound insulation.

Even the walls were made of very professional sound – absorbing materials.

It could be said that as long as the door was closed, the inside would be absolutely quiet.

Elon Musk pushed open the door and walked into the studio with excitement and anxiety. After he closed the door, he went straight to a seat in the middle of the room and sat down, quietly enjoying the music.

In fact, when he was upstairs just now, elonmask could no longer feel his tinnitus.

However, he was worried that it was his own illusion and that the surrounding sound was too noisy, so he could not hear the ringing.

In fact, this was the case of being too concerned. He had been suffering from tinnitus for the past few days. After solving the problem, he could not believe the truth of the matter.

Elon Musk was now sitting in the studio. He could even hear a pin drop on the ground, but he still couldn’t hear any tinnitus.

In the past, in such a quiet environment, the low – frequency rumbling in his left ear was enough to drive him crazy. If the high – frequency sound like the chirping of cicadas was added to his right ear, it would be a sour feeling.

Now, that annoying, never – ending voice had finally disappeared.

Elon Musk almost burst into tears.

He sat in the soft first – Class seat for a long time before he finally confirmed this fact.

For the first time, he felt that peace was wonderful.

Elon Musk remembered that Xia ruofei and the others were still waiting upstairs. He could not be bothered to enjoy the silence any longer. He quickly got up and left the studio. He took the elevator back upstairs and walked into the room next to little X.

Xia ruofei smiled as he looked at Elon Musk, who pushed the door open and entered.

Xia ruofei had already used his spiritual power to detect Elon Musk’s actions earlier on, so he was very clear about what he was doing.

As soon as he entered the door, elonmask said excitedly,””Doctor Xia, this is amazing! My tinnitus has completely disappeared! Even in the quietest environment, I can’t feel a tingling in my ears!”

Hearing this, Mannu gasped and revealed a look of disbelief.

At this moment, Xia ruofei had already ignored Mannu. He smiled and said to Elon Musk,””Mr. Masker, I don’t think you have any more doubts about the effect of acupuncture now, right?”

“Of course!” “This is the most amazing medical skill I have ever seen!” Chinese medicine is simply too shocking!”

“My dear,” gramus said in surprise.”The symptoms of the tinnitus have really disappeared?”

Elon Musk nodded and said,””Yes! I just went to the recording room downstairs for a while, and the ringing in my ears is completely gone!”

“Heavens! This is amazing!” He was so excited that tears welled up in his eyes, and he used ‘Auntie’ a few times to express his feelings.

On one hand, she was happy for Elon Musk, but more so because of Xia ruofei’s magical acupuncture skills, which had greatly increased her confidence. She was already full of hope for the treatment that little X was going to receive.

Mannu’s face was pale as he muttered to himself,””Impossible ... Impossible ... This doesn’t make any sense ...”

It was only then that Elon Musk noticed Mannu’s existence. His tone was a little cold as he said,””Dr. Mannu, the truth is here. I think you should put away your prejudice against Chinese medicine!”

Mannu’s entire body quivered, and then he said dejectedly,””I understand, Mr. Masker. I apologize for my previous remarks. ”

...

“I think ...” Elon Musk said,”the person you should apologize to is Dr. Xia.”

Mannu’s face turned even uglier, but he still braced himself and said to Xia ruofei unwillingly,””Doctor Xia, I’m sorry.”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ll give you a piece of advice on behalf of China’s Chinese medical field.” We Chinese are all about being inclusive. I think doctor Mannu can learn more about Chinese medicine when you have time, it might be helpful to your work. ”

Mannu squeezed out a smile and said,””I will. Thank you for your suggestion.”

After saying that, Mannu took a deep breath and said to Elon Musk,””Mr. Masker, I don’t think I’m suitable for the position of your private doctor ...”
