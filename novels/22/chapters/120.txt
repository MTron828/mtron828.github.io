Seeking first order, seeking guaranteed monthly tickets! When Dean Qin saw the breathing, heartbeat, blood pressure, pulse, and other indicators on the ECG monitor were stable, he felt like he was in a dream. He had been a doctor for decades, but he had never seen such a magical or even strange thing. Meanwhile, Xia ruofei was still feeding MA Xiong the medicine. The reason he didn’t ask Dean Qin to intubate MA Xiong was because he had a lot of confidence in the petals of the flower. He had absorbed the petals before, so he didn’t need to consume them. He could directly use his body to touch the petals and they would be absorbed into his body. Although the petals had dissolved into the medicinal soup, their basic attributes should not change. Hence, when Xia ruofei fed MA Xiong a small spoonful for the first time, his body had already absorbed the contents of the petals before the medicine entered his stomach. As Xia ruofei continued to feed him the medicine, MA Xiong’s body continued to absorb the components of the petals of the wondrous flower. In fact, he had already recovered from his deep coma and started to subconsciously swallow. As he continued to drink the medicinal soup, MA Xiong’s physical condition naturally began to recover quickly. Xia ruofei had used an entire petal of the strange flower when he saw that his condition was so serious. Ma Zhiming saw Dean Qin’s big reaction, and he couldn’t help but ask nervously,”Dean Qin, what’s wrong? Did daddy ...” “Master Ming, Mr. Ma’s vital signs are stabilizing. This ... This ... This is unbelievable!” Dean Qin said excitedly. Dean Qin’s decades of medical experience was completely overturned by this iron – like fact. “Does this mean that daddy will wake up soon?” Ma Zhiming was overjoyed upon hearing this and asked. Dean Qin, is my dad okay?” “Well ...” Dean Qin smiled bitterly and said,”such a serious cerebral hemorrhage will leave some aftereffects ...” He looked at Xia ruofei when he said this, not very confident. MA Xiong was basically a death sentence in the medical world, but Xia ruofei had saved him from death’s door with a dose of medicine. This kind of medical skill was simply unpredictable. Who knew if there would be more miracles? “After – effects?” Ma Zhiming quickly asked after hearing that. Will there be any side effects?” Dean Qin thought for a bit and said,””It’s hard to say ... The structure of the brain is too complicated. There are still too many unsolved mysteries about the brain for modern human science ...” “Dean Qin, just tell me directly. What kind of side effects will there be under normal circumstances?” Ma Zhiming frowned and asked. “It depends on the degree of brain damage. The most serious case is to become a vegetable.” Dean Qin said,”many patients with cerebral hemorrhage have stable vital signs after the acute stage, but they remain in a coma for a long time. They might never wake up.” Dean Qin paused and said,””If the patient is in a better condition, he might be able to wake up, but he might suffer from hemiplegia, loss of language function, or memory damage. All of these are hard to say ...” Ma Zhiming’s face became very serious, and Dean Qin tried to comfort him,””Young master Ming, perhaps Mr. MA is a lucky man and will recover? Don’t think too much about it! Originally, for someone like Mr. MA who fell into a deep coma in such a short period of time, the death rate was as high as 95%. Isn’t it developing in a good direction now?” “We can only think of it this way ...” Ma Zhiming said dejectedly. At this moment, Xia ruofei had already finished the bowl of medicine for MA Xiong. He placed the bowl on the bedside table and said,””There won’t be any side effects.” “What?” Ma Zhiming was stunned. “Don’t worry so much, there won’t be any side effects. ” Xia ruofei said with certainty. “How is that possible?” Dean Qin couldn’t help but exclaim,”Mr. Ma’s brain damage is more serious. Many injuries are irreversible. How can there be no sequelae?” These words were blurted out by him, and he realized that it was a little inappropriate after he finished speaking. He quickly explained,””Master Ming, I ... It’s not that I don’t want Mr. MA to be well, but ...” Ma Zhiming waved his hand. He did not mind Dean Qin’s slip of the tongue. Instead, he looked at Xia ruofei excitedly and asked,””Xia Sheng, really? Will my dad really not have any side effects?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Won’t we know when we wait and see? Let’s just wait here for a while! Old master Ma should be waking up soon. ” What a joke, a whole strange flower petal could even cure his Lou Gehrig’s disease, and the treatment this time had already seen the results. How could there be any sequelae? “Are you saying that my daddy will wake up soon?” Ma Zhiming asked in surprise. Dean Qin’s eyes were wide open, as if he had heard a fantasy story. If MA Xiong didn’t drink the medicine and his vital signs didn’t stabilize immediately, Dean Qin would think that Xia ruofei was a liar, and a Bad Liar. However, he was not sure now, especially when he saw how certain Xia ruofei was. Xia ruofei smiled and did not explain further. He pulled a chair over and sat down first. Dean Qin and Ma Zhiming were staring at MA Xiong nervously. Ma Zhiming was full of hope, while Dean Qin had mixed feelings. His rationality told him that it was impossible, but deep down, he wanted to witness the great medical miracle with his own eyes. Three minutes had passed. These three minutes were as difficult for Ma Zhiming as three years. He squatted in front of the hospital bed and looked at his father without blinking. Suddenly, MA Xiong’s fingers moved slightly. Ma Zhiming stood up all of a sudden. He rubbed his eyes hard, afraid that it was an illusion. However, MA Xiong’s fingers moved again. This time, all five of his fingers were clenched into a fist. Ma Zhiming pounced on MA Xiong excitedly and grabbed his hand. He shouted softly,”Daddy! Daddy ...” Dean Qin’s mouth was wide open, and he couldn’t believe his eyes. MA Xiong’s eyelids twitched and he opened his eyes with difficulty. When he saw Ma Zhiming for the first time, he asked very weakly,”What about me? Where was this place? Didn’t you go back to the mainland with Huixin?” “Daddy, you suddenly fainted at home. I rushed back after receiving a call from the mainland ... You scared me to death, you know ...” Ma Zhiming said with tears streaming down his face. “Isn’t daddy fine now?” MA Xiong said with a smile. “Young master Ming, Mr. Ma’s current condition is the best for him to control his emotions,” Dean Qin quickly said. “Okay, okay, okay ...” Ma Zhiming quickly said,”daddy, you just rest well. You must be calm ...” MA Xiong smiled and looked at Dean Qin. He said,””Dean Qin, thank you for your hard work ...” “Mr. MA, I’m sorry!” Dean Qin quickly said. Our skills are limited, and we can’t do anything about your condition. The one who really saved you is this Mr. Xia!”
