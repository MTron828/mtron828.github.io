Chapter 542: Fame that shakes the three mountains (2)

Although it sounded like he had been promoted by two ranks, from a core salesman to a manager, how could a winery on the verge of bankruptcy compare to Ling Ji F & B, which was at the height of its power and had assets worth hundreds of millions?

For a period of time, Li Jing kept asking himself if he had gotten into trouble at work or offended someone, which was why he had been sent to the winery.

Those in sales were all sophisticated and had their own way of dealing with people. Li Jing knew that he was quite popular in the company and Chairman Ling had even praised him for his outstanding performance. He could not figure out why he was kicked out of the company and sent to this lousy winery.

If the boss had invested a lot in this winery and was ready to start a big business, it would have been fine, but it was not like this at all!

Other than a new batch of equipment, the winery did not make any other big moves. Not to mention a large – scale bombardment of advertisements, even the name of the wine was still Drunken Eight Immortals, and the packaging style had not changed much.

Although the old brand Drunken Eight Immortals had a long history, its market situation had been declining day by day. Even in Sanshan city, its sales volume had dropped drastically.

What made Li Jing’s head hurt even more was that after the winery changed owners, many of its original partners had terminated their cooperation and returned a lot of old – packaged wine.

Li Jing had been so worried that his hair had almost turned white. He had begged his grandfather and grandmother to treat people to meals and drinks, and finally opened up some channels.

However, these channels were still pitifully small compared to the output of the winery. Not long ago, the winery’s first batch of liquor was out of the factory. This batch of Drunken Eight Immortals liquor, which had been newly packaged, contained 100 tons of liquor, a total of 200000 bottles and more than 30000 boxes.

How long would it take for the market to digest so much white wine? Li Jing was having a headache.

What made him even more mad was that, in his opinion, it was just a change in packaging, but the price of the new Drunken Eight Immortals liquor had been greatly increased to a retail price of 150 yuan a bottle.

Li Jing even thought that the wise and brilliant Chairman Ling must have taken the wrong medicine to make such an absurd decision.

He was really afraid that there would only be a few boxes on the sales report in a month. If that happened, his lifelong reputation would be ruined ...

In fact, Li Jing did not see any hope at all. He had opened up some channels with great difficulty, but he had only digested a few hundred boxes in total. Compared to the total of more than 30000 boxes, it was really a drop in the bucket.

Moreover, these were only available on the shelves through the Super – merchant channels. Li Jing had no idea if these wines could be sold or how much they could sell.

Li Jing had been restless in the office for the past few days, and he was not in the mood to go out and run business.

Li Jing did not know that drunken eight immortal, who had quietly replaced the brand with a new one, would soon cause his jaw to drop in shock ...

……

Yong Hui supermarket.

The retired cadre, old Li, was shopping in the supermarket with a basket.

Every afternoon at this time, he would walk from his house three kilometers away to buy groceries. On the one hand, the doctor said that walking quickly was good for his health. On the other hand, most of the groceries were on discount during this time. Although his pension was not small, old Li, who had been thrifty his whole life, was used to saving as much as he could.

One of old Li’s old classmates was traveling to Sanshan from Gannan province today, so he had bought more ingredients and was preparing to hold a simple family dinner at home to entertain his old classmate.

After buying the groceries, old Li thought of his classmates who had not seen each other for many years. They would definitely have to drink during dinner, so he took his basket and strolled to the alcohol section.

Old Li couldn’t help but shake his head when he saw the intimidating prices of those “high – Quality white wines.” He slowly walked to a shelf in the corner and his eyes lit up.

“Did drunken eight immortal change his packaging?” old Li muttered to himself.

A look of reminiscence appeared in his eyes, as if he was reminiscing about the time when they had shared a bottle of Drunken Eight Immortals together. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Then, old Li saw the price on the label.

“150!”Old Li was stunned for a moment,”I didn’t expect that even drunken eight immortal would raise the price. Sigh!” The price of everything is really going up now ...”

Old Li hesitated in front of the shelf for a long time before finally saying to himself,””Forget it, I’ll just buy one bottle! It’s been a long time since I got drunk on the Eight Immortals ...”

Compared to those branded white wines, although the price of Drunken Eight Immortals had been significantly increased, it was still relatively affordable. Although there were also white wines that cost hundreds or even tens of Yuan, Drunken Eight Immortals was the legacy of the older generation. Under the condition that the cost was not much different, old Li still chose Drunken Eight Immortals.

Old Li reluctantly picked up a bottle of Drunken Eight Immortals from the shelf and lined up to pay the bill with his basket.

At night, at old Li’s house.

Old Li’s old classmate brought his wife to his house. Old Li personally prepared a table of food. He brought his son and daughter – in – Law and sat around the table with his old classmate and wife. They began a family dinner with the theme of reminiscing about the past.

“Guiguo, open the wine!” Old Li said happily,”Xin Qiang, do you still remember the time we drank together?”

“Why don’t you remember?” Old Li’s old classmate laughed and said,”it’s Drunken Eight Immortals! It’s 2.30 yuan a bottle, and I finished half a bottle by myself, haha!”

“I specially went to buy the Eight Immortals drunk today, you better drink a few cups!” Old Li said happily.

Seeing that his old classmate still remembered the wine from back then, old Li felt that he had made the right choice by choosing Drunken Eight Immortals today.

“Yo! The winery is still there!” Old Li’s classmate said in surprise,”then I’ll have to try it ...”
