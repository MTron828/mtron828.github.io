Chapter 316: A sudden thought (1)

“Thank you for your hard work, brother Xia!” Elder Tang sat down with a smile. Xia ruofei gestured for Liang Weimin and Yuan Shan to take their seats as well. Then, he sat down beside elder Tang. He unscrewed the cap of the bottle and said with a smile,””Old man, have some wine for lunch!” “Drink some!” Elder Tang nodded. I’m so happy today! Let’s drink some wine to celebrate ...” Liang Weimin looked at the porcelain bottle in Xia ruofei’s hand and asked curiously,””Ruofei, this wine of yours ... I don’t think I’ve ever seen it before!” Liang Weimin was also a wine lover. With his net worth in the hundreds of millions, he had seen all kinds of good wine. However, he had never seen the wine in Xia ruofei’s hands, so he was a little curious. “This is my homemade white wine. Please have a taste!” Xia ruofei smiled. At this moment, Xia ruofei had already opened the bottle and the strong aroma of the wine filled the restaurant. “This wine is so fragrant!” Even Yuan Shan, who didn’t drink much, couldn’t help but sniffle and say in surprise. Old master Tang and Liang Weimin’s eyes lit up. These two were experts in wine country. Just by smelling the wine, they knew that the bottle of wine in Xia ruofei’s hand was not simple. Xia ruofei personally poured wine for old master Liang, Liang Weimin, and his wife. Then, he raised his glass and said,”Old man, uncle, aunty, Welcome to the Farm! Come, let’s go first!” “Cheers!” “Cheers!” Other than Yuan Shan, who only had a small taste, the three men raised their heads and drank the wine in one go. After drinking the wine, elder Tang and Liang Weimin were both stunned. Then, they shouted in unison,””Good wine!” “Ruofei, this wine is sweet and rich with a long aftertaste. It’s really good wine!” Liang Weimin said,”the years of Maotai I’ve drunk can’t even compare to this!” “Brother Xia, you’ve really made me look at you in a new light!” Elder Tang also praised,”to be able to grow such delicious vegetables and brew such a fragrant wine, I’m truly impressed!” “Old master, you’re too kind!” Xia ruofei chuckled as he filled everyone’s glasses.””Come, come, come. Don’t just drink. Try my food!” Elder Tang looked at the beautiful Taoyuan vegetables and immediately picked up his chopsticks. He picked up a few pieces of cabbage and put them in his mouth. He chewed a few times and his eyes lit up.”No wonder paradise vegetables is so famous. The taste of this cabbage is really good! It’s crisp and sweet, and the fragrance of the vegetables itself is so strong!” Liang Weimin and Yuan Shan had both eaten Taoyuan vegetables before, but after they tried Xia ruofei’s food, they still looked like they were enjoying it. “Ruofei, your cooking seems to be even more delicious than the Taoyuan vegetables I had at the West River Moon Club!” Yuan Shan said. “It seems that brother Xia’s cooking skills are not bad!” Elder Tang laughed.”Even the head chef of the club can’t compare to him!” Xia ruofei only smiled and did not reply. He knew very well that Yuan Shan had that feeling mainly because of the difference in ingredients. The ingredients that Xia ruofei took out this time were all watered with the petal solution and planted in the medium. They were originally kept for his own consumption, so the quality was much higher than the vegetables supplied to the two restaurants in batches. Moreover, because it had absorbed the components of the petals of the strange flower, if ordinary people used it all year round, it would definitely be very beneficial to the body. Of course, the benefits that this little bit of petal brought to Xia ruofei could be ignored. He had absorbed a lot of the petals. Following that, the three of them tried the other dishes. Naturally, they were all full of praise, especially for elder Tang, who was eating the Taoyuan vegetables for the first time. He gobbled up the food and didn’t even bother to drink the fine wine in front of him. After eating a few mouthfuls of food and a few dumplings, elder Tang sighed,””Brother Xia, your paradise vegetables has really given me a big surprise! I’m very envious of you now ...” “The old man’s wealth is comparable to a country’s and his family’s wealth is in the hundreds of millions. What do I have that’s worthy of your envy?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile. “You have a small farm of your own, facing the sea every day, leisurely and carefree. You can also eat such delicious delicacies and drink top – Quality wine at any time. Even the gods wouldn’t want to exchange for such a life!” Elder Tang sighed. “Then you’re welcome to visit us often, old man!” Xia ruofei smiled.”The gates of Taoyuan farm are always open for you!” “I’m going back to United States a few days!” Elder Tang smiled bitterly.”People in the business world can’t do as they please! I’m already so old, and I have to make arrangements a long time in advance if I want to come home to see you. I have to count my schedule and deal with a lot of things after I go back ... I have to make money every day, and this kind of life is actually quite boring!” Xia ruofei smiled.”Old man, you should train a successor as soon as possible. Then, you can live the leisurely life you want!” Liang Weimin’s and Yuan Shan’s expressions changed slightly, and their eyes revealed a hint of anticipation and nervousness. Elder Tang didn’t notice their expressions. He smiled and nodded at Xia ruofei.””Yup! As he got older, he felt that there were many things that he could not do with his heart! I also wanted to see if there are any outstanding juniors in the family, so I’m going to bring them back to the United States to train them ...” When Liang Weimin heard this, he gathered his courage and asked,”Uncle, you see ... Our little Chao ...” Elder Tang looked at Liang Weimin with a half – Smile and said,””For the people! Little Chao’s filial piety is commendable. You can say that he has done his best for my matter this time ...” Just as Liang Weimin’s eyes lit up with joy, old master Tang suddenly changed the topic and said,”But I think little Chao doesn’t seem to have any interest in developing in the business world ...” “Uncle, little Chao is still young and his heart hasn’t settled down yet!” Liang Weimin quickly said,”if you can take him by your side and teach him, I believe he’ll gradually change.” Elder Tang smiled noncommittally and did not answer Liang Weimin directly. This made Liang Weimin feel a little disappointed. He and Yuan Shan looked at each other and saw a hint of frustration in each other’s eyes. If Liang Qichao had been a little more positive, based on his performance in the search for the Phoebe zhennan, there was a high chance that he would have been favored by elder Tang. However, Liang Qichao didn’t want to go to United States at all ... Elder Tang thought for a while and suddenly said to Xia ruofei,””Brother Xia, I have a suggestion. You can consider it.” “Please speak, old man.” “It’s the Phoebe zhennan material today. I wonder if you are interested in another way of trading?” Elder Tang said,”I bought a farm in Australia, but I haven’t really taken care of it. If you’re interested, I can give you 40% of the shares to offset the 10 million US dollars.”
