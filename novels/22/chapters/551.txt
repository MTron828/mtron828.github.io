Chapter 552: No story without a coincidence (2)

Boss Qian was interrupted by CEO Lin and ignored Xia ruofei. He came back to his senses and said with an apologetic smile,””Boss Xia, I’m getting old and my brain gets muddled easily. I’m sorry! President Lin said you wanted to discuss business with me. What kind of business is it?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”boss Qian, it’s like this. I have a batch of high – Quality iron – Skin Dendrobium on hand. I want to process them into iron – Skin maples. However, our company doesn’t have any talents in this field.” President Lin said that you have the best technical strength and many experienced Masters, so I thought of coming here to seek cooperation and technical support. ”

“As far as I know, the southeast province doesn’t seem to be suitable for the growth of iron – Skin Dendrobium,” boss Qian said after a moment of surprise. Besides, the best harvesting season for Dendrobium has passed. Boss Xia, the iron – Skin Dendrobium you have ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I have my own ways. It’s not convenient for me to say this. Boss Qian, the cooperation I hope for is that you send an experienced master to the southeast province to help me make the Ironhide maples. I’ll cover all the transportation and accommodation expenses. In addition, I’ll pay your company 1000 Yuan for each kilogram of Ironhide maples. How about it?”

This was also the ideal model that Xia ruofei and President Lin had discussed on the way here.

After all, the business partners that CEO Lin was familiar with were all the iron – Skin Dendi cultivation bases such as the Qian family. He was certainly not familiar with the fengdou experts who produced these Dendi plants. These Dendi cultivation bases were essentially Xia ruofei’s competitors. Therefore, CEO Lin actually did not have many choices.

It just so happened that boss Qian had a good personal relationship with CEO Lin. In addition, they had a lot of business dealings. If Xia ruofei were to pay a higher processing fee, there was still a possibility of this business being closed.

However, after hearing Xia ruofei’s words, boss Qian did not show much interest. Instead, he frowned slightly.

President Lin laughed and said,”old Qian, brother Xia didn’t make it clear just now. Let me add a few more points!” First of all, they only need you to send an experienced master. The other workers don’t need you to assign them. The master only needs to be responsible for directing the workers and personally take care of a few key steps. What about the second place? Brother Xia has a lot of Ironhide vessel strips on hand. A conservative estimate would be that he can make 120 kilograms of maple Dipper. ”

Boss Qian finally showed a hint of interest.

120 kilograms of fengdou, the processing cost would be 120000.

He had thought that Xia ruofei’s business was just a small business. It would be too troublesome if he had to send workers to the southeast province just for the processing fee of tens of thousands of Yuan. Even if he had failed in other businesses all these years and only kept this Dendrobium base, he would not go to such trouble for tens of thousands of Yuan.

If only one person had to go, and he could earn 120000 to 130000 Yuan all at once, it would be a different story. It would be a waste not to make money!

Moreover, the harvesting of the iron – Skin Dendrobium at his cultivation base had already been completed a long time ago. Most of the fresh strips had already been processed into maple leaves. After the workers were done with this, there were not as many things as before.

The workers were idle, and their salaries had been paid. Why not send them out to earn some extra money?

Xia ruofei laughed and added fuel to the fire,””Boss Qian, I can also guarantee that this isn’t a one – time deal. In the future, I will have a batch of Ironhide vessel fresh strips every two to three months. I need to make them into fengdou. We can have a long – term cooperation.”

Boss Qian revealed a trace of hesitation and said,””Boss Xia, there’s always a supply of fresh strips all year round ... Could it be that these raw materials were artificially cultivated in the greenhouse? The price won’t be very high. You won’t make much profit if you spend such a large processing fee!”

Iron – hide maples that could be sold at a high price were at least highly imitated wild ones like boss Qian ‘s. The last time Xia ruofei saw Tongren Tang selling one for 100000 Yuan per kilogram, it was the top quality. If it was artificially cultivated, the price of the iron – hide maples would be much lower. It would be considered good if it could be sold for 10000 or 20000 Yuan per kilogram.

And the majority of the cost was still on the iron – Skin Dendrobium. If he had to pay a processing fee of 1000 Yuan per kilogram, he would really make a loss.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Boss Qian, thank you for your concern. However, I’m confident in this deal. It’s all up to you ...”

Boss Qian muttered to himself for a moment before nodding and saying,”Boss Xia, that’s fine! Since President Lin has come personally, it would be too unreasonable if I don’t do this small thing!”

“Thank you, boss Qian,” Xia ruofei said happily,”I’ll give you a deposit first!”

Boss Qian waved his hand and said,””No need, no need. How can I not trust someone introduced by President Lin?”

After saying that, boss Qian looked back and stopped a young man who was in a hurry. He said,””Li Jun, come here!”

The dark – skinned young man walked over when he heard this.

“Li Jun, call old Hu and ask him to come over immediately ...” Said boss Qian.

After boss Qian finished speaking, he saw that the young man didn’t respond and couldn’t help but call out,””Li Jun, I’m talking to you!”

The young man’s mouth was slightly open, and his eyes were fixed on Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei also looked at the young man in surprise.

After a long while, the two of them said at the same time,”

“Qian Lijun!”

“Xia ruofei!”

Both of their voices were filled with surprise, and they hugged each other after they finished speaking.

“What are you doing here? We haven’t seen each other for five or six years, right?” Xia ruofei exclaimed in surprise,”I almost couldn’t recognize you!”

“Comrade ruofei, shouldn’t I be the one asking you this?” Qian Lijun asked. This is my home. Why can’t I be here? You, on the other hand, why did you suddenly appear in my house? I almost thought I was dreaming!”

Boss Qian and President Lin looked at the two of them in a daze. What was going on? RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Li Jun, do you know boss Xia?” asked boss Qian.

“More than just knowing! Dad, this is my comrade!” Qian Lijun said excitedly,”we new recruits sleep on the same shared bed!”

Xia ruofei was also stunned. After talking for so long, boss Qian was Qian Lijun’s father!

Speaking of which, he had only been comrades – in – arms with Qian Lijun for a period of time, so they didn’t know each other very well. He only knew that Qian Lijun’s hometown was in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province, and his family business was quite big.

At that time, Xia ruofei was in the Army. The new recruits of that year came from two places. One was Sanshan city in the southeast province, and the other was Ouyue city in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province.

The two of them were from the same recruit company and were assigned to the same recruit class.

After they left the company, the two of them were even in the same company and class. It could be said that they were fated.

Because of this, Xia ruofei and Qian Lijun had a very good relationship.

Especially when he was in the recruit company, Qian Lijun’s physical fitness wasn’t very good at that time. Every time he trained, he would be on the verge of death. Xia ruofei often helped Qian Lijun in training, and the strong camaraderie was formed through the hard work on the training ground.

Of course, not long after Xia ruofei finished his recruit training and left the company, he was selected to participate in the lone wolf training and then officially joined the lone wolf commando unit.

Due to the secrecy of the unit, they gradually lost contact with their comrades in the old company.

He had heard that Qian Lijun had retired from the Army after two years to help his father with his business. He didn’t expect to meet him here today. It was too much of a coincidence.

What left the deepest impression on Xia ruofei was that when he was in the new recruit class, Qian Lijun would often tell everyone how beautiful the red Arowana he raised at home was. He even showed Xia ruofei many photos of his Red Arowana.

It was because of this that after Xia ruofei retired, he happened to meet a dying Red Arowana owner in the seafood market. He bought it without hesitation and used the spirit Heart Flower petal solution to save his life.

Later on, Xia ruofei bought a Red Arowana to mate with. Now, they had already produced a large number of offspring in the spatial fish pond. He even gave a pair of high – Quality blood – Red Dragons to Ling Xiaotian.

Speaking of which, it was all thanks to Qian Lijun’s instigations in the class. Otherwise, Xia ruofei would have missed that opportunity.
