Chapter 3438: A slap in the face (2)

He had persisted to this extent and still had not caused any damage to the barrier membrane. There was no point in continuing.

Moreover, cracks had already appeared on his metacarpal bone. Even if he wanted to forcefully hold on, he would not be able to hold on for long. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Hence, Xia ruofei sighed and began to gradually reduce his strength. He was very experienced and knew that he could not withdraw all his strength at once, or he would be seriously injured by the backlash.

As he retracted his power bit by bit, the barrier membrane also returned to its original position bit by bit. This way, there wouldn’t be too much backlash.

After a while, Xia ruofei finally retracted all his energy.

At this moment, his palm was still in excruciating pain. In just a short while, the bones on both sides of his palm had already cracked.

Of course, this kind of external injury was nothing. Xia ruofei took out half a spirit Heart Flower petal from the spirit map space and fused it with his palm. Soon, the crack in his palm began to heal at a speed visible to the naked eye. “Ruofei, are you alright?” Ling Qingxue asked, concerned.

She had seen Xia ruofei’s pained expression just now.

Xia ruofei shook his head with a bitter smile and said,'”‘It’s nothing. It’s just a minor injury. It’ll recover very soon. However… We probably won’t be able to get this crystal card. I’ve tried it just now, and the difference in power is too great…”

“If you can’t get it, then don’t!” Ling Qingxue said,”it’s good that he’s fine! There were many good things in the cultivation world! We can’t possibly take all the benefits!”

“That’s true, but seeing this crystal card right in front of my eyes, but I just can’t get it, this kind of feeling is still very uncomfortable!” Xia ruofei said with a bitter smile.

“This means that you’ve suffered too few setbacks!” Ling Qingxue said with a smile.

“You’re a rich second generation and a young lady. How can you say that I’ve suffered less setbacks?” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.’Tve suffered a lot since I was young, okay? After you joined the Army, especially the Special Forces, those days … Tsk tsk, I bet you wouldn’t even be able to live a day!”

Ling Qingxue burst out laughing and said,””I’m not saying that you haven’t suffered any setbacks in the past. I’m saying that after you started cultivating, everything has been smooth and the resources you’ve obtained are much more than those of the cultivators on earth, right? So, I’m giving you a lesson today to let you know that not everything will go your way on the path of cultivation. II

“Now that you’ve mentioned it, it docs seem like it!” Xia ruofei scratched his head and said with a smile,”it seems that I’m more comfortable with things related to cultivation!”

“Isn’t that so?” Ling Qingxue said.

“What wife said makes sense!” Xia ruofei had thought it through and said freely,”since I can’t get it, it means that I’m not fated to have it. At least, I’m not fated to have it yet. I’ll leave it here!”

“En!” Ling Qingxue nodded.

Then, she asked hesitantly,””Ruofei, do you think… I should try?”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment and said,”there are no shortcuts to break this kind of barrier. You can only rely on absolute strength.” Qingxue, your cultivation level is still relatively low. I’m afraid …”

“Then I won’t try!” Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”let’s not waste time!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”there’s no harm in trying!” Anyway, we should have already completed this level’s mission and are just waiting for the evaluation results to come out. This kind of protective barrier is very typical. Even if you can’t break it, it’s good for you to feel it! This is a rare experience!” “Then… I’ll try?” Ling Qingxue was also a little curious, so she immediately asked.

“Go!” Xia ruofei said,”but remember, you must not use too much force to hit the barrier. Otherwise, the force of the impact will definitely hurt you! You can only do what I did just now, gently press on it, and then slowly increase the strength.”

“Mm! I saw what you did just now, don’t worry!” Ling Qingxue was eager to try.

“Don’t add too much strength at once. Also, if you feel that your palm can’t withstand the pressure anymore, you must give up decisively. It’s meaningless to blindly persist. You’ll only hurt yourself.” Xia ruofei warned.

“Okay, I’m very afraid of pain. I definitely won’t stupidly persist!” Ling Qingxue said with a smile.

“There’s one more important thing. Even if you want to pull it out, you can’t do it all at once. Otherwise, the barrier membrane will bounce back with a lot of force. Even if you’re lucky and don’t suffer any serious injuries, your wrist will definitely be fractured. So, you must pull it out bit by bit. Don’t be too hasty.” Xia ruofei instructed.

Ling Qingxue nodded seriously and said,””Alright, I’ve remembered everything. Is there anything else I should take note of?”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”it’s nothing much. Anyway, you’re just feeling it. Just pay attention to your safety!”

“Alright!” Ling Qingxue said,”then I’ll go and try!”

“Go!” Xia ruofei said.

He had also followed Ling Qingxue to the side of the barrier. This way, if Ling Qingxue were to be injured due to any mishandling, he would be able to treat her in time.

Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei nodded and gave her an encouraging smile.

Ling Qingxue was excited and nervous at the same time. She slowly reached out her hand and placed her palm on the barrier like Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei had been smiling at Ling Qingxue the whole time. He was no longer worried about his personal gains and losses. To him, Ling Qingxue just wanted to experience this kind of barrier. Hence, he was in a very relaxed mood.

When Ling Qingxue’s palm touched the barrier’s membrane, the membrane caved in slightly.

The barrier’s membrane was elastic to begin with. Even if he did not use much force, it would sink down with a light press. This had nothing to do with one’s cultivation level.

Xia ruofei smiled at Ling Qingxue and said,””Try to add a little strength, but be careful not to add too much at once. You have to be wary of the force of the rebound!”

Ling Qingxue nodded and began to press down gently.

Xia ruofei chuckled as he observed Ling Qingxue’s expression. However, his smile soon froze and his expression became very dull. His mouth slowly opened until it became an “0” shape, but he did not feel anything.

Because Xia ruofei clearly saw that Ling Qingxue had only pressed down lightly, and her hand had directly penetrated the membrane wall of the barrier. Xia ruofei suddenly felt like he was in a dream.

The most ridiculous thing was that Ling Qingxue didn’t actually destroy the barrier. Although her hand had pierced through the membrane of the barrier, the barrier still existed and didn’t break apart. It was as if her hand was also a part of the barrier.

Xia ruofei could not believe his eyes.

There’s actually such an operation?

Xia ruofei had just patiently reminded Ling Qingxue to pay attention to this and that. He was clearly an experienced driver.

What he did not expect was that Ling Qingxue would turn around and use such an unexpected move to slap Xia ruofei’s face.

Xia ruofei’s instructions on how to take note of when using force and experience in holding back… Seemed to be of no use to Ling Qingxue. She was like a newborn calf, not following the usual routine at all, but the effect was surprisingly good.

In fact, Ling Qingxue was also shocked.

She followed Xia ruofei’s instructions. At first, she only pressed lightly on the Ward’s membrane and did not dare to use any force. After she stabilized herself, she started to exert force. At first, she used very little force. However, the magical thing was that the Ward’s membrane did not seem to have any effect on her. With just a little force, her hands went through it.

Didn’t they say that the barrier’s membrane was very tough and had a very strong anti – shock force? How did this happen? Ling Qingxue was also confused.

She stammered,”RUO … RUO Fei… How could this … This happen?” I… What…. What should I do now?”
