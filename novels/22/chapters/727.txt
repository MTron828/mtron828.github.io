Xia ruofei could tell at a glance that the source material of the picture was the lychees and cherries produced by Taoyuan farm. However, after some post – editing, the lighting and visual effects were very good. In addition, some water droplets were added in the post – editing, giving it a more layered and three – dimensional feel, making people’s hearts beat faster.

The contrast between the red fruit and the beige – White background was very strong, giving off a fresh and tender feeling.

Next to the picture of the fruit was the green font “Taoyuan organic lychee/Taoyuan organic cherry”. Next to it was a row of small green words “pure natural good taste”.

The size, style, and position of these words had obviously been carefully selected. They were arranged in a picturesque disorder and looked very designed.

Between the picture of the fruit and the text, there was a green color block running through the entire side. The big LOGO of paradise Corporation was printed on this color block, and it was very eye – catching.

The front and back sides were exactly the same design, and the two sides introduced the Tao Yuan brand in green font, the quality of Tao Yuan fruit, nutritional ingredients, and so on. In addition, there was also a green QR code, which was the official WeChat and official Weibo of the Tao Yuan company.

After Feng Jing’s administrative team was formed, these channels were quickly opened and there were also specialized employees in charge of maintaining them.

Feng Jing was still very particular about the use of new media.

At the top of the box, there was a plastic handle.

The entire design looked very high – end, but it wasn’t heavy or luxurious. Instead, it gave people a fresh, natural, and simple feeling.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but exclaim,”beautiful!” Boss Feng, this design company’s standards have improved! It seems like we can have a long – term cooperation with them!”

Feng Rao laughed and said,”What do you mean” improved “?” Their first draft is still the same as before, with a lot of emphasis on color tones. One look and I can tell that it’s the feeling of a nouveau riche!”

“Is that so?” Xia ruofei was a little surprised.”The effect is still quite good after the modification!”

......

“That’s why I said that sister Lin Qiao’s contribution can’t go unnoticed!” Feng Jing said,”she was the one who came up with the basic idea for this version of the design. She even personally followed the other party’s designer and slowly implemented all her ideas into the design draft.”

“Swish!” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but exclaim,”Qiao’ er, I didn’t expect you to have a talent for design! This really makes me look at you in a new light!”

Lin Qiao made a funny face at Xia ruofei and said,””You still dare to look down on me!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”yes, yes, yes, it’s all my fault!” Designer Lin, you’ve done a great job this time. I’ll get President Feng to give you a big red packet to commend your contribution to the company, okay?”

“Really?”

“How can it be fake? I’ll honor it today!” Xia ruofei smiled and said seriously,”Qiao’ er, I think you’re really talented in design. Why don’t you take advantage of this summer vacation to learn graphic design software like Photoshop, Illustrator, and redesign? There’s no pressure in having more skills!”

“That’s right, that’s right,” Feng Jing chimed in.”It just so happens that your laptop is pretty good. It should be enough for you to practice drawing.”Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Alright!” Lin Qiao said,”but this self – study should not be easy, right? Sister Feng Rao, please teach me!”

“Sure!” Feng Rao replied readily. I’ve had some contact with it when I was in college, but I’m not very proficient in it. If you have any questions, you can come to me at any time!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but clear his throat when he saw the two of them chatting happily.

Feng Jing and Lin Qiao looked at each other with smiles in their eyes.

Feng Rao stifled her laughter and pretended to be serious.””Chairman, what do you think of this design?”

“No problem! I’ll use it!” Xia ruofei said,”inform the other party to start production immediately! Old Cao’s side has already started to organize workers to collect the fruits today, so the progress of the packaging must keep up!”

“Alright!” Feng ke said.

“Oh right, I’ll give pang Hao a heads up later. Go to the finance department and collect ... 2000 Yuan!” Xia ruofei looked at Lin Qiao and said with a smile,”it’s considered Qiao’ er’s design fee. We can’t let the ‘non – staff employee’ who has contributed to the company be disappointed!”

“Alright!” Feng Rao asked straightforwardly.

Lin Qiao said with embarrassment,”Brother ruofei, you’re really giving me a bonus? No need! I can’t ask for money for your help. ”

“Why can’t I?” Xia ruofei said seriously,”it’s normal to exchange labor for remuneration.”

“But that’s too much ...” He said.

“Many? I don’t think it’s much at all!” Xia ruofei asked,”what’s the most valuable thing now? Creativity! Thoughts! Inspiration! I don’t think the design fee of 2000 Yuan is too much for this work. ”

Feng Jing nodded her head in agreement. As a Senior Manager, she knew that Xia ruofei’s words made sense.

“So this matter is settled.” Xia ruofei didn’t allow Lin Qiao to decline.”Sign and collect the money today!”

Seeing Xia ruofei’s firm attitude, Lin Qiao could only nod and say,””Thank you, brother ruofei ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Oh right, Qiao’ er, give me your ID card.”

“What are you doing with my ID card?” Lin Qiao asked with confusion.

However, she still took out her wallet obediently, took out her ID card, and handed it to Xia ruofei.

“You don’t have to worry about that!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I wouldn’t use your ID card to do anything illegal, would I?”

“That’s hard to say!” Feng Jing teased,”sister Lin Qiao, I think you should be more careful!”

“Brother ruofei won ‘t!” Lin Qiao said seriously.

Xia ruofei squinted at Feng Rao and said,””Did you see? My sister knows me best!”

Feng Rao couldn’t help but burst out laughing.

Xia ruofei waved the ID card in his hand and said,””Alright, you guys can continue with your work! I’m leaving!”

With that, Xia ruofei turned around and left Feng Jing’s office.

He went straight downstairs, went home, and drove the Knight XV. He left the farm with Lin Qiao’s ID card and went straight to San Shan city.
