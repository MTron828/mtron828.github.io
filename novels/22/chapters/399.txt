Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”sis Wu, I don’t know how many people are envious of you!” You’re so young and you’re already the executive Vice – Head of the county. This is a position that many people can’t get in their entire lives!”

Wu Liqian laughed and said,””Let’s not be envious. Every family has its own problems. I know you must have your own troubles. How can anything in this world be perfect?”

Xia ruofei immediately put on a sad face and said,””Yup! I’ve been quite annoyed recently too ...”

Wu Liqian naturally asked,””Oh? What’s bothering you? Tell me about it, sis Wu. ”

Xia ruofei sighed and said,””Sigh, I’m too handsome. Recently, many girls have taken the initiative to throw themselves into my arms. It’s so annoying ...”

Only then did Wu Liqian realize that Xia ruofei was joking with her. She rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and couldn’t help but burst into laughter.”Little Xia, your smug look ... Is really shameless!”

Xia ruofei said innocently,”sis Wu, I’m just telling the truth!” Do you think ... It’s my fault that I’m handsome?”

Wu Liqian laughed so hard that her body trembled. She was out of breath and couldn’t speak for a long time.

“Xiao Xia, it’s really a good decision to come to your side today. I feel like I haven’t laughed as much as I did today in a month. My mood has suddenly turned sunny!” Wu Liqian said.

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”sis Wu, then you should come here more often in the future!” You’re always welcome here. ”

Wu Liqian nodded seriously, then she stood up and said,””Xia, I should go back. There are many things to do in the county. I can’t be away for too long.”

“Have dinner before you leave!” Xia ruofei quickly replied,”I’ve prepared everything.”

“No, I’ll eat it next time!” Wu Liqian smiled and said,”wait until I find time to take a few days off. I’ll stay here every day and eat you poor!”

“Alright! I can’t ask for more, but I’m afraid you won’t be able to make me poor!” Xia ruofei laughed.

Since Wu Liqian insisted on leaving, Xia ruofei did not ask her to stay. The two of them walked down the mountain together.

After returning to the villa, Xia ruofei asked Wu Liqian to wait in the yard for a while. After he entered the villa, he took out three portions of jaded skin ointment from the spirit map space. Then, he took out some Taoyuan vegetables from the spirit map space and put them in a basket. He found a paper bag in the living room and put the jaded skin ointment in it. He walked out of the villa with one in each hand.

This time, Xia ruofei had made 30 servings, so he was very generous and gave Wu Liqian three servings at once.

“Sis Wu, there are three portions of jadeshi ointment in here. You can use it first.” Xia ruofei said,”each portion can be used five times. Just use it before bed every day.” In addition, these vegetables are all produced by us. You can take them back and try them. ”

“Thank you!” Wu Liqian didn’t refuse and took the paper bag as if she had received a treasure. Ever since she saw the magical effect of the jaded skin cream on Tian Huilan, she had been thinking about this matter. She couldn’t wait to try it.

As for the basket that contained the Taoyuan vegetables, her gaze never fell on it. Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and opened the front passenger door to let her in.

Xia ruofei then explained to Wu Liqian how to use the jaded skin cream. After that, he shook hands with Wu Liqian and stood in the villa’s courtyard to see her car off.

Xia ruofei had received a few calls asking for the jaded skin cream today. He thought that Lu You would be the next one to come to his place besides Wu Liqian. After all, this girl had already used the jaded skin cream and was very clear about the magical effects of the jaded skin cream. This time, Tian Huilan had asked her to come and get it again. She would definitely be very enthusiastic.

However, Xia ruofei’s judgment was wrong. Not long after Wu Liqian left, Tao Yuan farm welcomed a new guest. However, it was not Lu You.

It was song Rui, and he didn’t come alone.
