Chapter 486: The brain circuit of a strong woman (1)

Xia ruofei rubbed his sore eyes. He had stayed up all night. Even if he was made of iron, he still felt a little tired. Moreover, during the process of training, he had been constantly releasing his mental power. Although it was not much each time, it could not withstand such a continuous consumption. Therefore, his mental power was almost exhausted, and both sides of his head were aching.

Xia ruofei raised his hand and looked at his watch. It was around five in the morning.

He simply locked the door and windows, summoned the spirit map scroll from his palm, and then entered the space with a thought.

Xia ruofei first drank a small bottle of diluted spirit Heart Flower petal solution. Then, with a flash of his body and mind, he appeared in the stone room in the new space.

Xia ruofei sat cross – legged on the Jade futon and started to recover his spiritual power.

The Jade futon was a great help to the recovery of mental strength. In addition, Xia ruofei had taken the petal solution of the spirit Heart Flower. After half an hour, Xia ruofei felt that his mental strength was full again. He stood up in high spirits, and the fatigue on his body had disappeared without a trace.

After Xia ruofei recovered, he left the medium.

He took the painting and went to the bathroom to wash his face.

Seeing that it was still early, Xia ruofei made himself a cup of tea and sat down in front of the computer. After turning on the computer, he lit a cigarette and started to search for the minerals and materials that he had ordered two days ago.

Other than the Supreme – grade mutton – Fat white jade, the materials listed on the third page of the booklet were not considered rare. Xia ruofei could easily find them all on the internet. Besides that, considering that he would have to process these materials, forge, and process them, Xia ruofei also ordered some small processing equipment.

In order to solve the problem of electricity in the spirit map, Xia ruofei even ordered a small diesel generator. He had already tested it when he drove the all – terrain vehicle in the spirit map space. The spirit map space had an automatic purification function, and the exhaust would not pollute the space.

Xia ruofei checked the orders on his computer and realized that most of them had already been sent out. Some of the smaller mineral materials were sent by express delivery, while the machines and equipment were delivered by logistics.

Xia ruofei checked on the logistics situation and turned on some music. He listened to the music while browsing the news.

It was not until Seveno’ clock that Xia ruofei tidied up a little and went downstairs to the staff cafeteria in the complex not far away for breakfast. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Feng Rao, who was preparing to go to the job fair that day, had brought Qin Xiaojun to the canteen to eat.

Feng Jing had stayed up late the previous night, but she still seemed to be in good spirits, especially since her skin was not dry or dark at all. It still looked white and warm, with a faint luster.

“Chairman!” Feng Rao saw Xia ruofei enter and immediately greeted him with a smile.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. He walked over to Feng Jing’s table and sat down. He said half – jokingly,””President Feng, you look especially good today! Could it be that he was in high spirits? Did you find a way to hire the director?”

Feng Rao’s cheeks were slightly hot, but she quickly returned to normal. There was a trace of excitement in her eyes as she said,””Chairman, I was just about to look for you!”

“Oh? Did you really find a suitable director so quickly? Is it the marketing director or the administrative Director?” Xia ruofei asked.

“It’s not about the recruitment. ” Feng Jing’s eyes were filled with eagerness as she asked,”Chairman, I wanted to ask you about the bottle of cosmetics you gave me two days ago ...”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment and suddenly understood why Yingluo looked so different today. She must have used the jaded skin ointment for the past two days.

Xia ruofei was already used to Feng Jing’s reaction.

Because during this period of time, everyone who asked him for the jaded skin cream, especially women, almost had the same expression.

Hence, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””It seems that President Feng has already used the jaded skin ointment I gave you ...”

“Jaded skin cream? This is a good name!” Feng Rao’s eyes lit up.

Xia ruofei didn’t wait for Feng Rao to speak. He smiled and said,””President Feng, I still have some of this jaded skin cream. You can ask me for more after you’ve finished it.”

Feng Jing was now his company’s right – hand man. Although the jaded skin cream was unbelievably effective, the cost was very low, so Xia ruofei naturally would not be stingy.

She did not expect Xia ruofei to misunderstand.

Feng Rao blushed and waved her hand.”Chairman, I’m not looking for you for that ... Jade skin cream! I just wanted to ask you ... Is it possible to mass – produce this cosmetic product?”

Xia ruofei was stunned and said,””Mass production?”

“Yeah!” Feng Rao said excitedly. I remember you telling me that you made it by hand. This is the most effective makeup I’ve ever used, there’s no other! Laplaerie, SK peaks II, Dior, and Chanel were all weak compared to it! If this jaded skin cream can be mass produced, it will definitely become our company’s top product!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

This career woman’s brain circuit was indeed different from that of ordinary women.

Whether it was a high – ranking official like Tian Huilan, a beautiful young lady like Lu You, or a wealthy lady like Madam song, after experiencing the heaven – defying effects of the jaded skin cream, their first reaction was to ask Xia ruofei for more jaded skin cream so that they could continue to use it.
