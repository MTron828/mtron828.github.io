2227 Internet celebrity MPV_Xia ruofei smiled.”I just got home. Didn’t I call you as soon as I got home?”

“Kid, why didn’t you tell me before you came?” Song Rui said,”alright! I still have something to do here, so I’ll call brother Jun and the others over in the afternoon. We haven’t gathered for a long time, so we should have a few drinks!”

“You must be thinking about the good wine in my wine cellar!” Xia ruofei scolded jokingly.

“Is this how you view your good brother?” Song Rui cried out in injustice.”Don’t tell me that our Brotherhood can’t compare to a few bottles of wine?”

Song Rui chuckled and said,””Of course, the wine you’ve stored is not bad ...”

“I knew you were up to no good!” Xia ruofei laughed.

“Then tell me the truth!” Song Rui chuckled and said.

“Alright! Everyone, everyone!” Xia ruofei replied readily,”there’s enough good wine! If you’re not drunk, you’re not allowed to leave the table!”

“You said it yourself!” Song Rui was overjoyed. I’ll call them one by one later!”

“Yes, yes, yes. You can come and inform everyone. I won’t be calling.” Xia ruofei said.

“By the way, what’s the matter with you coming back to the capital?” Song Rui asked.

“Didn’t I tell you? It’s for our club!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”didn’t you guys say that you wanted to collaborate with xiangnan TV for a show? You even helped me to agree to help me record an episode of the show. Aren’t I here to pay off my debt?”

“Is the program recording about to start?” Song Rui said,”I was wondering why there were so many more workers in the mushroom house these few days!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but ask,”speaking of this, I’m a little worried!” Will their recording affect the construction of our club? Don’t lose more than you gain!”

To be honest, the cooperation with xiangnan TV this time was mainly beneficial to Tao Yuan company. For the club, of course, it had a promotional effect, but the large number of ordinary TV viewers were not the club’s target customers, so the promotional effect was basically negligible.

If the filming of the show affected the construction of the club, Xia ruofei would be sorry for his brother.

After all, the recording of the show could not be completed in a day or two. Xia ruofei only recorded one episode, but the guests changed every episode. It would take at least one or two months to finish recording a season of the show.

Song Rui smiled and said,”don’t worry about that!” These problems were considered during the planning and design. The mushroom house was given priority. Now, the clubhouse and the mushroom house were separated to ensure that they wouldn’t affect each other!”

“That’s good ...” Xia ruofei said.”By the way, Xiao Rui, I have something I need your help with!”

“If there’s anything, just say it!” Song Rui said readily.

“I want to buy another car!” Xia ruofei went straight to the point.”There’s only a Land Rover in the capital right now. It’s not appropriate to drive that car on some occasions ...”

“I agree,” song Rui said immediately.”To be honest, the Land Rover is a good vehicle, but it won’t be good for high – end occasions!” RUO Fei, leave this to me! Old Li’s Xiao si had been specialized in reversing cars for the past few years! He had a lot of good stuff there! Whatever brand of car you like, just say the word and I’ll get it within a month! And it’s even cheaper than the market! Lamborghini, Ferrari ...”

“Stop! Stop!” Xia ruofei quickly said,”why would I do that? It’s so expensive, and the base is so low, it’s not practical at all!”

Song Rui was stunned for a moment, then he smiled and said,””Ah? I thought you were going to buy a luxury car ... I was mistaken!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”I have a lot of money to burn! Why would he buy a luxury car ...”

“You need to change your mindset!” Song Rui said,”you’re a billionaire after all. You can’t always be a loser in terms of spending!”

“Even if you have money, it’s hard earned, not blown by the wind!” Xia ruofei said in a bad mood.

“Fine! Fine! Fine!” Song Rui quickly said,”I won’t persuade you ... Then tell me! What car do you want to buy?”

Xia ruofei said,”I’m thinking that a car with good performance should be more comfortable.” It’s mainly because I don’t know much about cars, can you give me some advice?”

“I see ...” Song Rui pondered for a moment and said,”ruofei, why don’t you buy a Toyota Elfa?” The comfort of this car is unparalleled, it’s a little similar to the celebrity nanny cars and it has a lot of space. This car has been very popular recently!”

Xia ruofei frowned and said,””The Japanese’s car?”

He had an instinctive aversion to Wei nation cars.

Song Rui laughed and said,”yo!” I didn’t expect our Big Boss Xia to be such a nationalistic young man!”

“Not really ...” Xia ruofei said.”But the Japanese’s car doesn’t seem to be very safe! Do you have any other recommendations?”

Song Rui said seriously,”in all fairness, there’s no problem with the safety performance of this car!” Ruofei, I don’t like the Japanese either, but objectively speaking, the cost – Performance ratio of several business cars of the same grade is still quite good. ” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Xia ruofei wasn’t against buying Wei nation’s products. If they were really such nationalistic youths, they wouldn’t be able to survive at all. This was an era of globalization. The parts of a car or an electronic product might be produced in many countries. For example, many domestic mobile phones had chips provided by foreign manufacturers. Even the Huawei mobile phones, which developed their own chips, also had many parts, including the screen and other parts. They were all foreign manufacturers.
