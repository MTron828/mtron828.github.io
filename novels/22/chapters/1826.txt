Chapter 1827: The opening ceremony (1)

Translator: 549690339

The phone calls were mainly from the relevant departments and the Bureau invited by the Paradise Corporation. Originally, many units had sent their deputy leaders to attend, but these people in the system were very well – informed. When the news that Deputy Mayor nI had changed his schedule to attend the opening ceremony of the peach blossom mansion came out, those units that had originally accepted the invitation couldn’t sit still.

The call was naturally to tell the peach blossom company that they had changed people to participate in the event. This time, the ones who returned were naturally the top leaders.

Feng Jing couldn’t help but grumble. There wasn’t much time left until the ceremony began. With so many new people coming, it meant that most of the seats would have to be changed and the order would also change.

It must be known that the people in the system paid the most attention to these things. If the seating arrangement was wrong, it would be very offensive.

Feng Jing was busy arranging for the staff to print a new name tag and adjust the seating. Xia ruofei casually looked around the ceremony venue to help Feng Jing check for any missing items.

However, the facts proved that Feng Jing was indeed very capable. She was personally in charge of the company’s operations and had considered all aspects. There were basically no obvious flaws.

It didn’t take long for the invited guests to arrive one after another, and they appeared almost in a group, including Secretary Chen from the Bell Tower District. It was obvious that these people had heard that Deputy Mayor ni was coming, so they rushed over as fast as they could.

In addition to the main leaders of the Bell Tower District, there were also several offices in the city’s Administrative Bureau and Department. They were originally close to the city, but they immediately set off after receiving the news, so that they could arrive before Deputy Mayor ni.

Otherwise, if a Deputy Mayor was here, and the leaders from the Bureau and District were late, it would be too disrespectful to the higher – ups.

Xia ruofei had already gone downstairs, and Deputy – Mayor ni was about to arrive, so he did not go up. Instead, he stood near the entrance of the small square and became a “guest”.

These district leaders and Bureau leaders were very polite to Xia ruofei. After all, Xia ruofei was now a well – known private entrepreneur in Sanshan. He had a certain level of social influence. In addition, he had the support of the municipal Party Committee and government leaders. These district leaders and Bureau leaders naturally would not put on airs in front of Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei was a rather easy – going person. He was all smiles as he greeted everyone, and then asked the staff to lead them to their seats.

After a while, a black sedan with a red flag slowly drove to the entrance of the small square and stopped. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

A young man in his early thirties quickly got out of the car and jogged around the front of the car to the driver’s side of the back door. He reached out and opened the door. A thin middle – aged man in his fifties stepped out of the car. He was Deputy – Mayor ni.

Xia ruofei had seen Deputy – Mayor NI’s resume, so he recognized him at first glance.

He walked up to them with a smile and said,””Mayor ni, welcome, welcome! I’m the chairman of paradise Corporation, Xia ruofei. ”

“Hello, President Xia!” Deputy Mayor ni smiled gently,”President Xia, I’ve long heard of your name! Seeing you today, the rumors are indeed true. You’re a young and promising lad!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”You’re too kind, leader. I’m young, but I’m not that promising.”

“In his early twenties, he built a company with endless potential and a valuation of two billion in just over a year from scratch. Isn’t that great?” Deputy – Mayor nI had obviously done his homework and knew Xia ruofei very well.

“I’ll take Mayor NI’s praise as a spur to our paradise Corporation!”Xia ruofei chuckled.

“Hahaha!” Deputy – Mayor ni laughed heartily and said,”President Xia, I came uninvited to your company’s housewarming celebration today!”

“No, no, no!” Xia ruofei said,”we’re very flattered that Mayor ni took time out of his busy schedule to come personally!”

Deputy – Mayor ni smiled and gestured to the Secretary, who quickly took out a flower basket from the trunk.

“It’s just a small gift, I hope you won’t mind!”Said Deputy – Mayor ni.

Xia ruofei immediately saw the words “congratulations on moving in” on the silk ribbon of the flower basket. It was signed by the Sanshan Municipal Party Committee and the city government.

This wasn’t a small token of appreciation! This meant that Deputy – Mayor ni was here today to represent the City Council and the city government to support the peach blossom company.

Xia ruofei quickly thanked him and gestured for the staff member to take the flower basket.

They had received quite a number of flower baskets today, including those from jianda group and other partner companies, as well as some from other departments and bureaus. These flower baskets were placed on both sides of the red carpet at the entrance of the small square, so Deputy – Mayor NI’s flower basket was naturally placed in the most conspicuous position.

“Mayor ni, the ceremony is about to begin. Please take a seat at the venue!” Xia ruofei said.

“Good, good, good, the guest will do as the host wishes! I’ll listen to your command!” Deputy – Mayor ni joked.

Xia ruofei led Deputy – Mayor ni across the red carpet and asked him to sign on a spray – painted wall with the LOGO of paradise Corporation as a memento. Then, the two of them walked to the guest area.

The district leaders and Bureau leaders who arrived a few minutes earlier quickly stood up and greeted Deputy – Mayor ni. These people were also secretly relieved, and they finally arrived before the leaders.

There were still a few other invited departments whose offices were not in Bell Tower District, so their leaders had not arrived yet.
