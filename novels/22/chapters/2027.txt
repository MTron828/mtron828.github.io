2028 Burning Jade and stone together (2)

The first target of his revenge was naturally the young man in front of him. Although he didn’t know the young man’s name, he believed that as long as he could live, he would have a chance to find this young man and kill him in the cruelest way.

Other than this young man, there was also the Hong sect. It might seem difficult, but he would definitely use all his strength to complete the revenge plan.

Of course, the premise of everything was to survive.

Now, it seemed that the hope was slim.

Xia ruofei looked at old Gehrman teasingly, then pointed at Calas on the ground and said sarcastically,Also, even if you want to live, you should at least be more careful! You’re threatening me with this kind of trash Are you sure This guy didn’t tell you that Monica has been ostracized and wronged in the family. Besides Toles, the person she hates the most is probably this karlas who has been plastic – changed into a pig’s head by you! So, do you still think he’s your bargaining chip

Old Gelman’s expression changed drastically. He glared at Calas and asked,Is everything he said true

Klass’s face was already pale, and now it was even paler. He trembled as he said,I won’t ... I’m Monica’s uncle! He was only talking about the friction within the family. Monica would not leave him to die! Where was she I want to see her! I want to see Monica! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

As soon as he finished speaking, a cold voice came from outside the house,I’m coming!

Xia ruofei turned around in surprise. He saw Lyu zhengfeng walking in with Monica. Lyu hai was pushing a wheelchair with Rousey on it.

Lu zhengfeng bowed slightly to Xia ruofei and said,Mister! When I went back to gather manpower, Monica and her brother insisted on coming with us. I thought the situation here was settled, so I took the initiative to bring them along. Please don’t take offense ...

Before Xia ruofei could say anything, klass seemed to have grabbed onto a life – saving straw and quickly said,Monica! Rousey! Please save me ... I’m your uncle!

If it wasn’t for old Gehrman’s dagger still at his neck, he might have already pounced over.

Monica looked at Calas with some disgust and said coldly,Uncle When you wanted to gift me to that homicidal maniac like a commodity, did you ever think that you were my uncle When you put Rousey under house arrest and threatened me, did you ever think that you were my uncle I’m sorry, I don’t have an uncle like you, nor do I have those cold – blooded clansmen! In the entire Grao family, only Rousey is my family!

No... No... Calas cried out in despair,Monica! I was wrong in the past ... Please don’t leave me in the lurch! I ... I promise you! As long as you save my life, I will support you to be the head of the Grasso family! I’ll completely listen to your orders from now on!

As long as you’re dead, Xia ruofei said sarcastically,with the Hong sect’s control in Turin, we can choose whoever we want to be the head of the Grasso family. Isn’t that easy

Karlas was stunned for a moment. He suddenly felt that Xia ruofei’s words made sense, but at the same time, his heart sank.

Monica did not pay any more attention to Carlos. Instead, she bowed to Xia ruofei and said,Sir, please don’t care about this person! Rousey and I only came here to see how the Gelman family is destroyed. As for this man, he has nothing to do with us. Don’t mess up your plan because of us!

To prevent Xia ruofei’s identity from being exposed, both Lu zhengfeng and Monica addressed Xia ruofei as Mister. It was obvious that they did not want to reveal any information about Xia ruofei, not even his surname.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded at Monica.

Then, he turned his eyes to the ashen – faced old Gehrman and asked,Mr. Gelman, do you now know how ridiculous your so – called bargaining chip is

Old Gelman’s hand trembled slightly as he held the dagger. He refused to accept this fact, but he had to.

Old Gelman’s expression changed several times, and then he threw the dagger away with a strange smile on his face.

He looked at Xia ruofei and said,at first ... I wanted to keep my life so that I could have a chance to avenge my son and grandchildren. Now it seems that I can only start the second plan ... It’s a pity that I can’t wipe out the damn Hong sect in one fell swoop ...

Lui hai and lui zhengfeng’s expressions slightly changed, except for Xia ruofei, who remained calm. He asked with a smile,Oh So you have a second plan! Why don’t you tell me

Old Gelman slowly reached his hand into his pocket. Lu zhengfeng’s eyes flashed with a sharp light and he raised the gun in his hand.

Xia ruofei waved his hand at him, indicating for him to calm down.

At such a close distance, everything was under his control. There was indeed no need to make a fuss.

Old Geerman took out a small black remote control and looked at Xia ruofei.Actually, it’s better this way. After all, it will take a lot of time and effort to find out your identity. It’s better to do it this way. Even if some small fish and shrimp get away, it doesn’t matter ...

At this point, old Gehrman waved the remote control in his hand, and an abnormal blush appeared on his face. He said in a calm but slightly crazy tone,Did you know There’s a large amount of TNT buried under this house. As long as I press it lightly, the entire Gehrman Manor will turn into ruins, and we ... You, you, and you ... All of us will be blown to pieces. It’s impossible to tell who those broken limbs and rotten flesh belong to. This is a true ‘you are in me, I am in you’... Hahaha! Hahaha! Hahaha ...

Old grimman couldn’t help but laugh madly at the end of his sentence.

The expressions of lui hai and the others changed drastically. They knew that the Geerman family might have a backup plan, but they didn’t expect it to be so crazy.

The Hong sect had just launched a full – scale attack on the Gelman family tonight. If what old Gelman said was true, there was a large number of explosives buried under the house. It was definitely not a temporary arrangement. It might have been set up when they moved into the manor.

In other words, old ghelman slept on a pile of explosives every day, ready to die with the enemy at any time.

This was just too crazy.

Looking at old Gelman who was laughing crazily, Lyu hai and the other brothers of Hong sect, Monica and Monica, as well as the Butler and bodyguards of the Gelman Manor, all changed their expressions.

Although the members of the Gehrman family were loyal to the family, no one wanted to be buried in the sea of fire with their family in such a tragic way!

Old Gehrman had obviously gone crazy. His face was a sickly red, as if he would press the button to detonate at any moment.

Among all the people, only Xia ruofei’s expression remained the same. He even had a mocking smile on his face as he crossed his arms and looked at old Gelman.

After laughing for a while, old Gehrman looked at Xia ruofei suspiciously.You’re not afraid

Should I be afraid Xia ruofei asked.

Old Gelman snorted and said,Did you think I would be afraid of death In any case, I can’t escape the fate of death in your hands. Why wouldn’t I be happy to take so many people with me So, please do not doubt my determination!

Xia ruofei smiled and gestured for her to go ahead.If that’s the case, then don’t hesitate! I’m looking forward to it!

Old Gelman laughed and said,I don’t care if you’re trying to be mysterious or not, in short ... Go to hell with me!

With that, old Geerman’s eyes were filled with determination as he pressed the remote control in his hand ...
