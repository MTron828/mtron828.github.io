Xia ruofei had invested 10000 Hong Kong dollars in Kasaya for entertainment, but it was impossible for him to only buy 10 Hong Kong dollars. That would be too embarrassing.

As for who they bet on, they naturally bet on Guo Hongjiang’s “star of Hong Kong” to win.

Even if this horse wasn’t favored, Xia ruofei wouldn’t buy another horse. If that happened, his emotional intelligence would be too low.

Guo Hongjiang laughed as he helped Xia ruofei place his bets. He handed the ticket that was printed from the terminal to Xia ruofei and said,””Mr. Xia, the odds for ‘star of Hong Kong’ are not high, but it’s a stable win. There shouldn’t be any suspense in this match. It shouldn’t be a problem to make a few thousand Hong Kong dollars!”

“Hahaha! Thanks to you, director Guo!” Xia ruofei laughed.

Night fell.

Guo Hongjiang ordered for a sumptuous dinner and even opened a bottle of his precious red wine. He treated Xia ruofei and MA Xiong to a meal in the private room of the horse track.

Of course, there would be more than one race at the night. In fact, there were a total of eight races tonight, with each race being half an hour apart. Guo Hongjiang’s “star of Hong Kong” would appear at about 8:30 in the evening.

As everyone was eating, the competition had already begun.

Xia ruofei had finally experienced the excitement of the Hong Kong race.

The ordinary stands were full. When the horses were ready to go, the crowd could no longer sit still, and almost everyone was standing.

The moment they set off, the entire race track was in an uproar.

Everyone was waving the horse tickets and horse classics in their hands, shouting in all kinds of languages. Some were in English, some were in Cantonese, and of course, some were in Mandarin. Hong Kong’s horse racing was an indispensable tourist attraction for mainland tourists.

Even in the member’s box that had good soundproofing, Xia ruofei could feel the entire grandstand shaking. The shouts from below could be heard.

“come on!”

“U get it!”

“Number seven! Number 7! Charge!”

“Number five! Go! Go! Go!”

Cheers, whistles, and shouts resounded through the clouds.

The track wasn’t long, and the race time was actually very short. In the blink of an eye, the horses had already crossed the finish line.

At this moment, it was as if there was an invisible big hand controlling it. Everyone looked at the big screen in the middle of the field. Without the help of the camera, it was impossible to tell who won and who lost. In the screams and shouts a minute ago, no one knew whether the horse they had bet on was half a body’s length ahead of the others.

The results were quickly displayed on the big screen.

Those who won were naturally overjoyed, especially since the winner of this match was an unpopular horse, the odds were frighteningly high.

Many people raised their heads and laughed, or hugged their companions.

Of course, there were even more people who were extremely disappointed and sat down dejectedly. There were also people who walked towards the indoor trading hall without a word. The next match would start in half an hour, and they had to hurry up and place their bets.

There was a sharp contrast between the crazed crowd in the stands and the calm scene in the private room. Xia ruofei could not help but feel a little emotional.

During the race, Guo Hongjiang didn’t forget to comment on the horses. He was a little surprised when the big screen showed that No. 2, who had been looked down on before the race, had won.

Guo Hongjiang laughed.”We’ve lost big this time. I bet on number 5 to win alone ...”

“Director Guo, you bought this one?” Xia ruofei asked, surprised.

“I’m just playing around!” Guo Hongjiang shrugged and said.

“You’ve had quite a bit of fun too, haven’t you?”MA Xiong chuckled.

“A million or so!” Guo Hongjiang said nonchalantly,”I didn’t expect No. 5 to be so disappointing. The horse is actually a good one, but it’s not well – trained. I don’t think it can keep up. The later part of the race obviously slowed down, and the rider almost lost ...”

Xia ruofei could not help but secretly shake his head. This Guo Hongjiang really liked horse betting. He had actually bet millions of Hong Kong dollars. And this was not even his own horse. He did not know if he had bought anything from the “star of Hong Kong” competition. He must have bought a lot too.

However, Xia ruofei would not ask about this.

After the meal, Guo Hongjiang asked the people to take the things away, but the bottle of red wine was still in the private room. The three of them were also holding their glasses and chatting, occasionally clinking glasses and drinking. The atmosphere was very relaxed, in sharp contrast to the madness in the stands.

Guo Hongjiang raised his hand to look at his watch and said,””It’s almost time, Mr. Xia, let’s go down and take a look at the ‘star of Hong Kong’, shall we?”

“Alright! A BMW worth tens of millions of Hong Kong dollars, I have to take a look at it up close!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

So the three of them put down their glasses and left the private room under Guo Hongjiang’s lead. They went down through an internal staircase.

The “star of Hong Kong” competition was in the next round, but in order to give everyone more time, there would be a 30 – minute interval between the two rounds. Now, the horses were all preparing.

Xia ruofei only found out when she was downstairs. Although she said that she was looking at it up close, it was actually not that close.

The horses were about to participate in the race, and to prevent any accidents, no one was allowed to get close to them at this time. Only the participating horse and the rider were allowed to stay together.

Xia ruofei, Guo Hongjiang, and MA Xiong saw the star of Hong Kong ten meters away from them.
