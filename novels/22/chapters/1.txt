Chapter 2: Mysterious Scroll

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Xia Ruofei thought to himself. Why did such a beautiful girl come here alone? Wasn’t she asking for trouble?

“Help! Big Brother… save me…” The girl saw Xia Ruofei and pleaded as if she had found a straw to clutch at.

This place was remote and it was rare for people to pass by. It was also because of this that the three hoodlums dared to act so brazenly under the influence of alcohol.

They obviously did not expect anyone to come. They looked at Xia Ruofei standing at the entrance of the alley and were stunned.

The leader, a gangster with yellow hair, sized Xia Ruofei up and laughed eerily.

“Oh! You’re a soldier! You’re not thinking of saving the damsel in distress, are you? I’m in a good mood today, so I won’t argue with you. Be sensible and get lost!”

Xia Ruofei looked at the yellow-haired gangster calmly.

“I’ll give you three seconds to let go of that girl. I can pretend nothing happened.”

The yellow-haired gangster was stunned. He exchanged glances with his two companions and the three of them burst into laughter.

The yellow-haired gangster pointed at Xia Ruofei’s nose and cursed.

“You ass*ole! Have you become f*cking senile from being a soldier or something? How dare you talk to me like this…”

“Time’s up!” Xia Ruofei said softly.

The moment he finished speaking, the yellow-haired gangster felt his vision blur. Xia Ruofei, who was two meters away, appeared in front of him in a flash.

Immediately after, the yellow-haired gangster felt a strong force on his chest and abdomen. He flew out involuntarily and landed on his butt in a waterhole. The dirty and smelly sewage water instantly splashed all over his body.

Xia Ruofei was so fast that the three hooligans did not even have time to react.

Xia Ruoxin’s attack was so powerful that it gave the three of them a shock. A hint of fear appeared in their eyes.

Whereas Xia Ruofei frowned and thought to himself.

“This damn illness is getting worse…”

When he attacked just now, he felt the weakness in his limbs worsen. His kick should have caused the yellow-haired gangster to lose his ability to move. Yet although he was covered in dirty water, he quickly stood up.

On the other side, the alcohol emboldened the yellow-haired gangster, who placed his hand on his waist. The fear in his eyes disappeared when he felt the tool that would give him an upper hand. Then, he glared at Xia Ruofei fiercely and pulled out the dagger from his waist. He licked his lips and said grimly.

“Brat, you are courting death…”

The other two hooligans took out their daggers at the same time and flung the girl aside. The three of them surrounded Xia Ruofei.

The girl covered her mouth in horror.

Xia Ruofei calmly protected the girl behind him. He gritted his teeth and rushed towards the three people who were surrounding him.

The girl looked at Xia Ruofei’s slightly skinny figure. Her eyes were covered with a layer of mist, and his back view seemed to become taller in an instant.

Xia Ruofei landed a beautiful kick on the yellow-haired gangster’s shoulder. There was a loud crack, and the yellow-haired gangster fell to the ground in pain. He started howling in pain. Xia Ruofei did not hold back when facing the three daggers swung at him.

After knocking out the yellow-haired gangster, Xia Ruofei turned sideways and dodged another thug’s dagger. The dagger flashed past his eyes. The situation was extremely dangerous. The girl screamed in fear.

The two hooligans exchanged glances. Gritting their teeth, they brandished their daggers and charged forward again.

Xia Ruofei calmly took a step forward and took the opportunity to snatch it. His swift steps allowed him to always stand between the hooligans and the girl.

Seizing the opportunity, Xia Ruofei rushed forward and accurately grabbed a hooligan’s wrist.

If it was in the past, the gangster’s wrist would be broken in the next second. However, at this moment, Xia Ruofei once again felt weak in his limbs.

He cursed in his heart. Gritting his teeth, he pulled hard and dodged to the side with the hoodlum.

However, he was still half a beat slower. A cold light flashed past, and with a sizzling sound, the other hooligan’s dagger cut through Xia Ruofei’s camouflage training suit, leaving a long wound on his arm. Fresh blood flowed out.

Xia Ruofei, who was unexpectedly injured, did not change his expression as he hit the hooligan’s face with his elbow, knocking him unconscious. Then, he grabbed the other hooligan’s wrist and threw him over the shoulders, causing him to fall onto the ground with a loud thud.

The thug rolled his eyes and fainted.

The girl was stunned. She did not expect this skinny man to be so strong. In less than 20 seconds, he had defeated all three of them barehanded!

However, Xia Ruofei frowned slightly. If not for that damn illness, this kind of untrained street ruffian would have been defeated in one move. Now, he was even injured. This was simply embarrassing the Special Forces!

He smiled bitterly and shook his head. He looked down at his trembling hands. Was there really no other way?

Keeping his emotions in check, he turned to the girl and said.

“Hurry up and leave! It’s not very safe here. It’s best if you don’t come out alone…”

“Thank you! I got it…” the girl said gratefully.

Following that, she exclaimed.

“Aiya! Your arm is bleeding…”

Xia Ruofei looked down at the wound on his arm nonchalantly and waved his hand.

“It’s nothing, just a small injury.”

“I… I’ll accompany you to the hospital to bandage it!” the girl said. “You were injured because of me!”

“No need. Leave quickly! I should go back too.” Xia Ruofei shook his head.

“That won’t do! What if it gets infected?” The girl tugged at Xia Ruofei’s sleeve and said, “Let’s go to the hospital! I’ll go with you!”

Xia Ruofei gently shook off the girl’s hand and said.

“There’s really no need. Goodbye!”

After saying that, Xia Ruofei strode forward. The girl wanted to chase after him, but she had sprained her ankle in the scuffle with the three hooligans. She was limping and could not keep up with Xia Ruofei, who was running as fast as he could. She could only shout from behind.

“Hey! I still don’t know your name…”

Xia Ruofei did not reply. He waved his hand without looking back and quickly disappeared around the corner of the house.

The girl looked at the yellow-haired man who was howling in pain and the two unconscious hoodlums. She was very scared and did not dare to stay here for long. She could only stare deeply in the direction where Xia Ruofei had disappeared before limping away from the scene.

Xia Ruofei quickly returned to his new residence. It was a small room that was less than 10 square meters. Other than a bed and a table, there was almost no place to rest.

He pulled out a box from under the bed and rummaged through it.

Xia Ruofei had just moved over and had yet to unpack his things when he went to transfer money to Hu Zi’s mother.

He remembered that he had placed the first-aid kit in this suitcase when he moved. The wound on his arm was quite long and deep. He had to treat it in time.

The box was a little messy. There were military medals that he had brought back from the army and some small items given by his comrades. There were also some old items left behind by his deceased grandfather. It was obviously difficult to find a small first-aid kit at once.

Xia Ruofei did not realize that while he was rummaging, a drop of blood dripped from the wound on his arm and landed on an unassuming scroll in the box.

When the blood landed on the surface of the scroll, it was like a snowflake falling into boiling water. In the blink of an eye, it disappeared without a trace.

After absorbing a drop of Xia Ruofei’s blood, the scroll suddenly emitted a faint golden glow, attracting Xia Ruofei’s gaze.

Xia Ruofei was stunned. What was going on?
