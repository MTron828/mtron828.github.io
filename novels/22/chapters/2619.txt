2620 Heading to the green cloud Island (2)

“Then we’ll leave tomorrow morning. You just need to be responsible for sending the plane to Beijing.” Liu Qunfeng said.

“OK! It’s decided!” Xia ruofei said.

“Mr. Xia,” Liu Qunfeng continued,”before we leave, please do a full body examination for my father. Also, I hope you can teach the medical staff how to deal with emergency situations if there are any changes to his condition.”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei replied readily,”let’s arrange it after dinner today!”

“Alright!” “Thank you,” Liu Qunfeng said.

“You’re welcome!”

……

There was nothing much to do during the day. Xia ruofei called Captain Liu An and asked him to land the plane at the Capital International Airport and wait for orders. He also informed him that he had to fly to Qingyun Island the next morning. There would be someone to liaise with him on the specific route application and route plan.

After Liu An received the mission, he immediately brought the flight crew to apply for a temporary flight route to Beijing. On the same day, the plane landed at Beijing International Airport and the flight crew found a hotel near the airport to settle down.

In the evening, after Xia ruofei had dinner, he took out a bag of Chinese medicine from the refrigerator next door. He heated it up and let elder Liu drink it.

Then, he used his mental power to perform a comprehensive examination on old man Liu and confirmed that his condition would not worsen in the short term.

In the end, Xia ruofei gathered the medical staff in charge of elder Liu and told them how to deal with sudden emergencies.

Of course, Xia ruofei’s method was very simple. Once elder Liu’s condition suddenly worsened, he could give him a bag of Chinese medicine immediately without considering the time and interval of the medicine.

If the situation still couldn’t be improved, they would have to decisively adopt Plan B. They urged Xia ruofei to use the afternoon to let Xia Qing make two pills in the medium. The ingredients in the spiritual heart Flower petals were more than the Chinese medicine in the vacuum bag.

Of course, in order not to let the Liu family think about the batch of pills that had been destroyed by Liu Lifang, Xia ruofei specifically asked Xia Qing to choose a new prescription. Whether it was the smell or the smell, these two emergency pills were different from the previous pills.

Xia ruofei had also repeatedly advised that only when elder Liu’s condition worsened and the Chinese medicine that was prepared in advance did not have any obvious effect could he use the emergency pill.

Furthermore, when taking out the pills, the requirement was the same as before. They must not come into contact with the skin.

After Xia ruofei emphasized a few things to take note of, he immediately warned again in a warning tone. Unless the condition worsened and the medicine was ineffective, the pill was not allowed to be used. If the old man’s condition was normal, taking the pill would not be beneficial. It might even cause danger because the medicine was too strong.

After these few days of interaction, the medical staff had long regarded Xia ruofei as a God. Naturally, no one dared to question his medical advice. They all nodded in agreement.

Liu Qunfeng, on the other hand, was on high alert. He carefully put the box containing the two pills into the refrigerator. He also sent two more guards to guard the refrigerator, not allowing anyone to get close.

Liu Qunfeng also made it clear that when Xia ruofei was not around, he was the only one who had the right to open the fridge. No one else was allowed to come near, including the core members of the Liu family.

At night, Xia ruofei held the origin crystal in his hand and sat on his bed to cultivate for a while. Then, he went to bed early.

The next morning, Xia ruofei had breakfast at the Liu family’s house and then took a bus to Jing International Airport with Liu Kuan.

Xia ruofei didn’t ask Wu Qiang to drive the car over for assurance. Instead, he directly used a commercial vehicle of the Liu family.

Xia ruofei and Liu Kuan successfully passed the security check in the private plane next to Beijing International Airport’s T2 terminal.

Soon, Xia ruofei saw the pilot, Liu An, who came to welcome him.

“Captain Liu, I transferred you here last minute yesterday. Thank you for your hard work!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“You’re too polite! This is our job. ” Liu An quickly said.

“Is today’s flight plan ready?” Xia ruofei asked,”this is the first time you’re all flying to this airport. However, the route is relatively simple and the airport is surrounded by the sea. There are no tall mountains or buildings, so it shouldn’t be too difficult for you.”

Regarding the issue of the route, the Liu family had specially assigned people to communicate with Liu An, which included the route from the capital to Qingyun Island. The Liu family had applied for it yesterday. In addition, since the airport of cyan Cloud Island was not open to the public, even the basic information such as the airport navigation platform, the switching of the Flight Information Region, the airport tower frequency, the instrument entrance procedure, and so on were not made public. Therefore, the Liu family had sent someone to contact Captain Liu An and directly sent this information to him.

“After receiving the data, the flight crew immediately drew up the flight plan and ran a simulation of the entire process,” Liu An nodded. It’s just as you said. As long as the weather gives us face, there won’t be any difficulty in this flight. And according to the current forecast, the weather conditions are very good!”

“That’s good!” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

Liu Kuan was still the same as before, keeping a low profile and not having much presence.

Xia ruofei and Liu An chatted as they walked, and Liu An quietly followed behind them.

After a while, the three of them passed through the passageway of the private aircraft building and arrived at the tarmac.

This time, paradise was parked in a long – distance plane, so the three of them took the commuting vehicle inside the airport and finally saw paradise.

After they got on the plane, Captain Liu An began to introduce the flight plan to Xia ruofei and Liu Kuan.””Mr. Xia, as this voyage is close to the Gulfstream G650’s limit, for safety reasons, we will land in Australia’s Cape to refuel. After a short stop, we will continue to fly to Qingyun Island. The entire journey is about 16 hours, and the flight time is relatively long. The two of you can choose to take a nap on the plane.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”it’s been a long journey. I’ll have to trouble the two of you.”

“You’re too polite!” Liu An said with a smile.

For a two – person flight crew, a continuous flight of 16 hours was indeed very tiring. In fact, according to the regulations of China Civil Aviation, such a long – distance flight had exceeded the stipulated continuous flight time. However, the peach source’s flight crew was not the airline’s staff. With the Liu family’s coordination, it was considered a matter of pushing the boundaries.

Xia ruofei said,”in the future, if there are more long – distance flights like this, I will recruit two more pilots. For non – long – distance flights, we will use a four – man crew. This way, you can take turns to rest.”

“Thank you, Mr. Xia!” Liu An said politely,”in fact, compared to Civil Aviation pilots, our overall working hours are still very short. It’s just that this kind of continuous flight is relatively longer, so it’s relatively harder. But we can persist, and please rest assured that it will not affect the flight safety.”

Xia ruofei nodded.”Anyway, it’s impossible to recruit pilots on the spot. I’ll have to trouble you this time.”

Liu An couldn’t help but laugh and said,””No problem!”

Xia ruofei continued,”how about this?” We’ll stop by Sydney on the way back and stay in Australia for a day. You can also rest. ”

Xia ruofei thought that since they were going to stop by Australia, why not take this opportunity to visit Paradise Farm and West Winery? The Hunter Valley was not far from Sydney anyway, so a day’s rest was more than enough for the flight crew to rest for a day before they continued their flight.

Liu Kuan’s mouth was wide open, but he didn’t say anything in the end. He subconsciously wanted to end things here as soon as possible and rush back to Beijing. After all, Xia ruofei wasn’t in Beijing. Whether it was him or Liu Qunfeng, they were both very worried about old master Liu’s health.

However, Liu Kuan remembered that before they left, old master Liu had told him to put Xia ruofei in charge, so he chose to remain silent.

“Alright! Let’s change our return flight plan. ” Liu An said,”Mr. Xia, I’ll go to the cockpit to make preparations!”

“Mm! Thank you for your hard work, everyone!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.
