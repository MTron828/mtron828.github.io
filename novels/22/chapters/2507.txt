2508 Rapid recovery (1)

Wu Lei finally returned to the hotel in the afternoon.

The club had arranged for an ambulance to take him from havimir’s surgical clinic to the central Grand Hotel.

Although Harvey mill did not recommend Wu Lei to be discharged so soon, after all, the facilities in the surgical clinic were more complete. However, Wu Lei’s surgery was very successful, and the follow – up rehabilitation training was not complicated. So when Wu Lei asked to be discharged, Dr. Havimir did not object. He was only responsible for writing the medical advice in detail and handing it over to the Spanish club’s team doctor.

Under Zhou leiyun’s personal care, the Spanish club adjusted a suite for Wu Lei. Wu Lei’s decision to undergo surgery was very quick. His family was still in China and could not make it in time, but the surgery was already completed. So, the club also hired professional care workers to take care of Wu Lei.

After Xia ruofei received the news, he personally carried the first aid kit to Wu Lei’s room.

Wu Lei’s room was quite lively. The Spanish club’s team doctor, interpreter, and the nurse the club hired for Wu Lei were all there.

Wu Lei, who was lying on the bed, saw Xia ruofei and quickly raised his hand to greet him.””President Xia!”

“Don’t move, don’t move ...” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you look good!”

Wu Lei was in a good mood after the operation. He smiled and said,””The doctor the club found is very skilled. He said the surgery was perfect and it wouldn’t affect his future career!”

“Hahaha! The heavens bless the good!” Xia ruofei laughed.”You’re the hope of our entire village! With the blessing of hundreds of millions of Chinese fans, how can the operation not be successful?”

...

After Wu Lei transferred to La Liga, he was jokingly called the “hope of the whole village” by the domestic fans because he was a Chinese player who entered the five major leagues again after many years.

Wu Lei laughed in embarrassment.

“Please wait outside for a while. Wu Lei and I have something to discuss,” Xia ruofei said to the translator.

The translator already knew that Xia ruofei was a shareholder of the Espanyol club, so he naturally did not dare to be negligent. He quickly nodded and said,”Alright! Alright!”

After they had left, Xia ruofei put the medical kit aside and said,””I’ll help you check first. ” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Then you’ll have to untie the equipment first ...” Wu Lei nodded.

“No need, no need ...” Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”Chinese medicine and Western medicine are different. I’m mainly checking the circulation of qi and blood.”

After that, Xia ruofei moved a chair over and sat on Wu Lei’s bed. He reached out and felt Wu Lei’s pulse.

Xia ruofei released his mentality and quickly understood Wu Lei’s physical condition. The operation on the scapular joint was a success. The joint reduction and the recovery of the ligament were both perfect.

Other than the operation, Wu Lei had some minor injuries.

This was also unavoidable for professional football players, but these injuries did not have much of an impact on him for the time being.

...

After Xia ruofei finished the examination, he was more confident.

The operation was very successful. What Xia ruofei needed to do now was to speed up the recovery of the wound, which was the most effective healing effect of the spirit Heart Flower petals.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””The situation is not bad! If there are no accidents, I should be able to recover in six or seven days!”

“Then I’ll have to trouble you, President Xia!” Wu Lei nodded heavily.

“The team will be setting off for Villarreal tomorrow. Are you feeling anxious?” Xia ruofei chuckled.

Wu Lei was a little embarrassed as he smiled and said,””I came here to play football! But next week’s home game is valekano. It would be perfect if he could play!”

Xia ruofei nodded in agreement and said,””It’s important to make your home debut. Vallekano’s strength is average. If you can play well, it will indeed be better for you to gain a firm foothold in the team.”

“Even if I can resume training, I’ve just had an operation. I don’t think the head coach will put me on the list!” Wu Lei said.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Haste makes waste. Let’s take it one step at a time. Let’s recover from our injuries first.”

“En!” Wu Lei nodded heavily.

Xia ruofei said,”my treatment idea is very simple. While applying the ointment externally, I will promote the circulation of qi and blood through acupuncture. This will speed up the absorption of the medicine and the recovery of the wound.” So I’m going to untie your shoulder, but you don’t have to worry, I’ll be extra careful and won’t cause your joint to shift. ”

...

“I believe you!” Wu Lei said,”to be able to develop such an amazing product like the jaded skin cream, your medical skills must be good!”

Xia ruofei could tell that Wu Lei was still a little nervous, so he smiled and said,””Of course! Even if it’s really dislocated, I can help you recover without the need for surgery!”

“President Xia, please don’t scare me anymore!” Wu Lei said with a bitter smile.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’m just joking. I’m just trying to ease my tension.”

With that, Xia ruofei reached out and carefully removed the strap on Wu Lei’s shoulder, revealing the wound.

He took out the ointment that he had prepared from the medicine box, then put on a pair of disposable gloves. The components of the spirit Heart Flower petals could not come into direct contact with his skin, or they would be absorbed by him.

Xia ruofei applied the ointment on Wu Lei’s shoulder evenly.

Wu Lei took a deep breath and said in surprise,””President Xia, this ointment feels very cool when applied, and the pain has been reduced by a lot! It’s really godly!”
