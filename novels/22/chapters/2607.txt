After Xia ruofei heard Liu Qunfeng’s story, he smiled and said,””I know. Chief Liu, I have indeed thought of many plans for your father’s condition, but this matter can not be rushed. I hope you and elder Liu can understand this. ”

“Of course! Of course!” Liu Qunfeng quickly said,”Mr. Xia, my father only wanted to express his gratitude. He didn’t mean to rush you.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”Secretary Liu, how about this ... I’ll go back today. Coincidentally, I’ve finished the Chinese medicine I prepared this time. There are a few rare medicinal herbs that I still need to buy from my friend. This prescription seems to be effective. I’ll prepare a few more days ‘worth of medicine and continue to take it to see.”

“Alright!” Liu Qunfeng said gratefully. Then I’ll leave it to you, Mr. Xia!”

Old man Liu’s condition had improved, and he had regained consciousness. Hence, Liu Qunfeng was not as anxious as before. At least Xia ruofei had left for half a day, so he did not feel as nervous as he had a few days ago.

“Mr. Xia, these herbs must be expensive!” Liu Qunfeng said. We can’t ask for your help and ask you to pay for it. How about this ... We ...”

Xia ruofei did not wait for Liu Qunfeng to finish and waved his hand. He smiled faintly and said,””We’ll talk about the money later!”

“This ... Isn’t very good, is it?” Liu Qunfeng said, stunned.

“Do you think I’m afraid you’ll go back on your word?” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”chief Liu, the most important thing now is to find the medicinal herbs on my list. Let’s put the other things aside first!”

“Alright, we’ll do as you say!” Liu Qunfeng said.

Xia ruofei left the Liu family’s residence on the same day. He did not ask Liu Qunfeng to send him off. Instead, he called Wu Qiang and asked him to pick him up.

Of course, Xia ruofei did not go to his friend’s place to purchase medicinal ingredients. He went straight back to the courtyard house in liuhai Lane.

The reason why he had to go home was that he had used up all his Chinese medicine and it was inconvenient to brew it in the Liu family’s house. On the other hand, it was also because he needed to enter the spirit map space. In the Liu family, he would not take out the spirit map scroll no matter what, even if the risk was extremely low when his mental power was on alert.

The spirit map space was of the highest level among all of Xia ruofei’s secrets. Even if there was a slight risk of being exposed, he would avoid it decisively.

If Xia ruofei wanted to enter the spirit map space, brewing the medicine was just a side trip. His main purpose was to challenge the Jade pillar array. It had been seven days since he last challenged the array. By now, three chances to challenge the array should have been refreshed.

After returning to the courtyard house, Xia ruofei said to Wu Qiang,””I won’t be having lunch later. Don’t come to my hospital if there’s nothing important. If there’s an emergency, you can call me.”

“Yes, boss!” Wu Qiang nodded and said. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Xia ruofei returned to the master’s courtyard, locked all the doors and windows, and drew the curtains, covering the room tightly.

In addition, he also habitually took out a few pieces of carved jade from the space, and with a wave of his hand, these jade stones with simple array patterns immediately flew in all directions, accurately falling in the position they should land, without the slightest deviation.

An alarm array was instantly formed.

Such a simple formation was not difficult for Xia ruofei at all. As long as he needed it, he could just take a few pieces of jade and carve it out. However, the effect was very good.

As long as someone came within three meters of the room, the alarm array would be triggered. The trace of Xia ruofei’s spiritual power in the outside world would be able to sense it at once. This way, no matter what Xia ruofei was doing in the space, he would be notified quickly.

After setting up the protective measures, Xia ruofei returned to his bedroom and summoned the spirit painting from his palm.

With a thought, he disappeared from the room.

After a short and familiar feeling of dizziness, Xia ruofei saw the scene in the space.

“Master!” After the loyal Xia Qing sensed Xia ruofei’s fluctuations, she did not hesitate to put down the work in her hands. She crossed from the mountain sea realm to the Archean realm and respectfully greeted Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei nodded and asked,””Has the space been fine these days? Are there any complaints from those free laborers?”

“Master, everything is normal,” Xia Qing said,”those ... Free laborers ... Are also very well – behaved! I followed your instructions and divided them into small teams, divided them into three or four levels, and let them manage themselves. The effect was very good!”

“Free labor” was a term that Xia Qing had learned from Xia ruofei. He still felt awkward when he said it, even though the term was so appropriate.

“Mm! “That’s good ...” Xia ruofei said. Then, he asked,”by the way, how’s the recovery of the guy with the broken leg?”

“You mean that guy with the strange name?” Xia Qing said,”his name is ... Manzila, right? This person’s recovery ability was quite good. Moreover, the environment in the spirit map world was so good that even the air had mystified spirit Qi, so his recovery speed was still very fast. He’s always wanted to apply for better medicine, saying that he wants to recover as soon as possible and then work for master. ”

Manzila was the leader of the modr organization, Satan, and also had the identity of a “high priest.”
