After checking, Xia ruofei went to the courtyard and sat down by the stone table. He took out a tea set from the spirit map space and lit up the charcoal in the mud stove. He poured the spirit pool water into the teapot and prepared to boil water to make tea.

The tea leaves were made from Da Hong Pao Pi Xiu, which was produced in the spirit map space. Although Xia ruofei had successfully cultivated the magical wild tea of the first heaven society, he was not so bold as to take out the wild tea to make in the territory of the first heaven society.

The boiling hot water was poured into the tea set, and a strong tea fragrance immediately filled the air.

Xia ruofei skillfully brewed a cup of tea for himself using the kungfu tea technique and took a sip.

At this moment, there was the sound of knocking on the door.

Xia ruofei didn’t use his spiritual power to check. After all, there were cultivators here. Even if Xia ruofei’s spiritual power was very high and others might not notice, it was still very rude.

What if it was an expert like Chen Nanfeng? even though the possibility was very low, Chen Nanfeng must be in seclusion to adjust his condition. If the other party noticed it, it could even cause a dispute.

Hence, Xia ruofei did not release his spiritual power. Instead, he stood up, walked through the courtyard, and opened the door.

When Xia ruofei saw the person standing outside the door, he could not help but be slightly surprised. He was surprised that the person who had come to visit was actually the sect leader of the star Seizer sect, Luo Qingfeng.

However, Xia ruofei thought about it and understood.

The star Seizer sect had always been a powerful sect, and they were definitely qualified to receive the first heaven society’s invitation. Furthermore, Chen Nanfeng and the others knew that Xia ruofei had a deep relationship with the star Seizer sect. Even if the star Seizer sect was weak, they would still invite Luo Qingfeng based on Xia ruofei’s reputation. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Sect leader Luo!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”are you here to attend sect leader Chen’s observation ceremony?”

“Yup! Elder Xia!” Luo Qingfeng said,”I just met sect leader Chen. He told me that you were staying here, so I came to visit!”

After all, this was the territory of the first heaven society. Hence, Xia ruofei was very careful and addressed Luo Qingfeng very formally.

Naturally, Luo Qingfeng understood it immediately and changed the way he addressed Xia ruofei.

Back then, Luo Qingfeng had publicly announced that Xia ruofei would become the Grand Elder of the star Seizer sect. This was announced to the entire sect, so the news had naturally spread to the entire cultivation world.

Hence, when he addressed Xia ruofei as “elder Xia”, no one would be suspicious. As for his attitude, it was normal. After all, Xia ruofei was the “Taishang elder”. Moreover, Chen Nanfeng, Mu Sheng and the rest still believed that there was a master in the primordial soul Stage behind Xia ruofei, and this master was from the star picking sect.

With this relationship, Xia ruofei could even be considered as Luo Qingfeng’s elder. There was no problem with Luo Qingfeng’s respectful attitude.

“Don’t stand at the door. Let’s go in and talk!”Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Alright!” Luo Qingfeng said.

The two of them walked into the courtyard. Xia ruofei turned around and closed the courtyard door. Then, she brought Xia ruofei to the stone bench Under the grape tree in the courtyard and sat down.

Following that, he casually set up a sound – proof talisman and then asked with a smile,””Qingfeng, how have you been? How are the disciples of the sect?”

“Master!” Luo Qingfeng bowed and greeted Xia ruofei respectfully.

When he saw Xia ruofei use the sound – proof talisman, he immediately changed the way he addressed her.

“Thanks to you, master,” Luo Qingfeng said,”the star Seizer sect’s development is going well. A group of talented young disciples have emerged. I’m preparing to focus on training them. I believe that in a few years, they will all grow into the backbone of the sect!”

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile and said,”you’ve been tied up by some daily affairs in the star Seizer sect. Otherwise, you could’ve gone to the peach source Island to cultivate.” 1 think that after you’ve cultivated a disciple at the Golden core stage, you can totally give him up and concentrate on your cultivation on the Peach Blossom Island.”

“Yes! Thank you, master!” “Yes,” Luo Qingfeng said.”I will definitely work hard to train my disciples!”

“Mm! Come on! Sit down and have some tea!” Xia ruofei greeted him with a smile.

Then, he sat down and picked up the kettle on the stove again to make tea.

“Master!” Luo Qingfeng quickly said.”Let me do it!”

“No need, no need …” Xia ruofei waved his hand.”Making tea is very particular about the feeling. I think it’s best if I make it myself!” Come! Try it!”

Then, Xia ruofei took out a clean teacup, poured out the filtered tea, and handed it to Luo Qingfeng with a smile.

“Thank you!” Luo Qingfeng took the teacup and thanked her.

The two of them sat in the courtyard. Xia ruofei was making tea while chatting with Luo Qingfeng.

After a while, there was another knock on the door.

Luo Qingfeng quickly stood up and was about to open the door when Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,””Let’s go out and take a look! There’s a constant stream of visitors today!”

Xia ruofei stood up and walked towards the courtyard gate, followed by Luo Qingfeng.

When Xia ruofei opened the door and saw the person standing outside, he quickly bowed and greeted,””Valley leader Liu! Miss Xin – er! How are you guys?”

It was Liu Mansha and her disciple, Yu xiner, standing outside. Liu Mansha had a gentle smile on her face, while Yu xiner seemed a little reserved. She did not look directly at Xia ruofei and lowered her gaze.

“Fellow Daoist Xia, I hope I didn’t disturb you by visiting so abruptly?” Liu Mansha smiled and said,”so sect leader Luo is here too!”

“Greetings, Valley master Liu!” “Thank you,” Luo Qingfeng said politely.

Although they were both sect leaders, the star Seizer sect and the flying flower Valley were not on the same level. At the very least, the strength of the flying flower Valley was still far stronger than the star Seizer sect.

Xia ruofei said with a smile,”Valley master Liu and miss Xin ‘er’s visit is really an honor!” Why would 1 disturb you? Please come in!”

With that, Xia ruofei moved to the side and made an inviting gesture.

Liu Mansha smiled and nodded before walking into the courtyard with Yu xiner.

Xia ruofei led the two of them to the stone table in the courtyard and sat down.

This stone table was matched with four stone chairs, and it couldn’t fit another person.

Xia ruofei poured away the tea leaves and replaced them with new tea. After brewing the tea skillfully, he poured a small cup for everyone and smiled.”! originally wanted to pay a visit to Valley master Liu, but 1 was afraid of disturbing senior. I didn’t expect that Valley master Liu would personally come to visit. This junior can’t help but be terrified!”

Liu Mansha smiled and said,”we’re all guests here. We’re just visiting each other. There’s no need to be so particular!” Moreover, Xin ‘er also benefited a lot from the exploration of the mystic Luna realm the last time. Our entire soaring Flower Valley also benefited from it. Speaking of which, we all owe you a favor! If not for your Black Phoenix flying ship, no one would have been able to land on the moon!”

Xia ruofei smiled,”Valley leader Liu is too polite!” Everyone was cooperating fairly, and it was hard to say who was indebted to whom. Lady Xin ‘er was able to gain something in the mystic Luna realm because her strength and talent had met the standards of the mystic Luna realm. Otherwise, even if 1 brought her into the mystic Luna realm, she would definitely gain nothing and might even lose her life! Didn’t elder mu Hua of the surging waves sect and elder Shen tianfang of the first heaven sect die in the mystic realm?”

Liu Mansha sighed and said,”that’s right!” In front of a true power, we are all like ants. So what if we are at the Golden core stage? He just died in the secret realm…”

Liu Mansha continued,”fellow Daoist Xia, sect leader Chen should be very confident in his breakthrough this time. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have invited so many guests to come and observe the ceremony.” Looks like the first heaven sect will be the strongest sect in the cultivation world in the future.”

Xia ruofei’s heart was as clear as a mirror. He knew that Chen Nanfeng’s breakthrough had caused Liu Mansha and Mu Sheng, the sect leaders of the top sects, to feel a sense of crisis.

Although the first heaven society was stronger than everyone else, the overall difference in strength was not so great that it was difficult to catch up with them. However, once Chen Nanfeng broke through to the nascent Soul Stage, he would be absolutely invincible, at least on the surface.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”yes!” If sect leader Chen could successfully break through, he would be the only person in hundreds of years who could reach this height. His glory would definitely be unparalleled! The other sects are much dimmer in comparison..”
