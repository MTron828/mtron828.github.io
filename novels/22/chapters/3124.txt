3125 Chapter 1706 – no matter big or small (1)

Song Qiming already had the most direct understanding of a cultivator’s martial strength. His own strength had increased dramatically and had exceeded the scope of a normal human.

According to Xia ruofei, he was still at the beginning stage of cultivation. He was one of the lower Qi refinement stage cultivators. Then, wouldn’t the destructive power of a high – Level Qi refinement stage cultivator or even a golden core cultivator be even more terrifying?

Song Qiming could not help but think of the mysterious characters in swordsman novels who could take someone’s head from thousands of miles away. If such a person really existed, it would undoubtedly have a great impact on the order of real society.

In fact, song Qiming’s judgment was not far from the reality. Although a cultivator in the Golden core stage who could control a flying sword could not take a head from a thousand miles away, he could still do it from dozens of miles away as long as his spiritual power could reach it.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh when he heard the question.

At that moment, song Qiming was more like a normal political figure.

It seemed that his emotions had really calmed down, because he had begun to consider the problem from the angle he was used to.

“Uncle song, you don’t have to worry too much about this.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”the world of cultivation has existed for thousands of years. The current world of cultivation can be traced back to hundreds of years ago. However, in the long history, there have been almost no cases of cultivators causing trouble among the ordinary people.”

Xia ruofei paused and continued,””Cultivators spend most of their time on improving their cultivation. As I said earlier, their ultimate goal is actually to live forever. They usually have no time to care about other things, and the glory and wealth of the secular world are like floating clouds to them, not worth mentioning. To put it bluntly, even the ordinary people of the secular world are no different from ants in the eyes of some cultivators. ”

Song Qiming could not help but smile bitterly. Although Xia ruofei’s words were straightforward, he put himself in her shoes and felt that it was normal for most cultivators to have such thoughts.

“Also, I heard that there are unwritten rules in the world of cultivation.” Xia ruofei continued,”unless there are extremely special circumstances, they are not allowed to interfere with the operations of the secular world. They are especially not allowed to attack the friends and family of cultivators in the secular world. Otherwise, it would be a huge taboo and they might even be hunted down by the entire cultivation world. Of course, the authenticity of this news has yet to be confirmed. In fact, I know very little about the cultivation world, and I’ve only learned a lot of things recently. ”

What Xia ruofei said was exactly what Chen Xuan had told him today.

Of course, he couldn’t trust Chen Xuan unconditionally. Even though the news was reasonable, he had always had his doubts. This was a good habit of his.

“Ruofei, if that’s the case, I’m much more at ease.” Song Qiming nodded and asked,””By the way, the individual strength of cultivators has far exceeded the limits of human beings. Then ... Is it possible for the power of the cultivation world to be used by our world ... By the secular society?”

“Uncle song, I’ve said it before, cultivators are very indifferent people. Their utilitarian heart is only reflected in the improvement of cultivation and the fight for cultivation resources.” Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”The matters of the secular world are undoubtedly fleeting to them, so ... You’d better not have such thoughts as soon as possible. More than 70 years ago, a war that concerned the fate of the country broke out. At the beginning of the war, Huaxia was defeated and lost a large amount of land. Tens of millions of soldiers and civilians died in the war, but the cultivators still did not stand up. Or rather, only a small number of cultivators took action, but that doesn’t affect the overall situation ...”

After Xia ruofei said that, song Qiming completely gave up.

He smiled bitterly.”I should’ve thought of this long ago. In history, when China was at a critical moment of life and death, the cultivators didn’t stand up. How can we expect them to contribute to society now?”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”actually, it might be a good thing if there are no cultivators interfering.” A power that had completely lost its balance was difficult to control. Also, it’s not like the cultivation world and the secular world have no interactions at all ...”

When song Qiming heard this, he could not help but tense up. He quickly asked,””Ruofei, is there anything else?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”in recent years, the advancement of modern technology has also attracted the attention of the cultivation world. In addition, because cultivation resources are becoming more and more difficult to obtain, many cultivation sects have begun to pay attention to the power of the secular world. Basically, those who have a certain influence in the cultivation world have also begun to develop their own industries in the secular world ...”

Xia ruofei looked at the nervous song Qiming and smiled.””However, the reason why they developed secular industries was to further understand the development of modern technology. At the same time, they used the power of the secular world to help them find some cultivation resources. Therefore, these industries were basically legal and compliant, and in the process of operation, they were also done according to the rules of the secular world. There was basically no such thing as using the special means of cultivators for profit. Of course, because of some special resources in the world of cultivation, their industrial development in the secular world is usually more smooth ...”

Song Qiming suddenly thought of the jaded skin cream, heart – nourishing soup, and the delicious – looking vegetables and fruits that were popular all over the world. He could not help but blurt out,””For example, the Paradise Corporation that you founded?”
