Zhou leiyun nodded and turned to look at Xia ruofei. He asked,””President Xia, do you think ... There’s anything else you need to tell me?”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””I won’t be looking at your press release. Xiaochen will just release it according to the script. I just want to know one thing. Is there a big screen or projection device in the conference hall next door that can play videos?”

As the club’s Executive Vice President, Jiang Xiaochen naturally did not know about such trivial matters. Hence, he quickly looked at the club’s press officer and repeated Xia ruofei’s question in Spanish.

“No problem!” The press officer nodded. There was a 70 – inch TV on the side of the press conference hall, which could directly play videos when needed. You just need to copy the video file to the computer in the control room. ”

There was a small room in the corner of the press conference hall that was used as the control room. It was mainly used to control the audio and lighting equipment. During the press conference, there were specialized technical staff in charge of operating it. The large television on the side of the conference hall was also connected to a computer in the control room. After setting it up in advance, it could play the video on the computer at any time.

Hearing this, Xia ruofei nodded his head in satisfaction. Then, he took out a CD and handed it to the press officer.”Then you can copy the video here to your computer in advance. Forget it ... Take me there!”

Xia ruofei was speaking Spanish, but Jiang Xiaochen had been translating in Zhou leiyun’s ear, so he heard Xia ruofei’s words immediately.

“Director Xia,” Zhou leiyun said,”just leave these small matters to them.”

Although Zhou leiyun did not know what Xia ruofei was going to play at the press conference, he thought that it was just a small matter and there was no need for Xia ruofei to do it personally.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’m free now anyway. General manager Zhou, you and Qingxue can sit here for a while. I’ll be back soon!”

Xia ruofei then gestured for the press officer to bring him to the control room in the conference hall next door.

The press officer did not dare to delay and quickly led the way.

The technicians in the control room were already in position. Xia ruofei saw that there was only one computer in the control room. After he asked if the computer could be connected to the big TV outside, he let the technicians and press officer leave first. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Then, Xia ruofei personally copied the video from the CD to the computer and tried playing it on the computer to make sure that there were no problems.

Only then did he turn off the player, then called the technician in and ordered,””I’ll let you play a video at the press conference later. I’ve already copied it to the desktop. The file name is ‘AA’, that’s it ...”

Xia ruofei pointed at the video file on the computer desktop. The technician took a look and immediately said,””I understand! Don’t worry, Sir! This is easy!”

Xia ruofei nodded.”You need to pay attention to two things. First, you need to pay attention to the content of the conference at all times. When I say ‘ask staff to play the video’, you must immediately complete the screen synchronization and play the video. Second, before I ask you to play the video, you can’t open this video file without permission. I’ve already tried playing it normally, so you don’t have to try again. ”

The technician’s expression turned cold, and he quickly said,””Yes! Mister! I’ll definitely do as you say and will never open the video file without permission!”

There were surveillance cameras in the control room. When they were waiting outside, the press officer had already told the technician Xia ruofei’s identity. How could he dare to ignore Xia ruofei’s words? No matter how curious he was, he did not dare to watch the video in advance. After all, it was not easy to find a job these days.

“Darker,” the press officer warned,”you must remember Mr. Xia’s words. If you go against them, no one can help you!”

“I understand! I understand!” The technician, dark, quickly said.

Xia ruofei patted darker’s shoulder and said in a friendly tone,””Alright, then I’ll leave this matter to you. It’s been hard on you!”

“You’re welcome. This is part of my job!” Said darker, feeling flattered.

After Xia ruofei had settled everything, he returned to the lounge next door.

At this time, the media reporters had already arrived at the venue. The press officer was busy arranging their seats while Xia ruofei and the others were drinking tea and chatting in the lounge, waiting for the press conference to begin.

Zhou leiyun was very curious about Xia ruofei’s unusual participation in the press conference. However, since Xia ruofei was not willing to say, he did not ask. Anyway, no matter what Xia ruofei’s purpose was, it would be revealed in a while.

It was almost nineo’ clock. Jiang Xiaochen reminded Xia ruofei in a low voice.

Xia ruofei nodded and stood up. He smiled and said,””Director Zhou, I’ll be going then!”

Zhou leiyun nodded and said with a smile,””We’ll just wait here for the news!”

Xia ruofei took two steps and turned back.””Qingxue, Weiwei, can you stay in Spain for a few more days?”

Ling Qingxue and Song Wei were stunned at first, then they exchanged a look. Song Wei smiled gently and said,””No problem! Anyway, I’ve already taken leave. The sun is so good Spain, so I’ll just take it as a vacation!”
