Chapter 498: Love me and don’t go (2)

The middle – aged man had only found out about Heibao and his men’s deaths on Baofeng mountain when he received the police’s notice in the early hours of the morning. He had contacted Heibao and was on his way to Green Bull Mountain after hearing that they had succeeded. He was puzzled as to why Heibao and his men had suddenly gone in the opposite direction of Baofeng mountain and fallen off the cliff to their deaths, and why the woman had not been in the car.

However, the middle – aged man was already in a terrible fix because of Liang Haiming’s death, and he didn’t want to cause any trouble. Although Liang Haiming thought highly of hei Bao, Liang Haiming was already dead, so why would the middle – aged man care about hei Bao’s life or death? the only thing he was thinking about right now was how to get away with his punishment.

The middle – aged man would definitely not do something that might make the situation more complicated or even make him bear more responsibility, so he decided to hide it without much hesitation.

In any case, at this juncture, it was better to avoid unnecessary trouble. It was definitely not a mistake. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

In fact, the only people who knew about this other than him were Liang Haiming, Black Panther, and the other three who had gone out to do business today. Now that the others were all dead, as long as he didn’t tell them, no one would.

Therefore, the middle – aged man quickly sent several people from the company to the police to deal with the funeral and did not cause any more trouble.

The terrain around Baofeng mountain was steep, and there were many accidents in the past, so there were not many cars passing by. Many drivers would rather take a detour than cross the mountain. In addition, they found some broken pieces of wine bottles in the wreckage of the car at the scene of the accident. There were almost no signs of braking at the accident site, so the police quickly came to a conclusion: It was a traffic accident, and the driver was likely to be suspected of drunk driving.

However, the fire had destroyed all the evidence and the people were dead, so there was nothing to pursue.

The middle – aged man, who was the only one who had guessed that Xia ruofei had something to do with this, was chased out of the Liang family and had gone abroad.

Hence, that night when Xia ruofei had gone on a killing spree, it had passed by peacefully.

Perhaps Xia ruofei did not realize it himself, but he insisted on not letting his hatred rest overnight. That night, he used that unbelievable method to kill Liang Haiming, which indirectly helped him cover up the previous killing.

One could imagine that if Xia ruofei had not made a move that night, Liang Haiming would not have let the matter rest after hearing about the death of Heibao and the others. He would have used all his connections to investigate the matter thoroughly.

If Xia ruofei wanted to get away with it, he would have to use some of his official connections.

No matter what, this incident did not cause Xia ruofei any more trouble. His life quickly returned to normal.

Of course, this was another story.

Xia ruofei was not so sure now, so he was prepared to deal with the police if they found out.

However, in front of Ling Qingxue, Xia ruofei had to act very relaxed. Otherwise, he would only add to Ling Qingxue’s troubles.

“Qingxue, let’s not talk about this anymore. Trust me, it’ll be fine.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“En!” Ling Qingxue nodded and hugged Xia ruofei even tighter.

Xia ruofei kissed Ling Qingxue’s forehead affectionately and said,””It’s my fault for not being considerate enough to arrange for someone to protect you. Otherwise, this wouldn’t have happened. ”

“How can I blame you?” Ling Qingxue said,”you’re not a God. How could you have expected something like this to happen?”

Xia ruofei shook his head.”No matter what, your safety is very important. I’ll look for candidates tomorrow and arrange two capable female bodyguards for you. Otherwise, I won’t be at ease.”

“Ruofei, I don’t want to ... I’m not used to having people following me everywhere!” Ling Qingxue shook her head.

Xia ruofei’s attitude was firm. He said,””No, you have to listen to me! I don’t want such a thing to happen again. If something happened to you today, I would really go crazy ...”

Ling Qingxue could feel Xia ruofei’s concern for her, and her heart felt warm.

However, she still frowned and said,””Ruofei, this is a small probability event. How can it happen so often? Isn’t it making a mountain out of a molehill to have two bodyguards with you every day just because of this?”

“I don’t think so,” Xia ruofei said. Qingxue, uncle Ling’s net worth is in the hundreds of millions. It’s hard to guarantee that no one will have designs on you in the future when they see money. In short, I can’t allow any possibility of an accident to happen. This loophole must be fixed!”

Ling Qingxue could not help but smile bitterly at Xia ruofei’s words. She knew that Xia ruofei was concerned about her, and at the same time, he was still afraid of what had happened today. So, she could not bear to reject Xia ruofei’s firm attitude.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”how about this? I’ll look for a suitable candidate as soon as possible. She doesn’t need to be your full – time bodyguard. She can be your assistant!” I’ll help you deal with the company’s Affairs, accompany you during business activities, banquets, and so on. I’ll try my best to protect you during your personal time without disturbing you. ”

Since Xia ruofei had already said so much, Ling Qingxue could only nod and say,””Alright, I’ll do as you say ...”
