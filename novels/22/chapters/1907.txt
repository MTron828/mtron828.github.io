Chapter 1908 The prey takes the bait (2)

Feng Jing’s assistant, Liu Qian, had already left for Hong Kong. The MA family didn’t look down on her just because she was a small assistant. Ma Zhiming immediately hired a Vice President of the auction house to meet Liu Qian.

The Hengfeng auction house did its best to meet all of Liu Qian’s requests. Whether it was the venue layout or the publicity plan, they respected Liu Qian’s opinions very much. The communication between the two sides was very smooth.

In addition, the site selection for the pharmaceutical factory was still in progress.

After a round of inspection, Xue Jinshan and the others were actually more inclined to stay in Changping. Especially after hearing about the preferential policies in Changping County, everyone was even more tempted.

However, Xia ruofei had his own plans. He just didn’t say it out loud. He asked Xue Jinshan and the rest to continue their investigation. They could go to a few more places, and they didn’t have to be confined to the area of Sanshan city.

When Xu You’s call came in, Xia ruofei was in the middle of a face – to – Face discussion with Xue Jinshan. The special ringtone of the mobile phone rang. Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and said to Xue Jinshan,””Kanayama, that’s all for today! You can send a letter in the name of the company first, and then go to the local government to investigate. I think the local government will be very welcoming!”

Xue Jinshan laughed bitterly to himself. Of course they welcomed him, and they were so enthusiastic that he even felt a little uncomfortable. In the end, he could only choose one place to build the Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory. It was like there was only one daughter in the family, but there were many young men who admired her. It was a headache to choose someone to be her mother. It was better to just choose a young man who had been very pleasing to the eye before.

However, since Xia ruofei had given the order and he was obviously going to answer the call, Xue Jinshan naturally did not waste any more time. He stood up and said,””I understand, Chairman. However, we still have to be careful with the location. If we don’t complete this step, the subsequent plant design and even the production line will be affected ...”

“I know what I’m doing!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Xue Jinshan did not say anything more. He bowed slightly to Xia ruofei and left his office.

Xia ruofei waited for Xue Jinshan to leave before he took out his phone and answered the call.”Old Xu, did you find anything?”

“Boss, there’s been some progress.” Xu Yougang said,”we’ve already found out that the target has a mistress in Sanshan city. The two of them often meet up in a high – end apartment in the West Lake Mansion. The identity of this mistress has also been confirmed. It’s the host of Sanshan TV station’s City Channel, Fang Chenchen. She’s a married woman. ”

“Well done!” Xia ruofei clenched his fist excitedly and said,”old Xu, not bad! You’re very efficient!”

“You’re too kind, boss!” Xu Yougang said humbly,”we’ve already installed audio and surveillance equipment in the apartment. If everything goes well, we should be able to collect the information you want very soon!”

“Mm! Remember, you must ensure your own safety while carrying out this mission. I still stand by my words, this mission will not give you a time limit!” Xia ruofei said.

In fact, the reason why the location of the Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory had not been chosen was because of Liu haojun. Before he made Liu haojun look bad, Xia ruofei would not let this project be settled in Changping and give Liu haojun his achievements for nothing.

However, he did not rush Xu Yougang because of this. From his point of view, the safety of the staff was always the top priority. As for the pharmaceutical factory project, it was just a delay in making money. The market was there, and it was an exclusive business. The money would be earned by him sooner or later.

Hence, Xia ruofei was not in a hurry. He was like a Hunter waiting for his prey to fall into a trap.

“I understand! We’ll be very careful!” Xu Yougang said, feeling touched.

Xia ruofei replied,”yes!” One more thing, after you succeed, remember to remove all traces and don’t leave any traces!”

“Yes!” Xu Yougang said,”if you don’t have any other instructions, we will continue working ...”

“Good, you’ve worked hard, brothers!” Xia ruofei said,”after the mission is completed, I’ll treat everyone to a vacation. The company will pay for it!”

“Thank you, boss!” Xu Yougang said. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei leaned back on the soft office chair. There was a trace of coldness in her eyes as she muttered to herself,””Liu haojun ... You’ll pay for your arrogance soon!”

He had received a message from Zhao Yongjun today. After Wu Liqian arrived in the capital, she had been picked on for no reason during her registration for the training class. She didn’t want to trouble Tian Huilan with such a small matter, so she found the phone number that Xia ruofei had sent her and found Zhao Yongjun.

With Zhao Yongjun’s help, this small problem was naturally solved.

Needless to say, this kind of underhanded means must be Liu haojun’s doing. Xia ruofei’s hatred for this person deepened. He was obviously from a big family, but he always liked to do these disgusting little tricks. It was really not presentable.

……

Xu Yougang had thought that Liu haojun would be quiet for a few days after his rendezvous with Fang Chenchen. He was prepared to wait for a few days.

What he didn’t expect was that Liu haojun’s thirst was even more unbearable than he had imagined.

Perhaps it was because life at the grassroots level was too boring, or perhaps it was because the weather was gradually getting hotter, Xu Yougang received a call from Wang Chong, who was in charge of keeping an eye on Liu haojun today, on the afternoon of the third day. He was informed that Liu haojun’s car had left the Changping County party Committee compound and was heading in the direction of the city.

After a while, Zhang Aijun, who had been keeping an eye on Fang Chenchen, called and said that Fang Chenchen had left the TV station in her car. She seemed to be heading in the direction of the West Lake Mansion.

Xu Yougang immediately perked up. He ordered them to follow him closely and to report the situation at any time. Then, he went to the small bedroom and woke up Zeng Liang, who was taking a nap.

“Liang, stop sleeping!” Xu Yougang said,”we should have work to do today!”

Zeng Liang rolled out of bed and said,””They’re coming?”

“Yes!” Xu Yougang nodded.”You go to the window and watch. I’ll watch the surveillance!”

“Alright!” Zeng Liang said excitedly,”this adulterous couple is really impatient!”

“Isn’t that good?” Xu Yougang laughed and said,”the earlier we finish, the earlier we can get the money! Besides, although the boss didn’t rush us, I can see that he should be more anxious. ”

The two of them chatted and laughed as they walked out of the bedroom and quickly got into position.

Wang Chong and Zhang Aijun’s information kept coming in, and they had basically confirmed that Liu haojun and Fang Chenchen were at the West Lake Mansion.

After about 20 minutes, Zeng Liang said,””Fang Chenchen’s car has entered the estate!”

Xu Yougang also ran to the window to take a look. He saw the red beetle car slowly driving into the community. After parking the car, Fang Chenchen got out of the car alone and quickly walked into Building No. 3.

Liu haojun had come from Changping District, so he would probably need some time.

Two minutes later, Xu You saw the door of unit 1902 open on the surveillance screen and Fang Chenchen walked in.

After she changed her shoes at the door, she began to take off her clothes as she walked to the bedroom. She didn’t notice the existence of the camera in a very hidden position at all.

Xu Yougang quickly looked away. He did need to monitor Liu haojun and Fang Chenchen, but he could not peek at a woman’s body under such circumstances. Even though he knew that Liu haojun’s arrival would definitely be a lot more erotic than this, it was still part of his job to record the scene of the two of them being intimate. Now that Fang Chenchen was the only one in the room, it was not part of his job. It was a matter of principle.

Xu Yougang turned his head, but the headphones were still on. Soon, he heard the sound of running water. He turned back to look at the screen and saw that the door of the master bedroom was closed. The lights were on. Fang Chenchen must be taking a shower.

This once again proved that the audio recording effect of the monitoring equipment was excellent.

After more than ten minutes, Fang Chenchen came out in a bathrobe, drying her hair with a towel as she walked.

It was also at this moment that Zeng Liang said,””Old Xu, Liu haojun’s car is here too!”
