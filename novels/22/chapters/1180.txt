Chapter 1181: Jade skin cream press conference (Part 1)_2

Translator: 549690339

Not long after he signed up, Huang Yu received a private message from his Weibo to his surprise. He was invited to attend the press conference, and there was a series of random codes in the private message as proof of entry.

Huang Yu immediately reposted the event’s information to the customer – making forum.

It was also because of Huang Yu’s repost that there were hundreds of people responding to the press conference. Otherwise, there might be even fewer people responding.

After Huang Yu met up with a few forum friends at the subway station, they headed to the school together. On the way, they met a few other forum friends, and the team grew bigger.

These customers often went to all kinds of activities and were all from the capital Area. As a result, many of them knew each other and chatted as they walked. The atmosphere was very relaxed.

As Huang Yu walked, he couldn’t help but feel puzzled. He said,””Why do I feel like there aren’t many people! In the past, there should be a sea of people at such events!”

The forum members were also discussing spiritedly.

“Yup! I’ve never heard of this company before ...”

“Is there a problem with the event? It took me more than an hour to get here by train, don’t waste my time ...”

“I also feel that it’s too cold and cheerless!”

Someone else said,”Hey!” Since you’re already here, don’t be pretentious. It doesn’t cost us a penny anyway, so just take it as a walk! Isn’t it fine for you to just stay at home? It’s not good for your health to stare at the computer every day!”

“You’re right, Dacheng!”Huang Yu laughed. Brothers, since we’re here, we’ll take things as they come!”

Everyone chatted and laughed, and they soon arrived at the entrance.

A few slim and beautiful female staff members immediately smiled and greeted them,””Are you here to attend the press conference? Please come here to collect your entry pass!”

Huang Yu and the others came to the registration counter, showed a random serial code, and after verification, they received a green entry card with a two – dimensional code printed on it.

“Everyone, please enter the venue this way!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Huang Yu looked at the bags of gifts behind the counter, smiled, and walked toward the entrance according to the staff’s instructions.

They were all regular customers of various events and knew that the gifts were collected at the exit. If Yingying gave out the gifts at the beginning, many of the audience members who came for the gifts would definitely leave early.

Thus, Huang Yu and the others began to enter the arena while chatting and laughing.

At the end of the entrance passage, they swiped the QR code on the admission pass and entered smoothly. After that, there was a security check, and they entered the stadium.

Huang Yu looked at the empty stands and couldn’t help but be stunned for a moment. He muttered to himself,””Tsk ... There really aren’t many people here! Did we come early because we remembered the time wrong?”

A friend beside him couldn’t help but take out his phone to look at the event details and said,””The time is right!”

“Forget it,” Huang Yu shook his head and said,”let’s not care about it! Let’s go and find a seat ...”

In any case, they were here for the gifts. They had already seen bags of gifts at the signing counter, all of which were beautifully wrapped. To Huang Yu and the others, this was enough.

They didn’t care about the number of people or what product was going to be released at the conference.

The seats were also divided into many areas.

In the middle were naturally reserved seats and the reporter’s stand. On both sides, there were two levels of stands for the ordinary audience, which were also divided into several sections.

Huang Yu and the others quickly found their seats according to the sign on their admission passes.

As Huang Yu and the other ordinary audience members who came for gifts, curiosity, or other reasons entered the venue, the media reporters also began to sign in.

The treatment of reporters and ordinary audiences was definitely different. If these uncrowned Kings were not served well, their writing would be slightly crooked, and that would ruin things.

Therefore, every reporter who signed in received an envelope containing the transportation fee and a bag of gifts.

The contents of the gift bag were slightly better than the average audience. There was a set of jaded skin cream and a new album by Duff.

Ji Yanwu was a senior reporter from the Red Star society.

He brought a new reporter who had just been admitted to the society to interview the press conference.

Along the way, Ji Yanwu was also puzzled. For this kind of press conference, sending a newcomer was already giving face. There was nothing wrong with not coming. He really did not understand why the leader sent him here, and it was even a task personally assigned by the deputy managing editor.

Naturally, the Deputy editor would not tell him the cause and effect of the matter. He only solemnly told him to do a good job in the interview and specifically reminded him not to put on airs as a big reporter.

Ji Yanwu had been in this line of work for almost 20 years. To be able to become a senior reporter, he was naturally not a stupid person. Therefore, even though the organizer of this press conference was unknown and the whole incident was strange, he still attracted enough attention.

This was the first time the newcomer, little Zhao, was attending a press conference. He was excited and nervous at the same time. When he signed in to collect the transportation fee, he was even a little shy, unlike Ji Yanwu who was calm.

The two of them took their things and began to walk into the stadium.

“Teacher Ji, the color of our envelopes is different from those reporters ‘!” Xiao Zhao whispered.

Ji Yanwu laughed as if he was used to it and said,””We’re the Red Star society. Can we have the same treatment as the media?”
