The rich District was generally more remote. Although Li Yifu also had a business in Los Angeles, he still had to wait for a car to pick him up, so he didn’t refuse Elon Musk’s good intentions. He smiled and said,””Then, thank you, Mr. Masker!”

Li Yifu’s family background and status were similar to that of Elon Musk. Therefore, Elon Musk naturally sent him out personally. Xia ruofei stayed in the room on the grounds of observing and taking care of little X to prevent Li Yifu from feeling awkward.

If Xia ruofei had personally sent him off, Li Yifu would definitely be very anxious.

In fact, the two of them had already come to an agreement. Li Yifu would not be of much help even if he stayed. He would leave the Elon Musk family’s house first. On one hand, he would prepare the funds. On the other hand, he would talk to Song Wei, Ling Qingxue, and the others about the situation. He would let them stay in the hotel first and wait patiently.

This included Chen Xuan and Yu xiner. They could report the progress to their elders in the country. They had been waiting too anxiously.

Li Yifu still had to go to Houston to prepare a place to receive the supplies.

Elon Musk’s SpaceX and many of his partner companies were near Houston, so it was the most convenient place to receive equipment and supplies.

The dozen or so spacesuits were still fine, but the key was that there were still two to three thousand oxygen supply modules. If he could also buy a simplified version of the Dragon Ship, the space needed would be even larger. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Therefore, Li Yifu had to prepare a large enough warehouse in advance. At the same time, it was good in concealment and other aspects.

These things could not be done by others, so he had to do it himself.

Xia ruofei waited in little X’s room for a while before elonmask and gramus returned to their room.

Little X finally woke up after a while.

Glams quickly asked the nanny to prepare some milk because the little guy had been smacking his lips as soon as he woke up. He was obviously hungry.

What made Elon Musk and Glaus more excited was that little X was not like usual. When he was awake, he would cry and squeal. Malignant tumors were often accompanied by intense pain. When it acted up, even an adult would be in so much pain that they would not be able to live, let alone an ignorant baby.

When little X woke up this time, he only pouted his lips and cried a few times. Then, he began to suck on his finger. It was obvious that he was crying because of hunger and not pain.

The child couldn’t speak, so elonmask and gramus naturally couldn’t ask him how he felt. But after comparing the two, the two could still feel that the treatment effect seemed to be very obvious.

Not knowing if it was a psychological effect, Elon Musk and Glaus even felt that little X’s complexion was much better than in the morning.

This was only the effect of the first acupuncture, and the two were naturally surprised and happy. At the same time, they were full of hope for the future of the treatment.

The nanny quickly brewed half a bottle of milk and carefully measured it to make sure that the temperature was within the right range before coming over to feed little X.

As soon as the mouth of the milk bottle touched his lips, the little guy opened his mouth and began to suck in big mouthfuls. His little hand subconsciously held the milk bottle.

In a short while, half the bottle of milk was finished.

“Mr. Masker, Ms. Grams, little X has a good appetite today!” The nanny said in surprise.

He knew that the little guy had been crying for the past two days, but he couldn’t drink much every time he fed him. He would often cry because of the pain, which would cause him to vomit the milk that he had tried so hard to feed.

Today, he had only received acupuncture for about half an hour, and there was such a big improvement. Gramus was so happy that his eyes were filled with tears, and he kept expressing his gratitude to Xia ruofei.

At this time, the Butler who had been sent by Elon Musk to buy medicine in Chinatown returned.

Not only did he bring back the medicine that had been boiled and sealed in a vacuum bag, but he also bought a large amount of medicinal herbs according to Xia ruofei’s request.

The staff was moving the herbs to the room next to Yingying’s room, which had been arranged for Xia ruofei to live in. The herbs that Xia ruofei needed would naturally be placed in his room.

Along with the medicinal herbs, there was also equipment for decocting Chinese medicine. There were even several bags of exquisite charcoal.

“Mr. Xia, this medicine ...” Elon Musk had already gotten a bag of brewed Chinese medicine, and the rest were placed to the side.

Xia ruofei smiled.”You can take one now. Keep the rest in the refrigerator. Take it half an hour after your meal.”

With that, Xia ruofei reached out and touched the vacuum – sealed medicine bag in Elon Musk’s hand, then said,””The temperature is a little low. How about this! He prepared a small basin of water and heated up the Chinese medicine bag before drinking it. In the future, he would do the same thing every time he took out Chinese medicine from the refrigerator. The temperature ... Should be around the standard of not burning the mouth! It shouldn’t be too high, but it shouldn’t be too cold either, or else my stomach won’t be able to take it. ”

“Understood!” Elon Musk threw the Chinese medicine bag in his hand back into the large plastic bag, which contained the remaining Chinese medicine.

He gestured to the housekeeper to keep the herbs himself and help him heat one of the bags.

Xia ruofei also stood up and smiled.””Then I’ll take my leave first! Since the ingredients are all prepared, I’m going to start preparing the medicine. I’m just next door anyway, so if there’s any situation, you can call me at any time!”
