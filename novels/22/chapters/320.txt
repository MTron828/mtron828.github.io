Chapter 321: The first step into the overseas market (1)

“The second condition is ... A part of the farm in Australia is to be used as a breeding base for purebreds.” Elder Tang said,”I hope that this part of the operation and management will be relatively independent and I will be in charge. In addition, in the future, if you want to change the use of this part of the farm, you must get my consent.” The most important thing to elder Tang was the breeding base for purebreds on the farm. As for the rest of the cultivation and breeding, he didn’t care at all. It was a good thing to be able to cooperate with Xia ruofei and bring him some economic benefits, but even if he lost money, elder Tang wouldn’t care. Xia ruofei replied without hesitation,”no problem!” These two conditions could be written as hard terms in the share transfer agreement! Old man, do you have any other requests besides these two?” “There’s nothing else. Oh, right ...” Elder Tang thought of something and added,”there are a dozen or so horses on the farm that I own privately. They’re only under the name of the farm, so I have to make it clear to you that I’ll transfer their ownership back to my own name before I transfer the shares.” After elder Tang finished speaking, he half – jokingly said,””This isn’t a transfer of assets!” The dozen or so horses were all the old man’s treasures. Each of the world’s top horses was worth a lot, and their combined value was definitely far more than the farm’s value. Naturally, it was impossible to pack them up as the farm’s assets. “Understood!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”old master, I want to have the controlling rights mainly because I want to be able to decide on the operations of planting and breeding on my own. As for the horse racing, you have full authority. Moreover, that horse race originally belonged to you, so it’s only right that you transfer it away!” “Then there’s no problem!” Elder Tang said happily,”brother Xia, I wish us a happy cooperation!” “Happy cooperation!” Xia ruofei also smiled happily. He was still very interested in the farm that elder Tang owned in Australia. In the past two days, he had searched the internet for news of elder Tang’s acquisition of the farm. At that time, all the major web portals had reported about it, and the headlines were basically ‘Chinese tycoon in Australia spends a lot of money to acquire a farm’ and so on. Hence, Xia ruofei had a basic understanding of this high – Quality farm in the Hunter Valley through the internet. Now that he could control such a large farm, Xia ruofei was naturally very happy. Sooner or later, Tao Yuan farm would break out of China and enter the world. In that case, let this farm in Australia be Tao Yuan farm’s first step to the world! After hanging up, Xia ruofei got out of the car with his bag. “Brother Xia, you’re back?” Ye Lingyun greeted him with a smile. “Ling Yun, prepare two more dishes for lunch. Let’s have a drink!” Xia ruofei nodded. “Alright!” Ye linyun agreed. “Brother Xia, I’ve contacted some of my former comrades about the recruitment you mentioned last time. There are about five or six people who are interested. What do you think ...” Ye Lingyun continued. “Alright!” Xia ruofei said happily,”let them all come over!” “Aren’t there too many people?” Ye linyun asked. “What’s so much about five or six people?” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”ask them to come over. As long as they are capable enough, our company will take them all!” “Woof! Thank you, brother Xia!” Ye linyun said gratefully. The comrades he had contacted were Yingluo from poor families. If they had a good future after retiring from the military, they would not have chosen to work for ye Lingyun. After all, Xia ruofei was only hiring security guards. These comrades would not know the potential of the Paradise Corporation. Even if they were Just Security guards now, their future would not be worse than working as white – collar workers in big companies. Xia ruofei was willing to recruit all his comrades into the company. Their poor living conditions would soon improve. Ye Lingyun knew that Xia ruofei paid his employees a high salary. Ye Lingyun was naturally happy to be able to help his comrades who were in trouble. As for the problem of ability, ye Lingyun was not worried at all. These comrades of Yingluo were the backbone of the Army. Their military quality was first – Class, and two of them had even won awards in the group military competition. Ye Lingyun did not dare to take people of average quality to Xia ruofei’s company. Xia ruofei was very happy that he had managed to settle the Australian farm today. In the afternoon, he drank a bottle of Eight Immortals drunk in the space with ye Lingyun and went upstairs to rest, feeling a little tipsy. He slept until five in the evening. Xia ruofei’s phone rang and woke him up. He picked it up and saw that it was manager Lu. He picked it up immediately. “Hello, manager Lu!” “Xiao Xia, are you on the farm now?” Manager Lu asked. “He’s here!” “It’s like this, the Bureau chief has already convinced old Mr. Li to come over to your place to recuperate for a period of time. ” Manager Lu said,”we’ll leave now. Please prepare the room and dinner.” Xia ruofei sat up on the bed and looked at the clock on the wall.””No problem! I’ll be ready soon, so you can come over at any time. ” “Oh right, manager Lu, will the chief come along?” Xia ruofei asked. “The Bureau chief won’t be coming this time. I’ll be accompanying old Mr. Li.” Manager Lu said,”you also know that the Bureau chief is coming out. It’s going to cause a huge commotion ...” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”sure!” I got it. ” After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei immediately got up and washed up. Then, he went downstairs to find ye Lingyun and told him to prepare dinner for two or three more people. Then, Xia ruofei started to prepare a room for li Zhifu. For the convenience of the elderly, it was naturally arranged to be on the first floor. The guest room next to ye Lingyun’s room was empty, but there were brand new bedsheets and blankets at home, so Xia ruofei quickly tidied up the room. Not long after he finished tidying up the room, manager Lu and Li Zhifu’s car arrived at the farm’s entrance. After Receiving Manager Lu’s call, Xia ruofei went out to greet him. Soon, he saw a blue Buick minivan driving over slowly. “Little Xia, I’ll have to trouble you during this time!” Li Zhifu said after he got off the car. “You’re welcome, old Mr. Li. I’m more than happy to welcome you!” Xia ruofei said. He then turned to manager Lu and said,”manager Lu, let’s go in and have a meal together!” “No, the chief can’t do without me,” manager Lu shook his head and said,”I’ll go back now!” Xiao Xia, I’ll have to trouble you to take care of old Mr. Li. ” Before Xia ruofei left guling courtyard, he had told them that if li Zhifu was willing to stay on the farm for a while, he could take good care of him. There was no need to arrange for a doctor or nurse. The main reason was that Xia ruofei found it troublesome and inconvenient to live with so many people. “Don’t worry!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”old Mr. Li is with me. I’m sure he’ll be fine!” “Then I’ll be leaving first. Please take care of old Mr. Li’s matter!” Manager Lu nodded. After seeing manager Lu off in his car, Xia ruofei smiled at li Zhifu and said,””Old Mr. Li, let’s go and eat first!” Li Zhifu didn’t move. He stood in the courtyard and looked into Xia ruofei’s eyes. He asked calmly,””Xiao Xia, tell me honestly. What illness do I have?”F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com
