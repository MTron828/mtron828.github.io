Translator: 549690339

Xiao Qiang, who had just been promoted to Chief Marketing Officer, was in a good mood. Although the integration of the Department had not been completed, and the company’s headquarters had not moved, his office was still the same. However, he could not help humming a song as he made tea and began his day’s work.

Hearing the knock on the door, Xiao Qiang raised his voice and said,””Please enter!”

He looked up and immediately laughed,””It’s Xiaoyu! Is there something you need?”

Fang Xiaoyu was the business backbone under him. She could take the lead in many of the marketing department’s work, so she was naturally Xiao Qiang’s confidant, so his attitude was quite kind.

“President Xiao!” Fang Xiaoyu said nervously,”I’m here to admit my mistake ...”

“Yo! What’s wrong with this?” Xiao Qiang asked, puzzled.

“Last night, the news about our company’s Annual Meeting caused quite a stir on the internet. In fact, the earliest post was posted by my classmate from my friend’s circle.” Fang Xiaoyu said,”this incident has affected the company negatively. I ...”

“Just this?” Xiao Qiang laughed and said,”what kind of mistake is this? Yesterday, I also went online to take a look. The response was quite good! To think that you’re in the field of marketing. This kind of hot topic of public opinion is hard to come by. What’s wrong with not spending a single cent on such a good advertisement this time?”

Fang Xiaoyu’s eyes widened in surprise.”But ... I’ve seen a lot of negative comments about the chairman on the internet. I’m afraid ...”

“You’re afraid that the chairman will be angry?” Xiao Qiang laughed and said,”you’re underestimating the Chairman’s mind!”

He stood up and poured Fang Xiaoyu a glass of water, then said,””I’ll tell you the truth! Last night, I found out that the pictures circulating on the internet were from your friends, and I immediately called the chairman to explain the situation. ”

“What did the chairman say?” Fang Xiaoyu asked nervously.

“What do you want him to say? Give you a good scolding?” Xiao Qiang laughed and asked.

Then, he patted Fang Xiaoyu’s shoulder and said,””Don’t worry! The chairman didn’t care at all! He even said that this might be a good thing for the company!”

“Really?” Fang Xiaoyu finally felt relieved.

“As the company grows, there will be more and more public opinions like this.” Xiao Qiang said earnestly,”the chairman is a person who does big things. How could he vent his anger on his subordinates over such a small matter? Besides, you’re not to blame for this! There were at least one or two hundred employees who posted on their moments last night! It’s just that your classmates just happened to upload this content to the internet!”

“My classmate is a little unreliable ...” Fang Xiaoyu said, embarrassed.

“Go back to work in peace!” Xiao Qiang smiled and said,”the Spring Festival is approaching. You must not relax! It’s very likely that you’ll enter the 50 – person reward list! And the member rankings are about to be decided, so your performance during this period is especially important. Don’t let your last moment of slacking go to waste!”

“I understand! Thank you, President Xiao!” Fang Xiaoyu puffed out her chest and said,”then I’ll go back to work!”

Usually, Fang Xiaoyu and the others called Xiao Qiang “director,” but today, when everyone met him at work, they all called him “President Xiao.” Xiao Qiang felt an unspeakable comfort in his heart. He laughed and said,””Go, go! Don’t think about all that nonsense!”

After the annual meeting, the employees of paradise Corporation were more or less in a state of excitement.

On one hand, everyone would receive a good year – end bonus.

On the other hand, the long Chinese New Year holiday was coming. The company had issued a notice that the company’s property price was 10 days, which was three days more than the national holiday. In this way, everyone could go home on the 27th of December and come back to work on the 7th of the first month. It was not a holiday, and they did not need to go to work on the weekends after the holiday.

As for those who volunteered to stay on duty, Xia ruofei even instructed the finance department to pay them overtime pay according to five times their salary, which was far more than the average treatment.

This meant that if he stayed for seven days during the new year, his overtime pay would be higher than a month ‘s.

Many young employees volunteered to stay behind. However, other than the factory, which had to maintain production, the company didn’t need too many people to stay behind for other positions. Therefore, some people who volunteered to stay might not be able to do so.

The flagship store of paradise Corporation on the e – commerce platform had stopped shipping goods after the 25th of December. However, it still received orders as usual and would only start shipping goods after the holiday.

Under the administration department’s arrangements, they purchased many lanterns, China knots, and so on, decorating the farm with a jubilant atmosphere.

As night fell, the Red Lanterns on both sides of the farm Road lit up, adding to the festive atmosphere.

This year, Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao didn’t come to the farm. They decided to spend the new year in their new house.

When that time came, Xia ruofei would naturally go over to accompany the mother and daughter. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

However, squad leader Luo’s widow, Lin Yue ‘e, brought her daughter, Nan Nan, and squad leader Luo’s father back to their hometown.

They still had many relatives in their hometown, so they wanted to return to their hometown during the spring Festival.

Xia ruofei had specially approved Lin Yue ‘E’s leave and asked her to return home on the 25th of December. He had also asked the administration department to help him buy train tickets and had even sent a car to send his family to the train station.

......

On the 26th of December, the streets of the three mountains were filled with a festive atmosphere. Many shops along the street hung red lanterns, and the window displays were filled with window decorations and paper cutting with Chinese characteristics. All kinds of promotions were also endless.
