Chapter 1550: Top – grade purple jade (2)

Translator: 549690339

In other words, Xia ruofei already knew that there might not be any Jade in the raw stone He Ping picked out. Perhaps the Jade inside was very ordinary, which was proven by the facts.

Xia ruofei was very clear that the real essence of this raw stone that he had spent 8.6 million on was in the other half of the material that He Ping had abandoned.

Xia ruofei didn’t care about everyone’s mockery or He Ping’s mocking gaze. He was very focused on grinding away the stone Skin with the hand grinder.

Everyone was waiting to see Xia ruofei make a fool of himself.

Time slowly passed, and he Ping said a little impatiently,””I think you might as well go straight to the cutting machine! How long are you going to grind like this?”

Xia ruofei stared at the raw gemstone and asked without looking up,””Did I ask you to wait?”

“You ...” He Ping was so angry that he blew his beard and glared. He snorted coldly and said,”I’d like to see how long you can hang on! You really won’t give up until you’ve reached the Yellow River!”

Xia ruofei pursed his lips and ignored the old man. He continued to Polish his sword slowly.

Just as everyone was feeling drowsy, the sharp sound of grinding wheels suddenly stopped.

“Eh?” Fatty Luo looked over.”Little brother, you’ve finally given up?”

“I should have given up long ago. It’s meaningless!”

“Why do you have to make things difficult for yourself!”

......

Xia ruofei did not care about their sneers. He went to the side and fetched a basin of water to wash the cut surface that he had just polished.

Then, he looked up and grinned at Yu mingdong,””President Yu, I think I saw some Jade meat. Come over and help me take a look. I really don’t know about these things!”

“Mr. Xia, there are wins and losses in stone gambling. There’s no need to be too concerned about ... What!” Yu mingdong only reacted halfway through his sentence.”There’s green? This ... How is this possible?”

“Did I see it wrong?”

“Little brother, Are you sure?”

The onlookers also asked one after another.

Xia ruofei didn’t care about this group of bored people. He directly said to Yu mingdong, who had already walked over,””President Yu, come and take a look. I trust your judgment!”

Yu mingdong walked closer, reached out, and wiped the cut. He leaned closer to take a closer look.

Yu mingdong’s eyes were about to fall out. He was dumbfounded and only said after a long while,””This ... This ...”

He Ping said impatiently,”chief Yu, what did you see?” Why are you so scared? Don’t tell me you really believed his words?”

“It rose! It’s increased!” Yu mingdong’s voice trembled as he shouted,”it’s rising!”

He Ping’s entire body trembled, and he took two steps forward. Without caring about his image, he laid on the raw stone and looked at it for a long time. His face also turned red and white.

At this time, the onlookers had also guessed what had happened, but they didn’t know what it was that could scare Yu mingdong and he Ping like this.

“President Yu, is there really Jade?”

“What kind? How’s the water source?”

“Old he, tell everyone!”

Yu mingdong looked at Xia ruofei as if he was a monster and said,””It’s the rare Violet Jade! It’s at least an ice – Type, maybe even a glass – Type!”

A single stone caused a thousand ripples. The onlookers gasped in surprise and looked at Xia ruofei with envy.

Yu mingdong also felt like he was dreaming. Just this small window alone was worth more than 8.6 million. It could be said that Xia ruofei’s raw stone was definitely worth more than that.

Yu mingdong thought it was unbelievable. Xia ruofei knew nothing about stone gambling, and even an expert like he Ping had come to a conclusion. He Ping’s judgment was basically confirmed when he cut the stone, so how could the other half of the “waste” have such a heaven – defying top – Level Jade?

If Xia ruofei had not been angry, no one would have even looked at this piece of trash. It might have even become a stone for the table ...

Thinking of this, Yu mingdong couldn’t help but marvel at Xia ruofei’s heaven – defying luck.

He Ping’s face alternated between red and white, and he still stubbornly said,””Only a small window has been opened. We don’t know what’s going on inside yet! Maybe there’s very little Jade meat ...”

After everyone heard He Ping’s words, they no longer had the sense of authority they had before. Most of these people were Jade merchants, and they all looked at Xia ruofei with burning eyes.

“Little brother, do you want to sell this material?”

“I’ll pay 9 million! Little brother, please sell it to me!”

“9.5 million, I’m taking it!”

......

These people seemed to have forgotten how they had mocked Xia ruofei just now. Now, they were all trying to get close to Xia ruofei. Even fatty Luo, who had ridiculed Xia ruofei the most, was smiling like Maitreya.

Boss Luo said,”little brother, don’t continue to open this material. What if it collapses again?” Let’s be friends. I’ll take the 10 million!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Xia ruofei glanced at the Jade merchants indifferently, then turned his gaze to Yu mingdong and asked,””What do you think, President Yu?”

Yu mingdong smiled bitterly and said,”Mr. Xia, I can’t give you any advice on this. If we continue to open it, it may rise sharply, but it may also collapse. If we cash it out now, it’s safe, but we may lose some money ...”

Xia ruofei snapped his fingers and said,”Then let’s continue! Anyway, the experts have already said that this is a piece of trash. If it collapses, so be it! I’ll just treat it as trash!”

When Xia ruofei spoke, he looked at He Ping with a smile that was not a smile. He Ping’s expression was as ugly as it could be. He wanted to leave, but he still held a glimmer of hope. If Xia ruofei continued to cut the stones and eventually collapsed, he could at least save some face.

Seeing Xia ruofei’s firm attitude, everyone sighed and knew that it was impossible for them to pick up the treasure.

Of course, none of them left.

After all, this kind of rare high – Quality Jade was not easy to come across. Everyone was in this line of work, so they naturally wanted to see it.

In addition, even if it turned out to be a good material, they still had a chance to buy it! The competition might be a little intense, but once they bought it, it would be very beneficial to their respective Jade processing factories.

Xia ruofei politely declined master Xie Shi’s help. He personally picked up the hand grinding machine, turned it on again, and continued to grind the raw stone.

Everyone knew that Xia ruofei was a newbie and was afraid that he would slip and wear off the Jade. However, they soon realized that their worries were unnecessary.

Xia ruofei’s hand was terrifyingly steady. The Jade inside the raw stone was definitely irregular, but he could steadily grind off the stone Skin without damaging the Jade at all. He could even ingeniously use the angle of the grinding wheel to remove the stone Skin from the irregular parts.

It looked like a butcher dismembering an ox, with an inexplicable sense of beauty.

Everyone was secretly amazed.

As the stone – cutting process continued, He Ping’s heart started to sink. It seemed like it was impossible to lose the bet now. Just the part that had been cut out so far was worth at least 20 million Yuan. There was still a small part of the raw stone wrapped in the stone Skin. Who knew how much Jade was still inside ...

He Ping also cursed in his heart, this kid is really lucky!

Xia ruofei’s heart was as calm as water as he focused on cutting the stone. The onlookers did not even dare to breathe loudly as they watched a rare purple jade slowly appear ...

Finally, Xia ruofei turned off the hand grinding machine.

Everyone gathered around eagerly, and the stonecutter eagerly brought over a basin of water.

Xia ruofei placed the purple jade into a basin of water. After washing off the stone chips on the surface, the Jade revealed its true appearance.

Everyone could not help but gasp.

Presented in front of everyone was a piece of Violet Jade. Purple jade was rare to begin with, and the rich color of this purple jade could be said to be rare in the world. When the Jade was placed in a basin, it was as if the water in the basin had turned into an intoxicating purple.

There were also beautiful floating flowers inside the Jade. The unique natural floating flowers seemed to form a scroll.

In addition, most of this piece of Jade had a strong penetration ability and looked watery. Most of the people present were insiders, and they could almost determine the quality of this Jade at a glance.

There was no doubt that this was a top – grade Violet Jade of the glass type!
