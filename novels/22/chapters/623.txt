Chapter 624: Bringing a loli back to the farm (3)

Tian Huixin looked at Xia ruofei with a smile. She knew that a young man like Xia ruofei would not know how to take care of a child, let alone bathe one.

She thought for a moment and said,”we’re on the plane today. She definitely has to take a bath. How about ... I help Huanhuan take a bath in Biyun’s room, and then you can go back?”

“I don’t want to!” Huan Huan shouted. I’m going to brother ruofei’s place to wash up!”

Tian Huixin smiled bitterly and said to Xia ruofei,””Little Xia, you see ... Why don’t we trouble you for a bit?”

Could he not agree? The answer was definitely no ...

Xia ruofei looked at Huan Huan helplessly and slowly nodded. He felt that his head was full of black lines.

Soon, Tian Huixin dragged her suitcase downstairs. She was carrying a small bag in her hand, which contained Huanhuan’s change of clothes, pajamas, and pajamas.

Tian Huixin handed the small bag to Xia ruofei and said,””Xia, I’ll go back to my father’s place now. I’ll leave Huanhuan to you.”

“No problem. Aunt Huixin, don’t worry!” Xia ruofei felt that his smile was a little bitter.

Huan Huan could not wait to wave at her mother.”Goodbye, mommy!”

After going downstairs, Tian Huixin sent Xia ruofei and Huanhuan to the car. She carefully fastened the seat belt for Huanhuan and closed the car door. After watching Xia ruofei’s car leave the hotel, she got into the Mercedes – Benz from Hengfeng group’s Sanshan office and headed to the expert villa area of Sanshan University.

As Xia ruofei drove, he quickly turned his head to look at Huanhuan. The little girl was sitting in the front passenger seat with a smile on her face. Her legs were still beating to the beat of the music in the car, looking very comfortable.

Xia ruofei sighed in his heart and continued to drive seriously.

......

Along the way, Huanhuan was very excited and chattered non – stop with Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei really liked Huanhuan and would always chat with her patiently.

From the city to the suburbs Changping, Xia ruofei told five fairy tales. Huanhuan, who had slept for an entire afternoon, was still wide awake. Her big eyes blinked, and she looked very excited. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Soon, the car drove into Taoyuan farm, and it was almost Seveno’ clock.

At this hour, many employees would be taking a walk in the beautiful farm after dinner, so Xia ruofei slowed down his car.

When the car was about to reach the small villa, Xia ruofei saw Feng Jing taking a stroll under the streetlight.

“President Feng!” Xia ruofei stopped the car slowly and greeted her by rolling down the window.

“Chairman, you’re back?” Feng Jing asked with a smile.

Then, her eyes swept over to the cute little loli in the front passenger seat and she exclaimed in surprise,””What an adorable little girl! Chairman, could this ... Be your daughter?”

Just as Xia ruofei was about to explain, Huan Huan, who was sitting in the passenger’s seat, pouted and said,””What’s with the pretty auntie’s eyes! How could I be brother ruofei’s daughter? I’m the daughter of my parents!”

Feng Rao felt as if she was about to melt from how adorable she was. She did not realize that calling Huanhuan by her name seemed to make her sound older. She smiled and said,”Chairman, this little girl is so cute!”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and said,”she’s my friend’s daughter. She asked me to take care of her for a day ... CEO Feng, you can continue with your walk.” I’ll go back first, I still have to help this little girl wash ...”

At this point, Xia ruofei suddenly stopped and turned around to stare at Feng Jing.

Feng Jing felt a little uncomfortable under Xia ruofei’s gaze, and her pretty face started to heat up. She thought to herself, why is the chairman looking at me so strangely? Could he be ...

“Mr. Feng, have you bathed a child before?” Xia ruofei suddenly asked.
