2424 The world of cultivation (1)

At that moment, Liu chengfeng felt a huge pressure. Under the pressure, his head felt like it was going to explode, and he almost lost all ability to think.

However, Liu chengfeng had been cultivating for decades. Unlike Xia ruofei, he had a lot of battle experience, so he had made a defensive response almost subconsciously.

However, the difference in their spiritual power was too great.

Xia ruofei was at the spirit gathering stage, while Liu chengfeng had only reached the spirit throb stage. Crossing a major realm was an absolute suppression. Besides, Xia ruofei was learning and applying it now. He had imitated Liu chengfeng’s spiritual power combat technique by 70 – 80%, and his spiritual power attack had almost doubled.

Liu chengfeng gritted his teeth and held on. He felt like a small boat floating on the stormy sea, in danger of capsize at any time. The other party might be able to kill him with just his spiritual power.

Liu chengfeng finally realized that he seemed to have kicked an iron plate, and his heart was filled with regret.

A thought appeared in his mind: Could it be that the person in front of him was an old monster who had hidden himself from the world?

In the sect’s ancient records, there were also records of some senior experts. These people usually did not appear in the world easily, but each and every one of them had a terrifyingly high cultivation.

Once a cultivator reached the Yuanying stage, they could change their appearance at will, and even low – Level cultivators couldn’t see through it.

The moment Xia ruofei released his spiritual power, he showed a crushing force. It seemed very easy, which made his previous performance seem even more like a cat playing with a mouse.

It was no wonder that Liu chengfeng would have such an idea.

Liu chengfeng wanted to beg for mercy, but he couldn’t even open his mouth now. He could only clench his teeth and hold on. At this moment, he was so regretful that his intestines were turning green.

Liu chengfeng could feel his bones creaking. Once his spiritual power reached a certain level, he could completely crush his opponent into meat paste with just pressure.

This was Liu chengfeng’s current situation. If it weren’t for his strong body and his spiritual power, which had reached the spirit throb stage, his bones and armor would have been broken inch by inch.

As time passed, the despair in Liu chengfeng’s heart continued to grow. His spiritual power was almost exhausted, but the spiritual pressure from his opponent did not weaken at all. Xia ruofei looked extremely relaxed and even had a faint smile on his face. It was obvious that he still had some strength left.

Just when Liu chengfeng felt that he was about to be suppressed to death by his spiritual power, he suddenly felt his body relax. The spiritual power that had made him despair had disappeared.

Liu chengfeng fell to the ground, his clothes soaked in sweat. His eyes were filled with extreme fear. He panted heavily and said to Xia ruofei,””Senior, this junior was blind. Please spare my life ...”

With such terrifying spiritual power and the legendary origin crystal, which was a cultivation – aiding treasure, in Liu chengfeng’s mind, Xia ruofei was definitely an old monster who had not left the mountain for hundreds of years. He might even be a nascent soul old monster.

Xia ruofei’s face was uninterested. He pouted and said,””Too weak! You can’t hold on anymore?”

Liu chengfeng didn’t even dare to raise his head. He could only keep begging for mercy.

In fact, he didn’t know that the person in front of him was not a nascent soul old monster! In fact, Xia ruofei’s cultivation was slightly higher than Liu chengfeng ‘s, but not by much.

Xia ruofei’s cultivation was close to refined Qi level 9, and Liu chengfeng had already reached refined Qi Level 7.

Although there was a huge gap of two levels, Xia ruofei did not practice any combat skills. If Liu chengfeng had not used his spiritual power to suppress Xia ruofei at the beginning but had used combat skills directly, the outcome of the battle would have been uncertain.

However, Liu chengfeng wanted to be more relaxed and chose the most disadvantageous method. In the end, not only did he fail to suppress Xia ruofei, but he also allowed Xia ruofei to master some spiritual power combat techniques and was crushed.

Liu chengfeng’s mind was on the verge of collapse. He couldn’t even muster up any will to resist.

“You’re Liu chengfeng, right?”Xia ruofei said indifferently.

“Yes, I am a disciple of the fallen leaves sect ...” Liu chengfeng said with a trace of hope.

Of course, the sect was just a glimmer of hope for him. In fact, although the fallen leaf sect used to be very glorious, in recent decades, the Earth’s spiritual energy had been barren, and the strength of the fallen leaf sect had also declined.

Not only the fallen leaves sect, but the entire cultivation world was facing the problem of a lack of cultivation resources.

Furthermore, some of the sect’s former experts had disappeared without a trace for unknown reasons, which had also caused a great impact on the sect’s strength.

The current sect master of the falling leaves sect was only a late Jindan.

This was also because the fallen leaves sect had saved a lot of resources for thousands of years, which was why they were able to create Jindan cultivators.

After passing on the cultivation to this generation, some of the resources of the fallen leaves sect were almost exhausted, and the phenomenon of the sect’s lack of talent was becoming more and more serious.

The one in front of him was most likely a nascent soul old monster, or at the very least a golden core cultivator. Liu chengfeng had no confidence that the name of the falling leaves sect would be able to make him fear him.

However, at this point, he could only make a last resort.

After hearing Liu chengfeng’s words, Xia ruofei’s voice turned cold. He asked indifferently,””Do you think I should be afraid of your falling leaves sect?”

“I wouldn’t dare!” Liu chengfeng quickly replied in fear. He didn’t dare! I have misspoken, please forgive me, senior!”

“Raise your head!” Xia ruofei said coldly.

Liu chengfeng raised his head uneasily, but he did not dare to meet Xia ruofei’s eyes.

With a thought, Xia ruofei summoned the blue travel immortal sword from his dantian.

The flying sword danced around him like a fish. Liu chengfeng was shocked when he saw it.

It was actually a flying sword! Furthermore, one could tell that the flying sword was of very high quality.

How long had it been since such a high – grade flying sword had appeared in the cultivation world?

Although a small number of golden core cultivators in some sects also had flying swords, compared to this senior’s flying sword, those flying swords were simply fire sticks!

The sect leader of the falling leaves sect also had a flying sword. This was the only flying sword the sect had, and it was their true treasure. It was completely different from the so – called “spirit accumulation Pearl” that Liu chengfeng had just casually fabricated.

But with just a glance, Liu chengfeng knew that this senior’s flying sword was more than one grade higher than his sect master ‘s!

This further confirmed Liu chengfeng’s judgment. If he wasn’t a reclusive nascent soul old monster, how could he have crystals and high – grade flying swords? These things were almost extinct in the current cultivation world!

Xia ruofei said playfully,”young one, you’ve offended me. Tell me ... How should I punish you?” Do you want to leave an arm or a leg? Or should I just turn you into a human stick?”

“Senior, please spare me! Senior, please spare my life!” Liu chengfeng kneeled on the ground and kept kowtowing for mercy with a sad face.

At this moment, Xia ruofei’s eyes lit up. He used his spiritual power to crush Liu chengfeng. This time, his spiritual power was stronger than the one Xia ruofei used in the battle. He was not holding back at all.

Liu chengfeng did not dare to move at all. He had long given up on resisting. So, almost instantly, he was dragged into a Deep State of hypnosis by Xia ruofei.

This was also because he was scared out of his wits by the spiritual power confrontation just now. Otherwise, with his cultivation of the palpitating stage, Xia ruofei would not have been able to hypnotize him so easily. Some time ago in Africa, Xia ruofei had to spend a lot of time and effort to successfully hypnotize even Manzila, who had just entered the threshold of cultivation.

Liu chengfeng’s eyes became dull.

Under the investigation of Xia ruofei’s spiritual power, there was no way for him to hide whether the other party was really in a state of hypnosis.

Xia ruofei showed a satisfied smile and asked,””Let’s talk about the current situation in the cultivation world! Let’s start with your fallen leaves sect ...”

Liu chengfeng said without hesitation,””Yes! Reporting to senior, the fallen leaves sect has been passed down for more than a thousand years ...”

The conversation went on for more than an hour before Xia ruofei finally finished.

Through this hypnosis session, Xia ruofei had finally gotten a lot of information about Huaxia’s cultivation world from Liu chengfeng.

Nowadays, the cultivation world had few talents and cultivation resources. Many sects had not entered the world for a long time. However, with the deterioration of the cultivation environment, whether these sects were constantly entering the world in search of an opportunity to break through, or had closed their gates to form their own system, they could not avoid the cruel reality of their strength declining.

In the current cultivation world of Huaxia, the five major sects were the strongest.

Other than Liu chengfeng’s fallen leaves sect, there were four other sects: the five elements sect, the Jade sword sect, the nine suns sect, and the dry Zen temple.

The five major sects all had golden core stage cultivators in charge and were considered the leaders of the cultivation world in Huaxia.

However, the five great sects were also struggling to hold on, and the environment was deteriorating day by day. The living conditions of the other small sects were even worse.

It could be said that the entire cultivation world was currently living a hard life.

Other than news about the cultivation world, Xia ruofei also asked about combat skills.

Liu chengfeng didn’t hold anything back either. He told Xia ruofei everything, be it the sect’s Secret or the battle technique he had obtained by chance.

This opened a new door for Xia ruofei.

It turned out that in addition to mental power being able to be amplified through a specific combination, there was also a similar method for true Qi. Mental power and true Qi could even be used together. Many long – range attack unique skills involved the problem of the combination of mental power and true Qi.

Of course, when Xia ruofei had asked about the overall strength of the cultivation world, Liu chengfeng had not only explained the current situation of the sects in detail, but also told him that there were many Senior Masters who had hidden from the world. The strength of these people was unknown, but there were definitely some who were stronger than the Golden core Masters of the five major sects.

This idea was deeply rooted in Liu chengfeng’s mind, especially after the battle with Xia ruofei’s spiritual power. Therefore, even under hypnosis, Liu chengfeng still insisted on this idea.

After Xia ruofei finished asking, he withdrew his spiritual power.

Just as Liu chengfeng woke up and heaved a sigh of relief, he immediately felt a wave of majestic spiritual energy pressing down on him.

Liu chengfeng was dejected. He thought that he was of no value to Xia ruofei, and now the other party was ready to kill him.

However, he didn’t feel death approaching. Instead, he felt the world spinning ...
