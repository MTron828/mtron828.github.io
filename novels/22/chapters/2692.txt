Xia ruofei keyed in the number that he had memorized and dialed it without hesitation.

He was calling Wang Boshan. This was also part of his plan. Wang Boshan had been ignored for several days. If they continued to delay, they would only become more and more impatient and gradually lose their patience. They could not rule out the possibility of taking some extreme measures. Once things developed to that extent, it might bring changes to the plan.

Hence, Xia ruofei did not delay it indefinitely. After adjusting his condition, he gave Wang Boshan a call.

Xia ruofei heard the phone ring three times before the other party picked up.””Hey! Who is it?”

“May I ask if you are President Wang from stars Corporation?” Xia ruofei asked calmly.

“I am, Who are you?”

Although Wang Boshan’s tone was still calm, Xia ruofei could still detect a trace of impatience. It was probably because they had not been able to find Xia ruofei’s whereabouts for the past few days and they had started to become anxious.

Xia ruofei replied indifferently,”I’m Xia ruofei.” I heard that CEO Wang has been looking for me these few days? And you said you have a business deal worth billions of dollars to discuss with me?”

On the other end of the phone, Wang Boshan was silent for a while. He didn’t expect that Xia ruofei, who he had been looking for for so many days and couldn’t even see once, would call him without any warning.

Immediately after, Wang Boshan’s heart was filled with surprise. He could not help but raise his voice a few degrees,””President Xia! You finally called me back! I’ve been looking for you for many days!”

Perhaps he felt that there was something wrong with his tone, Wang Boshan immediately said,””President Xia, I do have a big business deal to discuss with you. It’s worth billions of dollars!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”a few billion dollars?” My company’s market value is only a fraction of a few billion dollars. I’m afraid I can’t take in such a big business!”

Wang Boshan quickly said,”director Xia, I’ve also looked into your paradise Corporation. Although it’s not very big at the moment, it has great potential! It’s going to become a multinational giant soon!”

At this moment, Xia ruofei heard a voice from the other end of the phone.””Boshan, just talk to him about the main topic. Why are you talking nonsense?”

“Martial uncle Zheng, please calm down ... Please calm down ... We’re about to get to the main topic.” Wang Boshan said.

Xia ruofei immediately recognized the other person’s voice. It was the voice of senior uncle Zheng, who he had heard on Peach Blossom Island yesterday.

In fact, when “martial uncle Zheng” just said a few words, the voice from the phone receiver suddenly became much softer. It should be Wang Boshan who covered the receiver in time.

However, Xia ruofei was a cultivator. Even though the voice was very low, he could still hear it clearly. He could also hear the last sentence that Wang Boshan said.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile. It seemed that senior uncle Zheng was an impatient person.

It’s good to be impatient! That way, it would be easier for me to carry out my plan. Xia ruofei said in his heart.

Then, Xia ruofei heard Wang Boshan continue,””President Xia, I believe you should know about my situation. Stars Corporation is not weak, and I’m definitely not the kind of person who would swindle people. Also, the business I’m looking for you to discuss has nothing to do with the Paradise Corporation. ” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Of course I know the strength of stars Corporation.” Xia ruofei smiled faintly and said,”but CEO Wang said that the billions of US dollars have nothing to do with my company, so I’m really a little confused ... Among my assets, the most valuable is Tao Yuan company. Since it has nothing to do with my company, how can I have the ability to take on a business that’s worth billions of US dollars? Even if I sold this hundred Jin of mine, it wouldn’t be worth that much money!”

“President Xia, you must be joking ...” Wang Boshan laughed dryly and said,”President Xia, this matter can’t be explained clearly in a few words over the phone. I hope to talk to you in person. I wonder if it’s convenient for you to arrange it?”

Xia ruofei pretended to think for a while before saying,””We can meet ... But I still have some things to deal with, so I’m afraid I won’t have time tomorrow ... Is it convenient for President Wang to meet the day after tomorrow?”

Even if the second batch of people recruited by Li Yifu arrived in time, it would still take almost three days to complete the transformation project on the Peach Blossom Island. Because of this, Xia ruofei had pushed back the meeting time by one day to buy time for Li Yifu on Peach Blossom Island.

Naturally, Wang Boshan couldn’t wait to meet Xia ruofei immediately to discuss the conditions for the purchase of Peach Blossom Island. Hence, when he heard Xia ruofei say that he had to wait for another day, he couldn’t help but hesitate. However, he quickly said,””No problem! Then let’s set it at noon the day after tomorrow! Let’s talk while we eat, I’ll decide the place!”

Xia ruofei said,”in the capital, President Wang is a guest and I’m the host. How can I let you arrange it?” I’ll do it! I’ll let you know by text when the place is set at noon tomorrow. ”

Xia ruofei didn’t let Wang Boshan arrange the meeting to prevent the other party from making some arrangements at the meeting place in advance. After all, the opponent was a disciple of a cultivation sect. Sometimes, it was impossible to guard against the means of cultivators.
