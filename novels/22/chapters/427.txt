Chapter 428: Trouble at the door (3)

The female police officer’s vision blurred, and then the police badge in her hand disappeared. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

She took a closer look and saw Xia ruofei smiling as he held the police ID. He said as he looked at it,””Don’t be nervous, I just want to see it clearly ...”

The female police officer and her two colleagues looked at each other, and all three of them showed a hint of vigilance.

Xia ruofei’s movements were too fast. It was so fast that the three of them did not see it clearly.

Especially the female police officer. She didn’t even have time to react before her police badge was already in Xia ruofei’s hands.

What if it wasn’t a police ID, but a gun?

This person was extremely dangerous! A thought came to the policewoman’s mind. She took two steps back without a sound and raised her hand slightly, slowly reaching for the holster at her waist.

Xia ruofei seemed to be very interested in the police ID. After looking at it for a long time, he said with a smile,””Qin Xiao Yu, good name! It’s just that using such a demure name on you seems a little ... Tsk tsk, you’re already a vice – Captain at such a young age, amazing!”

The police ID showed that the policewoman named Qin Xiao Yu was the Deputy Captain of the first criminal investigation team of the city Public Security Bureau’s Criminal Police detachment. She was only twenty – five years old this year.

Qin Xiao Yu’s expression was very ugly, she snorted coldly and asked: “”Have you seen enough?”

Xia ruofei pouted and threw the ID to Qin Xiaoyu, saying,””Isn’t it just an id? I don’t think you’ll lose anything later! Hmm, this id looks real ...”

Qin Xiao Yu caught the police badge and when she heard Xia ruofei’s words, her lungs were about to explode. She shouted,””What do you mean it looks real? We are the police!”

Xia ruofei shrugged noncommittally and said,””Alright, I’ve seen the documents. Officer Qin, if you have any questions, ask!”

Qin Xiao Yu glared at Xia ruofei and took a deep breath to calm herself down. She then asked in a business – like tone,””Mr. Xia ruofei, may I know where you will be on the 18th of April from 8 to 8:30 p.m.? What do you want me to do?”

“On the 18th, I was at the farm ...” Xia ruofei answered without thinking.

“You’re lying!” Qin Xiao Yu immediately interrupted Xia ruofei’s words,”many surveillance cameras in the city have captured you driving this overbearing off – Road vehicle and running several red lights in a row. Finally, you went to the direction of the zero degree dream bar by the North River.”

Qin Xiao Yu stared into Xia ruofei’s eyes when she was talking, especially when she was talking about the zero degree dream bar. She stared at Xia ruofei closely but she did not see any change in his expression.

Xia ruofei furrowed his brows and said,”am I done?” Officer Qin, do you know that it’s very impolite of you to interrupt someone like this?”

Qin Xiao Yu’s face revealed a cold smile and said,””Didn’t you just say you were on the farm?”

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”I said that I was at the farm the entire day. I went out to pick up a friend at night. I can’t remember the exact time. I don’t know if it was the time you mentioned.”

Qin Xiao Yu cursed in her heart, cunning!

During the whole process, the other two police officers did not speak. This case should be directed by Qin Xiao Yu. Although the two male police officers were older than Qin Xiao Yu, they were likely to be her subordinates.

In fact, Qin Xiao Yu and the others did not have any substantial evidence. After receiving the report that night, they found out that all the surveillance data had been taken away. The gangsters who were beaten up could not give a reason, and Fang Luo and brother Hu were still in a coma.

However, Qin Xiao Yu had retrieved the information from the surveillance cameras at the intersection and immediately noticed that there was something wrong with Xia ruofei’s off – Road vehicle. It was rushing towards the direction of zero degree dream like a madman.

So, she brought two subordinates to investigate. As soon as she entered the courtyard, she saw the off – Road vehicle.

Qin Xiao Yu was about to continue asking when her phone rang.

She glared at Xia ruofei and took out her phone.””Hello? I’m Qin Xiao Yu ... Right? That’s great ... I’ll ask for a reward for you later!”

After Qin Xiao Yu hung up the phone, she looked at Xia ruofei with an unfriendly gaze ...
