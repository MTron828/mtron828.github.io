2506 Bold and ambitious words (1)

In fact, for Zhou leiyun, although investing in the Espanyol club was just for fun, he also had the intention of increasing his influence and popularity. Therefore, he did not fully acquire the entire club. Instead, he held the shares that had just reached the holding line and did not increase his shares.

Zhou leiyun naturally did not care about the little profit from running a Football Club, not to mention that many football clubs were operating at a loss.

When he invested in the club, the most important thing was still the brand effect.

In fact, the introduction of Wu Lei this time could be said to be of good quality and cheap, with a high price – Performance ratio. After the news of Wu Lei joining Espanyol was announced to the public, even glory World group’s stock price rose a little. In the future, if Wu Lei could play in the game or continue to score in La Liga, the brand effect would be even more obvious.

It was also because of this that Zhou leiyun’s philosophy in running the club was to maintain the status quo. He had no strong desire to invest large amounts of money. As long as the club could stay in La Liga, coupled with Wu Lei’s advertising effect, he would have already made a lot of money and did not need to invest without restraint.

Although Zhou leiyun was not short of money, a businessman’s calculations were always the best. He would not spend a single cent that he did not need to spend.

Therefore, when Xia ruofei announced that he hoped the team would work hard to get into the European zone, and even promised to give a huge bonus, as well as a large investment to bring in strong players next season, Zhou leiyun was a little surprised.

However, Zhou leiyun was very clear about what was more important. Since Xia ruofei had already said it, he naturally would not jump out and undermine her.

Moreover, for the Spanish team, investing tens of millions of euros to recruit was already a big deal. As long as Xia ruofei was happy, he did not mind investing another tens of millions of euros into the club.

This way, he could also get the other shareholders to invest as well. If the other shareholders were not willing to invest, Zhou leiyun would be happy to see their shares be diluted and his own share ratio increase a little.

...

Hence, the strange look on Zhou leiyun’s face only lasted for a moment. He quickly put on a kind smile and nodded his head lightly, making others feel that he had already reached an agreement with Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei’s words fell into the head coach Ruby’s ears. He could not help but smile bitterly.

As the team’s manager, Ruby knew the situation of his team the best. Xia ruofei was right that the Espanyol club was only 12 points away from the European zone, which seemed to be a difference of four games. With more than ten rounds left in the league, it was completely possible to catch up. However, the actual situation was that the gap between the last ten teams in the league was very small. If they were not careful, they could even fall into the relegation zone.

Therefore, Ruby had always believed that staying in the league was the most important thing. In the next few rounds of the league tournament, when they encountered opponents who could theoretically stay in the league, they must fight to the death. As for the traditional strong teams such as bar?a, Atletico Madrid, and sevilya, it would be best to get points, but not getting any points was expected. There was no need to fight hard.

After all, fighting head – on with the opponent might get more red and yellow cards, and even an increase in injuries, which would affect the number of games that should really get points.

Goose ... Alright ... Barca should be excluded.

Even though bar?a was a strong team in the universe, the Spaniards did not have to give up when facing them. They had to fight to the death.

It was because they were mortal enemies from the same city. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Ruby couldn’t help but say,””Mr. Xia, I think ... The team’s goal should still be to play steadily and prioritize staying in the league ...”

The smile on Xia ruofei’s face didn’t fade. He didn’t feel that the other party had offended him. He smiled and said,”Mr. Ruby, whether it’s to avoid relegation or to fight in Europe, the team has to get as many points as possible. I don’t think the two are contradictory, do they?”

“Of course! However ... In some competitions where the gap in strength is too big, it’s not worth it to fight hard. ” Ruby said.

...

This could only be said internally. It could not be admitted to cowardice in front of outsiders. Even in front of the players, it could not be said clearly.

Xia ruofei smiled.”I used to be a soldier. The word ‘give up’ doesn’t exist in my dictionary. In my opinion, we must give it our all in any competition.”

Then, Xia ruofei changed the topic and said,””Of course, I’m just setting a big goal. I don’t want to interfere with the coach’s arrangement. Everything will go according to your established arrangement.”

Xia ruofei did not expect the manager to be so stubborn. He insisted on his point of view even in front of the club’s major shareholders.

He thought to himself,”it seems that Wu Lei can’t get any preferential treatment with his Chinese identity. If he wants to get stable playing time, he still has to show his strength in training!”

Of course, Xia ruofei would not interfere with all this as long as the manager did not discriminate against them. It was fair to rely on one’s ability to make a living.

Moreover, if he really wanted to help Wu Lei, he had a way to improve Wu Lei’s strength.

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Ruby replied in a neutral tone,””Thank you for your support, Mr. Xia. We’ll definitely work hard!”

After the short meeting, Xia ruofei visited Dani Halk training base with Zhou leiyun and the others. He even saw Wu Lei in the training room, who was doing strength training with his teammates under the guidance of the physical coach.
