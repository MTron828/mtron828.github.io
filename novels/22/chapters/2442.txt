2443 A heaven – defying inheritance (2)

Xia ruofei had considered all these. Hence, he kept a container with the petals of the spirit Heart Flower and a large bowl of spatial spirit pool water in case of an emergency.

The actual situation was better than what Xia ruofei had worried about.

Although the entire process of the inheritance was extremely painful, and his head was in so much pain that it felt like it was going to explode, he did not suffer any substantial damage until the last piece of inheritance information entered his mind.

After the inheritance, Xia ruofei finally heaved a long sigh of relief.

Although the inheritance had not been long, Xia ruofei felt as if he had been suffering for a hundred years.

Fortunately, the process was finally over. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

No matter what the inheritance information in the heaven jade talisman was, to Xia ruofei, at least this adventure had been a success.

He wiped the sweat from his forehead and rubbed his throbbing temples. At the same time, he couldn’t wait to retrieve the information of the inheritance from his mind. He wanted to see what good things the heaven jade talisman had left for him.

After a round of investigation, Xia ruofei’s face revealed a surprised and happy expression. He couldn’t help but clench his fist and shouted,””Yay!”

The heaven jade talisman’s information was not as complex as the human jade talisman, nor did it provide a complete array Dao inheritance like the earth jade talisman. However, to Xia ruofei, the inheritance information in the heaven jade talisman was very useful.

First, it was the seventh to ninth layers of the great Dao Arts. This was within his expectations. Xia ruofei was not particularly surprised. Moreover, he didn’t need such a high – Level cultivation technique at the moment. In fact, he had only cultivated the first layer of the “great Dao Arts” when he was at the Qi condensation stage.

In addition to the seventh to ninth levels of the great Dao technique, there were three complete inheritances in the heaven jade talisman.

“Floating steps,” this was a top class movement technique. After training it to the major completion, not only could one’s speed increase by ten times, but one’s body would also be like a ghost. Whether it was dodging or escaping, this movement technique manual was the best choice.

Even if it wasn’t for the sake of escaping, in a battle between cultivators, the side with a stronger movement technique had an obvious advantage. They could easily Dodge the other party’s attacks and also use their movement technique to quickly approach the enemy. If they were coupled with close combat techniques, the power would be greatly increased.

The ‘Noble Sword’ was one of the top sword techniques that practitioners used. This was completely different from Yue Buqun’s “Noble Sword” created by Mister Jin Yong. This set of sword technique was divided into Four Realms of plum, orchid, bamboo, and chrysanthemum. This was not an incremental relationship, but each realm was relatively independent. After mastering it, one could fully reflect the intent of each of the four noble men. Moreover, the Four Realms could be switched at any time. According to the description in the cultivation method, this set of sword technique could even merge the Four Realms and cultivate a brand new “noble man realm.” Its power would be even more shocking.

The [Noble Sword] also didn’t use ordinary swords. Instead, it used the flying swords of its practitioners. Just like Xia ruofei’s Blue travel immortal sword, most cultivators ‘flying swords did not have a hilt. Every part of the sword body was rather sharp. Naturally, such a sword could not be controlled by hand. It completely relied on spiritual power. Even though Xia ruofei had already reached the spirit gathering realm, he was still far from being able to use this sword technique well.

What was rare and valuable was that both the “drifting steps” and the “Noble Sword” were movement techniques and battle skills that were compatible with the “great Dao Arts.” When combined with the “great Dao Arts” special circulation path, the power that was unleashed was even greater.

Xia ruofei was still not good at his swordsmanship as his spiritual power was still lacking. However, the appearance of his body movement technique was like charcoal in the snow. He could use the Jade pillar array to train his sashimi and improve his body movement technique.

No matter when, it was very important to practice the ability to save one’s life.

Xia ruofei was full of motivation.

At the same time, he also secretly regretted that he had used up all three times of the Linglong tower’s Jade pillar array. Moreover, he did not practice any movement techniques at that time, so the effect of the Jade pillar array could only be said to be unsatisfactory.

Now that he had the movement technique manual, he had to wait another seven days before he could have a second chance to challenge it. He regretted it.

Of course, what made Xia ruofei the happiest was the last set of cultivation techniques.

To be more precise, this was just a spiritual force secret technique.

Actually, Xia ruofei had mastered quite a few secret techniques of spiritual power. For example, his tried – and – tested spiritual hypnosis was actually one of the secret techniques of spiritual power. There were also other small techniques of using spiritual power. There were many of them in the inheritance information of the human – shaped jade talisman.

However, this time, the spiritual power secret skill called “soul seal” was taken out by itself. Together with “drifting steps” and “gentleman’s sword”, it was sealed in the “heaven” jade talisman. It was enough to show that this set of spiritual power secret skills was different from the others.

As the name suggested, after successfully cultivating “soul seal,” the practitioner could form a soul seal in his sea of consciousness.

The soul seal itself did not have any benefits to the sea of consciousness, nor could it improve the cultivation of spiritual power. However, after Xia ruofei read the introduction of “soul seal”, he was overjoyed.

The soul seal was actually a combination of mother and child. The mother seal was naturally in the cultivator’s sea of consciousness, while the child seal could be imprinted in other people’s sea of consciousness. Through this set of mother and child soul seals, the cultivator could completely control the other party.

The so – called complete control meant that no matter if it was an ordinary person or a cultivator, after being branded with the child seal of the soul seal in the sea of consciousness, they would absolutely submit to the cultivator who had the matching mother seal. This was a kind of submission that came from the depths of the soul, rather than being forced to submit under the suppression of absolute strength.

Of course, if one really wanted to brand a soul seal in the other party’s sea of consciousness, it would also be an absolute suppression of strength. Because as long as the practitioner of the soul seal thought about it, the other party’s sea of consciousness would instantly explode. Naturally, that person would also die.

In reality, they were soul slaves.

What was even more heaven – defying was that, according to the description of this secret skill, even a Yuanying stage cultivator would find it difficult to find the soul seal in another person’s sea of consciousness. Even if they were lucky enough to find it, it would be extremely difficult to break or even destroy the soul seal. If they were not careful, they would touch the soul seal and the final outcome would still be the destruction of their soul.

Even a nascent Soul Stage cultivator would find it difficult to break through, so the power of the soul seal could be seen.

The “minimum configuration requirement” for the cultivation of soul seal was that one’s spiritual power had reached the spirit gathering realm.

In fact, this kind of secret skill was closely related to the soul and the sea of consciousness, and the cultivation threshold was often the cultivation of spiritual power.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but secretly rejoice. If this secret skill required the cultivation of true Qi, he probably wouldn’t be able to meet the cultivation requirements at his current stage.

When a spirit gathering realm cultivator practiced the soul seal to completion, he could form a mother seal and five child seals.

In other words, once Xia ruofei mastered this secret skill, he could control five soul slaves.

It didn’t seem like a lot, but considering how thorough and domineering the control was, if he used all of them, it would be equivalent to having five more servants that he could absolutely trust and would never betray him. This was simply too heaven – defying.

This sort of absolute control over the soul was extremely terrifying. Even if his master ordered him to immediately cut off his head, he would not hesitate to carry it out.

When Xia ruofei examined the secret soul skill in the heaven jade talisman, the first person that appeared in his mind was Liu chengfeng, who could only be imprisoned in the spatial cage of the mountain and sea realm.

If he could plant a soul seal on Liu chengfeng, it would be equivalent to planting a sharp nail in the falling leaves sect. This would be extremely useful for Xia ruofei’s future dealings with the falling leaves sect and even the entire cultivation world!

Although Liu chengfeng’s Qi Level 7 cultivation was a little low in Xia ruofei’s eyes, he was the most suitable candidate for the position.

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei couldn’t wait to start cultivating. As long as he could successfully cultivate and form the first child seal, he would be able to completely control Liu chengfeng.
