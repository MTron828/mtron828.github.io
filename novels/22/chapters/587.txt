Chapter 588: Contract achieved (3)

Feng Rao blushed and rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei.”Is that how you talk about your subordinates?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. After a while, he asked seriously,””What do you think of tomorrow’s negotiations?”

“Actually, both sides are heading towards the same direction,” Feng Jing analyzed calmly.”But I think the conditions I’ve proposed have already crossed boss Lin’s bottom line. So, tomorrow’s negotiations won’t be easy.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”if you really can’t do it, just give way.”

“I think 180000 is a very suitable price!” Feng Rao raised a different opinion.”Once Tongren Hall is resold, we can make at least 20000 Yuan per kilogram of goods ...”

Xia ruofei laughed.”Look at you. You’re such a money – grubber. I didn’t say I’ll give in on the price!”

“Chairman, are you talking about the supply?” Feng Jing furrowed her brows.”I remember you telling me yesterday that if the supply is too large, we might not be able to keep up with the supply of raw materials. There’s definitely a penalty clause in our contract, and that’s too disadvantageous for us.”

Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s not a big problem to control the supply to one ton. Also, if Tongren Hall is still not satisfied, we can make another step back.”

“How?” Feng Rao asked in confusion.

“All of our products are uniformly packaged. Even if there’s a surplus after we supply it to Tongren Tang, our company can sell it to other companies or resell it to other companies. We can maintain the same pricing as Tongren Tang. Xia ruofei said.

Feng Rao’s eyes lit up as she immediately understood what Xia ruofei meant. “You’re saying to include the prohibition of malicious competition in the contract?”

“This is what I meant!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I believe that with this, CEO Lin will be able to accept the price. Of course, this is also our bottom line. It’s naturally the best if we can negotiate with your conditions today. ”

“Understood!” Feng Rao said confidently.

......

At this time, the two of them had unknowingly walked to the fish pond on the farm. Feng Jing saw the fish pond and couldn’t help but ask,””Chairman, I heard that the fish pond has been idle since the opening of the farm. I think it’s too wasteful. Should we consider adding a breeding project?”

If it was a few days ago, this question would have given Xia ruofei a headache as well. However, today, he was no longer worried. He immediately smiled and said,””I’ve already found a project, but I still need some time. ”

“Oh? What project?” Feng Rao couldn’t help but ask.

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”I’ll keep you in suspense for now. You’ll know in a few days.” In any case, our Taoyuan farm only produces quality products. I can’t be bothered with the average project!”

“Alright! Chairman, it’s fine as long as you know what you’re doing. ” Feng Jing smiled.”I’ve been busy recently too.”

It was getting late. The two of them talked about some company matters and then turned around to leave. Xia ruofei sent Feng Jing to the complex before returning to the small villa.

……

The negotiations continued the next day.

With Xia ruofei’s approval, Feng Jing was even more confident. Other than increasing the supply to one ton, she would not compromise on any other conditions.

Mr. Lin had made some concessions and raised the purchase price to 170000 Yuan per kilogram. This seemed to be his bottom line, and the negotiations were in a temporary deadlock.

At this moment, Feng Jing felt that the time was right. She released the clause that prohibited malicious competition that Xia ruofei had mentioned last night and clearly stated that this was the bottom line of paradise Corporation. If they still couldn’t reach an agreement, this cooperation would regretfully be called off.

CEO Lin also realized that Feng Jing wasn’t bluffing. After weighing the pros and cons for a long time, he went out to call the head of the main store for further instructions. Then, he returned to the meeting room with a bitter smile and agreed to Feng Jing’s conditions.

After the general principles were agreed, some details such as the supply method, time, settlement method, and so on were easy to discuss.

In the evening, the two sides finally reached an agreement on all the issues and drafted the first draft of the contract.

After Xia ruofei finished reading and found no problem with it, he signed the contract without hesitation. CEO Lin was the representative of Tongren Hall this time, so the contract would come into effect after he signed and stamped his seal.

Xia ruofei smiled and shook Mr. Lin’s hand.”Brother Lin, it’s a pleasure working with you!”

“Our profits are almost squeezed dry,” President Lin said with a bitter face.”How can we be happy?”

Xia ruofei laughed,”big brother Lin, don’t complain about being poor!” Your Tongren Hall is not only interested in that little bit of profit!”

President Lin smiled but did not answer. Xia ruofei leaned close to President Lin’s ear and whispered,””Big brother Lin, business is business, don’t blame this little brother for being unkind ... Don’t be depressed, how about this! I’ll think of a way to get two more wild ginsengs in a while, and the quality won’t be lower than the previous ones. How about it?”

“Brother Xia, really?” President Lin suddenly became energetic again.

Compared to the iron – hide fengdou, high – Quality wild ginseng was even more difficult to come by. Moreover, it had a more obvious effect on promoting the reputation of Tongren Hall.

Xia ruofei laughed.”I have some clues. Once I have any news, I will inform brother Lin immediately!”

“Alright, alright, alright. Then, brother Xia, you have to be more careful!” President Lin quickly said.

“Don’t worry! I don’t dare to slack off on big brother Lin’s matter!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”let’s go, you guys must be tired after talking for a whole day. Let’s go have a drink!” It’s not easy to come to the three mountains, so don’t rush back. I’ll get Lei Hu to drive you around tomorrow. ”

“Don ‘t, don’ t, don ‘t, I still have a lot of things to do in my shop! I’ve booked a ticket for tomorrow morning!” President Lin quickly said.

He had long been anxious to return home. Although the results were not as good as he had expected, the task was completed. He had to report to the main store as soon as he returned!

“That’s fine. I was in too much of a hurry this time. Next time, I’ll find some time to come over and have some fun!” Xia ruofei did not force her.

“Definitely, definitely!” President Lin said.

Everyone chatted as they walked towards the dining room. Naturally, there would be another fierce battle at the table tonight.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
