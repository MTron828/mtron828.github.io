  After the car stopped, everyone saw Xia ruofei, who was holding a lunchbox, get out of the car with a smile.

  All the fans were stunned.

  They had never thought that Xia ruofei would come out to meet them personally.

  When many celebrities walked on the streets and met their fans asking for autographs or photos, they would look impatient, which was very different from the kind and gentle image they had in front of the camera.

  Although Xia ruofei's fans all believed that CEO Xia was not that kind of person, they did not expect Xia ruofei to be so approachable that he even came out to meet his fans.

  Therefore, everyone was stunned for a moment.

  A few seconds later, the fans started screaming excitedly. The sound was so loud that even the security guards at the entrance of the park across the road heard it and came out to check on the situation.

  Although Xia ruofei's fans were relatively more rational, it depended on the situation. When a living idol appeared in front of them, very few people could maintain their basic rationality.

  When Deputy Director Wei saw these excited fans, he suddenly thought of something. He did not see Wei Xue in the crowd, which meant that his daughter was very obedient. Even if she really wanted to come, she still stayed at home. Now, here came the problem ...

  When these fans saw Xia ruofei, they would definitely spread the news in various fan groups and forums. These were also places that Wei Xue visited every day. It was not an exaggeration to say that it was her spiritual home.

  This meant that Wei Xue would soon find out that Xia ruofei had personally come out to meet his fans.

  Because of his father's request, he missed the close contact with his idol ... Deputy Director Wei couldn't help but smile bitterly when he thought of this.

  Although Xia ruofei's personally signed gift was also very meaningful, wouldn't it be more meaningful for Wei Xue to meet her idol? Deputy Chief Wei did not know.

  However, he knew that no matter what, Wei Xue would definitely not give him any face after this ...

  Deputy Director Wei hesitated for a few seconds before he made a decision.

  He walked to the side and called home.

  The bored Wei Xue was sitting on the sofa and watching a drama! After the phone rang, she didn't even need to move and picked it up.

  "Hello?"

  "Xiaoxue, it's me!" Said Deputy Director Wei.

  Wei Xue immediately pouted and said,"dad!" You still don't trust me! You're calling to check up on us so quickly ..."

  Wei Xue also had a cell phone, but Deputy Director Wei called the house phone. She naturally felt that her father was checking if she was obediently staying at home.

  Deputy Director Wei was too lazy to explain because time was tight. He said directly,""Little Xue, come to the entrance of the park, now!" He said.

  Wei Xue was stunned and asked,"what's wrong?" Didn't you forbid me from going?"

  "I told you to come over immediately, take a taxi!" Deputy Director Wei did not mention that Xia ruofei was there. Instead, he said,"be there in ten minutes!" If you can't make it in time and miss something, don't blame me for not informing you!"

  Wei Xue's eyes brightened and she quickly asked,"Did President Xia ..."

  On the other end, Deputy Director Wei had already hung up.

  Wei Xue jumped up from the sofa. First, she asked a few questions in the local fan group, but she did not get an answer. Those who had gone to the venue were now all surrounding Xia ruofei. How could they have the time to read the group messages? Those who didn't go naturally didn't know anything.

  However, Deputy Director Wei's words were very obvious. Even if Xia ruofei did not appear, Wei Xue was willing to go to the entrance of the park. At least it was closer to Xia ruofei.

  So, she grabbed her bag from the coffee table and rushed to the door.

  However, she immediately slammed on the brakes and rushed into the bedroom. She picked out a set of clothes in the shortest time possible and changed into it. It was her favorite loose white T - Shirt, paired with cropped jeans, rainbow - colored canvas shoes, and a rice - colored fisherman's hat. She looked youthful and lively with a hint of playfulness.

  Wei Xue tidied up her clothes in front of the mirror at the door, then rushed out of the house with her slanted bag. She stopped a taxi downstairs and rushed to the high - tech Park where the Supercomputing Center was located.

  At the same time, Xia ruofei was having a good chat with his fans. Deputy Director Wei secretly hoped that Xia ruofei could interact with his fans for a while longer so that his daughter could make it here in time!

  It was rare for Deputy Director Wei to spare no effort for his daughter's idol.

  Of course, it was also because his daughter's idol was Xia ruofei. If it was some sissy boy, he would never do this.

  The fans took out Xia ruofei's photos and all kinds of cards, asking for his signature. Xia ruofei did not reject any of them.

  There were only about ten to twenty fans here, so it wasn't difficult to sign all of them.

  Xia ruofei signed his name and chatted with his fans. He even asked them to introduce themselves.

  "President Xia, my name is Ren Xiaoye. I'm studying at Xin Wu second high school and I'm in my second year of high school this year!"

  "Director Xia, director Xia, I'm Liu Manman! I'm from No. 3 high school, and I'm in my first year of high school this year!"

  "It's my turn! President Xia, I'm in the third year of middle school this year!" An even smaller loli squeezed in and said,"my name is he Miao! I really like you!"

  ……

  As Xia ruofei listened, he could not help but smile bitterly.

  Most of his fans were female, and most of them were middle school students.

  Xia ruofei mumbled in his heart,"shouldn't you guys at your age be admiring han and han, or infatuated with some sissy young hunks?" Why would she like me?

  At this time, he saw a relatively steady figure from the corner of his eye. Judging from his age, he was definitely not a middle school student. Most importantly, he was a man.

  Hence, Xia ruofei looked at him and asked with a smile,""How about you? You can't be a middle school student, right?" Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

  The girls all laughed.

  The young man was about 26 or 27 years old, with short hair and looked quite energetic.

  He was a little shy at first and didn't want to squeeze into the circle. He didn't expect Xia ruofei to take the initiative to ask him. He was a little confused.

  After calming himself down, the young man said excitedly,""President Xia, my name is Wu Peng! It was the new pilot of the new Wu airlines this year! I've seen the relevant information about you driving the qinqiu flight to Saipan to force the surrender. During the induction training, the instructor even specially organized an analysis of this case! I really admire you!"

  Xia ruofei could not help but be stunned. So this person was a real pilot! Even in small airline companies, the pilots might be flying helicopters or small propeller planes, but they were regular pilots with commercial licenses!

  Xia ruofei felt a sense of accomplishment to be praised and even worshipped by the pilot.

  Wu Peng was obviously very familiar with these fans. Everyone knew his identity, so they were not   "Good, good, good! "No problem ..." Deputy Director Wei quickly said.

  Wu Peng's phone was a newly bought Huawei flagship phone, so it was better at taking photos. surprised.

  "Luck played a huge part in the success of the forced surrender," Xia ruofei said humbly."Besides, I'm not a professional pilot ..."

  "We saw the control data during the forced descent before the ground was touched!" Wu Peng said,"our instructor said that even experienced professional pilots would find it difficult to do this. He said ... Your operation was very good!"

  "All hail President Xia!"

  "President Xia is awesome!"

  The girls did not understand what the pilot was talking about but they knew that Wu Peng was praising Xia ruofei in a different way so they all cheered.

  Xia ruofei pressed his hands down and waited for everyone to quieten down before he said,""Thank you very much for everyone's love! I can feel the enthusiasm of the people of new Wu!"

  Xia ruofei's words caused everyone to burst into laughter.

  He continued,"especially that lunchbox filled with love, I finished it all!" Thank you very much, everyone!"

  Hearing that Xia ruofei had finished the entire lunchbox, the cheers from the fans were even louder.

  Xia ruofei finally said,"let's take a photo together!" Director Wei, can you please help us take a picture?"

  "Good, good, good! "No problem ..." Deputy Director Wei quickly said.

  Wu Peng's phone was a newly bought Huawei flagship phone, so it was better at taking photos. After some discussion, they handed Wu Peng's phone to Deputy Director Wei and repeatedly asked him to take better and more photos.

  The fans quickly lined up in two rows, with Xia ruofei naturally in the middle.

  At this moment, a voice was heard,""Wait for me! Wait for me!"

  Deputy Director Wei turned around and saw his daughter, Wei Xue, who had just gotten out of a taxi, running towards him. Then, a gust of wind swept past him and in the blink of an eye, she was running towards Xia ruofei.

  Deputy Director Wei was flustered. I've been ignored by my daughter ...
