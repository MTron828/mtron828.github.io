Zhao Yong Jun did not know why Zhou leiyun wanted to meet Xia ruofei, so he looked at Zhou leiyun.

“It’s nothing much, actually,”said Zhou leiyun with a smile. Yongjun, I bought a Football Club two years ago to play with. You know about this, right?”

“I have some impression of it,” Zhao Yongjun said after some thought.”Is it ... A club from Spain?”

Zhou leiyun chuckled and said,”I can tell that you don’t usually care about football.” It was indeed a Spain football Club, but it was not an ordinary club. It was a La Liga club, one of the five major leagues in the world! Does Messi know? The Barcelona team he’s in is a La Liga team!”

“Of course, I know about Messi!” Zhao Yongjun said,”he’s the world’s number one in football!”

Messi was so famous that even people who did not watch football had heard of him.

“If you put it that Zhou leiyun laughed and said,”I’m a huge fan of C Luo!”

Zhao Yongjun smiled awkwardly and said,””Brother Zhou, I really don’t know much about football, but I do know Messi and Ronaldo ...”

Zhou leiyun nodded.”The full name of the club I bought is real Espanyol. This is the ‘Royal’ title granted by the King of Spain, so there is a crown on the team emblem!”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.””CEO Zhou, as far as I know, there are many Spain teams with the title of Real Madrid!”

Xia ruofei counted on his fingers and said,””Real Madrid, Real Betis, Real Zaragoza, Real Sociedad ...”

Zhou leiyun revealed an awkward smile and said,””It seems that you know a lot about football, President Xia! Although there were many teams in the Spain football world with the name of the royal family, it was also a great honor! And the so – called universal team, Barcelona, is not a real team!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”director Zhou, you seem to be getting into character very quickly!” As far as I know, Barcelona is the Spanish’s mortal enemy! Every time, the scene in gattelby is quite hot!”

Xia ruofei did know a lot about football. In fact, there were many soldiers in the military who liked football. When Xia ruofei was in the Army, he often played with his comrades. He was fast and had good physical fitness. His favorite position was the right wing. He often broke through along the right side and had a great time playing.

On the weekends, his teammates would also watch the game together at the team Club.

However, after his retirement, he had been busy and watched the game a lot less.

Even so, Xia ruofei’s understanding of the top league far exceeded that of a football noob like Zhao Yongjun.

He was familiar with some of the grudges of the five major leagues, such as the double red Club between Manchester United and Liverpool, the National Derby between Real Madrid and bar?a, the Merseyside derby between Liverpool and Everton, and the Catalan derby between RCD Espanyol and bar?a.

The feud between Spain and Barcelona had been going on for a long time. At the beginning of the team’s establishment, the two teams were full of various conflicts. Bar?a was established by the United Kingdom and other foreigners in the gatai region at that time. After bar?a was established, the local Spaniards in gatai also established a club, and directly used the name “Spaniards.” It could be said that they were at odds with each other.

In addition, because of the gap in strength, Barcelona had been suppressing the Spanish team for a long time. After so many years, the Spanish players and fans naturally held a grudge.

Of course, there was a more important reason. Both teams were located in Barcelona. Barcelona was world – famous, while Espanyol was not very well – known. They were all in the same city, and the honor would always belong to Barcelona. When others mentioned the city of Barcelona, they would only know about Barcelona. Many fans might know that Espanyol was also a regular in La Liga, but they did not necessarily know that this team was actually in the same city as the powerful cosmic team, Barcelona. This was intolerable in the eyes of the Spanish team.

The so – called mortal enemy of the same city was probably such a situation.

Therefore, whether it was in the Kings ‘cup or in the league tournament, whenever Spain met bar?a, there was no need to mobilize at all. Each and every one of them was full of fighting spirit. It was often because of this strong spiritual motivation that the players often played beyond their level, and occasionally they could draw or even beat bar?a.

Against Real Madrid, which was basically on the same level as Barcelona, the Spanish team had very few wins. It was not an exaggeration to say that they were the point boy.

“Of course!” Zhou leiyun replied. Although our strength on paper is not as good as the other party ‘s, so what? Just do it!”

Xia ruofei could not help but laugh when he heard that. He did not have any bias. To put it bluntly, he did not have a loyal team. He liked high – Level teams, whether it was Barcelona or Real Madrid. He also admired top star players like Messi. However, Zhou leiyun’s words were very much in line with his temper.

“Director Zhou, we’ve been talking about soccer for so long. You haven’t told me why you’re looking for me!” Xia ruofei continued.

Zhou leiyun smiled and said,”of course it has something to do with football!” I would like to ask President Xia and brave army, are you interested in investing in a Football Club? I can give up some of my shares in RCD Espanyol, and everyone can invest some money to play!”
