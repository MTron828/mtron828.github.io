Xia ruofei was a little muddled through the rest of the gathering.

The scene of Lu You confessing to him by the pool kept replaying in his mind. Lu You’s bright eyes seemed to be able to see through his heart.

Lu You never asked Xia ruofei how he felt about her, but Xia ruofei was constantly questioning his inner self.

To be fair, he would be lying to himself if he said that he had no feelings for Lu You at all.

Although it was their first meeting, he did not have a good impression of Lu You. He felt that this girl was a little unruly and willful, even unreasonable. In addition, Lu You’s mother was a Secretary of the municipal government. This made Xia ruofei feel that she had a Princess ‘temper.

However, as they got to know each other more, Xia ruofei saw a more realistic and three – dimensional Lu You. She had her own emotions and a kind heart.

Of course, one’s looks were also very important. There were very few men who would not be moved by a beautiful woman with a hot figure and a thousand charms. Moreover, Lu You had a cold personality and did not bother with men. However, she just had to look at him in a different light. The sense of accomplishment was incomparable. It would be a lie to say that she was not moved.

However, Xia ruofei already had Ling Qingxue, which was what made him most conflicted.

Perhaps every man had a beautiful dream of having one on each side, but it was only a dream, after all. It was unlikely to happen in reality. 1

Ling Qingxue was not the only one who could not accept it. Even Lu You did not care that Xia ruofei had a girlfriend and hoped that they could have a fair competition. If Xia ruofei really wanted to have her, Lu You would probably be the first one to disagree.

Of course, Xia ruofei did not dare to have such an extravagant hope now. He was just struggling with how to face Lu You. At the same time, he felt a trace of guilt towards Ling Qingxue.

Xia ruofei appeared to be a little uneasy. On the other hand, Lu You seemed to be relieved of a heavy burden. She had finally said the words that she had been keeping in her heart for a long time. She seemed to have become much more cheerful. During the gathering, she even took the initiative to look for song Rui and Zhuo Yiyi to have a few drinks. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The barbecue party by the pool was a success. Other than Xia ruofei, who was half the host, who was a little distracted, his friends had a great time.

Little Haoran’s mouth was full of oil as he ate. Duff even took out her phone to take pictures everywhere. Every corner of this Chinese courtyard house was very fresh to her.

Zhao Yongjun and Tang Yitian also had a good time.

Song Rui had been accompanying Zhuo Yiyi the entire time. However, from Xia ruofei’s point of view, this slow – witted girl probably did not see song Rui as a man at all. Instead, she saw him as her best friend.

Xia ruofei could not help but laugh when he saw song Rui’s expression.

But he couldn’t laugh. He was a mess when it came to relationships. He couldn’t cut it and it was a mess. He didn’t have the right to laugh at song Rui!

Other than occasionally glancing at Xia ruofei, Lu You spent most of her time chatting with Feng Rao. Xia ruofei intentionally avoided her so that he had no idea what they were talking about.

It wasn’t until 10 O’ clock in the evening that Zhao Yongjun proposed to end the gathering. Everyone had almost finished drinking and the food they had prepared was almost all gone.

“Ruofei, everyone’s almost done eating!” Zhao Yongjun smiled and said,”why don’t we just leave?”

Xia ruofei was a little absent – minded. After a while, he said,””Oh ... Sure! It’s getting late!”

At this moment, Wu shuheng smiled and said,”ruofei, why don’t we all stay here tonight?” And feel your new home!”

“Good, good!” Song Rui was the first to raise both hands in agreement.

He had been looking forward to such an opportunity! If Zhuo Yiyi could stay here for the night, then perhaps they could progress further ...

Xia ruofei subconsciously looked at Lu You, who was smiling but not smiling, and quickly said,””No, no, brother Wu, you don’t have that much bedding! Besides, I’ve already troubled you enough tonight. Aren’t you going back tomorrow? Rest early tonight! We won’t disturb you any longer!”

Although Xia ruofei had paid the full amount, it had not been transferred. This was still Wu shuheng’s home. He did not want to give Wu shuheng the impression that he was eager to hand over the house.

Anyway, Wu shuheng had to deal with the notarization during the day tomorrow and fly back to the United States in the evening. Why was he in a hurry to spend the night here?

Of course, Xia ruofei was well aware of the more important reason.

His mentality was the complete opposite of song Rui ‘S. He didn’t know how to face Lu You now. If everyone stayed, he would definitely feel uncomfortable.

Wu shuheng didn’t force him and said with a smile,””Alright then! But don’t forget to come over tomorrow morning to hand over the house!”

“Alright! Brother Wu, rest early. We’ll go back to the hotel first!” Xia ruofei stood up and said.

At the door, song Rui couldn’t wait to say,””Brother Zhao, lend me your car. I’ll send Yiyi home. It’s not safe for a girl to be alone at night!”

Zhao Yongjun was stunned. The three of them had only driven one car here today. If song Rui drove the car away, what would happen to the rest of them?

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but think,’does this kid really want to be alone with Zhuo Yiyi? He didn’t even ask who would send him off ...

Without waiting for Zhao Yongjun to speak, Feng Jing immediately said,”We brought a business car with us today. It’s parked at the entrance of the alley. We can go back to the hotel in one car!”
