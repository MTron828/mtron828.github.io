Chapter 1236: Chapter 753 – not enemies, not meeting (1)

Translator: 549690339

Naturally, Blake had also recognized Xia ruofei.

This scene was so familiar. It was the same gym at Hengfeng Jiahua Hotel, and there was also a Chinese young man who was running on the treadmill. The memory at the beginning of the year made Blake quite unhappy.

Although Xia ruofei had some complaints in his heart, he didn’t show it in front of Blake. He didn’t know what was going on with Jian Jia! He had to at least ask MA Xiong after he met him!

He just glanced at Blake, raised his eyebrows, and asked in standard English,”Do you want to run together?”

Blake’s face turned red and then white. He stared at Xia ruofei for a few seconds, then quietly picked up his things and left.

Xia ruofei smiled and continued to run on the treadmill.

This coincidental encounter did not cause any waves in Xia ruofei’s heart. He was secretly looking forward to Monica coming to the gym with the same thoughts as him.

In reality, Monica had been tormented by Xia ruofei for most of the night yesterday and was extremely exhausted. She had to force herself to get up this morning. After returning to her room, she immediately went back to sleep.

Xia ruofei’s body was slightly sweaty from running. He got off the treadmill and left the gym. He returned to the Presidential Suite to take a shower. It was almost Seveno’ clock. He changed into casual clothes and took the elevator to the buffet restaurant downstairs.

As soon as they entered the restaurant, Xia ruofei saw that MA Xiong and Feng Rao were already sitting by the window. MA Xiong’s sharp eyes spotted Xia ruofei at once and he immediately smiled and waved at him.

Xia ruofei quickly walked over and said,””Mr. MA, why did you come here to have breakfast with me? How bad do you think I’ll feel?”

MA Xiong laughed and said,”people sleep less when they get old!” I wake up at FiveO’ clock every day, so I can come over to have breakfast with Xia Sheng!”

Feng Rao also greeted Xia ruofei and said,””Chairman, let’s go get some food first! Hengfeng Jiahua’s breakfast buffet is quite sumptuous. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Mr. MA, President Feng, you guys can eat first!”

With that, Xia ruofei got up and went to the dining area to get a plate of exquisite pastries. Then, he took two pieces of corn, an egg, and a glass of fresh milk. He took the plate and went back.

“Xia Sheng, are you only eating this much?” “Young people should eat more!” MA Xiong said with a smile.

“That’s enough,” Xia ruofei smiled.”You don’t need to eat too much for breakfast.”

The three of them chatted as they ate. MA Xiong suddenly said,”Xia Sheng, there’s something I ... Don’t know how to tell you ...”

Seeing MA Xiong’s troubled look, Blake’s figure suddenly appeared in Xia ruofei’s mind.

“Mr. MA, if you have anything to say, just say it,” he said with a smile.”Do we need to beat around the bush with our relationship?” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Yes, yes ...” MA Xiong said.”Xia Sheng, I’ll get straight to the point. Do you still remember the French man named Blake?”

As expected, it was related to him! Xia ruofei thought.

He didn’t pretend that he couldn’t remember, so he nodded and said,””Of course I remember him. I had a deep impression of him since I was in Shen Cheng city at the beginning of the year! Why? He’s here this time?”

Xia ruofei did not mention that he had already met Blake at the gym.

“He did come to Hong Kong, and he’s staying at Hengfeng Jiahua Hotel ...” MA Xiong forced a smile.

“But ... We definitely didn’t send an invitation to the Black’s restaurant chain!” MA Xiong said immediately.

The black group was quite influential in the world of food and beverage, and they were famous for their authentic French food. If it were any other auction house, they would definitely have attended the truffle auction.

However, MA Xiong knew that Jian Jia was at odds with Xia ruofei and Blake when they were in Shen Cheng city at the beginning of the year. MA Xiong had experienced it himself.

That was why MA Xiong specifically told the auction house not to send an invitation to the black group.

However, to MA Xiong’s dismay, Blake’s group showed up uninvited. Furthermore, it was George Blake, the young man who had a conflict with Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei smiled.”I believe that. Old Mr. MA would definitely not invite them.”

“Yeah!” MA Xiong forced a smile and said,”I just got the news this morning. The person Blake Corporation sent this time is George Blake, the one you met in Shen Cheng city last time. They paid the security deposit according to the normal procedure and bought the ordinary seats. You know that we are holding an auction, so we definitely won’t drive our guests out ...”

Although Blake’s position in his family group was not particularly high, and his ranking among the heirs was also very low, he was supposed to be a guest at the auction with his status, and he must have been invited by the organizer.

MA Xiong did not expect him to come uninvited. He did not even contact the auction house. Instead, he paid the deposit through the normal procedure and got an ordinary seat.

He didn’t know if the other party knew their own limits or if they wanted to keep a low profile, but MA Xiong was caught off guard by this.
