2461 Diamond card (2)

“There’s nothing inappropriate about it,” Zhao Yongjun said with a bright smile.”You’re a major shareholder of the club. Isn’t it only natural for you to take card number one?”

“Aren’t our shares the same?” Xia ruofei muttered.

“But you’re still a major shareholder!” Zhao Yongjun said,”I took the number 2 card too, just take it!” It was actually just a card! If we come to the club to play, isn’t it the same whether we have a card or not? That’s what I mean!”

Song Rui also said,”ruofei, just accept it!” We’ve already discussed this. Everyone will get one. ”

In fact, even if no one said anything, Xia ruofei was already the soul of the team. No one had any objections to giving him card number 1. Even someone like Zhao Yongjun was willing to take card number 2.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said with a smile,””Alright! Then I’ll accept it!”

Zhao Yongjun laughed and said,”that’s right!” There is no money in this card. You can just put it in the account and deduct it from the dividends regularly! We brothers are the same!”

Xia ruofei naturally had no objections.

This was for the best. Brothers should settle their accounts clearly. Everyone had such a good relationship. It was originally a good thing to work together to set up a club. If they ended up parting unhappily because of money, then a good thing would become a bad thing.

As a shareholder of the club, Xia ruofei might not come here often. However, Zhao Yongjun and song Rui lived in the capital and their careers had shifted to the club. They would definitely come here often. After all, whether it was inviting friends or leisure entertainment, it was quite high – end.

If the shareholders were to do it for free, then some people would spend more, while others would spend less. It would inevitably lead to some conflicts in the end. Of course, Xia ruofei didn’t care about this, but Xu Zixuan, Hou Liang, and the others weren’t very rich. It was necessary to separate the money in advance.

Zhao Yongjun then turned to Ling Qingxue and the rest,””President Ling’s card is the same as RUO Fei ‘s. Any expenses incurred on it will be directly charged.”

Ling Qingxue held the shares of the club on behalf of lingji F & B, so she was also one of the shareholders. Of course, she had to be fair.

“Alright, thank you, big brother Zhao!” Ling Qingxue said with a smile.

“You’re welcome!” Zhao Yongjun waved his hand and said,”as for Song Wei and Yiyi’s cards, there’s 200000 Yuan in them. You can spend it at the club!”

When Song Wei and Zhuo Yiyi heard this, they said in unison,””Ah? I can’t accept that!”

Then, they handed their cards to Zhao Yongjun.

Zhao Yongjun took a step back and pretended to be angry.””What’s wrong? You won’t even give this little bit of face to brother Zhao? It’s just a card. Although it’s said to be two hundred thousand, the club’s profit is very high. The cost isn’t much, so you should just take it!”

“Big brother Zhao, I really can’t accept this card!” Zhuo Yiyi hurriedly said. The Club is open for business, how can you ...”

“Yiyi,” Zhao Yongjun said.”As the older brother, I’m just giving my sister – in – Law a small gift. Why can’t I accept it?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

At this point, Zhao Yongjun seemed to realize that it wasn’t appropriate, and quickly added,””Wei Wei is also our good friend. She’s on very good terms with us and RUO Fei. Besides, the club business might not be good, and we might need your help to increase the popularity!”

Xia ruofei saw that Song Wei’s face was a little red. He thought for a moment and said,””Weiwei, since it’s brother Zhao’s kind intentions, you should accept it!”

Zhao Yongjun smiled and corrected him,”ruofei, this is what we all want. Don’t get it wrong!”

Everyone was a shareholder of the Paradise Association. In theory, the 200000 Yuan in this card was also given by everyone according to the ratio.

“Yes, yes, yes!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s a token of our appreciation. Just accept it!”

Seeing that Xia ruofei had spoken, Song Wei’s attitude became less firm. She hesitated for a while and said,”Alright then ... Thank you, Zhao Da ... Thank you, everyone!”

When Zhuo Yiyi saw Song Wei take the card, she couldn’t help but look at song Rui.

Although Zhuo Yiyi was carefree, she was actually very clear about the priorities of the matter and did not rashly accept the card.

Song Rui smiled and said,”Yiyi, you should accept it too!” He had to give face to big brother Zhao! Besides ... You should treat your colleagues and friends in the hospital to meals and entertainment when you have time, so that you can get to know each other! I think our paradise gathering is not bad. You can bring your colleagues over to have fun, and it can also be considered as helping us increase our popularity!”

Only then did Zhuo Yiyi nod and say,””Alright then ... Thank you!”

Song Rui waved his hand and said,”you’re welcome!” Besides, I don’t have many shares. The two hundred thousand in this card is mostly from ruofei and brother Zhao!”

Zhuo Yiyi immediately reverted to her usual demoness and glared at song Rui.””Who’s thanking you! I’m just thanking brother Zhao and handsome Xia!”

Xia ruofei and Zhao Yongjun looked at each other and smiled. Then, Xia ruofei said,””Sister – in – Law, no need to be polite! We’re all on the same side!”

After handing out the membership cards to Xia ruofei and the rest, Zhao Yongjun led them towards the entrance.

“Brother Zhao, how many membership cards have we given out?” Xia ruofei asked as they walked. There shouldn’t be many of these diamond cards, right?”

The rarer something was, the more expensive it would be. Some of the tricks in the business world were no longer a secret. As a high – end club, Paradise Club would definitely set a threshold. Not just anyone could enter with money. The diamond card was the highest level of membership card, so it was definitely impossible to give it out everywhere. Otherwise, it would not show its nobility.

Zhao Yongjun laughed,”you’re finally concerned about the club’s operation!” You’re really thorough in being a hands – off shopkeeper!”

Xia ruofei laughed drily and said,””I’m just trusting you, aren’t I? I know that everyone here has outstanding abilities and I can’t help much ...”

Zhao Yongjun laughed and scolded,”stop trying to bewitch me!” I’m not a little girl at the nightclub, sweet words are useless Against Me!”

Of course, Zhao Yongjun was just joking. He didn’t really blame Xia ruofei for not helping.

In fact, they were all very clear that it was all Xia ruofei’s own strength that they were able to get this land at a low price after so many twists and turns.

Therefore, even if Xia ruofei never asked about the trifle matters of the establishment of the club, his contribution to the Paradise gathering was the greatest among the few people.

So, Zhao Yongjun only teased him a little and didn’t harp on the issue.

He introduced the cards to Xia ruofei.”There are 30 diamond cards in total. We announced that the annual fee is one million, but only a few of them are sold. Most of them are free.”

Xia ruofei understood. He nodded and said,”I understand!”

Xia ruofei had also participated in the design of the Paradise Club’s membership program. Hence, he knew very well that the so – called annual fee was actually a pre – charge. After a member paid one million, he would not only receive the highest VIP treatment in Paradise Club, but also have one million in his membership card. The usual spending in Paradise Club would be directly deducted from the balance.

Of course, this one million was valid for a year. After a year, no matter how much one million was spent, the remaining money would not be accumulated in the next year. If one wanted to continue to maintain the membership, they would have to pay an annual fee of one million for the second year. Of course, this would also be added to the balance of the membership card.

However, if the money in the card was spent within a year, it didn’t matter. He would still maintain his membership and pay the bill after each purchase. Some members even had a certain credit limit and could rely on the membership card to buy on credit.

This was for those who paid for membership. In fact, only a few diamond cards with a million – year fee were sold. Most of them were given away.

Those who could receive a diamond card were naturally the more influential people in the circle of rich Playboys in Beijing.

Of course, the free membership card would not have any balance in it. Members still had to pay for their own expenses in Paradise Club.

To put it bluntly, this membership card only represented one’s identity. At the same time, being able to hold a Diamond Membership card was a symbol of identity in itself, especially when everyone was in the same circle. I was given a diamond card, while you only had a Gold Card. You even had to spend money to Buy Membership. When the two were compared, the difference was obvious.

In addition to the consideration of connections, this was also a marketing method.
