Chapter 1640: The power of the array (3)

As soon as Chen Dazhuang arrived in Beijing, Zheng Hua gathered everyone together and said that he would be transferred to a new construction site to work. Naturally, he also brought Chen Dazhuang.

The old minibus, which had obviously exceeded the standard of the emission limit, drove for more than 40 minutes and finally arrived next to the Imperial hot spring resort in Xiaotang town.

This was the land that Liu haofan and the Tang real estate had bought for a sky – High price of 410 million.

As soon as Zheng Hua got out of the car, he asked the workers to unload their luggage, and then prepared to pick up the truck. Soon, a truck would arrive, which would contain some of their daily necessities and materials for the temporary housing.

The first thing the workers did was naturally to build mobile houses to solve their living problems.

Chen Dazhuang got out of the car with the big guy, holding the quilt and looking around.

“Dazhuang, stop daydreaming!” Zheng Hua shouted.”Hurry up and put the things here. Then, follow me to take a look at the venue!”

“Woof! It’s coming!” Chen Dazhuang quickly responded. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

He handed his luggage to another fellow townsman, then jogged to catch up with Zheng Hua.

Zheng Hua was looking for a place to build a mobile house, so he went straight inside with Chen Dazhuang.

As soon as the two of them walked into the range of the array, Chen Dazhuang felt uncomfortable all over. It was bright and sunny, but he felt a burst of cold.

Could it be that he was not acclimatized to the environment? Chen Dazhuang saw that Zheng Hua did not have any abnormalities and could not help but Mutter in his heart.

In the end, Zheng Hua found a place near the lake. He planned to direct the truck to unload the things here in a while, and then build a mobile house to make it close to the water source, so that it would be more convenient for everyone to live.

Of course, he didn’t know that they were close to the water source, but also very close to the array eye that Xia ruofei had set up.

The workers living here were destined to have many stories ...

After a while, the truck that was transporting the goods arrived at the construction site. Zheng Hua quickly directed the truck to drive over, and then asked everyone to help unload the truck.

There were professional workers to build mobile houses, and Chen Dazhuang and the others were at most just assistants.

In just half a day, a two – story mobile house was completed.

In addition to living space, there were toilets, kitchen lights, and living facilities. The living rooms were also equipped with heating and air conditioning. Two gasoline generators, one main and one auxiliary, were also installed.

The workers had long been used to such a life, and everyone quickly moved their luggage into their rooms and began to make their beds.

After a busy period, the sky gradually darkened.

The lights in the mobile temporary house were also turned on. The two female workers who were responsible for cooking also began to work in the kitchen. The workers who had been tired for a long time were not idle while waiting for dinner. They all gathered in the room and played cards.

Chen Dazhuang wasn’t very familiar with everyone. The only uncle he knew, Zheng Hua, was busy arranging various things, so he had nothing to do alone.

He simply left the noisy room and prepared to walk around the lake.

When he got to the first floor, Chen Dazhuang felt a little uncomfortable in his stomach, so he rushed upstairs to grab some toilet paper and trotted to the simple toilet about ten meters away from the mobile house.

Chen Dazhuang unbuckled his belt, opened the door of the toilet, and went in.

Just as he was about to squat down, he suddenly felt a gust of cold wind blowing, and he could not help but shiver.

Then, he inadvertently glanced at the squat toilet, and suddenly lost his soul ...
