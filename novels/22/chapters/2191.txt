2192 An unexpected visitor (2)

Ling Qingxue felt even more embarrassed after being teased by Feng Rao. She glared at Xia ruofei and said,””You’re so glib!”

Feng Rao felt like she was sitting on pins and needles when she saw Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue flirting with each other.

She stood up and said,”ruofei, Qingxue, I’m almost done with my report. You guys can continue chatting. I’m going back.”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”sister ran, it’s already so late. Don’t leave!” I have a lot of rooms here, so you can stay here for the night! I’m going to the company tomorrow anyway, so let’s go together!”

In fact, this was a consensus that the two of them had reached before. However, in front of Ling Qingxue, Xia ruofei naturally could not say it out loud. This could be considered a white lie! After all, Xia ruofei did not have any ill intentions when it came to Feng Jing’s accommodation. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Of course, he couldn’t just let Feng Jing leave like that. Firstly, it was already late at night, and it was definitely not safe for a girl to leave by herself. Besides, he was the one who invited Feng Jing to stay the night. Now that Ling Qingxue had suddenly appeared and allowed Feng Jing to leave, Feng Jing would definitely feel aggrieved.

What was this? To come and go as he was called?

“No, no...” Feng Jing replied,”it’s not too late yet. It’s not too far away if I call a taxi back to the company.”

When Ling Qingxue heard that Xia ruofei wanted Feng Jing to stay the night, she could not help but glance at Xia ruofei with a half – Smile, feeling a little sour in her heart.

However, looking at it from another perspective, if Xia ruofei allowed Feng Jing to stay in the room in front of her, didn’t it mean that Xia ruofei was innocent and honest?

Ling Qingxue felt much better when she thought about it.

She looked at Feng Rao with a smile and said,””Sister ran, why are you being so formal? RUO Fei and I are not outsiders. How can we be at ease if you go out alone at this hour? I think you should just stay here for the night ... We haven’t had a good chat yet! Let’s Stay Together tonight!”

This move of Ling Qingxue’s was very clever. It not only showed her magnanimous side, but also showed her status as the mistress of the house. Furthermore, if she stayed behind to sleep with Feng Rao, she would be able to eliminate any potential danger. It was killing three birds with one stone.

Xia ruofei was still in a daze as he looked at Ling Qingxue.

Why else would they say that women were natural – born experts in Palace Fighting? Ling Qingxue’s almost thoughtless reaction made Xia ruofei gasp in amazement.

Of course, Ling Qingxue could not hide her thoughts from Xia ruofei and Feng Rao.

Feng Rao smiled bitterly in her heart. This way, she couldn’t leave even if she wanted to. Otherwise, she would be too unreasonable.

Although it would be very awkward for her to stay, she had no choice but to nod and say,””Alright ... Then I’ll have to trouble you!”

“Why would I?” Ling Qingxue said happily. We can’t be happier! Right, ruofei?”

Xia ruofei squeezed out a smile and said,””Mm! Yes, yes, yes ...”

“Sister ran,” Ling Qingxue said.”Sit down for a while. I’ll call my dad and let him know!”

Ling Qingxue picked up her phone and went upstairs.

After Ling Qingxue went upstairs, Xia ruofei and Feng Rao looked at each other.

Feng Rao said to Xia ruofei silently. Xia ruofei could guess what Feng Rao was saying just by reading her mouth. Yingluo, it’s all your fault!

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile bitterly and said,””Sister che, take a seat. I’ll heat up the dumplings. Let’s eat some later!”

With that, he walked to the cabinet at the entrance and picked up the lunchbox that Ling Qingxue had brought. He then fled into the kitchen.

Feng Rao didn’t know whether to sit or stand and felt uncomfortable.

Ling Qingxue finished her call very quickly. She told Ling Xiaotian that Xia ruofei had a female friend who was visiting and wanted to chat with her for a while. She was afraid that she would wake Ling Xiaotian up if she returned too late, so she was staying the night.

Ling Xiaotian agreed to Qianqian’s request without hesitation. He did not care if it was Ling Qingxue’s excuse. Anyway, he was well aware of the progress between Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue.

What era was it now? Naturally, Ling Xiaotian would not be so old – fashioned.

Moreover, he was extremely satisfied with Xia ruofei as his future son – in – Law. How could he possibly set up obstacles in this kind of thing?

After all, Ling Xiaotian was once young! He knew the young man’s mind very well.

Ling Qingxue went downstairs and asked with a smile,””Eh? Sister che, where did that guy go?”

“Ruofei said to heat up the dumplings ...” Feng Rao said unnaturally.

“Alright!” Ling Qingxue said enthusiastically,”sister ran, try it later!” My dad made this himself, he’s really good at it!”

“Sure ...” Feng Jing felt like she was a toy at the mercy of others. She just had to agree to whatever Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue said.”President Ling’s cooking skills are definitely beyond doubt!”

In fact, Xia ruofei had already heated up the dumplings in the microwave very quickly. However, he waited until he heard Ling Qingxue coming downstairs before he brought the dumplings out.

“Time to eat dumplings!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sister ran, Qingxue! Come and eat with us!”

Ling Qingxue had brought a lot of dumplings. Xia ruofei filled up two big plates, along with the utensils and vinegar. He had to make three trips to bring them all out.

Ling Qingxue and Feng Rao went to the dining room. Although the three of them were not very hungry, they each ate a few dumplings and Xia ruofei put the rest in the refrigerator.

After finishing the dumplings, Feng Rao took the initiative to go to the kitchen with Ling Qingxue to wash the dishes. Xia ruofei also wiped away his cold sweat and sat on the sofa to rest with a bitter smile.

The two women quickly tidied up and walked out of the kitchen.

“Qingxue, I think I’ll sleep alone tonight!” Feng Rao said. You can go with ruofei ...”

Ling Qingxue blushed and said,”sister ran, what are you saying?” How can I sleep with him? We’re not even married ...”

Xia ruofei looked at Ling Qingxue in amusement and said,”Qingxue, I guess sister ran is not used to sleeping with others! Don’t join in the fun, there are a lot of rooms here, I’ll just get you another one!”

“Oh! “Alright ...” Ling Qingxue said, her face slightly red.

Xia ruofei’s words seemed to be trying to hide something, but of course, Feng Rao was not stupid enough to expose him. She just smiled and asked,””Ruofei, which room should I sleep in tonight? I want to go to bed early ...”

Xia ruofei quickly replied,”Oh!” Okay, okay, okay ... Sister che, you can sleep in the guest room on the first floor! Qingxue, bring sister ran to her room and help her with the bed. There’s a whole set of bedsheets in the cabinet, and they’re all brand new!”

Ling Qingxue immediately replied,”sure!” Just leave it to me!”

“Sister Jing, come with me!” She turned to Feng Jing.

Xia ruofei also smiled at Feng Rao and said,””Good night, sister Che!”

The disappointment in Feng Rao’s eyes disappeared in an instant. Then, she smiled and said,”Good night!”

Ling Qingxue brought Feng Rao to the guest room, while Xia ruofei quickly grabbed the cleaning tools and went to the second floor.

Today, he had only cleaned the first floor. Now, he needed to clean the master bedroom upstairs as well. As for the other rooms, he didn’t need to care about them for the time being since no one lived there anyway.

Xia ruofei had just finished cleaning all the furniture in the room and was about to mop the floor when Ling Qingxue came into the room.

She leaned against the door frame, the corner of her mouth slightly curved into a charming arc, and said,””President Xia, you’re so diligent! Don’t tell me you’re feeling a little guilty?”

Xia ruofei mopped the floor and said without looking up,””What’s there to be guilty about? Am I doing this in a righteous manner? You’re the one who’s thinking the wrong way ... Lift your leg! Don’t interfere with my work ...”

Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei, who was dragging the second floor, and laughed.””I was just joking with you! Even if I don’t believe you, do you think I won’t believe sister che?”
