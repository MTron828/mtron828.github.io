Chapter 592: Chapter 444 – making a fortune (1)

Xie Xun was confused by Xia ruofei’s “thank you” but when Xia ruofei opened the door of the pickup truck, his attention was immediately drawn to it. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

In the back of the pickup truck, three large plastic boxes were neatly placed side by side.

Xie Xun took a glance and chuckled,””Old Ling, old Li, this young man is quite creative! You’re actually using plastic boxes to store Arowana?”

Ling Xiaotian’s face darkened as he ignored Xie Xun. Li Zongheng and the rest did not have Xie Xun’s sharp tongue. Although they were slightly disappointed, they still maintained their manners and smiled.

“Mr. Xie,” Xia ruofei said indifferently,”the meat in the bun doesn’t lie in the folds. If you want a beautiful fish tank, you can order any style for 5000 Yuan!”

Xie Xun laughed coldly. Xia ruofei could not be bothered with him. Without waiting for his venomous tongue to strike again, he opened the back of the truck. Then, he easily picked up a plastic tidying box and placed it on the ground.

Xia ruofei’s movements were fast and steady. The Arowana in the plastic box did not even feel the vibration and continued to swim in the box leisurely.

Before Xia ruofei could move the second plastic box, he heard a gasp behind him, so he turned around.

Other than Ling Xiaotian, the other five people were all staring at the plastic box on the ground with their eyes wide open. The disdainful smile on Xie Xun’s face didn’t even disappear before it froze, making him look a little funny.

Shocking!

Fanatical!

It was unbelievable!

All kinds of emotions could be seen from their eyes.

......

The one with the most expression was undoubtedly Xie Xun. He thought that Xia ruofei was just trying to save face. In a hurry, he even made a bet of two million Yuan. Although two million Yuan was nothing to him, it would be embarrassing if he lost to a young kid like Xia ruofei, especially in front of li Zongheng and his old friends.

Xie Xun looked at the two high – Quality blood – Red Dragons in the plastic sorting box, and a hint of uneasiness rose in his heart.

Xia ruofei took in everyone’s expressions and turned around with a faint smile. He continued to move the other two boxes out of the truck and placed them side by side on the empty space behind the pickup truck.

“They’re all top – grade blood – Red Dragons!” There was a hint of excitement in li Zongheng’s voice.”Xiao Xia, you ... Where did you get so many high – Quality blood red Dragons? This is just too unbelievable ...”

Xia ruofei had a faint smile on his face and did not say anything.

Li Zongheng also knew that he had asked something he should not have asked in his agitation. If the other party had his own way of obtaining such a high – Quality Blood Red Dragon, how could he have told him?

Li Zongheng laughed awkwardly and turned to look at Ling Xiaotian.

Initially, Ling Xiaotian was also slightly worried. However, when the six blood – Red Dragons appeared in front of everyone, his suspended heart finally relaxed and his face revealed a proud look.

Ling Xiaotian looked at the dazed Xie Xun and laughed,””Third brother Xie, the bet just now still counts, right?”

Xie Xun looked at Xia ruofei with a complicated expression and said,””When did I, Xie laosan, go back on my word? Old Li, you guys decide!”

In fact, everyone was an old player in the ornamental fish community. These big bosses especially liked Red Arowana, including Xie Xun himself. They could already tell the result with one look. There was no need to judge carefully.

However, since it was a bet of two million dollars, li Zongheng and the others still carefully moved closer to take a look. They compared their figures, hair shapes, scales, hair colors, and other aspects.

After a while, li Zongheng, Xu Desheng, and the other two exchanged their opinions in a low voice. Then, li Zongheng acted as the representative and looked at Xie Xun.”Old Xie, we all agree that Xiao Xia has won this bet.”

Xia ruofei still looked calm and said,””Thank you, boss li.”

Ling Xiaotian laughed and asked,””Third Xie, do you have any objections to old Li’s judgment?”

Xie Xun’s face turned red and white. When he saw the six fish, Xie Xun knew that his chances of winning were very low. However, he still had a bit of hope. If one of the fish had any minor flaws, as long as it couldn’t beat Ling Xiaotian’s two Blood Dragons, he would still win.

However, li Zongheng and the others ‘judgment completely shattered his fantasy.

However, even though Xie Xun had a sharp tongue, he was still considered a Bachelor. Of course, this was also in front of his old friends. He wouldn’t lose face, so he simply said,””This time, I, old Xie, was wrong! I’ll accept this bet!”

After he finished speaking, Xie Xun took out his checkbook without hesitation. He used his gold pen to write a check for two million and passed it to Xia ruofei. He said,”Young man, the future generations are to be feared!”

Xia ruofei took the check with a smile. He only glanced at the numbers on it and put it away without checking its authenticity. In such an occasion, the possibility of Xie Xun cheating or even writing a fake check was almost zero.

“Thank you, director Xie!” Xia ruofei said again.

Xie Xun suddenly thought of the “thank you” that Xia ruofei had said before he opened the car door. The gloominess in his heart increased. So, the other party had victory in their hands, and he had rushed over to give them money.
