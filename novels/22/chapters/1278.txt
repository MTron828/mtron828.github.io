Although it was shocking news that Xia ruofei had recovered from a bone fracture in one or two months and had even returned to the field, it was still acceptable compared to the miracle that Xia ruofei had actually created.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”director Guo, I’m glad I did!” The star of Hong Kong’s injuries were basically healed. However, you still have to persist in using the ointment I left behind. After all, it’s still considered to have just recovered from a major injury, so it’s very necessary to consolidate the effect. ”

“Understood!” Guo Hongjiang’s tone became more respectful.”Mr. Xia, I’ll definitely do what you’ve asked me to do. Don’t worry, this matter will not be spread!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.”Don’t overdo it in the early stages. Give ‘star of Hong Kong’ some time to get used to it. It will definitely surpass its peak state in one to two months!”

“Alright, alright! I’ll definitely do as you say!” Guo Hongjiang said.

“Mr. Xia, are you going to leave today?” he asked.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yeah!” I’m preparing to book an afternoon flight back to the mainland. You know, I have a small company in San Shan. Although the business isn’t as big as director Guo ‘s, it’s still quite busy. I’ve been out for too long this time, it’s time to go back. ”

Guo Hongjiang pondered for a while and said,”Mr. Xia, what do you think?” Stay for another day, I’ll treat you and director MA to dinner tonight, and I’ll send you back on a private jet tomorrow morning. It won’t take too much time. ”

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”Director Guo, you’re welcome. We’ll have plenty of opportunities after dinner!”

“No, no, no!” Guo Hongjiang quickly said,”Mr. Xia, I had originally planned to invite you over as a guest, but you’ve worked so hard for so many days for the ‘star of Hong Kong’. You even have to live and eat with me. I already feel bad about it. If you don’t even have a meal, how will I put my face if this gets out? Even if others don’t say it, Chairman MA will definitely poke at my back!”

Xia ruofei hesitated.

Guo Hongjiang said again,”I’ll just have a simple meal at my own house!” Mr. Xia, you’ve helped me so much this time. Please give me a chance to express my gratitude!”

Xia ruofei nodded helplessly and said,””Alright, I’ll stay for one more day! But there’s no need to send a plane, I’ll just take a civil flight back tomorrow!”

“The earliest flight will be at noon!” Guo Hongjiang said,”Mr. Xia, you don’t have to be so polite. It’s very convenient to own your own plane. All you have to do is to apply for the flight route. I haven’t been traveling much recently and have spent so much money on the crew. I have to find something for them to do!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”Alright! Since you’ve said so, I won’t be polite with you!”

Soon, Guo Hongjiang arranged for a confidant to come to the training base to take charge of the overall situation.

He repeatedly told this subordinate about the things that Xia ruofei had told him to take note of. Then, he handed the ointment that Xia ruofei had left behind to this subordinate.

After the job arrangements were made, Guo Hongjiang wanted to accompany Xia ruofei on a tour of Hong Kong. However, Xia ruofei considered that although she had been in Hong Kong for a long time, she had not spent much time with little Huanhuan. Hence, she declined Guo Hongjiang’s good intentions.

He asked Guo Hongjiang to send him back to the MA family.

As Xia ruofei had called the MA family in advance, MA Xiong and Tian Huixin were both at home when Xia ruofei arrived at the MA family’s Villa. Ma Zhiming, on the other hand, was at the corporation dealing with Public Affairs. MA Xiong had begun to gradually transfer his power to his son, Ma Zhiming, and MA Xiong was not very busy most of the time.

Xia ruofei did not see Huanhuan because the kindergarten was not on holiday yet. It was not the weekend, so Huanhuan had gone to school.

However, when Tian Huixin found out that Xia ruofei had specially come over to accompany Huanhuan, she decided to pick Huanhuan up from the kindergarten in the afternoon and applied for leave in the afternoon.

Huanhuan attended an elite kindergarten that was owned by Hengfeng group. As the princess of the MA family, it was only a matter of time before she asked for half a day off.

“Xia Sheng!” As soon as Xia ruofei got out of the car, MA Xiong welcomed him warmly.”Are you done with your business?”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded,”yeah!” At least we didn’t fail, or else we’d have smashed our signboard!”

“How could Xia Sheng have missed?” MA Xiong laughed. Director Guo called me just now. He was so shocked!”

Xia ruofei smiled humbly and said,””Chairman Guo, you’re overpraising me. By the way, Mr. MA, director Guo said he’d treat us to dinner tonight. ”

“He told me on the phone!” MA Xiong smiled and said,”we’ll go together in the evening. You can play with Huanhuan for the day!” The little girl talks about you every day!”

Tian Huixin smiled.”Huanhuan is still in kindergarten, but I’ll pick her up at noon. She’ll be so happy if she knows that brother ruofei has come to accompany her!”

Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and said,”Huanhuan went to school?” Then I’ll go pick them up with aunt Tian at noon! Let her be happy too!”

“Alright!” Tian Huixin said happily.

Everyone entered the villa. MA Xiong and Xia ruofei sat in the garden, making tea and chatting.

Although the old man was old, he was still in good spirits and had a clear mind when it came to business. Xia ruofei even joked that he had handed over his power too early. In fact, he could still work hard for another ten years.

When it was close to noon, Xia ruofei and Tian Huixin went to pick up Huanhuan from her kindergarten.

The kindergarten that Huanhuan was studying at was a property of Hengfeng group. It was the kind of elite kindergarten that had a staggering tuition fee. In addition, the MA family had arranged many people to protect her in secret. The manpower and material resources arranged for this little girl alone were uncountable.

When the two of them arrived at the entrance of the kindergarten, the principal, who had been informed in advance, was already waiting there with Huanhuan.

When Huan Huan saw Xia ruofei, she cried out in surprise,””Brother RUO Fei!”

Then, she shook off the director’s hand and ran towards Xia ruofei.

The director jumped in shock, but soon saw Tian Huixin waving at Xia ruofei. She heaved a sigh of relief and bowed slightly to Tian Huixin from afar.

Xia ruofei squatted down. When Huanhuan pounced on him, he hugged her and asked with a smile,””Huanhuan, have you been a good girl in kindergarten?”

“Huanhuan is so obedient!” Huan Huan said proudly,”my teacher always praises me!”

Xia ruofei had a malicious thought.”Could it be that the teacher was trying to flatter the boss?

“Today, I came here to accompany you. Are you happy?” Xia ruofei asked again.

Huan Huan pouted and said,”you should have come earlier!” Brother ruofei, you’ve been in Hong Kong for so many days and only came to see Huanhuan now, do you not like me anymore?”

Xia ruofei’s face darkened and he quickly said,””Big brother had something to do at the last minute and couldn’t leave, but didn’t he come over immediately after he settled it? He didn’t even have time to shower! Can you smell it?”

Xia ruofei said as he put his sleeve next to Huanhuan’s nose. Huanhuan giggled and covered her nose.”Don ‘t! Don ‘t! I don’t smell stinky things!”

Looking at her daughter who was playing around with Xia ruofei and laughing happily, Tian Huixin couldn’t help but feel emotional. Unknowingly, her eyes became a little wet.

After he brought Huanhuan home, Xia ruofei accompanied her for the entire afternoon.

Of course, considering that they were going out in the evening, they did not go out in the afternoon. Xia ruofei stayed in the MA family villa to play with Huanhuan.

He really liked this cute little girl. Whether it was hide – and – seek, horse riding, or other games, he cooperated unconditionally. Huanhuan was very happy, and her innocent laughter echoed in the whole villa.

In the evening, Xia ruofei bade farewell to Huan Huan, who still wanted more. He left with MA Xiong in the car and headed to Guo Hongjiang’s mansion at the top of the mountain.
