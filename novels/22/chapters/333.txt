Chapter 334: The girl’s thoughts (3)

Slowly, Xia ruofei’s emotions calmed down. He sat there until nineo’ clock before he got up and went back to the villa with lightning. In the yard, Xia ruofei played with lightning affectionately for a while before letting it go back to its nest to sleep. He then pushed the door open and entered the villa. Li Zhifu had already returned to his room to rest. Ye Lingyun was sitting on the sofa alone, watching TV. Seeing Xia ruofei return, ye Lingyun quickly stood up to greet him. Xia ruofei nodded and said,””Ling Yun, you should rest early too! You don’t have to patrol at night, you must be tired. ” “It’s fine, brother Xia!” Ye Lingyun chuckled.”I have good stamina, so I’m fine! The vegetables on our farm are so valuable. If there’s a thief, we’ll suffer a huge loss!” “Don’t we have infrared surveillance cameras? If someone were to climb over the wall, they’d give a warning. ” Xia ruofei said,”just sleep well at night. Aren’t the surveillance cameras in your room?” “I understand, brother Xia.” Ye linyun smiled. “By the way, when will the few comrades you mentioned arrive?” Xia ruofei asked. “Within these two days!” Ye Lingyun replied,”I’m the one who booked their tickets, but their departure points are all different. The latest one should be able to arrive the day after tomorrow.” Xia ruofei nodded and agreed. If I’m not at home, please help them settle down. I’ve already asked manager li to give them two mobile houses. We’ll let them overcome the problem for a few days, and there won’t be a problem when our house is built. ” “Alright!” Ye linyun said,”don’t worry, brother Xia! We’re all from poor backgrounds, so it’s fine as long as we have a place to live. ” Xia ruofei nodded and walked upstairs. When he reached the stairs, he stopped and turned his head.””Oh right, Ling Yun, I have to make a trip to the city tomorrow. I might not be coming for lunch. Old Mr. Li’s medicine is in the refrigerator. Remember to heat it up for him to drink after meals every day. ” “Understood!” Ye linyun said. Xia ruofei then went back to his room. The next morning, Xia ruofei left Taoyuan farm in his pickup truck after breakfast and headed straight for the city’s Sanshan University. Considering that Knight XV would be too eye – catching on campus, Xia ruofei chose a low – Profile pickup truck. Xia ruofei arrived at Sanshan University at around half – past eight. The last time he visited professor Tian, professor Tian had helped him apply for a car pass, so Xia ruofei’s pickup truck could enter the campus without any hindrance. He slowed down the car and took out his phone to call Lu You as he drove. “Lu You, I’m already here.” Xia ruofei asked,”where shall we meet?” “We just got up!” Lu You said sleepily,”wait for a while below our dormitory. You can enter the second dormitory building on the right.” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and shook his head.””Alright! Then hurry up ...” “I know, I know, it’ll be quick! Ten minutes!” Lu You said and hung up the phone. Xia ruofei realized that he had already driven past it, so he turned around at the intersection in front and drove back for a while. He saw colorful girls ‘clothes hanging outside the window of the second dormitory building. He knew that he had found the right place, so he stopped the car not far away from the dormitory building and waited. This wait lasted for more than half an hour. It was only at 9:10 am that Xia ruofei saw Lu You, who had said on the phone that she would be down in ten minutes, walking out of the dormitory building. Beside her was Jiang Yue, who had obviously dressed up. Xia ruofei had no energy to complain about the time the girls spent dressing up before leaving the house. The unit of measurement must be different from usual. They said that one minute was probably 200 seconds ...F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com
