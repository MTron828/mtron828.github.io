Chapter 421: Chapter 372 – letting go of past enmity (1)

Lu You felt that she had a long dream. In the dream, she was being chased by a ferocious – looking monster. She could only keep running, but no matter how she ran, the monster would always follow closely behind her.

Moreover, she seemed to have fallen into a maze. The road under her feet seemed to be exactly the same, and the surrounding scenery did not change at all. She ran until she was exhausted, and just as she was about to be buried in the bloody mouth of the monster, she suddenly felt that the ground under her feet was empty, and her entire person fell into an endless abyss.

Lu You woke up with a start.

She first felt a splitting headache. She said in her heart,””Luckily it was just a dream ... It was so scary ... The birds outside the window are chirping, the sky should be bright now! I have to get out of bed ... I still have professor Liu’s elective class in the morning ... Wait! The chirping of birds ... There aren’t even any trees near the dormitory, where did the chirping come from?”

At this moment, what happened last night surged into her mind like a tide. Lu You’s face instantly turned pale, and she immediately sat up on the bed.

When she realized that she was lying on a large bed in an unfamiliar room, her expression changed drastically, and she subconsciously looked down.

Her coat and wool sweater were gone, and she was only left with a very large piece of thermal underwear.

Lu You couldn’t help but scream.

Xia ruofei was sleeping in a daze. Last night, Lu You did not sleep well. She would let out panicked cries from time to time in her sleep. He had woken up a few times in the middle of the night and could only sleep peacefully for a while after fouro’ clock. However, he had only slept for two to three hours before he was awakened by Lu You’s screams.

Xia ruofei sat up and ran to the bed.

Lu You was covering her face with both hands and crying bitterly.

She had already completely remembered what had happened last night. Of course, the only memory she had was that she had been forcefully dragged to the room on the second floor and forced to drink a large bottle of wine. She had no impression of what had happened after she had completely fallen drunk. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Now that she had woken up in an unfamiliar room, and even her clothes had been changed, Lu You felt that it was self – evident what had happened last night.

She had been pampered since she was young and had never experienced any hardships or setbacks. She had never thought that one day she would encounter such a tragic nightmare. Her pure body was violated by a hooligan. The more she thought about it, the sadder she felt and she couldn’t help but cry.

“Lu You, what’s wrong?” Xia ruofei quickly walked to the bed and asked with concern.

“Get lost! Get ... Get lost!” Lu You screamed hysterically and scratched at Xia ruofei frantically. When she saw the person in front of her, her hands froze and her face revealed an expression of disbelief.”Xia ... Xia ruofei?” Why are you here?”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”Do you want the people in front of you to be the scumbags from last night?”

Lu You quickly shook her head and then asked,””What’s going on?”

“I was going to ask you!” Xia ruofei said unhappily,”why would a girl like you go to that kind of place to drink? Don’t you know that this is very dangerous? If I didn’t see your WeChat message last night and rushed over, you would have ...”

Xia ruofei did not continue after that and glared at Lu You.

In the past, if Xia ruofei spoke to Lu You with such an attitude, she would definitely be angry and argue with Xia ruofei.

But today, Lu You acted out of character and didn’t argue with Xia ruofei. On the contrary, when she saw Xia ruofei’s angry look, a warm current flowed through her heart.

Lu You lowered her head and said softly,”I’m sorry ...”

Xia ruofei saw that Lu You’s attitude towards admitting her mistake was so good and didn’t have the heart to say anything more. After all, she was still in shock after last night’s incident.

Xia ruofei looked at Lu You and asked,””Your head hurts, right?”

Lu You nodded pitifully and then asked,””Where is this place?”

“Where else could it be? It’s the Taoyuan farm!” Xia ruofei said,”I was the one who carried you back last night. I didn’t expect you to be so heavy despite your slim figure! You really can’t judge a book by its cover ...”

“I didn ‘t!” Lu You quickly glanced at Xia ruofei and said,”I’m only 50 kilograms!”

Lu You was very tall and was more than 1.7 meters tall. A weight of 100 pounds was already considered very slim.

Xia ruofei saw that Lu You was still concerned about whether he was heavy or not and couldn’t help but laugh.””Alright, you rest for a while. I’ll go get you a bowl of hangover soup ...”

“Oh ... I’ll have to trouble you then ...” Lu You said softly.

Xia ruofei smiled and walked out of the door. At this moment, Lu You suddenly realized something and quickly asked,””Xia ruofei, I ... What’s with my clothes?”

Xia ruofei stopped in his tracks and an awkward expression appeared on his face. However, when he turned around, his expression had already turned into one of annoyance. He said,”You still say it! You vomited a lot last night, you know? I originally arranged for you to stay in the guest room next door, but as soon as you laid down, you vomited all over the bed, and even vomited on me. Your own clothes were also dirtied!”

Lu You didn’t expect this to happen either. She immediately looked apologetic and said,””I’m sorry ... I ... I don’t remember ...”He said.
