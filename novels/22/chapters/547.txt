Chapter 548: Astonishing profit (2)

This did not include the other grades of wine. The cost of those three – month, five – month, and one – year wines was exactly the same as the one – month ones, but the selling price was N – times higher. The profit was naturally quite frightening.

Xia ruofei did a quick calculation in his mind.

In the three – month period, they would produce three tons of bottles per month, which was equivalent to about 6000 bottles. The selling price was 588 Yuan per bottle, the sales volume was 3.528 million Yuan, and the estimated profit was 3.2 million Yuan.

In the five months period, they produced one ton per month, which was equivalent to about 2000 bottles. The selling price was 888 Yuan per bottle, the sales were 1.776 million Yuan, and the estimated profit was 1.6 million Yuan.

In a year, they would produce 500 catties per month, which was equivalent to about 500 bottles. The selling price was 8888 Yuan per bottle, the sales volume was 4.44 million Yuan, and the estimated profit was 4.4 million Yuan.

One could imagine that in two months, the three – month Drunken Eight Immortals would be listed on the market, and Xia ruofei’s profits would rise again.

After 11 months, all the different grades of Drunken Eight Immortals would be available in the market. By then, the winery would be able to make a profit of 24.2 million Yuan per month.

In other words, Xia ruofei could get 12 million Chinese dollars in profits from the winery alone, which was more than 100 million Chinese dollars a year.

Moreover, this was the profit that Xia ruofei could get. If they added the other half of Ling Xiaotian’s profit, the winery could generate more than 300 million in profits in a year, which was quite shocking.

Xia ruofei had never seriously calculated the profit, and he was a little speechless after doing the calculation.

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei said,””Uncle Ling, I think we should do some proper promotion! We must promote the Drunken Eight Immortals wine to the entire country as soon as possible. ”

Ling Xiaotian chuckled and nodded,””I agree! I’ve already asked the winery to make a promotion plan. I wanted to see the market reaction first, but since it’s selling so well, let’s start advertising in advance!”

Xia ruofei said,”no, no, no!” I don’t think the first step should be advertising. ”

“Oh? Do you have any good ideas, ruofei?” Ling Xiaotian asked with interest.

Li Jing, who was at the side, also listened attentively. Xia ruofei was also the boss of the winery! Moreover, he was also the Chairman’s son – in – Law, so the chairman would most likely accept his words.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”this is also what I suddenly thought of when I heard manager Li’s sales report. The sudden rise of Drunken Eight Immortals in the three mountains market is undoubtedly a miracle, even a classic case. I think we can make some articles about this. For example, we can hire some internet trolls to write articles and hype it up on the internet.”

“That’s a good idea!”Ling Xiaotian’s eyes lit up.

“Mr. Xia, this topic is quite interesting,” said Li Jing in admiration.”We can totally invite a few local media outlets to report on it, and then let the Internet Water Army use this as a pretext to make a fuss. They can post with various identities, focusing on things like white wine from the memories of the people of the three mountains. They can play the card of love ...”

Li Jing got into character very quickly and immediately began to draw inferences.

Xia ruofei smiled.”I’m just giving you a direction. You’ll have to decide on the actual plan and execute it.”

“Yes!” Li Jing immediately replied. I’ll go back and report to the factory manager immediately, then gather our capable people to come up with a plan!”

Ling Xiaotian nodded his head and said,”little li, this matter should be done as soon as possible. We have to take advantage of this craze to hype it up!.”

“Understood!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”in terms of advertising, I suggest that we focus more on internet media. Also, we can spend money on something like Baidu index. We can put more effort in searching for people. After all, after the fake reviewers hype, the audience will be more on the internet. This can also form a corresponding effect.”

Li Jing nodded his head repeatedly. At the same time, he quickly jotted down the information in his notebook.

“Oh, yes. Uncle Ling, I have some ideas about the sales of our Drunken Eight Immortals,” Xia ruofei continued.

“Speak!” Ling Xiaotian said.

He was getting more and more satisfied with this future son – in – Law of his. Not only did he come up with the extremely good taste of the Drunken Eight Immortals white wine, but he also had a lot of ideas in terms of marketing, and they were all effective. He was definitely not one of those people who just talked big.

Thus, Ling Xiaotian was looking forward to Xia ruofei’s next suggestion.

Xia ruofei said,”due to the limited production, our products may not be able to meet the demand in the future. So, I think that from now on, we should consciously reduce the supply from some less well – known small channels. We should select a few representative channels to cooperate with. For example, Walmart’s Sam’s Club.”

Xia ruofei took a sip of water to moisten his throat. He continued,””In addition, our Drunken Eight Immortals will not be recruiting any distributors. Other than a few large super – Commercial channels, we will leave a portion of it for online direct sales. I suggest directly building a Skycat flagship store. This way, there will be no distributors to earn the difference in price. Moreover, the labor cost of an e – commerce store is very low. It will be quite convenient to send the goods directly from the factory.”

Ling Xiaotian nodded and said,”I think it’s possible!” If we don’t have an e – commerce flagship store, many potential users will be wasted. ”

He immediately made a decision and said,”Xiao Li, write down what RUO Fei said just now. You guys go and do it immediately!” I’ll leave the e – commerce to your sales department. If you don’t have enough people, I’ll send more!”

Li Jing was very excited and quickly said,””Thank you for your trust, Chairman. I’ll definitely run the e – commerce part well!”

Ling Xiaotian nodded his head and said a few words of encouragement.

Li Jing left excitedly as if he had been injected with chicken blood. Ling Xiaotian and Xia ruofei continued to drink tea and chat.

Ling Xiaotian was very emotional. He had never thought that his sudden idea of buying a winery with Xia ruofei would yield results so quickly.

Naturally, Ling Xiaotian had quickly estimated the profits that the winery could generate. Even if Ling Ji food and drinks was a big business, Ling Xiaotian couldn’t possibly be indifferent to a profit of more than 100 million a year.

Xia ruofei wanted to claim a portion of the winery’s profits in advance. Ling Xiaotian also knew that Xia ruofei’s farm was undergoing a large – scale construction project recently, so he agreed without hesitation.

Ling Xiaotian had even kindly offered to borrow some money from the lingji restaurant if they did not have enough funds. However, Xia ruofei did not want to trouble Ling Xiaotian too much, so he smiled and politely declined.

Xia ruofei sat in Ling Xiaotian’s office for a while. When it was almost time to get off work, he got up and left to find Ling Qingxue for dinner. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

This time, it was really just a simple meal because Ling Qingxue had to bring Lin Shengnan home after the meal and arrange a room for her.

Hence, Xia ruofei decided to bring Lin Shengnan along. They found a nearby restaurant with a good environment for dinner.

Xia ruofei watched as Ling Qingxue and Lin Shengnan’s car left. Then, he went back to the parking lot to find his Knight XV and drove back to Paradise Farm.

With Lin Shengnan by Ling Qingxue’s side to protect her, Xia ruofei felt much more at ease.

In the next few days, the comrades that Lei Hu and the others had contacted arrived at the farm one after another. There were a total of 18 people. Xia ruofei did a simple inspection and found that they were all good soldiers. Even if they were not from the Special Forces, their discipline and obedience were far better than those who had no military experience.

As such, Xia ruofei did as he had promised and hired all of them.

All the Veterans were assigned to the dormitories in the complex building. The 18 of them were divided into three groups. Among the first four veterans, Xia ruofei assigned Hong Tao, Xu Wei, and Qin Xiaojun to be in charge of one group each.

As for Lei Hu, he would temporarily be in charge of managing all the security personnel. He was equivalent to the Vice – Director and Acting Director of the security.

The position of the supervisor was naturally reserved for ye Lingyun.

With the current scale of the farm, there was no need for so many security personnel. The Veterans were not idle either. Some of them took the initiative to help out in the vegetable greenhouses, while others went to the construction site to maintain order and manage the vehicles entering and leaving.

A few days later, Xia ruofei was preparing to go on a long trip to see if the wild Dendrobium candids he had harvested in his interspace had been dealt with yet. There was nothing important to do during this period of time, so he decided to make a trip to Qiantang city, Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province.

[I’m sorry. Due to steel Spear’s own carelessness, the first two chapters were numbered wrongly. Chapter 425 is actually Chapter 424, Chapter 426 is actually Chapter 425, and this chapter is actually Chapter 426. The author has no authority to change the title of the chapter, so steel spear has already contacted the editor – in – charge to help change it. [Of course, it’s just the wrong chapter number. The content isn’t missing, so it doesn’t affect the continuity of reading.]
