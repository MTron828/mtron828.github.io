Chapter 1266: Chao Yin’s heart rises, and RUO Fei makes his move (2)

Translator: 549690339

Seeing that MA Xiong had stepped out to speak, Guo Hongjiang did not say anything else. He could understand Xia ruofei. After all, Xia ruofei had never come into contact with horse racing before. It was also his first time seeing such a cruel reality. It was normal for him to be unable to accept it.

However, Xia ruofei did not let MA Xiong’s words make him give up.

He looked at Guo Hongjiang and said seriously,””Director Guo, if there’s a way to cure the star of Hong Kong, and even let him return to the field, would you like to try?”

When Xia ruofei had stopped them, the veterinarians in Guo Hongjiang’s team were already unhappy that the “star of Hong Kong” had met with such a misfortune. They were already in a bad mood.

After MA Xiong’s explanation, Xia ruofei’s words were still unreliable. The vet who was about to euthanize the star of Hong Kong could not hold it in anymore.

He spoke in Mandarin with a heavy Cantonese accent,””Sir, if you don’t know anything about animal medicine, please don’t talk nonsense at this time!”

Xia ruofei did not get angry. Instead, he asked,””How can you be so sure that I’m just speaking without thinking?”

The vet snorted coldly and said,”you don’t even know the most basic common sense, and you’re still talking nonsense?” I advise you to go and look through the information! There had been countless cases of horse leg fractures in history, but there had not been a single case of recovery! There was no point in trying to save him in this situation! It will only increase the pain of the ‘star of Hong Kong’!”

The vet’s assistant also said in dissatisfaction,””We’ve been with the ‘star of Hong Kong’ for more than two years, and our feelings for him are deeper than anyone else ‘s. If there was another way, we wouldn’t have made this choice! Can you stop causing trouble for us at a time like this?”

Guo Hongjiang frowned and said,””Doctor Li, Cheng, stop talking! Mr. Xia is my guest!”

After he finished speaking, Guo Hongjiang turned to Xia ruofei and said,””Mr. Xia, I know you mean well, but ... There’s really no other way in this situation ... How about this? It’s getting late. For something like this to happen today, please forgive me for my negligence. You can go back with Chairman MA first! We’re going to euthanize the star of Hong Kong, I think ... In this situation, you should ...”

“Director Guo! I’m not being emotional. ” Xia ruofei said,”I know that there have been no cases of successful treatment in the past, but just because others can ‘t, it doesn’t mean that I can’ T. I still hope to try hard. Just treat it as giving the ‘star of Hong Kong’ a chance to live!”

Xia ruofei immediately added,”And I can promise you that I won’t bring any extra pain to the star of Hong Kong! If I really can’t help it, it’s not too late for you to euthanize it!”

Guo Hongjiang could not help but hesitate when he heard this.

On the other hand, MA Xiong’s heart skipped a beat as an idea flashed through his mind.

When the auction ended, MA Xiong even jokingly told Guo Hongjiang that if the horses had health problems, Xia ruofei might be able to help.

Now, he had a rather absurd idea: Xia ruofei’s medical skills were amazing. He might really have a way to save the “star of Hong Kong”.

If it was a highly skilled Western Doctor Who said those words, MA Xiong might not have believed it at all. However, Chinese medicine was different. Chinese medicine did not have such a clear division of domains like Western medicine. Who said that Chinese medicine could only save people and not horses?

Furthermore, Chinese medicine had always held a unique position when it came to dealing with injuries.

Although it was said that it would take a hundred days to recover from a serious injury, even if one went to see a Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner, those were all ordinary Chinese medicine practitioners. Xia ruofei’s medical skills were obviously not ordinary. He could even cure such a serious cerebral hemorrhage without any residual effects. Even the world’s medical field had not found an effective treatment for autism, but he had successfully cured it. Moreover, it was said that the special medicine for autism was about to be mass – produced. It didn’t seem impossible for such a magical doctor to cure a horse’s fracture in a short time.

These thoughts flashed through MA Xiong’s mind. He quickly said,””Chairman Guo, why don’t you let Xia Sheng try? He would never say something he wasn’t confident in. Since he took the initiative to suggest it, he must have thought of something ...”

Guo Hongjiang’s eyes widened as he looked at his old friend. He did not expect that even MA Xiong would accept such a ridiculous suggestion.

Xia ruofei looked at the ‘star of Hong Kong’ and then said to Guo Hongjiang,””Director Guo, I can’t bear to see such an excellent horse race being euthanized because of a fracture, so I decided to give it a try. Of course, the decision is yours. If you insist, I can leave now. ”

If Guo Hongjiang did not trust Xia ruofei at all, then Xia ruofei would definitely not be in a hurry to help him. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

To be honest, if Xia ruofei had not seen the “star of Hong Kong” with tears in his eyes, he would have just mentioned it. If Guo Hongjiang did not accept it, he would have left immediately.

When did the petals of the spirit Heart Flower become so cheap?

Guo Hongjiang finally made up his mind. He nodded and said,””Mr. Xia, I’m counting on you. I don’t dare to hope that the ‘star of Hong Kong’ can return to the competition. As long as its broken bones can be healed, it’ll be fine. If it really works, I’ll definitely reward you handsomely!”
