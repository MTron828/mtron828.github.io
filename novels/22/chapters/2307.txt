2308 One drink and one Peck_Ge Jun couldn’t believe his ears. After a while, he said in shock,”Mr. Xia...You ... You’re saying that you agree to take me in as a disciple and teach me the medical skills of the [three cloud contact volumes]?”

It was no wonder that Ge Jun had lost his self – Control. In many traditional industries, there was a concept of treasuring one’s own belongings. The Chinese medicine industry was the same. “Teaching disciples to starve the master” was not a joke. Many people would habitually leave a trump card when teaching their disciples or even their nephews and juniors.

This was also one of the main reasons why GE tribe’s medical skills were incomplete.

Therefore, even if it was confirmed that the “three volumes of cloud rubbing” was written by Ge Hong, Ge Jun did not dare to have high hopes of becoming a disciple. This was because Xia ruofei had undoubtedly mastered the lost traditional Chinese medicine. Why would he give it to him without reservation just because he was Ge Hong’s descendant? Furthermore, there was no way to verify the identity of Ge Hong’s descendant.

Hence, after hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Ge Jun was instantly overwhelmed with joy and even suspected that he was dreaming.

Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s not that I want to take you in as my disciple. I think ... It’s more appropriate for me to take you in on behalf of my master.”

Li Yifu, who was old enough to be his grandfather, already called him “senior granduncle”. Xia ruofei did not want to have another white – haired disciple.

After all, the world of cultivation was a bit special. Everyone’s lifespan was longer than ordinary people, and most of the time, it was based on strength. The reason was very simple. You were a 120 – year – old Foundation establishment cultivator, would you dare to put on airs in front of an 80 – year – old Yuanying cultivator?

However, this was obviously not the case in the Chinese medicine world.

Furthermore, Ge Jun was a renowned Chinese medical Master. If he were to acknowledge a young man in his twenties as his master, it would definitely cause an uproar. It would not be good for Ge Jun or Xia ruofei.

But at the same time, after the exchange just now, Xia ruofei had a good impression of Ge Jun. Moreover, the nine cloud contact needles that he had unintentionally used was a work of the GE Jun family’s ancestor. It was a good idea to return this inheritance to the GE family’s descendants.

There might be a destiny in this world.

As for Ge Jun’s worries, Xia ruofei did not have any of them. This was because the inheritance that was extremely precious to Ge Jun and other Chinese doctors was not that important to Xia ruofei.

If he taught it to Ge Jun, he could even promote Traditional Chinese Medicine, so why not?

Hearing this, Ge Jun could not react for a moment. After a while, he said,””Accepting a disciple on behalf of your master? This ... This isn’t appropriate, is it?”

Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”why is it inappropriate?” I think it’s quite suitable!”

Ge Jun said awkwardly,”Mr. Xia, we can basically confirm that your master is a member of the GE family. However, over the long years, the GE family has flourished and there are countless members. Now, we can’t even confirm your master’s name. This generation ...”

Ge Jun hesitated for a moment before saying,””Our GE tribe is good at maintaining our health, and most of our people have long lifespans. In addition, after so many generations of changes, your master’s seniority is likely to be much higher than mine. So ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Mr. GE, since we can’t be sure, why bother?” As you said, there are many branches in your GE clan. After so many years of development, it will inevitably lead to a huge gap in seniority. Then, my master might even be your junior in the clan! He’s taking advantage of me if I raise him!”

Of course, Xia ruofei was just joking. That Taoist GE was simply a fictional figure. There was no way to talk about the issue of seniority.

Xia ruofei saw that Ge Jun was still hesitating, so he said seriously,””Mr. GE, I’ve decided to accept you as my disciple because I respect your pursuit of Chinese medicine! As far as I know, my master has no descendants, and his medical skills were only passed down to me, this one disciple. What I can basically confirm is that I’m the only one who has mastered the exquisite Traditional Chinese Medicine inheritance of the GE family. Do you think ... Is it more important to continue the GE family’s Traditional Chinese Medicine legacy or the so – called seniority?”

Hearing this, Ge Jun’s expression immediately changed, as if he had been enlightened, and he said,””Mr. Xia, you’ve woken me up from a dream with your words! Since you’ve already said so much, it would be disloyal and unfilial of me to reject it ... I can only accept your good intentions with shame ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””That’s right! Then ... I’ll call you senior brother GE from now on!”

“Junior Brother!” Ge Jun said with a touched expression.

Of course, he also knew that Xia ruofei’s suggestion of taking in a disciple on behalf of his master was entirely for his own good.

Then, Ge Jun asked eagerly,””Junior Brother, may I know where master’s memorial tablet is? I have to go to his grave and kowtow to him!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. Fortunately, he reacted quickly and immediately said,””Master was a Daoist master who was like a wild crane and did not adhere to the secular etiquette at all. Before he died, he strictly ordered me not to set up a memorial tablet or worship it. He even ordered me to scatter his ashes into the river, which meant that dust to dust to dust ...”

“Ah?” Ge Jun was also stunned.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”senior brother, the most important thing in acknowledging a master is sincerity. Why do you have to be so formal?” Master will definitely see it in the Western Pure Land. Why don’t you ... Head west and kowtow to him three times!”
