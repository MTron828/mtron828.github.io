2621 A huge surprise (1)

With the Liu family’s coordination, the peach source didn’t have much to wait at the Beijing International Airport. The car was pushed out as soon as it was ready. Then, it taxied to the end of the runway and was granted permission to take off immediately.

The streamlined body of the plane glistened under the sun, and after a high – speed slide, it lightly leaped into the sky.

After a short climb, paradise soon entered a stable cruising altitude.

This cruising altitude was much higher than an ordinary passenger airliner. At the same time, the airflow at this altitude was the most stable, and there would basically be no major bumps.

The continuous flight of more than ten hours was very boring, so Xia ruofei took Liu An’s suggestion. After entering the cruising altitude, they returned to the compartment at the end of the cabin to rest.

Other than Xia ruofei’s personal room, which had a real soft bed, all the seats in the cabin could be laid flat and become a single bed.

Because the take – off was in the morning, Liu Kuan did not want to lie down and rest. Xia ruofei asked the random flight attendant to serve him and then went to the compartment at the end of the cabin.

When Xia ruofei was in the Army, he had learned a very good skill. Whenever he needed it, he could fall asleep very quickly, even if he had just woken up in the morning. This was also a skill that special combat soldiers had to master. After all, the battlefield environment was very harsh, and the time to rest was generally not very long. If one could not sleep as soon as their head touched the ground, they basically would not get effective rest.

Even now, he could still fall asleep within three minutes of lying down.

Xia ruofei sat on the bed and browsed the news on his phone for a while. The WiFi speed on the plane was quite good, and it was easy to open the picture and text web page.

After watching the news for a while, Xia ruofei threw his phone in the drawer by the bed and fell asleep.

It was not until noon that the gentle wake – up bell at the head of the bed woke him up. It was the flight attendant who had asked him to get up for lunch.

Xia ruofei got up from his bed and went to his personal bathroom at the end of the cabin to wash his face. Then, he pushed the door open and walked out.

“Mr. Xia!” Liu Kuan stood up and greeted him.

“Uncle Liu, you didn’t rest?” Xia ruofei asked, chuckling.

At first, Xia ruofei wanted to call Liu Kuan “uncle Kuan” like Liu Qunfeng did. Later, considering that Liu Kuan was old enough to be his grandfather, he changed it to “uncle Liu.”

“I’m old,” Liu Kuan said.”I don’t sleep much, and I really can’t fall asleep in the morning.”

Xia ruofei nodded and asked,”uncle Liu, are you tired?” Why don’t you take a break after dinner? I’ll just take a nap. ”

“Your paradise is very comfortable,” Liu Kuan said with a smile.”You won’t feel tired even if you fly for a long time.”

At this moment, the flight attendant came over with a tray and served a sumptuous lunch for the two of them.

In fact, at an altitude of 10000 meters, people’s taste bud cells would become a little slow, and their appetite would also decrease. However, facing the lunch carefully prepared by the flight attendant, the two still ate a lot.

As the flight attendant was clearing the plates, Xia ruofei casually asked,””How long have we been flying?”

The flight attendant bowed slightly.”Mr. Xia, we’ve been flying for about five hours. According to the plan, the plane will land in Brian, Australia, for refueling in about four hours.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”okay, pack up and eat quickly!” It’s been hard on everyone this time. ”

“Thank you, Mr. Xia!” The flight attendant said. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

After the meal, Xia ruofei did not return to her room immediately. Instead, she sat in the middle of the cabin and chatted with Liu Kuan.

At this altitude, the scenery outside the porthole remained unchanged. Additionally, the airplane was very stable. Sometimes, Zhang tie even felt that the airplane was still. Although the comfort level of a private jet was extremely high, it was very boring to sit in it for a long time.

So, after sitting for a while, Xia ruofei returned to his room at the end of the cabin to rest. As for Liu Kuan, he didn’t seem to be sleepy at all. After Xia ruofei went back to her room, he found a movie and watched it with great interest.

When Xia ruofei woke up again, it was already dark outside the porthole and he could not see anything.

It would take about ten hours to fly from Beijing to Brian at the speed of the peach source. It took off from Beijing at about 8:30 in the morning. Taking into account the time difference, it should be around 9 or 10 O’ clock in the evening.

The plane had already begun to slowly descend and was about to land in Brian.

This was the reason why the flight attendant had woken Xia ruofei up.

Xia ruofei walked out of the room, sat down, and fastened his seat belt.

About half an hour later, the plane landed smoothly at the airport and was led to a private plane by a guide car. The ground crew was already ready. After the plane stopped and the car closed, someone immediately came to refuel the plane.

The plane wouldn’t stay in Bolton for long. It would take off after a short rest after refueling. Hence, even though Xia ruofei’s Australian visa had not expired, he did not enter the country in rainboas. He only followed Captain Liu An down to the plane for a round of inspection and to get some fresh air.

Soon, the plane took off again after refueling and lightly jumped into the night sky of Bolton.

There were about five hours left on the flight. Xia ruofei did not return to the room at the tail of the cabin. Instead, she sat down and chatted with Liu Kuan.

The plane flew steadily in the night sky. Below them was the vast and boundless South Pacific Ocean. Looking out through the porthole, it was pitch – Black everywhere. Nothing could be seen.

Xia ruofei was very confident in the Gulfstream G650’s performance and the professional abilities of the two pilots. Of course, even if there was a small probability of an accident, Xia ruofei had enough reaction speed to hide in the spirit map space.

As time passed, the cabin, which had been professionally soundproofed, was very quiet. The sound of the engine could not even be heard clearly.

Finally, when the sky outside the porthole began to brighten, Captain Liu An’s slightly tired voice came from the cabin broadcast,””Mr. Xia, we’re about to arrive at green cloud Island. Today’s weather is good. From this altitude, we can already see the airport runway of green cloud Island, which is on the right front of the plane. Please fasten your seat belts and try not to walk around in the cabin during the landing. ”

When Xia ruofei heard that they had finally arrived at cyan Cloud Island, he couldn’t help but feel excited. It was indeed uncomfortable to be on a plane for such a long time. Even if Xia ruofei’s physical strength was far beyond that of ordinary people, mental fatigue was inevitable.

He looked ahead through the right porthole of the plane.

The plane had descended by a lot. Xia ruofei’s eyesight was much better than the average person ‘s, so he saw the island that was embedded in the blue sea like an Emerald at first glance.

In fact, there were many other islands of different sizes scattered around the island, some close and some far away.

However, there was a 3000 – meter long runway on green cloud Island. In order to build this runway, the Liu family had specially filled the sea and “dug” out such a runway. Therefore, about one – fifth of the runway extended into the sea, which was very conspicuous from the sky.

After flying for more than ten hours, it was morning when they arrived. The sun shone on the sea and the scenery was magnificent. In addition, the plane was turning right and entering the five sides. Green cloud Island was just on the side of the plane, so Xia ruofei was very interested in admiring it through the porthole.

As the plane continued to turn, Xia ruofei’s view of Qingyun Island and the surrounding islands also slowly changed.

At a certain angle, Xia ruofei’s eyes could not help but narrow. There was a flash of surprise in his eyes.

From that angle, Xia ruofei realized that the position of cyan Cloud Island and the surrounding islands were actually in harmony with the great Dao of heaven and earth. If the cyan Cloud Island and the islands around it were seen as a whole, they would have an amazing sense of beauty.

Almost in an instant, Xia ruofei could confirm that this green cloud Island was actually a natural formation. No wonder he felt that the green cloud Island was full of vitality at first sight. It seemed to be a paradise.

Xia ruofei’s training these years was not in vain. His ability to maintain his composure had improved a lot since he had just left the Army. Therefore, he didn’t show any surprise. After all, Liu Kuan was sitting next to him. If he showed his surprise or ecstasy, Liu Kuan would definitely notice.

At that time, the Liu family would probably change their mind.

The uniqueness of cyan Cloud Island was most obvious at that angle. After the plane continued to turn, Xia ruofei looked over again and found that the breathtaking feeling had disappeared. He could not help but be amazed.

...

Soon, the plane turned five times, facing the direction of the runway. At this time, green cloud Island was directly in front of the plane, and it could no longer be seen through the side porthole.

Xia ruofei resisted the urge to go to the cockpit to observe the island from the sky. He sat in his seat patiently and waited for Yingying to remind him that he must not show any signs of abnormality, or else he might fail at the last step.

After realizing that the cyan Cloud Island was a natural formation, Xia ruofei did not hesitate for even a second. He secretly made up his mind to get the cyan Cloud Island into the Suan ni, a spiritual Island with the potential to become a paradise. It would be a waste if it fell into the hands of the Liu family.

Of course, Xia ruofei also knew that at times like this, he had to be calm. Any abnormal behavior would be noticed by the smart Liu Kuan and secretly recorded.

Therefore, he didn’t go to the cockpit. Instead, he sat quietly in his seat and waited for the plane to land.
