Chapter 496: Chapter 404 – hidden skill and fame (2)

His thoughts were finally clear!

Xia ruofei stopped thinking about recalling the Hornet. He stood up silently and quickly disappeared into the night, leaving no trace behind.

At this time, the villa was already in a mess.

After these “uninvited guests” were eliminated by the bubble trick that the middle – aged man came up with, they immediately started to treat Liang Haiming.

There were also people who quickly contacted everyone at the resort. The first thought that came to their minds was that there was a loophole in the management of the resort. Otherwise, why would such a terrifying Hornet suddenly enter the villa?

Of course, the middle – aged man didn’t have time to criticize the resort. He immediately called the emergency number and asked someone to prepare a car to send Liang Haiming to the hospital.

The situation was so urgent that they didn’t dare to wait for the ambulance to arrive. They could only send Liang Haiming out immediately and meet the ambulance on the road.

Speaking of which, Liang Haiming was destined to die Here.

After being stung by the Hornet, one should be sent to the hospital immediately. However, the resort was far from the city. The nearest hospital was more than 30 kilometers away. The resort’s Infirmary simply could not treat such a serious injury.

Moreover, Liang Haiming’s body was allergic to bee poison.

On the way to the hospital, his blood pressure had dropped drastically. By the time he met up with the ambulance, he was already dead.

The doctor in the ambulance routinely checked Liang Haiming’s condition, then shook his head helplessly and said,””The patient is dead ...”

After hearing this, the middle – aged man felt as if he had been struck by lightning and almost fainted on the spot.

He didn’t know how to face the Liang family.

He had accompanied Liang Haiming to the southeast province to handle some matters, but he had to watch Liang Haiming die for no reason while he was helpless. How was he going to face the Liang family’s monstrous anger ...

The middle – aged man felt despair. This incident was too sudden. If Liang Haiming had an accident during a conflict with someone, at least there would be someone to vent the Liang family’s anger on. But now?

Was he going to settle scores with the Hornet?

The middle – aged man knew that he had to find someone to take responsibility, or he would be in a very passive position.

Who should bear this responsibility? The middle – aged man did not hesitate and naturally thought of the resort.

In his opinion, this was the responsibility of the resort.

The holiday resort was responsible for the deaths of their guests who were attacked by Hornet during their stay!

After coming up with a plan, the middle – aged man’s mood stabilized a little.

Although the doctor had already announced Liang Haiming’s death, he still insisted on giving him first aid and even sent someone to follow the ambulance to the hospital.

He returned to the resort to check on Liang Haiming’s death. There was no point in going to the hospital. It was more important to go back to the resort to deal with his funeral.

The entire villa was alarmed by such a big incident.

When the middle – aged man returned, the villa manager had already been beaten black and blue by the few guards who stayed behind. He was crying for his parents.

The middle – aged man was not in the mood to talk to him anymore. Anyway, the responsibility had to be pushed to the villa.

He didn’t dare to delay and immediately called back to Beijing to report.

There was no such thing as an impervious wall in the world. The news of the Liang family’s young master’s accidental death in the southeast province quickly spread in the capital.

Many children of the aristocratic families were clapping their hands and criticizing Liang Haiming’s domineering character. Even among the rich and powerful in the circle, there were only a few who had a good relationship with him.

As for the victims, they didn’t have any channels to get the news at the first moment. Otherwise, they would have cried out that the heavens had eyes.

However, no matter what, Xia ruofei’s revenge had comforted the innocent souls of several young girls.

The entire Liang family was shocked!

The family quickly sent people to the southeast province to take care of Liang Haiming’s funeral.

As for the conflict between Liang Haiming and Xia ruofei, the middle – aged man didn’t mention it at all in order to avoid unnecessary trouble.

The Liang family did not expect that what looked like an accident on the surface was actually a planned assassination. Hence, Xia ruofei was able to stay out of it as he wished.

The unlucky Green Bull Mountain Resort was completely subjected to the Liang family’s anger. The business that was barely managed quickly closed down, and the boss suffered all kinds of blows. In the end, he was arrested by the Gannan province police for false charges and was finally sentenced to a few years in prison. It could be said that he had suffered an undeserved disaster.

Although objectively speaking, he didn’t have any responsibility, the middle – aged man was still driven out by the Liang family because he didn’t take good care of him. Moreover, he had offended a big family like the Liang family, so the middle – aged man couldn’t stand in the country at all.

Fortunately, he had a lot of savings over the years. He was also disheartened by the cold – hearted Liang family, so he simply went abroad and spent the rest of his life in peace.

Of course, this was all a story for later.

After confirming that he had achieved his goal tonight, Xia ruofei left the scene quickly under the cover of the night.

He returned to the pickup truck, started the car without hesitation, and drove away from the green Bull Mountain Resort.

Xia ruofei still chose to take a detour. He took a few old roads with few people and cars and returned to Taoyuan farm.

Along the way, Xia ruofei had been keeping an eye on Ling Qingxue in the space.

Ling Qingxue had been unconscious the whole time, so Xia ruofei let her lie on the stone bed. When they returned to the villa and went to his bedroom, Xia ruofei sent Ling Qingxue out of the spirit map space.

Xia ruofei gently placed Ling Qingxue on the bed.

Then, he took out a bottle of diluted spirit Heart Flower petal solution and carefully fed some to Ling Qingxue.

The flower petal solution, which was extremely effective even for malignant tumors, would naturally be able to cure the side effects of the knockout powder.

Ling Qingxue, who had taken the petal solution, quickly frowned and woke up with a groan.

When she found herself lying on the bed, the first thing she thought of was what had happened to her at the entrance of the company building. She couldn’t help but scream.

Xia ruofei quickly covered Ling Qingxue’s mouth and whispered in her ear,””Qingxue, don’t be afraid! It’s me ... It’s alright, it’s alright ...”

When Ling Qingxue heard Xia ruofei’s voice, her frightened heart calmed down. She hugged Xia ruofei, her body trembling slightly as she sobbed.””Ruofei, I’m so scared ... I thought ... I thought I would never see you again ...”

Xia ruofei saw the frightened look on the woman he loved and felt an endless amount of pity for her. At the same time, his hatred and disgust for Liang Haiming and the others increased. The discomfort he felt from ending the lives of five people tonight disappeared without a trace.

“Qingxue, be good. Don’t be afraid ...” Xia ruofei said softly.”With me by your side, no one can hurt you ...”

Ling Qingxue nodded. She felt that Xia ruofei’s embrace was so warm. Xia ruofei’s chest was so broad that she felt a strong attachment and an endless sense of security.

Ling Qingxue hugged Xia ruofei tightly and asked,””RUO Fei, you ... You weren’t injured when you saved me, right?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Qingxue, you’re underestimating me!” I just took care of a few thieves, how could I be injured?”

After he finished speaking, Xia ruofei even made a gesture to show off his muscles, which made Ling Qingxue smile through her tears.

Ling Qingxue then asked,”Oh right, who were those people today?” Why did they kidnap me? They ... They were doing it for money? This is bad! Ruofei, will they harm my father ...”

Ling Qingxue thought that if the kidnappers were after money, then it was very likely that they would also kidnap her father, Ling Xiaotian. She suddenly panicked.

Xia ruofei quickly patted Ling Qingxue’s back and comforted her.””Qingxue, don’t worry. Uncle Ling is fine ...”

Then, Xia ruofei said seriously,””Tonight’s incident is very complicated, and I can’t explain it clearly in a short time, but there’s one thing you must remember. I’ve completely resolved this matter, but you must keep it a secret and pretend that nothing happened. Otherwise, it may bring disaster to me and your Ling Ji restaurant! Remember this!”CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
