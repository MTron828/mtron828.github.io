“This is unbelievable!” The fitness coach said excitedly,”Mr. Xia’s physical condition is quite good! He can even persist in playing the entire game!”

Ruby couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows and asked,””Is this true?”

“Of course! I swear on God’s name!” The fitness coach said with confidence,”it’s no exaggeration to say that Mr. Xia’s physical condition is better than many of the main players on the team! This is his physical data, you can take a look for yourself!”

Ruby grabbed the physical fitness data sheet from the fitness coach’s hand and looked at it eagerly.

After scanning through a few key data, Ruby couldn’t help but Mutter to himself,”This is simply too shocking! If I didn’t believe in your professionalism, I would even suspect that you took the wrong data sheet and brought Naldo’s physical data!”

The fitness coach said with some embarrassment,””I also can’t believe that the data is real. I even suspect that our testing equipment has malfunctioned, so ... I tested it again on the equipment just now to confirm that there is no problem with the data! And ... My physical condition is much worse than Mr. Xia ‘s!”

Ruby chuckled and said,”I must praise your strictness!” It seems like Mr. Xia’s overall condition has far exceeded my expectations ...”

Ruby turned his eyes to the training ground, and many thoughts came to his mind.

Xia ruofei’s physical fitness was no longer his weakness. Besides his precise free kick, his basic abilities such as ball control, passing, and shooting were all on point.

In that case, Ruby would be able to deploy his team easily in the match against Valencia the day after tomorrow.

……

Xia ruofei easily completed the day’s training. In the afternoon, Ruby specially arranged for him to train in corner kicks and free kicks. Of course, there were also some psychological tests in it.

Xia ruofei’s performance made Ruby completely relieved. Xuxu’s free kick was still frighteningly stable. During the corner kick, his control of the drop point was also in place. Xia ruofei even played a trick and spun the ball directly into the goal during the corner kick. The arc was quite strange. Even the experienced old goalkeeper, Diego Lopez, who was called “brother octopus” by the fans, lost his balance and watched the football spin into the goal.

Ruby was both surprised and happy. This was really a 360 – degree blind spot! As long as he was within 33 meters of the opponent’s goal, Xia ruofei had the ability to kick the ball into the goal no matter the angle, even in the corner flag area.

At that moment, Ruby had made up his mind. As long as Xia ruofei was on the field, he would be the main player for free kicks, corner kicks, and even penalty kicks. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

After a day of training, Ruby gathered everyone and announced the team list for the away game against Valencia the day after tomorrow.

Xia ruofei and Wu Lei were selected without a doubt. At the same time, the team’s main center, iglasias, the main goalkeeper, Diego Lopez, the main midfielders, mark Roca, Darder, and so on were also selected. These were all the main players. It was no surprise that they would be on the main list and even the starting list.

Other than that, Metatron, puador, and the others were also on the list. This result made puador’s heart finally relax. He thought that Xia ruofei’s arrival would further reduce his space and that he might not be on the list for the next match.

Ruby didn’t announce the starting lineup today. He wanted to keep the suspense until tomorrow or the day after. Of course, this was also because he hadn’t completely thought about how to arrange the starting lineup.

The players who were not included in the squad list would stay in Barcelona for the next two days to continue their daily training, while the players on the squad list would fly to Valencia the next day.

After they returned to the hotel, Xia ruofei guided Wu Lei to practice the first set of movements for the Golden Man.

After a few days of practice, Wu Lei had basically mastered the essentials of the movements. Sometimes, there would be one or two small deviations. Xia ruofei would simply correct them and he would be able to quickly enter the state of practice.

Of course, every practice was a hellish experience. Wu Lei gritted his teeth and persevered.

In just a few days, his appearance didn’t seem to have changed much, but in fact, his physical fitness had improved a lot, and his ability to resist had also increased.

As he had to board a plane the next day, Wu Lei left Xia ruofei’s room immediately after he finished his training. He went back to rest early.

……

The next morning, Xia ruofei and Wu Lei changed into the sportswear of the Spanish club and took the business car sent by the club to the Dani Halk training ground.

The two of them met up with their other teammates there and then took the bus to the airport.

Espanyol was playing in an away game, and many sports media and fans went to the airport to see them off.

Xia ruofei saw the situation and put on his sunglasses and mask before he got out of the car.

In addition to the players on the squad list, the coaching team and staff were also going to Valencia. Everyone was wearing the Spanish team’s sportswear, so Xia ruofei did not stand out in the crowd.

Although the media managed to capture him, he was wrapped up so tightly that no one could recognize him.
