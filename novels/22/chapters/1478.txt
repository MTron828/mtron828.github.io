Translator: 549690339

When chief Wang and the others saw Xia ruofei walking over, a glimmer of hope rose in their hearts and they quickly walked over to welcome him.

“Master ... Master Xia!” Chief Wang said impatiently. I was blind before and accidentally offended you. Please forgive me ...”

“Mr. Xia, today’s incident was all a misunderstanding. We had eyes but failed to recognize Mount Tai. Please don’t take it to heart ...”

“Xia ...”

Xia ruofei frowned as the four of them came up to him and explained.

When they saw Xia ruofei’s unhappy expression, the four of them shut their mouths and looked at Xia ruofei uneasily.

Xia ruofei looked at director Jiang and chief Wang and said coldly,””I’ll return the money for tonight’s meal to Xu Yuanyuan. ”

“Yes, yes, yes!” Director Jiang and director Wang responded.

Even if Xia ruofei did not say anything, they would have done it anyway. The dinner tonight was not going to be good!

“Go!” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

“Then ... Young master Xia, what about director Cao ...” Director Jiang asked carefully.

Xia ruofei looked at him and asked calmly,””Do you mean I should praise you in front of Cao Jin?”

“I wouldn’t dare ...” Director Jiang smiled.

Xia ruofei said impatiently,””I don’t have the time to send Cao in to mess with you ...”

Director Jiang and director Wang were relieved. Although Cao Jin would inevitably have a bad impression of them, it was better than deliberately targeting them in the future.

With the influence of Cao Jin’s position, he didn’t even need to do anything. As long as he gave a slight hint at the right time, their official careers might suffer a heavy blow.

If the force was stronger, people like director Jiang and bureau chief Wang wouldn’t be able to stand the investigation at all. They might even be thrown into jail in a few minutes.

Xia ruofei said,”I’ll give you two a piece of advice. Whether you are an official or a person, it’s best to have a bottom line. If you walk by the river often, your shoes will definitely get wet!”

Director Jiang and bureau chief Wang felt that their backs were drenched in cold sweat. Xia ruofei’s simple words had frightened them. They probably had a guilty conscience.

“Yes, yes, yes!” Director Jiang quickly said,”we will definitely remember young master Xia’s instructions. We will be honest people and be officials with a clean record!”

“Thank you for your teachings, young master Xia!” Chief Wang said.

“Go!” Xia ruofei said.

“Then we’ll take our leave!”

“Thank you, master Xia!”

Director Jiang and director Wang left the hotel as if they were escaping. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Xia ruofei looked at the two of them as they left. He knew that they were probably not clean, but he did not have the time to care. He was not a Savior. Besides, there were no fish in the clear water. No matter how capable song Zhengping was, he could not guarantee that there would not be a single pest in the entire provincial cadre.

After the two leaders left, Zhuang Cheng and Yao na were still standing there, trembling in fear.

Xia ruofei was still the same Xia ruofei. However, before Cao Jin appeared, Yao na felt that he was just a country bumpkin who had never seen the world. Now, Xia ruofei was still so calm, but Yao na and Zhuang Cheng felt an invisible pressure in front of him. They felt that he was very powerful.

“Young ... Young master Xia!” Yao na called out nervously.

Xia ruofei glanced at her and asked,””What is it?”

Compared to director Jiang and bureau chief Wang, Xia ruofei hated Yao na more.

At most, the two of them would just take the benefits and not do anything. They would also put on airs. However, Yao na was a little worse. If you didn’t want to help, then don’t agree. After agreeing, there was no sincerity at all. She was just fooling Xu Yuanyuan and her words were so unpleasant.

As for Zhuang Cheng, he wasn’t a good person either. He had even threatened Xia ruofei just now. He had the aura of a Bandit. No one knew how such a person had gotten into the system.

“Young master Xia, we just ...” Yao na said in fear.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and asked,””If I didn’t know Cao Jin, you wouldn’t have asked me to leave tan Zhou in one piece, right?”

“I wouldn’t dare, I wouldn’t dare ... Those were just words of anger said in a moment of confusion ...” Zhuang Cheng said submissively.

“Young master Xia, we failed to recognize Mount Tai. You’re an important figure in the upper class, so please don’t stoop to our level.” Yao na said pitifully.

Looking at Yao NA’s coquettish behavior, Xia ruofei felt even more disgusted. At the same time, he felt dispirited. Why did he have to stoop to the level of such a small fry?

He waved his hand and said,”alright!” You guys should leave too!”

“Then ... Then we ...”

Yao na still wanted to try to ease the tension between them, but she was interrupted by Zhuang Cheng’s gentle tug on her clothes.

It was already a blessing that Xia ruofei did not pursue the matter. What else did he want? As for the bad impression that chief Jiang had of them because of this incident, it was already irreversible. How could they expect Xia ruofei to help them?

“Young master Xia, I’m sorry again!” Zhuang Cheng quickly said. Then ... We’ll take our leave too ...”

Then, Zhuang Cheng pulled Yao na along and the two of them walked towards the door in a daze.

“If I find out that Yuan Yuan Xu has been wronged at home, you know the consequences!” Xia ruofei said loudly.

Zhuang Cheng and Yao na trembled slightly and quickly turned around,”I don’t dare! Yuanyuan is also our family. We’ll get along well as a family from now on!”
