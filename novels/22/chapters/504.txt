Chapter 505: The interest_1

Lei Hu could not help but scratch his head.”Brother Xia, I’m not familiar with this. During the joint exercise, our task was to defend the front Command center and follow the command center’s movements. The Marine Corps seemed to be assigned to the landing group, so we didn’t have much opportunity to come into contact with them.”

“Brother Xia, the female soldiers in the Marine Corps are all very tough. Why are you asking about them?” Lei Hu asked.

Xia ruofei did not hide anything from Lei Hu and said,””After that incident a few days ago, I’ve been considering getting your sister – in – Law a bodyguard. I don’t trust ordinary people, but those from the Army are more reliable!”

“I see ... Then I really can’t help you with anything!” Lei Hu laughed.

Xia ruofei smiled and patted Lei Hu’s shoulder.””It’s fine, I’ll think of a way myself! You can go back to your work! Don’t forget to contact your old comrades!”

“Alright! Brother Xia, I’ll be leaving first!”

After Lei Hu left, Xia ruofei thought for a while and felt that he should look for his old leader.

So he directly took out his mobile phone, found the lone wolf assault team captain Guo Zhan’s phone number and dialed it.

“Blood Wolf! How come you have time to call me?” Guo Zhan’s loud voice came from the phone,”I heard that you’ve become a big Boss!” There’s one thing you’ve done well. You didn’t forget to take care of your comrades even after you’ve struck it rich. As expected of our lone Wolf’s soldiers!”

Guo Zhan’s words made Xia ruofei feel a little ashamed. It turned out that this old leader was very familiar with the matters on his side! However, she had barely contacted him after she retired. The only time she had called him was when she had just obtained the spirit painting scroll. She had run into trouble in Lin Qiao’s village and had no choice but to call.

“Wolf King, how has our team been recently? You should be very busy, right?” Xia ruofei asked, a little embarrassed.

He could hear some noise on the other end of the phone. Guo Zhan was most likely on the training ground!

Guo Zhan laughed heartily,”when can we, soldiers, be idle?” There’s a new batch of rookies in the team, and I’m drilling them!”

Then, Xia ruofei heard Guo Zhan’s roar from the phone,””Didn’t you guys eat? Accelerate, accelerate! It’s only ten kilometers and it’s already like this! You’re not even as good as a woman ...”

When Xia ruofei heard the familiar scolding, he felt as if he had returned to the time when he had just joined the lone wolf assault team. At that time, Guo Zhan was like a Demon King in the eyes of the new members, torturing them in all kinds of ways.

It was really bitter back then! His comrades were eliminated one by one. Xia ruofei felt that he couldn’t hold on any longer, but he persevered.

Now that he thought about it, all the suffering he had suffered in the past had become beautiful memories.

It was still the same training ground, and the scene was still full of enthusiasm. However, the trainees had changed one after another. Now, some of the people who joined the team with Xia ruofei had been promoted to officers, some had retired and returned to their hometowns, and some had died in the southern border of their motherland ...

“Blood Wolf, if you have something to say, just say it! I’m busy!” Guo Zhan said on the other end of the phone.

Guo Zhan’s voice woke Xia ruofei up from his memories. He rubbed his wet eyes and said,””Wolf King, you know a lot of people in the Army. I want to find a female bodyguard. Can you help me contact the Marine Corps? Ask them if they have any suitable retired female soldiers. ”

“What are you doing, kid?” Guo Zhan laughed and scolded. Don’t learn the good and learn the bad! Do you need a bodyguard with your skills? And why do you need a female bodyguard ...”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and explained,”Captain, I didn’t find it for myself!” I’m a little worried about my girlfriend’s safety, so I’m going to find her a bodyguard. ” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Woof! You already have a girlfriend! His movements were quite fast! Alright then! He had to settle his sister-in-law’s matter well! I’ll call my comrades in the Army Brigade and ask. ” Guo Zhan readily agreed.

“Thank you, Wolf King!” Xia ruofei said,”Oh right, it’s best if you have some basic computer skills and know how to use office software. You can be my girlfriend’s assistant.”

“No problem!” Guo Zhan said,”the military education level these days is pretty good. Your requirements aren’t high, but there should be many who meet the requirements!”

“Then I’ll have to trouble you!” Xia ruofei said,”Captain, if you’re free, come to the southeast for a walk. I’ll treat you well!”

“You don’t say. I might have to go to the southeast province in two months.” Guo Zhan said,”but it’s not a vacation. If I can find some time, I’ll go and visit you!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said happily,”remember to give me a call in advance!”

He was from the lone wolf assault team and knew the rules, so he didn’t ask Guo Zhan why he came to the southeast province. In fact, he knew that the lone wolf was definitely not a small task. If there was a plan one or two months in advance, it was most likely a large – scale training exercise or something.

After the call with Guo Zhan, Xia ruofei quickly went upstairs to his room and continued to practice drawing the core rune.

In the afternoon, Xia ruofei used up all the remaining white jade slips and successfully mastered the three independent runes. He was getting closer to mastering all 17 runes.

When Xia ruofei walked out of the room, the sky was already dark, so he had no intention of continuing his practice tonight. He had already used up all the White jade and he could not possibly go to the city to buy it overnight. Moreover, he knew that haste would not bring success. Even if he successfully carved out the core of the spiritual puppet, he would not be able to create the spiritual puppet before he had the complete manufacturing method.
