Chapter 1608: In a hurry (2)

Translator: 549690339

Hearing this, Ling Qingxue’s dejected mood eased a little. She raised her head and asked,””Really? When are you moving?”

Xia ruofei replied,”it should be soon!” The interior decoration is basically completed. The next step is to carry out an environmental inspection. If there are no problems, we should start moving. I won’t care about the specific things here, the people below will arrange it!”

“En!” Ling Qingxue nodded and said,”it’s good to move out. Although the environment at the farm is pleasant, it’s too far away. It’s good to go there for a vacation once in a while, but it’s a little inconvenient to live there for a long time.”

“Yup!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”the company’s business needs this as well. As the company expands, we can’t always set the company’s headquarters on a farm! This is related to our corporate image ...”

Then, Xia ruofei added,”by the way, I might need to buy a house in the city. It’s best if it’s a detached villa. Help me look for information in this area when you have time. It’ll be even better if there’s a suitable villa in your neighborhood. We can live closer ...”

Ling Qingxue’s heart was filled with sweetness when she heard that. She began to imagine the scene of the two of them living in the same villa community.

“Don’t worry!”She nodded. Leave the matter of finding a house to me! You can go to the capital without worry! The matter over there is more important!”

Xia ruofei lowered his head and kissed Ling Qingxue’s tender red lips. He smiled and said,””Wife, you’re my strong backing!”

“Glib tongue ...” Ling Qingxue pouted and glanced at Xia ruofei.

She immediately felt that Xia ruofei’s hands under the blanket were getting naughty again and couldn’t help but exclaim.

Soon, a Symphony of birds and phoenixes began to play in the warm room ...

……

When Xia ruofei left the Ling family villa, it was already past eight in the evening.

In the afternoon, the two of them fooled around in Ling Qingxue’s boudoir. It was only when it was almost 5:30 that the two of them got up and took a couple’s bath. Then, they changed and went downstairs.

If it wasn’t for the fact that Ling Xiaotian was about to get off work and return home, he might have accidentally fired a gun in the bathroom ...

While Ling Qingxue felt the warmth and sweetness, she couldn’t help but feel that she couldn’t take it anymore. Xia ruofei was getting more and more aggressive in that aspect, and Ling Qingxue felt more and more powerless.

After the two of them went downstairs, they deliberately sat in the courtyard and chatted for a while. Very soon, Ling Xiaotian returned home.

Although the two of them were neatly dressed and looked respectful to each other, Ling Xiaotian, as someone who had been through this, could guess what they had done in the afternoon from his daughter’s blushing face and her teary eyes.

While Ling Xiaotian felt an instinctive sourness in his heart, he also felt a burst of relief.

Xia ruofei was becoming more and more capable, and so was his business. Ling Xiaotian could not be any more satisfied with this son – in – Law. The two of them were so loving, and he was naturally happy from the bottom of his heart.

Hence, he personally made dinner and asked Xia ruofei to have a few drinks.

After returning to the farm, Xia ruofei had just finished washing up and was about to go to bed to browse the news and WeChat when he received a call from Song Wei.

“RUO Fei, I didn’t disturb your rest, did I?” Song Wei asked.

“I haven’t slept yet!” Xia ruofei chuckled and asked,”what’s the matter?”

“I was going to look for you at the farm, but ... Something came up at school. I have to go back to the capital early. I have to leave tomorrow ...” Song Wei said, a little depressed.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”It’s okay. There’s no rush to cultivate. You can cultivate it when you’re alone, but you must remember not to be impatient. Although the effect of cultivating the ‘Taichu Heart Sutra’ is not obvious, it’s better than nothing!”

“I know ...” Song Wei’s voice still sounded a little disappointed.

Seeing this, Xia ruofei laughed and said,””I forgot to tell you that I’ll be going to Beijing in the next two days. We can find time to cultivate.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Song Wei was stunned for a moment before she asked in surprise,””Really?”

“Yup! “I have something to deal with over there. If I don’t go over now, song Rui is going to flip out at me ...” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”so, if you don’t return to the capital earlier, we won’t be able to get our time together!” Isn’t it perfect now?”

“That’s great!” Song Wei cheered like a little girl. The disappointment from returning to school early was swept away.

Then, she impatiently asked,””When are you going to the capital?”

“In a day or two!” Xia ruofei said,”the exact time hasn’t been decided yet. I have some work to arrange. I don’t know how long I’ll be back this time!”

The group of bad friends were all in the capital, so Xia ruofei naturally could not be in a hurry.

Furthermore, since he was in the capital, Xia ruofei had to visit his elders like elder song and general Zhao Cheng.

In addition to that, Xia ruofei reckoned that it would be impossible for him to return quickly.

“Why don’t we ... Just take the same flight?” Song Wei suggested. I’ll be taking a flight at around 4 pm tomorrow, and I’ll be in Beijing for dinner!”

Xia ruofei could hear the anticipation in Song Wei’s voice. He thought for a while and said,””Alright! I’ll quickly arrange my work tomorrow morning. We’ll meet directly at the airport at about 2:30 in the afternoon!”

“Alright!” Song Wei said happily,”I’ll take care of the plane tickets. I’ll help you book them!”

“Alright! “Thank you for your hard work ...” Xia ruofei said.

……

The next day, Xia ruofei came to the office early in the morning and gathered Feng Jing, pang Hao, Xiao Qiang, and the other company leaders for a small meeting. Feng Jing had already reported to Xia ruofei about the work that had been done in the past few days. Today, he mainly told everyone that he would be going to the capital for a few days and arranged some important work in the near future.

The most important task at hand was naturally the relocation of the headquarters. Xia ruofei emphasized the safety of the office environment again. He would rather delay the relocation than let the employees take drugs in the building.

When Feng Jing heard that Xia ruofei had just returned and was about to leave, she felt a little resentful. However, in the presence of so many people, she still paid attention to protecting Xia ruofei’s authority as the chairman and did not show any displeasure.

However, as soon as the meeting ended, Feng Jing immediately went to Xia ruofei’s office. Xia ruofei knew that Feng Jing was going to scold him, so he quickly explained to her before she could speak.

When she heard that Xia ruofei was going to the capital to work on a project with song Rui and the others, Feng Jing’s unhappiness disappeared immediately.

Xia ruofei chatted with Feng Jing for a while more before leaving the complex in a hurry.

Feng Jing looked at Xia ruofei’s back and sighed. She mumbled to herself,””I really owe you in my past life ...”

“President Feng, what are you talking about?”

A voice came from behind Feng Rao, giving her a fright. She turned around while caressing her chest.

When she saw Dong Yun standing there in a professional suit, she could not help but ask,””Assistant Dong, didn’t you go to the pharmaceutical factory for research? Why did you come back so early?”

“Oh, there’s just one last bit of work left. I finished the research this morning.” Dong Yun smiled and said,”I will form a research report as soon as possible. I hope it will be of help to the company!”

“It’ll definitely help!” Feng Jing said,”you’re an expert in this field. With you personally taking the pulse, our company will definitely improve our administrative efficiency and formal management by a large margin!”

“President Feng, you’re too kind!” Dong Yun smiled.”I’ll go back to my office then!”

“Alright, you can go back to your work! “Thank you for your hard work ...” Feng Jing nodded politely.

Dong Yun looked at Feng Jing and then glanced at Xia ruofei, who was walking through the square in front of the building towards the villa. She seemed to be deep in thought.

Feng Jing did not notice Dong Yun’s expression. After Dong Yun returned to her office, she immediately took out her phone, found Xia ruofei on WeChat, and sent him a voice message.
