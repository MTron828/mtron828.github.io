2457 Getting better and better (2)

Xia ruofei caressed Ling Qingxue’s hair as he asked,””What is it?”

“About uncle song!” Ling Qingxue said,”didn’t uncle song’s Constitution change after he was injured this time? you can try cultivating, right?” You have to think about this and choose a better cultivation technique for him ...”

Xia ruofei patted his forehead and said,””Qingxue, I almost forgot about this if you didn’t mention it! You’re still the most meticulous!”

Song Qiming had profited from his misfortune. His head was severely injured, and even his sea of consciousness was damaged. When Xia ruofei used the heart – concentrating grass to save him, his sea of consciousness had also changed. Just like Ling Qingxue, his physique had changed, and it was possible for him to cultivate.

Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”since you’ve already accepted Wei Wei, you should pay more attention to her father!” Otherwise, she’ll feel aggrieved. ”

Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat and he said,””Qingxue! Thank you ...”

Ling Qingxue pursed her lips and smiled,”alright!” Don’t think of me as a jealous woman! Although I did feel a little uncomfortable when I first found out about you and Wei Wei, I also know what it feels like to practice the spirit body Fusion. I’m afraid it’s not just the spirit body Fusion. Wei Wei already has someone in her heart for you, right?”

Xia ruofei smiled awkwardly.

This wasn’t easy to answer!

Ling Qingxue glanced at Xia ruofei and continued,””Wei Wei’s sacrifice was huge. We’re on the path of cultivation after all, and it’s time for us to change our mindsets. So, I’ve thought it through a long time ago ...”

“Then why did you leave me hanging for so long?” Xia ruofei asked.

Ling Qingxue glanced at Xia ruofei with a half – Smile and said,””If I don’t teach you a lesson, what if you find a few more sisters like Wei Wei?”

Xia ruofei was instantly embarrassed. He laughed dryly. “It’s not ... It’s not ... Wei Wei and I were just an accident ...”

When he said this, Monica’s figure involuntarily appeared in his mind.

Back then, when he and Monica had a one night stand, to be honest, they did not have much emotional Foundation. It was completely an impulse after being hot – headed. However, as they got along, this passionate woman from the Mediterranean region had undoubtedly occupied a certain position in Xia ruofei’s heart.

Besides, Xia ruofei also thought of Lu You.

This girl, who looked cold on the outside but had a very rich inner world, had boldly taken the initiative to confess to him in the past. It had been a long time since he had heard from her.

Of course, this was just a flash of knowledge. Xia ruofei did not dare to reveal any flaws in front of Ling Qingxue. Otherwise, not only Ling Qingxue, but Song Wei would also be furious. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He secretly sighed and said worriedly in his heart,”These were all debts he owed ...

Ling Qingxue didn’t pursue the topic any further. She said,””Ruofei, about uncle song ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”Qingxue, I know what to do. I’ll find a suitable martial art for uncle song first.” However ... The actual implementation was still a bit difficult. First of all, we have to make uncle song accept the existence of practitioners. Besides, he’s a little old, after all, so it might be difficult to make him a practitioner!”

Ling Qingxue nodded.”It’s okay. Let’s take it slow. Just remember this ...”

“En!” Xia ruofei said.

Ling Qingxue revealed an envious expression and said,””If uncle song can become a cultivator, Wei Wei will be very happy! Even if your cultivation can’t reach a high level, you can at least extend your life!”

Xia ruofei saw through Ling Qingxue’s thoughts. He patted Ling Qingxue’s smooth and tender shoulder gently and said,””Qingxue, don’t worry! In the future, when my cultivation has improved, I will think of a way to let uncle Ling cultivate with me. Even if he can’t cultivate, I will find some spiritual medicine for him to consume. At least, he will live to a hundred years old!”

“I know ...” Ling Qingxue smiled sweetly at Xia ruofei and said,”it’s late. Go to sleep!”

The two of them fell asleep in each other’s arms.

Since the afternoon, Xia ruofei had been cultivating in the time formation. He had been cultivating for almost twenty days. In addition, he had fought with Ling Qingxue for 300 rounds at night. He was mentally exhausted and soon fell into a deep sleep.

The next morning, Xia ruofei did not wake up to cultivate. He slept all the way until dawn.

Ling Qingxue was also lazily sleeping in Xia ruofei’s arms. When she woke up and saw the sunlight coming in through the window, she immediately got up from the bed in a hurry.

Xia ruofei rubbed his sleepy eyes and said,””It’s still early! Sleep a little longer!”

Ling Qingxue said in a panic,”I’m dead because of you. The sky is already bright!” Wei Wei must be up by now. If she sees us ...”

Xia ruofei said lazily,”so what if I see it!” You’re my wife, so you’re open and aboveboard!”

“I’m too lazy to talk to you!”Ling Qingxue lowered her eyes and said.

Ling Qingxue and Song Wei had an agreement. Other than when they were cultivating, Ling Qingxue would not be alone with Xia ruofei, let alone spend the night with him.

If Ling Qingxue went back on her promise and even spent the night with Xia ruofei, she would be too embarrassed to face Song Wei if she was caught red – handed.

Ling Qingxue hurriedly put on her clothes, tidied her hair, and walked out of the bedroom in a hurry.

She opened the door of the hall a crack and poked her head out to look around. Then she quickly slipped out and tiptoed to the other side of the courtyard, to the guest room that belonged to her.

Even though Xia ruofei was still in bed, he had been paying attention to Ling Qingxue’s condition with his spiritual power. He could not help but laugh when he saw this.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power also detected that Song Wei had already woken up. Just as she was about to come out of the guest room, she saw Ling Qingxue coming out from Xia ruofei’s room, so she went back to her room.

Obviously, Song Wei already knew that Ling Qingxue had spent the night in Xia ruofei’s room. However, she did not want Ling Qingxue to feel awkward, so she took the initiative to avoid her.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile. Yesterday, Ling Qingxue had taken the initiative to remind him to prepare a cultivation technique for song Qiming. Today, Song Wei had pretended not to notice that Ling Qingxue had spent the night here. It seemed that the situation was developing in a better direction.

Xia ruofei was no longer sleepy. He jumped out of bed in a good mood, put on his clothes, and went out.

At that moment, Ling Qingxue and Song Wei also walked out of their rooms.

Ling Qingxue felt a little guilty and greeted Xia ruofei and Song Wei. Song Wei’s expression was normal, as if she had no idea what had happened last night.

After the three of them had breakfast in the backyard, they took the Toyota Elfa commercial car driven by Wu Qiang and headed to the Paradise gathering celebration site in little Tang town.

Although Song Wei was considered an industry insider, she did not want to join in the fun. However, after Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue’s persuasion, she agreed to go to the celebration with them.

It was the weekend, so there wasn’t as much traffic on the road in the morning. The Elfa van quickly drove onto the ring road and headed out of the city.

40 minutes later, the car arrived at the Paradise gathering.

Although it was an opening ceremony, it was a high – end club, so it wasn’t as loud as usual celebrations, with an inflatable arch or balloon banners. There were only some decorations along the road to embellish the festive atmosphere.

As soon as the car entered the entrance of the Paradise gathering, it stopped. Zhao Yongjun, song Rui, and the others were standing at the entrance to welcome the guests.

Xia ruofei, Ling Qingxue, and Song Wei alighted from the car. Naturally, there was a staff member who guided Wu Qiang to the side parking lot to Park his car.

“RUO Fei!” Zhao Yongjun came up to greet him with a smile, his face full of joy.
