Xia ruofei chuckled.”Let’s not talk about this ...” He said.”Since my future father – in – Law has spoken, you can go back today ...”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but feel a little disappointed.””But ... I still want to cultivate with you!”

“We’re both in the three mountains, isn’t it easy to cultivate? Besides, you’ve improved so much this time that you’ll need a few days to consolidate your cultivation. If you practice the “absolute beginning Scripture” on your own, even though the efficiency is a little low, your Foundation will be more solid, and it’ll also be beneficial for you to be more proficient in mastering the first level of the technique!” Xia ruofei said.

“But you’d better find someone to share the work at your company,” he added.”Otherwise, you’ll be busy all day and it’ll really delay your cultivation.”

“I know.” Ling Qingxue said,”when I go back today, I’ll talk to my dad about this ... Actually, I’ve always been inclined to find a professional team of managers to be in charge of the daily operations of the company ...”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”that’s right!” Do you see how relaxed I am now? And it doesn’t affect the money – making!”

Xia ruofei continued,”talk to uncle Ling when you get back. If you really can’t do it, you can push me out and say that you’re too busy with work and don’t have time to date me. I’ve already said goodbye to you.” If you want to blame someone, then let father – in – Law blame me! Anyway, I’m not worried about my debts ...”

Ling Qingxue laughed and said,”you’re speaking as if my father and you are irreconcilable!” How could it be that serious? He actually quite admires you ...”

“You say it as if it’s true ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Then, he remembered that Li Yifu was going to visit him and said,””By the way, even if you’re going home today, don’t be in a hurry to leave. Someone will come to visit me later. Haven’t you always been interested in the cultivation world? You should come along and meet them too!”

Ling Qingxue’s eyes lit up.””Are there other cultivators coming to visit you later?”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” But don’t be too surprised later! That person isn’t young anymore, but his seniority is much lower than mine. Speaking of which, he should be calling me martial granduncle ...”

Xia ruofei was also giving Ling Qingxue a heads up in advance. When Li Yifu came to visit later, he would definitely greet him respectfully so that Ling Qingxue would not be frightened.

“Martial granduncle?” Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but open her eyes wide and say,”even if you are of high seniority, isn’t your martial granduncle a little too outrageous?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you’ll find out in the future. This is not a strange thing in the world of cultivation.” After all, the lifespan of cultivators is very long. There are many who can live for hundreds of years, and it’s normal for disciples to have a difference of one or two hundred years. After several generations, the seniority naturally seems a bit outrageous ...”

Ling Qingxue nodded to show that she understood.

“Now that you’ve mentioned it, I’m really looking forward to it!” Lin Sanjiu continued, giggling.

“He should be here soon,” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Xia ruofei said ‘soon’ because he knew that Li Yifu would definitely rush to the farm as fast as he could after hanging up the phone. However, he still underestimated Li Yifu’s speed. In fact, when Li Yifu called, he had already arrived near Taoyuan farm.

Hence, Xia ruofei had only spoken to Ling Qingxue for a short while when the guards at the gate called, saying that an old man had come to visit him and would like to ask if he could let him in.
