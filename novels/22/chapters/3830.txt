Chapter 3831  Making up for the shortcomings (1)

    At first, Xia ruofei was caught off guard, but after he got used to it, he became more relaxed.

  He stood on the spot, enduring the formation's constant hammering on his sea of consciousness, while letting his thoughts go free.

  There was no doubt that this array was extremely helpful for the cultivation of mental power. He had always been a little worried that the speed of his vital Qi cultivation was getting faster and faster because he had been using top - notch cultivation resources for the past two years. This might cause his mental power to be unable to keep up. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

  In fact, this trend had already appeared. His spiritual power had long reached the middle stage of the spirit gathering realm, which was equivalent to the spiritual power realm of a cultivator in the middle stage of the nascent soul realm. At that time, he had just broken through to the Golden core realm. Now that he had broken through to the early stage of the nascent soul realm, his spiritual power realm had only improved by a small realm, reaching the late stage of the spirit gathering realm. It was easy to imagine how difficult it would be to continue to break through to another realm.

  Now, he had even begun to use the pure origin fluid to cultivate. His Yuan Qi cultivation would definitely improve at an extremely fast rate. As time passed, his Yuan Qi cultivation and mental power would get closer and closer to each other, to the point where his mental power might not be able to keep up with his Yuan Qi cultivation.

  This could be considered Xia ruofei's current shortcoming.

  However, the upgrade of the spirit map space this time had made up for this shortcoming.

  Xia ruofei believed that as long as he continued to train his spiritual power in this formation, the improvement of his spiritual power would not be any less than the improvement of his vital Qi.

  At the same time, Xia ruofei thought of Ling Qingxue, Song Wei, Li Yifu, and the rest.

  In fact, their situation was similar to Xia ruofei 's. Now, the people closest to Xia ruofei were also enjoying the best cultivation environment and the best cultivation resources. Their vital Qi cultivation had improved more and more. Their spiritual power was even lower than Xia ruofei' s, so the contradiction was even more obvious.

  Therefore, the appearance of this spiritual energy formation not only solved Xia ruofei's shortcomings in cultivation but also solved the hidden dangers for the people around him.

  However, there was another big problem. The formation was fixed in the depths of the mountain and sea realm in the spirit map space. Even Xia ruofei could not move the formation out of the spirit map space and let Li Yifu and the others use it.

  At first, Xia ruofei was caught off guard, but after he got used to it, he became more relaxed.

  He stood on the spot, enduring the formation's constant hammering on his sea of consciousness, while letting his thoughts go free.

  This could be considered Xia ruofei's current shortcoming.

  However, the upgrade of the spirit map space this time made up for this shortcoming at once.

  Xia ruofei believed that as long as he continued to train his spiritual power in this formation, the improvement of his spiritual power would not be any less than the improvement of his vital Qi.
