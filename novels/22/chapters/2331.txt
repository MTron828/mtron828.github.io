2332 The situation is optimistic (3)

“I’ll write a prescription. Can you please arrange for the Chinese medicine pharmacy to help me brew it?” Xia ruofei asked.

Professor Chen nodded and said,””No problem!”

Naturally, Xia ruofei could not give her a prescription for the procedure. However, since it was a procedure, there must be a way to adapt.

With professor Chen’s reputation, it was easy for him to deal with this kind of thing. He just had to take Xia ruofei’s prescription to the Chinese Medicine Department, find a familiar doctor, and get the bill in the name of this doctor.

By then, the prescription would be directly sent to the Chinese medicine room, and the Chinese medicine room would also have a medicine – brewing service.

“Thank you!” Xia ruofei said.

A smart graduate student handed Xia ruofei a pen and paper.

Xia ruofei nodded at him in thanks and started to write the prescription.

As a master of Chinese medicine, Ge Jun was naturally very interested. Since Xia ruofei’s prescription was going to be given to the Chinese medicine Hall, there was no need to keep it a secret. Hence, he stood behind Xia ruofei and watched with interest.

The expression on Ge Jun’s face kept changing. Finally, he couldn’t help but say,”Wonderful! Junior Brother Xia, your prescription will be very effective in nourishing the mind! Shidi is indeed a genius!”

Xia ruofei finished writing the prescription and passed it to professor Chen. Then, he smiled and said,””Senior brother GE, you’re too kind. In fact, this is a prescription. I just made a slight adjustment to the proportion of the herbs.”

“Cheng Fang?” Ge Jun revealed a look of surprise,”I’ve never heard of this before! Could it be ...”

A prescription referred to a more mature prescription that had been verified in clinical practice. However, Ge Jun had never seen this formula before, so he subconsciously thought that it was a formula recorded in the [three cloud rubbing scrolls] that was lost in the family.

Xia ruofei said,”I saw this in another medical book. I can’t remember the name. But I’m sure it’s a cure.”

“I see!” Ge Jun said in realization,”it seems that Junior Brother Xia’s knowledge is far more profound than I thought!”

Then, Ge Jun said to professor Chen,””Xiao Chen, I’ll go with you. I have to be watching from the side when the medicine is being brewed, so as not to ruin such a good prescription!”

Professor Chen didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. How little confidence did he have in the General Hospital? After all, this was a tertiary Grade A hospital! Although the Department of Chinese medicine was not as good as a specialized Chinese medicine hospital, it was not to the extent that they would make mistakes in decocting the medicine.

However, Ge Jun was his senior and he placed great importance on this formula. He did not dare to say anything and could only smile bitterly to himself before nodding in agreement.

Professor Chen left the room with Ge Jun and the other doctors. The room became quiet.

Xia ruofei smiled and explained to Fang Liyun,””Aunty Fang, the prescription just now is for nourishing the mind and brain. It’s good for uncle song’s body. Even if uncle song wakes up, he can still take the medicine for a while. ” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Even professor Chen and Ge Jun respected Xia ruofei so much. Naturally, Fang Liyun believed Xia ruofei’s words. She smiled and said,””Ruofei, you’re Qiming’s attending doctor. I’ll follow your arrangements for the treatment!”

Xia ruofei’s prescription was not a secret. It was just one of the many lost prescriptions he had. It just happened to be helpful for song Qiming’s recovery.

He had just checked song Qiming’s condition. He had not fully absorbed the heart – concentrating herb. Song Qiming’s sea of consciousness had recovered by more than half. Therefore, he was very optimistic and had already started to make arrangements for his follow – up recovery and recuperation.

At that moment, Song Wei, who was facing the hospital bed, widened her eyes. She rubbed her eyes and said in a trembling voice,””Mom! I ... I think I saw dad’s eyelids move!”
