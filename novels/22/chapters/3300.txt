3301 The wonderful journey of the spirit painting scroll (2)

After the little old man had taken the spirit painting scroll, he did not realize that the target of this large search operation was actually hidden in the item he had accidentally picked up.

He leaped onto the courtyard wall again, and his sharp eyes swept around.

When the old man did not find any trace of Xia ruofei, he ordered the puppets to continue the search.

The other jiedan stage puppets quickly nodded in agreement.

The little old man then leaped up and ran towards the center of the town.

Actually, Xia ruofei had a slight impression of this old man. He had seen this old man when he first stepped into the mini town under the guidance of the Taoist child Qing Feng.

However, at that time, the old man was begging for food in the corner of a shop with a miserable face. Xia ruofei had met him once, but he did not know that he was so powerful.

The little old man carried the spirit painting and ran madly. Xia ruofei could use the most basic perception in the space to observe the situation outside.

The scenery in Xia ruofei’s vision changed rapidly. It was clear that the old man’s speed was extremely fast.

In a short while, the old man arrived at the street corner where Xia ruofei had first seen him.

Xia ruofei was speechless. Did this old man come back to beg for food?

Now that all the puppets had left their roles and were searching for Xia ruofei with all their might, could it be that this old man was still reluctant to leave his role and was trying to “resume his old career”?

Even though the situation was urgent, Xia ruofei still found it funny.

The little old man bent down and picked up a broken bowl with three holes on the ground. He wiped the dust off it with his sleeve and then put it in his shirt.

After that, the old man left the corner and turned into a small alley.

Xia ruofei’s vision changed rapidly. Soon, the old man arrived at the entrance of a courtyard.

The little old man pushed open the courtyard door and walked in, walking into the room with familiarity.

Obviously, this should be the little old man’s home.

After the little old man entered the house, he picked up his teacup and gulped down a few mouthfuls of tea. Then he sat down and unfolded the painting again, studying it with great interest.

Xia ruofei was speechless.

He had originally wanted to take advantage of the little old man’s inattentiveness to suddenly appear in the outside world, and then immediately put the spirit map scroll into his palm, and then escape without hesitation.

However, this little old man seemed to really like this painting scroll very much. After sitting down, he had been admiring it without end.

Finally, Xia ruofei waited for the old man to put down the painting. To his surprise, the old man stood up and poured another bowl of water. After gulping it down, he sat back down to look at the painting.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but complain. You’re a puppet, not a real human. Do you have to be so realistic? He was drinking water non – stop ...

Especially when Xia ruofei saw that the time in the perceptual mirror was getting closer and closer to two hours, he was even more anxious.

If this little old man continued to look at the spirit painting for half an hour, then his hopes of breaking the record would be dashed.

With Xia ruofei’s ability, he only needed nine more puppets to complete the mission. Twenty minutes should be enough.

However, this little old man alone had wasted nearly ten minutes of his time, and this was because the little old man’s speed was extremely fast. From that dead end to his return home, the time spent on the journey was very little.

Xia ruofei could only watch as the time in the perceptual mirror’s career increased, but he could do nothing but stare at the old man. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

When there were only ten minutes left before the record was broken, the little old man finally put down the spirit map scroll.

This time, he was really going to leave the house, because the little old man had carefully rolled up the spirit map scroll. Then, he opened the lock of a box and placed the spirit map scroll into the box before locking it up.

“Hurry up and leave! Hurry up and leave!” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but shout in his heart.

Although the old man had stopped studying the painting, Xia ruofei would not be able to come out if he stayed in the room.

Fortunately, the old man seemed to have heard Xia ruofei’s thoughts. After locking the painting, he left the room and walked out of the courtyard, heading towards the central Street of the mini – town.

As the owner of the painting, Xia ruofei’s perception was completely useless in this situation. As the painting was locked in the cabinet, it was completely dark in his vision.

Xia ruofei did not know that the old man had already left the courtyard.

However, he really did not have time to waste. Furthermore, the Golden core stage puppets that he had encountered before basically had no mental power. So he could only take a gamble. He was betting that if this little old man was still in the house, he would not be able to detect his mental spying.

This was, of course, very risky. After all, the little old man was a puppet with the strength of the original infant stage.

However, Xia ruofei still released his spiritual power determinedly.

He carefully controlled the range of his spiritual power and slowly expanded it.

Very quickly, Xia ruofei had a full view of the situation outside.

The old man was no longer in the room. Xia ruofei’s spiritual power continued to spread and soon realized that the old man was no longer in the house.

He did not continue to expand the range of his mental strength. He was confident that outside of this large range, the little old man would not be able to discover his whereabouts.

Of course, this was just Xia ruofei’s guess. In reality, it was still dangerous.

However, time waited for no one. If he wanted to break the record, he had to take a risk.

Xia ruofei made up his mind and returned to the outside world.

He didn’t even think about it and put the spirit map scroll back into his palm.

Xia ruofei put the painting away and his heart finally settled down.

He couldn’t be bothered to search the little old man’s house and directly jumped out of the back window. Then, he quickly jumped over the wall of the backyard.

There was still some distance to the center of the mini town. Most of the puppets were attracted to the dead end, so the area was very empty. Xia ruofei’s spiritual power did not detect the existence of the puppets.

He strode towards the dead end, and at the same time, he kept his mental power radiating outward.

There were less than ten minutes left, and he still needed to kill nine puppets.

Otherwise, even if he completed the mission, he would not have the chance to break the record.

Very quickly, Xia ruofei’s body turned sideways and he entered a narrow alley. Using his mental power to check, he found three early – Stage golden core cultivators walking from the opposite side of the alley.

...

Without any hesitation, he threw out the spirit map scroll again and stuffed it directly above the lintel of a courtyard gate. Then, he entered the space with a thought.

The three early gold core realm puppets quickly walked over.

When they passed the location of the spirit map, Xia ruofei returned to the outside world with a thought. Almost at the same time, he released the qushuang flying sword and the blue immortal sword.

The two flying swords pierced toward the three puppets with a sharp whistling sound.

Xia ruofei didn’t hold back at all. The three puppets were all at the early golden core stage and were the weakest among the puppets.

Xia ruofei was very willing to meet such an opponent. Even if there were three puppets at the same time, he would not give up.

The three puppets were caught off guard, and two of them were stabbed in their vital points in one round, dying on the spot.

The other puppet had just shouted when Xia ruofei, who was following closely behind the flying sword, smashed the top of its skull with a palm.

With Xia ruofei’s current strength, it was not difficult for him to deal with an early – Stage golden core puppet, which was much weaker than an early – Stage golden core cultivator.

However, with three puppets working together, it would be difficult for Xia ruofei to kill them all in an instant.

The last puppet cried out for help before it died.

...

After Xia ruofei killed the puppet, he didn’t even bother to hide the corpse. He left the alley immediately.

His mind power had already searched the nearby area so he had already chosen his escape route. Before the other puppets arrived, Xia ruofei had already left the area.
