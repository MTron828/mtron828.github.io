Chapter 3523: Strong suppression (2)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei was very clear about the situation in the cultivation world. Strength was the most important thing. There were not as many restrictions as in the secular world. Lu You, a girl, had suddenly stepped onto the path of cultivation. As a friend, Xia ruofei naturally had to understand the situation.

He didn’t expect that this mental power Probe would allow him to see everything that had happened in the car clearly.

That was why Xia ruofei got off the car halfway and asked the driver to drive the car back to the club while he flew over to Lu You’s car on his flying sword.

Attendant Liu was only a Qi Level 3 cultivator. Xia ruofei could kill her with his spiritual power alone, so he didn’t take her seriously.

When Xia ruofei saw that Deacon Liu actually pushed all the blame onto Lu You, he couldn’t help but feel a trace of killing intent.

He used his spiritual energy to suppress it, causing attendant Liu to involuntarily spit out a mouthful of blood. This could only be considered a small punishment, even though attendant Liu had already suffered a very serious internal injury.

Xia ruofei snorted coldly and said,”do you think I’m an idiot?.”

“I don’t dare! I don’t dare!” Deacon Liu quickly knelt on the ground and kowtowed like pounding garlic. He was so scared that he didn’t dare to have any lucky thoughts.

Deacon Liu was so frightened that his entire body trembled like a sieve. Lu You was also frightened by this powerful pressure. Her small face was pale and she was at a loss.

Deacon Liu saw Lu You from the corner of his eye and suddenly had an idea. He quickly pointed at Lu You and said loudly,””Senior! It was all her fault! This is the new disciple of our water Yuan sect. She was the one who said that she found an ownerless cultivation treasure land here and that it was bought by an ordinary person from the secular world to build a club. She was the one who incited the sect master to send me here to deal with this matter! We really didn’t know that this was senior’s cultivation cave! Please forgive me, senior!”

Lu You was stunned when she heard this.

This matter had nothing to do with her. She had been to the Paradise Club before, but she had no experience in cultivation and didn’t know what spirit Qi was. After she went abroad to study, she didn’t come to the Paradise Club again. She only came into contact with cultivation after she went abroad to study. How could she know that the spirit Qi concentration in the Paradise Club was very high?

In fact, it was another disciple of the water Yuan sect who had discovered this and reported it to the sect.

This disciple was Deacon Liu’s trusted aide, which was why the sect had sent Deacon Liu over to take charge of this matter. As Lu You’s family background in the secular world was not ordinary, the sect had sent Lu You over to help Youyou. In reality, if the problem could be solved within the rules, cultivators were not willing to use some extraordinary means. After all, it was easy to be criticized by others.

Hence, Lu You was only sent to assist Deacon Liu. However, in order to save his life, Deacon Liu pushed all the responsibility onto Lu You. This made her very angry and also very afraid.

However, before she could explain herself, Deacon Liu, who was sitting in the back row, suddenly felt that the pressure had increased several times. She could not move her body, and her bones were creaking under the pressure. Deacon Liu felt a sweet taste in his throat, and a stream of blood spurted out involuntarily.

That ‘senior’ was naturally Xia ruofei. He had been paying attention to Lu You’s situation with his spiritual power since he got into the car. It was obvious that Lu You was not in a good position to say something tonight, and Xia ruofei was very concerned about the spiritual Qi fluctuations in her body.
