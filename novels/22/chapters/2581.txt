2582 An excellent start (2)

Xia ruofei was not used to song Qiming and his wife being so enthusiastic.

The three of them chatted as they ate. Xia ruofei and song Qiming clinked their glasses and drank from time to time. The atmosphere was very harmonious.

Considering that song Qiming was still recovering, the two of them did not drink too much. From the second glass onwards, they only had a light sip.

While they were eating, song Qiming mentioned Xia ruofei’s “medical advice” to Fang Liyun. When Fang Liyun heard that Xia ruofei wanted song Qiming to practice the health maintenance technique every day, she was in full agreement.

She smiled and said,”I’ve already told your uncle song a few times to take care of his health, but he just won’t listen!” Now that RUO Fei is telling you, you should believe him, right?”

“I’m just busy with work,”song Qiming said with a bitter smile. Don’t I want to accompany you to walk around the neighborhood after dinner every day? The conditions don’t allow it!”

“There are so many people in the troupe! I think you’re the busiest!” Fang Liyun could not help but criticize,”other people are rushing to get results and avoid trouble as much as possible, but you ... You don’t even care if it’s a job in the province or the city, you just accept it if it’s possible or not. You deserve to work so hard!”

“How can you be so picky at work?” song Qiming asked. I’ve always been like this! Besides ... If I wasn’t such an upright person, how could you have fallen for me?”

Fang Liyun blushed and glared at song Qiming.””You damn old man! This junior is here! You’re so rude ...”

Song Qiming could not help but burst out laughing.

Xia ruofei looked at the two “flirtatious” people and felt a little embarrassed. He could only lower his head and eat the White rice in his bowl, pretending not to hear them. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Seeing this, Fang Liyun smiled and gave Xia ruofei a piece of red braised pork.””Ruofei, don’t just focus on eating! Have some food!”

“Good, good, good! Thank you, Auntie!” Xia ruofei said.

“By the way, can I practice the health – maintaining technique you taught your uncle song?” Fang Liyun replied,”I just want to keep an eye on him. If no one is watching him, he’ll be lazy!”

Song Qiming could not help but smile bitterly.”I’m not a kid anymore. Besides, I’ve always valued ruofei’s opinion. How could I be lazy?”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”aunty Fang, my health – Maintenance technique is only suitable for men. It won’t have any effect on you. It might even have the opposite effect. So ...”

“Oh! Then forget it!” Fang Liyun smiled and said,”it’s not bad for me to walk more often!”

“Yes! You’re in good health, and walking fast is a good exercise for you. ” Xia ruofei said,”uncle song’s injuries from last time have affected his body’s Foundation, so he had to use some uncommon methods to make up for it.”

Of course, Fang Liyun could also try to cultivate “if modest Heart Sutra”, but her physique was not suitable for cultivation at all, so no matter how hard she tried, it would not have any effect.

In order to prevent Fang Liyun’s efforts from being in vain, Xia ruofei quickly dispelled the idea.

After dinner, Xia ruofei wanted to help Fang Liyun clean up the dishes. However, song Qiming’s house already had a domestic service staff. If Xia ruofei had not come to visit, Fang Liyun would not have to cook. Therefore, someone would naturally do the cleaning.

Hence, Xia ruofei, song Qiming, and Fang Liyun made some tea in the living room and took a short break after dinner.

After that, he asked song Qiming to find a quiet room and prepared to teach him the ‘health maintenance technique’.

Song Qiming brought Xia ruofei to the study room on the second floor.

Song Qiming had a lot of books in his collection. When he worked at home, he would usually do it in his study room. Therefore, his study room was actually a standard bedroom that had been modified. The actual area was much larger than an ordinary study room.

The study room in the small building had been converted into a storage room.

Xia ruofei took the yoga mat that Fang Liyun had given him and laid it on the floor in the middle of the study room.

“Uncle song, please sit cross – legged on the mat,” he said.

Song Qiming nodded. He took off his slippers, stepped on the yoga mat, and sat down cross – legged.

Xia ruofei reached into his shoulder bag and took out a spiritual crystal.

He walked to the opposite of song Qiming and sat down cross – legged.

Xia ruofei handed over the crystals and said,””Uncle song, hold this in your hand and then turn your five hearts to the sky.”

As he spoke, he showed song Qiming the correct way to sit cross – legged.

Of course, there was no strict requirement on the sitting posture when practicing the Sutra of humility. Xia ruofei just hoped to increase the sense of ceremony through this method so that song Qiming would be more convinced that this health – Maintenance method was not ordinary.

Song Qiming quickly adjusted his sitting position according to Xia ruofei’s demonstration. The spiritual crystal was held in his right hand.

Then, Xia ruofei’s voice started to become ethereal, as if it had a trace of magic.””Now, close your eyes ... Imagine that you are in a very quiet environment. There are many free nutrients around you, like little spirits, lively and cute. Don’t open your eyes, and focus on feeling these ‘little spirits’. They are around you, and the entire space is filled with their excited figures ...”
