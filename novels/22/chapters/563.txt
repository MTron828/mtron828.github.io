Chapter 564: Chapter 433 – sending money to the door (1)

“What is it, brother Xia?” President Lin quickly said.

Xia ruofei said unhurriedly,”brother Lin, I have a company in the southeast province. It mainly deals with vegetables, melons, fruits, and other agricultural products. Of course, in the future, iron – hide maples and wild old ginseng will also become our important products. So I hope that the iron – hide maples I sell to Tongren Hall will be packaged in our own unified packaging and labeled with the Taoyuan brand.”

Xia ruofei paused for a moment before he continued,””If you can agree on this condition, I can make the decision to sign an exclusive sales contract with you. In the future, the iron – skinned maple and even the wild old ginseng produced by our company can all be authorized to be sold to you. As for the Commission model, or you can buy it directly from our company and set the price yourself, we can discuss it slowly. ”

All of Xia ruofei’s decisions were made to increase the reputation of paradise Corporation.

After the expansion of the farm, the production capacity had increased, and the excellent quality of Taoyuan vegetables should soon be able to make a name for itself in the province and even the country.

As for the Drunken Eight Immortals, Xia ruofei would also discuss with Ling Xiaotian and name it as a joint production of peach blossom company and Ling Ji restaurant.

Originally, Xia ruofei only wanted to make some quick money from the wild ginseng and iron – Skin Dendrobium. However, after Mr. Lin took the fengdou for testing, the results showed that the quality was far better than the best iron – Skin fengdou in the market. Naturally, Xia ruofei had the idea of naming it Taoyuan.

President Lin pondered for a moment and said,”brother Xia, I agree with your condition in principle. After all, Tongren Hall doesn’t produce medicinal materials ourselves. Even the Ironhide maples we sell have their own trademarks. We must make your batch of Ironhide maples into gift boxes before we can sell them.”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. He quietly looked at President Lin and waited for him to continue.

“Personally, I really want to facilitate this cooperation, but I still have to ask the higher – ups for the specific model,” President Lin continued.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded,”it’s okay. There’s no hurry.” Brother Lin, I should be in Anyue city for the next two days. You can send someone or talk to us personally after I return to the three mountains. ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Okay, okay ...” President Lin quickly said.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”brother Lin, you can report to the head of your main store. If we work together, I can provide at least 900 kilograms of the iron – Skin maples of today’s quality every year. Also ... I can provide at least two wild ginseng of the same quality every year.”

A strange light flashed in President Lin’s eyes. He nodded heavily and said,””Alright! Brother Xia, I’ll definitely get the authorization from the higher – ups as soon as possible and fly to Sanshan city personally to discuss the contract with you!”

When President Lin heard Xia ruofei’s production, his heart was in turmoil. This was definitely a rare opportunity! It was the same for both him and Tongren Hall! The only thing he was worried about now was that any delay would bring more trouble, so he couldn’t wait to call the head in charge of the main store and report it.

Xia ruofei could guess what Mr. Lin was thinking. He smiled and said,”Big brother Lin, I won’t disturb you any longer.”

“Good, good, good! Brother Xia, the money for this batch of iron maples should be transferred to your account tomorrow morning. ” President Lin said,”I’ll arrange for you to stay at Qiantang first!”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.”It’s okay. Li Jun has already prepared a place for me. I’m going to go to Anyue city tonight.” Big brother Lin, just do what you need to do, don’t worry about me. ”

“Alright then!” President Lin said,”brother Xia, I’ll treat you to a drink when you return from ou Yue ...”

“Big brother Lin, I’ll be heading back to the three mountains after I’m done with my business there.” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”let’s have a good gathering when you go to the three mountains in a few days!”

Anyue city was located between Sanshan city and Qiantang city. Last time, Xia ruofei had to travel back and forth by plane. This time, if he drove by himself, he would definitely go from Vietnam to the southeast province. It was impossible for him to drive north to Qiantang city.

President Lin revealed a trace of regret and said,””That’s the only way! Brother Xia, drive slowly then ...”

“Alright!”

Xia ruofei bade farewell to Mr. Lin, took master Luo to the Knight XV, and rushed to Anyue city.

At this time, Qin Xiaojun and his team had already found a hotel in the city.

Xia ruofei had brought master Luo along because he wanted to sell the Ironhide Kaede bucket. He wanted master Luo to help him with any questions regarding his profession. After all, he had made it himself.

They didn’t expect the quality of the iron – skinned fengdou to be so high. President Lin and the others directly sent a sample to the pharmaceutical research Institute for testing.

Speaking of which, master Luo had made a wasted trip. If he had known earlier, he would have bought a train ticket and let him leave with Qin Xiaojun and the others.

Xia ruofei also expressed his apologies on the way. Master Luo, on the other hand, was happy and did not mind that Xia ruofei gave Wanwan a 20000 Yuan red packet during his half a month of work in Sanshan city. Master Luo was overjoyed. It was just a few more hours in the car, so why would he mind?

Besides, the Knight XV was worth tens of millions of people!

At around 11 pm, Xia ruofei arrived at the iron – Skin Dendrobium base in Anyue city.

Although it was already late at night, Qian Lijun was still waiting in front of the small building of the Dendrobium cultivation base.
