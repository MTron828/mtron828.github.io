Chapter 529: Raising the prestige of our country (1)

Xia ruofei found the voice familiar. He straightened his body and turned around. He could not help but widen his eyes in surprise.

Standing not far behind him was a beautiful blonde girl, her blue eyes showing joy.

This person was Monica. Grao was the inheritor of the Grao family in Italy. Xia ruofei had gotten to know this beautiful foreign lady when he had attended the truffle auction in Shen Cheng city.

Monica was wearing a black shirt with straps today. The cleavage on her chest was faintly visible under the straps, and her exposed skin had a wheat – colored luster, making her look very sexy and charming.

A pair of ordinary blue trumpet jeans accentuated her long, slender legs and slender waist.

Under a light brown cowboy hat, she had long golden hair that reached her shoulders. She looked casual and wild.

What a sexy and alluring cowboy girl! Liang Qichao couldn’t help but exclaim in his heart.

“Monica!” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise.

Monica did not expect to meet Xia ruofei in Australia. When Xia ruofei turned around and she confirmed that she had not recognized the wrong person, she could not help but smile.

A few months ago, Monica had met Xia ruofei in China. This Asian young man had left a deep impression on her.

She felt that Xia ruofei was a little mysterious. He was able to bring out so many truffles at the auction, and every piece was of the highest quality. Even the Grao family, which had a long history of truffles, was not as powerful as him. However, his company was unknown.

What left a deep impression on Monica was Xia ruofei’s strong body. The first time they met was in the hotel’s gym. Xia ruofei had run at a 13 – kilometer high speed for more than two hours and had crippled Blake, who had been secretly competing with him.

And after coming down from the treadmill, Xia ruofei was still fine.

Even now, Monica could clearly remember the thin layer of sweat on Xia ruofei’s forehead and the mesmerizing scent of his male hormones.

Monica had lunch with Xia ruofei before he left shencheng. At that time, the two of them had discussed the cooperation between paradise Corporation and the Grao family in truffle sales. However, the truffle season had not arrived yet and there had been some resistance from the Grao family regarding this cooperation, so Monica had not contacted Xia ruofei for a long time.

However, he didn’t expect to meet her in Australia. Was this what the Chinese called fate? Monica said in her heart.

“Xia, it’s really you!” Monica walked forward and smiled.”This is really too unexpected ...”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Monica, as far as I know, Hunter Valley is not a traditional truffle – producing area. It’s not the truffle – producing season now either. Why did you suddenly come to Australia?”

Monica giggled and said,”is my life only left with work?” Xia, I’m on vacation in Australia. What about you? Are you also here for a vacation?”

Xia ruofei shrugged.”It’s the opposite. I’m here to work.”

“So, your company’s business has expanded to Australia?” Monica was slightly shocked.

“Almost!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ve invested in a farm in Australia. It’s right next to the West Winery.”

Monica’s sexy mouth instantly turned into an ‘O’ shape, and her beautiful blue eyes revealed an extremely surprised look.

“The premium farms in the Hunter Valley are quite expensive ...” Monica said.”Xia, it seems that your business has been developing very smoothly in the few months that I haven’t seen you!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“I guess you have some luck!” Xia ruofei said indifferently and then smiled.”I should be thanking you! Monica, if it wasn’t for the truffle auction that gave me a large amount of development funds, my company wouldn’t have been able to expand so quickly ...”

“Xia, can I visit your farm?” Monica asked.

“Of course, it’s my honor!” Xia ruofei said,”Oh right, I almost forgot to introduce you. This is my good friend and the manager of Paradise Farm, Liang Qichao.”

Then, Xia ruofei said to Liang Qichao in Chinese,””Brother Liang, this is Monica, the heir of the glaso family in Italy. Lady Grasso!”

Liang Qichao quickly stepped forward to greet her. Monica smiled elegantly and shook hands with Liang Qichao.”Manager Liang, nice to meet you!”

“Miss Grasso, welcome to our Paradise Farm!” Liang Qichao said.

“Thank you!”

“Monica, when do you have time?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“I can do it anytime!” Monica said,”the moment I met you, my visit to the West Winery had already ended.”

Liang Qichao winked at Xia ruofei and gave him an ambiguous smile.

“We’ve seen enough, let’s go!” Xia ruofei said, slightly embarrassed.

Xia ruofei and the other two walked out of the Wine Museum in the winery. At this time, the Carter couple were receiving another group of tourists. Coincidentally, these tourists were all yellow – skinned and black – haired, and they all spoke Chinese. They were obviously tourists from China.

China’s economy had been developing well in recent years, and there were more and more rich people. It was no longer a new thing to travel overseas. Basically, in the world – famous tourist spots, the probability of meeting Chinese people was quite high. After all, the population base of China was there.
