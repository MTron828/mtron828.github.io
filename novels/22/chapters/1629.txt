Chapter 1630: The nine revolutions universe formation (1)

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”the last thing is to prepare 63 ‘grandson nails’ and some yellow joss papers. These should be easy to buy in the market. However, they must be of good quality!”

The so – called “descendant nail” was actually a coffin nail, which meant that it could make children and grandchildren prosperous. Although crematoriums were now practiced in most areas and coffins were rarely used, it was still used in the Feng Shui industry, so it could still be bought in religious goods stores.

The yellow joss paper was even more common and easy to find.

Zhao Yongjun nodded as he recorded,””RUO Fei, I’m getting more and more interested! It’s another yellow joss paper for your descendants, and a Chinese pagoda tree Mirror. It seems like you’re preparing to do a ritual!”

“I really didn’t know,” song Rui said with a smile.”Ruofei, you know how to cook?”

Xia ruofei said,”I really don’t know how to do it, but it should be similar!” In any case, you should get the things ready as soon as possible! It’s best if we can get there before Liu haofan’s people enter. ”

Zhao Yongjun capped his pen and carefully folded the paper that Xia ruofei needed and put it in his pocket. Then he said,””Don’t worry! I’ll definitely be able to get everything ready in two days!”

Xia ruofei nodded.”Brother Zhao, you have to do this in secret. If you really can’t do it, you can do it elsewhere. It’s best if you don’t leave any traces.”

“Don’t worry, I know what I’m doing!”Zhao Yongjun laughed.

After a round trip to Xiaotang town in the morning, it was almost lunch time, so Xia ruofei asked everyone to stay at the courtyard house for a meal. After the meal, Zhao Yongjun and the others all said their goodbyes and left to prepare the items Xia ruofei needed.

Xia ruofei was not idle either. After he sent Wu Qiang back to his room to rest, he took out a piece of Jade from his spatial space to check on his harvest in Rui province. Other than the extremely rare black jade, he had also obtained four pieces of jade of rather good quality. This time, he took out one of the ice – Type jade which was of relatively average quality.

Xia ruofei flipped his hand and took out a carving knife from the space.

He looked at the Jade for a while, then cut a small piece decisively and put the rest of the Jade back into his space.

Next, Xia ruofei closed his eyes and meditated for a while. When he opened his eyes again, he picked up the carving knife and started to carve on the Jade without hesitation.

The Jade pieces fell down and the ice – Type jade quickly formed an embryonic form in Xia ruofei’s hands.

When Xia ruofei was carving Jade, he did not use many different tools of different sizes and shapes like a traditional carving master. With the help of his spiritual power and the help of his true energy, the carving knife became extremely sharp. He often only needed this one tool to complete most of the work.

Only when the carving knife was difficult to operate would they replace it with a smaller tool.

It was because he didn’t need to change tools frequently, and his overall grasp of the shape needed to be carved was better than most carving Masters, so his work efficiency was very high.

After a while, the ice – Type jade had turned into a lifelike Tiger in Xia ruofei’s hands.

The Tiger didn’t look particularly strong. It was even a little skinny, but its aura was quite fierce. Its eyes looked as if they were going to devour everything. It had a kind of brave aura that made people think of a hungry tiger pouncing on its food at first glance.

Without a doubt, this was a Tiger that descended the mountain. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

There was a saying that mountain Tigers were very hungry and came down to hunt for food. In comparison, they were much fiercer than mountain Tigers that were returning to their nests.

After Xia ruofei was done carving the mountain tiger, he kept the carving knife into the medium and sat in the courtyard to make tea and rest, recuperating.

After resting for about an hour, Xia ruofei felt that he had recovered all his spiritual energy. He was in a good condition.

So, he picked up the Jade Tiger that he had placed on the stone table.

Xia ruofei reached out and touched the Jade sculpture, feeling every vein and muscle line. Then, he closed his eyes like an old monk in meditation.

In fact, he had simulated the required array pattern in his mind.

After a long while, Xia ruofei suddenly opened his eyes. His eyes were filled with confidence. Without any hesitation, he stretched out his finger and gently drew a line on the surface of the Tiger jade carving.

A ray of light that was almost invisible to the naked eye entered the Jade statue.

Xia ruofei didn’t stop. His fingers were moving quickly on the surface of the Jade statue.

If someone with good eyesight was here, they would see that Xia ruofei’s fingers did not actually touch the Jade statue. They were just drawing at a position very close to the surface of the Jade statue.

However, there were rays of light that kept entering the Jade statue.

If Song Wei was here, she would be able to see that the light had formed mysterious lines inside the Jade carving and then gathered together. Only those with a certain level of spiritual power could see such a phenomenon. Ordinary people would not be able to see any changes in the Jade carving.

Xia ruofei finished the last stroke of the array pattern in one go.

Then, the Jade carving of the Tiger seemed to flash for a moment, before quickly returning to silence.
