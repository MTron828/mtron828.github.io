Chapter 558: Iron – skinned Kaede fight (1)

After the call went through, Xia ruofei said with a smile,””Young master Song, what have you been busy with recently? Why don’t I see you running to my farm?”

After finding out that Liu Jinsheng was from xiangnan province and had been active in xiangnan province since the incident, Xia ruofei naturally thought of song Rui.

Song Rui’s father was the Chief Judge of the xiangnan province. Young master Song was one of the most influential people in the province. Besides, Xia ruofei had a close relationship with song Rui. He did not have to beat around the bush when he asked him for help. It was the most convenient way.

If even song Rui couldn’t handle this, Xia ruofei would definitely give up on Chengcheng. He just wanted to help and return the favor.

There was a trace of fatigue in song Rui’s voice as he said,””I’ve been in the company recently! I just came back from a business trip ...”

“Swish!” Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and said in surprise,”you’ve changed?”

“Nonsense, didn’t you teach me to be a good baby first?” Song Rui said unhappily,”only by letting the enemy let down their guard can we live a good life!”

“How do you feel?” Xia ruofei asked, trying to hold back his laughter.

Song Rui was stunned for a moment and then said,””You don’t say ... Recently, I’ve been settling down to do some things and learn some skills. Although it’s a little tiring, I feel quite fulfilled ...”

“Kid, you’re too immersed in your role!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”there are no outsiders here. Why are you pretending?”

“I’m not acting!” Song Rui said unhappily,”brother, this is all true words, okay? It’s actually quite interesting to do business seriously ...”

Xia ruofei was quite surprised. When song Rui wanted to run away from the marriage and even ran away from his family’s arrangements, he cried and shouted that he wanted to run away from home and escape overseas. At that time, Xia ruofei just said that and asked him to act like a good baby. Naturally, the family did not have so many restrictions and did not press him so hard.

He didn’t expect this guy to be so serious.

Xia ruofei’s mind was in a mess,”if provincial head judge song knows about this, will he thank me?” ‘It’s all thanks to me ... I pulled this little devil onto the right path ...’

Xia ruofei felt that his image was becoming more and more imposing ...

Song Rui asked,”ruofei, is there anything I can help you with?” If there’s nothing else, I’ll hang up first. I still have a report to sort out in my hand!”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”wait, wait, wait!” I have something to do!”

“Then, make it short!” Song Rui said.

“Sure, song Rui. I need your help with something.” Xia ruofei said,”one of my comrades was scammed by someone and lost a large sum of money. The court ruled that my comrade won the case, but all the assets under his name were transferred and he didn’t get a single cent. That deadbeat is called Liu Jinsheng, and he’s from xiangnan province. I think you’re familiar with people there, so I hope you can help to coordinate ...”

“Just this?” Song Rui said,”I know! Send the details to my email! As long as this Liu ...”

“Liu Jinsheng!”

“That’s right, if Liu Jinsheng still has a single cent in his pocket, I will make him take it out and return it to your comrade!” Song Rui said in a relaxed manner.

“I’m glad to hear that!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you should pay more attention to this! I’m on good terms with that comrade of mine!”

“Don’t worry, don’t worry!” Song Rui said casually,”is there anything else? Then I’m hanging up!”

“Hang up, hang up! Come to the farm when you’re free, I’ll treat you to a drink!” Xia ruofei said.

Xia ruofei was not used to song Rui’s sudden drive.

After hanging up, Xia ruofei smiled and mumbled to himself,””This guy! Let’s hope he’s not just a three – minute hot topic ...”

Xia ruofei thought that it was very possible. Song Rui was lively by nature. He might start to get lazy after the novelty had passed.

……

Over the next few days, master Luo began to process the high – Quality iron – Skin Dendrobium in the farm.

Xia ruofei’s offer was very good. Whether it was the security team or the workers at the greenhouse, they were all very enthusiastic about signing up.

Hence, Xia ruofei simply asked master Luo to organize a small selection and selected five people from the registered people. These five people would follow master Luo step by step and would be sent to Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province to learn after some time.

In the future, the production of the Ironhide Kaede Dou by the peach blossom company would be based on these five people.

Of course, there was a lot of work to do in the early stages of the production. Moreover, the amount of raw materials here was huge. It was definitely not enough to rely on just five people. Xia ruofei arranged for ten more people to help master Luo.

These ten people were equivalent to “temporary transfers” within the system. They were still working in their respective positions and would come over to help during the production of Kaede Dou.

During the time they helped to make the iron – Skin maple bucket, they would also receive additional rewards in the form of bonuses and subsidies. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Under master Luo’s supervision, all the work was progressing steadily.

Xia ruofei had gone to the scene two days ago. Master Luo was very familiar with the processing of the fresh strips. He had removed the leaf sheath and cut the fresh strips into short sections of five to seven centimeters.

After that, he dried the freshly – processed strips and poured them into a high – Temperature iron pan to stir – fry.

All these could only be done by hand, especially when stir – frying. The control of the fire was very important, so such a key process was completed by master Luo himself.

Of course, he wouldn’t hide anything. He explained the steps and key points in detail to the five people as he operated.
