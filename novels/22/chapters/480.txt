Chapter 481: Chapter 394 – returning gifts (2)

Xia ruofei was surprised to hear that Lu You was here.

He had thought that even if Lu You helped him with this matter, it would definitely take a few days. He didn’t expect it to be so fast.

However, she had done him a big favor, so he immediately went downstairs to welcome her.

When Xia ruofei arrived at the villa’s courtyard, Lu You’s car had just driven in.

She stepped down from the MINI BMW with a faint smile on her face. She walked straight to Xia ruofei and handed him the red flannel bag.”Here, the Jade you wanted.”

“So fast?”

Although he had guessed Lu You’s intention, Xia ruofei was still a little surprised.

He took the red flannel bag and said with a smile,””Thanks!”

He didn’t open it to check. Lu You already knew his requirements for the Jade. Since she brought this piece of white jade over, it definitely met his requirements. Xia ruofei trusted Lu You very much.

Xia ruofei asked,”by the way, how much did it cost?” Give me your account number and I’ll transfer the money to you. ” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“I don’t want money.” Lu You said indifferently.

The smile on Xia ruofei’s face froze and he quickly said,””How can I do that? You’ve already helped me solve a big problem by buying the Jade that meets my requirements. How can I let you spend money on it?”

“It’s not worth much, just take it as a gift from me!” Lu You said.

“No, no, no!” Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”this grade of sheep – Fat white jade is not cheap. You’re a student without any source of income. I can’t take it!”

“Then you can return it to me!” Lu You extended his hand to Xia ruofei and said,”I won’t ask for money anyway.”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile bitterly and said,””Lu You ... This item is too valuable. I can’t take it for free. Besides, where did you get so much money to buy jade?”

He knew that Lu You didn’t live as luxuriously as the children of some high – ranking officials. Tian Huilan had always taught her not to have the thought of having special privileges. In fact, Lu You had done the same. Among her University classmates, the number of people who knew that her mother was Tian Huilan could be counted on one hand. The most valuable thing was this car, and it was a birthday gift from Tian Huixin. It was unlike in some offices where changing cars was as easy as changing clothes. It was as if he was afraid that others didn’t know that his father was corrupt and accepting bribes.

Such a large piece of sheep – Fat white jade would cost at least a few hundred thousand Yuan. Where did Lu You get so much money?

“I didn’t say that I bought it!” Lu You pouted.

Xia ruofei was a little surprised. Then ...”

He even thought maliciously,”could it be that someone gave it to Secretary Tian and Lu You secretly took it out?” Secretary Tian’s face was full of righteousness. He didn’t look like a corrupt official!

If Lu You knew what Xia ruofei was thinking, she would definitely be so angry that she would snatch the White jade back. Fortunately, she was not a worm in Xia ruofei’s stomach.

So she thought for a while and said,””My aunt gave this to me a few years ago. I haven’t had the chance to process it. Since you need it, I’ll give it to you!”

When Xia ruofei heard this, he quickly opened the red flannel bag and took out the suet white jade.

The Jade material was absolutely in line with the requirements. There was not a single trace of impurity in the whole body, and it was extremely warm and moist in his hand. Moreover, the size was much larger than what he had requested.

In fact, this was a whole piece of Jade, but the edges had been simply polished, and one side was carved with some faint symbols. It looked more like a semi – finished product.

Xia ruofei believed Lu You’s words immediately.

As for why Tian Huixin would give Lu You a half – finished piece of Jade that was not processed and not a Jade that was made, Xia ruofei could not figure it out.

Perhaps it was a Special Hobby of the rich? For the rich young mistress of Hengfeng group, a piece of high – Quality Jade didn’t seem to be much.

Even though he believed Lu You’s words, Xia ruofei was still a little hesitant. Even if Lu You didn’t spend any money on this piece of Jade, its value was real! How could he just accept something that was worth hundreds of thousands?

Seeing that Xia ruofei was still hesitating, Lu You furrowed her brows and said,””Xia ruofei, I’m just giving you a piece of Jade. Do you have to be so conflicted?”

“No, no...” Xia ruofei smiled awkwardly.

“Just take it as a thank you gift from me!” Lu You said seriously,”if you hadn’t rushed over to save me in time, the consequences would have been unimaginable. Could it be that my life is worth less than this small piece of Jade?”

Since Lu You had already said so much, Xia ruofei had no choice but to accept it.

“Then I’ll accept it ...” Xia ruofei said.”Lu You, thank you!”

Lu You finally revealed a satisfied smile and said,””That’s the way! But you don’t have to thank me! Didn’t you already agree to one of my conditions? It’ll be fine as long as you’re willing to fulfill my request!”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei also smiled.

“Oh right, wait a moment!” He said after some thought.

Xia ruofei put the White jade into the red velvet bag and turned around to walk into the villa.

He kept the woolen bag in the space where Lu You’s line of sight was blocked.

Xia ruofei was not worried that the sheep – Fat white jade would be absorbed by the spirit map’s space. The booklet had mentioned that the soul puppet could be used in the space. This meant that the White jade could also exist in the space. Otherwise, as the core of the soul puppet, if the White jade was absorbed by the space, the soul puppet would become a puppet without any ability to think or move.
