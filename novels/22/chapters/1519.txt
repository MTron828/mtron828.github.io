“You still have three breaths of time ...” The “dried corpse” calmly said.

Xia ruofei heaved a long sigh of relief, but the spirit body’s expression changed. She said hurriedly,””You even ...”

“Two breaths!” The “mummified corpse” interrupted the spirit body and spoke without any emotion.

The spirit body’s face revealed a struggling expression. It was obvious that its heart was fluctuating violently.

At this moment, the “mummified corpse” sitting in the copper coffin began to glow with a circulating light, especially its pair of withered hands, which emitted a kind of metallic luster.

The spirit body’s expression changed and he shouted,””Stop! I give up!”

Obviously, the spirit body had already realized that the “mummified corpse” was gathering power. She had no doubt that once the time was up, the “mummified corpse” would jump out of the coffin without hesitation.

At that time, it would be a situation where they would fight to the death, and there was a high probability that both of them would end up dead.

The spirit body had been suffering in this Cold Stone room for two hundred years, and she had lived in the state of a pure soul. It could be seen that she also cherished her life very much. Under such pressure, she did not dare to take the risk.

Mummified seemed to have expected this outcome. He smiled and said,””Don’t try to stall for time. Leave the woman’s body immediately!”

The spirit body glared at the dried corpse and then turned back to glare at Xia ruofei with killing intent. It then nodded unwillingly. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Xia ruofei stared at Song Wei’s body and saw a black mist coming out of her forehead. Then, it quickly entered an eight – trigram pattern in the corner of the stone room and disappeared in an instant.

After the spirit body left, Song Wei’s body suddenly went limp and she fell to the ground with her eyes closed.

Xia ruofei quickly went over to help her up. At the same time, he looked up at the ‘dried corpse’ in the coffin and said,””Many thanks for senior’s rescue!”

The “corpse” stared at Xia ruofei with its cloudy eyes for a long time before it grinned and said,””You’re his successor, I can’t just sit by and do nothing ...”

Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat and he quickly asked,””Senior, may I ask who is the ‘he’ you are talking about?”

The ‘dry corpse’ was not surprised at all. He chuckled and said,””That guy is still the same as before, always trying to be mysterious and keep people in suspense. However, since he didn’t take the initiative to reveal it, I can’t bring him down. It’s better for you to slowly find out in the future ...”

“This ...” Xia ruofei’s mind was filled with thoughts.”Alright ...”

The “dried corpse” in front of him seemed to have some connection with Xia ruofei. However, Xia ruofei could not be sure who the “he” that the “dried corpse” was referring to was. Could it be the previous owner of the spirit map? If that was the case, how did he see through it?

The ‘dry corpse’ seemed to have guessed Xia ruofei’s thoughts. He smiled and said,””Boy, stop guessing. The cultivation technique of your lineage is very special. I could clearly sense it even when I was hiding in the bronze coffin. It’s just that that crazy woman didn’t have much contact with your lineage, so she only felt a little afraid and didn’t discover anything ...”

Xia ruofei immediately understood. The ‘dried corpse’ must be referring to the ‘great Dao formula’.

However, this “great Dao chant” was recorded in the Jade talisman of inheritance. He didn’t know if it was the cultivation method of the previous master of the spirit map world or if he had collected it from somewhere.

From the tone of this “corpse,” it seemed that the lineage that inherited the “great Dao Arts” was not simple.

Xia ruofei had too many questions in his mind, but the ‘dried corpse’ did not seem to want to delve into this topic.

He said directly,”alright, little guy. Your cultivation is too low. It’s better for you not to know many things. You’ll naturally know when it’s time for you to know in the future!” Also, I can’t open the coffin for too long. This place is still too dangerous for you. It’s not a place you can come to now. I’ll send you out now!”

“Senior!” Xia ruofei quickly said. My friend, she ...”

“She’s fine,” The “mummified corpse” said,”however, there will definitely be damage to the soul. I don’t know if that crazy woman did anything sneaky before she left. Your bloodline is very good at nourishing the soul. You should be able to handle it.”

Xia ruofei was confused. He was good at nourishing souls? Why didn’t he know about it? How could he wake Song Wei up? Xia ruofei was confused by the ‘dried corpse’s words.

However, before he could ask for more advice, the ‘dry corpse’ said,””You guys should leave!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Xia ruofei felt a flash in front of him and closed his eyes subconsciously.

Then, he felt a pulling force, as if the world was spinning. Even with his cultivation, he had no room to resist.

Xia ruofei heard the ‘dry corpse’ s ‘voice.””Remember, don’t come here again before you break through to the nascent soul realm, or your life will be in danger ...”

Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat. He knew that this underground Palace was full of unknown dangers. What he and Song Wei had seen might only be the tip of the iceberg. He naturally listened to this senior’s warning. Furthermore, he had already gotten what he wanted this time. He had also unexpectedly obtained a lot of spiritual crystals and time array flags. It could be said that he had exceeded his mission. Therefore, before he broke through to the nascent soul realm, he would definitely not take the risk to go to the underground palace.
