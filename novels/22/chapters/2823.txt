2824 Continuous fermentation_

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said with a smile,””Director Zhou, I think the club has noticed this public opinion, but it’s not a big deal, so they haven’t reported it to you yet. Even as a leader, you can’t take care of everything. Look at me, I basically don’t interfere with the company’s specific Affairs!”

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but burst out laughing. Ling Qingxue even chuckled and said,”This is the first time I’ve seen someone talk about slacking off in such a fresh and refined way!”

Zhou leiyun could not help but chuckle as well. “I’m born to work hard. I don’t have such good fortune like you, President Xia!”

However, he still accepted Xia ruofei’s suggestion and dismissed the idea of calling the club’s press officer. Although Zhou leiyun claimed that he had a hard life, that was directed at the entire company. Although the Spanish club had a special strategic position in the company, it was only a small part of his business.

Furthermore, Zhou leiyun had never interfered with the club’s operations, including the manager’s tactical arrangements. It was not easy for Chinese people to run a Football Club in Europe and get the recognition of the local players and fans. If they still gave orders about the operation of the club, it would be easier to arouse the disgust of the locals.

Of course, due to the addition of Xia ruofei and Wu Lei, as well as their outstanding performance in the game, the Spanish players and fans had no resistance to the change of their boss to a Chinese.

In the world of football, strength spoke for itself.

Zhou leiyun could not help but ask,””Director Xia, I heard you on the phone just now. It seems that you have arranged for people to follow up on this matter. Many Chinese netizens have been mobilized?”

Xia ruofei laughed and pointed at Song Wei,””This was our female Zhuge’s idea! We felt that if the club or the player himself came out to refute the reporter’s remarks, it would be a bit too much of an honor for him. Objectively, it would also cooperate with his hype, so we finally decided to mobilize the power of netizens and translated his Facebook post screenshots and posted them on major domestic platforms. Sure enough, the netizens spontaneously formed a group to climb over the wall and attack him!”

“There’s such a thing!” Zhou leiyun said in surprise.

“Pablo’s Facebook has been taken over by Chinese netizens!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”nowadays, there are a large number of Chinese netizens flooding into his Facebook to leave messages. However, this guy is quite thick – skinned. He’s being scolded by so many people and he’s still feeling smug, thinking that he’s going to be famous ...”

Xia ruofei repeated what Qin Yanan had just reported to him to Zhou leiyun, then said,””He’s jumping around happily now. Maybe he thinks this is a chance to stand out! However, the fate of this kind of clown is destined. The more he jumps, the more painful it will be when he falls!”

Zhou leiyun furrowed his brows. After a moment of silence, he said,”President Xia, I think the club can’t keep silent at this time. We have to make our own voice, or what will the fans think? Even if it’s going to increase this reporter’s popularity, he has to make a sound!”

“Of course!” Xia ruofei said,”however, as the club chairman, you don’t have to personally interfere in such a matter. If the club managers can’t even see this, it means that they are not qualified. If they need to be replaced, then so be it! Let’s just treat this public opinion incident as a test. ”

Zhou leiyun slowly nodded his head and said,””You’re right, President Xia!”

Although the public opinion had developed very quickly and Pablo was in a state of excitement, it was not a big deal to Xia ruofei and Zhou leiyun. Hence, after exchanging their opinions, they did not talk about it anymore.

Very quickly, everyone finished their dinner. Xia ruofei, Song Wei, and Ling Qingxue returned to their rooms to rest. Zhou leiyun also returned to his Manor in the wealthy district of Barcelona. Everyone agreed to visit a few of the attractions in Barcelona the next day. After all, it was Song Wei and Ling Qingxue’s first time Spain. There were many places that they had not been to yet.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue still stayed in the same room. The two girls seemed to have reached a tacit understanding and did not stay alone with Xia ruofei. Staying in the same room could improve their relationship and at the same time, it was a form of supervision.

Naturally, Xia ruofei could only return to his room in disappointment.

He took out a piece of origin crystal from the space, sat cross – legged on the bed, and began to cultivate.

After the ‘great Dao chant’ began to operate, his true Qi was constantly transformed into vital Qi. Now, most of the true Qi in his body had already been transformed into vital Qi, and the remaining small part was also completing the transformation at a very fast speed.

Once all the genuine Qi was transformed into primordial Qi, a golden core cyclone would be formed in the dantian, and a golden core would gradually be condensed.

The formation of a cyclone marked the true step of a cultivator into the Golden core stage.

Luo Qingfeng, the soul slave that Xia ruofei had tamed, was actually at this stage.

As long as a cultivator could cultivate a golden core Qi cyclone, the strength of the cultivator would immediately increase by a large margin. Basically, unless the cultivator in the Qi refining stage was particularly heaven – defying, it was impossible for them to be the opponent of a cultivator in the Golden core Qi cyclone stage.
