Therefore, whether this would be effective was still unknown.

In any case, it was not a bad thing to circulate one’s cultivation technique inside. At the very least, it could increase one’s cultivation. After all, the concentration of spirit Qi in the seven Star Pavilion was not bad. However, Chen Nanfeng was worried that the seven Star Pavilion would consume too much spirit Qi. Therefore, other than opening it to disciples who met the requirements, he did not allow anyone to enter at any other time, let alone allow anyone to cultivate inside.

Of course, what everyone used this time was actually Chen Nanfeng’s vital Qi. To be more precise, it should be the liquefied elemental essence that was even more concentrated than vital Qi. After Chen Nanfeng broke through to the Golden core stage, the vital Qi in his body had already been compressed into liquefied elemental essence.

“Thank you for your advice, Mr. Xia!” Shen Hu quickly said.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”it’s just a small matter. You’re welcome.” Perhaps the people from the first heaven society will remind everyone before we enter the seven Star Pavilion.”

As they were talking, Chen Xuan walked into the main hall of Empyrean one Pavilion.

The cultivators who were in the middle of their discussion immediately fell silent as they turned to look at Chen Xuan.

Chen Xuan walked to the front of the hall and smiled.””Fellow Daoists, I’ve been waiting for a long time! In order to thank all of you for coming all the way here to witness my father’s breakthrough to the nascent soul realm, the first heaven society has brought out our sect’s treasure, the seven Star Pavilion, to provide a chance for all of you to improve your talent!”

The moment Chen Xuan’s words left his mouth, it was as if a bombshell had been thrown into the crowd. Everyone was instantly agitated as they began to ask questions one after another.

Of course, Chen Xuan wasn’t going to answer so many questions at the same time. He couldn’t answer them one by one.

He only waited for everyone’s voices to quieten down a little before he pressed his hands down slightly. Then, he briefly introduced the function of the seven Star Pavilion to increase one’s talent.

“The disciples of the first heaven society only have one chance to enter the seven Star Pavilion before they reach the Golden core stage. Therefore, this is a very rare opportunity. 1 hope that all of you will seize it!” If anyone has any questions, you can ask them on the spot!”

A cultivator immediately stood up and asked,”may I ask sect leader Chen Ye, what do we need to do after entering the seven Star Pavilion?” How do we know that our talent has improved?”

Chen Xuan smiled.”The seven Star Pavilion will conduct its own selection process. So, in theory, you don’t have to do anything after you enter the seven Star Pavilion. As long as you receive the recognition of the seven Star Pavilion, your talent will naturally increase. Of course, we suggest that after entering the seven Star Pavilion, you can cultivate the cultivation technique that you are best at on the spot. This should increase your success rate more or less. As for whether your talent has improved or not, you should know it best!”

When the cultivators heard this, they couldn’t help but laugh.

If one’s talent was improved, the cultivator’s senses would be the keenest. Therefore, the cultivator’s second question was indeed a bit ridiculous.

However, Chen Xuan immediately replied in a serious tone,””Of course, there’s a simpler way to judge. If you leave the seven Star Pavilion without obtaining any other benefits, such as spirit stones, storage rings, or even flying swords, then returning empty – handed means that your talent should have been improved. The only difference is the extent of the improvement.”

The seven Star Pavilion would never allow anyone to return – handed. If one’s talent did not improve, there would definitely be other benefits. Therefore, Chen Xuan’s method was the most direct one.

Otherwise, some cultivators might not even feel it clearly when their talents were slightly improved. However, Chen Xuan’s method was definitely accurate.

At least from his past experience, it was absolutely accurate.

“Sect leader Chen, may I ask if there is any danger in the seven Star Pavilion?” another cultivator asked.

This was also a question that everyone wanted to ask. After all, most of the people here were Qi condensation cultivators with very low cultivation levels. If the seven Star Pavilion was too dangerous, then even if there was a slight chance to improve their talent, many people might retreat.

Therefore, when this cultivator raised this question, almost everyone perked up their ears.

Of course, Xia ruofei, Mu Sheng, Liu Mansha, and the other golden core cultivators were the exceptions. Regardless of whether the seven Star Pavilion was in danger or not, they would definitely not back down.

Chen Xuan smiled.”Up until now, the first heaven society’s disciples have not encountered any danger in the seven Star Pavilion. There have been no casualties either. The only difference is the amount of gains.” Of course, the seven Star Pavilion is a very mysterious treasure, so 1 can’t give you any guarantees here!”

Everyone heaved a sigh of relief upon hearing this. Even if Chen Xuan didn’t make any guarantees, the fact that there were no casualties in the past was enough to prove that the seven Star Pavilion was extremely safe.

If there were still people who didn’t dare to enter, then they were cultivators in vain. Such people were destined to have no achievements.

Following that, a few more cultivators asked Chen Xuan a few more questions. Chen Xuan did not show any signs of impatience and answered them one by one.

In the end, Chen Xuan saw that everyone was eager to give it a try. Hence, he smiled and said,””If there are no other questions, everyone should get ready. We will open the seven Star Pavilion immediately!”

With that, one of the executing – Disciples beside Chen Xuan nodded his head. The disciple immediately understood and ran towards the back of the hall. Chen Xuan raised his hand and made an inviting gesture, saying,””My fellow Daoists, please!”

After saying that, he took the lead and walked to the back. The cultivators who came to observe the assembly also quickly followed him and walked out of the hall in a single file to the back of the hall.

This was a very spacious garden. In the middle of the garden, there was an exquisite Pavilion – shaped magic treasure. On the plaque above the pavilion’s door, three big words were written: “seven stars Pavilion.”

However, this magic treasure was only half the height of a person. Let alone accommodating more than a hundred cultivators present, it was likely that it couldn’t even fit a person.

Of course, they were all knowledgeable cultivators, so they didn’t question him. Besides, other than the most eye – catching Seven Star Pavilion, there was also a great God sitting quietly in the corner. This person was Chen Nanfeng.

The cultivators didn’t dare to be negligent and quickly bowed to Chen Nanfeng.

Chen Nanfeng was meditating with his eyes closed. He opened his eyes when he heard the sound of footsteps. He nodded at everyone and smiled.”Fellow Daoists, you’re all here. Xuan ‘er should have explained the opportunity to everyone just now. I’ll open the seven Star Pavilion now. Of course, this opportunity is entirely voluntary. If there are fellow Daoists who don’t want to enter, we won’t force you. The first heaven society will present you with a gift as a token of gratitude!”

“Many thanks, sect leader Chen!”

“Sect leader Chen has given us such a good opportunity. How can we not know what’s good for us?!

“No one would be willing to give up such a rare opportunity!”

The cultivators said one after another.

Chen Nanfeng smiled.’After all, everyone has their own ambitions. If any fellow Daoist is unwilling to enter the seven Star Pavilion, we will fully understand. There’s no need to have any concerns.” I’m going to open the seven Star Pavilion now!”

After saying that, Chen Nanfeng’s expression turned serious. He moved his fingers as if they were flying, and in the blink of an eye, he had formed countless seals. Golden Seals that could be seen with the naked eye flew one after another into the seven stars Pavilion, which was located in the center of the back garden.

The seven stars Pavilion suddenly trembled slightly, and the extent of the trembling was getting greater and greater.

After a short while, the seven Star Pavilion shook violently and then began to expand.

In just a few breaths ‘time, the seven Star Pavilion had grown to the size of a normal three – story Pavilion. It stood in the center of the garden in the back hall, as if it was one with the garden.

Xia ruofei saw this scene from the crowd and understood why there was nothing in the middle of the garden. It was a space reserved for the seven Star Pavilion. It was probably where the seven Star Pavilion was opened in the past. The entire garden was designed according to the seven Star Pavilion. That was why the seven Star Pavilion was able to integrate with the garden after it was activated. It seemed to be very harmonious.

Chen Nanfeng’s face also revealed a trace of satisfaction, and the corners of his mouth curled up slightly, revealing a slight smile..
