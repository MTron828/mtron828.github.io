Chapter 1742: The King’s Woman (2)

After the two of them followed each other, Song Wei asked again,””Have you thought of what your first Weibo post will be?”

“I wanted to post a photo, but I didn’t find a suitable one.” Xia ruofei said,”why don’t you just send a few simple words?”

“Don ‘t!” Song Wei said,”this is the first Weibo post! I can’t make do with this! Isn’t it simple if there are no photos? I’ll take a picture for you now!”

“I don’t think so ...” Xia ruofei hesitated.

“Don’t say no!” Song Wei grabbed Xia ruofei’s phone and said,”come, come, come, let’s POSE! I’ll definitely take a beautiful picture of you! Then, I’ll beautify you!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile bitterly. He hurriedly said,””Please don ‘t! I don’t rely on my face to make a living! The original flavor is good!”

After he finished speaking, Xia ruofei still cooperated and smiled.

Song Wei took a few photos and then took her phone to Xia ruofei. She said, “Let’s see the effect!”

Then, Song Wei opened the photo album on her phone and looked through the photos with Xia ruofei.

Song Wei’s photoshoots were quite interesting. Although the sky was already dark, she used the lighting skillfully. The composition of the pictures was also very good. In addition, the phone’s photo – taking function was quite powerful. The photos looked really good.

Xia ruofei was sitting on a deck chair under the grape trellis with a purple clay teapot in his hand. Although the background was blurred, one could still see the antique courtyard, the Lotus VAT, the pomegranate trees, and so on. At first glance, it gave off a leisurely feeling.

“I’ll take this!” Xia ruofei was very satisfied.

“You really don’t need to beautify your face?” Song Wei asked,”I’m pretty good at it! Others definitely won’t be able to tell!”

Xia ruofei quickly snatched the phone and said,””No need, no need!”

Then, he opened Weibo and chose to post a new post. After selecting the picture, he pondered for a while and typed a sentence: “Three cups of wine for the boundless secular world, a pot of tea for the great cause of a thousand years.”

Xia ruofei had always liked these two lines of the poem. Coupled with the photo, it was quite fitting, so he typed without hesitation.

“Done!” Xia ruofei mumbled to himself and gently pressed the button.

“I’ll go and like your post!” Song Wei said cheekily. Then, she really used her phone to find the Weibo post. However, her hands were a little slow. When she opened the Weibo post, it had already received more than ten likes.

It had only been a few seconds! Could it be that someone had been staring at Xia ruofei’s empty Weibo and refreshing it? Song Wei liked the post unhappily. She wanted to be the first person to like it.

Xia ruofei found it funny and said,””Let’s go! Time for dinner!”

The two of them walked to the backyard together, chatting as they walked.

Xia ruofei and Song Wei did not know that the Weibo platform had really started a small craze after Xia ruofei entered the company ...

This craze was not only because of Xia ruofei’s first Weibo post, but also because of their “mutual following”.

Although Xia ruofei’s new account had gained tens of thousands of fans and the number was still rising, the number of followers remained at zero until he followed Song Wei’s normal account,”VIVI”...

One must know that Xia ruofei did not usually use Weibo. In addition, after completing the task assigned by Feng Jing, he had gone out to eat with Song Wei, so he did not even have the time to follow the official Weibo of Tao Yuan company.

One could only imagine how eye – catching the lone “VIVI” in the follow column was ...

Of course, the two of them were completely unaware of this and walked straight to the backyard. As expected, Wu Qiang had already prepared dinner. When he saw Xia ruofei and Song Wei walking over, he quickly went up to them.

As for Song Wei’s change of clothes, and the fact that the two of them had just taken a bath, Wu Qiang chose to ignore it. He said respectfully,””President Xia, do you want to have dinner now?”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” Let’s eat in the small restaurant!”

There was a small dining room next to the kitchen. When there were not many people, Xia ruofei would usually dine there.

“Okay, please wait a moment. I’ll bring the dishes out!” Wu Qiang said.

The dishes had already been prepared in advance and kept warm in the kitchen. Wu Qiang quickly served the dishes.

Xia ruofei was not a person with many rules. When he ate at home, he would let Wu Qiang eat at the table with him. Today was no exception. Wu Qiang was also used to Xia ruofei’s approachable style and did not reject too much. After filling a bowl of rice for Xia ruofei and Song Wei, he also filled his own bowl and sat on the other side of the table. He began to eat.

Xia ruofei took a bite of food and a mouthful of rice. As he chewed, he said,””Wu Qiang, it’s too hard for you to manage everything here alone. Didn’t I tell you last time to help me find a few more people? At least you can hire an Auntie to do the cleaning and cooking!”

Wu Qiang quickly said,”director Xia, these tasks are not much. Moreover, you don’t stay in the capital for long. I can do it by myself. There’s no need to increase the expenses ...”

“There’s no need to save on this kind of money!” Xia ruofei said,”you’re here to help me take care of the yard. You’re mainly in charge of safety. At most, you’ll be my driver! Leave the other matters to others. ”

Xia ruofei wasn’t as extravagant as Tang Yitian’s family to hire a large group of gardeners and chefs. Chefs were also divided into Chinese and Western chefs. However, he didn’t want Wu Qiang to be busy with everything alone. Although it wasn’t too tiring, he couldn’t do it as a boss.

“This ...” Wu Qiang still wanted to persuade Xia ruofei because he felt that there was no need to. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei’s attitude was firm.””Wu Qiang, stop talking! At the very least, he would need to hire two more people to do the cleaning and cooking. I wanted to ask you to recommend two, so that you can cooperate with me. If you don’t do it, I’ll hire them myself!”

“Don ‘t! President Xia, I’ll go and look around!” Wu Qiang quickly said.

He was indeed loyal to Xia ruofei and had considered this matter with the intention of saving Xia ruofei’s money. However, Xia ruofei would not care about such a small expense. Now that Xia ruofei was so determined, he would definitely be inclined to look for her himself. After all, he still had many poor relatives!

Wu Qiang did not even ask Xia ruofei about the salary as he knew that Xia ruofei would not treat his employees shabbily.

Xia ruofei nodded in satisfaction and said,””I’ll give you a week’s time. I hope that the personnel will be in place before I leave the capital. ”

“Yes, President Xia!” Wu Qiang puffed out his chest and said,”I promise to complete the mission!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you don’t have to be so serious. This isn’t the Army ... By the way, does your wife have a job?” If not, then let her come over!”

Wu Qiang scratched his head in embarrassment and said,””President Xia, I don’t have a partner yet!”

Wu Qiang had been busy making money to support his family all these years. Where would he have the time to find a partner? His relatives in his hometown had introduced him to a few, but when they heard about his family situation, they didn’t say anything.

Xia ruofei was also a little surprised. Wu Qiang was already in his early thirties. He had thought that Wu Qiang had already married and that his wife was just in his hometown.

This time, it was Xia ruofei’s turn to feel awkward. He said,””Why didn’t you say so earlier! I’ll ask brother Zhao and the others to introduce you to some girls! Such a good person has actually become an older youth, there’s simply no justice!”

Wu Qiang’s dark face turned red as he said embarrassedly,”President Xia, I’m not in a hurry ...”

“It’s decided then!” Xia ruofei said,”since you don’t have a partner, you can look at your relatives or something, as long as you can trust them. Of course, it’s best if they have some cooking skills so that you won’t have to cook in the future.”

Wu Qiang’s heart felt warm as he said,”referee!” President Xia, don’t worry!”

While Xia ruofei and Wu Qiang were chatting, Song Wei felt a little bored. She could not help but take out her phone to scroll through Weibo. She suddenly exclaimed,”Heavens! What was going on? How did I suddenly gain so many fans on Weibo?”

Soon, Song Wei realized that not only did she have more than a thousand fans, but many of them had also sent her private messages.

“Close up! The King’s Woman!”

” I really envy you! Are you with my idol?!”

“Actually, I’ve always liked you in secret. You’re so outstanding that my heart wavered and I couldn’t extricate myself! Today, I’ve finally mustered up the courage to ask you this: Can I have President Xia’s signature?”

When Song Wei saw this, she had a flash of inspiration and immediately realized something. She quickly opened Xia ruofei’s Weibo and after scanning through it, she immediately revealed an awkward smile.
