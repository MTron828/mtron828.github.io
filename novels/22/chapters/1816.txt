Chapter 1817: The heart – coagulating grass ripened (2)

Translator: 549690339

Xia Qing had been taking care of the heart – concentrating grass for the past three days and had put aside everything else at hand. After Xia ruofei asked, he immediately replied,””Master, it should be almost done in a while!”

“How many spiritual crystals did you consume?” Xia ruofei asked with concern.

Spiritual crystals were too precious. Even a little bit of it would make Xia ruofei’s heart ache.

Xia Qing replied,”don’t worry, master. It’s almost as we expected!” The fourth spiritual crystal has just been consumed. I guess there will be about half a spiritual crystal left when this heart concentrating grass matures!”

Xia ruofei heaved a sigh of relief. Although he was pained to spend four and a half crystals, it was still within his “budget”.

“You continue to take care of the heart concentrating grass. Don’t make any mistakes at the last moment.” Xia ruofei said,”when the heart concentrating grass is ripe, inform me immediately!”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing replied.

Xia ruofei started the car and left the airport, heading in the direction of Taoyuan farm.

It was already dark when they returned to the farm. However, Xia ruofei could see from afar that many offices in the complex were still lit up. The canteen on the first floor was still open.

It turned out that they had decided to move in three days in the morning, so Dong Yun immediately started moving when she returned to the farm. All the departments were mobilized. Everyone was willing to work overtime today, sorting out their personal belongings and documents on their computers.

Dong Yun had even specially informed the canteen to postpone the closing time for today.

Seeing that the cafeteria was still “open”, Xia ruofei was too lazy to go back and prepare food. He drove the car directly to the general office building, then quickly walked up the steps and into the cafeteria on the first floor.

Seeing Xia ruofei enter, Mrs. Cao quickly came up to greet him.

Xia ruofei said,”sister – in – Law, just make me some porridge and side dishes. My lunch was too greasy.”

“Alright!” Mrs. Cao said, then turned around and asked the kitchen staff to prepare dinner for Xia ruofei.

“Are there many people eating today?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Less than usual,” Mrs. Cao said.”But many departments called to say that their people are working overtime. They asked us to keep the food warm and wait for them ...”

“When these guys heard that they were moving to the city to work, they were all very excited ... But no matter how busy they are, they can’t skip meals!” Mrs. Cao mumbled. Can’t you work overtime after dinner?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”the moving time is a little tight this time. Everyone is working overtime!” Moreover, sometimes, when the data migration was halfway done, they couldn’t just leave it alone. They had to finish it before they could leave! Sister – in – Law, you’ll have to work hard these two days!”

“We didn’t work hard!” Mrs. Cao smiled and said,”I’m just going home a little later! He had nothing to do at night. I’m just feeling sorry for this group of young men and women. They’re all made of iron!”

“That’s right,” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’ll go up and take a look after we’re done eating. I’ll chase those who haven’t eaten down!”

Xia ruofei did not put on any airs. Even if Mrs. Cao was just a cafeteria worker, he could still chat with her for a long time.

Soon, the porridge and side dishes that Xia ruofei ordered were served. After he finished eating, he strode upstairs and patrolled the office area.

As expected, many people were working overtime to sort out their things. Dong Yun did not go home after work. Instead, she patrolled the offices of various departments and constantly arranged work.

“President Dong!” Xia ruofei waved at Dong Yun.

“Chairman, why did you come here in person?” Dong Yun came over and asked. Don’t worry! There won’t be any problems moving in three days!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’m a little worried that time is too tight and everyone is tired.” Now it seems that my worry was right. I heard that many people didn’t go down for dinner and are still working overtime in the office. How can that be? Tell all the employees who haven’t eaten to go to the cafeteria. If there’s any work that needs people, find the employees who have eaten to cover for a while!”

Dong Yun was also someone who would forget herself when she was working. She didn’t even eat dinner. In fact, she didn’t even notice that it was already dark outside.

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Dong Yun looked at her watch and said embarrassedly,””Chairman, I understand! I’ll make the arrangements!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”pay attention to the balance between work and rest. If the workload is too heavy, some things can be pushed back. We’ll move in three days. Actually, the most important thing is the opening ceremony. After that, we’ll move most of the things in. It’s enough as long as the company can maintain normal operations. The rest can be moved slowly later!”

Xia ruofei was worried that Dong Yun was too perfectionist and would tire out the entire company.

“Yes, Chairman.” Dong Yun said seriously. However, Xia ruofei was not sure if she was listening to him.

“Let’s call everyone to eat first!” Xia ruofei said,”by the way, I’ll go and tidy up my personal belongings in my office. You guys can handle the rest.”

“Understood!” Dong Yun said.

After Xia ruofei finished speaking, he turned around and left the large office area. He walked back to his own office. Dong Yun called for the employees who had not had time to eat to put aside their work and head to the cafeteria for dinner.

In fact, Xia ruofei did not have many personal items in his office. He was used to storing his commonly used items in the spirit map space so that he could use them whenever he wanted.

Xia ruofei tidied up his office. He could have just kept his things in the spirit map space, but after some thought, he felt that he couldn’t just leave empty – handed after all the packing. The employees would inevitably be suspicious when they saw this.

Hence, Xia ruofei found a cardboard box in the corridor. Since they had already planned to move the headquarters, Dong Yun had already ordered a batch of cardboard boxes with Tao Yuan company’s LOGO printed on them. Today, when everyone started to pack their things, these cardboard boxes had also been moved out from the warehouse and placed in the corridor of the office. Anyone who needed them could use them at any time.

Xia ruofei put everything into the cardboard box and carried it downstairs.

As he walked, Xia ruofei’s mind was filled with scenes he often saw in television dramas. A person who was fired by the company packed his personal belongings with a depressed face and left with heavy steps. The other colleagues looked at him with sympathy, indifference, and gloating ...

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. His current appearance was really similar to the unlucky ones he often saw on TV.

When Xia ruofei arrived at the canteen, there were already many employees there. Dong Yun was also having dinner.

When they saw Xia ruofei enter, the employees greeted him. Xia ruofei also smiled at them as he walked towards Dong Yun.

After asking if anyone was still working overtime with an empty stomach, Xia ruofei found out that all the employees who had not eaten were here. He gave his office key to Dong Yun and gave them a few words of encouragement before returning to the villa with the cardboard box.

Just as Xia ruofei was packing his things, Xia Qing had already informed him of the news that the heart concentrating grass had matured.

Hence, when he returned to the villa, Xia ruofei placed the box on the coffee table in the living room. Then, he quickly went upstairs, locked the doors and windows, and summoned the spirit map space. He entered the space with a thought.

The Archean realm.

At this time, the time array flags around the heart concentrating grass had been removed. The heart concentrating grass in the center of the array was almost the same as when he first came to the upper realm Spirit Island.

As time flowed 30 times faster in the Archean realm, the heart – concentrating grass absorbed spirit Qi very quickly too. Therefore, the spirit gathering formation was not removed, and the spirit crystals around the formation were also not taken away.

One of the spiritual crystals was undamaged, while the other was much dimmer. It was obvious that more than half of the spiritual Qi inside had been absorbed.

There were also spiritual crystals in the other places, but now only a small pile of ashes without any spiritual Qi was left. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Xia ruofei felt as if his heart had been pulled out. He shook his head and said,””Xia Qing, immediately follow the prescription you gave Song Wei last time and brew the medicine as soon as possible. I want to give it to Qingxue!”
