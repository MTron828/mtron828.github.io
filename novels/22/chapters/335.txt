Chapter 336: Expert Xia (1)

The boy in the White branded casual suit was called Peng Hui, and the tall and strong boy next to him was called you Jun. Both of them were members of the gardening club. Of course, the two of them didn’t join the gardening club because they were interested in plant cultivation or bonsai. Instead, it was purely because of Lu You and Jiang Yue. Peng Hui and you Jun, as well as Lu You and Jiang Yue, were all classmates. Peng Hui was attracted by Lu You’s beauty on the first day of university and started to pursue Lu You crazily. Peng Hui’s hometown was in xiangnan province. His family was considered a prominent family in xiangnan province. Several generations of his family had been in business. Although Peng Hui’s father’s generation was not a rich businessman, he still had a family property of tens of millions. Therefore, when Peng Hui was pursuing Lu You, he naturally launched a monetary attack. However, he didn’t expect Lu You to be so rude to him. His “extravagant spending” didn’t even cause a ripple in Lu You’s heart. Lu You was usually very low – Key. Other than her best friend Jiang Yue, no one knew that her mother was a member of the Standing Committee of the southeast Provincial Party Committee and the Secretary of the three mountains Provincial Party Committee. As for his friend’s best friend, you Jun, he had a crush on the shy girl from a humble family, Jiang Yue. However, he was also constantly met with obstacles in his pursuit of Jiang Yue. Therefore, after learning that Lu You and Jiang Yue had joined the gardening club, the two brothers who were in difficult times had also agreed without thinking and applied to join the gardening club. In fact, a large part of the reason why the initially unpopular gardening club had so many members was because of the popularity brought by Lu You and Jiang Yue. Other than Peng Hui and you Jun, many other boys had joined the gardening club because of Lu You and Jiang Yue. As for the guy with gold – rimmed glasses beside Peng Hui and you Jun, even Lu You and Jiang Yue didn’t know him. He probably wasn’t from the gardening club. Upon hearing Lu You’s question, Peng Hui looked deeply at Xia ruofei and said,””Lu You, this is senior brother Chen Song. He is a senior in my high school. He is now a fourth – year student in the gardening major of Southeast Agriculture and Forestry University. He has already been guaranteed a postgraduate degree. He is very strong in his major!” After Chen Song heard Peng Hui’s introduction of himself, he also revealed a trace of unnoticeable pride. Everyone wanted to gain face in front of beautiful women, and Chen Song was no exception. “Hello, junior!” He smiled at Lu You. Lu You furrowed her brows slightly. She merely nodded her head lightly as a form of greeting. “Peng Hui, why are you guys surrounding that pot of orchid?” Lu You asked. Peng Hui immediately showed an expression of wanting to be rewarded and said: “Lu You, isn’t this pot of mo orchid sick? I saw that you’ve been in a hurry these days, so I took the initiative to invite senior brother Chen from the Agriculture and Forestry University. He’s very knowledgeable in plant pests, and he’ll definitely be able to help you solve your problems. ” “Thank you, but there’s no need,” Lu You said calmly.”We’ve already invited an expert to help.” Peng Hui’s expression suddenly changed slightly, saying: “An expert?” His gaze involuntarily fell on Xia ruofei and he asked,””Is this the gentleman?” Lu You nodded her head lightly. She did not want to say much to Peng Hui and only said,””Please move aside, don’t block specialist Xia.” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but have a strange look on his face. Since when did he become “expert Xia”? Nowadays, the word “expert” was not a pleasant title! Especially on the internet, these two words were basically equivalent to ignorant and incompetent people who spoke nonsense. However, Peng Hui did not step aside. He opened his mouth and asked: “This expert looks very young! I wonder which Research Institute you’re working at?” Xia ruofei smiled and was about to clarify when Lu You said,””This has nothing to do with you! Peng Hui, Yueyue and I are in charge of this pot of orchid. We have the final say in who we invite!” “That’s true, but as a member of the gardening club, I still have the responsibility to help you!” Peng Hui was not angry. He continued to smile and said,”moreover, this orchid is going to represent our Sanshan University’s gardening club in the flower exhibition. If it is delayed by unreliable people, it will be a disgrace to our entire gardening club!” “You’re talking nonsense. You’re the unreliable one!” Jiang Yue’s face turned red with anger.”Big brother Xia is very capable. He will definitely be able to cure our orchids!” You Jun’s face turned green when he heard this. He did not expect his goddess to be so protective of a pretty boy. Ever since Xia ruofei started practicing the strange movements from the little golden man, his skin had become fairer and he no longer had the muscular look he had in the Army. The terrifying strength of his body was hidden in his seemingly thin body. “Yue, Peng Hui’s right.” You Jun looked at Xia ruofei with hostility and said,”senior brother Chen is the real knowledgeable person. He also studied orchid cultivation and pest control at the University of Agriculture and Forestry. He’s much more reliable than some so – called experts!” “You Jun, don’t you dare slander brother Xia!” Jiang Yue said angrily,”also, I’ve told you 800 times. Please don’t call me ‘Xiao Yue’ anymore. I’m not close to you!” You Jun’s face turned red and white at once. He looked very embarrassed and resentful at the same time. He couldn’t help but look at Xia ruofei with hostility. At this moment, Chen Song, who had been silent all this while, smiled and asked Xia ruofei,””Sir, it’s very complicated to control pests and diseases for orchids. I’ve also seen this pot of orchid just now. If it’s not treated in time, it may wither and die very soon. I advise you not to show off. Otherwise, you won’t be able to stand out and instead leave a bad impression on the beautiful woman. It’s not worth it.” “Thank you for your concern. However, since I’ve promised Lu You and Jiang Yue, I’ll naturally cure this pot of orchids,” Xia ruofei replied with a faint smile. Lu You and Jiang Yue’s eyes lit up at the same time. Lu You thought that this was more like what Xia ruofei would say! This fellow was still making excuses just now! It seemed that giving him some pressure was quite good ... Jiang Yue, on the other hand, was basically the type of fangirl. No matter what Xia ruofei said, she would find him stunningly handsome. Her pair of bright and beautiful eyes were so bright that it was as if stars were shining in them. Peng Hui and the other two’s faces all became a bit ugly, the three of them looked at each other, and finally it was Peng Hui who gritted his teeth and said: “Lu You, if it were any other plant or potted plant, I definitely wouldn’t interfere. However, this orchid is going to participate in the exhibition. It concerns the reputation of the gardening club and even the entire Sanshan University. I won’t give up so easily. If you insist on your opinion, then let’s go to the president to make a decision!” “Peng Hui, what do you want?” Lu You’s expression was cold as she said,”you’re overstepping your boundaries! Does this orchid have anything to do with you?” “I’m doing this for the horticultural church!” Peng Hui put on an innocent expression and said,”how about this, since you’ve invited this expert Xia over, I think we should let him and senior Chen take a look at this pot of mo orchid. We’ll listen to their analysis and opinions before deciding who to ask for help, is that okay?” Lu You furrowed her brows and wanted to reject him immediately. She was a very strong – willed person by nature. Peng Hui’s actions had already caused her to develop a strong aversion towards Qianqian. This pot of mo orchid was originally the responsibility of her and Jiang Yue. Moreover, the seedlings of the mo orchid were found by her through a friend of her mother. It was a relatively precious species and should be up to her and Jiang Yue to decide how to deal with it. What right did Peng Hui have to interfere? However, before Lu You could speak, Xia ruofei spoke first,””I agree!”Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om
