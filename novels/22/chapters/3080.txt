3081 In a hurry (1)

Xia ruofei watched from the side and couldn’t help but Mutter in his heart,”He had even prepared two flying swords. He was indeed a rich second generation in the cultivation world!

He didn’t know that he had placed a maximum of five flying swords in the spirit map space!

Of course, this was all obtained by himself and not by his father. From this perspective, there was a fundamental difference between him and Chen Xuan.

After Chen Xuan cut the branch off, he took out a long Jade box from his storage ring and placed the wild tea tree branch inside. Then, he rode his flying sword back to Xia ruofei and passed the jade box to him with a smile.

“Brother Xia, this Jade box can better preserve the vitality of the tree branch. I hope it’ll be of some help to the transplanting.” Chen Xuan replied.

Clearly, Chen Xuan had prepared this Jade box in advance.

First, it was the sect leader’s token. Now, it was this Jade box. After knowing that Xia ruofei had come to the first heaven society, Chen Xuan had immediately made sufficient preparations. This made Xia ruofei very happy.

“Many thanks, brother Chen!” Xia ruofei took the jade box and said sincerely,”no matter if the cutting is successful or not, I will owe brother Chen a favor!”

“It’s nothing, brother Xia. There’s no need to worry about it!”Chen Xuan waved his hand and smiled.

Xia ruofei kept the jade box in the spirit map space. This way, the vitality of the branch would be completely preserved and he would not have to worry about it dying with the passage of time.

After that, he and Chen Xuan rode their flying swords down the mountain and returned to the foot of the mountain. They landed their flying swords outside the range of the formation.

The two of them walked up the mountain path. Xia ruofei said,””Brother Chen, I won’t bother you any longer this time. The earlier you transplant these branches, the better. I plan to leave today!”

Chen Xuan was a little surprised.”Brother Xia, there’s an array carved on my Jade box. It shouldn’t be a problem to keep this branch for four to five days. It’s rare for you to come here. You should at least stay for a few more days!” I haven’t even done my part as the host!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”there will be more opportunities in the future!” In the future, when the five Holy badges are all born, I’ll definitely come and disturb you! It’s better to transplant the wild tea trees as soon as possible. I plan to return as soon as possible. ”

Xia ruofei had hesitated a few times today. In the end, he decided not to mention the fact that he had the last five Holy badges. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

This was mainly because he realized that he couldn’t see through Chen Nanfeng’s strength at all after the short meeting. He was even more afraid of the other party’s profound attainments in spiritual power.

Xia ruofei couldn’t predict how things would turn out if he told them about the five – Saint token.

Hence, after much hesitation, Xia ruofei felt that he could not let himself fall into an unknown situation and decided to hide the matter of the five Saints badge for now.

Although master Yuntai had said that the five Holy badges would mysteriously disappear every three or four hundred years and then would only reappear one by one after a few decades, time was already a bit tight now. However, no matter how tight the time was, there was no hurry.

After all, in a span of three to four hundred years, a few days, a few months, or even a few years were actually very short.

If all the five Holy badges had been leaked because of his hesitation, Xia ruofei would just give up.

Seeing that Xia ruofei was determined to leave, Chen Xuan did not ask her to stay.

He said with some regret,”it’s rare to get to know such a young talent like brother Xia. I originally wanted to have a good exchange of cultivation experience with brother Xia!” I didn’t expect that after such a short reunion, brother Xia would be leaving again ...”

“Brother Chen, you come from a well – known family, and your father is one of the top figures in the world of cultivation. The first heaven society has such a deep foundation that you don’t need to exchange any insights with me!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ve only been cultivating for a short time. If we’re talking about learning, I should be learning from brother Chen!”

“Brother Xia, you’re too humble!” Chen Xuan continued,”to be able to break through to the Golden core stage at such a young age, brother Xia is definitely a peerless genius that only appears once in a hundred years. While I may be quite talented, I’m still far from brother Xia. I’m well aware of my own abilities.”

Following which, Chen Xuan laughed out in a carefree manner.””In the past, I always felt that the younger generation’s talents were withered, and that there was always a feeling of loneliness at the top when walking in the cultivation world. It seems that I was too narrow – minded. After meeting brother Xia, I realized that my previous thoughts were like frogs in a well! But it didn’t matter! With such a strong reference like brother Xia, my motivation to cultivate is even more sufficient! Brother Xia, you can’t relax! Who knows, I might surpass you one day!”

“Hahaha! To improve together! We’ll improve together!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Chen Xuan’s words came from the bottom of his heart. Ever since he was young, he had always been the most outstanding person in the eyes of others. In fact, this was true. However, as time passed, he seemed to feel that his motivation to move forward had decreased. Today, when he learned that Xia ruofei had reached the early stage of the Golden core realm at such a young age, it had touched him greatly.

The competitive spirit in his heart rose again.

Naturally, Xia ruofei would not compare himself to Chen Xuan. However, Chen Xuan’s words were to his liking. He even felt like he had a close friend.

Actually, Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan had not known each other for a long time. They had even less time to interact with each other. However, the two of them felt like they hit it off when they chatted. This was due to Chen Xuan’s good upbringing and his gentle and refined demeanor. At the same time, it also showed that the two of them had many common interests.
