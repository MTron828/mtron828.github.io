Chapter 1567: Relieved from a heavy burden (1)

Translator: 549690339

When Song Wei heard Xia ruofei’s words, she raised her head and pulled her collar subconsciously. She blushed and asked,””What ... What are you doing?”

Xia ruofei was confused and said,””To help you get rid of the peach blossom miasma, of course! You’re not thinking of becoming ... That kind of person, are you?”

Song Wei’s heart was in a mess, and she asked in a low voice,”Is ... Is there no other way?”

Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows in confusion.”I didn’t even say it! How do you know what method to use?”

Song Wei felt shy and did not dare to raise her head. She bit her lower lip and said, “Isn’t it just ... Two people ... Doing that?”

Although Song Wei had feelings for Xia ruofei, she was still a conservative girl. She was born in a high – ranking family and her upbringing was very strict. Therefore, she could not accept this so quickly.

However, her body seemed to have a strong desire. If it wasn’t for the cool air that came from her chest from time to time, she would probably throw herself into his arms.

For the first time, Song Wei felt the terror of the peach blossom miasma.

After Xia ruofei heard what song Wei said, he could not help but widen his eyes and said,”Who said that? This ... Song Wei, did you read too many novels?”

Song Wei was dumbfounded. Looking at Xia ruofei’s expression, she realized that she had misunderstood him. After thinking about it, she realized that if the peach blossom miasma could be removed so easily, it would be no different from the love potion in the bars and nightclubs.

Seeing Xia ruofei’s funny expression, Song Wei was embarrassed and annoyed. She glared at Xia ruofei and said,””Who ... Who asked you to not speak clearly?”

“Where did I not make myself clear?” Xia ruofei asked innocently.

“You ... What did you say about needing my cooperation?” Song Wei stomped her feet and said,”it’s very easy to cause a misunderstanding, you know?”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. However, a good man doesn’t fight with a woman. He raised his hands and said,”Alright, alright, alright, I was wrong! I didn’t make myself clear ...”

Song Wei blushed and looked at Xia ruofei.”Quickly say it! This ... How should he solve the peach blossom miasma? I ... I don’t want to become ... That kind of woman ...”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”while you were unconscious, I did two things.” The first is to clear the peach blossom miasma poison in your meridians as much as possible, leaving only the poison in your sea of consciousness that has already contaminated your soul, which can not be cleared for the time being. The second is that I’ve set up a formation and engraved the formation patterns on a jade pendant. It can keep your mind clear to the greatest extent, and at the same time, it has a certain suppressing effect on the poison in the soul. You should be able to feel it ...” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

When Song Wei heard this, she immediately remembered the cool feeling that came from her chest.

She curiously pulled out her necklace and immediately saw that the pendant on her necklace had been replaced with A Doraemon – shaped jade pendant.

Xia ruofei’s Doraemon pendant was very lifelike, and the quality of the Jade was quite good. So, when Song Wei saw it for the first time, she couldn’t help but praise,””What a beautiful Doraemon!”

Xia ruofei was speechless when he saw Song Wei playing with the jade pendant.

This girl’s heart was really big! Just now, he was at his wits ‘end because of the poison! He was still in the mood to admire the jade pendant!

If it was Xia ruofei himself, as long as he could make use of the formation, he didn’t mind even if he had to look like a pile of sh * t.

This was the difference between the brain circuits of men and women.

Xia ruofei was also secretly glad that he had put in some effort to choose this style. Now it seemed that this decision was very correct.

“RUO Fei, did you carve this?” Song Wei asked.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yeah!” The formation needs to be engraved on the carrier of the Jade. I saw that the protective case of your phone has this pattern, and the desktop of your phone also has this pattern. I think you will like this design ...”

“En!” “I like it very much!” Song Wei nodded her head and said.

After knowing that Xia ruofei had personally sculpted it, Song Wei felt a sweetness in her heart and held the jade pendant even tighter. She was even secretly glad that she had been poisoned by the peach blossom miasma. Otherwise, how could she have the chance to get such a thoughtful gift?

Xia ruofei said,”alright, let’s get back to the main topic!” Although with the suppression of the formation, you won’t be affected too much by the peach blossom miasma, it’s just a temporary solution. Moreover, the peach blossom miasma can constantly regenerate itself. After a long period of suppression, once it bursts out, I’m afraid the consequences will be more serious ...”

Song Wei finally shifted her attention back from Doraemon’s pendant. She also realized that she was in a bad situation.

She furrowed her brows and asked,”then what should we do?” I really don’t want to become ... Like what you said! If ... If there’s no other way, I’d rather die ...”

“What are you talking about?” Xia ruofei was furious. I will not let anything happen to you!”

Song Wei’s heart was filled with sweetness. She smiled at Xia ruofei and said,”Mm! Whatever you want to do, I’ll listen to you!”

It was very important to get rid of the peach blossom miasma, so Xia ruofei explained patiently,””The reason why the peach blossom miasma can’t be completely removed is that it hides in the sea of consciousness, and the spiritual power of outsiders can’t easily enter the sea of consciousness. Because the soul frequencies of two people are not synchronized, it is easy to cause soul damage, so ... I thought of a way!”

Then, Xia ruofei introduced the “absolute beginning Scripture” to Song Wei and said,””As long as you practice the first layer of the” absolute beginning Scripture “to perfection, when you operate the cultivation method, both of your souls will be infinitely close to the state of synchronization. In this way, I can try to remove the poison in the sea of consciousness. By then, you also have a certain cultivation base, and your own spiritual power can also suppress the poison. In this way, even if you can’t remove it all at once, the effect of the peach blossom miasma on you will not be great.”

Song Wei’s eyes lit up when she heard that. She asked,””Training? Are you saying that I can also cultivate?”

“Of course!” Xia ruofei said,”but this technique can only be cultivated by two people ...”

“Dual cultivation technique?” Song Wei blurted out, and her face turned red.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”what are you thinking?” However, it was almost the same. If two people cultivated together, wasn’t that ‘dual cultivation’? This understanding was also correct! Anyway, I’ll guide you during the cultivation process. I believe the progress won’t be too slow!”

If it was in the past, Xia ruofei would not have dared to make such a promise. The spiritual Qi on earth was very poor. For cultivators, the environment was too harsh. No matter what technique they practiced, their progress would be very slow.

However, Xia ruofei had just obtained a lot of spiritual crystals from the underground palace. They were formed by pure, solid spiritual Qi. The spiritual Qi contained in one spiritual crystal was comparable to the spiritual Qi in the spirit map space. He had more than a hundred of these spiritual crystals. Even if he stacked them together, he could increase Song Wei’s cultivation.

Song Wei nodded her head and asked curiously,””RUO Fei, did you start cultivating a long time ago?”

Xia ruofei nodded slightly.”It’s not too early, but I’ve been cultivating. In fact, when I treated you previously, I used cultivation methods. Otherwise, the unknown poison would have been difficult to remove.”

Xia ruofei felt a sense of relief. Qianqian had finally explained it to him. There were many things about the peach blossom miasma that Xia ruofei found hard to say.

“I see ...” Song Wei was excited. To her, this was a mysterious and unknown field.”So, when do we start?”

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said,”I think ... There’s no rush!” I have to be prepared, right? Besides, look at what time it is now? Hurry up and take a rest, the sky will be bright soon!”

Song Wei had no experience in cultivation, so Xia ruofei had to familiarize himself with the “absolute beginning Scripture” first. He had to guide Song Wei when she cultivated to increase the efficiency.

“I’m not sleepy at all!”Song Wei said. Maybe I slept for too long ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I still have to sleep!” You have to get over your ‘jet lag’! Otherwise, I’ll become a night owl!”

Song Wei was a little embarrassed as she smiled and said,””Alright then!”

Xia ruofei stood up.”You sleep in the bedroom. I’ll deal with it on the sofa.”

“That won’t do ...”

“It’s decided, Ladies First!” Xia ruofei said,”we might have to stay in Ruizhou for another two or three days. I’ll go and get another room tomorrow ...”

Xia ruofei then explained,””You were unconscious for the past few days. For the sake of better care and safety, I only booked one room ...”

“I know ...” Song Wei said softly,”ruofei, then ... Then I’ll go back to my room!”

“En!” Xia ruofei nodded.

Song Wei got up and went back to her bedroom. After a while, she opened the door and came back with a blanket.”I found a blanket in the cabinet. I’ll Cover You with it!”

“Oh! Thank you!” Xia ruofei smiled.

In fact, it was almost dawn and Xia ruofei was not ready to sleep.

Song Wei put down the blanket and walked back to the bedroom. She turned around when she reached the door and asked,”RUO Fei, I ... Can I sleep with the door open? I’m ... A little scared ...”

Xia ruofei nodded and smiled.””No problem! I’ll always be outside to protect you, so don’t worry and sleep!”

Of course, Song Wei would not be worried about Xia ruofei. He could control himself even when she threw herself at him. How could he possibly do something to violate her at this time?

She smiled sweetly at Xia ruofei and went straight to the bed to lie down. Then, she looked up and saw that Xia ruofei was sitting on the sofa. She then lay down with peace of mind and closed her eyes.

......

At eight in the morning, Yu mingdong knocked on Xia ruofei’s door. Shi Lei didn’t follow him. He was probably guarding the batch of Jade.

Yu mingdong walked into the room and said with a smile,””Mr. Xia, since you’re not going to buy jade today, you can walk around Ruizhou in the morning. After I’m done with this batch of Jade, we can go to the public market together ...”

Speaking of this, Yu mingdong was suddenly stunned. Because at this time, he saw someone lying in the bedroom through the open door.

Although he couldn’t see the face and the figure under the blanket, the long black hair on the pillow was enough to prove that the person lying on the bed was a woman ...
