Chapter 478: One condition (2)

Lu You parked the car and walked into the villa in quick steps.

Professor Tian was sitting on the sofa in the living room, reading the newspaper with his reading glasses on. He looked up when he heard footsteps.

Professor Tian was also a little surprised to see Lu You. He asked,””Youyou? Why did you come back? It’s not the weekend, is it?”

Lu You’s footsteps didn’t stop. She said in a sweet voice,””Grandpa, I’m back to take something and then I’ll leave!”

By the time she finished speaking, she had already run up the stairs.

Professor Tian couldn’t help but shake his head and mumble to himself,””This girl, why is she in such a rush ...”

Lu You came to her boudoir and started to rummage through her closet.

Soon, she found a red flannel bag in the drawer at the bottom of the closet. She opened the flannel bag and took out a piece of Jade.

The Jade was crystal clear and white, delicate and moist. It was extremely pure and almost flawless, like the fat of a lamb that had just been cut open. Its luster was like condensed oil, and also like the smooth skin of a beautiful woman, moist and moving.

Without a doubt, this was a high – Quality sheep – Fat white jade.

The piece of Jade was round, about the size of two adult palms, and about two centimeters thick. It was like a piece of Jade, but it was a circle instead of a ring formed by two concentric circles.

There were some patterns carved on the Jade, making it look very noble and mysterious.

Lu You’s Jade – like fingers gently touched the surface of the White jade, and her eyes revealed a hint of reminiscence.

When Lu You was about six or seven years old, there was a period of time when she was particularly sick and often had nightmares at night. At that time, Tian Huixin, who had just married into the MA family of Hong Kong, specially looked for the famous Feng Shui Master Huang in Hong Kong and asked for a protective talisman.

The protective talisman was the White jade in Lu You’s hand.

Of course, only the MA family of Hong Kong, who held all the shares of Hengfeng jewelry, could afford to use the best sheep – Fat white jade and hire the best carvers to carve it according to Master Huang’s requirements.

It was said that this piece of white jade had been blessed. Master Huang had requested for this protective talisman to be hung on Lu You’s bed and could only be taken off when she was 18 years old.

It was strange. Ever since Lu You hung this piece of white jade on her bed, her body gradually got better, and she no longer had nightmares at night.

It was only when Lu You graduated from high school and turned eighteen that this piece of white jade was kept.

Today, when Xia ruofei said that he needed high – Quality sheep – Fat white jade, Lu You immediately thought of this protective talisman that had accompanied her to sleep every day for the past 12 years.

Lu You looked at it, and she naturally felt a little reluctant.

However, this was just a thought. She quickly put the White jade into the red velvet bag, then stood up and put the red velvet bag into her arms.

“Anyway, I’m already 18 years old. There’s no point in keeping it ...” Lu You muttered to herself.

After she took the sheep – Fat white jade, she did not stay any longer. She went downstairs to say hello to professor Tian and then went out to drive to Taoyuan farm.

……

Xia ruofei naturally didn’t know that Lu You ‘s’ help ‘was actually a protective talisman that was very meaningful to her. If he had known, Xia ruofei would definitely not have accepted it.

He had just returned to the farm.

Once they reached the door, Xia ruofei stuck his head out of the car window and asked,””Hu Zi! How’s the farm?”

“Brother Xia, everything is normal!” Lei Hu grinned and said,”I’ve already asked Xu Wei to guard the surveillance cameras and Hong Tao to stand guard nearby!”

Hong Tao had been a sniper in the Army, so his observation skills were the keenest. He was also good at hiding, so it was most suitable for him to find a high point nearby and guard the farm.

Xu Wei used to be in charge of communication and so on, so Lei Hu let him be in charge of monitoring the images of the various cameras, while Lei Hu personally guarded the door. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Xia ruofei nodded.”Everyone, work hard for the next two days. Strengthen the security!”

“Don’t worry, brother Xia!” Lei Hu said confidently,”the farm is not big, and there are surveillance cameras everywhere. The four of us will definitely not make any mistakes.”

Then, Lei Hu carefully asked,””Brother Xia, did something happen?”

Xia ruofei did not hide anything from Lei Hu and said directly,””It’s not a big deal. When I went out today, I found someone following me. When I got to the city, someone attacked me. I don’t know if the other party will attack the farm. Anyway, there’s no harm in being careful!”

“F * ck!” Lei Hu shouted. There was such a thing! Brother Xia, who is the other party? Should we take the initiative to attack?”

Xia ruofei pouted and said,”I just knocked him down and didn’t have time to do anything!” So now, generally speaking, the enemy is in the dark while we’re out in the open. Everyone, be more alert these few days and don’t let anyone take advantage of this. ”

“Understood!” Lei Hu replied.

There was no tension in his eyes. On the contrary, there was a faint excitement in his eyes. After coming to Peach Blossom Farm, his work and life had been too comfortable. These former excellent soldiers were so idle that their bones were about to rust. Now that they heard that someone might want to harm the farm, Lei Hu was like a child who had seen his favorite toy and was eager to try.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”Oh right, President Feng and pang Hao are out at the recruitment meeting. It’s easy for problems to arise if there are too many people around. Give Qin Xiaojun a call and tell him to be on guard. He must ensure President Feng and pang Hao’s safety!”
