Chapter 1538: 100% accuracy (2)

The MA family’s Hengfeng group had a stable supply channel, and they often purchased goods in the hundreds of millions. For example, they simply didn’t send anyone to participate in the Ruizhou public auction this time.

For Yu mingdong, more than 40 million was not a small number. After all, this was a gamble. If he was unlucky, more than 40 million might be lost.

The possibility of losing everything was low, but it was normal for the capital to shrink by ten or twenty times.

He did not expect that Xia ruofei, who knew nothing about stone gambling and was only here to watch the show, would dare to invest more than 20 million.

Yu mingdong was even a little worried for a moment. After all, Xia ruofei’s bid was registered under his name. If Xia ruofei really won the bid and couldn’t pay the money, he wouldn’t be able to get back the security deposit he paid.

However, this was just a thought that flashed through Yu mingdong’s mind. As long as he thought about how Ma Zhiming had personally called in the middle of the night to help Xia ruofei contact and buy jade, the uneasiness in his heart disappeared.

Birds of a feather flock together. How could a person who had such a close relationship with Mr. MA from Hong Kong not be able to pay 20 million?

Moreover, even if Xia ruofei really did not have the money to pay and caused his security deposit to be deducted, Mr. MA would definitely not ignore it.

However, Yu mingdong still felt that Xia ruofei was too bold.

“Mr. Xia,” he could not help but say,”the risk of stone gambling is still very high. You don’t know much about this industry. If you invest so much rashly ...”

He Ping, who was at the side, could not help but shake his head. To him, Xia ruofei was just a rich young master. He knew nothing about this industry, yet he dared to throw money like this. He was really ignorant and fearless.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”President Yu, it’s just a bid. We don’t even know if we’ll win!”

“That’s true ...” Yu mingdong nodded.

He felt a little more at ease because he knew that the price of the raw stone was difficult to grasp even for people in the trade. The starting price might not be of any significance, so it was not surprising that the winning bid price was several times higher than the starting price.

After all, this was not a public auction. Xia ruofei had invested more than 20 million in the order. It was hard to say how much he would win in the end.

If Xia ruofei only used the starting price as a reference, the probability of winning the bid would be very low.

However, Yu mingdong still reminded him and said,””Mr. Xia, you have to be more careful in the future. Actually, you can ask old he and me for our opinions. In the business of stone gambling, it’s hard to figure out the way without rich experience ...”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Okay. Thank you for the reminder, director Yu.”

Yu mingdong saw Xia ruofei’s nonchalant look and guessed that Xia ruofei probably didn’t lack money at all. He didn’t care about ten or twenty million at all, so he didn’t say anything more.

Because the bidding results would be announced at Seveno’ clock, the group did not go far after they got their cars. They found a well – decorated restaurant nearby, ordered a few dishes, and hurried back to the Jade public square after eating.

In a short two hours, the public Jade bid had been completely renewed.

The area where the raw gemstones were originally placed had been isolated. A long service Desk had been set up at the forefront, and all the staff were in place.

The huge screen at the most eye – catching position on the venue was also turned on. In a while, the bidding results would roll on the big screen and be announced.

Since there were more raw gemstones to be traded this time, the bidding results that had already been announced would be posted at the venue. In addition, the organizer had provided a few computers so that customers could also check the bidding status of the raw gemstones of a certain number through the computers.

When Xia ruofei and the others arrived at the public Jade bid, many people had already arrived.

Everyone was waiting anxiously, and many people were craning their necks to look at the empty big screen.

After a while, there was a commotion in the crowd.

“He’s out! It’s out!”

“It’s in serial number! I have a raw stone with a number that’s quite close to the front, quickly match it!”

“Guan Yin Bodhisattva, please bless me. You must let me get a few pieces! There’s no rice in the factory to go into the pot ...”

Xia ruofei also looked up at the big screen. As expected, the latest bidding information began to appear.

The information was in the form of a table. There were three very simple columns, which were the raw stone number, the winning bid price, and the corresponding winning bid ticket number.

Yu mingdong also looked at the big screen nervously, and from time to time, he took out his notebook to look at it.

Out of the eight raw gemstones that Xia ruofei had chosen, two of them had the first 100 numbers. At this rate, the bidding information would probably appear on the next few screens.

However, Xia ruofei was very confident and was not very anxious. Instead, he was interested in the reaction of the people around him.

Although stone gambling was a legal raw stone trade, the people who participated in the trade were really like gamblers at the moment. They all widened their eyes, stretched their necks, and stared at the big screen.

To be more precise, these people were more like the stock investors in the stock exchange Center who paid attention to the market before the internet became popular. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“I got one! Cool!”

“AI! I wrote 20000 Yuan less, and it was actually taken away ...”

“I’ve been looking at raw stone number 36 for more than an hour! That’s a conservative bid!”
