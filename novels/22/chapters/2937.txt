On the other two buses, the staff that Qin Yanan had brought along was also making the same introduction.

Ma Jia was the person in charge of the guard, so he was naturally on the first bus. After hearing Qin Yanan’s words, he smiled and said,””He even prepared a surprise for everyone! Then I’ll open it and take a look!”

Qin Yanan smiled and nodded,”sure!” The initial password is six 1s, you can change the password later as you need!”

Ma Jia picked up the camouflage suitcase with her name tag and said with a smile, “It’s quite heavy!”

He placed the suitcase in the middle of the aisle, then deftly unlocked it with a password lock and unzipped it. The contents of the suitcase were immediately revealed to everyone.

The whale Island guards also gathered around curiously, wanting to see what Xia ruofei had specifically asked Qin Yanan to buy for everyone.

The big suitcase was almost filled with all kinds of daily necessities, from large vacuum mugs and shampoo to small band – Aids, toothpaste, toothbrushes, and more. There were at least dozens of things in it, including snacks and daily necessities. Ma Jia even found a bottle of Lao Gan Ma, which was probably prepared to prevent the team members from not getting used to the food on Paradise Island. It could be said that there was such a guarantee package. He didn’t need to prepare anything. After all, the guards worked on the island, and their clothes were all issued in the same uniform.

Qin Yanan smiled as she introduced,””President Xia specifically instructed me to do this. Everyone’s box contains the same thing. President Xia said that it’s not convenient to shop at your workplace and was worried that you didn’t bring everything, so he simply used the company’s funds to give everyone a portion!”

Ma Jia silently closed the box. The other guards didn’t say anything either, but a warm feeling began to flow in their hearts.

They had been very serious about this job because of their friendship. Xia ruofei’s thoughtful action made everyone feel a stronger sense of belonging.

After the small interlude, the three buses set off on time and drove out of the gate of Tao Yuan farm in a single file. Soon, they turned onto the National Highway and headed for the Sanshan International Airport, which was also located in Changping County.

The security team took a chartered flight, and Qin Yanan had also come out in advance to coordinate in the name of the Paradise Corporation. The airport had specially opened a fast lane, and this time, everyone heading to Paradise Island would quickly pass through the security check through this Lane, and then take the long – prepared shuttle bus directly to the tarmac.

Qin Yanan and two other staff members, who had completed the procedures in advance, also followed everyone to the tarmac.

A Boeing 757 of qplease was quietly parked in the plane. The captain, along with three other pilots and crew members, stood by the accommodation ladder to welcome them.

After getting off the shuttle bus, the security guards quickly lined up and pushed the same camouflage suitcases toward the plane. They looked like an Army except for the fact that they were not wearing standard Chinese military uniforms.

Qiuhang was equipped with two flight crews for this flight, which were two captains and two co – pilots. The two flight crews would take turns to rest and complete the mission together.

With the Boeing 757’s cruising ability, this flight would not need to stop at any airport for refueling. After taking off from San Shan, they would directly land at Peach Blossom island’s airport.

Considering that the runway of Peach Blossom Island Airport was a little short, qplease airlines also specially arranged an experienced pilot instructor, Nielson, to be the first pilot.

Standing at the front of the welcoming team, Nelsen took a few steps forward and said to the leading horse Deputy in English with a smile,””Welcome to our flight! I would like to welcome you all on behalf of quité airlines and the flight crew!”

Although Ma Jia had also graduated with a bachelor’s degree, after working in the Army, the English he had learned in college had basically fallen behind. Plus, Nelsen spoke a little fast, so he didn’t understand much.

Fortunately, Ma Jia’s family member Lin Yue’s English wasn’t bad. She looked at Ma Biao with a smile and temporarily took on the role of a translator.

After Ma Jia heard Lin Yue’s translation, she shook hands with Nelson and said in English, which she was not very proficient in,””Thank you! You’ve all worked hard!”

Although listening, reading, and writing had deteriorated a lot, Ma Jia still had no problem with some simple English conversations.

He originally thought that Nelson was just being polite, but he didn’t expect that Nelson would say a lot of words at a very fast speed. It was difficult for him to guess what it meant from the few words he barely heard, so he turned his eyes to Lin Yue for help.

Lin Yue also revealed a puzzled expression and shrugged her shoulders,””The captain said that Captain Brook had a strong desire to take this flight, but unfortunately, he flew on an Airbus, while Mr. Xia rented a Boeing plane. Of course, the most important thing was that he had retired not long ago, so he could not fly even if he wanted to. Those were his exact words, I don’t know what he meant ...”

Ma Jia was confused. She thought for a while and said,””Then why don’t you ask him who Brook is?”

“Wouldn’t that be a little rude?” Lin Yue hesitated for a moment.

While the two were whispering, Nelsen quickly said in English,””I forgot to tell you, Brook and I are very good friends. We were classmates in the aviation school, but after we returned to the company, we were arranged to learn how to fly different aircraft models. By the way, you guys still don’t know who Brook is, right?”
