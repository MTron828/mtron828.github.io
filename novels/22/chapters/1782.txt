Chapter 1783: Compromise (1)

The next morning, after Xia ruofei finished cultivating in his room, he took a hot shower and walked to the courtyard feeling refreshed.

As soon as he went out, he saw Xia Xiaolan sweeping the yard with a big broom. The weather in the capital was quite cold in the early spring, but Xia Xiaolan’s forehead was already covered in fine beads of sweat. It was obvious that she had been working for a long time.

Xia ruofei was stretching his chest as he greeted her with a smile.””Good Morning, Xiao LAN!”

Xia Xiaolan was focused on sweeping the floor when she heard Xia ruofei’s voice. She was shocked and quickly said,”Good Morning, boss!”

Then, she asked nervously,””Did I ... Disturb your rest?”

Xia ruofei smiled and replied,”no, no!” I wake up at this time every day. ”

Then, Xia ruofei said,”you’re new here, but you’re getting into work mode pretty quickly!” Actually, this yard is so big. You don’t have to clean it every day. It’s too tiring for you to do it alone ...”

“No!” Xia Xiaolan quickly replied. You’re giving me such a high salary, how could I dare to be lazy! Besides, it’s just a courtyard, and there’s not much work ...”

Xia ruofei could tell that the honest Xia Xiaolan was speaking from the bottom of her heart. He smiled and nodded, not trying to dampen Xia Xiaolan’s enthusiasm for work.

“Boss, sister – in – Law Xiujuan has been busy in the kitchen for a long time ...” Xia Xiaolan continued,”you can go over now and have breakfast!”

“Oh? Then I’ll have to try aunt Wu’s cooking!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you don’t have to work too! Let’s go eat first!”

“Boss, you can go first! I’ll go after I’m done here!” Xia Xiaolan said.

“Alright then! “Don’t tire yourself out ...” Xia ruofei said.”You can’t finish your work. Come over for breakfast when it’s about time!”

“Alright!” “Yes,” Xia Xiaolan replied. She then wiped the sweat off her forehead and continued to clean.

Xia ruofei strolled to the backyard. The kitchen was indeed steaming. Wu Xiujuan was busy in there.

“Good Morning, Auntie Wu!” Xia ruofei said.

Wu Xiujuan quickly greeted Xia ruofei and said,””Boss Xia! You’re up! Breakfast will be ready soon!”

“There’s no hurry, I just came over to take a look!” Xia ruofei asked,”did you sleep well last night?”

Wu Xiujuan smiled and said,””You slept quite well! The conditions here are much better than in our countryside! It’s just that the bed is too soft and I’m still not used to it!”

“You’ll slowly get used to it!”Xia ruofei laughed.

Wu Qiang was also in the kitchen. Upon seeing the situation, he also came forward to greet,””President Xia, sister – in – Law doesn’t know how to use some things, so I came over to help and teach her!”

There were many advanced kitchenware in the kitchen, which Wu Xiujuan had never even seen in the village, let alone used.

However, she had a solid foundation in cooking, so she learned it very quickly. After she learned how to use it, Wu Xiujuan felt that it was really convenient. She used the steaming pot, oven, and so on to cook, and her efficiency was much higher than before.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””There’s no hurry. Learn slowly. These aren’t difficult.”

Wu Qiang nodded and said,”don’t worry, director Xia. My sister – in – Law is very smart. Especially in the kitchen. She learns very quickly!”

“Qiangzi ...” Wu Xiujuan was a little embarrassed.

“I’m telling the truth, sis – in – Law!”Wu Qiang said with a smile. By the way, President Xia, sister – in – Law also asked me to buy her a few Western food recipes!”

Wu Xiujuan explained, a little embarrassed,”Boss Xia, I only know how to cook Chinese food in the countryside. I’m afraid that you might want to eat Western food sometimes, so I’m going to learn ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”it’s okay, Auntie Wu. I don’t have the habit of eating Western food. If there’s a gathering of friends and I need Western food, I will hire a special Western chef from outside. You don’t have to learn it now.”

“I’ll learn it first!” Wu Xiujuan said,”if I can learn it, boss, you don’t have to hire any Western chefs. Those chefs are quite expensive!”

Xia ruofei could tell that Wu Xiujuan and Xia Xiaolan were both very enthusiastic about their work.

He thought for a moment and nodded.”It’s fine if you want to learn more, but it’s still difficult to self – study. You can use your rest time to attend a Western cuisine class. I’ll reimburse your tuition!”

“Really?” Wu Xiujuan asked in surprise.

“Of course! It’s a good thing to love learning!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Wu Qiang, I’ll leave this to you! You’re more familiar with Beijing, so find Auntie Wu a reliable training class!”

“Yes, President Xia!” Wu Qiang said.

Xia ruofei chatted with the two for a while. Wu Xiujuan had finished preparing breakfast.

In the dining room, Xia ruofei laughed and said,””Then I’ll have a taste of Auntie Wu’s cooking!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

He picked up a red sugar mantou, took a bite, and chewed carefully. Then he gave a thumbs up and said,””Not bad! Not bad! The taste was quite good! Auntie Wu, you should be very particular about your dough making, right? The chewy texture of this mantou is very good!”

Wu Xiujuan was actually very nervous when Xia ruofei tried the brown sugar mantou. She was worried that her country cooking skills would not catch Xia ruofei’s eye.

If he made his boss unhappy on his first day of work, he would definitely not be able to stay in this job for long.

When Xia ruofei complimented her, Wu Xiujuan’s heart finally settled down. She quickly said,””Boss Xia, I’m glad you’re satisfied! If you like it, eat more!”
