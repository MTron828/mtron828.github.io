Chapter 3572: Spirit puppet manufacturing plan (2)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei stood by the bed and entered the medium.

He had arrived at the mountain and sea realm of the spirit map space.

The current mountain sea realm was very different from the past. He had so much free labor. In the past, these people, regardless of whether they were assassins or gangsters, had only one Identity after entering here, and that was to work.

Xia Qing assigned them work every day, and they could get points by completing the tasks. They could also use the points to exchange for some enjoyment of life while eating their fill. If they couldn’t complete the task, they wouldn’t even be able to eat.

Coupled with the mutual supervision and hierarchical management mechanism, these free workers were quite enthusiastic about work.

Thus, after such a long period of time, the development level of the mountain sea realm was already very high.

In addition to a large Chinese medicine plantation, Xia Qing also opened up a piece of farmland with free labor. In addition, the cultivation of Cordyceps, as well as the breeding and fishing of some seafood, were also arranged in an orderly manner.

Today was the first day off for the free labor of the mountain sea realm.

In the past, they could also use their points to exchange for rest time, but they would rather exchange their points for a can of Coke or a pack of cigarettes than to use them to exchange for rest time. After all, the jobs arranged by Xia Qing were basically within their ability and wouldn’t exhaust their physical strength.

It was New Year’s Eve today, so Xia ruofei had already informed Xia Qing to let these free laborers rest for two days and not need to work for the next two days.

Therefore, the free labor camp was very lively at the moment.

After Xia ruofei entered the medium, Xia Qing immediately came to him and called out respectfully,””Master!”

Xia ruofei nodded and asked,”have you given them a break?” How’s everyone’s mood?”

“He must be overjoyed!” Xia Qing smiled and said,”not only did they not have to work for the past two days, but I also followed your instructions and gave them extra meals. I also organized a few Chinese people to make dumplings with everyone. There was enough pork and flour! They were cooking dumplings just now!”Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“It’s so late and you’re still up?”Xia ruofei nodded.

Although there was no day and night in the spirit map space, Xia ruofei still instructed Xia Qing to arrange their work and rest according to Huaxia’s time. The mobile rooms where these free laborers lived had been modified and installed with opaque curtains. When it was time to rest, the curtains had to be drawn tightly.

This was also to ensure that their biological clocks followed a regular pattern and prevent any problems from happening to their bodies. After all, it was not easy to find free labor like this. Xia ruofei was not the kind of person who had no limits. He would not simply arrest people and bring them in.

Of course, many of the people who had been captured before deserved to die. It was already good enough that they were not killed directly. Xia ruofei had no qualms about capturing them and making them work.

“Usually, they’ll be resting at this time, but since it’s a holiday, 1 won’t interfere with their work and rest time. They’re resting tomorrow anyway, so they can sleep in.” Xia Qing explained.

“En!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”just let them relax! It’s easy to break a string if it’s too tight, so it’s better to have a degree of relaxation! You can also consider giving them a day off regularly in the future.”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing nodded and said.

“Alright, I’m done here. 1 just came in to check on everyone’s situation.” Xia ruofei said,”you should go too!”

Xia Qing was only a spiritual puppet, not a real human being, so he didn’t need to sleep at all. Usually, when the free labor was sleeping, he was still busy.

After all, other than the mountain and sea realm, the Archean realm also needed Xia Qing to take care of them.

“Yes! Master!”

After Xia Qing finished speaking, her figure disappeared in a flash.

Xia ruofei could sense that Xia Qing had gone to the Archean realm, but he didn’t care. Instead, he started to stroll around the mountain sea realm. As the clock struck midnight, Xia ruofei finished his Drunken Eight Immortals wine. He stood up and waved at Lin Hu’s photo before returning to the guest room that his mother had prepared for him.

After returning to his room, Xia ruofei did not go to bed immediately. Instead, he locked the doors and windows, set up a simple alarm array in the room, and disguised the bed a little. Then, he summoned the spirit map scroll and stuffed it under the blanket.

He was preparing to enter the spirit map space. With such an arrangement, even if Hu Zi’s mother or Lin Qiao entered his room, he would be able to detect them immediately and quickly return to his bed.

Of course, it was extremely rare for the two of them to enter the room without permission. Xia ruofei did this as a precaution.
