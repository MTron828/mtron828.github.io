Chapter 1909 Solid proof (1)

After a while, Xu Yougang saw Liu haojun on the surveillance screen of the computer.

As soon as he entered the room, he saw Fang Chenchen, who had just taken a shower and looked like a lotus flower out of the water. He immediately hugged her and his mouth, which reeked of alcohol, was close to her face. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Fang Chenchen’s eyes flashed with a hint of disgust, but she quickly hid it. She dodged and smiled.””So annoying! His body reeked of alcohol ... Hurry and take a shower! Otherwise, you’re not allowed to touch me!”

Liu haojun chuckled and said,”baby, you smell good!” We’ll be fine once we balance it out ...”

With that, Liu haojun picked Fang Chenchen up by her waist and knocked open the bedroom door with his back as she screamed. He then threw her on the bed and pressed her down heavily ...

After Liu haojun entered the gate of the residential area, Zeng Liang had left the surveillance position of the window and moved closer to the computer screen. Seeing this, he clicked his tongue and said,”this guy is really impatient!” Could it be the reincarnation of a lecher?”

Xu Yougang saw that the clothes on the two people in the surveillance screen were getting less and less. He frowned slightly and reached out to pull a piece of tablecloth to cover the computer screen.

When Zeng Liang saw this, he said with a smile,”old Xu, why do you have to do this?” Don’t you have to edit the video later?”

“I don’t want to listen to this kind of story!” Xu Yougang said,”I’m going to smoke a cigarette. You listen to your earphones. After they’re done, remember to save another copy of the video at this time!”

“If you don’t want to hear it, then let me hear it!” Zeng Liang said,”everyone’s wife is not by their side. Isn’t this asking for my life?”

Xu Yougang patted Zeng Liang’s shoulder and said,””If you want to vent your anger, there are many hair salons in the West Camp Lane not far away. Don’t worry, I promise I won’t tell sister – in – Law!”

“Go to hell!” Zeng Liang scolded him with a smile,”do I look like that kind of person?”

Even though he said that, Zeng Liang still put on his headphones quickly. Then, he immediately frowned and lowered the volume. He sat there obediently and listened.

Xu Yougang went to the window to smoke. Out of sight, out of mind.

Not long after he finished smoking, Xu You heard the sound of Zeng Liang taking off his headphones and placing them on the table. He couldn’t help but turn around and see that Zeng Liang had already removed the tablecloth covering the computer screen. “What’s wrong?”

Zeng Liang spread his hands and said,”it’s done!” Damn ... This kid looks quite strong, I didn’t expect him to be a silver spearhead!”

Xu Yougang looked at his watch subconsciously and said,””It’s over? He rushed over from Changping in the middle of the day just for these six or seven minutes?”

Zeng Liang almost burst out laughing and said,””Comrade old Xu, don’t discriminate. Isn’t it just a short time? I heard that woman screaming quite happily!”

“Nonsense!” Xu Yougang pouted and said,”she’s Liu haojun’s mistress, so she has to play along and pretend. This is an issue of professional ethics!”

“Are they leaving already?” Xu Yougang asked.

Zeng Liang pursed his lips and said,”no!” They’re taking a couple’s bath. Looking at Liu haojun’s posture, he probably wants to have a second round, but I think it’s going to be tough ...”

As the two of them were talking, the micro camera in the bedroom showed Liu haojun and Fang Chenchen coming out of the bathroom.

The two of them sat in front of the computer again, listening and monitoring. They saw Liu haojun lying on the bed and resting for a while. During this time, Fang Chenchen also “tried” very hard, but to no avail. Liu haojun got up and took out a medicine box from the drawer. He took a pill from it and ate it with mineral water.

“He’s really going all out!” Zeng Liang said with a smile,”you even used medicine!”

Xu Yougang glanced at Zeng Liang, stood up, and said,””Don’t make such sarcastic remarks! Hurry up and work! Please don’t make any mistakes! If we don’t save these videos, we’ve been working for nothing these past few days!”

“Me again?” Zeng Liang shouted hurriedly. It’s your turn now!”

Xu Yougang walked to the window and said,””It’s just a matter of a few minutes. We’re all good comrades, so why are you so calculative? Besides ... This kind of erotic scene is rare, so don’t take advantage of it!”

Zeng Liang almost choked and couldn’t say anything. After a while, he said,””Only a grandson would take advantage of this ...”

However, Xu Yougang was the person in charge of this operation. Zeng Liang could only grumble at most. In the end, he had no choice but to sit down, endure the various restlessness in his heart, and continue to monitor.

Liu haojun and Fang Chenchen only left the West Lake Mansion estate at around two in the afternoon and returned to their respective units.

Xu Yougang and Zeng Liang quickly sorted out today’s video. From Liu haojun’s entrance to the two of them leaving, the entire video had not been cut. They saved it all and made a CD.

In addition, Xu Yougang had asked Zeng Liang to take about 15 pictures from the video, all of which had good angles and expressions. Since the video was taken by a high – definition camera, the quality of the screenshots was also very good. These photos were also engraved on the CD.

Xu Yougang took out another laptop that was not connected to the internet and stuffed the CD into the computer bag. Then he said to Zeng Liang,””Liangzi, keep an eye on him for a bit this afternoon. I’ll go report the progress to the boss!”
