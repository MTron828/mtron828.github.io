2653 The old army (1)

In a mountainous area suburbs Jinling.

A yellow taxi stopped in front of a remote military camp and stopped in front of a striking yellow stop line.

Xia ruofei scanned the QR code to pay the fare and got out of the car.

He looked up at the familiar military camp with a hint of nostalgia in his eyes. He was too familiar with this place. It was no exaggeration to say that he could find any place in the military camp with his eyes closed. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

This was the base of Xia ruofei’s military service. Many people would not have thought that the internationally famous lone wolf assault team would be stationed in such an unremarkable mountain area.

Of course, the lone wolf assault team was a special case. Most of the troops were stationed in this camp all year round. The assault team itself was often out for training or to carry out missions. They might only stay in this camp for about one – third of the time in a year.

Xia ruofei looked away from the red 81 military emblem on the door and walked forward.

The Sentry at the entrance of the campsite had noticed that Xia ruofei’s campsite was very remote. Other than the military vehicles of the Army, there were very few other vehicles. The moment the rental car entered the Sentry’s line of sight, he had noticed it immediately.

When Xia ruofei approached the second line of defense, the Sentry immediately raised his hand to block him. He said seriously,””Comrade! Please stop!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Class monitor, I’m here to look for someone. Can you please help me make a call?”

Although this Sentry was only a first – Class soldier who made two turns, when he met soldiers he did not know in the Army, he would usually address them as squad leader. As a veteran who had served for many years, Xia ruofei naturally knew this unwritten rule.

The Guard’s face had a trace of childishness. He sized Xia ruofei up with a vigilant look and gradually revealed a shocked expression. His originally righteous face suddenly became stammering as he said,””You ... You are ... You are class monitor Xia?”

There was shock in his eyes and uncertainty in his tone. It was obvious that he found it hard to believe that Xia ruofei had suddenly appeared in front of him.

The Sentinel was only a two – year soldier. Xia ruofei naturally could not take him under his wing.

However, the management of the troops was very humane. Although the control of smartphones was still relatively strict, every weekend and holiday, the soldiers could still take back the phones that were managed by the central management. They could only use them for a limited time.

With Xia ruofei’s current popularity on the internet and the fact that he had just retired from this military camp, almost all the soldiers here regarded him as their idol. There were so many pictures and videos of Xia ruofei on the internet. How could the Sentry not recognize her after observing her at such a close distance?

Moreover, Xia ruofei’s photo was still hanging in the lone wolf assault team’s honor room. It was taken when he was called back to perform a second – Class mission.

The first lesson for new soldiers was to visit the Commando unit’s honor room. It was the same for these non – combat troops in charge of the camp’s security.

Therefore, the soldiers here were all familiar with Xia ruofei’s deeds. After all, those heroes were too far away from them. But Xia ruofei was different. He had become a popular star. Whether it was the internal information that he had been summoned back to carry out the 615 mission, or the stories that had circulated online, including his forced surrender, he had long left an indelible impression on these new soldiers who were mainly born after the 90s.

Xia ruofei was slightly stunned. He nodded and said,””I’m Xia ruofei. I didn’t expect you to know me.”

“Class monitor Xia, you’re our idol!” The Sentinel looked excited and asked,”are you here to find the wolf King?”

Wolf King Guo Zhan was the captain of the lone wolf assault team. In this military camp, he was the highest ranking military officer. These assigned security troops were also under his command.

However, due to the special nature of the lone wolf assault team, the combat unit and the security team were strictly distinguished. These security teams were actually only responsible for daily security, including food security, vehicle security, and guard duty. During the training period, these security teams would not go with the team.

In fact, the lone wolf assault team was a small but elite special combat force. Most of their missions were to penetrate the enemy’s rear and venture into the dragon’s pool and Tiger’s Den alone. Therefore, they were all carrying various supplies alone, and there was no special security team accompanying them.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”can you please use the military line to pass the message?”

“Alright! Alright!” The Sentry quickly said,”squad leader Xia, please wait a moment!”

After that, the Sentinel pressed on the walkie – talkie hanging on his chest and said with his head lowered,””Class monitor Gao! Please come out for a moment, there’s a situation at the entrance!”

There was some noise from the walkie – talkie, and then a voice came,””Immediately!”

Soon, the door of the guardhouse opposite the Sentry post opened, and a fully armed warrior wearing the same camouflage uniform walked out quickly.

The officer on duty in the guardroom had actually noticed the situation here long ago, but the sentries were dealing with it, so he just kept an eye on it and didn’t immediately come over to understand the situation.

When the Sentinel called him through the walkie – talkie, he quickly got up, pushed the door open, and went out to check on the officer on duty. He was worried that the Sentinel would have a conflict with the people, or even an attack on the Sentinel.
