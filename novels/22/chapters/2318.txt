This kind of relatively old residential area was generally semi – Open, including the unit doors of the residential buildings, which were basically open.

Xia ruofei walked straight in. There was no elevator in the old building, so he walked up the stairs until he reached the rooftop.

This building was adjacent to the one where the red signal point was located. The distance between the two buildings was only five or six meters. In addition, there was a protruding fire panel on the roof, so the actual distance was even shorter.

Xia ruofei rubbed his hands and ran to the edge of the rooftop. Then, he jumped up.

He landed lightly on the top floor of the opposite building.

This kind of heat insulation material could not bear much weight. If an ordinary person stepped on it, it would collapse easily. However, Xia ruofei’s toes touched it lightly as if it had no weight. Then, he supported himself with one hand and flipped up to the roof.

He had already used his mental power to do a carpet check on the rooftop, so he did not stop at all after he jumped onto the rooftop. He quickly moved to the other side.

Not far away, a figure hiding on top of the water tower was observing the situation on the other side through the sniper scope. He did not notice Xia ruofei who was approaching him from behind ...

******

On the fifth floor of the residential building.

Four people were sitting in the living room with serious expressions. One of them was the middle – aged man named number 6.

They didn’t notice at all that in the interlayer of the gypsum board, two wasps were hidden there motionlessly, and the micro – positioning tracker they carried was constantly sending radio frequency signals to the outside.

Number six’s face was dark. The video player on his laptop was paused. The image on the screen was Xia ruofei’s face. Of course, this was Xia ruofei’s face after he had changed his appearance.

“No. 4, have you found this person’s identity?” asked the middle – aged man. What is his background?”

No. 4 shook his head.”I’ve already sent the screenshot back to the headquarters when we were on the way here. There’s no information on this person’s identity after comparing it with the database.”

Their database was naturally not the domestic household registration database in China. It was built by their organization itself. The database naturally collected some experts in the industry, as well as some experts from the government and Army of various countries in public information. There was no matching identity information. It could only mean that the person who forced No. 1 to use his last resort was either in disguise or had not been exposed to the public at all.

“How is that possible?” The middle – aged man snorted coldly.”How can someone who can make Qian GUI douyou lose the chance to escape be a nobody?”

“No. 6, we’re very sorry about what happened to No. 1 ...” No. 4 said,”but I think our top priority is still the mission. We’re only half done with the mission, and we can’t explain it to the client ...”

The middle – aged man’s face revealed a trace of anger as he said,””Number 4! I’ve said it before, under that level of impact, the target is already dead. There’s no need to confirm it! It was you who insisted on getting concrete news before evacuating, and now my brother is ...”

“Number 6! It’s our rule to stay behind to confirm the mission’s results!” No. 4’s face darkened as he said,”and No. 1 agreed to this! Moreover, all the signs show that the target is not dead. This is not quite consistent with your judgment! It’s been so long ...”

“That’s the Chinese’s trick! They’re just sealing off the news!” The middle – aged man roared.

At this time, a man of about 26 or 27 years old with a pale face said,””Alright, alright, No. 4, No. 6, stop quarreling! No. 1 has basically been confirmed dead in the line of duty. We shouldn’t have any more internal strife now, or we can’t even guarantee our own safety! I suggest that we immediately ask the headquarters if we should evacuate immediately. Our whereabouts have been exposed, and the Chinese are likely to conduct a carpet search. After all, our target’s identity is not simple ...”

No. 4’s expression softened.”No. 6, we understand your feelings for No. 1. However, in our line of work, we should be mentally prepared. Moreover, we are in the middle of a mission. If you continue to be so emotional, God knows if you will drag the team down! Alright, I’ll immediately ask the headquarters for instructions. Before receiving clear instructions from the headquarters, everyone is to stay here and not be allowed to go out! At the very least, this hideout is temporarily safe. ”

No. 4 stood up and walked to the coffee table with her laptop.

He bent down and put down his laptop. Just as he was about to sit down, his body suddenly froze. His eyes widened as he looked in the direction of the balcony, revealing a look of disbelief ...

It turned out that there was an extra person on the balcony.

No, to be precise, there were two more people.

In addition to the young man with a playful smile on his face, there was also an unconscious bald man lying at his feet. The bald man was No. 5 of their team. When carrying out a mission, No. 5 was usually responsible for long – range sniping. When he returned to his hiding place, he was tasked with the task of guarding the perimeter.

The four people in the room were all desperadoes who had lived on the edge of blood for many years. They were very sensitive to danger. However, this young man had already appeared on the balcony with an unconscious No. 5 on his back without anyone noticing. None of the four people in the living room noticed.

This was what made No. 4 feel the most incredulous.

Although his mind went blank at that moment, many of the movements had become muscle memory after years of training and life and death training.

Therefore, even though No. 4 was stunned for a moment, she still subconsciously reached for her waist.

However, at this moment, number 4 felt as if he was bitten by ants in many places on his body. Then, he was shocked to find that he could not move at all.

This wasn’t the feeling of being injected with tranquilizer. To be more precise, it was as if every inch of his muscles was bound by an invisible rope. He couldn’t even move a finger.

This restraint was all – Round, so number 4 “s face still maintained a shocked expression.

Almost at the same time, the other three people in the living room also reacted. They subconsciously reached for their weapons, but at the same time, they felt as if several parts of their body were bitten by ants. Then, as if they were cast with a spell, they were completely fixed in place and unable to move at all.

This young man was Xia ruofei, who had changed his appearance again.

He had already learned his lesson in the hospital. Although he had casually carried the unlucky sniper and jumped onto the balcony, he was already prepared. He took advantage of the group’s momentary shock and attacked without hesitation. With a wave of his hand, he sealed the main acupuncture points of these four people, completely blocking the flow of qi and blood.

The weapons he used were just a few ordinary silver needles.

The silver needles that were filled with true Qi, the carefully selected acupuncture points, and the steady and accurate technique made this group of vicious and desperate people seem so vulnerable in front of him.

Xia ruofei walked into the living room from the balcony.

His gaze swept across the faces of number 2, number 3, number 4, and number 6 in succession. This method of sealing the acupoints only limited the circulation of qi and blood. These people’s consciousness was actually very clear.

This sobriety also caused the horror in their hearts to reach a peak.

Xia ruofei first used his mental strength to check the entire house. He found that there was indeed a miniature camera in the living room. One was installed in the top box of the television, and the other was installed in the lock hole of the balcony door. Their positions were very clever.

Xia ruofei went straight to the two micro – recording devices and removed them. He threw them on the ground and stomped on them, crushing them completely.

Xia ruofei did not know if the video recording device had captured the scene and if it had been sent to a certain place in real time.

However, he had changed his appearance to come in, so he was not worried about whether he would be exposed. Under normal circumstances, he would never use this appearance again.

To those who were looking for him everywhere, this was no different from directly vanishing into thin air.

Then, Xia ruofei walked to No. 4’s side and forcefully pried open No. 4’s mouth. He reached in and took out a small poison capsule. At such a close distance, under the scan of his spiritual power, everything was exposed.

Xia ruofei did the same thing and took out all the poison sacs hidden in the four people’s mouths.

Then, Xia ruofei walked to No. 4 and pulled out two silver needles.

No. 4 suddenly felt as if she could speak again. Although she still couldn’t move her body, at least she could move her mouth.

If Xia ruofei had not taken out the poison sac in advance, No. 4 would have bitten it without hesitation.

No. 4 said coldly,”don’t expect to get any information from me!” I think you’d better hurry up and kill us!”

Xia ruofei laughed and leaned over to No. 4.””Oh, really? I thought you would definitely cooperate with me!”

“Don’t even think about it!” No. 4 said coldly.

Xia ruofei laughed, and then his majestic spiritual power attacked number four.

Although mind power was invisible, Xia ruofei could still use a huge amount of mind power to attack number four. At that moment, number four was still dazed. Then, he could not help but look into Xia ruofei’s eyes.

At this moment, Xia ruofei’s eyes were like the deep space in number Four’s eyes. His two eyeballs were like terrifying black holes that could suck in everything.

Number four felt as if she was floating in the air for a moment, and then she entered a state of confusion ...
