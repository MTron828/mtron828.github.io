Then, Xia ruofei said,”by the way, Weiwei, this wild tea is enough for five people. I wanted to add uncle song, but considering that we haven’t told him about cultivation, and we can’t disclose the situation on the peach Garden to him, and that my adopted husband has to stay on the peach Garden, after some consideration, I finally decided to let the four of you drink the wild tea first!”

“Ruofei, you don’t have to explain it to me. I can definitely understand!” Song Wei said with a smile. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Next time, I’ll find a suitable time to let uncle song consume the wild tea!”

“So you have a lot of these magical tea leaves here?” Ling Qingxue asked.

Xia ruofei shook his head.”This is a gift from the young master of the first heaven society. There’s only so much. I’m going to make all of them at once!”

“Then why did you ask uncle song to drink the wild tea ...” Ling Qingxue was a little confused.

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”this young master Chen promised me that he would give me a few wild tea leaves.” I’m confident that I can succeed. Don’t forget how my paradise Corporation got rich! At that time, he could have as many of these wild tea leaves as he wanted! At least there’s some for uncle song to drink!”

“Waa! You can even plant it yourself?” Ling Qingxue’s eyes lit up.”Then what’s the point of cultivating? I can break through once by drinking a cup of tea, and I’ll be in the Golden core stage after a few drinks!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but ruffle Ling Qingxue’s hair. He smiled and said,””What beautiful things are you thinking of! Only the first time you drink this wild tea will have the effect of promoting cultivation. If you drink it again in the future, it will be purely drinking tea. But then again, from the perspective of tea leaves, the taste of this wild tea is quite good! I feel that it’s even thicker than my Wu Yi Da Hong Pao!”

“That’s true ...” Ling Qingxue said, a little embarrassed.”No wonder you just drank a cup of tea ... You must have drunk wild tea before, right?”

“Yes!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”it’s also a gift from the young master of the first heaven society!”

“So you’re saying that you’ve also broken through a level of cultivation after drinking it?” Song Wei could not help but ask.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”this wild tea helps with cultivation. It also depends on cultivation. Normally, Qi refinement cultivators would definitely break through one level after drinking it. However, golden core cultivators naturally don’t have such a good effect. Otherwise, even if they got wild tea, they would save it for after the Golden core stage!”

Xia ruofei paused and continued,””And I estimate that different people drinking wild tea may have different effects. Just like you guys, you’re almost two levels higher ... By the way, Haoran’s cultivation is the lowest, so I think the effect will be better after he drinks the wild tea. I have to go out and take a look!”

Xia ruofei quickly walked out of the cabin. Song Wei and Ling Qingxue followed closely behind him.

Even though Song Wei and Ling Qingxue had consumed the wild tea before they started cultivating, Xia ruofei had used the time formation flag, so they did not spend much time. Including the time they had spent talking, the whole process was less than ten minutes.

Therefore, Li Yifu and Tang Haoran in the guest room had basically just entered the state of cultivation not long ago.

Xia ruofei checked their breathing and was relieved to find that they were both stable.

As Tang Haoran’s cultivation level was the lowest and he was about to break through to refined Qi Level 3, Xia ruofei soon felt the spiritual Qi gathering around Tang Haoran.

Xia ruofei’s eyes narrowed. He knew that he was about to break through.

Sure enough, in just a few breaths, Tang Haoran’s aura suddenly increased by a notch.

Tang Haoran’s cultivation talent was also very impressive. After the breakthrough, he immediately followed the third level of the “fierce yang Scripture” and changed the path of his meridians. At this time, the effect of the wild tea was still present, so after his cultivation quickly stabilized, it immediately began to rise again.

After about half an hour, Xia ruofei felt that Tang Haoran was about to break through.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue, who were watching from the side, were also a little stunned. The speed of his breakthrough was simply unstoppable! They had thought that it was good enough that they could increase their cultivation by one or two levels at once, but now, they seemed to be inferior to Tang Haoran!

Of course, the difficulty of breaking through from refined Qi Level 2 to refined Qi level 3 and 4 was naturally lower than breaking through from refined Qi Level 4 to refined Qi Level 5.

However, considering Tang Haoran’s age, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but feel a strong sense of defeat.

Xia ruofei was paying full attention to Tang Haoran’s condition.

Soon, Tang Haoran’s aura skyrocketed, and he entered refined Qi Level 4 without any delay.

Seeing this, Xia ruofei did not hesitate to send a telepathic message to Tang Haoran.””Haoran, continue to circulate the third layer of the cultivation technique and quickly stabilize your cultivation!”

Even though Tang Haoran was in a state of cultivation, Xia ruofei’s voice could still be clearly heard in his mind.

At first, Tang Haoran had not learned the fourth level of the “fierce yang Scripture”. He was at a loss when he suddenly broke through to refined Qi Level 4. However, after hearing His Master’s Voice, he immediately calmed down and continued to operate the third level of the “fierce yang Scripture” according to Xia ruofei’s instructions to stabilize his cultivation.
