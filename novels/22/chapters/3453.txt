Chapter 3454: The battle (2)

Translator: 549690339

“Hahaha!” Daoist priest Qing Xuan said,”then let’s make a bet! Let me guess … I think this kid should be able to make it to the 450th level or so!”

Hearing this, immortal mountain river raised his eyebrows and said with a smile,””It seems that Daoist Qing Xuan is very confident in my disciple! Four hundred and fifty steps, that’s already close to the best record of the heavenly stairs!”

Daoist Qing Xuan was the caretaker of the trial Pagoda, so he was naturally the clearest about these records. He smiled and said,””The record for the heavenly stairs is 478 steps!”

If Xia ruofei was here, he would be very surprised. So the best record was only 478 steps? That was to say, until today, no one had been able to complete the entire heavenly stairs! In other words, no one had ever reached the top of the trial Pagoda!

Xia ruofei could already tell that the trial Pagoda was used to filter out talents. He thought that many people had reached the top in the long years.

Who would have thought that this trial Pagoda was indeed a place to filter out talents, but as long as one could pass the 200th step of the Obsidian stairway, they would pass.

This was not very accurate, because the 200th step was a very large dividing line. Those who could pass this hurdle could be said to be as rare as Phoenix Feathers and Qilin horns.

Even Ling Qingxue, whose mental power had already far surpassed her true Qi cultivation level due to her fortuitous encounter, was eliminated after reaching the 170th level.

Therefore, level 200 was actually very difficult.

However, Xia ruofei seemed to be more relaxed along the way. In addition, he cultivated the “great Dao scroll” and had shown many valuable qualities before. Thus, after comprehensive consideration, Daoist Qing Xuan still thought more highly of Xia ruofei. That was why he guessed the 450th level.

Immortal mountain river pondered for a while and then said with a smile,””Even Daoist Qing Xuan thinks so highly of this child. As his master, I can’t look down on him! 1’11 guess four hundred and eighty! Regardless of whether he can do it or not, as his master, 1 still hope that he can break this centuries – old record!”

Taoist master Qing Xuan gave him a thumbs up and said with a smile,””Brother mountain river is more daring! I don’t even dare to think that someone can break the stairway tree record … Brother mountain river, then it’s a deal! In the end, whoever’s guess is closer to the real result will be the winner. How about it?”

“Very good, it’s decided!” Immortal mountain river nodded and said.

Xia ruofei didn’t know that there was a gambling match when he was just trying to break through. He rested at the two – hundredth step and felt that his condition was fine. He was ready to continue.

Although the pressure was already very terrifying, Xia ruofei still had energy to spare. Hence, he felt that this pressure was still far from his limit.

In fact, as long as one stood on the heavenly stairs, they would be constantly under that huge pressure. Therefore, in theory, it was best to pass through quickly, so as to minimize the time spent on the stairway. However, because of the invisible force that stirred up the vital Qi, the cultivators on the heavenly stairs could not rely on their strong physical bodies to rush forward quickly. They could only stop for every step they took and try their best to maintain the stability of their vital Qi.

This was a test of a cultivator’s sense of rhythm.

Xia ruofei was one of those who had better control of the pace. Except for the first few dozen steps, he basically advanced steadily and steadily. At the same time, he did not rest too much. As long as his body was in a good condition, he would immediately go up the next step. Objectively, this reduced the time he stayed on the steps.

Although the pressure increased abruptly from the 199th step to the 200th step, Xia ruofei was mentally prepared for it. Moreover, it was all within his ability, so he did not waste too much time on this level and had already stabilized the yuan Qi in his body.

He raised his head to look at the top of the steps that were still far away. He took a deep breath and stepped onto the two hundred and first step.

Naturally, the pressure increased, but it was not as much as when he was on the 200th floor. Besides, Xia ruofei had already gotten used to this level of pressure. His body only swayed a little before he quickly stabilized himself. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

However, the vital Qi in his body was still shaking violently. Thus, he stood on the steps and circulated the great Dao formula for two cycles to completely stabilize his vital Qi. Then, he continued to move upward.

Two hundred and ten, two hundred and twenty, two hundred and thirty…

Xia ruofei had been maintaining a steady pace and rhythm as he climbed up step by step.

This Obsidian stairway’s pressure was constantly increasing, but there was one good thing, because there were more than 500 steps, so unless it was the whole 10, the whole 50, especially when it was the whole 100, the increase would be slightly larger, the other steps “increase was relatively small, so the Challenger could have a process of adaptation.

Of course, if one’s strength was insufficient, even if the increase was small, the accumulation would be very terrifying. In the end, one would still be unable to avoid the fate of being eliminated.

It was like boiling a frog in warm water. Although the temperature of the water was slowly rising, it would still boil in the end.

To Xia ruofei, 200 steps was far from his limit. As he continued to climb, his body was getting used to the increasing pressure. Hence, he was able to maintain a stable pace, which made people feel at ease.

At this moment, in the hidden space that was enshrouded in purple clouds, Daoist Qing Xuan and immortal mountain river looked at the image of Xia ruofei breaking through the levels on the copper mirror spiritual treasure and could not help but nod.

“It seems that I’m not wrong,” Qing Xuan said with a smile.”If there are no accidents, this kid should be able to make it to the 400th floor!”

Immortal mountain river said,”I still think he can break the record!” That’s right, two hundred years ago, the cultivator who reached the four hundred and seventy – eighth step and broke the heavenly stairs record was called Xuan Jizi, right?”

Daoist Qing Xuan nodded with a smile and said,”that’s right!” When he first attempted the heavenly stairs, he was only at the late – Stage of the Golden core stage.”

“If I’m not mistaken, this Xuan Jizi should be from the xuanming Grotto – heaven!” The mountain river immortal said,”this kid’s cultivation environment and resources are thousands of times better than mine, a disciple who came from the cultivation world of the divine land … Daoist brother Qing Xuan, what’s Xuan Jizi’s current cultivation level?”

“Xuan Jizi is already at the late – Stage primordial soul realm. Five years ago, he began his closed – door cultivation and has yet to come out! He must have reached the critical moment of breaking through to the leaving aperture stage!” Daoist Qing Xuan smiled and said,”if everything goes well, brother mountain and river should be able to see this genius from the xuanming Grotto – heaven in the near future! At that time, we human cultivators will have another powerful force!”

“This cultivation speed is not bad …” Immortal mountain river slowly nodded.

“Hahaha! Xuan Jizi passed the trial Pagoda’s test with the best battle record in history. The cultivation resources he received are also beyond the imagination of ordinary cultivators!” Daoist priest Qing Xuan said,”of course, he did not disappoint us. If he can break through to the leaving aperture stage within 300 years, it would be a very dazzling achievement even in the long river of history!”

Immortal mountain river looked at Xia ruofei who was moving up steadily in the copper mirror and said,””I believe that this disciple of mine is not inferior to Xuanji Zi. It’s just that… I don’t know if he has so much time left to grow…”

Daoist priest Qing Xuan sighed and said,””Brother mountain and river, everything has its destiny! I don’t think your disciple is someone without good fortune. No matter what the situation is in the future, 1 believe he should be able to turn misfortune into fortune!”

“Hahaha! Daoist Qing Xuan’s fortune – telling has always been accurate, so I’ll be counting on your blessings!” Immortal mountain river laughed and said.

Taoist master Qing Xuan and immortal mountain river were chatting while paying attention to Xia ruofei’s progress. On the eighth level of the trial Pagoda, Xia ruofei had started to climb from the 300th to the 400th level at a steady pace..
