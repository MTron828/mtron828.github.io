Brother Xia again ... Tang Yitian suddenly felt tired.

As the group walked into the manor, Tang Yitian asked respectfully,””Grandpa li, do you think we should have dinner first or ...”

“I’ll have a chat with brother Xia first!”Li Yifu said after a slight hesitation.

“Yes. Grandpa li, this way please!” Tang Yitian nodded.

After that, he gave Jennifer a look and she immediately stood up and said with a smile,””Grandpa li, uncle Xu, I’m going to see how they’re doing with dinner,”

Feng Rao also stood up and said,””Jennifer, I’ll go with you!”

Jennifer smiled and nodded, then said to Tang Haoran,””Allan! You come with me too ...”

Xia ruofei did not wait for Tang Haoran to get up and said,””Jennifer, let Haoran stay and listen!”

Although Tang Haoran was still a child, he was Xia ruofei’s direct disciple. Besides, among the people present, only Xia ruofei and his master, as well as Li Yifu, were considered cultivators. So in Xia ruofei’s opinion, even if Jennifer and Feng Rao avoided it, Tang Haoran did not need to.

Tang Yitian couldn’t help but look at Li Yifu with a questioning look.

Li Yifu glanced at Tang Haoran and his eyes lit up. Then, he chuckled and said,””Yi Tian, let Haoran stay too!”

“Okay, Grandpa li!” Tang Yitian said.

Seeing that Li Yifu had put it that way, Jennifer smiled and bowed slightly before leaving the living room with Feng Jing.

After the guests were seated, Tang Yitian busied himself with making tea for everyone. Xia ruofei carried Tang Haoran and sat opposite Li Yifu.

Li Yifu looked at Tang Haoran as if he was looking at a piece of precious Jade. His eyes were practically glowing. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Brother Xia, I heard from Yitian that Haoran is already your disciple?” he asked with a smile.

Xia ruofei replied neither haughtily nor humbly,””Senior li, Haoran is quite talented. It just so happens that we are fated to be master and disciple, so I accepted him as my disciple ... By the way, you can call me RUO Fei! Otherwise, the seniority will be in a mess ...”

Xu Ziyuan couldn’t help but smile, while Tang Yitian looked at Li Yifu with eager eyes.

“It’s rare for me to meet a fellow Daoist, so I was eager ...”Li Yifu said with a smile.

Xu Ziyuan and Tang Yitian couldn’t help but look surprised when they heard this. Although they had already guessed it, they still found it hard to believe after Li Yifu confirmed it.

This senior Li Yifu’s background wasn’t small. Even Xu Ziyuan, the big boss of the Yixing society, had to respectfully call him “third uncle.”

Li Yifu’s father was the legendary leader of the Hong sect, li Jiuzhou. He had passed away a few years ago at the age of 126. He was definitely a super lucky Star.

Li Jiu Zhou had five children, and the only one still alive was the third – in – line Li Yifu.

It was said that when Li Jiu Zhou was young, he had met an extraordinary person who had taught him the ways of cultivation. That was why he had been able to live so long.

Li Yifu was the only one among all of Li Jiu Zhou’s children who had the physique for cultivation. He had also inherited Li Jiu Zhou’s legacy and was now a highly respected elder in the Hong sect.

This year, Li Yifu was nearly 90 years old, but he looked about the same age as Xu Ziyuan, who was in his early 70s. Everyone was quite eager to learn the magical cultivation method.

Previously, when Xia ruofei helped Tang Haoran to resolve the blockage in his meridians, Tang Yitian and Xu Ziyuan had already guessed it. However, when they heard Li Yifu’s personal confirmation today, they could not help but be shocked.

While Tang Yitian was shocked, his heart was also filled with ecstasy. Xia ruofei had accepted Tang Haoran as his personal disciple, and he even said that Tang Haoran was very talented in cultivation. Didn’t this mean that Tang Haoran could also become a legendary figure like li Jiuzhou and Li Yifu in the future?

Not to mention anything else, just the fact that he could live a long life was enough to make Tang Yitian ecstatic.

Which parent wouldn’t want their child to live a long and healthy life? Not to mention that Tang Yitian had a son at an old age. He was simply afraid of Tang Haoran falling from his hands or melting him in his mouth.

On the other side, Li Yifu continued to smile and said,””I can see that brother Xia’s cultivation level should not be much lower than mine, right? Even Haoran has obviously reached a higher level, so I think your inheritance must be extraordinary. ”

Tang Yitian and Xu Ziyuan looked at each other, then said,””Grandpa li, how about ... I leave with uncle Xu for a while?”

Li Yifu smiled and said,”it’s fine. You guys can just listen on the side. However, talent is the most important thing in cultivation. Without talent, no matter how hard you work, you won’t be able to achieve anything. So just listen to it, and remember not to tell others. ”

“Understood!” Tang Yitian and Xu Ziyuan both said seriously.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Senior Li, you’ve been cultivating for many years. Of course, I can’t compare to you.”

His inheritance was a top secret. Naturally, he didn’t want to talk about it. Besides, there were many cultivation methods in the Jade talisman. By comparison, one could see how precious the “great Dao Arts” was. Even if Li Yifu was Tang Yitian’s elder, Xia ruofei couldn’t casually reveal a little bit.

Li Yifu laughed and said,”brother Xia, it’s rare to meet a fellow Daoist. My hands are also a little itchy. Why don’t we have a fight?”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. He said with a troubled expression,””Senior li, this ...”

“We’ll stop there!” Li Yifu said,”I’ve been stuck in my current realm for a long time. Perhaps I can gain some insights from sparring with brother Xia? Brother Xia, please grant my wish!”
