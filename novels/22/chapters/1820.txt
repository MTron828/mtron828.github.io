Translator: 549690339

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but cry out in shock. She quickly said,””I ... I still have to go back! Don’t touch me ... Ah ...” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei laughed evilly,”you just said that uncle Ling went to Egret Island. He wouldn’t know that you didn’t return home, would he?” Besides, it’s so late now. I’ll be worried if you go back alone!”

Ling Qingxue’s eyes were like water. She glanced at Xia ruofei and said,””I’m the most unsafe person to be with you ...”

“How can that be? I can’t even wait to love you!” Xia ruofei chuckled.”Besides ... Proper exercise is good for the absorption of the medicine!”

After he finished speaking, he flipped over and pressed himself on Ling Qingxue, who screamed in shock. What followed was naturally another round of intense lovemaking ...

The next morning, Ling Qingxue, who had almost fallen apart from the torture the night before, rubbed her sleepy eyes and sat up on the bed. She realized that Xia ruofei was no longer in the room.

She furrowed her brows slightly, gathered the clothes that were scattered on the floor, and began to put them on one by one.

At this moment, Xia ruofei, who had heard the commotion outside, came upstairs and opened the door.

“Why didn’t you sleep a little longer?” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”it’s rare for you to come here. Don’t be in a hurry to go back to work!”

Ling Qingxue saw that Xia ruofei was still wearing an apron and knew that he must have gone to prepare breakfast for her. She could not help but feel a little warm in her heart.

“No!” Ling Qingxue said,”if I’m going to take a break soon, I’ll have to finish up my work as soon as possible!”

Xia ruofei said,”Qingxue, it wasn’t easy for me to help you get better. Don’t tire yourself out for a few more days. My work will be in vain!”

“It can’t be?” Ling Qingxue was a little uncertain.”It can’t be that serious, right?”

Xia ruofei laughed to himself but kept a straight face. “I’m not trying to scare you! If you’ve been overworked these few days and you’re nervous, the medicine you drank yesterday might have been in vain! Qingxue, that medicine used a lot of precious herbs. You can’t waste it. Most importantly, you’ll be wasting time!”

Naturally, Ling Qingxue did not know that Xia ruofei was just scaring her. Hearing this, she could not help but feel lost.”Then ... Then what should we do?”

Xia ruofei said seriously,”I suggest that you take a break from today onwards. Why don’t you just stay at the farm? look at the beautiful mountains and clear waters here. You can even look out at the sea from upstairs. It’ll be very helpful for you to relax!”

Ling Qingxue had completely believed him. She hesitated for a while before saying,””Then ... Then I’ll let my dad know ... But I have to go back to the company today. Even if I’m on leave, there’s still a lot of work that I have to hand over!”

Xia ruofei was overjoyed. He nodded seriously and said,””Mm, sure! Qingxue, after you hand over your work, go home and tidy up your clothes. Stay at the farm for a few days. We’ve been together for so long, but I haven’t had the chance to spend time with you!”

Since the decision had been made, Ling Qingxue did not dwell on the work. She was full of anticipation for the next few days alone with Xia ruofei. The environment on the farm was beautiful, and she could be considered to have placed her heart in the mountains and rivers.

“En!” Ling Qingxue nodded her head.

Xia ruofei wrapped his arm around Ling Qingxue’s waist and smiled.””Wash up first, then go downstairs for breakfast! There are brand new toiletries in the cabinet under the sink. Take them yourself!”

“I know!” Ling Qingxue smiled sweetly at Xia ruofei and strode towards the washroom. As she walked, she naturally twisted her waist. Xia ruofei was so angry that he almost couldn’t help but do it with this stunner on the spot.

After the two of them had their breakfast in the restaurant on the first floor, Ling Qingxue got into her car and left.

After seeing Ling Qingxue’s car off, Xia ruofei walked towards the general office building. He was going to use this free time to settle some work matters. When Ling Qingxue came over, he would not go to work if there was nothing to do.

These few days, the company was preparing to move and everyone was very busy. However, Xia ruofei did not have much to do. Some of his personal belongings had already been cleaned up in his office. As the chairman, he did not need to do the rest.

Xia ruofei was in the office signing the documents. He had already signed and agreed to the subsidy for buying cars and renting houses, as well as the expansion of the security Department. Dong Yun, pang Hao, and the others had already started to follow up with their respective tasks.

As for the manufacturing factory and the expansion of the farm, he would need to find some experts to verify them. Moreover, these two matters would involve dealing with the government and the bank, so Xia ruofei planned to do it after the relocation of the headquarters.

All that was left was some daily work.

Because of the need for the relocation of the headquarters, there were more areas where money was needed these days, including renting trucks, buses, and inviting the conference company to prepare for the opening ceremony.

Hence, in just one morning, Xia ruofei had already signed hundreds of thousands of contracts.

However, these should be spent, so Xia ruofei naturally did not feel the pinch.

In the morning, Ling Qingxue called to tell Xia ruofei that Ling Xiaotian had agreed to let her take half a month off.

The old man probably knew that his daughter had been tired during this period of time, so he found his conscience!

However, Ling Qingxue said that she had a lot of work to do, and she also had to go home to tidy up her clothes, so she might only be able to come in the evening.
