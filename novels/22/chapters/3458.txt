Chapter 3459: Record – breaking

Translator: 549690339

In fact, immortal Shanhe did not know how Xia ruofei could suddenly become so brave through the bronze mirror. They could not see the change in Xia ruofei’s spiritual power.

However, in front of Taoist Qing Xuan, immortal mountain river would not show any fear. He pretended to be reserved and followed Taoist Qing Xuan’s words, saying,””The” great Dao Arts “is the result of my many years of hard work. It has gathered the essence of countless cultivation techniques in my life. It is a masterpiece, and naturally can not be compared with ordinary cultivation techniques.”

His words were as good as not saying anything. He did not clearly state that Xia ruofei’s change was related to the great Dao chant and only praised it. However, to Daoist Qing Xuan, it was the great Dao chant’s credit.

Taoist master Qing Xuan could not help but show a look of admiration and said,””Brother mountain river, I’ve always heard that you’re extremely accomplished in cultivation theory. After seeing your disciple’s performance today, 1 know that the rumors are true!”

Immortal Shanhe looked at Xia ruofei on the screen of the copper mirror and felt strange. However, he did not show it and just laughed it off.”Daoist Qing Xuan, you flatter me!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Then, he changed the topic and said,””But… It seems like Daoist Qing Xuan…”

Daoist Qing Xuan laughed and said,”if your disciple can pass the fifteenth floor, I’ll admit defeat. I’ll give you the nascent formation pill!” However, it was still too early to talk about this! Maybe this child’s potential just exploded, and he won’t have any more energy after passing one or two more levels!”

In fact, how could immortal mountain river not have such a worry? However, he naturally wouldn’t back down, especially after Xia ruofei’s brilliant performance. He had to stabilize his aura even more.

Therefore, immortal mountain river laughed and said,””Daoist Qing Xuan! Then let’s wait and see!”

8th level of the trial Pagoda.

Xia ruofei didn’t stay on the 452nd step for too long. After a few minutes of rest, he steadily stepped onto the 453rd step.

The pressure now was slightly stronger than on the 450th step. However, after Xia ruofei’s spiritual power had broken through to the spiritualization realm, his control over all aspects had increased significantly. The most direct aspect was naturally his spiritual power. The current spiritual pressure could no longer cause him any negative effects.

Without the interference of the spiritual pressure, Xia ruofei naturally had an easier time dealing with it.

If he was already close to his limit at the four hundred and fiftieth step, and some of the pressure had even exceeded his limit, then he seemed to still have some strength left now.

It was just a breakthrough in his spiritual power, but the effect was so immediate.

After all, this was a major breakthrough, and spiritualism was a mental power realm that only nascent soul cultivators could reach.

Xia ruofei resumed the rhythm he had when he first stepped onto the 400th step. Even though it did not look very fast and he had to stop for a while at each step, it was very stable. He maintained his rhythm well and gave people a sense of security.

In the wise space that was enshrouded in purple clouds, when immortal mountain river saw Xia ruofei’s posture and pace of climbing the steps, the trace of worry in his heart immediately disappeared.

Daoist Qing Xuan was also very clear that if there were no major accidents in this game, he should have already lost.

However, he wasn’t dejected at all. On the contrary, he was watching Xia ruofei climb the stairway with great interest. His eyes were filled with admiration and curiosity.

After all, although the nascent formation pill was precious to him, it was not difficult to take out a bottle of it. As for an outstanding junior like Xia ruofei, shouldn’t he be helping him?

What Daoist Qing Xuan was really curious about was that Xia ruofei had clearly exhausted his strength and was about to be pushed out by the pressure of the stairway. At the last moment, he could actually put on such a wonderful reversal show. Was it really the credit of the “great Dao technique”?

For the first time, Qing Xuan Daoist priest was very interested in a cultivation method.

The two of them didn’t say anything. They just looked at Xia ruofei in the mirror and watched him climb up step by step at a steady pace.

Very quickly, Xia ruofei had reached the 465th step. Looking at his condition, although he was also struggling, he was obviously in a better state than when he was on the 450th step.

Immortal Shanhe guessed at four hundred and eighty, and Daoist priest qingxuan guessed at four hundred and fifty. The one whose answer was closer to the final result would win.

Now, Xia ruofei was already standing on the 465th step. This was a dividing line.

If Xia ruofei was eliminated on this level, then it would be a draw between immortal mountain river and Qing Xuan Taoist priest.

As long as he climbed one more step and successfully stabilized his body, the winner would be immortal mountain river.

When Xia ruofei stood firmly on the four hundred and sixty – fifth step, it meant that immortal mountain river was already in an undefeatable position.

Even the possibility of a draw was next to nothing.

He knew that Xia ruofei could at least last a few floors.

Therefore, Daoist Qing Xuan did not wait for Xia ruofei to continue climbing. He took out a bottle of nascent formation pills from his storage spiritual treasure and handed it to perfected mountain river. He said,”Brother mountain river, I’m willing to accept my loss. Your disciple is very capable! This bottle of pills is yours….”
