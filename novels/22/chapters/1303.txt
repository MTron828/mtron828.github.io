To President Lin, this was another dazzling achievement. Even the leaders at the headquarters would be shocked.

“No need to look!” The more President Lin thought about it, the more excited he became.”Brother Xia, as long as the quality of this batch of Cordyceps sinensis can reach the standard of these samples, we will buy as many as you have! The price will be 750 thousand Yuan per kilogram!”

Feng Rao’s heart started to waver. She had no idea where Xia ruofei had gotten such an impressive Cordyceps that could be sold at a sky – High price of 750000 Yuan per kilogram. She also had no idea how many of these Cordyceps that Xia ruofei had.

Thinking back to how Xia ruofei had confidently said that the 100 million he was in charge of had been settled, Feng Jing had a feeling that it was probably because of this deal.

She looked at Xia ruofei expectantly.

Xia ruofei didn’t beat around the bush and said directly,””President Lin, don’t worry! This time, there are at least 100 kg of wormgrass of the same quality. But can your Tongren Hall really eat all of them? I’ve left all of them to you, and I didn’t sell a single one!”

Director Lin and Feng Rao felt their mouths go dry and they had difficulty breathing.

It was really over a hundred kilograms!

President Lin seemed to see a bright future waving at him.

On the other hand, Feng Jing’s eyes were filled with the dancing red cash. The gap of one hundred million Yuan was no longer a problem ...

Of course, Dr. Huang and the others were not doing any better. The two young men even felt their legs go weak.

This was the first time they had seen this kind of Cordyceps that was usually the best of the best, which was rarely seen, actually being sold in the units of 100 kilograms. They felt that they were really ignorant and ill – informed in the past.

Xia ruofei seemed to think that the news was not shocking enough. He continued,””If you’re willing to acquire it, we can even maintain a relatively long – term partnership with Tongren Hall. We can continue to provide such aweto in the future ...”

Oh my God ... President Lin’s heart was in a state of shock. This wasn’t even a one – off deal, and they could even have a long – term cooperation in the future! Wasn’t this a replica of the iron – skinned Kaede fight from before?

The value of an iron Kaede bucket and this grade of aweto could not be mentioned in the same breath.

President Lin was already in his forties and was a senior executive at the Regional Manager level, but at this moment, he was standing there like a clay sculpture. He had lost his composure.

“President Lin ...” Xia ruofei tried to call out.

“Ah?” President Lin came back to his senses and saw Xia ruofei looking at him with an inquiring gaze. He quickly said,”brother Xia, no problem! No problem! We’ll take as many as you have! As long as the quality can meet the standards of these samples, nothing else is a problem!”

He spoke very quickly as if he was worried that Xia ruofei would change his mind if he was too slow.

“Didn’t you say on the phone that you’d have to apply to the headquarters if you exceeded your authority?”Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“There’s definitely no problem!”President Lin said. Brother Xia, I swear on my honor!”

If they were to reject such a deal, the leaders at the headquarters must be crazy. No! It was impossible for someone with water in their brain to make such a decision, unless they had sh * t in their brain! President Lin said in his heart.

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said,””How about this! It’s getting late, so we’ve prepared lunch in the cafeteria. Let’s go eat first, then ...”

“Brother Xia! I’m not in the mood to eat!” President Lin quickly said,”you should take me to see the goods first! I’m not in the mood to do anything before this deal is settled!”

“Don’t worry! It’s not the first time we’ve made a deal. ” Xia ruofei said,”the things are in my villa. Let’s go over and take a look after dinner. You can check them one by one without any problems!”

The reason why he had asked President Lin to bring a few more people over was actually because he had this intention in mind, in case there was a lack of manpower for the test later.

“Brother Xia, it’s not that exaggerated. Do you think we can’t trust you?” President Lin said,”I just want to quickly settle everything. It’s okay to eat a little later!”

“Even if you’re not hungry, elder Huang and the others can’t fight with you! Besides, I’m also hungry!” Xia ruofei said,”Mr. Lin, if you want this deal to go smoothly, you have to listen to me. Nothing is more important than eating now!”

Seeing that Xia ruofei had already put it this way, President Lin could only helplessly say,””Alright then ... But brother Xia, after we finish eating ...”

“Come to my house after dinner! It’s only two to three hundred meters away from this building. We’ll reach it soon if we walk!” Xia ruofei said.

“Alright, alright!” President Lin said,”then let’s have some work lunch for lunch. Don’t drink anymore. After all, we still have work to do ...”

If it was president Lin’s own idea, with a business worth hundreds of millions in front of him, what was the point of eating? However, Xia ruofei’s attitude was firm, so he could only go along with the host.

“Alright, alright, alright!” Xia ruofei said,”I’m not drinking at noon! Let’s have a few more drinks tonight!” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The group of people arrived at the canteen downstairs. It had already been prepared. When everyone arrived, Cao tieshu’s wife took care of the arrangements and brought out the dishes.

Initially, Xia ruofei had prepared some of Drunken Eight Immortals ‘white wine. However, since President Lin was in such a hurry, he cleared the wine.

The Taoyuan vegetables were the main ingredient, and there were also some special dishes from the three mountains. Cao tieshu’s wife’s cooking skills were quite good, and the table of dishes could be said to be full of color, smell, and taste.
