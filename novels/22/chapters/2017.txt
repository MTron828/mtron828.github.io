2018 Operation (2)

During the day, he even went to a few local English websites in Turin to look at them. The security in Turin had become worse, and robbery, rape, and other crimes had been on the rise.

Without a doubt, this was all thanks to the Gehrman family.

Therefore, eliminating them was equivalent to getting rid of evil for the people.

Lui hai drove Xia ruofei out of the building and into the night.

At the sanguine Dusk Bar.

An ordinary Horton car slowly stopped on the side of the road one street away from the bar, and a young man who was smoking against a light post immediately walked over.

Lui hai rolled down the window and asked lightly,Is target number 9 still inside

They numbered the targets according to their importance. Then, considering the distance and the importance of the targets, they chose the Scarlet Dusk Bar as their first stop.

The young man said respectfully,Big brother hai, he went in at six and hasn’t come out. We have an unfamiliar brother watching us in the bar! Target number nine is in the bar’s Supreme private room, that’s his exclusive private room!

Lui hai nodded,okay, you continue to be on standby! Inform the brothers inside to withdraw first. In addition, once the bar is in chaos, you all must leave immediately! Don’t stay here!

Alright, big brother hai! The young man nodded in response and then retreated into the distance.

Lui hai turned to Xia ruofei, asking respectfully,Mr. Xia, what do you think

Show me the photo of the ninth target! Xia ruofei said calmly.

Yes! Lui hai answered.

All the information had been prepared. Lui hai took out a photo with the Arabic number 9 on the back and handed it to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei took a look, nodded, and kept it in his arms. Then he said,Ah hai, you wait here! I’ll be back soon ...

Mr. Xia, I will go with you! Lui hai said hurriedly.

Xia ruofei waved his hand.You’ll affect my actions. Ah hai, just do the liaison work and stay as far away from the scene as possible. I don’t want any accidents, understand

Lui hai couldn’t help but smile bitterly. He was at least one of the top three fighters in the Italy branch, but he was despised by Xia ruofei ...

However, even if he had more courage, he would not dare to go against Xia ruofei’s will. Moreover, he did not think that there was anything wrong with Xia ruofei’s words. They were not on the same level at all. He might really become a burden to Xia ruofei.

After Xia ruofei gave his orders, he immediately opened the door and got out of the car without any hesitation.

......

The music in the sanguine dusk was deafening. Everyone on the dance floor raised their arms and twisted their bodies to the rhythm of the music. Under the flashing lights, they looked like a group of demons dancing.

Turin had a lot of quiet bars, and the locals enjoyed their leisure time. They would chat with their friends over soft music and drink coffee.

However, there were a few bars that were as popular as the sanguine dusk. Most of the people who frequented these bars were either problematic young men or rebellious young ladies.

Such a place was naturally a place to hide filth. Selling alcohol to minors was child’s play. Some people in the bar had blurred eyes, lying on the sofa with their eyes rolled back like dead pigs. They even twitched a few times from time to time. It was obvious that they had a drug overdose. There were also people who took off their pants and tied them together in the dark corners of the bar ...

In the VIP room, a young man with a six – pointed star pattern on the back of his hair was holding a hot girl on one side, slightly shaking his head to the rhythm of the music.

There were many men and women around his age in the room, and they were all drinking happily.

There were also two burly Men in Black suits and sunglasses standing guard at the door of the VIP room.

The young man with the six – pointed star hairstyle was one of the heirs of the Geerman family. He was also the grandson of the current head of the Geerman family. His name was Moyes Geerman.

Moyes was handsome. He had deep eyes unique to Italians, a high nose, and a handsome face. If he were to wear a tailored suit, he would definitely be an elegant young master.

However, his friends who were familiar with him knew that there was an evil soul hidden in Moyes’s bright skin.

Moyes, who had been influenced by the Mafia since he was a child, could be said to be cruel and merciless. He was also very arrogant and even a little perverted.

The first time Moyes killed someone was when he was twelve.

Because the maid at home had accidentally spilled a little yogurt on him, he was furious and strangled the Philippines maid with a rope.

His father, REM Gehrman, had been there at the time. Not only did REM not stop Moyes, but he had also praised his ruthlessness. In their eyes, these maids were no different from goods. What was the big deal with the death of a maid Just report an accident and pay a sum of money. The families of the Philippines women would be happy to settle it privately and would not pursue the matter.

One could imagine how twisted Moyes’s personality would be if he grew up in such an environment.

Just a week ago, a waiter at the sanguine Dusk Bar had to rush to the VIP room a few minutes late because he had other work on hand when the call bell rang.

Then, Moyes, who suddenly went crazy, tied the waiter up and cut him dozens of times. The screaming lasted for two to three hours. In the end, his voice was hoarse and he was tortured beyond recognition. Moyes then ordered his men to drag the waiter out and throw him off the overpass ...

Moyes had even proudly shown off to others for a few days.

These were all described in the information collected by Lu zhengfeng. After Xia ruofei read it, he only had four words in his heart He deserved to die!

Xia ruofei wore a cap and entered the bar. He walked around the dance floor, aiming for the VIP room.

Although the dance floor was crowded with people, Xia ruofei seemed to be taking a leisurely stroll as he walked past them.

The people in front of him seemed to be pushed away by a gentle force, making way for Xia ruofei.

In the corridor outside the VIP room, there were also two tall and burly Men in Black. They looked warily at Xia ruofei who was walking straight towards them. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei ignored the two men and went straight to the door of the VIP room. Before the two men could scold him, he bent down and punched them in the abdomen.

The two of them groaned and fell limply to the ground.

When the people in the bar saw that there was a fight, not only did they not flee in panic, but they whistled excitedly.

The atmosphere in this kind of bar was too hot, and it could be said that fighting was a common occurrence. The people who came here more or less had some gang background, so they were not afraid of fighting at all.

Xia ruofei did not stop and kicked the door of the private room.

In the private room, Moyes also heard the faint sound outside the door. Before he could scold them, the door suddenly opened to the left and right. The two men in Black who were on guard in the private room didn’t even have time to Dodge subconsciously and were knocked unconscious by the door.

When Xia ruofei walked in, the two doors were still shaking. It was clear how much strength he had used.

The two men in Black wouldn’t wake up for a while.

Xia ruofei quickly looked around and immediately locked on to Moyes, the target of the operation.

His figure flashed, and a shadow streaked across. He had already arrived in front of Moyes.

Just as Moyes looked frightened, Xia ruofei’s palm had already hit his head.

The life in Moyes’s eyes quickly disappeared. His eyes lost their light and he fell limply to the ground.

Only then did the people in the room react. Xia ruofei had already thrown the photo with the Arabic number 9 on Moyes’s body. Then, he rushed to the dance floor and quickly disappeared into the crowd ...
