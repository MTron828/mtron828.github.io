Chapter 374: Body tempering soup (1)

Xia ruofei’s eyes fell on the first page and his eyes widened ...

It was blank!

It was actually a blank!

This page, which looked like paper but was not paper, like silk but was not silk, had nothing on it except for some tiny golden stripes. Whether it was words or pictures, there was nothing ...

Xia ruofei quickly flipped to the back and finished the thin seven to eight pages.

There was no miracle, and every page was empty.

Your sister!

I’ve been brewing my emotions for a long time. You’ve taken off everything and you’re showing me this?

Xia ruofei had the urge to tear the booklet into pieces.

However, he remembered that he had tried his best just now, but he couldn’t damage the booklet in the slightest, so he decisively gave up this unrealistic idea to avoid humiliating himself.

Xia ruofei flipped to the first page unwillingly and observed every detail carefully. He was just short of using a magnifying glass to check it inch by inch.

Unfortunately, he still could not find any clues. The Golden patterns did not have any pattern. At least, Xia ruofei could not find any pattern after analyzing for a long time.

Xia ruofei was very disappointed. A stone room had suddenly appeared in the new space. He took out the booklet with great effort, but it turned out to be a wordless heavenly book. The other four items looked good too, but he could not take them out.

Is the heavens playing with me?

His interest waned, and he prepared to throw the booklet on the stone platform and leave.

However, he did not give up, so he opened the booklet again.

Since the naked eye couldn’t see anything, what about the heart? Xia ruofei said in his heart.

He had obtained the spirit map space for a long time, so he was very familiar with the use of the power of the mind. He had also made a preliminary examination of the stone tablet and found nothing strange about it, but when he immersed his mind in it, he immediately discovered its wonders.

Could this be the same approach?

Xia ruofei immediately focused on the first page of the booklet.

The invisible mental force acted on the small booklet. One second, two seconds, three seconds ...

Xia ruofei still couldn’t sense anything unusual. It was like an ordinary page and his mind power couldn’t penetrate it.

Xia ruofei revealed a bitter smile. It seemed that he would really gain nothing this time ...

But at this time, a magical scene appeared. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

His mind was indeed unable to sense any changes, but he could see with his naked eyes that the Golden stripes on the page were gradually moving under the influence of the power of his mind.

Xia ruofei’s spirit was lifted. It was a good thing that there was a change!

He hurriedly continued to concentrate, and the invisible power continued to be output, acting on that page.

The Golden stripes also moved faster and faster, and then began to combine and break down ...

Gradually, Xia ruofei saw the Golden stripes forming lines of words.

And these were not strange characters, they were just normal Chinese characters, but they were all in traditional Chinese.

It might be a little difficult to write in traditional Chinese, but Xia ruofei had no problem recognizing characters.

Lines of golden text appeared on the page, floating in the wind.

Xia ruofei stared at the words, trying hard to remember the content. The joy on his face grew.

This first page recorded a prescription, but this prescription was not used to cure diseases, but to temper the body and strengthen the bones and muscles of martial artists.

This prescription called “body tempering soup” had two versions. The complete version needed the petals of the strange flower, while the simplified version didn ‘t. Of course, the efficacy of the simplified version was much weaker than the complete version.

However, according to the author of this “body tempering soup,” even if the petals of the exotic flower were removed, the body tempering soup would still be many times stronger than ordinary body tempering medicine.

Of course, in this prescription, the petals were not called “strange flower petals”. Xia ruofei recognized them at a glance through the illustrations. He was too familiar with these strange flower petals.

Hence, after obtaining the spirit map space for so long, Xia ruofei finally knew the official name of the nameless plant and the strange flower petals on it.

The author of ‘body tempering soup’ had named the nameless plant spirit heart tree and the strange flower spirit Heart Flower. The author had not mentioned the name of the fruit produced by the spirit heart tree. Xia ruofei thought to himself with some evil interest, Could it be called the spirit heart fruit?

However, this was only a fleeting thought in his mind. Now, his main energy was naturally used to memorize the contents recorded on this page.

The herbs required for the body tempering soup were all very common Chinese medicinal herbs, which could be easily purchased from any Chinese medicine pharmacy.

Apart from the strange flower petals, the Kasaya should be called the spirit Heart Flower petals now.

There wasn’t much content on this page, and the Golden text gradually showed up to the last few lines. The front was full of the body tempering soup’s content, including what medicinal herbs were needed, the amount of each medicinal herb, the brewing process, some precautions, and so on.

Xia ruofei committed them to memory.

Just as Xia ruofei thought that the page was about to end, he saw a new prescription.

“Pregnant spirit soup” was the name of the new prescription.

However, at this time, it was already showing the last few lines, so the content on this page only briefly introduced the effects of the gestation soup.

Xia ruofei was surprised to find out that the spirit nourishment soup was used to help with the training of one’s spiritual power. The first ingredient that was required to brew the spirit nourishment soup was called ‘spirit heart fruit’. As for whether the spirit heart fruit was the fruit from the spirit heart tree, Xia ruofei had no idea.

Because at this point, the content of this page had already ended.

He estimated that the next page should have more detailed illustrations and other required medicinal herbs.

Xia ruofei maintained the output of his spiritual power and read it a few times. After memorizing the contents of the page, he retracted his spiritual power.

Xia ruofei immediately took out his notebook and pen and prepared to jot down everything he had just written down. After all, a good memory was not as good as a bad pen. What he had recorded now was all in an instant. It was inevitable that he would forget it if he took a long time. However, he would not have to worry about forgetting it if he wrote it down in a notebook.

However, when Xia ruofei opened his notebook and was about to take down notes, he stopped and smiled bitterly.

It turned out that after he had removed his mental energy, those golden characters still existed, and did not return to the original golden stripes without any pattern.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but Pat his forehead. He shouldn’t have such a preconceived idea! He had thought that the Golden characters would return to their original positions with the withdrawal of his spiritual energy. Therefore, after the characters were completely revealed, he maintained his spiritual energy for a long time to memorize the contents.

He didn’t expect it to be useless!

However, it was a good thing that these words would not disappear. It would be much easier to read them next time.

Xia ruofei thought of the “spirit heart fruit” mentioned in the last few lines. He couldn’t help but want to confirm if it was the spirit fruit that he had already kept five of.

So he flipped to the second page, held his breath, and focused his attention on the page. He was ready to use his mental power to return the Golden stripes to their original positions.

However, Xia ruofei felt a slight pain on his head. It turned out that he had used up all his mental energy while he was restoring the contents of the first page.

He didn’t expect that he would consume so much energy in just a few minutes.

It seemed that he could not restore the contents of the second page for the time being, Xia ruofei thought with a bitter smile.

Hence, he kept the booklet close to his chest and walked out of the stone room. Xia ruofei was not in the mood to continue exploring the stone room. He only wanted to restore the contents of the booklet.

Therefore, he quickly left the cave and returned to the original space.

Xia ruofei was prepared to use a petal of the spirit Heart Flower to recover his spiritual energy and then continue to study the booklet.
