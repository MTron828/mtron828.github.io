2277 Expanding the herb garden (1)

Because miles Pharmaceutical Group was not a listed company, and there were no executive shares, employee shares, or other legal prohibitions, and 100% of the pharmaceutical group’s shares were actually in the hands of the Liu family, the stock ownership change process was relatively not too complicated.

After Xia ruofei had arranged the work, he didn’t have to worry about it anymore. Of course, as the shareholder, he still had to attend and sign the documents tomorrow. However, he didn’t have to worry about the early coordination and preparation.

Qin Yanan and he Yu were busy coordinating with the people behind them, while Xia ruofei went back into the house and locked the doors and windows. Then, he walked into the bedroom and summoned the spirit painting scroll from his palm.

He used his mind power to check the surrounding situation. After making sure it was safe, he entered the space.

As soon as he entered the mountain sea realm, Xia ruofei saw a flash of white light in front of him. He subconsciously used the invisible force of space to confine it. Then, he saw the realm Fox Bai Qingqing floating in front of him in a strange posture. Xia ruofei could not help but laugh when he saw her grimacing.

With a wave of his hand, he removed the seal, and Bai Qingqing fell to the ground.

“This is too much! You tricked me the moment we met!” Bai Qingqing transmitted her voice in dissatisfaction.

“Who asked you to launch a surprise attack?” Xia ruofei chuckled.

“Isn’t it because it’s too boring here?” Bai Qingqing pouted and sent a voice transmission,”when are we going to explore this barren world again? Don’t forget that you also need world stones to upgrade this small space!”

As there was Bai Qingqing in the space, whose intelligence was not lower than that of a human, Xia ruofei was now used to the feeling of being in a closed space. He did not want to have a pair of curious eyes “watching” the battle in the space while he was rolling around with Ling Qingxue.

Of course, with the current situation, it would be difficult for him to have sex with Ling Qingxue.

Xia ruofei smiled.”I’ll be busy for a while. I don’t plan to go out for the time being.”

He continued to ask,”the spatial rules here are so profound, are they not enough for you to comprehend?” Why do you keep thinking about going out?”

Bai Qingqing said gloomily,’cultivation can’t be eaten! You humans all know how to strike a balance between work and rest. I’ve been comprehending the spatial laws every day, don’t you think I’m tired of it?”

Xia ruofei laughed.”I saw your energy earlier. You didn’t feel bored at all!”

In the past, eight out of ten times Xia ruofei entered the space, he would see Bai Qingqing feeling the fluctuations of the laws of space. She would ignore him when he suddenly appeared in the space. He did not expect her to be bored of him now. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Bai Qingqing said,”I was in a hurry to evolve before.” Now that he had used up all his world stones, he was still far from the next evolution! Who can stand living like an ascetic every day!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. So this little guy was working so hard because it was on the verge of evolution and wanted to break through the bottleneck in one go. Now that it had successfully evolved, it had become lazy.

“I know!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”after I’m done with my work, I’ll take you out for a walk again ...”

Bai Qingqing rolled her eyes and said,””Why don’t you ... Take me to the outside world to play? It’s so annoying to stay in this small space every day ...”

Xia ruofei hesitated for a moment. He was not worried that Bai Qingqing would take the opportunity to escape after leaving. In fact, he did not restrict Bai Qingqing’s freedom at all. If she wanted to leave the medium, he would not stop her.

Xia ruofei’s concern was that if Bai Qingqing went out of control, she might cause a lot of trouble.

When the little fellow was in the medium, Xia ruofei could still rely on his strong control of the space to imprison it at any time. Once he went out, it was so fast that even if Xia ruofei’s cultivation had improved greatly, he might not be able to control it with a single mistake.

Bai Qingqing’s claws and teeth were extremely sharp. She could easily cut through a world stone as if it was tofu. If she were to attack anyone, they would definitely end up with a gutted stomach. If such a thing were to happen, it would be quite troublesome.

“Why don’t you say something!” Bai Qingqing said,”it’s so boring to stay in this small space ...”

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said,””I ... I’ll consider it! However, you have to promise me first that you will listen to me after we leave this place. You absolutely can not act recklessly. Without my permission, you are absolutely not allowed to attack others. Otherwise, we will go our separate ways and don’t work together to find world stones. ”

Xia ruofei’s words had a certain deterrent effect on Bai Qingqing. After all, the world was so big. Even if Bai Qingqing’s ability to sense the world stone was far better than Xia ruofei ‘s, it would still be quite difficult for her to find the world stone on her own.

Just like the time in the tomb, Bai Qingqing could also sense the location of the world stone, but with her strength, she could only look at it. If Xia ruofei had not helped, she might not have been able to obtain the world stone even if she had a few more years.

Moreover, most of the earth was covered by seawater. Many cultivators liked to find a small island overseas to use as their abode. Therefore, the probability of world stones appearing in the sea was relatively high. To Bai Qingqing, if she wanted to find world stones in the vast sea, she would need Xia ruofei’s help even more.
