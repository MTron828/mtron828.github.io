2446 The future is limitless if you follow me (1)

Liu chengfeng was still unconscious, but it didn’t affect Xia ruofei from feeling the heaven – defying function of the soul seal.

The moment the mother – child seal formed a connection, Xia ruofei knew that he could destroy Liu chengfeng’s soul with a single thought.

And according to the description of the soul seal, no matter how far the two were, this soul restraint would not be affected.

What was even more terrifying was that even if Liu chengfeng’s cultivation increased in the future, even if he had heaven – defying luck and his cultivation even surpassed Xia ruofei ‘s, he would not be able to get rid of the control of the soul seal. With the growth of cultivation and time, the connection between the child seal and Liu chengfeng’s sea of consciousness would become closer and closer. In the end, they would basically become one.

It could be said that once the child seal was branded in his sea of consciousness, Liu chengfeng would never be able to get rid of it for the rest of his life.

Of course, because his soul was being controlled, Liu chengfeng could not even think of getting rid of it.

Xia ruofei looked at the unconscious Liu chengfeng. He did not feel guilty at all.

That day, if Liu chengfeng had not been greedy and provoked Xia ruofei, Xia ruofei would not have captured and imprisoned him.

It could be said that Liu chengfeng’s ending today was mostly his own fault.

Besides, it was not necessarily a bad thing for his soul to be controlled by Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei was not a bloodthirsty person, and he would not sacrifice Liu chengfeng for no reason. Because of Liu chengfeng’s absolute loyalty, Xia ruofei would not be stingy with cultivation resources. At least in cultivation, Liu chengfeng’s future achievements would be much higher than when he had not met Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and removed the spatial cage.

The invisible force of space carried him and the unconscious Liu chengfeng, and slowly landed on a patch of grass.

This place was very far from the place where the free laborers worked, and there was a tall mountain in the middle.

Without the imprisonment of the space cage, Liu chengfeng was exposed to an environment with extremely rich spiritual Qi.

Xia ruofei didn’t try to save Liu chengfeng. In such an environment, Liu chengfeng slowly woke up. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Liu chengfeng’s eyes were filled with confusion when he first woke up. However, his body quickly shook and he looked at Xia ruofei with respect.

Liu chengfeng kneeled on the ground and said respectfully,””Master!”

Now that Liu chengfeng knew that Xia ruofei had planted a soul seal in his sea of consciousness, he naturally understood why Xia ruofei kept using her spiritual power to suppress him. He was very clear that he would be under Xia ruofei’s control for the rest of his life.

However, this was the magic and horror of the soul seal. Even if Liu chengfeng knew everything, he still had a kind of admiration and respect for Xia ruofei from the bottom of his heart. There was no trace of hatred at all.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,””In the future, you can call me Mr. Xia in front of others.”

“Yes! Master!” Liu chengfeng knelt on the ground and answered without hesitation.

“Get up!” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

“Thank you, master!” Liu chengfeng said. Then, he stood up and stood in front of Xia ruofei with his hands by his side.

Liu chengfeng could no longer have any other thoughts, so Xia ruofei did not intend to deliberately hide the matter of the spirit map space.

“Liu chengfeng, what do you think of this place?” Xia ruofei asked indifferently.

“Master, this place is the best place for cultivation,” Liu chengfeng said respectfully.”I’ve read some ancient books in the sect. The so – called paradises recorded in them are nothing but slums compared to your abode!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”what if this is just a spatial treasure?”

Liu chengfeng couldn’t help but open his eyes wide in shock. After a while, he said,””This place ... Master, are you saying that we’re in the same magical abode?”

He couldn’t help but look at the vast space around him again, and his face revealed a look of disbelief.

Xia ruofei smiled lightly and did not explain. He brought Liu chengfeng out of the spirit map space and returned to the house outside.

As soon as Liu chengfeng returned to the outside world, he immediately felt the familiar environment. He had been cultivating on earth for decades, so he was very familiar with the environment.

Liu chengfeng did not have the time to look at the furnishings in the room. He felt his vision blur and was once again brought into the spirit map space by Xia ruofei.

“Now you believe me?” Xia ruofei asked.

“I didn’t mean to question you, master ...” Liu chengfeng quickly replied in fear.

There was a huge wave in his heart. Although the soul seal had controlled his soul and made him absolutely loyal to Xia ruofei, it did not stop him from thinking independently, nor did it turn him into a walking corpse that only followed orders mechanically.

Liu chengfeng had never heard of such a vast space that could allow living things to survive. He didn’t even dare to think about it.

At this moment, his admiration and respect for Xia ruofei had reached a higher level.

Xia ruofei smiled.”By the way, I’m not a nascent soul senior. I’m only 27 years old.”

Liu chengfeng was dumbfounded once again. He stood still like a statue. After a long while, he asked in disbelief,””Master, then ... Then your cultivation ...”

“Not much higher than you.” Xia ruofei said,”I’m only at refined Qi level 8 now, but I should be able to break through to refined Qi level 9 soon.”
