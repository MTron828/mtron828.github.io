Chapter 138: Chapter 135 bidding farewell to the old and welcoming the new

Xia ruofei’s philosophy from the beginning to the end was to take the high – end route. Even the ordinary vegetables he grew were several grades higher than the ones on the market. Xia ruofei had considered many factors when it came to choosing the species of the fruit tree. He sat on a big rock at the foot of the mountain for a long time before he thought of two types of fruit trees – lychee and cherry. The prices of these two fruits were relatively high, and the viewing pleasure of the fruit trees was very strong after they formed a forest. There was no need to talk about lychees. They were commonly planted in the South. There were many lychees in Sanshan city. In the thousand – year – old West Zen temple, there was an ancient Phoenix from the Song Dynasty. Every summer, it would still bear bright red fruits. Therefore, there was no problem planting lychees here. As for cherries, Xia ruofei liked to eat them. Furthermore, they were very expensive on the market. A kilogram of ordinary cherries cost tens of Yuan. However, most of the cherries were planted in the North. He didn’t know if the climate in the South was suitable for the growth of cherry trees. Xia ruofei was not in a hurry to go back, so he took out his phone and searched for information online. Indeed, some places in the southeast province had a tradition of planting cherry trees, but most of them were in the northern mountainous areas. Sanshan city was located on the eastern coast of the southeast province. The climate was hot and humid, so it might not be suitable for the planting of cherry trees. This was especially true for big cherry, who basically came from Shandong. However, Xia ruofei still decided to give it a try. He was confident in the spirit map space and believed that with the help of the space pool and the petals of the strange flower, he would definitely succeed. Furthermore, if the cherry plantation in Sanshan city was successful, the advantage would be obvious. Cherries could only be stored for a short time. They could only be stored for three days at most after being picked. Even if they were stored in the refrigerator, they would not last more than a week. Therefore, if cherries from other places wanted to enter the Sanshan market, they could only rely on air transport or cold chain transportation. In this case, the local high – Quality cherries naturally had an unparalleled advantage. Xia ruofei still maintained his military habits. Since he had already made up his mind to fight, he would not think about it anymore and just put it into action. He decided to settle the matter of the fruit tree seedlings after the new year. Xia ruofei had already woken up a little late. After walking around for a long time, it was almost lunchtime. Hence, he walked back home while taking a walk. It was the New Year’s Eve dinner in the evening, so everyone had a simple lunch. After eating, they went back to their rooms to rest for a while. They got up at three in the afternoon and made dumplings together in the restaurant on the first floor. The Chinese New Year’s Eve dinner in the South was usually held earlier than in the North, where people would not have dinner while watching the Spring Festival Gala. Most of the time, after everyone finished eating and cleaned up the dishes, the family would sit together to watch the party. When it was past FiveO’ clock, Hu ‘Zi’s mother had already prepared the New Year’s Eve dinner. Plates of delicious – looking dishes were served on the table. Then, she took the dumplings that everyone had made to the kitchen. When Hu Zi’s mother was still cooking the dumplings, Lin Qiao couldn’t help but secretly grab a piece of beef and put it in her mouth. Ye Lingyun, on the other hand, sat upright and still. He was still standing and sitting like a Bell, just like he was in the Army. Even when he was sitting, his back was straight. When Hu ‘Zi’s mother served the dumplings that she had cooked, everyone went to the table and started eating. Xia ruofei had specially opened a bottle of red wine. It was given to Xia ruofei by the purchasing agent of President Zheng of West River moon. Xia ruofei did not know much about wine, but President Zheng’s Red wine was definitely not cheap. Last time, at Xia ruofei’s class gathering, President Zheng’s gift of a bottle of 1985 Petrus cost more than 1000 US dollars. This bottle would definitely not be any worse than the wine from that day. As he was pouring wine for everyone, Xia ruofei suddenly had an idea. The time in the Suan NI’s space was 30 times faster and there was a unique environment. If the wine was well preserved, especially white wine, it would be more fragrant as it aged. If he could get some wine and put it in there, wouldn’t he be able to get super – old wine very quickly? Those 30 – year – old and 50 – year – old wines that were sold at sky – High prices on the market were too weak! With this thought in mind, Xia ruofei couldn’t wait to go buy, buy, buy. He resisted the urge to pour everyone’s wine. Xia ruofei raised his glass and smiled.”Auntie, Qiao’ er, Ling Yun, it’s fate that we’re all gathered together for the new year. Let’s have a toast!” I also wish all of us a smooth and prosperous coming year!” “Cheers!” “Cheers!” Everyone raised their glasses and clinked them together before drinking. Even Hu Zi’s mother took a small sip, while Lin Qiao took a big gulp. As soon as the wine entered her stomach, her little face immediately blushed, looking very moving. “Slow down ...” Hu Zi’s mother said as she stared at Lin Qiao. Lin Qiao stuck out her tongue mischievously and said,”I know!” “Come, come, come. Everyone, have some food ...” Hu Zi’s mother called out.”Let’s see if what I’ve made is to your taste.” Xia ruofei smiled.”Aunty, Ling Yun and I don’t have any other relatives now. In the past few years in the Army, we had to prepare for combat during the new year and other festivals. We would sometimes have to take a few bites at the Sentry post for the New Year’s Eve dinner. So, this sumptuous New Year’s Eve dinner that you have prepared is definitely the best we have had in all these years!” Ye linyun nodded in agreement. Xia ruofei took a piece of braised carp and tasted it. “”Mm! Delicious! Aunty, this is the taste of the home we’ve always dreamed of ...” “You really know how to talk ...” Hu Zi’s mother’s eyes turned red again.”If you like it, Auntie will make it for you often in the future. Hu Zi used to like my braised fish the most ...” Lin Qiao glanced at her mother and said,””Mom ... It’s the new year, so let’s not talk about these sad things ...” Hu ‘Zi’s mother wiped the corners of her eyes and said with a smile,””Don’t worry, mom’s fine ... I’m happy! Even though Hu is no longer around, RUO Fei is taking care of us now. I’m feeling better now, and you’ve solved your problem of going to school. Life is so good now!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”aunty is right!” In the future, we must be happy. Hu Zi will definitely feel gratified even if he is in heaven! Let’s celebrate the new year together every year from now on, and everyone will be so happy!” After that, Xia ruofei turned to ye Lingyun and said,””Ling Yun, class monitor Lin took great care of you when he was still around. Please give Auntie and Qiao’ er a toast on his behalf!” “Yes!” Ye linyun immediately stood up with his glass.
