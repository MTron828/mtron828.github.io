Yang Xincheng heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that.

Even though Chen Xuan had only been in the company for a short time, yang Xincheng had some understanding of him.

Even though Chen Xuan always had a warm smile on his face and spoke to everyone in a friendly manner, yang Xincheng could always feel that there was a barrier between him and Chen Xuan. Even Chen Xuan’s friendly attitude gave him a cold and arrogant feeling. This feeling was extremely contradictory, but it was how yang Xincheng truly felt.

Other than that, Chen Xuan didn’t mention how amazing his skills were. However, there were some flaws that people with amazing skills had as well. For example, there were times when he was a little stubborn and stuck to his principles. This was especially true when it came to technical matters. If Chen Xuan felt that something was right, he would stick to it even if the other party’s seniority and position were higher than his.

Of course, the truth eventually proved that Chen Xuan was right. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

When yang Xincheng came down the stairs, he was worried that Chen Xuan would be unwilling to meet the chairman. If that were the case, things would be difficult for him.

Fortunately, Chen Xuan was just sticking to his principles. The deal was not low, so the thing he was worried about did not happen.

Yang Xincheng led Chen Xuan into the elevator and up another flight of stairs. After all, an ordinary employee’s elevator card wouldn’t be able to reach the Chairman’s floor.

At the door of Xia ruofei’s office, his team of assistants had already arrived. The person in charge of the team, Qin Yanan, was sitting at the work desk by the door.

Seeing yang Xincheng and Chen Xuan walk down the stairs, Qin Yanan stood up with a smile and greeted them.””Mr. Yang!”

Then, she smiled and nodded at Chen Xuan.

Yang Xincheng was now the new department head of the Paradise Corporation, and Chen Xuan’s reputation as a technical expert was growing by the day. Therefore, Qin Yanan naturally wouldn’t neglect them.

“Yanan, the chairman wants to talk to Chen Xuan. I’ll send him over.” Yang Xincheng said in a friendly manner.

The team that Qin Yanan was in charge of was dedicated to Xia ruofei. Even if yang Xincheng’s status had risen sharply, he would not put on airs in front of Qin Yanan.

“Yes!” Qin Yanan nodded slightly.”The chairman has already given the order. Chen Xuan can go in directly after he arrives.”

“Alright! Thank you, Yanan!” Yang Xincheng replied hurriedly,”I’ll send Chen Xuan in for a while. I’ll be out soon.”

Even though Xia ruofei was summoning Chen Xuan, Qin Yanan wouldn’t sternly stop yang Xincheng. She knew that yang Xincheng’s actions were just for show, so she immediately smiled and nodded.”Of course, no problem. Please come in!”

After she finished speaking, she gently knocked on the door, then pushed it open and made an inviting gesture.

Yang Xincheng and Chen Xuan both nodded at Qin Yanan before walking into the office.

Qin Yanan closed the office door and returned to her desk to continue working.

She did not prepare any tea because Xia ruofei had specifically ordered her to do so. Xia ruofei had told her not to prepare anything and to stop anyone from visiting while he was conversing with Chen Xuan. No one was allowed to interrupt the conversation.

This “anyone” included Feng Jing.

Although the request was a little strange, Qin Yanan naturally wouldn’t ask too much. In fact, she would definitely carry it out to the letter.

Therefore, she personally guarded the door. Not only was no one allowed to enter, but she would also not go in and disturb them.

In the office, Xia ruofei was sitting on the office chair with his back to the door. He was looking at the scenery of the three mountains through the glass window.

The back of the office chair was very high. From yang Xincheng’S and Chen Xuan’s angle, they could only see a little bit of Xia ruofei’s hair.

“Chairman, I’ve brought Chen Xuan over,” yang Xincheng said carefully.

Xia ruofei turned his chair around and looked at Chen Xuan. Then, he smiled and said,””You’ve worked hard, President yang. You can go and do your work!”

“Alright!” Yang Xincheng replied. Alright! Chairman, I’ll take my leave first!”

Yang Xincheng left in a hurry. Soon, only Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan were left in the spacious office.

“Please take a seat!” Xia ruofei raised his hand and pointed at the chair opposite his desk, smiling.

“Thank you, Chairman!” Chen Xuan said. He sat down opposite Xia ruofei and looked up at him, waiting for his instructions.

At this moment, Chen Xuan’s heart was in a mess.

Of course, he wasn’t nervous at all. In Chen Xuan’s eyes, no matter how successful an entrepreneur was in the secular world, he wouldn’t be pressured in the slightest.

However, he could not figure out why Xia ruofei wanted to meet him alone. He was also worried that yang Xincheng’s strong recommendation might make Xia ruofei want to promote him.

In fact, he just wanted to be a basic programmer quietly. He had no intention of being promoted.

In reality, Chen Xuan’s performance had already tempted yang Xincheng. Even though he had only been in the company for a short time, yang Xincheng had already thought of promoting him to take charge of a project team. With Chen Xuan’s capabilities, he was more than capable of leading a project team.

However, Chen Xuan rejected the offer. He was here to gain experience, not to continue working in paradise Corporation. What was the point of being a small leader? Not to mention, after becoming the head of the project team, he wouldn’t be able to touch on specific projects every day like now. The work of management and coordination would consume a lot of his experience, and this wouldn’t help him gain experience!

Hence, from the moment he entered Xia ruofei’s office, Chen Xuan had been worried that Xia ruofei would promote him.
