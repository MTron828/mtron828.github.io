2957 A gathering of heroes (2)

Li Yifu was obviously more proficient than Qingfeng Luo in the life skills of modern society. If Luo Qingfeng were to call the hotel front desk to arrange for the delivery of the meal, he might not be able to figure it out.

The junjue hotel itself was an asset of the fallen leaves sect, so during the auction, everyone naturally did their best to ensure that everything was fine. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Therefore, not long after Li Yifu made the call, the waiter pushed a small dining cart and delivered their lunch to the room.

Li Yifu went over and gave the waiter a 100 – dollar bill as a bill. Then, he personally pushed the dining cart into the room and told the waiter to go back first. They would call again when they needed to pack up.

The waiter was also very surprised when he received the bill. Most of the people who came to the auction were immersed in cultivation in the sect and didn’t care about the world. How would they know the rules of giving tips? What’s more, Li Yifu actually gave them a large amount of US dollars, which was even more surprising. Usually, the normal guests who stayed in the hotel would not spend so much!

The waiter quickly bowed and thanked him, then carefully closed the door for Li Yifu and left the floor happily.

Xia ruofei and the other two were eating lunch and chatting in the room. Xia ruofei told Qingfeng Luo and Yifu li about the news he had heard from Liu chengfeng. Even though both of them could be trusted, Xia ruofei did not specifically mention the source of the news.

Of course, since Xia ruofei did not say anything, Luo Qingfeng and Li Yifu would not ask.

After Li Yifu heard Xia ruofei’s words, he said with a serious expression,””Martial granduncle, from the looks of it, the competition for storage rings is still very intense! I should be able to earn a lot of spirit stones from the three items, but I’m worried that it might not be enough ...”

“Master,” Qingfeng Luo said,”according to my judgment, the total price of our three items should be around 30000 spirit stones. It might fluctuate a little.” The owners of these storage rings have set their base price at thirty thousand spirit stones, so I’m afraid the final price will be much higher. After all, storage rings have rarely been auctioned in recent years. ”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Don’t worry too much. I’m already prepared.”

“Oh? Master has also prepared other treasures that will be immediately auctioned off if there are not enough spirit stones?” “What happened?” Luo Qingfeng asked quickly.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”No.” But I have other preparations! You’ll know when you get to the auction. Of course, I hope that my preparations won’t be needed. ”

Xia ruofei wanted to keep them in suspense. Although Luo Qingfeng and Li Yifu were very curious, they did not dare to ask.

After lunch, Li Yifu called the hotel’s front desk to arrange for people to take away the plates and dining cars.

Then, Xia ruofei did not return to his room. Instead, the three of them sat beside Luo Qingfeng and chatted. He also gave Li Yifu some pointers on his cultivation.

Li Yifu’s complete cultivation technique was obtained from the Jade talisman of inheritance. He even examined Li Yifu for a while before giving him the copied cultivation technique.

Therefore, Xia ruofei had a deep understanding of this technique. Not only did the Jade talisman of inheritance contain the original text of the technique, but it also contained some cultivation experiences and annotations of the predecessors. These were all very precious insights that could not be bought with spiritual stones.

Because of this, Xia ruofei was more relaxed when he guided Li Yifu in his cultivation. He could always hit the nail on the head and easily solve some of Li Yifu’s doubts in his cultivation.

Xia ruofei’s explanation was very simple, but his simple words contained a hidden meaning that pointed directly to the essence.

Even Luo Qingfeng felt that he had gained something after listening to it.

Luo Qingfeng was amazed. He realized that even without the soul seal, Xia ruofei’s current strength seemed to have surpassed his in all aspects. Hence, he had a deep respect for Xia ruofei.

The one who benefited the most was naturally Li Yifu. He had been given special treatment by a golden core cultivator for the entire day. Even the core disciples of the sect could not enjoy such treatment.

Even if it was a disciple who was doted on by the higher – ups, it was impossible for an Aurous core stage cultivator to give him one – on – one tutoring all day long.

After all, Aurous core stage cultivators were very busy. Their cultivation growth was slower and they needed more time to cultivate. What’s more, those who had reached the Golden core stage were all high – Level figures in the major sects. They usually had a lot of daily affairs to handle, so how could they have the time to patiently guide the cultivation of their disciples?

While Li Yifu was excited, he was also full of gratitude and respect for Xia ruofei.

The path of cultivation was broad and profound. One of the three was responsible for explaining, while the other listened attentively. Luo Qingfeng also listened carefully and verified his own cultivation experience. As a result, time naturally passed very quickly. Without them knowing, night had slowly descended.

Cultivators didn’t pay much attention to the desire for food. Moreover, they were in a noisy city. Naturally, they couldn’t prepare rare ingredients that were rare in the secular world like in the sect. Therefore, the fallen leaves sect did not even arrange a special welcome banquet. Everyone was also used to it and did not feel that it was inappropriate.

Cultivators who liked to have fun could invite their friends to a restaurant for a buffet.

If they wanted to have a quiet place, they could order a meal in their room. The hotel provided a 24 – hour order service, and all the staff members had three shifts to rest.

Of course, there were even more people who didn’t eat at all. They just meditated in their rooms and waited for the auction to start.

Xia ruofei and the other two still ordered dinner in the room.

After dinner, it was almost Seveno’ clock in the evening. Luo Qingfeng got up and said,””Master, it’s about time. We can go to the auction hall. This old servant still needs to hand over the item to the fallen leaves sect. ”

Xia ruofei smiled, stood up and said,””Then let’s go!”

The three of them left the room and walked towards the elevator.

Xia ruofei was rather excited. This was the first time he had faced so many cultivators since he had obtained the spirit map scroll and embarked on the path of cultivation.

This was almost the main force of the Chinese cultivation world. Although there were some powerful individual cultivators who did not participate in this auction, all the powerful sects in the Chinese cultivation world had sent representatives to participate. It was not an exaggeration to say that it was a gathering of heroes.

Xia ruofei seemed to be a little nervous, but he was more excited than nervous!

The three of them took the elevator and headed straight to the grand banquet hall on the third floor. The Qin Zhuan auction would be held in that grand banquet hall.

The elevator went down and stopped on the 10th floor. When the elevator door opened, Xia ruofei saw three extremely beautiful women standing outside. They were dressed in Palace clothes and looked elegant and ancient.
