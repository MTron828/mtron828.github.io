Chapter 1779: A hundred turns and a thousand turns (2)

“His sincerity is definitely real, there’s nothing going on between us ...”

Even though Song Wei didn’t understand the story of the scene, the lyrics were very fitting, as if it was a portrayal of her mood at the moment.

As Song Wei listened, she couldn’t help but feel a little dazed ...

Liuhai Lane courtyard house. When Xia ruofei returned home, the sky had already darkened. Xia ruofei guessed that Wu Qiang and the rest would be back soon.

However, it was hard to say. It was the evening peak hour in the capital. If Wu Qiang followed his instructions and brought them out for a walk after picking them up, then came back for a meal, even if the schedule was tight, they would probably be stuck in traffic at this time.

Xia ruofei did not expect the traffic control at the airport.

In fact, Wu Qiang had been waiting at the airport for a few hours. He had just received the announcement of the landing of the flight.

The entire flight was only two hours long, but due to the air flow control at Beijing airport, the pre – Flight from Beijing was delayed by a lot. Due to the chain reaction, and the need to line up in circles when they landed in Beijing, the flight was delayed for a whole three hours.

On the other hand, Wu Qiang had arrived at the airport an hour before the landing time. In other words, he had waited for four hours.

After the announcement was made that the plane had landed, Wu Qiang stood at the exit of the domestic flight and kept looking inside. He was a little excited, but at the same time, a little nervous.

After about ten minutes, Wu Qiang saw a group of people coming down from the escalator through the glass wall. He knew that they were probably the passengers of his sister-in-law’s flight.

Sure enough, Wu Qiang quickly found his sister – in – Law, Wu Xiujuan, and his blind date, Xia Xiaolan, in the crowd. Both of them were dressed in a rustic style, and they were carrying a woven bag of luggage. They were so conspicuous in the well – dressed crowd, where almost everyone had a suitcase.

Wu Qiang kept waving excitedly, but Wu Xiujuan and Xia Xiaolan looked a little confused. They held the woven bag tightly and followed the crowd nervously. They did not notice Wu Qiang among the people who were picking them up.

It was only when the two of them walked out of the restricted area that Wu Qiang, who was waving and shouting, attracted their attention.

After seeing Wu Qiang in the crowd, the tension on Wu Xiujuan and Xia Xiaolan’s faces eased a lot. Wu Xiujuan shouted happily,””Qiangzi!”

Xia Xiaolan’s face turned slightly red. She walked up to Wu Qiang and said awkwardly,””Brother Qiang ...”

Although the two of them were from neighboring villages and knew each other in the past, they were not familiar with each other before. Some time ago, through a matchmaker, the two of them had chatted on WeChat for a while and even video – called a few times.

Strictly speaking, this was the first time the two of them had actually met since the blind date.

After observing her secretly, Wu Qiang realized that Xia Xiaolan was even more beautiful than she had seen in the WeChat video. Although she looked a little uncouth compared to those city girls who knew how to dress up, her natural beauty without any makeup still had a unique style.

If she were to dress up a little and put on a set of fashionable clothes, Xia Xiaolan’s looks would score at least 85 points.

Wu Qiang was also a little embarrassed. He was not an extrovert to begin with. Although he was in his early thirties, he was still a Virgin when it came to love. Therefore, he only smiled and nodded, then took their luggage.

Wu Xiujuan couldn’t help but laugh when she saw the two of them.””Qiang Zi, you’re a man, why are you being so shy? You know Xiao LAN!”

“Let’s go, sister – in – Law, Xiao LAN!”Wu Qiang chuckled. The car is outside ...”

“Qiangzi, you even drove the car?” Wu Xiujuan asked,”it seems that our qiangzi is doing well in Beijing!”

Wu Xiujuan looked at Xia Xiaolan as she spoke.

Xia Xiaolan’s big eyes were also looking at Wu Qiang with anticipation.

“Sis – in – Law, it’s the boss” car!”Wu Qiang quickly said. He told me to drive here to pick you up!”

In the eyes of Wu Xiujuan and Xia Xiaolan, there was no concept of luxury cars and ordinary family cars. It was already impressive to have a car.

With Wu Qiang’s income, there was no problem with a mortgage to buy a car. It was just that there was no need to do so.

Wu Qiang wasn’t someone who liked to show off, so he didn’t explain much. Instead, he asked,”Sister – in – Law, Xiao LAN, did your journey go smoothly?”

Speaking of this trip, Wu Xiujuan’s interest was piqued. She said excitedly,””Qiangzi, thanks to you, we also got to take a big plane this time! Good fellow! He’s flying really high! At first, I could still see the car on the ground turning into a Matchbox, but then it simply flew up into the clouds. Its two big wings were trembling, and my palms were sweating all the way, afraid that this iron lump would fall down ...”

When Wu Qiang heard this, he found it a little funny. However, he came from the countryside and understood the novelty of his sister-in-law’s first flight. Hence, he only said,”Sister – in – Law, planes are the safest means of transportation in the world. The probability of accidents is very low!”

“Sis – in – Law Xiujuan, brother qiangzi is right,” Xia Xiaolan said.”I remember when I was in high school, my teacher said that the probability of an accident on a plane is lower than winning the lottery!”

“I don’t understand the probability you’re talking about,” Wu Xiujuan said.”I’m just worried about flying in the sky!” Also, qiangzi, Beijing’s airport is too big! When we got off the plane, we were all stunned. There was a big brother sitting next to us who brought us out ...”

“Then I really have to thank that big brother!” Wu Qiang said with a smile.

As the three of them spoke, they had already passed through the parking lot and arrived next to the Land Rover.

Wu Qiang took the remote control and unlocked the door. Then, he opened the trunk and put their luggage in.

Wu Xiujuan walked around the Land Rover, looking very curious. After Wu Qiang asked them to get in, Wu Xiujuan carefully touched the genuine leather seat and asked,””Qiangzi, this car isn’t cheap, right?”

While starting the car, Wu Qiang nodded and said,”I think it’s more than three million!”

“How much?” Wu Xiujuan was so scared that she almost jumped up.”Qiangzi, how much did you say?”

“Over three million!” Wu Qiang said,”sister – in – Law, cars of this brand are basically all priced at this price!”

Wu Xiujuan took a deep breath and said,””Be good! This car cost more than three million Yuan? Could it be made of gold? I saw boss Qi from the beverage factory in town driving a Buick off – Road. I heard it’s only three hundred thousand Yuan! This car is worth ten Buicks?” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Wu Qiang smiled and said,”sister – in – Law, different brands have different prices. However, no matter how expensive this car is, it doesn’t matter to me. This is the boss’s car. I’m just an employee!”

Wu Xiujuan carefully touched the car window, then immediately retracted her hand and said,””Your boss is really good to you! You’re going to let you drive such an expensive car? But qiangzi, you have to be careful, if you really rub it, we can’t afford to pay for it!”

Wu Qiang was speechless, but he still said,””I know, sis – in – Law ...”

“Qiangzi,” Wu Xiujuan asked,”what’s your boss’s attitude toward work?”

Xia Xiaolan, who was standing at the side, could not help but prick up her ears. She really needed this salary. Moreover, she had a good impression of Wu Qiang. If the two of them worked together, they could deepen their understanding and cultivate feelings. It could be said to be the best of both worlds.

Wu Qiang said,”there shouldn’t be any problems. Director Xia still trusts me more. He will meet you all in a while. If there are no problems, this matter can be settled today.”

When Wu Xiujuan heard that her boss wanted to see them, she couldn’t help but feel a little nervous.

Wu Qiang saw this scene through the rearview mirror of the car. He smiled and said,”Sister – in – Law, President Xia is a very nice person. He doesn’t put on airs at all, so you don’t have to be nervous! Also, we’re not going back right away. President Xia said that he’ll take you around after picking you up, buy some clothes, and then have a meal ...”
