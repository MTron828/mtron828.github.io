“That’s too costly ... Actually, we can just take a civilian flight ...” Wang Chi muttered.

The PhD student behind him, Feng Xiaoyi, had a new look in his eyes as he looked up at the beautiful Gulfstream G650.

Wang Chi’s status was quite distinguished. He was an academician. According to his rank, he could enjoy high – speed rail business class, train soft sleeper, or plane first – Class. It was not that he had never seen the world, but it was his first time taking a private plane.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”this is the company’s plane. It’s not expensive. As long as it can improve travel efficiency, it doesn’t matter. Academician Wang, please!” Let’s talk on the plane!”

“Alright! Alright!” Wang Chi said.

Xia ruofei made an inviting gesture and let Wang Chi walk in front of him. He was half a step behind Wang Chi and they walked towards the accommodation ladder of the public jet paradise.

A beautiful Chinese flight attendant stood by the accommodation ladder to welcome them with a charming smile on her face.

After stepping into the cabin, Wang Chi was even more dazzled by the luxurious decorations.

Wang Chi was still in a relatively good state, at least he maintained a certain degree of calmness.

And his student, Dr. Feng Xiaoyi, was like a grandmother Liu entering the Grand View Garden.

Feng Xiaoyi was originally a scientific research worker under Wang Chi. Working for a Big Boss like Wang Chi, his life was quite comfortable. The project funds were also more abundant. When the project progressed smoothly, the boss would give them bonuses or something. Compared to the average PhD student, he was definitely not suffering.

However, even when he went to academic conferences with his supervisor, he had to squeeze into Economy Class or second – Class seats on the high – speed rail. He had never enjoyed such a luxurious private plane before.

After Feng Xiaoyi got on the plane, he didn’t even know where to put his hands. Under the dreamy atmosphere lights of the plane, the handmade leather seats, the smooth walnut strips, the soft Italy wool carpet, and other facilities all looked even more high – end. He was afraid that he would accidentally knock them, as he really couldn’t afford to pay for it!

After Xia ruofei guided Wang Chi to his seat, he also noticed Feng Xiaoyi’s awkward situation. He smiled and said,””Dr. Feng, please put away your luggage first!”

Feng Xiaoyi seemed to wake up from a dream and quickly said,”Oh, oh! Alright! Alright!”

Xia ruofei guided Feng Xiaoyi to put their luggage into the luggage compartment and arranged a seat near the front cabin for Feng Xiaoyi.

Mu Sheng and the rest had also boarded the plane. Wang Chi and Feng Xiaoyi then realized that none of them had any luggage with them. They were basically all on empty – handed planes. Only Xia ruofei and the two beautiful girls beside him had a small bag with them.

Xia ruofei quickly arranged everyone’s seats.

The four airline seats in the middle of the cabin were reserved for him, Song Wei, Ling Qingxue, and Wang Chi.

Mu Sheng and the others weren’t interested in dealing with academicians from the secular world. They were people from two different worlds. If it wasn’t for this incident, they wouldn’t even have had any contact with each other.

So, they all sat in the front seats with great interest, looking at the most advanced business plane that mankind had.

Chen Xuan sat on the sofa diagonally opposite Xia ruofei and the others. There was also a seat belt installed here, and it would be convenient for him to communicate with Wang Chi when needed.

Xia ruofei sat down beside Wang Chi, and opposite them were the beautiful sisters, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue.

After all the passengers had boarded the plane, the flight attendant checked and confirmed with Xia ruofei before closing and locking the cabin door. He then went to the cockpit to report to the captain.

Very soon, the flight crew received permission from the control tower. They had already applied for the flight route in advance and reported to be ready on time, so everything went smoothly.

Basically, not long after everyone sat down, the plane was pushed out. When the nose of the plane faced North, the cart began to slowly glide.

Wang Chi subconsciously raised his hand to look at his watch. It was 9:55.

It had only been about 20 minutes since he had gotten off the plane at the business terminal and the plane had begun to taxi – in. This included the security checks of more than ten people, as well as the time bu Fang had walked through a certain passageway before boarding the plane.

At 10 O’ clock sharp, the public jet paradise, which was waiting at the runway entrance, was allowed to enter the runway and take off after an Airbus A320 landed and left the runway.

Captain Liu An controlled the plane to make a turn at the end of the runway. After aiming at the runway, they, who had already done a pre – take – off inspection, directly pushed the accelerator to the take – off thrust.

The sound of the engine of the peach origin suddenly became much louder, and its speed suddenly increased. It began to glide on the runway at high speed.

This runway could accommodate the take – off and landing of heavy aircraft such as the Boeing 787 dream plane, so paradise was naturally more than enough.

When he glided at high speed to about half the length of the track, he had already reached the wheel – lifting speed of VR.

Captain Liu An gently pulled the control stick back, and the plane suddenly leaped up lightly and rushed into the clear blue sky.

As the plane continued to climb, Wang Chi looked out of the porthole at the rapidly shrinking ground buildings. He couldn’t help but feel that Qianqian had indeed saved a lot of time by taking the business jet. At least she could save a few hours of waiting at the airport, and she also had a lot more freedom.

However, the cost was naturally much higher. If time was money, then the time saved was not cheap.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com
