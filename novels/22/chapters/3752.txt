Naturally, Xia ruofei was not completely unguarded. In fact, he had been on high alert the whole time. As soon as the yellow light appeared, he immediately made his move.

The blue immortal sword under Xia ruofeis feet changed direction nimbly and flew upwards again. Even though the yellow light was extremely fast, it only passed under Xia ruofeis feet and did not hurt him at all.

However, the yellow light did not hit its target. It made a turn in the air and continued to chase after Xia ruofei.

Of course, Xia ruofei wouldnt just Dodge. In fact, when he controlled the blue immortal sword to Dodge, he had already taken out the flying sword of qushuang.

He didnt even turn his head. The qushuang flying sword flew behind him and met the yellow light.

In the blink of an eye, the qushuang flying sword met the yellow light.

Ding! Ding! With a clanging of metal, the qushuang sword was knocked back several feet while the yellow light slowed.

At this moment, Xia ruofei had already changed his direction. He could finally see the true face of the yellow light.

To Xia ruofeis surprise, it was not an attack Type magical weapon. Instead, it was a small snake that was emitting a faint yellow light.

The light yellow snakes eyes were cold. It flicked its tongue slightly and looked at Xia ruofei in the air. There was no emotion in its eyes. It was as if it was looking at a dead man.

The qushuang flying sword had come into contact with the pale yellow snake before, so Xia ruofei could roughly determine the snakes cultivation.

He was at least a late Stage golden core cultivator!

In addition, this little snakes physical defense was extremely strong. The flying sword was quite sharp, but this little yellow snake had actually managed to withstand the attack without leaving any marks on its body.

This was a little scary.

Strong physical defense, unparalleled speed, and such a high cultivation Xia ruofei did not have many tricks up his sleeve when facing such an opponent.

However, Xia ruofei did not panic. Instead, he became even calmer.

After the light yellow snake was slowed down by qu Shuangs flying sword, it only hovered in the air for a few seconds. It looked at Xia ruofei coldly and then turned into a sharp light again, pouncing towards Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofeis mind moved slightly. The blue travel immortal sword under his feet followed the path of the casual steps. His body swayed slightly and he easily dodged it.

This time, the snake grazed past Xia ruofeis waist. Even though he was wearing a spacesuit and had a Yuan Qi protective layer, he could still feel the heat. It made him hold his breath.

Obviously, the little pale yellow snake was able to survive in the lava pool. It must have adapted to the environment here. It seemed that not only was its body resistant to heat, but it was also emitting a hot aura. This made Xia ruofei even more alert.

As expected, after the light yellow snake missed its target, it stopped in midair. Before it could turn around, it turned its head and opened its mouth at Xia ruofei.

With a whoosh, an extremely hot flame shot out from its mouth.

The flame was small at first, but when it came into contact with the hot air above the lava pool, it instantly grew bigger. In the end, it was like a sea of fire, sweeping towards Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofeis pupils shrank slightly. Without hesitation, he took out the spirit map scroll and entered the spirit map space with a thought. He controlled the blue immortal sword through the space and made it carry the spirit map scroll to escape to the periphery of the magma Lake.bender

Xia ruofeis judgment was very accurate. Even though the blue immortal sword was extremely fast, the sea of fire was even faster. In just one or two seconds, the blue immortal sword and the spirit map scroll were surrounded by the sea of fire.

Fortunately, the blue travel immortal sword was a Supreme grade flying sword that had been tempered thousands of times, and there were many rare minerals in its material, so it would not be melted by the sea of fire in a short time.

As for the spirit painting, it did not disappoint Xia ruofei. Even though it was in the sea of fire, it was not damaged at all.

He didnt know what kind of material the spirit painting scroll was made of.

The blue travel immortal sword carried the spirit map scroll and rushed out of the sea of fire at an extremely fast speed, returning to the shore of the lava lake.

After the flame swept past the range of the magma Lake, it quickly weakened and seemed to be a little weak. Soon, the blue traveling immortal sword returned to a relatively safe place with the spirit map scroll.

Seeing that Xia ruofei had retreated to the shore, the pale yellow snake did not chase after him. Instead, it turned its head to look at Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei could see a trace of mockery and disdain in its eyes.

A late Stage golden core demonic beast was naturally sentient, just like the spiritual turtle. It could communicate with its spiritual power and was no different from a normal cultivator. However, Xia ruofei was still embarrassed to be looked down upon by a small snake.

Naturally, Xia ruofei was not completely unguarded. In fact, he had been on high alert the whole time. As soon as the yellow light appeared, he immediately made his move.

The blue immortal sword under Xia ruofeis feet changed direction nimbly and flew upwards again. Even though the yellow light was extremely fast, it only passed under Xia ruofeis feet and did not hurt him at all.

However, the yellow light did not hit its target. It made a turn in the air and continued to chase after Xia ruofei.

Of course, Xia ruofei wouldnt just Dodge. In fact, when he controlled the blue immortal sword to Dodge, he had already taken out the flying sword of qushuang..
