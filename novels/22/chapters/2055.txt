2056 “Pretty boy”_2

Xia Tian’s performance in Turin had won over many brothers of the Hong sect, including lui hai. His strength that was beyond the limit of human beings made him a God in everyone’s eyes.

How could a woman of God be blasphemed?

Therefore, as soon as the call was connected, lui hai couldn’t wait to say,””Uncle Yi, there’s an urgent situation here that I need to report to you!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“What’s wrong?”Li Yifu asked seriously. Is there any movement from the glory society?”

Ever since the Hong sect’s branch in Turin destroyed the German family’s base, the Hong sect had not dared to relax at all. They had been preparing for an all – out conflict with the glory society.

Therefore, when Li Yifu heard lui Hai’s anxious voice, he thought of the glory society.

“No, no! Uncle, it has nothing to do with the glory society. Those guys didn’t make any obvious moves, so they must have admitted defeat ...”Lui hai said quickly,” but ... This may be related to Mr. Xia.”

“What?” Li Yifu suddenly raised his voice.”Then why don’t you tell me quickly?”

Even though he had guessed that glory was going to make a big move, Li Yifu had always maintained a calm attitude. After all, some worldly conflicts could hardly cause any waves in Li Yifu’s heart. However, once Xia ruofei was involved, Li Yifu would immediately become very nervous.

“It’s like this, didn’t Mr. Xia save a woman from the Grasso family in Turin? The one called Monica. Before he left, he even specifically instructed us to send two of our brothers to the Grasso family to boost Monica’s reputation and deter the people in their family who are ready to make trouble. ” Lui hai said,”we all think that Mr. Xia might have some feelings for Monica ...”

“Get to the point,” Li Yifu said with a frown.”When did you become a gossiper like a woman?”

Regardless of whether Xia ruofei was interested in Monica or not, Li Yifu would not be able to guess it. Xia ruofei was his senior granduncle! Could it be that Li Yifu still dared to guess all day long whether he was going to give him a Grandmaster? Regarding Xia ruofei’s private life, even if Li Yifu had more guts, he would not dare to make wild guesses!

Lui hai smiled awkwardly,””Uncle Yi, I can’t avoid gossip when I report this to you today. Ah Hua just called me and told me that Monica picked up a young man from the airport today. The two of them are very close, and Monica directly took the young man to her room. He hasn’t come out yet ...”

“What?” Li Yifu immediately frowned.”There’s such a thing?”

He did not dare to speculate about Xia ruofei’s private life, but it did not mean that he could just watch his senior granduncle be cuckolded! If the Grand uncle – Master was cuckolded, then he, as his grandnephew, would also lose face!

“Hua wouldn’t lie.” Lui hai said,”he has done some preliminary investigation. That young man is also from Huaxia. Coincidentally, his family name is also Xia ... Uncle Yi, what do you think we should do?” That Monica has publicly betrayed Mr. Xia. Shouldn’t we teach the Grasso family a lesson? Also, that pretty boy who seduced Monica, in my opinion ... We should just grab him and throw him into the river!”

“Wait ...” Li Yifu frowned slightly and asked,”you just said that the young man’s surname is also Xia?”

“Yup!” Lui hai said casually,”but he can’t be compared with Mr. Xia at all. He’s loose all over, and looks like a pretty boy who has drunk too much ...”

“What does he look like?” Li Yifu asked urgently.

Ah Hua had described the man that Monica brought back to lui hai. Therefore, even though lui hai had never met Xia ruofei, he could copy Ah Hua’s description and tell Li Yifu.

Li Yifu suddenly asked,””You guys must have found out the name of that young man, right? Is he called Xia ... Ruofei?”

Lui hai opened his eyes wide in surprise,””Uncle Yi, you’re really a living God! Could it be that you can read fortunes? That pretty boy was called Xia ruofei. Uncle, what should we do? please give us some instructions! The thought of that pretty boy in Monica’s room makes me feel uncomfortable!”

On the other end of the phone, Li Yifu raised his eyebrows and said coldly,””Ah hai, if you dare to say ‘pretty boy’ again, do you believe that I’ll fly to Milan immediately and skin you?”

Lui hai quivered in fear, saying dazedly,””Uncle Yi, did I ... Did I say something wrong? Just point it out directly, don’t be angry and harm your body ...”

Li Yifu said unhappily,”angry with you, you little rascal?” Can I get over it? Cut the crap! Just pretend that today’s incident didn’t happen ...”

“Ah?”

“What do you mean” ah “?” Li Yifu said,”that’s not right. Immediately call the two boys in charge of the Grasso family and ask them to be more respectful to Xia ... Mr. Ruofei! Don’t show the slightest neglect!”

“This ... This ...” Lui hai was dumbfounded,”uncle Yi, this Xiao Bai ... He has stolen Mr. Xia’s woman!”

Lui hai almost said “pretty boy” out of habit, but he stopped himself in time at the last moment.
