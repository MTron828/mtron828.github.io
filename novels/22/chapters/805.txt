Chapter 806: Ocean Strategy (1)

Translator: 549690339

Whenever he thought of the sea, Xia ruofei would naturally think of all kinds of precious ingredients.

Chinese bahaba fish, Almas caviar, Australian lobster, top – grade Veron oysters, Palamos big red shrimp, top – grade one – headed abalone, France Butania blue lobster ...

These were all gifts given to humans by nature.

Now, Xia ruofei had an ocean that belonged to him, and the natural environment was unique. If all these top – grade marine ingredients from all over the world could be collected and cultivated in this space ocean, it would be exciting just thinking about it!

Naturally, it was not easy to collect these top quality ingredients.

First of all, the production of these expensive top – grade ingredients was very small, and they only had a fixed origin. For example, the top – tier Veron oysters were produced in the mouth of the France Veron River, where salty and fresh water were exchanged. Due to the narrow estuary of Veron, which was only about 20 kilometers long, and the government’s strict supervision of the quality and hygiene of Veron oysters, the production rate was very low. There was also the Butania blue lobster, which was basically not exported. If you wanted to get the most authentic ingredients, you had to go to the local area and try your luck.

In addition, these ingredients had extremely strict requirements for their growing environment. Whether or not they could survive in the space ocean was also a problem. Of course, Xia ruofei was not too worried about this. He had already experienced the magic of the spirit map space. He believed that no matter what kind of marine creature it was, it would not be unaccustomed to the environment here.

However, the area of the space ocean was still very small. Another hundred meters and it would be the space membrane. As long as it was a creature from the outside world, including Xia ruofei himself, it would not be able to pass through the space membrane. If they were to breed species from different places in such a small area, there might be conflicts.

Hence, after some consideration, Xia ruofei felt that he had to expand the space as soon as possible. On the other hand, he could not be too greedy at this stage. He could choose one or two top – grade ingredients from the ocean and breed them in the space ocean to test the waters.

After making up his mind, Xia ruofei drove the all – terrain vehicle back to the foot of the mountain. He did not disturb Xia Qing’s work and left the realm directly from the mountain sea realm.

After returning to the outside world, Xia ruofei first turned on his computer and went online to order a batch of small flower pots.

It was not Xia ruofei’s first time buying flower pots from this store. He found the link to the previous orders and ordered 1000 of them in one go.

Xia ruofei changed the delivery address to the small warehouse he rented in the city.

For such a large number of orders, the merchants all went through logistics instead of express delivery. The goods of logistics companies were generally picked up by the customers. If they needed to deliver the goods to the door, they would have to charge a certain delivery fee and agree on the time to receive the goods, so it was very convenient to use a small warehouse to receive the goods.

After ordering the flower pot, Xia ruofei went online to search for information on precious seafood.

After weighing the pros and cons, Xia ruofei decided to cultivate abalones in the space ocean to test the waters.

For one, Xia ruofei was a man of the three mountains. The southeast coast was also the production area of abalones, so he had a better understanding of abalones.

Secondly, there were many people who cultivated abalones in the southeast province. There were many farms that specialized in cultivating abalone fry. Xia ruofei did not have to travel thousands of miles to the production area to buy high – Quality abalone fry there.

Abalones were one of the precious “sea treasures.” They were delicious and nutritious, and were known as the “soft gold” of the ocean. They also had the reputation of “table gold, the crown of sea treasures.”

There was a common saying among the people that “a thousand gold can not buy two – headed abalone.”

The “head” here was usually calculated by the weight of the dried abalones.”How many heads” meant how many abalones of equal size were contained in one catty. For the commonly known nine – headed abalones, nine abalones added up to one catty. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The smaller the number of abalones, the bigger the abalones were, and the more expensive they were.

According to the traditional calculation, the “one Jin” here referred to one Sima Jin, which was 604.79 grams, which was heavier than the usual 500 grams per city Jin.

In other words, the weight of the dried two – headed abalone was about 300 grams on average, which was quite rare.

Hong Kong people were particularly fond of eating abalones. If there was a two – headed abalone of excellent quality, it would definitely cause the rich to rush to buy it. Many people who bought two – headed abalones would not be willing to eat it, but would collect it instead.

A few years ago, there was a famous Hong Kong TV series,”executors ‘Tempest,” which could be said to have set a record for the ratings. The “executors” in the series actually referred to the executors’ abalone.

Many people were familiar with some of the plots in the series, and the most eye – catching one was undoubtedly the ‘two – headed abalone’ that was passed down in the abalone King’s family, as well as the infighting between the rich and powerful families.

One could see how precious two – headed abalones were.

And if it could reach the weight of the legendary one – Head abalone, which was a dried abalone, it would be a miracle.

Two years ago, a one – headed abalone with a net weight of 620 grams appeared in yuenan province. It was sold at 2.5 million Yuan, which was almost four million Yuan per kilogram.

This was only the price of one abalone! Hence, if the breeding of abalones reached its peak, the profit could definitely reach hundreds of millions. Such a profit margin was enough to move Xia ruofei.

San Shan was not far from Hong Kong. Hence, Xia ruofei chose to breed abalone in the space ocean for the first time. He was also aiming for the Hong Kong market.

After making up his mind, Xia ruofei turned off his computer, took a shower in the bathroom, and went to sleep.

Although the matter of breeding abalones had been settled, Xia ruofei still had to wait until he was done with some other matters before he could start implementing it.

The next morning, Xia ruofei got up and washed up. He did not rush downstairs. Instead, he took out the painting and entered the medium.

From last night until now, more than ten days had passed in the spirit map space.

Xia Qing was already waiting in the mountain sea realm. The moment she saw Xia ruofei, she immediately went up and greeted him respectfully.

Xia ruofei saw that Xia Qing was taking care of the herb garden in the mountain sea realm, and he asked with a smile,””The seeds and iron – Skin Dendrobium are done?”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing replied respectfully,”I’ve already transported the seeds and the harvested iron – Skin Dendrobium to the mountain sea realm.”

“Let’s go and take a look!”

Xia Qing brought Xia ruofei to a corner of the herb garden.

“Master, all the vegetable seeds have been fully soaked and dried. I have packed them according to their original categories.” Xia Qing pointed at the bags of seeds that were neatly stacked together.

“Mm! “You’ve worked hard ...”Xia ruofei nodded.

His eyes fell on the sealed bags next to the seeds, and he asked with a smile,””Are these the iron – Skin Dendrobium?”

“Yes, master!”

Xia ruofei walked over and picked a bag randomly. He opened it and saw that it was filled with fresh strips of iron – skinned Dendrobium.

The fresh strips of the Dendrobium candids were neatly cut into small sections of five to seven centimeters, and they were tied together with plastic ropes in an orderly manner.

Xia ruofei nodded in satisfaction and asked,””How many fresh fish strips did you get this time?”

Xia ruofei had placed a scale in the spirit map space. He had already taught Xia Qing how to use such a simple scale.

“Master, it’s about 2450 pounds in total,” Xia Qing immediately replied.

Xia ruofei nodded his head in satisfaction. This output was slightly higher than the previous time, but it was limited. After all, the area in the Archean realm was only so big, and the scale of planting iron – Skin Dendrobium was not large.

“Well done!” Xia ruofei patted Xia Qing’s shoulder and said.

“Thank you for the compliment, master!”

Xia ruofei looked at the thriving Chinese herbs in the herb garden and said to Xia Qing,””Xia Qing, during this period of time, you should set up a medicine garden and focus on planting the medicinal herbs in the heart – nourishing soup formula. You can make it a little bigger. I have opened a pharmaceutical factory in the outside world to specialize in the production of heart – nourishing soup, and the demand for medicinal herbs is a little high.”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing immediately responded.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””By the way, you should also plant more of the herbs in the formula of the jaded skin cream. This will also be mass – produced in the future.”

“Alright,” he said.

“By the way, do you have the seeds of these herbs? Tell me if you need anything, so I can go to the seed company to buy it. ” Xia ruofei said.

Xia Qing had already memorized the formulas of the Jade skin cream and heart – nourishing soup, so he said without hesitation,””Master, we have the seeds of the medicinal herbs required for the two formulas. There’s no need to buy them separately.”

“Alright, hurry up and do it these few days!” Xia ruofei said,”now that the herbs in the formula have been planted, it’s best to move them together and plant them in a centralized manner so that it’s easier to manage.”

“Understood!” Xia Qing said. He then looked at Xia ruofei and said,”master, I have a suggestion ...”

“Oh? Tell me about it!”

Xia Qing said,”although we’ve opened up a medicine garden, there’s still a lot of land in the mountain and sea realm that’s left unused. Furthermore, every time the spatial zone is upgraded, the land in the mountain and sea realm will increase by a lot. If we don’t make use of it, it’ll be a waste.”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I was just about to tell you!” When you’re free, remember to transplant the tea trees from the Archean realm. In addition, continue to use the branches of the mother tree in the Archean realm to cut. When the tea trees have grown to a certain extent, transplant them over. I want to build a large Da Hong Pao tea garden in the mountain sea realm!”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing said,”actually, I want to say ... The iron – Skin Dendrobium can also be grown on a large scale in the mountain sea realm. Although the harvesting cycle is relatively short, the yield is still very low. In the mountain and sea realm, we can plant up to a hundred mu or even a few hundred mu. Even if we harvest them once or twice a year, the total yield will still be higher than in the Archean realm. ”

Xia ruofei’s eyes lit up and he said,”that’s a good idea!” It’s just that the workload is a little heavy, and I need to continuously plant it in the Archean realm. Only when it grows bigger can I transplant it. ”

The planting of the iron – Skin dendrobe normally took three to five years before it could be harvested. Of course, after it grew, it could be harvested every year. Hence, in order to save time, they had to complete the process at the primal realm, where time flowed 30 times faster.

“No problem! I can do it well!” Xia Qing said.

“Alright then! We’ll do as you say!” Xia ruofei said.

“Thank you for your trust, master!” Xia Qing was overjoyed.

He was like a robot with a built – in loyalty attribute. He would not be troubled by more and more work at all. Instead, he felt happy from the bottom of his heart because he could share his master’s worries.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”thank you for your hard work.” That’s right, you said yesterday that those succulent seedlings were all placed at the Archean realm. Bring me there to take a look!”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing said immediately.
