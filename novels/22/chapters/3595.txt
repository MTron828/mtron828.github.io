Chapter 3596: Refining the spiritual puppet (2)

Translator: 549690339

The fire array was set up.

Xia ruofei checked it again and compared it with the records in &lt;&lt;artifact refining Journal&gt;&gt;. After confirming that there were no mistakes, he took a few steps back and used his spiritual power to communicate with the core of the array and successfully activated it.

The pure energy in the spirit crystal flowed through the formation patterns, and soon, a flame appeared in the center of the formation.

This flame was pale white, as if it had no temperature at all.

However, Xia ruofei did not dare to let his guard down because this flame was exactly the same as what was described in &lt;&lt;artifact refining Journal&gt;&gt;. If it could really produce an extremely high temperature, it would not be an exaggeration to say that ordinary people would be vaporized immediately if they came into contact with it.

Xia ruofei used the invisible force of the spirit map space to retrieve a steel pipe and placed it on the flame.

Almost in an instant, the part of the steel pipe that came into contact with the flames disappeared. That‚Äôs right, it wasn‚Äôt burned red, nor was it liquefied. It had simply disappeared.

The steel pipe that was slightly further away from the flames also quickly turned red, softened, and drooped down.

Xia ruofei was dumbfounded.

The power of this flame was much stronger than he had imagined.

Of course, Xia ruofei also noticed it. He placed the steel pipe half a meter away from the flames and it was not affected at all.

This meant that the heat of the flame was very concentrated, and the range of effect was not large.

In fact, the flame could be controlled. Xia ruofei could control the intensity and range of the flames through the array.

He began to try to control the array to adjust the flame, and then constantly tested it on the steel pipe. He didn‚Äôt want to use his mental power to directly explore it, because under the extremely high temperature, his mental power would also be burned and devoured, which was very painful. Although steel pipes could not withstand high temperatures, they could still be used to test the conditions of flames.

Very soon, Xia ruofei would be able to control the fire array. He was relieved and went closer.

Xia ruofei directly used his mind to tell Xia Qing that he was busy with his own matters and didn‚Äôt need to come to see him.

Then, he appeared in the spirit map space at the primal realm.

Xia ruofei‚Äôs mind moved slightly, and a large amount of materials that had been processed into semi ‚Äì finished spiritual puppet materials gathered by his side.

Xia ruofei had collected these materials in the name of the Paradise Corporation. Of course, he had mixed in some other materials that he had no use for. There was a wide variety of these materials, and many of them were commonly used in the secular world. Therefore, even if the cultivators had accidentally noticed the purchasing behavior of the Paradise Corporation, they would never have been associated with the refining of the soul puppet.

In fact, the inheritance of the cultivation world had been severely cut off. There might not even be any cultivators who knew about the spiritual puppet, so Xia ruofei was not worried that the secret would be leaked.

Previously, Xia ruofei‚Äôs cultivation level was still low, so these materials had only been processed. n√äw stùíêries at nùíê/vel/b/i/n(.)coùíé

Now that he had managed to make the most difficult part of the Suan NI‚Äôs control core by chance, it was possible to refine a spiritual puppet. Therefore, he decided to continue to work on it in one go.

As he had to send song Qiming back to the three mountains the next morning, Xia ruofei chose to stay in the spirit map space. At the same time, he set up a time formation. This way, he could make use of the difference in the flow of time in the space and complete a lot of work.

Xia ruofei first sorted out the materials, then took out the formation materials and started the first step.

Strictly speaking, this step was not the process of refining a spiritual puppet. However, it was an essential step before refining a spiritual puppet. He needed to set up a formation first and use the formation to produce a flame that was far hotter than the ordinary flames in the secular world.

Without this formation, all the materials would not be able to be processed.

This was also the reason why Xia ruofei could only do some preliminary processing, such as removing impurities, crushing, grinding, and so on, before.

In fact, this array was not too difficult. Xia ruofei could barely make and set it up in the past. However, he was very clear about the difficulty of making the control core and thought that it would be impossible to make a complete spiritual puppet in a short period of time. Thus, he was not in a hurry to deal with the materials.

Now, things were different. He already had the control core. Although the rest of the work was cumbersome, he had a high chance of completing it with his current strength.

Even if Xia ruofei could not make another control core now, he could at least make one. He wanted to familiarize himself with the refining process and at the same time, see the difference between his elementary spiritual puppet and Xia Qing‚Äôs.

Xia ruofei took care of some of the materials for the formation. They were mainly jade stones and some relatively rare ores.

He cut the materials into the required shapes and placed them aside. Then, he picked up the rudiments of the talismans made of Jade and began to carve the runes.

The array pattern of this array formation was much easier to control than the array pattern of the core.

Even though it was his first time carving, Xia ruofei was still quite relaxed. He made the talismans one by one at a very fast speed. Xia ruofei did not feel any difficulty in the whole process. His success rate was maintained at 100% and he did not waste a single base.

After about an hour, Xia ruofei had prepared all the materials needed for the formation that was specially used to produce flames.

In fact, according to the &lt;&lt;weapon refining records&gt;&gt;, cultivators could also control flames. However, rare flames could only be encountered but not sought, and it was even more difficult to subdue them. Therefore, most of the weapon refining Masters mainly relied on arrays to produce and control the flames.

The array formed by the materials that Xia ruofei had just made was the fire array recorded in &quot;equipment refining Chronicles&quot;. It was one of the more advanced fire arrays. Even among the equipment refiners, it was a secret that was not passed down.

After Xia ruofei had prepared the materials, he found an empty space far away from the precious crops. At the same time, he put away the time array flag. Xia ruofei didn‚Äôt know how powerful the fire array he had made was. He was worried that it would burn the time array flag.

With his current strength, he couldn‚Äôt make time formation flags with such outstanding effects.

In fact, the laws of time and space were the highest and most obscure of all the laws, and it was quite difficult to comprehend them. Due to the spirit map space, Xia ruofei‚Äôs understanding of the rules of space was relatively profound. At least in the current cultivation world on earth, no one could understand the rules of space better than him. However, in terms of the rules of time, he might not even be able to reach the beginner level.

If the time array flag was really destroyed, he wouldn‚Äôt be able to make it at his current stage. He wouldn‚Äôt even be able to make the most basic array technique that could change the flow of time by several times.

After Xia ruofei kept the time formation flag, he started to set up the formation on the empty space.

The materials for the formation were placed in their respective positions and the talismans were embedded into the formation. In a short while, Xia ruofei had skillfully set up the formation.

Then, Xia ruofei waved his hand and threw out ten spiritual crystals. The spiritual crystals were accurately embedded into the pre ‚Äì reserved grooves in the array.

The fire array was set up.

Xia ruofei checked it again and compared it with the records in &lt;&lt jartifact refining Journal&gt;&gt;. After confirming that there were no mistakes, he took a few steps back and used his spiritual power to communicate with the core of the array and successfully activated it.

The pure energy in the spirit crystal flowed through the formation patterns, and soon, a flame appeared in the center of the formation.

This flame was pale white, as if it had no temperature at all.

However, Xia ruofei did not dare to let his guard down because this flame was exactly the same as what was described in &lt;&lt;artifact refining Journal&gt;&gt;. If it could really produce an extremely high temperature, it would not be an exaggeration to say that ordinary people would be vaporized immediately if they came into contact with it..
