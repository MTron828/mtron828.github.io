Chapter 1366: Finalizing the cooperation (2)

Translator: 549690339

Even in the middle of winter, everyone still insisted on taking a walk around the orchard. In fact, apart from the bare fruit trees, they could not see anything else.

However, from the hill, they could see the sea in the distance. The view was very good, but the biting cold wind was a bit of a wet blanket, so everyone quickly went down after a casual look.

“Ruofei, we really envy you!” Zhao Yongjun sat in the passenger seat next to Xia ruofei and exclaimed,”you’re living like a god!”

Song Rui also laughed and said,”that’s true!” Sometimes, I even want to stay at ruofei’s place for a while to cultivate!”

Xia ruofei turned his head and glanced at song Rui.””You’re willing to leave your Yiyi behind?”

Song Rui’s expression froze, and then he said,””After I’ve taken down Zhuo Yiyi, I can bring her along! I’m not asking for much, just food, accommodation, and transportation. Is that okay?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sure!” As long as you can settle Zhuo Yiyi, I’ll throw you a party at an Australian farm to celebrate!”

“You said it yourself!” Song Rui said.

Xu Zi Xuan laughed and said,”brother Rui, you have to work hard when you return to the capital!” We’re all waiting to bask in your glory!”

“Watch me!” Song Rui clenched his fist and said.

Everyone burst into laughter.

After leaving the orchard, Xia ruofei brought his brothers for a tour of his small villa.

The villa wasn’t very big, and the decorations weren’t luxurious either. But to have such a villa in a Farm Village far from the city, standing on the terrace and looking out at the sea, breathing the fresh air of the suburbs every day, all of this made Zhao Yongjun and the others extremely envious.

“No wonder brother Xia rarely goes back to stay for a few days even though he has such a big courtyard house in Beijing ...” Hou Liang could not help but say,”if I had such a big farm and such a villa, I wouldn’t be willing to go back to Beijing to breathe in the fog either ...”

“Come on! The land in the countryside is not worth much!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”back then, my entire farm added together was not as expensive as this small building, and this building was actually only worth two million! It’s not even worth as much as a small house in the capital!”

Zhao Yongjun laughed.”Brothers, let’s tidy up the club and find a good place. It won’t be worse than ruofei’s farm!”

Zhao Yongjun’s words made everyone look forward to the club.

Song Rui also said,”ruofei, hurry up and tell your father – in – Law that we have high hopes for Ling Ji’s private kitchen!” This is a strong cooperation!” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“I think Xiao Rui likes Ling Ji’s private kitchen’s steamed Chinese perch and the secret Buddha Jumps Over the Wall,” Zhao Yongjun joked.

“Hehe, it’s the same, it’s the same ...” Song Rui laughed drily.

At this moment, Xia ruofei’s phone vibrated. He picked it up and looked at the caller ID. He smiled at song Rui and said,””Speak of the Devil, the devil has arrived! My father – in – Law is calling! I’m going to answer the phone first, help yourself! If you want to drink tea, make it yourself! The tea leaves are in the ice bar next to the TV cabinet!”

With that, Xia ruofei walked to the courtyard with his phone and answered the call.

“Uncle Ling!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Ruofei, Qingxue has mentioned to me about opening a branch in the capital!” Ling Xiaotian went straight to the point, then asked,”what exactly do your friends do? Could they coordinate their relationship in all aspects of Beijing? You have to know that it’s not easy to hold a meeting these days. There are no less than 3000 big and small clubs in the entire Beijing area ...”

“Uncle Ling, didn’t Qingxue tell you about my friends?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

Ling Xiaotian said,”this girl only has a rough understanding of them. She knows that their backgrounds are not simple. However, you have never told her in detail about their identities!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but Pat his forehead and said with a bitter smile,””Uncle Ling, that’s my problem, but I’m still very optimistic about our cooperation this time. If you have the intention, you can consider it. My friends ... They ... Should be considered among the most powerful group of people in Beijing! Anyway, it’s more than enough to support a club. ”

Ling Xiaotian was stunned for a moment before he said,”ruofei, there are many hidden talents in the capital, and they are the most powerful ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said two names. One was elder song and the other was general Zhao Cheng.

Then, he turned to Ling Xiaotian and said,”uncle Ling, among my friends here, one of them is the eldest son and grandson of the song family. Another one is the only son of the general of Zhao city. As for the other families, they are slightly weaker. However, they are not that far off!”

After Ling Xiaotian heard this, he could not help but be in a daze.

If one was not very concerned about politics, they might not know about general Zhao Cheng. However, elder song’s name was well – known in Xuanji. He had been on the news almost every day for several years. It could be said that he was a memory of a generation.

Moreover, elder song’s body was very healthy, so one could imagine the strength of the song family.

Ling Xiaotian knew that Xia ruofei was very capable and had made many powerful friends. However, he could not imagine that even elder song’s grandson would call Xia ruofei his brother.

“Uncle Ling, do you think that there will be any problems with the coordination of various parties when my friends form a partnership to open a club?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

Ling Xiaotian also came back to his senses and said without hesitation,””Of course, no problem! Ruofei, so you’re saying that ... You’re the one who’s helping your uncle Ling this time!”

Xia ruofei hurriedly said,”uncle Ling, please don’t say that. We’re family ... Besides, my friend suggested this. They were shocked after tasting our signature dish at Ling Ji private kitchen yesterday. When they were discussing the meeting, they immediately thought of bringing in Ling Ji private kitchen!”

Ling Xiaotian hesitated for a moment, but he still could not help but ask,””RUO Fei, will it be difficult to communicate with these young masters?”

It was normal for Ling Xiaotian to have his concerns. After all, even though he was rich, he was still a normal citizen. Zhao Yong Jun and the others could be said to have the ability to turn the clouds and rain with a flip of their hands. In this kind of unequal cooperation, the weaker party would easily suffer losses.

For example, the club’s expenses would definitely be settled at the same time, and the Chinese restaurant would be settled by the club and Ling Ji’s private kitchen. By then, the payment period would be longer, and if it was delayed even a little, it was even possible that the matter would be left unsettled.

Ling’s food and beverage group didn’t have any Foundation in Beijing, and Zhao Yongjun and the others all had strong backgrounds. Wouldn’t they have no way to turn to?

Worse still, it was possible that they would try to rope in the employees of Ling Ji’s private kitchen, poach the chefs who had the core skills, and then kick Ling Ji’s private kitchen out to start a new business.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”uncle Ling, I understand what you mean. Don’t worry!” Let me put it this way! These friends ... They’re all giving me face. When our Ling Ji private kitchen entered the club, they couldn’t wait to take care of us! How could he play any tricks?”

Ling Xiaotian was not worried about Xia ruofei. He knew that Xia ruofei was a steady person. If he was not confident, he would not have said that.

Although he didn’t know why Zhao Yongjun, song Rui, and the others would give Xia ruofei so much face, he still believed in Xia ruofei.

“I’m much more at ease now that you’ve said this. ” Ling Xiaotian said,”ruofei, I’ll get my subordinates to start preparing for this project!”

The lingji F & B group would definitely expand in all aspects in the future. If they could take root in Beijing in advance, it would be of great significance to the entire group.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded,”no problem, uncle Ling!” These friends of mine will be staying in the southeast province for a few days. I’ll find an opportunity to bring them to the company and we can sit down and have a detailed discussion ...”

Xia ruofei paused and continued,””By the way, our initial discussion is to invest 300 million Yuan in the first phase, and then exchange it for funds through the operation of land mortgage loans to start the construction of the club. “As for Ling Ji’s private kitchen, we’ve reached a consensus that if you’re willing, you can exchange your shares to carry out in – depth cooperation. As for the specific share exchange plan and ratio, we can discuss it after an evaluation!”
