3079 Wild tea on a Lone Peak (1) 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Xia ruofei did not know that Chen Nanfeng had already seen through his disguise.

He then followed Chen Xuan out of the meeting hall.

Chen Xuan was still as gentle and refined as ever, but Xia ruofei could clearly feel that he had relaxed a lot after he walked out of the hall.

It seemed that when facing Chen Nanfeng, not only did Xia ruofei feel a lot of pressure, but even Chen Xuan, Chen Nanfeng’s son, was not at ease!

“Brother Xia, the wild tea tree is located on an uninhabited Lone Peak, and there is no chain Bridge connecting it. There are also many arrays set up at the bottom of the peak, so we have to fly there on a sword.” Chen Xuan smiled as he explained,”this is the only place within the first heaven society that allows you to ride a flying sword. Of course, you have to get permission from the sect master first.”

“I was planning to bring you there on the Clearwater flying boat, brother Xia.” Chen Xuan continued.”I didn’t expect...Brother Xia, you really don’t show your true colors!”

The moment he thought about how this young man was already a golden core cultivator, Chen Xuan, who had always prided himself on his outstanding talent, felt his face burn.

Ever since he was young, Chen Xuan had always been ‘someone else’s child’. Not only did he come from an illustrious family, he was also extremely talented. No matter what he did, he was always the best. Now that a frame of reference that was even more freakish than his had suddenly appeared, Chen Xuan suddenly felt that he had lived his life for the past forty years in vain.

“Please forgive me, brother Chen. I didn’t mean to hide it ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“I understand!” Chen Xuan waved his hand. He understood! Let’s not talk about this anymore. Brother Xia, why don’t we join forces and ride our flying swords later?”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

“That’s good. Brother Xia, this way please!” Chen Xuan said.

Although one could ride a sword on the lone Peak, they were not allowed to do so at the entrance of the meeting hall on Yunxiao peak.

Hence, Chen Xuan brought Xia ruofei to the lone Peak on foot.

Once again, they crossed the Chain Bridge. Then, the two of them walked down the mountain path. After walking for about half an hour in the valley, Xia ruofei saw a steep peak in front of him.

This Lone Peak could be said to be a thousand feet tall. It was basically perpendicular to the ground, as if it was man – made.

From this side, it looked like a rock that was a few hundred meters tall, and not a blade of grass grew on it.

If Xia ruofei had not known in advance, he would not have imagined that there would be a tea tree growing in such an environment.

The wild tea trees were so important that they were naturally guarded by disciples.

There were also many formations at the bottom of the mountain. Although they were still a distance away, Xia ruofei could already feel the strong waves of formations.

As Chen Xuan and Xia ruofei walked closer, two disciples in martial arts suits appeared from behind the rocks. They cupped their fists and bowed respectfully,””Greetings, young sect leader!”

“Yes!” Chen Xuan nodded and said,”I’ve received orders from the sect master to bring fellow Daoist Xia from the star Seizer sect here to retrieve two wild tea leaves!”

After saying those words, Chen Xuan took out an exquisite token from his storage ring.

Even though he was Chen Nanfeng’s son, he still had to follow the rules in this heavily guarded place.

Chen Nanfeng had given this token to him yesterday. Chen Xuan knew that Xia ruofei’s most important purpose was to get the wild tea tree branches.

One of the disciples stepped forward and took the token with both hands. After carefully checking it, he nodded and said,””Young sect leader, the token is correct! Please!”

“That’s right!” Chen Xuan nodded.”You guys just have to shut down the flight prohibiting formation. Brother Xia and I will Mount the sword and ascend the lone Peak!”

This Lone Peak was surrounded by a dense array, which was naturally to prevent the wild tea trees from getting into an accident.

The lone Peak was located inside the heavenly sect and was protected by the sect’s great formation. To put it bluntly, the formation around the lone Peak was just to add a few extra layers of security and to prevent ordinary disciples from accidentally entering the Forbidden Zone.

“Yes! Young sect leader!” The two disciples said in unison.

“Please wait for a moment, young sect master!” One of the disciples said.

With that, he took Chen Xuan’s token and hurried back into a two – story house built against the mountain wall at the bottom of the mountain.

After a while, the disciple walked out and returned the token with both hands. He then respectfully said,”Reporting to young sect leader, the No – Fly formation has been shut down. Young sect leader, you can set off at any time!”

“Thank you for your trouble!” Chen Xuan said gently. Then, he turned to Xia ruofei and smiled.”Brother Xia, please!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei nodded.

The two of them walked side by side in the direction of the lone Peak. When they were about 50 meters away, Chen Xuan stopped and said,””If we go any further, we’ll trigger the formation here. Brother Xia, the No – Fly formation has been shut down. Let’s go up from here on our flying swords!”

“I’ll follow brother Chen’s arrangements!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

With a single thought, Chen Xuan summoned the flying sword from his dantian.

It was a light green flying sword, about two fingers wide and 50 centimeters in length. What was different was that this flying sword did not give Xia ruofei a sharp feeling. Instead, it exuded vitality as if it was not a sword, but a field with the fragrance of paddies or an Orchard full of fruits ...

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel amazed. At the same time, he took out his flying sword.

He didn’t know how famous the blue travel immortal sword was in the cultivation world, so he didn’t take it out rashly. Instead, he took out a flying sword left by master Yuntai.
