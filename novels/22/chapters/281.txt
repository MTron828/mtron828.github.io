Chapter 282: Finally found_1

Even with Xu Wu’s confident assurance, the head of security, Huang Fang, was still a little uneasy. It was only when he saw elder song and Xia ruofei’s figures at the intersection that the stone in his heart was lifted. He quickly brought two subordinates to welcome them. “Old commander, did you find the person you wanted to see?” Huang Fang stepped forward and asked respectfully. “He’s already moved away,”said elder song. But we’ve found some clues. Little Huang, let’s go to yangdun town next. ” “Yes!” Huang Fang puffed out his chest and said. The group got into their respective cars, and the convoy restarted, driving toward yangdun town, which was more than 30 kilometers away. Along the way, elder song’s mood was a little agitated. He looked out of the window at the fields that flew past, and his thoughts were complicated. Xia ruofei and the others kept quiet and did not disturb elder song. The car was equipped with advanced navigation equipment, so the driver found yangdun town easily. It was a very ordinary town, similar to the thousands of small towns in China. There was only one main street in the entire town, and the houses on both sides were at most three or four stories. There were some snack shops, hardware stores, small supermarkets, and tea shops that were everywhere on Mount Wuyi. Xia ruofei thought for a while and said to elder song,””Chief, I’ll go and check on the situation later. How about you rest in the car?” Xia ruofei’s main concern was that the town was not as remote as xiankeng. If elder song showed his face in public and went around to ask for information, it was inevitable that he would be recognized. By then, it would go against the old man’s original intention of traveling in plain clothes. Eccentric song had obviously considered this point as well. He pondered for a moment before nodding.”Sure, Xiao Rui will go with you!” “Alright!” Song Rui said happily. He was already feeling uncomfortable from sitting in the car, and he wanted to go out for some fresh air. The car stopped by the roadside and Xia ruofei and song Rui got out. Huang Fang, who was in the black Mercedes – Benz in front, also got out of the car. After asking Xia ruofei, he arranged for two men to accompany Xia ruofei and song Rui. The town wasn’t big, and it had a name. The information was very clear. He even knew that Li Guizhi’s wife ran an electrical appliance repair shop on the streets of the town. Unless this shop had closed down in the past few years, it would be easy to find out. It turned out that Xia ruofei’s luck was not bad. After asking two people, he had already found the exact location of Li Guizhi’s shop. The electrical appliance repair shop was not far away. Hence, Xia ruofei did not return to the car. Instead, he gestured to Huang Fang to follow them. Then, Xia ruofei and song Rui led the two men in Black and walked forward. After walking for about 30 to 40 meters, Xia ruofei saw the electrical appliance repair shop that the passerby had told him about. There was an old sign with the words “Yusheng electrical appliances repair shop” on it. The paint on the sign had peeled off a little, and the words were barely recognizable. The shop was very small. There was a small counter at the outermost area, which sold some small electrical appliances. There was a key – matching machine next to the counter. It should be a derivative business of the repair shop. Further in, there was a row of shelves, on which were some disassembled old electrical appliances. Next to the shelf was a workbench, which was scattered with some electronic components. An old man in his 60s was holding an electric soldering iron under the table lamp, welding an electronic board. “Excuse me ... Is this Li Guizhi’s family’s shop?” Xia ruofei asked. The old man in blue overalls heard the sound and put the electric soldering iron back on the shelf. He then took off his reading glasses and turned around. When the old man saw Xia ruofei, song Rui, and the two men in Black, his expression changed slightly. His eyes flickered as he said,””I don’t know any Li Guizhi. You’ve come to the wrong place.” “How is that possible?” song Rui immediately asked. We just asked the townspeople, and they all said that this Yusheng electronics repair shop was opened by Li Guizhi’s lover!” The old man frowned and said,”I don’t know, I don’t know!” You guys can leave!” Xia ruofei looked at the old man thoughtfully and smiled.””You should be Li Guizhi’s lover, Mr. Niu Yusheng, right? Was there some misunderstanding here? We’re not bad people. We’re here to visit old Mr. Li at the request of an old friend of Mr. Li Zhifu. ” When the old man heard li Zhifu’s name, his face changed. He said,””Why are you so strange? I already said that I don’t know any Li Guizhi or li Zhifu. You guys should leave! Don’t disturb my business!” At this time, the innermost door of the shop was pushed open, and an old woman in her 60s came out and asked,””Yusheng, what happened? I could hear your loud voice from the second floor. Dad had just fallen asleep and was almost woken up by you!” “This is none of your business, go back!” The old man said with a frown. The sixty – year – old woman also saw Xia ruofei and the others. When she saw the two burly Men in Black behind Xia ruofei, her expression changed and she shouted,””What are you guys doing here? My dad was so scared of you guys, and you still haven’t given up?” “Auntie, when did we scare your dad?” Song Rui was confused.”Did you make a mistake?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”this must be Madam Li Guizhi?” I think you might have misunderstood. We are not bad people. We are here to find Mr. Li Zhifu. ” “I know you’re looking for my dad!” Li Guizhi said angrily,”aren’t you guys annoying? My dad already said that he won’t be coming out of retirement. Why are you guys still shamelessly coming to my door?” “You’ve misunderstood. We’re not here to invite old Mr. Li to come out of retirement. ” Xia ruofei said patiently,”we were asked by an old friend of old Mr. Li to come and visit him.” “A new trick again?” Li Guizhi glanced at Xia ruofei and said,”young man, you look like a talented person. Why don’t you walk the right path? If you want to make tea leaves, just do it. Why do you have to involve my dad?” Xia ruofei saw that Li Guizhi seemed to have determined that they were bad people and couldn’t help but smile bitterly. He thought for a while and said,”it seems like you have misunderstood me. How about this? you can tell Mr. Li Zhifu that Mr. Song from the capital is here to visit him. He should know.” “What elder song from the capital?” Li Guizhi obviously didn’t believe her.”My dad has never left the southeast province in his life. How could he know people from Beijing?” Young man, can’t you make it more believable when you’re lying?” “Auntie, why can’t you tell good from bad?” Song Rui couldn’t help but frown.”We already said that we’re old Mr. Li’s old friends. Won’t you know if you ask him?” “My dad was shocked the day before yesterday and has fallen ill!” Li Guizhi said coldly,”he just fell asleep. Do you think I’ll wake him up again for you?” At this moment, the door at the back of the shop was opened again, and a white – haired old man walked out with a cane. Li Guizhi’s expression changed slightly. She quickly went over to support him and said,”Dad, Didn’t I tell you to rest upstairs? Why did you come down on your own? What if I fall down again?” The old man ignored his daughter and looked at Xia ruofei. His voice trembled as he asked,””Who did you say was from the capital?”
