2743 A direct confrontation_1

As soon as Xia ruofei’s figure appeared, Luo Qingfeng immediately sensed that Xi Jue was near the core of the array. He did not dare to relax and kept his spiritual power on high alert.

Qingfeng Luo did not turn around. Instead, he controlled his meteor flying sword and stabbed it toward the core array disc.

The meteor flying sword, as its name suggested, was extremely fast. As it flew, it let out a piercing sound. In the blink of an eye, it had already stabbed heavily into the core formation plate.

However, the scene that Luo Qingfeng was looking forward to did not appear. The core array disc suddenly burst out with a brilliant light, and a translucent light film appeared. Before meteor sword’s lightning – like attack could touch the core array disc, it was blocked. The light film only caved in a little and immediately returned to its original state. Meteor sword could not move forward at all. No matter how hard Luo Qingfeng tried, he could not break the light film.

“Hmph!” Luo Qingfeng snorted coldly and retrieved his flying sword with a wave of his hand. Then, he turned around and looked at Xia ruofei coldly.

Luo Qingfeng was very experienced in combat. He knew very well that the entire array was controlled by Xia ruofei. Although he did not know how Xia ruofei had disappeared, the moment he reappeared, he did not attack Xia ruofei just because he had a higher cultivation level. Instead, he planned to destroy the array disc first. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

From Luo Qingfeng’s point of view, the Taixu xuanqing formation was Xia ruofei’s biggest reliance. As long as he could completely crack the formation, he would be able to capture Xia ruofei, who was only at the ninth level of the aura refining realm.

Even a Lion would use its full strength when hunting a rabbit, not to mention that there were too many uncertain factors in the Taixu xuanqing formation.

However, it was obvious that Xia ruofei’s reaction was also quite fast. He activated the defensive function of the formation at the first moment.

Luo Qingfeng realized that he could not destroy the array disc in a short period of time, so he decisively chose to give up and turned to face Xia ruofei.

As long as he could restrain Xia ruofei in an instant, the formation would not be a problem without a controller.

At the end of the day, strength was the only thing that mattered.

“Hmph!” Luo Qingfeng snorted coldly.”I didn’t expect you to have some tricks up your sleeve!” You actually managed to escape from my hands and even knew to protect the formation at the first moment. Your reaction is also fast! However ... You still dare to appear here. Could it be that you think I can’t do anything to you?”

Xia ruofei’s lips curved up and he said,””If I were you, I wouldn’t be so confident. Who said that you can do anything to me?”

Luo Qingfeng could not help but burst into laughter as if what Xia ruofei had said was the funniest joke he had ever heard in his life.

Luo Qingfeng pointed at Xia ruofei and said,””Why don’t you use the formation and see if you can escape from me again at such a close distance ...”

As soon as Luo Qingfeng finished speaking, Xia ruofei disappeared into thin air again.

Luo Qingfeng was stunned. The expression on his face was very interesting. It was as if a thousand alpacas were running wildly in his heart. I just said you can’t escape, and you disappeared into thin air again? Did he have to slap his face like this?

The next moment, Xia ruofei suddenly appeared again. This time, he appeared behind Luo Qingfeng.

Luo Qingfeng noticed it immediately and turned around. He stared at Xia ruofei with a serious expression and asked,””You ... How did you do that? Could this also be the effect of the Taixu xuanqing formation?”

Xia ruofei smiled and asked,””You want to know?”

Luo Qingfeng nodded subconsciously, but then immediately realized that his reaction seemed too low. He immediately snorted and said,””Stop playing tricks! It was nothing more than using the power of formations or magic treasures to hide their tracks! What can you do to me? Don’t tell me that you want to rely on your cultivation of refined Qi level 9 to ...”

Luo Qingfeng suddenly stopped. He looked as if he had seen a ghost. He stared at Xia ruofei, and his mouth opened subconsciously. He did not come back to his senses for a long time.

Xia ruofei crossed his arms and looked at Luo Qingfeng with a faint smile on his face.

Luo Qingfeng asked with a trembling voice,””You ... You’ve broken through?”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,” He had accidentally used too much strength just now and directly broke through! Sigh ... I originally wanted to lay a more solid foundation for cultivation, but I didn’t expect to break through so quickly. What a headache!”

Luo Qingfeng almost spat out a mouthful of blood.

Still vexed?

Troubled your sister!

When other cultivators broke through the shackles of the Qi refining stage, they had to go through a considerable amount of accumulation. Moreover, before the breakthrough, they had to make sufficient preparations and adjust their physical condition to the best state. Then, they would find someone they absolutely trusted to help guard them, and then they would go into seclusion to breakthrough.

Even for cultivators with a solid foundation and extremely high talent, it would take a long time to break through the bottleneck of such a big realm.

Back when Luo Qingfeng broke through the shackles of refined Qi level 9, he had gone into seclusion for seven days and seven nights before he was lucky enough to break through.

It had only been 20 to 30 minutes since he stepped into the Taixu xuanqing formation. Besides, Xia ruofei couldn’t have started to break through before he entered the formation. Otherwise, this couldn’t be explained by Almighty Xin. It was simply stupid.

Luo Qingfeng judged that Xia ruofei had most likely entered the state of breakthrough uncontrollably while he was breaking through the layers of formations with an unstoppable force. He had been continuously injecting essential Qi into the formations at all costs and at the same time, replenishing his essential Qi through cultivation. Moreover, his own cultivation had long reached the critical point.
