Chapter 1813: The Feng Shui Bureau in the building (2)

Translator: 549690339

As they had to invite Xu lang to visit Tao Yuan farm the next morning, Xia ruofei had asked the company to book a few more rooms. He, Feng Jing, and Liu Qian were staying at the Shangri – La so that they could leave the next day.

Xia ruofei made this arrangement for the convenience of work, but Liu Qian was very happy. Not only did she experience the high – speed rail business class that was more expensive than plane tickets, but she also tasted the expensive rotten wine that cost tens of thousands of Yuan a bottle. She could even stay in a five – Star hotel at night. It was simply too great!

The next day, Xia ruofei and the rest had breakfast at Shangri – La before checking out and driving to Taoyuan farm.

Xu lang requested to get off the car at the entrance of Tao Yuan farm. Then, he walked in while looking around casually.

Dong Yun, who was at work, also heard the news and came out to greet him. She wasn’t very interested in Feng Shui metaphysics, but she was more interested in the Feng Shui Master employed by mogul li.

In fact, Xia ruofei was also very curious.

However, Xu lang was not a Fengshui master like they had imagined, who was measuring everywhere with a compass or a mahogany sword. He just watched casually and did not say a word during the whole process. He even had an unfathomable smile on his face.

In the end, Xu lang asked Xia ruofei to bring him to the orchard at the back of the mountain. The vantage point here allowed him to have a panoramic view of the entire Taoyuan farm.

Xu lang stopped at the highest point of the orchard for about three minutes. He smiled at Xia ruofei and said,””Mr. Xia, let’s go to your company’s new headquarters now!”

Xia ruofei and Feng Jing looked at each other, slightly surprised.

However, they did not question Xu Lang’s professionalism. Xia ruofei immediately called to arrange for a car to be driven over. Then, the group took two separate cars and headed to the Taoyuan building in the city.

When he arrived at the Paradise building, Xu lang was also not in a hurry to enter. Instead, he looked up in front of the building, then scanned the surrounding environment before he stepped in.

Xu lang took the elevator directly to the top floor where Xia ruofei’s office was located. He looked down from Xia ruofei’s big office. When he saw the intersection of the two rivers in the distance, his expression changed slightly.

After they finished reading, Xia ruofei and Xu lang returned to the reception area in the office and sat down.

Xia ruofei asked,”uncle Xu, how is it?” How’s the Fengshui of our headquarters?”

Xu lang smiled.”Mr. Xia, forgive me for being blunt. From a Feng Shui perspective, your company’s current headquarters is slightly better than the new building, especially in terms of aura. The farm is obviously more conducive to your company’s development ...” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. Then, he guessed what Xu lang was talking about.

The farm had planted a large number of paradise vegetables and was also breeding Yangtze River Chinese perch. Hence, Xia ruofei would regularly add the spirit Heart Flower petal solution to the water tower at the top of the mountain and the water tower of the Chinese perch farm.

These vegetables and pomfrets had absorbed the components of the spirit Heart Flower and grew up, so they were richer in spirit Qi than ordinary vegetables. After large – scale planting, the spirit Qi in the entire farm was also richer than in ordinary places.

This was probably the reason why Xu lang could sense his ‘aura’ better!

Just as Xia ruofei was thinking about how to explain, Xu lang suddenly changed the topic and said with a smile,””If it wasn’t for the intersection of the two rivers, I would definitely advise Mr. Xia not to move the headquarters. However, the existence of the intersection of the two rivers makes the Feng Shui of this building more possible, so it’s not impossible to move ...”

Xia ruofei raised his head and looked at the intersection of the two rivers through the glass wall. He smiled and asked,””Uncle Xu, is there anything special about this?”

“The intersection of two waters is a place where wind and Qi are hidden.” Uncle Xu smiled and said,”your company building is facing the intersection of two rivers. If used properly, the Fengshui of the entire building can be improved to a higher level. At least it won’t be inferior to the farm!”

Xia ruofei actually knew that the core competitive strength of Taoyuan farm was not Feng Shui. If he wanted to, he could also fill the building with rich spiritual Qi. However, he did not reject Feng Shui metaphysics. No matter what, a person like Xu lang was not an undeserved reputation. His advice was very useful.

Hence, Xia ruofei asked humbly,””Uncle Xu, do we need to set up anything in the building?”

Uncle Xu smiled and said,”Mr. Xia’s office is the highest point of this building. I’ve seen the layout and furnishings of the office. I believe that the decoration and layout were done with the help of people in the industry. Overall, it’s standard and there are no mistakes. But with all due respect, there aren’t many outstanding areas either.”

Feng Jing was the one who designed the building. Xia ruofei did not know if Feng Jing had hired a Fengshui master, but he believed that she had done so. When it came to doing business, one had to be at ease.

“Uncle Xu, please give me some pointers!” Xia ruofei said.

Xu lang smiled, stood up, and walked to a Bogu shelf.””Adjust this shelf so it’s East – West. In addition, the Kasaya on it is not suitable. This office hasn’t been used yet, and these two sisters – in – Law haven’t been here for long, so they haven’t been tainted by Mr. Xia’s aura yet. You can just get them to remove them. ”

From a traditional point of view, kasayas could gather wealth. It was very common to have kasayas in a businessman’s office. However, since Xu lang said that he wanted to remove them, he must have his reasons. Hence, Xia ruofei did not ask for the reason. He asked Feng Jing to write it down and take the Kasaya away.

Xu lang explained,”when two rivers meet, not only will it bring wealth, but it will also bring evil. So, it’s not appropriate to place the Kasaya. The Kasaya is famous for being indiscriminate and swallowing everything. If it’s used for too long, more evil will gather, which may be detrimental to your company.”

Xu lang continued,”we have to gather wealth and resolve evil spirits at the same time. My suggestion is to invite the second master of the Guan family to come back and make sure that the Green Dragon Crescent Blade is pointed in the direction of the intersection of the two rivers. This way, the Feng Shui Bureau of the entire building will have no problems!”

Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat.”Uncle Xu, I have a Guan Yu here. Please wait a moment. I’ll go invite him up!”

Xia ruofei recalled the Jade sculptures that he had previously sculpted. Other than giving one each to Ling Xiaotian and elder song, the rest were kept in the spirit map space. The statue of Guan Yu was also readily available.

The entire office was not in use, so Xia ruofei naturally could not go to the lounge to “get” the Kasaya. That would be too unreasonable.

He took the elevator to the underground parking lot. After he got into the Knight XV’s car, he reached into the Knight XV’s glove box and took out the Jade Kasaya from the spirit map. He was so cautious because there were surveillance cameras everywhere in the underground parking lot. Xia ruofei did not want the surveillance cameras to capture a Jade Kasaya appearing in his hand out of thin air.

There was no formation on these jade carvings. However, Xia ruofei’s spiritual power had made another breakthrough. It was easy for him to set up a spirit gathering formation. Almost instantly, he used his spiritual power to brand the entire spirit gathering formation on the Jade carvings.

Even if there were surveillance cameras, they could only see Xia ruofei’s hand gently touching the Jade statue a few times.

Xia ruofei took the Jade statue of Guan Yu, which had been set up with a spirit gathering formation, and took the elevator back to the office on the 15th floor.

While Xu lang and Feng Rao were drinking tea and chatting, Xia ruofei placed the Jade statue of Lord Guan on the shelf where the Kasaya was originally placed. He smiled and said,””Uncle Xu, could you please check if Lord Guan’s position is correct?”

Xu lang stood up and walked toward the bogujia.

When his eyes fell on the statue of Duke Guan, his eyes brightened and he quickened his pace.

Xu lang walked quickly to the Jade statue. He looked at it in amazement for a long time before he said with a wry smile,”Mr. Xia, if you had told me earlier that you had a magic tool, I wouldn’t have to spend so much effort thinking about how to break the evil Qi.”
