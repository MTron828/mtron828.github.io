Chapter 1919 Leading by the nose (1)

Da Liu took the phone and glanced at it. His eyes widened, and he looked up at Liu Dong.””This is ... My little aunt?” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Liu Dong nodded dejectedly.

Da Liu didn’t ask if the man was Liu Dong. Who would be so stupid as to show people intimate photos of him and his wife, and with such a dejected look?

“Uncle Dong, you have to be careful about this!” Da Liu asked,”where did you get this photo? Don’t tell me it was photoshopped? Little aunt has been quite popular recently, so she might attract jealousy and hatred ...”

“The photos must be real!” Liu Dong sighed. Little da! You know that I don’t know anyone in San Shan. I’m just a technician in my unit. I really have no choice but to ask you to help me ...”

Da Liu frowned slightly and said,””So ... You’ve already confirmed it?”

“En!” Liu Dong nodded weakly.

Although Dong Liu and Da Liu had very different personalities, they both grew up in the same environment. Traditional ideas were deeply rooted in their hearts, and they had the same opinion on this matter. Da Liu even felt angry because he felt the same way.

“Fuck! Who is this man?” Liu DA’s eyes widened as he said,”uncle Dong, tell me who he is! I’ll help you cripple him! And little ... Bah! And this Fang Chenchen, I’m going to ruin her reputation! Shameless thing! You actually dared to steal a man!”

In the rental house, Xu Yougang quietly listened to the sound from the monitor headset. He admired Xia ruofei even more.

Liu Dong’s heart warmed slightly. Although Da Liu had not put his plan into action yet, he suddenly felt like he had a backbone. Even hearing Da Liu’s harsh words made him feel a sense of pleasure.

“Da,” Liu Dong said after some thought,”I’ve come to you because I have no other choice. I hope that this matter will end with you. Don’t let word of this get back to our hometown. Otherwise, we’ll all be embarrassed ...”

“What kind of person do you think I am, uncle Dong?” asked Liu Da. Am I the kind of person who would gossip? Besides, what good will it do me if this matter is spread?”

“That’s good, that’s good ...” Liu Dong felt relieved and said,”I’m just afraid that it’ll cause a huge commotion ...”

“Don’t worry!” Liu Da said,”our village is so closed off, and we are the only ones who are working outside. There are only the two of us here at San Shan. Some of the younger generation are working outside, but who would know that Fang Chenchen is your wife? As long as I don’t go back and tell them, no one will know!”

“Yes, yes, yes!” Liu Dong nodded and said,”thank you in advance, da! I owe you a favor!”

“Uncle Dong, why are you being so polite with me?” Da Liu said,”back then, we went to school together. After you passed the exam, I became a hooligan, but you, a college student, never looked down on me. You even brought me things when you went home during the holidays. I really treated you as a brother!”

If an outsider had heard Liu DA’s words, they would have thought that the seniority was a mess, but this was the truth. Although the two of them were uncle and nephew in the clan, and they were used to calling each other uncle and nephew, they were actually of the same age. Their relationship was more like that of good friends and brothers.

After Da Liu finished, he said anxiously,””Uncle Dong, let’s not talk about this useless stuff! Quickly tell me, who is that man? I’ll find someone to cripple him tonight!”

“I don’t know ...” Liu Dong was stunned for a moment.

“What?” Da Liu opened his mouth wide.”Then ... Where did you get this photo?”

“Someone sent it to me.” Liu Dong said.

Just as he was about to tell her the whole story, the phone in his pocket rang again.

Liu Dong quickly took out his phone, glanced at the caller ID, and answered the call.

Before he could speak, the familiar electronic voice came from the phone again.”Not bad, you kept your word. To show my sincerity, I’m sending you something ...”

Then, before Liu Dong could say anything, the call was hung up.

“Who is it?” “Uncle Dong, why aren’t you saying anything?” Da Liu asked, looking at him.

At that moment, ding dong received a new message on WeChat. He did not bother to answer Da Liu’s question and quickly opened his WeChat. It was a message from justice is not absent.

Liu Dong opened it and saw that it was a short video. The WeChat message showed that it was about 15 seconds long. He clicked on the video with a complicated expression.

Da Liu subconsciously moved closer to take a look.

Liu Dong and Da Liu’s faces turned ugly.

In the video, the man was lying on his back on the bed, and Fang Chenchen was sitting on him with her back facing him, twisting her body with all her might.

The camera was from the end of the bed, so Fang Chenchen could be seen clearly. The man’s face was blocked by Fang Chenchen’s upper body.

The video had been edited, and there was only one scene. The man’s face was not revealed at all.

However, the video completely shattered Liu Dong’s last bit of hope.

If there was a small possibility that the photos were composed by an expert, then this video was definitely irrefutable evidence. Although the video was not long, it was completely impossible to move the people in the motion image. Even if it was a video that was only a dozen seconds long, it had been hundreds of frames. Was it possible to edit every frame? The amount of manpower and time it would take was simply unimaginable.
