2892 It’s fate!_

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile. Luo Qingfeng was careful with his words. He would not dare to say anything that he was not 100% sure of in front of Xia ruofei. However, Xia ruofei did not care too much about this and was just having a casual chat.

He had already decided to attend this auction. If a storage ring appeared at the auction, he would try his best to get it. If there wasn ‘t, it was fine. He would just treat it as a chance to broaden his horizons. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Although Xia ruofei had already cultivated to the early – Stage golden elixir realm, which was not considered low in the current cultivation world, he did not know much about the cultivation world. Most of the limited information he knew was told to him by Luo Qingfeng and Liu chengfeng. This auction was a rare opportunity to meet many cultivators and get close to them. Xia ruofei would naturally not let this opportunity go.

Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng chatted as they flew northeast on their flying swords.

In fact, such a long – distance flight was very boring, especially when they were flying above the sea most of the time. After the initial sense of novelty passed, the scene in front of them was always the same sea. There was no end in sight, as if there was no end to it no matter how much they flew.

This was especially true for this route, where they would not pass by any islands along the way, which made it even more monotonous.

To be honest, sword Kinesis flight consumed very little vital Qi. Even if Luo Qingfeng’s sword Kinesis was not as advanced as Xia ruofei ‘s, he was also an early – Stage golden core cultivator and could still rely on his own vital Qi to carry out sword Kinesis flight for a long time.

The two of them set off in the afternoon, and they were flying in the direction of the earth’s rotation, so the sky quickly darkened.

Without them realizing it, the fiery red sun slowly sank below the sea level behind them. As the sun set, the sky above the sea quickly turned dark.

Cultivators had a strong sense of direction. Besides, Xia ruofei had the phone’s GPS to confirm his location. Hence, the poor visibility did not affect their flight. However, flying in the same direction like this was really boring.

At least Xia ruofei still had Luo Qingfeng to chat with. He thought of how Luo Qingfeng had flown to Peach Blossom Island overnight and flew alone. One could imagine how boring it must have been.

Although the two of them had not consumed much of their vital Qi, Xia ruofei had only used a little less than half of the vital Qi in his dantian, and Luo Qingfeng had at least half of his vital Qi reserves, Xia ruofei still decided to rest for a while.

In any case, the matter of transporting weapons and equipment itself was not particularly urgent. If it wasn’t for the fact that the shipping time was too long, and he had just broken through to the early jiedan stage and hadn’t tried long – distance sword riding, he definitely wouldn’t have personally been a Porter.

However, the guards of Paradise Island were not in place yet, so it didn’t matter whether the weapons arrived a few days earlier or later.

Hence, Xia ruofei did not need to rush with all his might.

Hence, he slowed down his flying speed. Luo Qingfeng, who was beside him, saw that Xia ruofei had slowed down and quickly did the same.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Qingfeng, are you tired?” Do you want to go down and rest for a while?”

“Master, I’m feeling fine. I still have at least half of my Yuan Qi reserves. I can still fly for a few more hours ...” Luo Qingfeng was stunned for a moment.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”there’s no need to tire yourself out. Our mission this time is not urgent.” Even if you’re not tired, I’m feeling a little tired, mainly because I’m too bored ... Why don’t we stop and rest for a while!”

Naturally, Luo Qingfeng did not have any objections to Xia ruofei’s suggestion. However, after thinking for a while, he said hesitantly,””Master, right now we’re all in the ocean ... Why don’t this old servant first look for any nearby islands, and then ask master to move over to rest?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”no need to go through all that trouble!” Let’s go! Let’s go down and talk!”

With that, Xia ruofei controlled the flying sword under his feet and began to descend. Luo Qingfeng followed Xia ruofei, full of doubts.

He thought to himself,”could it be that master wants to control the flying sword to float above the sea to rest?” What was the point of this? Maintaining the floating state of the flying sword consumed Yuan Qi, and with his mental power constantly controlling it, he couldn’t achieve the goal of rest at all! And since they were all floating, why lower their altitude? Wasn’t it the same at an altitude of two to three thousand meters?

Luo Qingfeng could not figure it out, but he still followed Xia ruofei closely and did not ask.

Xia ruofei controlled the blue travel immortal sword and descended to a height of three to four meters above the sea. Even a slightly bigger wave could surge to such a height. However, the two of them were standing on the flying sword and had a Yuan Qi protective shield on the outside. Hence, even if the sea water churned, they would not be wet.

“Qingfeng, stand further away ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Luo Qingfeng was even more confused. However, he still controlled his flying sword and flew more than ten meters away, looking in Xia ruofei’s direction.

What happened next left him dumbfounded. Xia ruofei waved his hand and a ten – meter – long yacht appeared out of thin air above the sea. It landed on the sea and swayed with the waves.
