Chapter 1083: I’ll introduce you to an important person (1)

Translator: 549690339

On Dong Xinyu’s side, the three of them had also exchanged toasts and drank quite a bit.

After a few glasses of wine, Dong Xinyu’s face was flushed red, making her look even more charming and charming. Li Yao’s heart wavered as he looked at her, and his eyes were burning with passion.

“Mr. Li, about the endorsement contract ...” Fang Hongli said in a sweet voice.

Li Yao laughed and said,”don’t worry!” I’ve had my eyes on miss Dong for a long time, and I’ve brought the contract with me. Please sign it if there are no problems with it!”

After he finished speaking, Li Yao took out two copies of the contract from his bag and handed it over.

Fang Hongli and Dong Xinyu quickly took a copy each and found that the terms in the contract were exactly as Li Yao had said before. The contract was signed for three years, and the endorsement fee was three million Yuan per year, and it would increase year by year.

At the end of the contract was Li Yao’s signature and the seal of Yafu company’s Huaxia District.

Dong Xinyu rolled her eyes at Li Yao and said,””Boss li is so bad! You’ve already prepared the contract, but you’re not willing to take it out. You’re making him feel so uneasy ...”

Li Yao laughed and grabbed Dong Xinyu’s fair hand. He squinted his eyes and said,””I’m just admiring miss Dong. I’m just afraid that after miss Dong signs the contract, she won’t be willing to talk to me!”

Dong Xinyu allowed Li Yao to caress her hand as she said in a sweet voice,””How can that be? After I sign the contract, I’ll be yours. How would I dare to ignore you!”

Li Yao could not help but burst into laughter when he heard this. He was indeed just teasing her. He was not worried about this at all. He was not even afraid that Dong Xinyu would go back on her word after signing the endorsement contract.

A small star like Dong Xinyu would definitely not dare to play any tricks in front of Li Yao. Otherwise, she would not be able to survive.

“Miss Dong, can you take a look at the contract? is there any other problem?” “Yes,” Li Yao said.”If there’s no problem, sign it!”

“No problem, no problem!” Dong Xinyu quickly replied.

After that, she exchanged a look with Fang Hongli, then took out a pen and signed her name at the end of the contract. Then she pressed her red fingerprint on the ink pad that Li Yao had prepared in advance and stamped her newly signed name.

“Nice working with you, miss Dong and miss Fang!” Li Yao laughed.

“Happy cooperation!” Dong Xinyu was also very happy.

“Ms. Dong, I’ve already booked a room in Sheraton,” Li Yao said with a smile.”Let’s have a good chat about the specific arrangements for the endorsement tonight, okay?”

Dong Xinyu glanced at Li Yao and said,””Alright! Boss Li, you have to give me some good guidance. I’m afraid I can’t do it well!”

“Hahaha! “No problem, no problem ...” Li Yao said happily.

Both parties kept a copy of the contract and sat down to chat for a while. Then, Li Yao got up and went to the bathroom.

At this moment, his heart was burning with passion. He wanted to quickly pay the bill and bring Dong Xinyu to Sheraton to enjoy this young and beautiful Little Star.

......

Tang Yitian came out of the bathroom and was washing his hands in front of the tap when he suddenly heard a surprised voice.””Mr. Tang!”

He straightened his body and looked back. He was stunned for a second or two before he smiled and said,””You’re ... President li from Yafu, right?”

“Yes, yes, yes. Mr. Tang really has a good memory!” Li Yao was a little flattered.”It turns out that Mr. Tang is also eating with Zola today!” We are really fated!”

Tang Yitian and Li Yao weren’t familiar with each other, but this time, the Yafu group’s Wei nation headquarters didn’t participate in the summit. It was Li Yao who attended on behalf of the Yafu group.

At the banquet organized by the summit, Li Yao took the initiative to toast a few glasses of wine to Tang Yitian and handed him his business card. That was why Tang Yitian had some impression of him.

This was also because the party was held last night. If it had been a little longer, Tang Yitian would have certainly forgotten about Li Yao.

He was a super – rich man with a net worth of more than 10 billion, one of the well – deserved Giants in the Australian retail industry. Although Li Yao’s status was also considered good, he was essentially just a senior employee of Yafu group.

Although Li Yao was able to become the General Manager of the Huaxia region, he certainly had shares, dividends, and a generous annual salary, but compared with Tang Yitian, the difference was naturally like heaven and earth.

Therefore, the fact that Tang Yitian could still remember his name already made Li Yao feel proud and flattered. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Nice to meet you, President li!” Tang Yitian said with a smile.

“Hello, Mr. Tang!” Li Yao humbly asked,”where is Mr. Tang’s seat? I’ll go over and give a toast later!”

Tang Yitian smiled.”Thank you for your kind intentions, President li. We’re just having a small gathering with family and friends. You don’t have to be so polite.”

“You’re too kind, you should be! It’s fate that we met!” Li Yao said quickly.

“There’s really no need for that, President li. I still have something to do. I’ll take my leave first ...”Tang Yitian said.

“Good, good, good. Goodbye, Mr. Tang!” Li Yao said.

Tang Yitian strode away. Li Yao didn’t even have the mood to go to the bathroom. He quickly returned to where Dong Xinyu and Fang Hongli were.

He picked up his glass of red wine and said,”miss Dong, miss Fang, I just met a noble person. Come with me and give him a toast!”

Although Tang Yitian had already declined, Li Yao felt that if he went over to propose a toast, at least he wouldn’t be blamed. After all, one shouldn’t slap a smiling face! Wasn’t there a rule of returning courtesy in China?

Many relationships were built slowly like this.

Besides, there was another important reason that made Li Yao want to get close to him no matter what.

The biggest investor was the entertainment company under the Meiya group. It was said that this entertainment company was also personally managed by the wife of Tang Yitian, the International superstar Jennifer.

The producer of “Angel of doom” was naturally appointed by Maya Entertainment.

To be able to meet Tang Yitian at Zola’s restaurant, Li Yao naturally wanted to bring Dong Xinyu there to propose a toast and show her face. On one hand, it could also show off his strength, and perhaps it could also help Dong Xinyu unlock more positions. On the other hand, being on good terms with a super – rich man like Tang Yitian was something that Li Yao was looking forward to.

Dong Xinyu and Fang Hongli also picked up their glasses and stood up.

Dong Xinyu was almost all over Li Yao’s body. She asked in a sweet voice,””Boss li, who’s the Big Shot?”

Holding back the burning fire in his heart, Li Yao moved aside and said,””When we get there later, don’t do this! You’re a pure and innocent female celebrity!”

Li Yao was afraid that Dong Xinyu would not pay attention to it and ruin things, so he immediately said,””I’m taking you to see Mr. Tang Yitian, the founder of the Maya Group in Australia!”

Dong Xinyu was just a small star. How would she know Tang Yitian’s identity? However, seeing that Li Yao attached so much importance to it, he didn’t dare to neglect it and quickly said,””I got it, boss li!”

Li Yao looked at Dong Xinyu and knew that she did not know about Tang Yitian’s identity. He continued,””You should know about Maya Entertainment, right?”

“Of course!” Dong Xinyu immediately replied. Boss li, among the joint investors of “the angel of doom,” Maya Entertainment has the biggest share of investment! Don’t tell me that the Meya group ...”

“Meia entertainment is just a subsidiary of the Meia group!” Li Yao said proudly. And Mr. Tang Yitian’s wife, the real boss of Meiya entertainment, would definitely shock you if she told you!”

“Boss li, don’t keep me in suspense, please give me some pointers!” “I don’t want you to know that I’ve offended a noble person ...” Dong Xinyu said in a sweet voice.

Li Yao slightly raised his chin and said,””Mr. Tang’s wife was once the movie queen of one of the three major film festivals, the famous international superstar Jennifer! She’s also the head of Maya Entertainment!”

After saying this, Li Yao’s face revealed a reserved expression, as if he was also proud of Tang Yitian and Jennifer’s amazing work.

Dong Xinyu was immediately stunned. Her mouth was so wide that an egg could fit in it.

After a long while, she came back to her senses and quickly asked,””Boss li, could it be ... Jennifer is here too?”

“Of course!” Li Yao replied. So, you have to perform well later! If Jennifer thinks highly of you, your future will be limitless. It wouldn’t even be a problem to increase your screen time in ‘the angel of doom’!”

Dong Xinyu and Fang Hongli looked at each other, and both of them were ecstatic. Dong Xinyu quickly said,””Yes, yes, yes! Thank you for your help, boss li ...”

Li Yao said with a smile,” Miss Dong, as long as you work ‘diligently’, I promise that your future will be very smooth. I have some connections in the entertainment industry ...”

Li Yao specially emphasized the word ‘heart’, and Dong Xinyu understood his meaning. She immediately threw a coquettish glance at Li Yao and said,””Don’t worry, boss Li, I know what to do!”

“Hahaha! Let’s go!” “Don’t forget,” Li Yao said.”Remember to pay attention to your image ...”

Although Tang Yitian didn’t tell Li Yao where his seat was, the Zola restaurant was only so big. Li Yao had also paid special attention to the direction Tang Yitian was walking in from the bathroom door, so it was still easy to find him.

......

Tang Yitian didn’t take the coincidental meeting to heart. After he returned to his seat, he was still in a good mood, chatting with Xia ruofei and Feng Jing.

Jennifer’s standard of Chinese was not bad, just that her spoken language was a little bad, but she had no problem with normal communication. She also especially liked to use idioms, although sometimes they were not used accurately, but they often produced a very funny effect.

Feng Rao also took the opportunity to ask Tang Yitian about business, and Tang Yitian naturally told her everything he knew.

Therefore, the atmosphere at the table was quite relaxed and cheerful.

Tang Yitian was talking to Xia ruofei about paradise corporation’s abalone auction when he saw Li Yao’s group of three walking toward them. He couldn’t help but frown.

Xia ruofei and Feng Jing’s backs were facing Li Yao and the other two. In order to ensure privacy, the backseats were designed to be very high. Therefore, they did not know that Li Yao, Dong Xinyu, and Fang Hongli were walking over. Of course, Li Yao and the other two naturally could not see Xia ruofei and Feng Jing.

“Mr. Tang, Mrs. Tang!” Li Yao no longer had the slight sense of superiority he had in front of Dong Xinyu. With a warm smile on his face, he said,”let’s have a toast!”

Although Tang Yitian didn’t really like Li Yao’s behavior, he still smiled and said,””You’re too kind, boss li!”

Then, Tang Yitian picked up the glass.

Li Yao was overjoyed to see this. Just as he was about to introduce Dong Xinyu to Tang Yitian and Jennifer, he heard Dong Xinyu let out a scream beside him ...
