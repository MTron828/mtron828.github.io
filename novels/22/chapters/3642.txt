One of them used a walkie – talkie to inform the people inside the farm, while the other drove Xia ruofei into the farm in a battery – powered car.

Xia ruofei arrived at the man – made lakeside villa. Liang Qichao and Jennifer had already walked out of the villa and were waiting at the door.

“It’s pretty good! I went to the Hunter Valley to see him a week ago!” Tang Yitian smiled and said,”he can walk now! 1 recommended him a very good rehabilitation specialist and he’ll stay in Paradise Farm until he goes through rehabilitation training.”

“That’s very thoughtful of you, brother Tang!” Xia ruofei said as he bowed slightly.

“The specialist looked at Xiao Liang’s medical records and understood that such a serious injury was actually treated with pure Chinese medicine. He was full of praise for Chinese medicine and kept exclaiming ‘amazes’!” Tang Yitian laughed and said,”as the saying goes, it takes a hundred days to recover from a bone injury. Xiao Liang has such a serious comminuted fracture, but he can walk in just over a month. No one would believe it if they told them!”

“Our country’s Chinese medicine is still very magical!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Of course!” “The first time we met, you used your magical medical skills to save Haoran’s life. It also opened up a deeper and deeper fate between you and our family!” Tang Yitian said.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”actually, it’s not entirely the effect of Chinese medicine!” Whether it’s Haoran’s situation or brother Liang’s injury treatment this time, in addition to Traditional Chinese Medicine, there are also some methods of cultivators. Otherwise, the effect wouldn’t be so immediate!”

Tang Yitian nodded with a smile,””Ruofei, let’s talk about the foundation! Now, the Holy Dragon Foundation has secretly taken control of the mining industry under the name of the former Galini family…”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”please spare me, big brother Tang. 1 don’t know the details and I’m not interested in it at all. You and Steve are just two people. Galini can master it himself, there’s no need to tell me too much …” “Those are all your assets …” Tang Yitian forced a smile. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“I didn’t want it either!” Said Xia ruofei as he spread his hands.

“Alright, alright, alright!” Tang Yitian said,”then I’ll tell you roughly! In addition to secretly controlling most of the Galiny family’s physical industries, the Holy Dragon Foundation also controlled a huge sum of money. The amount that kalini had transferred in through complicated secret operations was about 20 billion Australian dollars. According to our previous plan, the Holy Dragon Foundation will set up a special charity fund and inject no less than loo million Australian dollars annually for charity! Besides … The Galini family was also involved in illegal businesses such as arms and drugs, Steve. “Kalini has already begun to slowly reduce its business, but it’s not easy to completely cut off these industries. It’s also easy to arouse the rebellious mentality of those desperadoes below…”

“So, what do you all mean?” Xia ruofei asked.

“I wonder if you can make a move and directly wipe out a portion of them with thunderous means!” Tang Yitian’s eyes also revealed a trace of fierceness.”Those people all deserved to die. They could be said to be the accomplices and lackeys of the kalini family. Each and every one of them had their hands stained with blood!”

“A small matter!” Xia ruofei said casually,”as long as I can confirm the target, 1 will make my move.”

“That’s great!” Tang Yitian said happily,”if we don’t use any thunderous means, it’ll be Steve. Galini doesn’t even have a good way to deal with it, it’s already too big to deal with!”

“Also … There’s one more thing that 1 need you to do personally,” Tang Yitian continued.

“What’s the matter?” Xia ruofei asked.

“The Holy Dragon Foundation has a huge amount of assets and funds under its control. The first batch of staff selected to work for the foundation is now stretched thin.” Tang Yitian said,”we’re going to set up a charity fund soon. We’ll need a lot of manpower.” Hence, the urgent problem now was to add more people to the Holy Dragon Foundation. And the Golden Foundation is so special. If someone were to enter… You know what 1 mean!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I understand!” I understand! Let’s divide the work and cooperate. Big brother Tang, you choose the people, and I’ll personally check!”

“That’s great!” Tang Yitian said happily,”this way, 1 can use my people with ease!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Big brother Tang, if you don’t have anything urgent to do for the time being, I’m going to the Hunter Valley First.”

“You’re going to check on Liang Qichao?” Tang Yitian asked with a smile.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.’Tll help you to the end. Since I’ve taken over his treatment, I’ll be responsible to the end.”

“Alright! We’ll keep in touch!” “Do you need me to send you a car?” Tang Yitian asked.

“I can go by myself!” Xia ruofei smiled.

“I’m just asking. Which airboat do you take? we’ll arrive there in the blink of an eye!” Tang Yitian said enviously,”it’s not that convenient to take a car!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”big brother Tang! In the future, Haoran will take you flying!”

“I can only count on him!” Tang Yitian said with a smile.

Xia ruofei had lunch at Tang Yitian’s house and left the manor. He boarded the black Phoenix flying ship and flew in the direction of the Hunter Valley.

After a while, Xia ruofei arrived at the small town where Paradise Farm was located. He found a secluded place to land the flying boat, then walked through the town to Paradise Farm.

After more than a month, Paradise Farm was still on high alert.

However, the security guards already knew Xia ruofei, so they did not reject him this time. Once they saw him, they quickly welcomed him in.

One of them used a walkie – talkie to inform the people inside the farm, while the other drove Xia ruofei into the farm in a battery – powered car.

Xia ruofei arrived at the man – made lakeside villa. Liang Qichao and Jennifer had already walked out of the villa and were waiting at the door.
