The astral beast that had fought with Xia ruofei was also trapped in the formation. As it was the one who had called its partner over to seek revenge, it was also the one who charged the fiercest. Correspondingly, it was also the one who was the deepest in the formation.

This Star Beast had been accidentally injured by its companion just now. It was caught off guard and its back was ruthlessly clawed by another star Beast. Although star beasts had rough skin and thick flesh, the attack from a Star Beast was also very heavy, so it had suffered a lot this time. The softest part of its waist had been scratched open, and blood gushed out.

The astral beast roared in anger. It stomped its two hooves on the ground and charged into the mist as fast as lightning.

At this moment, it had already lost its mind and wanted to use brute force to break the formation.

At this moment, Xia ruofei used a seal to activate part of the array’s function. A black light flashed through the fog and shot straight at the Star Beast.

The astral beast had lost its mind, and at the same time, it was in the fog with extremely low visibility, so its ability to sense danger had been greatly reduced. In addition, the black light was silent, so it was completely unaware of it and was directly hit by the black light from the side.

With a bang, the black light disappeared into the Star Beast’s body.

The Star Beast’s forward – charging figure suddenly froze. Then, it let out a shrill scream, and a finger – sized hole appeared on its body.

The attack of the formation was not limited to this. After the black light hit the body of the Star Beast, the glossy fur on the Star Beast’s body suddenly burst into flames. It rolled on the ground in pain, causing the nearby weeds and shrubs to fall. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Although the Star Beast kept rolling on the ground, the flames were like maggots in its bones. Not only did they not extinguish, but they also grew stronger and stronger, and the smell of roasted meat even filled the air.

Xia ruofei, who was standing outside the formation, was amazed. He could basically tell that these star beasts were man – made puppets. However, they were extremely realistic. The materials used to make these star beasts even had the smell of roasted meat after burning ...

After a while, the Star Beast’s screams gradually weakened, and finally, there was no more sound.

It would never have thought that it would bring its companions to encircle Xia ruofei in such a menacing manner, only to catch a glimpse of Xia ruofei’s back and then lose its life in this formation.

When the astral beast finally quieted down, Xia ruofei’s perceptual mirror finally showed a change in the mission progress. It was 1/100.

Xia ruofei was overjoyed. Although it had been a long time since he had entered the second floor of the Tower of Trials, it was still a good start.

Moreover, the remaining 15 star beasts in the formation were also in deep trouble. It was only a matter of time before they became Xia ruofei’s number on the mission progress.

Almost at the same time that the first Star Beast was attacked, the other star beasts were also attacked by the terrifying black light.

Some were lucky enough to avoid the attack, but most of the star beasts were not spared. The only difference was that some of the star beasts were directly penetrated by the black light, while some only had a few scratches.

Of course, the result would be the same. The most terrifying attack of the black light was not the penetrating injury, but the inextinguishable flames that would erupt after coming into contact with the Star Beast.

Therefore, even the star beasts that had their skin scratched were ignited in flames after a short time.

This flame looked a little pale, but it was extremely hot. Most importantly, no matter how the star beasts rolled on the ground or crazily rubbed against the tree stump, it was of no use. One star Beast was even lucky and directly rolled into a small pool, but it still couldn’t change its fate of being burned to death.

The Star Beast’s body was in the water, but even so, the flames were still burning under the water, as if it didn’t need any oxygen to support it.

In this round, a total of ten astral beasts were hit by this sudden attack. The mission progress in Xia ruofei’s perception mirror had become 10/100.

The remaining six star beasts were like birds startled by the mere twang of a bow, and they were running around in circles like headless flies.

This formation only blocked the line of sight. At the same time, it used some mysterious formation patterns to create an illusion for the targets inside the formation. They thought that they were moving in a straight line, but in fact, they were running around in circles.

However, the formation did not isolate sound.

Therefore, the six surviving star beasts could clearly hear the terrifying screams of the other star beasts inside the array.

As a result, they were naturally even more nervous, because no one knew when the disaster would suddenly befall them, and then they would die in screams like their companions in front of them.

However, they didn’t dare to charge out, and they were also worried that they would trigger a more powerful formation, making it even more difficult to escape.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei didn’t let them struggle for too long. He made a hand seal and controlled the array again.

The formation’s attack was so powerful because, on one hand, it was very intricately designed. On the other hand, there was enough spiritual Qi to support Xi Jue in killing the ten star beasts. Xia ruofei had also paid the price of a hundred spiritual stones.

However, considering how difficult it was to deal with the Star Beast and how important the mission was, it was worth it to use these 100 spirit stones.
