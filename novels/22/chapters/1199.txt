Chapter 1200: Chapter 737 – no destruction, no construction (1)

Translator: 549690339

A small shovel truck was uprooting the lush grape trees in the vineyard of West Winery.

Old West and Xia ruofei stood together on the hill. He looked at the lively vineyard and thought that the bigger Golden Oak winery was the same. His heart ached and the flesh on his face trembled.

Xia ruofei’s mood was the exact opposite. There was no construction without destruction. The destruction in front of him was for the sake of revitalizing the winery in the future. It was as if he could see the “peach blossom grapes” that he had improved in the spirit map space growing prosperously in the winery.

“Uncle Carter, stop looking!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I brought some good tea from China. I’ll make it for you to try!”

Old West smiled bitterly. Out of sight, out of mind. He could only nod in resignation. He looked back at the vineyard and left with Xia ruofei.

After returning to the vintage – looking winery, Xia ruofei retrieved a small box of Da Hong Pao and a small purple clay tea set from his car. In fact, these items were stored in the storage space. However, it did not seem logical to carry a tea set with him, so Xia ruofei made up the illusion that they were stored in the car.

In a short while, the room was filled with the fragrance of tea.

Old West, who had been a little depressed, couldn’t help but get excited when he smelled the unique aroma. Even Auntie Capella, who had been busy behind the bar counter, was attracted by the rich aroma of tea.

“Boss, is this the tea from China? It smells so good!” Old West couldn’t help but exclaim in admiration before he even tasted it.

Xia ruofei’s action of brewing tea was very skillful. His movements were like floating clouds and flowing water. In addition, he was a cultivator with a good cultivation base, and his every move was in accordance with the way of nature, so the action of making tea was even more pleasing to the eye. Even the foreigners who were completely ignorant of the industry couldn’t help but be attracted.

Auntie Kelly also sat down and said with a smile,””Xia, from the way you brew tea, I seem to see the thousand – year – old culture of your ancient China ...”

Xia ruofei raised his head and smiled gently in the mist.””Then, please have a taste of our country’s drink!”

With that, Xia ruofei pushed the two cups of freshly brewed tea in front of the two of them. Then, he picked up a small teacup and brought it to his mouth. He gently blew on it and took a small sip.

Mr. And Mrs. West followed suit and took a sip of the tea.

“How is it?” Xia ruofei asked. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Old West’s brows furrowed for a moment before relaxing. He savored the taste and said,””The taste is a little bitter. I wasn’t used to it at first, but after the aftertaste, my mouth is full of fragrance. China’s tea drinks are indeed very magical. No wonder they are so popular all over the world!”

After tasting it, Auntie Capella also had a lot of words of praise.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”thank you for your praise!” Uncle Carter, Auntie kabeli, this box of tea leaves and this tea set are for you. I hope you can fall in love with the Chinese tea culture from now on!”

The workmanship of this set of purple clay teapot was very exquisite. Whether it was the materials, craftsmanship, shape, or other aspects, they were all top – grade. The most important thing was that it was full of traditional Chinese characteristics, which was often an irresistible temptation for foreigners.

As expected, Old West immediately revealed a surprised and happy expression.””Oh! This was a precious gift! Boss, thank you very much for your generosity!”

“Xia! You’re such a generous and friendly boss!” Auntie Kelly also put her arm around Xia ruofei’s shoulder affectionately and said,”I’ll go make you something delicious!”

“Thank you, Auntie!” Xia ruofei turned around and smiled.

After Madam kabeli left, Xia ruofei said to Old West,””Uncle Carter, I know that you can’t accept my decision to uproot the old Grape Tree today. But please believe me, it won’t take long for you to know how correct my decision is!”

After Old West accepted Xia ruofei’s gift, he was too embarrassed to keep a straight face. He sighed helplessly and said,””I hope you’re right! Boss, otherwise ... Our losses would be huge ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded,”I know how you feel about the winery, so I won’t make an impulsive decision.” Don’t worry, you won’t be disappointed!”

At this point, Old West could only trust Xia ruofei. What was done was done.

With the West couple’s passionate invitation, Xia ruofei stayed at the winery for half a day. After lunch, he was ready to drive back to Paradise Farm.

Mr. And Mrs. West personally sent Xia ruofei to the yard. Xia ruofei stood beside the car, opened the door and closed it. He turned around and said,””Uncle Carter, in addition to cleaning up the vineyard today, don’t forget to gather enough skilled manpower. I’ll send the grape seedlings to you tomorrow morning. I hope we can finish the planting work quickly.”

“Don’t worry!”Old West nodded. I’ve already made arrangements ...”

Xia ruofei nodded and waved at the old couple after he got into the car. He then stepped on the gas and drove away from West Winery.
