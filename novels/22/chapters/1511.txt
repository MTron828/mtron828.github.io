Chapter 1512: Breaking the array (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei’s guess was right. The complicated patterns on the smooth stone wall were an array, and it was a rather advanced array.

With Xia ruofei’s current level of array Dao, he could not figure it out at all, let alone solve it.

The little white Beastie cried out a few times and stretched out its front legs to gesture at the stone wall.

“You want me to break this formation?” Xia ruofei asked, half confused.

The little white beast could actually understand Xia ruofei’s words. It immediately nodded like a chicken pecking at rice. However, it was so small that it looked like a miniature civet cat. It was very cute to do such a human – like action.

“Is there a great benefit to you in undoing this formation?” Xia ruofei was confused again.

The little white beast nodded even more frequently, and a sense of urgency could be seen in its eyes.

Xia ruofei jokingly said,”but what good does that do me?” I’m in a hurry to find my friend! Where would I find the time to help you break the formation?”

With that, Xia ruofei made a gesture to leave. The little white beast saw this and quickly ran over to bite the bottom of Xia ruofei’s pants. Its eyes revealed a pleading look, and at the same time, it barked and gestured at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei could barely understand what it meant and asked,””You’re saying that I’ll benefit a lot from cracking the formation?”

“Ji ji ji!” The little white beast nodded repeatedly.

Actually, Xia ruofei’s decision to leave was half true and half false. On one hand, he was really worried about Song Wei’s safety and wanted to find her quickly. On the other hand, he was also very curious about this stone wall as this formation was not simple. Most importantly, the sensing Jade Leaf hanging on his chest was burning frighteningly. This meant that if he could break the formation, he might be able to find the world stone he needed.

Instead of leaving the mysterious stone wall alone and searching for Song Wei cluelessly, it was better to try and see if he could solve this formation.

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei nodded and said,””Then I’ll try! However, I can’t take too long. If I really can’t crack it, I can only tell you that it’s a pity! I lost my friend and I have to find her as soon as possible. ”

The little white beast nodded and gestured at the stone wall a few more times.

Xia ruofei’s expression turned serious and he asked urgently,””You’re saying that if I break the formation, I might be able to find my friend?”

The little white beast shook its head and gestured as it called out. However, Xia ruofei did not understand what it meant.

However, he could tell from the little white beast that if he wanted to find Song Wei’s whereabouts, it would be best for him to undo this array first.

Regardless of whether the little white beast was telling the truth or not, Xia ruofei had already decided to stay and try it out. Hence, he did not hesitate and immediately focused his attention on the stone wall.

The lines on the stone wall crisscrossed, and dazzling light spots swam quickly on the lines, looking more beautiful than computer special effects.

When Xia ruofei’s spiritual power covered it, he immediately felt that the complexity of the array was on the level of hell.

After cracking the earth jade talisman, Xia ruofei had specially studied the array Dao. The array Dao books that could be sealed in the Jade talisman were undoubtedly the best of the best. There were many classic array patterns in these books, but in terms of complexity, none of the classic examples that Xia ruofei had seen could be compared to the array patterns on the stone wall.

Xia ruofei tried to analyze the nodes of the array pattern one by one. At first, he felt that he was getting an idea. However, as the number of nodes increased, he began to come to a completely different and contradictory conclusion. All the previous analysis seemed to have been useless.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile bitterly. He rubbed his temples. He couldn’t help but feel helpless in the face of this array.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but say,”I don’t believe this!” How can there be an Unbreakable Formation?”

After a short rest, he focused his attention on the stone wall.

The little white beast lay quietly on the ground, its eyes looking at Xia ruofei from time to time with a hint of anticipation.

Xia ruofei overcame his impetuous state of mind and gave up on the idea of taking a shortcut. He began to focus on studying this complicated array.

He started to analyze the formation from its most basic structure, from the function and principle of each formation pattern, and then slowly assembled more formation patterns.

Soon, he was immersed in the wondrous world of arrays, even forgetting the passage of time.

Xia ruofei had entered a very mysterious state. He did not even realize that in such a Deep State, his array Dao level was also increasing unconsciously.

“Reverse five elements ... Nesting ... Kun position shift ...” Xia ruofei mumbled as he analyzed.

The little white beast had been waiting quietly the entire time. Xia Qing, who was in the spirit map space, seemed to have realized that Xia ruofei was fully focused on analyzing the formation, so she also remained silent.

They had already cleared out all the puppets on their way here, so no puppets came out to interrupt Xia ruofei’s comprehension.

Time passed silently. Ten minutes, twenty minutes, one hour, two hours...A whole four hours had passed. Xia ruofei did not even move a single step. Other than his pair of quick – witted eyes turning from time to time, he stood in front of the stone wall like a statue without moving an inch.

Unknowingly, the formation on the stone wall became clearer and clearer in Xia ruofei’s eyes.

Those seemingly messy and complicated array patterns also gradually became organized.

He had to admit that the array knowledge he had obtained from the earth character jade talisman was extremely precious. Perhaps the array techniques involved were not as advanced as the array techniques on the stone wall, but it had made Xia ruofei’s array Foundation extremely solid.

It was on this solid foundation that Xia ruofei had the capital to analyze the formation. Otherwise, even if he looked at it for a hundred years, he would not be able to see the hidden meaning.

Xia ruofei’s eyes brightened. He even started to simulate the formation in his mind.

The great Dao was simple.

After analyzing the essence of those complicated array patterns, everything seemed to become simple.

After more than five hours, Xia ruofei finally moved.

His eyes were filled with confidence as he took a step forward to the stone wall and pressed his hand on it.

The little white beast couldn’t help but close its eyes, as if it couldn’t bear to look.

It had tried many times, but it couldn’t even touch the stone wall. As long as it got close enough, it would be blocked by the array.

This formation was like a mirror. If one tried to break it with brute force, the backlash would be very strong, and the little white beast had even been injured by it.

It felt that Xia ruofei would definitely suffer if he went up so rashly.

However, it did not hear Xia ruofei’s screams. The surroundings were still silent. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The little white beast couldn’t help but open its eyes in curiosity, and a look of disbelief appeared on its face.

Xia ruofei’s hand had already passed through the layer of brilliant array runes and entered the array directly. It was as if there was no obstruction as he pressed it against the stone wall.

The little white beast’s eyes lit up and it stared at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei’s hand turned into a finger and quickly drew on the stone wall. Genuine Qi passed through his fingertips to the stone wall, forming a pattern that looked like flowing light.

These flowing light runes quickly merged into the original runes, and in an instant, the runes on the entire stone wall emitted a dazzling light. The little white beast couldn’t help but squint its eyes.

Streams of light flew quickly through the formation patterns. The light on the surface of the stone wall became brighter and brighter. The light kept accelerating, and finally, the formation patterns could no longer be seen clearly. The seven colors on the surface of the stone wall began to merge and converge.

Xia ruofei finally showed a satisfied smile. He easily retracted his hand.

This was the first time he had cracked a complicated array in the truest sense of the word. Although he did not realize that his array skills had advanced another level in the short few hours, the sense of achievement from cracking such a high level of array was still incomparable.

After the seven – colored flowing light on the surface of the stone wall completely gathered together, a crack appeared in the middle of the stone wall. Then, the stone wall split into two and slowly opened to both sides. The crack grew bigger and bigger.

The little white beast let out a cry of joy, and its body flickered as it entered the crack.

Unfortunately, joy begets sorrow. The seven – colored light was like a tough protective shield, and after the little white beast crashed into it, it was as if it had hit a trampoline. It immediately bounced back at an even faster speed, and then heavily crashed into the mountain wall behind it.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh when he saw this. He said,””Little fellow, you can’t eat hot tofu if you’re impatient! The formation hasn’t been fully activated yet!”

The little white beast squeaked twice, and a depressed look appeared in its eyes.

Xia ruofei was very fond of this intelligent little white beast. He smiled and walked over to stroke its smooth fur.””Are you hurt?”

The little white beast raised its head with a proud look on its face. Then, it shook its head again, as if to say,”how could I be injured by such a powerful impact?”

Xia ruofei laughed. He carried the little white beast and walked to the stone wall.

The little white beast was also very close to Xia ruofei and did not reject his embrace. It just looked at the hole in the stone wall with a trace of eagerness.

Finally, both sides of the stone wall had disappeared into the mountain walls. Xia ruofei shot out a stream of vital energy towards the colorful light and accurately hit a node of the formation pattern.

Then, the seven – colored light burst like a soap bubble, turning into spots of light and disappearing into the air.

As soon as the protective light barrier was broken, Xia ruofei immediately felt the sensory Jade Leaf in front of his chest tremble.

The little white beast couldn’t wait to get out of his arms. Its body shot out like lightning, and in the blink of an eye, it rushed into the hole.

Xia ruofei couldn’t wait any longer and quickly followed.

It was not a big cave and it looked ordinary. However, when Xia ruofei stepped into the cave, he could not help but feel invigorated. At the same time, he revealed a look of disbelief ...
