That batch of wormgrass was of extremely high quality, and Mr. Lin had been eyeing it since then.

This time, when he called to talk about changing the contract, he finally couldn’t help but ask about aweto.

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. After a moment of silence, he said,””I do have some, but not much ...”

Xia Qing had already worked overtime to harvest the aweto in the spirit map space, but there were too many of them, so the efficiency had not been very high.

A conservative estimate was that it would take at least more than a month to harvest all the wormgrass, and now it was estimated that not even half was harvested.

As for President Lin, once he heard that there was stock, why would he care about how much? He was overjoyed and said,”director Xia, no matter how many there are, Tongren Hall will take care of them all!” The purchase price will definitely satisfy you, and it will not be lower than any other price! You’ve got to keep it well for me!”

“No problem! I’ve already told you!” Xia ruofei said,”don’t worry! No one’s going to fight with you ...”

“Hehe ... That’s good, that’s good!” President Lin smiled and said,”President Xia, I’ll come to San Shan as soon as possible! I’ll check if there are any more flights to Sanshan today ...”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”President Lin, there’s no hurry! I didn’t even have time to prepare when you rushed over!”

He had been busy discussing the acquisition with bojun real estate for the next two days. How could he have the time to entertain President Lin?

Moreover, Xia Qing could also harvest more aweto a few days later. Since he was going to sell it to Tongren Hall, the more the better.

When the time came to acquire the assets of bojun real estate, he would need funds as well, and Mr. Lin’s arrival was timely.

“Then ...” President Lin’s heart was like a cat’s claw.”President Xia, when will you be ready?”

“Two or three days!” Xia ruofei said,”chief Lin, I’ll call you as soon as I’m ready!”

“Alright, President Xia, you must remember to save it for us!” President Lin said worriedly,”no matter how much other people buy it for, we promise to be 10% more expensive than their price!”

“Alright, alright, alright!” Xia ruofei found it funny.”Let’s talk about the price when we meet. You have an experienced appraiser, so you can just give an objective price!”

“Alright, alright, alright. Thank you in advance, President Xia!” President Lin said.

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei raised his hand to look at his watch. He realized that it was already past the time to get off work. Hence, he picked up his bag and tucked it under his arm. He went straight to the staff canteen on the first floor for lunch.

In the afternoon, Xia ruofei did not go to work on time. He went back to the small villa to take a nap after lunch.

Of course, he didn’t deliberately make things difficult for bojun real estate. At around 3:15 am, he leisurely walked to the general office building.

What surprised Xia ruofei was that there were already a few cars parked by the side of the building. Needless to say, the people from bojun real estate must have arrived.

“You’re early enough!” Xia ruofei muttered to himself.

As expected, once Xia ruofei went upstairs, he saw Liu Qian waiting at the door of his office.

“They’re here?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Yes, I am!” Liu Qian said,”I have already arranged for them to rest in the guest room. President Feng is accompanying them.”

Xia ruofei opened the office door and said,””Alright, I got it! Get the administration department to prepare the meeting room in advance. I’ll be there at 3:30 sharp. ”

Although Xia ruofei did not plan to make things difficult for bojun real estate, he did not plan to start the negotiations early. Since they had agreed to start at 3:30, they would start at 3:30 sharp. The other party would not be able to argue with them.

“Alright!” Liu Qian replied.

After Xia ruofei entered the office, he began to wash the teacup unhurriedly. Then, he took out the Da Hong Pao produced by paradise Corporation and leisurely drank some tea.

Then, he used a floating cup that could filter tea leaves to make a large cup of Dahongpao tea. Seeing that it was almost time, he picked up the teacup and left the office.

In the meeting room, everyone had already taken their seats on both sides.

As for bojun real estate, Vice President Xu Jiahui was still the leader. They were basically the same people from a few days ago.

On the Paradise corporation’s side, in addition to Feng Jing and Liu Qian, who was in charge of records, the company’s Marketing Director, Xiao Qiang, and finance Director, pang Hao, were also present.

“I’m sorry, boss Xu,” Xia ruofei apologized as soon as he entered the room.”I’ve been too busy at the company. I’ve really neglected you ...”

On the other side, Feng Rao and the others were having a hard time holding it in and almost burst out laughing.

Xu Jiahui didn’t doubt him and quickly said politely,””Boss Li, you’re too kind. We’re the ones who’ve disturbed you ...”

Xia ruofei quickly walked to the middle seat and sat down.

As Xia ruofei had not arrived, Xu Jiahui had already thought of what to say. However, after Xia ruofei sat down, he turned to Liu Qian and said before Xu Jiahui could say anything,””Liu Qian, why are we serving Tieguanyin to President Xu and the others? Didn’t our company’s top – grade Da Hong Pao receive great reviews? Go get some and soak it. Let boss Xu and the others give their opinions! Oh right, I’ll get some for boss Xu and the rest later ...”

“Yes, Chairman!” Liu Qian quickly got up and went to make arrangements.

“President Xia, you don’t have to be so polite,” Xu Jiahui said quickly.

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”It’s just some tea leaves. They’re all family property. They’re not worth much ...”

“Then ... Thank you, President Xia.” Xu Jiahui said.

In fact, he didn’t want to talk so much nonsense and wanted to get to the main topic as soon as possible.

Unexpectedly, Xia ruofei immediately said,””Boss Xu, this is your first time at our farm, right? How do you feel?”

Xu Jiahui was stunned for a moment and said awkwardly,””Very good! It was ... A thriving place! And the environment is really good ...”

“Boss Xu, you think the environment is good too?” Xia ruofei said excitedly,”when I was planning the farm, I specifically emphasized that we must have a good internal environment, even if it means sacrificing some production space ...”

Xu Jiahui looked awkwardly at Xia ruofei, who was talking non – stop. He did not know how to interrupt him.

Feng Jing had already guessed Xia ruofei’s intention. She couldn’t help but turn to look at Xia ruofei with a smile in her eyes. This guy was really bad ...

Xu Jiahui finally found an opportunity for Xia ruofei to drink some tea when he was thirsty. He quickly said,””President Xia, let’s talk about the Hengli building first!”

He felt bitter in his heart. The boss of the Paradise Corporation never played by the rules. The last time they had a negotiation at the bojun building, he had gone straight to the point. The entire negotiation had lasted less than ten minutes before it broke down.

This time, they were only given an hour. Not only that, Xia ruofei came in on time and started to ramble as soon as he entered. He did not say anything about the serious matter and almost ten minutes had passed.

There was even less time left for negotiations.

Xu Jiahui had more or less understood Xia ruofei’s style. He knew that at 4:30, this guy would definitely get up and leave without hesitation.

He even suspected that Xia ruofei was just wasting his time.

If it was in the past, Xu Jiahui would definitely not be willing to deal with such a difficult opponent. However, the company’s situation was not optimistic. He knew that he would be cut, but he could only bite the bullet.

Xia ruofei put down his teacup slowly and said,”Boss Xu, the matter about Hengli building is not complicated at all. The price I gave you last time was actually very sincere ...”

Xu Jiahui forced a smile and said,”we have no doubt about the sincerity of the peach blossom company’s cooperation. That’s why we took the initiative to come and discuss this. However, President Xia, 320 million is really too little. The value of our assets is right there. Even if we give you a certain discount, it can’t be so ridiculously low.”

“But I think the price you guys quoted before coming here was too high.” Xia ruofei said indifferently,” 380 million. Boss Xu, you can go out and ask around. Who would be willing to take over at such a high price at this time?”

As soon as Xia ruofei said this, Xu Jiahui’s heart suddenly sank ...
