3085 A freak combination of factors (1)

Chen Nanfeng raised his eyebrows and asked,””What’s the situation?”

“When I left the sect that day, I happened to see young sect leader sending him out of the mountain Gate, so I followed him from a distance ...” The Man in Black said respectfully.

“You followed him?” Chen Nanfeng’s expression changed slightly as he said,”ah ning, you’re a little reckless. We’re not even sure if he has the rumored nascent Soul Stage expert behind him! If he finds out that you’ve been following him ...”

“Sect leader, Xia ruofei’s cultivation is only at the beginning stage of the Golden elixir realm. I followed him very far. Even if his spiritual power was more than half of an early stage golden elixir realm cultivator ‘s, it would still be hard to notice.” The Man in Black said,”and I’m sure that he didn’t notice me. He didn’t show any signs of abnormality along the way and didn’t use his spiritual power to check the back.”

Chen Nanfeng waved his hand and said,”don’t be so sure. This young man gives me the feeling that he’s a bit of a demon. Maybe he’s discovered you, but he just didn’t make a sound ... Let’s not talk about this first. Let’s talk about what you found out!”

“Yes!” The Man in Black said,”he flew on his sword in the direction of the star Seizer sect for a while. After he was far away from our Mountain Gate, he stopped and took out a flying boat ...”

“Airboat!” Chen Nanfeng was a little moved. He could not help but sit up straight and asked,”are you sure he took out an airboat?”

“I’m very sure!” The Man in Black said,”it’s a pure black flying boat. It’s even size than our jadewater flying boat. In addition ... I tried to keep following them, but I soon lost them because the speed of that flying boat was much faster than sword riding, and also much faster than our blue water flying boat! I feel that ... Even if the sect leader were to go personally, he might not be able to catch up to this flying boat!”

Chen Nanfeng revealed a thoughtful expression and said,””Since it’s so fast, it must be an airboat. In today’s cultivation world, only this kind of ancient flying treasure can reach such a speed!”

“Yes, I am!” The black – robed man replied,”after I lost him, I did not continue to the star Seizer sect. However, that flying ship is indeed heading straight for the star Seizer sect. ”

Chen Nanfeng muttered to himself for a while before saying,””Ah ning, do you still remember the records of a primordial soul Stage expert in the history of the Star Seizer sect?”

The Man in Black was stunned for a moment, then he asked with uncertainty,””Sect leader, are you talking about Daoist Chi Yun?”

Chen Nanfeng nodded and said,”it seems like you’ve thought of it.” The sect’s ancient records have recorded that Daoist Chi Yun’s flying magic treasure was a black flying ship called the black Phoenix. A few hundred years ago, this Black Phoenix flying ship was extremely famous in the cultivation world!”

The Man in Black revealed a look of disbelief and said,””You’re saying that Xia ruofei might be Daoist Chi Yun’s successor? This ... This seems a little ... Sect leader, Daoist Chi Yun is a figure from five hundred years ago. There has never been any news of him in the past few hundred years, so how could such a young successor suddenly appear?”

Chen Nanfeng revealed a trace of fascination and said,””Senior Chi Yun is a primordial soul Stage cultivator. Furthermore, he reached the primordial soul Stage over five hundred years ago. If there are no accidents, it’s not strange that he’s still alive in this era. The powers of an immortal soul Stage cultivator are beyond our imagination ...”

In the current cultivation world, the nascent Soul Stage was already a heavenly chasm. As for the primordial soul Stage, it was a realm that no one dared to think about.

Chen Nanfeng continued,”if Xia ruofei is senior Chi Yun’s successor, then everything makes sense ... If senior Chi Yun was still alive, his cultivation might have already reached the leaving aperture stage or even higher. For such an expert, there’s basically no need for an airboat. It’s only normal for him to give it to his disciple. Furthermore, if this Xia ruofei was senior Chi Yun’s successor, then the star Seizer sect’s sect master Luo Qingfeng’s attitude towards him was very reasonable! According to seniority, Luo Qingfeng was only his disciple’s disciple! “Of course, we have to be respectful to him ... Besides, it’s very likely that Xia ruofei has been cultivating under senior Chi Yun since he was young. It’s only three years ago that senior Chi Yun allowed him to gradually come into contact with the world of cultivation after he had some success in his cultivation. As for the company he set up in the secular world, it’s very likely that it’s just a part of his experience in the mortal world ...”

The black – robed man also revealed a thoughtful expression, then said,””Sect leader, now that you’ve mentioned it, it seems that the possibility is quite high! This means that Xia ruofei’s background ... Is much more powerful than we thought!” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“No matter how powerful his background is, it doesn’t affect us much.” Even if he was senior Scarlet cloud’s successor, senior Scarlet cloud would not be able to help him with everything. If that was the case, there would be no use in gaining experience, and he would not be able to walk far on the path of cultivation. I reckon that if our guess is correct, then senior Chi Yun is at most protecting him in the dark. Moreover, he will only act when he is truly in a life and death situation. The first heaven society has no ill intentions towards him, and we don’t have the intention to kill him either. Therefore, whether or not he has senior Chi Yun or some other nascent soul senior behind him, it doesn’t matter much to us. “
