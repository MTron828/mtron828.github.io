Chapter 1476: I’ll help you say hello_2

Translator: 549690339

At this moment, a voice was heard,””Xu Yuanyuan, since your sister – in – Law is in a difficult situation, I’ll help you talk to her about this!”

It was Xia ruofei who spoke. He was chatting with Song Wei in the hotel lobby while waiting for Xu Yuanyuan.

Xia ruofei had seen everything just now. He had also heard the conversation between Yao na and Xu Yuanyuan.

Yao NA’s expression changed slightly. She frowned and said,””Why is it you guys again?”

“We’re paying to stay here. Is there a problem with that?” Xia ruofei said indifferently,”could it be that this kempnski belongs to your family? Even if it’s your house, can you chase your guests out?”

Yao na snorted and said,”you’re really sharp – tongued!” I’ve never seen someone as boastful as you, go and say hello! Do you know what Yuanyuan wants to do? You’re taking it all on!”

“Isn’t it just a postgraduate entrance examination?”Xia ruofei shrugged.

The commotion had alerted chief Wang, director Jiang, and the others. They were about to leave the hotel, but they stopped when they heard Xia ruofei’s words.

This was especially so for bureau chief Wang. A trace of displeasure appeared on his face. Yao na had asked him to handle this matter. He had just used a bunch of bureaucratic tone and said that the difficulty was very high, but this young man had played it down so easily. Wasn’t he deliberately slapping his face?

Director Jiang and director Wang walked over. Director Jiang said,””Young man, taking the postgraduate entrance examination isn’t an easy task. Every unit has different rules. Miss Yuan Yuan’s situation doesn’t meet the requirements!”

As for chief Wang, he glanced at Xia ruofei from the corner of his eyes. His face was dark and his eyes were cold.

Xia ruofei nodded and smiled.””Yup! If she met the requirements, she wouldn’t need to spend two months of her salary to treat you two to a meal. ”

“What do you mean by that?” chief Wang snorted. We’re greedy for her meal? What a joke!”

Director Jiang also frowned and asked,”little Yao, who are these two people?” You’re so irresponsible. If this gets out, people will think that chief Wang and I are here to cheat!”

Yao NA’s face turned pale. She had worked so hard to get into the good books of chief Jiang from the provincial Office. If chief Jiang bore a grudge because of Xia ruofei’s first sentence, then their days in the city’s Finance Bureau would be difficult.

“Director Jiang, chief Wang, these two are Yuanyuan’s University classmates. They’re from the countryside and don’t know anything. Please don’t take it to heart!” Yao na said hurriedly.

Then, Yao na glared at Xia ruofei and said coldly,””Apologize! Apologize to director Jiang and chief Wang immediately!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh and said,”apologize?” I was talking to Xu Yuanyuan, and you guys came to me, and now you want me to apologize?”

“You’re slandering the two leaders!” “Shouldn’t you apologize?” Yao na asked.

“What a joke!” Xia ruofei sneered.”Did I slander you? Is it not true that Xu Yuan Yuan is treating them to a meal?”

Then, Xia ruofei said to Song Wei,””Let’s go!”

Then, he looked at Yuan Yuan Xu and said,””You and Zhuang Yan should come too! Don’t worry, I won’t delay your postgraduate entrance examination!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Xu Yuan Yuan’s heart sank to the bottom. She knew that she had completely offended bureau chief Wang.

Not to mention that she didn’t meet the age limit, even if she met the requirements, it was impossible for the unit to approve her to take the exam.

Xu Yuanyuan thought to herself,”I didn’t expect Wei Wei’s boyfriend to be so aggressive when he looks so gentle and weak. I’m done for ...”

However, she and Zhuang Yan were kind people. They knew that Xia ruofei was speaking up for her. Even if things were ruined, they would not blame Xia ruofei.

Hearing Xia ruofei say that there was no problem with the postgraduate entrance examination, Xu Yuanyuan smiled bitterly. She felt that Xia ruofei was probably trying to save face.

Seeing that Xia ruofei was about to leave, Yao na was even more furious. She actually stopped Xia ruofei without caring about her image and said,””Don’t even think about running away before you make things clear!”

Zhuang Yan’s brother also said coldly,””I’ll give you a chance to apologize to the two leaders! Don’t forget, this is tan Zhou ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh and said to Song Wei,””Is he threatening me?”

“Probably!” Song Wei said with a smile.

Song Wei could not help but laugh when she thought of Xia ruofei, who was drinking and chatting with the top figure of xiangnan and was even an important guest of elder song, being threatened by a small official from the Tanzhou Financial Bureau.

Xia ruofei looked at Zhuang Cheng calmly and said,””I advise you to ask your wife to let go of me immediately. I don’t want to hit a woman!”

Yao na tightened her grip and said,””Hit me? Why don’t you try hitting me? Do you really think tan Zhou is your country?”

Director Jiang saw that many people had already looked over. As an official, he naturally paid great attention to his personal image, so he couldn’t help but frown.

“Alright!” Jiang said. Xiao Zhuang, Xiao Yao, let him go!”

Chief Wang also looked at Xia ruofei coldly and said to Yao na,””Since you have such a capable friend, I won’t meddle ...”

“That’s right!” Bureau chief Wang said coldly,”comrade Xu, remember to give me your account number. I’ll transfer the money for the meal to you, in case people say that I’m cheating you of your food and drink!”

Then, director Jiang and director Wang walked out.

Yao na and Zhuang Cheng were both dumbfounded.

He had offended both of them, and it was obvious that the two leaders were even blaming Zhuang Cheng and Yao na.

Bureau chief Wang didn’t mind. After all, the cultural Bureau wasn’t a real power unit, and it couldn’t control the two of them.

But director Jiang was the Deputy Director of the provincial Department! He was the leader of the higher unit in charge of their city’s Finance Bureau!

Yao NA’s expression turned ugly. She glared at Xu Yuanyuan and said coldly,””Xu Yuan Yuan, this is the result you wanted! In the future, Zhuang Cheng and I will have no future in the unit. Are you satisfied now?”

At this moment, director Jiang and director Wang, who had already taken a few steps, stopped at the same time and looked at the door.

Following the direction of their gazes, a middle – aged man with an extraordinary bearing was walking into the hotel lobby.

Xia ruofei and Song Wei also saw this person and could not help but smile.

It was song Zhengping’s Secretary, Cao Jin. Xia ruofei was going to call him about Xu Yuanyuan. Although it felt like overkill to ask the Secretary of the No. 1 Provincial Party Committee to handle such a trivial matter, he had no choice. Besides song Zhengping, the only other person Xia ruofei knew in Hunan Province was Secretary Cao. He could not ask song Zhengping to do it himself, could he?

Yao na naturally noticed the unusual behavior of director Jiang and director Wang. She couldn’t help but look over. She felt that Cao Jin looked familiar, but she couldn’t recall who he was.

“Zhuang Cheng, that man ...” Yao na couldn’t help but ask.

Zhuang Cheng was also thinking hard. Suddenly, his body trembled slightly and he said,””Nana, I think that’s ... Chief Cao from the Provincial Party Committee!”

“Chief Cao?” Yao na was stunned for a moment, but she immediately realized who he was.”Secretary song’s Secretary, director Cao?”

“It must be. Chief Jiang and chief Wang are already there!” Zhuang Cheng said.

Director Jiang and director Wang almost trotted over to greet him. Seeing Cao Jin speed up after glancing in their direction with a smile on his face, the two were even more excited.

It seems that chief Cao still remembers me! As the two of them thought about this, they reached out their hands from a distance.

However, what they did not expect was that Cao Jin did not even look at them and walked past them directly. Their hands were hanging in the air, and their faces were full of embarrassment.

At the same time, what made director Jiang and director Wang a little confused was that they clearly saw Cao Jin’s face become very humble, and his steps were obviously faster than normal.

Could chief Cao have met a higher – up? Could it be that Secretary song was also at the hotel?

As the two of them guessed, they turned their heads at the same time. What happened next completely petrified them, and they became motionless like statues ...
