“This is the magical power of nature,” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”jadeite is buried deep underground and formed after tens of millions of years ...”

As Xia ruofei and Song Wei chatted, they surreptitiously looked through most of the Jade. Naturally, he had a judgment in his heart. However, whether to sell it, which pieces to sell, and what price to use would all depend on the situation tomorrow morning.

Xia ruofei saw that Song Wei was not very interested in these things. After a quick walk around, he found Yu mingdong and told him about it. The two of them left the public Jade bid.

Since the hotel wasn’t too far away, the two of them decided to take a walk back and enjoy the scenery of the small border town.

Song Wei was in a good mood and was much more lively than before. She smiled and said to Xia ruofei as she walked,”Ruofei, you’re so lucky. Give me some pointers tomorrow. I’ll buy one to test my luck!”

“I thought you weren’t interested in this?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“I’m not interested in those stones!” “But I’m interested in money!” Song Wei said.

“Woof! I didn’t expect our miss song to be such a money – grubber!” Xia ruofei said.

“If he’s a money – grubber, so be it! Anyway, you have to help me pick one, and it has to be something that can make money!” Song Wei said,”my father is an honest and upright official. I don’t have much pocket money since I was young. This time, I have to earn a sum for myself!”

“You make it sound like you’re full of grudges ... I’ll go and criticize your Secretary song later.” Xia ruofei laughed.”Such a beautiful daughter should be raised well!”

“Come on!” Song Wei laughed. If you really met my dad, would you dare to say that?”

“What’s there to be afraid of?” Xia ruofei said,”if your father dares to glare at me, I’ll ask elder song to back me up!”

“You’re amazing! You’re amazing, okay!” Song Wei said,”remember! Help me pick one tomorrow!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“No problem!” Xia ruofei said lazily,”but I can’t guarantee that I’ll be able to make money. Even the gods can’t tell an inch of Jade. No one can be 100% sure ...”

“How about ... I’ll pay for the profit and you’ll pay for the loss?” Song Wei said slyly.

“There’s such a function?” Xia ruofei said,”aren’t you being too overbearing?”

“Who asked you to be a big nouveau riche!” Song Wei whispered into Xia ruofei’s ear,”you said you were going to treat my soul, but you still went to stone gambling and earned tens of millions ... You’re really something!”

Xia ruofei smiled awkwardly and said,””Alright, alright, alright. If you lose, it’s on me!”

The reason he went to the public Jade bid was to collect Jade materials to upgrade his space. His purpose was to save song Wei.

However, he had told Song Wei that he was looking for a medicinal herb in Ruizhou. Under the circumstances of not exposing the spirit map space, Xia ruofei naturally could not explain further.

The two of them walked all the way back to the hotel, which took about 40 to 50 minutes.

The raw stones on the public Jade bid were still open for display at night. Yu mingdong seemed to be preparing to burn the midnight oil. Hence, Xia ruofei brought Song Wei to a nearby restaurant to try the local delicacies.

After dinner, Song Wei went to Xia ruofei’s room and they cultivated for a few more hours in the time formation.

However, Xia ruofei reminded Song Wei not to try to break through easily. She should let nature take its course so that her Foundation would be more solid.

Therefore, after this round of training, Song Wei’s true Qi had become more solid, but she still had not broken through to Qi disciple Level 2.

If Xia ruofei wanted to, Song Wei could cultivate for one to two months or even longer in one night, even if she did not use the time to go to the toilet and wash up.

But Xia ruofei did not do so.

Firstly, Song Wei’s cultivation was going very smoothly. Even without the help of the time formation, she could complete the first level of the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” in a short time.

Secondly, Xia ruofei did not want Song Wei to use the time formation too much. Although it would not affect her much if she aged one or two months more than the outside world, he felt that it was better not to use external forces. This way, Song Wei would realize how difficult it was to cultivate and would not become dependent on the time formation.

Hence, after a few hours of cultivation, Xia ruofei kept the array flags and persuaded Song Wei to go back to her room to rest.

The next morning, Xia ruofei and the others arrived at the public Jade bid.

On the way, Yu mingdong also asked Xia ruofei indirectly. He still believed in Xia ruofei’s luck and hoped to know which raw stones Xia ruofei had a better view of.

Although Xia ruofei had a good impression of Yu mingdong, he was naturally tight – lipped at this time. Not to mention the fact that the two might be competitors, Xia ruofei could not say much from the perspective of confidentiality. Otherwise, if the raw stones he picked this time rose sharply again, it could not be explained by luck.

After they arrived at the public Jade bid, Yu mingdong took the time to look at the few raw stones that he had his eye on yesterday. Song Wei followed Xia ruofei and strolled around the venue leisurely.

Xia ruofei seemed to be aimless, but in fact, he had already screened through the candidates yesterday. Today’s goal was very clear.

He had his eyes on about a dozen raw stones. What he needed to do today was to further screen and pick out a few stones that he needed to sell decisively. After all, he had to leave some soup for others to drink. There was always a trade – off, and it all depended on the price – Performance ratio.

Besides, Xia ruofei had to pick out a suitable raw stone to recommend to Song Wei.

Therefore, although he seemed to have limited resources, his brain was actually spinning rapidly, constantly analyzing the raw gemstones that he had high hopes for.

In fact, after the first round of selection yesterday, the spirit map space’s reaction was the strongest. It was a huge raw stone with a starting price of 43 million. However, Xia ruofei had quickly eliminated this raw stone.

Not only was the starting price ridiculously high, but it was also mainly because this raw stone was also a semi – Bright material, and many people were paying attention to it. From the window that was opened, the quality of the Jade inside the material was quite high. Although the bidding had not ended, many people had already put in their bids.

This raw stone had the potential to be the highest bid. Xia ruofei estimated that the final price might be much higher than the starting price, so there was no point in chasing after it.

Even if he would still earn a little in the end, the price – Performance ratio would not be very high.

On the contrary, the raw stone that Xia ruofei was most optimistic about had a starting price that was not even one – tenth of this giant raw stone. However, the reaction of the spirit painting scroll was almost the same as this giant raw stone and it was not a particularly popular material.

This was what Xia ruofei wanted to choose.

In fact, most of the materials that Xia ruofei had his eyes on were in this situation.

In the end, Xia ruofei chose five raw gemstones as his target.

The starting price of these five raw stones was less than 15 million Yuan, but judging from the reaction of the spirit paintings, the total value of the Jade contained in them was definitely not lower than that of the previous night’s stone. One of them could even almost catch up to the value of the stone last night.

If the final transaction price did not exceed 30 million, it would be a big profit.

At the same time, Xia ruofei had also chosen a raw stone for Song Wei. The starting price of this raw stone was only 90000 Yuan. It was not very eye – catching in the public Jade bid today.

This raw stone in the corner was also almost uninterested.

Xia ruofei even suspected that he had forgotten to take it out during the exhibition a few days ago. He had simply put it on display in the last batch. As for whether people would buy it, the organizer might not be too concerned.

It would naturally be best if they could be sold, but if they couldn ‘t, they could just slowly sell them in the store.

There’s no date!

In fact, this raw stone was quite good. According to the reaction strength of the spirit map scroll, the Jade inside could be sold for three to four hundred thousand Yuan, or even four to five hundred thousand Yuan.

To Song Wei, this raw stone was the most suitable for her.

Hence, since 10 am, Xia ruofei had been using his spiritual power to lock onto the six raw gemstones he had chosen. Especially when someone went to bid, he would immediately look at the price of the other party.

At around 11:40, under Song Wei’s urging, Xia ruofei finally took out the bidding slip ...
