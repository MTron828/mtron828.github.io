Xu Yougang quickly found Zhang Aijun outside the residential area and urged him to leave room 1902. Zhang Aijun did not need to monitor the situation from the high ground anymore, so he immediately withdrew.

In reality, both Liu haojun and Fang Chenchen had people following them. Xu Yougang’s arrangement was just a precaution. After all, Liu haojun’s identity was special, and it was never too much to be careful.

“Aijun, can you check if there are any houses for rent in this neighborhood?” “We need a temporary safe house,” Xu Yougang said.

“I walked around the neighborhood just now. There were quite a few small advertisements for rental. I’ve memorized them all.” Zhang Aijun grinned.

Xu Yougang gave him a thumbs – up and said,””Contact them immediately. We need the one along the street, and we need one that can be checked in immediately!”

“Understood!” Zhang Aijun said.

His comrades had a good rapport with each other. Zhang Aijun knew that they had to find a place to stay after installing the monitoring equipment. After all, the signal had a limited range. Unless they stayed in the car and parked at the edge of the neighborhood, the old neighborhood opposite was the most suitable. When he went downstairs, he took note of the rental information and took a picture with his phone.

The houses on the side of the street could not only ensure signal reception, but they could also monitor Building No. 3 on the opposite side. If Liu haojun did not close the windows, he could even directly observe the situation in Room 1902 through a high – Power telescope. It was naturally the best choice.

In this kind of old community, there were relatively more houses for rent. Generally, owners with a certain financial ability would buy a new community elsewhere. However, because the location of this community was good, and some of them were even in the school district, the rising trend of house prices was very obvious. Unless they were short of money, they were rarely in a hurry to sell, so many people rented out.

Zhang Aijun quickly got in touch with a house owner. It was a two – bedroom apartment on the top floor of the building. After discussing the price on the phone, they soon met a middle – aged woman.

It was obvious that this person often rented houses and was very experienced. He did not go through an agent but handled the rental matters himself.

The rent for the house was not cheap, 3000 Yuan a month. At this price, one could at least rent a three – bedroom apartment in a slightly worse area. If it was in the suburbs, the rent of a duplex building would only be at this price.

However, Xu Yougang didn’t care about the rent. He signed the agreement quickly.

The landlady wanted to sign a one – year contract.

Xu Yougang also knew that the contract period was basically non – negotiable. People usually wanted a stable lease, but you said you were only renting for a week? Two weeks? Wouldn’t that be even more suspicious?

Therefore, he could only try his best to negotiate, hoping to pay less down. Originally, the landlady wanted to pay two to one, but Xu Yougang said that the brothers had just come to San Shan to work and did not have much money with them. In addition, they looked honest and dutiful. In the end, the landlady finally agreed to pay one to one, which was a one – time payment of 6000 Yuan.

Xu Yougang signed the contract quickly, but he was still a little worried about the 6000 Yuan rent. At most, it would only be for a week or ten days! If he didn’t renew the lease, he wouldn’t be able to get back the 3000 Yuan deposit.

When the landlady saw the 6000 Yuan in cash, she immediately took out the contract. She didn’t even check Xu Yougang’s fake ID and signed the contract directly. Then, she handed the key to Xu Yougang and left on her electric bike.

Xu Yougang and Zhang Aijun cleaned up the house and started setting up the equipment.

A tripod was placed at the window of Building No. 3 of the West Lake Mansion District across the street. A high – powered telescope was fixed on it.

They moved the dining table to the living room and used it as a work desk. There were two laptops and some equipment on it.

Xu Yougang personally checked the signal reception and found that the image was very clear and the signal transmission was stable. As for the sound, there was no one in the house, so he couldn’t evaluate the effect. However, Zhang Aijun had tested it just now and it shouldn’t be a big problem.

The computer would remain on for the rest of the time, so the real – time signals collected by the two cameras and bugs would be recorded and stored in the hard disk.

Then, Xu Yougang told Zhang Aijun to keep an eye on the surveillance footage. He went to the master bedroom and took out his phone to call Zeng Liang and Wang Chong to ask about the situation.

After Liu haojun and Fang Chenchen left the West Lake residence, they went to their respective units. Everything seemed normal, and Zeng Liang and Wang Chong were only keeping an eye on them from the outside.

Xu You thought for a while and decided to call it a day. He would gather everyone in this house at night and then redistribute the tasks.

Considering the limited manpower, one person was left in the room to keep an eye on the surveillance cameras and pay close attention to the situation in room 1920. The other three took turns to keep an eye on Fang Chenchen and Liu haojun so that one of them could get some rest.

Then, Xu Yougang called Xia ruofei with his special mobile phone.

Xia ruofei was in the chairman’s office on the top floor of the Tao Yuan tower. He was preparing for a large auction in Hong Kong. The related preparations were going on in an orderly manner. He was also personally in charge of the headquarters.
