Manager Lu nodded helplessly and said,””Vice – Chancellor Tian, inspector Wu, please wait a moment. I’ll go and ask President Ling for instructions ...”

He really had no other choice. These two were clearly not reasonable with him, and he could not afford to offend such people.

Since all the higher – ups of the company were present today, and the incident had something to do with Ling Qingxue’s decision to go to flying Snow Pavilion, manager Lu had no choice but to think of Ling Qingxue.

He carefully asked Tian Mingyi and inspector Wu to sit at the side and wait, then quickly walked to the flying Snow Pavilion in the backyard.

As soon as he entered the courtyard, manager Lu heard Ling Xiaotian’s hearty laughter.

It turned out that the chairman was also present ... Manager Lu’s heart also relaxed slightly. Since Ling Xiaotian was here, it was even better. After this matter was consulted, no matter how it was dealt with, and no matter what the final result was, he would not have to bear much responsibility.

At the thought of this, manager Lu quickened his pace and knocked on the door. Then, he walked in.

“Xiao Lu?” Ling Xiaotian was stunned for a moment before he smiled and said,”what are you doing here instead of being busy in front? Go, go, I don’t need you to greet me!”

Manager Lu forced a smile and slightly bowed.””Chairman, President Ling, I ... I have something to report to the two leaders!”

Then, manager Lu reported Tian Mingyi’s matter in full detail and said,””That principal Tian just heard that President Ling came to flying Snow Pavilion. He’s asking for a private room in flying Snow Pavilion. If we don’t arrange a room for him, he’ll ... He’ll shut our shop down ... Chairman, President Ling, what do you think ...”

Ling Xiaotian sneered and said,”he said that I can’t open my shop, so I can ‘t?.”

No matter what, Ling Xiaotian was still a multi – billion Yuan tycoon. Having operated in the three mountains for so many years, he still had some Foundation.

“That’s true, that’s true ...”Manager Lu quickly said,” but the King of Hell is easy to hide from, but the little ghost is hard to deal with! Especially since the health Inspection Bureau is in charge of a lot of places. If they come to find trouble with us every now and then, it would be quite annoying ... Chairman, we can’t afford to offend such a villain!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Ling Xiaotian furrowed his brows and said,”the flying Snow Pavilion will definitely not be given up!” Xiao Lu, is there any way to adjust another box ...”

“Uncle Ling!” Xia ruofei suddenly said,”why are you being so polite to these unreasonable and self – righteous idiots? Tell them to go to the side and stay there!”

Manager Lu saw that Ling Xiaotian was about to be swayed by his words, but the young man beside him suddenly came out and said such childish words. He couldn’t help but feel angry.

However, he also saw that Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue had walked in hand in hand, and even Ling Xiaotian had personally come over to make tea with them. Hence, he did not dare to be too rude. He could only smile bitterly and say,”Sir, Tian Mingyi’s father is the Deputy Director of the health Bureau ...”

“Xiao Lu!” Ling Xiaotian did not wait for manager Lu to finish his sentence and immediately interrupted him, saying,”we’ll do as Xiao Xia says! Tell them that there are no more private rooms! We also have rules when we open our doors to do business. If they come in to spend, they have to follow our rules! Otherwise, they would not be welcomed here!”

“Ah?” Manager Lu couldn’t help but open his mouth in shock.

He couldn’t believe that Ling Xiaotian, who had been in the business world for so many years, would say such cynical words. In business, amiability was the key to making money. As the saying went,”too hard is easy to break.” For Ling Xiaotian to be able to make his business so big, he must have his own way of dealing with people and such.

At the very least, he wouldn’t be as overbearing as he was today.

Otherwise, he would have offended many people.

Manager Lu had clearly seen that Ling Xiaotian was about to relent. In fact, as long as they were able to coordinate a private room, even if it was not flying Snow Pavilion, manager Lu would at most throw away his face and say some good words. This matter could still be settled perfectly.

If he followed Ling Xiaotian’s instructions, then he would have really offended him.

Who was this young man? His one sentence actually changed the Chairman’s mind ... Manager Lu couldn’t help but Mutter in his heart.

Ling Xiaotian frowned and said,”little Lu, what are you thinking about?” Did you not hear me?”

Manager Lu seemed to wake up from a dream and quickly said,””I heard it, I heard it! But ... Chairman, this way ...”

Ling Qingxue interrupted manager Lu with a smile and said,””Old Lu, just do as my dad said! We’re in the right on this matter, so don’t be afraid!”

If it was someone else who said this, manager Lu would not hesitate to scold the other party for being childish.

But the person who said that was the company’s chairman and Deputy General Manager! Even if he was given a few more guts, he would not dare to say anything disrespectful. Although he disapproved in his heart, he still nodded helplessly and said,””Okay, I got it, President Ling...I’ll go out first!”

As manager Lu walked out, he muttered in his heart,”AI! The chairman didn’t seem like an impulsive person! He didn’t know what was going on today! Fine, since it’s your two bosses ‘instructions, I’ll resolutely carry it out. As for the consequences, I don’t care!

After thinking it through, manager Lu’s footsteps relaxed a little. Soon, he came to the bar counter in the front yard.
