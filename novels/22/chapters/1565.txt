Translator: 549690339

Song Wei picked a few important messages and replied to them. She saw that Xia ruofei had used her name to reply to her mother’s messages on WeChat. After that, her mother sent her a few more messages. Song Wei thought for a while and replied with a selfie so that her parents would not worry.

It was already two in the morning, so no one replied to her.

Song Wei kept her phone and got out of bed.

She went to the living room outside. Xia ruofei was smoking, his expression conflicted.

Seeing Song Wei come out, Xia ruofei quickly put out the cigarette and ran to open the window for ventilation.

Song Wei sat down on the sofa opposite Xia ruofei and smiled.”It doesn’t matter, you can smoke if you want! It’s fine to smoke second – hand smoke occasionally ...”

“It’s impolite to smoke in front of a lady ...”Xia ruofei smiled awkwardly.

Song Wei smiled and looked at Xia ruofei.””Tell me! I know you have something to say to me ...”

Xia ruofei stopped smiling and sat down on the sofa. He looked into Song Wei’s eyes and asked,””What I’m going to say next might be beyond your understanding, and might even make you feel that it’s unbelievable, but ...”

“It doesn’t matter. As long as you say it, I’ll believe it!” Song Wei interrupted Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”let’s start from when we were separated in the underground palace!” When I saw you again, you were in a stone room ...”

Other than the existence of the spirit map space, Xia ruofei did not hide anything else from Song Wei. He told her everything that happened after he saw Song Wei’s spirit body in the stone room.

Even though Song Wei trusted Xia ruofei completely, her mouth was still wide open when she heard such a bizarre story.

Especially when she heard that her body had been taken over by another powerful soul and that this soul had even launched a fierce attack on Xia ruofei, she could not help but cry out.

Compared to soul possession, cultivation and other things that were impossible in real life, Song Wei was more concerned about Xia ruofei’s safety.

Even though Xia ruofei was right in front of her and it was obvious that she was safe in the underground palace, Song Wei’s heart still beat a few times.

Song Wei only heaved a sigh of relief when Xia ruofei said that the senior in the coffin had come out and suppressed the spirit. He had forced her to give up on Song Wei’s body and escape. The senior had also sent the two of them out of the underground palace.

After Xia ruofei said this, he felt that his mouth was dry. He took a sip of tea and continued,””When the spirit took control of your body, it injured your soul. After the spirit left, you fell into a deep coma. How should I put it ... It’s very similar to a vegetative state. You have no reaction to any external stimulation ...”

Song Wei felt a little scared. She looked at Xia ruofei and said,”Ruofei, I didn’t expect this trip to the underground palace to be so dangerous. It seems that we’re really lucky to be able to keep our lives ...”

Xia ruofei asked curiously,”do you accept supernatural things like soul possession and cultivation so easily?” You don’t suspect anything at all?”

“We’ve been through so much in the underground palace, what’s there that we can’t accept?”Song Wei smiled. You just disappeared from the altar. Can this be explained by science? ‘And for myself, my vision blurred and I was in another place. Can this be explained by science? So ...”

Song Wei shrugged and said, “There’s nothing that I can’t accept. Besides ... I believe you. You would never lie to me!”

Xia ruofei laughed bitterly to himself. He did keep some things from Song Wei, including the diary that she had written on her phone. He did not dare to say it out loud.

“Then, in order to wake me up, you brought me here and found the medicinal herbs I needed, right?” Song Wei continued.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””Song Wei, things aren’t that simple ... When you woke up, a small accident happened ...”

Xia ruofei looked at Song Wei and asked,””You ... You really can’t remember anything?”

Song Wei immediately thought of that charming dream. In the dream, she was so bold. She threw away all restraint and hugged Xia ruofei tightly ...

Song Wei’s face turned red at the thought of it. She quickly glanced at Xia ruofei and said in a low voice,””I ... I really can’t remember ...”

Xia ruofei noticed Song Wei’s expression. He immediately knew that it was not that Song Wei could not remember, but that she could not believe it was true.

Seeing Song Wei like this, Xia ruofei was even more embarrassed to speak.

After all, something like the peach blossom miasma was too sinister for a girl.

There was a difference between a man and a woman, and Xia ruofei knew that Song Wei had special feelings for him, so he could not open his mouth.

However, in order to solve the problem of the peach blossom miasma, he needed Song Wei’s cooperation. Xia ruofei hesitated for a long time and finally decided to tell her everything.

He chose his words carefully and said,””Song Wei, I’m still not vigilant enough. Although that spirit was forced to give up your body, she separated a wisp of her soul before she left. It’s wrapped in a very evil poison and is hidden in your sea of consciousness. The moment you woke up, this soul fragment suddenly appeared. After I destroyed it, the poison quickly spread ...”

“Ah?” Song Wei’s face turned pale. She did not expect to experience such a dangerous scene when she woke up.

Xia ruofei quickly added,”you don’t have to be afraid. I’ve already controlled the poison. Also ... It won’t be life – threatening.”

Song Wei’s mind kept replaying the scenes in her dream that made her blush and her heart race. She took a deep breath and asked,”RUO Fei, what kind of poison is this?”

Xia ruofei hesitated and said,””This poison is called peach blossom miasma. It can be said to be very evil. If it is allowed to wreak havoc, it will make the poisoned person ... Lose their sense of shame. Their body will be completely driven by primitive desires. In ... In terms of sexual relations ... They will become very ... Uh ... Very casual ...”

Even though Xia ruofei had thought of the right words, he still found it difficult to say. It was indeed difficult to talk about such a topic in front of a beautiful lady, especially a Virgin.

Xia ruofei felt even more tired than the first time he ran a ten – kilometer cross – country with a heavy load when he was a soldier.

Song Wei’s face turned pale and her eyes were filled with fear. She couldn’t imagine what it would be like if she became that kind of person. She might as well just die ...

Then, Song Wei finally confirmed that the scene was not a dream. It was real. She did such an embarrassing thing in front of Xia ruofei ... RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

At the thought of this, Song Wei’s pale face turned red again. She did not even dare to look in Xia ruofei’s direction.

Xia ruofei quickly explained,”Song Wei, don’t be stressed. It’s not your fault. It’s the peach blossom miasma!” And ... And I didn’t even do anything to you! I’ll knock you out at the first moment! Uh ... This was an emergency, don’t blame me!”

Song Wei blushed and said with her head lowered, “Don’t say anymore!”

Xia ruofei said,”I just wanted to explain to you ... I’m afraid you’ll misunderstand that I’m ...”

“You still dare to say that!” Song Wei raised her head and glared at Xia ruofei. Then, she quickly lowered her head. Her teeth bit her red lips and her hands clutched the corners of her clothes tightly, twisting them unconsciously.

“Okay, okay, okay. I won’t say it, I won’t say it ...” Xia ruofei said. Then, he patted his head and said,”I can’t not say it!” To solve this problem, I’ll need your cooperation!”
