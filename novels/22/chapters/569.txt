Chapter 570: It’s really you_2

Xia ruofei believed that Feng Jing would do a better job than him in negotiating.

After a moment of silence, President Lin said,””That works too! I’ll book the plane tickets first. Brother Xia, shall we meet in three days?”

“See you in three days!” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Just as Xia ruofei was making the call, boss Qian came back in his car.

The moment he saw Qian Lijun, he immediately asked,”Li Jun, where’s boss Xia?”

Qian Lijun pointed to a place not far away and said,”There! He’s making a call! Dad, what’s wrong with you? What happened?”

Before boss Qian could say anything, Xia ruofei had already finished his call. He put his phone into his pocket and walked over to Qian Lijun.

Boss Qian wasn’t in the mood to talk too much with Qian Lijun. He quickly walked over.

Qian Lijun was confused, so he could only speed up and follow them.

Boss Qian came in front of Xia ruofei and looked at him with a strange expression. Then, he said cautiously,””Mr. Xia ...”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, and then he couldn’t help but laugh.””Uncle Qian, you ... Why are you suddenly so polite?”

“Dad, what’s wrong with you?” Qian Lijun couldn’t help but ask.

During breakfast this morning, her father was still calling Xia ruofei “ruofei” affectionately. Why was he so formal after going out for a while? Qian Lijun also felt that it was unbelievable.

......

Boss Qian turned around and glared at Qian Lijun. He then said,”Xia ...”

“Uncle Qian, you can just call me RUO Fei!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’m not used to you being like this.”

“Okay, okay ... RUO ... Fei, do you ... Have friends in Xiang Nan Province?” boss Qian’s face turned red.

Xia ruofei suddenly understood everything.

He was originally worried about what had happened to boss Qian! Now that he had guessed the cause and effect, he was slightly relieved.

“Uncle Qian, it seems like you’ve received the money that was scammed?” Xia ruofei smiled.

Boss Qian’s body trembled when he heard that. He opened his eyes wide and said,””Ruofei, you really helped me get back this money!”

Qian Lijun was confused and couldn’t help but ask,”Dad, ruofei, what are you guys talking about? What are you talking about?”

Boss Qian took a deep breath and said to Qian Lijun,”Li Jun, Liu Jinsheng came to look for me this morning. He took the initiative to return the eighty million Yuan that he had scammed to me ...”

“What? That old bastard actually returned the money? Did the sun rise from the West?” Qian Lijun called out subconsciously. Then, his expression froze and he said,”wait! Dad, you ... You just said ruofei?”

At this point, Qian Lijun looked at Xia ruofei in disbelief. Boss Qian’s eyes were also quite eager.

Seeing this, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Uncle Qian, Li Jun, I also accidentally found out that your family had been cheated of a lot of money by this Liu Jinsheng a few years ago. It just so happens that I have a friend who is quite influential in xiangnan province, so I made a decision on my own and asked him to try to help you collect your debts. I didn’t expect him to be so efficient ...”

Qian Lijun’s entire body was petrified. Boss Qian had already guessed it before he came, so his performance was still okay. However, he was still extremely shocked.

He didn’t expect his son’s comrade to have such power!

All these years, boss Qian had been chasing after debts many times. Every time he came to xiangnan province, he was met with many obstacles and even threatened by some of the local gangsters.

Hence, he knew that Liu Jinsheng was quite powerful in xiangnan province. At least, ordinary people could not do anything to Liu Jinsheng. Not to mention that Liu Jinsheng was so scared that he did not even dare to leave ou Yue after he returned the money. He had to wait for Xia ruofei to give the order.

Boss Qian had almost given up in the past two years. He felt that it was impossible to get back the money in his life. He didn’t expect that it would be solved so easily by his son’s comrade.

The shock in his heart could not be any greater.

After a long while, Qian Lijun finally came back to his senses and muttered,”Ruofei, you’ve been quiet all this while, but now you’ve become so awesome ...”

“Ruofei!” Boss Qian quickly said. I don’t even know how to thank you. For this money, I’ve fought so many lawsuits and made countless trips to xiangnan province, all of which ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,””Uncle Qian, Li Jun and I are brothers. We’re comrades who can shield each other from bullets on the battlefield! So, you don’t have to be so polite. I just happen to know a friend who can help. Otherwise, I can’t do anything by myself. ”

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Qian Lijun’s eyes became slightly moist. It was as if he had returned to the green military camp in a straight line and the square, back to the training ground where sweat poured down like rain, and back to his youth ...

“Oh right, ruofei, you reminded me!” Boss Qian quickly said. That friend of yours has helped me so much, I have to thank him properly!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Uncle Qian, there’s no need. This is just a matter of a few phone calls to him. Besides, I’m on very good terms with him. You don’t have to be so formal.”
