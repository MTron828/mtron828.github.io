Although Xia ruofei was still offering her a management position, Lin Yue ‘e knew that even if Xia ruofei were to offer her a few more positions, she would not be able to become an ordinary worker.

Indeed, she did not want Xia ruofei’s special treatment. However, she knew that Xia ruofei’s warm invitation to their family to the three mountains was already a special treatment.

Lin Yue ‘e was the wife of a soldier. She was not a pretentious person. Since she had accepted Xia ruofei’s help, there was no need to be embarrassed about the position. She would just do her best to help him manage the orchard.

Xia ruofei said happily,”okay!” Sister – in – Law, then you should get ready. I’ll come and pick you up tomorrow!”

“Alright, thank you for your hard work, ruofei,” Lin Yue ‘e said.

She did not reject Xia ruofei’s good intentions. After all, she was bringing Nan Nan along and her father – in – Law was not in good health. If she were to go to the three mountains, she would be exhausted from all kinds of travel. Furthermore, she was going to live in the three mountains for a long time and had to bring a lot of things. She had to take care of the old and the young along the way by car and train. It was really a little unbearable for her.

After Xia ruofei hung up the phone, he took a nap. When it was time for work in the afternoon, he strolled to the office building.

The highly motivated Lin Qiao had already arrived at Xia ruofei’s office, so Feng Jing naturally knew about Xia ruofei’s return. As soon as Xia ruofei arrived at the office, Feng Jing came over with a few middle managers to report on their work.

The company’s operations had been very smooth during this period.

The new vegetable greenhouse had been put into use, and the production capacity was gradually increasing, but it would still take a cycle to reach the peak.

Everything was going smoothly at the pomfrets breeding base. There were no signs of a large number of deaths, and the wild pomfrets were growing very fast. Jiang Hua was very excited when he talked about this.

The second phase of the heart – nourishing soup was being carried out extensively, and the results were as everyone had expected. It was quite good. The State Drug Administration was also preparing to further simplify the process. It was estimated that the second phase of the clinical trial would be successfully completed in a month at most.

Xia ruofei was very satisfied after hearing the report. He told Jiang Hua that a new batch of clam fish would arrive in a few days and asked him to be prepared. In fact, Xia ruofei could take out the clam fish at any time. However, he had to pick up Lin Yue ‘E’s family the next day. This matter had the highest priority, so he naturally postponed the clam fish.

Jiang Hua was very excited to hear that. He quickly said that the breeding workshop was ready to receive the fish at any time.

Xia ruofei also talked to Cao tieshu, saying that he was ready to separate the orchard business from the others. When the time came, there would be a new supervisor in charge of the orchard business, and he asked him to prepare for the handover.

Cao tieshu was a simple and honest villager. He had always been determined to carry out his boss’s words. This time, he also agreed without any second thoughts.

After talking to his capable subordinates about work, Xia ruofei let them go back to their own work.

He picked up the phone on his desk and called the security Department. If the Veterans were not on duty or patrolling, they would stay in the big office of the security Department during the day. If they were looking for someone, they would be able to call here.

The Lei Hu that Xia ruofei was looking for was in the office. When he heard that Xia ruofei was looking for him, he immediately jogged over to Xia ruofei’s office.
