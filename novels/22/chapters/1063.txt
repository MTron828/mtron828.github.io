Chapter 1064: The mysterious buyer (2)

Translator: 549690339

Everyone knew that other than Zheng zhilun, no one else would bid.

Zheng zhilun secretly gritted his teeth and hesitated for a while. Then, he made up his mind and raised his board.” 9 million! 9 million Hong Kong dollars!”

There was another uproar in the crowd. The price of an abalone had actually exceeded 9 million Hong Kong dollars. This was really a miracle.

As the auctioneer, Lu zhongguang was naturally happy to see such a scene. The higher the bid, the higher his Commission!

Therefore, Lu zhongguang raised his voice and said,”” 9 million! Mr. Zheng had bid 9 million Hong Kong dollars! It was an unbelievable price! It’s hard to buy a good heart with money! If we miss it this time, we might never be able to buy such high – Quality abalones again!”

Zheng zhilun stared at the big screen after he announced the price.

Everyone in the audience turned to look at the big screen at the same time.

They really wanted to know, since it had already reached such a high price, would that buyer 06 continue to increase the price?

The waiting time was not long. Just a few seconds after Zheng zhilun’s bid, the new price of this buyer number 06 appeared on the big screen.

If the network delay was taken into account, the other party did not hesitate at all.

However, when everyone saw the price, they couldn’t help but reveal a puzzled look.

Zheng zhilun also shouted,”What is this?” Did I call the wrong number? The price had already reached 9 million. How could this long – range buyer make such a bid? Isn’t your Hengfeng auction house’s long – distance auction system a little too unreliable?”

It turned out that the amount of money that appeared on the big screen was: 1,500,000?

That would be 1.5 million.

Everyone started discussing spiritedly.

Lu zhongguang was stunned when he saw the price, but he quickly reacted. His mouth slowly opened, and it became bigger and bigger until it could even fit an egg.

Many people had not yet reacted to the situation. The remote auction system could be set in advance. When the auction price reached a certain price, the remote bidding could only be higher than that price, and the increase would not be less than the preset minimum.

It was already 9 million Hong Kong dollars. Even if the staff had not entered the limited price in time, the previous round had already reached 8.7 million Hong Kong dollars! How was it possible to get a price of 1.5 million?

At this moment, Li Kai, who had been watching the show with a smile, said indifferently,””Everyone, can you please look at the currency unit clearly? This buyer’s offer is not in Hong Kong dollars ...”

At this moment, it was as if everyone had just woken up from a dream, and they all opened their eyes wide to take a closer look. As expected, the 1.5 million Yuan was actually “U.S.$.” In other words, US dollars.

Because the font size of the currency unit in the remote auction system was smaller and the color was lighter, and the previous auctions had been in Hong Kong, everyone had a preconceived idea and did not realize that the bid from buyer 06 was 1.5 million dollars.

“I say! Hengfeng is such a big company. How could such a low – Level mistake happen in a remote auction system?”

“1.5 million USD is almost 11 million Hong Kong dollars! This buyer is the real deal!”

“He increased the bid by more than 1 million Hong Kong dollars in one go. How domineering!”

Everyone was discussing excitedly, and the media reporters also raised their cameras and aimed them at the big screen to take pictures. Each and every one of them looked like they had taken stimulants.

There was an endless stream of news about today’s auction, but there was too much to write about.

Lu zhongguang laughed and heaved a sigh of relief. For a moment, he really thought that there was a Bug in the company’s remote auction system! However, he should have been the first to react.

“This long – distance buyer, number 06, has bid 1.5 million US dollars!” Lu zhongguang said excitedly,”according to today’s real – time exchange rate, it is equivalent to 11.72 million Hong Kong dollars! Are there any higher bids?”

Zheng zhilun’s face turned red and white. He had been suppressed too much just now, so he could not help but question the auction house when he saw the bid. In the end, he was slapped in the face in the blink of an eye.

Did you not check the Chinese calendar when you went out today? Why did nothing ever go smoothly? Zheng zhilun’s heart was filled with resentment.

Facing Lu zhongguang’s eager gaze, Zheng zhilun frowned and put down his auction card.

It was already 1172 Hong Kong dollars. He was not a fool, so how could he raise the price again?

He had already lost face today anyway. Even if he forcefully competed with the other party, he wouldn’t be in a good mood after buying the abalone. He might as well give up!

As for the birthday gift for Zheng qitong, he still had time to think of another way.

Lu zhongguang could tell from Zheng zhilun’s body language that this young master Zheng had probably given up. He could not help but sigh in his heart.

“1.5 million dollars going once!”

“1.5 million dollars going twice!”

“1.5 million dollars going thrice! Deal!”

The auction mallet fell down heavily, which also meant that today’s exciting auction had finally come to an end.

There was a warm round of applause in the venue. Whether it was those who won the auction or those who missed it, or the media reporters present, they all felt that today’s trip was really worth it.

At this moment, Feng Jing walked onto the stage and spoke into the microphone,””Thank you, everyone, for coming to this auction that our paradise Corporation and the Hengfeng auction house are collaborating on! Today’s auction was very successful. I think ... Everyone should be very interested in this mysterious buyer number 06, right?” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The reporters had already packed up and were about to leave the venue, but after hearing Feng Jing’s words, they couldn’t help but return to their seats.

“According to the rules of the auction, remote buyers can choose to purchase anonymously!” Feng Rao laughed. However, our staff has communicated with this buyer number 06, and he is willing to disclose his identity!”

“Now, let’s welcome this mysterious buyer with a warm round of applause!”

As soon as Feng Jing finished speaking, thunderous applause rang out in the hall. Even Xia ruofei could not help but clap as he looked at the big screen.

He was also very interested in this buyer 06. Who could spend 1.5 million dollars just to buy an abalone?

In the midst of everyone’s applause, a video window appeared on the screen.

When Xia ruofei saw the mysterious buyer, he couldn’t help but exclaim. The expression on his face was quite interesting.

On the big screen was Tang He, who was far away in the United States.

The background of the picture should be in his study. The Chinese – styled study was lit up. It should be eight or nineo’ clock in the evening in the United States Tang He was wearing a linen Tang suit, sitting on the swivel chair with a smile and waving at the camera.

“I’m sure many of you have already recognized him. This is the buyer who just spent 1.5 million US dollars to buy my company’s premium one – headed abalone. He’s the founder of the United States ‘shengbang group, the famous Chinese Mr. Tang He!” Feng Rao introduced with a smile.

The moment Zheng zhilun saw Tang He, he felt a little more balanced in his heart. Tang He’s net worth was much higher than his second uncle, Zheng qitong. It was not too shameful to lose to such a legendary rich man.

“Hello, everyone!” Tang He said with a gentle smile.

Xia ruofei felt that his brain was not working well. Didn’t the old man already buy two abalones? Could it be that he had a taste of it, so he casually threw out one or two million dollars to get another one to try?

I really don’t understand the world of the Super – rich!

“I think everyone’s most interested in the question.” Feng Rao smiled. “Why is old master Tang willing to spend so much money just to buy an abalone? I wonder if old master Tang would be willing to share it with everyone?”

“Of course!” Tang He said with a smile. First of all, the Paradise Corporation is a company with great potential. I’ve tasted the vegetables, fruits, and seafood produced by the Paradise Corporation many times, and the high quality left a deep impression on me. Therefore, I’ve long made up my mind to get the top – grade abalones that your company is auctioning for the first time, no matter how much it costs! Because the rules restricted me from participating in the auction of the last abalone, so...As everyone can see, the competition was very fierce. Fortunately, this abalone was successfully bought in the end. Compared to such a precious abalone, spending a little more money is nothing!”
