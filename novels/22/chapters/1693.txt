Chapter 1694: Traditional craftsmanship (3)

Translator: 549690339

In the afternoon, Xia ruofei and Feng Jing were still doing the boring work of peeling and stubbing grapes with the workers.

By the time they had finished processing all the grapes, the sky had already turned completely dark.

Xia ruofei politely declined Old West and his wife’s invitation to dinner and returned to Paradise Farm with Feng Jing.

The next day, Xia ruofei and Feng Rao arrived at West Winery early.

“Uncle Wester, you’re not going to cut your skin again today, are you?” As soon as Xia ruofei saw him, he asked,”this job is so boring!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

West, who was organizing the workers to move the grapes picked in the early morning into the warehouse, smiled and said,””We need to remove the stubbles from this new batch of grapes as soon as possible, but this job will be handled by Capella. Our grapes from yesterday have already been soaked in low temperature, so we can proceed to the next step today!”

Xia ruofei’s eyes lit up and he said,”that’s great!” When does it start?”

“Immediately!” Old West said,”please follow me!”

Old West brought Xia ruofei and Feng Jing to the winery’s wine Workshop. Although he had always insisted on using traditional wine brewing techniques, Old West was not against new techniques. For example, the hygiene conditions were much better than his ancestors hundreds of years ago.

After everyone went through a strict disinfection process, Old West allowed them to enter the workshop.

Old West put on his rubber gloves as he said,””Today, we’re going to first extract the juice! This process had to be completed by an experienced winemaker. Bill and the others were all old buddies! They will come with me to extract the juice of the grapes that have been soaked in low temperature!”

A few white – haired old workers beside Old West smiled at Xia ruofei.

This time, Xia ruofei and Feng Jing could not do anything. They just watched Old West pour the grapes into a special container and squeezed the juice by hand. The grape juice would flow from the small tube at the bottom of the container into the stainless steel bucket.

Old West said as he operated,””The process of juicing must be fast and avoid contact with the air as much as possible because the oxygen in the air will cause oxidation, deterioration, and color change of the grape juice. At the same time, the movement must be very gentle, otherwise too much pressure may cause the skin of the grape to break, releasing tannins and other substances, causing the taste to be bitter. ”

“It seems like this process is crucial!” Xia ruofei nodded.

“Hahaha! Xia, don’t worry! We’ve been doing this for decades, there’s definitely no problem!” Old West said with a smile.

Old West and the others were very efficient. They finished processing the grapes from yesterday in half a day.

The workers moved the sealed stainless steel barrels of grape juice into the small cold storage and placed them neatly.

“Xia,” Old West said,”the juice still needs to be set still under cooling conditions. This way, the large particles will be deposited at the bottom of the container. What we need to make wine is the supernatant. We use them for fermentation!”

“How long will it take?” Xia ruofei asked.

Old West smiled and said,”it’ll be about this time tomorrow!” Now, for convenience’s sake, some wineries often use a centrifuge for separation, but this will also cause the yeast to be removed, so artificial yeast needs to be added. ”

Xia ruofei laughed.”I know. This is something that uncle Wester can’t tolerate. He’s a man who has always been insistent on traditional craftsmanship.”

“Hahaha!” Old West laughed and said,”yes! Such a revolution was wrong! They can say that I’m old – fashioned, but I’ll stick to my own point of view!”

“I like this kind of old – fashioned and conservative!” Xia ruofei gave him a thumbs up and smiled.”Then ... We’ll come again tomorrow!”

In the afternoon, the winery would definitely continue to peel and remove the stems of the newly picked grapes. Xia ruofei was indeed a little bored, so he decided to bring Feng Jing around the Hunter Valley for a tour. They would continue to experience traditional wine – making the next day.
