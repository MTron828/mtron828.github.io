2921 Charlie’s strength_

……

Xia ruofei had just settled down in a safe house in iswatlan. Zhang Chao was about to discuss with him about the next step of the evacuation and the transportation of the container of firearms when his phone rang.

Xia ruofei saw that it was the number that Charlie cohe had just called and said,”Brother Zhang, I’m sorry, I have to take this call!”

Zhang Chao heard this and immediately said,””Mr. Xia, I’ll go and settle my brothers first. I’ll come back to you later!”

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile and said,””Alright!”

After Zhang Chao left, Xia ruofei picked up the phone.

As soon as the call went through, Xia ruofei heard Charlie’s excited voice from the other end of the phone.””Daoist immortal! I’m Charlie Koch, sorry to have kept you waiting!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Charlie, in Huaxia, people call us cultivators. We are not gods.”

“In my opinion, you are an immortal of the East! They look exactly like the immortals described in the Classic of Mountains and Seas and the swordsman of Shu mountain!” Charlie said.

“I didn’t expect you to have read these books!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Oh right, you should be saved now, right? You didn’t leave any traces behind when you sank the yacht last night, did you?”

Charlie was stunned at first, thinking,”how did the immortal know about these things?” He had already left when I blew up the ship!

However, Charlie immediately changed his mind. This was a God! He definitely knew everything! Although he wasn’t at the scene, he knew that he had blown up the yacht. It was nothing strange.

Thinking of this, Charlie quickly replied,””Thank you for your concern. In the vast ocean, a ship usually doesn’t leave any traces after it sinks. What’s more ... I’m going to announce to the public that my yacht was attacked by an explosion in the outer seas and sank in a short time. Even if the yacht is found and recovered in the future, the traces of the explosion won’t arouse anyone’s suspicion!”

Xia ruofei nodded to himself. He felt that Charlie was quite a meticulous person. Combined with the ruthless methods he used against his own brother, he was undoubtedly a formidable character.

Charlie immediately asked again,”Lord immortal, you’re looking for me ... Is there anything I can do for you?” Please just say it, you’re my Savior, I’m willing to go through fire and water for you!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said in Chinese,””The word ‘immortal’ is too hard to pronounce. My name is ‘Xia Tian’, so you can call me Mr. Xia from now on!”

“Yes! Mr. Xia!” Charlie cohe’s standard of Chinese was pretty good, so he quickly replied,”Mr. Xia, if there’s anything you need, please feel free to tell me. Don’t stand on ceremony with me!”

Xia ruofei nodded.”Charlie, I do have something that’s a little troublesome. Although I can handle it myself, it’s a waste of time.”

“Please give me your orders!” Charlie quickly replied. I’m honored to be at your service!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””Charlie, I believe you have a lot of influence in America. How’s your influence in Mexico?”

Charlie was stunned for a moment, and could not help feeling a sense of defeat. He had thought that everyone in the world knew of a Big Shot of his level, but after hearing the words of the divine immortal, it turned out that he did not know who he was at all?

However, on second thought, Charlie realized that the other party was a God – like figure! How could she care about the affairs of ordinary people like them? Even if he was the world’s richest man with influence all over the world, the other party probably wouldn’t even take a fancy to him!

These thoughts flashed through Charlie’s mind. He quickly adjusted his state of mind and said,”Mr. Xia, Mexico borders the United States, and I have many friends in Mexico. There’s basically nothing that can stump me. If what you want to do is in Mexico, just tell me, and I’ll definitely do it well for you!”

Xia ruofei was a little hesitant. He really did not know Charlie cohe’s identity. If it was as this guy had said and he only had a few friends in Mexico, he probably would not be able to complete today’s task. Of course, he couldn’t rule out the possibility that Charlie cohe was being modest in front of him.

Hence, Xia ruofei asked again,””If it’s about the Gulf Group in Mexico, can you do it?”

“Mr. Xia, if it’s just those drug – dealing kids, it’s definitely not a problem!” Charlie cohe smiled and said. Although I’m not as powerful as you, those drug dealers don’t dare to not give me face. If you have any needs, please tell me, and I can pass the message to them. As a Chinese saying goes, if I tell them to go east, they will never dare to go west. If I tell them to catch dogs, they will never dare to catch chickens!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh when he heard this. Charlie Koche, a foreigner, had said a Chinese saying that was full of rustic flavor in a serious manner. It was indeed very funny.

However, since Charlie dared to Pat his chest and make such a guarantee, it meant that this fellow should indeed have the confidence to do so.

Charlie cohe heard Xia ruofei’s laughter but didn’t say anything. He thought that Xia ruofei didn’t believe him and quickly said,”Mr. Xia! You might not understand my situation. My family has been in the U.S. For more than 100 years. In my generation, not only have we accumulated hundreds of billions of dollars in wealth, but our family also has a great influence in the U.S. Political and military world. Although the drug lords in Mexico are very scary in the eyes of ordinary people, in fact, they are nothing in front of a real family with real power! If you need, I can even coordinate the US seals to enter Mexico in disguise and carry out a clean – up operation against the head of the Gulf Group! They are also very clear about this, so they would definitely not dare to be arrogant in front of me!”

Xia ruofei was a little surprised. He smiled and said,””I didn’t expect that the person I saved so casually would be a super big Shot!”

Charlie cohe hurriedly replied in a terrified manner,”Mr. Xia, I don’t dare to call myself a super big Boss in front of you! If you don’t mind, I’m willing to be your Lackey in the future. If there are some things that you can’t handle, you can leave them to me!”

Xia ruofei replied indifferently,”that’s not necessary. However, it’s a little troublesome for me to handle this matter myself. If it’s not difficult for you to coordinate, please help me handle it!” Just take it as returning the favor last night!”

Charlie Koch was slightly disappointed. After seeing Xia ruofei’s godlike abilities, he naturally wanted to befriend Xia ruofei. He had completely lowered his status. On one hand, he wanted to repay Xia ruofei’s kindness. More importantly, he realized that Xia ruofei’s strength was beyond that of ordinary people. This was something that no power in the secular world could compare to. Hence, he hoped to establish a closer relationship with Xia ruofei.

But now, it seemed that Xia ruofei did not have such thoughts. He even used his life – saving grace last night as an equivalent exchange. Naturally, Charlie was very disappointed.

However, he quickly adjusted his mood because he knew that he could not make Xia ruofei unhappy no matter what. Furthermore, no matter what Xia ruofei asked him to do, he had to do it beautifully. He had to satisfy Xia ruofei. That was the only way. The next time Xia ruofei had something that he found troublesome, he would be the first one to think of.

Charlie knew very well that with Xia ruofei’s strength, it was impossible for Xia ruofei to not be able to solve any problems he encountered. The reason why he came to find Charlie was definitely because he found it troublesome.

In that case, Xia ruofei would probably encounter similar situations in the future. As long as he could perfectly help Xia ruofei solve these small problems each time, based on his understanding of the Chinese, they would definitely return the favor. This was the principle of the Chinese.

At the thought of this, Charlie cohe immediately said,”Mr. Xia, please give me your orders! I’ll do my best to help you!”
