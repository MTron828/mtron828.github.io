Chapter 425: Lu You has changed (2)

Even if Tian Huilan had thousands of ways to annihilate Fang Luo’s entire gang after the incident, even if she were to hack Fang Luo into pieces, the damage done would never be fixed.

Lu You had also seen Xia ruofei rush up to the second floor and beat up those big men like he was chopping melons and vegetables. Then, he had broken into the room. At that moment, she suddenly felt a huge sense of security. Even when she was watching the video, when she saw Xia ruofei’s figure in the video, she still felt as if she had found a safe harbor.

She had been pampered and pampered since she was young. She had never experienced such helplessness or even despair. Because of this, the sense of security she felt after seeing Xia ruofei was precious, so she also hugged Xia ruofei tightly.

A charming beauty was hugging him like this and crying like a Pear Blossom bathed in rain. From time to time, there was a faint fragrance that assailed his nose. This made Xia ruofei’s body stiffen and he did not know where to put his hands.

He knew that Lu You’s emotions were very unstable now, so he didn’t dare to push her away rashly. He could only stand there and comfort her in a low voice.

After a while, Lu You’s emotions finally calmed down.

Only then did she realize that she had hugged Xia ruofei so tightly and had buried her head in his broad chest.

Lu You quickly got out of Xia ruofei’s arms and reached out to wipe her tears. She blushed and said softly,””I’m sorry ...”

Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s okay. It’s all in the past. It’s all fine now. You don’t have to be afraid.”

“Yes ...” Lu You nodded her head gently and said,”thank you ...”

Xia ruofei smiled.”You’re welcome. Next time, don’t go to these places where the good and the bad are mixed together. It’s really dangerous.”

“I understand ...” Lu You said obediently.

Ever since Xia ruofei met Lu You, he had never seen her so submissive. He was not used to it.

He sat back down next to the computer and copied the videos he had just selected into a folder. Then, he opened a video editing software.

Lu You, who was at the side, asked curiously,””Xia ruofei, what are you doing?”

Xia ruofei turned to her and smiled.””Edit these videos. Last night’s attack was a little heavy. Although I have taken back the surveillance hard drive, it’s hard to guarantee that it won’t be filmed. Even if the police come to find me, I will have evidence to use!”

“Ah? “Yesterday, you ...” Lu You asked,”you didn’t kill someone, did you?”

“No, I didn ‘t,” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Lu You immediately felt relieved. If Xia ruofei really got into a murder case because of her, she would feel even more apologetic. Although those scumbags deserved to die and Xia ruofei was only trying to save people, if someone really died, Xia ruofei would still have to bear some responsibility. Besides, even Tian Huilan might not be able to protect Xia ruofei.

Besides, if it wasn’t absolutely necessary, Lu You definitely didn’t want Tian Huilan to know about yesterday’s incident.

Xia ruofei continued,”I’ve only crippled a few people. I think three or four of them will be disabled!” As for that master Luo who ordered his men to arrest you, he probably won’t be able to leave his wheelchair for the rest of his life, and he won’t be able to harm other girls anymore ...”

Lu You’s face blushed slightly when she heard this. She naturally understood what Xia ruofei meant. Although Xia ruofei was very ruthless and made her feel a little scared, she also felt a warm current in her heart.

Xia ruofei did not say anything more. He dragged the videos to the video editing software and started editing and combining them.

Of course, he had also made a copy of the original video material.

Lu You moved a chair over and sat beside Xia ruofei, quietly watching him work.

It was strange that after she had cried in Xia ruofei’s arms, she no longer felt afraid when she saw the videos.

Xia ruofei was very focused on operating the computer, and Lu You would sneak a glance at Xia ruofei from time to time. Then, she quickly turned her eyes back to the computer screen.

A seed seemed to be quietly sprouting in the young girl’s heart.

Perhaps even Lu You herself did not realize it.

Very quickly, Xia ruofei edited and synthesized a short video. The entire process from the moment Lu You entered the room to the moment she was forcefully carried to the second floor and locked in a room by a few burly men was clear at a glance.

Xia ruofei browsed through the app once and confirmed that there were no problems. Then, he clicked to create the video.

Then, he threw the mouse away and said with a smile,””Done!”

It took some time to generate the video. Xia ruofei turned around and said to Lu You,””The workers are all at work now. Pang Hao is still working on the first floor, so I’ll have to trouble you to stay upstairs for the day. Otherwise, it’ll be hard to avoid misunderstandings if others see you.”

Lu You nodded.”It’s okay. Besides, my clothes are still wet. I can’t just wear this and wander around your farm!”

Xia ruofei looked at Lu You, who was wearing his large thermal underwear, and could not help but laugh.

The heater in the room was very strong, so Lu You did not wear a coat. Xia ruofei’s clothes were very loose on Lu You. The hem almost covered her thighs. It was like a short skirt, and it looked very flirtatious when it was loose.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but take a few more glances.

Lu You was a little embarrassed by Xia ruofei’s gaze and could not help but lower her head.

The moment she lowered her head, her face turned red. She crossed her arms in front of her chest and glared at Xia ruofei.

“I’ll get you a coat!”Xia ruofei said.

With that, Xia ruofei left the study room as if he was escaping. He went to his bedroom to find a sports suit jacket and returned to the study room to pass it to Lu You.

When Lu You saw Xia ruofei enter, she subconsciously used her hands to block her chest and said with a red face,””Put it on the side!”

“Good, good, good!” Xia ruofei said,”then I’ll go out first. I still have to go to the orchard and the construction site to take a look. You can do as you please!” They can read or play on the computer, but they won’t come upstairs without my permission. ”

“I know ...” Lu You said with a red face.

Xia ruofei quickly left the study and went downstairs.

Lu You was no longer as unruly as she used to be in front of him. She would even blush from time to time. Xia ruofei was really not used to it. However, he also realized that if Lu You was not being unreasonable, her delicate appearance was actually quite likable.

Of course, this thought only flashed past his mind for a moment before Xia ruofei forced it out of his mind.

Now that he already had Ling Qingxue, he subconsciously felt that he shouldn’t think about those things.

With this thought in mind, Xia ruofei did not return to the second floor for the entire morning. Instead, he wandered around the greenhouse, the construction site, and the orchard.

Even Cao tieshu and the others were muttering in their hearts,”is boss not very satisfied with everyone’s recent work?” Usually, it was very difficult to see the boss. Why did he walk around so many times today?

They were much more active in their work. If they knew the reason why Xia ruofei was wandering around, they would not know whether to laugh or cry.

In the afternoon, Xia ruofei made a simple lunch for himself. When it was close to noon, pang Hao went to the bank in the city to settle some matters. Xia ruofei did not need to leave any food for him. He brought it all upstairs and had lunch with Lu You. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Then, Xia ruofei let Lu You take a nap in his bedroom while he continued to wander around the farm. It was only until the workers had all left work in the evening and Lu You’s clothes were completely dry that he brought Lu You downstairs after she had changed her clothes. Then, he drove her back to Sanshan University.
