Chapter 955: Chapter 619-it’s too late to regret (1)

Translator: 549690339

Tang Yitian was one of Australia’s leading figures in the retail industry, and he had the backing of the righteous Association. He didn’t know who Robinson was, but Robinson recognized this famous Chinese tycoon with one look.

Robinson didn’t expect Tang Yitian to be in the car as well. When Tang Yitian’s imposing gaze swept over him, he felt his scalp go numb and his heart couldn’t help but tremble.

“M – Mr. Tang ...” Robinson’s teeth were chattering.”I didn’t know you were in the car. I’m really sorry ... My son offended Mr. Xia last night. I ... I brought him here to apologize!”

Tang Yitian glanced at Brody, whose face was ashen, and said indifferently,””If your son is Brody, then there’s no need to say anything. Even if Mr. Xia accepts your apology, I won’t be soft – hearted!”

After hearing this, Robinson’s legs went weak, and he sat on the ground in despair. His eyes were completely devoid of their former vigor.

Zheng Peng and Brody didn’t even dare to approach Tang Yitian’s car. They only dared to stand far away.

Zheng Peng’s father, Zheng Daming, was also trembling with fear. He urged his family to curry favor with Robinson and seek cooperation with the Golden Oak winery. Their strength was naturally even worse. Robinson was so embarrassed in front of Tang Yitian, so how could Zheng Daming and Luo LiMei remain calm?

However, it was related to the life and death of the winery that he had bet all his assets on. Although Zheng Daming was scared to death in his heart, he still mustered up the courage to come forward.

However, Zheng Daming played a little trick. He directly walked to the window on Xia ruofei’s side so that he didn’t have to face the terrifying Tang Yitian directly.

However, Zheng Daming didn’t know that Xia ruofei was much more terrifying than Tang Yitian.

Zheng Daming nodded and bowed to Xia ruofei with a flattering smile. He said in Chinese,””Hello, Mr. Xia. Let me introduce myself. I’m the owner of Wilkinson winery. My name is Zheng Daming, and I’m ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”I know you’re Zheng Peng’s father. If you’re here to plead for him, don’t waste your time. If I were you, I wouldn’t come here to do such a useless thing. Instead, I would look for a suitable buyer to reduce the loss.”

Zheng Daming’s face slightly changed, and a resentful look flashed in his eyes. He quickly lowered his posture and said,”Mr. Xia, I know that Zheng Peng has offended you, but young people don’t think before doing things. Please do us a favor and give us a chance to turn over a new leaf!”

Xia ruofei glanced at Zheng Daming indifferently. Zheng Daming’s eyes could not escape his eyes, so Xia ruofei’s impression of Zheng Daming was even worse.

“Sir, let’s go!” Xia ruofei said to the driver.

Zheng Daming’s expression changed drastically. He knew that if Xia ruofei refused to give in, the Mei ya group would not stop suppressing him. Then, the only way out was to sell the winery at a low price.

He had been operating in Australia for so many years, and he had transferred all his assets in the country. If he were to sell the winery at this time, even if someone was willing to buy it, they would definitely lower the price. What happened at the reception was right under everyone’s eyes, and everyone knew the predicament that Wilkinson winery was facing.

This was a result that Zheng Daming was unwilling to accept no matter what.

At this time, the Bentley had already started moving slowly. Zheng Daming grabbed the window in a hurry and said,””Mr. Xia, please have mercy ...”

Xia ruofei didn’t move, but Zheng Daming felt the car window suddenly become like an electric current, and his hands were suddenly bounced off.

At this time, Zheng Peng’s mother, Luo LiMei, couldn’t hold it in anymore. She shouted to Xia ruofei in the car,””You’re too overbearing! Even if Zheng Peng was disrespectful to you, you don’t have to be so ruthless! We’re all Chinese, and we should help each other when we’re abroad. Is this how you treat your own people? Cold – blooded!”

Zheng Daming quickly scolded,”Li Mei!” What nonsense are you spouting!”

“Where did I spout nonsense? It’s true!” Luo LiMei said, not convinced.

“You’re a woman, what do I know!” Zheng Daming was so angry that he started to scold,”don’t add to my troubles!”

Then, Zheng Daming quickly took two steps forward and said to Xia ruofei,””Mr. Xia, my wife is brainless, please don’t take it to heart ...”

The car had already started, but after hearing Luo LiMei’s words, Xia ruofei said to the driver,””Stop the car!”

After the car stopped, Xia ruofei opened the door.

“Mr. Xia, you don’t need to pay attention to these small characters ...” Tang Yitian quickly said.

“It’s fine, I’ll leave after a few words!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Then, he got out of the car and walked to Luo LiMei.

Just now, Luo LiMei had said those words in a fit of anger. Now that Xia ruofei had really gotten out of the car and come to her, her courage had disappeared.

Her thin lips trembled slightly as she said,””You ... What do you want? I’m telling you, hitting someone is illegal!”

“What did you just say?” Xia ruofei curled his lips and smiled.

“Am I wrong?” Luo LiMei raised her chin and said,”we’re all descendants of Yan Huang. Isn’t it a bit too much for you to kill us all? even if Zheng Peng made a mistake, don’t you want to give him a chance to correct it?”

Xia ruofei said coldly,”there are some mistakes that you have to pay for.” If everyone had the chance to change, there wouldn’t be those people who went to jail or even got shot ...”

Luo LiMei couldn’t help but be speechless. Her lips moved a few times, but in the end, she didn’t say anything.

Xia ruofei pointed at Zheng Peng, who was not far away, and said coldly,””You said that I don’t care about our friendship. Have you ever asked what your son has done? Coveting my female companion’s beauty and ridiculing me ... That’s nothing. He’s deliberately trying to sow discord and have that foolish Brodie come over to threaten me. Does he even care about our friendship?”

Luo LiMei couldn’t think of any rebuttal at all.

Zheng Daming’s heart almost stopped beating when he heard it. He didn’t expect that his son’s so – called little conflict was actually related to women.

Young people loved their face the most. No wonder the other party was so persistent when his woman was snatched away in front of him.

Zheng Daming thought so in his heart.

He quickly said,”Mr. Xia, it’s all my fault. That bastard Zheng Peng would do such a thing!” Please be magnanimous and give us a chance to turn over a new leaf! It’s not easy for us to come out of our country to make a living! We’ve invested most of our lives into the winery. If it goes bankrupt, our family will have to go out and beg ...”

Xia ruofei heard Zheng Daming’s pitiful words and couldn’t help but sneer secretly.

Zheng Daming was obviously too exaggerated. The worst result was nothing more than losing a little money and transferring the winery. If that didn’t work, he would just settle in another country. How could he be begging on the streets?

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”I can let Zheng Peng off the hook for treating me like a clown, but I really despise his behavior!” That Wei nation Japanese man harassed his girlfriend, but not only did he not dare to stand up for his girlfriend, he even advised his girlfriend to serve that Japanese man! I think even if your winery goes bankrupt, Zheng Peng shouldn’t be unable to eat. He’s still qualified to be a pimp in the red – light District!”

Zheng Daming’s face couldn’t help but change as soon as he heard it. He glared at Zheng Peng and then said in a low voice,”Mr. Xia, I didn’t expect Zheng Peng to be such a bastard! I’ll definitely ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and interrupted Zheng Daming, saying,””You don’t have to say anything. I’ve already promised tan Lili that I’ll teach Zheng Peng a lesson that will leave a deep impression on him! I’ll put it this way! Even if I spare that idiot Brodie, I won’t let Zheng Peng go! That’s all I have to say, take care of yourself!”

After that, Xia ruofei no longer looked at Zheng Daming and Luo LiMei, who looked like they had lost their parents. He turned back to the car and said lightly,””Start the car!”

The Bentley started slowly and left Paradise Farm.

Robinson and Zheng Daming stood there in a daze, while Brodie and Zheng Peng stood far away, their hearts full of regret.

Unfortunately, there was no medicine for regret in this world.

With their character, even if they didn’t meet Xia ruofei, they would meet Wang Ruofei, li ruofei, and Zhang ruofei in the future. One day, they would learn their lesson.

After a long while, Zheng Daming let out a long sigh and said, “Let’s go! Go back and ask if anyone is willing to buy the winery ...”

“Is there really no other way?” Luo LiMei said unwillingly,”how can he be so capable when he’s so young? I think he’s giving the Meya group some benefits. Why don’t we also ...”

“Do you even have a brain? Didn’t you see how polite Tang Yitian was to him?” Zheng Daming said unhappily,”what do you think we can give Tang Yitian? He wouldn’t be moved even if I gave him the entire winery ...”

“But ... But you can’t sell the winery now!” Luo LiMei said with a sad face,”the loss is too great ...” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“What can I do if I don’t sell it? Maya supermarket has taken them all down, and our wine is all unsalvageable. We’ll run out of funds soon!” Zheng Daming said,”it’s all your fault. You’ve been spoiling that little rascal since he was young. Now, he’s in trouble!”

Luo LiMei didn’t dare to refute, so she cried and followed Zheng Daming.

Soon, the two families left Paradise Farm in their cars.

In the face of a behemoth like the Maya Group, a winery of such a scale had no ability to resist at all. The only thing they could do was to hurry up and find a seller.

In particular, Zheng Daming still had some rich friends in China. Now, rich people were popular in purchasing foreign products, so he couldn’t wait to contact those friends on the way to see who had the intention to buy.

Robinson also began to call his friends in the circle, hoping to sell Golden Oak Farm.

Of course, in their situation, the price would definitely be lowered.

A few days ago, Robinson had taken advantage of old Wester’s urgent need for money to lower the price and try to buy West Winery at a low price.

It had only been a few days, and everything was reversed. Now, he was facing the same situation as Old West, or even worse.

This was truly the cycle of heaven and earth, karma!
