The alcohol he had drunk in the afternoon had long since been washed clean after the ridiculous battle in the afternoon. Hence, Xia ruofei naturally did not need to find a designated driver and drove straight back to Taoyuan farm. When they reached home, the sky was already dark. Cao tieshu and the other workers had just finished work and were walking out. When they saw Xia ruofei and the others, they greeted them. Although Xia ruofei did not get out of the car, he also lowered the window and smiled at them. It could be seen that each of these workers ‘faces was brimming with a happy smile. It was obvious that they were very comfortable working on Taoyuan farm. The treatment here was good. Although the work was not particularly easy, the work in the modern constant temperature greenhouse was far simpler than the work in the countryside. Moreover, the boss did not put on airs, and the benefits for the Chinese New Year and other festivals were also very good, so these workers all had a sense of belonging. Xia ruofei had finally bid farewell to his “Virgin life” today and was in a good mood. He waved to the workers and hummed a song as he drove towards the villa. When the car drove into the villa’s courtyard, Xia ruofei saw ye Lingyun and Li Zhifu standing there. Ye Lingyun was holding a large dustpan with both hands and shaking it like a gust of wind. Li Zhifu was giving instructions from time to time. After Xia ruofei parked the car, he walked over curiously. Ye Lingyun immediately stopped when he saw Xia ruofei and shouted,””Brother Xia, you’re back!” “What’s this for?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile. “Oh, the teacher is teaching me how to shake the green!” Ye linyun replied. Shaking green was a process in the making of rock tea. By shaking the green leaves, the leaves would constantly collide and rub against each other, causing the edge of the leaves to gradually damage and deepen evenly. After fermentation and oxidation, a green base and red rim would be produced. Xia ruofei had been listening to li Zhifu’s lessons on making tea and knew that this was an important process. Nowadays, many tea factories used the shaking machine to mass produce tea, but traditional tea – making craftsmen like li Zhifu insisted on shaking the tea by hand. Because no matter how well a machine simulated it, it still relied on a built – in program to execute it mechanically. In fact, the shaking process was first light then heavy. The shaking time was first short then long, and the setting time was first short then long. However, the seemingly simple steps were very knowledgeable. The best tea – making master would decide the next shaking time, the weight, and the setting time according to the changes in the tea Green. This was completely based on experience, and the machine could not simulate it at all. Only by hand could this step be done to the extreme. Xia ruofei did not pay much attention to ye Lingyun these few days. It seemed that his learning progress was quite fast. Xia ruofei looked up at the big dustpan in ye Lingyun’s hand and realized that it was not green tea, but wintersweet leaves that could be seen everywhere in the mountains. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be stunned. He asked,””Mr. Li, you’re just using these leaves for Ling Yun to practice?” Li Zhifu put on an enigmatic expression and said,””Little ye is still a beginner and is mainly practicing his techniques. Using leaves is enough. It’s a waste to let him practice with Tea Green! Besides, there are very few people who grow tea in the three mountains. Where can I find tea Green?” “You’re right ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile,”but if you need, I can arrange for someone to transport some tea leaves from Anxi.” Anxi was also a tea – producing area, and the Tieguanyin tea leaves it produced were well – known across the country. Although it was a different species from the rock tea of Mount Wu Yi, the tea leaves were far better to practice than these ordinary leaves. Moreover, an Xi was close to Sanshan city, so it was relatively convenient to purchase tea leaves from there, but it would cost a lot. However, in order for ye Lingyun to master his tea – making skills, Xia ruofei would naturally spare no expense. “I’ll tell you if I need it in a few days,”said li Zhifu with a nod. I’ll use the leaves first! “When I was young, I learned how to make tea with an old master. I also started with leaves. At that time, the old master even asked me to shake ordinary leaves to show the effect of green with red edges. Xiao Ye still has a long way to go!” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but click his tongue and think about the oxidation effect of the tea Green from shaking ordinary leaves. This was even more difficult than shaking the tea Green directly. It must be done with a very strong hand and extremely keen observation. It seemed that ye Lingyun was going to have a hard time. However, the more strict li Zhifu’s requirements were, the happier Xia ruofei was. Only by striving for perfection could he make tea leaves that were different from the rest! In the future, Xia ruofei would have to rely on ye Lingyun to make a top – grade Da Hong Pao for him. How could he not have good skills? Fortunately, ye Lingyun had trained in the Army for a few years and was very tough. Most people would lose their patience very quickly in such a physically exhausting and boring practice. If it were pang Hao, he would probably be tired after shaking it a few times. However, ye linyun was still very calm, and his eyes were filled with determination. Xia ruofei patted ye Lingyun’s shoulder and said,””Ling Yun, it’s a rare opportunity for old Mr. Li to personally teach you how to make tea. You have to practice diligently!” “I will. Don’t worry, brother Xia!” Ye linyun said. Then, he said to li Zhifu,”teacher, can I apply for a few minutes of rest?” I have something to discuss with brother Xia. ” After all, Xia ruofei was the owner of this place, so li Zhifu had to give him face. Although he looked a little unhappy, he still nodded in agreement.
