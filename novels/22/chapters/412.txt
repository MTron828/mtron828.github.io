Chapter 413: Save me (1)

At this moment, there were already three empty glasses in front of Lu You. She was holding her fourth glass of wine and drinking slowly. She felt that the noisy world in front of her was not so annoying. Under the influence of alcohol, the world in her eyes became a little blurred and dreamy.

The lingering worries had also disappeared at this moment.

She had long gotten used to the strong rum, and the frequency of her drinking was getting faster and faster, taking more and more big mouthfuls.

At this moment, a rough voice sounded,””Miss, our boss would like to invite you for a drink.”

Lu You didn’t even turn around and said coldly,””Get lost!”

She couldn’t remember how many people had come to hit on her tonight. When dealing with these people, she would, without exception, tell them to get lost.

Groups of people came up to strike up a conversation with her and then backed off. Lu You was already used to this kind of atmosphere in the bar.

But this time, this person was different from the others. After Lu You scolded him, not only did he not walk away, but he took a step closer and said,””Young miss, you’d better be obedient. Don’t refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit.”

Lu You suddenly felt a sense of danger. She turned her head and saw the burly man beside her staring at her with a burning gaze. He did not hide his dominance at all. Furthermore, the few customers beside her, including the bartender at the bar counter, had all disappeared. It was as if she had become a vacuum.

Lu You’s drunkenness was reduced by half. She said coldly to the burly man,””Quickly go away! Otherwise, I’ll call the police!”

“It seems that the young lady has chosen to drink the wine of punishment ...” The burly man’s mouth twitched, revealing a mocking smile.

Then, he came forward and grabbed Lu You’s wrist.

A hint of panic appeared on Lu You’s face. People would react subconsciously when they were panicking. Lu You’s subconscious reaction was to pull hard and then raise her leg to kick him.

Lu You did not realize that the speed and strength of her kick were stronger than before. In fact, the medicine that Xia ruofei had given her to treat her ‘aunt’s pain’ contained the petals of the spirit Heart Flower. Not only did the petals cure her period pain, but it also improved her physical condition.

Although this improvement wasn’t very obvious, Lu You was able to burst out with much more strength than usual under such a tense situation.

The burly man was also caught off guard. He didn’t expect Lu You’s kick to be so fast, and he couldn’t Dodge it in time.

Moreover, Lu You was wearing leather boots today. The sharp and Hard Leather Boots kicked the burly man’s crotch heavily. This was also the most vulnerable part of a man’s body. The burly man immediately let out a blood – curdling scream and released his hand that was holding onto Lu You’s wrist. He covered his lower body and arched his body like a prawn.

Lu You quickly took the opportunity to grab her handbag and escape.

However, she had only run two steps when she realized that several burly men were surrounding her from the entrance. The road had been blocked.

Lu You hurriedly changed direction and rushed into a room in a panic. Then, she locked the door tightly.

“Ah!”

“F * ck ...”

Lu You heard a few screams and turned around. It was only then that she realized that she had actually rushed into the men’s bathroom. A few men who were relieving themselves were shocked by this beautiful woman who had suddenly barged in. Their hands trembled and they peed in their pants.

Lu You also shrieked and turned around with her face and ears red.

However, she didn’t dare to go out. There were already noisy footsteps coming from outside, and soon, someone started to knock on the door.

Lu You couldn’t be bothered with the few men in the bathroom who looked embarrassed. She quickly took out her phone from her handbag.

At such a critical moment, the first figure that appeared in her mind was not her mother, Tian Huilan, who was a Provincial Minister, but Xia ruofei.

Lu You found Xia ruofei’s number and dialed it without hesitation.

At this moment, the bathroom door was slammed loudly. Lu You held the door tightly while shouting in her heart,”Quickly pick up the phone, quickly pick up the phone ...

However, the bell rang again and again, but there was no response. Lu You’s heart gradually sank to the bottom, and she revealed a bitter expression on her face. It seems like he’s really angry with me. He’s not even picking up my calls ...

The phone beeped,”no one is picking up.” Lu You slowly felt a sense of despair. The force of the door slamming was getting stronger and stronger, and she was almost unable to hold on.

Lu You gritted her teeth and used all her strength to push against the door. She opened her WeChat and sent a message to Xia ruofei with trembling hands.”Midnight Dream bar, save me ...”

Lu You had just sent this message when she felt a huge force coming at her. She could not hold on any longer. She was pushed forward and staggered a few steps before falling to the ground.

The bathroom door was also knocked open, and seven or eight burly Men in Black rushed in.

The burly man who had gone to look for Lu You first was among them. He looked at Lu You with a ferocious expression and shouted,””Little bitch! You actually dared to kick me ...”

After saying that, he walked in front of Lu You in a somewhat strange posture. It was obvious that he had kicked Lu You hard just now, and he had not fully recovered yet.

Lu You gritted her teeth and looked at the burly man with hatred.

“You still dare to stare at me! I’ll beat you to death ...”

That burly man raised his hand and slapped Lu You’s face. This burly man’s attack was filled with hatred. If it hit, Lu You’s face would definitely swell up.

However, before this slap could land on Lu You, it was blocked by a hand.

One of the men in Black said coldly,””Ah li, this is the woman that master Luo has his eyes on. You beat her up so badly that her face is swollen. How is master Luo going to use her tonight?”

The burly man couldn’t help but tremble and quickly said,””I’m sorry, brother Hu, I was wrong ...”

Brother Tiger let go of ah Li’s hand gently and squatted down in front of Lu You.””Miss, our boss just wants to be friends with you. You don’t have to be so nervous.”

Lu You snorted coldly and turned her face away, not saying anything. She had heard what brother Hu had said just now. Naturally, she would not be so naive as to think that he really just wanted to be friends with her.

Brother Tiger looked at Lu You coldly, then stood up and said,””Please invite this lady upstairs!”

“Yes, brother Hu!”

A few burly men immediately came forward, picked Lu You up, and dragged her out of the bathroom.

Lu You struggled with all her might and shouted,””Help! Help me!”

The few men in the bathroom were so scared that they didn’t even dare to breathe. They watched helplessly as Lu You was taken away. No one dared to come forward to help.

No matter how much Lu You struggled, she was no match for a few strong and burly men. She was quickly dragged out of the bathroom by them.

……

Tao Yuan farm, villa.

Xia ruofei’s room was very quiet. The spirit painting was placed on his bed quietly. The phone on the bedside table vibrated for a while before it went silent again.

Xia ruofei was playing with Blackie and the rest in the new space. Today, he felt very stuffy, as if there was a knot that could not be released. So, after a quick dinner, he entered the new space, wanting to relax in the spirit map space that was rich in spiritual Qi.

However, Xia ruofei still felt uneasy. As a Special Forces elite, his sixth sense was stronger than the average person ‘S. He had a feeling that something was about to happen.

Soon, Xia ruofei decided not to stay in the medium any longer. He returned to the outside world.

After keeping the painting in his body, Xia ruofei muttered to himself,””What’s wrong with you today?”

As he spoke, he picked up his phone from the bedside table.

Usually, Xia ruofei would not bring his phone into the realm since there was no signal there. Hence, he would check for missed calls and messages after he left the realm.

Xia ruofei saw a missed call from Lu You after he lit up the screen.

Xia ruofei furrowed his brows. He thought that Lu You wanted to explain to him what had happened today. However, to be honest, he didn’t want to hear Lu You’s explanation at all, so he naturally wouldn’t return her call.

Xia ruofei turned off the missed call notification. Just as he was about to keep his phone, he saw a red ” 1″ on the WeChat icon, indicating that there was a new unread message.

Hence, Xia ruofei opened his WeChat. This unread message was from Lu You.

Xia ruofei’s expression changed when he opened the call. His heart skipped a beat when he thought of the missed call. He grabbed his jacket, opened the door, and rushed downstairs.

Soon, the Knight XV let out a loud roar and rushed out of the villa, running wildly out of the farm. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Hong Tao, who was on duty at the entrance, opened the gate when he heard the sound of the engine. He immediately recognized the engine and knew that Xia ruofei was going out.

As soon as the door opened, Hong Tao seemed to see a black lightning bolt. When he came back to his senses, Knight XV had already rushed out of the farm, and a bend was not far in front of him. Hong Tao even saw the Knight XV’s heavy body make a drift amid the sharp friction sound of the tires, and then it lightly passed the bend and disappeared from his sight.

“Brother Xia, where are you going in such a hurry?” Hong Tao muttered to himself as he closed the farm gate.

On the highway around the city, Xia ruofei stepped on the gas pedal and controlled Knight XV to speed forward. At the same time, he searched for Midnight Dream bar on the car navigation system and set the route.

His brain was also spinning rapidly.

When he saw the message, it was two minutes after the message was sent. According to the planned route, it would take about half an hour to get to the midnight Dream bar from here to San Shan city. However, Xia ruofei ignored the traffic rules and drove at a special speed. He should be able to get there in fifteen to twenty minutes.

Xia ruofei did not dare to imagine what would happen in the middle of such a long period of time. He was a little anxious at the moment.

Xia ruofei knew that it was very likely that Lu You had gone to the bar to get drunk because of today’s incident. Although Xia ruofei was very angry with Lu You’s actions today, he would still feel very guilty if something had really happened to her.

Of course, they could not rule out the possibility that Lu You was lying. With miss Lu’s Princess – like temper, she might have used fake news to trick Xia ruofei into coming out.

However, Xia ruofei did not dare to take the risk. The only thing he could do now was to rush to the bar that Lu You had mentioned as fast as possible.

Fortunately, there was only one bar called zero point dream in the entire San Shan city. It was located by the North River, so there should not be a traffic jam on the way from San Huan road.

Xia ruofei’s face was ashen as he sped all the way. The speed – limit cameras along the way also flashed. After entering the city, Xia ruofei ran a few red lights in a row. There were a few times when he almost collided with other cars, but he dodged them all with his excellent driving skills and extraordinary reaction speed.

However, he estimated that after this, his driving license points would not be enough for the deduction.

18 minutes later, the Knight XV rushed to the entrance of the zero dream bar with a roar like a monster .
