Chapter 1771: Gao Jun’s invitation_1

Gao Jun was dumbfounded. Xia ruofei’s way of drinking really scared him.

Xia ruofei had already drunk more than half a liter of white wine before the toasts started. This was already the limit of most people’s alcohol tolerance, but Xia ruofei was still talking and laughing as if nothing had happened. His eyes were clear and he did not seem drunk at all.

Gao Jun had seen many people with good alcohol tolerance, but he had never seen someone like Xia ruofei.

Gao Jun had attended all kinds of dinner parties, and there was no lack of people who drank very freely, especially those professional Drinking Partners who were specially brought by some leaders to the dinner parties. They drank wine like it was water.

However, Gao Jun was very clear about this. Those who drank big glasses of white wine didn’t even blink their eyes. Some of them were given tasks by their leaders, and even if they couldn’t do it, they would still force themselves to do it. There were also some experienced drinkers who had all kinds of tricks, such as not swallowing the wine after drinking, but secretly spitting it into the towel while wiping their mouths. There were simply too many tricks.

Xia ruofei was the only person Gao Jun had seen in so many years who could finish more than a pound of white wine in such a short time without using any means. He was also calm and his eyes were clear.

When Xia ruofei proposed a toast, everyone would naturally give him face. Although Xia ruofei said that everyone could do as they pleased, he had already finished half a catty of white wine in one gulp. Who would really be at ease?

Therefore, everyone, including Gao Jun, finished a small glass of white wine very quickly.

Xia ruofei then sat down, picked up his chopsticks, and ate his first dish since coming to this room.

After Xia ruofei chewed and swallowed the fried eel, he said,””Brother Zhao, Gao tai, since we’re going to work with the Jie Ji group, is there anything we need to do in the early stages?”

Gao Jun smiled and said,”in short, we need a mushroom house. It’s the standard of our show. There’s also an auxiliary building. It’s mainly for the equipment and staff.”

Zhao Yongjun added,”I’ve talked to Yifan about this today. He’ll prioritize the design of the two buildings needed for the show. Later, the festival team will send someone to communicate with Yifan. Yifan has already agreed to integrate the mushroom house design into the overall design of the club. This way, after the show is done recording, these two buildings will continue to be kept.”

Xia ruofei nodded.”That’s good. I’m just afraid that this will cause unnecessary trouble for the club.”

“Don’t worry, President Xia,” Gao Jun said.”We’ll definitely communicate with each other and make sure that we won’t delay each other.”

Xia ruofei had some doubts and asked,”Gao tai, forgive me for being direct!” Wouldn’t the recording of this program last for at least one to three months? Wouldn’t the clubhouse’s construction be affected? It couldn’t be that the background of the camera was a busy construction site, right? Then what about village life? It’s all reinforced concrete ...”

Gao Jun chuckled.”Mr. Xia, you may not know this, but the camera is only showing part of the area. The construction of the other areas will not be affected. As long as we schedule it properly, the club’s construction period will not be delayed.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Gao Jun paused for a moment before continuing.”Also, we’ll try to integrate the design of the program with the design of the club. For example, we’ll choose the green space in the club for growing vegetables. After the program is recorded, it’ll be easy to transform it.” Also, I’m planning to use a net to mark out an area by the lake for the jiumo group to raise fish. These facilities can be retained for the club in the future. ”

Song Rui said with a smile,””Ruofei, don’t worry. The platform has been doing variety shows for so many years. Whatever you can think of, they’ve already thought of it. In short, you just need to know that bringing in this show will not affect the club’s construction progress. It’s a win – win situation for both sides. That’s all!”

“Alright then!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I really don’t have any experience in this area. I’m sorry to have embarrassed myself ...”

Gao Jun smiled.”You’re too kind, director Xia. Our program’s production and venue’s interests are the same. As long as everything is discussed in advance and we communicate and understand each other during the recording process, I believe there won’t be any problems! I’ll also talk to the show’s producer and director. They’ll fully respect your opinions and won’t make any unreasonable requests!”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei was completely relieved. Although Gao Jun was very humble in front of them, he was the absolute boss in xiangnan TV’s variety shows. After he had spoken to them, he believed that those kinds of requests made at the last minute, guests acting like big shots, and other bullsh * t things would not happen.

Gao Jun raised his glass and smiled at Xia ruofei.””President Xia, let me offer you a toast. Firstly, I wish us a happy cooperation; Secondly, I would like to thank you for your support!”

Xia ruofei said,”you’re too polite. I’ll be embarrassed if you continue to support me!”

After Xia ruofei finished speaking, he raised his glass at Gao Jun and drank it.

This time, he used a small white wine glass.

Gao Jun also drank a glass and then said excitedly,””Director Xia, I have some ideas for the next season of life I yearn for. I hope you can support me!”
