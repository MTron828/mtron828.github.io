Chapter 1508: A rare treasure (2)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment and said,”there’s a treasure hidden on the Mirage beast?” Why didn’t I see it? But I can’t get my military dagger back ...”

Xia ruofei’s military dagger was a spoil of war from his mission. It had been with him for many years. When the magical beast came out of the cave, it did not bring the dagger with it. It must have been taken down by the magical beast after it returned to the cave.

The cave was so small that Xia ruofei would not be able to retrieve his military dagger if it was in there. He felt that it was a pity.

“Master,” Xia Qing said with a smile,”if the magical beast didn’t have any treasures on it, why would I call you over to hunt it?”

“Isn’t it for revenge?” Xia ruofei laughed and asked,”I remember now. Just now, you said that killing the magical beast would be good for me. Now that the magical beast has been killed, tell me what the good is! Don’t keep me in suspense!”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing said,”didn’t I just remind master not to hit its head? The beast’s treasure is in its head, master, please cut its head open!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said.

He took out a saber from the spirit map space. Although the military dagger was lost, there were still a few sabers in the space.

The body of the dead magical beast was not completely stiff, so Xia ruofei easily cut open the beast’s head.

“Master, you need to find a piece of the skull.” Xia Qing said,”it’s very different from ordinary skulls and is easy to distinguish. There are many natural Dao patterns on this skull. It’s a pity that this illusionary beast is only at the three – tailed realm. If it was nine – tailed, that Dao pattern would be even more precious ...”

Xia ruofei rolled his eyes and said,”if it was nine – tailed, would I still be alive?”

“That’s true!” Xia Qing said with a smile.

With Xia Qing’s guidance, Xia ruofei’s efficiency was naturally very high. Of course, it was also because the skull’s target was very obvious. Very quickly, he found the skull with the natural Dao pattern.

In order to find it, Xia ruofei had to search for it, and his hands were covered with blue blood.

He placed the Dao bone of the illusionary beast to the side and took out a bucket filled with spirit pond water from his space. He first washed his hands and then placed the Dao bone into the bucket to wash it.

After pouring the water away and putting the bucket back into the medium, Xia ruofei took the Taoist bone and asked,””Xia Qing, what is the use of this skull? To think that you would call it a treasure!”

“Master, you can use your spiritual power to sense those Dao patterns and you’ll know,” Xia Qing said with a smile.

“So mysterious ...” Xia ruofei mumbled as he released his spiritual power.

“Eh?” Xia ruofei could not help but raise his eyebrows.

When his mind power came into contact with the natural Dao patterns, he immediately felt a mysterious aura blowing in his face. He couldn’t help but immerse himself in these mysterious patterns.

After a long time, Xia ruofei finally broke away from this mysterious state. He suddenly realized that his realm had increased by another level and was very close to Qi disciple Level 6.

“So magical! My cultivation has obviously improved!” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but exclaim.

He wasn’t in a state of cultivation at all just now. He was just sensing those Dao patterns, and it actually increased his cultivation. This was simply unheard of.

“Master, the improvement in cultivation is only a small aspect.” Xia Qing laughed and said,”this Mirage beast’s Dao bone is naturally passed down. It will be very helpful for your comprehension of the array Dao if you study it frequently.”

Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat. Soon, he realized that his understanding of array Dao had improved by quite a bit, especially in the illusion array Dao. It was a whole lot higher than before.

The knowledge of arrays had been transferred to Xia ruofei’s mind through the Jade talisman of inheritance. Although he did not need to spend much effort to digest all these insights, he now felt that his understanding of arrays had always been very shallow. Many parts that he did not understand before had suddenly become clear.

Xia ruofei even felt that he could easily set up an illusion array now. If the quality of the materials was good enough, the power would not be low.

“It’s really a treasure!” Xia ruofei said.

“Master, you can take out this Dao bone of the illusionary beast frequently to comprehend.” Xia Qing said,”not only will it be helpful to your array Dao cultivation, but it will also be of great help to your cultivation comprehension.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”got it!” Xia Qing, it’s all thanks to your profound knowledge, or else I would have missed out on this treasure!”

Xia ruofei had the urge to sit down and comprehend it again. The feeling of being completely immersed in the natural Dao pattern was wonderful.

However, he also knew that the most important thing now was to find Song Wei. Thus, he endured his reluctance and put the Dao bone into the spirit map space to store it properly.

This trip to xiangnan province had been full of twists and turns. However, after obtaining this Dao bone of an illusionary beast and not finding a single world stone, Xia ruofei felt that this trip had not been in vain.

Xia ruofei continued to explore in the dark.

This corridor was different from the previous one. Although it was dark, there were not many forks and turns. Xia ruofei just walked in one direction.

Unconsciously, Xia ruofei felt that the darkness around him seemed to have lightened. At first, he thought it was an illusion. When he put the lighter away and closed his eyes for a while, he opened them again and slowly raised his hand.

Sure enough, he found that he could see a faint outline of Yingying’s face. It had been completely dark just now, and he couldn’t even see his fingers.

Xia ruofei decided not to use the lighter to light up the place and continued to walk forward.

Because the suppression of his spiritual power was much weaker now, he could still release his spiritual power to explore the way, so he could still see the way.

After moving forward for a while, Xia ruofei realized that the darkness had faded. Now, he could vaguely see his own legs.

Although he did not find the source of the light, Xia ruofei felt that it was getting brighter as they walked. This meant that they should be out of the dark environment soon.

Just like that, Xia ruofei walked forward for a full half an hour. The environment was not dark anymore. It was a little like an evening environment where one could see the road clearly, but it was not the kind where the sun was shining.

Just as Xia ruofei quickened his pace, he suddenly felt a strong gust of wind.

At the same time, Xia Qing also reminded him,””Master, be careful!”

In fact, Xia ruofei had already sensed the danger, so he dodged to the side at once. A flash of light flashed in front of his eyes. If he had reacted half a second slower, he would have been beheaded.

Xia ruofei finally saw clearly. A big man in ancient clothes was holding a ghost head blade. He came out of nowhere and launched a fierce attack without saying a word.

“Master, that’s a puppet!” Xia Qing reminded him,”you must be careful!”

Xia ruofei’s expression couldn’t help but turn serious. Fortunately, Xia Qing had warned him. Otherwise, this puppet that could pass off as the real one would really be in danger.

After all, if it was a human, some attacks could be fatal, such as the heart. However, puppets were different. Their chests were not necessarily their fatal spots.

If Xia ruofei had heaved a sigh of relief after hitting its heart, he might have been in danger of death the next moment.

Xia ruofei didn’t dare to be slow. He held a dagger and rushed forward.

Compared to a human, a puppet’s agility was not as good. Xia ruofei fought with ease. The puppet’s attack seemed sharp, but it could not even touch Xia ruofei’s clothes.

Xia ruofei, on the other hand, quickly found an opportunity and stabbed the puppet’s heart.

If an ordinary person was stabbed in this part, they would definitely die on the spot.

However, the puppet was completely fine. It felt no pain or fear.

What was even more strange was that the puppet’s chest had been deeply pierced by a knife, but not even a drop of blood flowed out. There was only a shocking wound.

“Master, try to break his head!” Xia Qing said. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Understood!” Xia ruofei said calmly.

He continued to fight with the puppet, relying on his agile movements to move around the puppet. In the blink of an eye, the puppet had been hit many times, but its combat power had not decreased at all.

Just as Xia ruofei was about to stab the puppet for the fifth time, a pistol suddenly appeared in his hand when he was close to the puppet.

Xia ruofei pointed the gun at the puppet’s temple and pulled the trigger ...
