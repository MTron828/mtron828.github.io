Chapter 234: Chapter 230 – 1

“Chief, it’s just a small token of my appreciation.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I wanted to bring it the last time I went to Hongzhou, but I thought that your body wasn’t in good condition at that time. It was too weak to be nourished! That’s why I didn’t take it that time. But it’s more suitable for you to take it now. It’ll be very helpful for your recovery. ” “No, Dr. Xia, this gift is too expensive. We can’t accept it.” Song Zhengping said. Song Zhilan also hurriedly said,”doctor Xia, your wild ginseng is indeed very good for my father’s health. However, it’s really too expensive. How about this ... We’ll buy it from you. Is that okay?” At this time, eccentric song’s face darkened.”Zhilan, what are you saying?” Song Zhilan was stunned and said,”dad ...” “Xiao Xia is showing his kind intentions, yet you’re actually talking about money with him?” Elder song frowned and said,”can money buy such wild ginseng?” Song Zhilan was confused. She didn’t know what elder song meant, so she could only pretend to accept it. Master Song smiled at Xia ruofei and said,””Little Xia, since you gave it to me, I’ll make an exception and accept it. Thank you! But there’s no next time, and you’re not allowed to give such expensive gifts in the future!” “You’re welcome, chief. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I promise to carry out your orders. I will come empty – handed in the future!” “It’s right to come empty – handed!”Elder song laughed. I don’t lack anything!” Song Zhengping and song Zhilan were both stunned, their mouths slightly agape. Elder song had been incorruptible all his life and had never accepted gifts from others, let alone such a precious wild ginseng. Moreover, they knew very well that elder song wouldn’t be greedy just because he saw something valuable. In fact, with elder song’s status, as long as he needed it to maintain his body, even if it was a wild ginseng that was older than this year, the song family could get it, but it would take a lot of effort. As for the value, as the head of the song family, he naturally wouldn’t care about a few million. Accepting this wild ginseng would mean that the song family would owe Xia ruofei a favor. It seemed that elder song didn’t care about this. What did this mean? Obviously, elder song had changed his opinion of Xia ruofei. If he didn’t have a good impression of him, he wouldn’t even care about a gift that was ten times more expensive. Elder song looked at song Zhengping and his sister and said,””What are you all doing? Put the things away! Oh right, tell the kitchen to prepare a few more dishes for lunch. Xiao Xia will stay for lunch later. ” “Oh ... Okay!” Song Zhilan quickly said. She glanced at Xia ruofei again before keeping the wild ginseng and leaving elder song’s room. In the afternoon, elder song hosted a banquet for Xia ruofei. Since Xia ruofei had to drive and elder song was suffering from liver cancer, neither of them could drink alcohol. Therefore, everyone had to drink plain water. However, song Zhengping, his sister, and manager Lu personally toasted Xia ruofei with their drinks and were very enthusiastic about him. After lunch, elder song took a dose of Chinese medicine and was ready to rest. Xia ruofei also bid him farewell. Song Zhengping personally sent Xia ruofei downstairs. “Xia, I’ll be returning to xiangnan province in the afternoon. I’ll have to trouble you to take care of my father.” Song Zhengping said in a friendly manner. After elder song accepted Xia ruofei’s wild ginseng, song Zhengping naturally changed his address of Xia ruofei from “doctor Xia” to “little Xia.” It was a small change of address, but it also reflected the change in Xia ruofei’s position in the governor’s heart. Song Zhengping treated Xia ruofei as one of his own. Xia ruofei smiled.”Don’t worry, Chief Judge song. The chief’s body is fine now. I estimate that he will be fully recovered after one or two months of recuperation.” “Yeah!” Song Zhengping smiled and nodded. By the way, song Rui will be staying in the southeast province for a while and will be in charge of part of the family business. You two can help each other out. If you have any difficulties in the business, you can go to him directly. If it’s something that involves the system, you can just look for Huilan. You’re already familiar with her anyway. ” Song Zhengping said that they would help each other out, but in reality, the song family did not need Xia ruofei’s help. At least, song Zhengping didn’t think it was necessary. He was actually trying to get on Xia ruofei’s good side and hint that the song family could help Xia ruofei when he needed it. “Okay, thank you, Chief Judge song.” Xia ruofei said. Then, he asked curiously,”by the way, isn’t song Rui always by your side? Why did you suddenly let him stay in the southeast province?” “That kid took the initiative to apply for it!” Song Zhengping said. I know what he’s thinking, he just doesn’t want to be controlled by me! However, he was already in his twenties and it was time for him to train! Besides, the old man will be staying in the southeast province for the time being, and we can’t stay here for long. Some of the younger generation are studying abroad, and some are in the government. This kid is the only idle one, so it’s good to let him stay here to accompany the old man. ” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded in understanding. Song Zhengping added,”that little rascal of mine can’t compare to you. He’ll definitely cause trouble when I’m not around. If possible, help me keep an eye on him. If it’s too outrageous, give me a call. You have my personal number.” “Alright!” Xia ruofei agreed with a smile. However, song Zhengping only mentioned it briefly. He knew that Xia ruofei was on good terms with song Rui. He could not count on Xia ruofei to tell on him. Fortunately, he had arranged for people to protect song Rui, and he naturally had eyes and ears in the southeast Branch of his family’s business, Huatian group. Basically, song Rui’s every move could not escape from the palm of his hand. After chatting with song Zhengping for a while, Xia ruofei bade him farewell and drove away from the Gu Ling courtyard. …… Xia ruofei stayed in the farm for the next two days. On the fourth day, manager li came up with the design plan. He did his best and probably stayed up for a few nights. When Xia ruofei saw him, he had dark circles under his eyes and they were red. There were two alternatives. Xia ruofei looked at the estimated cost and found that they were both about six million. The cost of civil engineering was about 900 Yuan per square meter. There were also other works such as decoration, water drainage, Electrical Engineering, and installation. All of them added up to less than 2000 Yuan per square meter. The cost of labor and construction materials had been soaring in recent years. Xia ruofei did a rough estimation and knew that the cost was basically the cost price. There was not much money to be earned even if he finished everything. Xia ruofei was naturally very satisfied with the design plan. He had no problem with the price. At the moment, he definitely did not have enough cash, but he had a few hundred thousand in his account every month. In addition, he would be able to sell a piece of Phoebe zhennan material in a month’s time. By then, he would have another large sum of money. Thus, he had no problem with the money. Hence, Xia ruofei quickly picked a more pleasing design and decided. Manager li was also very efficient. The next day, the construction team was pulled into the field and the construction began in full swing. When the workers heard that the farm was going to build an office building, as well as their lunch break and duty room, they were all very excited. On the evening of the fifth day, Xia ruofei returned to his room early after dinner. He was going to the spirit map space today to cut down the largest Phoebe zhennan tree.
