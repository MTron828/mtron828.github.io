Chapter 1488: The array Dao inheritance_2

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei asked,”Xia Qing, you suggested that I take out the” earth “jade talisman because of the knowledge of arrays stored in it, right?”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing nodded. I believe that the tomb that master is about to head to isn’t as simple as an ordinary ancient tomb. Otherwise, it would be impossible for the world stone to appear. Furthermore, there’s also that cold material. It’s even more impossible for it to appear in an ordinary ancient tomb. In that kind of place, there’s a high chance that you’ll be able to use your knowledge of array Dao, so ...”

“I understand!” Xia ruofei smiled.”Let’s hope we don’t have to!” I just want to smoothly retrieve the world stone ...”

“As long as master has a thorough understanding of the array Dao in the Jade talisman, ordinary arrays will not be able to threaten master’s safety.” Xia Qing said.

Xia ruofei nodded. He extended his finger and used his spiritual energy to draw a few lines in the air. In one go, he drew a small rune.

When Xia ruofei drew the last stroke, a magical phenomenon occurred. The spiritual Qi around the rune, which was already in the form of fog, seemed to be moved by an invisible hand and gushed towards the rune.

In an instant, the fog rose and the fog waves rolled. The spiritual Qi around Xia ruofei increased in concentration. The spiritual Qi in the center of the rune was so dense that it had been compressed into a liquid state.

Xia Qing’s eyes narrowed, and she said with a smile,””A telepathic array, and it’s a small spirit gathering array that’s difficult to master. Master must have already mastered the knowledge of arrays.”

Xia ruofei waved his hand to break the small spirit gathering formation. He smiled and said,””As long as one can withstand the process of inheritance, anyone can easily master it.”

“But it’s not easy to be so skilled.” Xia Qing said,”this has a lot to do with master’s constant practice of unlocking runes.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”Xia Qing, I’m going out.” I’ll go to the scene tomorrow to check it out. I should be able to enter the tomb by tomorrow night at the earliest. By then, you have to keep an eye on the situation outside and remind me at all times!”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing said.

With a thought, Xia ruofei left the spirit map space in a flash and returned to his bedroom in the outside world.

Only a few minutes had passed in the outside world. Hence, Xia ruofei decided to “turn the act into reality”. He lay on the bed and slept for a while. He only woke up in the evening. After a simple wash up, he walked out of the bedroom.

Xia ruofei was watching TV in the living room when he heard the door open. Song Wei walked out.

“Did I wake you up?” Xia ruofei asked apologetically.

“I was going to get up anyway, how was your rest?” Song Wei smiled.

“Full health resurrection!” Xia ruofei laughed.”I feel like I’m in great condition!”

“That’s good!”Song Wei smiled. However, he decided to stay in the hotel tonight! If there’s anything, we can talk tomorrow!”

“En!” Xia ruofei nodded in agreement.

The two of them chatted for a while and went downstairs for dinner. They weren’t interested in looking for food on the streets, so they ordered a few dishes at the hotel restaurant and returned to their room after eating.

The two of them sat on the sofa in the living room. In front of them was the sketch that Song Wei had drawn during the day.

The drawing was divided into two parts, with Song Wei separating them with a line.

Song Wei pointed at the drawing and explained,”it’s a drawing of the inside of the tomb. Of course, it’s not complete. It only shows the place we’ve been to.”

Xia ruofei nodded and looked at the blueprint.

Although the structure of the tomb was simple, Song Wei had put in a lot of effort. The passages and chambers starting from the entrance were drawn very clearly, and there were even signs of beautiful handwriting on it.

Song Wei said,”we speculate that the tomb is very large. However, the inspection time was too short. Everyone retreated immediately after they felt uncomfortable. Therefore, the main chamber marked now may not be the main chamber of the tomb. There are still too many unknown areas that have not been explored.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”this means that this place might be an underground Palace ...”

“It’s very possible!” Song Wei said sternly,”so it’s not too late for you to give up on this idea now. There might be many unknown dangers ...” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Are you scared?” Xia ruofei asked, smiling.

Song Wei was stunned for a moment before she replied, “You’ll protect me, won’t you?”

“You trust me that much?” Xia ruofei laughed.”What if I can’t even protect myself?”

“Then I’ll admit it! In any case, I picked up my life!” Song Wei said,”it was a pity that I couldn’t continue to explore this ancient tomb at that time. The officials will definitely not take the risk again. Since you want to go in, I will definitely follow you!”

Xia ruofei stopped laughing and said seriously,””Song Wei, don’t worry. No matter what kind of danger we encounter, I will do my best to ensure your safety!”

“En!” Song Wei smiled. I believe you!”

The structure of the chamber was not complicated. Xia ruofei quickly memorized it and looked at the map below.

“This is the topographic map of the tomb. Of course, I drew it from my memory. I don’t know if it’s different from the real situation ...” Song Wei said.

This picture was the main point, as it was related to whether they could enter the tomb without anyone knowing.

Xia ruofei looked at the drawing seriously.

From the point of view of a Special Forces member, Song Wei’s drawing was no doubt unqualified. It was not drawn according to standard contours, but more like a sketch.

However, Song Wei was not a professional scout. It was already good enough that she could draw it this way. It was good enough that she could understand it.

In fact, Song Wei’s drawing was quite vivid. She probably had some drawing skills.

Song Wei pointed at the map and said,”the opening of the tomb was at this position. The base of our team was set up on a piece of flat land East of the entrance. There are two roads from the foot of the mountain to the top. One is barely enough for cars to walk on, but the road is very narrow and can’t be used to cross vehicles. The other road is on the side of King Yu’s temple. There is a small road leading to this side, but not many people are walking on it. The road is overgrown with weeds.”

She took a sip of water and continued,”after the incident, the gap was filled up immediately. The area was also thoroughly disinfected. However, the Armed Police Force responsible for security work stayed behind to guard it to prevent anyone from breaking in. As for the current situation, I’m not too sure.”

“We’ll find out when we check out the place tomorrow,”Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Mm! We’ll pretend to be mountain – climbing tourists!” Song Wei said with a smile. She felt a little excited.

She continued,”this area is the area of the underground tomb that we have explored. The dotted line is the area of the entire tomb that I have deduced. If we want to enter the tomb, we can’t enter from the original entrance. There must be someone guarding it, so we need to find another way. I hope this map will be helpful to you!”

“It’s very useful!” Xia ruofei said,”Song Wei, thank you!”

Song Wei blushed and said,”Why are you suddenly so polite?”

Xia ruofei laughed.”You’ve helped me so much. What’s the big deal with me saying thank you?”

“I still don’t know if it’ll work!” Song Wei said,”besides, you’ve saved my life. Should I keep thanking you?”

Xia ruofei suddenly felt that he couldn’t handle it and quickly said,””Alright, alright, alright, then let’s not stand on ceremony!”

The two of them chatted for a while about the details of their trip the next day. After that, they both felt that it was a little awkward for a man and a woman to be alone in the same room, so they tacitly returned to their rooms to rest.

It was a quiet night.

The next day, after breakfast, Xia ruofei brought Song Wei along and drove straight to Mount Yu.

As a famous local attraction, people often went to climb mountains. Occasionally, there would be tourists from other places, so Xia ruofei and Song Wei, who were dressed in outdoor clothes, did not stand out.

When he reached the location of King Yu’s temple, Xia ruofei’s eyes revealed a hint of joy. He felt that the sensory Jade Leaf that was specially used to find the world stone seemed to have a little reaction ...
