Chapter 545: Sales volume increases explosively (2)

Li Jing was dumbfounded and only reacted after a long time. He quickly said,””No problem, no problem! Manager Chen, how many do you need?”

“If we have enough, give us 200 ... 300 boxes per store!” Deputy Manager Chen said,”you don’t have to go through so much trouble to send them one by one. I’ll send a car over to take them all at once!”

Deputy Manager Chen was in charge of the wine, and he had seen the sales miracle of the new Drunken Eight Immortals wine.

In the beginning, he really didn’t think much of this old brand that was on the verge of dying. However, he had received quite a lot of benefits from Li Jing, so he cleared an inconspicuous spot in the store for the new Drunken Eight Immortals.

In the first two days, the situation was just as he had predicted. Almost no one showed any interest.

However, after three to four days, the number of people who bought the new Drunken Eight Immortals gradually increased. Moreover, due to the location of the shelves being relatively remote, some customers who could not find it would even go to the shop assistant to ask for help.

And in the past two days, more and more people bought Drunken Eight Immortals.

Moreover, many people bought boxes of wine. A hundred boxes of wine in one store might sound like a lot, but it was sold out in less than ten days.

Moreover, there were many customers who came to ask if there was any new Drunken Eight Immortals white wine for sale.

Deputy Manager Chen was keenly aware of the extraordinary situation.

The Marketing Manager of a super – Business was like a boss in front of many suppliers, but this depended on the person. If a certain product was particularly good and could bring the manager outstanding performance, at the same time, if the product was lacking and they might lose customers, then the position would immediately be reversed.

Therefore, Deputy Manager Chen was no longer as high and mighty as he had been in the past.

Li Jing’s mind was in a daze. He couldn’t even remember how he had agreed to it. After hanging up the phone, he was still in a daze.

He felt that this world was too crazy.

Li Jing even pinched his own thigh hard. While he was grimacing in pain, he finally confirmed that he was not dreaming.

The new Drunken Eight Immortals seemed to be on fire!

However, new Drunken Eight Immortals seemed to feel that the shock was not enough. In the following period of time, Li Jing kept receiving calls from the marketing managers of some of the channels he had previously contacted, as well as the managers of some restaurants. All of them requested to increase the supply.

Even the people in charge of large supermarkets such as Walmart, who he couldn’t get into, personally called him. Everyone’s attitude had a 180 – degree change.

This included the various chain restaurants of Ling Ji restaurant. They also requested to increase their supply.

Manager li, who had run into walls everywhere and received a lot of cold looks, suddenly became a hot commodity.

In just half a day, the 30000 boxes in the inventory were reduced by 5000 boxes.

Although the 5000 boxes would not be sold out immediately, many channels saw that the new Drunken Eight Immortals was selling well, so they asked for more stock. It would definitely take time for the market to fully digest them. Even so, it was enough to make Li Jing dizzy from shock.

This result was completely beyond his imagination. Even in his dreams, he did not dare to think that new drunk Eight Immortals would suddenly become so popular, and that he, as a Sales Manager, would have such a moment of pride. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

This dream – like state reached its peak when Li Jing received a phone call.

To be honest, Li Jing was numb to answering phone calls for the past half a day. He kept picking up his phone and then used the office’s landline to arrange for delivery. In short, he was busy.

So, when the office phone suddenly rang, Li Jing didn’t even have time to look at the number and immediately picked up the phone.

“Hello, I’m from the sales department of Ding Feng winery.” Li Jing spoke with great confidence about the changes in the situation in Wan Wan over the past half day, which gave him a little more confidence.

The person on the other end of the phone said indifferently,””Hello, I’m from the city administration Bureau, my surname is Wang.”

Li Jing was stunned for a moment before he quickly said,””Hello, hello! Director Wang, I’m Li Jing, the manager of the sales department of Ding Feng winery. May I know what’s the matter?”

Although he didn’t know his position, it was right for people in the system to call him director.

“Oh, it’s manager li,” said director Wang gently. It’s like this, your distillery’s recently launched Drunken Eight Immortals liquor has a good taste, and we’re preparing to buy a batch for official reception. ”

Li Jing was overjoyed and quickly said,””That’s great! Thank you, chief Wang, for taking care of our business! For big customers like you, we can sign a special supply agreement. Not only will you have priority in supply, but we can also give you a more favorable price. With my authority, I can give you a discount of 138 Yuan per bottle of our new Drunken Eight Immortals wine. ”

This was the city’s Administrative Bureau!

This unit was responsible for the management, security, and service of the municipal Affairs. Naturally, it also included the hosting of some meetings, designated reception, and other matters. He could be said to be the head of the organization.

Although the alcohol purchased by the administration wasn’t as much as the ones sold by large super – merchants, their brand was strong!

As long as the supply agreement was signed, the new Drunken Eight Immortals would be the designated reception wine in the city! This was more convincing than any advertisement!

“Thank you, manager li!” Director Wang said with a smile. Send me a copy of the contract, and we’ll sign it after we get the approval from the leader. ”
