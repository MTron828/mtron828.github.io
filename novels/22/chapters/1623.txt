Chapter 1624: Gift (2)

Eccentric song didn’t hesitate this time and nodded.”Collect! How can I push away such a good opportunity? I don’t feel any pressure accepting the gift you gave me!”

Elder song was right. Although he had personally told Xia ruofei to take care of him, Xia ruofei had always been cautious and had never used his name to benefit himself. He was very assured of Xia ruofei’s character.

Even in front of manager Lu, elder song accepted the precious gift.

He touched the Jade carving with great interest and asked with a smile,””Tell me! This jade carving should have some other uses, right?”

Xia ruofei said,”this ... How should I put it?” You can think of it as a blessed item. If you place it at home, ordinary demons and evil spirits won’t be able to cause trouble, and it can ensure the safety of the house!”

Manager Lu couldn’t help but smile bitterly when he heard this. He thought that this was a little too idealistic.

The spirit gathering Jade Guanyin from before could feel the changes in its aura as long as it was close to eccentric song. It made one feel very comfortable. However, this Jade statue of the Zhong Yuan was actually able to ward off evil. It could not be seen nor touched ...

However, eccentric song didn’t doubt it. Instead, his eyes lit up and he asked,””So this is a magic tool?”

This time, it was Xia ruofei’s turn to be surprised. He did not expect elder song to know about magical weapons.

However, after thinking about it, he felt relieved. After all, elder song’s position before his retirement was quite prominent. He knew some secrets that ordinary people didn’t know. Naturally, he knew that the metaphysics of Feng Shui wasn’t just feudal superstition. He might even know some of the Masters in that circle! It was not strange for him to know about magic tools.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and nodded.”Yes! However, the benefits of the Jade Guanyin from before are even more obvious. In order to avoid conflicts in aura, you can wear the Jade Guanyin with you and leave this Jade Zhong Kui carving at home. ”

The song family’s house was very old. The song family had lived in it for decades. Moreover, elder song was not the first owner of the house. It was later assigned to him by the organization. This kind of old house with a long history might have some unclean things. This Jade Zhong Kui carving could be used to guard the house.

An ordinary person might be worried about the safety of the Jade statue, but elder song’s place was impregnable. The security inside and outside was quite tight, so there was no possibility of theft.

“Alright,” elder song nodded,”we’ll do as you say and place it in my central room. ”

After saying that, eccentric song played with the Jade statue for a while.

Ever since elder song had placed the bell ring Jade statue in the central room of the rear courtyard, the old estate seemed to have gradually begun to undergo some subtle changes.

In the past, elder song did not feel anything. After all, he had been through a brutal war and climbed out of a pile of dead bodies. The murderous aura he had was enough to keep most of the evils away.

However, all the staff in the old mansion, including manager Lu, felt that the mansion was a little eerie at night. Sometimes, some people would even hear some strange sounds.

Ever since the Jade statue of the bell was placed in the house, everyone felt that the night seemed to be less cold and a little warmer. The gloomy feeling also disappeared without a trace, as if the atmosphere of the entire house had changed.

Of course, this was all a story for later.

That night, elder song and Xia ruofei talked for a long time. In the end, he decided to let Xia ruofei stay at the old mansion.

Since it was an order from the elder, Xia ruofei naturally did not dare to refuse. He stayed the night in the guest room of the song family’s old house.

The next day, he had breakfast with elder song before he got up and left.

Elder song had instructed manager Lu to prepare many gifts for Xia ruofei. Now that Xia ruofei’s own company produced wine and tea leaves that were comparable to elder song ‘s, elder song’s gifts for Xia ruofei included some tonics and special desserts instead of wine and tea.

Of course, elder song knew that Xia ruofei smoked, so he had a lot of special cigarettes. There were two boxes with 20 packs. Even manager Lu was envious.

Elder song had been allocated this amount for almost a year. Now that he had stopped smoking, he gave all of it to Xia ruofei.

Manager Lu knew that when song Rui came back last weekend, he had carefully asked elder song for a few packets, but he had been rejected without any hesitation.

However, when he gave it to Xia ruofei, he gave it by the box.

“How can my grandson bear this ...” Manager Lu thought to himself, amused.

After Xia ruofei drove back to the courtyard house in liuhai Lane, he gave Song Wei a call. When Song Wei found out that Xia ruofei was free today, she immediately put down a research project and rushed to the courtyard house.

The two of them used the time formation to cultivate for more than ten days. They didn’t stop cultivating until it was almost noon in the outside world.

After this round of cultivation, Song Wei’s cultivation had improved by a large margin. She was one step closer to Qi disciple Level 3. Xia ruofei estimated that after two or three more rounds of cultivation, she should be able to touch the bottleneck of the breakthrough.

When the two of them practiced the “absolute beginning Scripture” together, they could advance very quickly. It was not inferior to the “great Dao Sutra” that Xia ruofei was cultivating.

Xia ruofei’s own cultivation had also improved in the process of practicing the “absolute beginning Scripture”. However, it was not as obvious as Song Wei ‘s. After all, the progress in the early stages of cultivation was definitely faster.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but exclaim at the magic of this technique.

Of course, the advantages and disadvantages of the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” were very obvious. The main limitation was that two people had to cultivate it together. In the long run, it was obviously not as good as the “great Dao Sutra”.

The “great way of the Dao” pointed directly to the source of cultivation and could allow Xia ruofei to cultivate to a very high realm. In comparison, the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” did not have such a strong aftereffect.

After all, they were two cultivation techniques of completely different levels.

After Xia ruofei had lunch with Song Wei in the courtyard house, he persuaded her to go back to school.

Song Wei herself wanted to continue cultivating in the afternoon. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

However, Xia ruofei considered that if he cultivated too quickly, his Foundation would be unstable. Moreover, he had to participate in the bidding for that land tomorrow. Zhao Yongjun, song Rui, and the others had already discussed with Xia ruofei that they would come to the courtyard house in the afternoon and set off from there the next day.

Xia ruofei didn’t know when Zhao Yongjun and the others would arrive, but if they saw Song Wei in his house, it wouldn’t be good.

In the end, Song Wei accepted Xia ruofei as the reason. With a trace of disappointment and longing, she got into Wu Qiang’s car and left the siheyuan.

It turned out that Xia ruofei’s decision was correct. Zhao Yongjun and the others arrived at siheyuan at twoo’ clock in the afternoon. At this time, Wu Qiang, who had sent Song Wei back to school, had not returned yet.

If Song Wei had stayed behind to continue her cultivation, she would have been caught red – handed.

Although it was unlikely to expose the time formation and her cultivation, Song Wei was song Qiming’s precious daughter. It would be bad if she stayed with Xia ruofei alone.

Zhao Yongjun and his men drove a Mercedes – Benz over. Zhao Yongjun got out of the car and asked with a smile,””Ruofei, why are you the one who opened the door? What about Wu Qiang?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I asked him to go out and do something.” Brother Zhao, didn’t you say you would come in the evening? How come you’re here so early?”

Before Zhao Yongjun could say anything, song Rui said,””Hey! We drank some wine in the afternoon and didn’t have anywhere to go in the afternoon, so we came here to find a place to sleep!”

Xia ruofei was speechless. Did he treat this place as a hotel?

He took a look and it was true. Other than Wei Jun who was driving, the smell of alcohol on the others was very strong. It seemed that they had drunk a lot in the afternoon.

“Fine! “You’re welcome ...” Xia ruofei smiled.”You can choose your own room!”

“Hold on!” Song Rui shouted,”there’s still something!”
