3216 Spacesuits (1)

Xia ruofei was in contact with Li Yifu, who was on Peach Blossom Island.

After the exchange with master Yuntai, Xia ruofei knew that the black Phoenix flying ship’s defense was very strong and could handle outer space flight. Hence, he was very confident. What he had to do now was to find a way to solve the spacesuits problem.

Li Yifu’s family had been developing in the United States. After two generations of accumulation, their assets had reached tens of billions of US dollars and they had a great influence in the United States.

If Xia ruofei wanted to get a spacesuit from NASA, Li Yifu would be his first choice.

Of course, China’s level in the aerospace field was also leading in the world. The “flying sky” EVA suit that China had independently developed was also very advanced in technology.

Xia ruofei wanted to ask for a few spacesuits from the aerospace industry through elder song and the others. It was not difficult. Besides, he would not ask for it for free. He would definitely pay for it.

However, the purpose of buying a spacesuit was really difficult to explain.

It might even cause unnecessary trouble for elder song and the others.

After all, the aerospace field was too sensitive.

Xia ruofei couldn’t possibly use the methods of cultivators in his own country to steal it just to hide it from others.

Therefore, he chose to purchase a spacesuit from the United States secret.

Of course, if the deal in the United States did not work out, Xia ruofei would not hold back. He would not have any psychological burden if he stole NASA’s spacesuits.

Xia ruofei had this ‘buy if you can, steal if you can’ mentality ‘attitude, so he contacted Li Yifu first.

Li Yifu quickly picked up the call and greeted him respectfully,””Senior granduncle, what are your orders?”

Xia ruofei asked,”foster husband, do you have any way to get in touch with NASA?”

Li Yifu couldn’t help but be stunned for a moment before asking,””Great uncle – Master, you mean ... The National United States?”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”You heard me right. It’s NASA. I want to do business with them. Can you find me a way?” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Li Yifu said,”uncle – Master, I can definitely find NASA’s connections. However, the aerospace field is very sensitive. I’m also Chinese, so it’s impossible to trade some core technology with them. The United States intelligence Department is watching!”

“I don’t want their technology.” Xia ruofei said,”I just want to get a few spacesuits. Can you do that?”

“A spacesuit?” Li Yifu was stunned for a moment, then he immediately reacted and said,”senior granduncle, you’re preparing to go to outer space!”

Since it was not a face – to – Face conversation but a satellite phone call, there was a possibility that it could be monitored. Hence, Xia ruofei did not explain in detail and only said,””Almost! The most important thing right now is to get a spacesuit, and it has to be an EVA suit. Foster husband, can you think of a way?”

Li Yifu pondered for a moment before saying,””Grand uncle – Master, if you want to buy a spacesuit from an official United States organization like NASA, it’ll be more difficult. Don’t look down on just spacesuits, it also involves many core technologies!”

“If the difficulty is too high, then forget it!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’ll think of another way!”

Xia ruofei’s “other way” naturally did not refer to purchasing. For practitioners, even if NASA was heavily guarded, they could still come and go as they pleased.

The only question was, would NASA have so many spacesuits in stock? In addition, it was said that spacesuits were tailor – made for astronauts. If there were no flight missions, a spare spacesuits might not be enough, and it might not fit.

“Great uncle – Master, I said it’s not easy to get a spacesuit from NASA, but it should be possible!” Li Yifu said.

“Oh?” Xia ruofei asked with interest,”where else can I get a spacesuit other than NASA?”

“I don’t know if martial granduncle has heard of the name of elonmask?” Li Yifu asked.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said with uncertainty,””You mean the owner of the Tesla electric car?”

“Yes!” Li Yifu replied with a smile. He’s the founder of Tesla, but he also has another identity, spaceX, the CEO and CEO of the United States space exploration technology company. You should have heard of the Falcon rocket, right?”

Xia ruofei said,”I seem to have an impression of it ... I heard that their rocket boosters can be retrieved, right?” You’re saying that this space technology company also belongs to this guy, and he might be able to get spacesuits from there?”

“This is what this disciple means.” Li Yifu said,”in fact, SpaceX has obtained a lot of technology from NASA. Their manned space technology is also very advanced. Soon, they will be carrying out independent manned flights! Therefore, the quality of SpaceX’s spacesuits is no worse than NASA ‘s. It’s definitely easier to deal with a private company than a state agency United States!”

“Understood!” Xia ruofei said,”adopted husband, please go and coordinate this personally. I need to get at least 18 sets of Eva suits as soon as possible. It would be better if you could get more. In addition, we need as many oxygen supply modules as possible to ensure that at least nine people can stay in outer space. The oxygen supply modules alone can support one to two months “worth of supply.”

Three from the first heaven society, two from the Cang lang society, two from the soaring Flower Valley, plus Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue, they had a total of nine people on this trip. The 18 spacesuits were just one main and one backup. Considering that the probability of everyone’s spacesuits breaking down was not high, one main and one backup were barely enough.
