Chapter 178: Chapter 175 – tender and protective towards the fairer sex (1)

Xia ruofei was shocked when he saw Lu You’s pale face. He quickly asked,””Lu You, what’s wrong?” Lu You’s eyes were initially slightly closed. When she heard Xia ruofei’s voice, she opened her eyes and glanced at him. Then, she waved her hand weakly to show that she was fine. However, the more she acted this way, the more worried Xia ruofei was. Could it be that he had some kind of acute illness? The plane had just taken off. It would be very dangerous if she were to catch an acute illness in the sky. Moreover, Lu You’s face was really too scary. There was almost no color in it. “Lu You, what’s wrong with you?” Xia ruofei asked anxiously,”where do you feel uncomfortable?” Lu You frowned and said weakly,””I already said I’m fine, don’t worry about me ...” “How can we do that? Your face is very pale, are you not feeling well?” Xia ruofei said,”if it’s serious, it’s very dangerous in the sky. The plane has just taken off. If you really can’t handle it, report to the crew. If you have to return, you have to return!” “You’re so annoying! I already said it’s fine! Can you let me rest for a while?” Lu You’s voice finally became louder. However, after she finished speaking, her brows furrowed even more tightly. She reached out to hold her lower abdomen, and the pained expression on her face became even more apparent. Xia ruofei’s gaze landed on Lu You’s hand and he had a guess. Lu You could feel Xia ruofei’s gaze and her pale face started to blush. She glared at Xia ruofei and said,””Where are you looking!” “Lu You, do you ... Have a stomachache?” Xia ruofei tried to probe. Lu You’s face turned red again. She avoided his gaze and said,””You don’t need to care!” When Xia ruofei saw Lu You’s reaction, he basically confirmed his guess. He didn’t mind Lu You’s bad attitude. Wanwan had never been nice to him before. Besides, her relatives were here. It was normal for her to be in a bad mood. However, Xia ruofei felt that Lu You’s menstrual pain was not just serious. From her pale face and the beads of sweat on her forehead, he knew that she must be in great pain. During the take – off phase, as the plane climbed higher, the air pressure in the cabin would change. This would already bring about some discomfort, not to mention that Lu You’s symptoms were so serious. This made things even worse. Seeing Lu You clutching her stomach in pain, Xia ruofei’s heart softened. He unbuckled his seatbelt and stood up. There was an air stewardess sitting not far from the first class cabin. When she saw Xia ruofei stand up, she quickly said,””Sir, the plane is still in the climbing phase. The captain has not removed the seat belt warning light. Please stay in your seat and fasten your seat belt to avoid any danger!” Xia ruofei could only sit down helplessly. He said to Lu You in a low voice,””Just bear with it for a while! I’ll go get you some medicine after the plane levels down!” Lu You’s eyes were slightly closed and her brows were tightly knitted. She raised her hand weakly at Xia ruofei to show that she understood. Xia ruofei looked at Lu You worriedly and then fastened his seat belt again. It was not his first time on a plane, but he felt that today’s climb was particularly long. The plane’s angle of elevation slowly decreased until it was finally flat. After a while, the safety belt warning light went off with a ding. Xia ruofei unbuckled his seat belt and stood up almost immediately. Lu You raised her head slightly and looked at Xia ruofei. She felt a warm current in her heart. The first – Class seats were more spacious. Xia ruofei quietly stepped over Lu You’s legs and walked to the pantry in front. The air stewardesses had also unbuckled their seat belts and were busy preparing meals. The flight from Shen Cheng to San Shan was not long, so they had to hurry up and provide food for the passengers. The purser saw Xia ruofei walking over and quickly stepped forward to greet him. With a professional smile on his face, he asked softly,””Sir, what can I do for you?” “Hello, do you have red sugar here?” Xia ruofei asked. My friend isn’t feeling well, please make me a cup of brown sugar water. ” The purser immediately understood and nodded with a smile,”Alright, please wait a moment!” Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”sorry to trouble you!” Uh ... You can just put it here after you’re done. I’ll go to the bathroom and bring it over later. ” “Alright,” he said. “Thank you!” After Xia ruofei finished speaking, he pushed open the door and walked into the first – Class washroom that was one aisle away from the lunchbox. After locking the door, Xia ruofei quickly summoned the spirit map scroll from his palm. Then, he used his mind to communicate with the space. Very quickly, he retrieved the stainless steel Flat wine pot that was filled with the petal solution. Xia ruofei kept the painting in his palm and hid the stainless steel wine pot in his sleeve. He then pushed open the bathroom door and walked out. The stewardess had already prepared the brown sugar water. A glass was filled with warm water mixed with brown sugar. Xia ruofei expressed his gratitude to her, then took the glass of brown sugar water and walked back. Other than Xia ruofei and Lu You, there was only a fatty in the first – Class cabin. At this moment, the fatty had fallen asleep in his seat. There was a curtain separating the first – Class and economy class, so when Xia ruofei’s back was facing the air stewardesses, it almost blocked all their vision. He moved his arm without a trace, and the stainless steel wine pot slid into his palm. Xia ruofei used his thumb to push the wine pot open slightly. While paying attention to the movements in front and behind him, he dripped five or six drops of the flower petal solution into the glass. Then, he used his thumb to adjust the mouth of the wine pot and put his hand in his pocket. The stainless steel wine pot fell into his pocket without a sound. Xia ruofei stepped over Lu You’s legs and returned to his seat. Then, he turned around and placed the brown sugar water on the small table in front of Lu You. He said softly,””Lu You, drink some water! Warm water with red sugar ...” Lu You looked at the cup of Hot Brown sugar water and said to Xia ruofei with a complicated expression,””Thank you!” “Don’t talk so much. Drink it while it’s hot ...”Xia ruofei smiled. Lu You nodded. She reached out for the cup of brown sugar water and drank it all in small sips. Seeing that Lu You had finished it all, Xia ruofei felt a little more at ease. Even if it could not completely cure Lu You’s problem, it could at least alleviate the pain. Xia ruofei picked up the book beside him and started reading quietly. After Lu You drank the red sugar water that was mixed with the flower petal solution, she soon felt a small stream of heat in her stomach. The warm feeling was very comfortable. This heat gradually spread from his lower abdomen to his entire body. Unknowingly, the waves of bone – piercing pain began to slowly ease. After a while, Lu You could no longer feel any pain. She also found it very magical. This illness had been with her for many years. During these few days of each month, she would be in so much pain that she would wish she were dead. She had used the “beginner trick” of brown sugar water countless times, but the effect was minimal each time. Why did the brown sugar water become a panacea today? Could it be because of him? Lu You thought about it and couldn’t help but turn to look at Xia ruofei. At this moment, Xia ruofei was reading a book and did not notice Lu You’s gaze. Lu You saw that Xia ruofei was reading a book very seriously. The sunlight from the porthole shone in, covering his side profile with a layer of light. It was like a silhouette, and the lines on his face were much gentler. Lu You tilted her head and thought for a while. She was still a little embarrassed to ask. She twisted her body slightly, and her expression changed slightly. She quickly picked up her handbag, unbuckled her seat belt, got up, and walked to the bathroom. Xia ruofei only raised his eyes to look at Lu You before he immersed himself in his book again. Very soon, Lu You came out of the bathroom and returned to her seat. Ever since she boarded the plane today, the excruciating pain had been with her almost all the time, making her feel very tired. Now that the pain was gone, Lu You soon felt sleepy. She leaned back in her chair and slowly closed her eyes. Soon, she fell into a deep sleep. Xia ruofei was very confident in his flower petal solution. Hence, after seeing Lu You drink the brown sugar water, he did not observe her condition. Just as Xia ruofei was engrossed in reading, he suddenly felt a light touch on his right shoulder. Then, a head leaned on his shoulder. Xia ruofei turned his head and realized that Lu You had fallen asleep. For some reason, she was sitting in such a spacious and well – wrapped first – Class seat, but she could turn half of her body upside down. Now, her head was resting on Xia ruofei’s shoulder. Xia ruofei knew that Lu You was also very tired, so he did not dare to move at all, afraid that he would wake her up. It was not comfortable to keep the same position, but Xia ruofei had taken part in the sniper’s ambush training when he was in the Army. He had passed the hellish training where he had to lie on the ground for a whole day in a hot and humid camouflage suit. This situation was nothing to him. Xia ruofei kept his upper body still and put down the book with his left hand. Then, he pressed the summon button on the armrest of his chair. Soon, a first – Class flight attendant came to their seats and asked Xia ruofei what he needed. “My friend is asleep. Please get me a blanket, thank you!” Xia ruofei said softly. The air stewardess immediately nodded, and the blanket was quickly sent over. Xia ruofei could not move his body easily, so he asked the stewardess to cover Lu You with the blanket carefully. The rest of the journey was boring. Xia ruofei couldn’t move at all. After sitting for a while, he couldn’t help but lower his head and look at Lu You. Lu You’s breathing was very stable, and her expression was rather calm. It was obvious that her lower abdomen no longer hurt. At such a close distance, Xia ruofei could clearly see the snow – White skin and long eyelashes on Lu You’s face. All of a sudden, the plane that had been flying steadily all this time suddenly sank without any warning ... [PS] reporting to my brothers and sisters, from today onwards, it will be changed to a 3000 – Word chapter, with two chapters a day, one chapter in the morning and one chapter in the evening. This was mainly because steel gun had always been writing 3000 – Word chapters. This new book was still not used to 2000 – Word chapters after more than two months, so he decided to change it back. This way, even though there was one less chapter, the word count would still be at least 6000 words, which was the same as before. Please understand. Thank you! By the way, this chapter was a large chapter with more than 3400 words.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
