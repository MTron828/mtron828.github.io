2750 Settle accounts after autumn (1)

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”get up and talk.” We were enemies before, so how could I blame you? I can’t do anything about it. The natural formation on the Peach Blossom Island is too important, so I can only control everyone who knows this secret. Otherwise, you should know what the consequences will be if the news is leaked. ”

In fact, Xia ruofei did not need to explain to Luo Qingfeng at all. Under the control of the soul seal, Luo Qingfeng would never have any disloyalty or resentment. However, Luo Qingfeng was a cultivator in the Golden core stage after all. He was the cultivator with the highest cultivation level that Xia ruofei had subdued since he stepped onto the path of cultivation. Therefore, he planned to train Luo Qingfeng to be his right – hand man. Naturally, he should be honest with him.

After all, the environment of the cultivation world on earth was deteriorating. It was not easy to reach Luo Qingfeng’s level. Furthermore, now that the soul seal had been planted, there was no need to worry about Luo Qingfeng’s loyalty. Thus, he had to maximize his use.

“Yes!” Luo Qingfeng quickly replied.”I understand!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Although he was controlled by the soul seal and subservient to Xia ruofei, he did not lose his self – consciousness. Hence, he was very nervous. After all, he had attacked Xia ruofei without holding back and almost destroyed his breakthrough. If Xia ruofei held a grudge against him, he would be completely under Xia ruofei’s control. He did not know how he would be tortured!

After listening to Xia ruofei’s words, Luo Qingfeng’s anxious heart was finally at ease. At the same time, because of the soul seal, Xia ruofei’s gentle attitude had moved him from the bottom of his heart.

Xia ruofei then asked the question that he was most concerned about,””Apart from you, Zheng Yongshou, and Wang Boshan, have you told anyone else about the news of the natural formation on the Peach Blossom Island?”

“Master,” Luo Qingfeng replied,”I’ve always treated this as a top secret and have not told anyone. I’ve also strictly ordered Zheng Yongshou and Wang Boshan not to disclose a word to anyone. This time, I came out in the name of closed – door cultivation. No one else in the sect knows my whereabouts, so please rest assured, master! Other than the few of us, no one else knows about this. ”

When Luo Qingfeng heard Xia ruofei’s question, he could already confirm that Zheng Yongshou and Wang Boshan were most likely controlled by Xia ruofei in the same way.

Xia ruofei heaved a long sigh of relief.

Ever since he had taken over the Peach Blossom Island and learned that there was another power watching this place, his heart had been hanging in the air. The star Seizer sect was like a shadow that he could not get rid of, causing him to be unable to eat or sleep in peace. After all, no matter how strong a person was, he was still very small in the face of a cultivation sect. Even if the star Seizer sect was not a top – tier sect and Xia ruofei was not weak, he would still be a small fry.

Now that things had developed to this point, he could finally confirm that the crisis of the Paradise Island had been resolved.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”let’s go!” Let’s leave this place first. ”

With a thought, Luo Qingfeng immediately felt the environment change. The illusion had disappeared. He suddenly realized that he had been running around in circles the whole time, and he was still not far from the cement house.

Luo Qingfeng felt that he could not blame himself for losing. In fact, even without the help of the great formation, Xia ruofei’s superb swordsmanship and fine control of the flying sword would not be at a disadvantage even if he were to fight him head – on.

In addition, with the effect of the soul seal, Luo Qingfeng had long admired Xia ruofei.

He suddenly thought of something and quickly took out the precious spiritual crystal from his storage ring. He presented it to Xia ruofei with both hands and said respectfully,””Master, these are your spirit crystals.”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,””You can keep it! Consider it my gift to you! I’ve said it before, if you follow me in the future, it won’t be worse than you being the sect leader. At least in terms of cultivation resources, it’s something you didn’t even dare to think about before!”

Then, Xia ruofei changed the topic and said,””But of course, you’ll have to continue being the sect master. The star Seizer sect must be firmly controlled by us.”

Even though the star Seizer sect’s strength was not the best in the cultivation world, the power of a sect was still considerable. Now that Xia ruofei had fully fulfilled this condition, he naturally would not reject a gift that had been delivered to his door.

If this power was used well, it might play a key role in the future.

Upon hearing this, Luo Qingfeng said gratefully,””Thank you, master, for your generosity! This subordinate will do his best to serve master!”

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”I don’t have the habit of sacrificing my subordinates and I won’t throw you out for no reason.” Of course, the premise is that you can carry out my orders without any discount. ”

“Yes! This subordinate will definitely remember this!” Luo Qingfeng felt warm in his heart as he lowered his head and said.

This time, the crisis had been successfully overcome. Xia ruofei did not stop the operation of the Taixu xuanqing formation. The great suanni formation needed time to gather spiritual energy. Only after a period of continuous operation would the cultivation environment of the Paradise Island Reach the standard of a cultivation paradise. Without the star Seizer sect, the greatest threat, and with peach source Island being located in the depths of the South Pacific Ocean, it was almost impossible for cultivators to set foot in this area. Therefore, the formation could naturally be maintained.
