“Alright, alright!” Deputy Director Wei said,”I’m sorry!”

Then, he took his phone and walked to the side. When he opened the screen, he saw that all the missed calls were from his daughter, Wei Xue.

This made Deputy Director Wei even more nervous, and he quickly called his daughter back with trembling hands.

The other end of the line only rang once before it was picked up. Wei Xue’s tone was urgent,”Dad! You’ve finally called me back!”

“Xiaoxue! What happened?” Deputy Chief Wei asked in a trembling voice,”could it be that something happened to your grandmother?”

“Grandma?” Wei Xue asked curiously,”grandma is perfectly fine at home! What could have happened?”

Deputy Director Wei heaved a long sigh of relief and said,””I thought something bad had happened! Why are you calling me so many times?”

“I said that grandma is fine, I didn’t say that I’m looking for you!” Wei Xue mumbled.

“What’s the matter? For you to call me ten to twenty times in such a short time?” Deputy Director Wei said impatiently,”hurry up and tell me! I’m still at work!”

Since his old mother was fine, Deputy Director Wei was not too worried, because he felt that there would not be any major problems at home.

“Dad!” Wei Xue said. Is our overbearing President visiting your office?”

Xia ruofei’s fans liked to call him “overbearing President”, even if he had never been a President before. To be exact, he was the chairman, a position higher than Feng Jing ‘s. However, the fans felt that this title was more domineering.

“What overbearing President?” asked Deputy Director Wei. You’ve read too many nonsensical novels, right?”

“Don’t play dumb! It’s Xia ruofei, President Xia!” Wei Xue said,”be honest! Don’t hide it! I’ve seen the photos ...”

Only then did Deputy Director Wei react. He looked up at Xia ruofei, who was chatting softly with two of his female friends. He asked curiously,””You little girl ... Why are you so well – informed?”

Wei Xue said proudly,”Didn’t I tell you?” I’ve seen the photos! Dad! The photo of you and our overbearing President has been spreading like crazy in our fan group! I have to say ... President Xia’s handsomeness still needs to be complemented, and you’re the best foil ...”

“What the hell is this nonsense?” asked Deputy Director Wei. Is there anyone who talks about their own father like that? You wretched girl ... Wait! What picture? A photo of me and President Xia?”

“Yeah! It’s from CEO Xia’s Weibo!” Wei Xue said,”we have someone who specifically keeps an eye on President Xia’s Weibo and saw it immediately. Wow! I can’t believe that President Xia actually came to new Wu, and what’s even more unbelievable is that my dad actually appeared in President Xia’s photo ... It’s like a dream!”

Deputy Director Wei was confused. He had used his own phone and asked Ling Qingxue to take the group photo. After taking the photo, he locked his phone in the shielded cabinet and brought his people into the computer room.

Why did that photo appear on Xia ruofei’s Weibo?

Deputy Director Wei tried his best to recall. He vaguely remembered that Xia ruofei’s other female companion was standing beside Ling Qingxue and had also taken a photo with her phone ...

He could vaguely guess the sequence of events and could not help but reveal a bitter smile.

Originally, he wanted to give his daughter the group photo and the jaded skin cream as a surprise gift! Now, the surprise was gone. Instead, he was shocked. When he saw the 18 missed calls, his heart almost jumped out of his chest. He really thought that something had happened to his old mother.

“Dad! Dad!” Wei Xue’s voice interrupted his thoughts.”Did you hear what I said?”

Deputy Director Wei came back to his senses and said,””What? What did you just say?”

“I said I want to come to your unit!” Wei Xue said,”it’s not easy for President Xia to come to new Wu. I have to fight to see him. If I miss this opportunity, I will definitely not have another chance in the future!”

Deputy Director Wei subconsciously shouted,”no!” This was simply nonsense! This is a confidential unit. Is it something a child like you can just come and go as you please?”

“I don’t care!” Wei Xue acted coquettishly,”dad! Just help me! I know you’re a confidential unit, but I’m not going into the computer room. Can’t I just stay in the yard for a while? Dad ...”

Wei Xue dragged out the last syllable. Her coy voice gave Deputy Director Wei goosebumps. He quickly said, “There’s no room for discussion! Don’t even think about it ... By the way, don’t you fans have an organization in new Wu? I’m telling you, you can’t come to our unit! It would be terrible if he chased his idol all the way to the confidential unit! Be careful or you’ll all be caught! Xiaoxue, you and your friends have to make it clear, this is not a joke!”

“Oh ...” Wei Xue also knew that there was probably no room for discussion about this matter. Her mood suddenly became a lot lower. She pouted and said,”I understand ...”

Deputy Chief Wei was slightly stunned when he heard this. Then, he laughed and said,”In a sense, you can say that.”

Xia ruofei’s comparison was not accurate, but it was easy to understand. Everyone’s home computer CPU was based on the number of cores. The comparison of more than 100000 cores was indeed shocking.

As expected, Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but say,””That’s amazing!”

Deputy Director Wei smiled and said -“the peak performance of the light of Taihu territory reaches 125.436 pflpos, ranking third in the world – its continuous performance is 93.015 pflpos, ranking first in the world – at the same time, its performance and power consumption ratio is also ranked first in the world.” At the 2016 Frankfurt world supercomputer conference, our light of Taihu territory supercomputer system topped the list. It’s almost twice as fast as Tianhe -2, which is in second place, and its efficiency is three times higher. ”

As the world’s top supercomputer, the light of Taihu territory had indeed brought glory to the country of Wei. Therefore, Deputy Director Wei was also very familiar with this data.

“Our scientific and technological workers are really amazing!” Xia ruofei looked at the neatly arranged equipment cabinets in front of him and said sincerely.

Xia ruofei had learned a lot about supercomputers during this period of time. Therefore, he was naturally very interested in the world – leading supercomputer in front of him. He pulled Deputy Director Wei along and started discussing the system architecture diagram on the wall of the computer room.

Deputy Director Wei wasn’t a pure technical staff. His knowledge in the field of supercomputing was only enough to introduce the results to the audience. Therefore, when faced with more professional and in – depth questions, he seemed to be a bit beyond his power.

Hence, he called one of the staff over and asked him to talk to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei stayed in the engine room for a few hours and still wanted more.

However, he didn’t want to affect other people’s work. Besides, he didn’t know how Wang Chi was doing. If he stayed in the computer room for too long, it wouldn’t be good to let the old academician wait for him.

Hence, Xia ruofei expressed his gratitude to the person on duty and left the engine room.

The person on duty and Deputy Director Wei were a few steps behind Xia ruofei and the other two. The person on duty could not help but ask in a low voice,””Director Wei, which school is this scholar from? He’s so young!”

Deputy Director Wei did not know whether to laugh or cry. “You’ve misjudged! He’s not a scholar, don’t you think he looks familiar?”

“I don’t think so!” The on – duty officer was confused.”Director, could it be an expert who has returned from abroad?” I don’t think I’ve seen this person before!”

Deputy Director Wei knew the workers on duty very well. He knew that many of them did not care about entertainment news, let alone the cosmetics industry, so he did not find it too strange.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“He’s the chairman of the peach blossom company, Xia ruofei, CEO Xia. Have you never heard of him?”

“Chairman?” The staff on duty said in surprise,”he’s really not an academic? Then his professional Foundation was too solid! I thought we were in the same field ... Director, Xia ruofei ... This name sounds familiar!”
