After Xia ruofei returned to the farm, he invited master Luo, who had come all the way here to help, to the company’s cafeteria.

The next morning, Xia ruofei drove to the warehouse in the city alone.

He took out the Drunken Eight Immortals wine from the storage space and arranged it according to the one month, three months, and five months period.

Next, Xia ruofei gave Qin Xiaojun a call and asked him to bring along a veteran to drive the Mercedes – Benz from the farm to the warehouse in the city.

After sharing the location with Qin Xiaojun through WeChat, Xia ruofei did not rush to retrieve the iron – Skin dendrobes from the medium to maintain their freshness. Instead, he lit a cigarette and started smoking.

After resting for a while in the warehouse and calculating that it was about time, Xia ruofei took out the fresh iron – Skin Dendrobium strips that Xia Qing had processed from the space and stacked them neatly in the other corner of the warehouse.

After he was done, Xia ruofei looked at the time. It was just a little past nineo’ clock. There were still about 20 minutes before the time he had agreed to meet the winery.

After a while, Qin Xiaojun and another veteran arrived at the warehouse.

“Brother Xia!” Qin Xiaojun ran over to her as soon as he got out of the car. “What’s the matter?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”the fresh strips of iron – Skin Dendrobium are ready. It’s in the warehouse. You will lead the way in a while. Xiao Huang will escort the carriage. Transport these fresh strips back to the farm. You guys start making them immediately.” I still have something to do here, so I can’t go back for the time being. ”

Qin Xiaojun replied excitedly,”Alright! Don’t worry!”

Xia ruofei took out a cigarette and lit one for the two of them. The three of them smoked and chatted.

After a while, the convoy from the winery arrived at the entrance of the warehouse.

The Deputy Director of the winery was in charge of production. He was very polite to Xia ruofei when he saw him. All the management of the winery knew that Xia ruofei was one of the bosses of Ding Feng winery and had mastered the core technology of Drunken Eight Immortals. It could be said that the winery’s current transformation was entirely due to Xia ruofei’s efforts. They did not dare to be negligent in front of Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”Deputy Director Lin, is the truck I asked for here?”

“It’s here, it’s here, it’s in the first carriage of the convoy!” Deputy Director Lin said quickly.

“Then please ask the stevedores to help me load these goods onto the truck!” Xia ruofei pointed to a bag filled with iron – Skin Dendrobium at the other corner of the warehouse and said,”I’m in urgent need of these things at my farm!”

“Alright, alright!” Deputy Director Lin said.

He quickly called the unloading workers from the factory to load the truck.

There was strength in numbers, and a ton of goods was quickly loaded.

Qin Xiaojun drove the Mercedes – Benz to lead the way, while the other veteran got into the small truck to escort the truck. Soon, the two trucks left the warehouse and returned to Taoyuan farm.

Master Luo was in charge of the production of the iron maple bucket. In addition, Qin Xiaojun and the others were Xia ruofei’s trusted subordinates, so he was very assured.

After dealing with the iron – Skin Dendrobium, Deputy Director Lin then directed the workers to start working. They moved the new wine made by the winery down, then moved the finished wine that Xia ruofei had “improved and processed” into the truck. Finally, they moved the new wine jars into the warehouse and placed them neatly.

After a busy day, assistant factory manager Lin thanked Xia ruofei and left politely.

The warehouse, which had just been bustling with activity, immediately quieted down again.

Xia ruofei waited for the fleet of cars to leave before carefully checking the surroundings. Then, he entered the warehouse and locked the door from the inside.

After making sure that it was safe, Xia ruofei waved his hand and the wine jars in the warehouse disappeared one by one. They appeared in the space.

Xia ruofei had done this many times. The new wine was placed in different areas according to the different storage time. Each batch of wine jars was labeled with the factory time, so Xia ruofei was very familiar with this process.

In a short while, all the wine jars were put into the space.

Xia ruofei raised his hand and looked at the time. It was almost 11 O’ clock. The delivery time he had agreed with Tian Gang was approaching. Tian Gang’s farm was located in Changping County, so it was just right to drive there.

Hence, Xia ruofei walked out of the warehouse, locked the door, and drove the pickup truck out of the city.

When they arrived at the abalone farm, Tian Gang was already waiting with a few workers.

Tian Gang’s face was filled with fatigue. It was obvious that he had worked through the night yesterday to ensure a smooth delivery of the goods today.

“Boss Xia!” Tian Gang greeted Xia ruofei enthusiastically.

“Mr. Tian, you’ve worked hard!” Xia ruofei jumped off the car and asked with a smile,”have you prepared the abalone fry?”

“I didn’t fail you!” Tian Gang said.

He brought Xia ruofei to a pergola not far away. There was a huge orange – Red plastic box there. From its length and width, it should be just enough to fit into the back of the pickup truck.

The large plastic box was filled with seawater. Under the seawater, there were more than a dozen black plastic box cages neatly placed. A small oxygen – replenishing machine was working, causing white water to splash.

Tian Gang pulled out a plastic cage and opened it. There were many pieces of plastic seedling boards stuck inside. The abalone fry he saw yesterday were all densely attached to the seedling boards.

“Boss Xia,” Tian Gang explained,”considering that you’re only transporting them for a short distance, we’ve used this kind of cage packaging. As long as you can breed these abalone fry within a day, there will definitely be no problem.”

“A few hours will be enough,” Xia ruofei nodded.

“That won’t be a problem!” Said Tian Gang with a smile.

Then, Tian Gang continued,”boss Xia, we counted all night yesterday. There are a total of 11200 abalone fry. Let’s round off the small change and count it as 11000!” I hope boss Xia will take care of my business in the future!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded,”no problem!” Then, thank you, Mr. Tian!”

“Boss Xia, do you want to count?” Tian Gang asked.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,””How long do I need to order more than ten thousand pills? Besides, I trust Mr. Tian’s character!”

With that, Xia ruofei opened each cage and checked them. He confirmed that the abalone sprouts were the same as the one he saw yesterday and that they were not of inferior quality.

“Mr. Tian, I’ll drive the car over. Please ask the workers to load it up as soon as possible!” Xia ruofei said.

“Alright, alright!” Tian Gang repeatedly said,”thank you for your trust, boss Xia!”

Xia ruofei drove the pickup truck over, and a few strong workers worked together to lift the large plastic box and load it into the back of the truck. Then, they fastened it with rubber ropes.

There was no power supply in the car, and the oxygen generator was not cheap, so they had to take it off before loading it into the car. This way, Xia ruofei had to hurry up and raise the abalones.

The eleven thousand abalone fry cost a total of thirty – eight thousand five hundred dollars. Xia ruofei had already paid five thousand dollars as a deposit the day before. Today, he swiped his card and paid the remaining thirty – three thousand dollars to Tian Gang.

Then, Xia ruofei drove away from the abalone breeding farm.

Xia ruofei was also worried that the abalone seedlings would die after being in such a high – density environment for a long time. Hence, after leaving the abalone farm, Xia ruofei quickly found a quiet place to park the car.

He went around to the back of the car and made sure that there was no one around. He immediately put the whole plastic box into the mountain and sea realm in the spirit map space.

The spiritual Qi in the spirit map space was rich. Xia ruofei believed that the baby abalone would not have any problems. He started the car again with a peace of mind and drove towards Taoyuan farm.

After returning to the farm, Xia ruofei did not bother to check on the production site of the tin Kaede bucket and went straight back to the small villa.

He went to his room and locked the door and windows. Then, he quickly entered the spirit map space.

He appeared directly on the beach, where the large orange – Red plastic box was quietly placed.

Xia Qing was standing next to the plastic box. He had already noticed when Xia ruofei had sent the plastic box into the origin space, so he had put down his work and rushed over.

“I’ll take care of this myself,” Xia ruofei said to Xia Qing.”You can go and do your own things!”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing looked at the big plastic box with some curiosity, then turned around and walked in the direction of the medicine garden.

Xia ruofei walked to the big plastic box and lifted a long black box. After opening it, he carefully took out a plastic sapling.

The seedlings of the net abalones were slowly crawling on the seedling boards and looked quite energetic. Especially after entering the spirit map space, the abalones were stimulated by the rich Reiki and became active.

Xia ruofei was completely at ease. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

He was already wearing slippers and shorts, so he took the plastic sapling board and walked into the sea. He only carefully put the sapling board in the sea when the water reached his waist.

Xia ruofei released his divine telekinesis to observe the movements at the bottom of the sea. The water of the sea in the space seemed to contain spiritual Qi. The seedlings of the net abalones quickly climbed down from the plastic seedling board and slowly crawled on the bottom of the sea. Then, they attached themselves to the rocks at the bottom of the sea.

It seemed that the net abalone seedlings were not acclimatized to the environment, so Xia ruofei was relieved.

Hence, Xia ruofei went back and forth and placed all the net abalone seedlings in the space sea.

In order to prevent the density from being too high in certain areas, Xia ruofei would always “change locations after each shot” and place the net abalone sprouts along the coastline of the space.

After about an hour of hard work, more than 11000 net abalone seedlings were finally released into the sea.

Xia ruofei did not have to do anything else. The net abalone only needed to eat the seaweed and microorganisms in the sea to grow. All he could do was wait.

However, Xia ruofei also believed that with the unique environment in the medium, these net abalones would grow very quickly and of high quality.

By then, it would not be impossible for two – headed abalones or even one – headed abalones to appear, which would bring Xia ruofei a huge fortune.

After he was done with the net abalone seedlings, Xia ruofei realized that it was already past one in the afternoon. He quickly left the spirit map space.
