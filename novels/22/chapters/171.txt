Chapter 172: Chapter 169 – a dramatic result

An zaihua was also a little depressed. He had expected that he would be able to get the White truffle for 1.1 million USD at most after MA Xiong had announced that he would not be participating in the auction. However, he was now offered 1.2 million USD. Now that the two old enemies were competing with each other, the price had already gone out of control. $100,000 in itself was nothing, but it was too much money to spend! An zaihua had also made up his mind. If GE long and Gu Hongyang continued to compete, he would really withdraw from the competition. He could be the spendthrift if he wanted to! GE long and Gu Hongyang looked at each other and then snorted in unison. Gu Hongyang cleared his throat and asked,”GE long, do you still dare to bid? As long as you bid, I’ll definitely bid 10000 more than you!” “It’s only one or two million dollars, old Gu,”said GE long with a smile.”What’s the problem with being brave or not?” The point is, I said that no matter how much you bid, I’ll bid 10000 more than you. I have no grudges with old an, so what’s the point of arguing with him? Why don’t you give me a price and try?” “Nonsense,” Gu Hongyang snorted coldly and said,”do I have any grudges with President an? A gentleman doesn’t take what others like. Unless you, GE long, dare to bid, then I’ll definitely accompany you to the end. ” The auctioneer was also stunned when he saw the two rich men with tens of billions of dollars fighting like children. He almost forgot his job. It was only when an zaihua coughed unhappily that the auctioneer came back to his senses. He quickly said,””Mr. An has bid 1.2 million dollars. Are there any higher bids? This white truffle is the largest one we’ve ever found, and we’ve all tasted it from the same place. It’s of the best quality, and if you miss it, you might never get another chance in your life ...” The auctioneer waited for a while and saw GE long and Gu Hongyang staring at each other with no intention to continue bidding. Thus, he started the countdown,”1.2 million dollars going once!” GE long and Gu Hongyang looked at each other and snorted at the same time. They sat back in their seats. Apparently, the two enemies had reached a tacit understanding and were not going to compete with each other. “1.2 million dollars going twice ...” The auctioneer continued to shout. A smile appeared on an zaihua’s face. It seemed that this giant piece of white truffle was going to be his. Although he had spent 1.2 million dollars, it was definitely worth it to taste the world record – breaking white truffle. The auctioneer looked around the stage and waited for a few more seconds before finally saying,””1.2 million USD ...” At this moment, an elegant female voice was heard,””Wait, I bid 1.21 million dollars!” An zaihua’s smile froze on his face. He didn’t expect that someone would come out to compete at the last moment. When everyone looked toward the source of the voice, they were even more puzzled. The person who had just made the bid was none other than the successor of the Grao family, Monica Grao. An zaihua couldn’t help but rub his forehead. Did he have to be so calculative? You’re a truffle seller, why are you fighting with us for truffles? MA Xiong was stunned for a moment before he laughed out loud.”President an, it seems like good things always come to an end!” “Miss Grasso,” an zaihua said with a bitter smile.”Don’t tell me your family is lacking truffles?” Aren’t you being a little unkind?” Everyone laughed out of goodwill. Of course, no one doubted Monica’s financial ability just because the Grao family’s total transaction amount in the last auction was only 600000 to 700000 USD. After all, the Grao family didn’t come to China just for that small auction. In terms of wealth, although the Grao family couldn’t compare to MA Xiong and the others, they could still take out one to two million USD for fun. Monica pursed her lips and smiled.”Mr. An, although our family doesn’t lack truffles, we do lack truffles that can break world records!” It’s precisely because we’re a century – old truffle family that I’m interested in this rare truffle!” An zaihua shrugged his shoulders and thought for a moment before he raised his voice,””Alright, 1.22 million dollars!” Although an zaihua had said that he didn’t want the truffle to exceed 1.2 million dollars, he couldn’t help but add 10000 dollars to Monica’s offer when he saw that the truffle was about to be in his hands. Monica seemed to be determined to compete for the White truffle, and she immediately announced her price.””1.23 million dollars!” “Mr. An,” she chuckled.”There’s a Chinese saying that a good man doesn’t fight with a woman. Why don’t you just show some mercy?” An zaihua smiled bitterly and said,”miss Grasso isn’t a weak woman!” You’re a woman who doesn’t lose to men at all!” With the way things had developed, Xia ruofei, who was in the audience, was also in a state of confusion. He would never have thought that Monica would actually participate in the auction. Wasn’t she just here to watch the fun? In Xia ruofei’s mind, Monica was the least likely to participate in the competition. But the truth was right in front of him. Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. At this moment, he suddenly felt a sharp pain on his arm and could not help but gasp. He turned his head and saw Lu You sitting upright and looking in front of him. Her expression was very natural, but Xia ruofei could see two very obvious nail marks on his arm. “Why did you pinch me?” Xia ruofei asked in a low voice. Lu You looked straight ahead and said,””I couldn’t tell that you really have a way with women! I think highly of you, you have the potential to be a gigolo. ” Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”what does this have to do with me?” What does it have to do with me if she wants to bid?” Lu You pouted lightly and couldn’t be bothered to talk to Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei could only laugh and cry. An zaihua thought for a while and said,””1.24 million dollars! Miss Grasso, if you have a higher bid, I’ll give up!” On one hand, an zaihua had set a bottom line for himself. At the same time, he was also hinting to Monica that if she was deliberately raising the price, she should stop. If they gave up on the White truffle, she would get the White truffle. Unexpectedly, Monica said very seriously,””Mr. An, thank you for letting me win!” Then, Monica said firmly,””1.25 million dollars!” An zaihua spread out his hands and shrugged to show that he had given up on the competition. The auctioneer didn’t dawdle any longer. After asking once, he started counting down. After counting down three times, the hammer fell. This 2.05kg truffle, which had broken the world record, was dramatically bought by Monica, the third heir of the traditional truffle family, the Grao family, at a sky – High price of 1.25 million US dollars. The three rich men, who had been competing fiercely from the beginning, had actually lost one after another. The auction finally came to an end, and thunderous applause rang out in the hall.
