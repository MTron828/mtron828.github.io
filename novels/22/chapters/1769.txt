Chapter 1770: A reality (2)

Xia ruofei picked up his car from the parking lot. As soon as he started the engine, his phone rang. He took it out and saw that it was Zhao Yongjun.

The moment the call connected, Zhao Yongjun spoke before Xia ruofei could say anything,””RUO Fei, where are you? Come over and have dinner together! Bring sister – in – Law along!”

Xia ruofei was stunned.”She’s back at San Shan. I just sent her off. She’s still at the airport!”

“Why are you leaving so quickly?” Zhao Yongjun said,”then come over yourself! We’re in the Royal Palace!”

The royal family’s private kitchen was a place where Zhao Yongjun and the others often ate. Xia ruofei had been there more than once.

Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”brother Zhao, why do I feel that you’re very excited?” What’s the matter?”

Zhao Yongjun paused for a moment, then quickly said,””It’s just that the groundbreaking ceremony was very successful, so I’m happy! RUO Fei, don’t dawdle. Your wife has already gone back. What else can you do? Quickly come over!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

He drove away from the airport and drove in the direction of the private kitchen of the king’s residence.

It was past Sixo’ clock in the morning, and it was the most crowded time in Beijing. Xia ruofei saw that all the roads on the GPS had turned red. He couldn’t help but feel helpless. Even if he wanted to take a detour, there was no place to go!

In the end, they could only move at a snail’s pace in the traffic. Xia ruofei finally arrived at the private kitchen at 7:30 am. On the way, Zhao Yongjun called him three or four times to hurry him.

Xia ruofei parked the car and walked into the room that Zhao Yongjun had mentioned.

“You brat, you’re too slow! Three glasses of wine as a punishment!” Zhao Yongjun looked up and saw Xia ruofei. He immediately said.

“Alright, alright, alright, I’ll accept my punishment!” Xia ruofei smiled.

As he spoke, he looked around the room. Zhao Yongjun, song Rui, Xu Zixuan, and the others were all here. What surprised Xia ruofei was that the Deputy Director of xiangnan TV, Gao Jun, who was introduced to him by Hou Liang this morning, was also here.

What was going on? Xia ruofei muttered in his heart.

On the other hand, song Rui had already filled a glass with Drunken Eight Immortals wine and placed it in front of Xia ruofei. He smiled evilly and said,””RUO Fei, first cup! This young master will personally pour wine for you, so you have to drink more!”

Xia ruofei looked at the two glasses speechlessly and then at the small white glasses that everyone was drinking in. Wasn’t this clearly a scam?

However, Xia ruofei was obviously not afraid. He took the glass from song Rui and finished it. Then, he showed the bottom of the glass to everyone and said,””Waiter, pour the wine!”

Song Rui said with a cheeky smile,”okay!” Objective, please wait a moment!”

After he finished speaking, he picked up the Drunken Eight Immortals and poured another glass for Xia ruofei.

Just like that, Xia ruofei had not even sat down after entering the house. With every bite of the food, he drank three big glasses of white wine, a total of six taels. Gao Jun, who was watching from the side, was a little dumbfounded. He had seen people who could drink, but it was really rare to see someone who drank so much as soon as they came.

Xia ruofei wiped his mouth, pushed the chair away and sat down. He first nodded at Gao Jun, then looked at Zhao Yongjun.

“Brother Zhao, why did you suddenly decide to organize this?” Xia ruofei asked.

Zhao Yongjun naturally understood what Xia ruofei meant. He smiled and said,””I’m so happy! Firstly, our groundbreaking ceremony was a success, right? Secondly ... We even reached an agreement with xiangnan TV’s channel today, it’s a double blessing!”

Xia ruofei suddenly had a bad feeling and asked,””Brother Zhao, what cooperation agreement?”

Xia ruofei said as he looked at Gao Jun.

Gao Jun looked a little embarrassed. He had wanted to say that he would sign an agreement with Zhao Yongjun first, and after Zhao Yongjun had convinced Xia ruofei, they would sit down and have a meal together.

He didn’t expect Zhao Yongjun to say that it wasn’t necessary and that he could just call Xia ruofei out tonight to talk about it.

“It’s like this, after negotiating with the higher – ups, I’ve decided to work with xiangnan TV to provide a recording studio for one of their shows. ”

“Is it the third season of the life I yearn for?” Xia ruofei asked with a strange expression.

“Yup!” Zhao Yongjun had a harmless smile on his face as he said,”ruofei, we’ve been using this as a backup plan. After Hou Liang mentioned it to me today, I felt that it’s not bad, so I directly confirmed the cooperation with Gao tai.”

“Big brother Zhao ...” Xia ruofei looked helpless.”I’ve explained to the stage and liangzi today. This is not appropriate ...”

Zhao Yongjun didn’t try to persuade him, he just smiled and said,””Ruofei, I’ve already signed an agreement with the high platform! Didn’t we agree that I’ll be in charge of the club’s Affairs? I don’t think it’ll do the company any harm, so ... I made the decision. ”

“You ...” Xia ruofei was at a loss for words. After a while, he said,””Brother Zhao, don’t tell me that your agreement didn’t include the issue of planting advertisements for paradise Corporation?”

He knew Zhao Yongjun’s personality too well. Zhao Yongjun made the decision without a second thought, which made Xia ruofei feel like he had taken advantage of his friends. He felt even worse.

Zhao Yongjun said innocently,”insert advertisements?” “I really don’t have any, but the higher – ups mentioned that they hoped to use some high – Quality ingredients in the show, so I recommended the products of paradise Corporation. After all, in the field of high – end ingredients, you are definitely one of the best in the country, right?”

There’s such an operation? Xia ruofei was dumbfounded.

Zhao Yongjun continued,”that’s why I called you over today. It’s also to discuss this matter with you. Gaotai hopes that your paradise Corporation can sponsor some high – end ingredients. Everyone has such a good relationship, and Gaotai and liangzi’s family have a deep relationship. You won’t refuse to give this little face, right?”

Zhao Yongjun gave Gao Jun a look.

Gao Jun didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. This kind of excuse was like a child’s play, how could she not hear it?

How could Zhao Yongjun not know that Xia ruofei could hear him? however, he didn’t care. He just had to make it a fact.

Gao Jun still gave Zhao Yongjun a lot of face and squeezed out a smile.””That’s right, director Xia. I hope that you can support us! In return, our program will also promote your company’s products at appropriate times through the host and guests. ”

Wasn’t this the same as planting an advertisement? ‘It’s just a different way of putting it,’ Xia ruofei thought to himself.

Zhao Yongjun continued,”ruofei, you won’t not give me this little bit of face, right?” I’ve already boasted in front of the stage. If it really doesn’t work out, I’ll pay for the show’s ingredients!”

Xia ruofei laughed bitterly and quickly raised his hand to beg for mercy.”Big brother Zhao, can you stop acting? My brothers have already done so much, it would be too unreasonable of me to disagree! Let’s just do this! I owe everyone a favor!”

Zhao Yongjun finally showed a satisfied smile and said,””That’s the way! Ruofei, I still have to criticize you! You’re really too much of an outsider, kid. After I heard from liangzi today, if it wasn’t for the fact that your wife was here and I had to give you some face, I would’ve slapped you on the spot! It’s a good thing that Gaotai is magnanimous and didn’t make a fuss about it with you, and he’s still willing to cooperate with us, otherwise ...”

“You’re too kind, President Zhao! This is a win – win situation. I have no reason not to support you!” Gao Jun quickly said.

Xia ruofei felt a surge of warmth in his heart and said,””Don’t say anything, it’s all in the wine!”

After he finished speaking, Xia ruofei looked around and then picked up the drink glass in front of him. He finished the drink in one gulp and then picked up the bottle to pour more wine.

He had just drunk six taels of the newly opened bottle of Drunken Eight Immortals and poured the remaining four taels into the glass. The glass was not full yet, so Xia ruofei opened another bottle without hesitation and poured the wine until the liquid level was at the same level as the glass.

Then, he picked up the big cup with both hands and said sincerely,””Gao tai, big brother Zhao, and all the other brothers, let me toast you all! Let’s drink first!”

Xia ruofei raised his head and gulped down half a catty of white wine. Then, he showed the bottom of his glass to everyone and smiled calmly.””Everyone, please do as you please!”𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com
