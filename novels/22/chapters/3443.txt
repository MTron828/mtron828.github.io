Chapter 3444: Obsidian square (2)

Translator: 549690339

Immortal mountain river waved his hand and said,””I know this! I know this! It’s definitely not the time now, but I believe that we’ll be able to meet him soon!”

Qing Xuan Taoist priest heaved a sigh of relief. Although he was full of complaints, he still admired Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei’s talent and his fearlessness in the face of danger made him love talents.

On the seventh floor of the trial Pagoda, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue calmed themselves down and walked through the door formed by the light curtain, hand in hand.

After a familiar tug, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue felt their feet on the ground again.

Xia ruofei turned around immediately. When he saw that Ling Qingxue was still holding his hand, he let out a sigh of relief.

Then, he began to observe his surroundings while being on full alert.

He was now on the 8th level of the trial Pagoda. The tower had a total of nine levels, and the 8th level was very close to the top.

The higher the level of the trial Pagoda, the more difficult it would be. Hence, Xia ruofei did not dare to let his guard down. He was always on edge, ready to deal with any unexpected situation.

Xia ruofei realized that the two of them were standing in a huge square.

If it wasn’t for the fact that the ground had been replaced with black stones, they would have had the illusion that they were still on the square of the 7th floor of the Tower of Trials. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue looked especially small in the middle of such an empty and spacious black stone square.

Xia ruofei kept his guard up as he observed the huge square.

He carefully looked at the black stone under his feet. Suddenly, his eyes focused. He squatted down and touched it with his hand. Then, he moved closer to take a closer look.

“Is there a problem?” Ling Qingxue asked nervously.

Xia ruofei was shocked and said,””Qingxue, did you notice that this square is completely paved with Obsidian?”

“Obsidian?” Ling Qingxue was stunned for a moment, but then she immediately reacted.

“The main material for your flying ship, Obsidian?” she asked after taking a deep breath.

Xia ruofei slowly nodded and said,'”‘Awesome, right? This is what you call big spending!”

Ling Qingxue nodded in agreement and said,””As expected, you are rich and overbearing!”

Obsidian was a very precious material for refining weapons. Xia ruofei’s entire Obsidian flying ship was made of Obsidian. It almost made the jaws of the seniors in the cultivation world, including Chen Nanfeng, drop. They felt that this was too extravagant.

If Chen Nanfeng and the others came here and saw that this seemingly endless square was completely paved with Obsidian, they would be even more shocked.

Xia ruofei roughly estimated that if the Obsidian used to lay the square was used to build his flying boat, he would be able to build hundreds or thousands of them.

With so many obsidian stones, if they were transported back to Earth’s cultivation world, it would probably not even take a fraction to buy the entire cultivation world.

Xia ruofei lifted the restrictions of the mountain and sea realm in the spirit map space, and layman Yuntai, who was hiding in the space inside the mysterious ore, immediately noticed the huge amount of Obsidian.

As a master of refining in the ancient cultivation world, the wealth of the master of cloud platform was quite rich, and he had seen countless precious materials.

However, even layman Yuntai couldn’t help but gasp after seeing so many Obsidians.'”‘Fellow Daoist Xia, where are you? There are so many Obsidians!”

Xia ruofei used his mind to communicate with master Yuntai,””Senior Yuntai, we are already on the eighth floor of the trial Pagoda!”

“Not bad, kid!” Scholar Yuntai laughed and said,”you removed the screen just to let me see these obsidian stones?”

Xia ruofei replied telepathically,”yes!” How was it? Is it spectacular?”

“It is indeed spectacular!” Scholar Yuntai said,”but I’ve finished reading it. If there’s nothing else, I’m going to go into seclusion!”

Xia ruofei quickly transmitted his voice,”don’t be in a hurry!” Senior Yuntai, I don’t know when you’ll wake up again after this closed – door training.”

“Is there something you need from me?” Scholar Yuntai said,”if you have something to say, just say it in one breath!”

“No…” Xia ruofei said,”Grand cloud, this is Obsidian! Aren’t you moved by so many Obsidians? Don’t you want to take all of them for yourself?”

“I’m only in my spirit body state right now, and I can’t refine weapons!” Scholar Yuntai asked,”what do I need so many obsidian stones for?”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He quickly transmitted his voice,'”‘Then… Senior, you might not be able to use it, but I can! So many Obsidians, that was a huge fortune! If they were exchanged for cultivation resources, they could even support a super sect! Can you teach me how to collect these obsidian stones?”

Xia ruofei had just tried to take the Obsidian out of the square. He could not put it into the storage space or even pry it out.

Scholar Yuntai laughed and said,”I knew you would be tempted!” But… You should give up on this idea as soon as possible! It’s impossible!”

Xia ruofei was stunned and asked,'”‘Impossible? Don’t tell me that even senior doesn’t have a way?”

“Yes!” Answered layman Yuntai. Even if I still have my physical body and my cultivation is at its peak, it’s impossible for me to take any of the obsidian stones!”

Seeing that scholar Yuntai was so sure, Xia ruofei immediately dispelled that unrealistic thought.

However, he was still very curious and couldn’t help but ask,””Then why? Are there any difficulties in collecting these obsidian stones?”

“What difficulty?” Scholar Yuntai smiled and said,”these obsidian stones have been tightly locked together by an array. You can see that they are laid on the ground piece by piece, but in fact, on this huge square, all the obsidian stones are equivalent to a whole. The level of the array is extremely high. Even if a primordial soul Stage cultivator were to come here, he would not be able to shake it at all, let alone an Aurous core stage cultivator like you!”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei completely dispelled the idea.

Even immortal soul Stage cultivators could not do anything about it. Furthermore, he had tried it just now, and there was indeed no way.

Layman Yuntai asked again,”is there anything else?” If there’s nothing else, I’ll go into seclusion!”

“Oh! He was fine now! I’m fine now!” Xia ruofei quickly said,”then I won’t disturb senior Yuntai. You can go and cultivate in seclusion!”

When Xia ruofei and scholar Yuntai were conversing, they both stood still. In Ling Qingxue’s eyes, Xia ruofei was just standing there in a daze. Ling Qingxue was also curious, so she couldn’t help but ask,””RUO Fei, what’s wrong? What are you thinking? He’s so entranced!”

Xia ruofei returned to her senses and smiled.'”Tt’s nothing… I was just thinking if I could think of a way to get rid of the Obsidian! This is a huge fortune!”

Ling Qingxue was stunned for a moment, then she giggled and said,””You’re too much! You see … I have taken in a heavenly cloud Palace, and at least I have taken in the control core. You have just reached the eighth floor and you are already holding back to empty their square, this is a bit…”

Xia ruofei also scratched his head in embarrassment and said,””Didn’t I already give up on the idea?”

“This is more like it!”

“I’ve tried it just now, but I can’t take away these obsidian stones. Moreover, they should be locked together by an array and have already become a whole. With my current strength, I can’t dig it out at all!” Xia ruofei said with a bitter smile.

“So that’s how it is!” Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”it seems like you still have some ideas! However, I’m not strong enough….”
