3004 Magical wild tea (1)

Xia ruofei saw Mu Sheng’s exaggerated expression and couldn’t help but find it funny.

However, the wild tea’s fragrance was indeed very rich and unique. Xia ruofei also wanted to try it.

He picked up the tea cup, but unlike Mu Sheng, he did not drink it in one gulp. Instead, he took a small sip first.

After the tea entered his mouth, a strange fragrance spread on the tip of his tongue. It was as if every taste bud cell had started to cheer. At that moment, Xia ruofei felt a warm current rising from his dantian. The vital Qi in his body had actually started to become active.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but reveal a surprised expression. He couldn’t help but gulp down all the wild tea in his cup.

This time, when the cup of tea entered his stomach, the feeling was even more obvious. The speed of the yuan Qi vortex in his dantian had increased a little, and the yuan Qi in all the meridians in his body of different sizes started to surge.

Xia ruofei didn’t even have time to put the cup down. He sat on his seat and started to practice the “great Dao technique”.

With the star picking sect’s Foundation and Luo Qingfeng’s level, they were not close enough to the first heaven society. Therefore, he was definitely not as close as Mu Sheng and the first heaven society. He also did not know much about the rare wild tea.

When Luo Qingfeng saw that Xia ruofei had entered a meditative state after drinking a cup of tea, he could not help but show a worried expression. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Mu Sheng laughed and said,””Don’t worry, sect leader Luo. It’s little brother Xia’s first time drinking this wild tea, so the effect will be more obvious. Now that he has begun to cultivate, this cup of tea will bring him a lot of benefits! However, only the first cup has this effect. When he drinks it in the future, he will be like me, tasting the taste of this top – Quality tea ... By the way, sect leader Luo has never drunk wild tea before, right? You can give it a try, the effect will be very obvious. ”

Luo Qingfeng looked at Xia ruofei, who was cultivating. After hearing Mu Sheng’s words, he was slightly relieved. However, he still did not dare to let his guard down. At least, he would not drink this wild tea before Xia ruofei woke up.

Even though Chen Xuan and Mu Sheng had a good reputation in the world of cultivation, they were still not very familiar with each other. One may know a person’s face, but not their heart. If there was something wrong with the tea, it was impossible for the two of them to fall for it at the same time! Now that Xia ruofei had entered a meditative state to cultivate, Luo Qingfeng naturally had to stay awake.

“Thank you for your reminder, sect leader mu.” Luo Qingfeng said,”but I’ll drink it later! Junior Xia is still cultivating, I’m a little worried ...”

Mu Sheng and Chen Xuan looked at each other and smiled.

They naturally knew what Luo Qingfeng was worried about, but the two of them did not have any bad intentions. As the saying went,”selfless at heart, the world is wide.” They were not offended by Luo Qingfeng’s cautiousness.

Mu Sheng laughed and said,”sect leader Luo is really concerned about little brother Xia!”

Luo Qingfeng smiled but did not say anything. He just stood guard beside Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei was completely immersed in his cultivation and was not aware of the situation around him. He continuously circulated the “great Dao technique” for more than a dozen times before the active vital Qi began to calm down.

Xia ruofei was also secretly shocked. He immediately checked the situation in his body and only relaxed when he did not find anything strange.

Then, Xia ruofei realized that his cultivation had improved by a small step. Although the improvement was not big, it was very difficult for a cultivator to improve after entering the Golden core stage. Xia ruofei estimated that he would need at least half a month to cultivate for this small step.

A cup of tea could actually improve one’s cultivation, and it was so effective. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be secretly speechless.

He slowly retracted his cultivation technique and opened his eyes.

“This wild tea ... Is so magical!” Xia ruofei praised,”this is really eye – opening!”

Seeing that Xia ruofei was fine, Luo Qingfeng was completely relieved.

Mu Sheng and Chen Xuan exchanged glances before Mu Sheng asked,””Little brother Xia, is there any change in your cultivation?”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I won’t hide it from you, sect leader mu. My cultivation has indeed improved.”

Since Mu Sheng, Chen Xuan and the others were not aware that he was in the Aurous core stage, he had to be vague about it.

However, Mu Sheng still raised his eyebrows and said,””I thought ... Your cultivation would at least break through a small realm! The first time a Qi condensation cultivator takes wild tea, their improvement is very obvious. ”

Chen Xuan also looked interested. It was obvious that he had thought that Xia ruofei would be able to use this cup of wild tea to raise his cultivation by a small realm.

Xia ruofei replied without changing his expression,”maybe my cultivation technique is special!” It’s harder for me to break through now than for ordinary cultivators ...”

Xia ruofei didn’t lie. The Supreme – grade golden core in his dantian was harder to form than ordinary cultivators.

Upon hearing this, Chen Xuan revealed a look of envy.””It seems that brother Xia’s cultivation method is of a very high grade! The harder it is to break through, the more solid the foundation is, and the higher your future achievements will be!”

Actually, this wasn’t an absolute statement. Other than the fact that the cultivation technique Chen Xuan mentioned was of a higher grade, there was another possibility. The cultivation technique was extremely inferior, and the cultivation efficiency was extremely low.

Of course, Chen Xuan and Mu Sheng did not think that Xia ruofei, who had the ability to make Chi – amassing pills and fire elemental pills, would be cultivating those cheap martial arts.
