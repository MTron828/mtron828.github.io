2996 The five saint medallions (2)

In fact, the reason why so many golden core cultivators had come to this auction was because of the five sages token. Everyone had come for it.

Hao Qingsong didn’t waste any more time. After a simple introduction, he directly said, “Let’s start the auction now. The starting price of this number four five – Saint token is 70000 spirit stones, and each increment must be no less than 1000 spirit stones. The passageway has been opened, everyone can start bidding!”

The starting price of 70000 spirit stones was the highest in this auction. Most of the auction items had been sold for less than 70000 spirit stones.

This five – Saint token was indeed worthy of being the final auction item.

As soon as Hao Qingsong’s voice fell, the new price appeared on the big screen almost at the same time. Naturally, the hand speed of cultivators was much faster than that of ordinary people.

71000 spirit stones. The bidder was from room number four.

A second later, the price was updated to 72000 spirit stones, the bid from Room 9.

Xia ruofei’s judgment was further confirmed when he saw that the sects whose private rooms were very close to the front were bidding, even though they did not bid much during the entire auction.

In fact, after Luo Qingfeng had explained the situation of the five – Saint token, Xia ruofei already knew that these top sects had probably come for the five – Saint token.

Xia ruofei was not in a hurry to bid. Since the price was changing rapidly, he chose to wait and see.

The price on the big screen shot up, and in a short while, it had reached 85000 spirit stones.

Some of the small sects wouldn’t be able to get so many spirit stones even if they used all their wealth. Therefore, this was almost a watershed. Most of the small sects who participated in the auction with the mentality of getting lucky had basically retreated. The majority of the remaining sects were top sects with room numbers in the top ten.

In Box 6, the cultivators of the soaring Flower Valley who had been forced to withdraw from the competition long ago all had bitter smiles on their faces.

After Liu Mansha bought Xia ruofei’s “the truth of the glittering jewel” handwritten copy, even with the Willow’s 50000 spirit stones subsidy, she was only left with 70000 spirit stones. After the first few rounds of the auction, she had completely lost her competitive edge and could only watch from the sidelines.

“It still affected our big plan ... If only I didn’t buy these two handwritten copies ...” Liu Mansha said helplessly.

Yang Liu consoled her,”Senior Sister, hand – written copies are more important!” Besides, we didn’t expect everyone to be so enthusiastic about bidding. Even if they didn’t spend a single spirit stone, we probably wouldn’t have won!”

“Your 50000 spiritual stones are not enough to buy the pair of phoenixes, so if I didn’t buy the handwritten copy, we should have 150000 spiritual stones. We still have a chance ...” Liu Mansha said.

“The auction is far from over!” Said Willow. Senior Sister Liu, you’re speaking too early ... 150000 spirit stones may sound like a lot, but I don’t think it’ll be enough!”

Yang Liu paused for a moment and said,””Besides ... We already have a five sages token. Even if we can’t get it, it won’t have much of an impact. Whether it’s excavating the ruins of ancient cultivators or exploring treasures, they won’t be able to avoid us!”

Liu Mansha smiled bitterly and said,”that’s true. However ... If it’s taken away by the other two sects, then one of them will have two five Holy badges. When they take action, they’ll naturally have more say!” Didn’t we do our best to snatch the fifth Saint token back then out of this consideration?”

“Senior Sister, things have already come to this. What else can we do?” Yang Liu said with a smile. And what if it was a blessing in disguise? Senior Sister has obtained the “glittering jewel true understanding.” If you can break through to the next level before all five tokens appear, that would be much more important than a five sages token. In the world of cultivation, strength is everything!”

Liu Mansha nodded and said,”since things have come to this, we can only think of it this way.” Let’s just watch from the sidelines ...”

In her heart, she even said,”It was easier said than done for an Aurous core stage cultivator to break through ...

In Box 15, the spirit Vulture mountain cultivator who was also eliminated quickly had an ugly expression. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Uncle Feng, I told you!” Wu Ming said with a cold face. 80,000 spirit stones were nothing, so what was the point of keeping it? Doesn’t this five Holy badges still have nothing to do with us?”

Luo Feng shook his head with a bitter smile, but didn’t say anything.

However, he said in his heart,”I didn’t want to keep these 80000 spirit stones. You’ve given them all out, but they didn’t even want them. That’s why I kept them ...”

“Uncle Feng, what do we do now?” Wu Ming furrowed his brows and said,”it’s all that brat Xia’s fault. If he hadn’t pulled that stunt, not only would we have an extra 50000 spirit stones, but we could also have sold the ‘glittering jewel truth’ for a large sum of spirit stones. Our chances of competing for the five – Saints token would have been quite high.”

Before he came out, sect leader Wu Tiancheng had arranged it this way.

However, no matter how much he thought about it, he still didn’t expect his son to be so good at causing trouble.

If it wasn’t for the fact that Ren suling was in a critical period of her closed – door cultivation and Wu Tiancheng needed to protect her, he would have come out personally this time.

He had sent Luo Feng over, but he couldn’t suppress Wu Ming.

Luo Feng frowned and said,”let’s wait for the results!” If a few top sects managed to snatch it, then we can forget about it and just report it to the sect leader. There’s still one more token that hasn’t appeared yet, so we still have a chance. ”

“What if it was some ordinary guy who obtained it?” Wu Ming’s eyes flickered with a trace of fierceness as he said,”I remember that the kid surnamed Xia has earned quite a lot of spirit stones this time.”

Luo Feng naturally knew what Wu Ming was thinking. He said, “We’ll see! The star Seizer sect isn’t one to be trifled with, and I feel that there’s something strange about this young man with the surname Xia. I can’t see through him ...”

“How evil can it be?” Wu Ming sneered. What could a young man in his twenties do? I’ve observed that there are only two of them. As long as uncle Feng can keep Luo Qingfeng busy, I can take him down by myself. At that time, not only would he have the five sacred badges, but he would also have the pair of Phoenix rings! Moreover, they had obviously mastered the refining methods of the Qi – gathering pill and the fire cloud pill, which were worth a lot of money! If we capture him and bring him back to the Ling Jue mountain, my father will definitely reward us greatly!”

Luo Feng naturally wasn’t a kind person. To be able to reach the Golden core stage in the cultivation world, which one of them wasn’t ruthless and had a will as strong as iron? However, he was relatively cautious and was not as simple as Wu Ming thought.

“If they’ve really managed to obtain the five – Saint token, there’ll definitely be a lot of people eyeing them.” Luo Feng said,”when the time comes, we will not only be facing Luo Qingfeng and Xia Tian. We will also be facing other cultivators with the same goal as us. Therefore, we must be careful.”

“But we can’t just give up like this!” Wu Ming said. At that time, we’ll at least have to follow them and take a look. Perhaps we’ll be able to benefit from it?”

Seeing Wu Ming’s simple thinking, Luo Feng couldn’t help but force a smile and said,””Young sect leader, let’s see! They might not even have the financial resources to compete with the top sects!”

“Yes,” Wu Ming answered in a muffled voice and sat back on the sofa.

The price of the number four five sacred token continued to rise rapidly. After a short while, the price had already reached 95000 spirit stones. There were at least six or seven sects still competing for it.

In room 20, Xia ruofei was speechless. He said,””Qingfeng, it seems like we don’t have enough spiritual stones!”

Xia ruofei had obtained about 150000 spiritual stones this time. However, he had spent 45000 spiritual stones on the flying Phoenix ring, so he was left with 110000 spiritual stones.

“Master,” Luo Qingfeng said carefully.”If we don’t have enough spiritual stones ... Should we use other treasures to pay for it?”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”not for now ... We’ll see how it goes!” I think we shouldn’t be idle and join in the fun!”

After that, Xia ruofei entered a string of numbers into the bidding machine and then submitted.

The price on the big screen was updated to 100000 spirit stones!

This time, Xia ruofei added another 5000 spiritual stones to round up the price.
