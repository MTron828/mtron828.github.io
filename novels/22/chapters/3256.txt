Xia ruofei’s grouping had already taken into account the situation of each sect.

For example, Yang Liu and Yu Xin ‘er were both from the flying flower Valley. If they were arranged to be in the same batch, they would be able to take care of each other and trust each other more. The same logic applied to mu Hua and mu Jianfei from the surging waves sect. As for the first heaven society, there were two golden core cultivators in the first batch. Considering that there were only five spots in each batch, Chen Xuan had to be alone. Shen tianfang and Xu yurou were in the same batch, so they could take care of each other. As for Chen Xuan, with his cultivation, he would not have any worries if he was in the first batch alone. At least, he could protect himself.

Chen Nanfeng, Mu Sheng, and Liu Mansha all smiled and nodded. Chen Nanfeng said,””Fellow Daoist Xia’s arrangement is very good. Let’s split up according to this group!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”If that’s the case, then let’s learn some of the operating procedures of the spacecraft and the things to take note of when using the EVA suit. Of course, you can also experience it in the actual operation process. As for the operation of the EVA suit, we can do a few simple exercises on the ground first. ”

After saying that, he took out the spacesuits and the box of manuals. Chen Xuan and the others also took out their spacesuits.

The members of the exploration team separated the information and read it one by one.

Xia ruofei and the others had already learned some of it on the way here, so they just happened to start from the back. Mu Hua, mu Jianfei, and the others, who were waiting for news in the capital, started from the beginning.

Everyone was a cultivator, so it was very fast to learn something seriously. Not to mention that these were some operational tips. Basically, they just had to memorize it and then practice it a little during the actual operation.

Soon, everyone practiced putting on and taking off the spacesuits a few more times. These spacesuits were very heavy, and under normal circumstances, they needed the help of others to put them on or take them off. However, everyone had mental power. Although some people’s mental power cultivation was very average, they had no problem with simple object control skills. So after a little practice, they basically didn’t need the help of others and could put on and take off the spacesuits with more proficiency.

If an ordinary person were to wear such an EVA suit on the ground, they would basically be unable to move because it was too heavy.

Therefore, when astronauts carried out relevant training programs, they were generally carried out in specially built pools. They used the buoyancy of water to offset gravity and simulate the weightless environment during orbit.

As for Xia ruofei and the others, they were all cultivators. It was not difficult for them to move, but they still felt some difficulty in moving.

For this reason, Shen tianfang, Yang Liu, and the others still had some doubts. They were worried that they would not be able to react in time if they were to be in danger on the moon dressed like this.

Xia ruofei smiled.”The moon’s gravity is only one – sixth of earth ‘s. Anyone on it would be as light as a swallow. When flying in space, there’s almost no gravity at all. So, the spacesuits’ effects are not as great as you think. In addition ... This thing is used to save one’s life. Without a spacesuit, no one will be able to survive for long in a low temperature and vacuum environment. I’m afraid that even a Qi condensation fellow Daoist will only be able to last for a few minutes. ”

“Of course!” Chen Nanfeng nodded and said,”choosing the lesser of two evils is the best plan we can think of at this stage!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.”I heard that primordial soul Stage cultivators can survive in space, but at most, they can only last for one or two days. As for us golden core and Qi refining stage cultivators, without the power of technology, we can’t even think about leaving Earth!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“It’s already incredible that he could last one or two days!” Chen Nanfeng sighed.”The primordial soul Stage ... Is really too far away from us ...”

Chen Nanfeng should be the one closest to breaking through to the next realm among all the Aurous core stage cultivators in the world of cultivation. However, he only saw a glimmer of hope for the nascent Soul Stage. He really did not dare to have any extravagant hopes for the immortal soul Stage, nor did he see any hope of breaking through.

After all, the current cultivation world was too harsh. In the past, with Chen Nanfeng and Chen Xuan’s aptitudes, breaking through to the immortal soul Stage would have been a piece of cake. However, it had now become an unreachable realm.

“Maybe this trip to the moon will give me an opportunity to break through!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”don’t be discouraged, sect leader Chen. You are already very talented to be able to reach such a cultivation level despite the deterioration of the cultivation environment. Perhaps you just need an opportunity and you will be able to break through!”

“Then I’ll count on your blessings!” Chen Nanfeng said with a smile.

He had a chance to reach the original infant stage. He knew it clearly. Just like what Xia ruofei had said, he was only lacking an opportunity to break through. But the primordial spirit stage ... That was too far away.

Xia ruofei saw that everyone was almost done with their practice, so he kept all the operation manuals and put all the spacesuits into the boxes. Then he smiled and said,””The first group of fellow Daoists will board the Flying Ship with me! Let’s carry out the first test flight!”

Chen Xuan and the others nodded in agreement.

Song Wei was worried. She grabbed Xia ruofei’s hand and said,””RUO Fei, you must be careful! If you think it’s too difficult, just give up. Don’t take the risk!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Don’t worry! We’re just going to the low – Earth orbit, there won’t be any danger. ”

He had already gone up with Chen Nanfeng and the others once before, and that time, there were no protective measures at all, so he was still confident.

“You must take good care of Qingxue!” Song Wei said. If anything happens to her, I’ll hold you responsible! Do you know that?”

Ling Qingxue held Song Wei’s hand and said,””Wei Wei, don’t worry! With RUO Fei around, nothing would happen! Besides, we’re just going to test out the spacecraft and spacesuits. We’ll be going to the moon in a few days!”

“I’ll be waiting for your good news at home!”Song Wei nodded.

On the other side, Chen Nanfeng and Liu Mansha were also giving Chen Xuan and the others some instructions. After a while, Xia ruofei, Ling Qingxue, Chen Xuan, Yang Liu, and Yu Xin ‘er greeted everyone and jumped onto the black Phoenix flying ship.

Everyone stood by the ship’s side and waved to them. Then, Xia ruofei steered the black Phoenix flying ship and began to ascend.

Very quickly, the spacecraft was at an altitude of about five thousand meters. At this altitude, the oxygen content was relatively low. Under normal circumstances, ordinary people could breathe normally at an altitude of three thousand meters and below. At higher altitudes, they would feel all kinds of discomfort after a long time. If it was eight or nine thousand meters above ground, without oxygen, ordinary people might faint in less than ten seconds.

Of course, cultivators could still move freely at this height.

Xia ruofei first controlled the flying boat to hover at this height, then smiled and said to everyone,””Everyone, take a break and put on your spacesuits. We’re going to fly into low – Earth orbit.”

Xia ruofei provided the basic data of the nine people’s height and body shape for Elon Musk. It was basically tailor – made, which meant that each person had two sets.

However, the five sets that were handed in first were basically larger in size, so they definitely wouldn’t fit petite girls. However, they could still be used.

On the deck of the black Phoenix flying ship, everyone had put on their spacesuits and transformed into bloated figures.

From this moment on, everyone was breathing in the oxygen provided by the oxygen supply module.

With a thought from Xia ruofei, the black Phoenix flying ship began to ascend again, directly flying out of the atmosphere.
