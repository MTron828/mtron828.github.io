2554 Lost again (3)

The fans who often paid attention to Espanyol’s games knew that the scene looked a little thrilling when the team passed the ball back and forth in the backfield.

Sometimes, when he passed the ball back to the goalkeeper, the other side had already rushed up at high speed, and there were opposing players near several points of the ball. In this case, most goalkeepers would choose to send the ball out with a big kick, or even directly destroy the sidelines.

However, in such a dangerous situation, Spain would still choose a short pass or even a cross pass in the penalty area, which was frightening.

It was the same with the goal concede just now. The old goalkeeper, Diego Lopez, still chose to pass the ball over when there were already opposing players behind his teammates in front of the penalty area. As a result, the opposing player accelerated forward and directly intercepted the ball.

At this time, the RCD Espanyol’s players in the middle and front field had spread out and launched an offensive formation. As a result, they lost the ball all of a sudden. The result was obvious.

The other party directly took two steps into the penalty area and made a shot. Just as Diego Lopez was about to get down and save, he turned his ankle and made a pass.

The defense in the middle had completely lost its position. Without anyone marking him, Gamero pushed the ball at close range, while the goalkeeper, Diego Lopez, had lost his center of gravity and could only watch as the ball entered the net.

3:2, the home team once again exceeded the score.

At this time, the game time was close to 70 minutes, and many players were almost at their physical limits.

Many Spain players had a feeling that they had lost the game after conceding another goal at this time.

In the remaining twenty minutes of the game, Valencia would definitely strengthen their defense in the hope of holding on to their one – point lead. It would not be easy for Spain to equalize the score again.

Wu Lei was helpless. Xia ruofei’s stunning shot had leveled the score. However, due to a mistake in their backfield, the point that was almost in their hands had flown away.

He was a newcomer and couldn’t blame his teammates in the backfield. He could only walk to the center circle with his head down.

Xia ruofei walked to Wu Lei and patted his shoulder. He smiled and said,””Lei Zi, the match is not over yet, don’t be discouraged!”

“It’s such a shame to concede so many goals,”Wu Lei said helplessly.

“It doesn’t matter. The game is not about who concedes fewer goals, but who scores more!” Xia ruofei smiled.”Since we’re behind again, we’ll just try to score more goals!”

“It’s easier said than done ...” Wu Lei said with a bitter smile.

“That’s why we have to work hard! I can’t be discouraged at this time!” Xia ruofei said.

Then, he clapped his hands and shouted in Spanish,””Guys! All of you raise your heads! The match was not over yet! We’re only one goal behind! There’s still a lot of time for us to equalize and even overtake the score!”

Although Xia ruofei was not the captain, he was one of the bosses of the club. This special identity, coupled with his amazing free kick technique, made him very prestigious among his team members.

Xia ruofei also saw that everyone was a little discouraged and confused, so he stood up in time to boost the morale of the team. At this time, the captain, Victor Sanchez, was immersed in deep regret and annoyance.

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, the players ‘spirits were lifted.

Xia ruofei said to Wu Lei,”Lei Zi, pass the ball to me after the start of the game. After that, just focus on charging towards the other half of the field!” Run as fast as you can! I’ll pass the ball to the most comfortable position for you!”

Wu Lei nodded heavily. He was not sure if he could turn the score around, but he had absolute trust in Xia ruofei.

At the 73rd minute, Espanyol kicked off again and the game resumed!

After iglasias passed the ball to Wu Lei, Wu Lei passed the ball back to Xia ruofei who was behind him on his right. Then, he rushed to the front field without hesitation. He really used all his strength and quickly overtook the team’s main center, iglasias.

However, Wu Lei did not stop. Even though Valencia’s defensive line was right in front of him, he did not slow down.

Wu Lei believed that Xia ruofei would definitely pass the ball and would not let him be offside.

Sure enough, after Xia ruofei and his teammates backcourt passed the ball twice, he quickly raised his hand for the ball. Without any hesitation, mark Roca passed the ball to Xia ruofei again.

At this moment, Xia ruofei turned his body to face the goal. He did not stop the ball. Instead, he made a half – turn and the ball suddenly changed direction and flew towards the front field at high speed.

Just as Xia ruofei made his move, Wu Lei had already crossed the opponent’s defensive line.

As Valencia’s defender chased after Wu Lei, he raised his hand at the assistant referee to signal for Wu Lei to be offside.

However, the assistant referee had clearly seen that when Xia ruofei had passed the ball, Wu Lei had not been in an offside position at all, so naturally, he had not been moved.

Wu Lei quickly turned his head to take a look and saw the ball fly past him and land not far in front of him on the right. The ball did not accelerate after it landed, so Wu Lei caught it very comfortably.

He took the opportunity to lead the ball forward and saw that the front was a wide expanse of flat land.

However, Valencia’s defender was also very fast. As soon as Wu Lei started to speed up, the defender, Voss, was already behind him.

Woos pulled Wu Lei’s Jersey very discreetly. Wu Lei was in the stage of accelerating forward. Although he did not use much strength, it destroyed Wu Lei’s center of gravity. Wu Lei suddenly fell on the grass and angrily spread his hands at the referee.

The main judge’s angle was very good. Although woos ‘movements were very hidden, he could see them from his angle. Therefore, the main judge didn’t hesitate to blow his whistle and quickly ran to the scene of the incident.
