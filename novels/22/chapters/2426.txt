2427 Strong intimidation (1)

Although song Rui was usually arrogant, he was, after all, a child of a big family. After being influenced for so many years, as long as he was not an idiot, he still had this basic sense of sharpness.

Hence, after hearing Xia ruofei’s words, song Rui fell into deep thought. After a while, he said,””I know, don’t worry! I know what to do!”

“It’s good that you understand!” Xia ruofei said,”alright, I’m busy! If there’s nothing else, I’ll hang up first!”

“What are you busy with all day?” Song Rui couldn’t help but complain again,”the clubhouse is almost completed, but I’ve only seen you come a few times! I’m always busy ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’m someone who does great things!” How could they pay attention to a small project like the club every day? Besides, with you brothers here, what do I have to worry about?” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Does your conscience not hurt?” Song Rui rolled his eyes and asked.

Xia ruofei and song Rui bickered for a while before hanging up the phone.

He went into the bathroom and took a hot bath. After changing into comfortable cotton home clothes, he locked all the doors and windows. Then, he set up an alarm array in the house before returning to the bedroom and summoning the spirit map scroll from his palm.

Xia ruofei stuffed the scroll into his blanket and entered the space.

Ever since he met the modern cultivator last night, Xia ruofei had become more cautious. In the past, he would lock the door and windows tightly and at most leave a trace of his spiritual power to keep an eye on the outside world before entering the medium.

After arriving at the mountain and sea realm in the spirit map space, Xia ruofei first went to take a look at the work of the free laborers who had been recruited.

What Xia ruofei saw was a bustling scene of labor.

Not only had the construction of the herb garden been greatly accelerated, but there were also some people who were busy in the paddy fields.

The rice field was an experimental one. Xia ruofei wanted to try out the rice grown in the spirit map space. If the improvement was obvious, he would consider doing a few generations of breeding in the space and try to grow it in the outside world.

Under Xia Qing’s arrangement, the staff was in good order. Bao Guijun and the first batch of free labor were now appointed as team leaders. Each of them was very enthusiastic. They led the way to work in the herb garden and paddy fields, and at the same time, they did not forget to supervise the other free labor.

As for the others, most of them had already accepted their fate after living in the boundless space for so many days. They had also realized the importance of points. Every day, Bao Guijun and the others could take advantage of the breaks in between work to smoke. Without points, how could they get cigarettes?

The luxury items in the realm were all very expensive. Even a pack of ordinary cigarettes that cost seven or eight Yuan would cost them the points they earned after two or three days of work. For free labor who could maintain their basic survival, it was definitely a luxury.

Bao Guijun’s basic points were higher than theirs. In addition, he tried to save on smoking after exchanging for cigarettes. He only smoked one or two a day, at most two or three. One pack of cigarettes could last him for more than ten days. That was why he was willing to exchange his hard – won points for cigarettes.

Xia ruofei walked around and was satisfied with the free laborers ‘mental state.

Then, he came to the mobile room where Bao Guijun and the others lived. Manzila was lying on the bed recuperating. When he saw Xia ruofei suddenly come in, he quickly sat up and greeted respectfully,””Master!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand. He first looked around the mobile house and found that it was very clean and tidy. The blankets on each bed were also folded in an angular manner.

As for the air ... In the spirit map space, the air was definitely several levels higher than the outside world, even in the group dormitory where many people lived.

Xia ruofei nodded in satisfaction and asked in English,””How’s your recovery?”

“Master, I’m already trying to recover, but it will take a long time for my bones to recover, so I can’t move freely for the time being ...” Manzilla said with some fear.

In fact, Manzila was still considered an entry – Level cultivator, and his body was much better than the average person ‘s. However, this was a fracture, after all. Even if the recovery speed was faster than the average person, it could not be completely recovered in a few days.

Xia ruofei replied indifferently,”it’s fine. I’m not in a hurry. I don’t lack the food to feed a few idlers.”

“Yes ... Yes ...” Manzilla said with a smile.

“The last time I asked you about the modr mercenary group, your performance was quite satisfactory.” Xia ruofei said,”I hope that after you recover, you can show that kind of loyalty when you work.”

“Don’t worry! Master!” Manzila said with confidence,”Manzila will always be your loyal believer! I’ll never dare to betray my master!”

Xia ruofei pouted and did not respond to Manzila’s words.

Everyone knew how to say pretty words. Xia ruofei would not believe Manzila just because she was like a docile puppy now.

This seemingly harmless old African was the one who had personally founded the infamous modr organization. Countless people had died directly or indirectly at his hands.

Not only Manzila, but all these free laborers in the realm were also very obedient. In the past, none of them were easy to deal with, but now they just didn’t have the opportunity to do so.
