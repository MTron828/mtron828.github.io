2205 Confession (1)

“RUO Fei, this new cultivation method ... Is it really that powerful? If I cultivate a few more times, won’t my cultivation catch up to yours?” Ling Qingxue then asked,”Oh right, what about you?” After you finished cultivating, did you have a breakthrough in your cultivation?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it’s not that easy for me to break through!” However, it’s also an obvious improvement. ”

Xia ruofei’s current cultivation was at refined Qi level 8, and his spiritual power had even reached the spirit gathering realm. His cultivation was much higher than Ling Qingxue ‘s, so the improvement was naturally not as obvious.

Although he was about to break through to refined Qi level 9, after today’s practice, he had only advanced a step further from the foundation of the peak of refined Qi level 8. It could be said that he had completely touched the threshold of refined Qi level 9. The only thing he was lacking was the last step.

When one’s cultivation base had reached this realm, every breakthrough was extremely difficult.

It could be said that the amount of true Qi needed to break through from the peak of refined Qi level 8 to refined Qi level 9 was definitely more than the amount needed to break through from refined Qi Level 3 to refined Qi Level 4.

His spiritual power cultivation had also advanced by a large realm. This time, he had only taken a big step forward from the foundation of the initial stage of the spirit gathering realm. He had not yet reached the intermediate stage of the spirit gathering realm.

Of course, the efficiency was relative.

Although Xia ruofei’s cultivation level did not increase as rapidly as Ling Qingxue ‘s, compared to his usual self – cultivation or joint – cultivation with Ling Qingxue, this increase was still very gratifying.

If he were to rely on his usual cultivation, it would take at least ten to twenty days for his cultivation to increase by so much. However, he had only cultivated for two hours.

Xia ruofei continued,”Qingxue, don’t expect too much from this technique. It’s the first time you’ve come into contact with spirit – body combination cultivation. The effect will be more obvious.” “In the future, when we do spirit body joint cultivation, the effect will be reduced by a lot. Of course, it won’t continue to decrease. In the end, it will stabilize at a certain level. No matter what, even if it decreases again, the effect will definitely be much better than the joint cultivation we used to do.”

“I know ...” Ling Qingxue said.

For a moment, she had not recovered from the shock of her cultivation level increasing rapidly. She even checked her own cultivation level from time to time, afraid that it was just her illusion and then returned to reality in the blink of an eye.

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”alright, there must be a limit to the spirit and body combined cultivation.” In fact, it’s the same for any cultivation technique. You have to do it step by step, and there are definitely no shortcuts, unless it’s an evil cultivation technique. You Must Remember This. ”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but ask,””RUO Fei, then this” absolute beginning Heart Sutra,”will it ...”

“Don’t let your imagination run wild. This is an authentic Daoist cultivation method!” Xia ruofei guessed what Ling Qingxue was going to ask and answered directly.

Ling Qingxue let out a sigh of relief and said,””That’s good ... That’s good ...”He said.

Xia ruofei reached out and flicked her head affectionately. He smiled and said,”What are you thinking about every day? Can I give you an evil cultivation technique to cultivate?”

Ling Qingxue was a little embarrassed as she said,””I was just asking. I know you’re good to me ...”

“It’s good that you know!” Xia ruofei said.

The two of them stood up and walked out of the time formation. Xia ruofei kept the precious time formation flags.

The two of them didn’t spend a long time cultivating. Only a few minutes had passed outside the array.

“Qingxue, you rest here for a while. I’ll put away the array flags first!” Xia ruofei said.

“Mm! I’ll be under the sun for a while!” Ling Qingxue said.

She had a special love for sunbathing on the sea, yesterday, and today.

Xia ruofei took the time array flag and walked down the stairs to the cabin.

He naturally wouldn’t leave the time array flag outside. After avoiding Ling Qingxue’s line of sight, he put the array flag directly into the spirit map space.

However, Xia ruofei did not go out immediately. Instead, he went to the large bathroom in the master bedroom to wash his face.

He turned off the tap, put his hands on the sink, looked at himself in the mirror, and said to himself,””Xia ruofei ... Running away is something only cowards do! You’re a man! And it was the blood Wolf that had once frightened the enemy! Ping Sheng hated deserters the most! A real man will take responsibility for his actions!”

Xia ruofei mumbled to himself like a Chuunibyou. It made him more determined. This was also a psychological hint.

After he finished speaking, he wiped the water droplets off his face and strode out of the cabin.

Ling Qingxue was still on the deck of the flying bridge, smiling as she enjoyed the sea breeze. When she saw Xia ruofei, she smiled and said,””RUO Fei! Come and enjoy the scenery with me! The vast ocean was truly magnificent! I feel like my heart has opened up a lot!”

Xia ruofei thought to himself,”no matter how open – minded you are, I’m afraid you won’t be able to accept it later ...

Ling Qingxue didn’t notice Xia ruofei’s strange behavior. She continued to wave at Xia ruofei and said,””What are you doing? Hurry up and come up!”

“Oh!” Xia ruofei responded and walked up the stairs to the deck of the bridge.

Looking at the carefree smile on Ling Qingxue’s face, he felt guilty for no reason.

However, at this point, Xia ruofei did not want to back down.

He took a deep breath and stared into Ling Qingxue’s eyes.””Qingxue, there’s something I want to tell you ...”

Ling Qingxue, who was originally facing the sea, turned to look at Xia ruofei. She smiled and asked,””If you have something to say, just say it! Why did you suddenly become so serious?”

Xia ruofei took two steps forward and held Ling Qingxue’s hand. He brought her to the soft sofa in the middle of the deck and sat down.

Seeing Xia ruofei’s serious expression, Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but ask,””What’s going on?”

“Qingxue, there’s something I have to tell you.” Xia ruofei held Ling Qingxue’s hand tightly and said,”do you remember the time when I left the three mountains for a foreign land?”

Ling Qingxue blinked and said,””You go out often! On the contrary, he didn’t have much time to stay in the three mountains! No... What are you trying to say?”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. “It’s fine if you don’t remember. What I want to tell you is that I went to xiangnan province. To be specific, it was an ancient tomb in Yuezhou ...”

“Ah?” Ling Qingxue’s eyes widened.”You ... You’re not going to Rob a tomb, are you?”

Xia ruofei said awkwardly,”that’s not the point ... I got the news that there are some things in the ancient tomb that are very useful for cultivators. So, I rushed over immediately.” By the way, I found the spiritual crystal you used for cultivation in that tomb!”

Xia ruofei’s words were half true and half false. His purpose of going to the ancient tomb in Mount Yu was to find the world stone. The spiritual crystals were just an additional reward. However, the world stone was related to the secret of the spirit map scroll, so he naturally couldn’t say it. Moreover, spirit crystals were also very precious treasures to ordinary cultivators.

As expected, Ling Qingxue immediately exclaimed,””Waa! There were spiritual crystals there! RUO Fei, it seems like you’re quite lucky!”

Ling Qingxue was already a cultivator, so she naturally knew that without spiritual crystals, she would probably still be at Level 1 Qi refinement if she only relied on absorbing the spiritual Qi in the air to cultivate in such a barren environment. If she was unlucky, she might not even be at the elementary level!

But now, she was already at the peak of refined Qi Level 3 and could break through to refined Qi Level 4 at any time. The gap was so big that the preciousness of spirit crystals could be seen.

“The person who told me this news is Song Wei. Do you still remember her?” Xia ruofei nodded.

“Of course, she’s Secretary song’s daughter!” Ling Qingxue replied.

Xia ruofei felt a little awkward, but he concealed it well.

He continued,”Song Wei studied archeology. She once excavated the tomb. However, due to various reasons, they gave up on the excavation halfway. The tomb was also buried again. However, she was more familiar with the situation inside, so she personally took me to Yuezhou ...”

“Oh ... And then?” Ling Qingxue asked.

She did not know why Xia ruofei was telling her all this, but she felt a little uneasy.

Xia ruofei had no choice but to fire the arrow. He continued,””After we arrived in Yuezhou, we found the tomb very quickly and dug a hole to enter the tomb ... But the difficulty was greater than we thought. We encountered many dangers along the way. We even had a slim chance of survival!”

“Ah?” Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but exclaim.

Although she knew that Xia ruofei was standing in front of her unscathed, she could not help but feel nervous when she heard Xia ruofei describe the trip to the tomb.

Xia ruofei then told Ling Qingxue about his experience in the ancient tomb on Mount Yu.

Of course, it was impossible in the first place. He would naturally hide the parts that involved world stones.

But he didn’t hide anything else, and he didn’t cut anything out or add anything.

At first, Ling Qingxue felt a little uncomfortable with Song Wei by Xia ruofei’s side. However, as Xia ruofei continued to talk, she couldn’t help but be immersed in it. Xia ruofei and Song Wei’s experiences in the tomb were linked one after another. It made her extremely nervous, but at the same time, she felt a little excited.

Ling Qingxue only heaved a sigh of relief when Xia ruofei told her that he had successfully obtained the spiritual crystal and saved Song Wei from the ancient tomb.

She could not help but ask,”ruofei, you said that Song Wei had fainted. How is she now?” Are you alright now?”

When Ling Qingxue heard that Song Wei had taken such a huge risk to help Xia ruofei find the spiritual crystal and that she was almost possessed by the spiritual body, she felt a little uncomfortable, but that feeling disappeared. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Especially when she heard that Song Wei was unconscious, she was even more concerned from the bottom of her heart.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel even more nervous because the core issue was about to be solved ...

He took a deep breath and continued,””Song Wei is fine now, don’t worry! However, it was indeed very dangerous at that time. She was almost possessed by that spirit body, so her soul injury was more serious. What’s more dangerous is that when the spirit left her body, it planted a very poisonous poison called the peach blossom miasma ... If it’s not removed in time, Song Wei will become a zombie driven by her instincts!”
