Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei sent a WeChat message over.”I’m at your threeo’ clock.

Song Wei immediately looked to her right and saw Xia ruofei. She dragged her luggage and walked over.

The two of them did not greet each other very familiarly. Song Wei sat down beside Xia ruofei as if they were meeting in the underground.

Although the probability of meeting an acquaintance in the airport was very low, the two of them tried to keep a low profile as much as possible.

Xia ruofei said to Song Wei as he flipped through the magazine,””Give me your id, I’ll get my boarding pass.”

“En!” Song Wei quickly passed her ID card to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei received it without a trace. He stood up, tidied his clothes, and then walked to the check – in counter.

He got the boarding pass very quickly. They didn’t have any large luggage to check in, so the procedures were naturally very fast.

Xia ruofei turned around and saw that Song Wei was already dragging her luggage towards the security check.

Hence, he walked over to her. When they passed each other, Xia ruofei accurately stuffed the boarding pass and ID card into Song Wei’s hands.

The two of them found two different security checkpoints, lined up to pass the security check, and entered the departure hall.

Compared to the busy Hall outside, there were fewer people in the departure hall. The two of them walked together naturally.

Xia ruofei and Song Wei showed their first – Class boarding passes at the entrance of Heron Island Airlines ‘VIP waiting room and entered the VIP waiting room with fewer people.

The VIP waiting room was very quiet, and all the seats were placed in a disorderly manner. In addition, there were some bonsai and screens separated from each other, so the privacy was quite good.

The two of them found two adjacent leather seats and sat down. Then, they couldn’t help but smile at each other.

“This feels like a spy film!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Song Wei couldn’t help but smile and said,””Isn’t it all to help you run errands? This is the first time I’ve lied to my parents!”

Naturally, Song Wei did not dare to tell her parents that she was returning to the ancient tomb. Otherwise, song Qiming would lock her up at home without hesitation and send people to watch over her.

The last time Song Wei was poisoned, her whole family was already drenched in cold sweat. If it wasn’t for Xia ruofei’s timely intervention, Song Wei would have been dead by now. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Song Qiming and his wife did not even support Song Wei’s participation in the normal field archaeological activities organized by the school, let alone Song Wei’s desire to explore the terrifying ancient tomb again.

Therefore, Song Wei told her parents that they should take the opportunity to travel to other places to relax during the few days before the holiday.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Actually, there’s no need for you to take the risk with me. You just need to tell me the location of the tomb and the details of the situation inside.”

Song Wei snorted and raised her head,”You want to shake me off? No way!”

“Hehe ...” Xia ruofei laughed but did not say anything.

“Ruofei, when we reach the place, you can’t ditch me and go in alone!” Song Wei said warily. Otherwise, I’ll really cut off all ties with you!”

Until now, Song Wei had not told Xia ruofei the exact location of the ancient tomb. She only asked him to buy a ticket to the provincial capital of Hunan, Tanzhou city.

“Do I look like a dishonest person?” Xia ruofei asked, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.

“That’s hard to say ...” Song Wei chuckled,”I’m going in with you anyway!”

“Alright, alright, alright!” Xia ruofei forced a smile and said,”but you have to promise me that once we enter the tomb, you must listen to my instructions and not act rashly. Other than the poison, there are other risks.”

“No problem!” Song Wei agreed readily.

The two of them sat in the VIP lounge and chatted for a while. Then, the announcement of their flight starting to board sounded on the broadcast. The VIP lounge was scheduled to board a little earlier than the economy Class passengers.

The two of them quickly boarded the plane through the covered bridge. Under the guidance of the beautiful first – Class cabin crew, they came to the first – Class area at the front of the cabin and found their seats.

After putting his luggage in, Xia ruofei put on his headphones and started to listen to music. However, his eyes were looking outside through the Oval – shaped porthole. His mind had already flown to xiangnan province.

Song Wei, on the other hand, sat in the aisle seat. This was something she had requested. Every time she took a plane, she would never sit in a seat by the window.

Song Wei leaned against the soft back of the first – Class seat and turned her head slightly to look at Xia ruofei’s side profile. Her beautiful eyes were filled with a strange glow.

They were about to enter the ancient tomb again. It would be a lie to say that she was not afraid. However, at this moment, Song Wei was more excited than nervous. She and Xia ruofei had secretly flown out of the city without telling her family and friends. This gave Song Wei a sense of excitement.

After all the passengers had boarded, the flight attendant closed the cabin door.

After waiting for a while, the plane trembled slightly and slowly retreated with the help of the tractor.

When they reached the runway, Xia ruofei saw through the porthole that the tractor had left the plane. The ground crew showed the pilot the latch in their hands and waved.

Xia ruofei immediately felt the plane shake slightly and start to move forward.

After going through a runway, the plane finally stopped at the take – off point of another runway.

After a slight pause, the plane began to accelerate.

The engine had been adjusted to the take – off thrust. Xia ruofei could clearly feel the push on his back, which meant that the aircraft was accelerating at a high speed.

Soon, the plane took off lightly and drew a perfect arc in the sky.

The two – hour flight was neither long nor short. Fortunately, the first – Class flight was very comfortable. Besides, Xia ruofei and Song Wei had many common topics. They chatted along the way and felt that they had a deeper understanding of each other.

At noon, the flight from Heron Island Airlines finally landed smoothly at tan Zhou’s huanhua International Airport.

Xia ruofei and Song Wei did not have to hide from people anymore since they were in an unfamiliar place. They dragged their luggage and walked out of the departure hall of huanhua airport.

Breathing in the air of xiangnan province, Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Song Wei, can you tell me where our destination is now?”

Song Wei smiled and said,”there’s no rush. Let’s take a taxi to the hotel first. We’ll rest for half a day today and visit the famous places in tan Zhou. We’ll leave tomorrow morning!”

Xia ruofei shrugged his shoulders and smiled bitterly.””You’re so tight – lipped!”

“It’s such an important matter, of course I have to keep it a secret!”Song Wei chuckled. Otherwise, what if you sneaked away tonight?”

“Alright ...” Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

The two of them stood by the road, ready to take a taxi to the hotel they had booked in advance.

Just as Xia ruofei and Song Wei walked out of the departure hall of the airport, both sides of the passenger passage were filled with police forces. There were uniformed police officers and plainclothes police.

A group of people walked out of the VIP passage. In the middle of the crowd was the leader of xiangnan province, song Rui’s father, song Zhengping.

Ever since he had been promoted to the position of chief, song Zhengping had become busier. On an important holiday like the Spring Festival, as the Secretary, he had to stay in xiangnan. On New Year’s Eve, he had to visit the people on the frontlines who were holding fast to their posts. On the first day of the first lunar month, he had to visit old comrades and so on.

He had been busy until yesterday, when he finally managed to find time to return to the capital to pay his New Year’s greetings to the old master and gather with his relatives and friends.

After a day, song Zhengping brought his Secretary back to xiangnan.

Other than his Secretary, the other people who accompanied him were all sent by the Provincial Party Committee to pick him up.

As the leader of xiangnan, song Zhengping had a very high level of security.

Everyone escorted song Zhengping out of the main hall and into a black sedan with a red flag parked at the entrance. The security personnel and the people who were there to welcome them also got into their respective cars. A small fleet of cars started slowly and headed in the direction of the Provincial Party Committee.

Just as the exhausted song Zhengping was about to close his eyes and rest for a while, he happened to see a familiar figure by the roadside through the car window ...
