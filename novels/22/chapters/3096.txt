3097 Tea – testing (1)

Star picking sect, star picking tower.

Luo Qingfeng stood respectfully beside Xia ruofei and called out in joy,””Master!”

Xia ruofei smiled and kept the black flying boat. He asked,””Has everything been fine in the sect recently?”

“Master, everything is fine!” Luo Qingfeng said,”after the transformation of the sect – protecting array, the cultivation environment in the sect is much better than before. The disciples have been making rapid progress recently!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”let’s go down and talk!”

The two of them stepped on their flying swords and returned to the building from the roof of zhaixing tower. They came to the private room of Luo Qingfeng on the top floor.

After Xia ruofei sat down, he said,””I’m here mainly for the wild tea. ”

Luo Qingfeng was overjoyed and said,””Master, you’ve already successfully planted the wild tea?”

“The transplantation was a success, and I’ve also produced the first batch of tea leaves. However, whether it can achieve the same cultivation – enhancing effect as the first heaven sect’s wild tea leaves still needs to be verified.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”that’s the main reason why I came back today.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

When Luo Qingfeng heard that Xia ruofei had already made tea leaves, he could not help but look shocked.

It was mainly because the time was too short, which made Luo Qingfeng feel a little incredulous.

Xia ruofei saw Luo Qingfeng’s confusion and said with a smile,””I used a time formation, so the tea trees grew faster.”

Luo Qingfeng suddenly looked enlightened and said excitedly,””Master, if we can also mass produce wild tea, it will be a great help to the sect’s strength!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””So, we need to verify the effects of wild tea first. Qingfeng, I’ll have to rely on you. Find two reliable disciples from the sect and let them try this wild tea. ”

“Yes! Master!” “Yes,” Luo Qingfeng said without hesitation.”A few of my direct disciples are very talented ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”don’t find those talented disciples yet!” Right now, we still don’t know the effect of the wild tea. If the effect of promoting cultivation is limited after taking it ... You should know that this wild tea is only effective when taken for the first time, so it’s best to find those disciples with ordinary talent but relatively high loyalty. This way, even if there are losses for the sect, it’s still within an acceptable range. ”

Luo Qingfeng came to a sudden realization and quickly said,””I understand! Please rest assured, master, this old servant can find a suitable candidate. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” You’ll personally arrange this matter! Bring the person over tomorrow morning, and I’ll personally check on him. ”

“Yes! Master!” Luo Qingfeng said,”master, your room is ready. It’s getting late now. If you don’t have any other instructions, may I take you to your room to rest?”

In fact, Luo Qingfeng had already prepared a room on the top floor of zhaixing tower for Xia ruofei’s use.

Xia ruofei had not been in the star picking sect for the past few days, but this was the best room in the entire star picking tower. There were disciples in charge of cleaning it every day, and it was always ready to move in at any time.

Xia ruofei nodded.”That’s good. Let’s go and rest.”

……

The next morning, Luo Qingfeng personally brought an exquisite breakfast to Xia ruofei’s room.

Xia ruofei had just finished washing up. He smiled and said to Luo Qingfeng,””Sit down and eat together! You’ve prepared so much, I can’t finish it all by myself. ”

“Master, this old servant has already had breakfast!” Luo Qingfeng said respectfully,”please enjoy your meal. I’ll be at the door at any time.”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”you can eat some even if you’ve eaten!” Sit down! Let’s talk while we eat. ”

Hearing this, Luo Qingfeng could only say,”yes!” Then ... This old servant will overstep my authority ...”

“Sit, sit, sit!” As Xia ruofei spoke, he picked up the bowl of millet porridge and took a bite. Then, he picked up a white steamed bun and took a bite. As he chewed, he asked,”Qingfeng, have you found a disciple to test the effects of wild tea?”

“Master! This old servant has already decided on the candidates last night!” Qingfeng Luo quickly stood up and said.

Xia ruofei said,”sit down and talk!” Sit down and talk! You should eat too! I’m not used to it when you’re watching me eat!”

Luo Qingfeng had no choice but to take a bite of a bun. Xia ruofei was used to it, but Luo Qingfeng felt a little uncomfortable.

After all, in his heart, his master was the heavens! Eating at the same table as the master, this was simply overstepping the boundary!

“Continue!” Xia ruofei said as he chewed on the steamed bun and the millet porridge.

“Yes!” Qingfeng Luo said,”both of them are my direct disciples, and they are both at the eighth Qi layer. They are already 45 or 46 years old. Among all the disciples at the eighth Qi layer, their talent is considered below average, but their loyalty is definitely not a problem!”

“Mm! This person is not bad!” Xia ruofei nodded and took another mouthful of porridge.

“Master, the two disciples are already waiting on the first floor of zhaixing tower. They can come up at any time!” Luo Qingfeng said.

Hearing this, Xia ruofei finished the bun in a few mouthfuls, then the millet porridge. He stood up and wiped his mouth.””Then don’t let them wait too long, call them up! Let’s go to your cultivation room and have them come in one by one to see me. I’ll check on them!”
