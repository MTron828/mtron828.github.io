Xia ruofei touched the world stone and couldn’t help but smile.

With a thought, the world stone disappeared from the secret room with a’ whoosh’. In the next moment, the entire realm stone appeared in the spirit map’s space. Xia ruofei had sealed it up with layers of space cages. He had done this to guard against Bai Qingqing.

In reality, without Xia ruofei’s permission, Bai Qingqing would not have been able to break through the barrier between the mountain and sea realm. This was because that barrier involved the foundation of the entire spirit map world. Even if Bai Qingqing’s comprehension of space doubled, she would not have been able to break through that barrier.

Xia ruofei did this out of habit.

After keeping the most important world stone, Xia ruofei immediately started to look for the computer that Manzila had mentioned.

In fact, he didn’t need to look for it, because the laptop was placed on a desk in the secret room, and it was very eye-catching.

Xia ruofei walked to the desk, sat down, and turned on the computer.

A few seconds later, the computer entered the system login page.

Xia ruofei entered the system password that he had gotten from Manzila and mumbled to himself, ” “The computer’s configuration is not bad ...”

After entering the system, Xia ruofei immediately clicked on the skeleton pirate flag icon on the desktop.

It was a browser that was developed by the modr organization. There were many talents in the organization, so the development of the browser was not too difficult. This browser was specially developed for the modr organization’s intranet.

Only through this browser and the hardware Ukey could one log into the internal network of the modr organization.

Of course, in the end, they still needed an account password. Different account passwords would also correspond to different privileges.

Manzila’s account naturally had the highest authority.

The first page of the pirate flag browser was the internal website of the mord organization.

Xia ruofei entered the password that Manzila had provided and successfully logged into the website.

After entering the intranet, Xia ruofei clicked into the sub-page of the dark shadow Squad and found the list of tasks without much effort.

This list recorded in detail the time, client, transaction amount, completion status, and so on of each business.

Xia ruofei looked through the list carefully. There were not many requests from Huaxia. He quickly found the one that involved the assassination of song Qiming.

The record for this business was also very detailed. The Commission was one million dollars, and the remarks column had been marked with the word ” mission failure ” and listed the losses.

The task was entrusted through the internet.

It was not surprising that the mord organization had its own internet channel to place orders. In the age of the internet, if they could only accept missions in places like small taverns like in the last century, their business would have been closed long ago.

In fact, many assassin organizations had their own internet channels to place orders and collect deposits and commissions through some anonymous bank accounts. They naturally had their own ways to escape the tracking and surveillance of the internet.

Xia ruofei’s heart sank when he saw that the order was placed through the internet. This was because the modr organization might not even have detailed information about the client.

He frowned and looked at the client column. As expected, the client was called ” Mr. Lu. ” Was it ” Mr. Lu ” or ” Mr. Lu “? It could also be “Mr. Lu.”In short, there were many possibilities.

But it was obviously a Chinese surname.

Of course, this name couldn’t be accurate. After all, anyone with a brain would use an alias for such a thing. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

‘ This is a little troublesome ...’ Xia ruofei thought as he frowned.

He continued to study the information carefully. Suddenly, a column caught his attention. The deposit of the deal was 200000 dollars. Only after receiving the money would the modr organization receive the details of the target and send people to carry out the mission. The 200,000 dollars had been transferred through a Swiss bank account, and the bank account name displayed on the screen was ” Mr Liu. ”

Mr. Liu? Xia ruofei couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows. He naturally thought of the huge Liu family in the capital.

Could it be the Liu family? Xia ruofei’s mind was spinning.

He gathered his thoughts and recalled that song Qiming’s incident happened after he started treating elder Liu. Before that, he basically admitted that he had attacked Liu haojun. Although he did not leave any evidence behind, the Liu family would definitely be able to confirm that he was the one who did it.

Then, a few days after he treated elder Liu, Song Qiming was assassinated.

Could it be that the Liu family couldn’t bear the resentment in their hearts, so they privately sought out the modr organization?

But this was also somewhat illogical! Firstly, he had already started treating old man Liu. If he were to anger him now, it would not do the Liu family any good. On the other hand, even if the Liu family hated him to the core, why would they go after song Qiming? Moreover, he had killed song Qiming directly. This was worth discussing. After all, song Qiming was not directly related to him. On the contrary, if song Qiming was really assassinated and the mastermind behind the scenes was exposed, it would definitely cause a huge uproar.

The losses of house Liu’s actions completely outdid their gains!

Xia ruofei analyzed for a while. He felt that it was not very reliable to think that the Liu family did it just based on a bank account. After all, it did not seem possible from a motive.

What’s more, the client’s information might be an alias, and the bank account might not be registered with real information. Many banks abroad could even leave their names anonymous, but the security was slightly less. The other party did not recognize people, only tokens. As long as one had the token given by the bank, they could withdraw money, transfer money, and other operations.

Even if this information was true, there were too many people with the surname Liu in the world. How could it be related to the Liu family?

Xia ruofei furrowed his brows and touched his nose. He didn’t expect that he still couldn’t find out anything about the mastermind even after investigating to this extent. He couldn’t help but feel a little disappointed.

However, Xia ruofei’s eyes quickly focused on the computer screen.

He found another piece of information that might be useful.

In addition to providing users with a remote platform to place orders, mord’s internet channel also collected as much user information as possible.

Here, he noticed a note next to the client column. An IP address was recorded on it. It was the IP address used by the other party when placing the order.

Although this IP was likely to be a meat machine, Xia ruofei did not plan to let go of this clue.

He did a quick check. It was easy to find specific information with this kind of fixed IP. He found that the IP address came from a province in northwest China and was posted on a company’s website.

Xia ruofei immediately searched for information on the company and his face darkened. It was a small company controlled by the Liu family.

At this moment, Liu haojun’s face appeared in Xia ruofei’s mind ...

If it was really the Liu family’s doing, then Liu haojun was undoubtedly the most suspicious. After all, he was the only one who had a bone – deep hatred for Xia ruofei. Furthermore, he had never known why he had been defeated at the three mountains. Now that Xia ruofei had indirectly admitted to it, the news would definitely reach Liu haojun.

Liu haojun had fallen from being the Liu family’s Star of Hope and God’s favored son to his current state all because of Xia ruofei. When he heard such news, it was hard to guarantee that he would not lose his mind.

As for why he chose to kill song Qiming, he was not too sure.

Xia ruofei couldn’t sit still anymore. He took out a phone from his storage space, entered Zhao Yongjun’s number, and dialed it ...
