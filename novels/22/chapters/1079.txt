She did not consider Feng Jing and Xia ruofei’s feelings at all. They flew all the way from San Shan, but she stood them up and was caught in contact with other cosmetic companies. However, she did not feel guilty at all. Instead, she acted as if she was in the right and felt that it was natural.

This made Xia ruofei, who was watching coldly from the side, frown. His impression of this Little Star, who was so different from the image she had packaged herself as, became even worse.

However, other than dissing Dong Xinyu at the start, Xia ruofei did not say anything after that. He believed that Feng Jing would be able to handle the situation.

Li Yao was already a little unhappy that he was ignored when he handed his business card to Feng Jing. He said,””No hurry, no hurry ... Miss Feng, you haven’t finished your words! What do you think your company’s main business is? Maybe we’ll have a chance to cooperate!”

Feng Rao glanced at the exasperated Fang Hongli and said,””Boss li, our paradise Corporation is about to launch a new skin care product. We’ve already discussed the endorsement deal with miss Dong’s manager.”

Li Yao’s face slightly changed. He glanced at Fang Hongli indifferently with a trace of displeasure in his eyes.

However, he was also very shrewd. He quickly put on a smiling face and clapped his hands.”Hahaha! I didn’t expect it to be a peer! I’m really sorry, but our Yafu group also has high hopes for miss Dong, and we’d like to invite her to be the spokesperson for our new product!”

“Mr. Li, our company has already reached an agreement with miss Dong,” Feng Jing said with a slight frown.

“Hahaha! Is that so?” Li Yao turned his gaze to Dong Xinyu’s manager, Fang Hongli.

Fang Hongli panicked and said,””Boss Feng, you can’t just say that. We only agreed to have a talk with your company!”

Dong Xinyu raised her face and sneered,”that’s right!” What do you mean by reaching an agreement? that’s just wishful thinking on your part! Did I sign an agreement with you?”

“Yes!” Feng Jing replied,”we’ve already paid the 100000 Yuan in full. I’ve also brought the bank statement!”

“It’s just an intent gold. Any company that wants to work with Xinyu has to pay an intent gold. This doesn’t mean that Xinyu has to work with your company!” Fang Hongli immediately replied.

In fact, Li Yao didn’t pay any money.

Even if Fang Hongli had more guts, she wouldn’t dare to ask Li Yao for an intent fee! For a company as large as the Yafu group to be willing to use a newbie like Dong Xinyu was already an opportunity that they did not even dare to dream of.

Originally, they could have signed the contract when they met tonight. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Although Li Yao looked at Dong Xinyu with a burning gaze, and his words hinted that if Dong Xinyu could ‘accompany’ him properly, this endorsement contract would definitely not be a problem, Dong Xinyu herself would not care about such things.

Her management company had packaged her as a pure and innocent girl, and she also had an image of an obedient girl on screen. However, how many people in the entertainment industry were truly pure? At the very least, Dong Xinyu was not.

As long as Li Yao was willing to pay, Dong Xinyu did not mind spending the night with him.

Seeing that they were about to come to an agreement, Feng Jing came to the restaurant and exposed everything, Fang Hongli was furious.

Dong Xinyu also sneered and said,”you have the nerve to take out 100000 Yuan?” Don’t you know the rules? We just want to confirm your company’s sincerity. If it’s a shell company that can’t even come up with 100000 Yuan, do you think I’d waste my saliva talking about a cooperation?”

Li Yao leaned back in his chair, looking at Fang Hongli and Dong Xinyu’s face with interest.

He laughed and shrugged at Feng Rao.””Miss Feng, it seems like miss Dong has made her choice!”

In fact, Feng Jing had already made her decision, so she didn’t show much emotion.

She didn’t pay any attention to Li Yao. Instead, she looked at Fang Hongli calmly and said,””If that’s the case, please return the 100000 Yuan to us!”

Fang Hongli said coldly,”don’t worry!” There’s no need for us to be greedy for this 100000 Yuan. However, our company’s finance department has to go through the process to approve it. You can go back and wait!”

“How long do you need? can you give me a time limit?” Feng Rao asked.

Fang Hongli said impatiently,””At least 30 working days! Wasn’t it just 100000 Yuan? Do you think we’re embezzling money?”

“A small company is just a small company. It’s full of petty people ...” Dong Xinyu said with disdain.

Xia ruofei was so angry that he laughed out loud. Dong Xinyu was the one in the wrong. She was the one who went back on her words, and in the end, she was still so righteous. Back then, when she wanted the 100000 Yuan, she had to ask the company to transfer it within a day. Now, because of her, the cooperation had been canceled, and the refund had to be done within at least 30 working days. Moreover, Dong Xinyu and Fang Hongli looked at her with disdain. It was not easy for their character to be so bad.

Feng Jing felt guilty. She had inspected so many celebrities and had only chosen one of such quality. She had even dragged Xia ruofei to the capital, so she felt even more guilty.

Without waiting for Feng Jing to reply, Xia ruofei said,””I’ll give you three days to return the money. If you don’t ...”

“How is it? Bite me!” Dong Xinyu interrupted Xia ruofei with a sneer.

Xia ruofei looked at Dong Xinyu calmly and said,””I’m afraid I’ll dirty my mouth if I bite you. Don’t worry, if you don’t get a refund after three days, you’ll be begging to send the money to our company soon. ”

“Woof! Your tone isn’t small!” Li Yao said jokingly,”those who don’t know better might think that your company is opened in ****!”

Xia ruofei didn’t even look at Li Yao. He took Feng Jing’s hand and said,””President Feng, let’s go!”

Dong Xinyu was also stunned by Xia ruofei’s words. She only regained her senses after he had pulled Feng Rao away. She was so angry that she spat,””Bah! What kind of person was that! Two country bumpkins from other provinces, acting like they’re worth 20000!”

Then, Dong Xinyu said to Fang Hongli,””Sister Fang, in the future, don’t bother with such a small and messy company! If we want to cooperate, we have to find a multinational group like Yafu!”

“You’ve made a wise decision, miss Dong!”Li Yao laughed.

Dong Xinyu quickly winked at Li Yao and said,””President li, this company came to us a few days ago. At that time, we didn’t know that there was a chance to work with Yafu, so we reluctantly got in touch with them. You won’t blame me, right?”

“How can I blame you?” Li Yao laughed. But ... You have to make it up to me tonight ...”

Dong Xinyu said shyly,”boss li is so bad!” How do you want me to compensate you?”

Li Yao’s burning eyes swept across Dong Xinyu’s body unscrupulously. He stuck out his tongue and licked his upper lips. He chuckled and said,””You’ll know when the time comes!”

Fang Hongli’s face was a little embarrassed, but she was secretly relieved. Fortunately, Dong Xinyu had fully utilized her advantage and explained in a soft and coquettish tone, which also removed The Grudge in Li Yao’s heart.

Li Yao raised his glass of red wine and said with a smile,””Miss Dong, miss Fang, I wish us a happy cooperation!”

After the three of them clinked their glasses and took a sip of wine, Li Yao continued,””By the way, I heard that miss Dong is going to play the second female lead in ‘the angel of doom’ soon? I still have quite a few friends in the industry. When the time comes, I’ll help you call them and let the crew take care of you!”

Dong Xinyu was overjoyed when she heard this. She quickly said,””Then I’ll thank brother li in advance!”

After a while,”boss li” became “brother li”, and the change was very natural.

Li Yao laughed and said,”you have to seize the opportunity yourself!” It was easy for her to become famous if she acted in such a big film produced by an international company and played such an important role as the second female lead! The more famous you are, the more effective your endorsement for our company will be!”

“Definitely, definitely!” Dong Xinyu hurriedly said.

“Come, come, come, let’s eat, let’s eat!” Li Yao said,”Zola’s caramelized pudding is quite special. Try it, miss Dong ...”
