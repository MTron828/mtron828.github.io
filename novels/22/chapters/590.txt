Chapter 591: Ling Xiaotian’s moments (3)

Xie Xun grinned, revealing two rows of teeth that had turned yellow from the smoke.””Young man, I’ve crossed more bridges than you’ve walked, so you don’t have to use words to run me down. How about this, as long as all six of your fish are blood red Dragons, I’ll buy them all for two million each. ”

Xia ruofei smiled faintly, but his smile quickly disappeared. He shook his head and said,””Not much.”

“What do you mean? Are you scared?” Xie Xun chuckled and said,”I haven’t even said what I would do if the fish you brought isn’t a Blood Red Dragon! Aren’t you too timid, child?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but roll his eyes. Xie Xun’s mouth was really foul. No wonder he was so unpopular.

“You’ve misunderstood me, director Xie. I mean ... Two million might not be enough to buy my fish ...”Xia ruofei said calmly. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Li Zongheng and the others were stunned for a moment before they burst out laughing.

Ling Xiaotian naturally would not let go of the opportunity to attack Xie Xun. He pointed at Xie Xun and said,””You old brat! He wanted to buy RUO Fei’s top quality Blood Red Dragon for two million? You must be blind!”

Xie Xun flew into a rage out of humiliation. He glared at Xia ruofei and said,””Young man, you’re very good with words! However, you can’t just rely on your mouth to tell the truth! Which one of them wasn’t an expert in ornamental fish? Why don’t we have a bet?”

“I’m not interested in two million,”said Xia ruofei, curling his lips.

“You don’t want it even if it’s free?” Xie Xun said,”young man, if all six of your fish are the best blood – Red Dragons and are not any worse than the pair in old Ling’s house, I will give you two million! I’ll pay you however much the fish costs, and if you lose, you’ll still have to pay me two million in cash. Do you dare to bet?”

On one hand, Xie Xun was annoyed by Xia ruofei’s words. On the other hand, based on his past experience, he felt that it was unbelievable for Xia ruofei to take out six blood – Red Dragons in one go. He had seen Ling Xiaotian’s pair of Arowana before. They were top – notch in every aspect. However, Xia ruofei took out six of them at once, and their quality was not inferior to Ling Xiaotian’s pair. In his opinion, this was simply a fantasy.

Xia ruofei acted as if he had just realized something and said,””Oh ... Two million isn’t the money for the fish! Then I’ll bet!”

Ling Xiaotian’s friends were all laughing as they watched the show. Li Zongheng looked at Xia ruofei with a thoughtful expression.

......

Xie Xun immediately said,”okay, everyone here is a witness!” We’re all ornamental fish experts here, so Li, you four will be the judges. Ling and I won’t be joining. Young man, is that okay?”

Xia ruofei nodded without hesitation.””No problem!”

“Third brother Xie, you can’t go back on your word!” Ling Xiaotian chimed in immediately.

“I’m going back on my word?” Xie Xun rolled his eyes and said,”I was worried that he wouldn’t be able to take out the money if he lost!”

“You don’t have to be afraid of that. If RUO Fei loses, I’ll transfer two million to you on the spot!” Ling Xiaotian said.

“Then it’s a deal!” Xie Xun immediately said,”young man, take out your Arowana!”

Xia ruofei smiled at Xie Xun and said,”Thank you, director Xie ...”

Then, Xia ruofei walked to the back of the pickup truck and opened the back of the truck. Li Zongheng, Xie Xun, and the rest immediately gathered around to take a look. After the little episode just now, everyone’s interest had been raised to the maximum.
