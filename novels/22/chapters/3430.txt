Chapter 3431: Getting through the danger (1)

Translator: 549690339

What scared Xia ruofei the most was that after he entered the Archean realm, he immediately checked the situation outside and realized that the high – Level Mirage beast was already trapped in the trap and kill array.

If he had not activated the trap and kill array while he was retreating, the high – Level Mirage beast would have killed him several times in the one or two minutes he was trapped in the illusion.

This time, it could be said that Xia ruofei had made a turn at the gates of hell. In fact, he had one foot in the gates of hell.

Even so, Xia ruofei was still in danger.

After the high – Level Mirage beast was trapped in the trap and kill array, it also started to charge left and right madly, trying to break the array and continue to pursue Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei had only activated the trap & kill array in a hurry and did not attack the high – Level Mirage beasts. Hence, the trap & kill array was in a passive position.

Fortunately, the high – Level Mirage beasts were best at illusionary attacks, and the array was a dead object, so it would not be affected by the illusion. In terms of physical attacks, the high – Level Mirage beast was much weaker than the high – Level Star Beast, so it had not caused serious damage to the trap and kill array yet.

Xia ruofei immediately controlled the array in the spirit map space and activated the attack mode of the trap & kill array. He did not care about the consumption of energy and turned the attack mode to its strongest.

Then, he waved his hand and took a petal of the spirit Heart Flower and swallowed it.

His internal injuries immediately began to heal at an extremely fast speed.

There was a 30 – fold difference in the flow of time between the spirit map space and the outside world. Hence, Xia ruofei’s time was relatively more abundant.

Xia ruofei rested for a while in the yuanchu realm and his injuries were almost fully recovered.

He observed the situation outside. The high – Level Mirage beast was still trapped in the array. At this time, it could no longer launch continuous attacks on the array because the dense black rays had made it look a little awkward.

After all, the Mirage beast’s movement speed was not that fast, and the attacks of the array were always saturated, so there was very little space to Dodge. Therefore, this high – Level Mirage beast was not having an easy time now.

Xia ruofei did not dare to leave the spirit map space.

Because the illusion of a high – Level Mirage beast was really terrible. Once he was in the outside world, even if it was within the range of the array, he could not guarantee that he would not fall into the illusion again. If that were the case, he might not be as lucky as he was this time.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei could also control the array in the spirit map space.

Furthermore, time flowed 30 times faster at the Archean realm than the outside world. He could react even faster. If there were any unexpected situations, he would be able to react in time.

After Xia ruofei’s injuries recovered, he focused on the situation outside. He kept controlling the array to attack the high – Level Mirage beast with precision.

In fact, when this high – Level Mirage beast’s illusion failed to kill Xia ruofei in one blow and it tried to attack but was stopped by the trap and kill array, it meant that it had no chance.

Especially since it was trapped in the trap and kill array, it meant that it would be difficult for it to escape.

As long as the trapped person was unable to forcefully break the formation, it was only a matter of time before they were killed. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

In fact, the Mirage beast’s physical defense was not as good as the Star Beast’s, and its speed was also much worse. Under such intensive attacks, it could last even less time than the high – Level Star Beast.

When the first black light landed on its body, it meant that there was no turning back.

The blazing fire started to burn on the wound. The high – Level Mirage beast let out a shrill cry and its body was frozen.

After this short pause, the black rays of light attacked one after another. For a time, the high – Level Mirage beast was hit five or six times by the black rays.

In a short while, it had already turned into a ball of fire and was rolling on the ground, no longer able to attack the formation.

Xia ruofei stayed in the spirit map space until the high – Level Shen beast stopped breathing. He waited for a while and used his spiritual power to observe the burnt high – Level Shen beast. After confirming that it was indeed dead, he left the spirit map space and returned to the outside world.

Outside, it was another Jiangnan garden with pavilions and waterside pavilions. The high – Level Mirage beast’s body had shrunk by a size because of the fire, and it was curled up on a Stone Road.

Xia ruofei looked at the corpse of the high – Level Mirage beast with lingering fear.

It was too dangerous just now. He was on the line between life and death.

Xia ruofei had also witnessed the power of the powerful illusion. He recalled the scene just now and realized that he had fallen into it unconsciously. When he felt himself in the spaceship, he really felt that he was on his way to the moon. He could not remember everything that had happened in the mystic realm’s Tower of Trials. He did not even know that he had broken through to the intermediate golden elixir realm.

One could imagine that no matter how high one’s cultivation was, if there was such an illusion that could make one instantly sink into it, and even die without knowing why, wasn’t it very terrifying?

What’s more, there was a sea serpent beast outside. Even if Xia ruofei was not killed in the illusion, the sea serpent beast could still attack him. Xia ruofei, who was immersed in the illusion, was not prepared at all. Even if the sea serpent beast’s attack was not as powerful as the Star Beast, it could still kill Xia ruofei easily..
