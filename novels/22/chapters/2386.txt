2387 Waiting for the rabbit (1)

The next night, at nineo’ clock.

An abandoned warehouse in the southern suburbs of Usuda.

Under the dim street lights, the door of the warehouse was left ajar. The streets outside had long been very quiet. The area was not very peaceful. There were often fights between local gangs, so the nearby residents basically did not come out after dark.

The street was quiet. Only a drunkard staggered out of a small path, held the electric pole, and retched a few times. Then he sat on the ground, leaned against the electric pole, and fell asleep.

At this time, at the end of the long Street, the sound of leather boots stepping on the ground could be heard.

The three of them walked down the street. The dim street light shone on them, casting long shadows on the street.

The one in the middle was a woman with a slim figure. She was wearing a sexy black leather shirt and pants, and she was playing with a dagger as she walked.

There were two men standing on either side of the woman. One of them had a muscular body and a scar on his face. The other man was a little thin. His light black skin did not look like an African, but more like a South American. He always had a faint smile on his mouth, looking indifferent.

The three of them walked side by side in the direction of the abandoned warehouse.

The woman in the middle licked her lips and said slowly,””Big guy, what do you think the Wizards called everyone back for?”

The burly man on the woman’s right said in a muffled voice,””Something big must have happened! Maybe it’s a big business deal?”

The Thin Man said frivolously,””What kind of big business needs everyone to gather? Is the Magus trying to lead everyone to establish their own sect?”

The beautiful woman frowned and said,””Kitt! If you die one day, it must be because of this mouth! Can’t you tell what you should say and what you shouldn ‘t?”

The skinny Kitt laughed,””Tina, you’re too timid! What’s there to be afraid of when we’re talking in private? Everyone says that Great Satan is powerful and omnipotent, but who has ever seen Great Satan? On the other hand, the Magi’s methods were truly powerful! If you ask me ...... Maybe Lord Satan is just a fictional character of the Magi!”

The graceful beauty Tina berated,”shut up!” Are we allowed to discuss Lord Satan’s matters? Kitt, if you want to die, don’t drag us down!”

Kitt shrugged and said,”Tina, this doesn’t seem like the famous snake Beauty’s style!” Just a name and you’re scared? Last time in Southeast Asia, when you cut that native farm owner into a bloody man, I didn’t see you being scared!”

Tina snorted coldly and didn’t bother with Kitt.

Kitt felt a little bored, so he stuck his head out again to look at the burly man next to Tina and joked, ” “Big guy, if the Magus really wanted to lead everyone to establish their own sect, what would you do? Will you continue to be loyal to Lord Satan, or will you follow the Wizards? ” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The burly man scratched his head and said, ” “I’ll listen to you! It was fine as long as there was money to be earned! It didn’t matter who he was working with. But you two have been taking good care of me, so I don’t want to be separated from you ...”

“Big guy, you’re quite sentimental, aren’t you? “Kitt laughed.

Although Tina, who was walking in the middle, did not say anything, a smile appeared on her face.

The three of them were the elite killers of the shadow team organized by Morde. They had been working together for several years, and this small team of five had been reduced to three now. Although two of them had died in the process of carrying out the mission, the remaining three had become more and more familiar with each other.

For the past year, the Wizards had been trying to add more people to their team, but Tina had rejected them all.

In Tina’s opinion, the three of them were enough to deal with the most difficult mission. If they added more people, they would need to get used to it.

Since the three of them were the most powerful members of the shadow Squad, Bason did not go against their wishes and forced them into the team.

This time, Tina and the other two were on vacation in South Africa. After seeing the signal sent by the wizard Bason on the internet, they immediately took a plane back to Ethiopia. Because of the flight delay, they arrived at the airport a lot later than usual. They rushed to Usuda without stopping and finally arrived before the deadline.

The three of them chatted as they walked toward the abandoned warehouse.

Although they seemed to be walking with ease, they had already developed the habit of being on guard at all times after living in the dark World for so many years. Their attention was also always very focused.

Soon, the three of them walked from the other end of the street to the warehouse.

The door of the warehouse was ajar, and a faint yellow light shone through.

Just as the brawny man was about to push the door open, Tina suddenly raised her arm and shouted,””Wait a moment!”

The burly man stopped in his tracks out of reflex, and Kitt, who had been frivolous just a moment ago, also subconsciously leaned back to the burly man, his pair of sharp eyes scanning the surroundings.

“We should be the last batch to arrive,” Tina said.”Don’t you think ... It’s too quiet inside?”

Kitt was on alert as he said,””Maybe it’s a prank? Or was this an assessment? The Magi need to choose the strongest team to carry out a big mission?”

“Before we’re sure, any possibility exists ...” Tina said calmly.

“Are we still going in, then?” asked the robust man.

“Of course we have to go in!” Tina said,”otherwise, how would we know what’s going on? However, from now on, we need to be on high alert. ”

In fact, Tina was a little inclined to Kitt’s judgment just now. She felt that this might really be a special assessment to test their ability to deal with the situation at the last minute and their ability to adapt to actual combat. Maybe there was really a big mission that they had to carry out!

Thinking of this, Tina could not help but feel a little tempted by the great mission of the Pi Xiu. While it meant high difficulty, it also meant high rewards.

They were in this line of work to make money. As long as they paid, they were responsible for solving the customer’s problem completely, so there was no right or wrong.

As for the possibility that Bason was threatened and sent signals to trap the members of the shadow team, it was possible.

However, Tina and the other two did not think in that direction.

As far as they knew, Bason was extremely powerful and had many tricks up his sleeve. How could such a master be held hostage? Moreover, based on their understanding of Bason, even if he fell into the hands of the enemy, Bason would not work with the enemy. If they fell into the hands of the police or the enemy, they would not be able to escape death, no matter whether they cooperated or not. Rather than being tortured to death, it would be better to commit suicide as soon as possible.

Bason, who had cultivated countless poisonous creatures, had at least a hundred ways to end his life in an instant.

Therefore, Tina and the other two subconsciously ruled out the most dangerous possibility.

Tina pulled out a pistol from her waist, while Kitt and the big guy each took out their own weapons. Kitt had three throwing daggers between his fingers, while the big guy took out an AK submachine gun from his backpack.

The three of them skillfully formed a battle formation with their backs against each other. The big guy facing the warehouse gently pushed the door open, and then they carefully moved into the warehouse step by step.

The large warehouse was empty. A few wires hung down from the roof, and the light bulbs hanging on them gave off a dim yellow light, which was not enough to illuminate the entire warehouse.

After entering the warehouse, the three of them quickly observed the situation in all directions.

Tina’s eyes focused. She found a chair in front of her, and a person was sitting on the chair with his back facing them. There seemed to be a person curled up on the ground in front of this person, who was being stepped on by this person.

Tina’s expression turned cold as she pointed her gun at the man’s back and said, “Don’t move! Put your hands behind your head and stand up slowly!”

The big guy and Kitt only took a quick glance from the corner of their eyes, but they didn’t turn around. Instead, they continued to maintain a vigilant posture toward Tina’s two flanks.

The man sitting with his back to them didn’t seem to care about being pointed at with a gun. He smiled in a relaxed manner and said,””Not bad, you’re very vigilant!”

Tina’s voice became even colder. “I’ll say it for the last time. Immediately stand up with your hands on your head and slowly turn around! I’ll count to three. If you don’t do as I say, I’ll shoot immediately!”

After saying that, Tina expressionlessly counted,””One!”

At this time, her finger was already on the trigger, and she pulled back a little. The pistol was actually in a pre – firing state.

“Two!” Tina’s voice was getting colder.

To their surprise, the person sitting on the chair laughed and said,””I’ll help you count! Three!”

“You’re looking for death!” Tina said with a hint of killing intent.

At first, she was worried that this person might be the employer of this “big mission” and was deliberately testing them here, but now she had the intention to kill him.

No matter who this person was, she had already used up all her patience. If he was really a big customer, he didn’t need such a stupid customer!

Tina had killed at least dozens of people. Killing people was as simple as drinking water and eating food for her. After she had the intention to kill, she pulled the trigger gently without any hesitation. To a top – tier assassin, no matter how angry or impatient he was, his movements must be very gentle when he fired. This was because if he used too much force, it would cause his movements to be distorted, which would greatly reduce the accuracy of the shot.

After pulling the trigger, Tina’s eyes revealed a hint of cruelty.

Every time she harvested a life, she would feel an inexplicable sense of pleasure, and this time was no exception.

However, Tina’s expression instantly froze. The gunshot did not sound.

She found that she couldn’t pull the trigger at all, as if someone had it stuck behind the trigger.

Not only that, but Tina and the other two also felt that their bodies were bound by an invisible force. They could only maintain their current posture, and it was difficult for them to even move their fingers.

The three of them were shocked and didn’t know why such a situation would happen.

At this moment, the person sitting on the chair finally stood up. He slowly turned around, revealing a young face.

This person was naturally Xia ruofei, who had been “waiting for an opportunity”. Of course, he still had the face of a Southeast Asian.

Xia ruofei looked at the three people he had captured with a relaxed expression and said,””You guys should be the last batch. The others shouldn’t be coming. In that case ... The hunting operation can end now!”
