Chapter 3418: The appearance of a super – grade golden core (2)

Translator: 549690339

At this moment, he realized that the Golden core in his dantian had become much more solid than when he had just broken through. If one were to quantify it, it would be about one percent.

This was already a heaven – defying performance. Without the Vermilion Jade Fruit, it was impossible to achieve such a speed.

What did it mean to increase one percent after one cultivation? As long as he maintained the same speed, he would be able to break through from the middle stage of the Aurous core stage to the late stage in a hundred days!

Xia ruofei usually cultivated by himself. Whether it was through the use of the Taixu xuanqing formation or other auxiliary means, it was basically impossible for him to break through to the advanced stage of the Aurous core stage within a hundred days without a great opportunity.

The first thing Xia ruofei did when he opened his eyes was to turn to look at Ling Qingxue.

Almost at the same time that Xia ruofei looked over, the true Qi in Ling Qingxue’s body trembled. Then, Xia ruofei realized that Ling Qingxue had already broken through to refined Qi Level 5!

Ling Qingxue obviously hadn’t reached her limit yet. Even half a Vermillion Jade Fruit contained a huge amount of energy for a Qi refining cultivator.

Ling Qingxue was still cultivating with her eyes closed. The true Qi in her meridians was surging like thunder, and her cultivation level was rising steadily.

Seeing this, Xia ruofei was overjoyed.

From the looks of it, Ling Qingxue was very likely to break through two levels and reach the sixth level of the Qi refining realm.

The energy from the Vermilion Jade Fruit should be enough, but it all depended on whether Ling Qingxue could grasp the opportunity.

Ling Qingxue was still cultivating without any distractions. After Xia ruofei watched her for a while, he suddenly had an idea.

When he absorbed the Vermilion Jade Fruit just now, he didn’t feel like he was going to be full. According to Yuntai scholar, an Aurous core stage cultivator could only take one Vermilion Jade Fruit. If he took more, his body would explode and he would die.

However, Xia ruofei clearly felt that it would not be a problem for him to eat the remaining half of the Vermilion Jade Fruit.

Of course, Xia ruofei did not have any evidence. It was all based on his intuition.

The half Vermilion Jade Fruit was still floating in the air. Xia ruofei had split a portion of his spiritual power to hold it up.

When Xia ruofei’s gaze fell on the Vermilion Jade Fruit, his desire to eat it grew even stronger.

Finally, after weighing the pros and cons for a long time, Xia ruofei controlled his spiritual power and took the Vermillion Jade Fruit.

Layman Yuntai had also been paying attention to Xia ruofei’s situation. He had personally witnessed the entire process of Xia ruofei breaking through to the intermediate stage of the Golden elixir realm. He should be the only witness. There were only Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue here. Ling Qingxue was still in her cultivation state and had no idea about Xia ruofei’s situation.

When Xia ruofei took the half Vermillion Jade Fruit and was about to eat it, scholar Yuntai immediately noticed it.

He quickly shouted,”fellow Daoist Xia!” Fellow Daoist Xia! Quickly stop!”

Xia ruofei stopped and used his spiritual power to communicate with master Yuntai.””Senior Yuntai, what’s wrong?”

“What’s wrong? Didn’t I tell you that golden core cultivators can only take one Vermillion Jade Fruit at most?” Asked layman Yuntai.

“Indeed, but this junior feels that there is still more power to spare.” Xia ruofei said,”I can’t take this half of the Vermillion Jade Fruit with me. It’s a waste to leave it here…”

“How can we have the spare energy?” asked scholar Yuntai. Didn’t you feel like you were about to explode just now?”

“I didn’t!” Xia ruofei said.

“You don’t feel anything at all?” Scholar Yuntai continued to ask,”it’s the kind … The meridians are about to burst, but the energy of the Vermilion Jade Fruit is still pouring in…” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“I really don’t feel anything…” Xia ruofei said innocently and then asked,”senior Yuntai, in my condition … Can I try to eat another half?”

Scholar Yuntai hesitated for a long time before saying,””This … The information I read in the sect’s ancient records states that Aurous core stage cultivators can only take one pill at most. For some Aurous core stage cultivators with weaker foundations, even taking one pill will be dangerous. Fellow Daoist Xia, you’ve already taken one, so I suggest that you don’t take any more risks…”

In the hidden space that was enshrouded in purple mist, the green – robed elder who was observing Xia ruofei’s every move through the mirror in front of him could not help but curse,””You’re short – sighted! A frog at the bottom of a well! This little kid had cultivated brother mountain river ‘s’ great Dao Arts ‘. Furthermore, he was extremely talented and had even formed a Supreme – grade purplish – Gold golden core. What was the big deal with eating half an additional Vermilion Jade Fruit? I don’t think he’ll be in any trouble even if he eats both of them!”

Layman Yuntai was in his spiritual form and could only communicate with Xia ruofei by using his spiritual power. However, the green – robed elder in the hidden space was enshrouded in purple Qi and could easily hear the conversation between Xia ruofei and layman Yuntai. His methods were truly unpredictable.

However, the green – robed elder could only complain. He couldn’t and couldn’t warn Xia ruofei.

After Xia ruofei heard what scholar Yuntai said, he fell into deep thought. After a long while, he raised his head and said firmly,””Senior Yuntai, I still want to try it first. If it’s possible to take more Vermilion Jade fruits, it’ll be very helpful in improving cultivation!”

Scholar Yuntai was silent for a while and sighed,””Fellow Daoist Xia’s talent is unparalleled. Even if you cultivate step by step, your achievements will be limitless. In fact, there is no need to take risks for half a Vermilion Jade Fruit… Forget it. Since you have made up your mind, I will not persuade you any further. However, I still hope that you will be more cautious. Why don’t you cut a small piece and try it out?”

“Thank you for your concern, senior Yuntai.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I know what to do. It should be fine.”

With that, Xia ruofei no longer hesitated and directly put the remaining half of the Vermilion Jade Fruit into his mouth.

As soon as the half Vermilion Jade Fruit entered Xia ruofei’s mouth, it immediately turned into liquid and he swallowed it.

Xia ruofei immediately felt the surging energy flowing into his meridians.

The ‘great Dao technique’ began to operate on its own and began to absorb the pure energy in the Vermilion Jade Fruit.

Xia ruofei could feel that his meridians were under great pressure. It was obvious that after he had consumed the Vermillion Jade Fruit, he was close to saturation and was more or less “overloaded” now.

However, at the same time, Xia ruofei was relieved because the feeling of satiety was still within his control. Moreover, the great Dao Sutra’s absorption rate was extremely high. As soon as he took the Vermilion Jade Fruit, a large amount of energy was absorbed into Xia ruofei’s dantian along with the circulation of the great Dao Sutra, filling the purple – Gold golden elixir that had just formed.

This was like a pressure cooker. With a solid and stable exhaust valve, the internal pressure would naturally decrease.

Xia ruofei sat cross – legged in peace and continued to activate his cultivation technique to absorb the massive energy in the Vermilion Jade Fruit.

As time passed, the purplish – Gold golden elixir in Xia ruofei’s dantian became more and more solid. Compared to the first Vermilion Jade Fruit, the degree of focus had increased by at least one percent.

Moreover, the energy within the Vermilion Jade Fruit had not been exhausted.

In the end, Xia ruofei had successfully raised his cultivation by about two percent.

This way, three percent of the progress had already been completed!

After Xia ruofei had absorbed the last bit of energy in the Vermilion Jade Fruit, he unwillingly kept the technique and stood up.

It was only then that he realized that Ling Qingxue had already finished her cultivation and was looking at him with a face full of joy.

“Qingxue, how’s the harvest?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“Can you guess?” Ling Qingxue asked with a smile.

“Refined Qi Level 6!” Xia ruofei said with certainty,”! don’t think you’ve reached refined Qi Level 7, right?”

Ling Qingxue’s cherry – like mouth opened slightly, then she said,””How boring! You must have checked my cultivation …”

“I really don’t have any!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”don’t forget that I’ve just finished cultivating too. I’ve spent more time than you! However, I also absorb the Vermilion Jade Fruit, so I’m well aware of the energy contained in it.. I know how effective this energy is for Qi condensation cultivators!”
