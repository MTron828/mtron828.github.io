Time passed by quietly as the three of them chatted. Before they knew it, Xia ruofei had already completed the acupuncture treatment.

When he pulled out the last silver needle, Liang Qichao didn’t notice it until he saw Xia ruofei start to disinfect the needle with alcohol. He then asked in surprise,””You’re done with the acupuncture?”

“I’m done! “Xia ruofei laughed.

“It feels so fast!” Liang Qichao laughed drily.’The last time I was treated, I would fall asleep and couldn’t feel it at all. So this is how acupuncture works! My entire body feels warm and comfortable!”

“You did enjoy it, but acupuncture is very tiring!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”if the Chinese medical Masters in the country were to do this kind of acupuncture, not to mention the cost, they wouldn’t be able to do it for a few days in a row. Their bodies wouldn’t be able to take it!”

“RUO Fei, it’s been hard on you!” Liang Qichao said gratefully,”why don’t we stop the acupuncture? 1 think I’m recovering pretty well just like this. It doesn’t matter even if it’s a little slower. I’m recuperating in Paradise Farm anyway, so it doesn’t affect my work.”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”I’m talking about those old Chinese doctors with white beards. Their bodies can’t take it. I’m so young. It’s not a problem for me to perform acupuncture on you once a day!” I’ll be in Australia for about a week this time, just in time to help you consolidate your Foundation! We’re on the same side, so don’t say those pretentious words!” “Alright then!” Liang Qichao nodded and didn’t say anything else, but his eyes were a little red.

“You should rest for a while!” Xia ruofei stood up and said,”it’s best not to get off the bed after the acupuncture. It’s best to sleep.” I’m going to the farm for a walk! I haven’t had a good look at our farm in a long time!”

“Boss, I’ll go with you!” Said Daphne hurriedly.

“No need! No need!” Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.”You stay with brother Liang! I’ll just walk around by myself. Oh right… Give me a car! Our farm is too big!”

“Alright!” Said Daphne.

She took out a car key and handed it to Xia ruofei.””This is the key to the pickup at the entrance. You can use it as you wish!”

“Thanks!” Xia ruofei took the key, waved at Liang Qichao, and walked out of the villa.

Daphne had given Xia ruofei a pickup truck, not because she was being rude to him, but because it was better for driving through. Besides the road from the entrance to the artificial lake, there were many places that ordinary cars could not drive through.

In fact, the most practical thing on the farm was the pickup truck. It had good passing performance and could also load goods. The farmers especially liked to use the pickup truck.

Moreover, the pickup that Daphne had given Xia ruofei was a domineering Ford Raptor. Although it was also a vehicle, it was still a toy for the rich in the country.

Xia ruofei could even drive a super giant like the Knight XV with ease. Driving a Ford Raptor was naturally a piece of cake for him.

He climbed into the car and started the engine. He left the lakeside villa and drove along the road to the deeper part of the farm.

Paradise Farm was considered a high – Quality farm in the entire Hunter Valley area. The terrain was relatively flat, and there was plenty of water and sunshine. The climate conditions were also quite good.

Under Liang Qichao and Daphne’s management, Paradise Farm had changed a lot. Rows of vegetable greenhouses were arranged neatly like soldiers, and they could not see the end of it from afar. It was a spectacular sight. Some areas were also planted with various fruit trees, which were also lush. Summer in Australia was the season when many fruits ripened, so the branches of fruit trees in many areas were full of fruit, making it a lively scene.

Xia ruofei drove a Ford Raptor pickup truck with melodious country music playing in the car. It was quite a pleasant feeling to drive through the bountiful farm.

He drove around the farm and also inspected the cold storage on the farm and Tang He’s horse farm.

There were indeed a lot of products in the cold storage warehouse. After all, they had lost a lot of channels during this period. However, with Tang Yitian’s full support, the stock in the cold storage warehouse was basically maintained at about 60% and didn’t continue to increase.

Xia ruofei saw that the workers were all busy and the cold storage warehouse was in and out in an orderly manner. He could not help but nod.

It could be seen that under Liang Qichao and Daphne’s care, Paradise Farm was indeed full of vitality.

When Xia ruofei drove back to the lakeside villa, the sun was already setting. The Golden rays of the setting sun shone on the sparkling lake. It was a peaceful and peaceful scene!

When she heard the sound of the car engine, she quickly came out to greet him.

“Boss! You’re back!” “Qi Chao wanted to call you and ask you to come back for dinner,” said Daphne with a smile.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I came back just in time for dinner!” Brother Liang, you didn’t sleep much this afternoon?”

“He fell asleep after you left. He slept for about an hour and just woke up not long ago.” Said Daphne. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

She welcomed Xia ruofei into the villa. Liang Qichao, who was sitting in a wheelchair, grinned at Xia ruofei and said,””Ruofei, 1 thought you had forgotten the time!”

“How could l!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”if you’re not enthusiastic about eating, you must have a problem with your thinking! Brother Liang, what have you prepared to entertain my guest from afar?”
