2322 Handling the captives (1)

Ge Jun had seen everything. He knew that it was a little too much to ask professor Chen to call Xia ruofei “uncle”. After all, Xia ruofei was only in her twenties, while professor Chen was already old. He was also an authority in the field of neurosurgery in the country and was one of the top figures in the medical world.

In addition, although professor Chen was also from a family of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners, he did not inherit his family’s medical skills. Instead, he turned to study Western medicine. In addition, the Chen family and the GE family were only friends for generations, and there was no real relationship between the two.

Hence, Ge Jun thought for a while and said with a smile,””Little Chen, let’s do as Junior Brother Xia said! There aren’t so many rules in modern society. ”

In fact, this was because professor Chen was not the descendant of the GE family. Otherwise, no matter how old and qualified professor Chen was, Ge Jun would not allow the seniority to be messed up.

Professor Chen was relieved and said,””Alright! Alright!”

Although he did not have to call Xia ruofei “uncle”, Xia ruofei had become Ge Jun’s junior. In professor Chen’s heart, Xia ruofei’s importance was naturally different from before.

After this small interlude, Ge Jun then said to Fang Liyun with a pleasant expression,””Madam song, I’m just here to observe and learn. With junior Xia around, Secretary song will definitely recover. You don’t have to worry about this. ”

Fang Liyun could not help but be stunned, thinking that this Chinese medical master’s attitude was too humble! Although she knew that Xia ruofei’s medical skills were amazing, Ge Jun was a leading figure in the Chinese medicine world! Even he had to learn from Xia ruofei?

Fang Liyun thought that Ge Jun was being humble. Of course, professor Chen had the same thought.

They did not know that Ge Jun was speaking from the bottom of his heart.

Ge Jun had personally checked on song Qiming’s condition. He had also heard from professor Chen about song Qiming’s condition when he was admitted to the hospital. He knew that even he would not be able to do anything when he was in such a critical condition. However, Xia ruofei had successfully stabilized his condition. Moreover, song Qiming’s life force was getting stronger and stronger. He knew that Xia ruofei’s medical skills were better than his.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Senior, you’re too humble. In terms of comprehensive medical skills, I can’t compare to you. I only have a little experience in external injuries.”

Then, Xia ruofei said to Fang Liyun,””Auntie Fang, I’ve already prepared another treatment plan, but there’s one medicine that will only be available in two days. Uncle song’s condition is very stable at the moment, so we’ll observe his condition for the next two days. I’ll try a new treatment plan in two or three days. I believe he’ll wake up very soon.”

Professor Chen was dumbfounded. In his opinion, song Qiming was relying on the expensive equipment in the ICU to maintain his vital signs. Even his primary reflex had disappeared, which meant that he had completely lost his brain function. How could he be in a stable condition?

However, even Ge Jun did not agree with his conclusion. Moreover, Xia ruofei was still his junior uncle, so professor Chen naturally did not dare to refute him.

Since the head of the hospital had already given the word regarding song Qiming’s treatment, the people from the hospital did not have much say in it. Therefore, professor Chen decided to keep quiet.

Fang Liyun immediately replied,””Alright, you can make the decisions regarding the treatment!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”aunty, Song Wei, let’s do this for now!” I won’t be keeping an eye on this place for the next two days. You guys should take a rest. Uncle song is in the intensive care unit, and there’s someone taking care of him 24 hours a day. My phone is always on, so if anything happens, I’ll be able to rush back immediately. ”

Fang Liyun nodded and said,”yeah!” Ruofei, you’ve worked hard these past two days! Go home and have a good rest for two days!”

Although Song Wei did not say anything, the way she looked at Xia ruofei was filled with gentleness. It explained everything.

……

Ge Jun accompanied Xia ruofei as they walked out of the hospital.

“Senior GE, when do you plan to return to the capital?” Xia ruofei asked.

Ge Jun chuckled.”I’ve been out for a few days now. Let’s see how it goes after you treat Secretary song. If there’s nothing else, I’ll return to the capital around then!”

Xia ruofei nodded.”After I’m done with uncle song’s matter, I’ll find some time to sort out the contents of <three cloud rubbing scrolls>. Then, I’ll have a good exchange with you, senior.”

“There’s no rush for this, there’s no rush for this,”Ge Jun quickly said.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”since I’ve accepted you as my disciple on my master’s behalf, I naturally have to bear the corresponding responsibility.” Senior brother GE, the ‘three volumes of cloud contact’ originally came from the GE family, so it’s considered a complete piece returned to Zhao. I believe that the heritage of old ancestor Ge Hong’s Chinese medicine will definitely be carried forward in your hands. ”

Ge Jun was slightly moved and said,””Thank you! Junior Xia!”

As Ge Jun had a tea date with his friends, the two of them bade each other farewell in front of the hospital building. Xia ruofei drove the Knight XV back to the jiangbin villa district.

When he got home, he went straight to his bedroom. After locking the doors and windows, he took out the spirit map scroll and entered the medium.
