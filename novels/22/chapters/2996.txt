2997 The key person_

As soon as this price appeared, many cultivators were slightly shocked, and some people finally heaved a sigh of relief.

This time, Xia ruofei and the star Seizer sect were in the limelight. Almost everyone knew who they were. Furthermore, the cultivators all knew that the star Seizer sect had earned no less than 100000 spiritual stones from the auction. Hence, they were all waiting to see if they would fight for the five sages medallion.

However, Xia ruofei did not make a move, so everyone’s attention gradually shifted to the competition between the other top sects.

In room 15, it was Wu Ming’s first time seeing Xia ruofei bid with a happy expression. He said,””He really can’t hold back! Uncle Feng, I was right, wasn’t I?”

“Young sect leader, let’s just wait for the final result!” Luo Feng said, not knowing whether to laugh or cry. I’m afraid that a hundred thousand spirit stones won’t be enough to bid for this five Saints badge. ”

“That’s already a very high price!” Wu Ming said,”moreover, the one surnamed Xia added 5000 spirit stones in one go. It can be seen that his desire to buy it is very strong. Perhaps the other sects will back out after knowing the difficulty.”

Under normal circumstances, Wu Ming would wish that Xia ruofei could spend as many spirit stones as possible. He would be happy if someone kept bidding against Xia ruofei so that he would have to spend more spirit stones.

However, now that Wu Ming had the idea of using underhanded means, he naturally hoped that Xia ruofei would be able to win the five sacred badges.

After all, if it was bought by the other top sects, it would be impossible for the spirit Vulture mountain to double – Cross them with their strength. They could only hope that Xia ruofei would put in more effort. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Seeing this, Luo Feng forced a smile inwardly. He didn’t say anything to tease Wu Ming. He felt that Wu Ming’s mentality was already very extreme. He was about to go crazy.

As for the cultivators from the other top sects who were still fighting for the five – Saint token, their expressions only changed slightly when they saw Xia ruofei’s bid, but they quickly returned to normal.

In their eyes, a bidding war was a bidding war, and it had nothing to do with the identity of the bidder.

It was nothing more than the one with the highest price getting it. As long as they got it, no one would dare to have any crooked ideas.

Xia ruofei’s bid did not last long.

Everyone was only slightly stunned for a moment. After some consideration, they naturally made their bids.

It was just that Xia ruofei had added 5000 spiritual stones in one go, and the total price had exceeded 100000 spiritual stones, so some cultivators took a little longer to consider.

Just like that, the price was maintained for less than half a minute before a new price appeared.

101000 spirit stones, bidder: In Room 1.

After the first heaven society’s Chen Xuan made his bid, he laughed and said,””I didn’t think that fellow Daoist Xia would be interested in the five Saints badge as well!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”I can’t help but yearn for the Legend of the Five – Saint token. If there’s a chance, it’s not a bad idea to buy it and study it!”

“That makes sense!” Chen Xuan laughed. The five – Saint token was still worth studying! Fellow Daoist Xia, regardless of whether your wish is fulfilled or not today, if you want to study the five Saints badge, you can come to the first heaven society. We still have another five Saints badge in our sect, and we can lend it to fellow Daoist Xia for you to study!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”then I’ll thank fellow Daoist Chen first!”

The cultivators were envious when they heard this. Chen Xuan was obviously trying to convey a message of goodwill to the star Seizer sect, or to be more precise, to Xia ruofei!

The first heaven society had already become the number one sect in Huaxia’s cultivation world. Chen Nanfeng was also the number one cultivator in name. The reason why the Suan ni was only in name was that some cultivators had hidden themselves from the world. With the addition of the legendary nascent soul old monster, Chen Nanfeng was definitely not invincible.

Chen Xuan was only in his forties, but he was already an Aurous core stage cultivator. He was one of the most outstanding cultivators of his generation.

The first heaven society and Chen Xuan were like the sun in the sky. Who in the cultivation world wouldn’t want to be on good terms with them?

For example, Wu Ming in room 15 was filled with jealousy and hatred. His face was twisted with anger.

In his opinion, the reason why Chen Xuan treated Xia ruofei differently was because Xia ruofei had bought the mysterious ore from the first heaven society at a high price.

Wu Ming felt that he should have been the one to enjoy such treatment. After all, he was the one who made the first bid, and Xia ruofei had jumped out to compete for it, snatching food from the Tiger’s mouth.

Wu Ming was also secretly complaining about Luo Feng. If Luo Feng hadn’t persuaded him not to fight over personal feelings and said that he had already gained enough face by extorting so many spirit stones from the star Seizer sect, Wu Ming would definitely not have given up so easily.

Wu Ming had also listened to Luo Feng’s suggestion. His words hinted that the star Seizer sect had already understood the use of the mysterious ore and hoped to cause trouble for the star Seizer sect and Xia ruofei.

But now, it seemed that this trouble didn’t exist at all. Moreover, Chen Xuan from the first heaven society seemed to admire Xia ruofei.

Wu Ming looked at Luo Feng with dissatisfaction and said,””Uncle Feng, if I had known, I would have fought to the end! Anyway, it’s useless to leave these spirit stones behind. The first heaven society’s favor is worth a lot!”

Luo Feng smiled bitterly and thought,”The remaining spirit stones were all your fault! If he ignored the star Seizer sect’s bet, the transcript of the glittering jewel true understanding could be sold for a few spirit stones. Most importantly, he would not have to pay the 50000 spirit stones. If that was the case, the spirit Vulture mountain still had the power to compete for it!

However, Luo Feng naturally wouldn’t say it out loud. He only said,””Young sect leader, what you said might be one of the reasons. However, what Chen Xuan values more is that brat surnamed Xia’s ability to refine medicine! Qi gathering pill, fire cloud pill ... Who didn’t lack supplementary medicine these days? The first heaven society is a big sect, but they also have to feed a lot of cultivators!”
