2279 The car has arrived_Not long after Xia ruofei left the origin space, he received a call from Li Zhe. He was informed that the Elfa MPV he had ordered had arrived in the capital.

Xia ruofei was very surprised. Li Zhe had said that the goods would arrive in three to five days, but it had been brought forward.

“Xiao si, where’s the car? I’ll bring someone over to bring it now!” Xia ruofei asked.

Li Zhe laughed and said,”brother Xia, you don’t have to worry about this!” I picked up a car from the Jing Jin port this morning and am on my way back. I’m sure the car will reach your house before noon!”

“Yo! This is so embarrassing! “And you’re asking for delivery ...” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you can tell us the location. We’ll go and get the car ourselves!”

“Hey! You don’t have to be so polite with me!” Li Zhe laughed and said,”it’s just a few steps away. How could I trouble you to run around? It’s decided!”

“Alright then!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ll be waiting for you at home!”

“Alright! I’ll see you later!” Li Zhe said with a smile.

After Xia ruofei hung up the phone, he thought that he had nothing to do, so he went to the courtyard to make tea and enjoy his leisure time.

After two drinks, Xia ruofei suddenly remembered that Li Zhe had been running around personally for this car and even delivered it to his door today. He should at least express his gratitude.

Although it was impossible for him to agree to let Li Zhe invest in the Paradise Association just because of such a small matter, he still needed to prepare a small gift to express his sincerity.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and felt that this peach blossom Da Hong Pao would be a good gift.

Hence, he returned to his room and took out a box of tea leaves from the interspace. He asked Xia ruofei to put many company – customized packaging for tea leaves in the interspace. He even specially wrapped some tea leaves and put them in the packaging so that they could be given to others as gifts at any time.

Of course, the Da Hong Pao tea leaves in these gift boxes weren’t packed in small packages. They were packed in sealed clay jars, and each box contained two jars of tea leaves, each weighing about half a catty. As a result, it was convenient to pack the tea leaves in the space, and there was no need for sealing devices.

Xia ruofei casually placed the tea leaves on the stone table in the courtyard and sat down to continue drinking.

At around 11 am, Wu Qiming, a veteran who was in charge of guarding the front yard, reported to Xia ruofei through the internal communication system that someone with the surname Li was looking for him.

Xia ruofei knew that Li Zhe had arrived. He immediately told Wu Qiming to let him in. At the same time, he picked up the tea bag and walked towards the front yard.

Xia ruofei had just passed through the moon gate when he saw a black business car parked in the courtyard. He could not help but speed up.

Li Zhe was standing beside the car. When he saw Xia ruofei, he quickly walked up to him and greeted him.””Brother Xia, you’re here!”

Xia ruofei chuckled and nodded.””Xiao si, you’ve had a hard journey!”

After saying that, he handed the tea leaves in his hand to Li Zhe and said,””This is for you, a small token of my appreciation!”

Li Zhe was flattered and took the tea leaves with both hands. He said in surprise,””Thank you, brother Xia! Your good tea is famous far and wide, I’m really in luck today!”

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile and walked towards the Toyota Elfa.

The two veterans, Wu Qiming and Zheng Zhigang, were also standing next to the car. Qin Yanan, who was working in the house, also came out. They were all attracted by the car’s appearance.

“Brother Xia, it’s the top black Edition!” Li Zhe laughed and said,”original imported goods! Please take a look and see if you’re satisfied?”

Xia ruofei looked around the car and found that the appearance of the MPV was indeed very eye – catching. No wonder it was popular on the internet in the country.

This was this year’s top model. The logo was not a traditional Toyota logo, but a limited – edition shield. The front face with a large air intake grid was quite eye – catching, and the slender headlights on both sides had sharp lines, giving off a very domineering feeling.

The Elfa was designed to be very slender on the side of the car, and the waistline went from the front to the tail light. The body of the car gave a very smooth and dynamic feeling. With the black paint, it was like Batman.

Turning to the back, Xia ruofei realized that the tail light design of this car was also very full and prominent. The red tail light was jagged on both sides. With the high brake light, the entire tail light was very recognizable.

The most prominent part was the four exhaust pipes at the back. The symmetrical design made the whole vehicle look very athletic.

Xia ruofei was very satisfied with the car’s appearance.

This model was very popular in the country. Li Zhe had already sold dozens of them, so he had a good understanding of this model. After Xia ruofei looked at the exterior, he attentively introduced some of the features of this model to Xia ruofei.

“Brother Xia, the Elfa is definitely the best in terms of comfort among its peers.” Li Zhe said as he pressed the handle of the side door, and the electric side door slowly opened. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Li Zhe continued,”look, brother Xia. This car uses ergonomic luxury aviation seats with electric lifting pillows. Our car also has a custom – made floor made of rare dragon blood sandalwood with the rare cherry blossom element. The partition glass in the middle can be turned into mist with a click, creating an exclusive private space for the back row ...”

Li Zhe went on and on, and Xia ruofei was also interested in trying out the functions one by one, nodding in satisfaction from time to time.
