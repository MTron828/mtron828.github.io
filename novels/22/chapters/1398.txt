Chapter 1399: The heart – nourishing soup launch (1)

Translator: 549690339

In the end, Liang Weimin let Liang Qichao go.

It was not that he believed Xia ruofei’s explanation, but he was shocked by the results that Paradise Farm had submitted.

In less than a day, sales exceeded 60 million Australian dollars, and the average sales in all of Australia exceeded one ton. This was an amazing result!

Liang Weimin had no doubt that his son had fought a beautiful battle this time, and his importance in Tang He’s grandfather’s heart would undoubtedly increase by a large margin. It could be said that he was ahead of all his competitors.

In comparison, Liang Qichao flirting with foreign girls was a small matter. He just had to knock some sense into them. There was no need to take it too seriously.

Liang Weimin was more traditional, but traditional men had a deep – rooted notion that men should put their career first and that success in their career was more important than anything else. Liang Qichao’s performance obviously made Liang Weimin satisfied.

After lunch, Liang Weimin left in a hurry.

In fact, after Liang Qichao finished his call, Liang Weimin was a little distracted while eating. Even the delicious Chinese perch only managed to distract him for a while before he started to daydream again.

On one hand, he was thinking about how Liang Qichao’s future would develop. On the other hand, he could not wait to share the good news with his wife.

After Xia ruofei left the Ling’s private restaurant, he did not return to the farm directly. Instead, he gave ye Lingyun a call and asked him to send the company’s small trucks to the warehouse in the city to meet the needs of business development. The company had already purchased a few small trucks.

Then, Xia ruofei drove to the warehouse and took out the iron – Skin Dendrobium strip and Da Hong Pao tea leaves that Xia Qing had prepared in advance. When the small truck arrived, he transported all these things back to the farm and handed them to ye Lingyun and the others to make iron – Skin maple and Peach Garden Da Hong Pao tea leaves.

The small truck started and returned to the farm. Xia ruofei also drove back. However, he only stayed in the villa for a short while before carrying a box of fish fry to the breeding workshop.

The rays in the spirit map space were all free – range, and they usually lived in the sea of the space. When it was breeding season, they would rise up to the river and lay eggs in the space.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei had strong control over the entire space and his mental energy was strong too. Hence, even though the sea was vast, Xia ruofei could still easily use the invisible spatial force to gather the clam fish.

Jiang Hua was already used to Xia ruofei sending new baby clam fish over every once in a while, so he skillfully arranged for people to take over these precious baby clam fish.

Xia ruofei also asked about the situation of the Chinese perch. As the business partner had not been confirmed yet, there was not much sales of the Chinese perch other than the daily supply of the lingji private kitchen.

Of course, since they didn’t need to be transported far away, they didn’t freeze the Pomfret in a cold storage. The Pomfret that hadn’t been sold for the time being could be kept. Although there wouldn’t be any more pomfrets after they grew to this extent, the cost of raising them wouldn’t increase much.

In any case, the taste of fresh pomfrets was definitely better than those that had been frozen and unfrozen. All the hype and articles on the internet were just for sales. If there was no need to, there was no need to freeze the fish.

Xia ruofei took a look at the pomfrets cultivation workshop and praised Jiang Hua for his work. He encouraged him to keep up the good work because the sales of the pomfrets would be on the right track soon. After confirming the channel partner, the task here would be even heavier.

......

The next day, after Xia ruofei had breakfast in the staff canteen, he left the farm with Feng Jing and drove to the Sanshan conference hall in the city.

Other than Xia ruofei and Feng Jing, the Paradise Corporation also sent a business car. Pang Hao, Xiao Qiang, and other company leaders also went to show their support.

Now, paradise pharmaceutical factory was a celebrity team in paradise corporation’s system. Not only did it generate a lot of revenue, but it was also quite famous.

The heart – nourishing soup was the first Chinese medicine launched by the Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory. The company’s internal staff also knew that this medicine had epoch – making significance for the treatment of autism. The release of this medicine on the market was a great thing with boundless merit.

Therefore, as long as they were not too busy with work and couldn’t leave, everyone had to be there. Not to mention that the chairman and the General Manager were both present, so they had to go and support them.

Even Cao tieshu, who spent all day in the large shed, changed into a new suit that his wife had specially bought for him from the mall and followed them to join in the fun. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Now, Cao tieshu was also the pillar of the Tao Yuan company. Both husband and wife were working in the company, and their salaries had also increased several times, making the villagers extremely envious.

The director of Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory, Xue Jinshan, had arrived at the Sanshan conference hall early in the morning.

He was both excited and nervous. Ever since he joined the Paradise Corporation, he had been looking forward to the day the heart – nourishing soup would be released on the market.

As a top student with a professional background, Xue Jinshan had been questioned by many when he chose paradise Corporation, a complete layman in the pharmaceutical industry.

Whether it was his classmates or his family, they all thought that his decision was not considered and was very unwise.

But Xue Jinshan was already completely entranced by the heart nourishing soup.

Back then, it was only a small – scale experiment, but Xue Jinshan could not help but feel overwhelmed.

The process of releasing a new drug into the market was very cumbersome and difficult. Even Chinese patent medicines had to go through various difficulties, whether it was animal testing, clinical stage one, clinical stage two ... Any one of them could get stuck, and all the previous work would be for nothing.

Xue Jinshan could be said to have witnessed the heart – nourishing soup being listed on the market and listed as a guiding drug in such a short time.

Xue Jinshan wasn’t as excited as he was today, even when the jaded skin cream was selling like hotcakes.

After all, he had a professional background. No matter how well the jaded skin cream sold, it was just a skin care product. The heart nourishing soup was the best medicine that was truly beneficial to the country and the people.

Such a good medicine that was destined to become a phenomenal product was personally led by him. The sense of accomplishment was incomparable.

“President Xia, President Feng!” When Xue Jinshan saw Xia ruofei and the others, he quickly went up to them.

“Kanayama, you’ve worked hard!” Xia ruofei laughed and continued to ask,”is everything arranged?”

“No problem! We’ve rehearsed the entire process several times. ” Xue Jinshan said confidently,”the media reporters are also here. There are quite a number of them!”

Nowadays, Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory was definitely a star enterprise in Sanshan city. The jaded skin cream was well – known both domestically and overseas, and every rush to buy it would cause a craze. Therefore, the invitation sent by Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory was still very interesting to the media reporters.

Moreover, there were also some well – informed media outlets that had already grasped a certain amount of information during the trial stage of the heart nourishing soup. They were also very interested in this special medicine that filled in the gaps and had sent out their elite troops.

Xia ruofei looked at the reporters who were signing in not far away. He smiled and nodded.”Then it’s up to you later! We’re here today to cheer you on. You have to rely on yourself to set up the stage and perform!”

“President Xia, are you really not going to say a few words?” Xue Jinshan could not help but ask.

He knew very well that the recipe of the heart – nourishing soup came from Xia ruofei. He had also participated in the entire process of the factory production. Even now, the key steps of the heart – nourishing soup were still in his hands.

It could be said that the heart – nourishing soup was created by Xia ruofei. Now that he was famous, Xia ruofei was actually so low – Key. He even personally rejected the contents of Xue Jinshan’s PowerPoint presentation about his invention of the heart – nourishing soup, which made Xue Jinshan a little confused.

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand,”what do I have to say?” You’re the one who’s been following up on the heart – nourishing soup project the entire time, so you know everything like the back of your hand. The reporters will definitely not be interested in how handsome I am as the boss ...”

Xia ruofei’s joke made everyone laugh. Xue Jinshan could only force a smile and say,”Okay then ... Director Xia, director Feng, leaders, please come in!”

With that, Xue Jinshan personally led Xia ruofei and the others into the hall that had been set up.

Xia ruofei and Feng Jing’s seats were naturally in the middle of the front row, and the middle management of paradise Corporation were also arranged to be in the front row.

Xia ruofei looked around the venue and saw that it was well – arranged. Other than some necessary posters, there were also a few banners placed at the entrance and around the venue.

This was also Xia ruofei’s request. The Yangxin soup and the jadi ointment were in different positions. Yangxin soup was a kind of charity, at least in China. The price of Yangxin soup was far more suitable for its unique effect in the treatment of autism. Hence, Xia ruofei’s request for the press conference was to be beautiful and Grand, but not wasteful, not gimmicky, and not to invite young and fresh meat to the stage.

Many reporters had already arrived at the media area, and everyone was looking at the brochure and draft that they had received at the signing Time with great interest.

Some reporters also noticed that Xia ruofei, Feng Jing, and the others were more famous than Xia ruofei on the internet. Feng Jing also had a group of die – hard fans. Her fans affectionately called her “beautiful President”, while her fans called themselves “Jingdian.” She even set up a fan base on Baidu Tieba, so the reporters who often ran entertainment news naturally knew Feng Jing.

Although the VIP area and the media area were separated, the reporters were definitely not people who followed the rules. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be able to get any news.

Hence, a few of the reporters went over the invisible isolation belt and came to Xia ruofei and Feng Jing.

“Boss Feng, is there any strategic consideration for your company to launch this new drug?”

“President Xia, Taoyuan company started with the sales of agricultural products, but now it has suddenly stepped into the professional pharmaceutical industry. What do you think?”

“CEO Feng, I’m a reporter from daily Japanese entertainment. Say a few words to your fans!”

Xia ruofei and Feng Jing looked at each other. They didn’t expect to become the focus of the media even though they were just here to be an audience. They were really caught off guard ...

Just as Xia ruofei was considering whether to remain silent and not steal Xue Jinshan’s limelight, or to say a few words to dismiss the reporters, there was a small commotion in the media stands ...
