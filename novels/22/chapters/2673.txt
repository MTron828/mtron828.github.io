“En!” Xia ruofei nodded and looked at his watch.”We’ll be leaving for the airport in an hour. You can go and arrange things for bainilatti!”

“Yes, Mr. Xia!” Liu Qingfeng respectfully replied.

Xia ruofei returned to the luxurious suite that Liu Qingfeng had prepared for him. He did not rest, but sat cross – legged on the bed again and began to condense the child seal of the soul seal. Ever since he knew that the star Seizer sect had set their eyes on the peach source Island, Xia ruofei had a sense of urgency that time waited for no one. Seeing that he still had a little time, he decided to condense another child seal.

The child seal of a soul seal could be condensed in advance and stored in the sea of consciousness.

The seed seal was like an empty disc. There was no content in it, and it would automatically revolve around the mother seal in the sea of consciousness.

Xia ruofei was just being prepared. He had prepared the child seal in his sea of consciousness so that he would not have to spend time to condense it when he needed to use it.

Xia ruofei was getting more and more skilled at condensing the child seal. In an hour, he had successfully condensed two child seals and stored them in his sea of consciousness.

Then, he looked at the time, stood up, and walked out of the room.

Liu Qingfeng had already been waiting in the corridor of this floor in advance. When he saw Xia ruofei come out, he quickly greeted him and said,””Mr. Xia, the car is ready. We can leave at any time.”

“Let’s go!”Xia ruofei nodded.

After he finished speaking, he strode towards the elevator, and Liu Qingfeng followed Xia ruofei step by step.

Xia ruofei said as he walked,”make sure to keep it a secret. Whether it’s the benilatti incident or the plane coming over tonight, I don’t want it to spread to the whole world tomorrow.”

“Yes!” Liu Qingfeng quickly responded,”I’ve already given the order to keep quiet. They know the severity of the situation!”

Xia ruofei nodded and walked into the elevator without another word.

After a while, a Mercedes – Benz car drove out of the underground parking lot of the building and sped in the direction of the airport.

Peach Blossom Island Airport.

The Mercedes – Benz drove directly to the tarmac.

This was the advantage of a private airport. If a car wanted to enter the tarmac at an International Airport, it would need to go through very cumbersome procedures, and there would be many inspections and security checks, which were quite troublesome. However, there was no need for all these in peach source Island. The car could drive in directly.

“Mr. Xia, the tower Station announced that the plane will land in about 20 minutes,” said Liu Qingfeng. You can rest in the car for a while!”

“Alright,” he said. Xia ruofei replied indifferently.

He leaned back in his seat and closed his eyes to rest. Suddenly, he asked,””Is the warehouse and the transport vehicle ready?”

“Everything has been arranged according to your instructions. Once the plane lands, the transport trucks will come over.” Liu Qingfeng said,”the warehouse here at the airport was almost empty. Only a small part of the building materials were stored. I have already arranged for some workers to come over and clear the warehouse.”

“Very good,” he said. Xia ruofei said indifferently. Then, he didn’t say anything more. He leaned back in his seat as if he had fallen asleep.

After 17 to 18 minutes, they could faintly hear the sound of an aircraft’s engine in the distance.

Liu Qingfeng sat in the co-pilot’s seat. Through the side window, he could see a plane in the distant night sky approaching from afar, the red lights on the wing tips flashing rhythmically.

He turned around and said,”Mr. Xia, the plane has arrived. I’ll go down and take a look.”

“Let’s go together!”Xia ruofei opened his eyes and said.

The plane landed smoothly on the runway in no time. The guide car set off and met up with the plane at the runway. Then, the car led the plane slowly to Xia ruofei’s side.

This was a Boeing 757 cargo charter flight. After the plane was parked in the parking space, the ladder car that had been prepared on the side immediately approached. Two trucks that Liu Qingfeng had arranged in advance from the construction site also drove over.

Soon, the cabin door opened. Li Yifu was the first one to appear at the cabin door. He quickly walked down the ramp. When he was taxiing the plane, he already saw Xia ruofei waiting on the tarmac. He was both excited and nervous. He was excited because he finally saw his senior granduncle again, but he was nervous because he had actually asked his senior granduncle to wait on the tarmac. It was too outrageous.

Li Yifu also noticed Liu Qingfeng beside Xia ruofei, so when he came to Xia ruofei’s side, he could only suppress his excitement and call out,”Mr. Xia.”

This was what Xia ruofei had told Li Yifu a long time ago. He was not allowed to call him ‘senior granduncle’ in front of outsiders.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,””You’ve had a hard journey! Let’s organize the unloading first!”

“Alright!” Li Yifu replied.

The cargo door in the middle of the plane slowly opened, revealing the cargo inside. These cargo were all packed in sealed cargo boxes, neatly stacked in the cargo hold.

Soon, the cargo containers were transferred to the trucks by the workers. The trucks and Xia ruofei’s Mercedes – Benz drove into the night and headed to the warehouse on the other side of the airport. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Li Yifu personally escorted the first truck. After the truck arrived at the warehouse, Li Yifu personally watched the workers move the heavy cargo boxes into the warehouse.

This was Li Yifu’s first time seeing Xia ruofei give him a task so seriously, so he didn’t dare to relax for a moment. He had to personally watch over every step to be at ease.
