Sanshan airport.

In front of a slightly lower building next to the main building of the terminal building, Xia ruofei and the rest got off the car. Lei Hu, who was the driver today, was busy taking everyone’s luggage from the trunk, while Xia ruofei was briefing Xue Jinshan, who was left behind.

“Keep a close eye on the pharmaceutical factory project!” Xia ruofei said,”we won’t be in Hong Kong for long. These few days, we will focus on land acquisition. We have to keep in close contact with Changping County. If necessary, urge them! You can contact County Head Wu directly. She will spare no effort to solve the problem for us. While she is still in Changping, we should quickly settle the land acquisition!”

The scope of the land that Tao Yuan company needed had already been clearly stated by the company. Thus, Xue Jinshan only needed to cooperate with Changping County for surveying and mapping in the early stage, and then urge them to complete the land acquisition as soon as possible. The work was not complicated.

“Don’t worry, Chairman!”Xue Jinshan nodded. This was the most important matter right now! I’ve handed over the daily production work to the Deputy Director!”

“We can’t relax on safety production either!” Xia ruofei said,”especially when we’re giving birth to products that are either to be applied on the face or to be drunk. We can’t have any safety issues. Otherwise, the reputation that we’ve built up with so much effort will be destroyed!”

“I understand! I’ll supervise and check!” Xue Jinshan said.

Xia ruofei patted Xue Jinshan’s shoulder and said,”Thank you for your hard work these few days! When the pharmaceutical factory project is over, I’ll give you a few days off, and you can go on a vacation. The company will pay for it as compensation for not being able to go to Hong Kong this time!”

“Then I’ll thank the chairman first!” Xue Jinshan chuckled,”Chairman, you guys go in quickly! Don’t miss the flight!”

“It’s fine!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Kanayama, we’re leaving!”

“Have a safe journey!”

Xia ruofei brought Feng Jing, Dong Yun, and pang Hao into the building with their luggage.

“Chairman, how are we going to enter from here? Isn’t the departure hall in the building in front?” Pang Hao could not help but ask.

He had wanted to ask for a long time, but he never had the chance. Xia ruofei had been telling Xue Jinshan about work.

Feng Rao smiled and explained on Xia ruofei’s behalf,””Director pang, this is the private passageway for public business plane passengers!”

“Tsk, tsk!” Pang Hao said. I almost forgot, we’re taking a public service plane this time! Chairman, isn’t it expensive to rent a plane? You’ve really put in a lot of effort!”

“If I say I won’t spend a single cent, would you believe me?” Xia ruofei smiled faintly.

Feng Jing and the others shook their heads in unison. How could there be a free lunch in this world? The rental of a plane was easily hundreds of thousands of Yuan per take – off and landing. Which company would be so generous as to directly waive the fee? Xia ruofei was not their father!

Indeed, Xia ruofei was not Li Yifu’s father, but he was his senior granduncle ...

Xia ruofei smiled but did not explain. He led Feng Jing and the rest through the security check.

They were taking the Gulfstream G650 to Hong Kong today. The flight crew had already reported the passenger list and information to the airport in advance. The security check of private planes was far less strict than that of ordinary commercial planes. Basically, as long as they did not carry dangerous items such as guns and bombs, they could pass through the security check smoothly.

On the other side of the security passage, a flight attendant in uniform had been waiting for a long time. Yingying was a member of the G650 flight crew. She was more than enough to be a chief flight attendant in an ordinary airline.

Of course, the salary of the purser of other airline companies was far less than that of an ordinary flight attendant in the G650 crew. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The flight attendant came up to him with a generous smile on her face and said,””Mr. Xia, distinguished guests, the plane is ready! This way, please!”
