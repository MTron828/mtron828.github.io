2629 It’s really God’s arrangement_1

In addition to the quick – moving staff, there were also some reporters with long guns and short cannons standing in an area surrounded by the security zone. There was even a girl with flowers.

Xia ruofei, who was about to get off the plane, was stunned by the crowd. There was a red carpet, fresh flowers, and even the media was present. Could it be that there were important guests on the Australian Airlines plane today? But if it was a VIP, it shouldn’t have stopped at this ordinary plane ...

By then, the space – time travel machine had already opened the cabin door and lowered the accommodation ladder. Xia ruofei walked towards the cabin door with a trace of doubt.

As soon as he stepped down from the ramp of the peach Garden, he heard someone calling his name excitedly.

As it was too noisy, Xia ruofei could not hear it clearly. Just as he turned his head to look for the source of the sound, the window on the captain’s side of the qplease airlines A350’s cockpit opened ...

A person stretched out his upper body with great effort, then waved at Xia ruofei excitedly, shouting his name loudly.

Xia ruofei took a closer look and could not help but reveal a surprised look. The pilot of this flight was actually Captain Brook, who had gone through thick and thin with him.

The flight that Xia ruofei had taken had two captains. The two captains and the co – Pilot were on the same flight. During the incident, the co – Pilot, Wilkinson, had killed the captain of the flight, Johannson. After Xia ruofei broke the cabin door, Captain Brook was the first to rush into the cockpit, and Xia ruofei followed closely.

At that time, Wilkins had used the most extreme method to continuously shoot the windshield with the steel ball gun, causing the windshield on the passenger side to completely shatter. Wilkins had also been sucked out of the cockpit by the powerful air pressure and died without a burial.

Captain Brook rushed into the cockpit first and was also the first to bear the brunt. Not only was one of his arms injured by the rebounded steel ball, but he was also sucked into the seat when the cockpit lost pressure. His other arm was also fractured.

At that time, Brook was the only pilot on the plane, but both his hands were injured. Because of this, Xia ruofei had no choice but to take the pilot’s seat.

Thanks to Xia ruofei’s strong psychological quality and learning ability, under the technical guidance of Captain Brook, the plane finally landed safely in Saipan.

Xia ruofei did not expect such a coincidence today. Paradise, which he was on, and ruofei, which was piloted by Captain Brook, landed one after the other. They were even assigned to the adjacent parking spaces.

It could be said that Xia ruofei and Captain Brook had experienced life and death together. If it were not for their seamless cooperation, the passengers on that plane would have been buried in the sea. Therefore, this kind of life and death experience could easily close the distance between people.

Seeing Captain Brook again, Xia ruofei was naturally very happy. He stood beside paradise and waved at Captain Brook.

“Xia, don’t go yet. Wait for me downstairs!” Brook shouted.

Xia ruofei was not in a hurry for this trip to Australia. Since he had met Captain Brook, the two of them definitely wanted to catch up. Hence, he nodded and gave Captain Brook an ‘OK’ sign.

The rest of the people on the peach source had also alighted from the plane. Captain Liu An came over and said,””Mr. Xia, the tower has changed its parking spot at the last minute. It’s probably because it saw two planes with similar and unique paint, so it made a last – minute decision. We’re quite far away from the public transport passage now. I’ve already called a shuttle bus from the cockpit, so you may have to wait for a while. ” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Xia ruofei laughed and waved his hand. “There’s no hurry. I met an acquaintance. I might have to stay here for a while.”

“Acquaintances?” Liu An was stunned.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. He pointed at the cockpit of the A350 and said,””Up there! I’ll introduce you to each other later. ”

Seeing that Xia ruofei was keeping him in suspense, Liu An did not continue to ask. He could only nod with a trace of doubt.””Alright ...”

The cabin door of the Qinba plane opened and the passengers began to disembark.

When they saw the red carpet laid at the end of the accommodation ladder, they could not help but be surprised and happy. They just did not know which great God had helped them.

The ground crew quickly guided the passengers to the entrance and exit passage. Xia ruofei and the others stood beside paradise and waited patiently for the captain of the Qinqin flight to be the last to leave the plane. The flight crew would only leave when all the passengers had alighted.

There were not many passengers on this flight, only about a hundred in total. Although everyone was curious about the red carpet and the media, they were very orderly and did not stay too long at the scene. They walked into the passage in an orderly manner.

Finally, all the passengers got off the plane, and the flight attendants also lined up to get off the plane, followed by the air traffic police and two other pilots. They stood on both sides of the accommodation ladder.

The media reporters at the scene also raised their cameras.

Xia ruofei lifted his head and looked at the door of the Airbus A350 curiously. It seemed that the main character today was Captain Brook! He was the only one who had not gotten off the plane.

As expected, a moment later, when Brook appeared at the cabin door, the crowd burst into a warm applause.
