“This can’t be done without the cooperation of Changping County,” Feng Jing said.”Especially in terms of land acquisition. Changping County has done a lot of work and cleared the obstacles for us.”

“Okay, I’ll call the county Leader later to express my gratitude!” Xia ruofei nodded.

Feng Jing continued,”also, we’ve completed the purchase of the vehicles that you’ve arranged for us. Now, our employees are using our own buses to and from work. The higher – ups in the company are also given special buses. At the same time, we’ve also hired ten drivers. They’ll be in charge of the logistics department.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”okay, you can arrange it.” I can already see our bus from the farm! Not bad, the quality of the Golden Dragon Bus on Heron Island was quite good! The key is that the design of the car is not bad. Our LOGO is big and eye – catching, and it will definitely be a beautiful scenery on the road!”

“It’s all about the economy of the eyes. We have to think of ways to increase our exposure!” Feng Jing smiled.

Then, she looked at Xia ruofei with a half – Smile and said,””Speaking of exposure, my Dear Chairman, how long has it been since you last updated your Weibo?”

Xia ruofei scratched his head and said,”I’m busy.” And I think our company’s operations staff will keep me updated!”

“Is that the same?” Feng Jing said unhappily,”the company’s operations staff can only send you some simple text at most. You can update it on your own. That’s more down – to – Earth. You’re going to take a private jet this time, can’t you get one? Wouldn’t it be nice to take a selfie on the streets of Italy?”

“Wouldn’t that be showing off your wealth?” Xia ruofei said.

“Do you still need to show off? Who doesn’t know that you have a super – profitable company?” Feng Jing rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,”you can be said to be the most popular person in the entertainment industry other than young master Wang. You’re such a good catch, yet you don’t make good use of it. I’m so angry!”

Xia ruofei quickly raised his hands and said with a bitter smile,””Alright, alright, alright. I’ll humbly accept your criticism. I’ll pay more attention in the future!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“This is more like it!” Feng Jing said. She then smiled and continued,”the reason I’m talking to you about increasing your exposure is because there’s a very important task that I’ll need your full cooperation with!”

Xia ruofei looked at Feng Rao suspiciously and said,””Sister che, why do I have a bad feeling? You’re not selling me, right?”

Feng Rao burst out laughing and said,””Who would dare to sell you! Don’t be so nervous ... You know about this! The one you personally agreed to was xiangnan TV’s life you yearn for. The TV station has already contacted us, hoping that you’d be able to participate in their first episode’s recording and give the show a good start!”

“This matter!” Xia ruofei said,”since you’ve agreed to it, you have to do it even if you have to bite the bullet!”

When Xia ruofei was in Beijing, he had heard from Zhao Yongjun and the others about this. He knew that the filming location at the club was already half – completed and xiangnan TV wanted to start filming as soon as possible.

Of course, it was not enough to just build the mushroom house. Some of the basic facilities of the club had to be built. Otherwise, the camera would be full of construction sites without any sense of beauty. Then it would not be the “life I yearn for” but the “life of carrying bricks.”

Feng Rao laughed and said,”so many celebrities want to go on this show but can ‘t!” And you still look so unwilling ...”

“Can I be the same as them?” Xia ruofei asked,”when does their show start recording?”

“The exact time hasn’t been decided yet, but it should be in a month’s time, no more than two months.” Feng Jing said,”xiangnan TV has also said that they will contact us again before they are ready. They will also consider your schedule!” Our Chairman is also very busy!”

Xia ruofei forced a smile and said,”you guys go and arrange this!” If there’s nothing particularly important that you can’t leave, then you can go to the shooting according to your arrangements!”

“Alright!” Feng Jing nodded.

Then, Feng Jing reported to Xia ruofei about the company’s recent situation, including everyone’s work after the relocation of the headquarters, the company’s financial situation, and so on. However, considering that Xia ruofei still had to call for a meeting with the other senior executives, Feng Jing only gave a brief report and waited for the senior executives in charge of the related work to report the specific situation.

Feng Jing stayed in Xia ruofei’s office for about an hour before she smiled and closed the file.””That’s about it. Let the directors Report the details to you!”

Xia ruofei nodded.”Okay. Tell Yao Xin to inform the director – Level executives at home. Tell them to come to my office for a meeting in ten minutes.”

Xia ruofei’s office not only had a reception hall, a meeting room, and a bedroom, but it also had a gym and a chess room. Hence, small meetings could be held here.

Although the meeting room was said to be in Xia ruofei’s office, there was actually a door that led directly to the meeting room from the elevator exit. This design was also carefully thought out. When the chairman of Qianqian called for a meeting, they couldn’t just walk through the chairman’s office and show off, right? This wasn’t a wet market.

When Xia ruofei entered the meeting room, the company’s higher – ups were already there. When they saw Xia ruofei, they all stood up and greeted him.

Xia ruofei also smiled and greeted everyone. He did not put on any airs.

He sat in the middle of the conference room and said,””I’ve been busy these days and wasn’t in the company. Everyone has worked hard! I might have to go out in a while, so I’ll make it short. Everyone can talk about the work in their respective areas. If there’s a long story, then it’ll be short if there’s no story!”

President Feng Jing, Administrative Director Dong Yun, Marketing Director Xiao Qiang, Financial Director pang Hao, Security Director Lei Hu, and the newly established Logistics Director tan Ming were present. The pharmaceutical factory director Xue Jinshan was at the construction site, so Xia ruofei did not let Yao Xin inform him to come back.

It was worth mentioning that Xia ruofei had always valued the Veterans. Hence, in this Department adjustment, he still insisted on listing the security Department, which had a relatively simple function, as a first – Class Department compared to the administrative, marketing, and finance departments.

“I’ve already briefly reported to the chairman before the meeting,” Feng Jing said.”We’ll just have to talk about the specific work that everyone is in charge of. If there are any difficulties or decisions that need to be made by the leaders, we’ll focus on them!”

After Feng Jing was done, the higher – ups began to report on their work. Starting from Dong Yun, everyone’s speech was very concise. They didn’t use the usual vague words of the government and spoke about their work.

Even so, more than an hour had passed by the time everyone had made their reports.

In fact, the company’s current operations were very healthy. They had taken a loan for the expansion of the pharmaceutical factory, but the debt rate was still quite low. In addition, the products had always been in short supply. Therefore, when they reported, they mainly talked about the recent work and did not have many difficulties that Xia ruofei needed to solve.

Xia ruofei cleared his throat. Just as he was about to conclude the meeting and ask everyone to go back to work, his phone on his table vibrated.

Xia ruofei took a glance and saw that it was a call from Qin Lan, the sales manager of the Yacht Club. He rejected the call and said with a smile,””I’m sorry! I’m going out to do something soon, and ... The phone is urging me again ... Then I’ll make it short, everyone’s work has been very good during this period! The results were also very remarkable! As the chairman, I really don’t have much to ask for. Everyone has done your best for the company, and the company will definitely not treat you badly! It was almost the end of the year, and the company would definitely not miss out on the benefits and benefits that they should have! There would be a bonus, and shares were not a dream! As long as everyone works hard for the company and walks hand in hand! All of you here will become millionaires, multimillionaires, and even billionaires!”
