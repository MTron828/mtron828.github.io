Translator: 549690339

Although Huanhuan had been to these places more than once, she was still very happy when Xia ruofei brought her to play. The joy that came from the bottom of her heart infected Xia ruofei and made him feel a few years younger.

That night, Xia ruofei stayed in the Presidential Suite of Hengfeng Jiahua.

Initially, Xia ruofei thought that there was no need to be so extravagant and that a normal suite would do. However, MA Xiong and his son were adamant about not agreeing. They said that this was their family’s business and that Xia ruofei was their family’s distinguished guest, so they had to treat him well.

Xia ruofei couldn’t argue with the enthusiastic father and son of the MA family, so he had no choice but to agree.

Huan Huan wished that she could stay with Xia ruofei at night. Ma Zhiming and his wife persuaded her to go home and sleep. The next day, they asked the driver to send her to the hotel early in the morning.

Originally, Huan Huan had arranged for summer classes, but Tian Huixin made a rare exception and pushed back these classes.

During the day, Xia ruofei accompanied Huanhuan to play around. At night, when they returned to the hotel, he paid close attention to the public’s reaction to the auction.

It could be said that the auction held by the peach blossom company and the Hengfeng auction house, whether it was in terms of economic benefits or brand promotion, was quite satisfactory.

Hong Kong’s mainstream newspapers used a large page to report. Everyone’s focus was different, but most of them were positive reports.

“The auction of the top – grade one – headed abalone is a huge success. Paradise Corporation becomes popular instantly.”

“Super One – headed abalone auctioned in Hong Kong. Tang Sheng from the United States spent 1.5 million US dollars to get it.”

“Hengfeng auction staged a feud between the rich and powerful, Li Kai and Zheng zhilun at loggerheads”

“Paradise abalone sold at a sky – High price. Domestic companies sound the horn to enter the high – end seafood industry.”

“A free taste of abalones at sky – High prices. The peach blossom company’s auction makes a shocking move.”

“A single abalone sold for 1.5 million US dollars. Hengfeng breaks the industry record again.”

......

Every report used a large space to introduce the background of the Paradise Corporation and the Grand occasion of the auction.

The tasting segment during the warm – up stage, the feud between Li Kai and Zheng zhilun, and Tang He’s record – breaking bid of 1.5 million dollars for the final abalone were the most reported details.

The Hengfeng auction house’s name was naturally mentioned again and again. It could be said that the Taoyuan company and Hengfeng group had become famous because of this auction.

The one who benefited the most was the Paradise Corporation. After all, Hengfeng group was already very famous in Hong Kong, and the Paradise Corporation had jumped from a small company in the mainland to a well – known company in Hong Kong.

Such an overwhelming report naturally became the topic of gossip among the Hong Kong citizens.

When Xia ruofei was having a meal with Huanhuan near Ocean Park, he accidentally overheard the people at the next table talking about paradise Corporation.

Cantonese was a little difficult for Xia ruofei, but Huanhuan could understand it. When the little girl heard the people around her talking about ruofei’s brother’s paradise Corporation, she immediately translated it for him excitedly.

In addition to the print media, the radio, television, and online media also gave a lot of coverage to the auction.

Xia ruofei was watching TV in the hotel. He noticed that a well – known TV station in Hong Kong was doing a talk show. They invited guests to discuss the one – headed abalone.

As for the various news reports, there were even more.

Especially on the internet, the content of the auction was overwhelming.

Xia ruofei searched for the keyword ‘paradise Corporation’ on Baidu and found that there were more than 80 million search results, compared to the previous one of a million.

Moreover, the contents on the first page were almost all related to the auction.

The traffic that the abalone auction brought to paradise Corporation was clear at a glance.

In addition to portal websites and news websites, there were also more and more discussions about the abalone auction at paradise Corporation on various major forums.

After the Hong Kong media reported it, many people moved to the forums and Tieba.

“The Paradise Corporation is awesome! So many rich people are fighting to buy their abalone!”

“Tsk! Hype! You’re just a small, unknown company. Why would they believe you?”

“Since ancient times, idiots have appeared on the second floor. The ancients didn’t lie!”

“Second floor of my uncle’s uniform! Op’s post even included so many screenshots from the Hong Kong media, are you choosing to ignore them?”

“Don’t worry about the trolls! The Paradise Corporation was very famous in San Shan! Although their vegetables and fruits are very expensive, their quality is really super high!”

“Hahaha! It’s the new Drunken Eight Immortals wine that was very popular some time ago. I heard that it’s also a shareholder of the Paradise Corporation. No wonder it’s like it’s been reborn ...” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Second floor, a brain is a good thing, but you don’t have one! The peach blossom company is mighty!”

“The people of the three mountains send their congratulatory message!”

“The people of Heron Island send their congratulatory messages!”

“The people of Jiangsu and Zhejiang send their congratulations! Recently, there’s a very popular Ironhide Kaede Dou in Qiantang city, also known as paradise brand. I took a look at the company’s LOGO just now, and it’s actually this paradise company that’s auctioning the best abalone!”

“This company is going against the heavens ...”

“I’ve seen the video of the auction. It’s definitely a high – end auction!”

“I’ve also watched the auction video. Am I the only one who noticed the beautiful CEO of paradise Corporation? You scums deserve to be losers for life!”

“I agree. I’m already a loyal fans of the goddess, CEO Feng!”

......

Xia ruofei was also overjoyed when he saw all kinds of comments on the internet.

He was also surprised to find that Feng Jing had also gone viral on the internet after the auction.

Quite a few netizens were impressed by the professional yet intelligent and beautiful image of a successful career woman. There was even a group of netizens who claimed to be Feng Jing’s fans. Soon, Feng Jing’s Tieba forum appeared. The power of netizens was immense, and they even managed to find some of Feng Jing’s past photos.

There were photos of her in her bachelor’s uniform when she graduated from college and photos of her working in the top 500 companies in her previous world.

Some of these photos were from Feng Jing’s University classmates ‘QQ space, while others were from news reports on her company’s official website. Even Feng Jing herself had probably forgotten that she had ever taken these photos.

As for Feng Rao’s experience, there was naturally no secret to be kept.

A successful career woman with a good face, high education, and a bright resume actually took the initiative to work in a small company. This was a very gimmicky thing, and naturally caused a lot of heated discussions among the forum members.

Some said that Feng Jing had; unique vision and had identified the potential of paradise Corporation; Some said that Feng Jing had randomly picked a small company after leaving her job and won the big prize. In short, there were all sorts of speculations and discussions.

Xia ruofei did not expect this.

He couldn’t help but feel fortunate that he had made the wise decision to push Feng Jing to the forefront. If he had been the one to take the stage that day, it would have been difficult for him to keep a low profile in the future.

Of course, a beauty had a natural bonus. Xia ruofei might not have such an effect if he went up alone. At least he would not be called a goddess by the male otakus, but he would definitely be famous.

The discussion about the Paradise Corporation and the beautiful CEO remained at a high level for the past few days.

Because of Feng Jing’s unexpected popularity, paradise Corporation also gained a lot of popularity and gained a certain level of fame in the country. It was no longer limited to the three mountains like before.

While Xia ruofei was in Hong Kong, he gave Feng Jing a call.

Feng Jing felt helpless about her sudden popularity. Over the phone, she was pouting and blaming Xia ruofei for letting her show up in public, which led to the current situation and caused her a lot of trouble.

Over the past few days, the company had received a lot of phone calls. Some were from companies in related industries seeking cooperation, while others were from the news media. They wanted to interview the new ‘internet celebrity’, Feng Jing.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.

However, the impact of this auction was still brewing. Even Xia ruofei himself did not expect that there would be an even bigger surprise later ...
