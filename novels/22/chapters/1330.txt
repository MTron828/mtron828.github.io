Chapter 1331: Supreme delicacy (1)

Translator: 549690339

Su Yu and Ling Xiaotian had a good personal relationship, and Xia ruofei was more familiar with him. They had had a few meals together.

Su Yu knew about Xia ruofei’s relationship with Ling Qingxue, so he treated Xia ruofei as his nephew from the bottom of his heart. Otherwise, he was a corporate executive with a net worth of at least tens of millions, and ran ran’s Executive Head Chef was almost no longer engaged in specific cooking work, so she would not have agreed to come over and cook for others.

After putting down the Chinese perch, Xia ruofei warmly invited Su Yu to sit beside him.

“President Tang, big brother Lin, researcher Zheng, let me introduce you. Uncle Su is the Executive Head Chef of the lingji F & B group. I’ve specially invited him to make this dish!” He said to everyone.

At first, Tang weiran saw Su Yu wearing a chef’s uniform and thought that he was a chef from Taoyuan farm. It was not until she heard Xia ruofei call him “Uncle Su” and introduce him as the Executive Head Chef of the Ling Ji F & B group that she realized.

Although he wasn’t clear about the situation of Ling Ji F & B, he knew that a “group” was usually not small. Although he couldn’t rule out the possibility that some small companies would also boast about calling themselves “groups” and even have several subsidiaries under them, in most cases, a group company was still quite large.

Moreover, this was someone who had a good relationship with Xia ruofei.

Therefore, Tang weiran did not dare to neglect and quickly said to Su Yu through Xia ruofei,”So it’s President su, thank you for your hard work!”

Su Yu took off his tall chef’s hat and carefully put it aside, then said with a smile, “You’re welcome. I heard that there’s a wild Chinese perch today, so I’m here to try it!”

Seeing that Su Yu had already revealed the answer, Xia ruofei no longer kept him in suspense. He smiled and said,”Everyone, this is the new dish I’m going to introduce to you today! Steamed kun fish! This is Tao Yuan farm’s imitation of the wild environment, and the young ones are cultivated from the wild Yangtze River pomfrets. If I remember correctly, it should be the only one in the country and even in the world!”

Then, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Uncle SU’s cooking skills are superb, and he’s especially good at cooking pomfrets! That’s why I specially invited him over to cook today. Everyone is in for a treat! Uncle Su, could you please introduce this dish to everyone?”

“Alright!” Su Yu laughed heartily and said,”I grew up by the Yangtze River. When I was a child, I had tasted the pure Taste of the Wild Chinese perch. Later, I entered the line of cooking and was lucky to have a master who taught me a few skills of cooking Chinese perch. Later, because of environmental reasons and over – harvesting, the wild Chinese perch was basically extinct, and I have never tasted the taste of the Chinese perch as a child again. However, there are still some United States rays on the market, so my cooking skills haven’t declined since I started cooking. You can all give your comments on this steamed ray later!”

Then, Su Yu pointed to the steamed kun fish and said,”Steamed Chinese perch is a famous traditional dish in my hometown, su Nan. Remove the gills and internal organs of the Chinese perch and then put it in boiling water to remove the fishy smell. Then, put ham slices, mushroom slices, bamboo shoots and other auxiliary materials on the fish. Then, add cooking lard, white sugar, salt, shrimp, cooking wine, chicken soup, and other seasonings. After steaming it on a high fire for about 20 minutes, it can be taken out of the cage.”

Feng Rao sniffled and said with a smile,””President su, just the smell alone is enough to make me drool!”

“Then what are we waiting for? Let’s dig in!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Xia ruofei picked up the serving chopsticks and picked up a piece of fish.

He had some understanding of Chinese perch, so he smiled as he picked it up.””Look, everyone, the scales on the surface are deliberately preserved because the Pomfret is different from other fish. Its scales are rich in high – Quality fat and colloid protein. After cooking, they will turn into a semi – melted colloid and have a very unique taste. If you remove the scales while cooking the pomfrets, it’ll be old – fashioned!”

After listening, Su Yu also smiled and nodded, very much in agreement.

Xia ruofei picked up the fish and said,”Uncle Su, you’ve worked hard today!” Please taste the first piece of fish!”

Su Yu waved his hand and said with a smile, “I’m here today to freeload food and drink, how can I overshadow the host? It’s not suitable, it’s not suitable!”

Xia ruofei put the fish on Su Yu’s plate and said, “It’s all thanks to you that we’re able to taste the almost extinct Chinese perch today. It’s only natural that you’re the first to taste it!”

Su Yu could only smile and nod,”Alright then! I’ll be arrogant!”

Then, Xia ruofei picked up another piece. When he was about to give it to Tang weiran, Tang weiran immediately refused,””President Xia, you can ‘t! No one had any objections to giving the first piece to President su, but you’ll have to eat this one yourself! Otherwise, it’ll really be overpowering the host!” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei saw that Tang weiran was determined, so he turned to Feng Jing. Before Xia ruofei could say anything, Feng Jing immediately covered her plate and said with a smile,””I don’t dare to ask my leader to serve me ...”

Xia ruofei looked around and his eyes fell on the person in charge of the pomfrets, Jiang Hua. The pomfrets were all raised under Jiang Hua’s careful care. Hence, Xia ruofei had invited him to the first harvest of his hard work today.

“Jiang Hua! It’s been hard on you these days!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”this piece of fish is your reward!”
