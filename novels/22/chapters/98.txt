Chapter 99: Lightning (1)

Calculating the time, a few hours should have passed in the space. Xia ruofei estimated that the Black Dog’s injuries should have recovered by now. Sure enough, when he entered the medium, he found that the Black Dog was no longer dejected. The small wounds on its body had already formed scabs, and only the fracture of its front leg had not recovered so quickly. At this time, it was limping in front of the space fish pond, and in front of it was the pair of Red Arowana. Xia ruofei broke out in a cold sweat. He was afraid that the red Arowana would be frightened or hurt, so he quickly shouted and ran over. When the Black Dog heard Xia ruofei’s voice, it immediately limped towards him and wagged its tail at Xia ruofei. Its eyes were filled with affection. Xia ruofei took a closer look and realized that the Black Dog was indeed much more energetic. The most obvious change was that its fur had become glossy and smooth, and it no longer looked like it was in dire straits. Xia ruofei did not know if it was an illusion, but he felt that the Black Dog’s eyes were especially lively, as if they had a trace of intelligence. The Black Dog ran to Xia ruofei’s side and stuck out its tongue to lick Xia ruofei’s feet. It kept wagging its tail at Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”Are you hungry?” He was just asking casually, but the Black dog’s tail wagged even more happily. It even barked twice, as if it was answering Xia ruofei’s question. “Hey! You can understand what I’m saying?” Xia ruofei was curious.”If you’re hungry, you can wag your tail. If you’re not, you can wag your tail ...” Xia ruofei was just making a passing remark. He did not expect the Black Dog, who was wagging its tail, to stop immediately. It wagged its tail and then stopped again. It looked at Xia ruofei with eager eyes. “You can really understand?” Xia ruofei found it unbelievable. Everyone knew that dogs could communicate with humans, but Xia ruofei had never heard of dogs being able to communicate with humans to this extent. He felt that it might be a coincidence, so he did a few more tests and found that as long as the problem was slightly simpler, the Black Dog would be able to respond correctly. It could indeed understand what he said. Seeing that Xia ruofei was enjoying it, the Black Dog couldn’t help but whine a few times in grievance. Xia ruofei finally reacted and laughed.”I know, I know. I’ll get you something to eat right away ... Just wait!” With that, Xia ruofei ran to the side of the pond and used the net to catch two grass carps. His control of the spirit map space had far exceeded what it used to be. He could even control the animals in the space to a certain extent with his mind, so catching fish was rather easy for him. Xia ruofei threw the grass carp on the ground. The grass carp was still jumping around in panic. The Black Dog had already pounced on it to tease it. It had been drooling at the fish in the pond just now, but it was too far to help. Xia ruofei realized that even though the Black Dog was still a little crippled, its speed was already very fast. It was like a gust of wind when it dashed out. For an ordinary dog to be able to understand human nature, Xia ruofei knew that it was most likely the magical effect of the petals of the strange flower and the spirit map space. In the beginning, Xia ruofei was worried that the fish bones would get stuck in the Black Dog’s mouth. He did not expect the dog to be so smart. The big fish bones were removed when it was eating, and the small one swallowed it directly. In a short while, the two fish were finished. The fish produced in the realm was delicious. The Black Dog was still not satisfied and kept barking at Xia ruofei. “What a greedy dog ...” Xia ruofei laughed and scolded. However, there were a lot of fish in the boundless space and they could reproduce by themselves. Xia ruofei could not finish all of them so he did not feel bad for a few fish. He ran over and caught two more and threw them to the Black Dog. After the two fish were finished, the Black Dog laid down beside Xia ruofei’s feet in satisfaction. Xia ruofei knelt down and gently stroked the Black Dog’s glossy fur. The Black Dog seemed to be enjoying it and squinted its eyes. “It’s fate that I met you today. You’ll follow me from now on!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”but I have to give you a name first. What should I call you ... Wang Cai? Big black?” The Black Dog lifted its eyelids and smacked its lips a few times, as if it was disdainful of Xia ruofei’s naming sense. “It does seem a little uncouth ...” Xia ruofei scratched his head awkwardly. After a moment of silence, he said,”I see that you’re so fast. Why don’t we call you lightning?” Isn’t that a cool name?” The Black Dog opened its eyes and wagged its tail at Xia ruofei, barking. Xia ruofei knew that this meant that he agreed, so he smiled and said,””Alright then! I’ll call you lightning from now on ... I didn’t expect you to be such a prideful guy! It’s not enough if the name isn’t flashy enough!” Lightning shook its head with a blank look on its face. It was obvious that the sentence was too complicated for it to understand with its intelligence. However, its limited spirituality still made it very dependent and intimate with Xia ruofei. After Xia ruofei and lightning played for a while in the interspace, they prepared to go out and prepare dinner. Before he left, he had given it some thought. It was definitely not possible to let lightning stay in the space. The time flow here was 20 times faster than the outside world. Staying here would be equivalent to quickly consuming Lightning’s life. However, Lightning’s injuries had not fully healed yet, so it was naturally the most suitable time to stay in the space. Hence, Xia ruofei thought for a while and said to lightning,””Lightning, stay here for a while, but there are some places you must not go, understand?” Xia ruofei then LED lightning around the space, pointing out the vegetable fields, fish ponds, and golden nanmu trees to it. He especially emphasized the small fish pond where the red Arowana was, the spiritual pond in the space, and the unnamed plant that produced the exotic flower. Next, Xia ruofei fished out more than ten fish from the medium and used the spiritual pond water to grow them in the big wooden barrel used to soak seeds. He told lightning to eat the fish if it was hungry. Xia ruofei then left the spirit map space. Before he left, Xia ruofei fed lightning a few mouthfuls of the petal solution and applied some on its injured leg. However, Xia ruofei was still a little worried. When he was outside, he continued to pay attention to the situation in the space. He realized that lightning was very obedient. Although it was wandering in the space, it would not go near the few “restricted areas” that he had pointed out. After observing for a while, Xia ruofei finally felt at ease. Xia ruofei went to the kitchen to prepare dinner and took a shower. He then surfed the internet in his room for a while. He estimated that a few days had passed in the interspace before he summoned the spirit painting and used his mind to check the situation inside the painting. Sure enough, lightning seemed to have fully recovered. It was running around happily in the space, and there were only one or two space grass carp left in the wooden bucket. The vegetable field, the spiritual pool, the fish pond, and the nameless plant were all intact. Obviously, lightning was following his instructions strictly. With a thought, Xia ruofei moved the lightning out of the spirit map space.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com
