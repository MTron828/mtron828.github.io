Chapter 322: How about you take in an apprentice?

Xia ruofei’s expression froze and he laughed dryly.”Old Mr. Li, didn’t the Bureau chief arrange for you to go to the big hospitals for a check – up? Kidney stones ...” “Little Xia, you don’t have to hide it from me.” Li Zhifu stared into Xia ruofei’s eyes and said,”it’s definitely not a good illness, right?” The old man’s eyes seemed to be able to see through everything. Xia ruofei felt uncomfortable under his gaze. Xia ruofei was silent for a while before he raised his head and said,””It’s colon cancer,” Li Zhifu slightly nodded and calmly said,””Thank you for telling me. Let’s go and eat!” “Old Mr. Li ...” Xia ruofei wanted to speak but stopped. “Are you wondering why I’m so calm?” li Zhifu asked with a smile. Xia ruofei didn’t say anything. Li Zhifu continued,””I’ve already lived for more than 90 years. Most of my old buddies who were around my age are no longer around. I’ve lived long enough!” Xia ruofei looked at li Zhifu and asked,”Old Mr. Li, are you ... Not afraid of death at all?” A faint smile appeared on li Zhifu’s honest face as he said,””Who wouldn’t be afraid of death? Who didn’t want to live a few more days? It’s better to live than to die! Besides, my tea – making skills haven’t been passed down yet! Little song has just arranged for me to give a vocational lecture, but I can’t go now ... But what can I do with this illness?” Li Zhifu had experienced too many ups and downs in his life. During the time when elder song was stationed in xiakeng village, li Zhifu was almost killed by bandits hiding in the mountains several times. He even fell off a cliff once. After experiencing so much, he had become indifferent to life and death. Xia ruofei was also slightly moved. He said seriously,””Mr. Li, if you trust me, you can stay at my farm. I’ll treat you with traditional Chinese medicine. Although I can’t guarantee what effect it will have, I can still alleviate your condition.” Li Zhifu nodded with a smile and said,”Then I’ll have to trouble you, little Xia.” “You’re too polite. ” Xia ruofei said,”let’s go in and eat!” Xia ruofei led Li Zhifu into the mansion and introduced him to ye Lingyun. Then, the three of them sat down for dinner. After the meal, Xia ruofei showed li Zhifu the room that was prepared for him. Li Zhifu was not particular about this and expressed his gratitude to Xia ruofei very politely. Xia ruofei was still feeling uneasy at first. After all, elder song had told him to keep his condition a secret from li Zhifu. However, he had told the truth just now. However, li Zhifu did not seem to be affected at all. He was still in a good mood and was fiddling with Xia ruofei’s unprofessional tea set in the living room. Then, he stood in front of the huge fish tank and admired the pair of Blood Dragons. He even let out a few words of praise. Xia ruofei was slightly relieved. It seemed that this old man’s mentality was really good. When they were at the Gu Ling courtyard, Xia ruofei had prepared four portions of Chinese medicine. Li Zhifu had only taken one at noon and had brought the remaining three portions. Hence, Xia ruofei took out a sealed Chinese medicine bag from the refrigerator. He poured out the Chinese medicine and heated it up. After li Zhifu finished it, he chatted with him for a while before going upstairs to his room. The next morning, Xia ruofei went downstairs and saw li Zhifu strolling in the yard with his hands behind his back. He was even watching ye Lingyun train with great interest. “Old Mr. Li, you’re up so early!” Xia ruofei smiled and greeted him. “The older you get, the less you sleep. You woke up before dawn!” Li Zhifu chuckled. Then, li Zhifu asked again,”Xiao Xia, I walked around your farm this morning and saw that there was still a large area of empty land on the mountain behind!” Why don’t you plant some tea trees?” Xia ruofei said,”old Mr. Li, I’ve already reserved the fruit tree seedlings. I’m planning to plant the cherry trees on the mountain.” Besides ... The climate and environment of the three mountains are not suitable for planting tea trees!” “That’s true ...” Li Zhifu said with a slight disappointment. Li Zhifu’s love for tea leaves came from his bones, especially after he learned that he was terminally ill. He was even more brooding about not being able to pass on his unique tea – making skills. Xia ruofei could tell. However, he knew that since he had treated li Zhifu, li Zhifu’s life would not be in danger. As for his tea – making skills, he could find a suitable disciple to pass them on to after he recovered. Hence, Xia ruofei did not say much to li Zhifu to comfort him. However, when Xia ruofei thought of passing down the tea – making skills, he suddenly had an idea. “Old Mr. Li, you must really want to pass down your tea – making skills!” Xia ruofei said to li Zhifu. “Yeah! Unfortunately, time waits for no one!” Li Zhifu said with a bitter smile. “Old man, I have a suggestion ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile. No matter how he looked at it, it seemed like there was a conspiracy. “What suggestion?” li Zhifu asked. Xia ruofei turned to ye Lingyun, who was doing push – ups on the ground, and said,””Ling Yun! Get up, get up ...” Ye Lingyun immediately stood up with both hands and jogged to Xia ruofei. He asked,””Brother Xia, what’s the matter?” Xia ruofei said seriously,”attention!” Raise your head, stick out your chest, and suck in your stomach! Don’t tell me you’ve forgotten how to stand after being discharged from the Army!” Ye Lingyun quickly stood up straight and placed his hands on the outside of his thighs. However, he looked puzzled as he did not know what Xia ruofei was up to so early in the morning. Xia ruofei turned around and smiled at li Zhifu.””Mr. Li, what do you think about Ling Yun being your disciple?” Ye linyun was confused and quickly asked,””Brother Xia, what disciple?” Li Zhifu didn’t know whether to laugh or cry as he said,”Little Xia, I don’t accept disciples randomly. It’s useless no matter how straight you tell him to stand! Tea – making requires talent. ” “How do you know he doesn’t have the talent if you don’t try?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”since you’re staying at my farm and have nothing to do, why don’t you teach Ling Yun?” “Brother Xia, what’s going on?” ye linyun couldn’t help but ask. “Don’t say anything. ” Xia ruofei said,”I’m begging old Mr. Li to take me in as his disciple! If you can learn old Mr. Li’s unique skill, you won’t starve to death no matter where you go!” “I’m not thinking of going out!” Ye linyun asked curiously,”I’m doing well in the company. Why would I go out?” “I’m just making an analogy!” Xia ruofei widened his eyes and said,”don’t you know that there’s no pressure in having more skills? Don’t talk!” “Oh ...” Xia ruofei was thinking about the tea trees that he had planted in the boundless space. They would soon produce tea leaves. If ye Lingyun could learn how to make tea from li Zhifu, he would not have to worry about making tea leaves in the future. Ye linyun was someone that could be trusted completely. “Little Xia, it’s a serious matter to take in a disciple. You can’t joke about it,” said li Zhifu with a bitter smile. “Mr. Li, I’m not joking.” Xia ruofei said,”if you feel that it’s not appropriate to take him in as a disciple, then don’t hold the ceremony for now. You can teach Ling Yun how to make tea when you’re bored. That should be fine, right?” Then, Xia ruofei said in a bewitching tone,””Who knows, maybe Ling Yun has a gift for making tea? Won’t You Be able to find an inheritor with your unique skill?” Li Zhifu’s face showed a slight hint of interest.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com
