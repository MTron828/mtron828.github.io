Translator: 549690339

Liang Weimin couldn’t help but be stunned.

Then, he remembered that this kid had not called home for a long time. Now that his son had called Xia ruofei, he could not help but feel a little jealous. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The boss was more important than her parents? Even though Liang Weimin knew that there was no comparison, he still couldn’t help but come up with this idea.

Naturally, Xia ruofei did not notice Liang Weimin’s thoughts. He pressed the answer button and said with a smile, “Brother Liang, I haven’t contacted you in a long time! Do you have any good news for me?”

On the other end of the phone, Liang Qichao naturally didn’t know that his father was right beside Xia ruofei. He said in a bad mood,” “Ruofei, you’re too relaxed as a boss. I didn’t call to report, and you’re not going to ask? So the farms in Australia aren’t worthy of your attention?”

Liang Qichao’s voice was quite loud. Liang Weimin, who was sitting beside Xia ruofei, could also hear him. He was speechless.

I thought this kid had improved! She didn’t expect him to speak to her boss in such a tone. She was so angry ...

However, Liang Weimin quickly noticed that Xia ruofei was not afraid and was still smiling. He knew that his son and Xia ruofei had a good relationship. Their relationship was not just that of a boss and employee. Perhaps they were already used to this kind of interaction.

When he thought of this, Liang Weimin couldn’t help but feel a little gratified.

Liang Weimin was well aware of Xia ruofei’s power. Other things aside, Xia ruofei’s connections in the three mountains were really wide. He also had a vague feeling that what he had seen was only the tip of the iceberg. Xia ruofei’s true power might be even deeper.

As a father, he was happy that his son could be good friends with someone like Xia ruofei. At the same time, he was worried that Liang Qichao was too careless and might make Xia ruofei unhappy. All kinds of conflicting thoughts were intertwined.

Xia ruofei didn’t know that Liang Weimin had such complicated thoughts. He still smiled and said,” “Brother Liang, let’s not talk about this for now. But today ...”

Xia ruofei looked at Liang Weimin. He was about to tell Liang Qichao that he was having dinner with Liang Weimin, but he was interrupted by Liang Qichao.

” Ruofei, my matter is more important. Let me go first! ” Liang Qichao said.

Xia ruofei and Liang Weimin couldn’t help but be stunned. Liang Weimin couldn’t help but roll his eyes.

Xia ruofei looked at Liang Weimin apologetically and smiled bitterly. ” “Okay, then you go first ... What’s so important that you can’t even wait for a moment? Don’t tell me that you’ve already settled things with Daphne and can’t wait to share the good news with me? ”

Daphne was the deputy manager of Paradise Farm. Not only was she very capable, but she was also a big-breasted beauty with blonde hair and blue eyes. The last time Xia ruoxin flew to Australia, she felt Liang Qichao exchanging flirtatious glances with her. For a moment, she forgot that Liang Weimin was still beside her, and she could not help but crack a joke.

When Liang Weimin heard this, he couldn’t help but prick up his ears, and he subconsciously straightened his back.

What was going on? This kid didn’t work hard outside, but actually went to pick up Western girls! If he dares to bring a foreign girl back, I’ll break his legs!

As Liang Weimin thought about this, he couldn’t help but grit his teeth in anger.

Xia ruofei looked up and saw this scene. He suddenly realized that he had spoken too much ...

However, Liang Qichao didn’t seem to notice. Instead, he laughed and said, ” “What kind of good news is this? If I, young master Liang, were to make a move, how many Western girls would be able to resist my charm? ”

Xia ruofei could not stop him in time. He could only look at Liang Weimin innocently, who was about to go crazy. At the same time, he was praying for Liang Qichao in his heart ...

Liang Weimin was a very old-fashioned person. He was very strict with his son’s private life. In the past, when Liang Qichao wanted to go out for a drink in China, he had to be sneaky and try his best to find an excuse. If he had really picked up a foreign girl, his stubborn father would probably fly to Australia and bring him back.

Liang Weimin gestured at Xia ruofei, indicating that he wanted to talk to Liang Qichao.

Xia ruofei couldn’t refuse and could only helplessly hand the phone over.

Liang Weimin took a deep breath, then took the phone and said calmly,””Liang Qichao, you’ve become more capable now!”

The other end of the phone was dead silent.

Liang Qichao would never have thought that his father would be with Xia ruofei. Apparently, his father had heard his joke and took it seriously.

After a long while, Liang Qichao seemed to wake up from a dream. He quickly said,””Dad! Why are you with ruofei? I ... I was just joking with RUO Fei!”

“Who’s Daphne?” Liang Weimin asked indifferently, unmoved.

“She’s the deputy manager of our farm, just an ordinary colleague,”Liang Qichao explained hurriedly.

“Last time I asked you about your colleague, didn’t you tell me that the deputy manager was a bald man?” Liang Weimin asked, his tone still calm.

However, Xia ruofei and Liang Qichao could feel that a volcano was brewing under the calm.

Liang Qichao wanted to cry, but no tears came out. He was worried that his old – fashioned father would be worried, so he told a white lie last time. This time, he would never be able to clear his name.
