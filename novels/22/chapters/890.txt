“Yes, master!” Xia Qing said immediately.

There were hundreds of Cordyceps, so Xia ruofei naturally wouldn’t stay here stupidly and wait. Anyway, Xia Qing would be more professional than him in handling such work. So after Xia ruofei assigned the task to Xia Qing, he left the medium with a thought.

He went to the bathroom and took a quick shower. He changed into a fresh set of short – sleeved casual clothes and went downstairs to eat in his slippers.

After Lin Qiao filled in her application form, her work at school was done. All that was left was to wait for the letter of admission. With her grades, she was almost certain to be admitted to Heron Island University. Therefore, she continued to intern at Xia ruofei’s company as a way to gain some work experience in advance.

When Xia ruofei went downstairs, Lin Qiao had just returned from the company’s general office building. Although she was only interning in the company and the employees all knew that she was the boss’s sister and took good care of her, she still followed the working hours consciously. She even bought two sets of professional clothes for work, making her look more formal.

Xia ruofei saw Lin Qiao, who was wearing a business suit and changing into slippers, and couldn’t help but smile.””Not bad, not bad. Qiao’ er is becoming more and more like a white – collar worker ...”

Lin Qiao rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,”Brother ruofei, you’re making fun of me again ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’m complimenting you!” How’s work been?”

“It’s pretty good! Everyone’s been taking good care of me!” Lin Qiao said happily,”recently, I’ve been busy with the renovation of the online store with my two masters. We designed all the elements of the website ourselves! I’m sure you’ll be impressed!”

Xia ruofei laughed and replied,”yes!” I have confidence in my sister ...”

Lin Qiao said with embarrassment,”Actually, I’m just an assistant! The main work was done by the Masters. Brother ruofei, you have to give them a bonus after this job is done! My two masters are very serious people. They didn’t download any ready – made templates. They wrote thousands of lines of code themselves and designed every web page element!”

Xia ruofei patted Lin Qiao’s head affectionately and said,””Okay, okay, okay. When the time comes, I’ll not only give them a red packet, but also give you an encouraging red packet!”

At this moment, Hu Zi’s mother walked out with a dish and said,””Qiao’ er, why are you pestering your brother to talk the moment you come back? Why aren’t you changing your clothes, washing your hands, and eating?”

“Oh! “Got it ...” Lin Qiao stuck out her tongue playfully and ran back to her room. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

After a while, Lin Qiao also changed into her home clothes and came out. Xia ruofei helped Hu Zi’s mother bring out the dishes, and the family sat around the table and ate dinner happily.

After dinner, Xia ruofei accompanied Lin Qiao to play with Blackie and lightning for a while before going back to his room.

After he locked the door and windows, he took out the spirit map scroll from his palm and entered the space.

Due to the time flow being 30 times faster, Xia Qing, who was in the Archean realm, had already completed the work assigned by Xia ruofei. She was currently busy at the Da Hong Pao tea tree not far away.

When he saw Xia ruofei enter the medium, he immediately stopped what he was doing and walked over quickly.

“Master!” Xia Qing called out respectfully.

“You dug out all the aweto?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing quickly took a small plastic tidying box from the side and handed it to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei took it and saw that it was full of yellow – Brown wormgrass. The head of each wormgrass was connected to a small dark purple grass head. If someone with trypophobia or a natural fear of insects saw so many wormgrass placed together, they would probably feel numb in their hearts.

However, this little thing that looked a little scary was actually a precious medicinal herb that was worth cities.

Xia ruofei took a quick look and found that the wormgrass was of uniform size, similar to the first one Xia Qing dug out before dinner. Each one was much bigger than the level 1 grass gersun sold to him last time. It was clear that this batch of wormgrass was of high quality.

“Xia Qing, how many are there in total?”

“Master, I’ve counted. There are 597 in total.” Xia Qing said respectfully,”I’ve also weighed them. These wormgrass weigh about 490 grams in total. It’s just a little short of one catty.”

Under Xia ruofei’s guidance, Xia Qing had also learned how to use modern precision weighing tools such as a scale and an electronic scale.

Xia ruofei did some quick calculations and said happily,””That is to say, we only need about 1200 wormgrass of this standard to weigh 1000 grams! It’s indeed a top quality wormgrass!”

The standard for level one grass was roughly 2000 pieces of worm grass per kilogram. If a single worm grass was heavier than this, it would be a special product.

However, it was already amazing if a special product could reach 1500 wormgrass per kilogram. Xia ruofei’s experimental product had reached 1200 wormgrass per kilogram. One or two wormgrass of the Supreme quality might appear occasionally, but it was almost impossible to produce them in large quantities.

“Yes, Master.” Xia Qing also happily replied. I took a wormgrass and checked its properties. It’s indeed much better than the level – one Nagqu grass you bought last time. The effect of this wormgrass is far better than that of ordinary wormgrass!”
