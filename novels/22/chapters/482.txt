Chapter 483: Core rune_1

Xia ruofei had intended to go upstairs, but when he saw the black Mercedes – Benz return to the farm, he gave up on the idea and walked out of the villa.

This Mercedes – Benz was a congratulatory gift from Grandpa Tang He when the ribbon – cutting ceremony was held for the completion of the complex two days ago. Xia ruofei didn’t like this kind of formal business style, so he used this car as the official car for the company’s top management. In fact, he assigned the car to Feng Jing.

Of course, if there were important business events that required Xia ruofei’s attendance, he would not mind using the car. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The road from the entrance of the farm to the complex would make a turn at the small villa.

Qin Xiaojun, who was driving, saw Xia ruofei coming out of the villa to greet him. Naturally, he stepped on the brakes and stopped the car.

After the job fair, pang Hao had gone straight back to his home in the city, so Feng Jing was the only one in the back seat.

Feng Rao immediately opened the car door and got out of the car when she saw Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei stood on the side of the driver’s seat and cast a questioning look at Qin Xiaojun. Qin Xiaojun naturally understood Xia ruofei’s intention and said in a low voice,””Brother Xia, everything’s normal. There’s no one suspicious.”

Xia ruofei nodded slightly and did not continue to ask about Yingying’s situation. Since they did not know about Yingying’s situation, there was no need to worry Feng Jing.

Xia ruofei didn’t know that Liang Haiming’s influence in Sanshan was not that strong. After all, the southeast province was under the song family’s traditional sphere of influence. The Liang family’s influence was very limited, so Liang Haiming’s revenge was only targeted at him. He didn’t have any plans to deal with Taoyuan farm for the time being.

In fact, Liang Haiming didn’t like such a small farm.

Hence, Xia ruofei’s worries were unnecessary. However, from his perspective, he had to prepare for the worst.

“Chairman.” Feng Rao called out to him with a smile after she got out of the car.

Xia ruofei also showed a gentle smile and asked,””President Feng, you’ve worked hard! How’s the situation today?”

“Not bad! It’s better than expected. ” Feng Rao smiled.

“Let’s go, we’ll talk while we walk!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s almost time to eat. Ask sister – in – Law to make two more dishes.”

Then, Xia ruofei turned to Qin Xiaojun and said,””Little Jun, park your car and come over!”

“Alright, brother Xia!” Qin Xiaojun said with a grin. Then, he drove away.

“Chairman, we’ve received more than 40 resumes today.” Feng Jing said as she walked,”I’ve done a preliminary scan and there are about 20 people who meet the requirements. The job fair will be over in a day, so I plan to go there tomorrow to see if I can get anything else.”

“More than forty? Not bad!” Xia ruofei was also surprised.”It seems that it’s not easy to find a job now!” There’s actually someone who wants to sign up to work on the farm. ”

Feng Jing pursed her lips into a smile and said,”we’re hiring under the name of paradise Corporation. We didn’t specify where we’re working. However, if the applicants ask, we’ll tell them the truth.” I’m going to do a round of screening tomorrow night and send out the interview notice. The day after tomorrow, I’ll interview on the farm. I think we should be mentally prepared, as some people will probably back out. ”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”that’s not a big deal!” We will welcome those who have met the requirements and are willing to stay, but we won’t force those who are unwilling. However, I can be sure that it won’t be long before those who voluntarily give up will regret it!”

Xia ruofei’s words were full of confidence. However, Feng Jing had a complete understanding of the situation at paradise Corporation, so she didn’t think that Xia ruofei was arrogant at all. Instead, she nodded in agreement.

“By the way, how’s the online recruitment going?” Xia ruofei asked.

“The response is pretty good too.” Feng Jing said,”we’ve clearly written down the location of the job and the relevant benefits on the recruitment website. There are quite a few people who are interested in it. As of this morning, we’ve received about 30 e – resumes!”

“Not bad, not bad!” Xia ruofei was very satisfied with the result.

“However, some of the people who applied online are not local to Sanshan. Therefore, I plan to interview them separately. Those who applied online will be in the next batch.” Feng ke said.

“Sure.” Xia ruofei agreed without a second thought.

The two of them chatted and soon arrived at the complex.

Qin Xiaojun had already parked his car in the parking space behind the building. He had built a row of shaded parking spaces behind the building. His Mercedes – Benz was usually parked there.

The three of them went to the staff cafeteria on the first floor.

Other than Cao tieshu, the other farm employees had basically gone home after work. Lunch was provided for free at Qin Zhuan farm, but dinner had to be paid. They could apply for a card at pang Hao’s office in the finance department, deposit money into the card, and use it for their meals.

The villagers were usually more frugal, so almost no one stayed for dinner.

As for Cao tieshu, because his wife was here, he was too lazy to go back to cook. Thus, he ate his dinner at the farm. After that, he would stay behind to help his wife clean up the cafeteria. The two of them would then go home together.

Hence, for the time being, it was dinnertime in the staff cafeteria. There were only Lei Hu and a few others, Cao tieshu and his wife, two other staff members in the cafeteria, Xia ruofei, and Feng Jing.

Today, in order to strengthen the security, Lei Hu and the rest did not eat in the cafeteria, making it even more deserted.
