Chapter 156: The ultimate luxury (1)

The Gulfstream G650 commercial plane landed smoothly at Pudong International Airport. When the plane taxied to the bus stop, several luxury business cars sent by Hengfeng group’s shencheng office were already waiting on the tarmac. The manager of the shencheng office came to greet the big boss in person. He stood respectfully beside the plane. After MA Xiong got off the plane, the manager immediately bowed and greeted him. He also instructed several employees to come forward and move the luggage. A super – rich man like MA Xiong owned countless properties all over the world. In an international city like Shen Cheng city, MA Xiong’s property was naturally present. In fact, the luxury villa he had bought a few years ago was located in the bustling outer beach. Their entire family, including Lu You, naturally stayed in that villa. MA Xiong also asked for Xia ruofei’s opinion with a smile and invited him to stay with them. Xia ruofei considered the fact that it was someone else’s house and that he had two women with him. It would be inconvenient for him to live with them and he would feel uncomfortable, so he politely declined. MA Xiong respected Xia ruofei’s wishes and immediately arranged for a car to send Xia ruofei to the hotel. His family and Lu You got into another car to go home. When little Huanhuan heard that Xia ruofei was not staying with them, she seemed a little depressed and almost cried. It was only when Xia ruofei promised to take her to visit the Bund that her mood turned into joy. She obediently followed Tian Huixin and the others into the car. The business car brought Xia ruofei to Hengfeng Jiahua Hotel, which was also located in the outer beach. Jiahua was Hengfeng group’s most high – end hotel brand. It was positioned as the top luxury hotel. So far, the Hengfeng group had only opened five Jiahua hotels in the world. The Jiahua Hotel located in the outer beach of Shen Cheng was the latest one. The media used a seven – Star hotel to describe Hengfeng Jiahua’s Beach house because the standard was far higher than a five – Star hotel. The total investment of this hotel reached 3.5 billion Chinese dollars, and there were a total of 200 rooms. After conversion, the average cost of each room was as high as 17 million Yuan, and the cost of one room was almost enough to buy any outer beach mansion. Every guest room here was equipped with an intelligent control system. The ground and ceiling of the hotel’s public area were all decorated with colored glass and Jade. It was said that an entire mine was mined just for this Jiahua Hotel. When they arrived at the hotel, Xia ruofei found out that MA Xiong had specially asked the hotel to reserve the Presidential Suite on the highest floor after knowing that Xia ruofei would come to Shen Cheng. Obviously, if Xia ruofei had chosen to stay at MA Xiong’s Villa today, the Presidential Suite, which cost as much as 128888 Yuan per night, would be left empty. The rich were just so willful! Xia ruofei had no choice but to accept MA Xiong’s arrangement with a bitter smile. He knew clearly that even if he called and asked for a normal suite, MA Xiong would never agree. When they arrived at the hotel, a well – proportioned private butler in a black business suit greeted Xia ruofei with a smile at the door. The ‘welcoming Angel’ served ‘welcoming tea’ on a tray. Even the clothes on the “welcoming Angel” were made by the famous designer Lawrence Xu. The luxury of the Jia Hua hotel was reflected in every detail. All the check – in procedures had been completed in advance. The beautiful private butler led Xia ruofei through a special elevator to the Presidential Suite on the 20th floor of the hotel, which was also the highest floor of the room. The Presidential Suite Room number was 2088, and it covered an area of 288 square meters. It also represented the ultimate luxurious accommodation experience of Hengfeng Jiahua Hotel. It had a living room, dining room, bar, study room, and dining room. There was a custom sauna room and a super large massage bathtub in the bathroom. The entire suite space was matched with a full set of custom – made expensive furniture and gorgeous three – dimensional golden silk su embroidery. The concept of ultimate luxury was reflected everywhere. The private butler gently introduced Xia ruofei to the various parts of the Presidential Suite. After carefully questioning Xia ruofei, she politely left. The private butler only served Xia ruofei during the entire stay. If Xia ruofei had any requests, she would be the first to appear. After the private butler left, Xia ruofei strolled around the ridiculously large Presidential Suite alone. He could not help but be amazed by the luxury of this Presidential Suite of a seven – Star hotel. Such luxury was reflected in every detail. For example, the bedroom was equipped with the “Hengfeng Jiahua bed” made by the United States’s talalaya latex. The comfort level was first – Class, and the pillowcase was actually embroidered with Xia ruofei’s name in advance. Next to the bed was the most high – end Ogawa full – body massage chair. Sitting on the massage chair and enjoying the most comfortable massage while looking out of the floor – to – Ceiling window at the ships coming and going on the Huangpu River and the bustling outer beach in the distance, it was definitely a Supreme enjoyment. There were many other similar details. The faucet in the bathroom was made of pure gold, the sink was inlaid with crystals, the faucet of the Super large Jacuzzi was the only pure gold swan faucet in the entire hotel, and the toiletries were all from Hermes. There were also precious works of art everywhere in the suite, as well as Smart Room facilities controlled by an iPad ... Everything that he saw refreshed Xia ruofei’s understanding of luxury. It was true that people could not pursue material things as their ultimate goal, but it was undeniable that money could bring high quality of life enjoyment. All of this opened Xia ruofei’s eyes and touched him greatly. Even with Xia ruofei’s current earning speed, the Presidential Suite that cost more than 120000 a night was not easy to stay in. Of course, Xia ruofei, who had the spirit map space, would not be affected by this. Instead, this experience filled Xia ruofei with the motivation to move forward. He believed that in the near future, it would not be just a dream for the Paradise Corporation to become a ten – billion – dollar financial group like the Hengfeng group. Xia ruofei’s lunch was settled in the Presidential Suite. The Executive Head Chef from the hotel’s top – Floor restaurant, the legendary France Michelin star chef, Mr. Mark, personally made an exquisite French meal and sent it directly to the restaurant in the Presidential Suite. After lunch, Xia ruofei took an hour’s nap in his large and comfortable custom – made latex bed. He changed into a bathrobe and went to the hotel’s swimming pool. Jiahua hotel’s swimming pool had a unique intelligent Starlight control system. The ceiling was like a starry sky, enough to pass off as the real thing. The entire swimming pool was shrouded in a dreamy glow and was beautiful beyond words. Xia ruofei swam two thousand meters to his heart’s content. Then, he returned to the Presidential Suite for a nice sauna and a shower. He changed his clothes and prepared to head to MA Xiong’s Villa on the Bund. MA Xiong had invited him to have dinner with him and he had promised to take Huanhuan on a night tour on the Bund. The private butler had prepared everything in advance. When Xia ruofei arrived at the entrance of the hotel and saw the car prepared for him, he was once again shocked. It was a Rolls – Royce Phantom! According to the private butler, this car was not specially prepared for Xia ruofei. It was the standard of a Presidential Suite, which meant that anyone who was staying in the Presidential Suite could enjoy the shuttle service of this Rolls – Royce Phantom. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but sigh,”Hengfeng Jiahua is really rich!” [PS] announcing the VIP Reader group number: 295848872, genuine readers are welcome to join the group (after joining the group, you need to verify the screenshot of the full subscription).
