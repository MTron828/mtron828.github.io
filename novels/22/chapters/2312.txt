“Don’t worry, Auntie!” Xia ruofei grinned and said,”I know what I’m doing! But don’t be too anxious, I already have some ideas about uncle song’s condition ...”

Fang Liyun nodded her head and said,”Ruofei, it’s all thanks to you this time. Otherwise, we really don’t know what to do ...”

Ling Qingxue chuckled and said,””Auntie, don’t be so polite with ruofei. This is what he should do!”

Ling Qingxue glanced at Xia ruofei.

Naturally, Fang Liyun did not understand what she was trying to say. However, Xia ruofei and Song Wei both looked a little unnatural. Fortunately, Fang Liyun did not notice it.

After everyone chatted for a while, Ling Qingxue said,””Aunty, Wei Wei, I still have something to do at the company, so I’ll go back first! If uncle song needs me to do anything, just give me a call! I’ll come back to visit uncle song in two days!”

“Qingxue, you should get back to work!” Fang Liyun said. There’s nothing going on here, so don’t come running over!”

“I’ll go and send Qingxue off!”Xia ruofei said. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“It’s almost time, you and Auntie should have lunch first!”He said to Song Wei. I’ll have lunch outside and do something while I’m at it. I’ll come back in the afternoon!”

“Ruofei, you’ve been busy for more than a day. Don’t come over today. Have a good rest at home tonight.” Fang Liyun said.

Xia ruofei grinned and said,”it’s okay!” I’m more at ease with uncle song by myself!”

At this moment, Ling Qingxue said,”Oh right, ruofei mentioned eating. I just remembered ... Aunty, Weiwei, I’ve already spoken to Ling Ji’s private kitchen. They’ll prepare the food in the next few days and send it to the hospital on time.”

“Qingxue, there’s no need to go through so much trouble!” Fang Liyun quickly said. Xiao Li, you can go to the hospital entrance to buy some food ...”

Ling Qingxue laughed and said,”aunty!” It was not troublesome at all! My family does this, so we just send someone to deliver it. After all, what we do is healthier and more hygienic. Now, you and Wei Wei must take care of your bodies and don’t fall sick again!”

“Aunty, this is Qingxue’s kind intention. Please don’t reject it!” Xia ruofei said.

“Alright then!” Fang Liyun said. Thank you, Qingxue!”

“Auntie, you’re welcome!” Ling Qingxue smiled sweetly.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue bade farewell to Fang Liyun and her daughter and took the elevator down.

Ling Qingxue smiled and asked,”shouldn’t you be spending more time with Weiwei?” I’m already an adult, I don’t need you to send me off. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”of course I have to protect such a beautiful wife!” What if she’s taken away by someone?”

Ling Qingxue’s face heated up slightly. She glanced at Xia ruofei and said,””You’re so glib! That’s how you got Wei Wei, right?”

Xia ruofei immediately cried out,”Qingxue, don’t you know about my situation with Weiwei?” It was an accident ... My character is not ...”

“Your character has long gone bankrupt!” Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”Wei Wei told me that she had liked you for a long time even before the two of you started practicing the ‘absolute beginning Heart Sutra’ together!”

Xia ruofei did not know whether to laugh or cry,”I really don’t know!” And ... You can’t blame me for this, right?”

“Of course it’s your fault! Who told you to go and flirt with other girls?” Ling Qingxue said matter – of – factly.

Xia ruofei realized that he could not reason with women, so he wisely chose to shut up.

In fact, Ling Qingxue was not really that jealous. It was just that when she thought about Xia ruofei and Song Wei, she could not help but want to scold Xia ruofei. Seeing that Xia ruofei had taken the initiative to give in, she did not continue to talk about this matter.

Ling Qingxue’s emotional intelligence wasn’t low, and she knew what to do.

The two of them arrived at the parking lot, and Ling Qingxue said,””I drove here, so you don’t need to send me ...”

Xia ruofei said shamelessly,”then you can give it to me!” I’m going back to the Riverside Villa area. ”

Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei and asked,””Didn’t you drive?”

“It’s opened!” Xia ruofei said,”but I just want to stay with you for a little longer!”

Ling Qingxue chuckled and said,”shameless ...”

In the end, she did not reject Xia ruofei and allowed him to sit in her car.

Along the way, Xia ruofei continued to sweet – talk Ling Qingxue, making her tremble with joy. Soon, they arrived at the villa district where they lived.

The car stopped in front of Xia ruofei’s Villa. Xia ruofei unbuckled his seat belt and said,””Qingxue, if the company’s matters aren’t urgent, why don’t you just not go today?”

Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei warily and said,””What bad idea are you up to now?”

Xia ruofei said innocently,”no way!” What I want to say is ... It’s been a long time since we’ve cultivated together. I’m just worried that your cultivation level will regress. ”

“I have my own cultivation every day.” Ling Qingxue said.

“I understand the” absolute beginning Heart Sutra “all too well. If a person practices it alone, they can at most maintain their cultivation. It’s impossible to improve!” Xia ruofei said,”we have time today. We can practice together.”

Ling Qingxue was slightly tempted, but she quickly said,””Not today, let’s wait for uncle song to get better! When the time comes, we’ll call Wei Wei along and we’ll all cultivate together!”

Xia ruofei was helpless. When they were in the capital, Song Wei did not want to meet him alone. If song Qiming had not met with an accident, Song Wei would not have contacted him. After returning to the three mountains, Ling Qingxue’s attitude was the same.

Could it be that in the future, they would have to maintain such a strange ‘threesome’ group? Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and muttered in his heart.

Although many men would be envious of Xia ruofei, they did not know how hard it was for Xia ruofei to be in this situation ...

“Alright then!” Xia ruofei said helplessly. Then, he pushed the door open and got out of the car. “Be careful on the road!”

Ling Qingxue’s eyes flashed with a hint of struggle, but in the end, she nodded and said,””I know! Hurry up and go in!”

“I want to see you off before I enter the house!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Childish!” Ling Qingxue glared at Xia ruofei and said.

However, she still waved at Xia ruofei, stepped on the accelerator, and drove away from Xia ruofei’s house.

As Ling Qingxue drove, she saw Xia ruofei standing at the entrance of the villa and looking around through the rearview mirror. He looked a little lonely. She couldn’t bear to see him like this, and suddenly felt that she had gone a little too far ...

However, she thought about it and said to herself,””I’ve already told Wei Wei, I can’t be soft – hearted! This fellow is too detestable, he must be taught a lesson ...”

Poor Xia ruofei did not know that Ling Qingxue and Song Wei had been keeping a distance from him. It was all planned by them. He watched as Ling Qingxue’s car turned and disappeared from his sight. Then, he shook his head with a bitter smile and turned to walk into the villa.

Xia ruofei went straight to his bedroom and quickly scanned his surroundings with his mental power. Then, he locked the door and windows, took out the spirit map scroll from his body, and entered the space with a thought.

“Master!” Xia Qing immediately came up to him.

“Are you all ready?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Everything is ready!” Xia Qing said.

Xia ruofei nodded and brought Xia Qing to the Archean realm.

Xia Qing had already transplanted the heart – condensing grass to the side of the pool and set up a spirit – gathering formation around it. At the same time, she had embedded seven or eight spirit crystals on the nodes of the formation.

Xia Qing looked at the spirit crystals in the array and still felt that it was a pity. She felt that this kind of behavior was really too wasteful.

However, Xia ruofei had made his decision. As a loyal soul puppet, Xia Qing couldn’t possibly object. He said,””Master, please set up a time formation and activate this spirit gathering formation!”
