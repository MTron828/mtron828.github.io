Translator: 549690339

Lu You took a sip of tea and said,””It’s nothing much, I’m just too bored staying at my residence, so I’m definitely going to listen to sect leader Chen’s lecture. And didn’t sect leader Chen say that he would give everyone an opportunity? So, I’m sure I won’t be back so soon … I don’t know anyone here, and 1 think you’re the only one I’m familiar with …”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you’re always welcome here!” Moreover, this time sect leader Chen has given everyone a good opportunity. It’s definitely worth it for you to wait a few more days!”

“You’re right.” Lu You smiled and said,”in that case, you know what the opportunity sect leader Chen gave everyone is?”

“I know a little!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”but we’ll wait for sect leader Chen to announce this! It wouldn’t be good if I spoiled it in advance.”

“MMH! 1 won’t ask about it, I’ll know in two days anyway.” Lu You smiled and said,”it seems like teacher was right. You and sect leader Chen are really close!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””We’re considered friends who hit it off quite well, and our characters and tempers are quite compatible.”

“Their cultivation levels are about the same, right?” Lu You looked at Xia ruofei with a half – Smile and said,”Xia ‘senior’! I didn’t say anything wrong, right?”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment and muttered in his heart,”Did Shen Hu tell Lu You? Isn’t this guy a little too unreliable?

However, he couldn’t rule out the possibility that Lu You was trying to trick him. Hence, even though he was a little flustered, he maintained a calm expression on his face. He smiled and said in a relaxed manner,””How come 1 don’t understand what you’re saying? What’s this ‘senior Xia’? We’ve always been friends of the same generation! Besides, how can my cultivation compare to brother Chen Xuan’s?”

Lu You pouted and said,”still not admitting it?” What sect leader Chen said on the high platform today was already very obvious …”

“What did he say today?” Xia ruofei was confused.

He thought to himself, so I wronged Shen Hu just now? It can’t be? Sect leader Chen didn’t say anything today! How could Lu You be so sure that my cultivation level is similar to Chen Xuan’s?

“I won’t repeat the details,” Lu You said.”But the meaning between the lines is very clear. RUO Fei, you’ve already become a golden core cultivator, right?”

“I don’t know how you came to such a conclusion …” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and shrugged. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Lu You had an indifferent expression and said,””You’re such a boring person. It’s fine if you don’t want to admit it, I’m just asking…”

“No…” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”What do you mean by acknowledging it or not? I…”

“Ruofei, I’m just asking.” Lu You smiled and said,”l won’t force you to say it even if you don’t want to. But…”

At this point, Lu You said meaningfully,””! don’t think any Jindan cultivator should be a nobody in the cultivation world. The cultivators present today may not have seen you, but they must have heard of your name. How about… I go out and ask a few people if they have heard of you?”

“Don’t, don’t, don’t…” Xia ruofei waved his hand and smiled bitterly.”There’s no need for that. Since you want to know, I’ll tell you. I’ve indeed broken through to the Golden core stage. But… You’ve never asked me before!”

When Xia ruofei heard Lu You’s words, he knew that he could no longer hide his cultivation. If Lu You really did as she said and asked the cultivators who attended the ceremony today, there was a high chance that he would get the answer directly.

Therefore, he might as well be a Bachelor and admit it.

When Lu You heard Xia ruofei’s words, there was a huge wave in her heart.

Xia ruofei was really in the Golden core stage!

That… That golden core stage senior who did not show up that night was most likely Xia ruofei.

Lu You was unknown in the cultivation world. She knew that her talent was actually above average. How could there be such a coincidence that a golden core cultivator happened to pass by and thought highly of her? not only did he help her out of her predicament, but he also gave her precious array techniques and spirit crystals.

If that golden core senior was Xia ruofei, then everything could be explained.

Hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Lu You couldn’t help but roll her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,””Before I saw you yesterday, I didn’t even know that you’ve also embarked on the path of cultivation. How could I ask you this?”

“That’s true!” Xia ruofei scratched his head in embarrassment.

In fact, it was not a top secret that his cultivation had reached the Golden core stage. Even if Lu You knew about it, it would not be a big deal.

However, Xia ruofei really did not want Lu You to know that he was the ‘golden core stage senior’ who had helped her out the other day.

Fortunately, Lu You did not seem to associate Xia ruofei with the ‘golden core’ senior. She did not dwell on this topic either. After talking about Xia ruofei’s cultivation, she started to chat casually.

Xia ruofei also heaved a sigh of relief.

After the two of them drank tea for a while, Lu You stood up and said with a smile,””I should go back now. Otherwise, I won’t be able to bear the blame if teacher blames me…”

Xia ruofei also stood up and laughed.”Alright! Then I’ll send you off!”

The two of them stood up from the stone table and stone bench, and walked out of the courtyard side by side.

“Lu You, I’ll send you off here.” Xia ruofei said,”we were running around on the way back. This is someone else’s territory. It’s easy to break the rules if we’re not careful..”
