“Yes!” Zheng Yongshou said.

After the two of them alighted, Xia ruofei immediately took out the blue travel immortal sword and grabbed Zheng Yongshou onto the flying sword. He then silently activated the sword Art. Suddenly, a sword light streaked across the night sky, and in the blink of an eye, the two of them had arrived above the Paradise Farm.

Now that the expansion of Tao Yuan farm had been completed, it was basically connected to the pharmaceutical factory branch.

Xia ruofei could see that the factory was still producing, but not all production lines were running. It was probably due to the shortage of raw materials. On the other hand, the farm was relatively quiet. Now that the peach blossom company was providing rental subsidies to young employees, basically no one lived on the farm. Everyone had rented a house near the peach blossom building, so it would be more convenient to travel to and from work.

Therefore, at night, there was basically no one on the farm other than the staff on duty.

Xia ruofei brought Zheng Yongshou to all the locations, including the two water towers and the water tower at the farm. He even demonstrated adding the petal solution of the spirit Heart Flower to the water.

Then he took Zheng Yongshou around the whole farm and Orchard, letting him familiarize himself with the environment.

After all, when Zheng Yongshou came over to add the spirit Heart Flower petal solution in the future, he had to avoid the patrol team and other people’s ears and eyes, so it was also very important to be familiar with the environment.

Xia ruofei had a small villa near the farm. Even though he had not been there for a long time, the place was still cleaned regularly.

However, Xia ruofei did not go home today. He did not want the lights in the villa to attract the attention of the patrols.

After taking Zheng Yongshou around, he directly left Taoyuan farm on his flying sword and came to the parking lot.

As he lowered the flying sword, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but look back at the farm under the streetlight. This was the place where he started his career and had many good memories. If there were no special circumstances in the future, he probably wouldn’t come back here again, so he was more or less reluctant to part with it.

Xia ruofei looked back at the farm for a moment, then descended the flying sword and kept it.

Zheng Yongshou wasn’t particularly used to this kind of high – speed sword riding, so when he just landed on the ground, his face was a bit pale, and his steps seemed a bit unsteady.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”no way?” His legs went soft! Hurry up and get in the car!”

“I’m sorry …” Zheng Yongshou’s face was pale, and he looked a little embarrassed.

After the two of them got into the car, Xia ruofei started the car and said,””Old Zheng, these are the tasks you need to complete. The handover of Chinese medicinal herbs and white wine, as well as the maintenance of the water source on the farm. In addition, there were Tea Green, Cordyceps, truffles, and so on. Those were all staged, only a few times a year. 1 won’t be introducing you guys to the wine factory. I’ll give you a call later and leave your contact information. You guys can just come and contact me when you take over.”

“I understand! Mr. Xia!” Zheng Yongshou said.

Xia ruofei continued,”regarding the petals of the spirit Heart Flower, I have to emphasize two points again. First, it must be kept absolutely confidential. If the news were to be leaked, it would be fine in the secular world. However, if the cultivators were to get the news, I’m afraid it would bring you great danger. The second thing is what 1 said last time, you can’t touch the petal solution with your hand, otherwise the medicinal properties will be completely absorbed by your body and the solution will lose its effect. You Must Remember This!”

“Alright! This subordinate will remember!” Zheng Yongshou said.

“Alright, that’s all 1 need to tell you. Let’s return to the city now!” Xia ruofei said,”if you have anything you don’t understand, you can call me anytime. You don’t have to worry about disturbing me. You must make sure that there are no mistakes in the work and there can’t be any mistakes!”

“Understood!” Zheng Yongshou said seriously,”! will definitely remember your teachings. If there is a mistake, 1 am willing to accept any punishment!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”alright, it’s getting late. I’ll send you straight to your residence. From now on, you have to learn all aspects of life, including clothing, food, accommodation, and transportation. You have to wear modern clothes from the secular world, go to restaurants to eat, use modern home appliances, public transportation, use taxi software, and so on. You have to learn everything as soon as possible!”

After Zheng Yongshou heard it, he couldn’t help but feel a bit of a headache, but he still immediately expressed his position: “Yes! 1 will master these skills as soon as possible, Mr. Xia!”

Xia ruofei drove back to the city. After asking for the specific address of Zheng Yongshou’s place of residence, he drove Zheng Yongshou to the entrance of the community before driving back to the jiangbin villa community. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Zheng Yi had put in a lot of thought into Zheng Yongshou’s arrangements. Zheng Yongshou’s residence was not far from Xia ruofei’s house. A few minutes later, Xia ruofei had already driven into the jiangbin villa community.

As soon as he parked the car, he felt a slight breathing sound in the house. His expression changed slightly, and he instantly scanned the villa with his spirit power.

Then, Xia ruofei’s body relaxed and he smiled.

He opened the villa’s door and walked into the house. He saw Ling Qingxue half lying on the living room sofa and playing with her phone. Xia ruofei was changing his shoes as he smiled and said,””Wife, why didn’t you tell me you were coming? You didn’t even turn on the lights, 1 thought there was a thief in the house!”

Ling Qingxue turned to look at Xia ruofei and said with a smile,””Which little thief has the guts to come to your house and steal?”

“That’s hard to say. The little thief wouldn’t know that there’s an intermediate Aurous core stage cultivator living here!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

He walked to Ling Qingxue’s side and sat down.””What were you looking at just now? Then the pericelestial…”

“I’m chatting with Weiwei!” Ling Qingxue said,”Oh right, Weiwei said that things at the school are almost settled. If there are no accidents, she will be back tomorrow.. You have to work hard to make a trip to the capital tomorrow!”
