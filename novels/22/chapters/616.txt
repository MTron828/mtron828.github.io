Chapter 617: Doctor Xia makes another move (1)

At the mayor – Peace airport in San Shan.

After Tian Huixin, who was dressed in a noble and elegant manner, finished her call, Huan Huan, who was as cute as a porcelain doll, immediately asked,””Mother! What did brother Xia say?”

Tian Huixin smiled and touched Huanhuan’s tender little face. She said,””Big brother told us to settle down in the city first, and he’ll come over to meet us ...”

“But I want to go to the farm!” Huanhuan pouted and said,”brother Xia invited me to the farm to pick blueberries and lychees ... I want to eat lychees!”

“Lychees only ripen in summer!” Tian Huixin said with a smile. You can’t eat it even if you go now! Huanhuan, do you want to eat lychees or brother Xia?”

“Of course, I want to see brother Xia more!” Huan Huan said without hesitation.

Although they had not seen each other for a long time, Huan Huan’s closeness to Xia ruofei did not decrease at all. This made Tian Huixin, who was Huan Huan’s mother, feel a little sour.

However, Huanhuan’s illness was cured by Xia ruofei. If not for Xia ruofei, Huanhuan would still be that starry – eyed child who was immersed in her own world and did not say a word!

The parents of autistic children could understand the endless pain the most. Every day, they would see their child alone, no matter how they called her, she would not respond, and from time to time, she would lose her temper without any warning, while their children of the same age were enjoying the joy of their parents. That kind of feeling was really indescribable.

Hence, Tian Huixin was more grateful to Xia ruofei. She was not really jealous of her daughter being close to Xia ruofei.

Tian Huixin squatted down and smiled at Huanhuan.””Isn’t that good enough? Brother Xia asked you to wait for him in the city, he’ll be here to meet you soon, okay?”

Huan Huan tilted her head and thought for a while before she said,”Alright! I know ... Brother Xia wants to treat Chengcheng first, then play with me!”

“Mm! Huanhuan is so sensible!” Tian Huixin said.

......

Next to Tian Huixin was a Haggard – looking young woman in her thirties. When she saw Huan Huan acting coquettishly and talking to Tian Huixin, she could not help but reveal an extremely envious look in her eyes.

Once upon a time, Tian Huixin was just like her. Every day, she would take her child to various rehabilitation institutions, bring her child through perception training, mind games, and watch her child go through those tough training days. However, the effects were minimal, and her spirit was on the verge of collapse. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Now, Huanhuan seemed to have become a different person. She was lively and cheerful. There was no trace of the autistic girl from before.

But her child was still a person with severe autism. Up until now, he couldn’t even say “mom”. No matter how hard the teacher tried, the child could only make a vague sound similar to “mom.”

The child was right beside her, squatting on the ground and staring at an ant. He had been in this position for a long time ...

Tian Huixin picked up Huan Huan and smiled.””Biyun, I’ll help you find a place to stay first. Xiao Xia will meet us in the city in a moment!”

“Thank you, sister Tian!” Xue bi Yun gratefully said.

Xue bi Yun did not speak Cantonese, but rather Mandarin with a Sanshan accent.

In fact, Xue Biyun’s family was from San Shan. She and Tian Huixin had also married into Hong Kong.

It was because of this that the two met in a rehabilitation institution. When they chatted, they found out that they were from the same hometown and had the same experience in a different place. That was why the two became closer and slowly became very good friends.

However, Xue bi Yun wasn’t as lucky as Tian Hui Xin. The Hong Kong man she married treated her quite well at first, especially after Xue bi Yun gave birth to a son for him.

However, when little Chengcheng grew up, he couldn’t speak and was finally diagnosed with severe autism and epilepsy in the hospital, Xue bi Yun’s Hong Kong husband’s attitude changed greatly.

He would often come home drunk, beating and scolding Xue bi Yun and her son.

Especially when Chengcheng lost his temper or screamed at home, Xue bi Yun’s Hong Kong husband would be very impatient and even beat the child up.

Chengcheng originally had social barriers and had an instinctive fear of communicating with people. After being abused by his father, he became even more isolated and his condition became more serious.

It was often Xue bi Yun who painstakingly took care of the child for a long period of rehabilitation training, and when the child’s condition finally showed a little improvement, he would return home to be beaten and scolded by his drunkard husband, and the child would immediately seal himself off in his own world.

In the end, Xue bi Yun couldn’t take it anymore and chose to divorce her husband. Under the circumstances where her husband’s family deliberately made things difficult for her, Xue bi Yun left the marriage with almost nothing. She accepted all kinds of unreasonable requests from her husband’s family, the only request was that the child would be raised by her.

Chengcheng had always been a burden in Xue bi Yun’s husband’s family, so if Xue bi Yun was willing to take him away, they would naturally be more than happy to oblige.

Just like that, the mother and son left the nightmare – like home.

Fortunately, Xue bi Yun had obtained the right to stay in Hong Kong. Her son was also born in Hong Kong, so he could enjoy welfare relief. Moreover, children with autism could enjoy free rehabilitation training in Hong Kong. Tian Huixin would also help the mother and son from time to time and enthusiastically introduce her to part – time jobs. She couldn’t work full – time and had to take care of the child.
