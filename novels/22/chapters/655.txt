Chapter 656: Kun fish cultivation (2)

Xia ruofei was very patient and did not mind.

No matter what the result was, as long as there was an improvement, even if it was just one more petal, it was still a profit.

……

On the 19th day, manager li led the construction team to work overtime and finally completed the transformation construction of the Pomfret cultivation workshop in advance.

When Xia ruofei found out about this, he was surprised.

However, when he thought about how the workers had been working non – stop for the past half a month, Xia ruofei felt that it was reasonable to finish the work ahead of time.

Xia ruofei, who had received the news, immediately called Feng Rao and went to the kun fish breeding workshop.

Jiang Hua and manager li were already waiting there.

“President Xia, President Feng!” The two of them came forward and greeted him respectfully.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you’ve all worked hard these days!” Manager Li, I heard from Jiang Hua that you haven’t been home for more than half a month. I’ve really troubled you. ”

“President Xia, our President Liang has given a strict order. If the construction is delayed by one day, I, as the manager, will be kicked out!” Manager li smiled and said,”that’s why I didn’t dare to slack off for even a second!”

“Hahaha! “No, no...” Xia ruofei laughed.

“President Xia, President Feng, please take a look at the workshop!” Jiang Hua came forward and said.

......

“Good! Let’s go take a look!”

Under Jiang Hua and manager Li’s guidance, Xia ruofei and Feng Jing walked into the pomfrets breeding workshop.

The entire cultivation area covered an area of about one and a half mu, and it was completely enclosed with a greenhouse structure. There were 40 to 50 fish ponds of various sizes scattered according to their functions.

As soon as Xia ruofei entered the room, he felt that the environment was much quieter than outside, and the air seemed fresher.

“Mr. Xia, Mr. Feng, we’ve used the best sound – absorbing materials in our farm, and the air purification system imported from Germany has been installed in the greenhouse. It’s from the same manufacturer as the water purification and circulation system, and the quality is excellent!” Jiang Hua explained.

There was a hint of pride in Jiang Hua’s words. These two sets of equipment were definitely the best in the domestic farm.

This was only due to the coordination of various parties in the jianda group. The Germany manufacturers had only transferred the goods from the Huaxia region at the last minute. If they had been imported directly from Germany, 19 days would not have been enough.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.”It’s indeed not bad. You get what you pay for!”

As they came to the side of the blue fish ponds, Jiang Hua continued to introduce,””Mr. Xia, Mr. Feng, these fish ponds were specially designed to separate the pomfrets of different growth stages. The purified water here is not static. We have installed an intelligent system to simulate the Yangtze River’s water flow, so the pomfrets can adapt to the environment quickly!”

“CEO Feng, it seems like there are many tricks in this!” Xia ruofei turned to Feng Rao and said.

“Yup! Chairman, professional matters should be left to the professionals! You made the right decision by recruiting Jiang Hua into the company!” Feng Rao said with a smile.

Jiang Hua chuckled in embarrassment.

As they continued to walk forward, they came to a small room with a glass wall. The lights were bright inside, and several screens were placed neatly side by side on the table. Some of them were monitoring the inside and outside of the cultivation area, while some were some real – time rolling data.

“It looks like it’s very high – tech!” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”Jianghua, what’s this for?”

“Director Xia, this is the brain Center of our entire cultivation workshop!” Jiang Hua smiled and said,”this set of surveillance system was used by the factory I used to work in. This time, I directly bought one from a partner company!”

Jiang Hua pointed to the screen and continued,”this set of monitoring equipment can clearly reflect the situation of the entire breeding area, including various indicators such as oxygen content, Ph, water temperature, and so on. At the same time, my mobile phone can receive the corresponding information, so that it is convenient to observe the changes in the pool in time and make adjustments in time to ensure the growth environment of the fish.”

Jiang Hua said as he took out his phone. He opened the APP that came with the surveillance system and demonstrated it to Xia ruofei.

“Whether I’m in the breeding workshop or not, as long as the indicator in the fish pond is abnormal, my phone will receive an alert in time.” Jiang Hua said.

“Not bad, not bad!” Xia ruofei said sincerely,”Jiang Hua, you’ve put in a lot of effort to perfect the entire workshop in such a short time!”

After Xia ruofei finished speaking, he turned to Feng Jing and said,””Director Feng, Jiang Hua has done a great job. Shouldn’t we give him a bonus?”

“You’re the boss, so you have the final say!”Feng Jing laughed.

Xia ruofei laughed.”That’s good. Inform pang Hao later that he will give Jiang Hua a double salary this month as a form of encouragement!”

Jiang Hua was surprised, but he still said humbly,””President Xia, this is part of my job. There’s no need to give me a bonus!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Merits will be rewarded, mistakes will be punished!” Xia ruofei did not give him any room to explain.”This has always been the case at paradise Corporation. We will never let the employees who have put in so much effort and dedicated themselves to the company suffer! This matter is settled ...”

“Then ... Thank you, President Xia!” Jiang Hua said.

“Hahaha! No need to thank me, this is what you deserve!” Xia ruofei patted Jiang Hua’s shoulder and said,”you have the skills and management experience. Just stay in our company. As long as you put your heart and soul into your work, you will get better and better treatment in the future!”
