2762 An unexpected reunion (2)

Xia ruofei nodded and asked in a low voice,””Have you picked up the person?”

“Mm! He’s already in the canteen!” Lei Hu replied.

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said. He then asked,”where’s the wine? Are you all ready?”

“Don’t worry! Brother Xia! Ensure that we have sufficient ammunition!” Lei Hu laughed and said,”I personally went to the winery’s warehouse to get it. You’re really respected! There are a lot of cars there waiting to be loaded. I heard that some of them have been waiting for two or three days. When I went over, they immediately gave me the wine first!”

The sales of the Drunken Eight Immortals wine had been increasing in popularity for the past two years. The most idle job at the winery was the sales post. There was no need to go out to find sales channels at all. The products were always in short supply. It was very common for some to wait for several days at the winery in order to get a batch of goods. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”of course!” I’m a shareholder of the winery! Do I have to line up to get some wine? Besides, we won’t be taking it for free! There’s also money, okay?”

Xia ruofei had only informed the winery, and Lei Hu had bought the goods under the name of the Paradise Corporation. He had also settled the bill under the company’s name. Of course, to Xia ruofei, this was just a matter of using his left hand to replace his right hand.

“That manager wanted it to be free of charge. Are we the kind of people who take advantage of others?” Lei Hu chuckled. She directly stuffed the check into his arms!”

Xia ruofei laughed and scolded,”Alright, alright! Don’t get too cocky, kid! Hurry up and go to the cafeteria!”

“Yes!” Lei Hu said.

This time, Xu Yougang had brought along many of Lei Hu’s old comrades. He was also quite excited today, even Walking with the Wind.

“My comrades!” Xia ruofei shouted. The canteen has already prepared the food. Everyone, go to the canteen and chat while eating! I’ve prepared a little wine today. It’s been a long time since we’ve reunited, so let’s get drunk tonight!”

“Good! We won’t leave until we’re drunk!”

“I’ve never been a coward when I drink! I’m going all out with this hundred Jin!”

“Hahaha! Old Yan, when did you ever drink more than me in the Army?”

“Who doesn’t know how to brag? We’ll see who’s the real deal at the table!”

“You have backbone! Then we’ll wait and see!”

……

The ex – soldiers followed Xia ruofei to the canteen excitedly.

Just as everyone lifted the curtain and walked into the canteen, they saw two people coming up to them. Ma Jia was talking to Xia ruofei, but when she saw who it was, she couldn’t help but freeze.

These two people were monitor old Luo’s widow, Lin Yue ‘e, and their daughter, Nan Nan. After monitor old Luo passed away, Xia ruofei had specially made a trip to the monitor’s hometown to persuade Lin Yue’ e to work in his company. At the same time, he had also arranged for Nan Nan to study at San Shan.

Ma Jia looked very surprised and said after a long time,””Sister – in – Law? What are you doing here?”

“Company commander MA, long time no see!” Lin Yue ‘e said with a smile.

Squad leader old Luo had a lot of experience in the lone wolf assault team. Many of the Veterans who had come to work in Xia ruofei’s Peach Blossom Island guard were soldiers he had led before, so they were more familiar with Lin Yue ‘e. When they first saw Lin Yue ‘e, they were also very surprised. When they regained their senses, they all came forward to greet her.

“Sister – in – Law!”

“Good day, sister – in – Law!”

“Sister – in – Law, how have you been these past two years? We’ve all missed you!”

Lin Yue’ e smiled and said,” I’m very good!” I’m so happy to see you guys today! Little Xiao, little li ... You’re little Wang, right? I haven’t seen you for a few years and you seem to have grown taller!”

The veteran named Wang zhihang by Lin Yue’ e said with a bitter expression, ” “Sister-in-law, when you call’ Xiao Wang’, can you not add the word’ right’? ”

The seasoned soldiers instantly roared with laughter. Lin Yue’ e was stunned for a moment before she reacted. She couldn’t help but purse her lips and smile, saying, ” “It’s my fault! Little Wang, long time no see!”

Ma Jia separated the crowd and said,” sister-in-law, you still haven’t told me why you’re here!” We all thought you were in your hometown!”

Only Wolf King Guo Zhan knew that Xia ruofei had arranged a job for Lin Yue’ e. This was also something that Guo Zhan had asked Xia ruofei to do. Xia ruofei had not spread the news, so Ma Jia and the others naturally had no idea. That was why Ma Jia was so surprised when he saw Lin Yue’ e.

Lin Yue’ e looked at Xia ruofei and said, ” “I’ve been in the three mountains for the past two years! And he was working in RUO Fei’s company! RUO Fei had even arranged for Nan Nan to enter the best primary school in the three mountains ... Nan Nan, why are you hiding behind? Hurry up and call for help! This is uncle MA and this is uncle Xiao. When I went to the Army, they always gave you delicious food. Have you forgotten? ”

Seeing that so many people were looking at her, Nan Nan could not help but feel a little shy. She kept hiding behind Xia ruofei. Although Xia ruofei did not spend much time at the three mountains, he seemed to have a high natural affinity with the children.

“Sister-in-law, it’s fine!” Xia ruofei laughed and said, ” maybe it’s because we haven’t seen each other for a long time. The child is a little shy. He’ll be fine in a few days! ”

MA Zhang was still digesting Lin Yue’ E’s words. After a while, he came back to his senses and looked at Xia ruofei with a complicated expression. ” ” Ruofei, I didn’t expect you to do so much for the old class monitor ... In fact, we also want to do something for the class monitor, but we don’t have the strength ... Ruofei, thank you! ”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,” no, no, no!” Old company commander, you’re being too serious ... Back then, I was brought up by old squad leader Luo. If it were in the past, he would be my master! It’s my duty to do something for the class monitor to the best of my ability!”

When ma su saw Lin Yue’ E’s state, he knew that she had already walked out of the grief of old Luo’s sacrifice. She was living very well in the three mountains, and her entire person was filled with a healthy and positive aura. This made him feel even more emotional.

The way the other veterans looked at Xia ruofei changed.

Xia ruofei’s act of helping Lin Yue’ E’s family had greatly improved his image in the hearts of the Veterans.

Xia ruofei felt a little uncomfortable under everyone’s gaze and quickly said, ” “Don’t just stare! Find your own seat and sit down! It’s getting dark, hurry up and start scrubbing! Old company commander, sister-in-law, you two sit here!”

Xia ruofei beckoned the Veterans to take their seats.

Lin Yue ‘e also smiled and said,’ everyone, find a seat! There’s a dish I made myself tonight! It’s a welcome for our comrades!”

“That’s great! I haven’t tasted sister-in-law’s cooking for years!”

“Let’s all guess which dish sister – in – Law made, okay?”

“I think it’s possible! If you’re wrong, you’ll have to drink three cups of wine as punishment!”

“It’s decided then!”

The seasoned soldiers responded noisily and found a place to sit down.

Although there was no clear division of ranks, everyone would find their more familiar comrades to sit at the same table. For example, Xu Yougang and his group of veterans were concentrated at two of the tables.

Xia ruofei, Ma Jia, Lin Yue ‘e, and a few others who had been in lone wolf for a long time sat together.

Cao tieshu’s wife brought the staff of the canteen and quickly served the dishes.

Lei Hu, on the other hand, took out all the liquor that he had brought from the winery’s warehouse today. They were all from drunken eight immortal’s white liquor production team, and they generally liked to drink white liquor.

There were 15 boxes of wine and 90 bottles in total. If they finished all of them, each person would have nearly two bottles on average.

“My comrades! Eat to your heart’s content! Drink as much as you want!” Xia ruofei stood up and raised his voice.”If there’s not enough wine, I still have a lot at home. If you can finish it, we’ll finish it all tonight!”

...

“Alright!” The seasoned soldiers responded loudly.

Even the horse Deputy was very active in responding to the ban on drinking in the Army, but it was allowed to drink during the holiday, so it was not against the rules.

Moreover, even if it was a little against the rules, Ma Jia would definitely not be a killjoy on such an occasion. He would drink when he had to.

Xia ruofei took a bottle of Drunken Eight Immortals from Lei Hu and filled it up with wine.

Today, he didn’t use the thumb cup that was used to drink white wine, but a small glass that was used to drink beer in the South. One glass was about two taels.

Xia ruofei raised his glass high and said with a smile,””My comrades! All of you, fill up the wine! The first glass of wine, for our reunion, cheers!”
