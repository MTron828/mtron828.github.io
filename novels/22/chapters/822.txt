Lin Yue ‘e was stunned for a moment before she replied,””Ruofei, I appreciate your kind intentions, but ...”

“Sister – in – Law, don’t be in such a hurry to reject me. Let me finish.” Xia ruofei said,”sister – in – Law, even if you don’t think for yourself, you should think for the child, right? Do you have the heart to let Nan Nan live a bitter life with you? Also, squad leader Luo only told you not to cause trouble for the organization, but I’m not representing the organization. I’m just a private company boss now. Besides, I’m not giving you money, I’m just providing you a job. Isn’t it natural for you to work in exchange for remuneration?”

Lin Yue ‘E’s mouth moved, but she didn’t say anything.

She knew that what Xia ruofei said made sense and it was impossible for her to not be tempted. After all, Xia ruofei had mentioned Nan Nan again. However, she always felt that there was a barrier in her heart. Although Xia ruofei emphasized that this was not charity or financial aid, and that he was only giving her a position to support herself, she knew that the nature was similar. The position that Xia ruofei gave her would not be tiring at all, and she would even be paid very well.

In Lin Yue ‘E’s eyes, this was no different from giving her money.

Seeing this, Xia ruofei continued to persuade,””Sister – in – Law, I can guarantee that I won’t give you a single cent more. You’ll be treated the same as the other employees. Besides ... You should also consider uncle Luo’s situation!”

“My father – in – Law?” Lin Yue ‘e asked in puzzlement.

She then remembered that they were talking about her father – in – Law. It was Xia ruofei who had suddenly changed the topic. Now that Xia ruofei had mentioned her father – in – Law, she naturally attracted her attention.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”first of all, uncle Luo’s physical condition is not very good. Although I’m confident that I can cure him, the process may take a long time. It’s not realistic for me to stay here for a long time to treat uncle Luo’s illness. After all, the company can’t do without me. So, it’s best for you to bring uncle Luo to the three mountains and work while treating his illness. Besides ...”

At this point, Xia ruofei paused for a moment and looked at Lin Yue ‘E’s expression before he continued,””As you can see, uncle Luo’s mental state is not very good now. If he continues to stay in his hometown, he will inevitably be reminded of the scene. “My company in Sanshan city is in my own farm. The environment is definitely very good, and the entire security team in my company is made up of retired soldiers. Uncle Luo should have a lot in common with them when he gets there.”

Xia ruofei already knew that squad leader Luo’s father used to be a soldier in the 1960s and 1970s. He had always had a deep relationship with the Army. Squad leader Luo had joined the Army under his father’s influence and finally grew into a Soldier King. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The more Lin Yue ‘e listened, the more moved she became. Her heart was also constantly wavering from left to right.

Xia ruofei added fuel to the fire,””Sister – in – Law, there’s also Nan Nan’s problem. Nan Nan should be in the first grade soon, right? The education conditions here are not very good, but I have some connections in Sanshan city. After Nan Nan goes over, I promise to coordinate the best primary schools in the city for her and give her the best environment to grow up in!”

Lin Yue ‘e bitterly smiled and said,””Ruofei, I really can’t make a decision at the moment. Besides, this is not a small matter. I still have to listen to my father – in – Law and sister-in-law’s opinions ...”

“I understand!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”sister – in – Law, I hope you will consider my suggestion carefully!”

“I will!” Lin Yue ‘e nodded her head heavily. Then, she said sincerely,”RUO Fei, thank you so much for making a special trip just for our matter.”

“Sister – in – Law, squad leader Luo is my old squad leader and brother. The soldiers of lone wolf are like brothers. You must not treat me like an outsider.” Xia ruofei said,”sister – in – Law, I’ll stay here tonight and treat uncle Luo again tomorrow. His condition should be stable for the time being.”

“Alright, then I’ll leave it to you, ruofei ...” Lin Yue ‘e said. She then thought for a moment before continuing,”then you’ll stay in this house tonight. It’s just that the house is a mess right now, so you might not be able to rest well ...”

Squad leader Luo’s mother was going to be buried tomorrow. According to the local customs, they had to stay up all night. After a while, the Daoist priest would chant Scriptures, the musicians would play the suona, and the family members would also have some worship ceremonies. This was called a “funeral.”

“Sister – in – Law, you can’t do that!” Xia ruofei said. There are only two rooms here. If I sleep here, you won’t have a place to rest. You can lay a bed on the floor in uncle Luo’s room. If he doesn’t feel well at night, I can take care of him. ”

Lin Yue ‘e said,”there’s no need, there’s no need. My sister – in – Law and I definitely won’t be able to sleep tonight. There’s a funeral here that will take an entire night. There are many ceremonies that we need to attend.” You can rest in this room. If anything happens to my father – in – Law, you can just walk a few steps over. There’s no delay!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”okay!” Sister – in – Law, call me if you need anything!”

“Alright!” Lin Yue ‘e smiled and nodded.”Oh right, you haven’t had dinner, right?” I’ll go get you something to eat!”

“Sister – in – Law, don’t worry about dinner!” Xia ruofei said seriously,”I want to ask about the reporter ...”

Lin Yue ‘E’s expression changed slightly as she said,””Ruofei, don’t bother about the reporter. He’s from the province and has a strong background! Don’t get into any trouble!”

“Sister – in – Law ...”

“Ruofei, don’t say anymore. Let’s not talk about this anymore!” Lin Yue ‘e said decisively,”listen to sister – in – Law. Don’t bother yourself with this matter!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei shrugged.

Of course, he couldn’t just ignore it. Even if Lin Yue ‘e refused to tell him, he still had his ways of finding out the situation. After all, many people had seen it that day. However, in order not to worry Lin Yue’ e, Xia ruofei had to compromise.

Lin Yue ‘e nodded and said,””Ruofei, you can rest here for a while. Sister – in – Law will go get you something to eat!”

“Alright, thank you for your hard work, sister – in – Law!”

Lin Yue ‘e went to the kitchen outside to cook a bowl of noodles for Xia ruofei. She also added a few large pieces of pork trotters and duck meat to prepare for the funeral. These ingredients were all ready – made.

While Xia ruofei was eating his noodles, Lin Yue ‘e took out a clean blanket from the cabinet and changed into it. Then, she said to Xia ruofei,””RUO Fei, close the door and go to sleep after you’re done eating! Otherwise, it’ll be too noisy ...”

Xia ruofei said as he gobbled up the food,””I know, sister – in – Law, don’t worry about me. Go and do your work!”

Lin Yue ‘e did have many things to do, and Xia ruofei was not an outsider. Hence, she nodded and closed the door.

After Xia ruofei finished his noodles, he took the empty bowl and went out to wash it in the kitchen. Then, he went back to the central room to light three joss sticks for the old lady before returning to the west room.

That night, it was windy and noisy outside. Xia ruofei did not sleep well. He was basically in a state of half – Sleep. At Sixo’ clock, he was awakened by the sound of firecrackers. He got up and made his bed. Then, he took out the toiletries from his backpack and went out to wash his face.

There was a sink in the yard, where he usually washed his clothes and washed his face.

Xia ruofei went over to turn on the tap and used two handfuls of cold water to wash his face. He instantly felt much more awake.

Just as Xia ruofei had finished brushing his teeth and washing his face, tidied up his toiletries, and was about to enter the house, there was a sudden noise from outside.

“Stop him, don’t let him in! This evil spirit actually dared to come over! This is outrageous!” A rough voice called out.

Immediately after, Xia ruofei heard Lin Yue ‘E’s voice that was suppressing her anger,””What are you guys doing here? I don’t welcome you here! Please leave immediately!”

Then, a man with a quacking voice said with a hint of satisfaction,””We are reporters from the provincial television station. We have the right to interview, understand? Come on, turn on the machine and take a picture! Let’s see which of these unruly people dares to stop me! When the time comes, we’ll expose them all on television!”

Xia ruofei’s face turned cold when he heard the voice. He threw the basin on the sink and strode towards the door.
