Chapter 1491: Entering the underground palace (1)

Translator: 549690339

“Isn’t it too far?” Song Wei asked hesitantly.

This place was more than 200 meters away from the entrance where she first entered the tomb. Although the experts speculated that the tomb was large, Song Wei was not sure if they were still in the tomb.

After all, everything was just an expert’s speculation. Their investigation was forced to stop when it had just begun. No one knew how large the tomb was and how it was distributed.

Compared to Song Wei’s uncertainty, Xia ruofei was more confident.

Because at this position, the temperature of the Jade Leaf was still very high, which meant that the world stone was nearby. Without a doubt, this place was still within the range of the tomb.

“My instinct tells me that there should be some gains here!” Xia ruofei smiled.

“It’s intuition again ...”Song Wei was speechless.

“My intuition is quite accurate sometimes!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

The location was a depression and was further away from the patrolling security guards, so the two were much more relaxed than before.

“Then, does your intuition tell you how we should start?” Song Wei asked with a smile.

Xia ruofei stood up with a mysterious look on his face. He took a few steps around the area and stomped his feet. “We’ll dig in from here!”

“It’s that simple?”Song Wei was stunned.

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”what else?” Since it’s all about luck, why don’t you just trust my intuition?”

Song Wei was stunned for a while and said with a bitter smile,”Alright then!”

She was an archaeologist, and she was equally clueless when faced with a situation where there were almost no clues. Since Xia ruofei trusted his intuition so much, she might as well trust him this once. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be wandering around in the wilderness in the middle of the night!

The two of them took off their backpacks and put them aside. Song Wei took out a Luo Yang shovel from her bag and skillfully assembled them.

Xia ruofei stretched out his hand and smiled.””Leave this physical work to me!”

Song Wei did not stand on ceremony and passed the Luo Yang shovel to Xia ruofei.

In fact, this Luoyang shovel had two heads. The small head was mainly used to explore holes. It was used to retrieve the soil below and determine if there was a tomb below.

Xia ruofei started digging without a second word. Song Wei watched from the side and smiled,””Your movements are quite professional. Have you been to a tomb before?”

“Yup! And he even robbed a royal tomb!” Xia ruofei said without raising his head.

“You’re bragging!” Song Wei chuckled and said. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

After a while, Xia ruofei brought some soil up. Song Wei took the flashlight and looked at it carefully. She said in surprise,”There might really be a tomb down there!”

Then, Song Wei pointed at a piece of soil that Xia ruofei had brought up and said,””Look, this is an obvious characteristic of triple earth, and from its color, it was mixed with glutinous rice soup. This tomb is of very high standard!”

“Do you believe my intuition now?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

Song Wei chuckled and said,”it’s a blind cat that got lucky!” Besides, if we rashly dig down from here, it will be dangerous if the tomb room collapses, and we will really die!”

Tomb raiding was actually a physically heavy and high – risk profession. It was common to lose one’s life in the tomb if one was not careful.

In the archaeological excavations that Song Wei had participated in, she had seen bones lying in the tombs several times. These were basically the remains of grave robbers, who died from lack of oxygen or other unknown dangers. They could even have been killed by their accomplices because of uneven distribution of the loot.

Xia ruofei said,”we just need to be careful. This tomb is so big. If nothing goes wrong, it should be a complete underground Palace. It won’t collapse so easily.”

Song Wei nodded. She agreed with Xia ruofei and said,”Then ... Let’s try to dig down?”

“Of course!” Xia ruofei said.

He had already come this far, and he could feel that the Jade Leaf was constantly emitting a burning aura. No matter if there was any danger down there, Xia ruofei would definitely continue.

Song Wei did not say anything. She took out a bigger shovel and put it on. Then, she passed it to Xia ruofei silently.

This shovel head was specially used to dig holes, so it was much more useful than an ordinary shovel.

Of course, with the development of technology, many grave robbers were now using technological equipment, such as single – person backdrill machines and so on, which increased the efficiency.

Xia ruofei took the Luo Yang shovel and started digging at the spot where they had just dug.

He was very strong and had good stamina. In addition, he had been trained in digging for individual bunkers when he was in the Army. There was no problem with his skills, so his speed was naturally very fast.

After a short while, a round hole with a diameter of about 70 centimeters appeared.

Xia ruofei continued to dig deeper while Song Wei gave him a flashlight. The two of them had a clear division of labor.

After digging for about two meters, Xia ruofei was already in the cave. Song Wei was almost lying at the entrance of the cave, reaching out her hand to light up the cave for Xia ruofei.

The hole was not completely vertical. They had to dig straight down first. When they reached about half a meter deep, they would start to dig diagonally. Therefore, Song Wei’s flashlight was not very effective.

However, she felt that it wasn’t good for her to be idle. She always wanted to do something.
