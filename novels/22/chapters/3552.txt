3553 Incense and love (2)

Am I really a cultivation genius? Lu You couldn't help but feel apprehensive.¬†

Attendant Liu was extremely envious. When she saw Lu You's dazed look, she quickly said, "Lu You, why aren't you thanking the sect leader? From now on, you'll be the sect master's in - Name disciple!"

Deacon Liu's master was only an elder with a Qi refinement Level 7 in the sect. She was truly envious of Lu You being accepted as a disciple by Shen Hu, even though she knew that this was all because the mysterious golden core senior had casually greeted her.

Lu You came back to her senses and quickly said, ""Many thanks for sect leader's favor! Disciple will definitely work hard to cultivate and not let sect leader down!"

"Are you still going to call me sect master?" Shen Hu asked with a smile.

Lu You was slightly taken aback. Then, she immediately realized it and hurriedly changed her words. "Thank you, master!"

Shen Hu waved his hand with a smile,"you can call me teacher from now on!" After all, he's just an in- Name disciple, and it's more intimate to call him teacher!"

In the world of cultivation,'master' was usually a respectful form of address given to one's master by one's direct disciple. Why would Shen Hu not want to be Lu You's master? However, because of those concerns, he did not dare to take the risk. On the other hand, the term 'teacher' was much better. It wasn't as strong as a personal disciple 's, and at the same time, it had a layer of teacher - student relationship.

"Yes! Teacher!" Lu You said.

Shen Hu smiled and nodded. He thought, He hoped that Lu You would remember this favor in the future!TDG

He knew very well that with the help of a friend like Xia ruofei, Lu You's cultivation path would be much smoother in the future. She might even break through to the Golden core stage before him. By then, not only Shen Hu, but the entire water Yuan sect would have to rely on Lu You.

"Alright, I'm looking for you guys today mainly to talk about these things." Shen Hu waved his hand and said, "if there's nothing else, you guys go back and rest early! Get ready to return to England with me in the next two days."

"Yes! Sect leader!" Deacon Liu quickly replied.

Lu You hesitated for a moment and said, "Teacher, can I ... Can I go back a few days later? I've been studying abroad for a long time, and I just happened to return to Beijing for a mission. Can I stay with my family for a few days before leaving?"

Shen Hu chuckled and said, "sure!" You rest at home for a few days. When you return to England, remember to find me at the sect first. I'll announce to the whole sect that I've accepted you as an in- Name disciple!"

"Many thanks, teacher!" Lu You said happily.

"You must persist in your cultivation even at home. Don't use the sect's cultivation techniques from before. Just use the" water element Scripture "that golden core senior gave you to cultivate." In addition, if you have any doubts about your cultivation, you can come to the hotel to ask me before tomorrow afternoon. You can also call me at any time after I go back. You can also remember my private phone number in England ..."

Shen Hu then gave him a phone number.

The base of the water element sect was actually a large Manor in England. It was not located in the deep mountains or forests, and there was no particularly powerful protective array, so even inside the sect, mobile phones had signal. The water Yuan sect was basically using the technological equipment of the secular world.

Lu You quickly took out a piece of paper and a pencil from the drawer and quickly wrote down Shen Hu's phone number. She said,""Thank you, teacher! If I have any questions, I will ask you in time!"

"Mm! "Cultivation is actually the same as learning. What you know is what you know, and what you don't know is what you don't know. The most taboo thing about cultivation is to pretend to know. If you keep your doubts in your heart and force yourself to cultivate, it may lead to serious consequences!" Shen Hu said.

He thought for a moment and added, "however, that cultivation technique was passed on to you by a Jindan senior. Even if you ask me for advice, you must not reveal the contents of the cultivation technique. Do you understand?"

"But... How do I ask?" Lu You couldn't help but be dumbfounded.

"The" water elemental Scripture "in your hands is of the same origin as our sect's legacy technique. When you ask for guidance, just tell me your doubts and don't mention the technique's content. I can still answer your questions!" Shen Hu said with a smile.

"Understood!" Lu You said, "Thank you, teacher!"

Lu You came back to her senses and quickly said," "Many thanks for sect leader's favor! Disciple will definitely work hard to cultivate and not let sect leader down!" "Are you still going to call me sect master?" Shen Hu asked with a smile.
