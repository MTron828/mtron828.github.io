2183 Bai Qingqing (1)

“Who’s there!” Xia ruofei was so shocked that he almost knocked over the lid of the pot.

However, Xia ruofei quickly realized that the voice did not come from the outside world. It was a telepathic message.

He immediately realized that the sound was coming from the spirit map space. When he used his mind to check the space, his jaw almost dropped. The sound actually came from the White realm Fox.

To be more precise, it was no longer a white realmfox. After absorbing the light cocoon, the color of its fur had changed. At first glance, it was still white, but if one looked closely, one could see a trace of golden light in its white fur. Especially under the light, it was even more golden, looking very beautiful.

“RUO Fei, who are you talking to?” Ling Qingxue’s voice could be heard from the living room.

Ling Qingxue, who had already started on the path of cultivation, had better hearing than ordinary people. Even though the television in the living room was quite loud, she could still hear Xia ruofei’s voice.

“It’s nothing, I just received a harassment call ...”Xia ruofei quickly replied.

“Oh ...” Ling Qingxue said,”is lunch ready?” I’m a little hungry!”

“Immediately, immediately!” Xia ruofei said,”wife, if you’re really hungry, there’s an egg yolk pie on the coffee table. Eat first!” But don’t eat too much! Otherwise, I won’t be able to eat lunch!”

“I know!” Ling Qingxue said sweetly,”ruofei, thank you for your hard work!”

After dealing with Ling Qingxue, Xia ruofei immediately used telepathy to tell the white fox,””Little brat! You gave me a big scare! How come you can talk all of a sudden? Amazing!”

The White realmfox lazily laid on the grass, raised its front paw, and sent a message to Xia ruofei.””I don’t know either! After sleeping for a while, I woke up and realized that I could transmit my voice to you ... Great, I finally don’t have to make hand gestures anymore. You’re so stupid, you can’t understand a sentence even after making several hand gestures ...”

Xia ruofei’s face darkened.””What are you gesturing at? You still have the cheek to call me stupid?”

The White realmfox looked disdainful and said,””Xia ruofei, you’re so stupid! See how smart I am? I’ve learned your human language by sleeping!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”there’s nothing wrong with you saying that, but this should be your talent!” It doesn’t seem to have anything to do with your intelligence ...”

“You’re being unreasonable!” The White realmfox was not convinced.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”little guy, you’ve given me a big shock!” Right, since you can speak, then ... Can you also transform into a human like the legends say?”

The White realmfox’s face darkened and it said,””You refuse to admit that you’re stupid. I can only transmit my voice to you now, and I can’t use your human voice. As for transforming into a human, you’re really thinking too much ...”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. Then, he realized that the White boundary Fox’s joints were still intact, which meant that its body structure had not changed. In that case, its vocal cords could not make human sounds. No wonder it could only use telepathy.

The white fox revealed a proud expression and said,””However, according to my inherited memories, I can transform into a human after my cultivation improves a little more!”

“Wouldn’t that waste countless world stones?”Xia ruofei asked.

To be honest, Xia ruofei felt that the White realm Fox’s behavior was ridiculous. It only ate realm stones as food. Was it really a good idea to use such a rare resource as food?

The white fox immediately bared its teeth in dissatisfaction and said,””What do you mean by defiled? I think it’s a waste of a heavenly treasure to let your small space absorb the precious world stone!”

Fine! From the looks of it, everyone had the same opinion on the matter of the world stone’s value. They just felt that the other party was wasting world stones ...

Xia ruofei said,”fine, fine, fine. I won’t argue with you about this. Anyway, let’s work together in the future. If we find the world stone, we’ll split it 30 – 70!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Didn’t you say four to six last time?” The white fox immediately said.

“That’s under the condition that you make a contribution!” Xia ruofei said,”if it’s like what happened in the green touring immortal abode, I’d feel like I’ve lost out on a 30 – 70 split, okay?”

“You’re going back on your word!” The white fox was furious.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”I’ve already distributed it fairly. Ask yourself. How much effort did you put in the last time we searched for the realm stone?” Moreover, I’m already trapped in green travel Immortal Island. As long as I search seriously, I can still find that immortal mansion and those world stones. In other words, it’s the same whether you’re here or not, right?”

In fact, Xia ruofei was being a little unreasonable. If not for the White realm Fox’s super – long sensing distance, he might not have discovered the uniqueness of green travel Immortal Island and might have found a way to leave the immortal Island very quickly. If that happened, he would naturally miss the opportunity to obtain the realm stone.

Of course, there was a higher possibility that Xia ruofei would explore that Island. In that case, it was highly possible that he would eventually find the world stone on his own.

Seeing the white fox’s indignant look, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Alright, alright! “Since I’ve agreed, I’ll give you at least 30%. If your contribution is outstanding in the process of searching for the world stone, I’ll give you 40%. It’s even possible to split it evenly. Everything depends on how much you’ve contributed. I can guarantee you that I’ll definitely not go against my conscience and covet the world stone that should belong to you ...”
