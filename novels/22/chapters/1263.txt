Chapter 1264: Is it cruel or humane (2)

Translator: 549690339

“Are you Chairman MA and Mr. Xia?” The staff member asked loudly from afar.

“It’s US!” MA Xiong replied.

“I’m sorry, director Guo asked me to pick you two up!” The staff member came forward to greet the people maintaining order, then continued,”please follow me!”

MA Xiong and Xia ruofei looked at each other and quickly followed the staff into the field.

Four horses were involved in the accident. Horse No. 2 and the star of Hong Kong were in the worst situation. The other two horses were also injured because they couldn’t avoid the attack in time.

MA Xiong and Xia ruofei soon met Guo Hongjiang.

“Director Guo, how’s the situation? Are you alright?” MA Xiong immediately asked.

Guo Hongjiang’s expression did not look good. He frowned and said,””He’s been sent to the hospital. He’s not very lucky. He was hit when he fell to the ground. The doctor said it might be internal bleeding, but he’s still conscious. His life shouldn’t be in danger.”

MA Xiong looked at Xia ruofei subconsciously.

Xia ruofei shook his head discreetly when he heard Guo Hongjiang say that the rider’s life was not in danger.

MA Xiong immediately understood and did not mention Xia ruofei’s treatment.

Guo Hongjiang looked at Xia ruofei and said,””Mr. Xia, I’m sorry! I wanted to invite you here to have some fun, but I didn’t expect something like this to happen and cause you to lose money ...”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly,”director Guo, why are you still talking about that small amount of money?” It was just for entertainment! I’m not hoping to make a fortune from this ...”

Guo Hongjiang waved his hand and said,”yes, yes, yes. Let’s not talk about this ...”

MA Xiong noticed that Guo Hongjiang was not in a good mood, so he asked,””Director Guo, is the ‘star of Hong Kong’ not doing well?”

Guo Hongjiang’s face revealed a resentful expression as he said,””It’s all that hothead’s fault! Harm others and harm yourself!”

After cursing the rider of horse No. 2, Guo Hongjiang said sadly,””Preliminary examination ... It should be a fracture in the hind leg ... It was broken by horse No. 2!”

Xia ruofei heaved a sigh of relief. When he saw the scene in the private room, where the horse fell to the ground and kicked up a large cloud of dust, he thought that the “star of Hong Kong” would die on the spot! Now, it seemed that the situation was better than he had imagined. He only had a fracture in his hind leg.

However, Xia ruofei immediately felt that something was wrong.

This was because he saw MA Xiong’s expression change when he heard the results.

“How ... How could it be so serious?” MA Xiong mumbled.

Xia ruofei looked at MA Xiong and then at the dejected Guo Hongjiang. He asked curiously,””Mr. MA, if the star of Hong Kong only had a fracture in his hind leg, his life shouldn’t be in danger, right?”

MA Xiong sighed when he heard that. However, before he could speak, a staff member ran over in a hurry and whispered something to Guo Hongjiang.

Guo Hongjiang’s expression became even more dejected. He nodded and said,””I know!”

Then, Guo Hongjiang said to MA Xiong and Xia ruofei,””Chairman MA, Mr. Xia, let’s send the ‘star of Hong Kong’ off on his last journey!”

“Alright!” MA Xiong immediately nodded. We’ll go with you!”

Xia ruofei was stunned. He asked in surprise,””Director Guo, what ... What last journey?” Didn’t the star of Hong Kong only have a broken leg? What are they doing?”

MA Xiong looked at Guo Hongjiang and gave Xia ruofei a look. He said,””Xia Sheng, let’s talk while we walk ...”

Guo Hongjiang was obviously not in the mood to entertain MA Xiong and Xia ruofei, so he walked straight out of the arena.

MA Xiong also signaled Xia ruofei to follow him.

Xia ruofei was confused. As he walked, he asked,””Mr. MA, what’s the situation? Why are we going there?”

MA Xiong sighed.”Xia Sheng, you might not know much about horse racing, so don’t say anything. Director Guo must be in a bad mood right now.”

“I definitely won’t say anything.” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”But what’s going on? You have to explain it clearly!”

“We’re going to send the star of Hong Kong off for the last time. He’ll be euthanized soon ...”MA Xiong said.

Xia ruofei was shocked and couldn’t help but cry,””What? Euthanasia?” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Guo Hongjiang, who was walking in front, obviously heard Xia ruofei’s words. He stopped in his tracks and his back trembled. However, he immediately continued to walk forward.

“Lower your voice ...” MA Xiong said with a bitter smile.

Xia ruofei quickly lowered his voice and asked,””No... Old master Ma, I really don’t understand. Isn’t it just a fracture in the hind leg? Why was there a need for euthanasia? Could it be because it can’t participate in the competition after it’s cured? But ... But isn’t that too cruel?”

“Of course not!” MA Xiong quickly replied. If they really can’t continue to participate due to injuries, they will generally be allowed to retire with dignity and then recuperate until they die of old age. ”

“Then why is that?” Xia ruofei asked in confusion.

As MA Xiong walked forward, he explained in a low voice,”Xia Sheng, you just said that it’s too cruel to euthanize a horse with a broken leg. In fact, it’s the exact opposite. This is the most humane way.”

“I’d like to hear the details. ” Xia ruofei said.

He also realized that there might be some difficulties that he had to face. After all, he knew almost nothing about horse racing.

As expected, after MA Xiong’s patient explanation, Xia ruofei finally understood the truth.

First of all, running was a horse’s nature. A horse that couldn’t run was like a bird that couldn’t fly. It was always in a very unpleasant state.

Of course, this was only a small factor.

The main point was that, compared to the psychological pain, it was more of a horse with a broken leg that would suffer great physical pain.

It took 100 days to recover from a fracture. It was a very long process. If it was a small pet like a kitten or a puppy, it was possible to recover if the injured area was fixed.

But for the horses, it was an impossible task.

The horse was huge and had infinite strength. Humans could not hold it at all. Therefore, if they insisted on treatment, it would only cause the horse’s broken leg to be fractured again before it could heal.

This process would cause them great pain, both physical and mental.

The amputation plan was not feasible either.

The horse itself was too heavy, and the structure of its legs was also very precise, so it could bear such a large weight on its thin legs.

If one of his legs was cut off and he could only stand on three legs for a long time, not only would the broken leg not recover, but the good leg would also be damaged due to the long period of time.

All in all, if a horse’s leg was broken, it was basically impossible to heal it. If one insisted on treating it, it would only bring a long period of pain and eventually die a worse death.

Therefore, the most humane approach was to euthanize it.

This was also the best solution that had been summed up over the years. Otherwise, with Guo Hongjiang’s wealth, as long as there was a little chance, how could he be willing to see his beloved horse die like this?

After Xia ruofei understood the reason, he looked at Guo Hongjiang’s back and understood his feelings.

Xia ruofei’s mind flashed back to the photos of the “star of Hong Kong” winning all kinds of awards in the private room, as well as his outstanding grace after the opening.

Even though it was his first day meeting the “star of Hong Kong,” he couldn’t help but feel sad when he found out that such an excellent horse was about to be put down.

However, Guo Hongjiang was the owner of the star of Hong Kong and he had bought it when it was still a pony. He must have had a deep relationship with it.

One could only imagine how depressed Guo Hongjiang was at the moment.

As Xia ruofei thought about it, an idea suddenly came to his mind.”The star of Hong Kong can’t be cured with normal medical treatment, but I can!”
