Chapter 492: Let’s go together (1)

Two burly men worked together to carry monkey and Heibao over and stuff them into the car. Then, they looked at Xia ruofei with flattering expressions.

“Big brother, we’ve done as you instructed. Can you let us go now?” A big man said with a smile.

Xia ruofei looked at the two of them and said,””Leave? You’re going to let Liang Haiming know about this?”

“Big brother, we won’t tell on you. As long as you let us go, we’ll go as far away as we can and never come back. We’ll just keep what happened today to ourselves ...” The man quickly said.

The other big man also nodded.

Xia ruofei’s eyes flashed with killing intent and he said coldly,””But I don’t trust you guys ... So, the best way is to have you guys die with Heibao ...”

The two big men’s faces changed drastically. The big man who confessed first said in a trembling voice,””You ... You promised not to kill me! You can’t just turn your back on me!”

Xia ruofei sneered,”I’ll keep my word with you scumbags?” Was I out of my mind? Since you dared to kidnap my girlfriend, you should be prepared to be killed. However, seeing that you’ve been quite cooperative, I’ll let you walk more comfortably ...”

If he had not asked Ling Qingxue out for dinner today, he would not have returned to the city. Ling Qingxue would have definitely been humiliated that night, so Xia ruofei was still scared when he thought about it.

These four people were the ones who had kidnapped Ling Qingxue. If Xia ruofei had not arrived in time, they would have sent Ling Qingxue to Liang Haiming’s den. Hence, Xia ruofei had no intention of letting them go from the start.

Besides, Xia ruofei’s revenge had just begun. Liang Haiming had the backing of the Liang family. Xia ruofei’s current strength was not enough to fight against this giant. Under such circumstances, how could he leave two people alive? That was equivalent to planting two time bombs!

The two burly men looked at each other, their eyes filled with despair.

The next moment, the two of them ran in different directions. They still did not have the guts to attack Xia ruofei and chose to split up. They hoped that Xia ruofei would be in a difficult situation and that they would be lucky enough to escape.

However, this was destined to be a futile struggle.

Xia ruofei’s speed was too fast. He shot towards one of the men like lightning and appeared behind him in an instant. The burly man cried out in despair.

Xia ruofei did not show any emotion. He simply struck the back of his neck with his palm and the burly man fell to the ground.

Then, Xia ruofei turned around and chased after the other person.

In just a few seconds, Xia ruofei had caught up with the burly man who had fled.

He did the same thing and easily knocked out the big man.

Xia ruofei stuffed the two unconscious men into the black SUV. Then, he got in and started the car. He immediately reversed the car.

Xia ruofei reversed the black SUV and parked it in front of the pickup truck. The abandoned road was very narrow, and the SUV could not pass through if the pickup truck was parked on the road.

Xia ruofei alighted from the car, walked to the passenger’s side, and carried the unconscious Ling Qingxue out of the car. He then carried her to the back of the pickup truck and carefully placed her in the back of the truck. He then covered her with his coat.

Then, with a thought from Xia ruofei, the entire pickup truck disappeared into thin air.

The next moment, the pickup truck appeared right next to the stone tablet in the new space. There was a flat area between the stone tablet and the cave that was big enough for a car to Park in. Xia ruofei had specifically instructed that Blackie, Da Mao, and ER Mao should not go near this area.

Now that Xia ruofei’s spiritual power was much more condensed than before, it was easy for him to transport an entire pickup truck into space.

This was also the first time that a human other than Xia ruofei had appeared in the spirit map space.

Of course, Ling Qingxue was still unconscious. Otherwise, Xia ruofei would not have done this. The existence of the spirit map space was Xia ruofei’s top secret. He would not reveal this secret even to the closest people.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power was very condensed now. He could easily divide a part of his attention to pay attention to Ling Qingxue’s situation in the spirit map space. At the same time, it would not affect what he was doing in the outside world.

Once Ling Qingxue showed signs of waking up, Xia ruofei would be able to send her out of the medium at once. He could even send the pickup truck out of the medium. To Xia ruofei, it was just a matter of a thought. Everything would be done in an instant without any difficulty.

At that time, Ling Qingxue had just woken up. Even if she had seen the inside of the spirit map space in a daze, she would have thought that she was hallucinating.

That was why Xia ruofei was at ease to send Ling Qingxue into the medium.

After putting the pickup truck in his interspace, Xia ruofei returned to the MPV and continued to reverse the car. He directly reversed the car out of the abandoned old road. After turning to the county Road outside, Xia ruofei turned the car around and reversed the car back into the old road. The front of the car was facing the intersection.

Xia ruofei had already observed that there was a cliff outside the intersection. It was the most suitable to send the four of them on their way.

Baofeng mountain was chosen by Heibao himself. It was a high mountain with steep roads and few people. There were basically no cars passing by, especially at night. It was even more impossible to have surveillance cameras.

Initially, Black Panther wanted to make it convenient for him to do things, but in the end, he had to choose a burial place for himself.

Nothing could be more ironic than this.

Xia ruofei pulled the brakes and punched Heibao who was lying on the passenger seat.

The sound of bones breaking was heard. The Black Panther groaned and blood flowed from the corner of its mouth. It was awakened by the pain.

He struggled to open his eyes. When he saw Xia ruofei, his pupils shrank and he shouted,””What ... What are you doing?”

Xia ruofei said to Heibao very gently,””Brother Bao, right? I’m ready to send you on your way. I think you’re a hero of your life, you can’t die in confusion, right? That’s why I woke you up. The three of them won’t be able to enjoy such treatment ...”

The Black Panther twisted its body in fear and cursed,””Bastard! Quickly let me go ... Otherwise, the Liang family will not let you off ...”

Xia ruofei turned a deaf ear to the Black Panther’s threats. He was not afraid when he was still in one piece. Now that all his joints were broken and his internal organs were probably displaced, he could only lie on the seat like a dead dog. How could he be afraid of him?

As for the Liang family ... When Liang Haiming was dead, who would stand up for one of Liang Haiming’s thugs?

Obviously, these four people were led by Heibao and were the main force in kidnapping Ling Qingxue. Xia ruofei naturally gave him “special care” and wanted him to die in fear and despair ...

Xia ruofei listened to the Black Panther’s vicious curses, but he was not moved at all. He started to get busy.

He first checked the van and unexpectedly found a military – grade pistol and hundreds of bullets under the seat.

This type of standard pistol was the standard of the Special Forces. In ordinary troops, only the officers were equipped with guns, while the ordinary soldiers in the Commando unit all had one.

Xia ruofei was very familiar with this type of pistol. It was no exaggeration to say that he could skillfully disassemble and assemble it in a very short time with his eyes closed.

At the same time, he also had a special feeling for standard pistols.

Hence, Xia ruofei naturally took the gun and the bullets for himself without hesitation.

Xia ruofei had already treated Heibao as a dead man. Everything was done right in front of him. He did not hide anything and kept the gun in the stone room in the new space.

Heibao’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets when he saw the gun and the bullet disappear from Xia ruofei’s hands. He even forgot to curse at Qianqian. This had completely overturned his understanding of things.

Xia ruofei ignored the Black Panther and continued to search.

He found six or seven bottles of Maotai in the trunk. He opened all of them without hesitation and poured them on the unconscious monkey, the other two, and the Black Panther. At the same time, he also threw the bottles into the car.

This kind of high – Concentration white wine was a very good combustion aid. With them, even if Black Panther and the others had extremely good luck, they would not be able to escape death.

And although the white wine would burn, the fragments of the wine bottle left in the car would likely be judged by the traffic police who were investigating the scene as a drunk – driving accident.

It could be said to be killing two birds with one stone.

Naturally, Heibao had guessed Xia ruofei’s intention. His face was filled with despair.

He had already changed from cursing to begging for Gong Jie to let him be a hero. In the face of death, he had long thrown aside the restraint of a martial arts master. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Naturally, Xia ruofei would not be soft – hearted just because of a few words of begging. He would not be moved no matter what Black Panther said.

Xia ruofei then damaged the fuel tank of the black MPV to make sure that there was a high chance that the car would self – Ignite and explode when it rushed out of the cliff.

Everything was ready, except for the crucial wind.

Xia ruofei dragged the driver, monkey, from the middle seat to the driver’s seat and pushed him towards the Black Panther, letting his upper body lie on the Black Panther’s legs.

This position looked a little evil, but Xia ruofei was not doing it for fun. He was just trying to get into the driver’s seat.

After Xia ruofei got into the car, he started the engine without hesitation.

At this moment, Black Panther had completely lost the demeanor of an expert. He trembled and begged: “Xia ruofei, please spare me ... Every wrong has its perpetrator. This was all planned by Liang Haiming. I was just following orders ...”

Xia ruofei didn’t even bat an eye and changed the gear without hesitation.

“Xia ruofei, I’m already a cripple. Why must you be so ruthless?” Black Panther continued to plead.

Xia ruofei continued to ignore Heibao. He released the brake skillfully and stepped on the accelerator. The car sped forward.

Black Panther cried out,”Xia ruofei, stop ... Please ... If you let me go, I ... I’m willing to work like a horse to repay you. I ... And tan Tui’s Secret manual. I’ll give them all to you as long as you let me go ...”

Xia ruofei stepped on the gas pedal and the car sped up. The distance of more than ten meters was covered in the blink of an eye. The MPV had already reached the intersection between the county Road and the abandoned old road.

“No! No... You can’t kill me!” “No!” Heibao shouted,”I’m tan Tui’s direct descendant. If you dare to kill me, my sect will never let you off. My master is a black level master ...”

Xia ruofei turned around and smiled at Heibao. He said,””Farewell ...”

At this time, the outer guardrail was already very close. Just as the MPV was about to hit the guardrail, Xia ruofei pushed open the door that was half – closed and jumped out of the car. He rolled twice on the ground to dissipate the impact. Just then, he saw the MPV knock through the old stone guardrail like a rotten wood and jump into the cliff.

Xia ruofei could still hear the Black Panther’s shrill and desperate cries from the car. His expression was calm and he even had a faint smile on his face.

When Xia ruofei heard the series of loud sounds coming from the bottom of the cliff, his heart, which had been filled with killing intent, finally felt a little relieved. The blood red in his eyes faded a lot.

However, in order to fully understand his thoughts, he still had to do something that might cause a great uproar, but he had to do it ...
