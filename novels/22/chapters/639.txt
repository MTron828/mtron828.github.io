Chapter 640: The coastline in the space (1)

Xia ruofei could not help but frown. He did not know much about this. He knew that there would be a complicated approval process for a drug to be sold on the market, but he did not expect it to take so long.

Xia ruofei couldn’t even wait two or three years, let alone six or seven years.

“President Feng, why is it taking so long?” he asked with a frown.

Feng Jing said helplessly,”Chairman, there are too many steps in between the project’s establishment and the approval for the release of a new drug. Each step is very time – consuming. It can take at least tens of days, and at most it can take months. The most time – consuming step is the clinical trial stage. Many of them take years.”

Feng Ye paused for a moment before adding,””Also ... If we get stuck in the middle or fail to meet the standard requirements, then all the work we’ve done before will be in vain, and we’ll have to start all over again ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but take a deep breath. He had only wanted to do something for the people with autism.

A person’s power was limited. Even if he didn’t sleep or rest, how many patients could he treat? Compared to the millions of people with autism, it was almost negligible.

Strictly speaking, Xia ruofei did not have a medical license. His treatment was considered illegal. It was just that everyone had approached him for treatment through their private connections.

The only way to truly improve the living conditions of people with autism was to mass produce this special drug.

However, he didn’t expect the path of mass production to be so difficult.

“Chief Feng, the medicine I’m preparing to produce is a pure Chinese medicine preparation, which is different from Western medicine.” Xia ruofei said,”and this medicine is likely to be a special medicine to fill in the gaps. Is there any special policy for approval in this situation? As long as we can simplify the procedures!”

Feng Jing had obviously done her homework. She immediately said,””Chairman, the approval process for some Chinese medicine products can be simplified. According to the normal procedures, they have to be submitted to the provincial Drug Administration for first review and the National Drug Administration for review. However, the approval process for some Chinese medicine products can be sped up. We can directly apply to the National Drug Administration and ask the local provincial Drug Administration for inspection of the trial site and review of the original data ...”

Xia ruofei asked,”my medicine is a soup of Chinese medicine. I wonder if it meets the requirements to speed up the approval process?”

......

“I’m not too sure about the specifics,” Feng Jing said.”I’m not too sure about the standards either ... But ... Chairman, even if we speed up the process, it’ll still take a long time.”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””How about this! Professional matters should be left to the professionals to handle! Director Feng, immediately register a pharmaceutical company, and then recruit talents in Traditional Chinese Medicine under the name of the pharmaceutical company’s research Institute! After that, I’ll consider the matter of approval. ”

Xia ruofei thought about it. Other than mass production, there was no other way to help families with autism on a large scale. Therefore, he decided to set up a company first and consult the professionals after he recruited people.

As for the approval process, Xia ruofei definitely could not bear to wait for such a long time. If it really did not work out, he could even swallow his pride and go through the back door. He still had a lot of connections now.

“Alright!” Feng Rao said. I’ll get it done immediately!”

Xia ruofei said,”chief Feng, let’s call the company paradise pharmaceuticals.” It’s a wholly owned subsidiary of our paradise Corporation. The registered capital ... Is set at 10 million Yuan! I’ll transfer the money to the pharmaceutical company’s account when we need the funds for the test. ”

Feng Rao quickly recorded it down as she said,””I understand! Chairman, do you have any specific requirements for the Research Institute’s recruitment?”

Xia ruofei said,”of course, the higher the academic level, the better. The fresh graduates must at least have a master’s degree in traditional Chinese medicine. If they are employees of other research institutions, it’s best if they have some impressive academic achievements. If they are authoritative in the industry, that would be even better.”

“I’m afraid it won’t be easy for a new company like ours to hire such a Big Shot,” Feng Jing said with a smile.

Not to mention the pharmaceutical company, paradise Corporation was now quite famous, but the position of Executive Director had always been empty! The company was still too small, and the truly capable people were not enough. Xia ruofei and Feng Jing were not willing to compromise.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”we can use a high salary to attract talents!” If an expert with a very high academic level is willing to jump ship, I can give him a million a year and even give him a house in San Shan city. All of these can be discussed. ”

“Chairman, that’s a huge sum ...” Feng Jing said with a smile.

“Knowledge is wealth!” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”but I don’t need too many researchers. At most five to eight people!”

The prescription and production process of the heart – nourishing soup were very mature. Xia ruofei’s main purpose of setting up this Research Institute was to get approval for new drugs. He did not need them to do real research, so he did not need to support too many people.

The research level of a pharmaceutical company would definitely be a factor in the approval, and academic talents were naturally a kind of soft power. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Besides, Xia ruofei’s next step might be to research the mass production of the jaded skin cream. Therefore, it was necessary to have such a small Research Institute.
