Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat. He could not help but hold Ling Qingxue and Song Wei’s hands and said,”I do have some means of self – Protection. If there are no major accidents, I should be able to protect Qingxue. I just don’t think Qingxue needs to put herself in danger with me. All you need to do is to cultivate well under my protection. I will do my best to provide you with the best conditions!”

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue looked at each other, then said,””Of course we believe in you, but we don’t want to become that kind of people. We don’t want to be of no help to you at all! “So, this is the second reason I want to say ...”

Song Wei paused for a moment to organize her words before she continued,””I believe you’ve also noticed that the other three sects have all sent their Qi refining disciples to participate in the moon exploration.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes, but if they want to use up all the slots, they can only use disciples in the meditational stage!”

The surging waves sect and soaring Flower Valley only had one early gold core elder each who passed the selection of the music. Of the two spots they had, the remaining spot naturally had to be given to a Qi condensation disciple.

Song Wei shook her head and said,”I’ve heard that the surging waves sect and the soaring Flower Valley have quite a few golden core stage elders. If they were to send more people over to accept the screening of the music piece, it shouldn’t be too difficult for them to pass one more golden core stage elder.”

Xia ruofei had not thought about this and fell into deep thought.

Song Wei continued,”in fact, they didn’t do so. Instead, they sent a lot of talented Qi layer disciples.” Normally, it would be much more dangerous for a refinement stage cultivator to go to the moon with you. If any accidents happened, they would be the first to die. But why would they take the risk and add a refinement stage disciple to the team? Sect leader mu sent his own son, and Yu Xin ‘er is Valley master Liu’s favorite direct disciple. Don’t they care about the life and death of their own descendants?”

“Obviously not!” Xia ruofei said,”however, the competition in the cultivation world is very cruel. This is a great opportunity that others can only dream of. How could sect leader mu and valley master Liu deprive their juniors of the opportunity to obtain this opportunity just because there might be danger? Even if they might encounter an accident, get seriously injured, or even die on the desolate moon, they would not hesitate!”

“That’s just one aspect. ” Song Wei’s eyes flashed with wisdom as she said,”the core meaning of what I want to say is actually ... The other three sects are all intentionally expanding the coverage of their cultivation levels. For example, the first heaven sect’s three spots are for the middle stage of the Golden core, the early stage of the Golden core, and the Qi refining stage. The other two sects also have one spot for the Golden core stage and the Qi refining stage. I think they have their own intentions in distributing the spots like this.”

Xia ruofei nodded thoughtfully and said,””Please continue.”

“I didn’t pass the music selection, so I didn’t experience the moon scene you guys were talking about.” Song Wei said,”however, according to your description, the biggest opportunity of this expedition is likely to be that faintly discernible secret realm. “The music also has a very strange criteria for selecting cultivators. It seems to have nothing to do with cultivation. Whether it’s the middle jiedan stage, the early jiedan stage, or the Qi refining stage, it’s possible for them to pass the selection. I even think that if there’s a Yuanying stage cultivator, it’s possible for them to pass the selection. Could this be related to the secret realm? For example, the so – called ...”

“For example, there are some areas that only Qi refining cultivators can enter!” Xia ruofei’s eyes lit up.

“Or perhaps you’ll face some tests. Qi condensation cultivators will face a much easier test than Aurous core cultivators, and the chances of passing might be higher ....” Song Wei nodded.

Seeing Xia ruofei nodding his head, Song Wei knew that he had taken her advice. She smiled and continued,”In short, it is impossible for the refinement stage cultivators to be cannon fodder. Otherwise, what’s the point of screening them out by the music?”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”that makes sense!” That made sense! It seemed that Chen Nanfeng, Mu Sheng, and the others had already thought through this! However, they tacitly didn’t say it out loud. They probably couldn’t wait for me to go to the moon alone! This bunch of bad old men are really bad!”

Song Wei pursed her lips and smiled,”they’re also thinking about the sect’s interests!” RUO Fei, so you’re willing to ...”

“I’ll ask Qingfeng to go to the star Seizer sect and get some more Qi refining disciples here. I don’t believe that no one from such a big star Seizer sect can pass the selection!” Xia ruofei said.

Ling Qingxue raised her eyebrows and said,””Xia ruofei! Are you deliberately going against me? I clearly fit the criteria, but you still insist on transferring people from the star Seizer sect over to participate in the selection. What do you mean by this! Do you look down on me that much?”

Xia ruofei came back to his senses and quickly smiled apologetically.””Qingxue! I ... I didn’t mean that ... I was just thinking that you shouldn’t go to such a dangerous place if you can! The star Seizer sect has many Qi condensation disciples, so losing one or two of them is nothing ...” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“What!” Ling Qingxue was so angry that she was stomping her feet.
