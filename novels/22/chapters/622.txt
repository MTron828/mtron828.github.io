Chapter 623: Bringing a loli back to the farmy.2

As she ate, she muttered,””Big brother ruofei, it’s so delicious! This is the best crushed ice I’ve ever had!”

“It’s good that Huanhuan likes it!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”but you can’t eat it too often! The weather isn’t warm enough yet, it’s bad for your stomach ...”

“I got it!” Huan Huan said obediently.

In the end, the bowl of crushed ice was finished by Huan Huan. She even licked the glass bowl clean as if she was not satisfied.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but find it funny. However, this was good too. The ingredients of the spirit Heart Flower petal solution would not be wasted.

Tian Huixin was angry and amused at the same time. This little girl’s table manners were too inelegant. She didn’t look like the little princess of a billionaire’s family at all. Instead, she looked like a little beggar who had never eaten crushed ice.

Was the crushed ice really that delicious? Tian Huixin couldn’t help but Mutter in her heart.

However, Xia ruofei had only made a small bowl for little Huanhuan. Even if Tian Huixin wanted to try it, she would not have the chance!

After eating, Huanhuan wiped her mouth and said coyly,””Mom, I want to go to brother ruofei’s farm to play!”

“Huanhuan, we haven’t gone to grandpa’s house yet since we’re going back to the mainland!” Tian Huixin said. Let’s go back to grandpa’s house tonight and come to brother’s farm to play when we have time in a few days, okay?”

Huan Huan pouted and said,”no!” I want to go today!”

“Huanhuan, be good ...” Tian Huixin said earnestly,”Grandpa hasn’t seen you for so long. He misses you very much! If we don’t go back today, Grandpa will be very sad ...”

Huan Huan tilted her head and thought for a while. She felt that it was inappropriate to leave her grandfather aside. She frowned and thought for a while before she said,”Mom, why don’t you go back to grandpa’s house, and I’ll go back to the farm with brother ruofei! Grandpa won’t be sad when he sees you, right?”

......

Tian Huixin was dumbfounded and said,”how can that be?” Brother ruofei is very busy and doesn’t have time to take care of you ...”

When Huan Huan heard that, she pouted and started to cry. She said,”No, no... I want to go to ruofei-Gege’s farm! I want to go to brother ruofei’s farm!”

Alright! After the little girl ate and drank to her heart’s content, she was in good spirits. In addition, her family usually pampered her, so she immediately entered into a mode of throwing a tantrum.

Tian Huixin obviously did not have any tricks up her sleeve. She smiled bitterly at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei scratched his head and said weakly,””Aunt Huixin, why don’t you ... Bring Huanhuan to my farm for a night? My place is spacious and there are many rooms ...”

Tian Huixin smiled bitterly.”I’ve already called my father. I said that I’ll bring Huanhuan back tonight. If I change my mind at the last minute, the old man will be oversensitive again ...”

When Huan Huan heard Xia ruofei’s suggestion, her cries became softer. Her pair of black eyes secretly observed Tian Huixin through the gaps between her fingers.

When she heard Tian Huixin’s words, her cries immediately became much louder.

“Huanhuan, be good ... Don’t cry ...” Tian Huixin hurriedly tried to persuade her.

Such weak words were basically useless to Huanhuan. Instead, she cried even louder.

Xia ruofei said helplessly,”then ... How about I bring Huanhuan to the farm tonight and you go back to professor Tian ‘s?” You can come back tomorrow to pick her up. ”

Wasn’t this what Huanhuan had suggested earlier?

Tian Huixin hesitated for a moment before asking,””Huanhuan is such a naughty child. I’m afraid ... I’ll cause you trouble!”

Huan Huan’s crying stopped abruptly as if she had hit the brakes. She left and said,””I won ‘t, I will listen to big brother ruofei ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”aunt Huixin, let’s do this.” Otherwise, Huanhuan would not be able to keep crying. Moreover, when they returned to professor Tian’s place later, this little girl would not be able to keep a straight face! Go back and explain it to professor Tian, don’t worry! I’ll take good care of Huanhuan. ”

Tian Huixin trusted Xia ruofei very much. Besides, the relationship between the two families was very close. She was simply worried that she would cause trouble for Xia ruofei.

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Tian Huixin hesitated and said helplessly,””I guess that’s the only way ... Huanhuan, you have to listen to big brother ruofei. Don’t be naughty and don’t affect big brother ruofei’s work, understand?”

When Huan Huan heard this, she immediately broke into laughter and said happily,””I know! Mom, don’t worry! Huanhuan is the best ...”

Tian Huixin looked at her daughter. Her daughter’s snot was still on her face! He didn’t know whether to laugh or cry as he wiped her clean with a tissue and said,””You’re still being obedient with your performance!”

“Hmph!” Huan Huan snorted. That’s because mom didn’t allow me to go to brother ruofei’s place, otherwise I would have been very obedient ...” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh when he heard that.

Huan Huan stood up impatiently and said,”Brother ruofei, I’m full. Let’s go back to the farm!”

Xia ruofei laughed and stood up. He picked up Huanhuan easily and said,””Good! I’ll take you back to the farm!”

Tian Huixin quickly stood up and said,””RUO Fei, please wait a moment. My luggage is still in Biyun’s room. I’ll go and get Huanhuan’s sleepiness and change of clothes. She needs to take a bath every day ...”

Give the little loli a bath? Xia ruofei’s face turned green when he heard that. He asked weakly,””Aunt Huixin, can’t I ... Not bathe for a day?”
