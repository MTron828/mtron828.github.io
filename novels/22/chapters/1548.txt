Chapter 1549: Top – grade purple jade (1)

Translator: 549690339

“This ...” The master stonecutter was in a difficult position.

How could he not see that this rich second – generation heir in front of him didn’t know how to gamble on stones at all? how could he know how to cut stones? What’s more, this kind of young master who couldn’t distinguish between four bodies and five grains definitely didn’t work normally. If he was hurt by the grinder, it would be hard for him to explain!

Xia ruofei guessed the master’s thoughts and smiled.””Master, just lend it to me. If anything happens, I won’t blame you! Don’t worry, there are so many people watching!”

Yu mingdong, who was at the side, saw that Xia ruofei had been forced into a corner by He Ping and actually wanted to cut that piece of waste personally. He was also very anxious.

If Xia ruofei were to fly into a rage out of embarrassment after this piece of waste was cut open, it would be even more difficult for him to explain to Ma Zhiming!

Yu mingdong also blamed He Ping in his heart. He felt that this old man’s skill in stone gambling was not bad, but his temper was too strange. There was no way to get along with him.

Yu mingdong hesitated for a moment before he stepped forward and said,””Mr. Xia, why don’t we just forget about it ... That piece of material ...”

“President Yu, do you also think that this piece of material won’t have Jade?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“That’s not it ...” Yu mingdong quickly denied and continued,”but ... There are many people here waiting to cut the stone! We’ve taken up a lot of time, why don’t ... You take this piece of material back and we’ll find a place to cut it later?”

Yu mingdong was certain that there was no Jade in that half of the material. He said that to give Xia ruofei a way out. According to common sense, Xia ruofei just had to go with the flow. Although everyone knew what was going on, at least it was still acceptable for his face.

He didn’t expect Xia ruofei to ignore him. Xia ruofei smiled and said,””There’s always a first come, first served basis! I haven’t finished using it yet! I think everyone can still wait, right?”

The onlookers didn’t mind making a big deal out of it. When they heard Xia ruofei’s words, they naturally echoed loudly. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Boss Luo also laughed and said,””Little brother, you’re right. We’re not in a hurry. You can take your time! We’re just waiting to witness the rise of this half of the material!”

The onlookers also burst into laughter.

Yu mingdong’s face darkened. He knew that with everyone’s booing, Xia ruofei was in a difficult position.

Xia ruofei did not seem to hear their sarcasm. He cupped his hands in greeting and smiled.””Then, thank you for your understanding!”

After that, he said to the stonecutter,””Master, please give me the grinding machine!”

Seeing this, the stonecutter simply followed Xia ruofei. He nodded at him and passed the grinding machine to Xia ruofei.

“These grinding wheels have just been changed. You can use them directly!” The master said.

“Thank you!” Xia ruofei said gently.

He turned on the power and felt the grinding wheel in his hand tremble. With a loud sizzling sound, the grinding wheel started to spin rapidly.

Xia ruofei stepped on the half of the raw stone with one foot and put the grinding machine close to the surface of the raw stone. Suddenly, a sharp friction sound was heard. A large amount of stone chips were lifted up, and the scene was filled with dust.

He Ping saw that Xia ruofei was actually going to cut open that half of the waste and couldn’t help but sneer.

In his opinion, there was no need to be so careful. He could just use a cutting machine to cut this half of the raw stone. No matter how he cut it, it was impossible to cut out Jade.

He Ping felt that Xia ruofei was just wasting his time.

However, this half of the raw stone was not big. Even if he used a grinder to grind it, it would not take much time, so He Ping was too lazy to say so much. He crossed his arms in front of his chest and waited for a good show with a mocking expression.

Yu mingdong was complaining in his heart. He could only watch Xia ruofei Polish the raw stone seriously. He could not think of any way or reason to stop this farce.

The onlookers did not care about the progress of the stone. They were all laughing as they watched Xia ruofei embarrass himself, especially boss Luo. He was discussing loudly with the people he was familiar with, not caring if Xia ruofei could hear him.

The stonecutter carefully stood behind Xia ruofei. He didn’t care what kind of stone could be cut out from this. He was worried that if Xia ruofei’s hand slipped and he really got hurt, he wouldn’t be able to answer to Xia ruofei even if he had said it before.

However, after looking at it for a while, the stonecutter was relieved.

Although Xia ruofei looked fair and tender, his hands were very steady. He held the grinder and focused on grinding. He looked like a proper person and did not look like a newbie at all.

In fact, Xia ruofei did not have any experience in cutting stones. He could not tell what was inside this half of the raw stone and could not draw lines like he Ping. That was why he chose to use the grinder to Polish it bit by bit.

With Xia ruofei’s cultivation and strong spiritual power, even if he was a newbie at stone gambling, he was confident that he could stop in time when the Jade appeared and not hurt it at all.

Of course, all of this was based on the premise that there was Jade in the small half of the raw stone.

There was no doubt about this.

This was because Xia ruofei had already sensed it through the Spirit map scroll. When he touched this small piece of raw stone, the reaction from the spirit map scroll was very strong.
