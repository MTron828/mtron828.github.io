Chapter 1272: A sudden thought (1)

Translator: 549690339

When the “star of Hong Kong” woke up, Guo Hongjiang and the others became nervous.

The effect of the anesthetic was wearing off. The pain from the broken bones would start to torture the star of Hong Kong again. If it struggled one or two more times, Xia ruofei’s previous hours of work would be in vain.

The broken bones would definitely be dislocated again.

Xia ruofei was calm. He gently stroked the “star of Hong Kong” ‘s mane. The “star of Hong Kong” also looked up at Xia ruofei. They didn’t know if it was just an illusion, but they all felt that the “star of Hong Kong” seemed to have calmed down after seeing Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei wasn’t sure if a whole petal of the spirit Heart Flower would be enough, but at least from the current situation, the result was pretty good.

Although the flower petals would be absorbed as soon as they came into contact with the skin, there was still a process for the real medicinal effect to be exerted.

In the case of the star of Hong Kong, most of the petals of the spirit Heart Flower were used to heal broken bones. Xia ruofei’s spiritual power showed that the broken bones had mostly healed, but he didn’t know if the petals of the spirit Heart Flower had finished taking effect.

No matter what, the effect had exceeded Xia ruofei’s expectations.

He had originally been prepared to bleed a lot and thought that he would have to use two or three spirit Heart Flower petals. Now, it seemed that one petal was enough.

The medicinal properties of this petal should not have been completely absorbed yet.

Even if the injury had not fully recovered by then, the ointment that Xia ruofei had brewed was not just for decoration.

This was an ancient recipe stored in the human – shaped jade talisman, and it was much more effective than the ordinary ointment for bruises and injuries on the market.

His injuries were mostly healed, and the pain would definitely be reduced a lot. After using this ointment for a few days, this matter would basically be done.

At most, Xia ruofei would work a little harder for the next two days and stay at Guo Hongjiang’s place to take care of the “star of Hong Kong”. In comparison, Xia ruofei felt that it was worth it to use one less petal of the spirit Heart Flower.

Moreover, it was unlikely that such a serious fracture would be completely healed in just a few hours. Although it would be shocking enough to be cured in a few days, it was better to reduce the impact as much as possible.

Besides, although there were a lot of people today, no one knew the exact effect of the treatment. Xia ruofei could stay in Hong Kong for a few more days and talk to Guo Hongjiang to minimize the impact.

As these thoughts flashed through Xia ruofei’s mind, Guo Hongjiang and the others were very nervous. They looked at Xia ruofei and the “star of Hong Kong” without blinking, afraid that the “star of Hong Kong” would suddenly start to struggle and fail.

When Xia ruofei realized that everyone was staring at him, a few minutes had already passed.

He also felt a little uncomfortable, so he thought for a while and asked,””Director Guo, do you have a place for horse racing?” Can the star of Hong Kong be transferred over?”

Guo Hongjiang hesitated for a moment and said,””There’s no problem with the transfer, but I don’t know how the star of Hong Kong is doing right now. I’m worried that something might happen during the transfer ...”

Originally, when such a serious injury occurred, it was euthanized directly at the racecourse. Otherwise, the result would be the same if he was transferred back. It would only increase the pain of the “star of Hong Kong.” Therefore, Guo Hongjiang did not even consider the matter of transferring his luck.

“It’s okay,” said Xia ruofei.”I’ll be with the ‘star of Hong Kong’ the whole time. I can’t guarantee anything else, but there won’t be any problems on the way!”

“Alright then! I’ll make the arrangements immediately!” Guo Hongjiang didn’t waste time and said directly. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

At this point, they could only trust Xia ruofei unconditionally. At least until now, Xia ruofei’s performance had far exceeded their expectations. As for the effect, they did not know. Xia ruofei also did not let the medical team use any equipment to check.

Soon, a cargo truck used to transport horses arrived.

Everyone worked together to move the star of Hong Kong and the fixed frame into the truck.

Throughout the entire process, Xia ruofei followed the “star of Hong Kong” closely and comforted him.

Perhaps it was because the pain had subsided and Xia ruofei’s spiritual power was kind, the “star of Hong Kong” did not show any violent reaction. He was almost at the mercy of others.

The staff carefully secured the carriage.

Xia ruofei stood at the back of the car and said to MA Xiong,””Mr. MA, I won’t be going back to the hotel. I’ll be going back with the ‘star of Hong Kong’ today. Also, I’ll probably be staying with director Guo for a few days. Please check out my room for me!”

The Presidential Suite cost more than a hundred thousand Hong Kong dollars a day! Xia ruofei couldn’t reject MA Xiong’s warm hospitality. However, he had not been staying in a hotel for the past few days. Xia ruofei thought that he shouldn’t delay his business.

“Don’t worry about it!” MA Xiong said with a smile.”As long as Xia Sheng is in Hong Kong, the Presidential Suite will be reserved for you!”

“This ...”

“Hahaha! Xia Sheng, director Guo, it’s getting late, and my old bones can’t take it anymore. I have to go back and sleep!” MA Xiong greeted the two of them with a smile and said to Guo Hongjiang,”director Guo, you must believe in Mr. Xia. He’ll definitely surprise you!”
