“Seniors, brother Chen, let’s go!” Xia ruofei inserted the crystal into the control panel and said,”please take a seat and pay attention to your personal safety. The environment in outer space is very harsh. The three seniors have already experienced it just now, so I won’t say much.”

Chen Nanfeng, Mu Sheng, Liu Mansha, and Chen Xuan all nodded and found their seats.

Xia ruofei also sat in front of the control panel and controlled the flying boat to increase its altitude.

Because the goal this time was very clear, the Clearwater flying boat was basically rising straight up without much horizontal movement.

The speed of the flying boat was not too fast at first, but as it kept accelerating, it naturally became faster and faster. In almost the blink of an eye, the flying boat had penetrated into the clouds.

Then, the flying boat immediately flew above the clouds.

At this moment, all he could see were white clouds, like balls of cotton.

Moreover, the cotton soon reached everyone’s feet and was getting further and further away.

In fact, at this height, the oxygen content was already very low, and the temperature would become very low.

If an ordinary person was directly exposed to such an environment, it might only take a dozen seconds or at most a few dozen seconds before they would fall unconscious due to the lack of oxygen in their brain.

Any longer and they would have died from suffocation or freezing to death.

However, the black Phoenix flying ship’s protective barrier had a certain defensive effect. Xia ruofei and the others had already filled their bodies with vital Qi and changed to internal breathing. They were all well – prepared, so everyone was safe and sound.

Despite being in such a harsh environment, Chen Nanfeng’s expression was still very relaxed. He still had the energy to remind her,””Fellow Daoist Xia, you must pay close attention to the flying boat’s condition. If it’s damaged, you must stop it in time and return as soon as possible! Don’t try to be brave!”

“Thank you for your reminder, senior!” Xia ruofei nodded.

In reality, Xia ruofei’s spiritual energy had not relaxed for a single moment. He was constantly sensing the overall situation of the black Phoenix flying ship.

So far, the black Phoenix flying ship’s performance had been outstanding.

Under the low temperature, its appearance did not change at all, and its internal structure was still as stable as before.

While Xia ruofei was controlling the swift Boat through the control board, he was also very familiar with the situation of the swift Boat. If the swift Boat was damaged, he would be able to detect it at once.

Of course, the current height was far from the limit.

It was only a little higher than the cruising altitude of an ordinary commercial aircraft, but strictly speaking, it was still within the atmosphere.

Xia ruofei didn’t hesitate. He controlled the flying boat and ascended quickly.

In a short while, everyone had already experienced the effect of weightlessness. Some of the things in the flying boat that were not fixed in place began to slowly float.

At this time, looking out of the porthole, they could already see the huge curved outline of the earth.

Other than being brought into a wonderful situation by the music, this was actually the first time Xia ruofei had truly looked back at earth from this angle.

He couldn’t help but be attracted by the magnificent scenery in front of him. He leaned against the porthole and stared at earth.

Without any additional control, the black Phoenix flying ship was naturally rising at a fixed speed.

Chen Nanfeng’s face also became more and more solemn. This was almost the highest height that the three of them had reached on the Clearwater flying boat.

Just now, Chen Nanfeng, Mu Sheng, and Liu Mansha were on the Clearwater flying boat. When they reached this altitude, the Clearwater flying boat was already damaged in many places. Chen Nanfeng had no choice but to stop ascending and choose to return.

Chen Nanfeng wanted to remind Xia ruofei to keep an eye on the black Phoenix flying ship.

However, he opened his mouth and immediately realized something. They had just realized that in this vacuum environment, the other party couldn’t hear him.

Chen Nanfeng did not know the principle that sound could not be transmitted in a vacuum. However, real knowledge came from practice. He had already had practical experience, so he directly transmitted his voice to Xia ruofei.

“Fellow Daoist Xia,” Chen Nanfeng reminded,”this is already the limit of my blue water flying boat’s ascent. Pay close attention to the black Phoenix flying boat. Don’t be careless! It would be a pity if such a good airboat was damaged!”

Xia ruofei smiled and replied to Chen Nanfeng,””Don’t worry, sect leader Chen. I’ve been monitoring the flying boat with my spiritual power all this time! He didn’t relax for even a moment. So far, the black Blaze flying ship hasn’t been damaged in the slightest. It’s performing quite well!”

“No damage at all?” Chen Nanfeng was a little shocked.”You have to check it carefully. In such a cold environment, it’s possible that the exterior doesn’t seem to have changed much, but the internal structure has been seriously damaged.”

Xia ruofei smiled.”I’ve checked very carefully. Don’t worry, senior!”

Chen Nanfeng’s eyes revealed a trace of disbelief. When he saw the black Phoenix flying ship, he had expected that its defensive power was much better than the Clearwater flying ship. However, it was still unscathed after flying for so long, which was beyond his expectations.

At the end of the day, Chen Nanfeng wasn’t very confident about using an airboat to travel for a dozen days straight to the moon.

But now, the black Phoenix flying ship’s performance had given him a glimmer of hope.

The airboat continued to rise.

Now that they had basically reached the edge of the atmosphere, the outline of the earth was even clearer.

Of course, the environment had also become much worse.

The five people on the flying boat, including Xia ruofei, were all golden core cultivators. Chen Nanfeng was the only one at the advanced stage of the Golden core realm. Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha were both in the middle stage of the Golden core realm. Only Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan were in the early golden core stage.

In such an environment, everyone’s gap was also revealed.

The three sect leaders were still fine. After all, they had profound cultivation and were far from their limits.

As for Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan, Xia ruofei was still rather relaxed while Chen Xuan was struggling.

He needed to use his vital Qi to protect his body. In such a cold environment, the consumption of vital Qi was extremely great. At the same time, he had to maintain his internal breathing and use the circulation of vital Qi to replace oxygen intake. This also had its own consumption.

With the two combined, one could tell that Chen Xuan’s cultivation base was much weaker than Xia ruofei ‘s.

Chen Nanfeng and the other two also saw this.

Seeing Chen Xuan’s serious expression, Chen Nanfeng could not help but sigh. Xuan ‘er’s title as the number one genius of the younger generation could be considered to have completely changed hands!

Chen Nanfeng transmitted his voice to Xia ruofei,’Daoist Xia, I think this is the right height. We can plan our return now!”

Xia ruofei could tell that Chen Xuan was having a hard time, so he nodded and said,””Alright, this place is basically the same as outer space. It’s almost there for the flying boat test. However, whether he could adapt to the environment was one thing, but whether he could meet the conditions for a long voyage might still need to be tested. Of course, this test can be carried out after our spacesuits arrive. At that time, we’ll let the fellow Daoists at the refinement stage participate. After all, they’re also part of the exploration team, and they’re the weakest. Our test will only be successful if the refinement stage cultivators can stay in the airboat for a long time without being harmed!”

Chen Nanfeng nodded and said,”I agree!” Fellow Daoist Xia, let’s end it here for today! Let’s go back now!” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””No problem!”

With that, he made a few adjustments to the control panel, and the black Phoenix flying ship’s upward momentum suddenly slowed down. Then, without even changing directions, it immediately began to descend again.

...

After the Flying Ship entered the atmosphere, everyone felt relaxed. The outer space environment was still too harsh for cultivators of their level.

They were still too far away from the legendary ability to fly through the void with their bodies!

The black Phoenix flying ship was traveling through the clouds, and just as it was about to burst out of the clouds, Chen Nanfeng said,””Fellow Daoist Xia, why don’t we let the airboat stop here for a while and take a look at the situation of the airboat after this flight?”
