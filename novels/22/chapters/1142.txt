Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei, Zhao Yongjun, and song Rui looked at each other, and they all had a look of understanding.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and smiled.”Forget it, there’s no need to be so calculative with an old man who’s in a foreign land!”

“Thank you! Thank you!” “Let’s talk about this King’s Green!” MA Xiong said.

After Liang Chongshan left, this piece of Jade went into MA Xiong’s hands.

MA Xiong was also an expert in the field of Jade, and his ability to identify Jade was not much worse than Liang Chongshan ‘s.

Without any prejudice, MA Xiong could easily tell the authenticity of this piece of Jade. He really loved this piece of King’s Green of the glass type.

The feeling of looking at photos and the real thing was completely different.

Looking at the king’s Green square card up close, he felt a heavy and luxurious feeling. The extremely rich green color made MA Xiong, who had seen many things, even more intoxicated.

“Mr. MA, if you’re interested in buying it, I’m willing to sell it to you first,” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Naturally, MA Xiong’s offer would be the priority.

In business, business was business. You can’t just say that everyone’s relationship is good and sell favors without principles! If MA Xiong had offered a price of tens of millions, Xia ruofei would not have sold it.

MA Xiong chuckled and nodded. He didn’t discuss it with Ma Zhiming. After pondering for a while, he directly said,”Xia Sheng, Hengfeng is willing to pay 180 million Chinese dollars to buy this King’s Green square card!”

Hiss ...

Song Rui and Zhao Yongjun both gasped at the same time. They were both shocked by the ridiculous price.

Zhao Yongjun had evaluated this Jade for Xia ruofei before. He concluded that it would be worth at least 150 million. He knew that if the auction house operated properly, this Jade would definitely be sold for more than 150 million. If the competition was fierce, it could even exceed 200 million.

But that was an auction!

The items that could be used as the finale of the auction were naturally rare items, and there were many rich people who participated in large – scale auctions, so they could often be sold at a premium.

However, if he were to sell it directly, the price would be much more rational.

Therefore, MA Xiong’s bid of 180 million was quite high, and he was absolutely sincere!

Zhao Yongjun knew that if this piece of Jade wasn’t put up for auction, but if he helped Xia ruofei find a capable friend to buy it, it would probably only reach a price of 150 million at most, and he would need to exert some influence.

In an auction, it was estimated to be 180 million Yuan under normal circumstances. Unless one was lucky, they might be able to exceed 200 million Yuan.

Moreover, MA Xiong’s 180 million was Xia ruofei’s net income. If he entrusted it to the auction house, he would have to pay a certain Commission.

When song Rui heard MA Xiong’s offer, he almost shouted for Xia ruofei to agree immediately.

The price was far higher than he had expected.

On the other hand, Xia ruofei was relatively calm. He had dealt with the MA family more than once. Naturally, he knew that even if he sold it to MA Xiong directly, MA Xiong would definitely not let him suffer a loss in terms of price.

Ma Zhiming was also very clear about his father’s thoughts, so he didn’t have any particularly big reaction after hearing the high price. He always had a gentle and elegant smile on his face.

MA Xiong smiled at Xia ruofei and waited for his reply after he finished his offer.

Xia ruofei quickly weighed the pros and cons in his heart. Without any hesitation, he reached out his hand with a smile and said,””Old Mr MA, deal!”

MA Xiong was overjoyed. He held Xia ruofei’s hand tightly and said,””Xia Sheng! Refreshing! Thank you! I’m going to put this King’s Green in the main branch of the Heng Feng jewelry in Hong Kong as the highlight of our shop!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”You’re too kind, old Mr. MA. You’re the one who’s taking care of my business!”

“It’s not the same, it’s not the same ...” MA Xiong laughed.”This kind of top – grade Jade is usually priceless. You left it to me instead of sending it to the auction company. I won’t forget this favor!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Ma Zhiming also walked over to express his gratitude to Xia ruofei.

“Xia Sheng, I heard that you have an offshore company overseas. Do you want me to convert the money into US dollars and transfer it to your company’s account?” MA Xiong asked.

MA Xiong was thinking for Xia ruofei. After all, 200 million Chinese dollars was not a small amount. Didn’t Xia ruofei open an offshore account to make it more convenient for the money to go out to sea? It would take a lot of effort to transfer the 180 million Yuan overseas. Instead of that, why not directly deal with an offshore company?

Xia ruofei smiled.”Thank you for your kind intentions. However, I need to use the money in China. You can just settle the bill with me in Chinese currency!”

“OK!”MA Xiong said with a smile.

Since Xia ruofei did not need the money to go out to sea, MA Xiong was happy to do so. It was all the same to him anyway.

MA Xiong’s assistant quickly drew up the contract on his laptop and printed it with the hotel’s printer.

Xia ruofei and MA Xiong quickly signed the contract. Soon, Xia ruofei received 180 million Chinese dollars from Hengfeng group’s finance department.

Such a huge deal was completed in the hotel room just like that.

Xia ruofei had wanted to treat MA Xiong to a meal. After all, he had rushed over from Hong Kong early in the morning and had even sent him 180 million Chinese dollars.
