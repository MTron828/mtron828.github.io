1970 A gathering of heroes (1)

MA Xiong took a look and immediately smiled.”Hahaha! Those who know me are like flying! I knew you wouldn’t forget to leave it for me!”

There was a pair of huge one – headed abalones, a large piece of truffle, and an old ginseng with luxuriant roots in the small box. Because they were taken out of the refrigerator, the truffle and abalones in the vacuum bag were still emitting a trace of cool air.

“Even if I forget anyone, I wouldn’t dare to forget you!” Xia ruofei chuckled.”I know you like this!”

“Good! Good!” MA Xiong closed the lid and said,”ruofei, I won’t be polite then! Um ... These things need to be frozen as soon as possible. I’ll be going back first! I’ll transfer the money directly to your overseas account!”

“Wait!” Xia ruofei called out,”Grandpa MA, how could you forget what you just said? This is not a high cost for our company. Do you have to calculate such a small amount? This was a double standard! No, no, no!”

MA Xiong was stunned for a moment before he smiled and said,”RUO Fei! So he was waiting for me here! One – headed abalone, truffle, and old mountain ginseng are two different things. Any of them will be in high demand at the auction. I’m already making you suffer losses by coming here in advance to intercept them. How can I take them for free?”

Xia ruofei opened his mouth, but MA Xiong immediately waved his hand to stop him. He said,””How about this! You’ll have to pay for it, but I won’t calculate it according to the auction price. I’ll evaluate it at the market price ...”

“The cost price!” Xia ruofei reminded.

“Alright, alright, alright! The cost price!” MA Xiong smiled and said,”I’ll give you a cost price so that you won’t lose money. I won’t take your things for free.” Don’t worry, I definitely won’t give you more. Is this okay?”

“I can’t win against you!” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”Let’s do that!”

MA Xiong then picked up the small box happily and waved goodbye to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei personally sent MA Xiong to the door. After MA Xiong left, he immediately passed the box to Tony and ordered,””Send it to my car immediately and store it in the refrigerator!”

“Yes, Mr. MA!” Tony didn’t dare to dawdle and ran away with the box.

MA Xiong turned around and smiled at Xia ruofei.””Ruofei, I’ll go back first. Let’s have breakfast together tomorrow, and then I’ll accompany you to witness the glory of your paradise Corporation!”

“Thank you, Grandpa MA!” Xia ruofei smiled.”Take care!”

After MA Xiong left, Xia ruofei returned to his room and took a bath. Then, he took out some crystals to cultivate as usual before going to bed.

The next day, MA Xiong and Ma Zhiming arrived at the hotel early to have breakfast with Xia ruofei and the rest.

Tian Huixin had to send Huan Huan to school, so she did not attend the auction. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Although there were many servants at home, Tian Huixin basically handled Huanhuan’s matters by herself. Tian Huixin had never let the servants take care of things like sending her to and from school.

This was mainly because Huanhuan had been locked up in a lonely world for the past few years. Now that she had recovered, Tian Huixin increasingly felt that time with her daughter was precious.

The auction started at nine in the morning. After Xia ruofei had his breakfast, he went to conference hall No. 1.

Everything was ready. The floor where the hotel lobby and Hall No. 1 were located was almost completely refurbished. There were promotional posters and signs of the auction everywhere. A few screens in the lobby were also rolling to play the warm – up video of the auction.

Many guests and media reporters who had arrived earlier had already started to sign in.

Xia ruofei and MA Xiong stood near the entrance of Hall No. 1 and greeted familiar guests from time to time.

“Xia Sheng, may you be rich!”

“Thank you! Thank you!”

“President Xia, I wish you success today! Sold well like hotcakes!”

“Thanks for your kind words, thank you, thank you!”

“Xia Sheng, I’m really looking forward to today’s auction! Your company is amazing!”

“Thank you! President Zeng, please come in!”

……

Xia ruofei greeted everyone almost non – stop. He knew some and didn ‘t. Fortunately, he had MA Xiong by his side. Whenever someone came over, he would whisper in Xia ruofei’s ear to inform him of the person’s identity, so Xia ruofei didn’t lose his manners.

At this moment, a surprised voice rang out,””President Xia!”

Xia ruofei looked up and couldn’t help but reveal a strange expression. The person who greeted him was Cheng Xiaoxiao. She was the fan he had met at the Western restaurant around the corner of the three mountains not long ago. Cheng Xiaoxiao was a waitress at the Western restaurant.

Xia ruofei didn’t expect Cheng Xiaoxiao to appear at the auction. However, he quickly saw Bastian, the manager of the Western restaurant in the corner, and suddenly realized.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded at Cheng Xiaoxiao, saying,””Xiaoxiao, I didn’t expect to meet you here!”

“President Xia, you still remember me!” Cheng Xiaoxiao said in surprise.

Seeing Cheng Xiaoxiao’s Starry Eyes, Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

“My memory shouldn’t have deteriorated to this extent, right ...” He said helplessly.

“I didn’t mean it that way ...” Cheng Xiaoxiao quickly said.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’m just joking!” I don’t forget beautiful women easily!”

After teasing Cheng Xiaoxiao a little, Xia ruofei turned to Bastian with a smile and said,””Mr. Bastian, we meet again!”
