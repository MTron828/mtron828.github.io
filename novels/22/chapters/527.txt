Chapter 528: Three days of leisure (3)

Carter laughed and said,”Xia!” Let’s go back to the winery! There are delicacies and fine wine that my wife has specially prepared for our honored guests!”

“That’s great, my stomach is growling when you say that!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Carter’s wife, Capella, was an Australian woman in her fifties. She was so fat that she was out of shape, and her chubby face looked very friendly.

Auntie Capella was very hospitable. She had prepared exquisite snacks for Xia ruofei and Liang Qichao. There was local fresh soft cheese and Italian sun – dried tomatoes, as well as a refreshing, low – alcohol, slightly sweet rose – red sparkling wine, Verscato.

Xia ruofei couldn’t stop praising the exotic snacks and refreshing bubble wine.

After receiving the guests ‘praise, Auntie kaberli couldn’t stop smiling. Then, she served Xia ruofei and Liang Qichao two bottles of West winery’s signature Semillon wine.

Liang Qichao had been in the Hunter Valley for a while now, and he couldn’t help but show off when he saw the semiron.

He said,”ruofei, Hunter Valley’s Semillon is also known as Hunter Valley’s Rayman. It’s famous for its high sourness and refreshing taste. No other region in the world can replicate it. You must try it.” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Carter naturally didn’t understand Chinese, so he chuckled and explained,””Xia, this is our West winery’s main wine, Semillon. Unlike other wines, Hunter Valley’s Semillon is usually harvested in advance to maintain its sourness and relatively low alcohol content after fermentation. Moreover, we use low – Temperature fermentation instead of using oak barrels. We will bottle it immediately after the brewing is completed.”

Carter pointed to the two bottles of wine and continued,””The color of young Semillon wine is very light, and the fragrance is mostly of tangerine fruits, herbs, grass, minerals, etc. The sourness is crisp; As the aging process intensified, beauty contest would develop a complex aroma of lemon sauce, toast, vanilla, honey, and so on. The fragrance was rich, the texture was smooth, and the aftertaste was long. One of the bottles has been aged for 15 years and is at its best drinking time, while the other bottle was just brewed. You can compare them!”

“Wow! It’s amazing ...”Xia ruofei couldn’t help but sigh.” It can actually mature for more than ten years in the bottle! Then I’m going to have a good taste ...”

Carter personally poured the two opened bottles of wine into two different glasses. Then, he made an inviting gesture to Xia ruofei and Liang Qichao and looked at them with anticipation.

Xia ruofei smiled and took a small sip from one of the glasses. He closed his eyes and savored the taste. After a while, he tasted the other glass.

After a long time, Xia ruofei opened his eyes and exclaimed,””It really does taste completely different. If I’m not wrong, the glass on the right should be a fifteen – year – old Semillon, right? I can feel the taste of time!”

Carter smiled happily and gave Xia ruofei a big thumbs up. Aunt Kelly also clapped her hands lightly. It was obvious that Xia ruofei’s judgment was correct.

At this moment, Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat and he said,””Mr. West, can I buy a batch of Semillon from you?”

“Of course!” Carter laughed heartily. Our West Winery has a complete network of sales channels, and many Chinese customers also order wine from us through the internet! I’ll definitely pick a Semillon that’s the most suitable year for you ...”

“No, no, no, Mr. West, I want to buy your newly brewed wine!” Xia ruofei quickly said.

“New wine? “This ...” Carter was very surprised.”The newly brewed Semillon doesn’t taste good ...”

Under normal circumstances, they would not sell the newly brewed wine except for the taste difference between the new wine and the old wine. Most of the new wine would be stored properly until more than a decade later.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Here’s the thing. I have my own wine cellar in Huaxia. I hope to collect some top – grade Semillon and wait for them to ripen. I think I’ll be able to taste this batch of Semillon myself in a dozen years!”

“Xia, I can see that you’re a wine lover ...”Carter’s expression changed.

In fact, Xia ruofei just felt that this Semillon had a special taste, so he wanted to buy some and store it in the spirit painting scroll. He wanted to see if this well – known wine would still have a pleasant change under the nourishment of the rich spiritual energy of heaven and earth.

Therefore, Xia ruofei naturally chose the new wine that had just been brewed. The wine that had been aged for more than ten years had already ripened in the bottle. The spatial spiritual Qi’s effect on them was definitely not as good as the new wine.

As for time, if he kept the wine in the original space, ten days would be equivalent to a year. Hence, time was not a problem for Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei’s explanation convinced Carter. He readily agreed.””Xia, how many do you want to buy? I’ll get it ready for you immediately ...”

“Give me 30 boxes!” Xia ruofei said.

There were six bottles of wine in each box, which meant that there were 180 bottles in 30 boxes. Xia ruofei was not trying to sell the wine for money, so this was more than enough.

Carter was very surprised. He was just entertaining a visiting neighbor, but he didn’t expect to make a big business deal.

Carter generously gave Xia ruofei a discount according to the treatment of the most senior member. Each bottle of Semillon was 30 Australian dollars. After the discount, it was 26 Australian dollars. The 30 boxes would cost 4680 Australian dollars, which was less than 25000 Chinese dollars.

Xia ruofei used the VISA credit card to pay.

Carter would be responsible for loading the wine and transporting it to Paradise Farm.

As for the trip from the farm to China, it was absolutely impossible to import the red wine from Paradise Farm under the name of paradise Corporation. Liang Qichao also saw that Xia ruofei had bought so much wine today. He couldn’t use the spirit map space to store it all, so he had to go through the trouble.

Xia ruofei was more interested in the Wine Museum of West Winery. After tasting the Semillon, he went there with Liang Qichao. Carter had to entertain other guests, so he did not accompany them.

Just as Xia ruofei was excitedly reading the introduction on the metal nameplate, a surprised voice came from behind him.

“Xia? Is that you?”
