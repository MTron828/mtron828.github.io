2304 Visiting (1)

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””Weiwei, uncle song’s external injury is not a big problem. Although professor Chen and the others think it’s very dangerous, I can still cure it with the help of some cultivators. In fact, uncle song’s external injuries only look scary. The internal injuries of his brain have basically recovered. ”

“I knew you’d have a way ...” Song Wei heaved a sigh of relief and said,”did you call me out because of my dad’s unconscious state?”

“It’s so easy to talk to smart people!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Weiwei, I’m suspect...That uncle song’s condition might have a problem with his soul.”

Song Wei pondered for a while and nodded, “It’s very possible! After all, he was injured on his head ... And as you said, his external injuries are no longer a big problem, but he still hasn’t woken up. It’s possible that his soul is injured!”

After all, Song Wei had been cultivating for a long time. Moreover, the advanced mode of the “Scripture of the primogenitor” required both of their souls to cultivate together. Hence, she did not know much about the soul. With Xia ruofei’s reminder, she immediately had her own analysis.

“Yes.” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”Do you remember when you were in the ancient tomb on Mount Yu? you were almost possessed by that spirit body.”

“Of course!” Song Wei said with a lingering fear,”I’m really scared now that I think about it! I didn’t know what happened at that time, and when I woke up, I was already in the hotel ...”

Xia ruofei patted the back of Song Wei’s hand and said,””Actually, uncle song’s situation was quite similar to yours. His soul was damaged or he activated his self – Protection, so he completely shut off his perception of the outside world and even lost the most basic reflex function.”

Xia ruofei saw the worry on Song Wei’s face and immediately comforted her,””Wei Wei, don’t be too worried! After all, I’m experienced now, right? I was able to save you back then, so I’ll definitely be able to save uncle song this time!”

“RUO Fei ...” Song Wei asked,”the price to repair the damaged soul must be quite high, right?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Weiwei, uncle song is your father. I won’t even frown no matter what price I have to pay!”

Song Wei was touched. She leaned her head on Xia ruofei’s shoulder and said,””Thank you ...”

Xia ruofei was shocked and quickly said,””Wei Wei, someone’s ...”

Song Wei straightened her body as if she had been electrocuted. She looked left and right nervously, then pouted and said,”Where is he? You’re teasing me again!”

Xia ruofei could not tell Song Wei that there were many plainclothes police officers around. He could only laugh. “I’m saying ... This is the hospital corridor, and people can appear at any time, so we have to be careful!” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Song Wei burst out laughing and said,””So you’re afraid! In my and Qingxue’s eyes, you’re the most audacious of all!”

Xia ruofei looked at Song Wei’s half – Smile and knew what she was trying to say. He could not help but feel a little embarrassed.

Strictly speaking, the subtle relationship between him, Song Wei, and Ling Qingxue was caused by Song Wei’s insistence on getting rid of the peach blossom miasma when her cultivation level was still not high enough. If it wasn’t for that accidental soul joint cultivation, how could there be so many things in the future?

Of course, no matter how ignorant Xia ruofei was, his emotional intelligence was not that low. If he had said this out loud, where would she put her face?

Furthermore, if he were to get to the bottom of it, the reason why Song Wei was infected by the peach blossom miasma was because she accompanied him to explore the ancient tomb of Mount Yu. So the root of the problem was still on his side!

Under such circumstances, Xia ruofei’s only choice was to change the topic.

He laughed drily and said,”Wei Wei, your job now is to take good care of aunt Fang and tell her not to worry too much.” It’s not easy to tell her about the soul. You have to find a way to make her feel at ease. This will test your wisdom. ”

“Don’t worry!”Song Wei nodded. I will take good care of my mother! And I have confidence in you!”

Song Wei smiled sweetly at Xia ruofei after she finished speaking.

The two of them sat in the hospital corridor and talked softly. With Xia ruofei’s reminder, the two of them did not do anything intimate.

After a while, the female worker from the municipal Party Committee came over with the dinner that had been prepared.

When Xia ruofei saw her, he naturally did not want a woman to carry so many things. He immediately stood up and took the dinner from her.”Thank you for your hard work!”

This girl had just joined the civil service not long ago. This time, the Secretary was in such a big accident, and she was arranged to take care of the Secretary’s family. She was also a little jittery, afraid that she would make mistakes in her work.

Xia ruofei’s kind attitude warmed her heart and she quickly said,””You’re welcome. This is part of my job!”

Xia ruofei said,”you should go and eat something too!” You won’t be able to do your job well on an empty stomach. We’re here with Auntie Fang!”

“No need, Mr. Xia, I’m not hungry!”

“I told you to go, so just go! Just go quickly and come back quickly. ” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Song Wei also tried to persuade her. The female staff member then gratefully went to have dinner.

In fact, they did have shifts, but her replacement would only arrive at seven or eighto’ clock in the evening. She was already hungry, but when she went to buy dinner just now, she didn’t dare to eat first. She even forgot to buy a set for herself to take back to the hospital. After buying, she rushed to the hospital.

Xia ruofei and Song Wei walked into the ward and persuaded Fang Liyun to eat some.

Fang Liyun only cheered up after Xia ruofei told her that he would arrange for them to visit song Qiming after they were done eating.

When Fang Liyun got the news and rushed to the hospital, song Qiming had already been sent into the operating room. She had not seen song Qiming until now. Although Xia ruofei said that song Qiming’s injuries were under control, she was still worried because she had not seen him with her own eyes.

Therefore, when she heard that Xia ruofei could go and see song Qiming, Fang Liyun felt reinvigorated. She quickly finished a bowl of congee with pork and century egg, as well as a steamed bun, and said,””Ruofei, I’m full. Let’s go and see Qiming!”

Xia ruofei and Song Wei had only eaten half of it. They looked at each other and smiled bitterly.

However, they could understand Fang Liyun’s feelings, so they put down their chopsticks without saying anything.

Xia ruofei took the elevator with Fang Liyun and Song Wei to the floor where the intensive care unit was.

As professor Chen had informed them in advance, Xia ruofei brought the mother and daughter into the intensive care unit without much trouble. After the disinfection process, they changed into isolation suits.

Song Wei saw her mother’s body trembling slightly and quickly went up to hold her arm. She said softly,””Mom! It’ll be fine ...”

Fang Liyun nodded her head heavily. Both of them were actually a little nervous. They followed Xia ruofei and soon arrived at song Qiming’s ward.

Through the glass wall of the ward, Fang Liyun could see song Qiming lying quietly on the bed. She could not help but tear up and walk faster.

As soon as she entered the ward, she saw song Qiming, who had his hair shaved, with his eyes closed and his face swollen. There was also a terrible wound on his head. Fang Liyun could not hold it in anymore and burst into tears.

She rushed to the bed and called out softly,””Old song! Qiming! Wake up! I’m Li Yun ...”

Song Wei’s eyes could not help but turn red. She bit her lower lip and tried her best not to cry.

Xia ruofei saw that Fang Liyun’s attention was on song Qiming, so he secretly held Song Wei’s hand and squeezed it gently.

Tears welled up in Song Wei’s eyes as she turned to look at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei nodded at her and let go of her hand. He walked to the bed and said softly,””Auntie! Although uncle song is unconscious, his life is not in danger. Don’t worry too much ...”

Fang Liyun let go of song Qiming’s hand and nodded slightly. Then, she asked while sobbing,”RUO Fei, that Qiming, he ... When will he wake up?”

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said,””I’m not sure about the exact time. I’ll need to do a further examination of him ... But don’t worry, I’ll do my best!”

“Mm! “Thank you ...” Fang Liyun said.

Xia ruofei gave Song Wei a look and said,””Aunty Fang, you can stay here with uncle song for a while. Song Wei and I will wait for you outside!”

Song Wei knew that her mother must have a lot to say to her father. It would be inappropriate for her to be there with Xia ruofei, so she said immediately,”Mom! I’ll go out first ...”

Fang Liyun nodded her head.

Hence, Xia ruofei brought Song Wei out of the intensive care unit to give song Qiming and Fang Liyun some alone time.

The two of them stood in the corridor and talked softly. Through the glass wall, they could see Fang Liyun sitting on the bed, holding song Qiming’s hand and talking to him.

“Ruofei, do you think ... Dad can hear what my mom is saying now?” Song Wei suddenly asked.

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment.”I’m not sure ... I heard that people in a vegetative state sometimes have a reaction to their loved ones talking to them. However, uncle song’s condition is completely different from that of a person in a vegetative state. He seems to have completely shut off all senses of the outside world ...”

Song Wei nodded and did not say anything else.

Even if she knew that song Qiming could not hear what Fang Liyun said, she would not spoil the mood. Fang Liyun must have a lot of things to say to song Qiming now. It was a kind of confiding, so it did not matter whether song Qiming could hear her or not.

About ten minutes later, Fang Liyun walked out of the ward with red and swollen eyes. She said,”RUO Fei, Wei Wei, let’s go!”

Then, she turned back to look at song Qiming, who was in the ward, before she walked out.

Xia ruofei and Song Wei quickly followed.

Walking out of the intensive care unit, Xia ruofei sent Fang Liyun and Song Wei into the elevator. The mother and daughter were going to stay in the hospital tonight.

Xia ruofei did not follow him upstairs. He was going to return to the intensive care unit to see if he could check on song Qiming’s consciousness. For an ordinary person who had never cultivated, the consciousness was very fragile. Furthermore, Xia ruofei’s spiritual power cultivation had not reached the level where he could check on other people’s consciousness at will. Hence, he had to be extremely careful during the process and could not be disturbed. If something was wrong, he had to give up immediately.

Just as Xia ruofei reached the entrance of the intensive care unit, an old man with silver hair stopped him with a smile and asked,””Are you Mr. Xia ruofei?”
