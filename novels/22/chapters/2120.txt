“Randomly playing the zither!” Xia ruofei said,”the weather is so cold. How can we sleep in the wild?” I’ll talk to the jianda group. Isn’t there a mobile building at the construction site next door? Let them help us build the smallest sized temporary house next to this place. Anyway, this place is still very empty!”

“Chairman, there’s no need to go through so much trouble. It’s only a matter of one or two months ...” Cao tieshu said.

“One or two months is not one or two days. How can there be no shelter at all?” Xia ruofei said,”there is a lot of rain in the winter in the three mountains. Where are you going to hide if it rains? Alright, this matter is settled!”

Cao tieshu also knew that he had not considered this carefully. He did not dare to say anything more, only repeatedly expressing his thanks.

Xia ruofei immediately gave Liang Weimin a call. Liang Weimin naturally wouldn’t object to such a small matter and immediately made arrangements.

Now, the peach blossom company’s basic infrastructure projects were basically handed over to jianda group. Liang Weimin had always placed Xia ruofei’s matters as the top priority. Not only did he ensure quality and quantity, but he was also very efficient.

Currently, the construction of the pharmaceutical factory and the expansion of the farm were also under the responsibility of jianda group. The construction site was not far away.

Therefore, after a while, a truck drove into the farm, and the workers came with a mobile house. The familiar workers built a single – story house in a short time, and they even connected electricity from the nearby cold storage.

Xia ruofei went in to take a look. Although the room was not big, it was not a problem to put two single beds in it. Moreover, it was well sealed. At least it would not be exposed to the wind and rain. The most important thing was that after the electricity was connected, the cold and air conditioner that had been installed together with the house came in handy. After the heater was turned on, the inside of the iron House was as warm as spring.

Xia ruofei nodded in satisfaction.

He encouraged Cao tieshu with a few words, and then asked,””Big brother Cao, I will send the young goose over in three days. Do you have any problems with the time?”

“Three days is enough!” Cao tieshu did not hesitate to say,”Chairman, I think two days is enough ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s not on this day!” Didn’t you say that we have to wait until the cement of the water channel has dried up?”

“Alright then! Then you can bring the young goose here three days later! There won’t be any problems here!” Cao tieshu said.

“MMH! By the way, the pharmaceutical factory will be producing a batch of Chinese medicine today. It’s needed to breed the Strasburg goose. After you’ve received it, store it in our cold storage. ” Xia ruofei said. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Alright!” Cao tieshu replied.

“I’ll tell you in detail how to use it and what you need to pay attention to during the breeding process in three days.” Xia ruofei said,”by the way, go and purchase a batch of cornmeal in advance these two days. This is also for the goose. We’ll prepare it in advance.”

“Okay, Chairman, don’t worry! I’ll remember it all!” Cao tieshu said.

“Alright, you guys go ahead. I’ll go back first!” Xia ruofei said.

……

After distributing these tasks, Xia ruofei was finally free from these administrative tasks. He had been living in the villa in the city for the past two days. After all, it was quite troublesome to travel back and forth every day.

After Ling Xiaotian returned, Ling Qingxue could no longer stay over at Xia ruofei’s place. Although Ling Xiaotian did not mind, as a girl, Ling Qingxue was rather embarrassed. Moreover, she could not bring herself to leave her father alone at home while she went to spend the night with her boyfriend.

But even so, because the two families were very close, Ling Qingxue still had many opportunities to be with Xia ruofei.

After dinner, he strolled a few steps and arrived at Xia ruofei’s place.

Furthermore, Xia ruofei’s dinner had been settled at Ling Xiaotian’s place for the past two days. Wasn’t it normal for the young couple to go out for a walk after dinner?

Hence, Xia ruofei finally had nowhere to vent his energy. Besides, the two of them had time to cultivate together. With the help of the time array flag, even an hour was enough for them to cultivate in the array for two to three days.

Ling Qingxue’s cultivation was improving steadily, and everything was developing in a good direction.

Feng Jing’s Villa was already under renovation. The designers of jianda group worked through the night to communicate with Feng Jing, and the design plan was quickly approved by her.

After that, it was time for the renovation team to enter the site for construction.

Feng Jing trusted jianda Group A lot, so she left all the renovation to them. She basically didn’t need to be on – site to supervise the work. She just came over every day after work to check on the progress, and at the same time, she started to order the necessary furniture, household appliances, and daily necessities online.

Shi Qiang quickly got Xia ruofei’s yacht driver’s license. It looked like a car driver’s license, but it was only valid for five years. After that, he would have to take the test again.

However, the azmu yacht was still in the process of being modified. After Xia ruofei got the yacht, according to the agreement between the two parties, he chose about 500000 Yuan worth of equipment to be replaced and installed by the Yacht Club.

Hence, Xia ruofei had not had the chance to personally drive the yacht out to sea.

On the third day, after Xia ruofei woke up, he drove straight to Ling Qingxue’s house and had breakfast with the father and daughter.

Then, he drove Ling Qingxue to work.

The past two days had basically been like this. Ling Xiaotian was now in a semi – Retired state, so he would not go to the company every day. Even if he did, he would not go so early. Ling Qingxue, on the other hand, had taken up most of the responsibility of the company. Unless there were special circumstances, she would always come to work on time.

The two of them did not go out together. In the past, Ling Qingxue would usually drive herself. Now that Xia ruofei had moved in, he was basically in charge of sending and sending her.

Xia ruofei did not find it troublesome at all. After all, he had not taken much care of Ling Qingxue before. Now that he had the opportunity to do more for her, he felt that it was only natural.

Of course, this was also because Xia ruofei always felt that he owed Ling Qingxue. Whether it was Song Wei’s incident or Monica’s incident, Xia ruofei always felt guilty and guilty.

After returning home from Ling Qingxue’s company, Xia ruofei immediately took out the cage that contained the six Strasburg geese that he had prepared in the medium.

Then, he took all six cages to the villa’s yard and put them there.

At around 10 O’ clock, ye Lingyun drove the pickup truck from the farm to Xia ruofei’s Villa.

“Brother Xia, your place was hard to find!” Ye linyun said with a smile.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”We’re familiar with each other. Now that we know the way, we should come here more often!”

“Alright!” Ye linyun said,”you don’t live on the farm much now, so we don’t have many chances to meet ...”

Ye Lingyun was now basically devoted to the tea – making business. Lei Hu was mainly in charge of the security Department. He rarely went to the company’s headquarters in the city and spent most of his time in the employees ‘apartment on the farm.

After the headquarters moved, the staff apartments were no longer so tight. Ye Lingyun could enjoy the treatment of having two rooms and one living room by himself.

Xia ruofei laughed.”You should also bring a few disciples out soon. I don’t want my right – hand man to be tied up in tea – making all day long. You still have to come to the headquarters to take up a position in the future!”

“I know, brother Xia!” Ye Lingyun smiled and said,”Oh right, these are the cages!”

“Mm! Load them all into the car, and then we’ll go back home!” Xia ruofei said.

“Alright!” Ye Lingyun quickly put the cages into the back of the pickup truck, then carefully secured them with straps.

Then, Xia ruofei drove his off – Road vehicle and ye Lingyun drove his pickup truck. The two cars drove out of the villa district One after the other and sped in the direction of the peach Garden Farm.
