2941 Entering the state (1)

These security guards had all had a brilliant career in the military. Even if the Veterans recruited by Xu You were not from lone wolf, they were also from the most elite reconnaissance team in their Military Region. When they saw the camp that was full of battlefield atmosphere, they could not help but feel excited.

Even ma su and the others who had just left the camp were excited.

However, they were indeed veterans. Even though they were all excited, they still maintained their formation and their pace was still neat. However, their morale was clearly much higher.

When the troops arrived at the entrance of the camp, they skillfully formed four horizontal lines. After ma su had finished organizing the troops, he looked at Xia ruofei. Although he was Xia ruofei’s company commander when he was in the Army, he had a very positive attitude that Xia ruofei was the highest “commander” here.

Xia ruofei didn’t walk to the front of the group. He just smiled and waved his hand.”I have nothing to say. Everyone, please settle down in the camp as soon as possible and get your equipment. I’ll give you one hour to get everything in order. Is there a problem?”

“No, I didn ‘t!” The security team members shouted in unison, full of vigor.

Xia ruofei nodded in satisfaction and then gestured to Ma Jia.

Ma Jia immediately asked two guards to open the gate of the camp, and then he led the team into the camp with neat steps.

The Guard’s barracks had the standard layout of a company. The two rows of bungalows at the front and back were the team members ‘dormitories. On the two sides, there were also auxiliary buildings such as Armory and canteens. In addition, there were sentry towers in the surroundings and Sentry posts at the entrance. These buildings were surrounded. In the middle of the open field, there was a basketball court, single and double bars, and so on. It was a place for daily formation, physical training, and leisure time for the team members. Behind the barracks, there was also a tactical training ground built based on the mountainous terrain.

Ma su stopped in front of the barracks and loudly ordered,”Rest for three minutes!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The security guards all relaxed, but they still maintained their formation. They didn’t need to maintain the standard military posture and could also talk in a low voice, but they couldn’t leave the line.

Ma Jia walked quickly to Xia ruofei and asked,””RUO Fei, tell me about the situation in the camp first so that I can make the next arrangements.”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. He stood there and introduced the man to Ma Jia,””The two rows in front of you are the team members” dormitories. Each row has ten large dormitories, and the other two ends each have a single room. The left side is the equipment Warehouse, the right side is the cafeteria, the entertainment room ...”

The camp was not big, and the layout was not complicated. Xia ruofei had personally designed the layout according to the facilities left behind by the mercenaries, so he naturally knew it by heart. He quickly introduced the layout of the camp to Ma Jia and continued,””All the weapons and equipment on the list you provided are in the warehouse. One of the two warehouses is level one security, filled with weapons and ammunition. The other warehouse is filled with weapons and ammunition, purchased according to your needs. It’s filled with two sets of gloves and still has some surplus.”

After hearing this, Ma Jia quickly had an idea. He nodded and said,”I understand! RUO Fei, I’ll make the arrangements!”

“En!” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

Since he had entrusted the guard team to Ma Jia, he would not interfere with Ma Jia’s work. He had nothing to do today, so he just watched from the side. He also wanted to see how the overall situation of the guard team was after being trained by Ma Jia for a period of time.

Most of the time, the combat power of an Army could be seen from some details.

And Xia ruofei happened to be very experienced in this area.

Ma Jia quickly walked to the front of the team and shouted,””Stop! To the right! Forward ... Look!”

The security guards who were whispering just now all quieted down when they heard the word “stop,” and quickly began to line up according to Ma Jia’s command.

The formation that seemed to be a little loose just now immediately became neat and tidy after Ma Jia gave the order.

Xia ruofei, who was standing at the side, nodded.

Ma Jia pondered for a while and then said,””We’ll first arrange the accommodation. The first, second, and third rows are in the barracks in front. From left to right, they’re from class one to class nine! The fourth and fifth rows were arranged in the barracks at the back. They were also arranged from left to right by class! The accommodation for the team leaders and core members will be arranged later!”

The guard had more than 100 people, which was almost the size of a reinforced company. In the beginning, after getting Xia ruofei’s consent, ma su divided the guard into five platoons. Each platoons had three shifts, and each shift had ten people. Of course, since the current number of people was not exactly 150, some shifts were not full.

When they were training at Taoyuan farm, they had already temporarily appointed platoon leaders, squad leaders, and other backbones. Except for Ma Jia, Xu Yougang, and a few officers from lone wolf, who were the leaders of the guard team, the other members had been assigned to specific platoons.

Ma Jia continued,”after disbandment, each class will be assigned a dormitory to settle down first!” The class leader will lead everyone to clean up the house and the environment! The team leader went to the warehouse to distribute the equipment! Half an hour later, everyone was notified to come to the warehouse in a line to collect their packages! Disband!”

After Ma Jia gave the command, the guards dispersed.

The backbones of each class and platoon immediately called out to their respective members to go to the dormitory and prepare to clean up the house.

Ma Jia brought Xu Yougang and the others to the warehouse. Liu mingtian, the military supplies supervisor of lone wolf, also came to the Paradise Island this time. He was an expert in logistics, so he quickly took over the work of distributing the goods.

The guards ‘uniforms were not as complete as the regular army’ s. There was no need for formal or suit – like clothes. Everyone mainly wore jungle camouflage on a daily basis. However, there were still quite a lot of things from inside to outside, from top to bottom, including physical training clothes, combat boots, outer belts, and even socks ... Everyone had at least a dozen things.

Liu mingtian quickly sorted out all these things. He used a computer in the warehouse to quickly make a distribution form and moved all the items together for convenience.

Then, Liu mingtian called a few more quick – witted security guards over and assigned tasks to each of them. These security guards were in charge of distributing a few of the sets, and they had to know the number of sets of each set.

In the end, Liu mingtian made a detailed list of the types of clothing that everyone should receive and the number of each type. He printed out a few copies and had someone paste them in the corridor outside.

Liu mingtian’s business was indeed very smooth. He finished all these things in less than half an hour.

Then, he asked someone to inform all the classes to line up to get their uniforms.

According to the established order, the first row was naturally the first to receive the reward. Each squad would form a line according to the requirements and take turns to receive the reward.

Liu mingtian placed a table at the entrance of the storage room. He stood behind the table and took charge while the security guards went inside to get their respective packages.

This way, the distribution was very efficient. A team member came forward to report his own size, and the security members in the warehouse immediately found the clothes of the corresponding size according to their respective tasks and brought them to the door. Liu mingtian was responsible for the final verification and then handed it to the team member who received the uniform.

After the team members received their uniforms, they could check it again in the corridor according to the list that was posted.

The team members came to collect the items like a trotting horse lamp. Liu mingtian and the others in the warehouse were also busy without stopping. More than a hundred people were distributed in about two hours, and there were almost no mistakes.

Very quickly, the security guards had changed into their brand new uniforms, each of them looking more energetic.

Xia ruofei looked around with interest for a while, then brought Ma Jia and the other core members to the weapons warehouse next door. He gave Ma Jia access to the warehouse’s password lock, and then brought everyone around.

Seeing all the brand – New American equipment, Ma Jia and the others were so excited that they couldn’t wait to pick them up and have a taste of them.

Xia ruofei could tell what everyone was thinking. He smiled and said,”Old company commander, I must remind you that the management of weapons and equipment must be strict and formal. Everyone has come to this Island thousands of miles away to work for me. If an accident happens and casualties are caused because of our own management problems, we can’t explain it to their families!”

“Don’t worry!”Ma Jia immediately replied with a serious expression. RUO Fei! I’m also a veteran, I can still distinguish between what’s important and what’s not!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,””I’m just giving you a reminder. We can’t sacrifice efficiency for the sake of safety. Therefore, the equipment that should be distributed to everyone must be in place. Otherwise, how can the guards perform their duties? All the sentries must be armed with live ammunition. In addition, in special circumstances, everyone must be equipped with bullets within three minutes!”

“Understood!” Ma Jia said solemnly.

“You can make the arrangements first!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Ma su nodded. He was the one who had reported the equipment requirements to Xia ruofei, so he was very familiar with it.

Ma Jia found a few sets of regular equipment according to the list, and then said to Xu Yougang,””Old Xu, go and inform the first platoon and class to send six people over!”

“Yes!” Xu Yougang replied and quickly ran out to inform the others.

Soon, the first platoon commander ran to the equipment Warehouse with five guards. Like Ma Jia, their eyes lit up when they saw the brand new American equipment.

“1st Squad Captain,” Ma Jia said seriously,”we’ll leave the first Sentry to you!” There are 6 Sentry posts in the camp, 2 at the gate of the camp and 1 sentry post in each of the four corners. Each shift will stay on sentry post for 2 hours. Each shift will take turns!”

...

“Yes!” The class monitor said excitedly,”I promise to complete the task!”
