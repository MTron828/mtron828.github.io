“Sir, what boss Hu just bought is the authentic laoyan mountain’s iron – Skin maples.” President Lin quickly said,”the iron – Skin maples are a very precious Chinese medicinal herb. It’s a dried product made from fresh iron – Skin Dendi strips and is rich in Dendi glucose, Dendi alkali, and Dendi aminite.” It has the effects of nourishing the five internal organs, anti – aging, lowering the three highs, inhibiting tumors, and so on. It’s a life – saving immortal herb that many critically ill patients dream of!” CEO Lin was very familiar with the business. Once Xia ruofei asked him, he immediately spoke with confidence and eloquence. “Mr. Lin, is there anything special about the iron – Skin maples of laoyan mountain that can be sold at such a high price?” Xia ruofei asked again. President Lin smiled and said,”since ancient times, Mount Yandang has been recognized as the best producer of iron – Skin Dendrobium. It has been known as the ‘hometown of China’s iron – Skin Dendrobium’. Because of its high quality, it has been regarded as a sacred product. It has been enjoyed by the royal family and aristocrats for generations.” During the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, there was a record in the “this grass is renewed”:”Iron – Skin Dendrobium, at the top of laoyan mountain.” Then, President Lin said with some pride,””Our Tongren Tang branch in Qiantang city has a great advantage in this regard because it’s close to the production area. We can get the best iron – skinned maples in the first place, and many bosses from other places often come to buy from us.” Xia ruofei asked some more specific questions, and CEO Lin answered everything he knew. Through his understanding, Xia ruofei knew that wild iron – Skin Dendrobium was very rare. It was a second – grade protected plant in the country. The high – grade iron – Skin maple currently on sale were all processed from the iron – Skin Dendrobium fresh strips cultivated in an artificial wild environment. This was also within Xia ruofei’s expectations. After all, if they only relied on collecting wild iron – Skin Dendrobium for such a precious medicinal material, it would not be able to meet the demand at all. Moreover, it would soon become an endangered species due to excessive collection. At the same time, Xia ruofei also found out that the best wild iron – Skin Dendrobium grew in laoyan mountain, which was the northern Yandang mountain. Although it was rare, iron – Skin Dendi mostly grew on the steep cliffs and cliffs. There were many places that ordinary people could not go up, so it was not extinct. Xia ruofei asked in such detail because he had the idea of growing iron – Skin Dendrobium in the medium. He had been thinking about this problem for a long time. The space was not fully utilized, and the species was still too singular, so there were less profit points. A few days ago, Xia ruofei had planned to go out more often to look for high – value crops that were more suitable for planting. Today, when he came to sell wild ginseng, he happened to see Mr. Hu buying the exorbitant Ironhide maples, which gave Xia ruofei inspiration. After Xia ruofei understood the situation in detail, he expressed his gratitude to Mr. Lin and left the Tongren Tang pharmacy. He didn’t buy some old wild goose Mountain Iron – Skin maple doughnuts as Mr. Lin had expected. Xia ruofei had the wonderful spirit map space and the petals of the strange flower that could cure all diseases. Why would he need other health care Chinese medicine? President Lin was a little disappointed, but he still warmly sent Xia ruofei out. Xia ruofei took a taxi to the hotel that he had booked online in the morning. After checking in, he first checked the room carefully to make sure that there was no equipment that could take photos secretly. As a former elite member of the lone wolf assault team, Xia ruofei was very familiar with this kind of inspection. If there was really a pinhole camera or something like that, it would be impossible to escape Xia ruofei’s inspection. After making sure that everything was safe, Xia ruofei locked the door and windows. Then, he summoned the spirit painting scroll from his palm and connected to the space with his mind. He took out a change of clothes, a laptop, a mobile phone charger, and other items. Ever since he had the spirit map, it was much easier for Xia ruofei to travel. He did not need to bring anything with him. All his daily necessities could be stored in the medium. Of course, Xia ruofei kept them in the new space where the time flow was the same. Otherwise, their lifespans would be reduced for no reason. One day in the outside world was one month in the space! Xia ruofei turned on his laptop, connected to the internet, and started to search for relevant information. Since he was going to plant them in the interspace, he had to choose the best species. Moreover, they happened to be in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province this time. Xia ruofei decided to go to laoyan mountain tomorrow and try his luck. It would be best if he could find a few pure wild Dendrobium candids. With the unique environment of the spirit map space, Xia ruofei was confident that he could produce enough iron – Skin Dendrobium in a short time. Even if he couldn’t find it, it didn’t matter. There were many planting bases around Yandang mountain, many of which were planted in an environment that imitated the wild environment. The worst case scenario was to go to these planting bases and buy some fresh Dendrobium strips, then breed them by cutting in the medium. Xia ruofei did a traffic check and realized that it took about two hours to get to Yandang mountain from Qiantang city by high – speed rail, which was longer than the time it took to get here from Sanshan city. However, Xia ruofei had more than enough time, so he did not hesitate to book two round – trip tickets. At the same time, he changed his ticket back to San Shan the next day and postponed it by one day. Then, Xia ruofei took a shower in his room and called Ma Zhiming in Hong Kong. He told him that he wanted to buy another batch of Jade worth 4 million Yuan. Ma Zhiming naturally agreed. The ticket was for the next day, so Xia ruofei went to visit some of the famous attractions in Qiantang city, Xizi Lake, and tried the local delicacies. The next morning, Xia ruofei checked out of the hotel and headed to the train station. Two hours later, Xia ruofei appeared at the Yandang mountain train station. He was dressed in casual clothes and carried a small backpack, looking no different from an ordinary tourist. After leaving the train station, Xia ruofei found the bus station to the scenic Area according to the information he had found on the internet. After about 20 minutes of bus ride, they arrived at the Yandang Mountain Scenic Area. As soon as they got off the bus, many tour guides came to attract customers. “Handsome, do you need a tour guide?” “Young man, we’re official tour guides of the scenic Area. I’m a 3 – Star Tour guide. Each Scenic Area only costs 60 Yuan. It’s much better than you wandering around aimlessly!” Xia ruofei smiled and rejected all of them. He walked straight to the ticket counter. He was not here to tour. How would it be convenient for him to hire a tour guide? Seeing Xia ruofei’s firm attitude, the tour guides quickly dispersed and looked for their next target. Soon, Xia ruofei queued up to buy a ticket and successfully entered the scenic Area. There was a green bus in the scenic Area, but it would only start when there were 10 people. Xia ruofei did not want to wait, so he paid 100 yuan to book one and took the bus to Lingyan scenic spot. After paying the fare, Xia ruofei walked along the scenic route up the mountain. After a short walk, Xia ruofei checked to make sure that there were no other tourists around and no surveillance cameras. So, in a flash, he left the main road and burrowed into the bushes nearby.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com
