2669 Urgent arrival at peach source Island (1)

After Xia ruofei hung up the phone, he sent the coordinates and navigation map of Paradise Island to Li Yifu. When he was handing over Paradise Island, the Liu family had already given him the information in advance. All he needed to do was to pull it out from his computer and add it to his email.

Then, he called the flight crew’s head, Liu An, and asked him to immediately apply for the flight route to Peach Blossom Island tomorrow morning. At the same time, he asked him to check the condition of the plane and prepare enough fuel.

Although it was late, Xia ruofei had to leave early the next morning. The flight route had to be applied in advance, and the plane had to be prepared. So, he did not care if he would disturb Liu An and the others ‘rest.

Fortunately, the pilots of the private planes were always on standby to serve their employers. Liu An and the others were also used to such sudden missions, so everything was prepared in an orderly manner.

After the call, Xia ruofei created a new Word document on the computer. He took a deep breath and started to type in the names and quantities of the materials while thinking.

At this moment, it was as if there was a three – dimensional map in his mind, and he could see the entire situation of the Peach Blossom Island in one glance.

The looming Taixu xuanqing formation gradually became clear in Xia ruofei’s mind. Which part needed to be strengthened, which part needed to be modified, which part needed to be relieved ... What materials were needed to carry out these modifications, how to strengthen the core of the formation, how to start and maintain the formation more simply ...

When Xia ruofei was thinking about these problems, he had to constantly refer to the diagram of the Taixu xuanqing formation and rely on his own skilled formation skills to quickly calculate and deduce.

This amount of calculation was actually much more complicated than many other mathematical problems, but there was not much comparison between the two.

If Xia ruofei’s spiritual power had not broken through to the spirit gathering realm and his brain had not been greatly strengthened, he might not have been able to complete such a calculation.

Of course, even if he could complete it now, it would still be a little difficult.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei did not need to make the most precise plan immediately. He only needed to roughly estimate the materials needed, the quantity, and the types.

The content of the document window gradually became richer.

After calculating for more than two hours, Xia ruofei finally listed out all the materials he needed. He also left some surplus for the quantity.

He spent another half an hour checking it again to make sure that there was no problem. Then, he packaged the file, encrypted it, and finally sent it to Li Yifu by email.

Xia ruofei gave Li Yifu a call to inform him and told him the password for the encryption bag. Then, he threw the phone on the bedside table and fell asleep on the bed. He did not even take a shower and was too tired. He was not able to control a formation like the Taixu xuanqing formation as the huge amount of calculations had made his brain extremely tired.

Xia ruofei slept all the way until dawn. The familiar sound of the wake – up call outside the window woke him up. He rubbed his sleepy eyes and could not remember where he was at that moment. When he heard the loud bugle call, he felt like he was still in a dream.

After a few minutes, Xia ruofei finally came back to his senses.

His head still hurt a little, so he took out a bottle of spirit pond water from the spirit map space and drank it. After a while, he got out of bed and went to the bathroom to wash up.

Xia ruofei had breakfast with Guo Zhan at the lone wolf assault team’s cafeteria. Then, he confirmed some details with Liu mingtian, ma su, and the others. After the blue Vatican guards arrived at the three mountains, they would start training. Xia ruofei also had to ask the farm to arrange the site in advance.

Although there was the star Seizer sect as an uncertain factor, Xia ruofei did not delay the formation of the guards.

He hoped that he could get rid of the star Seizer sect’s troubles before the guards were fully trained. That way, the guards would be stationed on the island, and with the protection of the great formation, the island would be impregnable.

Of course, the premise was that the scope of this secret’s disclosure had not been further expanded.

If the secret of Paradise Island were to spread from the star Seizer sect to the entire cultivation world, Xia ruofei could not guarantee that the Taixu xuanqing formation would be able to withstand it.

Although the cultivation environment on earth was getting worse by the day, the world of cultivation was once very glorious. No one dared to say that there were no nascent soul old monsters who had survived until now. Even if there were no nascent soul old monsters, if they encountered a veteran golden core robber, Xia ruofei’s Taixu xuanqing formation would not be easy to resist.

After all, the power of an array was closely related to the person who set it up. With Xia ruofei’s current cultivation and array skills, in addition to the natural array, it was already quite impressive for him to be able to fight against a cultivator in the intermediate stage of the Golden core realm.

Xia ruofei’s mind was focused on the formation, so he didn’t have the mood to stay in the old army. He gave his latest contact information to Ma Jia and the others and left. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Guo Zhan sent a mengshi command vehicle to send Xia ruofei directly to Jinling’s Lu kou airport.

Xia ruofei entered the airport through the private passage for the business plane. At this time, Liu An had already completed the flight preparation with the crew and was standing beside the plane to welcome Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei walked over and patted Liu An’s shoulder.””Captain Liu, I’ll have to trouble you again this time ... I originally said that I would recruit one or two more pilots. Otherwise, it would be too tiring for the two of you to fly such a long flight! However, we don’t have enough time, so we can only do this for now. ”

Liu An smiled.”It’s alright, Mr. Xia. We don’t usually have many flying missions. It’s not a problem to fly occasionally on a long route!”

“I’ve been too busy recently. After a while, the matter of recruiting new pilots will definitely be settled!” Xia ruofei said.

“Thank you for your understanding, Mr. Xia!” Liu An said with a smile.

Not long after Xia ruofei boarded, paradise was allowed to take off.

After entering the cruising phase, Xia ruofei went to the bedroom in the back cabin to rest. Paradise still made a short stop in BlackBerry and continued to fly after refueling.

After more than ten hours of flight, paradise finally landed smoothly on the airport runway of Paradise Island.

Today’s airport was a bit deserted. It was not as Grand as the previous two times. Only Liu Qingfeng stood alone on the tarmac and waited.

Xia ruofei got off the plane. Without waiting for Liu Qingfeng to greet him, he asked directly,””I didn’t tell anyone that I came to Paradise Island, right?”

“Yes, Mr. Xia. I’ve been keeping it a secret since you asked me to. I didn’t tell anyone.” Liu Qingfeng said respectfully.

Xia ruofei nodded in satisfaction and said,””In a while, follow the name list I sent you this morning and tell everyone on the list to come to my room!”

“Alright!” Liu Qingfeng said,”the car is opposite. This way, please!”
