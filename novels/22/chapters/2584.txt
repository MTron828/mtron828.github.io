“Mm! You’re right!” Song Qiming said,”to be honest, this feeling is quite comfortable!”

Xia ruofei said,”you just have to remember that every time you practice in the future, you must stop when you feel this feeling of satiety.” If he persisted, he might not only improve his physique, but also damage his body! Also, you’re only a beginner, so it’s best if you don’t practice for more than two hours a day. ”

As a beginner, song Qiming practiced for two hours a day. The intensity was just right.

Especially when he cultivated with a spiritual crystal, the efficiency of absorbing spiritual Qi was much higher than those poor cultivators on earth. Two hours was equivalent to several hours for them. For song Qiming, this time was enough.

Song Qiming had even thought of practicing for a while after Xia ruofei had returned. After all, the feeling just now was quite wonderful. It was almost addictive. After listening to Xia ruofei’s words, he couldn’t help but feel a lingering fear. He thought that it was fortunate that Xia ruofei had reminded him in time. Otherwise, it would have easily turned a good thing into a bad thing.

“I’ll remember that!”Song Qiming quickly replied. Don’t worry, ruofei, I have good self – Control. As long as I feel full, I will stop in time!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Of course, I believe in uncle song’s self – Control. It’s just that this is no small matter, so I still have to remind you. “Moreover, you might not know this, but if you force yourself to cultivate and overload your body, the damage will be very serious. Not only will your body’s Foundation be completely destroyed, but you may never be able to practice this health – Maintenance method again in the future. In serious cases, it may even threaten your life, so You Must Remember This!”

Improper or excessive cultivation would result in very serious consequences. At the very least, the meridians would be damaged, and one would never be able to cultivate again in the future. If the situation was serious, it could lead to the loss of control of true energy, causing serious injuries or even life – threatening injuries. This was no joke.

“Understood!” “I’ll be careful!” Song Qiming replied seriously.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Uncle song, the stone I gave you just now is to help you practice the health – Maintenance method. Remember to hold it in your hand every time you practice.” Also ... This stone is very precious. If people who know the trade see it, they may covet it, so you have to put it away. When it’s not in use, it’s best to find a safe place to put it ... You should have a safe at home, right?”

Spiritual crystals were not particularly precious to Xia ruofei, but if the cultivators on earth saw it, it could set off a bloodbath. It was possible that the cultivators on earth would beat their brains out. Hence, Xia ruofei reminded song Qiming in time, in case he was unaware of the situation and accidentally let others see the spiritual crystal.

“I have a safe in my study!” Song Qiming said. Then, he hesitated and said,”ruofei, since this thing is so precious, you should keep it for yourself! I’ll practice on my own at home. It’s fine even if the effect is a little worse ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.”Although this thing is rare, it’s not that exaggerated. I still have a lot of it!” This piece is specially brought here for you. If it’s at home, you can use it boldly, as long as you don’t show it in front of outsiders!”

Without the help of spiritual crystals, song Qiming could only cultivate at midnight and dawn, absorbing the pitifully small amount of spiritual Qi in the air.

If that was the case, he would at most be a low – Level cultivator of the Qi refining stage and would never be able to cross the Qi refining stage.

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, song Qiming hesitated for a while before he finally nodded and said,””Alright then ... I’ll take it!”

Then, Xia ruofei reminded him of a few things to take note of. At the same time, he repeatedly told him that if he felt uncomfortable while practicing this set of ‘health – Maintenance methods’, he had to stop immediately and contact him to solve it.

Xia ruofei and song Qiming finally walked out of the study room at around 9:30 pm.

Song Qiming’s footsteps were light and he seemed to be in high spirits.

This was only the first time. After a long time, song Qiming realized that his strength would continue to increase. His coordination, agility, and other aspects would be strengthened.

Even Xia ruofei was amazed by song Qiming’s cultivation speed. Not only did he get started quickly, but he was also very efficient in absorbing spiritual energy. At this rate, Xia ruofei would start teaching him the second level of the technique in less than a month.

On one hand, the heart – concentrating herb had changed song Qiming’s physique. On the other hand, it might be because the modest Sutra was very suitable for song Qiming’s physique. It could indeed allow the cultivator to be unaffected by his age and improve his cultivation by leaps and bounds.

Fang Liyun had already prepared some sweet soup for the two of them. It was peanut and longan soup. After the sweet soup was ready, Fang Liyun had kept the pot on the gas stove to keep it warm.

As soon as the two of them walked out of the study room, Fang Liyun immediately went to bring out two bowls of steaming sweet soup. She nodded in satisfaction when she saw that the two of them had finished every single drop.

“Ruofei, it’s getting late. Why don’t you stay here tonight?” Song Qiming said,”Weiwei isn’t home either. We’re quite lonely at home ...”

“Yup! Besides, you’ve had some drinks tonight, so you shouldn’t drive. Just stay here!” “There are a lot of rooms in the house, and the bedsheets are brand new!” Fang Liyun said enthusiastically.

Xia ruofei wanted to leave, but after hearing song Qiming and his wife’s words, he hesitated. Considering that song Qiming was not completely familiar with the first stage of the modest Sutra, he could stay and guide him in his cultivation.

So, after some thought, Xia ruofei nodded and said,””Then I’ll have to trouble you ...”

“What kind of silly words is this child saying!” Fang Liyun rebuked,”this is like your own home! You’re not allowed to be so formal in the future, understand?”

“Yes, yes, yes!” Xia ruofei quickly said,”well ... It’s getting late. Uncle, aunty, you should rest early ...”

“That’s good too. You’ve worked hard for a day, ruofei. You should sleep early too!” Song Qiming said.

For some reason, song Qiming felt that his body seemed to have become younger after he practiced the ‘health – Maintenance technique’. When he saw Fang Liyun under the light, he felt a desire that he had not felt for a long time ...

Of course, Fang Liyun did not know what song Qiming was thinking. She asked the housekeeping staff to prepare the guest room while she went to find a new set of pajamas that song Qiming had never worn before for Xia ruofei. Song Qiming and Xia ruofei had a similar figure, so his clothes would fit Xia ruofei well.

Before they returned to their room, Xia ruofei said to song Qiming,””Uncle song, wake up earlier tomorrow. I’ll guide you to practice again at around Sixo’ clock.”

“No problem!” Song Qiming immediately replied. I’ve always woken up early in the morning. But you ... Don’t you young people like to sleep in? If you can’t get up, then forget it ...”

“I’m fine!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”uncle song, it’s decided then! We’ll go directly to the study room at Sixo’ clock tomorrow morning!”

“It’s a deal!” Song Qiming said.

After everyone said good night to each other, they went back to their rooms.

Xia ruofei took a quick shower and changed into his pajamas before lying down on the large, soft bed in the guest room.

He pondered for a while, took out his phone, opened WeChat, and sent a message to Song Wei: Hey! Guess where I am?

After a while, Song Wei replied,[snickering] there are no clues at all, how am I supposed to guess? Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Xia ruofei did not reply immediately. Instead, he stood up and walked to the window of the guest room. He took a selfie with his phone. The courtyard outside the window could be seen in the background.

Then, Xia ruofei sent the photo to Song Wei, followed by another message,”The clue was here! Free bonus questions!
