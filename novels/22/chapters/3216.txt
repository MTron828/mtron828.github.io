3217 Spacesuits (2)

Of course, this was a long – term outer space voyage. If the spacesuits couldn’t last that long, they would have to change. If that happened, 18 sets would be too much for them. It would be best if they could buy more spacesuits.

As for the oxygen supply module, he would definitely need to prepare more.

Li Yifu couldn’t help but click his tongue and said,””That’s quite a lot! Grand uncle – Master, even masker’s company might not have so much stock! After all, spacesuits cost tens of millions of dollars ...”

“As long as he has the technology and we have the money, we can definitely produce it as soon as possible!” Xia ruofei said,”your task is to get rid of masker and get him to provide us with the things we need as much as possible and as soon as possible.”

“Understood!” Li Yifu said,”grand uncle – Master, I’ll go back to the United States as soon as possible. But as for the peach source Island ...”

“I’ll let Qingfeng bring Zheng Yongshou over to take charge!” Xia ruofei said.

Zheng Yongshou had also learned how to control the formation of the peach source Island, and his formation skills were far better than Li Yifu ‘s. With the jade pendant made by Xia ruofei, he had no problem in taking charge of the daily maintenance of the formation and defending against possible enemies.

In addition, Luo Qingfeng, who was a golden core cultivator, was also there, so it was even more foolproof.

It just so happened that Luo Qingfeng was in the capital as well and had brought along King Mount to help receive his fellow practitioners from the cultivation world. Hence, Xia ruofei only needed to give the order and he could call Zheng Yongshou to head to Paradise Island together.

“Yes! That disciple will wait for Luo Qingfeng and Zheng Yongshou to arrive, hand over the array control talisman, and then leave for the United States at top speed!” Li Yifu said respectfully.

“Then I wish you success!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Then, Xia ruofei thought of something else and said,””Oh right! Foster husband, when you talk to masker, don’t limit yourself to the spacesuits and the support module. As long as you can get your hands on outer space equipment, we want it all, even the spacecraft’s experiment cabin. As long as he’s willing to sell it, I’ll buy it with money!”

“Alright, this disciple will definitely do his best!” Li Yifu said,”however, the space equipment involves a lot of sensitive technology. I can’t guarantee that the negotiations will go smoothly. After all, masker is not particularly short of money ...”

If money could solve the problem, Li Yifu wouldn’t even frown even if he had to spend all his money. However, Musk was also a rich man. He started his business in Silicon Valley as early as the 1990s, and later developed the famous payment tool ”

After that, he founded the famous Tesla and created the Tesla electric car that was popular all over the world.

This guy had always been very persistent in his space dream. In 2001, he invested 100 million US dollars to establish SpaceX, which was now popular all over the world, which was also the United States space exploration technology company. At that time, everyone thought this guy was crazy. He entered the space field with a private identity that many countries could not afford to burn money. 100 million US dollars was only enough to buy a few extra – dimensional spacesuits, so it was destined to not cause any splash.

However, they sent the Falcon rocket into space in 2012, opening the era of private space transportation. In 2018, the complete recovery of the first – Stage booster rocket was completed, greatly reducing launch costs.

As SpaceX’s manned space flight was infinitely close to success, masker’s assets also snowballed. Now, he had a net worth of 40 to 50 billion US dollars, which was comparable to Li Yifu.

For such a rich man, it was definitely not enough to just spend money.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”of course, it’s the most convenient to solve problems with money. Although this masker has a lot of assets, he has many areas to burn money in!” As long as we can safely earn a large sum of US dollars, I don’t believe he won’t be interested. ”

“Of course he’s interested in making money,” Li Yifu said.”He’s still a businessman by nature! If we can ensure his safety, I believe he’ll be tempted. So, I might have to trouble you to go to the United States personally. ”

Xia ruofei pondered for a while and understood Li Yifu’s meaning. He smiled and said,””That’s true. Such a large pile of equipment and spacesuits are all very sensitive equipment. It’s impossible to ship them out of the United States even through smuggling channels. They can only transport them with storage magical equipment. I think as long as we don’t ship the goods out of the United States, masker should have less to worry about. ”

“This disciple also thinks so.” Li Yifu said,”I won’t let anyone else handle this matter. I’m going to personally talk to masker in private.”

“Mm! “If money can’t solve it ...” Xia ruofei said,”you can consider other methods. It was also possible to use some cultivator’s methods when necessary. In short, we can only succeed in this matter and can not fail. We have no way out. ”

Even though many cultivators despised using the methods of a cultivator to deal with an ordinary person, the moon exploration was too important. Furthermore, time was of the essence. Besides, Xia ruofei did not have any psychological burden dealing with an American.

“Understood!” Li Yifu said,”don’t worry, senior granduncle. I’ll head to the United States first. If I really can’t come to a conclusion, I’ll report to you and see what to do next.”

“Okay, I’ll make some arrangements and meet you United States!” Xia ruofei said.

After hanging up, Xia ruofei called Luo Qingfeng over.

“Qingfeng, contact Zheng Yongshou immediately and go to Paradise Island with him. My adopted husband has an important mission and needs to return to the United States for a while. During his absence, you and Zheng Yongshou will be in charge of Paradise Island. Zheng Yongshou will be responsible for the maintenance and control of the array, and you will be in charge of the overall situation.”

“Yes!” Luo Qingfeng quickly replied. This old servant will immediately move out!”

Xia ruofei nodded and checked the soundproof barrier again. Then, he whispered,””Make sure to take a few circles on the road to prevent anyone from following you.”

During this period of time, many cultivators had come to Xia ruofei’s courtyard house. There were also many golden core stage experts. If they were not careful, they might be followed and found on Peach Garden Island. That would be a lot of trouble.

Xia ruofei also knew that the Paradise Island would be exposed to the cultivation world sooner or later, but he hoped that it would be as late as possible. It would be best if he only revealed it when his strength had become something that everyone had to look up to. This way, no one would dare to covet it.

In fact, the most convenient way would be for Xia ruofei to take Luo Qingfeng back to the star Seizer sect with the black Phoenix flying boat and bring Zheng Yongshou along before flying back to the peach source Island.

He should have even sent Li Yifu back to the United States by airboat, which would be the fastest.

However, now that the first heaven society and many other sects were working together to crack the token and organize an expedition to the mystic area on the moon, Xia ruofei was the key person and had obtained some important information. They would definitely not be at ease to let Xia ruofei leave alone.

However, Peach Blossom Island had to be kept a secret and Xia ruofei couldn’t bring these cultivators with him. Hence, he couldn’t use this method.

Qingfeng Luo and Yifu li could only spend more time and energy on the journey. There was no other way. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Luo Qingfeng used the phone in Xia ruofei’s room to contact the sect. He quickly found Zheng Yongshou and agreed on a meeting place with him.

Then, he respectfully bade Xia ruofei farewell.

After leaving the room, Luo Qingfeng was prepared to bid farewell to Chen Nanfeng and the others. After all, he was the sect master of the star Seizer sect, and his status in the cultivation world was equal to Chen Nanfeng and the others.

As soon as they stepped out of the door, Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng saw Chen Nanfeng, Mu Sheng, and Liu Mansha walking towards them from the front yard. The three of them did not look too good and were in low spirits.

What was going on? Xia ruofei looked at the three dejected people and couldn’t help but Mutter in his heart.
