Chapter 772: Revealing its original form (1)

Xia ruofei did not expect the enemy to change their vehicle so he was not too disappointed. If these people did not know such a simple anti – tracking method, they would not have been sent to Huaxia for this mission.

However, after Blackie successfully tracked down the scent left on professor Liang’s body, the search that had been completely clueless and messy had found a lead. Now that there was a continuous high – pressure inspection on the periphery, it was as difficult as ascending to the sky for that group of people to escape.

Xia ruofei and Tian Feilong sat in a police car and returned to the command center of the Public Security Bureau.

On the way, Tian Feilong reported the situation here to Guo Zhan through a secret phone. The command center also quickly began to use the Skynet system to conduct a deep analysis of the monitoring blind spots of the cargo van’s entire driving trajectory.

When Xia ruofei returned to the command center, the technical staff of the Public Security Bureau were working hard.

After all, Tian Feilong couldn’t have given a detailed report over the phone, so Xia ruofei told Guo Zhan about his investigation of the scene. Then, he asked, “How’s the analysis coming along?”

“There’s a lot of data, so I might need some time. ” Guo Zhan said.

The Skynet system wasn’t omnipotent. After all, the van had passed through at least dozens of surveillance blind spots from the abandoned Machinery Factory in the northern suburbs of the city from Sanshan University.

Some blind spot areas only appeared in the next surveillance range in a few seconds. Taking into account the time taken by the car, it was basically impossible for the personnel to change cars in between. These could be ruled out first.

As long as the surveillance was in a blind spot for a long time, further analysis had to be done.

This involved the new vehicles that appeared in all directions of the blind spot during the same time period. They had to analyze their driving trajectories and eliminate them one by one.

It was equivalent to a tree – like structure with an extremely large base, and the amount of data needed to be analyzed at the same time was extremely large.

Of course, if it was done manually, the time spent would be even more immeasurable. It was basically an impossible task.

......

Hence, Xia ruofei and the rest could only wait.

They waited for more than two hours. It was already past lunch time. The Public Security Bureau wanted to invite Guo Zhan and the others to the canteen for lunch, but Xia ruofei and the others were not in the mood to eat. So, they had no choice but to ask the canteen to pack some lunch boxes and send them to the command center. Everyone made do with the meal.

At around 1:30 P. M., The huge data analysis work was finally completed.

The system found more than a dozen suspicious vehicles, which matched the time and trajectory. Each of them could be the vehicle that the group of people transferred to after leaving the van.

The next step would be to do a manual check.

Deputy bureau chief Lu began to personally assign tasks. Guo Zhan thought for a moment and said,”Director Lu, considering that these people are all armed, I suggest that we ask the armed police to cooperate with us. Please pay attention to your safety!”

“Okay, I’ll immediately ask the higher – ups to coordinate the armed police detachment to come over to support!” Deputy bureau chief Lu said.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””Wolf King, I think we should let Xiao hei join the operation? We have to consider the possibility of this group of people breaking up. With little black around, we can keep a close eye on the car professor Liang is in!”

“Sure!” Guo Zhan said,”ruofei, are you still following the operation? I also need you for intelligence analysis!”

Guo Zhan could already feel that Xia ruofei’s professional skills had not deteriorated after his retirement. In fact, it seemed that he had improved greatly. In this operation, he had shown that he was even more capable than Tian Feilong, who specialized in intelligence analysis and trace inspection.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”I’ll talk to black and ask him to cooperate with the police.” I won’t be going. ”

“Can you do it?” Guo Zhan was a little uncertain.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”don’t worry!” Xiao hei is very smart!”

After that, Xia ruofei asked Deputy Director Lu to pick a police officer who had experience in raising dogs. He then whispered a few words to black, who immediately wagged its tail at the police officer and walked over very meekly.

“Deputy Director Lu, all the vehicles that can not be completely cleared of suspicion must be checked by little black. It remembers the smell of the hostages.” Xia ruofei said seriously.

“No problem!” Deputy bureau chief Lu said.

The police officer left the command center with Blackie. Xia ruofei and Guo Zhan waited for news in the command center.

Soon, messages were sent back.

Most of them were useless.

Some of the cars were owned by the company and were equipped with a GPS system. They could directly access the driving data, including the speed, trajectory, and so on. When they were combined with the time period of the surveillance blind spots, they were easily eliminated.

Some of the cars, after Xiao hei’s confirmation, did not have professor Liang’s scent at all. Even if the group of people had split up and might have been in this car, it was not the point of the tracking.

Although the information was invalid, it was not useless. As the suspicion of the cars was cleared one by one, Xia ruofei and the rest were getting closer to the truth.

Then, another message came.

Officer Wang, who stayed in the abandoned machinery processing plant, extracted fresh fingerprints on the steering wheel of the van.

It just so happened that the fingerprint was recorded in the police’s fingerprint database, because the owner of the fingerprint was a person who had been released from prison.
