Chapter 1642: One after another (2)

Then, he went to find Zheng Hua. No matter how Zheng Hua tried to persuade him, he was determined to leave the construction site.

In the end, Zheng Hua could only helplessly let him leave with the truck that delivered the supplies. After all, he was a relative, and Zheng Hua couldn’t just ignore him. He could only introduce him to a job with another Foreman.

Since they were all doing rough work at the construction site, it wasn’t hard to find such a job.

Looking at Chen Dazhuang, who had only stayed with them for half a day, carrying a large bag of luggage and leaving the construction site, the other workers didn’t feel that it was too common for people to come and go at the construction site. They were just making a living outside.

Chen Dazhuang left, but what happened yesterday was like a thorn in Zheng Hua’s heart. He could only secretly pray that similar things would not happen again.

However, what he was afraid of happened.

Over the next two days, all sorts of strange things happened one after another.

Either the equipment suddenly broke down, or the workers were injured for no reason. There were even a few workers who had the same food as everyone else, but they couldn’t stop vomiting and having diarrhea.

This kind of opening wasn’t smooth, and everyone’s heart was covered with a shadow.

Then, the haunted incident happened again.

This time, it was a female worker who saw the “ghost”. When she came out to relieve herself at night, it was still the same toilet. After she finished, she stood up and lifted her pants. Suddenly, someone patted her shoulder gently.

The female worker subconsciously looked back, but she didn’t see anything.

Then, she felt a chill run down her spine. This simple single – person toilet was only one or two square meters in total. It was a completely enclosed space, and there was a wall behind her. How could someone stand behind her and Pat her on the shoulder?

The female worker shrieked in fear, pushed open the toilet door, and fled.

The news of the haunted construction site spread, and everyone thought of the first day they arrived, the big, silly man who was so scared that he didn’t even have time to pull up his pants ...

Zheng Hua heard the news and rushed over. After hearing everyone’s retelling, his expression became extremely ugly.

He knew that this news could no longer be kept a secret. He had to report to the higher – ups as soon as possible. In fact, the progress of the construction had been seriously affected in the past two days. There would always be this and that. In short, all kinds of things were not going smoothly.

Now that another haunted incident had occurred, the workers had also begun to retreat. They could not work at all if this continued.

Zheng Hua quickly reported what had happened to the manager of Tang real estate who was in charge of the site.

After the manager heard it, he didn’t dare to delay and quickly reported it to Zhou Tianyu, the Vice President of Tang real estate.

Although this project was small, it was developed by Liu haofan’s shell company and Tang real estate. Therefore, Tang real estate attached great importance to it and directly appointed senior vice president Zhou Tianyu to be in charge.

Under normal circumstances, such a small project of a few hundred million naturally didn’t need Zhou Tianyu’s level of management to personally ask.

After Zhou Tianyu listened to the project manager’s report in his luxurious and spacious office, he felt like he had been F * cked.

This project was really not going well!

First, when they were bidding for the land, their competitors deliberately raised the price. Liu haofan, who had lost his mind, decided to bid nearly 100 million Yuan higher than the market price for the land. After that, they still had to think of ways to hoard land and try to develop it as late as possible. However, it seemed that the progress was not very smooth. There were many steps that required Liu haofan to personally coordinate, which made Liu haofan quite dissatisfied.

It had only been a few days, but the construction site had been haunted one after another.

If this news were to spread, who would buy the villas that they had developed?

Zhou Tianyu frowned and said,”Lil ‘Wu, you believe such groundless accusations?” It’s one thing for the workers to be ignorant, but why are you also joining in the fun?”

The project manager, little Wu, complained in his heart. He quickly explained,””Director Zhou, the foreman below made a solemn vow and made it sound like it was real. Moreover, this happened more than once. I think ... There might really be something fishy ...”

Zhou Tianyu scoffed coldly,”nonsense!” Could it be that someone was playing tricks? You should investigate it first! The company is paying you a high salary, not for you to sit in the air – conditioning in the office all day!”

“Yes, yes, yes!” Manager Wu quickly replied. General manager Zhou, I’ll go to the site to investigate immediately!”

“Mm, go!” Zhou Tianyu said.

After manager Wu left, Zhou Tianyu’s stern face gradually revealed a trace of worry ...

It wasn’t that Zhou Tianyu didn’t believe in ghosts and gods. On the contrary, these businessmen believed in strange powers and gods. Whenever they started work, laid the foundation, capped the roof, and so on, they would put up offerings to invite ghosts and gods to dinner. Some even had to do rituals.

Zhou Tianyu asked little Wu to verify the situation, but he still had a trace of hope in his heart.

However, this glimmer of hope was quickly shattered.

Xiao Wu, who had personally gone to the construction site to investigate the situation, only used one night to run back to the company in a sorry state.

This was because manager Wu had also personally experienced a terrifying haunted incident.

After receiving Zhou Tianyu’s instructions, manager Wu didn’t dare to delay. He drove to the construction site in Xiaotang town that day to find Zheng Hua to understand the situation in detail.

Although Zheng Hua and the workers made a promise, manager Wu didn’t believe it easily, so he decided to stay at the construction site for a night to see what was behind this.

Manager Wu naturally didn’t want to share the stinky shared bed with the workers, so Zheng Hua had specially vacated a single room for him.

In the middle of the night, manager Wu was woken up by the urge to pee. He opened his eyes in a daze and fumbled to get out of bed to go to the toilet.

However, as soon as he opened his eyes, he saw a pale face looking down at him from a very close distance.

Manager Wu was so scared that he lost all his sleepiness. He was quite bold, so he summoned up his courage and said,””Who is it? Don’t try to play tricks on me!”

The pale face gave him a strange smile, and then gradually moved away from him.

Only then did manager Wu see a man in white standing in front of his bed with disheveled hair. It was this man who had bent down and almost stuck his face to manager Wu’s ...

The man in white didn’t do anything to manager Wu. He just turned around and walked out.

However, manager Wu could clearly see that the man in white didn’t have legs. He just floated out!

The man in white didn’t walk towards the door, but went through the wall and disappeared.

Manager Wu was so scared that he broke out in a cold sweat. He trembled and fumbled around the bed, trying to open it.

However, just as he reached out, he felt a cold hand!

This hand had no temperature at all, as if it was the hand of a dead person who had just come out of a freezer ...

No matter how bold manager Wu was, he was on the verge of a mental breakdown after experiencing such a series of events.

He let out a shrill scream, which was particularly terrifying in the quiet night.

After a while, Zheng Hua and the workers rushed over and turned on the light. They saw manager Wu sitting at the head of the bed, covered with a quilt, and trembling.

Zheng Hua pulled manager Wu’s blanket away. Manager Wu was so frightened that he screamed,””Don’t come over! Don’t come over ... I’m begging you, don’t come over ...”

When Zhou Tianyu saw manager Wu again, he was also shocked.

Only one night had passed, and manager Wu’s face was pale and bloodless. His hair was messy and his eyes were deep. He looked like an otaku who had stayed up all night playing games without taking a shower or washing his hair.

“Little Wu, what’s the situation?” Zhou Tianyu couldn’t help but ask,”how did you end up like this?”

Manager Wu was still in a daze. He said in horror,””General manager Zhou, that piece of land ... Is really haunted! I ... I met one last night ... And it’s not just one ghost ...”

When Zhou Tianyu heard that, his heart skipped a beat and he knew that things were going to be troublesome!𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com
