2922 The soul is gone (1)

Xia ruofei nodded and said,””My local Chinese friend in Mexico has had some disputes with the Gulf Group. I hope you can help to mediate and ensure the personal safety of my friend ...”

After that, Xia ruofei briefly explained the conflict between Huafeng shipping and the Bay group’s quachaquakos branch. Then, he emphasized what happened after the head of Bay group’s vilacracles state, ERAD, arrived at Huafeng shipping today.

In the end, Xia ruofei said,”I happened to be there this morning and taught this ERAD a lesson. The other party must be holding a grudge. I’m worried that the Gulf Group will retaliate against Huafeng shipping. They might even hate the Mexico Chinese and cause the deterioration of the living environment of the entire Chinese community.” Now, my friends in Huafeng shipping company have evacuated to ishwaatlan as soon as possible because they are worried about revenge. They are very worried about their personal safety. So ... If it’s convenient for you, please help me solve this problem as soon as possible!”

When Charlie Koch heard this, he was first very shocked because he had keenly captured a key piece of information in Xia ruofei’s words. Xia ruofei had appeared in Kua chakquarks this morning!

Xia ruofei had just saved his life at sea last night, and the accident site was at least 3000 to 4000 nautical miles away from quachakurakos, which was 6000 to 7000 kilometers away. Even if Xia ruofei rushed to Mexico immediately after saving the people, it would only take him seven to eight hours at most. This speed ... He was like a human – shaped aircraft!

As expected of an Eastern deity!

Charlie Koch was shocked, but at the same time, he was extremely angry. He urged ERAD to publicly discriminate against the Chinese in front of Xia ruofei. He had even insulted Xia ruofei. This was a huge offense to him! This was an unforgivable act for Charlie cohe!

Moreover, the threat of ERAD and the Bay group behind him to the safety of the Chinese had already made Xia ruofei feel anxious. This made Charlie cohe feel very uneasy, and at the same time, he was very angry with the Bay group.

“Mr. Xia, the Bay group’s actions are unforgivable!” Charlie cohe immediately said. Don’t worry! I’ll deal with this matter immediately and give you a satisfactory answer!”

“Alright, I’ll leave it to you,” Xia ruofei said gently.

“You’re too kind!” “It’s always been the biggest honor for me and the kerache family to be able to help you solve your problems!”

“Then I’ll be waiting for your news. Goodbye!” Xia ruofei said.

“Goodbye! Mr. Xia!”

Charlie Cole waited until the busy tone came from the phone before he dared to hang up.

The first thing he did was to give his trusted assistant, Peter, a call. The moment the call went through, Charlie Kohler said in a serious tone,”Pelter, I’ll give you ten minutes to find the leader of the Mexico Gulf Group and contact him! Tell him I want to talk to him personally! The faster the better!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“No problem!” Pierre replied without hesitation. Boss!”

“Just give him my satellite phone number!” Charlie cohe said,”remember, the faster the better! I’ll be waiting by the satellite phone!”

It was the first time that Peter had seen his boss so anxious. His heart trembled and he quickly said,””I understand! Boss, I promise he’ll call you back in ten minutes!”

For ordinary people, the leader of the Gulf Group was an unattainable existence, especially in Mexico, where the Gulf Group controlled more than half of the drug trafficking channels in the country and had more military and armed forces than the government.

However, in the eyes of the huge Coch family, these gangs that relied on drug trafficking and assassination were only small characters. Especially since Mexico had to rely on the United States, the Mexican drug trafficking gangs were not worth mentioning in front of the American aristocratic Coch family.

When the cohe family’s channels and power were all activated, the efficiency was quite shocking.

Pilter only made two phone calls, and it took him five minutes to contact the leader of the Bay group, Goodman.

Goodman was having a vacation in a private Manor by the Caribbean Sea.

He was lying on a recliner by the pool and smoking a cigar. He was in a very good mood. The Bay group’s drug sales had reached a new high this month. This huge drug trafficking group was creating huge profits for him every second. By right, he would never be able to spend all his money no matter how he squandered it, but the pleasure of wealth and the power to control life and death brought him was incomparable.

At this time, his personal assistant quickly walked over with his phone. He bent down beside him and said in a low voice,””Boss, Mr. Peter from the Coch family in the United States is calling.”

“Pierre?” Goodman was stunned.

It wasn’t as if Goodman didn’t know who Pierre was. In fact, although Pierre wasn’t a member of the Coch family, his position in the family was higher than the average core member. He had a role similar to that of a Butler and was Charlie Coch’s most trusted confidant. So, Goodman naturally knew Pierre’s name.

What surprised Goodman was that the Koch family had a century – old heritage, and their influence in the U.S. Political scene had been growing over the years, so the Koch family actually cherished their reputation. Why would the core figure of the family, Pierre, suddenly contact a drug lord like him?
