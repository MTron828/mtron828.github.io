Of course, Wang Chi also knew that the values of rich people were different. If they were all economic accounts, there would not be so many rich people who would buy private planes and yachts. After all, even if these big toys were not moved, the daily maintenance costs were not something that ordinary people could afford.

The plane was climbing very fast and entered the cruising altitude in a short time. The captain also turned off the seat belt indicator light in time.

The two flight attendants began to serve fruits, drinks, alcohol, and snacks.

Xia ruofei unbuckled his seat belt, stood up and smiled.””Everyone can walk around and look around. You can also go to the cockpit, but you have to enter one by one and in an orderly manner!”

Mu Sheng, Liu Mansha, and the others were really interested in the cockpit of the plane. After all, except for the fact that the speed of the plane was slightly slower, its performance was actually quite close to that of an airboat. Also, the plane did not need any spiritual energy. Without any means of the cultivation world, such a heavy ‘iron block’ could fly. Naturally, they were very curious.

In addition to Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha, Feng Xiaoyi also wanted to visit the cockpit. However, he was a step too slow, so he stood outside the cabin door and waited.

In fact, Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha couldn’t tell at all. Facing the dense meters and display screens in the cockpit, the two intermediate jiedan stage cultivators couldn’t help but feel a little dizzy.

After taking a cursory look around, Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha left the cockpit. Feng Xiaoyi, who had been waiting outside, couldn’t wait to go in.

Xia ruofei smiled and said to Wang Chi,””Academician Wang, you’re not going to take a look?”

Wang Chi chuckled and said,”let the youngsters see!” I’m not really interested in these things ...”

At this time, Ling Qingxue, who was sitting opposite him, couldn’t help but ask,””Academician Wang, it’s said that the computing speed of the light of Taihu territory is among the best in the world. How fast is this supercomputer?”

Ling Qingxue’s question was a bit of a noob question, but it was clear that this was not the first time Wang Chi had faced such a question. He smiled and said,””Miss, our divine power engine, the light of Taihu territory, is the world’s first supercomputer with a computing speed of more than one billion times per second. Its peak computing speed has reached 1.254 billion times per second. To put it bluntly, the calculation of the light of Taihu territory every minute requires 7.2 billion people in the world to hold a calculator and calculate for 32 years continuously. ”

Wang Chi’s analogy might not be very accurate, but it was indeed very direct.

After Ling Qingxue heard this, she couldn’t help but take a deep breath and exclaim,””This is too amazing!”

Direct numbers sometimes didn’t have any shocking effect. The divine power engine light of Taihu territory’s computing speed could reach one billion or two billion times per second. For people who didn’t understand this, it didn’t seem to make any difference.

However, with the addition of an image comparison, with all of humanity working together with a calculator in each hand, continuously calculating for 32 years, the image was immediately created.

This was only equivalent to a minute of calculation required by the light of Taihu territory. The huge difference immediately set off the awesomeness of this supercomputer.

It was obvious that Wang Chi had been asked this question many times, so he gave such a vivid answer almost without thinking.

“It’s all thanks to academician Wang,” Xia ruofei said with a smile.”Otherwise, we wouldn’t have been able to get such good resources!”

Wang Chi smiled.”You’re welcome, President Xia. I can only say that you’re all really lucky. Even I didn’t expect things to go so smoothly!”

“You’re the one with the most face!” Xia ruofei laughed.

Wang Chi then asked with concern,”by the way, have you guys tested your algorithm?” Do you need me to help you go through it again? If there’s a problem with the algorithm, it would be a waste of time. ”

Xia ruofei was very confident in the code that he and Chen Xuan had checked together. He smiled and said,””Thank you for your concern, academician Wang. There shouldn’t be any problems with the algorithm. We’ve tested it a few times in the simulated environment, and at least there are no obvious bugs. The probability of error is not very high.”

Wang Chi nodded and said,”that’s good!” That’s good! After all, the time when Shenwei built the light of Taihu territory is precious. It would be a pity if it was wasted because of the algorithm. ”

“I don’t believe that will happen!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”oh yeah, academician Wang, our project is very confidential. I wonder what the Xin Wu Supercomputing Center ...” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Wang Chi chuckled and said,”don’t worry about that!” The Supercomputing Center has strict confidentiality regulations, and their staff will not touch your data. You can copy the final result and delete it completely. After this supercomputer was put into use, it has simulated many important projects in the fields of aerospace, Meteorology, and drug screening, including the accurate simulation of the return path of the Tiangong -1. These projects are all top – secret, and the new Wu Supercomputing Center has not been leaked so far!”

Xia ruofei was relieved to hear that.

At the same time, after listening to Wang Chi’s introduction of the items, he was more confident in cracking the secret of the token.

For example, the calculation of the return path of the “Tiangong No. 1″ involved countless variables. The amount of calculation needed to precisely simulate the return path was very large, and the divine power engine, light of Taihu territory, could easily complete it, which was enough to prove its powerful performance.

Wang Chi and Xia ruofei then talked about the application of supercomputers.

After all, the old man had limited energy. After chatting for a while, he leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes. Xia ruofei sat beside Chen Xuan and took out his laptop. The two of them continued to check the algorithm code.

In fact, this algorithm program had been checked a few times. Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan could not find any bugs in it. It was just to kill time.

At about 11:30, the business jet, paradise, landed steadily on the runway of the new Wu airport.

It was drizzling in new Wu, and the clouds were very thick.

During the approach phase, the plane was slightly bumpy in the airflow. However, Liu An’s crew’s Flying Standard was very high. They still managed to control the plane to smoothly pass through the clouds and land smoothly.

The runway was a little wet and slippery, but the length of the runway was more than enough for a small plane like the Gulfstream G650. Therefore, the crew did not feel any pressure. They just activated the reverse thrust and the automatic brakes as usual. After the plane taxied at high speed for a while, its speed suddenly dropped, then it left the runway and entered the runway.

After the plane stopped at the parking space next to the business terminal, the flight attendant immediately opened the cabin door and lowered the accommodation ladder. Then, he used an umbrella to send Xia ruofei and the others under the eaves seven or eight meters away.

Xia ruofei waved goodbye to the flight crew. Then, under the guidance of the staff, he led everyone through the passageway of the business jet building and out of the airport.

Outside, a light yellow Toyota Coaster was already parked by the road. The driver was holding up a sign with Xia ruofei’s name on it.

This was the pick – up service that Xia ruofei had ordered when he booked the hotel. After all, he did not know how far the hotel was from the airport. Besides, it would be inconvenient to take a taxi with so many people.

After confirming the guests ‘identities, the driver welcomed everyone into the car. Then, the Toyota Coaster drove out of the airport and headed in the direction of the new Wu hotel.

Generally, a hotel that was named after the local name was basically the best hotel in the area.

The new Wu hotel was no exception.

It was a five – Star hotel that had only been renovated two years ago. All the facilities were very new.

Xia ruofei checked in to the rooms that had been arranged for them. Then, he said,”Everyone, go back to your rooms and put down your luggage. Rest for a while. We’ll meet in the hotel lobby in half an hour. Let’s have lunch first!”
