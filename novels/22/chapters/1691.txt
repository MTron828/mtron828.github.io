Chapter 1692: Traditional craftsmanship (1)

Xia ruofei watched with interest as the workers skillfully spread out the baskets of grapes and carefully removed the stems.

“Xia,” said Kelly with a smile,”the stem contains a lot of tannins, which will bring a sour taste. So, in order to keep the wine fresh, the stem must be removed. We’ve been using the most traditional wine – making techniques. These are all done by hand, and although the efficiency is a little low, the quality of the wine produced is much higher!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Yes, quality is the most important. My domestic farm also takes the high – Quality route!”

Feng Rao chuckled.”Our country’s been promoting the spirit of craftsmen. I saw uncle West and the others making wine. I really felt the spirit of craftsmen!”

“This method has been around for a hundred or two hundred years,” said Kelly with a smile.”Many wineries have introduced advanced machinery, but West has been stubbornly sticking to the traditional way of brewing! Although the efficiency has decreased and the cost of labor has increased a lot, he still refuses to change!”

“I must give uncle Wester a like!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you can’t be too eager for quick success in any field. You can only make the best work if you perfect every detail!”

Some of the workers were focused on removing the grape stalks, while others were putting the grapes into high – Temperature sterilized stainless steel containers. After each container was filled, someone would carry them into the small cold storage warehouse next to the winery.

“Auntie cabalie! Then what are they doing?” Feng Rao asked curiously.

Auntie Kelly laughed and said,””In order to extract the fragrance of the grapes and the active components in the skin, and enhance the original fresh fruit fragrance of the grapes, we will soak the broken grapes and the grape juice at a low temperature before making the juice. This will make the wine taste richer and more mellow!”

“Oh! I’ve learned something new!” Feng Rao said with a smile.

“Feng, this process is actually very boring!” “The low temperature soaking process will take more than ten hours, and the earliest we can start is tomorrow, so ... Why don’t you ask Xia to take you to the vineyard?” she said with a smile.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”that’s good!” Oh right, Auntie Capella, are they picking grapes at the vineyard? Let’s go and experience it!”

Auntie Kelly smiled and shook her head.””There’s no one working at the vineyard right now!”

“Oh? Why is that so?” Xia ruofei was surprised.

Auntie caitley smiled and explained,””White grapes are very sensitive to temperature. High temperatures will destroy the elegant sound of the White grapes themselves, increasing the risk of oxidation and microbial infection of the grapes. So, most of the time to pick them is in the early morning, before the sun has completely risen. Furthermore, you have to be extremely careful when you harvest them, and do your best to keep the fruits intact. ”

“It’s that troublesome?” Xia ruofei said,”then wouldn’t uncle Wester have a hard time? They’re already organizing the grape – picking so early in the morning, and they’re even making wine during the day ...”

“We’re used to it. Every year’s grape harvesting season will be tougher.” Auntie Kelly chuckled and said,”but it also gives me a sense of accomplishment!”

“That won’t do! “You’re getting on in years. You can’t keep working like this ...” Xia ruofei said.”If you really can ‘t, hire someone to keep an eye on the vineyard. You and uncle Wester shouldn’t wake up so early!”

“Yup! Aunty cabalie. ” “Your health is more important!” Feng Rao chimed in.

Madam cabalie smiled and waved her hand.”He won’t be at ease if we leave it to someone else! Besides, we’ll also pay attention to rest. During the day, he and I take turns to rest when we’re making wine, and we go to bed very early at night. It’ll be fine after all the grapes are picked. ”

Xia ruofei couldn’t argue with her and could only say helplessly,””Then hire more workers and finish picking the grapes as soon as possible! You don’t have to worry about the increased cost!”

“Xia, thank you for your concern,” said Madam Kelly with a smile.”However, the maturity of the grapes is different. The number of grapes harvested each time is calculated. Increasing the number of people won’t solve the problem! Don’t worry! Although two wineries are picking fruits at the same time this year, it will be finished in five days at most!”

“Alright! You guys must rest well!” Xia ruofei said.

“Good, good, good!” Said Auntie Kelly with a smile.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”since no one is working at the vineyard, we won’t go there.” Why don’t we ... Help out with the work!”

Auntie caitley was stunned for a moment before she said,””Alright! Come ... I’ll help you wash your hands and disinfect ...”

Removing the stem and breaking the skin of the grapes didn’t require much skill. The only requirement was that the workers were careful, so Auntie Capella wasn’t worried that the two of them would affect the progress of the workers ‘work.

After Xia ruofei and Feng Jing washed their hands, they excitedly joined the team.

In the beginning, aunt kaberli was a little worried that they would be careless and not be able to remove the stem of the grapes. However, after working with the two for a while, she was completely relieved.

The two of them were very meticulous. Although their work efficiency was not as high as those of skilled workers, the quality of their work was very high.
