“Old Guo, President Xia knows what he’s doing. Let’s not talk too much!” Li Yufu said with a smile.

“That’s true ...” Guo Qian smiled and nodded.

“Thank you for the reminder, professors,” Xia ruofei said with a smile. I still have a lot of questions I’d like to ask the two of you later, and I hope you’ll be generous with your advice!”

“Hahaha! Good! Good!” Guo Qian said.

Xia ruofei stepped out of the meeting room and scanned the room with his spiritual power. He found that Shen Heping was confined to a room on the third floor. Two security guards were watching him closely. They must have been warned, so they did not dare to shout.

Song Rui and Wang Chi were talking in the room next door.

Xia ruofei also walked into the room.

In the room, song Rui first revealed his identity to Wang Chi.

To be honest, Wang Chi was quite shocked when he found out about song Rui’s identity.

He was the grandson of a legendary figure like elder song!

What shocked Wang Chi even more was that song Rui, who had such a powerful background, had been accompanying Xia ruofei like a Lackey ...

After song Rui revealed his identity, he said directly,””Academician Wang, you must think that ruofei and I overreacted today, right?”

Wang Chi thought for a while and said,””Mr. Song, I know that it might be because of the name and image of Shen’s artificial intelligence project, but ...”

Wang Chi paused for a moment, then continued,””Actually, it’s common for artificial intelligence to be personified. Usually, the image of an artificial intelligence is based on familiar people around it, or the characteristics of many familiar people combined together. This is common ...”

At this moment, Xia ruofei pushed the door open and walked in. He smiled and asked,””Academician Wang, I know what you’re saying, but did Associate Professor Shen Pingping ask for Weiwei’s opinion and permission before using this image? I don’t think so, judging from Wei Wei’s performance today!”

“He must have neglected this.” Wang Chi said awkwardly,”but we’re all from Beijing University. We should be able to negotiate after this ...”

Wang Chi was also quite tired of Shen Heping’s matter, but as the leader of the Computer Science Institute, he had to help Shen Heping get out of it.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Academician Wang, I can tell you clearly. There’s no room for negotiation.”

Wang Chi’s expression changed slightly, and he said,””President Xia ...”

“Academician Wang!” Song Rui said directly,”ruofei and I are not unreasonable people, but we are actually helping the Beijing University computer science research Institute. It’s also a good thing that Shen Heping came to the exchange and even told us about the AI. ”

“Young master Song, what do you mean?” Wang Chi asked.

Song Rui said,”I’m sure academician Wang doesn’t know who Song Wei is.” She’s a member of the song family, so according to seniority, she has to call me uncle! Academician Wang, have you ever thought about what my Grandpa would think if he found out that a young girl from the song family was made into an artificial intelligence? What would they think of the Beijing University Institute of Computer Science?”

“Especially since this AI could be installed on a humanoid robot in the future,” Xia ruofei said.”It’ll be tested and ridiculed by various researchers, media reporters, and students like a toy ...”

There was one more thing that Xia ruofei did not mention, but Wang Chi was sure to know.

The humanoid robots were all very realistic, including their figures, skin, and so on. They were extremely close to real people.

Based on Shen Heping’s feelings for Song Wei, if such a humanoid robot was created, it was obvious what kind of dirty things he would do to the robot ...

Wang Chi couldn’t help but sweat, his heart filled with shock.

Song Rui continued,”academician Wang, you don’t have to suspect Song Wei’s identity. I have no reason to lie to you. It won’t do her any good to pretend to be a member of the song family.” She’s just keeping a low profile and doesn’t want people to know about her family background. I hope that after this, academician Wang Can continue to keep it a secret so as not to disturb her peaceful life. ”

“Understood!” Wang Chi nodded. Please don’t worry about this, young master Song. My mouth is still quite tight. ” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“That’s good. “Song Rui nodded and asked. Academician Wang, please handle today’s matter properly!”

“Thanks for the reminder!” Wang Chi nodded. Don’t worry!”

Then, Wang Chi turned to Xia ruofei and said,””President Xia, the exchange meeting will be suspended for a while. I want to see Shen Heping first. Is that okay?”

Xia ruofei smiled and replied,”of course!” Academician Wang, this way please!”

Xia ruofei personally brought Wang Chi to the room on the third floor where Shen Heping was temporarily held.

After pushing the door open, he motioned for the two security guards to come out first. Then, he nodded at Wang Chi and left the room.

Only then did Shen Heping return to his senses. He quickly stood up and called out,”Teacher! Teacher! You’ve finally come to save me!”

Wang Chi frowned slightly and said,””Are you exaggerating? They just didn’t want you to make a scene at the venue. Do you think they can really detain you? They are merchants, not bandits!”

“Teacher!” Shen Heping said aggrievedly. I don’t think these barbarians are any different from bandits! Look at Xia ruofei and song Rui’s behavior. I suspect that they are involved in ...”

“Enough!” Wang Chi rebuked,”before you speak ill of others, you should first look at yourself and see if there’s anything wrong with you!”

Shen Heping was stunned,”teacher, I ... What problem could I have?” Just because the content of the speech at this exchange meeting is not completely consistent with what they have requested, I have to be treated like this? Isn’t this too ridiculous?”

“Hmph!” Wang Chi snorted coldly and said,”you and I both know the real reason why they are so angry. You don’t have to say this in front of me, right?”

Shen Heping revealed an embarrassed expression as he lowered his head and said,”Teacher, regarding the name of the artificial intelligence and the cartoon image, I did not think it through, but ...”

In fact, Shen Heping still didn’t think much of it. If he was in the lighthouse Country where he studied abroad, this problem might be very serious, and the violation of portrait rights might cause him to go bankrupt. But after returning to his country, Shen Heping felt that such things were common, and it was not a big deal at all!

“Just lack of consideration?” Wang Chi frowned and asked,”you used Song Wei’s image and name. Don’t you have your own thoughts?”

Shen Heping lowered his head and did not say anything. In any case, he would not admit it even if he was beaten to death.

Wang Chi didn’t want him to admit it, so he directly said,””You should go back to school! Stop this artificial intelligence project and change it. Remove all the cartoon figures and change the name to a number temporarily!”

“Ah?” Shen Heping was taken aback. He raised his head and shouted,”teacher, how can this be? Now that the project was in a critical stage, if they stopped at this time, wouldn’t they give others a chance to overtake them? Moreover, I don’t think the cartoon image and name are a big problem. ”

“You think?” Wang Chi snorted coldly and said,”do you think today’s incident would still happen if it was useful?”

“But this project is the blood, sweat, and tears of our entire team for more than half a year ...” Shen Heping said in a hoarse voice.

“I’m the head of the Computer Science Institute. I have to consider this from the perspective of the entire Institute and even the entire school!” Wang Chi replied,”this matter has already been decided. I’m just informing you! All changes must be completed within a week! Before the rectification is completed, the research project’s account will be temporarily frozen, and the subsequent project funds will also stop being allocated until the rectification passes my inspection!”

Shen Heping’s face was ashen, there was no room for negotiation.

He was suddenly filled with endless hatred towards Xia ruofei, song Rui, and even song Wei ...

Wang Chi seemed to be able to see through Shen Heping’s thoughts, and he said lightly,”Shen, you used to be my best student, and now you’re the best researcher I’ve ever taken in. So, I’d like to give you a few words of advice ...”
