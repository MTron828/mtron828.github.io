2835 Utter despair (2)

“I still need your change!” The taxi driver called out.

Pablo turned a deaf ear to him as he walked hesitantly towards the newspaper building.

The taxi driver shouted a few times, but Pablo didn’t pay him any attention, so he gave up. He reached for the bill from the front passenger seat and flicked it with his finger. Then, he said to Pablo,””Thanks!”

With that, he stepped on the accelerator and drove off.

Pablo walked into the newspaper office building. His mind was blank. He didn’t even know how he had taken the elevator to the editorial office floor.

As soon as he walked into the big office, several colleagues who were on duty and those who were called back to discuss the crisis all looked up at him in unison. One of them was hirkins, who was on duty tonight.

They all looked at Pablo with complicated expressions. Some of them had pity in their eyes, while those who didn’t have a good relationship with Pablo seemed to be gloating over his misfortune.

The personal relationship between hildings and Pablo was good. After hesitating for a while, he whispered,”Pablo, the managing editor is waiting for you in the office ... You ... Be careful, he’s very angry right now!”

Pablo’s listless eyes looked at hildings, and then he nodded with a dull look. He turned and walked toward the editor-in-chief’s office opposite the big office.

Pablo knocked on the door of the managing editor’s office, and an angry voice came from inside.””Who is it?”

“Chief editor, it’s me ...” Pablo said.

After a few seconds, the door of the managing editor’s office was suddenly pulled open, revealing the bald head of the managing editor Vesco. His eyes looked as if he wanted to eat someone up as he stared at Pablo. Immediately after, a roar – like curse echoed in the office.

“Pablo! You stupid pig!” Vesco’s spittle flew as he cursed,”you F * cking messed up everything! Do you understand? Do you even have a brain? The other party had obviously dug a hole for you to jump into! You’re still so proud of yourself, you fool!”

Pablo was already numb to the storm of scolding from chief editor Wells. At this moment, his brain was basically in a state of shutdown, and he couldn’t even come up with a single explanation.

After cursing for a while, Wells ‘mouth was dry. He glared at Pablo and said,””You, come in!”

Pablo mechanically followed Wells into the office and then sat down on the sofa, his face ashen.

Wells raised his eyebrows and almost cursed out loud. Normally, if an employee came to his office and did not follow the rules, he would have kicked the employee out without mercy.

But now, Wells felt powerless. He returned to his desk and sat down. He stared at Pablo with a sharp gaze and asked,””Didn’t you tell me yesterday that you’ve found a strong witness? Now, tell me, what’s up with that Mayes?”

If Xia ruofei had not released the video that night, the video of Pablo’s interview with Mayers would have been very convincing. After all, Mayers had described the incident from the perspective of a person who had experienced it personally. Moreover, the daily sports news had quickly reposted it for Pablo.

Although the credibility of The Sports Daily was also at the toilet level, several major football newspapers in Spain had a clear bias. Simply put, they stood on the two sides of Barcelona and real Madrid, so their bias was naturally very obvious when reporting, which was not a big problem.

In any case, this was a traditional media company with a long history. They maintained a certain bias, but they still had basic credibility.

Therefore, most people chose to believe the interview video. At the same time, they also had some doubts about Ruby’s remarks at the press conference.

The video that Xia ruofei had released, which was shot by Song Wei, had clearly recorded everything that had happened at that time. It showed that Ruby had not lied. The fountain system had indeed been turned on at nokapu Stadium before the Spanish players had even left the field. And it was not what they said. The Spanish players celebrated unscrupulously in the away game and were reluctant to take a stand. Even the bar?a fans in the stands were still leaving. How could these bar?a fans be interested in watching Espanyol celebrate? Therefore, it shouldn’t have been long since the water spray system was turned on.

Since Ruby wasn’t lying, then there was something wrong with Mayers ‘interview video.

And it was not an ordinary problem. To put it bluntly, this was completely fake news. The certainty of Mayers ‘words in the video had originally provided the bar?a fans with the most powerful Cannonball for a counterattack, but now it had become the most ironic solid hammer, which could not be erased.

Pablo couldn’t help but lower his head under Wales’s burning gaze.”Mayers is indeed a year pass member of bar?a, and he’s a hardcore ...” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Who the hell asked you this?” Wells rudely interrupted Pablo and asked,”I’m asking what’s up with this interview video. Why would Mayers talk nonsense in front of the camera with such a serious face?”

Pablo trembled slightly and said,”I ... I gave him ... I gave him three hundred euros for him to do the interview according to the script I designed ...”

Wells was so angry that he wanted to pull out his gun and shoot Pablo.
