Chapter 3668: The mixed courtyard of Jianghu (2)

Translator: 549690339

Without Xia ruofei’s permission, he could not reveal Xia ruofei’s identity. Hence, he could only give an ambiguous answer.

Shen Hu couldn’t help but feel a little tired, especially since he regretted bringing Lu You along. He didn’t know if Xia ruofei would blame him. Also, he had to be careful in the next few days. If Lu You found out about Xia ruofei’s identity, he would definitely be implicated.

Shen Hu had always wanted to train Lu You to the ninth level of the aura refining realm. That way, he would be able to obtain the sect’s legacy level cultivation technique that he had been dreaming of.

However, once Xia ruofei was angry, the technique would immediately be gone.

Xia ruofei saw that Lu You was really worried and he couldn’t bear to see her like this. Hence, he transmitted his voice to Shen Hu and said,””Since Lu You has already seen me, it’s impossible to hide it from her. After all, 1 still have to observe sect leader Chen’s breakthrough tomorrow. Many cultivators are familiar with me, so it’s inevitable that we’ll greet each other. You can reveal some of my information to Lu You.”

At this point, Xia ruofei paused for a moment and then transmitted his voice seriously,””But remember, you can’t tell anyone that I’m providing her with cultivation techniques and spiritual crystals! Also, it’s best not to let her know that I’ve already reached the Golden core stage.”

Shen Hu immediately let out a breath of relief and quickly sent a message,”Alright, senior Xia! I’m sorry! This time, it’s my negligence. 1 shouldn’t have brought Lu You here.”

“Let’s not talk about this. I just don’t want Lu You to feel that she owes me a favor. It’s actually nothing much even if she knows.” Xia ruofei transmitted his voice.”Alright, I’ll leave after sitting for a while. You can reveal some information to Lu You later!”

“I understand, senior Xia!” Shen Hu sent.

The two of them were communicating telepathically right under Lu You’s nose, but Lu You, a low – Level Qi refinement cultivator, did not notice anything at all.

She only felt that the atmosphere was a little awkward. Everyone suddenly stopped talking, and only Shen Hu was still making tea.

Just as Lu You was about to say something, Shen Hu had already finished brewing the tea. He poured three cups and placed one in front of Xia ruofei. He smiled and said,””Mr. Xia, try the tea I made! This is rock tea given to me by a friend from Mount Wu Yi. It is said that the quality is not bad, but my tea – making skills are a little rusty. It might not be able to catch Mr. Xia’s eye.”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Sect Master Shen’s tea – making technique is as smooth as floating clouds and flowing water. It also fits the way of nature. One look and I can tell that you’re an expert in the Way of Tea. You’re being a little too humble!”

“I don’t deserve such a high evaluation!” Shen Hu said hurriedly. Then, he handed another cup of tea to Lu You and said with a smile,”Lu You, try it too!”

Lu You was a little overwhelmed by the favor and quickly said,””Thank you, teacher!”

Lu You used to be a proud girl. Her superior family environment had shaped her character. However, after she entered the world of cultivation by accident, she was like an ignorant child who had entered a completely unfamiliar world. Her character had changed a lot, especially after she realized that her strength was low.

Xia ruofei took a sip of the tea and closed his eyes to enjoy the aftertaste. He then opened his eyes and gave Shen Hu a thumbs up.”The fragrance of the tea is overflowing, leaving a fragrance in the mouth. Sect Master Shen is a person who knows how to live!”

“To be able to receive such a high evaluation from Mr. Xia, I’m really a little scared!” Shen Hu said happily.

The three of them chatted as they sipped their tea. The topic of their conversation did not involve much of the cultivation world. After all, Lu You was present, and Shen Hu was not sure what he should or should not say.

However, Shen Hu had always lived in United Kingdom, and the water element sect was not completely isolated from the world. The sect was located in a Manor, and he even held a position in the local Chinese society. Therefore, he was very familiar with modern society and was able to make sense of some of the topics when he talked about them. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

After sitting for a while, Xia ruofei stood up and said,””Sect Master Shen, I’ve disturbed you for so long. I should go back now.”

“Mr. Xia, aren’t you going to stay a little longer?” Shen Hu also stood up and said.

“No, it’s almost lunch time.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I should go back too.”

“Alright, I’ll see you out, Mr. Xia.” Shen Hu said.

Lu You hesitated for a moment and said,”ruofei, you live in that courtyard. 1’11 send you there.” If you go to the wrong place, the consequences might be very serious.”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I live nearby.” Don’t worry! I’m already an adult, and there’s only one way to go there. How could I get lost? I promise I’ll go back directly and won’t run around, okay?”

“Lu You, don’t worry so much. Mr. Xia knows what he’s doing,” Shen Hu said.

“Yes, teacher!” Lu You said helplessly.

She thought for a moment and immediately said,”that’s right, RUO Fei, wait a moment!” I have something to give you!”

“What are you giving me?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

Lu You did not answer Xia ruofei’s question. Instead, she looked at Shen Hu and asked respectfully,””Teacher, this disciple wants to give the good fortune pill you gave me to RUO Fei, is that okay?”

Shen Hu didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. The healthy fortune pill was actually a pill that strengthened the body, but it was still thousands of miles away from a real pill. If Shen Hu, a ninth Qi layer cultivator, could refine a pill, how good could its effects be? It wasn’t even good enough for a golden core cultivator like Xia ruofei to eat!

Of course, the prosperous pill was also considered a good item in the water Yuan sect. Generally, only the most outstanding disciples would be rewarded with it. Moreover, it had a certain effect on low – Level Qi refining cultivators. For ordinary people who had not cultivated, it could be considered a great tonic, more effective than any precious tonic on the market.

Lu You must have considered that Xia ruofei was not a cultivator and that taking the pill would be beneficial to his body. That was why she thought of giving the pill to Xia ruofei.

However, Shen Hu was the one who had given her the pill. Now that she wanted to give it to Xia ruofei in front of Shen Hu, she had to ask for his opinion. 0then-vise, it would be a little disrespectful.

Shen Hu couldn’t show it and could only nod,”Of course you can. What I’ve already given you is yours. It’s up to you how you want to deal with it.”

“Thank you, teacher!” Lu You said happily.

Then, she turned to Xia ruofei and said,”ruofei, wait for me!” It’s in the room next door, it’ll be quick!”

After saying that, Lu You quickly walked out of Shen Hu’s room and went to the next room.

Xia ruofei looked at Shen Hu and asked,””What’s a good fortune pill?”

Shen Hu awkwardly explained the situation of the Blessed health pill to Xia ruofei, and then said in a low voice, “I’ve embarrassed myself in front of senior Xia …”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,””This is also Lu You’s kind intentions! 1 thought about it just now. You can tell Lu You this …”

Just as Xia ruofei said this, he heard a sharp voice from the next room.””Who let you in! Don’t you know that I’m cultivating? Can you bear the responsibility for disturbing my cultivation?”

Xia ruofei could not help but frown and walked out. Shen Hu’s expression also changed slightly and he quickly followed.

“Senior Sister Lu, I’m only here to take something…” Lu You said from the room.

“Just because I took something, I can just randomly barge in? If I had been disturbed by you just now and suffered from Qi deviation, how many lives would you have to pay for it?” The female cultivator surnamed Lu snorted and said,”get out!”

“You …” Lu You was obviously a little angry, but she held it in. She restrained herself and said,”I’ll leave after I take the things …”

“I told you to get out now! Don’t you understand human language?” The female cultivator surnamed Lu snorted.

Lu You couldn’t help but say,’Senior Sister Lu, aren’t you going a little too far? This is also my room, and we’re all guests at the first heaven society. Can’t 1 even go into my room to get my things?”

“Tsk, a puny cultivator dares to call himself a guest of the first heaven society?” The female cultivator surnamed Lu said disdainfully,”I’ll give you one last chance.. Are you going to get lost or not? Don’t force me to throw you out, otherwise, it won’t look good for your sect leader Shen!”
