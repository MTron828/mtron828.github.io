Translator: 549690339

No matter how he looked at it, this King’s Green square card was almost perfect.

Although the photos could not be completely verified, MA Xiong knew that Xia ruofei would not joke about this.

Therefore, even though he had not seen it with his own eyes, MA Xiong had already made his own judgment.

Xia ruofei smiled calmly and said,””I don’t know much about Jade, but my friend said that this jade square plate should be a glass type of King’s Green. It was made in the late Qing Dynasty and has a certain cultural value.”

MA Xiong’s breathing became a little short. As a giant in the jewelry industry, he had naturally handled a lot of King’s Green. However, the king’s Green of the glass type was extremely rare. Even a small pendant would cause a fierce competition every time it appeared in an auction. Almost every piece could be sold for a sky – High price.

Moreover, this jade square plate was so thick and heavy. It was of great color and quality, and it even had a certain cultural value, which made MA Xiong’s heart beat faster.

“Mr. MA, I wonder if you are interested in this jade square plate?” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”do you want to see the real thing?”

“I’m interested! I’m so interested!” MA Xiong said without hesitation,”I’ll arrange a flight right away. We’ll fly to Sanshan tonight!”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”there’s no hurry. If you want to see the real thing, you can come over tomorrow morning. You’re the only person I’ve contacted so far!”

“Xia Sheng, thank you so much!” MA Xiong said happily.

“Oh, by the way, Mr. MA, I’m not in San Shan right now. I’m in Beijing!” Xia ruofei quickly reminded him,”you can go directly to Jing Hilton in the capital tomorrow!” I’m staying in this hotel!”

“Alright, alright, alright!” MA Xiong said,”Xia Sheng, you have to keep this King’s Green square tile for me!”

“Don’t worry!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

MA Xiong really liked the king’s Green square plate, but he was still worried. If Xia ruofei had not promised not to sell it to anyone before he arrived in the capital, he would have rushed over tonight.

......

The next day, the heavens were more lenient. After a light drizzle yesterday, the sun was shining brightly. Feng Jing brought Duff and the film crew to the set in the suburbs.

Zhao Yongjun had contacted his friends. He was going to visit in the morning, but Xia ruofei had a meeting with MA Xiong, so he pushed the meeting to the afternoon.

Zhao Yongjun heard that Xia ruofei had contacted the buyer of the square plate. He was worried that Xia ruofei would lose out because he didn’t know the market, so he insisted on staying in the hotel to help Xia ruofei.

Song Rui, who liked to join in the fun, would not miss such an event. He also stayed in the hotel.

After having breakfast at the buffet restaurant, the two of them went into Xia ruofei’s room.

Initially, Xia ruofei wanted to pick MA Xiong up from the airport, but the old man politely declined. The two of them then agreed to meet at the hotel.

MA Xiong took his private jet from Hong Kong early in the morning. According to the flight route information provided by MA Xiong, he would land in Beijing around nineo’ clock.

At half – past nine, Xia ruofei saw that it was about time, so he brought Zhao Yongjun and song Rui downstairs to the hotel lobby.

After all, MA Xiong was a world – Class tycoon. It was fine if he didn’t pick them up at the airport, but it would be rude if he didn’t even go downstairs and just waited in his room.

The three of them sat in the lobby for a while before they saw a black Mercedes – Benz spint luxury nanny van drive into the hotel lobby.

“RUO Fei, is it the person you’re meeting?” Song Rui poked Xia ruofei’s shoulder and asked. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Xia ruofei looked up and saw the electric door of the car open slowly. He saw MA Xiong getting out of the car.

“It’s them!” Xia ruofei stood up with a smile and walked towards MA Xiong.
