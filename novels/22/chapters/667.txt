Chapter 668: Attending the banquet (2)

Medicine nowadays liked to create some gimmicks, and they would not stop until they were shocking.

Strictly speaking, this was against the rules, but the department in charge turned a blind eye to it. He kun was very clear about this.

At around 11:30 in the afternoon, Xia ruofei’s flight landed smoothly on the runway of the Capital International Airport.

When they left the airport, they saw the staff from the Beijing office of Sanshan city waiting by the side of the road with their cars.

Although he kun had already been transferred to the provincial Bureau, he had worked in Sanshan city for many years. Moreover, he was Tian Huilan’s direct subordinate, so he liked to coordinate with the Sanshan City office in Beijing to receive him every time he came to Beijing.

Everyone took the Beijing office’s car and quickly arrived at the Rongcheng hotel near the capital’s East Fourth Ring Road. The hotel was located in San Shan city.

The rooms had already been arranged. Xia ruofei and he kun were in small business suites, while he kun’s Secretary was in an ordinary King – sized room next to he kun ‘s, so that he could be on call when the leader called.

When they arrived at the floor of the room, he kun said affectionately,””Brother Xia, go back to your room and wash up. We’ll settle our lunch at the Chengdu hotel.”

“Sure, big brother he, I’ll see you later!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

After the long conversation on the plane and he kun’s deliberate approach to Xia ruofei, the two of them had become more intimate.

Xia ruofei returned to his room and took a quick shower. He changed into a clean, casual suit and went to the balcony to smoke a cigarette. Just then, the doorbell rang.

He kun’s Secretary had come to invite Xia ruofei to lunch.

In the afternoon, he kun ordered a lot of Beijing specialties in a small room on the second floor of the Chengdu hotel. To Xia ruofei’s surprise, they had Drunken Eight Immortals for lunch. Furthermore, it was the three months white wine that had just been launched on the market.

......

It seemed that the Drunken Eight Immortals wine had also entered the sights of the three mountains ‘office in the capital, and was used as a specialty wine of the southeast province to receive guests.

He kun raised his glass and said with a smile,””Brother Xia, let’s have a toast! In the afternoon, you can take a rest in the room or walk around. If you need a car, just let the front desk know. I’ll show off at the seminar this afternoon, and I’ll have dinner with a few acquaintances from the State Food and Drug Administration at night. We’ve known each other for many years, so if you make a few more toasts, this matter might be settled. ”

This kind of seminar was very common. As the Deputy Director of the provincial Bureau, he kun was already very respectful to attend. Therefore, he would only show his face at the opening meeting and would definitely not participate in the group discussions and exchanges after that.

After all, the main purpose of this trip to the capital was to help Xia ruofei.

“Okay, brother he, I’ll leave it to you ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

As he kun had a seminar to attend in the afternoon, they did not drink too much and only had a light sip.

Soon, lunch was over and Xia ruofei returned to his room upstairs.

Although he had not visited the Forbidden City or the Great Wall of China, he was not in the mood to go out for a stroll since he had not finished his business. Besides, he only had one afternoon. With the traffic conditions in the capital, he probably would not be able to go anywhere.

After Xia ruofei returned to his room, he took out his phone and called Xue Jinshan.

“President Xia, you’ve arrived in Beijing?” Xue Jinshan’s voice carried a trace of excitement.

Xia ruofei had told Xue Jinshan yesterday that he would personally go to Beijing to coordinate the project.

“Hmm, Kanayama, what’s the progress now?” Xia ruofei asked,”have you handed in the materials?”

“President Xia, it’s too hard to get into the National Ministry ...” Xue Jinshan smiled bitterly.”We’ve been here for a few days and finally submitted the application materials to the pharmaceutical and cosmetics registration Division after a lot of effort. However, we’ve been to the division several times, and they said that it hasn’t been accepted yet. We don’t know how long it will take ...”

Xue Jinshan was also feeling very depressed. He had personally witnessed the effects of the heart – nourishing soup, and it was definitely a blessing for the majority of people with autism. If it could be mass produced as soon as possible, it could be said to have a revolutionary change for the treatment of autism.

However, there was no other way. To the National Ministry, it might be a big deal in your eyes, but it was insignificant to them.

If they were to strictly follow the stipulated number of working days for each segment, it would really take a long time before they could approve the production and sell it on the market. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”Kanayama, good things take more time!” Don’t worry ... How about this, bureau chief he of the provincial Bureau is hosting a banquet for the comrades from the State Food and Drug Administration tonight. You guys should come along! It’s also good to know a few more people and coordinate approval in the future. ”

“CEO Xia, you have a way!” Xue Jinshan said excitedly,”chief Xia, it would be great if we could find someone we know in the State Food and Drug Administration!”

“I’ll give you a call after I’ve decided on the place. You two can take a taxi there together,”Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Alright, alright!” Xue Jinshan quickly said.

After Xia ruofei hung up the phone, he thought for a while and sent he kun a text message, telling him that a few of his company’s employees who were in charge of this project would be attending the dinner.

He kun, who was in the middle of a seminar, sent Xia ruofei a text message after half an hour.

He kun naturally had no objections to having more people attend. He kun even sent the location of the banquet to Xia ruofei in advance.

Xia ruofei took a look and saw that it was in an alley near the Rongcheng hotel. It was called “Royal private kitchen”.

Hence, Xia ruofei casually forwarded the location and room number to Xue Jinshan.

He took a nap in the hotel room and got up at around 5:30 to pack his things. He kun’s Secretary came over to remind Xia ruofei to get ready to leave.

The group took a Buick minivan from the Beijing office and made a few turns in the nearby alleys. Soon, they arrived at an antique courtyard house.

This was where the “royal family’s private kitchen” was located.

The courtyard house was the kind that had a few front and back entrances. Antique lanterns were hung at the door, and the copper nails on the door were bright and shiny. One look and one could tell that it was expensive.

Xue Jinshan had already brought two Research Institute employees to the royal family’s private kitchen in advance.

The two employees were a man and a woman.

The girl’s name was Bai He, and she was as beautiful and refined as her name suggested, giving off a refreshing feeling.

The boy’s name was Zhou Qing. Although he still had a childish look on his face, he was quite capable among the staff of the Research Institute and was quite valued by Xue Jinshan.

The two of them were both undergraduate students, so they were somewhat nervous in this kind of situation.

When Xue Jinshan saw Xia ruofei and the rest, he quickly went up to them and said,””President Xia.”

“Jinshan, this is chief he kun of the provincial Drug Administration,” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Xue Jinshan and the other two quickly greeted he kun respectfully.

For Xia ruofei’s sake, or more accurately, for Tian Huilan’s sake, he kun’s attitude was very kind. He chuckled and exchanged a few simple words with the three of them.

Then, he kun said,”brother Xia, let’s go to the private room and wait!” Section Chief Qi and the others got off work at FiveO’ clock sharp, but the traffic in Beijing is very bad during the evening peak hour, so it’ll probably take a while for them to arrive!”

“It’s fine. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”brother he, let’s go in first!”

From he kun’s tone, Xia ruofei could tell that he had invited a Section Chief. Although he was a cadre of the National Ministry, he knew that he kun, a Deputy department head, would not have to wait in the lobby respectfully.

The group of people arrived at an antique private room.

Xia ruofei had thought that he would only have to wait for half an hour or an hour. Since he was asking for help, it didn’t matter if the other party was late.

He did not expect to wait for more than two hours.

At around 8:30 pm, after he kun made two phone calls, three people finally appeared at the door of the private room.

What made Xia ruofei frown was that the three of them seemed to be walking on air, and they reeked of alcohol ...
