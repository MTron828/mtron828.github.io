2410 A strategy (2)

Xia ruofei looked at his watch. It was around 7:30 in the evening. According to elder song’s daily routine, he should not be asleep yet.

So he took out his phone, found the number of elder song’s personal secretary, manager Lu, and called.

Since he had already made a decision, he should not drag things out or hesitate.

This had always been Xia ruofei’s way of doing things.

Manager Lu picked up the phone quickly and said enthusiastically,””RUO Fei, how are you?”

“Good day, manager Lu!” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”may I ask if Grandpa song is resting now?”

“The chief is still reading.” Manager Lu said,”do you need me to get him to answer the phone?”

Manager Lu knew very well that something must have happened for Xia ruofei to call at this time.

Xia ruofei said,”manager Lu, it’s an important matter. If it’s convenient for Grandpa song, I’d like to come over and report to him in person.” Why don’t ... I trouble you to ask him for instructions?”

Manager Lu was slightly taken aback. At this time, even if Xia ruofei had something to say, he would have said it tomorrow. Since he wanted to report it overnight, it must be very important.

However, manager Lu couldn’t make the decision for elder song. He said,””No problem! I’ll go ask the Chief for instructions immediately. I don’t think he’ll refuse. Ruofei, to save time, I suggest you leave now. I’ll call you as soon as I have any news. ”

Elder song usually went back to his room to rest at eighto’ clock or nineo’ clock at the latest, so the departure time was a little tight now. Of course, this was not absolute. If the matter was really important, what was the big deal with resting a little later?

Manager Lu only made this suggestion because he treated Xia ruofei as one of his own. If it was someone else, he would not have meddled in their business! Of course, it was almost impossible for the others to get an audience with elder song at this time.

“I understand! Thank you, manager Lu! Then I’ll set off now!” Xia ruofei said.

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei did not call Wu Qiang. Instead, he went straight to the garage in the backyard and drove the Land Rover out of the siheyuan. He headed in the direction of the song family’s old residence.

In the song family’s residence, manager Lu walked quietly to the study and bowed slightly.””Chief, RUO Fei just called. He said that he has something very important to report to you tonight.”

Elder song raised his eyebrows and put down his thread – bound book. At the same time, he took off his reading glasses.

He laughed and said,”this little guy has been in Beijing for so many days, but he only came to see me once in the first two days. Then, he disappeared!” Why are you suddenly so late today?”

Manager Lu wasn’t sure of elder song’s thoughts, but he couldn’t just ignore it. He could only say with a trace of hesitation,”Then ... Should I reject him? Just tell him that you’re going to rest, and let him ...”

“There’s no need. “Elder song waved his hand. RUO Fei knew his limits. Since he insisted on coming over so late at night, it showed that the matter was indeed very important. Besides ... I treat this little guy like my grandson. Which grandson would want to see his grandfather? it depends on the time. ”

Manager Lu couldn’t help but feel envious of Xia ruofei. He quickly said,””Understood, I’ll inform him immediately!”

“En,” eccentric song nodded and said,”personally inform the sentries outside.”

“Yes!” Manager Lu said.

……

Half an hour later, Xia ruofei appeared in elder song’s study. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Grandpa song!” Xia ruofei called out and then said,”it’s so late ... Will it disturb your rest?”

Eccentric song chuckled and waved his hand. “I’m fine! My body is very strong now, and I’m full of energy! Sit down!”

Xia ruofei sat down opposite elder song.

At this moment, manager Lu personally brought Xia ruofei a cup of tea. Xia ruofei quickly stood up and said,””Manager Lu, how could I trouble you to personally pour the water?”

Manager Lu’s rank was at least that of a provincial official. Xia ruofei naturally could not treat him as an ordinary Secretary.

Of course, manager Lu only served Xia ruofei personally to show his closeness. There were many staff members in the song family, so it was not up to him, the Butler, to serve the tea.

“We’re all family, no need to be so polite!”Manager Lu smiled.

Manager Lu then turned to elder song and said,””Chief, you guys take your time to chat. I’ll go down first!”

Elder song looked at Xia ruofei and saw that he had no intention of asking manager Lu to stay. He nodded and said,””Alright, Xiao Lu, you can go and rest! I don’t have anything to do tonight. ”

“Yes, chief!” Manager Lu replied.

Then, he nodded at Xia ruofei and closed the door of the study.

Although he responded quickly, he would be on standby as long as elder song was still awake.

After manager Lu left, elder song smiled at Xia ruofei and said,””Ruofei, tell me! What’s so important that even Xiao Lu can’t hear it ...”

Xia ruofei scratched his head in embarrassment. He had no intention of hiding it from manager Lu. It was just that this matter was indeed shocking and he had to keep it to the minimum.

He organized his words in his mind and said,””Grandpa song, it’s like this ... I’ve found the mastermind behind the assassination of Secretary song, but this matter has a lot of implications and I can’t make a decision, so I wanted to ask you for advice.”

Eccentric song couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows and sit up straight.”Tell me the details!”

“Yes!” Xia ruofei said,”according to my investigation, the person who killed Secretary song is from an assassin organization called mord. After following the clues, I finally found out that ... The person who hired this assassin organization to kill Secretary song was ... Was ... Liu haojun! He first passed ...”

“Wait!” Elder song waved his hand and asked with a serious look,”the Liu haojun you’re talking about ... Is He Liu Qunfeng’s son?”

He wasn’t very familiar with the younger generation of the Liu family, but Liu haojun had just gotten into an accident some time ago, so he still had a deep impression of him.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” He was currently out of town, working in one of the Liu family’s holding companies. He was the one who connected the company’s computer to the internet and posted the mission on the secret forum of the Morde mercenary group. Then, he used his Switzerland bank account to transfer the deposit to the Morde mercenary group. ”

Then, Xia ruofei took out a stack of printed photos from his bag and handed them to elder song.”These were all found through technical means, and they basically formed a complete chain of evidence. We can confirm that the mastermind behind this incident is Liu haojun!”

Elder song immediately took the stack of photos, put on his reading glasses, and looked at them carefully.

Xia ruofei had taken screenshots from Manzila’s computer and printed them out. There were records of the modr organization’s website, including the IP address of the order and the messages left by the customers. There was also the actual address and bank account information that was traced according to the fixed IP.

While elder song was looking at the pictures, Xia ruofei explained,””This is the actual address that was determined based on the IP address. Liu haojun was just assigned to work there by the Liu family not long ago ... The bank account he made the payment to is called ‘MR LIU’!”

Elder song’s heart was in turmoil. If these pictures were not photoshopped, then this evidence alone was enough to prove that the person who assassinated song Qiming was Liu haojun!

It could be said to be an irrefutable evidence!

Of course, elder song also believed that Xia ruofei would not use the photoshopped picture to frame Liu haojun. Even if Liu haojun and Xia ruofei had a deep conflict, elder song believed in Xia ruofei’s character and thought that he would never do that.

Besides, it was easy to find out that the photos were fake. Xia ruofei would not make such a low – Level mistake.

Therefore, elder song didn’t doubt the authenticity of the picture at all.

After he finished looking at the last picture, he couldn’t help but slam the stack of pictures on the desk and said angrily,””He’s really too Savage!”
