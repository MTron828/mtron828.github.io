“Ah?” Wu Qiang was stunned.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”what” ah “? Did you forget that you’re also my driver? You have to help me take care of this car!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Xia ruofei had spent less than 140 million on this courtyard house. With all the taxes and handling fees, he still had more than 40 million left from the sale of the king’s Green square plate. Considering that it would be more convenient to have a car when he came to the capital in the future, Xia ruofei simply bought a Land Rover.

Xia ruofei had bought a Range Rover that cost more than three million Yuan. If he could get the car immediately, he must have found someone.

That day, song Rui had invited a group of friends to introduce him to Xia ruofei. One of them was a guy named Wang Yuan. His father was from the customs bureau. Wang Yuan had opened several high – end imported car stores in the capital. When Xia ruofei wanted to buy a car, he thought of him first.

When Wang Yuan heard that Xia ruofei wanted to buy a land Rover, he went to the car shop in person and gave Xia ruofei the only existing car. He even gave him a 10% discount on the total price and gave him a lot of car supplies such as film filters, floor mats, dashcam, and so on.

It took time to get the license plate, but Wang Yuan got a temporary license plate for Xia ruofei as fast as he could. Xia ruofei drove the car back directly after sticking it on.

Xia ruofei smiled at Wu Qiang.”Wu Qiang, someone will send over the official license plate and the relevant documents in a few days. If I’m not home, remember to keep it well.”

“Okay, boss!” Wu Qiang quickly said.

“Alright, I’ll leave this car to you!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll leave the usual maintenance and cleaning to you.”

“Don’t worry, boss. I’ll take good care of the car!” Wu Qiang said.

“En!” Xia ruofei nodded.”When I’m not in the capital, you can use it if you need it. Do your best and remember to issue an invoice. I’ll reimburse you later!”

Wu Qiang was taken aback and quickly said,””Boss, I can’t touch such a good car. I’ll be your driver when you need me!”

“What do you mean by that!” Xia ruofei said,”didn’t you buy a car to drive? If I didn’t come to Beijing for a few months, this car would have broken down! I should use it!”

“This ...” Wu Qiang hesitated for a moment and said,”I understand, boss!”

He was very touched.

Not only did Xia ruofei give him an advance on his salary, but he also gave him the right to manage the luxury car that was worth millions. The value of the furniture and household appliances in such a large courtyard house was not low. Xia ruofei also gave him all the authority.

It was because he was a retired soldier under Zhao Yongjun.

This was the boss’s trust in Him. He also secretly decided in his heart that he must not betray the boss’s trust.

In fact, this was Xia ruofei’s personality. He would not doubt the person he used and would not use the person he suspected.

Xia ruofei had always given special treatment to the Veterans who had military experience.

Seeing that Xia ruofei trusted him so much, Wu Qiang was touched and secretly reminded himself to be careful of his actions. For example, this car. Although the boss said that he could use it if he needed it, he had to know when to advance and when to retreat. He must not treat this car as his and drive it around when the boss was not in the capital.

If the boss was worried that the car would not be good if it was left for too long, then he would drive it out regularly and do the maintenance on time. As for other times, he must not touch the car.

Naturally, Xia ruofei did not know about Wu Qiang’s thoughts. After he passed the car keys to Wu Qiang, he did not care about this matter anymore.

......

Xia ruofei stayed in the capital for another two days before returning to the three mountains.

Originally, Xia ruofei wanted to stay for a few more days. The days in the courtyard were quite leisurely. Every day, he would make tea and drink wine. When he was free, he could watch a big movie in the huge Music Hall or go to Houhai to Xuanji Bay. It was very comfortable.

After all, she didn’t have to worry much about the company’s Affairs. Although Feng Jing stayed in the capital to prepare for the jaded skin cream advertisement, she would handle all the company’s Affairs remotely, big and small, so everything was in order.

However, the renovation of the courtyard house would begin in two days. Xia ruofei did not want to continue living in the courtyard that was full of noise and people.

The key was that song Rui could not wait any longer.

He and Zhuo Yiyi still had not made any substantial progress, so he called a few times a day to urge Xia ruofei to return to the three mountains as soon as possible so that he could help him inform Song Wei and “indirectly save the country”.

Xia ruofei couldn’t take it anymore. He finally packed up and prepared to return to the three mountains.

Initially, Xia ruofei wanted to let Feng Jing stay in the courtyard house. However, since the construction of the courtyard house had started and Feng Jing was staying in the hotel with the main team, it would be more convenient for her to work. Hence, he decided not to.

Staying in a hotel didn’t cost much anyway, and Xia ruofei really didn’t lack money.

Before he left, Xia ruofei went to the song family’s old house.

On one hand, it was to say goodbye to elder song. On the other hand, the Jade skin cream that he gave song Zhilan previously was very well received. Song Zhilan personally called Xia ruofei and expressed that she wanted to take a few more portions. She was a little embarrassed to say that she kept three of the ten portions that Wanwan had given her and gave the rest to the upper – Class ladies.

This was what Xia ruofei wanted to see. Before the product was released, it would be difficult for it not to become popular if it made a name for itself in the upper class.
