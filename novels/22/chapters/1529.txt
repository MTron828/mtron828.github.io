Xia ruofei quickly put on his Bluetooth and answered the call.””Mr. MA!”

“Xia Sheng, I’m sorry! Sorry to keep you waiting. ” Ma Zhiming said,”it’s mainly because it’s a little late, so it’s not convenient to contact friends.”

Xia ruofei smiled.”I should be the one to say sorry. It’s already so late. I’m still disturbing you and your friend.”

“Xia Sheng, don’t be so polite!” Ma Zhiming quickly said,”xiasheng, I’ve contacted a few good friends, and one of them happens to be participating in the public Jade bid in Ruizhou city in Dian province. Ruizhou is close to the China – Myanmar border, so it’s very convenient to buy jade there. My friend is quite popular in Ruizhou, and he will help you settle the matter of raw jade materials.”

“I’m really grateful!” Xia ruofei said,”Mr. MA, thank you so much for this!”

To be honest, Xia ruofei was very touched that Ma Zhiming could be woken up by a phone call in the middle of the night and immediately spare no effort to ask his friend for help.

“You’re welcome, you’re welcome ...” Ma Zhiming said with a smile.”I’ll send you the contact information of my friend later.” It just so happens that there’s a rather large public Jade bid in Ruizhou these few days. If Xia Sheng is interested, you can go and have a look!”

“Alright, alright.” Xia ruofei said,”then I’ll fly directly to Spring City tomorrow!”

Ma Zhiming quickly said,”Xia Sheng, the nearest airport to Ruizhou city is not in Chun city, but in Hongzhou. I just checked the flights for you. There’s a direct flight from Tanzhou to Hongzhou at 10 a.m. Tomorrow. I’ve already booked a ticket for you. You can go directly to the airport tomorrow!”

“This ...” Xia ruofei was so touched that he didn’t know what to say.

This service was too thoughtful!

“My family’s plane just so happens to be in use, otherwise I would have been directly transferred to tan Zhou to serve you tonight!” Ma Zhiming explained.

“No, no, no, Mr. MA, I’m already embarrassed. Actually, I can book my own ticket ...” Xia ruofei said.

Ma Zhiming laughed and said,”Xia Sheng, you don’t have to be so polite with me!” By the way, do you have any friends who want to go with you? I’ll help you book the tickets. ”

“No, no, I’m alone!” Xia ruofei quickly said.

“Alright, I’ll send you my friend’s contact information later!” Ma Zhiming said.

“Alright! Mr. MA, then you should rest early too!” Xia ruofei said.

After hanging up, Xia ruofei took off his Bluetooth headset and threw it in front of the dashboard. He felt a wave of emotion in his heart. The MA family really had nothing to say about him. Whether they were doing it to repay his kindness or for other reasons, Xia ruofei was still indebted to him.

When Xia ruofei arrived at tan Zhou, it was already half past two in the morning.

He decided not to look for a hotel and parked his car near the car rental office. Then, he took out a blanket from the spirit map space and got into the back seat to sleep for a while.

The main reason was that he had already placed Song Wei in the spirit map space. There was no need for him to go through all that trouble alone.

Speaking of which, these conditions were already very good. When Xia ruofei was a soldier, he would often wear a raincoat in the wilderness and sleep soundly. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Xia ruofei woke up at eight in the morning.

He took out some toothpaste, a toothbrush, and a towel from his interspace. He also fetched a basin of spiritual pond water and got out of the car to wash up by the roadside.

Then, Xia ruofei packed up his things and put everything in the car into the spirit map space.

Xia ruofei looked at the time. The car rental office should be open for work, so he drove over and returned the car as fast as he could.

After finishing the procedures, Xia ruofei hailed a cab at the door of the car rental office and headed straight to Tanzhou airport.

The flight that Ma Zhiming had booked for him would take off at 10:35. It was just 9:30 when he arrived at the airport, so he had plenty of time.

Xia ruofei went straight to the check – in counter to change his boarding pass. As expected, Ma Zhiming booked him a first – Class seat. Very soon, a dedicated attendant led Xia ruofei through the security check through the VIP passage and brought him to the VIP lounge.

There was still some time before boarding. Out of habit, Xia ruofei took out his phone to check the news.

Just as he was about to light up his phone screen, he suddenly thought of something. It had been more than a day since Song Wei had entered the underground palace. During this time, her family and friends might contact her. If she did not reply, they would be worried.

If song Qiming found out that he had lost contact with his precious daughter, he would definitely use his connections to look for her.

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei could not sit still.

He furrowed his brows and pondered for a moment before he made a decision and sent his divine sense into the spirit map space.

Mountain sea realm, in the stone chamber in the cave.

A phone slowly appeared from Song Wei’s pocket and floated beside her. She used an invisible force to touch the power button and the phone screen lit up.

Xia ruofei thought to himself,”luckily, Song Wei’s phone has good battery life.”

Of course, what made Xia ruofei even happier was that Song Wei’s phone could be unlocked with a fingerprint. If it was unlocked with a password, he could only stare at it helplessly.

Xia ruofei thought to himself,”Song Wei, this is an emergency. Please don’t blame me for taking your phone!”

As he thought, he controlled the invisible spatial power.
