Chapter 3446: Each for their own battle (2)

Translator: 549690339

As long as a cultivator could pass this checkpoint named “Stairway to Heaven”, it was equivalent to clearing the Tower of Trials mission.

The top floor of the Tower of Trials was a place to enjoy the joy of victory, and also a place to receive rewards.

This was good news because Xia ruofei was prepared for a tougher test.

However, the most headache – inducing part was that the two of them had to take the test separately.

Xia ruofei read the contents of the stone tablet twice before he said to Ling Qingxue,””What a lousy design! Since I’ve passed the test and was lucky enough to draw you to my side, we should have been together all along! How can you separate us like this?”

Ling Qingxue was in a good mood. She laughed and said,””Ruofei, that’s enough! I’ve already exceeded my mission by hitchhilating him! It’s impossible for me to reach such a high floor by myself! And 1 even got a treasure like the heavenly cloud Palace! Even if I’m eliminated from this round, it’s worth it!”

“I’m just worried about the danger. If I’m not by your side …”Xia ruofei frowned.

“It’s fine! Don’t forget that I’m also a cultivator. If I’m always under your protection, what’s the point of me increasing my cultivation?” Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”I still need to experience some setbacks and dangers before 1 can improve!”

Xia ruofei was frowning. He was most worried that Ling Qingxue would be in danger during the mission, and he would be unable to save her.

If the two of them were together, Xia ruofei was confident that he could ensure Ling Qingxue’s safety no matter how difficult the environment was. However, if they were separated, it would be hard to say. It seemed that the two steps were not far apart, but Xia ruofei could not guarantee that there would be no spatial barrier between the two steps. Even if they were very close, Xia ruofei would not be able to use the spirit map scroll to directly suck Ling Qingxue into the space for protection since they were in two different spaces.

He could only watch as Ling Qingxue dealt with the situation on her own.

However, the rules were set by others. Since he was in the trial Pagoda, he could only follow the rules set by others.

Xia ruofei could not change this.

Xia ruofei couldn’t be so arrogant as to try to break through the barriers set up by the senior Almighty. He could only complete the task according to the requirements.

He considered for a long time and finally smiled bitterly.””Since that’s the case, we have no choice but to follow the rules … Qingxue, get ready. Let’s start the climb!”

“Right, I’ll give you a few Jade talismans!” As Xia ruofei spoke, he took out a few Jade talismans from the spirit map space and handed them to Ling Qingxue.’These are one – time protective talismans. They can basically block an attack from an intermediate golden core cultivator. 1 only have these on me. I’ll give them all to you. Wear them on your body. If there’s any danger, they will automatically protect you!”

“Don’t give me all of it!” Ling Qingxue said,”your path is definitely more dangerous. You should keep a few for self – Protection!”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand,”this is useless to me.” I can even easily withstand the full power of an intermediate Aurous core cultivator. If it’s an even more powerful attack, this protective jade talisman will have no effect. So, I won’t keep it, I’ll give it all to you!”

When Ling Qingxue heard this, she felt that it made sense.

Hence, she did not decline and reached out to take the Jade talismans that Xia ruofei handed to her.

Ling Qingxue didn’t put the Jade talismans into her storage ring. Once she did, they would just be normal items without any protection.

Therefore, she carefully put these Jade talismans on her body.

Xia ruofei thought for a while. He could only help Ling Qingxue this much. There were also other talismans that could be used for protection, but Ling Qingxue knew almost nothing about arrays. Even if he gave her talismans, she would not know how to use them.

Hence, Xia ruofei made up his mind and said,””Qingxue, you can only rely on yourself from now on! Let’s go! Let’s go and challenge this heavenly stairs!”

With that, Xia ruofei prepared to walk to the left and climb the Obsidian stairs marked with “Jindan”.

However, Ling Qingxue reached out to hold him back. She smiled and said,””RUO Fei, wait for me this time. Let me try it first!”

Xia ruofei was stunned and confused. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“If the two of us were to challenge it together … 1 don’t know if we would be able to see each other, but if we could still see each other’s condition from the stairway, I’m worried that it would affect each other …” Ling Qingxue explained with a smile.

Xia ruofei immediately understood. Actually, Ling Qingxue was still worried that it would affect her. After all, both of them knew that Ling Qingxue’s chances of passing this stage were not high. If Xia ruofei saw Ling Qingxue’s dangerous situation on the stairway, he would inevitably be affected and would not be able to concentrate on passing the stage. This could lead to serious consequences.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”Qingxue, if you’re thinking about it this way, then … 1’11 go and explore first!” Just watch from the side, it might have some reference value for you!”

Ling Qingxue held Xia ruofei’s hand tightly and shook her head firmly.””!’!! go first! If I stay here, you’ll definitely miss me, and you won’t be able to concentrate either… We both know that you have a much higher chance of passing this stage than me, so we can’t take the risk! Just like you said, if 1 go up first, you can at least have some reference. In addition, regardless of whether I’ve been eliminated or successfully passed, you can continue to pass the next round without any distractions!”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei’s heart warmed. He held Ling Qingxue’s hands tightly and said,””Qingxue … I’m not that weak. Let me go first. I’m sure 1 can make it through!”

Ling Qingxue shook her head and said,”since we’re already on the eighth level, and it’s also the last stage, we have to eliminate any unfavorable factors!” Your chances are higher than mine, I can’t let you take the risk! RUO Fei, you must listen to me this time!”

Xia ruofei opened his mouth, but before he could speak, Ling Qingxue immediately said seriously,””RUO Fei, remember, no matter what happens to me on the heavenly stairs, you must not be affected! Don’t think about anything else when you’re challenging the levels, just focus on climbing up! I feel that although this trial Pagoda is dangerous, this stage shouldn’t be life – threatening. Even if I’m eliminated, 1 believe we’ll meet again soon!”

Xia ruofei looked deeply at Ling Qingxue. After a long time, he sighed and said,””Alright! Then I’ll hold the fort for you!”

Ling Qingxue smiled and said,””Mm! That’s right!”

“Qingxue, take care!” Xia ruofei hugged Ling Qingxue.

Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”don’t worry!” I will also do my best! No matter if I can pass this trial or not, I want to at least see what my limits are if I’m on my own!”

Ling Qingxue then gently pulled her hand away and said,””Ruofei, 1’11 go up then!”

“Mm! Be careful!”

Ling Qingxue smiled at Xia ruofei, then walked towards the stairs on the right without hesitation.

She stood in front of the steps and did not turn to look at Xia ruofei. Instead, she took a deep breath and then stepped onto the first step without hesitation.

Xia ruofei stared unblinkingly at Ling Qingxue. He was even more nervous than if he were to challenge the levels himself.

Ling Qingxue stood on the first step. Her body swayed slightly, but she quickly steadied herself.

She turned around and said a few words to Xia ruofei. However, Xia ruofei could not hear anything. It was as if Ling Qingxue had entered another space after stepping on the steps. No sound could be transmitted. However, the amazing thing was that he could still see Ling Qingxue’s figure on the steps.

Ling Qingxue saw Xia ruofei’s blank expression and seemed to realize that Xia ruofei might not be able to hear her. She said a few words very slowly so that even if Xia ruofei could not hear her, he could guess what she wanted to say from the shape of her mouth..
