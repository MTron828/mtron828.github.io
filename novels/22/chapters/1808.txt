“Hahaha! Let’s not be so polite!” Xu lang smiled and said,”I heard that the mainland is using a real – Name System to buy high – speed rail tickets. I’ll get someone to send you a copy of our identity information later.”

“Alright! Alright!” Xia ruofei said,”uncle Xu, I’ll see you tomorrow!”

“Alright, see you tomorrow!” Xu lang said with a smile.

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei secretly felt lucky. He did not expect Xu lang to be going to Heron Island to attend the exchange meeting. This was too much of a coincidence.

In fact, an auspicious day was also a bit illusory. However, Xia ruofei still attached great importance to the relocation of the company headquarters. With a well – known Feng Shui Master in Hong Kong to help pick a day, at least he would feel more at ease.

……

In a luxurious suite of a five – Star hotel in Beijing.

Xu lang, who was dressed in a Tang suit, called his assistant in and asked,””A ‘Yuan, did the heron Island mystics society invite us to an exchange event tomorrow?”

“Yes, but I’ve already turned you down the day before yesterday,” said the assistant, a ‘Yuan, nodding.

“Go and reply to them that I’ll be there as scheduled tomorrow!” Xu lang said.

“Uncle Xu, we’ve already booked our return tickets to Hong Kong tomorrow ...” Ah Yuan was stunned for a moment.

“Then, return it!” Xu lang said firmly,”push back any arrangements in Hong Kong in two days!”

“Alright!” A ‘Yuan’s heart trembled as she quickly replied.

Although he didn’t know why Xu lang suddenly changed his mind to attend the exchange meeting on Heron Island, as an assistant, he just had to follow his orders.

As ah Yuan walked out, she said in her heart, The heron – Island mystics society was going to be overjoyed ...

Indeed, as a city – Level metaphysics organization, they had only invited Xu lang to give it a try since they had heard that he was in Beijing. They did not have high hopes at all. In fact, Xu lang had turned them down.

Now that he had suddenly changed his mind and wanted to participate, it was definitely a huge surprise for the heron Island mystics society! 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

At this moment, Xu lang said from behind,””Oh right, a ‘Yuan, send our identity information to Mr. Xia. He’s going to help us book the tickets!”

“Book tickets? The egret Island mystics society will be responsible for buying the tickets to Egret Island. ” A ‘Yuan asked, puzzled.

“It’s a high – speed rail ticket from Heron Island to Sanshan. ” Xu lang said,”don’t worry about it. You have Mr. Xia’s business card, right? Get in touch with him as soon as possible!”

“Alright, uncle Xu!” Ah Yuan quickly replied.

……

Three mountains, Ling’s private restaurant.

Naturally, Xia ruofei did not know that Xu lang had specially changed his schedule to help him pick a date.

He was currently making tea with Feng Jing and Dong Yun as they chatted about company matters.

“President Dong, I’ll invite a Feng Shui Master to pick a good day for us tomorrow.” Xia ruofei said,”you guys should be prepared to move soon!”

“Alright, everything is in place now. All that’s left is the crucial wind!” Dong Yun said confidently,”as long as you give the order, the company headquarters can be moved at any time!”

People in the business world were more or less superstitious, and there were even more people who believed in metaphysics. Hence, Feng Jing didn’t feel that it was inappropriate for Xia ruofei to hire a Feng Shui Master. Instead, she asked curiously,””President Xia, which Fengshui master did you hire?”

“Hong Kong’s Xu lang. Have you heard of him?” Xia ruofei smiled.

Feng Rao was stunned for a moment and asked in disbelief,””It’s ... The famous uncle Xu?”

Xia ruofei was a little surprised. He smiled and said,””You really know uncle Xu! That’s good! Director Feng’s knowledge is really broad!”

Feng Rao glared at Xia ruofei and said,”Chairman, stop joking! You ... How did you manage to invite uncle Xu? Besides, it’s just an auspicious day. Why would a master like him come all the way from Hong Kong?”

“President Feng, is this uncle Xu very famous?” Dong Yun asked curiously.

“Just remove the ‘mo’!” Feng Rao smiled and said,”he’s a legend in Hong Kong’s field of mysticism. You should know the head of the Changjiang group, right? Uncle Xu is his personal Fengshui master!”

The head of the Changjiang group was, of course, mogul li.

As a top student of the business school who had just returned from abroad, Dong Yun might not know much about Feng Shui and metaphysics, but she definitely knew the famous tycoon li. He was the totem in the hearts of the business school students!

Dong Yun couldn’t help but take in a breath of cold air, her beautiful mouth forming an “O” shape.

Feng Rao was amused and said,””President Dong, you don’t really think that uncle Xu will come, do you? The chairman must be joking with us!”

Xia ruofei was speechless and said,”do I look that scary?” I really did invite uncle Xu over, and he’s not in Hong Kong, but in Beijing. He’ll be attending an event in Heron Island tomorrow, and then he’ll pick a date for us!”

Seeing that Xia ruofei was serious and did not seem to be joking, Feng Jing was a little uncertain. She looked at Xia ruofei and asked,””Chairman, did you really invite uncle Xu?”

“Of course! Do I need to joke with you about this?” Xia ruofei was speechless.

“That’s hard to say ...” Feng Jing mumbled.

Then, she added,”if it’s really uncle Xu, we have to do our best to welcome him!” We can’t neglect him ...”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I was just about to talk to you about this!” Uncle Xu will be attending an event in Heron Island tomorrow. He has already expressed that he wants to experience the high – speed rail in the mainland and has politely refused my offer to pick him up, so ... It’s best for our company to send someone to pick him up in advance, and then we can take the high – speed rail back together. ”

“Yeah!” Feng Rao nodded. Chairman, you’ve just come back, so don’t rush around anymore. In order to show our importance, I think it’s better for me to go!”

“You’ll go personally?” Xia ruofei thought for a while and nodded.”That’s fine. You’ll take Liu Qian with you tomorrow. Thank you for making the trip!”

Just then, Xia ruofei’s phone rang. It was an unknown number.

After he answered the call, he found out that it was Xu Lang’s assistant, a ‘Yuan.

Ah Yuan had sent his and Xu Lang’s identity information to Xia ruofei’s email and then called Xia ruofei to inform him.

Xia ruofei quickly sniffed Xu Lang’s schedule for tomorrow on Egret Island. After expressing his gratitude, he hung up the phone.

Xia ruofei waved his phone at Feng Jing and Dong Yun and said with a smile,””It’s uncle Xu’s assistant. Do You Believe Me Now?”

Feng Rao smiled in embarrassment and immediately asked,””What’s uncle Xu’s plan for tomorrow?”

Xia ruofei said,”tomorrow’s exchange event is half a day in the afternoon. After that, there’ll be a cold dinner. But a ‘Yuan said that uncle Xu will leave after the exchange event and will not be joining the cold dinner of the heron Island mystics society. The exchange event will end at about 5:30 in the afternoon.”

Xia ruofei paused and said,””Considering the traffic during rush hour, you can book the tickets for the train after Seveno’ clock! Remember to get a Business Class seat. ”

“Alright!” Feng Rao immediately replied. Chairman, can you forward a copy of uncle Xu and his assistant’s identity information to me? I’ll contact Liu Qian to book the tickets!”

Xia ruofei nodded and opened his email on his phone. He forwarded ah Yuan’s email to Feng Jing.

On the other hand, Feng Jing gave Liu Qian a call and asked her to prepare for the business trip. At the same time, she asked her to book the tickets as per Xia ruofei’s request.

After hanging up the phone, Feng Jing transferred the email that Xia ruofei had forwarded to Liu Qian. She then heaved a sigh of relief.

She looked at Xia ruofei and said,”Chairman, uncle Xu has personally come to help our company choose an auspicious day. This is a big honor!” By the way, I heard that uncle Xu’s pay for helping people look at Feng Shui is very high. How much should we pay tomorrow? We’ll have to ask the finance department to prepare the check in advance. If they accept Hong Kong dollars, we’ll have to exchange it in advance ...”
