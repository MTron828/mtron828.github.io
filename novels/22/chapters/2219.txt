2220 Assistant Dong’s team_When Qin Yanan heard this, she couldn’t help but feel nervous.

This team had an extraordinary position in the company. Although it was managed by the administration department, it was actually the Chairman’s direct team. They usually handled all matters related to the chairman, such as the maintenance of social accounts. It could be said that they were the most direct of the direct subordinates. Being able to be in charge of such a team was quite good for her development prospects in the company.

If this newly formed team was disbanded because of Xia ruofei’s words, wouldn’t she want to cry but have no tears?

However, Qin Yanan also knew that as a small manager of M5, he had no place to speak in front of the chairman and the president. He could only be anxious.

Fortunately, Feng Jing was the one who personally pushed for this project. Logically speaking, Feng Jing wouldn’t compromise so easily. Everyone in the company knew that she was CEO Xia’s most trusted subordinate, so her words carried a lot of weight.

As expected, Feng Jing smiled.”Chairman, it’s necessary to set up this team. Let’s not talk about other things. Just based on your social media account, how can you guarantee that you’ll keep getting exposure and popularity if you don’t update it once every few days?” Also, as the company’s reputation and scale get bigger and bigger, there will naturally be more and more matters related to you. All of these will require a professional team to handle!”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,””Alright! Then I’ll listen to you!”

The company’s profitability was shocking, and Xia ruofei was not a petty person. Naturally, he would not reject Feng Jing’s decision just to save costs and hire fewer employees.

In the company, Xia ruofei was still very concerned about maintaining Feng Jing’s prestige. After all, he couldn’t be tied down by the position of Chairman for a long time. Feng Jing was responsible for most of the daily operations of the company.

Qin Yanan heaved a sigh of relief when she heard that. She thought that President Feng’s position in the Chairman’s heart was indeed important. He was convinced with just a few words.

Feng Rao chuckled,”Chairman, have a chat with Qin Yanan!” I’ll go back to the office first. If you have any instructions, you can tell her directly. ”

Xia ruofei stood up and said,”okay!” Boss Feng, you’ve worked hard!”

Feng Jing waved her hand with a smile and walked out of the office.

Xia ruofei and Qin Yanan were the only two people left in the office, and Qin Yanan looked even more uneasy. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

When Xia ruofei got up, Qin Yanan stood up subconsciously as well. Now, she stood there helplessly.

In fact, Qin Yanan was a Standard Elite white – collar worker. She studied in a famous university for her bachelor’s degree and even obtained a postgraduate degree in the United States. At the beginning of the year, when the Paradise company expanded its scale, she gave up many opportunities to work at a BAT – Class company and resolutely came to the Paradise company, which she thought had endless potential.

Even in front of Feng Jing, Dong Yun, and other company executives, Qin Yanan could maintain a calm and appropriate response. However, when it came to Xia ruofei, she always felt a sense of nervousness for no reason.

Even though Xia ruofei always had a gentle smile on his face, he seemed to have a faint majestic aura that made Qin Yanan a little timid in front of him.

Xia ruofei smiled at Qin Yanan.””Manager Qin, don’t just stand there, sit down and talk!”

“Chairman, you can just call me little Qin or Yanan,” Qin Yanan quickly said.

This team was Xia ruofei’s personal service team. Qin Yanan was also trying to get closer to Xia ruofei. The way she addressed him as “manager Qin” made them seem a little distant.

Xia ruofei smiled as he looked at the resume that Feng Jing had left behind. Qin Yanan was about the same age as him, so he couldn’t bring himself to call her ‘little Qin’. Hence, he smiled and said,”Alright! Then I’ll call you ya Nan!”

Qin Yanan revealed a look of joy and sat down opposite Xia ruofei’s desk.””Chairman, I’ll report to you about our team’s situation first!”

Xia ruofei nodded.

Qin Yanan said,”there are a total of six people in the whole team now, two of whom are responsible for operating your social media account. At this stage, it’s mainly your Weibo account. In view of your international popularity is also rising, especially in Australia, you are even a well – known figure, so we suggest that you open Facebook, ins, and other overseas mainstream social media accounts in the future. By then, we expect the operation team to increase to about four people.”

Xia ruofei nodded.”Sure. You can handle this. Oh, by the way, is it convenient for Facebook, Twitter, and ins to operate in China?”

For reasons that everyone knew, some overseas social media platforms could not be used directly in China.

Qin Yanan smiled and said,”we’ve conducted an investigation in the beginning, and there’s no problem at all.” All he had to do was to purchase a VPN. “In addition, regarding the issue of the platform’s account being banned, for a well – known public figure like you, even if the big data hit you, the platform generally wouldn’t ban your account knowing that you logged in in in China, so there’s definitely no problem!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”that’s good!” Just work according to your ideas!”

“Yes, Chairman!” Qin Yanan said,”currently, the remaining three people in the team are responsible for Public Affairs, logistics support, and some other work. Of course, this division of labor is not absolute. I will coordinate the strength of the tasks that are more important.”

Qin Yanan looked at Xia ruofei and said,””Chairman, I’m the person in charge of your service team and your Work Assistant, so ... I hope you can approve of me moving to the secretary’s desk at the entrance from today onwards.”

Although the workstation was in front of Xia ruofei’s office, most of the area on the top floor was Xia ruofei’s office area. It was only connected to Feng Jing’s president’s office by a single passage. The two offices were relatively independent, so the workstation in front of Xia ruofei’s office was actually a separate office. It was only connected to the chairman’s office’s exclusive elevator and was the only way for guests to reach Xia ruofei’s office.

Xia ruofei raised her eyebrows and said,””You’re the person in charge of the team. You don’t have to personally do this kind of specific work, right?”

“Chairman, it’s our team’s important mission to serve you. As the team’s leader, of course I have to be the closest to you. That way, I can get first – hand information!” As for the team’s work, I’ll be working on this floor, so I can make arrangements for it as well. ”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”okay!” If you think it’s appropriate, then do it! But I’m not in the office most of the time. ”

Qin Yanan smiled and said,”it doesn’t matter. Whether you’re here or not, we still need someone to take care of this place!” Someone has to do the sending and receiving of documents. ”

Ordinary employees were not allowed to enter the chairman’s office at will, including this floor. When Xia ruofei was not around, Feng Jing or Dong Yun would personally deliver the documents that required his signature to his desk.

If he had an assistant, he could indeed sort out a lot of work relationships.

“Alright then!” Xia ruofei said after some thought.

“Thank you for your support, Chairman!” Qin Yanan happily said. Then I’ll bring the things over in a while!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

Qin Yanan then flipped open the book in her hand and said,””Chairman, regarding xiangnan TV’s Deputy Director Gao Jun’s visit to the company and his meeting with you, we’ve contacted xiangnan TV. I’d like to communicate with you about the specific schedule.”

“Okay, go ahead!” Xia ruofei nodded.

“It’s like this. Station head Gao and his group of four will be taking the 8:30 am flight tomorrow and will arrive at San Shan at around 11 am. The other party said that the southeast radio and television station will be responsible for receiving them and making hotel arrangements. They don’t need our guarantee. ” Qin Yanan said,”President Gao’s initial plan is to arrive at the Tao Yuan building at around 3 p.m. The vehicle will be protected by the southeast radio and television station. President Feng will personally receive President Gao and his group and take them on a tour of the company’s headquarters. At around 3:30 pm, director Gao and his men will meet you in the guest room on the top floor. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and asked,”what’s the main purpose of their visit?”

Qin Yanan reached out to tuck her hair behind her ears and said,””Chairman, we’ve already communicated with the people from xiangnan TV. The main purpose of this trip is to discuss the recording of the first episode of the third season of life you yearn for. There might also be some other cooperation intentions that need to be communicated.”
