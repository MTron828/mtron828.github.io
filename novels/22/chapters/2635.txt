2636 Back to the capital (2)

After about 12 hours of long – distance flight, paradise finally landed at Beijing International Airport.

Xia ruofei and the rest walked out of the public airport’s dedicated passageway and quickly got into their respective cars that had come to pick them up. They drove into the capital airport’s Expressway at the beginning of the night.

Liu Kuan took the car sent by the Liu family and returned to the house where old master Liu lived to report.

Xia ruofei did not go over. Instead, he took Xu Yougang on the Toyota Elfa driven by Wu Qiang and returned to the courtyard in liuhai Lane.

There was a two – hour time difference between Beijing and Australia. The plane took off from Sydney at about 9 A. M. And landed in Beijing at about 7 P. M., China time.

Since it was the rush hour in Beijing, it was almost 8:30 P. M. When they got home. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Although it was not too late, both of them had been on the plane for more than ten hours. Moreover, Xia ruofei and Xu You had already had dinner on the plane when the plane was about to start descending. So, they went straight back to their rooms to rest after they arrived at the courtyard house.

……

In the Liu family’s house, Liu Kuan, who had just returned from a long journey, went straight to Grandpa Liu’s room without even taking a breath.

“Master, I’m back!” Liu Kuan said as he bowed slightly.

Old man Liu had been taking the medicine that Xia ruofei had provided for the past few days. Although his condition did not improve much, he was still in good spirits.

“It’s been hard on you, Kuan,”he said with a smile.

“Master, you’re too kind ...” Liu Kuan said respectfully.

“Tell me! According to your observations these past two days, what is Xiao Xia’s attitude toward the green cloud Island?” Old man Liu asked indifferently.

“Yes!” Liu Kuan slightly bowed and said,”master, according to my judgment, Mr. Xia should be interested in the blue cloud Island.” After he arrived at the green cloud Island, he observed every place he visited carefully and asked a lot of questions. Then, he took a helicopter and flew around the island a few times. ”

“En!” Old man Liu asked without changing his expression,”so, he might choose to go to the blue cloud Island?”

“I can’t make a judgment on this,” Liu Kuan said honestly,”after all, Mr. Xia didn’t show much interest in it. I tried to test him several times, but he didn’t reveal anything. I don’t know if he’s interested in blue cloud Island or not, but one thing should be certain. That is, even if he is inclined to choose blue cloud Island, he is not very eager. This can be seen from many details. And ... He stayed in Sydney for a day on his return trip. He doesn’t seem to be in a hurry to return home. ”

Old man Liu revealed a thoughtful expression and asked,””Then ... If I want him to choose the blue cloud Island, do you have any suggestions?”

“Master, I think Mr. Xia is a very opinionated person, and it’s difficult for others to change his decision easily.” Liu Kuan said,”if he doesn’t want to choose the blue cloud Island, it’s useless for us to say anything. And if he has already made up his mind and wants this Island, then we don’t need to do anything. We just need to wait for his notice. ”

“That makes sense ...” Elder Liu nodded slowly and said.

Then, he sighed and said,””If it wasn’t for the fact that there were no better choices, I really wouldn’t want him to take the blue cloud Island. That Island is the result of over ten years of our hard work! Moreover, if we really lose the blue cloud Island, our Liu family will have no way out!”

Liu Kuan hesitated and said,”master, don’t you want him to choose cash the most?” Why did you change your mind?”

Old man Liu smiled and said,”actually, I hope that he would choose the Liu family’s shares the most. However, Xiao Xia is a smart person. He probably wouldn’t choose the shares.” The reason why I included the shares in the selection plan was just because I had a glimmer of hope, but the hope was not big. ”

At this point, elder Liu paused, as if he was out of breath after saying so much in one breath.

After a while, he continued,””As for cash ... It’s very difficult for us to raise that much money. Even if we borrow it, if we lose such a huge amount of cash, we’re likely to be doomed ... This can be solved by installments or other methods, but some difficulties can’t be solved.”

“Master, I don’t know much about these things.” Liu Kuan said,”whatever you say, I’ll do it. I promise I’ll go wherever you want me to go!”

Old man Liu laughed and said,””In fact, after thinking it through, I think that the plan of blue cloud Island seems to be the most suitable for both sides. To us, although the island is very precious, we have to invest in the project every year. Even if the island was not given to Xia ruofei, the money has already been spent. As for Xia ruofei, he doesn’t need such a huge cash flow. Instead, it seems more attractive for young people of his age to have an Island of his own in the distant South Pacific Ocean. ”

Liu Kuan nodded and said,”I also think that Mr. Xia should not be interested in the pure cash plan.” As for green cloud Island ... I really can’t see through Mr. Xia’s true thoughts, but he at least showed a certain interest in green cloud Island, so I think the hope is still very high. ”

Xia ruofei’s cover – up was so successful that Liu Kuan did not notice his intention at all.

Liu Kuan’s conclusion was basically the judgment that Xia ruofei wanted him to make.

“Yes, I know what to do!” Grandpa Liu nodded and said,”Kuan, you must be tired after a long journey! Hurry up and take a shower and then rest! You don’t have to worry about me tonight ...”

Liu Kuan showed a grateful look and said,””Thank you for your concern, master. You should rest early too. I’ll go down now.”

“Go!” Old man Liu waved his hand and said.

……

The next morning, Xu You said goodbye to Xia ruofei after having breakfast with him.

“Brother Xia, I’ll take my leave then!” Xu Yougang said,”I have two comrades in Beijing. I’m going to talk to them first.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” Go! Remember to tell them the pros and cons clearly. Also, tell them that if they work here, their income will definitely be much higher than in China!”

“Alright, brother Xia!” Xu Yougang replied respectfully,”by the way, brother Xia, after I’m done talking in Beijing, I’ll go to the next place and won’t be coming back here.” After I’ve talked to all the comrades I can contact, I’ll report to you according to their decisions. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sure!” Don’t Save Me any travel expenses, and if you can take the plane, don’t take the train! Also, pick a better hotel for your accommodation, understand?”

When Xia ruofei was in Australia, he had already asked the finance department of paradise Corporation to transfer 200000 Yuan to Xu Yougang’s domestic bank account as an advance for travel expenses. As for the procedures, Xia ruofei could just make up for them when she returned to Sanshan.

It wasn’t a lot of money, but Xu Yougang and the others were originally employees of paradise Corporation. Their work in Australia was actually considered an assignment. Including Grandpa Tang He, they had to bear these people’s salaries according to a proportion. However, these were all recorded by the finance department and directly withdrawn from Paradise Farm’s account. They could settle the payment when it was time for dividends.

The hiring of security personnel was also part of the peach blossom company’s business, so Xia ruofei followed the principle of business. Through a pre – Loan, he asked the finance department to transfer the money to Xu Yougang.

“Alright!” Xu Yougang said. Thank you, brother Xia!”

“Also ...” Xia ruofei continued,”you comrades should get together when you meet. Besides, it’s easier to talk about many things after drinking, so you can’t save money in this area. Moreover, this is official business. You can’t pay for it yourself, so you should still use the money from the advance loan! You can keep the receipts and write them off when you come back!”

“I got it!” Xu Yougang said gratefully,”thank you for your concern, brother Xia!”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.”You don’t have to be so polite. Just go!”

Xu Yougang took his simple backpack and left the courtyard house. After a while, Xia ruofei also took his bag and got into the Toyota Elfa driven by Wu Qiang. They went to the Liu family’s residence to check on old master Liu.

At the same time, in order to avoid any complications, Xia ruofei also planned to settle the matters of the green cloud Island today.
