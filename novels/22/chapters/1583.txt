Song Wei smiled and said,”she’s from the air China headquarters. She’s my best friend!” This manager Gu was the person in charge of Air China’s Hongzhou airport. He might be more concerned about the matters entrusted by the headquarters! Actually, my best friend’s rank isn’t that high ...”

Xia ruofei laughed.

He knew that Song Wei’s best friend might not have a high status in Air China, but she definitely had a powerful background. Otherwise, Song Wei would not have asked her to do this so easily.

The escort vehicle followed manager Gu’s car through a security door and entered the cargo transfer area.

Manager Gu greeted them with a staff member, while Shi Lei organized the escorts to start unloading the vehicles.

The five raw gemstones were packed into four boxes. Three of the larger gemstones were packed separately.

After the goods were unloaded, the escort asked Xia ruofei to sign and the mission was considered complete.

Meanwhile, manager Gu arranged for people to take over the batch of raw stones. They completed the consignment procedures in the shortest time possible and handed them over to Song Wei with both hands.

“Miss song, don’t worry. Before the cargo door closes, our people will keep an eye on the cargo. We won’t let the cargo leave our sight.” Manager Gu said,”Sanshan airport has also coordinated with each other and found you a pickup truck from the airport. After you land, don’t get off the plane with the ordinary passengers. The crew will take you directly to the tarmac to wait and then help you transport the goods out of the restricted area. You just have to arrange for the car to wait outside.”

“You’re too thoughtful!” “Thank you, manager Gu!” Song Wei said.

“You’re welcome, you’re welcome!” Manager Gu quickly said,”if you need anything, please call me at any time!”

“Alright,” he said. Song Wei said.

The group left the cargo transfer area and went straight to the departure hall.

Xia ruofei and Song Wei’s tickets were first – class, so they went directly to the air China VIP counter to exchange for their boarding passes. There was a dedicated service staff to lead them to the VIP lounge.

Standing at the entrance of the VIP security passage, Xia ruofei said to Yu mingdong,””President Yu, Shi Lei, thank you for sending us off at the airport. If you have the chance, come to San Shan! I’ll definitely entertain you warmly!”

“Good, good, good! I’ll definitely find time to go there. ” Yu mingdong said.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”alright, we’ll meet again ...”

“Mr. Xia, please wait!” Yu mingdong shouted.

Xia ruofei stopped in his tracks and turned to look at Yu mingdong.

Yu mingdong walked over and took out something wrapped in a newspaper from his bag. He handed it to Xia ruofei and said,””This is a small gift from me, Mr. Xia, please don’t reject it ...”

Xia ruofei opened the newspaper package in confusion and quickly gave it to Yu mingdong.””President Yu, I can’t take this. You should keep it for yourself!”

There was a piece of Jade in the bag. It was about the same size as the one that Song Wei had cut out yesterday, but the quality was much higher. It was an ice type jade, close to the glass type, and it looked crystal clear.

Xia ruofei had learned a lot about this in the past few days. He was familiar with the market. He conservatively estimated that this piece of Jade was at least ten times the value of Song Wei’s piece, which was at least five million Yuan.

Yu mingdong pushed the Imperial Jade back and said,””Mr. Xia, listen to me ... That day, you already gave me a friendship price for that piece of violet floating flower, but you didn’t buy the Jade that I promised was worth five million Yuan. Instead, you took a piece of Jade. Although it was also an ice – Type jade, it was definitely not worth five million Yuan. This piece of Jade is my small compensation. If you still don’t accept it, I’ll feel really bad!”

On one hand, Yu mingdong felt that he couldn’t take advantage of this. On the other hand, he was really grateful to Xia ruofei for criticizing He Ping for misjudging the raw stone. If Xia ruofei had not reminded him softly, it might have fallen into his own hands. How could fatty Luo have taken over?

Furthermore, Yu mingdong had attributed the two consecutive huge gains in stone gambling to the luck that Xia ruofei had brought him. Hence, he was grateful to Xia ruofei from the bottom of his heart and was willing to give him this piece of Jade.

“President Yu, if you put it that way ... This piece plus the one from that night is worth more than five million!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”besides, your own processing plant has a huge demand for high – end Jade. You should keep it for yourself!”

“No! Mr. Xia, although I, Yu mingdong, am a profit – seeking businessman, I also clearly distinguish between gratitude and grudges!” Yu mingdong said,”I know Mr. Xia may not care about that little bit of money, but I care about my principles. If you really treat me as a friend, then take it!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and laughed.””Alright! I’ll make you my friend! I’ll be taking the item!”

“That’s the way!” Yu mingdong happily stuffed the Jade into Xia ruofei’s hands and said,”you guys go in quickly! Lei Zi and I are also going to Rui Zhou, we still have some things to do!”

Xia ruofei waved goodbye to the two of them and walked to the security checkpoint with the Jade.

Xia ruofei gave ye Lingyun a call and told him his flight details. He asked him to drive the company’s pickup truck to the airport and wait there.

Song Wei played with the Jade that Yu mingdong had given Xia ruofei and said with a smile,””President Yu is really good to you! I’ll give such a beautiful piece of Jade to you, you can’t just reject it!”

“If you like it, I’ll give it to you!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Song Wei quickly stuffed the Jade into Xia ruofei’s hands and said,””You should quickly put it away! This was something that was worth more than five million! I don’t dare to take it ...”

Xia ruofei laughed.”Didn’t you say that after we go back, you’ll still need me to personally carve Jade for you?” he asked.

“That’s different. I’ll buy it from you!” Song Wei said,”I can’t accept such a big piece of Jade.”

“You still want to listen to principles ...” Xia ruofei smiled and kept the Jade without saying anything.

The quality of this Jade was not bad. If the Jade from his raw stones was not as good as this one, he was prepared to use this high ice type jade to carve some accessories, such as earrings, bracelets, pendants, and so on. He would definitely prepare a set for Song Wei.

As for the money, Xia ruofei would not accept it.

However, his raw stone had not been opened yet. It was too early to talk about this, so Xia ruofei did not continue to argue with Song Wei on this topic.

After the two of them rested for a while, at around 11 am, an Air China ground service staff came over to remind them that they could board the plane.

The flight was smooth, and the plane landed at Sanshan airport around two in the afternoon.

Looking at the terminal outside the porthole, Xia ruofei felt like it was a lifetime ago.

He had been out for more than ten days and had experienced many things. Of course, he had gained a lot. The only imperfection was that Song Wei’s peach blossom miasma had not been completely cured. However, after a few rounds of cultivation, Xia ruofei was confident that he could completely eliminate the miasma in the near future.

The passengers got up and got off the plane. Xia ruofei and Song Wei took their luggage and continued to wait in their seats.

After a while, the first – Class flight attendant came over and led the two of them out of the cabin door. After crossing the covered bridge, a door opened from the side and took the two of them through the stairs to the tarmac.

A pickup truck was already waiting there, and the air China person in charge of San Shan airport had also arrived.

The cargo hold was already open, and the staff were sending the passengers ‘luggage onto the conveyor belt.

The boxes that contained Xia ruofei’s raw stones were quickly unloaded and loaded into the pickup truck.

Xia ruofei and Song Wei left the restricted area in the pickup truck and drove to the airport parking lot.

Xia ruofei gave ye Lingyun a call. In no time, he drove the farm’s pickup truck to the parking lot.

Ye Lingyun and the air China ground service staff worked together to pour the raw stones into the pickup truck on the farm. Xia ruofei expressed his gratitude to the other party, then took Song Wei and left the airport in the two pickup trucks.
