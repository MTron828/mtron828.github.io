Chapter 1672: God’s arrangement (2)

Xia ruofei and Feng Jing were conversing in Chinese, so naturally, Brook could not understand what they were talking about. However, he could not help but admire Xia ruofei’s strong mental fortitude when he saw that Xia ruofei was still so calm and composed after completing such a magnificent feat.

While the two were talking, Brook finally found a chance to interrupt. He said sincerely,””Xia, you’ve created a great miracle! I think this must be God’s plan. You’re the angel he sent to save us!”

Brook was a devout Christian, and his personal experience made him believe that this was God’s arrangement.

If not for Xia ruofei, they would not have been able to open the cockpit door. Brook, who had received professional training, knew very well that even if they hacked at the cockpit for an hour with an explosion – proof axe, there would not be much damage to the cockpit door. However, it was impossible for Wilkinson, who was in control of the plane at that time, to give them that much time.

However, Xia ruofei had split the cockpit door open with just a few slashes. Then, he had used his body to break the door open. If he had not seen it with his own eyes and had been described to him by someone else, Brook would have thought that this person had gone crazy.

What happened next was even more amazing. Wilkinson’s death wish came true, and he was sucked out of the plane that was 10000 meters in the air. The in – charge Captain, Johannson, had been poisoned to death, and the only pilot, Brook, had both his arms injured. No one could control the plane. They had thought that this was the end of the line, but they did not expect to see a glimmer of hope.

This young man with extraordinary strength had actually mastered the basic control of the plane very quickly. Then, he had unbelievably piloted the giant Airbus A350 and successfully landed. Even the plane was basically undamaged.

If this was not God’s arrangement, what else could be explained? Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Xia ruofei laughed and said in English,””Captain Brook, I’m Chinese and I’m not a Christian. I don’t think your God knows me. If it’s really God’s arrangement, it should be the gods of our Huaxia who sent me here ...”

“No, no, no, God is everywhere!” Brook said,”our piety must have touched God, so he arranged for you to board this plane!”

Facing a devout believer, Xia ruofei felt that it was useless to waste his breath on him. So, he simply shrugged and did not refute Brook’s words.

Xia ruofei saw that Brook’s bandaged left arm was starting to bleed again, so he said,”Captain Brook, let me help you treat the wound on your arm!”

“Xia, you’re a doctor?” Brook asked in surprise.

Xia ruofei shrugged his shoulders.”I’m not a medical practitioner, but I do know some medical skills. I’m a Chinese doctor. If you don’t mind, I can help you with the preliminary treatment. After all, you’re bleeding!”

Originally, Brook didn’t really believe in Chinese medicine. However, he had absolute trust in Xia ruofei. He replied without hesitation,””Of course not! Xia, please help me!”

Xia ruofei nodded and leaned over from the pilot’s seat. He first undid the blood – soaked bandage on Brook’s arm, then gently tore off his left sleeve. As it was summer in Australia, Brook changed into a short – sleeved flight uniform after the plane’s air – conditioning started working. Xia ruofei easily tore off the sleeve.

Brook’s arm was hit by two steel balls. He didn’t know if he was lucky or unlucky. The steel balls hit the thick windshield and flew everywhere. If they had hit his head instead of his arm, he would have been dead. However, he was unlucky enough to be hit by two steel balls on the same arm.

Xia ruofei stretched out his hand and quickly pointed around Brook’s wound. The bleeding stopped immediately. What was even more amazing was that Brook felt less pain.

In fact, Xia ruofei could have used his genuine Qi to force the steel ball out of Brook’s arm. However, he did not want to make a scene and decided to leave it to the hospital.

Hence, after stopping Brook’s bleeding and pain through his acupuncture points, Xia ruofei asked Feng Rao to find a first aid kit from the back of the seat. She then used gauze and bandages to bandage Brook.

As a veteran who had received battlefield first aid training, Xia ruofei was naturally fast and good at bandaging his wound. He finished it in a short while.

Brook said excitedly,”God!” From now on, I won’t believe those rumors that say Chinese medicine is witchcraft and a scam anymore! Xia, your medical skills are amazing ...”

Indeed, from the perspective of Western medicine, it was difficult to explain why a few simple taps could stop the bleeding and pain. This was because in the theory of Western medicine, acupuncture points and meridians did not exist. The theoretical foundation of Chinese medicine was groundless in the perspective of Western medicine.

Xia ruofei smiled.”I can’t do much. I’ll leave the rest to the professional doctors.”

“You’re a hundred times better than those professional doctors!” Brook was not stingy with his praise!

“Hahaha! Then I can consider opening a Chinese medicine clinic after retirement!” Xia ruofei said.

“Then your business will be very good!” Brook said with certainty.

As they were talking, someone walked into the cockpit. Brook saw the person and immediately said,””Hey! Alex! I’ve never wanted to see your annoying old face as much as I do today!”
