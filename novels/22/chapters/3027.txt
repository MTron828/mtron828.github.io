3028 Ignorant and fearless (1)

Xia ruofei would never have thought that after only 15 minutes, scholar Yuntai could already communicate with him.

One of his spiritual power had just been devoured by the ore, and the feedback from this spiritual power showed that scholar Yuntai was still in that small space. Moreover, judging from the recovery of scholar Yuntai’s spirit body, the time flow in that small space should not have changed.

Scholar Yuntai’s spiritual body had indeed recovered quite well.

Even though it had not reached the state he was in when he had just come out of the spatial rock seal, it was already much more solid and his condition was rather stable.

Judging from his current state, he should be able to communicate with others normally.

Xia ruofei was not shocked by the speed of recovery of scholar Yuntai, but by the fact that he could communicate with him in the spirit map space inside the ore space!

This also meant that if he wanted to, he could leave the space inside the ore at any time?

How could Xia ruofei, who had been trapped there for thousands of years, bear this?

Xia ruofei was flabbergasted. He was stunned and could not speak for a while.

Scholar Yuntai asked curiously,”little brother, what’s wrong?” Is there a problem?”

Xia ruofei came back to his senses and quickly said,””Oh! No... No... Senior Yuntai, how did you do it?”

Master Yuntai scratched his head and asked,””Do what?”

He was now even more suspicious of the brain of this young man he had just met. He was simply incoherent!

Xia ruofei said,”it’s ... You can talk to me directly!”

Upon hearing this, scholar Yuntai was even more confused. He said,””It’s very easy to use spiritual power to transmit a message! Even Qi condensation cultivators could do it! That’s not right, didn’t you just use your spiritual power to talk to me? Why are you suddenly asking such a basic question?”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”senior Yuntai, I mean ... How did you manage to talk to me directly in the space inside the ore?” So you can come out at any time?”

“Why should I go out?” asked layman Yuntai. In the outside world, he would have to endure the pain of burning at all times, and his spirit body would be exhausted very quickly. That was truly the death of his soul! This small space of yours is my heaven!”

Xia ruofei was speechless. It was as if after talking for a long time, he and scholar Yuntai were talking like chickens and ducks. They were talking about two different things. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Xia ruofei took a few deep breaths and said,””Senior Yuntai, this junior didn’t ask you to come out. I mean, if you want, you can leave the ore space at any time, right?”

“How could I be willing?” grumbled layman Yuntai.

Before Xia ruofei went crazy, master Yuntai finally said,””Little brother, you’re right. As long as I want to, I can leave this place at any time!”

Xia ruofei almost burst into tears. He finally got the point.

“Senior, how did you do it?” he asked quickly. I was once trapped inside and couldn’t find a way out. I could only wander in an endless small space ...”

“Little brother,” said scholar Yuntai with a smile,”actually, I don’t have that much ability. The reason why I can easily communicate with the outside world is mainly because of you!”

“Me?” Xia ruofei was confused.

“Yup! The mark you made with your spiritual force is like a torch in the fog!” Scholar Yuntai laughed and said,”and you’re constantly pouring in mental energy. I only need to follow the path of your mental energy aura and return. This isn’t difficult at all!”

Xia ruofei was stunned.

It was actually so simple?

His attainments in space were already very high, so after listening to the words of scholar Yuntai, he thought for a moment and understood.

It really made sense.

Perhaps this was what it meant to be confused by those involved!

Of course, this also made Xia ruofei realize that it was not an injustice that he had been trapped in the inner space of the ore for a thousand years.

Because in that situation, there was no one in the outside world who could use their spiritual power to guide him!

Even if Luo Qingfeng had been by Xia ruofei’s side at that time, with his ability to understand space, he would not have been able to find the small space that Xia ruofei’s spirit body was trapped in, let alone provide any guidance.

If he was not careful, even Luo Qingfeng himself might be trapped in it.

Xia ruofei was deep inside the space. Without any guidance, he could only wander around like a headless fly.

He guessed that the reason he could come out was mostly due to luck. It just so happened that the small space he was in had a direct connection with the outside world, and the node just happened to lead to the outside world ...

It could be said that many factors had worked at the same time, allowing him to luckily escape.

If it wasn’t for the strange time flow in the ore space, Xia ruofei’s body might have rotted away long ago.

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei quickly asked,””Senior Yuntai! Why is there no difference in the flow of time between the small space you’re in and the outside world? The last time junior was trapped in a small space, time seemed to have stopped there ...”

Layman Yuntai laughed and said,”little brother, you must be talking about the chaotic flow of time in this small space!” Let me tell you, there are several types of time turbulence here. Once you’re trapped in it, it’ll be very difficult to escape. However, I happen to have some understanding of the time turbulence, so I avoided them all!”
