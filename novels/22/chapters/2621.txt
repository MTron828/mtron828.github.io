2622 Visiting the Green cloud Island (1)

The airport on blue cloud Island was not open to the public. Usually, there would only be one or two planes that took off and landed here to transport personnel or supplies.

However, the facilities at the island’s airport were very advanced. It even supported three types of blind landing, which meant that in theory, the plane could land directly in the automatic pilot mode without any need for manual operation.

The airports that supported type 3 blind landing were generally more advanced. Only a few key airports in China had such conditions. Of course, due to the complexity of the take – off and landing phase, most pilots would choose to land manually. Even if the airport supported three types of blind landing, few people would use this function.

In fact, the China Civil Aviation Administration had a relevant regulation that the pilot had to operate the landing manually. This was to avoid any problems or other accidents during the landing phase of the autopilot and blind landing guidance, which the pilot could not deal with in time. After all, the height and speed of the plane were relatively low during the landing stage. If there was an accident, there would be very little space for emergency treatment.

Captain Liu An also chose to leave the autopilot and land manually.

Today’s weather was very good. The ground was calm and the visibility was very high. Such a landing was a piece of cake for the experienced captain Liu An.

The plane landed smoothly on the runway of Qingyun island’s airport. Xia ruofei and Liu Kuan, who were sitting in the passenger cabin, only felt a slight shake of the plane. There was almost no bump during the landing process. The plane was already taxiing at high speed on the runway.

With the help of the anti – thrust and automatic brakes, the plane’s speed rapidly decreased and it quickly left the runway from the nearest exit.

Paradise was the only plane in the entire airport, and the airport even sent a guide car to lead the way and park paradise at the plane.

In fact, Xia ruofei felt that there was no need to do so. The airport was very small and did not have any complicated gliders. In addition, there were no other planes. The process of gliding after landing could not be any simpler.

After the plane stopped and the car closed, the flight attendant quickly opened the cabin door and put down the accommodation ladder. Captain Liu An also came out of the cockpit and went down to the side of the plane to wait.

Xia ruofei and Liu Kuan got up and walked to the cabin door. Under Liu Kuan’s insistence, Xia ruofei stepped out of the cabin first.

He was surprised to see that the tarmac was covered with a red carpet that extended all the way from the ramp. At the end of the red carpet, there were three cars parked. Two of them were black Mercedes – Benz cars, and one was a familiar Toyota Elfa commercial car. A few burly Men in Black suits and sunglasses were waiting by the car.

Beside the accommodation ladder, in addition to Captain Liu An and the flight attendants who had gotten off the plane in advance, there were five or six men in suits and leather shoes. Except for a middle – aged man with brown skin who looked like a local, the others all looked Chinese.

The leader was about 45 or 46 years old and was slightly chubby. Perhaps because he had been working here for a long time, his skin was a little dark. In addition, a strand of hair from the “local support Center” was dancing in the sea breeze, which looked a little funny.

The bald middle – aged man saw Xia ruofei getting off the plane first and was slightly stunned. Then, he quickly came to his senses and took two steps forward. He extended his hands and said enthusiastically,”Hello! Welcome to the blue cloud Island! I’m Liu Qingfeng, the chief supervisor of the green cloud Island project. ”

“Hello, President Liu.” Xia ruofei and Liu Qingfeng lightly shook hands and said indifferently.

Liu Kuan, who got off the plane after Xia ruofei, said,””Qingfeng, this is Chairman Xia ruofei of the Paradise Corporation. You can call him Mr. Xia.”

“Yes, uncle Kuan!” Liu Qingfeng said respectfully, and then greeted Xia ruofei again,”Mr. Xia, welcome! Welcome!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Although he had only received a simple notice from his family in advance, Liu Qingfeng had already seen that the protagonist this time was obviously not the highly respected Liu Kuan, but the young man in his 20s in front of him.

Although in Liu Qingfeng’s opinion, the status of the chairman of the peach blossom company was completely different from that of the Liu family, how could he, a small project leader, dare to neglect someone who was treated so politely by Liu Kuan?

A few people behind Liu Qingfeng also came forward to greet him. Xia ruofei shook hands with them one by one, while Liu Qingfeng was responsible for introducing them.

These people were all responsible for a certain aspect of the huge project on green cloud Island. As expected, they were all Huaxia people, and should be the elites of the Liu family.

There was also a middle – aged brown man named benilatti. He was a local of ponautu and had joined the construction project of green cloud Island eight years ago. His main responsibility was to coordinate various relationships. Of course, as the defense of blue cloud Island became stronger and stronger, some of the local forces in Carnelian no longer dared to covet blue cloud Island. There were fewer and fewer things that needed to be coordinated and settled, so in the past two years, the focus of binirati’s work was mainly on material procurement, worker recruitment, and other aspects.

After all, this place was isolated overseas. If all the required materials were transported from China, the cost would be much higher. Therefore, if the conditions allowed, they would purchase what could be purchased nearby, including some building materials. As long as the technical standards met the requirements, they would also be purchased locally.

In addition to some core projects that needed to be kept secret, the construction of such a large island also required a lot of workers. The salary of the local indigenous people was much lower than that of the domestic workers, so this project also recruited a large number of local workers.

Of course, these workers were restricted in their area of activity. They were forbidden from approaching some of the core areas that involved the island’s defense.

Bainilatti was currently putting a lot of energy into managing these workers.

Speaking of which, he was also one of the few people with real power in the construction project of green cloud Island.

After a simple welcoming ceremony, Liu Qingfeng enthusiastically led the way and invited Xia ruofei and Liu Kuan to get in the car at a parking lot not far away.

A group of people walked on the red carpet to the car. Xia ruofei and Liu Kuan naturally sat in the Toyota Elfa. Liu Qingfeng also sat in the front passenger seat of this car, while the other senior executives sat in the remaining two Mercedes – Benz.

“Uncle Liu, please arrange for my flight crew to take a rest after a long flight,” Xia ruofei said.

“Don’t worry, Mr. Xia. I’ve already given my orders. They will make the necessary arrangements.” Liu Kuan said.

“In addition, the plane needs to refuel. There should be a certain reserve at the airport of Qingyun Island, right?” Xia ruofei said,”how much should it be? I’ll settle the bill later.”

“You’re our distinguished guest,”Liu Kuan quickly said.”It’s normal for the plane to refuel here, so how can we ask you to pay?” Besides, didn’t I take the plane too? Do I still have to pay for the plane ticket?”

Even if paradise was fully filled, it wouldn’t cost much. Hearing Liu Kuan’s words, Xia ruofei didn’t refuse. He smiled and said,””Thank you, then.”

“You’re too kind!”

At this time, Liu Qingfeng turned his head and respectfully asked,””Mr. Xia, uncle Kuan, please give us your instructions on what to do next.”

“Mr. Xia is here for an inspection,” Liu Kuan said lightly.”I’ll show you around the island first. You have to go to all the places.”

“Then ... What about Mount Qingyun ...” Liu Qingfeng was stunned for a moment and asked.

“Did I not make myself clear enough? We have to go to all the places!” Liu Kuan said coldly,”remember, for Mr. Xia, there are no secrets on the island!”

Liu Qingfeng’s heart trembled slightly, and he quickly said,”Understood!”

“Mr. Xia, do you think this arrangement is okay?” Liu Kuan turned his head and asked.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”that’s good. Let’s do this!” In addition, I want to do a more comprehensive survey. It would be best if we can fly around the island ... I wonder if there are helicopters on the island?”

“There are! There are!” Liu Qingfeng quickly said,”the helipad is at the project department building, and the pilot is also on standby. You can take off at any time if you need to. ”

Xia ruofei said,”then let’s do it after the tour!” If it’s convenient to arrange!”

“Convenient! It’s convenient!” Liu Qingfeng quickly said.

The airport of Qingyun Island was very small, and the car soon slowly left the tarmac and continued to drive forward along the only asphalt road. Liu Qingfeng was responsible for explaining.

Green cloud Island was about three kilometers long from east to west, and two kilometers wide from north to south. There was a small mountain in the middle of the island, which had been named green cloud Mountain.

In addition, the island had a rare source of fresh water.

Xia ruofei realized that after years of construction, the green cloud Island had begun to take shape. There was a natural deep – Water port in the North, and a small dock had been built. The airport on the east side had also been put into use. A large part of the three – thousand – meter long runway was filled with land and extended into the sea.

There was also a large building and several villas of different sizes on the island, forming a Manor.

The building was currently being used by the project department. After the entire project was completed, this place would become an apartment – style residential building.

In addition, the interior of the small mountain in the middle of the island had almost been hollowed out, and an impregnable refuge had been built.

...

When the car drove into the fortification, Xia ruofei saw that the thick alloy gate was one or two meters thick. The inside of the mountain was a fortress made of reinforced concrete. At the same time, it stored a large amount of supplies. If there was any danger, the Liu family could quickly hide in the fallout shelter. After the alloy gate was locked, they could be completely isolated from the outside world. The supplies stored were enough to support hundreds of people for two years.

After looking around, Xia ruofei finally knew where the Liu family’s money had been spent. The fallout shelter alone probably took up 70% to 80% of the entire project. This was only what could be seen. A lot of money had been spent, and it could not be seen from the outside.

Of course, these things were not Xia ruofei’s concern. After the tour, he immediately mentioned that he wanted to take a helicopter and have a good look at the island.

This request was very reasonable in Liu Kuan’s eyes. He immediately told Liu Qingfeng to prepare a helicopter and offered to go with Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”uncle Liu, you’re not young anymore. The helicopter is so noisy and there’s a strong wind. It’s not stable. Don’t go up there. I’ll just fly two rounds around the island and come down!”

Liu Kuan thought about it and felt that Xia ruofei’s words made sense, so he nodded and said,””Mr. Xia, then I’ll be lazy. I’ll wait for you downstairs. Qingfeng has prepared a welcome banquet. You can come back as soon as possible after you’re done!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Soon, Liu Qingfeng had already asked people to prepare the helicopter, and the pilot was also Chinese.

This wasn’t a small sightseeing helicopter, but a super Jaguar. This plane, which cost hundreds of millions of Chinese dollars, must have been responsible for transporting people and resources.

Xia ruofei boarded the helicopter. For the convenience of observation, he sat next to the helicopter pilot, in the co-pilot’s seat. He quickly put on his headphones and waved to Liu Kuan, Liu Qingfeng, and the others in the distance.

The Super Jaguar rose slowly, then the nose of the plane lowered slightly and flew toward the east.
