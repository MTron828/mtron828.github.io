Chapter 654: Sensing the jadesleaf (3)

“Without master’s permission, I can’t enter the Archean realm.” Xia Qing said.

“I’ll Take You There directly!”Xia ruofei laughed.

With that, Xia ruofei brought Xia Qing back to the original space.

The aureum, wild ginseng, and iron – skinned stone Chi didn’t seem to catch Xia Qing’s attention. He only glanced at them indifferently, and then turned his eyes to the spirit heart tree.

“Spirit heart tree!” Xia Qing’s eyes brightened slightly as she said,”master, I know that there is a spirit heart tree in the Archean realm. I didn’t expect it to be such a huge one!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but roll his eyes. He looked at the spirit heart tree that was as tall as a person and so thin that it looked fragile. Was this spirit heart tree big?

Xia Qing strode over to the spirit heart tree and looked at it with eyes full of love.

When he saw the pistil of the spirit Heart Flower, his expression could not help but change.

Xia ruofei had just harvested the newly grown petals of the spirit Heart Flower in the morning, so there was only a single pistil left.

Xia ruofei looked at Xia Qing’s expression and couldn’t help but ask,””Xia Qing, is there a problem? I found that the petals of the spirit Heart Flower have a very good effect on curing diseases and strengthening the body for cultivation. Moreover, after picking them, they will grow again, so every time there is a new petal, I will pick it. ”

“Master,” Xia Qing said respectfully,”the spirit heart tree is indeed the best auxiliary for planting immortal herbs and spirit plants, and it also has a miraculous effect on curing illnesses and healing injuries. It was right for you to harvest the petals of the spirit Heart Flower in time.”

“Then why did you ...”

“Master,” Xia Qing sighed.”If I’m not wrong, you don’t really take care of this spirit heart tree, do you?”

......

Xia ruofei scratched his head in embarrassment and said,””The spiritual energy in this space is so rich. I just planted those Phoebe zhennan, wild ginseng and so on and left them alone. They’re all growing well!”

“How can these ordinary plants be compared to the spirit heart tree?” Xia Qing asked.

There was nothing wrong with that. Just the petals of the spirit Heart Flower alone were extremely precious. It would not be an exaggeration to say that it was the foundation of Xia ruofei’s life.

However, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but ask,””Xia Qing, how did you see that this spirit heart tree was neglected? I think it looks pretty good ...” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Xia Qing pointed at the stamen and said to Xia ruofei,””Master, I counted just now. This spirit Heart Flower should only have five petals, right?”

“Yeah! There were only three petals in the beginning!” Xia ruofei said,”it’s been five petals since then. Is there a problem?”

“Master, the spirit Heart flower’s final form should have nine petals,” said Xia Qing. And if it’s not taken care of and allowed to grow, five petals will be the limit. ”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei’s heart couldn’t help but skip a beat. He asked anxiously,””Xia Qing, you’re saying that ... If you take care of the spirit heart tree, you’ll be able to make this flower grow nine petals?”

This was simply too important. The petals of the spirit Heart Flower were one of Xia ruofei’s most important resources. He needed these petals in many aspects of his career. The difference between nine petals and five petals was like the difference between heaven and earth. The number of petals produced was almost doubled!

“Master, nine petals is the final form of the spirit Heart Flower,” Xia Qing said cautiously.”I can’t guarantee it, but if I take care of it for a long time, it can at least reach seven to eight petals!”
