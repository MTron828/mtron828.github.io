Chapter 1678: I’ve become a WiFi (1)

After the phone call with Guan Ping, Xia ruofei was also paying attention to the domestic online public opinion in Saipan. He was mainly worried that Guan Ping and the others had gone too far and caused the opposite effect, so he had to keep an eye on them.

Xia ruofei was also shocked by the popularity on Weibo. The topic #Passenger flying the plane #had reached the top of the hot search list in just one or two hours. A B – list celebrity had spent a lot of money to create a scandal and had finally made it to the top ten of the hot search list. However, it had been squeezed out in an instant. He was probably crying in the toilet.

Other than Weibo, Xia ruofei also saw the related notifications on the mainstream media’s WeChat official account. Although they were all piecing together the current news, the impact was incomparable.

The official WeChat accounts of these national media outlets were all Big V’s with tens of millions of fans, and their accounts were specially authorized by Penguin company, so they were not restricted to one push per day. They could push hot news immediately, and their fan activity was quite high.

Naturally, Xia ruofei paid the most attention to the updates on peach blossom company’s official Weibo.

When Guan Ping and the others released the promotion plan, he saw it immediately.

The new media’s tone was lighthearted and lively. This was the only way to get closer to the users. Hence, Xia ruofei only smiled at the content of the blog and didn’t think it was inappropriate.

The promotion plan was also considered satisfactory. The Paradise Corporation launched a promotion at the flagship stores of jingbei shopping mall and Tomcat shopping mall at the same time. In the additional sales this time, in addition to doubling the sales quota of the popular products such as the Jade skin cream, there were also certain discounts for iron – skinned dendrobes, Cordyceps, and Taoyuan Dahongpao.

In addition, the Paradise Corporation would also release 500 80% discount vouchers on each of the two e – commerce platforms, with a maximum discount of 10000 Yuan. In addition to these 80% discount godly vouchers, there were also a number of discount vouchers, and the number was relatively large.

The promotion would start at eighto’ clock in the evening, and the vouchers would be opened at Sixo’ clock sharp.

Meanwhile, kyokuboku shopping mall and Skycat shopping mall also coincidentally provided a free eye – catching display spot on the front page of the promotion event held by paradise corporation’s official flagship store.

The daily cost of such advertising spots was more than 100000 to 200000 Yuan. The fact that heavenly cat and kyokuboku were able to provide it for free showed how much importance they attached to paradise Corporation.

President Liu of jingbei shopping mall had met Xia ruofei in the capital, so he naturally knew a little about Xia ruofei’s background. In addition, as a self – made legendary elite, he also had a sense of appreciation for Xia ruofei. Of course, with his keen business sense, he was very clear about the development prospects of paradise Corporation. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

As for Chairman MA from the heavenly cat company, although he had never met Xia ruofei, he had already seen the sales miracles of the jadeshi ointment. Since kyokuboku shopping center was trying to build a good relationship with paradise Corporation, naturally, the heavenly cat company would not be left behind.

In fact, it was a miracle for a small company like the Paradise Corporation to be favored by tens of billions of Giants at the same time.

The netizens were naturally in high spirits. They didn’t know how difficult it was to get the jaded skin cream normally, and there was already more than one young lady who left a resentful message on the official Weibo of paradise Corporation. Today, not only did the supply double, but they even had the opportunity to buy it at a 20% discount. How could everyone not be happy?

They were all rubbing their fists and preparing to buy vouchers at 6 pm and 8 pm.

Xia ruofei looked at the comments on Weibo and couldn’t help but smile. He was very satisfied with the marketing department’s quick response. If Feng Jing wasn’t already on her break, he would have asked her to come and take a look. He wanted to let Feng Jing know that she didn’t have to keep an eye on the company. In the future, she wouldn’t have to do everything herself and might even be able to let go of her responsibilities.

Just as Xia ruofei was scrolling through Weibo, his phone rang again.

Seeing that it was Guan Ping calling again, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but have a headache. He thought to himself,”this kid is definitely up to no good!”

As expected, when Xia ruofei picked up, he heard Guan Ping asking with a smirk,””Boss Xia! Are you paying attention to the situation on our Weibo? The publicity seems to be very effective!”

“I’m about to turn into a Wi – Fi,”Xia ruofei said unhappily.” Who doesn’t want to use the hot spots!”

What he said was not wrong. It was not a big deal for their own company to freeload on the hot topics, but this matter had evolved into a Carnival on the internet. Many third – and fourth – tier, and even eighteenth – tier small stars had also begun to freeload on the hot topics. Anyway, there was no time for it.

A small – time model posted a very revealing photo and publicly expressed her love for Xia ruofei on the internet. She said that she had admired such a hero since she was young and that she was just short of offering herself to sleep with him ...

Guan Ping couldn’t help but burst out in laughter.

The peach blossom company was also taking this matter very seriously. After all, it involved the company’s chairman and general manager. Therefore, Dong Yun had arranged for someone to monitor the public opinion on the internet 24 hours a day. All the public opinions related to Xia ruofei had to be collected and sorted out to form an analysis report.

Hence, Guan Ping naturally knew about these details.

Xia ruofei had always wanted to keep a low profile, but this time, he could no longer keep a low profile. It was only because his friends were of a higher social class that he was able to keep a low profile. Otherwise, many media reporters would have found his phone number and called him for an interview.

Hence, Xia ruofei was indeed feeling a little depressed. He said,””Is there anything? You should be very busy right now! You still have the time to call me? If there’s nothing else, I’m hanging up!”
