“Uncle Dong, is this the person who sent it to you?” asked Liu Da.

“Yeah!” Liu Dong nodded. I don’t know who he is, but he promised me that he would give me more information, including the man’s identity and their date tonight ... Tonight’s location ...”

“What is he trying to do?” Da Liu asked with a frown.

Xu Yougang didn’t give the two any more time to think. He made another call.

Liu Dong had been holding his phone in his hand the whole time, so he answered the call without hesitation and put it on speaker.

He heard the mechanical, electronically synthesized voice say,””Mr. Liu, you have 15 minutes to prepare. You can think about what you need to prepare to catch an adulterer. After 15 minutes, I will tell you what to do next.”

The other party did not wait for Liu Dong’s reply and hung up the phone. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Da Liu asked,”d * MN, why does this person’s voice sound so weird?” It’s like a robot. ”

Liu Dong smiled bitterly.”That’s the voice of the reading App. This person is too cautious. Other than the first call, he’s either communicating on WeChat or speaking on his behalf through the app. I didn’t even have the chance to record his voice ...”

“Ignore him!” Da Liu said. Anyway, we were already prepared to catch them in the act of adultery! Let’s do as he said!”

“Mm! I’ll let you make the decision for these matters!” Liu Dong said tiredly.

Da Liu nodded and thought for a moment before saying,””Uncle Dong, we definitely can’t do this alone. I’ll have to call a few brothers, but don’t worry, they’re all people who can be trusted absolutely, and they’re very tight – lipped!”

“Alright!” Liu Dong said. You decide!”

Da Liu immediately took out his mobile phone and began to contact them. Several of his confidants had been playing at the night bar, so he quickly called four or five people.

“Brothers,” Da Liu said with a serious expression,”come with me to do something later. Prepare two cell phones with higher resolution. Also, bring the guys in the car!” And two barrels of red paint!”

Several of Da Liu’s confidants nodded one after another. Da Liu had a Guarantee Company business to begin with, and red paint was a must – have when he went to collect debts. As for steel pipes, watermelon knives, and other things, these people had them in their cars.

“Remember,” Da Liu continued,”just listen to my orders tonight. Later, no matter what you see, keep your mouth shut. Don’t let it rot. Understand?”

“Yes! Da!” Da Liu’s confidants all agreed.

“Go and prepare!” Da Liu waved his hand and said.

Not long after Da Liu’s men left the private room, Liu Dong received a WeChat message from justice is not absent: “You can go now. Get in the car and drive in the direction of Lakeside Road!” He said.

Liu Dong immediately handed the phone to Da Liu and said,””He wants us to go in the direction of Lakeside Road!”

Da Liu took a look and couldn’t help but swear,””This guy is definitely up to no good. He’s just playing tricks ...”

“So what if I know?” Liu Dong smiled bitterly. Don’t we have to do as they say?”

“Don’t let me find out who he is!”Da Liu snorted coldly.

“Da, don’t talk so much ...” Liu Dong quickly said.”I feel like that person is right next to us. Our every move can’t escape his eyes ...”

“So what?” Liu Da said,”this kind of person only dares to hide in the dark. Do you have the ability to come out openly?”

In the rented house, Xu Yougang couldn’t help but laugh.

Da Liu was still too wild. To be honest, he felt that the feeling of controlling everything in the dark was much better than fighting and killing on the front line. Even if he really stood in front of Da Liu, he was afraid that a gangster leader like Da Liu and a few gangsters couldn’t even touch a hair of his.

“Forget it, da,” Liu Dong said,”just cut it out!” We still have to rely on other people to point the way!”

Da Liu snorted unwillingly and said,””I understand ... Uncle Dong, let’s go!”

Da Liu led Dong Liu out of the private room, and the two burly men who were guarding the door immediately followed.

As he walked out of the bar, the people who were drunk here all made way for him and respectfully greeted him. In this bar, Da Liu was the king at the top of the food chain.

Da Liu walked out expressionlessly, occasionally nodding slightly to one or two familiar – looking people, which was enough to make those people feel proud and proud.

When Liu Dong came in, it took him a lot of effort to squeeze in, but it was much easier when he walked out. Soon, the two arrived at the entrance of the bar.

Da Liu’s confidants had already prepared a Jinbei van and were respectfully standing in front of the door, waiting.

“Is everything ready?” Da Liu came to the car and asked.

“Brother da, don’t worry! Everything has been prepared as you’ve instructed. ” A big man with a fierce – looking face said with a smile. He could not help but ask,”brother da, whose house are we going to collect debts from?”

“Scar, it’s not a good thing to be too curious!” Da Liu glanced at him and said.

The muscles on the face of the burly man nicknamed Ba Zi twitched and he quickly said,”Brother da, I’ve spoken too much. I deserve a beating!”

After he finished speaking, he made a gesture of slapping himself.

Da Liu said indifferently,”Alright, alright, stop acting with me!” If you’re ready, then set off!”

“Yes! Da!”

Da Liu and Dong Liu sat in the middle row of the van, squeezing three people out of the back. This time, Da Liu brought five people with him, including the driver and scar, who was sitting in the front passenger seat.

“Drive towards Lakeside Road!” Da Liu said indifferently.

“Alright, brother da!” The driver quickly replied.

The Jinbei bread set off slowly and soon left Chunfeng Road. It turned into the Second Ring Road and sped in the direction of Lakeside Road.

A Jetta and a van also started quietly in the night, following the Jinbei van from a distance.

At this time, it was already past the evening peak hour, and the road conditions were not bad. The Jinbei car drove for about 20 minutes and arrived at Hubin Road.

Hubin Road was built along the east side of West Lake Park, and on one side of the road was the glistening West Lake Park. The stone bridges and pavilions in the park were all lit up, and the outlines of these buildings were faintly visible in the dark night. In the man – made Lake in the park, many small boats were slowly moving forward. They could faintly hear the laughter coming from the lake, and the atmosphere was very warm and quiet.

“Uncle Dong, what’s our next move?” “Didn’t that guy send you a WeChat message?” Da Liu asked.

“Not yet ...” Liu Dong said,”I’m just asking!”

His voice trembled slightly because he knew that he was getting closer and closer to his betraying wife. His intuition told him that Fang Chenchen should be in the vicinity.

Liu Dong didn’t call the man because he knew that he would be rejected.

He directly asked on WeChat,”we’ve arrived at Hu Bin road, where do we go next?”

In the rented house, Xu Yougang stared at the real – time image on the computer screen and sent a one – Word reply to Liu Dong on WeChat,”Wait!

“Wait?” Liu Dong could not help but mumble to himself,”da, he told us to wait at Hu Bin road ...”

“Then, let’s stop at the side!” Da Liu said to the driver.

“Alright, brother da!” The driver said.

In fact, no parking was allowed on Hubin Road, and the surveillance cameras and global cameras were very closely distributed. If you parked in a non – motorized Lane, you would definitely be caught and fined. However, Da Liu naturally didn’t care about the violation. As for the fine, he naturally didn’t care.

Fortunately, Xu Yougang didn’t make Liu Dong and the others wait for too long. After a while, Xu Yougang received a WeChat message from Zeng Liang, telling him that Liu haojun’s driver, Lao Zhou, had already left West Lake Mansion in Liu haojun’s car. They were heading straight out of the city. It looked like they were going back to Changping.

After seeing the message, Xu Yougang immediately sent a message to Liu Dong.
