Chapter 1102: Chapter 694 – Green eyes (3)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei quickly replied,”it’s still in the clinical trial stage. The approval process is relatively complicated. However, everything is going smoothly. It’s not far from the official launch ...”

“Very good!” Elder song said, pleased. This was a great thing that would benefit the country and the people! Every year, a large number of children with autism are born in our country. So far, there is no medicine in the world that is effective for treating autism. Your company’s development of this medicine is equivalent to filling the gap in the world’s medicine! You must do this well. If you have any difficulties, you can directly report to me!”

Xia ruofei’s expression turned serious and he said respectfully,””Yes, chief!”

Tian Huilan, who was standing at the side, also looked at Xia ruofei with some emotion. She could empathize with the pain of an autistic family because her sister, Tian Huixin, had encountered such a misfortune. It was also because of Xia ruofei that Huanhuan could walk out of her lonely world and become a cheerful and lively normal child.

Elder song continued to ask about Xia ruofei’s company. The more they heard, the more they felt that Xia ruofei was not a simple person. It was not because he had such a big business at such a young age. In fact, Xia ruofei’s business was very small in the eyes of everyone in the room. However, it was the first time that they saw elder song care about Xia ruofei’s small matters. They were even more shocked.

Elder song usually dealt with major national affairs. It was not an exaggeration to say that the appointment of a Department – Level or even a Deputy – Level leader was not a big deal to elder song. Even though he had retired, his influence was still huge. Perhaps one word from him could determine the direction of a policy.

Now, he was so concerned about a small company in the southeast province. This young man’s future was limitless!

Elder song chatted with Xia ruofei for a while and then smiled.””Ruofei, go ahead and find song Rui and the others! It’s time to eat in a while! I guess you’ll feel uncomfortable with us old men ...”

Xia ruofei was a little embarrassed as he said,””Okay, chief. I’ll go down first ...”

“Go!” Elder song waved his hand. When we eat later, you have to drink a few more glasses with me!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said. Then, he greeted the big bosses in the house and left the central room.

In fact, Xia ruofei was not afraid at all. Ever since he had the spirit map space and stepped on the path of cultivation, Xia ruofei’s mentality had changed a lot unconsciously. In this room, there were high – ranking officials of the border and leaders of the Ministry. Perhaps ordinary people would feel uncomfortable in the face of their power, but Xia ruofei had always been very calm.

Of course, Xia ruofei was more willing to be with song Rui than with the elders. After all, they had more common topics to talk about.

Xia ruofei walked into the courtyard and heard song Zhilan remind him,””Xia, don’t forget about the jaded skin cream!”

The sound of everyone’s friendly laughter came from the house. Xia ruofei stopped and turned around with a smile. “Don’t worry! Aunty song, I’ll ask song Rui to get it from the hotel with me!”

After leaving the backyard, Xia ruofei gave song Rui a call.””I’m out. Where are you?”

“Over here in the southern room!” Song Rui said,”just come over! Eat here later!” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Hence, Xia ruofei walked towards the south room. He pushed the door open and realized that the room was huge. It must have connected several rooms in the South.

There were five large round tables in the southern room, and there was a small table behind the table in the middle with a large “longevity” character hanging behind it.

The table closest to the door was already filled with eight or nine people. Song Rui waved at Xia ruofei and called out,””RUO Fei, this way!”

Xia ruofei followed the voice and was stunned when he saw the people at the table.
