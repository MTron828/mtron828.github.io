Chapter 775: Heading straight for the target_1

“In order to avoid alerting the enemy and endangering the safety of the hostages, we’ll still be the main force of this operation. The police, the military, and other units will be responsible for guarding and cooperating with us on the periphery!” Guo Zhan nodded.

Then Guo Zhan said to Deputy Director Lu,””Chief Lu, we can’t rule out the possibility that they have left some people in the city to gather information, so we have to maintain the high – pressure investigation in the city. Also, don’t deliberately turn the search Center to Changping County. We have to give the Japanese the illusion that we have no clue.”

“Understood!” Deputy bureau chief Lu said simply,”don’t worry, Colonel Guo! We, the police force, will fully cooperate with this operation! If you need anything, just contact me directly!”

“Thanks!” Guo Zhan and Deputy Director Lu shook hands.

Then, he waved at Xia ruofei and Tian Feilong and said,””Take little black and we’ll set off!”

Xiao hei had unexpectedly played a surprising role in this operation and gave Guo Zhan a surprise.

He would need Blackie’s help when he went to search the nearby town of Lingang in Changping.

The three of them brought Blackie to the courtyard of the Public Security Bureau.

The other squad members were on standby in the car.

There were a total of 12 people in the two teams, including Xia ruofei. Everyone took two separate black MPVs and left the Public Security Bureau’s courtyard one after the other, heading out of the city. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei’s Knight XV off – Road vehicle was too eye – catching. It would attract a lot of attention wherever it went. It definitely could not be used for disguising and investigation, so it was simply left in the courtyard of the Public Security Bureau. He would come back to get it after the operation.

The two vehicles had the local license plates of San Shan city, but Xia ruofei could clearly sense that they had been modified. They were even equipped with bulletproof armor. One look and he could tell that they were provided by the special department for the lone wolf assault team to carry out missions.

In the car, Tian Feilong sat in the front passenger seat, while Guo Zhan and Xia ruofei sat in the two relatively spacious seats in the middle row. There were two other members in the back seat. In addition to the assault team member who was acting as the driver, there were exactly six people in the car.

......

Tian Feilong and the two team members in the back seat were silently loading bullets with empty magazines.

Blackie lay quietly at Xia ruofei’s feet. There was an aura similar to the spirit map space on Xia ruofei’s body, which made Blackie very comfortable. It was willing to stay closer to Xia ruofei whenever it was free.

Guo Zhan gestured to the two assault team members in the back seat. The two of them immediately lifted an alloy box from under their seats and handed it to the front.

“Blood Wolf, pick your equipment!” Guo Zhan said. Feilong, go to the back of the car and get a bulletproof vest for Blood Wolf!”

“Yes!”

Xia ruofei said,”Captain, there’s no need for the bulletproof vest. We’re mainly here for disguising ourselves. It’s too obvious to wear a bulletproof vest in the summer. Let’s wait until the official operation!”

“Do you have any suggestions for this operation, RUO Fei?” Guo Zhan asked after some thought.

Xia ruofei said without thinking,”let’s find a place to settle down in the county first!” We’ll split up at night to look for clues. Don’t act rashly if you find anything. We’ll act together when everyone is gathered. ”

Guo Zhan pondered for a moment and said,”well, according to the suspicious areas marked out by the police Skynet system, it’s indeed more efficient to act separately.” Sanguine Wolf, you pick your equipment! Even if you are a disguised Scout, you have to bring along a handy weapon. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and opened the alloy box.

There was a dazzling array of weapons and equipment inside. There were standard military equipment and some Special Forces equipment from the foreign Army. Xia ruofei was not surprised at all. The lone wolf assault team was the most elite special Forces. Their equipment guarantee was the best and had to be able to adapt to the needs of different missions.

Xia ruofei did not think much and picked up a Type 92 9mm pistol. This was the standard equipment of the Chinese army, which was distributed to the Chiefs of regiments and above, the Special Forces, and some of the armed police.

Although it was standard equipment, and the type 92 9mm pistol was not as good as similar pistols from overseas in terms of craftsmanship and longevity, it was especially suitable for the hands of the Chinese. Xia ruofei had a special liking for this pistol.

The type 92 also had a 5.8mm pistol. Compared to this pistol, the 9mm pistol had a greater recoil and was more difficult to master. Relatively speaking, its shooting accuracy would be worse.

However, when Xia ruofei was still in lone wolf, he could use the type 92 9mm pistol to shoot and hit the 10th ring with every shot. Now that his physical strength and strength had undergone a complete transformation, it was naturally easier for him to control the gun.

In fact, this pistol was a compulsory piece of equipment for Xia ruofei when he was serving lone wolf. When Xia ruofei held it in his hand, he felt like he could control it as if it was his own arm.

Xia ruofei skillfully picked out a few fully loaded magazines for the type 92 9mm pistol from the box. Then, he smiled and closed the box.”This old partner is enough!”

Guo Zhan couldn’t help but laugh,”you’re quite single – minded, aren’t you!”

Xia ruofei chuckled and put away the gun and the magazine.

When they arrived at Changping County, the group booked six standard rooms in a business hotel in Changping County.

As a ‘special team member’, Xia ruofei was in the same room as Guo Zhan.

Everyone had a simple lunch in the command center of the Public Security Bureau, so Guo Zhan ordered everyone to have a good rest in their rooms in the afternoon and recuperate. After dark, they would split up and go to several suspicious areas analyzed by the Skynet system to carry out a disguise investigation.
