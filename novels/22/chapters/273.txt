Xia ruofei turned around immediately when he heard her voice. He smiled and said,””Song Rui? You’re here too, kid!” The person who called out to Xia ruofei was the eldest young master of the song family, song Zhengping’s son, song Rui. He was very close to Xia ruofei during the days they spent in Hongzhou and they even called each other brothers. The last time Xia ruofei flew back to the three mountains, song Rui even thought that elder song was there to act as a Vanguard and fly back with Xia ruofei. “Nonsense! This is my grandfather’s place, why can’t I be here?” Song Rui laughed and scolded,”my main mission in the three mountains is to accompany Grandpa!” “Come on, you!” Xia ruofei exposed him mercilessly.”Your main mission is to accompany the various beauties in Sanshan city, right?” “This is definitely pure slander!” Song Rui said righteously,”how can a good young man with ideals and moral integrity like me linger around beautiful women?” Xia ruofei rolled his eyes and said,”I seem to remember someone boasting about poison Dragon and double resonance ...” “RUO Fei! That ... You must be tired! I’ll take you to your room to rest!” Song Rui quickly changed the topic and said to manager Lu, who was standing beside Xia ruofei,”Uncle Lu, leave ruofei to me. You don’t have to worry about him!” “Sure, song Rui,” manager Lu said with a smile.”Dr. Xia’s room is on the easternmost end of the third floor. I’ll have to trouble you to bring him there!” “No problem, no problem.” Song Rui said repeatedly,”Uncle Lu, you can go and do your work!” After manager Lu left, song Rui complained in a low voice,””Be careful with what you say, kid. If Uncle Lu heard you, my dad would’ve called in a few minutes to yell at you ...” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it seems that the fearless young master Song has a weakness!” “Nonsense! My dad is kind to everyone, but he’s fierce when it comes to lecturing me!” Song Rui said, then mumbled,”sometimes I wonder if I’m his biological child ...” Xia ruofei was speechless. This young master Song was really a Blabbermouth. He just opened his mouth and said everything! The two of them chatted as they walked towards the room manager Lu had arranged for Xia ruofei. Song Rui suddenly thought of something and said with a smile,””Ruofei, I almost forgot to tell you. Do you know what’s going on with that B * stard Liang Haitao? Hahaha! I can’t help but want to laugh three times when I think about it! This grandson was severely reprimanded by his family’s old man, and then ...” Speaking of this, song Rui couldn’t help but laugh a few times before he continued,””Then, he was transferred from the military’s most awesome General Hospital to the health center of a missile Brigade in the Gobi Desert in the Northwest!” “Oh, really? “It’s a little tragic ...” Xia ruofei said and then smiled evilly.”But why don’t I feel sorry for you?” “Hahahaha!” Song Rui also laughed and said,”he deserves it! What the f * ck! You even dared to delay my grandfather’s illness. If the Liang family wasn’t sincere this time, our family would definitely not let this go!” Song Rui continued,”but this grandson is lucky!” If he continues to stay in the capital, I will definitely beat him to death the next time I return to the capital!” “Come on!” Xia ruofei rolled his eyes and said,”if you really do that, your father will beat you up even more miserably than Liang Haitao!” Song Rui shrank his neck and said dejectedly,””This old man’s life is really bitter! To have such a tyrant for a father!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”your reincarnation skills are good enough, aren’t they?” He was born as a young master of one of the top red family clans in China. If that’s already a tough life, then what are the lives of people like me?” Song Rui sighed.”An illustrious family background ... Hehe. To quote a saying in Fortress Besieged, this aristocratic family is also like a Fortress Besieged. The people outside the city want to enter, but the people in the city ...” Xia ruofei didn’t wait for song Rui to finish acting cool and said,””People outside the city want to go in. You people in the city really know how to play!” Song Rui was stunned for a moment, then he couldn’t help but burst into laughter. After a long while, he held his stomach and said,””Ruofei, I feel that you have the potential to be a comedian!” “Who told you to pretend to be depressed?” Xia ruofei rolled his eyes and said,”Alright, alright. I can go to the room on the East End of the third floor by myself. I don’t need a young master like you to send me off personally!” Song Rui rolled his eyes and said,””RUO Fei, it’s still early and you’re already going back to your room to sleep? The nightlife has just begun!” “Nonsense. Do you think I’m like you?” Xia ruofei said,”I still have an important mission to protect your grandfather tomorrow! You must make sure you sleep tonight. ” Then, Xia ruofei looked at song Rui and said,””Besides ... Don’t tell me you dare to go out and have fun in the middle of the night?” “Brother, life is hard ...” Song Rui said gloomily. Xia ruofei laughed out loud. He patted song Rui’s shoulder and went straight to his room. Xia ruofei boiled a kettle of water, hung his coat and gun on the hook, and went to the bathroom to take a shower. After taking a shower, he changed into cotton pajamas and made a pot of tea with boiled water. He sat on the chair and drank tea while thinking about tomorrow’s schedule in his mind. After going through all the details that he needed to pay attention to, Xia ruofei went to the balcony to smoke a cigarette. Then, he went to bed and told song Rui that he was not being perfunctory. It was a habit that he had developed over the years. Before an important task, he must ensure that he had enough sleep. Xia ruofei closed his eyes and his mind entered the space. He didn’t necessarily go into the space every day, but he would check it with his mind before going to bed. If there was anything wrong with the plants and animals in the space, he would be able to notice it immediately. It was just a routine check, but Xia ruofei actually found a small problem. When his mind swept through the new space, he found that there were two or three Hornets flying in the space. Xia ruofei had covered the entire hornet’s nest with iron. It was unknown if the metal window was damaged or if the joint was not tight enough, but three hornet’s nest had escaped. Furthermore, the Hornets were chasing after xiaohei and the rest. Xiaohei and the rest must have suffered a loss. They could not do anything to the Hornets in the sky, so they could only escape in all directions. Xia ruofei’s expression changed slightly as he subconsciously ordered. Under the effect of the invisible spatial force, the few wasps instantly disappeared from the new space. The next moment, they appeared in this room. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be stunned. He had not summoned the spirit map from his palm just now. Instead, he had been using his mind to contact the space to patrol. When he ordered the Hornet to move to the outside world, it was a subconscious reaction. He did not consider that he had not summoned the spirit map. In the past, he had to summon the spirit map scroll from his palm to take out or put items into the space. He had tried many times but failed to store and withdraw items without summoning the spirit map scroll. That was why it had always been very inconvenient. If he wanted to put things into the space or take things out, he had to summon the scroll from his palm first. The scroll was quite big and obvious, so he had to find a relatively hidden place. There was no way to do it without anyone knowing. Could it be that this was a change after the upgrade of the realm, and he had not noticed it? Xia ruofei was overjoyed. The three Hornets were not used to the sudden change in environment, but they quickly found their target and flapped their wings towards Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei did not panic and directly gave the Hornets an order with his mind. The three Hornets immediately circled around Xia ruofei like obedient babies, without any offensive power. After a week, Xia ruofei could now control nearly 50 Hornets. Three Hornets was nothing to him. Xia ruofei was still thinking about what had just happened, so he decided to use his mind and the three Hornets disappeared again. This time, Xia ruofei had been observing the situation in the new space with his mind. He could clearly sense that the Hornet had returned to the new space and had appeared in the iron cage according to his instructions. It really worked! Xia ruofei was surprised and happy. Then, his eyes widened as he suddenly realized something else.
