Chapter 1593: New ambiance.1

Translator: 549690339

The person who walked into the canteen was Dong Yun, who was wearing a professional suit.

Xia ruofei saw Dong Yun picking up her plate and ordering food with ease. He was a little surprised. He pouted in her direction and asked,””Sister che, is this lady still in our company?”

“You don’t want her to stay in our company?” Feng Jing asked with a smile.

Xia ruofei shrugged his shoulders and said,”since she’s someone you like, of course I hope that she can officially join the company!” But I thought they looked down on our company?”

“Don’t say that when she’s here!”Feng Jing said.

“What’s the situation?” Xia ruofei quickly asked.

“Based on my observation these days, Dong Yun’s impression of our company must have changed a lot.” Feng Jing looked at Dong Yun and said in a low voice,”maybe it’s because you stood up for her mother last time and even treated her mother’s burn, so she has a good impression of our company. Her temporary consultant job was already over, but she didn’t ask to leave ...”

Xia ruofei’s eyes lit up and he asked,”Oh?” So there was a chance? Can we make her stay?”

Feng Rao smiled and said,”then I’ll have to ask you, the chairman, to show respect to the wise!” You can find an opportunity to take the initiative to mention it to her! In fact, whether it’s the position or the salary, our company is definitely not worse than those big companies in the world’s top 500. As for the career development prospects, it depends on the individual’s opinion. At least, I think that paradise Corporation has great potential, and if she stays, she will be a strong candidate for the Vice President. I believe she can see this. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and then frowned.””It’s not good ... For me to bring it up, right? Wouldn’t there be a suspicion that he’s forcing me to repay him?”

“Aren’t your thoughts too complicated?” Feng Jing replied,”you already made it clear last time that you wouldn’t force her to stay like last time. Now, she’s the one who’s willing to stay. You’re the boss of the company, so if you don’t have to break through this layer of paper, who else can do it?”

“You sound like you’re wooing a girl ...” Xia ruofei said with a bitter smile.

“Dong Yun’s not bad either! You don’t like cold and beautiful women?” Feng Rao looked at Xia ruofei and asked with a faint smile.

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly. From the corner of his eye, he saw that Dong Yun had already prepared breakfast and was walking towards them. He quickly put on a straight face and said,””Let’s not talk about this, she’s coming!”

Feng Jing couldn’t help but chuckle. She then waved at Dong Yun from afar.

Dong Yun glanced over and walked over.

“Director Xia, long time no see ...” Dong Yun said after glancing at Xia ruofei. At the same time, she nodded at Feng Jing and sat down beside her.

Xia ruofei was a little embarrassed. He scratched his head and said,”Good Morning!”

After Dong Yun sat down, she buried her head in her breakfast and did not say much. On the other hand, after a few looks from Feng Jing, Xia ruofei felt that it was inappropriate to speak. Thus, the breakfast ended in an awkward atmosphere.

Dong Yun was the latest to arrive, but she was the first to finish eating.

She picked up her plate and said to Feng Jing,””Boss Feng, I still want to go to the pharmaceutical factory to do some research today. Can you please arrange a car for me?”

“Oh, no problem! What time are you leaving?” Feng Rao asked with a smile.

Dong Yun raised her hand to look at her watch and then said,”If the pilot can make it in time, then ... In twenty minutes?” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Alright!” Feng Rao readily agreed.

Dong Yun carried her plate to the staff in the canteen who were collecting the cutlery. Feng Jing beckoned for Lei Hu, who was also having his breakfast in the canteen, and immediately arranged for Dong Yun to use the car.

Lei Hu went to arrange the car while Feng Jing looked at Xia ruofei helplessly and said,””Ruofei, why aren’t you saying anything? I’m not ...”

“Sister che, I don’t know how to start!” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”We still need an opportunity for this. Besides, isn’t it a little insincere to invite him in the cafeteria?”

“Maybe the opportunity you want hasn’t even arrived, and she’ll be poached by another company!” Feng Jing said unhappily,”do you think she’s just a consultant in our company these days? She’s already sent out God knows how many resumes, and there are many companies that are interested in her!”

“I know, I know ...” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ll be quick about this!”

“It’s true that the Emperor isn’t in a hurry ...” Feng Rao mumbled. She suddenly realized that the metaphor was inappropriate and had put herself in an awkward situation, so she shut her mouth in time.

“Sister ran, I’m done. What about you?” Xia ruofei tried to hold back his laughter.

“I’ve also finished eating!” Feng Rao hurriedly said,”don’t run! Let’s go straight to the office! I’ll give you a report on my recent work!”

“Where can i run to!” Xia ruofei laughed bitterly and shrugged.”This is my own company!”

Feng Rao couldn’t help but burst into laughter. The two of them carried their plates to the tableware recycling area and nodded to the employees who greeted them from time to time.

......

In Xia ruofei’s office, he and Feng Jing sat in the guest area.

Xia ruofei skillfully took out a tea set and started boiling water to make tea, while Feng Jing started to report on the company’s recent work.

The first few days of Xia ruofei’s absence were holidays, but the company’s operations were still as usual, especially the pharmaceutical factory, which was still producing non – stop. Feng Jing was the first to report on the pharmaceutical factory’s situation.

Now, whether it was the heart – nourishing soup or the jaded skin cream, they had all become the fist products of the peach blossom company.

Needless to say, the jaded skin ointment was always sold out in the shortest time possible, and the supply was always in short supply.

Now, a new group of scalpers had been born. They specialized in buying the jaded skin cream and then reselling it to earn the difference.

It was said that on some trading websites, the price of the authentic jaded skin cream was a lot higher than the price that the peach blossom company officially sold, and there were even situations where the price was doubled.

Although the profit of heart – nourishing soup was relatively small, it could not withstand the support of the country! This was a great thing that benefited the country and the people. It was a blessing for those with autism. All the hospitals in the country hoped to get enough heart – nourishing soup, but with the current production capacity of Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory, it definitely couldn’t meet the requirements.

Feng Rao gave a simple report of the situation and said,””We’ve already made arrangements for the expansion of production before the new year. The new production line will start installing and debugging soon, but the pharmaceutical factory has some concerns. The supply of raw materials is still unknown ...”

Xia ruofei said directly,”there’s no problem with the raw materials!” I have my own channels! Tell them to be at ease!”

Both the Jade skin cream and the heart – nourishing soup were pure Traditional Chinese Medicine products, so they were very dependent on the raw materials.

However, the peach blossom company was well prepared. In addition to signing a large purchase contract in the early stage to guarantee the supply, they also signed a supply and marketing agreement with the farmers in the suburbs of Sanshan. The farmers were responsible for planting, while the peach blossom pharmaceutical factory provided technical guidance and was responsible for purchasing all the goods at the agreed price.

In addition, Xia ruofei’s spirit map space had expanded several times, and there was a lot of idle land. He had already asked Xia Qing to continue expanding the herb garden.

Even if the outside world could not supply them, as long as the herbs Xia ruofei planted in the spirit map space could mature in batches, he was confident that he could ensure the supply of raw materials.

Hence, Xia ruofei was very confident.

“That’s good!” Feng Jing heaved a sigh of relief and said,”there’s one more thing. Our overseas business division has received many emails from foreign pharmaceutical companies. All of them, without exception, hope to be the retail agent for the heart nourishing soup overseas.”

“There’s no need to rush the foreigners!” Xia ruofei said,”we can’t even meet the domestic demand! Good medicine must be given to our country’s children first! Just let those foreign patients wait!”

In fact, if the heart – nourishing soup was sold abroad, it was normal for the price to increase by several times. After all, the main purpose of selling it in China was not to make a profit. However, there was no psychological pressure at all to make money from the foreigners.

However, Xia ruofei would rather not earn money and ensure the supply to the domestic market first. Although this was a little foolish in business, Feng Jing was still impressed.

Hence, Feng Jing did not try to persuade Xia ruofei. Instead, she continued with her report.

She had sorted out all the work she had done during this period of time, and a lot of the data was quite accurate and full. It was obvious that she had been well prepared.

Xia ruofei was also listening attentively with a focused expression.

The Paradise Corporation had a lot of business to do now. In addition to the pharmaceutical factory, they also sold paradise vegetables, wild Chinese perch, paradise Dahongpao, as well as the sales of Dendrobium candids and Cordyceps sinensis.

In addition, there were many different sales channels. In addition to the traditional offline channels, the development of e – commerce was also quite fast.

In addition, the company’s structure was being adjusted, and many new departments were still in the process of getting used to each other. All kinds of work coordination also needed time to be straightened out.

Hence, Feng Jing reported quite a lot of things. From 8 am to 10 am, Feng Jing spoke for more than two hours.

Xia ruofei was not impatient at all. He listened attentively. At the same time, he was filled with admiration and gratitude towards Feng Jing. With such a responsible and capable general manager, how could paradise Corporation not prosper?

“Sister che, it’s been hard on you!” Xia ruofei said sincerely.

Under Xia ruofei’s gaze, Feng Rao’s face heated up and she said softly,””Why are you suddenly so polite?”

“It’s just an emotional speech!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sometimes, I feel that I’m really lucky to have you as my general!”

“Then why don’t you treat me better?” Feng Rao chuckled. Be careful, I might jump ship and run away!”

“It’s a must!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll inform the Human Resources Department and give you a raise!”

“Don’t mess around!”Feng Rao quickly said. The personnel grading system has just been implemented, and everything has to be backed up by evidence. You, as the boss, can’t be the first to break the rules and create a local policy!”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”then I’ll just give you another share ...”

“You can stop!” Feng Rao was so shocked that she stopped Xia ruofei before he could finish his sentence. She said,”I’m not done reporting! Don’t interrupt!”

“Is there anything else?” Xia ruofei felt a little strange.”I feel like you’ve almost finished explaining the company’s business!”

“I really don’t know what kind of boss you are!” Feng Jing rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,”have you forgotten about the most important task?”
