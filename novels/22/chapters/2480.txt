Zhuo Yiyi rolled her eyes at song Rui and said,””I don’t want to play with him! Sister Qingxue, I’ll go with you to the private restaurant!”

Therefore, in the blink of an eye, everyone left, Leaving Song Rui holding the cue stick in a mess.

Song Rui was stunned for a while before he shouted,””Hey! Wait for me! If all of them leave, I’m not playing with air! Yiyi, don’t be so heartless as to leave me behind ...”

……

The Elfa van was driving smoothly on the road back to the Urban area.

Xia ruofei and Song Wei sat in the most comfortable seats in the middle row. Song Wei’s face was still red.

At this time, the glass partition had already been raised, so Wu Qiang, who was in the front driving area, could not hear their conversation.

“Ruofei, do you think brother Zhao and uncle song Rui have noticed something?” Song Wei asked nervously.

Xia ruofei said nonchalantly,”you really think they’re super detectives?” And even if they did see something, they would definitely not go out and gossip! They knew the severity of this! Don’t worry!”

Song Rui and Zhao Yongjun were Xia ruofei’s best friends. Even if they knew that Xia ruofei had an affair with Song Wei, they would not spread the news. Instead, they would help Xia ruofei keep this secret.

“That means ... They really found out?” Song Wei asked, worried.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Weiwei, it’s just an assumption ... Don’t worry!” By the way ... Did you just say ‘brother Zhao’ and’ uncle song Rui ‘? The seniority is really messy ...”

Song Wei couldn’t help but burst out laughing and said, “It’s true! You’re with me, so you should call song Rui uncle!”

“In his dreams!” Xia ruofei immediately said,”let’s see if Xiao Rui dares to let me call him uncle when we really publicize our relationship in the future! I dare to call him, but he doesn’t dare to answer! Do you believe me?”

Song Wei’s eyes were a little dazed as she mumbled,”Will our relationship ... Really be made public one day?”

Xia ruofei went over and hugged Song Wei’s shoulder. He said softly,””There must be ... We are cultivators. What kind of danger can stop us?”

“Yeah!” Song Wei nodded. I believe you ...”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Let’s not talk about this. Qingxue reminded me yesterday. We should find a suitable martial art for uncle song as soon as possible!”

“Ah?” Song Wei turned to look at Xia ruofei in surprise.

Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s a blessing in disguise for uncle song. His body is more suitable for cultivation now. We can’t waste it!” Moreover, regardless of how much he could achieve if he started cultivating at this age, at least his body would be better after cultivating! Isn’t it good to live a long life?”

“Of course it’s good!” Song Wei said,”but ... It’s not that easy to find a cultivation technique, right?”

Xia ruofei chuckled,”to other cultivators, martial arts techniques might be more precious than anything else, but I’m different!” I know quite a few cultivation techniques, but the problem now is that I don’t know which one is the most suitable for uncle song. I’m just having a problem with choosing!”

“You’re bragging!”Song Wei laughed.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue did not know the secret of the spirit map space, nor did they know that Xia ruofei was not lying. He had obtained a lot of techniques from the Jade talisman of inheritance. Although these techniques could not be compared to the “great Dao technique”, and were even slightly inferior to the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra”, any one of them could cause a crazy fight in the current cultivation world of Huaxia.

After all, the world of cultivation had declined and cultivation resources were scarce. Most of the cultivation techniques that Xia ruofei had obtained from the inheritance talisman could be used to maintain his cultivation to the nascent Soul Stage or even higher. These kinds of cultivation techniques were very rare in the cultivation world of Huaxia. Even if there were, most of them were incomplete.

Xia ruofei didn’t explain much and just said,””Anyway, I’ll choose a cultivation technique that suits uncle song the most. However ... How to tell him about it is still a problem!”

Song Qiming had received a materialistic education since he was young. He was now a high – ranking official in the system. It was not easy to make him believe in cultivation. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Xia ruofei continued,”let’s not think too much!” Anyway, there would always be a way out when they reached the mountain! If I can ‘t, I’ll show you the magical means of a cultivator on the spot!”

“My dad will definitely think that it’s a magic trick!” Song Wei laughed.

Xia ruofei leaned back in his chair dejectedly and smiled bitterly.””That’s possible ... Forget it, I’ll just take it one step at a time! Uncle song must be able to feel the spiritual Qi in the air now. It’s just that he doesn’t have a cultivation technique, so he can’t absorb spiritual Qi on his own! When the time comes, I’ll help him guide him and let him experience that magical feeling for himself. He won’t think that it’s a smokescreen, right?”

“En!” Song Wei nodded her head and said,”thank you, ruofei!”

“Silly girl! You’re not allowed to be so formal between us!” Xia ruofei said as he flicked Song Wei’s nose lovingly.

After the car returned to the courtyard house, Wu Qiang asked Xia ruofei if she wanted to go back to Tao Yuan Association to wait for Ling Qingxue.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”no need. The club will send a car to send Qingxue back.” Wu Qiang, you’ve also been tired for most of the day, go and rest first! I’ll call you if I need anything. In addition ... If there’s nothing particularly important, no one is allowed to enter my courtyard in the afternoon. ”

“Okay, boss!” Wu Qiang bowed and replied.

Wu Qiang kept his mouth shut. He would never ask about things that he should not ask. He would always carry out Xia ruofei’s orders without hesitation.

Xia ruofei brought Song Wei back to the master’s courtyard. They each went back to their rooms to take a shower. Then, the two of them spent the afternoon cultivating in Xia ruofei’s room.

Song Wei had just broken through and her main task now was to consolidate her cultivation.

They didn’t cultivate for a long time. After two days in the time formation, they stopped.

When they left the array, only twenty to thirty minutes had passed in the outside world.

Song Wei strode out and prepared to return to her guest room.

Xia ruofei gently held her hand and said,””Wei Wei, don’t go back ...”

Song Wei’s delicate body trembled slightly. She turned around and saw Xia ruofei’s passionate eyes. She could not help but tremble.

She avoided Xia ruofei’s gaze and lowered her head.”RUO Fei, Qingxue and I have already made a promise ...”

“Qingxue has already accepted it completely.” Xia ruofei said,”and ... She broke your promise first. You knew about it, didn’t you?”

In the morning, when Ling Qingxue sneaked back to her room, Song Wei had already seen it, but she pretended not to know. But how could Xia ruofei not know? His mental power was enough to cover the entire courtyard house.

Song Wei’s eyes became even more flustered. Her breathing became rapid as she said, “She’s different, she’s your girlfriend ...”

“There’s nothing different. ” Xia ruofei said,”Weiwei, since we’re already together, why do you have to suppress your true feelings?”

In fact, when Xia ruofei and Song Wei were cultivating the spirit body, they had already experienced love. This kind of experience was even more intense than the intimate contact in the outside world. It was a feeling that made one’s soul tremble.

However, Xia ruofei still felt that he had to give Song Wei a proper explanation. Otherwise, it would be too unfair to her.

Of course, this was all based on Song Wei’s own willingness to do so. It would be a matter of time. Otherwise, it would be difficult for them to get to that point.

Song Wei’s current situation was obviously not like that. She was just feeling a little depressed because of Ling Qingxue.

After Xia ruofei finished his sentence, he pulled Song Wei into his arms before she could say anything ...
