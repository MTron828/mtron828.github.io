Ruby, who was beside Xia ruofei, was a little anxious when he heard the question.

As the largest sports media in Catalonia, The Sports Daily was undoubtedly Pro – bar?a, and the question raised by Pablo was actually a trap.

He was leading Xia ruofei to say more words about how he admired and praised Messi. As the major shareholder of the Spanish club, Xia ruofei had exchanged jerseys with Messi after the game, but it was Messi who had suggested it first. Moreover, Xia ruofei had performed so well in the game that the Spanish fans would not blame Xia ruofei even if they felt a little uncomfortable.

However, if Xia ruofei continued to praise Messi in the post – Match press conference, coupled with the fact that The Sports Daily would exaggerate the point in its report, it might give the Spanish fans the feeling that the boss was unreliable.

The RCD Espanyol club was originally a small club, and it was located in the city of Barcelona. It was not easy to accumulate some fans. If it caused the fans to be disunited, and even caused some players in the locker room to complain, it would undoubtedly affect the stability of the club.

Ruby was very sure that this reporter from The Sports Daily, Pablo, had ulterior motives and wanted to cause trouble.

If the person sitting next to him was an ordinary player, Ruby could have turned on the microphone before the other party could speak and overstepped his bounds to block the question.

However, Xia ruofei’s identity was special. Ruby was the one who worked for Xia ruofei, so he could not do that.

However, he was also worried that Xia ruofei was too young or did not understand the media’s stance. If he said something wrong, he would be caught by the reporters. So, he was secretly anxious but there was nothing he could do.

After hearing this question, Xia ruofei’s expression remained the same. He smiled and said,””Of course! I have never denied Messi’s excellence! I do admire his skills ...” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Ruby almost wanted to cover his face when he heard this.

Wasn’t this the same as taking the initiative to hand the gun over to the other party?

However, Xia ruofei immediately changed the topic and said,””As everyone knows, in addition to being a registered player of RCD Espanyol, I am also a shareholder of this club. From this point of view, I would very much welcome a good player like Messi to join Espanyol!”

The reporters in the audience and Ruby on the stage all opened their eyes wide. Many people were so surprised that their mouths were wide open, and they didn’t even notice it.

After Pablo’s shock, he couldn’t help but pout.”Messi is not for sale at Barcelona! And even if he were to look for a transfer, he would never go to Espanyol. ”

In other words, the Spanish temple was too small to accommodate a God like Messi.

Xia ruofei smiled faintly.”Nothing is absolute. The so – called ‘not for sale’ is nothing more than the price not high enough.” In addition, what happened to the Spanish clubs? Do you still remember the days of Chelsea and Manchester City in the Premier League many years ago? But now? They were already a Premier League powerhouse! This is the power of capital!”

Manchester City and Chelsea were both veteran teams in the Premier League, but before Abu and the Middle East consortium invested in the two clubs respectively, there was still a gap between them and Giants like Manchester United and Liverpool.

However, after years of continuous investment, the two teams had long been reborn. There were many strong players in the team, and Manchester City was even the champion of the Premier League.

Xia ruofei gave a living example, leaving Pablo speechless.

This was also the effect of Xia ruofei’s special identity. If he was just a player, he would not be able to say those words. Even if he did, he would probably be treated as a joke. However, he was the major shareholder of the club and came from the Far East of China. Now, the wealth of the Chinese was known all over the world. To the rich Chinese, it was really not a big deal to spend money to create a luxurious lineup.

Xia ruofei looked at Pablo and smiled.””I’ll also release a piece of news here: The Spanish clubs will increase their investment in signings at the end of the season, especially if we can make it into the UEFA Europa League qualification tournament, then we will invest a guaranteed 100 million euros in players!”

Now that the winter transfer window was over, the transfer window was closed, so if Espanyol wanted to sign, they had to wait until the end of the season.

The reporters immediately went into an uproar and raised their hands to ask questions. Ruby, who was sitting on the stage, was overjoyed when he heard this. He couldn’t believe his ears.

In recent years, Zhou leiyun’s business thinking had been relatively conservative. His goal was to let the Spanish club survive in La Liga. As long as they could stay in the league, their task would be completed. Like this season, by the end of the season, they still had the hope of entering the UEFA Europa League. That was simply over – fulfilling their task.

As a coach, Ruby naturally needed to introduce more and stronger players to show his ambition. Otherwise, even a clever housewife could not cook without rice. No matter how exquisite his tactical design was and how accurate his observation and analysis of the situation on the field was, the 11 players who were really playing on the field were still the same. Without the support of strong players, Espanyol could naturally play in the lower and lower ranks of the rankings for a long time.

Ruby had lost his passion for work and hoped to find a platform that would allow him to perform better. However, after hearing Xia ruofei’s words, his heart immediately burned with passion.

Although 100 million euros was not enough to buy Messi, it was enough for him to bring in a very strong player in the position of the team’s shortcomings according to his own ideas.

Xia ruofei smiled and made a gesture of pressing his hands down. He said,””I’m just giving a temporary notice about the increase in the signing. If we have any specific actions later, we will inform the media as soon as possible. In addition, Mr. Ruby is the team’s manager. If you have any questions, you can ask him. He has been sitting on the bench for a long time, so I hope that everyone can ask Ruby more questions and let me rest!”

Xia ruofei’s words immediately attracted a burst of laughter. Ruby shrugged his shoulders and spread his hands. He was caught off guard by the boss’s sudden “cheeky”.

Xia ruofei’s attitude towards the media today was relatively friendly and his answers did not disappoint the reporters. It could be said that he had revealed a lot of information.

Therefore, the reporters all accepted Xia ruofei’s suggestion.

The post – Match press conference finally became “normal.” The media reporters also followed the good advice and began to ask Ruby questions.

Ruby was an experienced general, so he could deal with these problems easily. There was no need to worry at all.

After Ruby answered a few questions, the post – Match press conference came to an end.
