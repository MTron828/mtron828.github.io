Chapter 251: Growing tea seems to be good too (1)

Ling Xiaotian’s office. Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue were sitting on the guest sofa while Ling Xiaotian was personally making a kungfu tea for Xia ruofei. The steaming hot water was poured into the teapot, and the fragrance of tea immediately filled the air. Ling Xiaotian washed and brewed the tea with practiced ease. Then, he used a small clip to place the purple sand teacup in front of Xia ruofei. He smiled and said,””Little Xia, try this Tieguanyin. This is a high – Quality tea that a friend of mine gave me. I usually can’t even bear to drink it myself!” “Thank you, uncle Ling!” Xia ruofei said as he bowed slightly. Xia ruofei used two fingers to gently pick up the cup and brought it to his mouth. Immediately, a fragrant smell assailed his nose. The most unique characteristic of tie Guanyin was that the tea was very alluring. Xia ruofei took a small sip and felt that it was very smooth, and the aftertaste was very obvious. Ling Xiaotian had been watching Xia ruofei until he had finished his cup of tea. He then asked,””How do you feel?” “Uncle Ling, I don’t really know much about tea, but your Tie Guan Yin is much better than the ones I’ve had before,” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Ling Xiaotian laughed and said,”this tea of mine is a rare treasure!” My friend has a tea mountain in Anxi, but there’s only one tree with excellent tea leaves. Each year, the tea leaves from that tree would be stir – fried separately. Once they’re done, they would be divided by my friends!” “Uncle Ling, if this tea leaves were to be sold in the market, it would be very expensive, right?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile. “This kind of tea leaves must be at least a few thousand Yuan per 500 grams!” Ling Xiaotian said,”the price of tie Guanyin is still alright. If it’s the top Da Hong Pao, the price would be even more frightening. Furthermore, there is a price but no supply!” Ling Xiaotian continued after taking a sip of tea,””The Da Hong Pao tea leaves sold in the market are of varying quality, and their prices range from 100 to tens of thousands of dollars. However, these can’t be tea leaves from the mother tree. The most authentic Da Hong Pao grew on the high cliff of the Jiulong Ridge of the Wuyi Mountain. The sunlight there was short, and the light was reflected more often. The temperature difference between day and night was great, and the Top of the Rock was soaked in a fine spring all year round. This special natural environment created the unique quality of Da Hong Pao. There are a total of 6 Da Hong Pao parent trees, and the annual output is only about 500 grams. In 2005,20 grams of Da Hong Pao was auctioned for a sky – High price of 208000 Yuan, which is equivalent to more than 10 million Yuan per kilogram. ” Xia ruofei was speechless. Although he was from the southeast province, he did not know much about tea. He knew that good tea leaves were expensive, but he had never thought that there would be such a sky – High price. “Isn’t this a little too exaggerated?” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Ling Xiaotian chuckled and said,”that’s nothing. The problem is that you can’t buy it even if you have the money now. In 2006, the country banned the picking of tea leaves from the mother tree because those six mother trees have been protected as Intangible Cultural Heritage. Some of the exorbitant Da Hong Pao on the market now are produced by second – generation trees, while others are produced by cutting from the mother tree. However, the growing environment is different, and the quality of the tea leaves is also much worse!” “Dad, since you can’t buy it anymore, why are you still talking about it?” Ling Qingxue said with a smile. “Qingxue, it’s okay! I’m very interested in what uncle Ling is saying!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. He was not being polite. In fact, when they were talking about tea leaves, Xia ruofei had an idea to plant tea trees in his Qzone. As long as the trees were good, the unique environment in the Qzone would definitely produce good tea! Hence, Xia ruofei continued to ask,””Uncle Ling, this Da Hong Pao mother tree on Mount Wu Yi is so precious, shouldn’t it be protected very carefully? It would be a huge loss if it was stolen or destroyed. ” “Of course, the Wuyishan City government bought insurance for these parent trees worth 100 million Chinese dollars!” Ling Xiaotian laughed. There are also Special Troops stationed there to protect the mother trees. These are already national treasures, so the possibility of them being stolen is extremely low. ” Xia ruofei nodded. He had been thinking of ways to get the branches of the six mother trees and then cut them in the medium. However, it seemed that the possibility was very low! However, there was still a chance. With Xia ruofei’s current skills, it was possible to sneak into the teahouse without anyone noticing. He could get a few branches. Of course, Xia ruofei did not have such thoughts for the time being. After all, planting tea was not an urgent matter. It was against the law to sneak into the teahouse protected by the garrison. Xia ruofei did not have to risk his life. However, Xia ruofei had already planted a seed in his heart. In the future, when he had the opportunity, he would definitely try to get some of the products of the Xuanji spirit map space from the branches of the Da Hong Pao mother tree. They had to be of high quality or even of the highest quality. Xia ruofei would not bother to plant ordinary tea trees. Xia ruofei did not expect this opportunity to come so quickly, but that was a story for another time. The three of them chatted in the office for a while. Then, the phone on Ling Xiaotian’s desk rang. He stood up and answered the call,”Hello ... I’m ... Oh, hello, hello ... Is that right?” I’m so grateful! Thank you ...” After Ling Xiaotian hung up, he looked at Xia ruofei and said,””Xiao Xia, Deputy Director Shi of the general office of the municipal Party Committee called us personally just now. He’s now in charge of the bidding of the designated reception unit of the municipal Party Committee. He informed us that Lingyun hotel has directly entered the list of final bidders!” “That’s a good thing! Congratulations, uncle Ling, you can finally show off your skills in the hotel industry. ” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Ling Xiaotian sighed,”this time, it’s all thanks to you, little Xia!” Otherwise, not to mention the City Council’s designated reception unit, even our company would be hurt!” “Uncle Ling, since you’ve been shortlisted for the bidding, you should be prepared for the competition!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”as long as Lingyun hotel’s hardware is up to standard and the conditions are better than the other hotels, there will be no other factors that will affect the winning bid!” Today’s incident must have spread to the general office of the municipal Party Committee. As long as the person in charge was not an idiot, he would not dare to do anything illegal in this bidding. “Mm! We’ll definitely make good preparations!” Ling Xiaotian said,”as long as it’s an open and fair competition, our Lingyun hotel still has a high chance of winning! Little Xia, I’m really grateful to you this time!” “Uncle Ling, you’re too kind. We’re all family ...” Xia ruofei smiled. “Yes, yes, yes. We’re on the same side, on the same side ...” Ling Xiaotian said happily. Ling Xiaotian looked at Xia ruofei and then at Ling Qingxue. He was grinning from ear to ear. Previously, Ling Xiaotian still had a trace of suspicion, thinking that Ling Qingxue was using Xia ruofei as a shield. However, after seeing how Xia ruofei treated Ling Qingxue today, he was convinced. Ling Qingxue’s face turned red and she said,””Dad! What are you laughing at?” Ling Xiaotian chuckled and said,”I’m just happy!” My daughter has good taste!” Ling Qingxue quickly looked at Xia ruofei and asked,””Dad, does this mean that ... You agree with me and ruofei?” Ling Xiaotian put on a blank look and said,””Have I ever objected?” “Dad ...” Ling Qingxue said unhappily,”didn’t you say yesterday that you wanted to take the exam ...” “Qingxue, dad must have drunk too much yesterday and was talking nonsense!” Ling Xiaotian quickly interrupted Ling Qingxue and said,”I’ve never forced you to do anything when it comes to your personal feelings ...” At this point, Ling Xiaotian said with slight embarrassment,””However, I’ll give you some suggestions sometimes ... You don’t agree, and I didn’t force you, right?” Ling Qingxue rolled her eyes at her father, then couldn’t help but laugh. “Uncle Ling, thank you!” Xia ruofei smiled. Ling Xiaotian laughed out loud in comfort. Then, he thought of another matter and asked in embarrassment,””Oh right, that ... Little Xia, I heard from Qingxue ... You recently got a pair of high – Quality blood red Dragons?” When Ling Qingxue heard this, she immediately burst out laughing ...
