Song Qiming’s Secretary, Guangzhi Cao, was already waiting at the entrance of the villa area.

The temperature today was higher than the previous days. The scorching sun shone on Guangzhi Cao, and his forehead was covered in sweat. His white shirt was almost soaked, but he was in a good mood.

These few days, he could clearly feel that song Qiming’s attitude towards him had become much closer. This meant that he had gained the trust of the Secretary. As long as he continued to work hard and conscientiously in the future, a great future was waiting for him.

And all of this was closely related to Xia ruofei.

Guangzhi Cao was willing to endure even tougher conditions, let alone welcome Xia ruofei under the scorching sun.

When Xia ruofei reached the entrance, Guangzhi Cao asked the armed police to let them in and got into Xia ruofei’s car.

Xia ruofei said helplessly,”brother Cao, we’re already so familiar with each other. There’s really no need to wait for me under the sun. If you get a heat stroke, I’ll be in big trouble.”

Guangzhi Cao chuckled and said,”don’t we have a miracle doctor like you?” What was a mere heat stroke? Besides, I don’t dare to discount the tasks given by the Secretary. ”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and shook his head, not saying anything.

They arrived at song Qiming’s Villa No. 1. This time, the three of them were waiting at the entrance of the villa.

Fortunately, there weren’t any random people in the villa area of the municipal council Standing Committee. Each villa was quite far away from each other, and there were some landscape trees in the middle to block the view, maintaining a good sense of privacy. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Otherwise, if people were to see that the Deputy Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee and the Secretary of the State Council of Sanshan city was actually standing at the door of his house with his wife and daughter to welcome a young man, who knew how many people would be shocked?

“RUO Fei!”

Song Qiming and Fang Liyun greeted Xia ruofei warmly. Although Song Wei did not say anything, she had a gentle smile on her face. Her beautiful eyes were filled with excitement when she saw Xia ruofei.

“Uncle song, aunt Fang, why are you waiting outside on such a hot day?” Xia ruofei said,”I don’t deserve such a big gift!”

“You’re my daughter’s doctor, what’s there to be ashamed of?”song Qiming laughed. Come, come, come, let’s go inside, it’s too hot here ...”

After the group entered the house, everyone sat down on the sofa in the living room. The housekeeper, Xiao Luo, quickly served everyone a cup of tea.

Song Qiming and Fang Liyun looked at Xia ruofei with anticipation.

“Song Wei hasn’t fainted again, has she?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“No, but it’s only been three days since I fainted. I don’t know if ...” Fang Liyun replied.

“Liyun, since ruofei has already prepared the medicine, there shouldn’t be any problem!” Song Qiming waved his hand.

“I’ll check her pulse again!”Xia ruofei smiled.

“Okay, okay, okay. Wei Wei, quickly go to RUO Fei’s side to check!” Fang Liyun said hurriedly.

Song Wei stood up and sat beside Xia ruofei. She smiled and said,””I’ll have to trouble you ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and placed his fingers on Song Wei’s smooth wrist.

Although Song Wei was already in her fourth year of University, she had never had a boyfriend. Last time, Xia ruofei had taken her pulse and even pinched her cheek to feed her medicine, but she was unconscious and could not feel anything.

This time, she was completely awake. A young man grabbed her wrist, and Song Wei’s face blushed.

She felt that Xia ruofei’s fingers were slightly warm. It was an instinctive comfort to be touched by him, so she could not help but sneak a glance at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei’s eyes were slightly closed and he looked very serious. The sun shone in from the side window. From Song Wei’s angle, she could see the side view of Xia ruofei’s face. It was as if there was a faint Halo on it.

A man was most attractive when he was focused. Song Wei was curious about Xia ruofei, so she could not help but stare at him. She only came back to her senses after a few seconds. Her face was slightly hot and she quickly looked away.

Luckily, everyone else in the living room was looking at Xia ruofei nervously and did not notice Song Wei’s slight loss of composure.

Naturally, Xia ruofei did not notice Song Wei’s expression. He was very focused on feeling Song Wei’s pulse.

Xia ruofei noticed a strange phenomenon. The last time he felt Song Wei’s pulse when she was unconscious, it was normal, but Xia ruofei could feel that it was slightly calmer. However, today, when Song Wei was awake, Xia ruofei felt that her pulse was completely normal. In fact, it could be said that she was very healthy.

After Xia ruofei had given Song Wei the solution of the spirit Heart Flower, she had been unconscious for a shorter period of time. Hence, Xia ruofei knew that the ingredients of the spirit Heart Flower could be used to deal with this strange poison. However, Xia ruofei was more interested in the poison itself, so he hoped to find out more through Chinese medicine.

However, he was destined to be disappointed. With Xia ruofei’s self – taught medical skills, he could not detect what was wrong with Song Wei.

Xia ruofei sighed in his heart. Just as he was about to withdraw his hand, he suddenly had a flash of inspiration. The scene of him using his spiritual power to draw the rune in the air in the spirit map space appeared in his mind.
