Chapter 799: Another Meritorious Service (3)

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”officer Qin, you’re really burning the bridge after crossing it!” I was worried about you just now ...”

“Blackie, come and say hello to this pretty sister!” Xia ruofei added.

At this time, Blackie, who had just finished off Huang Chunhua and ran back to the car, stood up from the front passenger seat and barked at Qin Xiao Yu.

Qin Xiao Yu’s eyes were wide open and her mouth was so wide open that a light bulb could fit in. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

After a long while, the dumbfounded Qin Xiao Yu finally came back to her senses and asked,””This ... This is your dog?”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”of course!” Just now, I saw that the situation was not right, so I sent little black to help you. How was it? Isn’t Blackie much better than the police dogs in your team?”

Qin Xiao Yu’s expression was a little complicated. She looked at black and then at Xia ruofei, and finally said thank you in a low voice.

Officer Qin was a person who could clearly distinguish between kindness and hatred. Although she was not happy with Xia ruofei, Xia ruofei had helped her a lot this time and even saved her life. She still had to be polite.

Xia ruofei chuckled and asked,”what did you say?” I couldn’t hear you clearly!”

Qin Xiao Yu couldn’t help but glare at Xia ruofei again. She felt that this person was really too annoying. She was clearly grateful to him just now, but now she wanted to give him two punches.

Finally, Qin Xiao Yu said loudly: “”I said thank you!”

“Oh ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile,”you’re welcome. We’re cooperating with the police!” I’m a good citizen who abides by the law, and I’m also a private enterprise owner who pays taxes according to the law!”

Qin Xiao Yu couldn’t help but roll her eyes. She had wanted to chide Xia ruofei, but Xia ruofei had just helped her so she held back.

......

“Officer Qin, do you need any help?” Xia ruofei asked again.

Qin Xiao Yu looked at Xia ruofei in confusion and asked,””Help with what?”

Xia ruofei pouted at the unconscious Huang Chunhua and said,””This guy! You can’t possibly carry him back, right?”

“I’ve already called for backup!” Qin Xiao Yu said.

“Alright then!” Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”then I’ll go first. Officer Qin, please wait.”

With that, Xia ruofei shifted the gear and stepped on the gas. The pickup truck started moving slowly.

“Wait a moment!” Qin Xiao Yu called out again.

Xia ruofei stepped on the brakes and asked,””Is there anything else, officer Qin?”

Qin Xiao Yu hesitated for a moment and said: “I ..... I want to trouble you ..... To help me send this suspect to the police station.”

Qin Xiao Yu considered that it would take some time for her colleagues from the city Bureau to come over. She was still a little worried about keeping an eye on Huang Chunhua alone. If anything happened during this time, then the risk would be in vain.

Qin Xiao Yu had seen Xia ruofei’s skills and with Xia ruofei’s help in escorting the suspect, there would definitely be no problem.

The only problem now was that she had rejected Xia ruofei’s offer to help. Now that she had changed her mind, she wondered if this annoying fellow would take the opportunity to laugh at her.

Qin Xiao Yu looked at Xia ruofei after she finished her sentence. To her surprise, Xia ruofei did not say anything, nor did he mock or ridicule her. He only nodded and agreed.

Xia ruofei even got out of the car, picked up the unconscious Huang Chunhua, and threw him into the back seat. He then signaled for Blackie to look after Huang Chunhua.

Xia ruofei then smiled at Qin Xiaoyu and said,””Officer Qin, please get in the car!”

“Thank you!” Qin Xiao Yu said.

This time, his tone was much more sincere than before and not so stiff.

After the two of them got into the car, Xia ruofei started the car again and drove directly in the direction of the city Police station. Qin Xiao Yu also called the city Police station again and told her colleagues who were ready to leave not to come out and to wait for her in the station.

After a while, Xia ruofei arrived at the police station in the pickup truck.

Qin Xiao Yu’s police officers were already waiting in the courtyard and with a single call from her, they immediately came over to escort Huang Chunhua out of the car.

Huang Chunhua had already woken up on the way. However, with little black watching him, he did not dare to act rashly.

Now that they had arrived at the police station, Huang Chunhua was even more disheartened. He did not even have the will to resist.

A police officer walked to the pickup and said to Xia ruofei,””Sir, please come with us to make a statement!”

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”forget about the statement!” It was your colleague who caught the thief. I didn’t do anything. ”

“There’s still a procedure to it! At least you’re a witness!” The police officer said,”you helped us this time, so according to the rules, we can apply for some bonus for you! So, you’d better come with me to make a statement!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”It doesn’t matter if it’s money or not. I’ve already said that I have other things to do. I won’t be taking the statement.”

“You ...” The police officer was a little angry at Xia ruofei’s stubbornness.”Why are you so uncooperative?”

At this time, Qin Xiao Yu who had already gotten off the car said: “”Xiao Zhao, forget it, if he doesn’t want to take his statement, then don ‘t! It’s not like it’s anything important! Let’s interrogate Huang Chunhua, he’s a serial killer!”
