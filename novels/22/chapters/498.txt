Chapter 499: Love me and don’t go (3)

Xia ruofei happily kissed Ling Qingxue’s Jade – like face and said,””That’s a good girl!”

At that moment, Ling Qingxue’s phone rang.

It turned out that when Ling Xiaotian saw that Ling Qingxue wasn’t home even though it was already so late, he couldn’t help but call her worriedly to ask about the situation. This also indirectly explained that although the kidnapping happened near the Ling Ji F & B headquarters, it didn’t alarm anyone. At least, Ling Xiaotian didn’t know about it at all.

Ling Qingxue saw that it was her father’s number. She subconsciously looked at Xia ruofei nervously before picking up.

“Dad,” he said.

“Qingxue, where are you? Why aren’t you home yet?” Ling Xiaotian asked.

Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei, who was holding his breath. She hesitated and said,””Dad, I’m at ruofei’s side! I ... I won’t be going back tonight. It’s getting late, so I’ll stay at the farm ...”

Ling Xiaotian was stunned for a moment before he laughed and said,””Good! It’s not safe to drive so late at night. I’ll be at ease if you stay at ruofei’s place, haha! Qingxue, I won’t say anything more. You should rest early!”

Ling Qingxue’s cheeks were red, and she said in a mosquito – like voice,””Okay, dad, you should sleep early too ...”

After Ling Qingxue hung up the phone, she saw Xia ruofei’s dumbfounded expression. She could not help but roll her eyes at him and said,””What are you looking at?”

Xia ruofei was overjoyed and asked,””Wife, haven’t you always been embarrassed to stay over at my place? Why are you so brave today?”

In the past, Xia ruofei had wanted Ling Qingxue to stay the night several times. However, Ling Qingxue had always insisted on staying at home because she was shy. He did not expect that she would take the initiative to tell her father in front of him that she wanted to stay at the farm. This made Xia ruofei very surprised.

Ling Qingxue pouted and said,””You don’t welcome me? Then I’ll just go back ...”

Xia ruofei quickly grabbed Ling Qingxue’s hand and said,””Don ‘t! I don’t know how happy I am! How could he not welcome her? I can’t wait for you to live on the farm every day!”

However, Xia ruofei also knew that this was not realistic. After all, Ling Qingxue worked in the city. Xia ruofei’s heart would ache if she drove dozens of kilometers back and forth every day!

So Xia ruofei immediately said,”wife, I don’t expect you to come over every day, but since you’ve told dad, can you come over more often to accompany me in the future?” Even two or three days a week would do!”

“That will depend on your performance!” Ling Qingxue chuckled.

Xia ruofei immediately said with confidence,””Don’t worry, I’ll show you now!”

With that, Xia ruofei flipped over and pressed Ling Qingxue under him. His demonic hands reached into her clothes with great familiarity.

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but let out a cry of surprise. Then, she panted and said,””Hey! Bad guy ... I didn’t ask you to perform this ... Oh ...”

Xia ruofei did not even give Ling Qingxue a chance to speak. His two hot Lips quickly sealed Ling Qingxue’s cherry lips.

Ling Qingxue quickly responded to Xia ruofei enthusiastically. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

After surviving a disaster, she needed Xia ruofei’s nourishment more than ever. This was also the reason why she had the courage to tell her father that she was staying over at Xia ruofei’s house.

Xia ruofei’s state was similar to Jian Jia ‘s. It was his first time killing someone after she left the Army. He had run back and forth for dozens of kilometers in the dark, and finally, he had used that incredible method to easily take Liang Haiming’s life. Even though he was used to killing, the blood tonight still made him more excited than before.

Therefore, the two of them quickly engaged in an intense battle on the bed, releasing their passion to their heart’s content. At the same time, they had also unconsciously released some dark and negative emotions.

Upstairs in the small villa, a woman’s moans, a man’s panting, and the creak of the bed that could not bear the weight mixed into a song that made people blush and their hearts beat ...
