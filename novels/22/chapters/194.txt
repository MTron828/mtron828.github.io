“What fish? This is my classmate, Lin Qiao!” Lulu said. “No... The one in front ...” The middle – aged man said. He simply reached out and took Lulu’s phone. “AI! Dad ...” Lulu called out, but the middle – aged man had already reached out and flipped to the front of the photo in his moments, and his eyes almost popped out. “It’s really a Blood Red Dragon ... Perfect hair color ... So long ... And they’re a pair ... Oh my God!” The middle – aged man kept mumbling. His expression changed from disbelief to extreme excitement. Lulu looked at her father and carefully asked,”Dad, are you okay?” The middle – aged man said without raising his head,””I’m fine, I’m fine ... Lulu, can you send me these photos?” “Ah? But she’s my classmate ...” “I didn’t ask for your classmate’s photo, just these few photos of the Blood Red Dragon ...” The middle – aged man said, not knowing whether to laugh or cry. “Oh ... Alright!” Lulu said. She took her phone and saved the photos of the red Arowana sent by Lin Qiao. Then, she sent the photos to her father via WeChat. The middle – aged man took out his phone and looked at it. After confirming that he had received the photo, he thought for a moment and said,””Lulu, and this one ... It’s the front photo of your classmate standing beside the fish tank. Send it to me too!” “Dad, didn’t you say ...” “What are you thinking?” The middle – aged man said,”I’m just using this photo to compare and calculate the size of the fish tank. That way, I can roughly calculate the length of the blood red Dragons ... Hey! You don’t understand, just send me the photo ... You don’t really think that dad has feelings for this little girl, do you?” “That’s not it ...” Lulu smiled, a little embarrassed. “Then isn’t it settled?” The middle – aged man said,”hurry up and release it!” Lulu smiled wryly. She didn’t know what to do with her father who was obsessed with fish. She could only download the photo of Lin Qiao from the best angle and send it to her father on WeChat.

This pair of blood red Dragons is at least 80 centimeters, no, no, no ... I’m afraid it’s more than that ...” The middle – aged man went back to the study without looking up while looking at his phone. He didn’t care about his daughter playing with her phone. He was so focused that he almost hit the door frame of the study. Lulu saw this scene and shook her head, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.
