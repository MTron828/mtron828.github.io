Chapter 694: Chapter 483 – final decision (1)

Xue Jinshan was leading a few new people in the Research Institute to research some matters regarding the preliminary review of the heart – nourishing soup.

The approval of new drugs involved many aspects. Now that Xue Jinshan was in charge of this matter, he was under a lot of pressure. Every day, he would bring a few undergraduate students to meet and research.

When he heard that Xia ruofei had returned, Xue Jinshan immediately put down what he was doing and ran to the meeting room with his laptop.

“President Xia!” Xue Jinshan said happily as soon as he came in,”the preliminary examination is going very smoothly. The provincial Drug Administration has given us unconditional support!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Jinshan, sit down and talk.” Director Feng has already told me about the situation. Everyone has worked hard during this period!”

“It’s not hard, not hard at all. “Xue Jinshan chuckled. Everyone’s full of energy working for chief Xia!”

It was not an exaggeration to say that besides Xia ruofei, Xue Jinshan was the person who knew the heart – nourishing soup the best. He was very clear that once this new medicine hit the market, it would definitely become a global topic.

When he thought about how he was about to create history, Xue Jinshan was filled with enthusiasm.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”we’ll talk about the new drug approval later. I called you here today to discuss the acquisition of the pharmaceutical factory.” As you know, the approval process for the new drug is going quite smoothly, and the progress is far beyond our expectations. It’s urgent to acquire the pharmaceutical factory for mass – Production testing!”

“Yes! President Xia, a lot of work is going to stop in the preliminary stage because our production site is not in place yet. ” Xue Jinshan said, feeling the same.

At this moment, Feng Jing walked into the meeting room with a few stacks of documents.””Chairman, after our preliminary investigation, we’ve selected two pharmaceutical factories as potential acquisition targets. The specific information is here, you can take a look first.”

After that, Feng Jing gestured to her assistant, Liu Qian, to distribute the information to Xia ruofei and Xue Jinshan.

Just as Xia ruofei and Xue Jinshan were going through the information, Feng Jing introduced,””These two factories produce Eastern medicine. One is Min Jiang pharmaceuticals from San Shan, and the other is Nanyue pharmaceuticals in Song Ping.”

......

Xia ruofei casually flipped through it and raised his head to smile.””Since these two companies have caught your eye, they must have their own advantages. President Feng, please introduce their advantages and disadvantages!”

Feng Jing nodded.”Firstly, they’re both Chinese medicine companies. We can use their production lines directly. Furthermore, both companies have the intention to sell their products due to poor management.”

Feng Rao took a sip of water and continued,””Let me first talk about Min Jiang pharmaceuticals! “The advantage is that it’s located in Sanshan city, and our company has centralized management. In addition, we’ve inspected this pharmaceutical company. The production line was updated the year before last, and it’s at least 90% new.”Nanyue pharmaceuticals, on the other hand, is a little bigger than Min Jiang pharmaceuticals. They have three sterile production workshops, while Min Jiang pharmaceuticals only has two. Furthermore, Nanyue pharmaceuticals has the production approval for many types of Chinese medicine, which is also where Min Jiang pharmaceuticals is weaker than them.”

“Have they made an offer?” Xia ruofei nodded.

“That’s what I was about to say,”Feng Rao said.” The two companies “offers are about the same, around 25 million. I’ve looked at the market, and the transfer price of such a small pharmaceutical factory is about this level. They didn’t ask for too much. ”

After saying that, Feng Rao suddenly changed the topic and said,”However, at the same price, Nanyue pharmaceuticals clearly has an advantage. Not only is their factory larger than Min Jiang pharmaceuticals, but they also have five more production permits than Min Jiang pharmaceuticals. Just these permits alone are worth a lot of money. If it wasn’t for the geographical location, I would definitely be inclined towards the South eclipse Kingdom. ” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei smiled but didn’t express his opinion immediately. Instead, he looked at Xue Jinshan and asked,””Jinshan, what do you think?”

Xue Jinshan muttered to himself for a moment before flipping through the information in his hands. He cautiously said,”President Xia, I personally think ... We can put aside the production approval for now. Even if we acquire the pharmaceutical factory, it’s unlikely that we can continue to produce the drugs that they have produced before. The heart – nourishing soup project will be able to top the other ten projects.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”CEO Feng, I agree with Jinshan.” After we acquire the pharmaceutical factory, we’ll only be producing heart – nourishing soup in the short term. The production approval for other Chinese medicine wouldn’t be of much use to us. ”

“If we remove the approval, then Min Jiang pharmaceuticals and Nan Yue pharmaceuticals are basically on par,” Feng Jing nodded. Nanyue pharmaceuticals might be a little bigger, but Min Jiang pharmaceuticals ‘production line has been updated, and the land price in San Shan city can’t be compared to that in Song Ping city. ”

Xia ruofei was silent for a long time. He carefully compared the two documents in his hands and finally raised his head.”CEO Feng, from a company management perspective, Min Jiang pharmaceuticals is clearly more suitable. Moreover, their 90% new production line is more attractive to me than Nanyue pharmaceuticals, who has an additional sterile workshop. My personal opinion is leaning towards Min Jiang pharmaceuticals.”

“Alright, then we’ll focus on negotiating with Min Jiang pharmaceuticals!” Feng Jing nodded.

Xia ruofei agreed,”don’t cut off contact with Nanyue pharmaceuticals immediately. Let’s use it as an alternative!” Also, don’t let Min Jiang pharmaceuticals find out that we’re in a hurry to acquire a pharmaceutical factory. I don’t think I need to teach you the negotiation skills. ”
