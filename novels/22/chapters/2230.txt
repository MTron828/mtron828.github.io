2231 A happy gathering (1)

Coincidentally, when Xia ruofei and the others arrived at the backyard, Wu Qiang had also driven Qin Yanan and he Yu back to the siheyuan.

Xia ruofei smiled and called Qin Yanan over, then introduced her to Zhao Yongjun and the others.””This is our company’s manager Qin. He’s currently the head of my assistant team.”

Then he introduced Zhao Yongjun and the others to Qin Yanan one by one. Of course, he didn’t tell them who they were and only said that they were his good friends.

Qin Yanan graciously nodded at Zhao Yongjun and the others.

Then, the group walked to the dining room.

Song Rui poked Xia ruofei’s waist. Xia ruofei slowed down and asked in a low voice,””What’s wrong?”

Song Rui pointed at Qin Yanan and said in a low voice,””Aren’t you afraid that your little girlfriend will be jealous if you keep a beautiful assistant by your side?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh,”what the hell is this?” Yanan is my Work Assistant! Also ... Which little girlfriend are you talking about?”

Song Rui was suddenly angry and said,””You can’t beat people down like this! It’s a good thing I already have Yiyi now, or else I’d be angered to death by you. ”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”let’s go!” Let’s go eat!”

The two of them walked into the dining room, and Zhuo Yiyi asked with a smile,””Song Rui, what are you and ruofei whispering about?”

Song Rui was stunned. Xia ruofei immediately smiled and said,””Xiao Rui was showing off to me ... Saying that he’s going to show off his affection to us tonight!”

Zhuo Yiyi’s pretty face instantly turned red. She glared at song Rui and said,””You only know how to talk nonsense!”

“I didn’t ...” Song Rui explained helplessly.

However, Zhuo Yiyi obviously believed Xia ruofei’s words more. She glanced at him unhappily, then walked over to sit between Qin Yanan and he Yu.

Song Rui couldn’t help but be startled. His girlfriend wasn’t sitting with him? What the hell is this! He couldn’t help but glare at Xia ruofei, who was smiling evilly.

Fortunately, he Yu was more observant and took the initiative to give her seat to song Rui.

Zhuo Yiyi naturally wouldn’t change seats. A couple could throw a tantrum to please them, but it was also not too much. Otherwise, it would be considered unreasonable. After all, she knew that it was just a joke.

After everyone had taken their seats, Wu Xiujuan and Xia Xiaolan began to serve the dishes.

Wu Qiang and the others went to the staff cafeteria to eat. Xia ruofei saw that there were many people today and it would be crowded if he called them over. They would also feel uncomfortable, so he acquiesced.

Zhao Yongjun arranged for everyone to pour wine. The men all drank white wine, while the three women drank expensive rotten wine.

Zhao Yongjun smiled and said,”ruofei, say a few words!” You’re the master today!”

Xia ruofei stood up with a glass of wine in his hand and said with a smile,””There’s nothing much to say. We’re all good friends, and we haven’t gathered together in a long time. Yanan and he Yu, you’ve worked hard, so I’ll just say one thing! Everyone, have a good meal tonight! There will be enough food and wine! Come on! Let’s have a drink together!”

“Alright! Cheers!”

“Cheers!”

The white wine was held in a small glass, so Xia ruofei and the rest naturally toasted to it. Qin Yanan, Zhuo Yiyi, and he Yu also took a big gulp.

“Satisfying!” Xia ruofei showed the bottom of his cup and said,”come, come, come, let’s eat! Everyone, try Auntie Wu’s cooking!”

Everyone drank and ate while chatting, and the atmosphere at the table quickly became lively.

Zhao Yongjun sighed,”ruofei, your wine is still the most authentic!” And this dish today! Are you using the ingredients from your paradise Corporation?” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”most of them are!” But I also bought it at Walmart! Now that our company’s production capacity is gradually increasing, the major superpowers still have sufficient stock, so they can basically buy everything!”

“That’s because your vegetables are too expensive!” Song Rui said,”it’s at least a few times or even more than ten times that of ordinary vegetables. Most people’s families wouldn’t be willing to buy it to eat easily!”

“You get what you pay for, you know!” Xia ruofei chuckled.”The quality of our products is there for all to see!”

Xu Zi Xuan smiled and said,”there’s nothing wrong with RUO Fei’s words!” The ingredients of paradise Corporation, whether it’s appearance or taste, are indeed much better than ordinary vegetables. They’re not even on the same level!”

“Did you see? It’s still Zi Xuan who has good eyes!” Xia ruofei said proudly.

Zhao Yongjun smiled.”It’s really a pleasure every time I come to eat at your house. But there’s one bad thing about it!”

“What’s wrong?” Xia ruofei asked curiously.

“What else? We’ve been raised to be picky with our mouths!” Zhao Yongjun smiled and said,”every time I come back from your place, I feel like I’ve been eating for a few days! Wine is even more so, any kind of wine would feel as bland as water in the mouth!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”Brother Zhao, you can’t praise people like this! I’ll be proud!”

Qin Yanan saw that Xia ruofei was chatting happily with Zhao Yongjun and the others. He wanted to give a simple report on work, but didn’t want to disturb them.

On the other hand, Xia ruofei was worried that he was giving the two of them the cold shoulder. After all, it was their first day meeting Zhao Yongjun and the others, so it was inevitable that they would feel reserved. Hence, Xia ruofei took the initiative to raise his glass to Qin Yanan and said,””Yanan! You’ve all worked hard today! Let’s have a drink!”
