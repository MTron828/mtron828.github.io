Xia ruofei did a comprehensive analysis of the five combinations under the premise of placing the eleven star Fern thorn soul essences. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He would sometimes frown, sometimes smile, and sometimes even look confused.

When the countdown in the perceptual mirror reached the last five minutes, Xia ruofei finally got what he thought was the best answer.

There was not enough time for him to do any more tests. Xia ruofei had already gone through these plans in his head.

Therefore, he didn’t do any more unnecessary calculations or practice. He directly jumped up and jumped on the flying sword of the qushuang floating to the side.

When Ling Qingxue saw this, she was overjoyed. She couldn’t help but ask,” “RUO Fei, you already have the answer, right?”

Xia ruofei turned around and smiled at Ling Qingxue.” “Yes, it should be a better solution. Don’t worry!”

With that, Xia ruofei formed a Sword Art. The qushuang flying sword immediately drew an arc and flew towards a stone pillar in the distance.

Without hesitation, Xia ruofei took out a star Fern thorn soul essence and inserted it into a groove on the side of the stone pillar.

At this moment, Xia ruofei did not know that in a hidden space enshrouded in purple Qi, an elder in a green Daoist robe was watching his every move with interest through a mirror. When he embedded the first Star Fern thorn into the groove of the stone pillar, the eyes of the elder in the green Daoist robe lit up slightly and his face revealed a trace of approval.

Without any hesitation, Xia ruofei controlled the qushuang flying sword and flew towards another stone pillar at the other end of the formation. Then, without any hesitation, he embedded a star Fern thorn soul essence into the groove at the top of the stone pillar and flew to the next stone pillar.

The third one.

The fourth one.

The fifth one.

Xia ruofei was certain of his answer. Without any hesitation, he quickly inserted the star Fern thorn soul essence into a groove on one of the stone pillars.

Very quickly, he had installed all ten star Fern thorn soul essences.

Whether it was the green – robed elder in the hidden space or Ling Qingxue who was outside the stone pillar array, they all thought that Xia ruofei had completed all his actions.

Unexpectedly, Xia ruofei took out the last star Fern thorn soul essence from his pocket. It was the one he had obtained by accident on his way here. Then, he rode the qushuang flying sword and flew towards the last stone pillar. His target was still very clear as he went straight for it.

The green – robed elder saw that Xia ruofei was still holding a star Fern thorn soul essence in his hand and was running towards his last target without hesitation. He could not help but sit up straight and his eyes revealed a trace of anticipation.

When Xia ruofei accurately found the last stone pillar and inserted the star Fern soul essence into the groove on the side of the stone pillar, the elder in the green Taoist robe could not suppress his joy and even laughed out loud.”Hahaha! Wonderful! Excellent!”

Xia ruofei’s expression was calm. After inserting the last star Fern thorn soul essence, he left the stone pillar array on his flying sword and returned to Ling Qingxue’s side.

Then, he casually made a hand seal and waved it out.

After this magic art entered the stone pillar in the center of the stone pillar array, the entire array suddenly lit up. Streams of light flowed through the incomparably complicated array patterns. The surrounding spiritual energy seemed to be stirred by a large hand, spinning rapidly with the operation of the array.

“This…” The green – robed elder was shocked.”This kid’s comprehension of array Dao is so high that it’s simply shocking… He can already activate this earth – Level array with his early – Stage golden core cultivation…”

Ling Qingxue held Xia ruofei’s arm tightly and asked,””RUO Fei, you … Have you succeeded?”

Xia ruofei did not look at Ling Qingxue. He was staring at the beams of light in the formation and felt the pulse of the formation. Without turning his head, he said,”Qingxue, this formation is extremely profound. Even though I’ve tried my best, I’ve only managed to get a glimpse of it. Therefore, I don’t know if I’m qualified according to the evaluation standards of that senior Almighty…”

“You’ll definitely pass!” Ling Qingxue said,”with your array skills, if you can’t pass this mission, then I think no one can!”

In Ling Qingxue’s eyes, Xia ruofei would always be the best, so it was not surprising that she would say this.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””This is called” in the eyes of the beholder, the West lies… In the eyes of the beholder! It’s not an objective and rational evaluation. Whether or not we can pass this mission’s test will still depend on the evaluation standards of the senior Almighty.”

“Anyway, 1 think you’re the best!” Ling Qingxue chuckled.

At this moment, the light in the stone pillar array gradually weakened. Soon, the last ray of light was in the process of moving and slowly disappeared from Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue’s sight.

Ling Qingxue looked at the silent stone pillar array and couldn’t help but ask,””RUO Fei, why did the formation stop?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ve said it before. I’ve only grasped the surface of this formation. I’ve already exceeded my level by forcefully activating the formation. I can’t stabilize the formation at the moment.” Moreover, this obviously requires a large amount of star Fern thorn soul essence. I’ve already given away all my stock!”

“Mm! 1 believe you!” Ling Qingxue said,”who cares if the array has stopped or not. We just have to wait for the results!”

After Xia ruofei heard Ling Qingxue’s words, he couldn’t help but smile and held her soft hands.

The two of them interlocked their fingers and looked at the stone pillar array that had already returned to silence.

At this moment, a ray of light lit up in the middle of the stone pillar array and began to flow along the periphery of the stone pillar array.

Then, the second, the third…

After a while, the stone pillar array’s outermost ring was already surrounded by this light.

The light was flowing rapidly, and its color was slowly darkening. Finally, it turned purple, completely enveloping the stone pillar array.

Xia ruofei was dumbfounded as he looked at the stone pillar array in the purple light.

Ling Qingxue, who didn’t know what was going on, smiled and said,” “RUO Fei, so you had a backup plan. 1 really thought that the formation had stopped! You don’t say, this purple flowing light is quite good – looking!”

“This… This isn’t me…” Xia ruofei said, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.

“Who else could it be if not you? I?” Ling Qingxue laughed and said,”there’s no one else on the fifth level of the trial Pagoda. Other than you, it’s me.” But I’m very sure that I didn’t even move just now, so isn’t the answer clear?”

“It could also be that the array is working on its own …” Xia ruofei said weakly.

However, Ling Qingxue obviously did not believe this explanation and still thought that Xia ruofei was joking with her. So, after hearing Xia ruofei’s words, she could not help but laugh and said,””Please, the next time you lie, can you please come up with a more reliable reason?”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and decided not to explain further.

The purple light quickly revolved around the stone pillar array for a while, and then its color began to slowly darken, and finally disappeared completely.

The moment the purple light disappeared, a new message appeared in the mission bar in Xia ruofei’s perceptual mirror. The trial Pagoda’s fifth level chain mission, third round, after evaluation, your combination has reached the perfect level (purple level). Congratulations, you have successfully completed the trial Pagoda’s fifth level mission.

Xia ruofei’s heart was finally at ease. Even though he had deduced it countless times, he still could not be absolutely sure that his judgment was correct.

Now that he saw the mission prompt, Xia ruofei knew that the combination he had chosen had passed the test. At the same time, he could vaguely guess what the purple light that appeared at the end was. It turned out that this was used to assess the completion of a mission. It was estimated that the color of the light would be different according to the completion rate..
