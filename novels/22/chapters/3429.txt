Chapter 3430: The line between life and death (2)

Translator: 549690339

Ling Qingxue suddenly heard Xia ruofei’s voice and quickly said,””Oh, really? That’s great! Quickly let me out!”

Although Ling Qingxue had spoken directly, Xia ruofei could easily grasp everything that was happening in the spirit map space. Hence, he could naturally hear Ling Qingxue’s voice.

Xia ruofei said,”you should rest for a while.” I feel that there might be more danger…”

At Xia ruofei’s level of cultivation, he was very sensitive to danger.

Although he had easily killed the intermediate – Level Mirage beast, he could not shake off the warning in his heart. It was clear that there was greater danger waiting for him, so he simply let Ling Qingxue stay in the spirit map space for a while longer. This way, he could face the next challenge without any worries.

“Alright then! You must pay attention to your own safety!” Ling Qingxue said,”if there’s anything, tell me immediately! I don’t know anything while I’m here. I’m so worried about you!”

Since Ling Qingxue knew that Xia ruofei could talk to her directly, she definitely wanted to know what was going on outside in real time. Of course, this was under the premise that it would not affect Xia ruofei.

“Don’t worry! Even if I can’t defeat them, I still have ways to save my life!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I can protect you so well. Are you afraid that I don’t have ways to protect myself? Don’t worry, just wait for my good news!”

With that, Xia ruofei carefully stepped forward and approached the small forest.

His mental power had already spread out to a range of at least two kilometers. Of course, the front and back halls had their mental power shielded, but it could basically cover the entire garden.

However, he did not find anything out of the ordinary with his spiritual power.

Xia ruofei took a step forward and suddenly felt a strong sense of danger.

He made a prompt decision and directly tiptoed to jump back. While he was still in the air, the qushuang flying sword had already automatically flown over. His toes stepped on the qushuang flying sword and his speed suddenly increased, retreating in the direction of the trap and kill array.

At the same time, Xia ruofei had already formed a seal and activated the trap and kill array.

Xia ruofei was very sensitive to danger. While he was still in mid – Air, a terrifying illusion had already descended.

Xia ruofei clearly knew that he had encountered a powerful Mirage beast, probably a high – Level one. However, when the illusion descended, he could not help but fall into it and completely forgot everything.

He was travelling on a spaceship. Outside was the Dark Universe, behind him was the blue Earth, and in front of him was the moon that had been magnified many times.

Xia ruofei thought that he was still on his way to the moon.

At this moment, the spaceship suddenly exploded, and everyone was exposed to the vacuum without any warning.

The refinement stage cultivators on the spacecraft were completely unable to resist. In an instant, due to the huge pressure difference between their bodies and the vacuum, their internal organs exploded. The blood that they spat out strangely formed red balls of different sizes, which moved in all directions.

The Aurous core stage cultivators had strong bodies. Although they were also injured, they were able to withstand it.

Xia ruofei looked at Ling Qingxue, who had turned into a horrible corpse and was rapidly drying up in the vacuum. He couldn’t help but feel agitated and his eyes almost popped out of their sockets.

Originally, his mind still had a trace of clarity, but at this moment, his mind was in a violent shock, and he was completely immersed in the illusion.

Xia ruofei opened his mouth and let out a shrill roar. However, because of the vacuum, no sound could be heard.

His body floated in mid – Air as he watched Chen Xuan and the other Aurous core stage cultivators retrieve their spacesuits in despair.

After a long while, the pressure in his body increased due to the difference in internal and external pressure. He could have endured for a long time even without air, but under such circumstances, he actually began to feel a little suffocated.

Xia ruofei finally looked at Ling Qingxue and prepared to take out the spacesuit from the spirit map space.

However, he was shocked to find that he had lost contact with the spirit map space.

He could no longer sense the existence of the spirit map space.

Xia ruofei’s expression changed.

In this vast space, he was directly exposed to a vacuum environment. Without an EVA suit, he wouldn’t be able to last long.

He looked at Chen Xuan and the others for help as he gestured non – stop.

However, Chen Xuan and the others turned a blind eye to it. Putting on their spacesuits, they waved their palms backward and released their Yuan Qi. Using the reaction force, they flew back to the Flying Ship.

The black Phoenix flying ship clearly belonged to Xia ruofei, but he had lost control of it.

On the other hand, the moment Chen Xuan and the rest boarded the black Phoenix flying ship, they immediately took control of the ship. After cutting off the rope, the Flying Ship accelerated towards the moon. From the beginning to the end, they did not even look at Xia ruofei, as if he did not even exist.

Xia ruofei suddenly felt the shadow of death looming over his head. He felt an unprecedented sense of despair.

He felt more and more suffocated. His lungs felt like they were about to explode, and his rushing blood vessels and internal organs were constantly erupting outwards. If it wasn’t for the strong suppression of the vital Qi, he would have exploded and died like those Qi refining cultivators.

Xia ruofei’s consciousness was getting blurry.

In fact, the whole process was very short, probably only one or two minutes.

But for Xia ruofei, it felt like a century had passed.

He could feel the power in his body draining away, and everything in front of him began to blur. His body seemed to be getting lighter and lighter …

Just as his consciousness was about to fall into absolute silence, the purple – Gold golden core in his body suddenly began to operate on its own. A large amount of primordial Qi flowed in his meridians, and a lightning seemed to have flashed across his sea of consciousness, jolting him awake.

Golden core? How could I have a complete golden core in my body? This was Xia ruofei’s first thought.

He had been completely trapped in the illusion just now and had no idea that he was already a cultivator in the middle stage of the Golden core realm. He thought that his cultivation was still in the early stage of the Golden core realm when he rushed from earth to the moon.

Then, all sorts of illogical scenarios appeared in his mind.

This included the fact that Chen Xuan and the others were ignoring him, and that he was unable to contact the spirit map space.

At that moment, Xia ruofei suddenly realized that something was not right.

In fact, his mind was only clear for a moment. If he didn’t respond in time, he would soon fall into the illusion again. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Fortunately, Xia ruofei’s reaction was very fast. He didn’t have time to think too much. The moment his mind cleared up, he could sense the existence of the spirit map scroll and his consciousness was connected to the spirit map space.

However, Xia ruofei did not stupidly take out the spacesuit from the spirit map space. Instead, he directly moved himself into the spirit map space.

The moment he entered the spirit map’s space, all the negative effects that the terrifying illusion had on Xia ruofei disappeared. He immediately escaped from the illusion.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but shout and then started to take in big breaths.

Although everything was fake, as long as one was immersed in the illusion, everything was real.

If the cultivator was injured or even killed in the illusionary realm, he would really die.

Therefore, the suffocating feeling in the vacuum was real. Xia ruofei felt that he was extremely lacking in oxygen. He only felt better after taking a few deep breaths of the air that was filled with spiritual Qi.

Xia ruofei immediately checked his body and realized that his organs and meridians had been damaged to varying degrees.

The damage caused by the pressure difference between the inside and outside of the body when he was directly exposed to a vacuum was the real effect on his body.

At this moment, Xia ruofei had completely recalled everything that had happened just now. He couldn’t help but reveal a look of fear..
