Chapter 1011: A new olive branch (1)

Translator: 549690339

Song Rui’s face was a little red, which was a rare sight. He was at a loss as Zhuo Yiyi hugged him tightly. He didn’t dare to put his hands on Zhuo Yiyi’s body, and he kept saying,””Calm down ... Calm down ...”

Xia ruofei and Song Wei laughed as they watched the show.

Song Wei felt that her best friend was about to fall into a trap. However, she was also hesitating whether she should remind Zhuo Yiyi in private. After all, song Rui did not use any dirty tricks. He was pursuing her seriously, and she did not seem to have any reason to stop him.

Moreover, song Rui was his elder!

Of course, Song Wei also knew that even if Zhuo Yiyi and song Rui were together, the road ahead would still be very bumpy and full of obstacles.

Therefore, Song Wei was in a dilemma.

Of course, she didn’t want to think too much about it for now. Seeing how happy Zhuo Yiyi was, Song Wei was happy for her from the bottom of her heart. Moreover, from now on, the two of them would be staying in Beijing. Song Wei was going to continue her postgraduate studies, while Zhuo Yiyi would be working at the Yanjing Museum. This was something to be happy about.

Zhuo Yiyi also realized that her actions were a little inappropriate, so she quickly let go of song Rui with a blushing face.

However, she quickly asked curiously,””Uncle, what does your friend do? Isn’t this a little too powerful!”

“He has some connections in the cultural system,” song Rui said with a faint smile. I say, student Zhuo Yiyi, it seems like it’s time for you to go through the security check. It’s almost time to board ...”

Zhuo Yiyi waved her hand and said,”why are we boarding?!” I’m going straight to Beijing. Officer Hu just said on the phone that I’ll report to work tomorrow!”

As such, Xia ruofei and the other two did not know whether to laugh or cry as they accompanied Zhuo Yiyi to the check – in counter to return their boarding pass. They returned their ticket status to “open”, then went through the ticket change procedures and chose the same airline as them for the nearest flight to the capital city.

As the flight that Zhuo Yiyi had booked was about to take off, changing their flight ticket at this time would definitely cost them some money. However, Zhuo Yiyi was still immersed in the great joy of recovering what she had lost, so why would she care about such a small loss?

Her luck was good. There were still empty seats on a flight that took off in an hour, so she successfully signed in for this flight.

After exchanging for the boarding pass for the new flight, Zhuo Yiyi directly passed through the security check and went to the waiting room to wait.

Xia ruofei and the other two stood behind the yellow cordon and watched as Zhuo Yiyi passed through the security check. She waved at them and walked towards the departure hall.

Song Rui was still looking at Zhuo Yiyi’s back, lost in thought. Xia ruofei chuckled and said,””Young master Song, you still can’t bear to leave? Do you want to book a plane ticket and chase after them?”

Song Rui dodged his eyes and pretended to be disdainful.””I don’t even know what you’re talking about!”

Xia ruofei and Song Wei both laughed without saying a word. Song Rui felt even more embarrassed and said loudly,””Hey, what’s with your expressions?”

“It’s fine, haha ...” Xia ruofei said,”let’s go!” I’ll send you back to the city!”

Just as the three of them walked out of the departure hall of the airport, Xia ruofei’s mobile phone vibrated in his pocket. He took it out and saw that it was Mr. Tang He. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Hence, Xia ruofei gestured to Song Wei and song Rui and answered the call at the same time.

“Hello, old Mr. Tang!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Tang He laughed heartily and said,”are you busy, ruofei?” I’ve already reached the three mountains!”

Xia ruofei was stunned. He was very surprised. He asked,””You ... Didn’t you say you’d come tomorrow? Did I remember the time wrong?”

“I’ve finished my business in Hong Kong in advance. “Tang He laughed out loud. I didn’t say anything before coming, you were a little caught off guard ...”

Xia ruofei smiled.”That’s not the case. I’m just a little surprised. By the way, Mr. Tang, which hotel are you staying at?” I’m here to pay you a visit. ”

“I just got off the plane!” Tang He said with a smile.

“Oh, really? What a coincidence!” Xia ruofei could not help but widen his eyes.”I’m at the airport too!”

“Oh? It seems that we are really fated to meet!” Tang He could not help but laugh.

“Where are you now, Mr. Tang?” Xia ruofei asked.

“I took a private jet here ...”

“I understand, I’ll be right there!” Xia ruofei said.

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei said to Song Wei and song Rui apologetically,””A business partner is here, I’m sorry!”

“It’s okay, we’ll just take a taxi back to the city,”Song Wei replied immediately.

Xia ruofei quickly said,”there’s no need for that. He just got off the plane. I’m going to meet him. We’ll talk about the details back in the city. You can just take my car. Just wait for me for a while.”

“We’re really fine. We can take a taxi back. ” Song Wei thought that Xia ruofei said that because he felt that it would not be good to leave them behind.

“Song Wei,” song Rui pouted,”there’s no need to be so polite with this guy. Let’s go. Get in the car!”

Xia ruofei laughed.”Did you see that? young master Song is getting more and more domineering. Song Wei, you should learn from him.”

“I’m not learning!”Song Wei said.

The three of them chatted and laughed as they got into the car in the parking lot. Xia ruofei drove the Knight XV to the entrance of a building next to the terminal.
