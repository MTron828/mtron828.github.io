Chapter 271: Song Zhengping’s request (1)

Xia ruofei was stunned when he saw the message. He really didn’t know that Wu Liqian was not married. He noticed that Wu Liqian used the word “not married” instead of “no husband.” Not married meant that she was not married, and if she did not have a husband, she might have a history of marriage. It was possible that she was divorced or had lost her husband. Wu Liqian should be at least 30 years old, and she was a leader with real power. In general, it was rare for a female cadre of this age to be unmarried, because it was likely to be regarded as an anomaly, and even affect the growth and progress of their career. Besides, Wu Liqian was definitely a beautiful woman. She was well – to – do in all aspects, so Xia ruofei had always thought that Wu Liqian had a family and even a child. He sent a series of ‘fainted’ emojis over. Then, he directly sent a voice message,”sis Wu, you’re not joking with me, are you? Are you really not married yet?” Xia ruofei let go and sent the voice message. “It’s true,” Wu Liqian replied with three words. Xia ruofei quickly typed on his phone: “No way? Why? Is it because you’re too busy with work and don’t have time to find one?” “You haven’t met a suitable one, have you? Xiao Xia, I’m going to have a meeting soon, let’s talk when we’re free ...” Obviously, Wu Liqian didn’t want to talk too much about this topic. Xia ruofei responded with a smiley face. The incident with Wu Liqian was just a small interlude, and Xia ruofei put it aside very quickly. He turned on his computer and withdrew the sales funds from Taoyuan roaty into his bank card, and another 200000 Yuan was deposited. Then, he browsed the news online for a while. It was almost lunchtime. Xia ruofei didn’t sleep well last night, so he went back to his room to catch up on some sleep after dinner. Just as he laid down, his phone rang. Xia ruofei reached for the phone on the bedside table. He picked it up immediately when he saw that it was a call from song Zhengping, elder song’s eldest son and the Chief Judge of xiangnan province. “Hello, Chief Judge song!” “Little Xia, I didn’t disturb your rest, did I?” Song Zhengping asked very kindly. “Oh, no, no,” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”what’s the matter, Chief Judge song?” “Xiao Xia, I really do have a matter that I need to trouble you with.” Song Zhengping said,”the old man’s body has been recovering well recently. He’s a little restless, and he wants to go out for a walk in a few days.” “Oh? It’s good to go out for a walk. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”chief, you are in good health now. Proper traveling and exercise will be good for your recovery.” “Since you’ve said so, I’m relieved.” Song Zhengping smiled and said,”but I’ll have to trouble you with this!” “My father doesn’t want to alert the local comrades, and he doesn’t like to be surrounded by people, so he’s preparing to travel in plain clothes. Can you spare a few days to accompany him? With you by the old man’s side, if there’s any health problem, you can also deal with it in time. ” Xia ruofei pondered for a while and asked,”Chief Judge song, when will the Bureau chief be leaving?” How long have you been out for?” “We’ll leave in a week!” Song Zhengping said,”he wants to go to Mount Wu Yi to visit a few old friends and have some fun. It shouldn’t take too long. He’ll be back in three or four days at most.” Xia ruofei did some calculations. It should not be a conflict with Liang Qichao’s matter. By the time Liang Qichao’s United States cousin returned to the country, he should have already returned to the three mountains. He would not delay the sale of the aureum ore. Hence, Xia ruofei said,”no problem, Chief Judge song!” I’ll go with the chief!” “That’s great!”Song Zhengping was overjoyed. Little Xia, thank you!” “You’re too polite. ” Xia ruofei said in a neutral tone. He didn’t have the intention of relying on the song family for his own benefit, so when he was with song Zhengping and elder song, he was always calm and peaceful. He wasn’t as respectful as most people were when they were with the song family. “Oh right, Xiao Xia,” song Zhengping continued.”The old man won’t be bringing many people with him. So, other than medical care, I’d like to ask you to help me with some security matters.” When Xia ruofei was fighting a group of Scouts, song Zhengping also lived in a small courtyard in the mountains in Hongzhou, so he had a deep impression of Xia ruofei’s superb skills. Moreover, song Zhengping had found out about Xia ruofei’s military service history, which was why he had asked Xia ruofei to help out with security. Xia ruofei was very familiar with the job of protecting the Bureau chief. He smiled and said without hesitation,””Alright! Since you trust me so much, then I’ll help you!” “Thank you!” Song Zhengping said happily,”old Lu will contact you for the details. You can directly contact staff officer Xu for the security matters!” “No problem!” …… A week passed by in the blink of an eye. Xia ruofei had settled some matters in advance, including the supply of vegetables and some daily affairs of the company. He had explained everything to ye Lingyun and pang Hao. Ling Xiaotian had already worked out the specific plan to acquire the winery. Xia ruofei had even gone to their company to sign the cooperation contract a few days ago. Xia ruofei did not ask about the rest of the acquisition matters. Anyway, Ling Xiaotian had arranged a special team to do it. Xia ruofei even called to ask about the barbed wire fence he had ordered and learned that it was half complete. He told the factory not to deliver the goods for the time being after they were done and to contact them when he returned from abroad. He also called Ling Qingxue to explain the situation. This girl had been quite busy recently. Other than meeting once when Xia ruofei flew to the headquarters of lingji restaurant to sign the contract a few days ago, they had not seen each other since. They had only spoken on the phone or WeChat. Ling Qingxue had absolute trust in Xia ruofei, so she only told him to be careful over the phone. Xia ruofei bade farewell to ye Lingyun and pang Hao, then left the farm in his Knight XV and headed straight for elder song’s Gu Ling courtyard. Manager Lu personally welcomed Xia ruofei in front of the building and led him into the building with great enthusiasm. “Doctor Xia, I’ll have to trouble you this time!” Manager Lu said politely. “You’re too kind, manager Lu. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”don’t worry. Since I’ve promised Chief Judge song, I’ll do my best in terms of health care and security.” “Thank you! Thank you!” Manager Lu said,”doctor Xia, we’re traveling in plain clothes this time and we didn’t inform our comrades in the local area, so the security work is under a lot of pressure. You should go and contact Xiao Xu first! I’ll slowly tell you about the rest later!” “Alright! I’ll go find staff officer Xu myself. ” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Xia ruofei found Xu Wu’s office very quickly. He knocked on the door, but there was no response. That’s strange! Was he not here? Xia ruofei had a question in his mind. Xia ruofei casually twisted the ball lock and the office door opened. Xia ruofei thought that since Xu Wu did not lock the door, he should not have gone too far. He might be back soon. Hence, Xia ruofei decided to wait in the office. With this in mind, Xia ruofei walked into Xu Wu’s office. As soon as he entered the room, Xia ruofei suddenly felt a sense of danger and a chill ran down his spine ...Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com
