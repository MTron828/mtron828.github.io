After that, Liang Haitao quickly entered the ward with his men. In all fairness, although Liang Haitao’s young master had a lot of bad habits and had a very serious prejudice against Chinese medicine, his professional quality in the field of Western medicine was still very good. After all, he had studied in many famous schools and had a lot of opportunities to practice clinical medicine after working in 301. His medical skills naturally improved very quickly. There was no specialist with a high title who had an undeserved reputation. Therefore, even though elder song’s condition was critical, Liang Haitao remained calm and started to organize the rescue. Manager Lu, who had always been calm and steady, was a little flustered. He had followed elder song for more than ten years, and his feelings for elder song were no different from family. He was a little out of his wits when elder song was dying. Tian Huilan reminded manager Lu in a low voice. Manager Lu woke up from his daze and quickly took out his phone to call elder song’s children. However, after a round of calls, only elder song’s eldest son picked up. His plane had just landed at Hongzhou airport and he was rushing over in a car. The others had their phones turned off, so they must still be on the plane. After the call, manager Lu looked at Xia ruofei, as if he wanted to say something but stopped. Xia ruofei said calmly,”manager Lu, don’t be anxious. Let’s see how the emergency situation is. If it really doesn’t work, I’ll force my way in. I can’t guarantee anything else, but it’s not a problem for elder song to hold on until his children arrive.” Of course, Xia ruofei was being conservative. In fact, as long as he was willing to part with the petals of the flower, it was possible to cure eccentric song in a short time. However, that would be too shocking. Xia ruofei would not do that. In the ward, Liang Haitao and his medical team quickly injected elder song with a cardiac injection. Under the forced effect of the medicine, elder song’s blood pressure and pulse were temporarily stabilized, and they were starting to rise again. However, Xia ruofei still noticed that elder song’s hands that were exposed outside the blanket had some black spots. This was caused by the cancer cells invading his entire body. It meant that he was about to die. It could be said that if it wasn’t for eccentric song’s special status, any ordinary person would have been gone by now. Now, it was completely meaningless to rely on devices and drugs to prolong his survival. If Xia ruofei had not come today, then there was really nothing they could do. Liang Haitao wiped his sweat and checked the monitoring device again before he got up and left the room. When he saw manager Lu and the other two, he couldn’t help but frown and ask,””Why are you guys still here? Manager Lu, have you informed the chief’s family? The effects of the cardiac stimulant won’t last for too long. The Bureau chief might not be able to last more than a few hours ...” “I’ve already called, but only Chief Judge song has arrived in Hongzhou and is on his way. The others ‘phones are all turned off, so they should still be on the plane ...” Director Lu said, then he couldn’t help but ask,”director Liang, is there really no other way?” Liang Haitao said impatiently,””Old Lu, I’ve told you many times. The Bureau chief is at his last moment. There are some things that need to be prepared!” Then, Liang Haitao looked at Xia ruofei sternly and said,””Also ... This person is not allowed to enter the ward! Did you hear that?” The last sentence was directed at the two soldiers in charge of guarding the door. The two soldiers replied in unison,””Yes!” They were on guard duty in the ward, so they naturally listened to the orders of the medical team leader. Liang Haitao glared at Xia ruofei coldly before returning to the lounge next to elder song’s ward. There were also hospital – like long chairs in the corridor. Manager Lu and the other two walked over and sat down. “Manager Lu, what should we do now?” Tian Huilan asked with a slight frown. Manager Lu’s expression was serious. He thought for a while before asking,””Doctor Xia, if you help, is there still hope for the chief?” In fact, manager Lu was already on the verge of despair. Almost everyone at his age had experienced the death of their loved ones. Manager Lu had already made a judgment about elder song’s current situation, but he was unwilling to accept it emotionally. “We need to check the patient’s condition to know,” Xia ruofei said calmly.”But it shouldn’t be a big problem if it can extend his life for a few days.” Manager Lu nodded and sat in his chair without saying anything. It was obvious that he was having an intense mental struggle. Tian Huilan stood up anxiously and looked into the room. Elder song was lying quietly on the bed in the ward, and two doctors were nervously monitoring the complicated instruments. His personal guard, Xu Wu, stood straight and not far from the door. His determined eyes were also filled with sadness. Only Xia ruofei was sitting calmly on the chair. The small suitcase was beside his feet. As long as he had the solution in the suitcase, Xia ruofei had nothing to worry about. Time passed by. About half an hour later, a doctor walked out of elder song’s room in a hurry. He stood at the door of the lounge next door and said hurriedly,””Director Liang, the chief’s vital signs are dropping again!” Liang Haitao walked into the ward quickly. This time, he didn’t even look at Xia ruofei and the others. Just as Liang Haitao walked into the ward, all sorts of alarms went off again, which meant that elder song’s vital signs had dropped to a very dangerous level. Manager lü stood up immediately. He saw Liang Haitao checking elder song’s pupils and doing some other checks. Then, he stood up and shook his head helplessly. “Director Liang!” Manager Lu called out anxiously. “Old Lu, the Bureau chief might not be able to wait for Secretary song to arrive ...” Liang Haitao turned around and said. Obviously, Liang Haitao thought that the rescue method was useless and was giving up. In fact, if it was an ordinary person, the hospital would have told his family to give up treatment long ago. It was because of elder song’s special status that the treatment was delayed for an entire day. “Don’t we have the cardiac stimulant?” Manager Lu called out. “It’s no use ...” Liang Haitao waved his hand weakly and said,”hurry up and report to the higher – ups! We still have a lot of work to do. ” When such a big bureau chief passed away, the medical unit had to accurately record the time of death and all kinds of data, which had to be stored in the historical archives. In addition, the nurse had to clean the chief’s body, change his clothes, and so on before the body stiffened. Just then, Xia ruofei stood up unhurriedly and walked into the ward with his suitcase. “Doctor Xia, you -” manager Lu called out. The two soldiers wanted to stop Xia ruofei by reflex, but Xia ruofei suddenly sped up. The two of them felt a huge force and were pushed to the sides. Xia ruofei passed through the two soldiers in an instant. The two soldiers ‘expressions changed drastically, and they subconsciously grabbed their guns. At this time, Xu Wu’s eyes gleamed, and he shook his head at the two of them without a trace. The soldier looked confused, but he still looked at Xu Wu and chose to obey his order. Manager Lu, Tian Huilan, and Xu Wu saw that Xia ruofei had entered, so they naturally followed him in. Manager Lu and Xu Wu were both their superiors, so the two soldiers would not stop them. In the ward, Liang Haitao’s face darkened when he saw Xia ruofei enter. He shouted,””Who let you in? Get out of here immediately!” “Since you’ve given up, it’s my turn now,” Xia ruofei said calmly. With that, Xia ruofei walked straight to elder song’s bed with his suitcase. “Impudent!” Liang Haitao scolded angrily. He walked forward to stop Xia ruofei, but Xia ruofei only waved his arm lightly. Liang Haitao staggered and took a few steps back, hitting the wall in a sorry state. Xia ruofei didn’t even look at Liang Haitao. He placed the suitcase on the bedside table, unzipped it, and opened the lid ...
