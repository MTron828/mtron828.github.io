2263 Meeting (1)

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile. He did not feel very restrained in elder song’s place. He was also very relaxed. Although it was not exactly like his own home, it was not as restrained as at the chief’s house.

At this moment, there was a light knock on the study door. Manager Lu pushed the door open and walked in.””Chief, you were looking for me?”

Eccentric song nodded and said,”Xiao Lu, contact the Liu family immediately. RUO Fei wants to meet the old man of the Liu family alone. Ask them to arrange it as soon as possible!”

Since it concerned the life and death of the pillar of the family, the people of the Liu family would definitely arrange a meeting as soon as possible. Elder song didn’t need to say anything else.

Manager Lu was a little surprised. He glanced at Xia ruofei. However, after working for the Bureau chief for so many years, he had long developed the habit of not speaking out of turn. So even if he had doubts in his heart, he did not say anything. He just nodded and simply replied,””Okay, I’ll contact him immediately!”

“Tell the kitchen to prepare more dishes for lunch, I’m going to stay at home to entertain ruofei,” elder song said.

“Alright!” Manager Lu replied,”chief, you can continue chatting with ruofei. I’ll be going down!”

“En!” Elder song nodded.

After manager Lu left, elder song was curious but he did not mention the Liu family. Instead, he started chatting with Xia ruofei.

He asked about Xia ruofei’s company’s situation with great concern.

Xia ruofei wasn’t a competent chairman. He didn’t know the company as well as Feng Jing, the CEO. However, elder song didn’t care about the detailed business data. Xia ruofei knew the general direction. After all, even if he wasn’t in the company, Feng Jing would still report to him through phone or email.

Hence, Xia ruofei gave a brief introduction of the company’s development, focusing on the construction of a pharmaceutical factory in Changping County and the preparation to expand the production of the Jushi cream and heart – nourishing soup.

Elder song had always been impressed by Xia ruofei’s heart – nourishing soup. When he heard that Xia ruofei had insisted on the low – Price strategy, that most of the production was inclined to domestic patients, and that he had even cooperated with the hospital to crack down on scalpers, elder song was very happy and praised him a few times.

“Ruofei, as an entrepreneur, you must have a strong sense of social responsibility!” Elder song said earnestly. You’ve done well in this regard! You’re a good child, I didn’t misjudge you! Remember, you must persevere! The heart – nourishing soup is not only a ray of hope for an autistic child in the dark night, it is also a ray of humanity for your paradise Corporation. As long as you do this project well and the company’s management is upright, no one will dare to have any crooked ideas about your company!”

Xia ruofei nodded in agreement. Elder song’s meaning was clear. The heart nourishing soup project was the protective talisman of the Paradise Corporation. The bigger the influence of this project, the higher the positive image of the company. Those who wanted to covet the company would have to think twice. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Not to mention that the song family had already openly supported the Paradise Corporation, so as long as one wasn’t a fool who couldn’t understand the situation, under normal circumstances, no one would dare to be jealous of the Paradise corporation’s future prospects and have any crooked thoughts.

Of course, families like the GAO family and the Liu family, who were on par with the song family, might also be wary of the song family, but the extent of their restraint would depend on how much the song family protected the Paradise Corporation.

Elder song then asked about the Paradise gathering.

Song Rui had a stake in the Paradise Association’s business and was one of the main founders. Elder song was naturally very concerned about his grandson’s rare business.

Xia ruofei said with a trace of shame,””Grandpa song, you know that I’m quite busy at the three mountains, so I don’t pay much attention to the peach blossom society. Big brother Yongjun and Xiao Rui are the ones taking care of things in Beijing, so I don’t know the details. However, from what I understand, the preparations for the Paradise gathering are going quite smoothly. Xiao Rui’s contributions can’t be overlooked!”

“Xiao Rui is my grandson, how can I not know him?” elder song waved his hand. This kid always did things in a three – minute fervor, and he was always carefree all day long. He was not meticulous enough! RUO Fei! This peach blossom gathering involves several families ‘children. With so many people participating, Xiao Rui is also one of them. You can’t just sit back and do nothing! You have to keep a close eye on them, in case these kids do something good and turn it into a bad thing!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry, but he didn’t dare to talk back to elder song. He could only nod and say,””I know, Grandpa song! You don’t have to worry too much. Brother Zhao Yongjun is mature and reliable. He’s also familiar with all aspects of Beijing. With him at the helm, Xiao Rui and the others won’t take any detours! Don’t you worry!”

“That kid from Zhao Cheng’s family?” Elder song nodded and said,”Xiaojun has the style of a general. He’s more or less reliable in his work! However, ruofei, you can slack off too. You have to keep an eye on Xiao Rui and the others! Especially after the club opens, you have to remind Xiao Rui!”

“Okay, Grandpa song!” Xia ruofei nodded.

After the two of them chatted for a while, manager Lu knocked on the door and came in.

He bowed slightly to elder song and reported,””Chief, the Liu family has replied. The meeting is scheduled for 2:30 this afternoon. Is that okay?”
