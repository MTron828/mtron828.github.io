“Wait! Wait a minute! Don’t say it yet!” Xia ruofei interrupted Bai Qingqing.

Bai Qingqing was a little shocked and asked,”what do you mean?” Do you still want to crack this nested space or not? I’m telling you, there might be some good treasures inside! According to the agreement, you can get 90%! I’m already starting to regret agreeing to your share of the profits. It turns out that I’ve only been able to get 10% after so much effort! I advise you to quickly get down to business before I change my mind! Otherwise, it’ll be too late for you to regret!”

Xia ruofei looked at Bai Qingqing with a faint smile and said,””My meaning is very simple. I don’t want you to tell me the way to crack it first, in case I can’t explain it clearly later ...”

“Ah?” Bai Qingqing was confused.”What do you mean by that? what do you mean?”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”I’m saying that I want to try to crack this nested space by myself first. That’s why I asked you not to tell me anything about cracking the nested space.” This way, if I succeed, I’ll crack it on my own, and naturally I won’t need to share the profits with you, right?”

Bai Qingqing was stunned. She then sneered and said,””W – what? I didn’t hear wrong, did I? Are you going to crack it on your own?”

“It seems like your hearing isn’t bad!” Xia ruofei shrugged.

“Who told you about your hearing?” Bai Qingqing said angrily,”do you think you can crack this nested space by yourself? What exactly gave you such an illusion? Xia ruofei, I can tell you clearly that even if you were to comprehend the rules of space for another hundred years, it would still be difficult to find the correct way to break the nested space! If you use brute force, there’s a 99% chance that you’ll destroy the storage ring, and the things hidden in the nested space will all fall into the spatial turbulence, never to be found again!”

“Won’t we know if it’s an illusion or not after we try?”Xia ruofei said with a smile.

He also said in his heart,”student Xiaobai, you’re right. If I had only comprehended the rules of space for a hundred years, I might not have been able to crack this nested space!” However, I’ve comprehended it for over a thousand years, so it should be barely enough ...

In fact, when Xia ruofei took the storage ring out of the cave, he had already checked it again. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

With his current rapid progress in spatial knowledge, what he saw was naturally very different from before.

Although it was just a glimpse, and Bai Qingqing had rushed over, Xia ruofei could basically confirm that he had the confidence to crack the nested space. In fact, he was very confident.

This was because the nested space was actually very similar to the overlapping small spaces inside the ore. However, the overlapping space area was a small part of a few independent small spaces that were intertwined with each other. A nested space was a space where a small space with a simpler rule was put into another small space. The former was like an intersection of geometry, while the latter was like concentric circles.

The core difference between the two was that the intersection of the nested spaces was actually the entire small space with simpler rules.

From the perspective of the laws, the nested space was undoubtedly much simpler than the layered space.

Hence, Xia ruofei only took a glance and confidently came to the conclusion that he could solve it.
