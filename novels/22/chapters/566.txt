Chapter 567: The mysterious Mr. Xia (1)

Boss Qian was even more confused. He felt that Liu Jinsheng was either trying to fool him, or he was planning a bigger scam, or he had lost his mind. He’s starting to talk nonsense!

“Liu Jinsheng, I don’t even know what you’re talking about!” Boss Qian said impatiently,”I’m very busy right now. Don’t make fun of me!”

Liu Jinsheng was about to cry. In the past, boss Qian had chased him to ask for a debt, but he had tried all sorts of reasons to shirk it. Later, when the matter was brought to court, he simply had a falling out and said that he would not return a single cent. Now that he had taken the initiative to return the money, no one would believe him.

This was simply a modern version of the story of the wolf!

Liu Jinsheng cried and said,”old Qian, I’m really sincere in returning the money this time!” How about this, if you don’t believe me, let’s go to the bank now, I’ve already written a check for you! Can you honor it on the spot?”

After Liu Jinsheng finished speaking, he took out the cash check he had written in advance and showed it to boss Qian.

Boss Qian snorted coldly, grabbed the check, and checked it over and over again.

The check didn’t look fake. The amount written on it was 83 million.

Liu Jinsheng revealed a flattering smile and said,””Old Qian, I owe you a total of 82 million. The remaining one million can be considered the interest for these years! I really can’t come up with any more money, I’m really sorry ...”

Boss Qian stared at Liu Jinsheng for a long time before he said,””To the bank!”

“Okay, okay ...” Liu Jinsheng quickly said.

“If you dare to fool me again,” boss Qian said coldly,”I’ll break your legs even if I have to be caught and sent to jail for a few years!”

“I don’t dare, I don’t dare ...”

“Hmph!”

Boss Qian took the lead and walked out of the building with the check.

When he opened the door, he saw Liu Jinsheng walking towards the taxi. He frowned and said,”Take my car!”

Boss Qian was worried that Liu Jinsheng would play some tricks again!

Liu Jinsheng quickly nodded in agreement and took another 100 yuan to send the taxi away. Then, he bowed and opened the door to get in the car.

Boss Qian started the car and drove out.

When they were about to drive out of the gate, boss Qian stopped the car and stuck his head out of the window to call out to them. Two big – Waist – sized workers immediately ran over.

“Get in the car!” Boss Qian said,”come with me to the city to do something!”

“Yes, boss!” Although the two workers didn’t know why Boss Qian suddenly called them over, they had to follow their boss’s orders.

Liu Jinsheng, who was sitting in the front passenger seat, saw this, and his face turned slightly pale. He asked,””Old Qian, what are you ...”

Boss Qian started the car again and said coldly,””If you’re lying to me again, the two of them will teach you a good lesson!”

Liu Jinsheng suddenly trembled and smiled apologetically,””I won ‘t, I won’ t. Old Qian, what are you thinking? I wouldn’t dare to lie to you!”

Boss Qian snorted coldly and did not say anything.

After the two workers in the back seat heard the conversation between Qian Laogang and Liu Jinsheng, they looked at Liu Jinsheng with an unfriendly expression, making Liu Jinsheng feel a chill down his back.

The car quickly arrived at the city area of ou Yue. Liu Jinsheng’s cash check was from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. Boss Qian found the nearest Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and walked in first.

Two workers, one on the left and one on the right, also walked into the bank with Liu Jinsheng.

The bank in the suburbs wasn’t very busy, and there were empty counters. Boss Qian walked over and put the cash check into the window. Then, he took out a bank card and handed it in as well.

“Comrade, I would like to cash this check into this card.” Boss Qian said.

“Alright, please wait a moment.” The counter attendant said.

She picked up the check and was shocked by the huge amount on it. She quickly pressed the intercom to call the manager over and the two of them carefully checked the cash and check together.

When boss Qian saw this, his heart could not help but skip a beat.

He thought,”Liu Jinsheng, this bastard, wouldn’t give me a fake check to fool me, right?” That was a sum of more than 80 million! If the check is fake, will I be arrested ...

Boss Qian thought about it and suddenly remembered that there was a surveillance camera installed in the living room of his house. If there was really something wrong with the check and the bank called the police, he wasn’t afraid. At most, he would just use the evidence to speak.

This check was given to him by Liu Jinsheng, and he was also a victim!

Thinking of this, boss Qian’s heart settled.

However, it was obvious that he was overthinking.

There was no problem with the check. As the amount was huge and boss Qian had deposited it directly into his own ICBC account, the bank manager was very friendly and invited them to the VIP room next door to personally handle the matter for him.

80 million was definitely a large amount. Even if boss Qian’s bank card had no money, it was enough to become a VIP customer of the bank.

Therefore, the bank was extremely efficient. They quickly cashed the check and transferred the money into boss Qian’s ICBC account.

Boss Qian’s mind was still blank as he held the business receipt.

Did Liu Jinsheng really return me the money? Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Boss Qian felt like he was in a dream. Even when the bank manager was recommending wealth management products at the side, he did not hear a word.

It was the two workers who reminded boss Qian that he came back to his senses.
