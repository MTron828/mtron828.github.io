Chapter 687: Obtaining the world stone (2)

The mahogany furniture? It was too big and inconvenient to move!

The treasured calligraphy of the great general Zheng that was hung on the wall? It’s possible ... General Zheng was an uncouth man, one of the ten old generals with outstanding achievements in the country. He didn’t leave many ink paintings in the world, and this one in Zhao Cheng’s collection was also very precious.

If neither of them was the case, could it be that he had really taken a fancy to the guns in general Zhao’s collection?

Jin Feng had been guessing in his heart.

Zhao Cheng was naturally thinking of similar problems.

Under their gazes, Xia ruofei walked to the fish tank without hesitation. He reached in and grabbed the realm stone as if no one was around.

Xia ruofei reached out and pulled out a few tissues from the coffee table beside the sofa. He wiped the water off his arms and the world stone, then picked up the stone and showed it to Zhao Cheng and Jin Feng.

Xia ruofei grinned.”Alright, I’m done with the gift selection. General Zhao, you don’t have to worry anymore, right?” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Jin Feng’s face was filled with shock, and Zhao Cheng was dumbfounded.

“Dr ... Dr. Xia, is this the gift you chose?” “This is too ...” Zhao Cheng said.

Xia ruofei kept the world stone in his bag and smiled.””Didn’t you say I could choose? I want it! Will general Zhao go back on his word?”

“No, no...” Zhao Cheng said hurriedly. His lips moved a few times before he said,”doctor Xia, you’re a good doctor Who doesn’t care about fame and fortune! I, old Zhao, will remember this favor! I won’t say any more words of thanks, but if you need my help in the future, just let me know, I won’t say anything!”

Jin Feng’s gaze towards Xia ruofei was filled with admiration and gratitude.

......

It was obvious that both of them thought that Xia ruofei had purposely chosen this worthless cobblestone. His motive was naturally to reject Zhao Cheng’s gift and at the same time, not to make things difficult for Zhao Cheng.

Such a ‘noble character and unquestionable integrity’ made the two of them really respect and grateful.

Xia ruofei knew what the two of them were thinking, but it was not easy to explain, so he could only let them misunderstand.

No matter what was said, being able to obtain this precious world stone while treating Zhao Cheng was a pleasant surprise.

This trip was not in vain!

After obtaining the world stone that he wanted the most, Xia ruofei was eager to return home. He said,””General Zhao, I’ll take my leave then! Please send a car to send me to the airport!”

“Don’t worry, doctor Xia,”Zhao Cheng quickly said. Sit down and have a rest. ”

“Is there anything else, general Zhao?” Xia ruofei asked, puzzled.

Zhao Cheng smiled and did not answer Xia ruofei’s question. Instead, he turned to Jin Feng and said,””Little Jun! Call the military air force immediately and ask them if they have any transportation plans or training plans to San Shan city in the southeast province today. I have an important guest to board the plane!”

“Yes!” Jin Feng immediately stood at attention and replied.

After saying that, Jin Feng immediately walked to the corner of the living room, picked up the military line, and made a call.

He understood what Zhao Cheng meant. This phone call wasn’t just a simple inquiry. The military air force didn’t care if the original plan was to have a transport plane to Sanshan city, but after Jin Feng made this phone call, there would definitely be one.

Adjusting the training plan at the last minute and letting the pilots fly in unfamiliar airspace and routes was also a part of the actual combat training!

Sure enough, a few minutes later, Jin Feng walked over with a majestic gait. He saluted Zhao Cheng and said,””Chief of staff! A transport plane from the military’s Air Force took off from Nanyuan Airport an hour later and flew to the Yixu military airport in Sanshan city, Southeast province! I’ve already made the arrangements. Doctor Xia, you can take this plane back to the three mountains!”

“Good! There’s almost enough time. Xiao Ling, arrange for a car immediately. You have to personally bring the car and send Dr Xia to the plane!” Zhao Cheng said.

“Yes!” Jin Feng stood at attention and said.

Zhao Cheng turned to Xia ruofei and smiled.””Doctor Xia, do you think my arrangement is okay? Even though military transport planes are not as comfortable as civilian planes, they have a shorter flight time and this is a rather special experience. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s good!” General Zhao, I haven’t been on a military plane for more than a year. It’s quite good to experience it again. Thank you!”

“Hahaha! Then let’s not waste any more time. Time is a little tight, so you can set off now!” Zhao Cheng said happily.

Jin Feng had already prepared the car. Zhao Cheng personally sent Xia ruofei to the door and watched the mengshi command car drive away with mixed feelings. After a while, he turned around and returned to the house.

Jin Feng was leading the car in front. He was still silent, but he was obviously different from when he had arrived. The Colonel was full of admiration and gratitude for Xia ruofei.

The car sped all the way and arrived at Nanyuan Airport in more than 40 minutes.

Because of the flight training, the security level of the airport had also been raised a lot. They could already see hidden sentries scattered all over the place even from a distance away from the airport.

However, this mengshi command vehicle with a military license plate was unimpeded all the way. It quickly entered the military airport and came directly to the runway.

An army green transport plane was parked on the runway and the engine had been activated. Several soldiers in Air Force woodland camouflage stood near the plane. When they saw the car coming, several soldiers quickly came up to greet it.

Both parties saluted and exchanged pleasantries.

Only then did Xia ruofei know that among these people, there was the chief political commissar of the station and the Chief of Staff of the flying unit.
