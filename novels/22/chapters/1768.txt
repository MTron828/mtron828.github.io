Chapter 1769: A reality (1)

Gao Jun couldn’t help but be stunned. There’s such an operation?

He knew that Xia ruofei had a high position in Zhao Yongjun’s entrepreneurial team. Although Zhao Yongjun was the legal representative, Xia ruofei was also a major shareholder. His shares were the same as Zhao Yongjun ‘s.

Hou Liang saw through Gao Jun’s doubts and said with a smile,””Gaotai, if brother Jun says there’s no problem, then there’s definitely no problem!”

Zhao Yongjun also laughed and said,”Gao tai, maybe I didn’t make it clear. I’m saying that I can represent Paradise Club to sign a cooperative agreement with your station. After that, I will go and persuade RUO Fei to agree. We will give you a definite answer in a short time. It won’t affect the normal preparation of your station’s program.”

Only then did Gao Jun let out a sigh of relief and said,””If that’s the case, I don’t have any problems with that.”

Zhao Yong Jun was overjoyed.”Then let’s have lunch together and sort out some of our cooperation intentions. We’ll make an agreement and sign it today!”

“Good! President Zhao, you’re so straightforward!” Gao Jun smiled and said,”then I wish us a happy cooperation!”

“Happy cooperation!” Zhao Yongjun shook hands with Gao Jun. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Then, Zhao Yongjun ordered Hou Liang to arrange lunch.

Gao Jun immediately contacted his Secretary and asked him to bring his computer and the template of the cooperation agreement and rush to Xiaotang.

Xia ruofei didn’t know that Zhao Yongjun had already made the decision for him and was still chatting happily with Xu lang.

At around 11:30, the guests left one after another. Xu lang, who was naturally arranged by the Huaxia mystic arts Society, left with Lu Shengsi and the others. However, before getting into the car, Xu lang and Xia ruofei called for their contact information.

Xia ruofei said goodbye to Zhao Yongjun and left with Ling Qingxue, returning to the courtyard house in liuhai Lane.

Ling Qingxue’s schedule was also very tight. She had to leave the capital and return to the three mountains in the evening, so the two of them cherished every moment they had together.

Xia ruofei sent Wu Qiang out to look for food while he prepared lunch with Ling Qingxue. The two of them enjoyed a rare alone time together.

In the afternoon, Wu Qiang tactfully strolled around outside and did not return to siheyuan. He also cherished every second that the two of them spent together after they parted. He locked himself in the big bedroom in the middle courtyard for the entire afternoon and went crazy.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue only came out of the room at FiveO’ clock.

At that moment, Ling Qingxue’s face was still flushed red, and her legs were weak. She had already packed her luggage and was ready to leave for the airport.

The flight was at 7:30 pm. According to the annoying traffic in Beijing, if they set off at this time, they would be able to arrive 40 to 50 minutes before departure.

The two of them arrived at the backyard. Xia ruofei drove the Land Rover while Ling Qingxue sat in the front passenger seat. The two of them did not speak much along the way, and a faint sense of separation filled the car.

When the car reached the airport, Xia ruofei smiled and pinched Ling Qingxue’s face.””Alright, wife! Don’t make such a bitter face! You’ll only be back a few days earlier than me. I’ll return to the three mountains after settling some matters here ...”

Ling Qingxue revealed a rare girlish side and said,””We’ve just met, I can’t bear to part with you ...”

“Then why don’t you just stay here today!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”stay with me for a few days, then we’ll go back to the three mountains together. I still haven’t had enough fun in the afternoon! Let’s continue at night ...”

Ling Qingxue’s face reddened, and she lowered her eyes.”Are you a donkey? I don’t want to accompany you!”

Ling Qingxue then said softly,””There’s been a lot of work at the company recently. I’m here to take up more time for other trips. Ruofei, I’ll accompany you more when I’m free in the future ...”

“When are you free?” Xia ruofei said with a bitter face,”I think you’re going to be busy forever!”

Ling Qingxue’s expression froze for a moment, and she said in embarrassment,””We have to wait until the expansion of the chain is over ...”

“I’m afraid there will be other matters at that time!” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”I think you should just tell uncle Ling that the company should be handed over to a professional manager to manage. You’ll never have the time to deal with all those administrative work.”

“Mm! “I know ...” Ling Qingxue said.

Xia ruofei said,”uncle Ling, you’re too much. You’re still young, but you’re always thinking about retirement. It’s easy for you, but it’s hard on my wife!”

“You’re not allowed to say that about my dad!” Ling Qingxue said, pouting.

Then, she looked at her watch and said,””Ruofei, it’s almost time...I should go in ...”

“Alright, I’ll send you off!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

At the security checkpoint, after Ling Qingxue had passed the No – go Lane, she turned around and hugged Xia ruofei gently. She whispered into his ear,””I’m not by your side, so you’re not allowed to do anything that will let me down!”

“Don’t worry, my wife!”Xia ruofei nodded.

As soon as Xia ruofei finished speaking, Ling Qingxue stood on her tiptoes and quickly kissed Xia ruofei on the lips. Then, she pulled her suitcase and turned to walk into the security checkpoint.

Xia ruofei touched his lips that still had a trace of fragrance. He watched as Ling Qingxue’s figure disappeared into the corridor before he turned around and walked out of the airport in disappointment.
