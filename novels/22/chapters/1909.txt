Chapter 1910 Solid proof (2)

“Alright!” Zeng Liang said,”I reckon that Liu haojun is currently in his Sage phase. The possibility of him coming back to the West Lake residence today is very low. Wang Chong and Aijun can just keep an eye on him!”

“Yeah!” Xu Yougang nodded. Tell the two of them not to let their guard down. They might find other useful clues!”

“Understood!” Zeng Liang said.

With his laptop bag in one hand, Xu Yougang took out his mobile phone with the other and dialed Xia ruofei’s number. Naturally, he dialed the newbie number that they had prepared in advance.

Xia ruofei was having an afternoon nap in the executive suite of the chairman’s office on the top floor. His phone was placed on the bed. He woke up immediately when the phone rang. He sat up and answered the call immediately. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Old Xu, is there good news?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Yes, boss!” Xu Yougang said. We’ve already obtained sufficient information. If it’s convenient for you, I’d like to let you have a look. Also, please give us your instructions on our next step. ”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and nodded.””No problem! Then ... Half an hour later, let’s meet at the rain – listening teahouse on Xibin road!”

“Okay, boss!” Xu Yougang said.

After he hung up the phone, he bade Zeng Liang farewell and left the rental house with his laptop bag.

As the two cars had been driven away by Wang Chong and Zhang Aijun, Xu Yougang hailed a cab and headed straight to Xibin road.

More than 20 minutes later, Xu You had just arrived at the rain – listening teahouse. He was about to call Xia ruofei when his cell phone rang. He looked at it and saw that it was Xia ruofei.

As soon as Xu You answered the call, Xia ruofei’s voice came from the phone.””I’ve already seen you. You can go directly to the bright Pavilion on the second floor! I’ll be waiting for you here!”

“Understood!” Xu Yougang replied.

Rain listening teahouse, bright front Pavilion private room.

As soon as Xu You opened the sliding door, he saw Xia ruofei sitting in front of the misty tea table. Hearing the noise, Xia ruofei raised his head and smiled at him.””Come over and sit! Close the door!”

“Yes!” Xu Yougang said.

He closed the door and went to the tea table. He sat down opposite Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei pushed a cup of tea in front of him and smiled.””Try this tea! I brought this Da Hong Pao myself. I didn’t use the tea leaves from their teahouse ...”

“Thank you, boss!” Xu Yougang said.

Then he picked up the teacup and drank it in one gulp. Although the tea was a little hot, he didn’t even frown. He just wiped his mouth and said,””Boss, I don’t know about this. I’m ruining your good tea ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”drinking tea is about one’s state of mind. What’s there to not understand?” But I don’t think you’re in the mood to drink tea, so let’s talk about serious business!”

This was exactly what Xu Yougang wanted. He nodded and took out his laptop from his bag. He turned it on and said,””Boss, please take a look at the information we took ...”

Xia ruofei nodded. Seeing that the computer was still on, he asked,””Was it taken in the apartment at the West Lake Mansion?”

“Mm! The video of Liu haojun and Fang Chenchen having an affair. ” Xu Yougang said,”the video and sound are very clear, and we didn’t cut a single cut. No matter where we go to verify it, it’s absolutely impossible to come to the conclusion that the video is fake. This is the proof!”

“Let’s take a look first!” Xia ruofei nodded.

Soon, the computer was turned on and entered the system. Xu Yougang put the CD into the CD drive and opened the video file on the CD. Then, he turned the computer screen in Xia ruofei’s direction and handed him the headphones.

Xia ruofei put on his headphones and looked at the computer screen. He listened to the sound quality for a while, then reached out for the mouse and played the entire video at eight times the normal speed.

“Not bad, not bad!” Xia ruofei said,”the effect of the shooting was very good! Old Xu, you guys really have some skills! It’s done so quickly!”

“It’s mainly because the equipment is good,” Xu Yougang said humbly.”You get what you pay for!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”the equipment is for human use!” I’ve done this before. To install the equipment in such a good position without anyone noticing, it’s impossible without some real skill, so you don’t have to be humble!”

Xu Yougang smiled and did not continue Xia ruofei’s words.

Xia ruofei touched his chin and said,””Old Xu, everyone did well this time! When you go back, tell Zeng Liang and the others that I’m very satisfied!”

“I will convey it!” “Boss, what’s our next step? do you have any instructions?” Xu Yougang asked.

Having one such video was already solid evidence. If they continued to watch, they would at most shoot a few more of such videos. There was no substantial meaning to it. After all, they were not selling small movies. The more, the better.

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said,””Yes ... I have the items, but how to use them to maximize the effects is a problem! Old Xu, do you have any suggestions?”

Xu Yougang had obviously thought about this before. He didn’t think much and said,””The most convenient way is naturally to spread this information on the internet! The mobile internet is very developed now. Once things get online, it’s basically a virus spread. It’s very fast and has a great influence. “
