When Feng Rao heard this, she couldn’t help but glance at Xia ruofei. She smiled and asked,””So, there’s already news from the government of Changping?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”yeah!” And it was also good news! How was it? I’m pretty efficient, aren’t I?”

“It seems like your beautiful sister has helped you a lot!” Feng Rao giggled and said,”tell me! What are the conditions that the people from Chang Ping County have given us?”

Xia ruofei grinned.”Actually, I only said that we’re preparing to start a pharmaceutical factory branch project. The total investment will not be less than 1.5 billion. We haven’t even discussed the details, but Changping County has already attached great importance to it. We’ve had a meeting with the Standing Committee this afternoon and set some preferential conditions!”

Then, Xia ruofei told Feng Jing everything he had heard from Wu Liqian, including the land acquisition and tax concessions, as well as the construction of infrastructure.

After hearing this, Feng Rao was also happy and said,””Not bad! This time, Changping County was really full of sincerity! Such a preferential treatment is really great!”

In recent years, the local government had gradually become more rational in terms of investment and no longer regarded the scale of investment as an extremely important achievement. It was rare to see a five – year tax exemption and other preferential conditions like in the past.

Xia ruofei laughed.”I didn’t expect it either. Especially since Changping County has taken the initiative to bear the basic construction costs. This is equivalent to saving us a lot of money!”

“In that case, let’s strike while the iron is hot and put these preferential policies on paper as soon as possible!” Said Feng Rao. I’ll contact the construction Bank tomorrow as soon as I start work. The money will be in my account latest by next Monday. This way, the project can already be launched!”

“It’s all up to Xue Jinshan. ” Xia ruofei said,”he has done a lot of preparation work in the early stages. I don’t know if he can keep up with the pace this time.”

After the factory site was selected, the overall planning and design had to be carried out. Then, the bidding process had to be carried out. After the winning construction party received the project Advance payment, the construction team would enter the site to build. In addition, the pharmaceutical factory also needed to contact the Germany manufacturers to order the automatic production line at the same time. It could be said that the early work was still very cumbersome.

“I’ll give factory manager Xue a call later,” Feng Jing said with a smile.”I’m sure he’ll catch up with the work even if he doesn’t sleep at night after hearing this news!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”This kid talks about opening a branch factory all day long. As long as he meets me, he will mention this matter. My ears are getting calluses! After this project is completed, I can finally have some peace and quiet ...”

Feng Rao couldn’t help but chuckle.

The first generation of entrepreneurs of paradise Corporation, including Feng Jing, pang Hao, Xue Jinshan, and the others, were all very enthusiastic about their work. They basically didn’t need to be mobilized, and their minds were filled with their own business affairs every day. It could be said that they had witnessed the rapid growth of the Paradise Corporation from a small farm. As the witnesses of this miracle, they were full of a sense of belonging to the company and completely treated their work as their own career.

Xia ruofei continued,”Oh right, get Dong Yun to contact the people from Changping County and try to reach a written agreement as soon as possible!” The people in the system are used to being a burden. I’m really afraid that when we’re ready in all aspects, this side will be a burden instead!”

“Even the Standing Committee was called on time, I’m sure no one would dare to delay the follow – up work ...” Feng Rao said with a smile.

“That’s true. It’s not accurate to say that they’re inefficient. Once the leaders pay attention to them, their efficiency will be shockingly high!” Xia ruofei laughed.

At this moment, someone knocked on the office door again. This time, it was the Executive Director, Dong Yun, who walked in.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. “What’s going on today? Whoever you think of will immediately appear ... Does it have to be so effective!”

“What’s the situation?”asked Dong Yun, confused.

“I was just talking to President Feng about you!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Is there something you need, Chairman?” Dong Yun asked.

“Yes, I do have some work for you.” Xia ruofei smiled.”Let’s talk about you first!”

“Alright!” Dong Yun nodded and said,”chief Xia, chief Feng, a few minutes ago, the Changping County party Committee Office took the initiative to contact our company. They expressed that they hoped to arrange a meeting between the two parties to discuss the Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory project.”

Xia ruofei and Feng Jing looked at each other and smiled.””As expected, the higher – ups pay attention to it, so the lower – ups are more efficient! You’ve taken the initiative to contact us so quickly!”

“It seems like the negotiation this time is going to be very easy!” Feng Rao said with a smile.

Xia ruofei nodded.”Director Dong, please reply to them. Tell them that we can do it anytime. See when it’s more convenient for them.”

“Alright!” Dong Yun nodded and said.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”I won’t be joining this meeting.” President Feng, since you already know the situation, why don’t you ... Work a little harder?”

If Wu Liqian were to lead the team, Xia ruofei would not dare to act arrogantly and would definitely come out personally. However, now that he was sure that Wu Liqian would not follow up on this matter personally, Xia ruofei lost interest.

Feng Rao thought for a moment and said,”sure!” As long as the timing doesn’t clash with the bank’s side!”

“Then we’ll decide on the time!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“This is fine!” Feng Jing said,”director Dong, why don’t we ... Do it tomorrow afternoon?” I have to go to Jianxing in the morning!”

“No problem. I’ll reply to them like that.” Dong Yun said.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” Just reply like this. Also, let’s meet at our company! This is the first time the new headquarters is welcoming outsiders, they should be very honored!”

Dong Yun couldn’t help pursing her lips and smiling. She nodded and said,”Alright!”

“Wait a minute ...” Xia ruofei felt that he had missed out on some information, but he could not recall what it was.

He frowned and thought for a while. Feng Jing and Dong Yun did not know what was wrong with Xia ruofei, so they did not dare to disturb him and just waited quietly at the side.

Xia ruofei’s mind suddenly lit up and he caught the key information that he had overlooked.

He turned to Dong Yun and asked,”director Dong, you just said ... Who is in contact with our company?”

Dong Yun was somewhat baffled and said blankly,”Changping County!”

“What unit is it in Changping County?” Xia ruofei continued to ask.

“The county party Committee Office!” Dong Yun said.

“The county party Committee Office!” Xia ruofei slapped his thigh and muttered to himself,”how could it be the county party Committee? Director Dong, are you sure you didn’t mishear?”

“I didn’t answer the call, but I’ve checked the content of the call and the caller’s name repeatedly. There shouldn’t be a problem.” Dong Yun said.

“That’s not right ...” Xia ruofei said.”How could it be the county party Committee that contacted us?”

This project was introduced by Wu Liqian. According to common sense, she was the one leading and following up on this matter, so there was no doubt that she would be the one to take the credit for the achievements. She was the county government’s Deputy County Head. Even if she didn’t come personally this time and sent her subordinates to do it, the peach blossom company should have contacted the government office instead of the county party Committee!

“What’s wrong?” Feng Jing asked in confusion,”Chairman, are you worried that this phone call is a scam? I don’t think so ... This information isn’t something a scammer can get hold of. Besides, this kind of obvious lie will be exposed as soon as both sides communicate. Even a scammer wouldn’t make such a low – Level mistake!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”I’m not saying that there’s a problem with the phone. It’s just that the person who made the call is a little unreasonable.”

Then, Xia ruofei said to Dong Yun,”Director Dong, how about this? Let’s not rush to give them accurate information first. We should have registered the number when the other party called, right? Call back and confirm the other party’s unit ...”

“Okay ...” Although Dong Yun did not know what Xia ruofei was up to, she still nodded and accepted the simple task.

Xia ruofei continued,”if it’s confirmed that it’s the county party Committee, you can also ask them who are the people who came to attend the meeting and what their positions are.” It’s easy to find a reason. Just say that we have to prepare for the reception in advance, and that we also have to determine the equivalent reception candidates in advance!”

“Understood, I’ll do it now!” Dong Yun nodded and said.
