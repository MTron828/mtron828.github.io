Chapter 3435: Out of expectations (1)

Translator: 549690339

Of course, once Xia ruofei found a way, it was only a matter of time before he removed the star Fern thorn.

He released his spiritual power in the spirit map space and continued to investigate the distribution of the star Fern thorns. After finding the best position, he left the space in a flash.

Before the star Fern thorn’s attack arrived, he had already grabbed the spirit map scroll and accurately threw it at the position he had chosen. Then, with a thought, he entered the space again.

The overwhelming thorn attacks of the star Fern naturally all hit empty air.

Then, Xia ruofei repeated the previous process. He set up the fire array bit by bit and then activated the array.

The rest was simple. He only needed to watch the burning flames outside in the spirit map space and wait quietly for the area to be cleared.

Xia ruofei even felt that time passed too slowly in the Archcan realm and decided to move to the mountain and sea realm. This way, time would be synchronized with the outside world.

In addition, he could chat with Ling Qingxue while watching the show, so that she wouldn’t worry.

As more and more areas were cleared out, there were not many star Fern thorns left in the hall.

In the end, Xia ruofei used it twelve times to clean up the entire patch of star Fern thorn.

There were still some fish that had escaped the net, but they were all in the corners. The large – scale fire array was unable to cover them.

Hence, Xia ruofei decided to leave the spirit map space. The main hall was very spacious and he stood in the middle, away from the attack range of the star Fern thorns.

Then, he moved Ling Qingxue out of the spirit map space.

Ling Qingxue had been chatting with Xia ruofei, but she did not know how the battle was going. When she came out and saw the empty Hall and the burn marks on the ground, she could not help but be surprised.

“RUO Fei, you still found a chance to use the formation?” Ling Qingxue asked.

She could not imagine how Xia ruofei had managed to set up the formation. Just now, the hall was filled with star Fern thorns. Even though she had only caught a glimpse of it, she had still managed to get a general idea of the situation. She was very clear that there was no space to set up an array in that situation.

Not to mention, as long as they came out from behind the image wall, they would be attacked by the star Fern thorns, and there was no time at all.

That was why Ling Qingxue was very curious.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”there are always more solutions than difficulties!” They’re just some immobile plants. How is it possible for them to block my way?”

“There’s still a fish that escaped the net!” Ling Qingxue giggled as she pointed at the few star Fern thorns in the corner.

Xia ruofei said nonchalantly,”! purposely stayed behind!” There’s no point in just using fire, I’m going to cut it alive!”

Xia ruofei wasn’t bragging. If he wanted to end the battle quickly, he could just use a small fire array and burn them all.

Although the corners of the hall were rather narrow, it was still enough to set up a small fire array.

“Then I’ll just support you from the side!” Ling Qingxue said with a smile.

“Just you wait!” Xia ruofei said. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Then, he directly controlled the qushuang flying sword and the blue immortal sword to stab at the star Fern closest to him.

Now that the hall was very spacious, he could completely hide outside the attack range of the star Fern thorn and use his flying sword to deal with them.

Speaking of which, he was basically not in any danger.

It was just that when he encountered the star Fern thorn previously, his attack power was not enough to pose a threat to the star Fern thorn. However, it was completely different now.

The qushuang flying sword and the traveling Jade immortal sword could leave obvious wounds on the branches of the star Fern thorn. Most importantly, the star Fern thorn’s recovery speed could no longer keep up with the destruction speed of the two flying swords. As a result, the wounds naturally grew larger and larger.

Xia ruofei spent more than ten minutes, relying on the long – range attack of his flying sword, to cut a star Fern thorn into pieces.

After getting rid of the star Fern thorn, Xia ruofei had once again tested his strength and lost interest.

For the remaining few star Fern thorns, he immediately set up a few small – scale flame arrays and began to burn them at the same time. It didn’t take long for all the star Fern thorns in the hall to be swept away.

Xia ruofei kept the materials and smiled.””Done! Continue forward! Let’s sec if there’s anything more to the cloud heaven Palace.”

Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei with admiration and said,””Ruofei, you’re really amazing! I think with your endless means, there aren’t many cultivators on earth who can be stronger than you!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,” I probably can’t beat the old man of the Chen family, Chen Nanfeng, now. In addition, the world of cultivation is so big, there must be many hidden masters. Maybe there is a master hidden in some corner!”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but laugh,”how can there be so many experts?” Didn’t you say that Earth’s cultivation environment is very bad? Even extremely talented cultivators find it hard to improve their cultivation.” “Isn’t it? Therefore, there’s nothing to be proud of, even if you’re the king of the cultivation world on earth!” Xia ruofei said,”from a cultivation point of view, it’s a poor and remote place!”

When Xia ruofei said this, he couldn’t help but lose interest. He said, “Let’s go! Qingxue, Earth’s cultivation environment is just like that. We can’t change anything. However, it was clear that there were great opportunities in the trial Pagoda. We’ve already gained a lot of benefits along the way. Such an opportunity is hard to come by, so we have to strive to get as many benefits as we can, so that we can have more resources to support our cultivation in the future..”
