Chapter 1436: The hot stone pot (2)

Translator: 549690339

“Why do you want to go to the hospital?” Xia ruofei asked. It’s just a small injury, I can handle it myself!”

After he finished speaking, he took his bag with his uninjured right hand and reached in to feel around. In fact, he took out a small box of ointment from the spirit map space.

Xia ruofei had prepared a lot of this ointment. It was made from some common medicine for injuries and falls, then mixed with some spirit Heart Flower petal solution.

Although there were very few ingredients in the petals of the spirit Heart Flower, they were very effective for external injuries, burns, mosquito bites, and so on.

Xia ruofei then took out a box of silver needles from his bag. He had kept it in his storage space as a backup. Now that his Chinese medicine skills had improved rapidly, the silver needles were used for acupuncture.

“Young man, please light up this alcohol stove.” Xia ruofei said to the waiter in a friendly manner.

There was an alcohol stove on the table, and after the fish was served, a stone pot would be placed on top to maintain the temperature of the dish.

After the shocked waiter lit the alcohol stove with trembling hands, Xia ruofei took a silver needle and sanitized it over the fire, as if no one was around. Then, he spread out his injured left hand.

He thought for a moment and said to the waiter,””Do you have a first aid kit in your store? I need some gauze and bandages. ” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Yes, yes, yes!” The waiter quickly said,”please wait a moment, I’ll go get it right away!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. When the waiter went to get the things, Xia ruofei said to the middle – aged female employee,””Aunty, please wait a moment. I’ll treat the wound on my hand.”

He knew that the female employee had also been scalded, but not as badly as his hand.

The middle – aged female employee said gratefully,””Young man, I really have to thank you this time!”

“You’re welcome! It’s good that everyone is fine!” Xia ruofei grinned.”It’s going to be the new year soon. It’ll be so sad if I get injured and end up in the hospital.”

Ling Qingxue, who was standing at the side, couldn’t help but tear up. She also blamed Xia ruofei in her heart. You already know that the new year is coming, so why are you still trying to act tough? Now that her hand was injured like this, how was she going to spend the new year?

However, Ling Qingxue couldn’t say too much in front of the middle – aged female employee, in case she felt even more guilty.

Soon, the waiter ran over with a small first aid kit. Normally, the store would have one or two such things in case the customer was injured or suddenly fell ill.

The store manager, who had a nervous expression on his face, also came with him.

When the store manager heard that the customer had been scalded, he was also scared out of his wits. These days, the customer was God. If the customer was injured in your store, and it was even caused by an employee’s mistake, you would have no choice but to demand compensation.

“Sir, I’m the manager of this store. I’m very sorry ...” The store manager said carefully.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and interrupted him, saying,””I’m sorry, I need to deal with the wound on my hand first!”

The store manager saw Xia ruofei’s scalded hand with a few large blisters. He couldn’t help but take a deep breath and quickly said,””Sir, this ... We should go to the hospital! We’ll bear all the medical expenses!”

“No need!” Xia ruofei smiled.

Once again, he put the silver needle on the fire to disinfect it. Then, without hesitation, he pierced a bubble with the needle without even frowning.

The large bubble shriveled at a speed visible to the naked eye, and at the same time, a lot of pus flowed out.

According to the treatment method of the people, after the bubble was burst, a strand of hair had to be strung together so that the pus could continue to flow out and not accumulate inside.

However, Xia ruofei obviously did not need that.

Everyone, including Ling Qingxue, was so scared that they did not dare to look. Xia ruofei, however, continued to poke the bubbles one by one as if nothing had happened. He released the pus inside and wiped it away with gauze.

Then he opened the box and applied the ointment evenly on the wound.

There were very few spirit Heart Flower petals in the ointment, so the effect was not that obvious. However, Xia ruofei still felt a cooling sensation and the pain was reduced.

In the end, Xia ruofei put a piece of gauze on it and bandaged the scalded part.

Although he could only use one hand, Xia ruofei’s movements were still very skillful. With the help of his teeth, he did not need any help at all and easily completed the final dressing.

The store manager saw Xia ruofei treating his wound with ease and felt much more at ease. It seemed like this person would not ask for an exorbitant price. Otherwise, he would have been sent to the hospital. Furthermore, if they had not settled the compensation, they would not even let him treat his wound. The more miserable he looked, the more compensation he would get!

The store manager thought about her words and was about to speak when Xia ruofei spoke to the middle – aged female employee in a friendly manner,””Aunty, this ointment of mine is very effective for burns. I’ll give the rest to you. If it’s not convenient for you to apply the medicine, you can find a female colleague to help you!”

The middle – aged female employee’s burn was on her back, so it was not convenient for Xia ruofei to apply medicine for her. Besides, there were so many people in the lobby. He could not possibly ask her to lift her clothes. There was not much left in the box, so Xia ruofei gave it all to the middle – aged female employee.

The female employee took the ointment gratefully. Her lips trembled a few times, not knowing how to express the gratitude in her heart.

Seeing this, the store manager said,”Auntie Qin, you go and apply the medicine first!” Change your clothes and come back!”

This middle – aged female employee’s clothes were covered in soup. It was obvious that she could no longer wear it.

The middle – aged female employee took the ointment and went to find a place to apply it.

The store manager couldn’t help but feel a little nervous. He said,””Sir, I’m really sorry for what happened. Don’t worry, we’ll definitely take responsibility for the compensation!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s good that she’s fine!” We don’t need any compensation. To be honest, we don’t need this little money ...”

“That won’t do. No matter what, that’s our kind intentions. Otherwise, we’ll really feel bad!” The store manager was delighted, but he still said that.

“If that’s the case, I’ll state two conditions!” Xia ruofei said.

The store manager’s expression froze slightly, thinking that he was digging a hole to bury himself. If he had known earlier, he wouldn’t have said that. He had hit the snake with the stick.

His mind was filled with a myriad of thoughts, but he still had a smile on his face.”Please speak! Please speak! As long as it’s within our means, we’ll definitely do it!”
