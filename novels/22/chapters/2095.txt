2096 Control experimentation_2

The flow of time in the Archean realm was 30 times faster than the outside world. Xia ruofei wanted to make use of the difference in the flow of time to make these young geese go hungry quickly.

“Go!” Xia ruofei nodded.

Xia Qing had just circled a small area of the grassland in the mountain sea realm, built a simple fence, and put the young geese in it.

When Xia Qing went to pick the young geese, Xia ruofei was the first to arrive at the Archean realm. He used the apparatus for brewing Chinese medicine and stored some common medicinal herbs. They were all at the Archean realm.

Xia ruofei quickly picked out some Chinese medicinal herbs from the shelves. Sometimes, he would stop and think for a moment before picking a few more. Finally, he wrapped these medicinal herbs separately and placed them all into a plastic tidying box. Then, he took out a clay stove, a clay pot, charcoal, and other items to boil the medicine. With a thought, he returned to the mountain and sea realm.

In the end, Xia ruofei chose two prescriptions. Both of them were made of common medicinal herbs that met the requirements. They were not expensive and were suitable for mass cultivation while ensuring the efficacy of the herbs.

In the cave in the mountain sea realm, Xia ruofei was writing and drawing on a piece of paper. After a few adjustments, each prescription had two different ratios of medicinal materials.

After all, the body of a Strasburg goose was very different from that of a human body. Besides, Xia ruofei did not need to consider the problem of the mild effect of the medicine. What he wanted was the strong effect of the medicine, so the proportion of the main medicine had to be increased.

Xia ruofei felt that the ratio of each ingredient was the best.

With one prescription and two ratios, there were four plans. In addition, they had to use the ordinary feeding method as the control group. Five young geese for the experiment were just right.

After confirming the prescription, Xia ruofei started a fire to brew the medicine.

Now, he was very familiar with brewing Chinese medicine. Even if he had to brew four different Chinese medicines at the same time, he could still handle it easily.

One by one, the herbs were placed into the claypot, and water was added to let it simmer.

Xia ruofei kept observing the four claypots and added one or two herbs from time to time. The process of brewing the medicine was orderly and busy.

After more than an hour, Xia ruofei had harvested four pots of Chinese medicine.

He thought for a moment, then left the medium in a flash. He found a bag of cornmeal in the kitchen of the small villa and put it into the medium as if it was a treasure.

Returning to the villa upstairs, Xia ruofei entered the medium and divided the bag of cornmeal into five portions. He poured four portions into four claypots and stirred them as he poured.

In a short while, four pots of flour paste were produced. They had the fragrance of corn and a hint of Chinese medicine. Xia ruofei did not know if the Strasburg geese would like to eat them, but the smell was a little strange to him.

As for the remaining cornmeal, Xia ruofei added water and mixed it into paste. This was the food for the young geese in the control group.

Xia ruofei pondered for a moment. He didn’t rush to find Xia Qing, but returned to the outside world.

He used the computer to create a form and printed out a few copies.

It was a comparison form. He had to divide the five young geese into five groups and mark them separately. Then, four of them would take the Chinese medicine flour paste he had prepared every day, and the remaining one would be fed according to the traditional method.

The comparison form was to fill in the eating and weight conditions of the five young geese every day.

Since it was an experiment, Xia ruofei wanted to be as careful as possible to get the most accurate results.

Xia ruofei took the form from the printer and grabbed a carbon pen from the pen holder. He then returned to the space.

“Xia Qing!” Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to communicate with Xia Qing.”Are the five geese ready?”

“Master, I’ve been hungry for an entire day!” Xia Qing said,”it looks like they’re about to faint from hunger. They’ll probably be able to eat anything we give them!”

“Very good!” Xia ruofei said,”bring them to the cave in the mountain sea realm.”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing said.

Xia ruofei also walked out of the cave. The five claypots swayed and floated in a straight line behind him. They followed him.

A word was pasted on each of the five claypots, which were 12345.

The reason why they didn’t use Arabic numbers was that the experiment was mainly done by Xia Qing. It was easier for Xia Qing to recognize Chinese characters.

After a short while, Xia Qing came to the front of the cave with a bamboo cage. Inside the bamboo cage were the five young Strasburg geese.

Xia ruofei didn’t rush Xia Qing to release the young goose, but said to Xia Qing,””Xia Qing, in the next few days, you have to spare some energy to help me complete an experiment!”

“No problem! Master, give me your orders!” Xia Qing said without the slightest hesitation.

Xia ruofei pointed at the five claypots on the ground and said,””There are five types of food here. In a while, give the young geese their corresponding numbers. You will feed them every day. I will tell you how to prepare the food. What you need to do is to use the time flow of the Archean realm to speed up the progress of the experiment. You have to record every feeding. The form is here. You just have to fill it out according to the requirements.”

Xia ruofei then handed the form and pen to Xia Qing.

The comparison table was very simple, and Xia Qing understood it easily. However, the carbon water pen made him feel very fresh. This pen was very different from a writing brush, but it wrote very smoothly.

“No problem!” He nodded. Master, just leave it to me!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I will give you four prescriptions. You will decoct the Chinese medicine according to the prescriptions and mix it with the cornmeal to make paste. Give it to goose number one to four separately. For goose number five, eat the cornmeal directly without adding anything else!”

After he finished speaking, Xia ruofei handed four pieces of paper to Xia Qing.

These four prescriptions were actually two prescriptions, but because the proportion of medicinal materials had been adjusted, it could be said that each of them had two prescriptions.

There was also a number on each prescription paper, from “one” to “four,” which corresponded to the claypots one to four today. It could be said that it was clear at a glance. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Xia Qing took a look at the prescription and the refining method, and then put them into her cufflinks. She nodded and said,””Yes, Master. The brewing method is very simple. I can definitely complete it!”

Xia ruofei nodded with satisfaction.”Hmm, then I’ll leave this experiment to you!”

Then, Xia ruofei said,”okay, let’s start feeding!” Let’s catch one!”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing said.

Then, he deftly grabbed a young goose from the bamboo cage.

Xia ruofei smiled.”We have to give it a mark. Otherwise, it’ll be confused.”

With that, Xia ruofei took the young goose. He gathered a trace of true Qi in his hand and drew a line on the body of the young goose. Yellow fur fell down and the Arabic number ‘ 1’ appeared on the body of the young goose.

Xia ruofei said to Xia Qing,”remember, this represents one!” Let it eat the food in claypot number one!”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing said.

Then, he grabbed the young goose and took the number one claypot to the side.

Next, Xia ruofei followed the same pattern and marked the five young geese.

These young geese were obviously famished. When they smelled the corn paste, they immediately couldn’t wait to eat.

Although four of the pots of corn paste had the smell of Chinese medicine, they still ate it and finished it in a short time.

Xia Qing caught them one by one and locked them in the bamboo cage.

Xia ruofei said,”Xia Qing, find a place in the Archean realm and raise them separately. The place doesn’t need to be too big, but it shouldn’t be too cramped either. At least, it should allow them to move around normally.” After that, you will brew the medicine at the mountain and sea realm. Every time you need to feed it, go to the Archean realm. This way, you can make use of the time flow to complete the experiment as quickly as possible. ”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing said.

Xia ruofei reminded them again,”you must keep them separately. Also, don’t mix up the five groups!” Otherwise, the experiment data would be inaccurate!”
