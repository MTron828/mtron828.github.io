Chapter 1747: Xia ruofei’s request (1)

When Lu Yifan heard this, his eyes revealed a strange look. Zhao Yongjun had clearly not told him about this beforehand.

After a moment of shock, Lu Yifan immediately reached out his hand to Xia ruofei and said with a smile,””President Xia, I’ll be looking forward to your guidance in our future cooperation!”

Xia ruofei smiled and shook Lu Yifan’s hand.””I wouldn’t dare to give you any advice, but CEO Lu is the professional! As long as CEO Lu doesn’t find me annoying!”

Lu Yifan quickly replied,”I wouldn’t dare!” Our customer’s satisfaction is our main aim!”

Zhao Yongjun said from the side,”ruofei, Yifan’s an old friend of mine, and he’s also one of the top designers in the industry. He was once nominated for the Liang Sicheng award!” His architectural firm is one of the best in the country!”

“Sir,” Lu Yifan replied humbly,”I was just a sidekick that time. I’m still far from winning the award ...”

Zhao Yongjun laughed,”you have to be qualified to be a runner!” How many architects are there in the country? The fact that you were able to get into the final ten nomination list is a Testament to your abilities!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be secretly surprised. Even if he was ignorant and ill – informed, he knew that the Liang Sicheng award was the highest award in Chinese architectural design. Even if he didn’t win the final award, he must be very capable to be able to make it into the top ten.

Moreover, it was said that to receive the title of this award, not only did one have to have outstanding work and have sufficient qualifications, but one also had to win some international awards. This meant that Lu Yifan had won international awards before, but these awards were not as prestigious as the Liang Sicheng award, so Zhao Yongjun didn’t mention it.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but size Lu Yifan up. He looked more like a businessman than a designer.

Xia ruofei said to himself,”you really can’t judge a book by its cover!”

“CEO Lu, being too humble is being too proud!” Xia ruofei said half – jokingly,”you’re not allowed to hold back on this project! Help us with the design!”

“Of course!” Lu Yifan replied. I wouldn’t dare to not put in any effort for the matter of the general even if you lend me a few guts! President Xia, don’t worry! I’ve already placed this case as my top priority!”

“Hahaha! Then we’ll have to thank you in advance, CEO Lu!” Xia ruofei said happily.

While everyone was exchanging pleasantries, song Rui seemed to be a little uneasy and kept looking into the distance.

Seeing this, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but ask,””Song Rui, what’s the situation?”

“I’m waiting for Zhuo Yiyi!”Song Rui replied. Why aren’t they here yet?”

“Zhuo Yiyi? What is she doing here?” Xia ruofei asked curiously.

Song Rui said unhappily,”you brat, do you forget things?” Didn’t you personally hire her as a consultant?”

Xia ruofei patted his head and smiled.””I’ve been so busy that I’m confused. ”

The last time they had a gathering in the courtyard house, Zhuo Yiyi had mentioned that the rent was too expensive and that she was looking for someone to share it with. At that time, Xia ruofei was at his lowest and joked that it was not a bad idea to co – Rent with someone of the opposite sex. He did not expect that Zhuo Yiyi would really be tempted.

Song Rui was about to go crazy. Xia ruofei had to rack his brains to make up for it. In the end, he thought of a way to hire Zhuo Yiyi as their consultant. She was mainly in charge of checking on the antique buildings and cultural relics in the design plan to prevent the situation from becoming a joke.

At that time, Xia ruofei had just wanted to find an excuse to increase Zhuo Yiyi’s income so that she would not have to find someone to share the apartment with. Hence, he had quickly forgotten about it.

Xia ruofei looked at song Rui and said,””You deserve to be single for life! Since you’ve already called her here, why didn’t you pick her up this morning? You’re really something to let a girl travel such a long distance alone!”

Song Rui complained,”you really think I’m a noob!” You don’t even know this? Zhuo Yiyi said that her unit was having a team building event near little Tang town yesterday, so she stayed here last night. She said that she could come over by herself in the morning!”

Xia ruofei rolled his eyes and said,”Even if she lives in the hot spring Villa next door, we still have to pick her up! This was a matter of attitude! Forget it, forget it, I’m going to be infuriated to death by talking to you, you blockhead ...”

Song Rui scratched his head and asked weakly,””Should I contact her now and pick her up? Can I borrow your car?”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”Zhuo Yiyi must be on her way. She might even be here soon. Why are you asking to pick her up at this time?” Wouldn’t that be even more insincere?”

“Damn ... This won’t do, that won’t do ...” Song Rui didn’t know what to do.

Xia ruofei said unhappily,”you can wait here slowly!” When Zhuo Yiyi comes, you have to put in a good word for her. But it’s also very likely that she’s not angry at all, and that she’s just delayed by some matters ...”

Speaking of which, with Zhuo Yiyi’s carefree personality, the latter was more likely.

After Xia ruofei finished speaking, he didn’t pay any more attention to song Rui. He quickened his pace and caught up with Zhao Yongjun, Lu Yifan, and the others. Liu Jian, Xu Zixuan, and the others also patted song Rui’s shoulder and quickly followed. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Song Rui was left alone, looking into the distance.

The staff that Lu Yifan had brought with him had already spread out with the instruments. They would conduct a precise survey of the entire plot of land. This data would be stored in their professional computers. Then, Lu Yifan would gradually form a design plan based on the shape of the entire plot of land, the height of the terrain, the orientation, and many other factors.
