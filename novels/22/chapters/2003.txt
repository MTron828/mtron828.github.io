2004 Meeting but not knowing each other (2)

The Mafia members rushed to the car park and chased after the cars.

There was still some distance between the cars behind them, and Monica looked at the masked man in shock.

She looked at the masked man who was driving at a high speed attentively, and then called out in a trembling voice,Xia!

The masked man drove at high speed through a sharp turn. His drift was almost perfect. When the car entered a straight road, he quickly turned to look at Monica, then continued to stare at the road and hold the steering wheel tightly.

The masked man asked in English,You know me

Monica was very excited. As soon as the masked man appeared, she had a very familiar feeling. Whether it was his movements or his figure, they were very similar to the Oriental man she had been deeply engraved in her heart.

Is it really you Monica said agitatedly,God ... This is unbelievable. Xia, how did you suddenly appear here Is this really God’s will

While driving, the masked man said indifferently,I don’t know why you’re so excited, but I think ... You must have mistaken me for someone else!

After saying that, he reached out and took off the headscarf covering his face.

Monica’s ecstatic expression instantly froze Yingying’s face. This was a completely unfamiliar face. He wasn’t the man she had been thinking about day and night.

Although many Europeans and Americans felt that Easterners looked similar, just like how Chinese people looked at foreigners, it was difficult to tell the difference. However, Monica was different.

When she saw other Chinese people, she might not be able to tell them apart, but she would never mistake Xia ruofei for someone else. Xia ruofei’s appearance had long been engraved in her mind.

The young man in front of him was not Xia ruofei.

From a huge surprise to a huge loss, Monica’s mood was like a roller coaster. She squeezed out a smile and said,I’m sorry, I got it wrong ... Sir, thank you for saving me today ...

The masked man was Xia ruofei. However, Monica could not recognize him after he had changed his appearance.

In fact, Monica’s intuition was quite accurate when he was covering his face. This feeling was very mysterious and could only be felt by two very close people.

However, when Xia ruofei took off the headscarf covering his face, Monica naturally overturned her previous judgment. After all, Xia ruofei’s method of changing his appearance was too magical. Even his temperament was completely different from before. Monica would never have thought that her previous judgment was correct.

Sometimes, what the eyes see might not be the truth. Instead, the first feeling was more accurate.

In fact, Xia ruofei had already hidden outside the villa before Monica.

When he saw Monica get out of the car, his heart ached.

At that time, Xia ruofei thought to himself,did Monica finally choose to compromise Perhaps this wasn’t a compromise and she was willing to do it

Because at that moment, Xia ruofei saw Monica smiling at Toles.

Xia ruofei was all too familiar with this smile. Every time he was with Monica, this smile would make him lose all his resistance. The temptation of this smile was amazing.

However, Xia ruofei was a cultivator after all. He quickly noticed the blade that even The Woman in Black who was searching the body did not notice.

At this moment, Toles was about to go over and hold Monica’s shoulder. Monica raised her hand, and the reflection of her razor blade woke Xia ruofei up.

Without any hesitation, he shot out like lightning. Before Monica could make a move, he used his mind power to snatch the razor and slit Toles ‘throat.

Until now, Xia ruofei still felt guilty for his short hesitation.

When Monica called out his name, his heart trembled even more, and he couldn’t wait to reveal his identity.

But Xia ruofei knew that he could not do that.

His real identity was too sensitive. He had such a big company behind him and so many employees. If he was involved in such a vicious case, too many people would be affected.

Besides, Xia ruofei did not want Monica to be implicated. Naturally, it was better for him to know as little as possible. He even hid it from Monica so that he could be as safe as possible. In the future, even if there was a lie detector in front of Monica or a high – Level hypnosis, only Xia ruofei’s current appearance would be revealed.

Hence, when he saw Monica’s dejected look, Xia ruofei’s heart ached but he still hardened his heart and did not reveal his true identity.

Monica couldn’t help but look at Xia ruofei again. If she didn’t look at his face, she really felt that the man in front of her was the Chinese man who had left an unforgettable impression on her.

Monica suddenly thought of something and couldn’t help but ask,Sir, when I called you Xia just now, you seemed to have asked me ‘do you know me’ in return.

I’m Xia Tian, Chinese,Xia ruofei replied indifferently. This lady, I have yet to ask for your name!

Xia Tian ... Monica repeatedly chewed on the name and could not help but be secretly amazed.

She thought to herself,his surname is also Xia and he’s also from Huaxia. What a coincidence!

Hey! Did you hear what I said Could he have fallen asleep

When she heard Xia ruofei’s voice, Monica finally came back to her senses. She quickly apologized,I’m sorry, I was a little distracted just now ... Hello, Mr. Xia, my name is Monica Grao, you can call me Monica!

Hello, Monica! Xia ruofei nodded.

Monica explained again.I just thought of one of my Chinese friends. That’s why I was distracted. I’m really sorry!

Hearing this, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but have a mischievous thought. He smiled and asked,Do I look like your Chinese friend

Monica turned to look at Xia ruofei and said seriously,He’s the same as you, his surname is Xia ... You two ... How should I put it He doesn’t look like him at all, but there seems to be a very similar quality. I don’t know the details, but I just thought you were him ...

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded,really There’s such a magical thing How about you introduce me to him when you have the chance

No problem! I believe that you two will become very good friends! Monica said without hesitation.

Then, Monica couldn’t help but ask curiously,Mr. Xia, why did you appear at Toles ‘villa and save me

Xia ruofei said calmly as he drove,I appeared at Toles ‘villa to kill him. As for the reason, I think it’s better for you not to know. Saving you ... Was just in passing! I saw the blade in your fingers. The enemy of my enemy is my friend. We Chinese believe that it’s fate to meet each other. Since we met, I took the opportunity to bring you out of there, that’s all!

It’s just convenient! Monica muttered.

Even though she had already confirmed that this Xia and the Xia in her heart were not the same person, the magical thing was that Monica still felt a faint sense of loss.

Xia ruofei glanced at the rearview mirror and asked,Monica, are there any more questions

No more! Monica blurted out.

Since there’s no problem, fasten your seat belt and sit tight! He said. Xia ruofei said.

As soon as he said that, Monica suddenly felt the car speed up again. She was caught off guard by the strong push.

After fastening her seat belt in a hurry, Monica realized that the car lights behind her were a little dazzling.

The safety features of the Mercedes – Benz were quite good, but this kind of car from the original factory, which had not been modified, was obviously at a disadvantage compared to the off – road vehicles of the underworld. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m
