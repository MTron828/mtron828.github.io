Chapter 470: Chapter 390 – clash of eight characters (2)

Qin Xiao Yu snorted and looked at Xia ruofei,””You have nothing to say now that you’ve hit someone on the street! You’ll be sentenced to many years in prison for injuring someone so badly ...”

After that, Qin Xiaoyu instructed the police officer beside her,””Handcuff him and take him away!”

These days, Qin Xiao Yu had been leading the team to carry out the task of eliminating the underworld and evil. She was a little proud that Xia ruofei had bumped into her today.

She had always been unhappy with Xia ruofei. She felt that Xia ruofei was too brutal in the previous incident. Although the other party was a bunch of scumbags, it was a little too cruel to cripple a few of them in one move.

However, Tian Huilan had personally come out to protect Xia ruofei. Furthermore, Xia ruofei had also made a move to save Lu You. Qin Xiao Yu had no way to disobey the order and could only pinch her nose and let Xia ruofei go.

However, it was different today. Xia ruofei had committed a crime on the street and was caught red – handed by the police.

Qin Xiao Yu thought to herself,’under the high pressure of fighting the underworld and getting rid of evil, aunt Tian can’t possibly help him when he is caught red – handed by the police!’ Hmph! Let’s see how you’re going to be smug this time.

At this moment, the sense of justice in officer Qin’s heart was bursting, as if the noble feeling of maintaining social peace was quietly growing ...

Xia ruofei did not wait for the police to take a step and said,””Officer Qin, don’t you think you’ve come to a conclusion too early?”

The corner of Qin Xiao Yu’s mouth curled up slightly and she said lightly,””You’ve seriously injured someone. We’ve seen your illegal behavior with our own eyes. Do you have anything to say?”

Qin Xiao Yu thought to herself, let’s see what else you have to say? It was useless to say anything! Weren’t you so smug last time? Beg me ...

At the thought of this, Qin Xiao Yu felt her cheeks heat up again. What the hell was this! Do you think I’ll let him go if he begs me?

This was impossible! I’m the embodiment of justice, police officer Qin, who is both beautiful and intelligent! Qin Xiao Yu quickly affirmed her thoughts.

Xia ruofei didn’t know what Qin Xiao Yu was thinking. He only said calmly,””Officer Qin, as a law – abiding citizen, I’m sorry for the police’s reckless judgment ...”

At this point, Xia ruofei revealed a wronged expression and said,””I’m clearly fighting against the most vicious of criminals, but you’re not giving me a chance to explain yourself by saying that you want to arrest me. Can I take it that you’re biased against me?”

Xia ruofei did not even explain that Zhao he had followed him and attacked him. There were no surveillance cameras in this remote alley. He could not explain himself even if he had a mouth.

However, to be seen by Qin Xiao Yu in such a place, Xia ruofei could not help but complain in his heart, he really had a bad luck with this beautiful policewoman!

Of course, Xia ruofei was not lying. Zhao he’s murderous aura was so obvious that Xia ruofei did not believe that this guy did not have a case. It was not a lie to say that he had fought with the criminals.

Qin Xiao Yu was both angry and amused, saying: “”Fighting with criminals? You sure have a glib tongue ... I only saw you cruelly break his legs when he lost the ability to resist ...”

Before Qin Xiaoyu could finish her sentence, Xia ruofei suddenly raised his hand without looking back. A cold light flashed, and Zhao he, who was behind him, suddenly screamed.

Qin Xiao Yu was shocked, she took a closer look and found that Zhao he’s palm had been pierced by a sharp military dagger, blood was oozing out quickly ...

Qin Xiao Yu’s expression changed and she rebuked sternly: “”Xia ruofei! What are you doing? He was too lawless! Da Jun, Qiang, hurry up and handcuff him!”

Xia ruofei pouted and said,””Officer Qin, you’d better take a look at what the poor victim was about to take out before you carry out the law!”

Zhao he’s face was ashen. He had lost all hope ...

Qin Xiao Yu looked at Xia ruofei suspiciously and gestured to the police officer beside her to go forward and check.

The two Criminal Police officers walked forward carefully. They realized that Zhao he’s hand that was pierced by the dagger must have reached into his clothes. However, when he was halfway through, Xia ruofei threw the dagger at him as if he had eyes on the back of his head.

One of the police officers stood guard with a gun in his hand, while the other reached his hand into Zhao he’s clothes. His face changed and he shouted,””Captain Qin, it’s a gun!”

Qin Xiao Yu’s expression changed when she saw the criminal Police officer taking out a standard military pistol from Zhao he’s arms. The two police officers behind her also became nervous, they took out their guns and surrounded Zhao he who had lost his ability to resist.

A bitter smile appeared on Zhao he’s face as he stared at Xia ruofei with hatred.

In fact, Xia ruofei’s guess was right. Zhao he was indeed a wanted criminal who had taken several lives. So when Qin Xiaoyu appeared with the police, Zhao he was already disheartened and had long harbored the mentality of a life and death struggle.

After all, even if he was a victim, he still had to take a statement and have his identity verified. Moreover, he had a gun with him. He had been too arrogant just now and thought that Xia ruofei was just an ordinary person. He did not expect that he had made a mistake and was beaten up by Xia ruofei like a dead dog. He would never have the chance to use this gun again. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

After the police appeared, Zhao he’s gun would not be able to be hidden. Once his identity was verified, it would be enough to shoot him a few times. So, he had no intention to live anymore. He wanted to take out his gun secretly while Xia ruofei was talking to Qin Xiaoyu. As long as he could kill Xia ruofei, he would be satisfied.

He really hated Xia ruofei. If he could really kill or cripple Xia ruofei, he would have completed young master Liang’s orders. Even if he was caught and shot dead, at least young master Liang would take care of his family.

Zhao he had no feelings for his parents and brothers, whom he had not contacted for more than ten years. However, he had an illegitimate child with a prostitute a few years ago, and it became his only connection in the world.

All of this prompted him to take the risk and pull out his gun to attack Xia ruofei in front of four or five policemen. Even if he was shot dead by the police the next moment, he would accept it.

However, he did not expect Xia ruofei to react so quickly. It was as if he had eyes on the back of his head. His speed had once again exceeded his understanding of human limits. When the shiny military dagger pierced through his palm, he was stunned for a moment before he let out a scream ...

Zhao he did not resist and allowed the police to twist his hands behind his back and handcuff him.

Qin Xiao Yu also stood in a daze for a long time. She looked at Xia ruofei with a complicated expression and then ordered,””Da Jun, immediately verify this person’s identity!”

“Yes, Captain Qin!” The Army replied with some excitement.

The city was in full swing with the operation to crack down on the underworld and evil. Many small Rascals and ruffians had been arrested, but there were not many major gun – related cases. This was an unexpected harvest, and the police were very excited.

Da Jun quickly took a picture of Zhao he and sent it back to the Bureau. At the same time, he took out his portable fingerprint collection device and prepared to collect Zhao he’s fingerprints. If Zhao he had a criminal record, the fingerprints would be found immediately. Even if he did not have a criminal record, there were not many A – Class wanted criminals. It would not be too much work to compare them with photos.

The results should be out soon.

Qin Xiao Yu also asked the police to call the ambulance. Even if Zhao he was a murderer, he was still seriously injured and had the right to receive treatment.

Xia ruofei looked at the excited and busy Qin Xiao Yu and said with a faint smile,””Officer Qin, can I leave now?”

Qin Xiaoyu was stunned for a moment. She rolled her eyes a few times and then looked at the shocking military dagger in Zhao he’s palm. She suddenly smiled.

“Xia ruofei, you can leave now. However, we might need to record your statement later. I hope you can cooperate.” Qin Xiao Yu said, then pointed to the military dagger and said,”since you’ve helped us, I won’t pursue the matter of you privately possessing a controlled knife, but we’ll be confiscating this dagger, you can understand ...”

Xia ruofei’s expression changed, and he smiled bitterly.
