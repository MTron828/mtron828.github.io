Translator: 5496903Ling Qingxue smiled at Song Wei and said to Xia ruofei,””Ruofei, it seems that the quality of your fans this year is very high!”

Xia ruofei glanced at Ling Qingxue and said,””Don’t say that ... I’m not a celebrity, why would I have fans!”

“Director Xia, you’re really not worse than those young hunks!” Deputy Director Wei quickly said. I see that my daughter has joined your Tieba and group. Oh! They’re called the fan club ...”

Ling Qingxue burst out laughing and said,””It seems like the culture of the fan club is deeply rooted in people’s hearts ...”

It was the first time Xia ruofei had encountered such a situation. He had met his fans before, but it was a little awkward to meet his fan’s father.

He thought for a moment and said,”director Wei, since we’re fated to meet, I’ll give your daughter a small gift!” It’s just a small token of my appreciation to her for supporting me!”

Deputy Director Wei looked happy when he heard this and said,””Can I really? President Xia, if I really bring your gift back to my daughter, I’m sure my status in the family will rise! Hahaha ...”

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but laugh when they heard this. They covered their mouths and laughed.

Xia ruofei always carried a small satchel with him. He pondered for a while and reached into the satchel. Then, he took out a set of beautifully packaged jaded skin ointment. It was a high – end jaded bone ice Skin Series.

In addition to the skin code series, which sold only 300 bottles a year and cost as much as 150000 euros, the jaded skin cream was sold in three grades: the 588 – Yuan Snow series, the 1888 – Yuan congealing fat series, and the 3888 – Yuan jaded ice Skin Series.

Xia ruofei had kept some of his company’s best products in his personal space so that he could use them whenever he needed them.

Although there was no limit to the three grades of Jade skin cream sold normally, because of its excellent effect and its explosive reputation, and the production capacity of the pharmaceutical factory had always been unable to keep up with the demand, they still needed to Pre – Order and rush up.

The scalpers on the idlefish platform increased the price. Even the price of the snow series could be raised to 1500 – 1600, which was basically three times the price.

The lesser in quantity, the cream Series and the most expensive Jade bone ice Skin Series, were even more difficult to buy.

Hence, Xia ruofei’s Jade skin cream was a very good gift.

Perhaps it was his daughter’s influence, but Deputy Director Wei obviously knew about the Paradise corporation’s well – known fist product. He glanced at the four artistic words ‘Jade bone ice skin’ floating on the packaging box and couldn’t help but Twitch his eyelids. He quickly said,”President Xia, you can’t do this! This gift is too expensive, I can’t accept it!”

He had heard from his daughter yesterday that the Jade bone ice skin was worth more than ten thousand Yuan on idle fish.

Although he was the Deputy Director of the supercomputer Center, he was still a bit reluctant to spend tens of thousands of Yuan on a set of cosmetics for his wife and child.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it’s our company’s own product. We don’t need to spend money. It’s not expensive at all.” Deputy Director Wei, besides ... I’m giving this to your daughter, not you. How can you help her reject it?”

Before Deputy Director Wei could react, Xia ruofei said,””I seem to have registered a Tieba account too, and I’m even an Honorary Moderator! If you don’t accept it, I’ll just post on Tieba and say that the Deputy Director of the Supercomputing Center, Wei, is a clean – cut guy. He firmly rejected the set of Jade skin cream I asked him to give to his daughter. I think ... Your daughter should be on that Tieba often, right? If she sees ...” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Don ‘t!” Deputy Director Wei quickly said,”President Xia, you’re checkmating me! If you really do that, my daughter won’t even let me into the house ...”

Xia ruofei looked at Deputy Director Wei with a smile and didn’t speak.

Deputy Director Wei smiled bitterly and said,””I’ll take it! I’ll accept it, alright? President Xia, I’m convinced! No wonder so many fans like you. You’re too good to your fans ...”

Xia ruofei laughed. He was about to hand the jaded skin ointment to Deputy Director Wei, but he thought about it and took it back. He asked,”By the way, Deputy Director Wei, what’s your daughter’s name? I’ll write her a few words! Isn’t that more meaningful?”

“Yes, yes, yes!” Deputy Director Wei quickly said,”President Xia, in front of my daughter, your words are more important than mine! Oh ... My daughter’s name is Wei Xue! Snow as in snow!”

Xia ruofei nodded. He took out a pen from his bag and tore open the outer layer of the jaded skin ointment. After opening the lid, he found a card in the box.

This beautifully printed card had the picture and text introduction of the product. At the same time, there was also a lot of blank space reserved. If it was a gift to someone, it was just enough to write some words of blessing.

“President Xia, this way, please!” Deputy Director Wei quickly said. This way, please! Sit down and write!”

Deputy Director Wei led Xia ruofei to the long bench at the side of the hall and sat down.

Xia ruofei took the pen and wrote down a line of words in a flamboyant manner.

Wei Xue:

I hope you can study hard and become a useful talent for society. I wish you all the best in your future life!
