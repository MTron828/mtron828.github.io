2117 Goose – raising plan.2

“Alright!” Xue Jinshan replied.

Xia ruofei continued.”I was talking about work for the future. There are still a few things that I have to complete now.”

Hearing this, Xue Jinshan and Cao tieshu immediately perked up and listened carefully to Xia ruofei’s assignment.

Xia ruofei didn’t assign any tasks immediately. Instead, he asked,””Kanayama, are the production line resources at the pharmaceutical factory tight?”

“The jaded skin cream and heart – nourishing soup are both in short supply,” said Xue Jinshan. “Besides the regular maintenance, our production line is basically in operation 24 hours a day, with three shifts. Of course I’m nervous, otherwise I wouldn’t have rushed to report to urge the construction of the branch factory ...”

Xia ruofei nodded and asked,”if I need to use a production line to produce other drugs, will the impact be huge?” It might not be a long – term use, but it needs to be used once in a while. ”

Xue Jinshan thought for a moment and said,”Chairman, there will definitely be an impact. After all, the production line is constantly producing Jade skin cream and heart nourishing soup. Both of them are money! “Moreover, if we change to producing other drugs, it’s not as simple as turning it on and shutting it down. First, there must be a set of automatic control processes, you know more about this than me ... In addition, for example, if we were producing the jaded skin cream before, the production line must be thoroughly cleaned, otherwise it may pollute the new drug. When we change to producing the jaded skin cream again, it must also be thoroughly cleaned ...”

Xia ruofei nodded.”That’s true ... But for the sake of the farm’s work, it’s acceptable for the factory to be affected a little.”

“Ah?” Xue Jinshan didn’t understand.”What does this have to do with the farm?”

Xia ruofei said,”to breed the Strasburg goose, we need a special Chinese medicine preparation. This involves trade secrets. We can’t entrust the production to other manufacturers. We can only solve it ourselves.”

“If that’s the case, then our pharmaceutical factory will fully support you!” Xue Jinshan immediately said. Even if we set up a production line to produce this potion, there wouldn’t be any problems!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it seems Kanayama has a high level of awareness!” However, there was no need for the pharmaceutical factory to make such a huge sacrifice. We’ll only carry out small – scale experimental breeding in the early stage, so the demand for Chinese medicine preparation is not high. We’ll find a time to stop the production line, thoroughly clean it, and then produce a batch of it and put it in the cold storage. Even if it’s affected, it’ll only be used once. ”

Xue Jinshan nodded and said,”sure!” However, you’ll have to personally control the process. ”

Now, the control process of the heart – nourishing soup and jaded skin ointment was written by Xia ruofei on the computer according to the method of brewing these two medicines. Even Xue Jinshan himself was not clear about the specific steps.

He might know what ingredients to put in first, what ingredients to put in later, and other external processes. After all, a more skilled worker would understand after working for a period of time. However, Xia ruofei was the only one who knew the details of the internal fusion, the specific temperature, and the precise time.

After the process was written, it was sealed together and even a self – destruction program was added. Once someone broke it by force, the data inside would be destroyed.

This was also the best way to ensure trade secrets.

“Of course,” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

“Chairman, it’s not a problem to solve the problem in the early stage, but if we want to do large – scale breeding in the future, we’ll definitely need to use the production line,” Xue Jinshan continued.

“Haven’t we already started the construction of our pharmaceutical factory’s branch?”Xia ruofei smiled. This is what I’m thinking. When the time comes, I’ll set up a production line dedicated to producing this kind of Chinese medicine preparation. Its Usage Frequency will definitely not be as high as the production line of the jaded skin cream. When it’s not in use, it can be used as a backup or a rotation! “If it’s really not possible, we can order an additional production line. I think the territory of the branch factory is big enough, so it’s definitely not a problem to add an additional production line. This way, it won’t affect your previous plans.”

Xue Jinshan’s face broke into a smile and said,”This is good! This is good!”

“Then get ready as soon as possible,” Xia ruofei said.”I’ll write the control program in two days.”

“Alright!” Xue Jinshan said.

Xia ruofei then said to Cao tieshu,””Big brother Cao, in addition to preparing for the recruitment in advance, we also need to conduct a month or two of experimental breeding, so we need to find a suitable place and find a professional to take charge of it.”

“Alright!” Cao tieshu quickly said. He then asked,”Chairman, how big is the place?”

Xia ruofei said,”it doesn’t need to be too big. At most, I can raise six or seven!” And it’s a free – range method. ”

The main purpose of this experimental breeding was to verify whether the quality of foie gras could be maintained at a higher level in the outside world. Hence, it did not need to be done on a large scale. This time, there were not many Strasburg geese imported. Xia ruofei still needed them to breed more breeding geese in the Archean realm as soon as possible!

Cao tieshu thought for a moment and said,”then I’ll put it under the hillside of the orchard!” There’s an open space over there. I’ll get someone to fence it in the next two days. In addition, if you want to raise the geese, you have to dig a pond ...”

The villagers definitely knew a little about raising chickens, ducks, and geese.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sure!” You can arrange all these. When you need money, just get me to sign the form and go to the finance department to withdraw the money. ”

“Alright!” Cao tieshu said,”Chairman, I’ve thought about it. I think I should take responsibility! I don’t feel at ease leaving it to others. ”

“You still have to manage the farm, do you have enough energy?” Xia ruofei asked.

“It’s fine!” Cao tieshu smiled and said,”I don’t have any specific work to do now. It’s all done by the workers. Leave the goose – raising matter to me!” I’ll find another worker to take turns keeping watch at night. ”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”okay!” If you’re on duty at night, remember to pay for the overtime ...”

“No need, Chairman. My salary is already high enough ...” Cao tieshu quickly replied.

“We have to take the money we deserve!” Xia ruofei said,”besides, aren’t you going to get someone to take turns keeping watch with you? If you don’t get overtime pay, how will others get it? This matter is settled. ”

“Alright then!” Cao tieshu said,”thank you, Chairman!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”that’s enough. I’m just getting paid according to my work. There’s no need to be so polite.” Today’s main things are these, you guys go do it separately! Is there anything else you’re not clear about?” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“No more!” Xue Jinshan and Cao tieshu responded in unison.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” Then, he had to push this matter forward as soon as possible! If you have any questions, you can report to me directly!”

“Alright!”

“Understood!”

Xue Jinshan and Cao tieshu went off to complete their own tasks. Xia ruofei returned to the study in the small villa and started drawing on a piece of paper.

He wrote down the prescription that he had finally decided on and then began to design the process of mass production.

The prescription was not complicated. The production process was much simpler than that of the heart – nourishing soup and jaded skin ointment. Xia ruofei quickly broke down the general steps.

In order to mass produce on an automated production line, the design of the steps was the most important.

After a few modifications, the overall structure and steps became clearer. Xia ruofei looked at it once and felt that there were no more problems. He then stuffed the piece of paper into the small shredder and memorized the contents.

After that, he entered the space and picked six young geese to continue breeding in the mountain and sea realm. He then had Xia Qing place the remaining young geese in the Archean realm and raise them.

Xia ruofei told Xia Qing to feed the geese with the normal method without adding any Chinese medicine. The only task for the geese was to reproduce as much as possible and expand the population.

Xia ruofei did not want to import a large batch of young geese just to build a farm. Not only was it a waste of money, but the import procedures of living things were too complicated, especially the Inspection and Quarantine process.

It’s better to do it himself and have enough food and clothing!
