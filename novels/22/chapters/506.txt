Chapter 507: The new Drunken Eight Immortals (1)

After Xia ruofei said that, Liu Qian and the rest temporarily forgot about their awkwardness and nervousness. They looked at Feng Rao with anticipation.

Feng Rao looked at Liu Qian and the rest indifferently before she said to Xia ruofei,””Chairman, I’ve already made the preliminary list of candidates, but I haven’t had time to report it to you yet, so ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.””I’ve said it before. You’re in charge of the recruitment. You just have to decide on it.”

Xia ruofei then pointed at Liu Qian and said,””She came from another city for the interview. If she’s accepted, she doesn’t have to go to the city to find a hotel. Since you’ve already drawn up the list, just tell her the results!”

“Alright,” he said. Feng Jing nodded.

“You’re Liu Qian, right?”she asked.

“Yes, President Feng ...” Liu Qian’s heart thumped as she looked at Feng Jing with anticipation and nervousness.

“Before I tell you the result, I have another question to ask you,” Feng Jing said with a faint smile.

“Please speak.” Liu Qian said immediately.

“If you work at paradise Corporation, can you accept overtime and business trips?” Feng Rao asked indifferently.

“No problem!” Liu Qian said without hesitation,”as long as the company needs it, I can do it no matter how hard it is!”

Feng Jing nodded.”Then, congratulations. You’ve been hired by our paradise Corporation as the General Manager’s assistant. Is that a problem?”

Feng Jing had a good impression of Liu Qian during the interview. She was well – mannered in all aspects, and it was obvious that she had a good personality. For a general assistant position that required strong coordination skills, affinity and execution were very important. Hence, Feng Jing was prepared to test Liu Qian’s capabilities as the assistant manager.

Liu Qian was surprised and happy. She said excitedly,”No problem! No problem! Thank you, President Feng! Can I start work today?”

Feng Rao smiled and nodded. “I’ll get someone to arrange an apartment for you in a while. Also, I’ll go through the employment procedures. You’ll start work this afternoon!”

“Yes! Thank you for your trust, director Feng!” Liu Qian said happily.

She had come to the interview with the intention of giving it a try. She didn’t expect to be hired, and it was the most valuable position among all the positions, the General Manager’s assistant position. This was really a surprise for her.

Liu Qian then smiled sweetly at Xia ruofei and said,””And thank you, Chairman!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”why are you thanking me?” I didn’t interfere with the recruitment this time. It’s because CEO Feng thinks highly of you that he hired you. ”

“No matter what, I still have to thank you!” Liu Qian said, a little embarrassed. She was recalling the scene just now.

The other three young men also looked at Feng Jing with anticipation, but they were too embarrassed to ask.

Girls were often given special treatment, just like how the chairman had personally asked about Liu Qian’s situation just now, but the three men didn’t receive this treatment.

Feng Rao glanced at the three of them and said,””Chen Rong and Zhao Xiaofei were also hired.”

“That’s great! Thank you, director Feng!” The young man in the gray down jacket called out happily. It was not known whether he was Chen Rong or Zhao Xiaofei.

Feng Jing had only interacted with them briefly during the interview, but she was able to call out everyone’s name. This made Xia ruofei look at her in a new light.

Feng Rao looked at the young man with the middle – parted hair and said,””Dong Liang, I’m sorry, but our company might not have a suitable position for you at the moment ...”

Dong Liang, the middle hair man, lowered his head and said,”I understand, CEO Feng. I won’t disturb you any longer. I hope that I have the opportunity to work at your company in the future ...”

After saying that, Dong Liang was not in the mood to say hello to Liu Qian and the others. He lowered his head and left, leaving four people behind. He was the only one who was not hired, and his heart was full of frustration.

Liu Qian and the others didn’t know each other before this, so they didn’t feel much about Dong Liang’s failure. They just looked at him with sympathy, but it was quickly replaced by excitement.

The young man in the grey down jacket said to Xia ruofei,””Chairman, my name is Zhao Xiaofei. We were blind just now. Please don’t take offense!”

Xia ruofei smiled gently and said,””Ignorance is not a crime. Besides, you didn’t offend me in any way! Weren’t you just giving me, this late interviewee, some ideas?”

Liu Qian and the other two laughed in embarrassment.

Zhao Xiaofei hesitated and asked again,”Chairman, can we ... Also enjoy the company’s apartment?”

Xia ruofeihe chuckled.”According to the company’s rules, the local employees can’t enjoy a full apartment. However, we can provide a shared dormitory for you to use during your lunch break. Of course, you can also spend the night.”

“A dormitory is fine too!” Zhao Xiaofei said happily,”otherwise, if we come to work from the city every day, not only will it waste time on the road, but it will also be difficult to bear the fuel cost!”

Feng Rao knew that Xia ruofei must have something to tell her, so she said,””Go to the Finance Office and look for director pang. Ask him to arrange accommodation for you! I’ll go through the employment procedures during work hours in the afternoon!”

“Yes, President Feng!”

Liu Qian and the other two went to look for pang Hao happily. Feng Jing smiled at Xia ruofei and said,””Chairman, what are your instructions?”
