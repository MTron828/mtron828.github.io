3001 A successful curtain call (3)

Xia ruofei also stood up and said with a smile,””We should go too.”

“Yes!” Luo Qingfeng said quickly.

Then, he bid farewell to Hao Qingsong on behalf of the star Seizer sect.

Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng walked out of the private room together and happened to see some cultivators coming out of their private rooms in twos and threes. Those who had participated in the auction and even had grudges with them would not choose to leave their private rooms at this time if they did not want to expose their identities. Those who came out now naturally did not care if others knew which room they were in.

Xia ruofei was like this because he had already revealed his identity.

Wu Ming and his group were in the same situation. They walked out of the box.

Wu Ming noticed Xia ruofei immediately. His eyes flickered as he looked at Xia ruofei with ill intentions.

During the auction of the five sacred badges, Xia ruofei had only bid 110000 spiritual stones and did not make any more bids. To be honest, Wu Ming was feeling a little regretful as he looked at the outcome he had hoped to see the most. Naturally, it was for the star Seizer sect to bid for the spirit stone, and then he would kill Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng on the way. This way, not only the five sacred writs, but also the ring of the flying Phoenix that he had been longing for, and even the mysterious ore that had made him resentful, would all be his.

However, Wu Ming did not expect that Xia ruofei, who had been so powerful when he was up against him, would actually give up after just one bid.

Wu Ming watched helplessly as the five – Saint token fell into the hands of the heavenly sect. No matter how fierce he was, he knew that he had no fate with the five – Saint token.

However, Wu Ming was still concerned about the pair of storage rings that Xia ruofei had obtained. Thus, when he heard Luo Qingfeng’s loud farewell, he immediately called Luo Feng out and walked out of the private room with him.

Since the star Seizer sect’s people were not attending the banquet, Wu Ming had to chase after them as soon as possible. Otherwise, it would be difficult to stop them if they lost track of them. After all, Luo Qingfeng was an Aurous core stage cultivator. It would not be a problem for him to bring Xia ruofei along on his flying sword.

By then, the sky would be vast, and cultivators wouldn’t have a fixed route like airplanes, so they wouldn’t be able to find them.

Luo Feng naturally knew what Wu Ming was thinking, but he didn’t stop Youyou from not getting the five Saints badge this time. It could still be said that it was not a crime of war. As long as Wu Tiancheng knew the final price, he would definitely not kill him. However, during the auction, the spirit Vulture mountain had repeatedly suffered losses at the hands of the star Seizer sect, and had even lost an inexplicable bet, losing 50000 spirit stones. This was not a small stain on their reputation.

If they could really kill Luo Qingfeng and Xia ruofei and snatch the storage ring and the mysterious ore, they might even get the formula for the Chi – amassing pill and the fire cloud pill. It would be great if they could get the formula, as it would be a great achievement. Even if they only got the ring of the flying Phoenix and the mysterious ore, it would be enough to make up for their previous mistakes.

Therefore, even though Luo Feng tried to persuade Wu Ming, his actions showed that he supported Wu Ming.

Wu Ming and Luo Feng followed Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng from a distance without making a sound as they walked toward the exit of the auction hall.

However, they quickly stopped in their tracks when they saw Chen Xuan with another golden core elder of the first heaven society and a Qi refining disciple. They were coming from the opposite side of the tunnel and walking straight towards Xia ruofei.

Wu Ming stopped immediately. He exchanged a glance with Luo Feng and then quietly moved closer, hoping to hear their conversation.

With a warm smile on his face, Chen Xuan replied,””Brother Xia! Let’s go! I’ll send you back to the star Seizer sect!”

Xia ruofei didn’t argue with him. This was what Chen Xuan had agreed to when he borrowed the spiritual stones. This was also the “interest” that Chen Xuan had given him in addition to the quota to explore the secret of the five sages.

When Wu Ming and Luo Feng heard this, they could not help but feel a chill in their hearts. They could see the disappointment in each other’s eyes. If Chen Xuan and Xia ruofei were to travel together, they would have no hope of intercepting and killing them.

Even if they had the strength to kill him, they wouldn’t dare to.

As long as the news got out, they would face the destructive attack of the first heaven society. Even though the lingjue mountain was powerful, they would be annihilated by the first heaven society, who was extremely angry.

At this time, another forthright laugh rang out,””Fellow Daoist Chen! Little brother Xia, this old man is here!”

Wu Ming and Luo Feng looked over and saw that it was the sect leader of the surging waves sect, Mu Sheng, who had also brought mu Hua and mu Jianfei over.

“Fellow Daoist Chen, did little brother Xia tell you everything?” Mu Sheng asked with a laugh.

Chen Xuan nodded his head with a smile. “We’ve already come to an agreement. ”

“Hahaha! Then I’ll have to trouble fellow Daoist Chen this time!” Mu Sheng said happily.

“You’re too kind, sect leader mu!” “Since everyone’s here, let’s set off!” Chen Xuan chuckled.

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said.

The group walked out of the auction house while talking and laughing, and walked towards the elevator to the Kongtong hotel, which was located in the city. Although it was already night time, cultivators couldn’t just fly out of the hotel entrance on their flying swords! Therefore, they usually chose to take the elevator to the top floor, and then fly from the rooftop. With some small barriers, it was enough to hide from the secular world.

Wu Ming and Luo Feng didn’t even take a step forward. The disappointment in their eyes turned into despair.

“Uncle Feng, what’s our next step?” Wu Ming asked in confusion.

Luo Feng smiled bitterly,”what else can we do?” Young sect leader, just give up! Chen Xuan and Mu Sheng will personally escort that brat back. Even if our strength doubles, we still won’t be their match. Don’t forget that there’s still Luo Qingfeng. Don’t look at how weak he is, he’s also a ruthless character!”

“Mm ...” Wu Ming nodded and said,”why don’t ... We stay here for now and go to the banquet to take a look? we might be able to find some good treasures!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Luo Feng also didn’t want to go back dejectedly. If they really found a good treasure at the banquet, Wu Tiancheng might be lenient and not punish them according to the mountain Rules.

“Alright, let’s go to the banquet hall then ...” Luo Feng nodded.
