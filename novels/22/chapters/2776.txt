2777 Chapter 1514: the great Tang! Smooth progress_1

“No problem! Let’s go to the study!” Song Qiming said.

The two of them went to song Qiming’s study room. He carefully took out the spiritual crystal that Xia ruofei had given him from the safe.

Xia ruofei released his spiritual power to sense it. He realized that the spiritual Qi contained in the spiritual crystal was not consumed much. With song Qiming’s current strength, he could not absorb much spiritual Qi even if he cultivated without sleep or rest. Moreover, he strictly followed Xia ruofei’s request and cultivated for more than an hour a day, so the consumption was even less.

Song Qiming gave Xia ruofei a questioning look. Xia ruofei nodded slightly and said,””Uncle song, let’s start!”

Song Qiming nodded and sat down with his legs crossed. He held the spiritual crystal in his hand and started to operate the mental cultivation method of the “modest Heart Sutra” according to the meridian circulation route that Xia ruofei had taught him.

Xia ruofei was observing with his spiritual power. He could clearly feel a suction force from song Qiming’s palm. The spiritual Qi in the spiritual crystal was being drawn out and circulated along the meridians of the first level of the “modest Sutra”.

In a short while, song Qiming had completed one circulation of the technique.

Xia ruofei nodded to himself. He could tell that song Qiming had put in a lot of effort. Song Qiming was very skilled when he was cultivating, and there was no mistake in the circulation route of the spiritual Qi.

Although Xia ruofei did not stop him, song Qiming only completed two cycles of the Qi before he stopped. He only wanted Xia ruofei to check if there were any mistakes in his cultivation. He could not just keep on cultivating while Xia ruofei waited.

“RUO Fei, how is it?” Song Qiming let out a breath of air and asked.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded,”very good!” Uncle song, it looks like you’ve completely mastered this set of Qi cultivation techniques. As for the changes you mentioned, they were indeed caused by practicing this set of Qi cultivation techniques, and these are all normal effects. You don’t have to worry at all!”

“That’s good. ” Song Qiming heaved a sigh of relief.

During this period of time, he had been practicing this set of “health maintenance method”. The effect was so amazing that he felt a little uneasy in his heart. He was afraid that he had practiced it wrong. If there were any hidden dangers, his old bones, which had just been seriously injured, could not withstand the torment.

Now that he had Xia ruofei’s personal “verification”, it meant that there was no problem with his training. The effect of this set of health – Maintenance methods was just that great. He immediately calmed down and felt a sense of joy that came from the bottom of his heart.

“RUO Fei, I really don’t know how to thank you.” Song Qiming said sincerely,”a health – Maintenance method with such good effects must be very precious! I’m so grateful that you’ve taught me this!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”uncle song, this is just the beginning of the practice. As long as you stick to it, you will have even bigger surprises in the future! Didn’t I tell you last time? If you persist in practicing this set of health – Maintenance methods, not only will the hidden dangers in your body be eliminated, but you’ll also be able to live a long life. You should believe me now, right?”

“I do!” Song Qiming smiled. He believed in him! RUO Fei, I’ve never doubted your words!”

Then, song Qiming seemed to hesitate for a moment before he asked in embarrassment,””Ruofei, there’s something ...”

“Uncle song, just tell me what you need!” Xia ruofei replied readily,”you don’t have to be so polite with me!”

“I ... I was thinking ... Since this set of health – Maintenance exercises is so effective, can I teach it to your aunt Fang so that she can practice with me?” song Qiming asked. Of course, if there are any taboos, then forget it. I’m just asking. ”

Xia ruofei could not help but laugh. He could tell that song Qiming and Fang Liyun were very close. The effect of this cultivation technique was so good that song Qiming could not help but think of his wife.

However, while the idea was beautiful, reality did not allow it.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”uncle song, aunty Fang can’t practice this set of health – Maintenance methods.” Of course, this isn’t a taboo or anything like ‘secret techniques’. It’s just that this set of health – Maintenance techniques was specially selected by me according to uncle song’s physique, and it’s only suitable for you to practice. Even if other people practice according to this method, there won’t be any effect. If there are no special circumstances, they won’t even be able to get started. ”

Xia ruofei paused and continued,””Of course, you can let aunt Fang try it on. It’s okay. However, you must be mentally prepared. I’m afraid that there’s a high possibility that there won’t be any effect. ”

Song Qiming could not help but feel disappointed. He said,””Then there’s no need to try. Of course I believe you ...” He said.

He felt that it was a pity. After practicing this “health maintenance”, song Qiming felt that not only did he become stronger, but his body also became tougher. The gastric problems and mild high blood pressure that he had before had disappeared. On the other hand, Fang Liyun was already at a certain age and had some chronic diseases. It was a pity that such a good health – Maintenance method was not suitable for her.

Xia ruofei could read song Qiming’s mind. He smiled and said,””Uncle song, don’t worry. Although this set of health exercises may not be suitable for aunt Fang, I will find a way to find one suitable for her. By then, she will naturally be able to practice it, but it will take some time.”

Song Qiming was overjoyed and said,”that’s great!” RUO Fei, I’ll leave this matter to you!”

“You’re welcome. I’ll try my best, but I need some patience.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

He had originally planned to wait until he had a certain level of strength before leading the people close to him on the path of cultivation. He did not expect to have any major breakthroughs in cultivation, but it would be good if they could live to a hundred years old. Song Qiming and Fang Liyun were Song Wei’s parents. Naturally, they were on the list of people he would teach.

However, Fang Liyun’s body was not suitable for cultivation and she was getting older. Xia ruofei did not have any way to help her cultivate. Even if she used the heart – concentrating grass, there was a chance of success. The price to pay was higher. Xia ruofei had not considered this plan yet.

“Alright!” Song Qiming nodded. Alright! There’s no hurry for this!”

Xia ruofei continued.”Oh, right. Uncle song, I’m flying to the capital tomorrow. If you and Auntie Fang have anything for Song Wei, you can pass it to me later.”

Song Qiming smiled and said,”Weiwei doesn’t lack anything in Beijing. I’ll ask your aunt Fang later!” Weiwei really misses her mother’s special fried bun, but it’s not easy to bring along ...”

Xia ruofei laughed.”Don’t worry about the security check. I’m using the private passage for the public jet. As long as there’s time, you can prepare!” I promise I’ll deliver it to Song Wei as soon as possible!”

Song Qiming was slightly stunned. He smiled and said,””I almost forgot that you’re a little nouveau riche! Alright! Then I’ll go and tell your aunt Fang, please wait a moment! Have some tea!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said.

As expected, when Fang Liyun heard that Xia ruofei could help them bring things to Song Wei, she immediately decided to make the fried buns that she was best at and was also Song Wei’s favorite.

Fang Liyun was happily busy in the kitchen while Xia ruofei and song Qiming went to the living room and chatted while making tea.

Fortunately, the filling was ready. Otherwise, it would have taken a long time to finish. Fang Liyun had planned to make some fried buns for song Qiming the next day, but now, song Qiming was no longer in luck.

Fang Liyun finally finished cooking the fried buns at around nineo’ clock in the evening. There were about forty to fifty of them, filling a big bag. She even thoughtfully packed another small bag and passed it to Xia ruofei. She smiled and said,””Ruofei, this is for you. Try my cooking!”

Xia ruofei took the bag and said with a smile,””Then I’ll accept it. Thank you, Auntie! I’ll put these fried buns in the fridge when I get back. Don’t worry about it during the flight tomorrow. There’s a fridge on the plane too. I promise they’ll still be fresh when I send them to Song Wei!”

“Then I’ll have to trouble you!” The person in the room said with a smile.

It was getting late, and song Qiming and Fang Liyun had to rest. Song Qiming’s cultivation was fine, but he still needed some time to break through to refined Qi Level 2. Xia ruofei did not need to give him any more guidance for the time being. So, after Xia ruofei took the fried buns, he immediately got up and left, driving back to the jiangbin villa community.

Ling Qingxue was too embarrassed to stay the night, so she went home the moment Xia ruofei left. The villa was quiet.

Xia ruofei placed the fried buns into the refrigerator. As for the small bag that Fang Liyun gave him, he would just treat it as supper.

He went upstairs to his bedroom, locked the door and windows, and took out the spirit map scroll. He went into the medium to cultivate for a few hours.

By now, nearly half of the true Qi in his body had been converted into primordial Qi. Every time he cultivated, he could see his own progress, which was a pretty good feeling.

When Xia ruofei finished his cultivation and came out of the spirit map space, it was already past two in the morning.

In fact, even if he didn’t sleep all night, it wouldn’t affect him much. Moreover, ever since he started cultivating, the quality of his sleep had always been very good. Even if he only rested for three to four hours, it was a high – Quality deep sleep. The effect was better than the average person who slept for eight hours.

Xia ruofei heated up the pan – fried buns that Fang Liyun had given him and ate them while browsing the news on his phone. Then, he went to wash up and went to bed.

The next morning, Xia ruofei dragged a small suitcase that was completely used for decoration and took a car to the airport with Ling Qingxue.

Considering that the trip might take a long time, Xia ruofei did not choose to drive to the airport by himself. Instead, he asked Lei Hu to arrange for a company’s Mercedes – Benz car to come.

It was the weekend, so there wasn’t much traffic on the road. In less than 50 minutes, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue arrived at the airport in their Mercedes – Benz.

...

Xia ruofei brought Ling Qingxue along with him. After going through a simple security check in the business jet building, they walked straight to the landing strip where paradise was parked.

Liu An’s crew had already made preparations for take – off. Although it was a short flight, Xia ruofei still allowed the three pilots to fly together because they might have to fly directly from the capital to Peach Blossom Island. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

After Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue boarded the plane, paradise was quickly permitted to taxi – in. It slowly glided to the runway and waited for a while. The tower then informed them that paradise could take off.

After accelerating and gliding, paradise drew a beautiful flight path and leaped into the blue sky.
