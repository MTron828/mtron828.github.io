After having breakfast at Ling Xiaotian’s house, Xia ruofei got up and left. Ling Xiaotian was also very busy. The Lingyun hotel Under Ling Ji F & B was competing for the target of being a designated reception unit of the municipal Party Committee. Their F & B business was also developing into the secondary market. At the same time, the acquisition of Ding Feng winery had been put on the agenda. He was also in a hurry to go to the company to deal with complicated matters, so he did not ask Xia ruofei to stay. Xia ruofei drove back to Taoyuan farm. After his routine visit to the greenhouse and the construction site, Xia ruofei went back to his room. After locking the doors and windows and drawing the curtains, Xia ruofei took out the spiritual map and entered the medium. He first checked the status of the Hornets in the new space and tried again. He found that he could now control about 20 Hornets. Although it was only a small improvement, Xia ruofei was still very happy. Xia ruofei played with Blackie and the rest for a while. After checking their food supplies, he went to the original space. The 20 stalks of iron – Skin dendrobe he had found at laoyan mountain a few days ago were all packed in plastic bags. Xia ruofei was planning to plant them today. Before this, Xia ruofei had searched for relevant information on the internet. The cutting planting technique of the iron – skinned Dendrobium was not complicated. All he needed to do was cut the old stem into sections every two or three sprouts, and then proceed with the cutting. In the outside world, the incision might need to be disinfected and there were other things to take note of. However, in an environment like the spirit map space, Xia ruofei basically did not need to consider so much. He took out a military dagger and cut the iron – Skin Dendrobium he had collected into small strips. Each iron – Skin dendrobe had six or seven long old stems, and each old stem could be cut into seven or eight sections. Therefore, after processing all 20 iron – Skin dendrobes, Xia ruofei had obtained nearly 1000 stalks. He first threw the ears into the sorting box, then poured in the diluted flower petal solution to soak them. During the soaking process, Xia ruofei went to the place where he had planted the vegetables. Now, most of the vegetable field was empty. There were wicker baskets stacked beside the vegetable field. These were the vegetables that Xia ruofei usually picked to meet his daily supply. Xia ruofei used the hoe to turn the vegetable field around and then walked over with the sorting box. He inserted the tassels into the vegetable field one by one. After planting vegetables for so long, his movements were very skilled. It didn’t take long for him to plant all 1000 – plus tassels into the field. Next, Xia ruofei took out a watering can and filled the space pond with water, thoroughly watering the iron – skinned Dendrobium. In the end, Xia ruofei even filled a pot with diluted flower petal solution and poured a little on each ear. After two hours, Xia ruofei was done with the planting of the ironclad claustrophobia. He was very confident in the spirit map space and was certain that the iron – Skin dendrobes would not disappoint him. They would all survive. Xia ruofei packed up his tools and left the spirit map space. He went to the bathroom to wash the dirt off his hands. Then, he took out his phone and habitually checked that he usually didn’t bring his phone into the spirit map space. There were no missed calls or text messages, but there was a WeChat message. Xia ruofei opened his WeChat. It was from Wu Liqian, the deputy head of Changping County. She had not been in contact with Xia ruofei for a while. “Little Xia, you’re getting stronger and stronger!” He added a speechless emoji at the end of his sentence. Xia ruofei was confused and replied with a string of question marks. Wu Liqian replied quickly. This time, she didn’t send anything, only a link. Xia ruofei clicked on the link with a hint of curiosity. This link was actually a piece of news that had just been posted on the official websites of the Sanshan Commission for Discipline Inspection and the special Inspector Bureau. The title was “Lin Wanshui, the Deputy Secretary General of the three mountains Municipal Party Committee, is under investigation for serious violation of discipline and law.” The content of the message was very simple. The Deputy Secretary General of the three mountains Municipal Party Committee, Lin Wanshui (at the current position), is suspected of serious violation of discipline and law. He is currently under investigation. Behind it was Lin Wanshui’s resume. Secretary Tian was so fast! Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be a little speechless. However, he knew that Lin Wanshui himself was definitely not clean. He knew Tian Huilan quite well. If Lin Wanshui only violated the rules and didn’t break the red line of the law, Tian Huilan would definitely not have fabricated evidence and directly caused him to fall from his position. Xia ruofei just didn’t expect Wu Liqian to be so well – informed. She actually knew that he was the one who had caused this. So he replied with a blushing emoji and then typed: “Sis Wu, it’s his own butt that’s not clean! nozuonodie!” Wu Liqian replied,”it’s all your fault!” You’re the nemesis of all the officials!” Wu Liqian had personally experienced it once. Last time at the Linhai town police station, Xia ruofei had caused a ruckus and sent the Deputy Director of the county Public Security Bureau and the director of the police station to prison. This time, Lin Wanshui would not be able to escape either. According to what Wu Liqian knew, the investigators had already found out that Lin Wanshui had used his position to benefit others and received a large amount of bribes through his family and children. It was said that the amount of money involved in the case was close to ten million. Moreover, the information consulting company opened by Lin Wanshui’s son, Lin Feng, was also found to have a lot of problems, including false invoices, tax evasion, forged contracts, and so on. In fact, Lin Feng’s company was an important channel for Lin Wanshui to receive benefits. The investigators had already taken coercive measures against Lin Wanshui and his son, and they would soon be sent to the legal authorities. That’s why Wu Liqian was so emotional. Xia ruofei was in a good mood. He took out a cigarette and lit it up. Then, he chuckled and sent a message to correct her.”Sis Wu, please mind your words! If you say that I’m the nemesis of corrupt officials, I can still reluctantly accept it ...” “You ... I’m telling you, young Xiao was also scared out of his wits this time!” Wu Liqian replied. Xiao Mei had called Wu Liqian after the incident and asked her some questions humbly. That was how Wu Liqian had found out about the incident that Xia ruofei had caused a few days ago. Xiao Mei had wanted to ask about Xia ruofei the most, so she had told Wu Liqian everything about her low – Level mistake. “Hahaha! Secretary Xiao was obviously not as capable as sis Wu! But I don’t blame her!” Xia ruofei replied. “She told me. She also said that if it wasn’t for you speaking up for her, she might have become the shortest – serving Secretary in the history of the municipal Party Committee!” Wu Liqian replied. Wu Liqian probably didn’t have any important work to do at the moment, so the two of them started chatting on WeChat. Xia ruofei thought for a while and sent a message.””Sis Wu, you promised to come over to my place on the first day of the new year. Why haven’t you come after so many days of work?” “I’ll go in a few days! However, he’s either inspecting and guiding them as the deputy head of the county, or just hanging out with them as friends. ” Wu Liqian replied. Xia ruofei smiled and typed on his phone,””Sure! Bring brother – in – Law with you, I’ll treat you guys to a real rural tourism experience!” “I guess you’ll have to wait a few years ...” “What’s wrong?” “I’m not married yet! Where are you going to find a brother – in – Law!”
