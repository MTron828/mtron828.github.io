Translator: 549690339

The heart – nourishing soup had officially entered the public’s attention. A few reports that were not too off – topic were even reposted by some authoritative websites, including China Medical Network and China Traditional Chinese Medicine network, which had the Wei family planning Commission’s backing.

News reports about Xia ruofei had also been posted on national platforms like Weibo and Tianya.

Speaking of which, Xia ruofei had to rely on Feng Jing’s fame. Her fan base,”static”, was at its peak. Any news about Feng Jing would be directed to “static” ‘s exclusive Tieba, Weibo, WeChat, forums, and so on.

There were several photos of Feng Jing sitting beside Xia ruofei in the news that day. Moreover, one of them was the chairman while the other was the General Manager. Naturally, the fans would pay attention to them. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Fortunately, autism wasn’t a terminal disease like cancer or aids. The public’s understanding of this disease wasn’t that high. Even though society had been paying more attention to it in recent years, most people’s understanding of autism was still very shallow.

For example, some people only thought that people with autism were geniuses in one aspect. These were all influenced by movies. In fact, these strange geniuses were only a small category of people with autism, called “Asperger’s Syndrome.” This type of patient’s condition was generally not very impressive, with only a slight social barrier.

However, the vast majority of people with autism actually had serious social and language barriers, as well as problems such as rigid and repetitive behavior.

It was also because of the lack of social awareness that the news of the heart – nourishing soup did not become a particularly hot topic.

Of course, within the professional field and among the parents of those with autism, this was explosive news. However, it was still a small group.

Furthermore, Xia ruofei was not as beautiful as Feng Jing and did not have a natural advantage. Therefore, although the news reports and photos about him attracted a lot of discussion and posts, they were not as impressive as Feng Jing’s Weibo trending topics.

Of course, Xia ruofei was happy to see such a situation.

He didn’t want to be someone living under the spotlight, so he tried to keep a low profile during this time.

Paradise Farm’s Christmas promotion also ended smoothly. In three days, their sales exceeded 280 million Australian dollars, much more than the target that Liang Qichao had set at the time.

More importantly, Paradise Farm’s brand was completely established in Australia, establishing the farm’s position in the high – end vegetable field.

After the end of the Christmas promotion, Paradise Farm’s high – end vegetables in Maya supermarket also returned to their original prices. The average selling price was about 30 Australian dollars, far higher than ordinary vegetables, but the sales had been very good. These vegetables, which looked good and tasted great, were deeply loved by the middle – Class, and the brand’s popularity was also growing day by day.

Even Grandpa Tang He called Xia ruofei personally to discuss the next development strategy of Paradise Farm. At the same time, he also suggested that Xia ruofei cooperate with him to acquire more farms and expand the planting area.

However, Xia ruofei still politely declined.

On the one hand, he did not want to invest more energy in overseas for the time being and was still preparing to delve deep into the domestic market. On the other hand, even if they wanted to enter the overseas market on a large scale, Xia ruofei was only willing to let the Paradise Corporation invest alone.

Paradise Farm was a special case, and he didn’t want his Overseas Development to follow this model in the future.

Tang He had roughly guessed Xia ruofei’s thoughts last time, so he was not too disappointed. He just smiled and said that if Xia ruofei had the intention to finance or seek cooperation partners, he would be the first one to consider.

Naturally, Xia ruofei would agree to such a verbal favor without any cost.

Liang Qichao quickly sent over the seed requirements for the next few months. He led his team to re – adjust the planting structure of Paradise Farm to ensure that there was a steady stream of seasonal vegetables produced every month. The key to the sustainable development of Paradise Farm lay in the seeds, which could be said to be the lifeblood of the farm.

Xia ruofei also attached great importance to this overseas money – sucking behemoth. He immediately contacted the seed company and began to order the seeds according to Liang Qichao’s request.

Xia ruofei had always been in charge of the seeds.

The seeds he ordered were also sent to his warehouse in the city. After all the seeds were processed in the spirit map space, Xia ruofei would let the company handle the relevant procedures and fly the seeds to Australia by air.

During the weekend, Xia ruofei also invited Jiang Liangyu and he kun for a meal. During the meal, Xia ruofei gritted his teeth and frequently toasted Jiang Liangyu.

Jiang Liangyu, who was also from the military, had a good tolerance for alcohol. However, he couldn’t stand Xia ruofei, who used his true energy to cheat, and drank a lot. In the end, he was carried back by the Secretary, drunk.

Jiang Liangyu had been too careless. As a Deputy – Level leader, few people dared to force him to drink like this. Who knew that Xia ruofei did not care about his status at all and started beating him up. Before Jiang Liangyu could come back to his senses, he was already drunk.

Once a person entered a state of drunkenness, they basically didn’t need anyone to persuade them to drink. They would find wine to drink on their own. They would even have to argue with others if they wanted them to drink less.

Therefore, Jiang Liangyu was drunk without any suspense.

He kun, who did not go on stage to speak that day, escaped. Although he was also drunk, he did not get drunk.
