2603 A new plan (2)

Of course, on Xia ruofei’s list, the Amethyst blood radish was not particularly valuable. Compared to the heart – concentrating grass, the Amethyst blood radish was much less valuable.

Furthermore, Xia ruofei had planted quite a few Amethyst blood radishes in that herb garden on the realm Heart Island. It was just that they had yet to mature.

Hence, after hearing the news, Xia ruofei was only slightly stunned. He asked,””Is there any way to get this Amethyst blood radish?”

Liu Qunfeng felt even more embarrassed. He said,””It’s very difficult ... The buyer isn’t Chinese, and they’re from a rich family in Malaysia. It’s hard to move them with money, and it’s hard for our influence to reach Malaysia, so ...”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”okay!” I know ...”

“How’s elder Liu’s current situation?”he asked.

“It’s all thanks to your miraculous hands of rejuvenation!” Liu Qunfeng quickly said,”my father’s condition has been stable for the past two days! But ... If I can’t find all the medicinal herbs on your list ...”

“I’ll go and take a look first!”Xia ruofei said noncommittally.

“Alright! Alright!” “This way, please!” Liu Qunfeng said.

The Deputy Minister personally led the way for Xia ruofei, and Liu Chongli, who was in charge of a family financial group, could not even get a word in.

Xia ruofei and the other two arrived at Mr. Liu’s ward. He didn’t even need to say anything. Liu Qunfeng asked the medical staff to leave as quickly as possible, and then he and Liu Chongli left the room.

Xia ruofei carefully checked on elder Liu’s condition and nodded to himself. The situation was as he had expected.

Although the old man was still in a coma, his condition did not continue to deteriorate in the past two or three days. The cancer cell activity in his body had obviously decreased a lot.

Of course, if he didn’t continue with the treatment, the pitifully small amount of spirit Heart Flower petals that old man Liu had taken a few days ago would be completely consumed and would no longer have any effect.

Xia ruofei pondered for a moment and took out the acupuncture kit from his bag. He first used the ‘nine needles of the rubbing cloud’ technique to treat him.

After the acupuncture was done, the silver needles still needed to stay in the body for a while. Xia ruofei stood up and walked out of the room.

“Mr. Xia!” Liu Qunfeng quickly came forward.

Xia ruofei said,”elder Liu’s condition is basically the same as what I expected. If he is not treated as soon as possible, his body will continue to deteriorate. In the end, even God can’t save him.”

“What if we continue to use the drug treatment from last time?” Liu Qunfeng asked with a hint of anticipation.

Xia ruofei shook his head.”It can’t cure the root of the problem. The treatment will only get worse. It’s not very meaningful.”

“Then what do we do?”

Even though Liu Qunfeng had been through a lot, he was still helpless in the face of today’s situation.

“I’ll tell you a plan for your reference!”Xia ruofei said after some thought.

“Please speak! Please speak!” Liu Qunfeng said, as if he had found a life – saving straw.

“I’m afraid it’s not realistic to find all the medicinal herbs on the list in a short time. ” Xia ruofei said calmly,”I’ve been thinking about an alternative prescription for the past two days. I finally have some ideas today ...”

“That’s great!” Liu Qunfeng couldn’t help but cry out in joy. It was as if he had seen a ray of hope.

However, he immediately realized that he had lost his composure. He revealed an awkward smile and said, “I’m sorry! Mr. Xia, please continue! Please continue ...”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I have to make two things clear to you.””First, this alternative prescription is not a fixed prescription. I modified it from the original prescription based on my own understanding of Chinese medicine. Therefore, the safety and treatment effects may be unknown, and there may be certain risks. Second, even if this prescription is right, the effect will definitely be worse than the previous pills. You have to be mentally prepared for a long battle!”

“Yes! Yes! Yes!” Liu Qunfeng said without hesitation,”as long as it can save my father’s life, we are willing to try!”

This was the reality of the situation. If he chose this plan, elder Liu would face a certain risk and a certain probability of failure. But if they didn’t choose this plan, the result would be doomed. The Liu family would lose old man Liu, the White jade pillar that held up the sky and the purple gold pillar that supported the sea.

Facing this reality, Liu Qunfeng knew what choice he should make.

Xia ruofei nodded and took out his phone to call Wu Qiang.

“Wu Qiang, bring me the thermal box that I left in the car. I’m on the second floor.” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

“Okay, boss!”

“Mr. Xia, I’ll get someone to get it!” Liu Qunfeng said.

“No need, let my driver send it over directly! “Don’t let anyone else do it in the middle, in case you can’t explain it clearly later ...”Xia ruofei said.

Liu Qunfeng couldn’t help but look a little embarrassed as he said,””Mr. Xia, we will definitely increase the management of our drugs in the future. What happened last time will never happen again!”

Xia ruofei smiled noncommittally and did not say anything.

They waited for two minutes before Wu Qiang came to the second floor with the thermal box. After he handed it to Xia ruofei, he went back to the car downstairs to wait for orders.

Xia ruofei walked towards old master Liu’s room with the thermal lunch box and said,””Chief Liu, you guys can come in too! Also, get a nurse to help!”

“Alright! Alright!” Liu Qunfeng quickly said, and at the same time, he gave Liu Chongli a look. Liu Chongli quickly ran to arrange for a nurse to help.

After entering the house, Xia ruofei asked the nurse to get a basin of hot water. Then, he put the frozen Chinese medicine bag into the hot water and heated the medicine soup through the vacuum – packed Chinese medicine bag. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

After heating it up for a while, Xia ruofei asked the nurse to take out the Chinese medicine bag and then asked her to find a brand new set of Disposable Infusion Set.

The nurse quickly hung the Chinese medicine bag on the bed and connected it to an infusion set.

Of course, he didn’t need to inject the medicine into elder Liu’s blood vessels. However, old man Liu was already connected to a ventilator. Hence, Xia ruofei used this method to let the Chinese medicine enter old man Liu’s stomach through an infusion set and a nasophobic tube.

The main reason why Xia ruofei chose to use an infusion set instead of taking it directly was to reduce the flow. At the same time, it could also allow the precious components of the spirit Heart Flower petals in Chinese medicine to come into contact with old man Liu as much as possible so that they would be completely absorbed.

Liu Qunfeng watched as the brown Medicine in the medicine bag dripped into his father’s body through the nasal feeding tube. His heart couldn’t help but hang in his throat.

Xia ruofei was very confident. He moved a chair and sat in front of the window. If it were not for the fact that there was a critical patient here, he would have taken out a cigarette.

Although he used the highest volume of the medicine, it still took him 40 minutes to get all the medicine into his stomach.

During this process, Liu Qunfeng and Liu Chongli were staring at old man Liu on the bed. Xia ruofei also scanned him with his spiritual power from time to time.

Although he had not come into direct contact with old master Liu, Xia ruofei had a general understanding of the situation.

This was enough for Xia ruofei.

Liu Qunfeng and the others could not see any changes, but after Xia ruofei used her spiritual power to check, she clearly found that as more and more Chinese medicine was injected into old man Liu’s body, the cancer cell activity in his body had suddenly decreased by an order of magnitude.

Actually, if Xia ruofei wanted to, he could even turn these cancer cells into ashes. It was just a matter of using a few more spirit Heart Flower petals.

...

On the contrary, in his current situation, controlling the speed of recovery felt much more technical. The difficulty was also not the same as using the heart condensing flower petals to heal directly in the past.

After drinking the bag of Chinese medicine, elder Liu’s face was much rosier.

Xia ruofei kept the silver needles, disinfected them, and put them away carefully. He said to Liu Qunfeng,”Minister Liu, please prepare a room for me! I’ll probably have to stay here for the next two days!”

“No problem! No problem!” Liu Qunfeng said, overjoyed.

It was great news for Liu Qunfeng that Xia ruofei could stay. At the very least, if there was an emergency, he would be able to find this “Divine Doctor” at the first moment, and his sense of security would increase a lot.
