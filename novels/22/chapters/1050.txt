“Xia Qing!” Xia ruofei’s spiritual will entered through the Spirit map. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing immediately replied respectfully.”Your subordinate is here, master!”

“Do you know the recipe for the elemental gathering pill?”

“Master, I do not have this formula.” Xia Qing replied in shame.

“It doesn’t matter. This prescription isn’t complicated.” Xia ruofei said indifferently,”note it down. 50g of Angelica, 50g of Angelica, 500g of angelica root ...”

Xia ruofei quickly told Xia Qing about the ingredients and the method of making the energy gathering pill.

Although this prescription had been lost in the current Traditional Chinese Medicine, it was not a complicated prescription. The preparation method was also quite simple. It could be made by normal decocting and refining honey into pills.

Therefore, after Xia Qing heard this, she immediately said,””Master, your subordinate will remember this!”

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”these commonly used herbs are all in the space. Immediately make 50 pills. I need them tomorrow.”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing replied.

After handing over the production of the gathering elemental pill to Xia Qing, Xia ruofei went online in his Room to Read the news related to the auction for a while before going to bed.

The next morning, Xia ruofei got up on time and sat cross – legged on the balcony of his bedroom to cultivate.

Midnight and 7:00 am were the time of the day when the spiritual Qi was the most active. On earth, where spiritual Qi was scarce, it could barely meet the requirements for cultivation. Hence, as long as there were no special circumstances, Xia ruofei would persist in cultivating every day.

Now, Xia ruofei could clearly feel the bottleneck of Qi disciple Level 4, so naturally, he would cultivate non – stop every day, hoping to break through to Qi disciple Level 5 as soon as possible.

He still remembered that he had a potential enemy who was suspected to be a Mystic. Although the possibility of him being exposed was very low, he had never let his guard down.

Since there were Mystic class Warriors, there might be higher level Warriors or even cultivators. Xia ruofei guessed that these people were just focused on cultivation and rarely came out. However, it was very likely that they would cross paths with this mysterious group in the future.

In the world of cultivators, strength was King.

Now that Xia ruofei had the ability, he would try his best to improve his strength. Only then would he be able to keep the initiative in his hands.

The spiritual Qi of heaven and earth trembled and gathered in Xia ruofei’s direction.

Unknowingly, his cultivation had also started to slowly increase.

Although this was a rather slow process, as long as he improved every day, it was only a matter of time before he broke through.

The balcony of the master bedroom faced Victoria Bay. As time passed, a red sun rose above the sea, and the sparkling sea was suddenly dyed with a layer of golden light.

Xia ruofei was completely oblivious to the beautiful scenery and was still cultivating with all his heart. He only stopped cultivating when he felt the spiritual Qi of heaven and earth become turbid and impure.

When he was cultivating, Xia ruofei noticed that the door on the other side of the Presidential Suite was open. Feng Rao had already left the suite.

However, Xia ruofei was cultivating and did not pay much attention to it.

Now that he was done with his cultivation, Xia ruofei went to take a shower and walked out of the master bedroom.

At this moment, Feng Jing pushed the door open and entered. After Yingluo confirmed that Feng Jing had moved in with her, Xia ruofei had asked the Butler of the Presidential Suite to bring a new room card for Feng Jing.

Feng Jing was wearing a tight sports tank top and a pair of tight – fitting pants, which revealed her snow – White waist. Her body was covered in a layer of sweat, and her hair was wet. Her face was also slightly flushed, and it was obvious that she had just come back from exercise.

“Good Morning!” Xia ruofei took the initiative to greet him.

Feng Jing didn’t expect Xia ruofei to wake up so early. She was usually dressed as a professional beauty in front of Xia ruofei. This was the first time she was dressed so skimpily, and she couldn’t help but feel a little uncomfortable.

“Good ... Good Morning, Chairman!” Feng Jing said with a red face.

Xia ruofei’s gaze swept past Feng Rao’s hot body and asked with a smile,””Did you exercise?”

“Yup! I went to the hotel’s gym to work out for a while. ” Feng ke said.

“Then hurry up and take a shower! Otherwise, you’ll catch a cold. ” Xia ruofei said,”Oh right, I’m about to order breakfast. What do you want to eat?”

Feng Rao’s heart warmed. She smiled at Xia ruofei and said,”Anything is fine. I’m not a picky eater. Chairman, you can decide!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Feng Rao greeted Xia ruofei and hurriedly returned to her room. Yingying’s cool outfit made Xia ruofei feel a little uncomfortable.

Xia ruofei ordered two sets of breakfast through the hotel’s internal phone.

After a while, the doorbell rang, and two waiters pushed the dining cart to deliver breakfast.

Although Xia ruofei only ordered two portions, the breakfast was very sumptuous and exquisite. It was probably enough for four people with ordinary appetites.

After the waiter served breakfast on the table, he bowed and left.

Soon, Feng Rao came out of the room. She had clearly just finished her bath as her hair was still wet. She had changed into a formal suit and her face was still slightly flushed, making her look even more beautiful.

Xia ruofei smiled and called Feng Jing over to eat.

After enjoying a sumptuous breakfast, Feng Jing said,””Chairman, I’ll go down first. The auction starts at 9:30 in the morning. I’ll go to the venue to see if there are any problems.”
