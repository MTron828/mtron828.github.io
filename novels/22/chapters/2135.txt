2136 Black Sam (1)

A distance of more than 1000 meters was not too far. However, the sea seemed to be at low tide at this time. Xia ruofei had to overcome the resistance from the island and was carrying a heavy backpack. Hence, it took him more than half an hour to feel that he was on solid ground.

He swam forward a little more, then stood up from the water and walked to the beach of the island.

Xia ruofei had been observing the situation on the island the moment they arrived.

There was a large beach on the side of the island where he landed.

The White and fine sand on the beach didn’t seem to have any traces of human activity. The blue sea, the White beach, and the lush tropical plants seemed to be completely unpolluted. The scenery here was better than the Maldives, Bali, and other tourist attractions.

Soon, Xia ruofei reached the beach. He sat down, opened his heavy backpack, and threw it on the beach. Yingying’s clothes were wet and stuck to her body. It was very uncomfortable. He had prepared a few sets of clothes in his backpack and was going to change into them.

Xia ruofei had prepared for the worst when he prepared the backpack. It was prepared in case the spiritual map scroll could not withstand the huge impact of the storm and caused the space to collapse. Therefore, it not only contained food, drinking water, GPS, satellite phone, change of clothes, salt, and some other daily necessities. It had everything.

Just as Xia ruofei was unzipping his waterproof backpack, he suddenly stopped and turned his head to look at a Bush not far away.

Xia ruofei heard a rustling sound and scanned with his spiritual power. He noticed a figure running towards him. He could vaguely sense that the figure was naked and there were some leaves around his lower body.

Xia ruofei mumbled to himself,”there’s still someone on this Island?” He looks like a Savage ...”

However, Xia ruofei did not care. Even if there were some savages on the island, they were not a threat to him. His combat ability was enough to deal with ordinary savages. Even if there were a lot of savages, he still had many guns in his storage space! When he was dealing with the Mafia families in Italy, he had kept many guns in his space.

In the face of firearms, the number of primitive barbarians was meaningless.

Xia ruofei didn’t pay any attention to the excited white fox. Instead, he slowly changed into a set of dry clothes and put the wet clothes into the medium. He asked Xia Qing to hang the clothes on a tree to dry.

Then, Xia ruofei checked the items in his backpack.

The backpack was extremely waterproof, and he hadn’t been in the water for a long time, so the inside of the backpack was still very dry. The food, drinking water, maritime satellite phone, and other equipment were all intact.

Xia ruofei casually placed the food, drinks, and condiments on the beach. Then, he turned on his handheld GPS, hoping to locate his position first and see how far he had deviated from the flight route he had set.

Although there were 100 tons of fuel stored in the realm, Xia ruofei still needed to plan carefully to ensure that there was enough fuel for the return trip.

However, after he turned on the GPS, he couldn’t find any satellite signal.

Xia ruofei was dumbfounded. How could this be? There was almost no cover around the island, and the GPS didn’t correspond to a particular satellite. It couldn’t be that there were no satellites above the island at this moment, right? The probability of this happening should be very low.

Xia ruofei did not want to give up and changed direction. He waited for another two to three minutes, but the GPS was still searching for signals. He could not find a single satellite.

“What the ... What’s going on?” Xia ruofei muttered to himself.

He turned on the maritime satellite phone again, but the satellite phone also had no signal. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

This place seemed to be isolated from the world ...

Just as Xia ruofei was still trying to figure it out, he heard a flurry of footsteps.

Xia ruofei frowned. He put down the GPS and the maritime satellite phone, then turned to look.

A group of people rushed out of the bushes behind the beach. There were about a dozen of them.

This group of people were all wearing simple skirts made of tree leaves. One or two of them had tree bark around their waists. All of them were sallow and emaciated. They stared at the instant noodles, compressed biscuits, mineral water, and other things that Xia ruofei had casually thrown on the beach. Their eyes were shining with desire.

Some of these people were holding wooden Spears, while others were carrying very simple bows and arrows on their backs. They looked like the indigenous savages on the island.

Xia ruofei slowly put the items he had taken out into his backpack. The savages saw Xia ruofei’s actions and could not help but make a commotion. However, they did not act rashly and only stared at Xia ruofei.

Unless it was absolutely necessary, Xia ruofei did not want to hurt these savages. Even on a deserted island, Xia ruofei did not want his hands to be stained with blood. As for food and water, he had a mountain of them in his interspace. He did not mind giving these savages a little.

“Put the things down! From the moment you set foot on Sam Island, everything on you, including yourself, has become my personal property!” An unruly voice was heard, speaking English.
