Chapter 443: Immortals from all walks of life (2)

“Mr. Xia,” Feng Yun continued,”our Chairman said that the bangle is for your girlfriend. You can’t possibly reject this too, right?”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”Manager Feng, please thank Chairman MA on my behalf. I’ll accept the gift.”

“Alright,” he said.

Xia ruofei gestured for pang Hao to lead Feng Yun to the guest area and take her seat. Then, he turned to look at the middle – aged man who had just gotten out of the Mercedes – Benz behind them.

When Xia ruofei and Feng Yun were talking, this middle – aged man had been waiting at the side with a smile and did not look impatient at all.

Before Xia ruofei could ask, the middle – aged man introduced himself,””Hello, Mr. Xia! I’m the United States of shengbang Corporation in China, Zhou Qing. ”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment before he reacted.

Isn’t shengbang Corporation the company of elder Tang in the United States?

“So it’s CEO Zhou, nice to meet you!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Zhou Qing had a warm smile on his face and said,””Mr. Xia, I’m here today on behalf of the head office’s Chairman, Mr. Tang He, to congratulate your company on your housewarming.”

These words were exactly the same as what Feng Yun had said earlier.

Xia ruofei was speechless. Why did elder Tang, who was on the other side of the ocean, also come to join in the fun?

Xia ruofei wasn’t surprised that old master Tang had received the news. Liang Weimin was the one who had organized Qianqian’s ribbon – cutting ceremony. Old master Tang was Liang Weimin’s uncle, so he must have been the one who told him.

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei suddenly thought of Liang Qichao. He had followed elder Tang to the ocean, but he had not even called him for a long time. He did not know if he had gotten what he wanted and was sent to work at Paradise Farm in Australia.

Of course, this was just a fleeting thought. Xia ruofei immediately smiled and said to Zhou Qing,””Elder Tang is too polite. It’s just a small complex, there’s really no need for this. I’m really sorry to trouble you to make a trip down personally, general manager Zhou.”

This kind of building that cost millions of dollars was indeed nothing in the eyes of Tang He, a super – rich man with a net worth of tens of billions of dollars. He could buy a yacht or a villa for more than this price.

Of course, Xia ruofei also knew that this was just elder Tang’s way of expressing his goodwill.

“It’s no trouble at all. This is a task personally assigned by Chairman Tang.” Zhou Qing chuckled and said,”besides, I’ve long heard of Mr. Xia. You’re indeed young and promising!”

“Director Zhou, you’re too kind!” Xia ruofei said humbly.

Zhou Qing had also brought a large flower basket. Two assistants had already carried the flower basket to the arch. This was a common practice in China. It was not about how much the flower basket was worth, but how important the name or company on the flower basket was.

The more important it was, the more face the master would have.

Therefore, after the two flower baskets from Hengfeng group and shengbang group were moved over, Ling Xiaotian, President Zheng, and the others looked at Xia ruofei in a different light. These two companies, which were both big companies in the world, had actually sent flower baskets over at the same time.

And it was just for the opening ceremony of an office building inside a farm.

Especially Ling Xiaotian, when he looked at Xia ruofei, the smile on his face was much more amiable than usual. He was even more satisfied with his future son – in – Law.

Zhou Qing pointed to the brand new Mercedes – Benz at the end and said,””Mr. Xia, that car is a housewarming gift from Chairman Tang. After the event is over, please send someone to hand it over to us, and there are some necessary procedures to be done.” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but take a deep breath. This old master Tang and old master Ma were really generous.

Xia ruofei recognized the brand new Mercedes – Benz at a glance. It was the new S – Class of this year. This was a high – end imported business car. The entry – Level version cost more than one million Yuan. The top 4.0 t model cost nearly 1.9 million Yuan.

And with elder Tang’s status, how could he possibly give a beginner – Level gift? Xia ruofei did not even need to look to know that the car must be of the best model.

Sure enough, Zhou Qing smiled and said,”Mr. Xia, old master Tang said that although you have a Knight XV off – Road vehicle, you don’t have the company’s business car. His 4.0 t Mercedes – Benz S – Class sedan can barely match your status. It’s the most suitable for business purposes.”

The corner of Xia ruofei’s mouth twitched. He smiled bitterly and said,””President Zhou, I’m just a small company. I don’t have to be so particular about this ... But since elder Tang has spoken, I’ll accept this gift. Please convey my gratitude!”

“Alright!” Zhou Qing said with a smile.

“It’s almost time. Director Zhou, please follow me to the guest area!” Xia ruofei said.

“Mr. Xia, please!” Zhou Qing said courteously.

As a senior executive of shengbang Corporation, Zhou Qing did not look down on Xia ruofei just because he was a young boss. On the contrary, he even treated Xia ruofei with a trace of respect.

This was naturally because of Grandpa Tang He.

Fortunately, Liang Weimin had left some space for himself when he was preparing for the ribbon – cutting ceremony. There were also some extra seats in the guest area, including the Golden Scissors used during the ribbon – cutting ceremony.

Without waiting for Xia ruofei’s instructions, Liang Weimin had already taken the initiative to call the emcee and the hostess to the side. After changing the schedule at the last minute, Zhou Qing and Feng Yun would definitely have to go on stage to cut the ribbon.
