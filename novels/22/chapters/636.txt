Chapter 637: The breeding of pomfrets (1)

“Chairman.” Feng Rao called out with a smile.

Recently, the company was slowly getting on track and Feng Jing wasn’t as busy as before. However, she was able to live her days to the fullest. The sense of accomplishment from slowly expanding a small company with great potential was unparalleled, so she was in a very good mood.

“Chief Feng, when you have time, go and understand the requirements to set up a pharmaceutical factory.” Xia ruofei said directly.

“A pharmaceutical factory?” Feng Jing was stunned for a moment, then asked in surprise,”Chairman, you’ve already found a way to mass – produce the jaded skin cream?”

Feng Rao couldn’t forget about the jaded skin cream because of its amazing beauty effects. She was sure that once this product was launched on the market, it would definitely be a phenomenal product. There was no doubt that it would set off a frenzy to buy it.

Hence, when Xia ruofei mentioned the pharmaceutical factory, Feng Jing immediately thought of the jaded skin ointment.

On the other hand, Xia ruofei was stunned. He had been so busy recently that he had forgotten about his promise to Feng Jing to find a way to achieve mass production of the jaded skin cream.

Xia ruofei was a little embarrassed as he said,””This ... There are still some technical difficulties that need to be overcome.”

“Oh ... I see!” Feng Rao said in disappointment.

At the same time, Xia ruofei was also curious. He couldn’t help but ask,””Chief Feng, if I’m not wrong, I should be telling you about the pharmaceutical factory, right? Even if the jaded skin cream was mass – produced, he should have set up a cosmetics company! What does it have to do with the pharmaceutical factory?”

“Chairman, didn’t you tell me that the jaded skin cream is made from natural Chinese medicine?” Feng Jing asked, amused. That belonged to the category of medicinal makeup! There are a lot of manufacturers that produce this type of cosmetic now, don’t you know?”

Xia ruofei finally realized that he had been ignorant.

He talked about the pharmaceutical factory as soon as he came up, so it was no wonder that Feng Jing would think of the jaded skin cream.

......

Xia ruofei was a little embarrassed.”I see ... I really don’t know much about this ... CEO Feng, I’ll speed up the progress. I believe that you won’t have to wait too long for the mass production of the jaded skin cream!”

“I’ll be waiting for your good news then!”Feng Rao said with a smile. By the way, since the establishment of the pharmaceutical factory has nothing to do with the jaded skin cream, does that mean you have another good project on your side?”

Ever since Feng Jing had joined the company, she had already witnessed Xia ruofei’s prowess in those projects. Whether it was Taoyuan vegetables, Drunken Eight Immortals wine, or the Dendrobium candidly, they were all top – notch in their industry. Hence, she was rather interested in Xia ruofei’s new project.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”yes, I have a formula for a new drug. I hope to build a manufacturing factory to produce it. So, you need to understand more about the testing and approval of the new drug.”

“Alright,” he said. Feng Rao agreed without hesitation.

After hanging up, Xia ruofei pondered for a moment and gave Tian Huixin a call.

“Little Xia!” Tian Huixin quickly picked up the phone.

“Aunt Huixin, are you busy?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

Tian Huixin laughed and said,”I’m taking Huanhuan shopping!” Xiao Xia, what’s the matter?”

Xia ruofei replied,”yes!” Aunt Huixin, it’s like this. For Chengcheng’s treatment this time, I’ve made some slight adjustments to the prescription. I’ve even found some substitutes for some precious medicinal herbs. After this period of treatment, the efficacy is still very good. This also proves that the new prescription is feasible!”

When Tian Huixin heard this, she was a little excited. She couldn’t help but ask,””Little Xia, you’re saying ... This medicine can be mass – produced?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”yes!” It might take some time to actually achieve mass production, but it’s already possible!”

“That’s great!”Tian Huixin said happily. Little Xia, this is a good thing with boundless merit!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Tian Huixin could empathize with the pain of an autistic family. She understood the helplessness and despair too well.

“I need your help with the medicine for autism,” Xia ruofei said.

“Go ahead!” Tian Huixin said without hesitation. Whether it’s funds or manpower, I’ll definitely support you with all my might!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”neither ... Aunt Huixin, it’s like this. There’s only one case, Chengcheng, and it’s still lacking in representative work. I’m considering recruiting a small group of volunteers to further verify the efficacy of this special medicine. If it’s feasible, I’m going to report it to the relevant departments for approval according to the procedure and strive to put it into production as soon as possible.”

Xia ruofei paused and continued,””I’ve considered the fact that you’ve come into contact with more families with children with autism, so ... I hope to recruit about ten children with autism through you. I’ll provide them with this drug for free. There’s only one purpose, and that is to further verify the efficacy.”

“No problem!” Tian Huixin said without hesitation,”this is definitely a great thing! A lot of parents of autistic children go around asking for medical treatment, and even a little bit of information on the internet is like a life – saving straw for them. Not to mention, you already have two successful cases here, so they’ll definitely be scrambling for it!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”then I’ll leave this matter to you!” It’s actually more convenient to have children from Sanshan city. Also, it’s best to have a variety of cases, with children of different degrees and types. ”
