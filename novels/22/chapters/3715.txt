The spiritual energy remained in the air, forming a pattern invisible to the naked eye.

This image was exactly the same as the one Xia ruofei had created with his naked eyes.

Naturally, Xia ruofei could see the image that he had created with his spiritual energy.

He sat cross – legged on his bed and began to study the new pattern seriously. Chapter 2008: the king of Chambord!

Xia ruofei himself could not help but be slightly stunned. He stared at the lines on the back of the seven stars order and took a closer look.

However, when he really looked at it seriously, that faint sense of familiarity disappeared.

Xia ruofei felt that this was like looking at naked – Eye 3D pictures when he was young. He had to stare at the picture until he was drowsy before the picture would slowly start moving and finally form a three – dimensional picture. However, when he was happy and focused on it, the picture would immediately return to its original state.

3D image?

After Xia ruofei had this thought, he couldn’t help but have an idea.

He quickly picked up the seven stars order and put it in front of his eyes. Then, he stared at the seven stars order in the same way he used to look at naked – Eye 3D pictures when he was a child.

The 3D effect was actually created by the position difference between the two eyes.

Xia ruofei was now a practitioner. Naturally, he did not need to constantly search for the feeling of drowsiness like when he was young. He could easily multitask. The angles of the images collected by his two eyes were different. If he multitasked, he could quickly create the so – called 3D effect.

The pattern on the back of the seven stars order also started to move in Xia ruofei’s vision.

Of course, it didn’t form a three – dimensional effect. It just moved and some lines that were originally unrelated were connected again.

This would naturally form a new pattern.

When the new pattern became clear, Xia ruofei found the familiar feeling again.

He immediately memorized this picture.

Then, Xia ruofei quickly used his spiritual power to draw the pattern.
