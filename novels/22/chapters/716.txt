Chapter 717: Chapter 492 – fruitful_1

“I haven’t really paid much attention to the orchard recently.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”wait a moment. I’ll make a call and ask.”

Xia ruofei would only go to the water tower every few months to add some of the spirit Heart Flower petal solution. He had left the specific management of the orchard to Cao tieshu, so he was not sure if the lychees and cherries in the orchard had ripened.

But Cao tieshu definitely knew.

Hence, Xia ruofei took out his phone and dialed Cao tieshu’s number.

“Boss!” Cao tieshu quickly picked up the phone.

Xia ruofei asked,”old Cao, how’s the situation with the fruit trees on our farm?” Looking at the time, it should be about to ripen, right?”

“Boss, you haven’t been on the farm these past few days. I was just about to report to you!” Cao tieshu quickly said. The cherries and lychees have ripened, so it’s best to pick them in the next few days. ”

“Is that so?” Xia ruofei was slightly surprised.”I remember that our species of lychees ripens around July, right?”

Xia ruofei had brought in late – ripened cherries, which ripened in early June. The lychees would ripen later.

“We also find it strange!” Cao tieshu said. The lychees are growing especially well this year. They bear fruits earlier than usual, and they’re much bigger than normal lychees!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and guessed the reason.”Lychees grew in the southeast and were the most suitable for the water and soil here. With the help of the spirit Heart Flower petal solution, it was not surprising that they matured a month earlier than normal.

The cherries were imported from the North, so they were definitely not adapted to the climate and environment in the South. Under the nourishment of the spirit Heart Flower petal solution, the favorable and unfavorable conditions were basically offset, so they matured on time.

The cherries would probably ripen even earlier next year. After a year of growing, these cherry trees would definitely be more and more adapted to the environment in the South.

......

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””There’s nothing strange about it. The lychee seedlings I bought are improved breeds! Since the fruit trees have ripened, let’s go to the orchard to have a look. ”

“Alright, I’ll head over now!” Cao tieshu said.

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei smiled at Lin Qiao and said,””Qiao’ er, you’re quite lucky. The fruits here have ripened. ”

“Yay!” “Let’s go!” Lin Qiao cheered.

Xia ruofei then said to Hu Zi’s mother,””Auntie, shall we go and take a look together?”

Hu ‘Zi’s mother smiled and said,”I won’t be joining in the fun!” You young people can go! I’ll prepare lunch for you!”

Xia ruofei didn’t insist and said,””Alright, thank you for your hard work, Auntie ... The ingredients are all in the refrigerator. If you need anything, just tell me. I’ll go to the county supermarket to buy it!”

“It’s fine, it’s fine. You guys go ahead!” Hu Zi’s mother said with a smile.

Xia ruofei left the house with Lin Qiao and drove the pickup truck straight to the orchard.

On the way, Xia ruofei gave it some thought and called Feng Jing, asking her to go to the orchard as well.

Very quickly, the pickup truck drove along the flat cement road on the farm to the orchard. Cao tieshu and Feng Rao had walked over, so they had not arrived yet.

Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao got off the car and walked up the mountain. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Along the way, he saw fruit trees on both sides of the road. On this side, there were only lychee trees. The heavy clusters of lychees bent the branches of the fruit trees. These red lychees looked particularly delicate and beautiful under the embellishment of the Emerald green leaves, making people drool with desire.

Lin Qiao’s eyes couldn’t help but light up when she saw it. She couldn’t help but want to go and pick it.

Xia ruofei laughed,”greedy cat!” Don’t be in such a hurry! We’ll talk about it when old Cao and the others come. We don’t have any tools, are you going to use your hands?”

Lin Qiao stuck out her tongue in embarrassment.

The two of them strolled around the mountains for a while, admiring the beautiful scenery of the fruit orchard. Soon, Cao tieshu and Feng Rao arrived one after another.

The attentive Cao tieshu even brought a wicker basket and a pair of large scissors for picking lychees.

“Chairman, I haven’t been to the orchard in a long time. I didn’t expect the lychees to be fully ripe!” Feng Rao said with a smile.

Xia ruofei laughed and replied,”it’s not just lychees!” The cherries over there are already ripe!”

“Old Cao has brought the tools. Let’s try the lychees that are produced on this farm!” Xia ruofei continued.

“I’ll do it, I’ll do it!” Lin Qiao quickly said.

Feng Rao looked at Lin Qiao and then at Xia ruofei.””Chairman, this is ...”

“Oh! I forgot to introduce her to you. This is my younger sister, Lin Qiao. She just finished her college entrance examination and ... She’s going to stay at our farm for a while. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Qiao’ er, this is the General Manager of our paradise Corporation, Feng Jing!”

“Hello, Sister Feng Rao!” Lin Qiao said with a smile.

Feng Rao also showed a gentle smile and said,””Hello! Little sister Lin Qiao is so beautiful! It seems like our Chairman’s family has good genes!”

“Sister Feng Rao, you’re the pretty one!” Lin Qiao smiled and said,”but you’re wrong! I’m not related to brother ruofei by blood, so I’m not related to his family’s genes at all!”

Xia ruofei explained,”Qiao’ er is one of my comrades. She’s also the younger sister of my sworn brother. Although we’re not related by blood, she’s like my biological sister in my heart.”
