Chapter 3825  A long - Lost upgrade (1)

    The spirit map scroll was like a rain after a long drought. After the World stone entered the spirit map space, the entire scroll trembled slightly.

  In the spirit map space, in an independent space, the realm Fox Bai Qingqing could also sense that the fluctuations of the laws in the spirit map space had become stronger. It immediately perked up and quickly focused its mind and began to comprehend.

  Xia ruofei was very familiar with the reaction of the spirit painting scroll when it absorbed the world stone. However, he had not seen this scene for a long time so he was very emotional.

  Xia ruofei continued to take out world stones and threw them into the spirit map space. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

  There were many world stones in the jade box. Even after the spirit map continued to absorb the world stones for a while, the world stones in the jade box had only gone down by one or two layers.

  Xia ruofei did not hesitate this time, nor did he feel any heartache for the world stones. He simply threw them into the spirit map space one by one. As the number of world stones absorbed increased, the spirit map scroll trembled more and more violently.

  Xia ruofei knew that this was the reaction of the spirit map space after absorbing a large number of world stones in a short period of time. It did not mean that the space could break through immediately.

  In reality, if one did not have enough world stones, the rate of investment would be the same, and the realm would not be able to level up.

  However, Xia ruofei could not wait any longer. He estimated the number of world stones in the jade box and felt that it should be enough to upgrade the spirit map space by one level. Hence, he did not stop and continued to put in the world stones one by one.

  Fortunately, the absorption speed of the spirit map space was extremely fast. Basically, once the world stone entered the space, it would be immediately absorbed completely without leaving a trace.

  As for the realm Fox Bai Qingqing, she was also fully focused on understanding the special spatial rules.

  Every world stone that entered the spirit map space was like throwing a stone into a calm ocean of laws. It would quickly cause a large number of ripples. At this time, the fluctuations of the laws of space were much more intense than usual. Bai Qingqing was now comprehending the laws, and she could come into contact with some of the laws that were usually not exposed. This would be of great help to her cultivation.

  Time slowly passed, and the number of world stones in the jade box also decreased.

  Unknowingly, there was only half a box of world stones left in the jade box. However, the spirit map scroll was still trembling without any signs of a breakthrough.

  Xia ruofei's expression didn't change. He didn't slow down as he took out the world stones and threw them into the spirit map space.

  Bai Qingqing was also focused on comprehending the spatial laws and did not notice that Xia ruofei had already thrown more than half of the world stones into the space.
