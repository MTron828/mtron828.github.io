Chapter 762: Squad leader Xia returns to the team (1)

“We received a Mission Notice two months ago.” Guo Zhan said,”it’s the time I mentioned to you that I might come to the three mountains to meet you.”

Xia ruofei nodded slightly. He had a deep impression of this incident.

“According to the trailer, the mission level is not very high.” Guo Zhan said,”my mentality is still relatively relaxed, but after the official mission was issued two days ago, the situation changed ...”

Xia ruofei listened attentively to avoid missing out on any details. Soon, he had a general understanding of the situation.

It turned out that the main purpose of this mission was to protect the famous scientist, Mr. Liang Qiming, who had returned to the country three years ago.

Liang Qiming studied in the United States in his early years and then worked in the United United States before he returned to China, he was a tenured professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was a world – famous scientist and the most likely Chinese scientist to win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in recent years.

Liang Qiming received a warm welcome after he returned to the country and received many honors. However, he rejected the offers from many famous universities in the country and chose his alma mater, Sanshan University, instead.

Liang Qiming naturally received the best treatment at Sanshan University. Of course, because of his achievements in the field of science, he quickly applied for a National – Level research project and won a large amount of research funding.

The mission that Guo Zhan and the others had received was related to the topic that Liang Qiming had been researching for more than two years. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Many scientific discoveries in history were accidental products.

For example, the famous “brother Wei” was an unexpected gain from Pfizer in the United States. They originally wanted to develop a drug to treat angina, but in the end, they found that the effect of the drug in the clinical trial was not very obvious. They originally decided to take back the drugs that the experimenters had not used up and research them to improve.

As a result, in the process of receiving the drugs, Pfizer discovered that the female experimental group had obediently returned the drugs. The young men were also relatively compliant, but ... The middle – aged and elderly men did not return the drugs.

Pfizer immediately conducted an in – depth investigation and discovered that while the medicine for angina expanded the blood vessels of the entire body, it could also make the blood flow easily to a specific organ, causing the organ to become light and erect.

......

Originally, this was supposed to be a side effect of the drug and needed to be improved. However, Pfizer immediately launched a plan to use this side effect as a new research direction, and thus, a small blue pill that took the world by storm was born.

Liang Qiming’s research this time had the same results.

Their main research direction was to synthesize a type of polymer composite material. However, during the process of the experiment, they accidentally discovered a new composite material among the by – Products of the synthetic material.

Liang Qiming was more sensitive than ordinary people in science. He immediately conducted preliminary research on the material he named alpha 6.

Liang Qiming discovered that the alpha 6 material had a wide range of applications. This discovery was immediately reported to the higher – ups.

It was also at this time that the higher – ups issued a Mission Notice to the lone wolf assault team through the military. Of course, at that time, the research on the alpha 6 material was still in its preliminary stage, so the main task was to escort the relevant information to the capital.

Because of the fierce competition between various forces on the internet, there were no secrets in front of hackers. Therefore, the computers of important research institutes were physically isolated from the internet. Confidential information would never be transmitted through the internet, but the most primitive method of human escort.

However, as Liang Qiming’s research on the alpha 6 material deepened, the characteristics of this new synthetic material were further explored. He discovered that the alpha 6 material could also play an important role in the military industry.

The current research results showed that the alpha 6 material could be applied to a variety of weapons and equipment, and the effect of improving the performance of the equipment was very obvious. It could even improve the performance of several military equipment by a generation, directly leading the world’s equipment of the same kind.

The mission’s level increased immediately.

The higher – ups quickly decided that the lone wolf assault team would send elite personnel to escort professor Liang and the relevant research materials to the capital. The applied research would continue in a secret military research Institute in the suburbs of the capital.

The Research Institute was under the protection of the military and was located deep underground. It was protected by a layer of reinforced concrete that was dozens of meters thick. It could even guarantee the safety of personnel during a nuclear strike.

The security of this place was not something a University’s research Institute could compare to.

Therefore, the mission of Guo Zhan and the rest of the team was to escort Liang Qiming and his team.

This kind of escort was naturally most suitable for special combat units such as the lone wolf commando unit, because even if the Army was sent to escort, it was difficult to guarantee that it would be foolproof. The large – scale operation could easily be learned by the enemy forces. They could carry out decapitation operations under the protection of the Army, or even use some more extreme means to achieve their goals.

The lone wolf assault team’s elite team would be even safer with the secret escort.

After Guo Zhan read the mission briefing, he immediately realized that the difficulty of this mission was extremely high.

This was because Liang Qiming’s preliminary research was completely carried out in the Research Institute of Sanshan University. The confidentiality of such research institutes was not as strict as the military. It was hard to say if the hostile forces had already received some information.
