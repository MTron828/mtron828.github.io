When Xia ruofei went downstairs, Lin Qiao had already woken up and was stretching at the entrance of the farmhouse, facing the clear artificial lake.

One had to admit that the environment of Paradise Farm was really great, especially with the artificial lake at the entrance of the farm villa and the endless green grassland in the distance. It was really refreshing to look out in the morning!

“Brother ruofei, you’re such a lazy worm. You actually woke up so late!” Lin Qiaoqiao laughed.

Lin Qiao didn’t know that Xia ruofei had been in the boundless space for more than ten days and didn’t sleep.

Xia ruofei touched his nose and chuckled,””I’ve never seen you wake up so early in the country! You can’t be jet lag, right?”

Lin Qiao said disdainfully,”brother ruofei, can you have some common sense?” Australia was two hours ahead of China, but it was only FiveO’ clock in China! I should have slept later if I hadn’t gotten over the jet lag! You’re finding excuses for your own laziness ...”

Xia ruofei laughed.”Okay, okay, okay. You’re the most hardworking. But only when you have fun ...”

Lin Qiao rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and said, “I’m too lazy to bother with you ...”

Liang Qichao prepared a sumptuous breakfast for everyone. Not long after the three of them finished their breakfast in the farmhouse, Tang Yitian’s family arrived at Paradise Farm. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Mr. Xia, how could I trouble you to personally welcome me?” Tang Yitian quickly said when he saw Xia ruofei waiting at the entrance of the farm.

Xia ruofei smiled.”You’re the guests. It’s only right.”

When Tang Haoran saw Xia ruofei, he immediately called out,””Brother ruofe...Uh...Master, Good Morning!”

Xia ruofei laughed and touched Tang Haoran’s head.””After you formally acknowledge me as your master today, remember to change the way you address me!”

“I got it!” “Master!” Tang Haoran called out obediently.

“En!” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

Jennifer also got out of the car from the other side. She was holding an album with an old – looking exterior with her own autograph on it.

Jennifer handed the album to Lin Qiao with a smile and said,””Lin! This is the gift I promised to give you. I hope you like it!”

“Jennifer’s echo!” Lin Qiao’s eyes lit up. She took the album and held it with both hands.”I’m so happy!” She said. Jennifer, thank you!”

Jennifer smiled and said,”your brother saved Haoran’s life. Now, he’s willing to be Haoran’s teacher ... No, master! Compared to these, my gift is not even worth mentioning!”

“That’s not the same. He’s him and I’m me!” Lin Qiao said,”anyway, this is the most precious gift I’ve ever received. When I go back, my classmates will be so envious ...”

“Do you want to ask Jennifer for some autographs to give to your classmates?” Xia ruofei teased.

Lin Qiao rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and said, “That’s a good suggestion! Jennifer, remember to sign a few more for me later!”

Jennifer chuckled and nodded.””No problem! It’s no trouble at all ...”

“Jennifer, I’ve realized that you like to use idioms more than the Chinese ...” Xia ruofei said, scratching his head.

Everyone burst into laughter.

The group walked into the farm villa. Xia ruofei sat down on the sofa and asked seriously,””Mr. Tang, Ms. Jennifer, are you sure you’ve thought it through and are willing to let Haoran be my apprentice?”

“Of course, this is Haoran’s good fortune!” Tang Yitian said without hesitation.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”alright then. Haoran, come and be my disciple!” I’ll officially take you in as my disciple today!”

Tang Yitian quickly pulled Tang Haoran’s hand.

Tang Haoran must have been taught by Tang Yitian before they came. The little guy immediately knelt down in front of Xia ruofei and kowtowed three times. He shouted,”Master!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but show a gratified expression. Although kneeling was no longer encouraged, he had accepted Tang Haoran as his disciple and was going to teach him cultivation techniques. Thus, everything was in accordance with the rules and he accepted this big bow very calmly.

Although Jennifer felt that it was a little strange, she was not in the mood to kneel down and pay her respects. However, after she married Tang Yitian, all the major matters in the family were decided by Tang Yitian, so she did not say anything. Instead, she showed a trace of a fresh look.

“Get up!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Haoran, pour tea for your master!” Tang Yitian ordered.

He didn’t know how an expert like Xia ruofei would take in a disciple, so everything was done according to the old etiquette passed down by the Yixing society.

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”No need, no need. Three kowtows is enough. I’m not that particular.”

Then, Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,””Haoran, come here!”

Tang Haoran came to Xia ruofei’s side obediently. Xia ruofei stared into his eyes and said seriously,””Today, I’ll officially accept you as my disciple. There aren’t many rules in my sect, but there’s one very important one, and that is that after you’ve learned something, you can’t bully the weak, you can’t ignore the rules and do whatever you want, you must always have a sense of justice! Do you understand? If one day I find out that you’re using the skills I taught you to do evil, I’ll definitely cripple you with my own hands!”

Xia ruofei’s words were harsh and carried a trace of spiritual power. Tang Haoran’s heart trembled when he heard this. He quickly said,””Master, I’ll remember this!”

Xia ruofei had considered the fact that Tang Haoran was still young and his mind was not mature yet. On the other hand, a cultivator’s power was far beyond that of the secular world. If he was not educated from a young age, he would grow up to be an arrogant and overbearing person. That would really be a disaster for society. That was why he did not hesitate to use his spiritual power to engrave the mark of rules in Tang Haoran’s heart. He wanted Tang Haoran to know respect and justice from a young age.

Tang Yitian listened from the side and couldn’t help but secretly nod. He looked at Xia ruofei with a trace of gratitude.

After Xia ruofei finished speaking, the serious look on his face disappeared and was replaced by a kind smile.

He took out the Jade Leaf that he had prepared in the spirit map space and carved protective runes on it. He said with a smile,””Haoran, this is a gift from master to you. Take it!”

“Mr. Xia,” Tang Yitian said hurriedly,”we should be the ones giving you the acknowledgment gift. How can we let you spend so much money?”

As a rich man, Tang Yitian naturally had a good eye. He could tell at a glance that although the quality of the Jade Leaf could only be said to be average, the carving was definitely the work of a natural master. It could be said that the value of this Jade Leaf was very high.

Tang Haoran was about to reach out to take it, but after hearing his father’s words, he hesitated and retracted his hand.

Xia ruofei smiled and put the Jade Leaf into Tang Haoran’s hand. Then he said to Tang Yitian,””This is a meeting gift for my disciple, not for you!”

“Master, my father doesn’t allow me to accept it ...” Tang Haoran hesitated.

Xia ruofei deliberately darkened his face and pretended to be angry.”Haoran, it’s only your first day as a disciple and you dare to disobey master?”

“Haoran, since it’s a gift from your master, you should accept it!” Tang Yitian said quickly.

Tang Haoran nodded happily and said to Xia ruofei,””Thank you, master!”

Xia ruofei also liked this talented disciple. He smiled and said,””You’re welcome. Haoran, give me your hand ...”

Although Tang Haoran did not know Xia ruofei’s intention, he still obediently stretched out his left hand while his right hand held the Jade Leaf tightly.

Xia ruofei flipped his hand and a silver needle for acupuncture appeared in his hand. He quickly extended his hand and immediately retracted it.

Tang Haoran felt a sharp pain in his finger. Then, he realized that his master had used a needle to prick his finger.

It was naturally very painful to have ten fingers connected to the heart, but he still gritted his teeth very bravely and did not cry out in pain.

Xia ruofei’s eyes were filled with approval.””Hurry up and take out the Jade Leaf!”

Tang Haoran subconsciously stretched out his right hand and showed the Jade Leaf.

Xia ruofei gently wiped the blood on Tang Haoran’s pierced finger. He did not touch Tang Haoran’s finger, but a drop of blood was squeezed out of thin air. It flew directly towards the Jade Leaf on Tang Haoran’s right palm.

The blood dripped onto the surface of the Jade Leaf and quickly seeped in, disappearing without a trace in the blink of an eye.

Jennifer’s eyes widened in surprise when she saw the scene that went against the laws of nature.

Tang Yitian, who had witnessed Xia ruofei’s magical means, had a fiery look in his eyes. At the same time, he also realized that this Jade Leaf was not as simple as a high – Quality carving.

As expected, Xia ruofei continued,””Mr. Tang, this Jade Leaf must be worn by Haoran at all times. You must never take it off at any time. You Must Remember This!”

“Yes!” Tang Yitian quickly replied with a serious face. Please rest assured, Mr. Xia!”

After saying that, Tang Yitian personally hung the Jade Leaf on Tang Haoran’s neck, and then gave him a few words of advice.

Tang Haoran had always been a well – behaved child. Now that his master and father had given him such a serious instruction, he took it to heart and nodded heavily to indicate that he would always wear it.

Xia ruofei stood up and said,””Mr. Tang, Jennifer, please sit on the first floor for a while. I’ll take Haoran upstairs to completely eliminate the hidden dangers in his body. In addition, I’m going to teach him some basic things. It’s not convenient to let too many people know about these things, so please understand!”

“I understand!” Tang Yitian quickly said. He understood! Magic can’t be passed on to six ears! This is what I should do!”

Xia ruofei nodded and waved at Tang Haoran.””Haoran, come with me!”

With that, Xia ruofei strode towards the stairs.

Tang Haoran was also very interested in what Xia ruofei was going to teach him. Although he was young, he had been influenced by his father since he was young. He had heard many of the Yi Xing society’s glorious past, so he always had a dream of being a Knight.

Now that he had acknowledged Xia ruofei as his master, the big dream in Tang Haoran’s small heart began to stir.

Without another word, he quickly followed Xia ruofei ...
