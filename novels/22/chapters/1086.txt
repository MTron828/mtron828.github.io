Chapter 1087: Chapter 688-it’s too late to regret (1)

Translator: 549690339

“Xinyu ...” Fang Hongli’s face was pale.”Did the higher – ups really ban you?”

Dong Xinyu suddenly came to her senses. Her face was even a little ferocious as she said madly,””Hmph! Since they’ve gone too far, don’t blame me for not following the rules! I’ll go to the media and expose it!”

“Xinyu! “Be careful ...” Fang Hongli’s face changed.

Exposing scandals to the media was a double – edged sword. It might disgust the other party, but it would also ruin her own future. Everyone in the industry would reject her Yingluo. Who would trust a big – mouthed lunatic?

Dong Xinyu gritted her teeth and said,”I’ve already been banned. What’s there to worry about?!” If they don’t give me a way out, they won’t have an easy time either!”

After saying that, Dong Xinyu ignored Fang Hongli’s dissuasion and took out her phone to find the phone number of her familiar media friend.

Fang Hongli’s mouth opened and closed, but in the end, she sighed and did not continue to persuade her. However, in her heart, she had basically given up on Dong Xinyu. She knew very well that Dong Xinyu’s future in the entertainment industry had been completely destroyed.

Fang Hongli even felt a trace of pity when she saw Dong Xinyu in a state of madness.

Dong Xinyu was still an actress, so when the call was connected, she quickly changed her expression and said in a sweet voice,””Hello, chief editor Chen!”

On the other end of the phone, chief editor Chen’s voice was very cold,””It’s miss Dong! What’s the matter?”

Dong Xinyu felt a burst of displeasure in her heart. When she had participated in the finals of the talent show and was at her peak popularity, all these media reporters had been rushing to curry favor with her. She did not expect that it had only been a short while, and this chief editor Chen had also begun to change his tone.

However, Dong Xinyu’s mind was still on the matter of the exposure, so she did not have the mood to fuss over it. She directly said,””Chief editor Chen, I have some exciting news to share with you. It’s about the movie ‘Angel of doom’...”

Every time she finished, chief editor Chen interrupted her and said,””Ms. Dong, I still have a business meeting to attend. Also...We are a serious media company, and we don’t have much demand for entertainment news. I think you should look for another media company!”

After saying that, chief editor Chen did not wait for Dong Xinyu to reply and immediately hung up the phone.

Dong Xinyu could not help but be stunned. When had a reporter ever hung up on her? It was always these people who wanted to interview her with a smile.

“Damn it, I don’t believe that without you, Chen shaoming, we can’t contact the media!” Dong Xinyu said with a cold face.

She cursed in a low voice as she searched for the phone numbers of her friends in the media.

However, as the calls were made, Dong Xinyu’s expression became uglier and uglier.

These media reporters and editors who were usually very enthusiastic about her became very cold when they received her call. Some of them responded to her with a few lukewarm words, while others did not even pick up the phone and hung up directly.

Dong Xinyu did not give up and made more than ten consecutive calls. Finally, she gave up like a deflated ball.

She looked at Fang Hongli with an ashen face and said,””Sister Fang, the media ...”

“This is a total ban ...” Fang Hongli murmured in fear.

All of his work, including concerts, interviews, reality shows, advertisements ... Everything was canceled. Even the media was avoided like a snake. Such a ban was really thorough.

One could imagine that from this moment on, Dong Xinyu, who was originally a little famous, would suddenly disappear from the public eye. Any news related to her would be blocked. Even with the development of the media today, in the face of such a strong ban, Dong Xinyu would not have any room to resist.

Dong Xinyu’s hands trembled as she opened the Weibo app on her phone. As expected, she was no longer able to log in to her account. After entering her account password on the login interface, a prompt box appeared: [Your account has been temporarily suspended for violating relevant laws and regulations of the country. Please contact Weibo customer service if you have any questions.]

Dong Xinyu’s entire body seemed to have been pulled out of her bones, and she was completely limp.

The funny thing was that she had just talked big and wanted to fight to the death, defaming the “doomsday Angel” crew and peach blossom company through the media. She didn’t expect that with a casual phone call, she couldn’t speak even if she had a mouth. Even if she could speak, it couldn’t spread out. She was completely sealed off.

Xia ruofei’s young face appeared in Dong Xinyu’s mind. Even when she was mocking him, Xia ruofei remained calm. Just now, Dong Xinyu thought that Xia ruofei was acting tough but was actually weak and did not have any confidence. Now, it seemed that he did not even bother to talk to her.

In his eyes, I’m not even a shrimp. A phone call from him can control a star’s future and fate. It’s simply life and death!

Dong Xinyu suddenly felt like she was acting like a clown in Zola’s restaurant.

Her lips trembled slightly as she muttered,””It’s him ... It must be him ... Sister Fang, let’s ... Let’s go apologize to Mr. Xia! Otherwise, we’re really done for ...”

After saying that, Dong Xinyu ran in the direction of Zola’s restaurant.

Fang Hongli’s mouth moved. She wanted to say that it was too late.

But she didn’t say it in the end. She let out a long sigh and quickly chased after him.

Dong Xinyu had only run a few steps when she saw Li Yao angrily walking towards her.
