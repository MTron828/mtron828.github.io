1994 A powerful background (2)

He drank until twoo’ clock in the afternoon, and the two bottles of white wine were finally empty.

Although Zhao Yongjun wasn’t completely drunk, his eyes were a little blurred. The white wine that he had been brewing in the space for more than a year had a stronger aftereffect than he had imagined.

To Xia ruofei, this little bit of white wine was nothing. His eyes were still clear and his mind was clear.

“Big brother Zhao, it’s almost time!” Xia ruofei said,”don’t leave today. You can rest here in the afternoon and we’ll have a drink or two tonight.”

Zhao Yongjun chuckled,”I can’t drink anymore … Ruofei, the aftereffects are too strong …”

“Wu Qiang!” Xia ruofei shouted.

Wu Qiang had been waiting outside the dining room after lunch. Upon hearing his words, he immediately pushed the door open and walked in.”President Xia!”

“Help big brother Zhao to the guest room to rest!” Xia ruofei said,”keep an eye on him in the afternoon. He seemed to have drunk a little too much …”

“Yes!” Wu Qiang said.

Then he walked up and helped Zhao Yongjun up, saying,””Old company commander, let’s go! I’ll bring you to your room to rest …”

A drunk person’s body was heavier, so Wu Qiang could basically judge Zhao Yongjun’s condition as soon as he helped him up.

Wu Qiang looked at the two empty bottles on the table and felt a little surprised. He knew Zhao Yongjun’s alcohol tolerance very well. How could he be so drunk from just a pound of white wine? Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

When Wu Qiang was in the Army, he had seen Zhao Yongjun at his craziest, directly blowing a bottle of white wine. Although he was a little older now, he shouldn’t have deteriorated so much!

He even paid special attention to Xia ruofei’s condition and found that Xia ruofei was fine. Could it be that these two bottles of wine were drunk by the old company commander? Then what did President Xia drink?

With a trace of doubt, Wu Qiang helped Zhao Yongjun to the guest room.

Xia ruofei also got up and went back to the master’s courtyard in the middle to rest. Wu Xiujuan and Xia Xiaolan immediately went to the dining room to clean up the leftovers.

After sleeping for the whole afternoon, Xia ruofei woke up in the evening and walked to the courtyard. He saw Zhao Yongjun walking out, rubbing his eyes.

It seemed that he was in a good state.

This was the advantage of Drunken Eight Immortals. Even though the aftereffects were quite strong, he would recover very quickly after a good night’s sleep. Furthermore, it did not really harm his body. Many people would experience symptoms such as headaches after getting drunk from alcohol, but Drunken Eight Immortals definitely did not.

At night, Zhao Yongjun didn’t want to drink anymore, but Xia ruofei laughed and said that he wanted to “use poison to fight poison”, and that alcohol was the best way to cure it. Moreover, he had also carefully prepared low – alcohol noble rot sweet wine. Zhao Yongjun half – declined and let Wu Qiang pour him some wine.

After tasting it, Zhao Yongjun couldn’t stop praising it. He didn’t mention that he wouldn’t drink at night anymore and clinked glasses with Xia ruofei.

After dinner, Xia ruofei wanted Zhao Yongjun to stay in siheyuan, but he insisted on going back. So, he asked Wu Qiang to drive Zhao Yongjun home, and then he took a taxi back.

After sending Zhao Yongjun off, Xia ruofei returned to the master bedroom in the middle courtyard. He took a shower and opened his computer to check his emails.

This time, Xia ruofei finally saw old Blake’s email. He was excited and quickly opened it.

It was indeed full of information he wanted, including information on the Grao family and the Gelman family, Toles ‘situation, and even the distribution of the Mafia forces in Italy. It was very detailed and efficient, which made Xia ruofei very satisfied.

He read the email carefully from the beginning to the end, and then replied to old Blake to express his gratitude and remind him to delete the email as soon as possible.

Xia ruofei also deleted the email. After reading it once, he had memorized all the contents. To be safe, he deleted the email as soon as possible. He was not afraid of trouble, but he did not want the black family to get involved with the Mafia. After all, they had spared no effort to help him collect information.

After deleting the email, Xia ruofei sat in front of his desk and fell into deep thought …

The situation was a little more complicated than he had expected. The Gelman family was actually a vassal family of the glory society, one of the four oldest Mafia groups in Italy.

In Italy, the power of the Mafia was deeply rooted. A few decades ago, they were mainly active in the southern part of Italy. The security in industrial cities such as Turin and Milan was relatively good, but in recent years, the influence of the Mafia had spread throughout Italy, and even their shadow could be vaguely seen in all of Europe.

The Grao family that Monica was from was located in Turin.

They were in the truffle business. Italy’s famous truffle – producing area, the Elba region, was actually a town under the region of Piemonte in Italy. Turin was the third largest city in Italy and was also the capital of the Piemonte region.

The glory society started in the Calabria region of Italy, and the “main business” of this organization was drug trafficking and money laundering. A report in 2013 showed that the glory society’s annual profit was about 53 billion euros, more than the profits of McDonald’s and German bank that year. Around the world, 60000 people were directly or indirectly involved in their criminal activities.

In the Calabria region, the home of the glorious Association, there were many real estate properties of the organization, from restaurants to supermarkets, to highways and bridges. There were traces of their involvement in everything. Compared to the other organizations, the characteristics of this organization were that it was obviously a family, with a large number of relatives and connections, and it was deeply rooted in local areas.

The Gelman family had a cousin relationship with a Big Boss of the glorious Association, so they had slowly developed and become one of the many mafia families in Italy.

Xia ruofei did not expect the Gehrman family to have such a huge organization behind them. The Xuanji glory society’s assets were even more than Tang He and Li Yifu ‘s. This kind of criminal organization had terrifying power.

Of course, Xia ruofei did not cower because of this. Instead, he was filled with fighting spirit.

Of course, he also felt that his decision to change his appearance was correct.

He had a lot of ties now. Only by completely changing his identity could he have no scruples when he arrived in Italy. Otherwise, if he was targeted by such a terrifying Mafia family, he might be fine, but what about his family and friends? No matter how capable he was, he couldn’t protect everyone close to him at all times.

Xia ruofei slowly read through the information that old Blake had given him and started to think of various action plans in his mind.

This was a habit that Xia ruofei had developed in the Army. He had to consider all possibilities.

Of course, everything was ever – changing. Xia ruofei had not arrived Italy yet and it was impossible to predict what would happen. Hence, they could only draw up a few rough plans.

Xia ruofei sat quietly in front of the desk for more than half an hour before he stood up, lay on the bed, and fell asleep.

The next morning, Xia ruofei drove to the Italy Embassy in China.

Zhao Yongjun had already paved the way for him in advance, so the visa was extremely smooth. The consular officer asked a few routine questions before he quickly stamped the card.

Of course, Xia ruofei, who was standing in front of the consular officer, had already changed his appearance in advance. He looked exactly like the picture on the identification card.

After leaving the Embassy, Xia ruofei went to the mall without stopping to buy some clothes and necessities before returning to the courtyard.

He put all the things he had purchased into the spirit map space and immediately turned on his computer to check the flight information.

Xia ruofei had chosen Hansha airlines ‘flight. It would be at 11 p.m. The next day. He had to make a transfer to Frankfurt Germany. This was the fastest flight. If there were no delays, the entire flight would take about 13 hours.
