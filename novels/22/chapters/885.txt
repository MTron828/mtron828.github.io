Xia ruofei looked at he Feng and Cao Guangzhi and said with a smile,””Thank you for your concern, Secretary song. Nan Nan’s enrollment problem has been properly resolved. He Feng, the vice mayor of the Bell Tower District, personally took me to the second primary school of the bell tower to complete the registration procedures. Everything went smoothly. ”

When he Feng and Cao Guangzhi heard this, they were extremely shocked.

They did not expect Secretary song to be so concerned about Xia ruofei. It was not enough for him to personally order a child to go to school. He even called him personally to ask about it.

The two of them now valued Xia ruofei even more.

When he Feng heard Xia ruofei mention him to song Qiming over the phone, he was delighted. He felt that his efforts for the past two days had not been in vain.

Song Qiming chuckled and said,””That’s good then. Little Xia! If you have any difficulties, you can look for me directly. I will do my best to help you solve them. Or you can look for Secretary Xiao Cao, I’ve already told him. ”

Xia ruofei looked at Guangzhi Cao and smiled,””Secretary song, I’m not going to do it with you. By the way, I’m drinking with brother Cao right now. ”

“Is that so?” Song Qiming was slightly surprised. Then, he smiled and said,”drink well. I’ve already given him half a day off. I won’t be looking for him from this afternoon to night.”

“Yes, we will definitely carry out the Secretary’s instructions!” Xia ruofei said half – jokingly,”but if I get your Secretary drunk, you can’t blame me!”

Song Qiming laughed heartily and said,””I promise I won’t blame you. You can help me check Xiao Cao’s alcohol tolerance ...”

After the two of them chatted for a while, song Qiming hesitated and asked,””Xiao Xia, the chief holds your medical skills in high regard. I would like to ask ...”

At this point, song Qiming seemed to want to say something but stopped. Xia ruofei understood what he meant and stood up to walk out of the private room. Then, he asked,””Secretary song, do you have any relatives or friends who have some kind of difficult – to – treat illness?”

Song Qiming sighed.”I wouldn’t have bothered you if it was just a normal relative or friend. Xia, it’s my daughter, Wei Wei.”

Then, song Qiming started to explain his daughter’s situation to Xia ruofei.

Song Qiming’s daughter’s name was Song Wei. She had been song Qiming’s pride since she was young. She was the typical “other family’s child”. She was known far and wide as a talented girl and a top student.

Song Wei didn’t disappoint song Qiming. She entered Yan Jing University as the top Humanities student in the city.

However, Song Wei did not choose a popular major like Business Administration as song Qiming had expected. Instead, she chose the Department of Archeology at Yan Jing university based on her own interests.

Basically, with Song Wei’s ranking, if she chose Yan Jing University, she would definitely enter a popular major. She also became the first recorded top scorer in the city of archeology.

Song Qiming came from a poor family. He did not have many restrictions on his daughter’s education like those rich and powerful families. Although he was a little disappointed that his daughter had chosen her major in the college entrance examination, he still respected her opinion and did not interfere.

It had been proven that choosing a major that one was interested in and willing to take as a career would definitely stimulate one’s enthusiasm for learning.

After Song Wei entered the Department of Archeology at Yanjing University, she was like a fish in water. She had a solid foundation in the basic and professional courses and was well – liked by the professor. She had long locked in a spot for a master’s degree, and her research direction was still a branch of archeology.

After entering the fourth year, Song Wei had many practical opportunities and could follow the experts and professors to do field archeology and tomb archeology.

During an archaeological event half a year ago, the accident that song Qiming was most worried about happened.

At that time, Song Wei followed an archaeological team made up of experts from Yanjing University and the History Museum to an ancient tomb of the Ming Dynasty that had just been discovered.

The tomb of the Ming Dynasty had been opened by tomb raiders. After the villagers found it, they immediately reported it to the government. At first, it was only the local cultural relics Department that protected it. Later, the tomb was discovered on a large scale. After reporting it to the higher levels, the country set up an archaeological team consisting of experts from the Department of Archeology of Yanjing University and the National History Museum to carry out a protective excavation of the tomb.

Song Wei was the most outstanding student in the Department of Archeology, so she also got the opportunity to practice.

In the beginning, everything went smoothly. However, when they excavated the main burial chamber, an accident happened.

Although fresh air had been pumped into the main burial chamber with a blast fan in advance, and it had been fully ventilated, and the air test had been carried out, no harmful gases were found. However, Song Wei and the other three archeologists who were the first to enter the tomb started to feel dizzy and nauseated.

They quickly left the main burial chamber and received treatment.

There seemed to be a colorless and odorless invisible poison in the main burial chamber. The four of them, including Song Wei, were showing symptoms of different degrees of poisoning.

As Song Wei was a girl, she was well taken care of by the archeologists. Hence, she was the last one to enter the tomb and had spent a lot of time inside. The male team member who entered before her had already started to show symptoms of poisoning.

Hence, Song Wei’s symptoms were the least severe.
