2920 Charlie’s strength_

The people on the rescue ship were very surprised that the helicopter had returned so quickly. According to the positioning System, after the helicopter rescued Charlie, it would take at least forty minutes to arrive. However, it had not even been half the time yet, and the commander had already received the helicopter’s landing request. The helicopter soon appeared in everyone’s field of vision.

Next, the helicopter’s landing operation was also very flamboyant. To everyone, it looked like the fuel was about to run out. The pilot was burning with anxiety and couldn’t wait to land the plane. From a professional point of view, this landing was a bit rough.

In the rescue helicopter, the captain proudly high – fived the co – Pilot and then excitedly said through the headset,””Mr. Cohe, the plane has landed safely. It took us 25 minutes!”

“Very good!” Charlie cohe replied. My assistant will transfer 5 million dollars to your account as soon as possible!”

“Thank you for your generosity, Mr. Coch!” The captain said excitedly.

Charlie cohe was not in the mood to talk to the pilot. He took off his headphones and hung them on the wall of the cabin. Then, he unbuckled his seat belt and stood up.

He refused the help of the medical staff and walked to the cabin door with weak steps.

The stewardess had already opened the cabin door and lowered the accommodation ladder. Charlie Koch was the first to step down from the rescue helicopter.

Although the helicopter’s engine had been turned off, the rotor wings were still spinning rapidly under the influence of inertia. The wind blew Charlie cohe’s hair into a mess. He bent over and quickly left the area where the helicopter had landed.

Good, the captain of the rescue ship, had received the news and was already waiting on the deck with medical experts. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

When good saw Charlie Koch appear at the cabin door alone, he couldn’t help but be taken aback. Charlie had not even waited for the rescue personnel on the plane, and had quickly walked out on his own.

It was not until Charlie walked over that good came back to his senses. He quickly walked up to Charlie, braving the wind.

“Mr. Cohe! Hello there!” Good said eagerly,”I’m the captain of the Noah rescue ship, good! It’s an honor to be at your service!”

Charlie’s footsteps did not stop as he said anxiously,”Captain good, please find me a private room immediately. I have important things to deal with!”

“Mr. Cohe, you’d better get a medical examination from a professional first,” said good quickly. “We have to be responsible for your health!” Also ... There are a few reporters on the ship, including CNN and BBC ...”

Charlie cohe impatiently interrupted Good’s words and said, “I’m not interested in meeting any reporters, and there’s nothing wrong with my body! Did I not express it clearly? I have something very important to deal with, and I need a private and undisturbed room! I need it immediately!”

“Yes!” Good quickly replied. No problem! No problem! Please follow me!”

With that, Gu de hurriedly led Xia ruofei forward and waved for the medical staff to step aside.

The crew on the ship naturally listened to Good’s instructions, but the reporters on the ship were not so obedient. They all swarmed around him.

“Mr. Cohe, may I ask what happened? Why did the proud sun suddenly sink?”

The proud sun was the call for the Super – Luxury yacht that Charlie cohe had personally blown up last night.

“Mr. Cohe, are there any other survivors?”

“Mr. Cohe, how’s your body? Will it affect your work at the Coch group?”

“I’m sorry, but I can’t tell you anything now!”Charlie said with a gloomy face. And I have something very important to deal with, so please make way. I will hold a press conference when the time is right to announce the news to the public!”

On one hand, Charlie was not in the mood to deal with these reporters. He was a little unhappy that they were blocking his way. On the other hand, he was also deliberately acting like he was in a bad mood, in preparation for his next step of announcing the news according to the plot he had designed.

The photojournalist faithfully recorded Charlie’s words into the camera.

Seeing that Charlie was in a bad mood, the reporters tactfully made way for him. Although they were known as the uncrowned Kings and often criticized the air, this depended on the person. A super big Shot like Charlie Koch was not someone a few small reporters could afford to offend. Furthermore, they were reporters from big media outlets like CNN, not paparazzi. Even if it was an ordinary interview target, they couldn’t chase after him.

Good led Charlie cohe through the crowd of reporters and directly arrived at the captain’s cabin.

“Mr. Coch, this is the captain’s cabin. No one will disturb you. You can use it as you wish.” Good said eagerly. The computer on the table can connect to the internet directly through the satellite. You can go online as soon as you turn it on!”

“Thank you very much!” Charlie cohe’s expression became a little more amiable.”Captain good, when you return to United States, you will receive the cohe group’s gratitude!”

“Thank you, Mr. Cohe!” Good said excitedly,”please come in! I won’t disturb you any longer ... I’ll be waiting outside at any time. If you need anything, just tell me!”

“Alright!” Charlie said.

He then quickly walked into the captain’s cabin and locked the door.

Charlie picked up the satellite phone and looked for the number Xia ruofei had just called. He immediately called back.
