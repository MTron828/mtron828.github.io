2273 Unified thinking (1)

No one in the Liu family, including Liu Chongli, who was in charge of the family’s Financial Group, dared to oppose the decision made by old man Liu.

Only the eldest son of the Liu family, Liu Qunfeng, could not help but ask,””Dad, it’s fine to give him the pharmaceutical company, but ... What if he takes the money and doesn’t do the job, or in the end he doesn’t ...”

Liu Qunfeng didn’t dare to continue. If Xia ruofei’s attack didn’t work, then there would only be one result. Elder Liu wouldn’t have much time left. How could Liu Qunfeng say such unlucky words?

“He won ‘t,” said old man Liu with a faint smile,”although it’s the first time I’ve met this young man, I’m still confident about it.” Moreover, if that was the case, would he be able to take over such a large Pharmaceutical Group? Even if my old bones enter the eight Treasures mountain, do you think that our Liu family will let others bully us like this?”

“Dad, don’t say such disheartened words.” “You’ll be fine!” Liu Qunfeng quickly said.

Old master Liu said nonchalantly,””I’ve lived for so long, I’ve already gotten over life and death. But I can’t leave so early! The huge business that I left behind is like a piece of fat meat that’s glistening with oil ...”

Liu Qunfeng couldn’t help but look a little ashamed as he said,””It’s all our fault for not being capable enough ...”

At this moment, Liu Lifang, who had been silent all this while, suddenly had her eyes lit up and said,”Oh right! A lot of the shares of our Pharmaceutical Group are in the hands of the affiliated companies, so we don’t have to transfer this part to him at all! It’s not even under our family’s name!”

Liu Lifang’s thinking was simple. She would try to minimize her losses.

The Liu family’s family group controlled many companies, both openly and secretly. Therefore, the equity structure of the pharmaceutical Group was also very complicated. From the public information, at least 30% to 40% of the shares were not in the hands of the Liu family. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

But in fact, the companies that held these shares were still controlled by the Liu family. The Liu family’s allocation of equity was just a routine operation for the purpose of risk control.

By right, when old man Liu agreed to give the pharmaceutical Group to Xia ruofei, he would be giving away the 60 to 70 percent of the shares that the Liu family held. As for the remaining shares, legally speaking, they were other people’s shares. You can’t expect me to give you other people’s money, right?

From this perspective, Liu Lifang’s words were not without reason.

After she said this, Liu qunyan, who also did not walk the path of the system, was even more enlightened. He slapped his thigh excitedly and said,””Don’t say it! This idea of little sister’s is really good!”

“That’s what I think!”Liu qunyan analyzed. This 30 to 40 percent of shares was worth at most 500 to 600 million Yuan. It was not a lot of money. However, the significance of keeping these shares is very great!”

After all, Liu Chongli had been in the business world for most of his life, and he suddenly felt that it was interesting. He said thoughtfully,”Qun Yan, you’re saying ... Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory ...”

“Second uncle, great minds think alike!” Liu qunyan said,”Xia ruofei asked for the pharmaceutical Group. His purpose is obvious! It’s to expand the scale and production capacity of their company’s pharmaceutical factory. If we retain a portion of the shares in the name of an affiliated company, when the time comes for the merger, it’ll be equivalent to us infiltrating paradise pharmaceutical factory! This pharmaceutical factory’s ability to make money is too terrifying, and it has never had any intention of financing. If we hold these shares, at the very least, we can ride on the rapid sales of the Yushi cream and heart – nourishing soup and make a lot of money! If we’re lucky, we might even be able to take this opportunity to slowly take over the Paradise pharmaceutical factory, or even the entire paradise Corporation!”

Liu Lifang was overjoyed and said triumphantly,”How is it? Isn’t this a good idea?”

Actually, Liu Lifang just felt bad for the money and wanted to give him as little as possible. She didn’t think so deeply! But after Liu qun’s analysis, Liu Lifang was very pleased that the shares still had such an important role.

Liu qun Yan, Liu Lifang, and a few other second – generation members of the family group started to discuss excitedly.

However, Liu Chongli realized that old man Liu had not said a word. He only looked at Liu Lifang, Liu qun Yan, and the others indifferently. There was even a hint of sadness in his eyes.

“Qun Yan, Li Fang, let’s not talk about this for now. Let’s listen to big brother’s opinion!” Liu Chongli quickly said.

“Yes, yes, yes!” Liu Lifang quickly asked,”dad, what do you think of my suggestion just now?”

Only then did old man Liu raise his eyes and look around.

The family members who met his eyes all involuntarily avoided his gaze. Some even lowered their heads slightly. Even though old master Liu was so sick that he was only skin and bones, once he exuded his might, the younger generation of the family would be afraid.

Even Liu Chongli, who was of the same generation as old master Liu, respected and feared this cousin of his.

Although Liu Chongli was old man Liu’s cousin, he was younger than old man Liu by more than ten years. When he was very young, he had followed old man Liu out. Although they were of the same generation, in life and work, old man Liu was more like his elder, and often taught him earnestly.
