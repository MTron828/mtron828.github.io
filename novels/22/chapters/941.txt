Translator: 549690339

Tan Lili heard this and quickly walked out from the crowd. Facing Tang Yitian’s powerful aura, she felt a sense of nervousness and couldn’t say anything.

Tang Yitian smiled and said in Chinese,””This lady, it doesn’t matter. What did this Wei nation man do to you just now, you can tell me boldly. You are Mr. Xia’s friend, and I will definitely seek justice for you.”

Hearing this, Yamada Jiro quickly said,”Mr. Tang, this is a mistake ...”

“Did I ask you?” Tang Yitian glanced at Yamada Jiro and said,”Tiger, make him shut up!”

To Tang Hu, Tang Yitian’s words were like golden rules.

He did not hesitate to take a napkin from the waiter’s tray and walk up to Yamada Jiro, who was his potential business partner and had a good relationship with him during this period. He slapped Yamada Jiro a few times and then stuffed his mouth with the napkin.

The crisp sound of the slap made the farm owners and winery owners ‘eyelids Twitch. They looked at Xia ruofei with respect.

“Ms. Tan, you tell us.” Tang Yitian looked at tan Lili again, his expression becoming more amiable.

Tan Lili finally mustered up her courage and told her everything. Yamada Jiro came to her to strike up a conversation, but he couldn ‘T. He was directly put on the lecherous act. He didn’t apologize after she saw him. Instead, he used his good relationship with Tang Hu to turn black into white.

Tang Yitian’s expression became more and more unsightly after hearing this. In the end, he couldn’t help but glare at Tang Hu.

“Tiger, is this the business partner you’ve found?” Tang Yitian said in a cold tone.

Tang Hu simply hated Yamada Jiro to the core right now, wishing he could swallow him alive.

However, before Tang Yitian spoke, he didn’t dare to act rashly. The only thing he could do was to lower his head and say in shame,””Fifth uncle, I was careless in making friends. Please punish me!”

“Hmph!” Tang Yitian coldly snorted and said,”I’ll settle this with you later!”

After he finished speaking, Tang Yitian looked at Xia ruofei and asked in a consulting tone,””Mr. Xia, this Wei nation Japanese man offended you and your friend, how do you want to deal with him?”

Xia ruofei glanced at Yamada Jiro and said,””Since this Japanese kid likes bed sports so much, then let him spend the rest of his life in bed!”

“Mr. Xia is too kind!” Tang Yitian quickly said.

Then, he looked at Tang Hu and said,”Tiger, do you know what to do?”

Tang Hu bowed without the slightest hesitation.”Fifth uncle, I understand!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Then, Tang Hu looked at Yamada Jiro without the slightest emotion, reached out, and pulled the napkin from his mouth.”Mr. Yamada, you can leave now, please!”

Yamada Jiro was well aware of Tang Hu’s strength. How could he not know what would happen to him after leaving the hotel?

So he practically rolled and crawled in front of Tang Hu, pleading: “Mr. Tang, I beg you to help me! We’re friends ...”

Tang Hu hated Yamada Jiro to the core. He frowned and kicked him away, saying,”I don’t have such a disgusting and perverted friend! I’ve already given you a chance to leave. If you don’t leave, then don’t ever go out again!”

Tang Hu’s eyes revealed a hint of ruthlessness, making Yamada Jiro’s heart tremble. He quickly said,”Mr. Tang, as long as you help me tell the Honorable Ethan ... Mr. Tang, please plead for me, I promise! We, the Yamada gang, will fully support your company’s expansion into the Wei nation market, and I can even make the decision to give you another 10% of the shares!”

“You’re still thinking of cooperating at this time? Even if you give me 100% of the shares, this cooperation is impossible!” Tang Hu sneered, then glanced coldly at Yamada Jiro and said,”Mr. Yamada, on account of our past friendship, I’ve already given you a chance to leave. However, my patience is limited. If you still don’t leave, don’t blame me for not remembering our old friendship ...”

“No... No, no, no... You ... You don’t have the right to override the law! You don’t even have the authority to use private means!” Yamada Jiro shouted hysterically.

The farm and winery owners all looked at Yamada Jiro as if he was an idiot.

Just now, when Yamada Jiro took advantage of his good relationship with Tang Hu and arrogantly turned black into white, even pulling out his gun without any scruples, why didn’t he think about the laws of the Australian Federation?

Now that he was in a disadvantageous position, he hoped that the law could protect him. How could there be such a good thing in the world?

Not to mention, he actually talked about the law with one of the big bosses of the righteous Association, Tang Hu? Wouldn’t this make people laugh their heads off?

Tang Hu’s bruised face revealed a terrifying smile. He slowly walked to Yamada Jiro and squatted down, then said word by word,”I don’t have the authority to do so, but don’t forget, this is Australia!”

This was Australia!

These five simple words made Yamada Jiro shiver. He could feel the intense killing intent in Tang Hu’s words. He was very clear that if he still tried to struggle, Tang Hu would really kill him.

Moreover, Tang Hu had a hundred ways to escape the law. He was a Wei nation man without any backing in Australia, so his death would be in vain!

Yamada Jiro finally felt fear from the bottom of his heart. He struggled to stand up and said,””Please don’t be angry, Mr. Tang. I ... I’ll leave now ...”

“I’ll give you five minutes to get out of the hotel. ” Tang Hu indifferently said.

Then, he didn’t look at Yamada Jiro again. He stood up and returned to Tang Yitian’s side, standing very respectfully with his hands by his side.

Yamada Jiro shuddered and ran out in a hurry. However, due to the fracture of his wrist and scapula, he staggered and had difficulty maintaining his balance. From the back, he looked like a stray dog.

Many of the farm owners and winery owners who were watching felt very happy when they saw this scene. They had long disliked Yamada Jiro’s arrogant behavior. Even as outsiders, they felt deeply ashamed when they saw Yamada Jiro’s arrogant face just now. They just did not dare to say it out loud.

Yamada Jiro didn’t dare to stay any longer. Before the five minutes were up, he ran out of the hotel on foot.

The next day, several local tabloids in Hunter Valley reported that Yamada Jiro, the head of the overseas business department of the Wei nation’s Yamada Corporation, had a serious car accident while driving under the influence of alcohol in Hunter Valley Bo Gobbin.

According to the report, Yamada Jiro’s Honda hit the roadside guardrail at high speed, and the thin Wei nation car was suddenly twisted into a fried dough twist. Yamada Jiro was also trapped in the driver’s seat. His legs had been squeezed for too long, and after he was rescued, they were almost dead. In the end, he had to undergo amputation.

And according to gossip, in addition to breaking both of Yamada Jiro’s legs, the thing under his crotch had also been seriously injured in the impact, and he had basically lost his sexual ability.

Of course, all of this was a story for later.

After returning to the hotel banquet hall, Yamada Jiro left like a stray dog. Xia ruofei felt the strange looks from the farm owners and winery owners around him and felt uncomfortable.

Xia ruofei had always been a person who kept a low profile. He was not used to being the center of attention.

When she was in China, she had to attend some local events when she was running a company. However, Xia ruofei had left these public events to the General Manager, Feng Jing.

Therefore, as the Paradise corporation’s reputation grew in the southeast province, not many people knew that the boss of this new company was Xia ruofei. On the other hand, Feng Jing was becoming more and more eye – catching in the business world of Sanshan city.

“Mr. Tang,” Xia ruofei said to Tang Yitian,”why don’t we find a quiet place to sit?” I just so happen to have something to tell you. ”

After saying that, Xia ruofei gently pinched Tang Haoran’s little face. Ever since they entered the house, little Haoran had been in Xia ruofei’s arms. This little guy seemed to be very close to Xia ruofei’s aura. Jennifer was afraid that Xia ruofei was tired, so she asked him to come down twice but he refused.

With Xia ruofei’s arm strength, he would not be tired even if he carried little Haoran for a whole day. So, he smiled and asked Jennifer to leave little Haoran alone.

“Okay, okay,” Tang Yitian said quickly.”There’s a resting room next door. Let’s go there now!”

Xia ruofei waved at Lin Qiao and Liang Qichao and said,””Qiao’ er, brother Liang, you guys should come over too!”

Since Tang Yitian was here, Xia ruofei naturally had to introduce him to Liang Qichao. With the channels of the Meiya group, it would be much easier for Paradise Farm to sell their products in the future.

Tang Hu led the way, and the farm owners and winery owners all gave way with a trace of respect. Xia ruofei and the others walked towards the banquet hall’s side door.

At this moment, the pale – faced Brody mustered his courage and walked out of the crowd. He stammered to Xia ruofei,””Mr. Xia, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I ... I didn’t know you were the Honorable Ethan. I’m sorry to have offended Mr. Tang’s friend just now ...”

When Brody saw how polite Tang Yitian was to Xia ruofei, or even how respectful he was, his heart sank.

He felt like a clown when he thought about how he had mocked and threatened Xia ruofei.

Of course, he was more afraid that Huahua only needed to talk to Xia ruofei. Although their family’s Golden Oak winery was the largest winery in the Hunter Valley area, in front of Tang Yitian’s Meiya group, such a small winery was no different from an ant in front of an elephant. Tang Yitian could make them go bankrupt with a single word.

If Xia ruofei was more ruthless, it would not be difficult for him to destroy their family. After all, Tang Hu’s reputation was well – known in New South Wales. How could a small wealthy family like him afford to offend him?

So after a fierce psychological struggle, Brodie braced himself and stood up, hoping that Xia ruofei would let him go by apologizing.

Xia ruofei stopped in his tracks and looked at Brody indifferently. He asked,””You mean, if I’m not Mr. Tang’s friend, you can covet my female companion? After being rejected, you can threaten to suppress my business and make my small winery go bankrupt?”

“No, no, no, I didn’t mean that, I didn’t mean that ...” Brody bowed and said. At this time, he was so regretful that his intestines were about to turn green. He hated Zheng Peng, who deliberately fanned the flames, to the bone.

If Zheng Peng had not told him that Xia ruofei was the owner of the West Winery and had just bought it from the old westerns, he would not have been so angry about his family’s failed acquisition. He would not have started to speak ill of Xia ruofei’s West Winery and even threatened to bankrupt it.

It could be said that everything had been secretly directed by Zheng Peng.

Tang Yitian frowned. His eyes were like lightning as he glanced at Brodie and coldly asked,””What’s going on? What did you do to Mr. Xia just now? Speak!”
