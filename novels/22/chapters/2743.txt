2744 A direct confrontation (2)

If that was the case, Xia ruofei’s breakthrough process had only lasted three to five minutes!

He completed the breakthrough just like that?

It was even easier than eating and drinking, right?

What was even more outrageous was that Luo Qingfeng felt that his palm had clearly hit Xia ruofei. Even if his palm did not touch Xia ruofei’s back, the primordial Qi that seeped out of his body had firmly imprinted itself on Xia ruofei’s back.

During the process of breaking through, he suffered a heavy blow on his back, but not only was he not injured, but he also did not suffer from Qi deviation. Moreover, he easily broke through the shackles of a major realm within three to five minutes?

Did it have to be so fierce?

Seeing this scene, Luo Qingfeng felt that his cultivation knowledge system was about to collapse.

Luo Qingfeng could not help but look deeply at Xia ruofei again to confirm that what he saw was not an illusion. Xia ruofei had indeed broken through, and it seemed that his cultivation was very solid. His cultivation was higher than Xia ruofei ‘s, so it was not difficult to see this.

However, Luo Qingfeng did not dwell on Xia ruofei’s breakthrough any longer. He snorted and said,””So what if you’ve broken through? The true Qi in your body hasn’t even been transformed into vital Qi, so how much combat power can you improve? If I were you, since I’ve broken through by luck, I would hide and consolidate my cultivation, working hard to transform more true Qi into origin Qi, and not be so arrogant that I think I can arm – wrestle with you just because I’ve broken through!”

At this point, Luo Qingfeng looked at Xia ruofei with contempt and asked,””I’m guessing that you’ve only converted one – thousandth of your true Qi into Yuan Qi, right? You haven’t even consolidated your cultivation base and you dare to jump out. You’re truly an ignorant person!”

Although there would not be any bottlenecks in the whole process from the successful Foundation establishment to the complete transformation of true Qi into primordial Qi, it was still Quite time – consuming. This was because this transformation could only be completed slowly with solid cultivation, and it was a test of patience.

It took Luo Qingfeng three years to completely convert the vital energy in his body into vital energy.

It had only been a few minutes since Xia ruofei broke through. Luo Qingfeng felt that he had overestimated Xia ruofei by saying that it was one in a thousand.

“Ah? One in a thousand?” Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, then said weakly,”I don’t think I have so little! It should have been converted to about 10%!”

“Pfft ...” Luo Qingfeng felt like he was about to vomit blood. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Ten percent?” “What?” Luo Qingfeng was in disbelief.”Are you sure you’re not exaggerating?”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”what’s there to exaggerate?” It’s only 10%. It’s already very embarrassing, okay? If I wanted to exaggerate a little, I wouldn’t say such a low number! You should at least say 70 – 80%!”

Although Qingfeng Luo did not know what “low” meant, he could more or less guess it from the context. At least, he could confirm that it was not a good word.

10% and it’s still “missing”? Then how can you let me, who can only convert one – thousandth of a favor every day, bear it? ‘Luo Qingfeng thought to himself.

Was there really such a huge difference between people? Luo Qingfeng was speechless.

Luo Qingfeng, who had recovered from the shock, returned to his cold expression. He snorted and said,””So what if it’s ten percent? I will let you truly experience the gap between you and a real Aurous core stage cultivator!”

After saying that, Luo Qingfeng did not say anything more. Instead, he took the initiative to attack Xia ruofei.

Luo Qingfeng could already feel that things were getting out of his control. This feeling was extremely unpleasant. He felt that it was necessary for him to take the initiative of the situation. As long as he could get rid of Xia ruofei, he would naturally have the initiative.

Luo Qingfeng’s speed was extremely fast, and he had rich combat experience, but Xia ruofei did not panic.

He was not trying to act dumb or cute just now. In fact, he had already used his spiritual power to communicate with the core array disc and adjusted all the intact formations of the Taixu xuanqing formation to his surroundings.

However, Xia ruofei was not in a hurry to activate the formation.

He had made a breakthrough in his cultivation, but he had never really fought a golden core cultivator like Qingfeng Luo. He wanted to see how much his strength had improved and how big the gap was between him and Qingfeng Luo.

Therefore, when Luo Qingfeng closed in on him, Xia ruofei did not retreat.

Luo Qingfeng appeared in front of Xia ruofei in the blink of an eye. His palms struck toward Xia ruofei’s face with a cold wind. The Qi in his body was flowing as if it had sealed off all of Xia ruofei’s escape routes. It was obvious that it was a very advanced martial art technique.

Xia ruofei took a deep breath and moved his feet at will. He dodged casually and easily avoided Luo Qingfeng’s attack.

Floating steps!

This was the first time that Xia ruofei had used the floating steps in a battle. He had already practiced this movement technique to an extremely proficient level when he was breaking through the array. Before Luo Qingfeng’s attack arrived, he had subconsciously used this movement technique.

Luo Qingfeng was slightly stunned. He did not expect Xia ruofei’s movement technique to be so profound.

However, he didn’t stop. He took advantage of the situation and kicked to the side. He wanted to attack Xia ruofei before he could steady himself.

However, Xia ruofei seemed to have anticipated his next move. He still easily dodged and appeared behind him. His movement was so fast and his trajectory was so mysterious that even Luo Qingfeng could not see any traces of it. It was as if it was natural.

Naturally, Xia ruofei would not be passively beaten up. He now occupied an advantageous attacking position, so he punched Luo Qingfeng’s back without hesitation.

Luo Qingfeng was also very observant. He tilted his body slightly and extended his forearm to accurately block Xia ruofei’s powerful punch.

Xia ruofei suddenly felt a strong rebound force. He could not help but take five or six steps back before he could stabilize himself. His fist was in pain as if the bones in his fingers had been cracked.

Xia ruofei could not help but sigh. He knew that although he had broken through, the conversion rate of his vital energy to vital Qi was still too low. He was still lacking when it came to a direct confrontation with a golden core cultivator like Luo Qingfeng.

What Xia ruofei did not know was that Luo Qingfeng’s shock could not be any greater.

In the first head – on collision just now, Luo Qingfeng had thought that even if Xia ruofei was not bragging and had really transformed 10% of his genuine Qi into primordial Qi, he would not be able to fight him head – on. He had just injected primordial Qi into his forearm. Even if Xia ruofei had taken the initiative to attack and he had only blocked it, Xia ruofei would have been sent flying under normal circumstances. Even if the bones of that fist were not broken, it would at least cause a fracture. At the very least, it should have made Xia ruofei’s fist red and swollen.

Although Xia ruofei took a few steps back and his fist seemed to hurt from the impact, that was all. After shaking his fist, he seemed to be fine again.

Was this really just ten percent of his true Qi? Luo Qingfeng was speechless.

He felt that even if Xia ruofei’s genuine Qi had been converted into primordial Qi, his body could not be so strong!

It should be known that not only had all of his true Qi been transformed into primordial Qi, but the most important thing was that the embryonic form of the Golden core had already been formed in his dantian. The formation of this vortex would also increase the strength of the cultivator by several times, because this marked the official entry into the Golden core stage. Even the level of life had evolved.

Luo Qingfeng naturally did not know that Xia ruofei’s “great Dao Arts” was of a much higher level than his own. The vital Qi produced by the two was also of a completely different level. In addition, Xia ruofei had been practicing the little golden man’s body – tempering movements all this while. The strength of his body was not inferior to that of the other golden core cultivators.

Seeing that close – range attacks were ineffective, Qingfeng Luo immediately changed his strategy.

Xia ruofei also felt an extremely dangerous aura. He did not hesitate to activate his floating steps to the maximum. The next moment, he felt a cold light almost brushing past his waist. He could clearly feel the biting cold aura through his clothes.

Xia ruofei was furious. An Aurous core stage cultivator was using a flying sword against a cultivator who had just broken through to the Foundation Stage? Furthermore, he had even launched a sneak attack. He had simply lost all the face of an Aurous core stage cultivator!

You have a flying sword, do you think I don ‘t?

Xia ruofei did not hesitate. With a slight thought, the blue travel immortal sword that had been nourishing in his dantian flew out and accurately hit meteor sword, who had just made a wrong move and was about to change its direction to attack again ...
