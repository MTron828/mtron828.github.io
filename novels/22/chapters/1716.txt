Chapter 1717: Qiuhang’s reward (1)

When the two cars arrived at the main building of the staff area, the Senior Vice President of the staff was already waiting for them. It was evident how much importance the staff placed on Xia ruofei. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

When Tony saw that the company’s Mercedes – Benz was followed by a luxurious custom extended Bentley, he could not help but be stunned.

Soon, the car came to a stop. Tony walked up to him and realized that Xia ruofei had gotten out of the Bentley behind. He paused for a moment, then quickly changed his direction and walked towards Xia ruofei.

“Mr. Xia, welcome to the Quto headquarters!” Tony had a warm smile on his face as he asked,”how have you been in Australia these few days?”

“Very good! The scenery in Australia is very charming!” Xia ruofei replied with a smile in fluent English.

At this time, Tang Yitian and Li Yifu also got out of the car. Tony, who was shaking hands with Xia ruofei, couldn’t help but stop for a moment. He couldn’t believe his eyes.

Tang Yitian was a well – known rich man in Australia, and almost everyone in the business world knew him. Tony and Tang Yitian had met several times.

Although Tony was also a senior executive of the giant, Air Australia, it was a national airline. Strictly speaking, Tony was only a senior employee, a “state – owned enterprise leader.” Of course, his salary was definitely much higher than the average civil servant.

And the Meia group, which was no smaller than qaustro airlines, was an enterprise that Tang Yitian had absolute control over.

Comparing the two, Tang Yitian and Tony were not on the same level.

Tony didn’t expect Xia ruofei to be so close to Tang Yitian that Tang Yitian would even personally accompany him to a press conference.

Of course, Tony, like his Secretary, did not recognize Lee Yifu, who was all – Powerful in the United States. Otherwise, he would have been even more shocked.

Tony quickly shook Xia ruofei’s hand and turned to Tang Yitian. He said with a smile,””Mr. Tang, I didn’t expect you to come here in person! Welcome, welcome!”

Tang Yitian smiled faintly and pointed at Xia ruofei,””I’m free today, so I came over with my good friend to take a look.”

“Mr. Tony, this is the United States of the Kyushu group, Mr. Yifu li. He’s also my elder!” Tang Yitian introduced.

Tony could not help but be slightly shocked, and he quickly greeted Li Yifu.

Li Yifu had almost never asked about business matters in recent years, so his exposure rate was not high. However, the Kyushu group was a well – known Financial Group and had a pivotal position in the American business world. Tony naturally did not dare to neglect it.

With two important figures accompanying Xia ruofei, Tony’s respect for Xia ruofei had increased.

After everyone exchanged a few words, Tony warmly invited the three of them to his office.

Tony’s office was located on the top floor of the Australian Airlines headquarters building. It had an area of 200 to 300 square meters and a glass curtain wall that allowed him to overlook the entire Australian Airlines headquarters Park. The view was quite good.

Tony invited everyone to their seats in the guest area and said,””Mr. Xia, the press conference will start in about half an hour, so I’ll make it short!”

“Alright,” Xia ruofei smiled.

Tony looked at Xia ruofei and said,”this time, we’ll be announcing the reward for those who have made contributions. The initial confirmation for Mr. Xia’s reward is as follows: ” Xia ruofei, you’re welcome. The cash reward is 2 million Australian dollars ...”

Tang Yitian raised his eyebrows when he heard the number, but he didn’t interrupt Tony. He listened patiently.

According to the exchange rate, 2 million Australian dollars was equivalent to 10 million Chinese dollars. It was not a small number and was about the same as the international standard. It was even a little higher, perhaps because Xia ruofei’s contribution this time was too great.

However, this amount of money was too little in Tang Yitian’s eyes. After all, Xia ruofei’s position in his heart had unknowingly become more respected.

“Qiuhang will grant Mr. Xia the title of ‘honorary passenger’. Mr. Xia can take our company’s flights for free for the rest of his life. At the same time, when you take Huan Yu one family’s other Allied company flights, you will also enjoy VIP treatment and a 50% discount on your ticket!” Tony continued.

“Huan Yu one family” was an international airline alliance established by qindustan in 1999. It included five members of air United States, air United Kingdom, Air Pacific, Air Canada, and air Australia. The Alliance company cooperated and shared flight time, ticketing, code sharing, passenger transfer flights, airport VIP rooms, and many other aspects.

In other words, with the title of “honorary passenger”, Xia ruofei would not only be able to ride on qplease’s plane for free for the rest of his life, but he would also be able to enjoy a 50% discount on the other four Alliance companies ‘flights. He would also be able to enjoy VIP Services such as the VIP room.

Of course, Xia ruofei did not take international flights often, so he only smiled and nodded at the reward. He was not too surprised.

Tony carefully observed Xia ruofei’s expression and said,””Of course, we’ve also prepared a little surprise for Mr. Xia. Please forgive me for keeping you in suspense and leaving some suspense. I’m sure Mr. Xia will like it!”

“Oh? I’m looking forward to it!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I have no objections to this reward plan. I also thank your company for its generosity!”
