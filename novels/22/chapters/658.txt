Chapter 659: The shocked Jianghua (2)

“It’s really good!” Xia ruofei complimented and turned to Feng Rao.”CEO Feng, after seeing Jianghua’s performance, I’m even more confident in raising Chinese perch!”

“Are you trying to say that you’ve got a good eye for talent?” Feng Rao chuckled.

“Hahaha!” Xia ruofei laughed.”Don’t try to get a personal idol!”

Feng Rao’s face blushed slightly as she pouted and said, “Who’s worshiping you ...”

Jiang Hua and the others had a strange look on their faces. Jiang Hua said unnaturally,””That ... CEO Xia, CEO Feng, I’ll go and fish up the fish that are turning white so that they won’t affect the other fish ...”

With that, he ran off with a net bag.

Pang Hao and the others also bade farewell and left. The workers pretended to be busy and dispersed, regardless of whether they had anything to do.

Xia ruofei looked at Feng Jing awkwardly. Wasn’t he just joking? What’s with your expressions? Isn’t his mind too dirty?

Feng Rao blushed and glared at Xia ruofei. Just as she was about to find an excuse to leave, she heard Jiang Hua’s soft exclamation.

Xia ruofei and Feng Rao looked at each other and quickly walked over.

As they were already close to the pond, Xia ruofei did not dare to raise his voice. He asked in a low voice,””Jiang Hua, what’s wrong?”

Jiang Hua turned around in shock and said,”Director Xia, the survival rate of your batch of fish is too high! There’s only one fish in this pond that has turned white, and there are only three fish in the other ponds ...”

Jiang Hua had been in this line of work for many years. Every time young fish were transported or adult fish caught, they had to be very careful. Pomfrets were very timid. In the past, when some breeders reared them in the open, they would usually turn hundreds of them white with a single Thunder.

......

In the process of transporting the fish, due to the bumpy journey and other reasons, the survival rate of the fish would be very good if it could reach about 90%.

Jiang Hua had never heard of such a small fry that could only turn white out of a thousand.

Xia ruofei wasn’t surprised at all. This was a baby salamander that had been born and lived in the spirit map for such a long time! Just the spirit Qi they had absorbed during this period of time had made their bodies much stronger than ordinary clam fish.

However, after Jiang Hua’s explanation, Feng Rao was very surprised. She could not help but look at Xia ruofei a few more times. She felt that this Chairman seemed to be able to show extraordinary abilities from time to time. Xia ruofei’s image in her eyes was becoming more and more mysterious.

In any case, after Jiang Hua’s shock, the little embarrassment disappeared.

However, Jiang Hua was destined to be shocked again and again today.

He carefully fished out the fish that had turned white and couldn’t help but let out a cry of surprise after taking a look. Then, he threw away the net and grabbed the dead fish that had come out of the water and looked at it for a long time.

“Jiang Hua, what’s wrong this time?” Feng Rao couldn’t help asking.

Jiang Hua turned a deaf ear to his words. He picked up a few other kun fish that had already turned white and was now looking at them.

Jiang Hua only came back to his senses after Feng Rao called him a few times.

However, he was not in the mood to answer Feng Jing. He looked at Xia ruofei in shock and asked,””President Xia ... This ... This ... Isn’t this an United States Chinese perch? If I’m not wrong, this is an authentic Yangtze River salamander fish?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”yeah!” I didn’t say that we’re going to breed United States rays. Is there a problem?” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Jiang Hua’s heart was like a turbulent wave, and his excitement was overflowing in his words. He stuttered,”C – President Xia, are these really Chinese perch?”

At present, most of the Chinese pomfrets, or all of the Chinese pomfrets, were imported from the United States the reason was simple: the Chinese pomfrets in the Yangtze River had almost gone extinct more than a decade ago.

Although they were the same species and even had similar DNA structures, in fact, whether it was in terms of taste or freshness, the United States pomfrets could not be compared with the real wild Yangtze River pomfrets.

At present, there were no large quantities of Chinese perch on the market. The price of cultivated United States stingers was very expensive. At its most expensive, it was more than 2000 Yuan per 500 grams. Later, as the number of farmers increased, the price decreased, but it was still at least a few hundred Yuan per 500 grams.

That was the price of United States perch. If it was authentic Chinese perch, it would be priceless even if it was ten times more expensive.

It was no wonder Jiang Hua was so shocked.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””I’m sure that these baby fishes are the most authentic Chinese perch, and they’re bred in an artificial wild environment.”

“Oh my God ... This ... This is unbelievable.” Jiang Hua’s lips trembled as he spoke.

“Jiang Hua, is there a big difference between the Chinese perch and the United States one?” Feng Rao asked curiously.

Jiang Hua replied without hesitation,”one is heaven and the other is earth!” The Chinese perch was a delicacy that money couldn’t buy, but the United States perch had been successfully imported and could be cultivated on a large scale! A conservative estimate would be that the price difference is ten times!”

Feng Rao’s beautiful eyes could not help but reveal a look of shock. Her cherry – like mouth was slightly agape and could not close for a long time.

If the difference was ten times, that would be a few thousand Yuan per catty. If a thousand fish grew to two or three catties, it would be ten to twenty million Yuan!
