3368 Chain mission (2)

Translator: 5496903He couldn’t help but reveal a bitter smile as he thought to himself,”It seemed like he would have to modify the array himself ...

This was obviously more time – consuming, but it was still faster than using brute force to remove the camel’s thorns bit by bit.

Seeing that Xia ruofei was deep in thought, Ling Qingxue did not dare to disturb him. She stood quietly at the side.

It was naturally not easy to modify a new formation.

Xia ruofei took out two chairs from the spirit map space and said,””Qingxue, let’s sit down and rest for a while! I need to think about how to set up the formation!”

Ling Qingxue replied obediently,”yes!” There’s no hurry, you can think about it slowly. No one’s urging us anyway ...”

As soon as she finished speaking, Xia ruofei saw another line of words in his perceptual mirror: [The trial tower’s fifth level chain mission has begun. First level, bi an has cracked the star Fern thorn ring and has received the trial tower’s fourth level mission reward. The time limit for the mission is eight hours. If the star Fern thorn ring is not cracked by the time limit, the mission will be considered a failure and the trial tower’s journey will end. After four hours, the mission reward at the center of the star Fern thorn ring will gradually decrease as time passes. If the time limit is four hours, the first level mission will be considered completed, but the mission reward for the trial tower’s fourth level will be canceled.]

Xia ruofei did not know whether to laugh or cry. He looked at Ling Qingxue and smiled bitterly.”Qingxue, your mouth is really blessed! Whatever I say comes ...”

“What’s wrong?” Ling Qingxue was confused.

Xia ruofei said,”I just received a mission prompt. This thing that looks like a camel’s thorn is called the star Fern thorn. Solving this star Fern thorn loop is the first part of the chain mission on the trial tower’s fifth level. We have to complete it within eight hours. Otherwise, we will be judged as failing the trial and will be sent out of the trial tower. Moreover, we’d better complete it within four hours. Otherwise, after four hours, the rewards for the next level will gradually decrease until it’s completely canceled. ”

Ling Qingxue’s eyes widened. She already knew that Xia ruofei had received the perceptual mirror as a reward when he had completed the mission and could receive the mission notification immediately. However, she was still very surprised by the mission’s restriction.

“It can’t be!” Ling Qingxue said,”that’s the reward for the trial Pagoda’s fourth level. Why should we be restricted by the fifth level’s mission? This doesn’t make sense!”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”the rules are set by others. Whether they’re reasonable or not, it’s up to them.” Besides, you just said that we didn’t go through any dangerous tests on the 4th level, so it doesn’t matter if we get the reward or not!”

“I was just saying!” Ling Qingxue pouted.”We’ve all completed the mission, and we’ve even broken the record. Why shouldn’t we be rewarded?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”that’s right. That’s why we should get rid of these star Fern thorns as soon as possible. We just have to complete the mission within the stipulated time. That’s all.” No one can stop us from taking away the rewards that belong to us!”

Xia ruofei’s heroic spirit reached the clouds. Ling Qingxue saw this and could not help but reveal a confused expression. She looked at Xia ruofei and said,””I believe you can do it! Good luck!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”sit down and rest. I need to think about the formation ...”

“Let’s just use the time array flag!” Ling Qingxue said,”that way, you’ll have a lot more time!”

Xia ruofei slapped his forehead and said,”that’s true ... My brain seems to have short – circuited today!” I need you to remind me every time. Maybe I’m too excited to see my wife ... Hehe!”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but roll her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,”The countdown has already started, and you’re still in the mood to talk? Hurry up and set up the formation!”

Xia ruofei chuckled and took out the time array flags from the spirit map space. With a wave of his hand, the array flags landed accurately in their respective positions.

Now that Xia ruofei was extremely familiar with the time formation, he could set it up with a wave of his hand. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Xia ruofei grabbed the chair with one hand and smiled at Ling Qingxue.””Qingxue, you can wait outside the formation! This way, we won’t have to wait that long!”

Ling Qingxue nodded and clenched her fist to cheer Xia ruofei on.

Xia ruofei took the chair and stepped into the formation. Then, he sat down and started to deduce the transformation plan in his mind.

He then took out a pen and paper from the spirit map space and quickly wrote down some of the thoughts in his mind. He then began to draw and calculate on the paper.

Xia ruofei was completely immersed in the knowledge of arrays and had completely forgotten the passage of time.

By the time he finished his last stroke, there was already a pile of crumpled waste paper around him. At the same time, there were already twenty to thirty pieces of useful manuscript paper.

Xia ruofei’s eyes showed a trace of satisfaction. After some complicated calculations, he had finally combined the three formations. This new formation could have a radius of three kilometers and was mainly used for fire attacks.

Xia ruofei had also used the black flames in the trap and kill array as a reference. This new array was extremely powerful in terms of fire attacks.

Xia ruofei picked up all the pieces of paper and looked through them one by one. At the same time, he ran through them in his mind to make sure that there were no obvious mistakes. Then, he flicked the paper in satisfaction, stood up, and walked out of the array.

“RUO Fei, have you thought of what formation to use?” Ling Qingxue came up to him and asked.

Ling Qingxue did not know that Xia ruofei wanted to create a new array. Even though it was not created out of thin air, it was still very impressive to modify and integrate the original array. After all, the array diagrams of the predecessors had been tempered thousands of times. It was easier said than done to change the structure inside, retain the function one wanted, and add the attributes of other arrays.

Ling Qingxue was unaware of all this, but she still admired Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei smiled.”I’ve prepared an array. I don’t know how powerful it is and whether it can deal with the star Fern thorn ring. But it’s worth a try. Oh, right ...”

Xia ruofei glanced at Ling Qingxue and asked,””How long have I been in there?”

“Exactly 30 minutes!” Ling Qingxue replied without hesitation.

Xia ruofei was shocked. The time array flags he had set up could provide a time flow difference of 90 times. That meant that he had been in the time array for 45 hours, which was almost two days and two nights!

Xia ruofei was completely immersed in the ocean of knowledge of arrays and did not feel the passage of time. He thought that he had only been in there for a short while. Compared to the outside world, time did not seem to have passed at all! He didn’t expect it to be nearly two days and two nights.

After reaching the Golden core stage, Xia ruofei was close to fasting. Even if he did not eat for a few days, as long as he could replenish his spiritual energy, there would be no problem at all. Therefore, it was equivalent to two days of closed – door cultivation. He did not feel hungry even if he did not eat or drink.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei had the time array flag. Otherwise, four hours wouldn’t even be enough to study an array. He might not even be able to design an array before the time was up and he would be teleported away.

It took him half an hour just to study the formation theory. Xia ruofei felt even more pressed for time.

He said,”then I have to hurry and prepare the materials needed to set up the formation!” Qingxue, you should rest for a while more! After I’ve cleaned up these star Fern thorns, I’ll find some time to accompany you properly!”

“En!” Ling Qingxue nodded and said,”there’s no need to be anxious. You can’t eat hot tofu if you’re anxious. There’s still enough time now!”

“I got it!” Xia ruofei nodded.

Then, he stepped into the time formation and took out a large number of formation materials from the spirit map space. He began to process them.

After another three hours, which was about two minutes in the outside world, Xia ruofei finally finished preparing the materials for the formation.

With a wave of his hand, he removed the time formation and smiled at Ling Qingxue.””Qingxue! The formation is ready, I’ll set it up now, just wait and see these star Fern thorns burn you in flames!”
