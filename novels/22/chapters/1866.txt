“Secretary Zeng, there’s nothing that I can’t figure out. I’ll follow the organization’s decision!” Wu Liqian said indifferently.

Although she didn’t say anything out of anger, Wu Liqian’s attitude clearly showed her dissatisfaction.

Zeng jianzhang smiled and said,”it’s normal that you can’t figure it out!” It would be abnormal if she could figure it out! If something similar happened to me, I would be even more confused!”

Wu Liqian looked at Zeng jianzhang quietly, waiting for him to continue.

Zeng jianzhang continued,”comrade Liqian, I can’t figure it out, but as a party member and leader, I still hope that you can look at the big picture.” In the current situation, what was the overall situation? I think for our Changping County, the Tao Yuan pharmaceutical factory is the current big picture. No matter how aggrieved we are, we can’t affect the big picture ...”

Wu Liqian immediately understood Zeng jianzhang’s intention. She furrowed her brows and said,””Secretary Zeng, you should know what kind of person I am. Public and private matters are separate matters. I definitely wouldn’t do something like backstabbing. However, since Secretary Zeng has said so much, I’ll also make a stand. I will definitely not drag down the Tao Yuan pharmaceutical factory project. I can guarantee it with my party spirit!”

Zeng jianzhang heaved a sigh of relief. In fact, he was most worried about this point. Wu Liqian being able to facilitate such a project meant that she at least had good communication with peach blossom company. He was afraid that the soon – to – ripen peach would be picked by Liu haojun, and Wu Liqian would be so angry that she would fight to the death and exaggerate the situation to peach blossom company. She would rather let this project fall into the hands of others than let Liu haojun gain his achievements for nothing.

Although Zeng jianzhang was neutral most of the time in the dispute between Wu Liqian and Liu haojun, he didn’t want to see the project go to waste because of their personal grudges, which would damage the interests of Changping County.

That was why he had immediately called Wu Liqian over to appease her after the meeting with the Standing Committee.

Zeng jianzhang waved his hand and said,”you’re too serious!” That was too serious! Comrade Liqian, I know you better than anyone else. You’ve always been a leader with a strong sense of the big picture, and you’re full of righteousness and self – respect. You wouldn’t do such petty things!”

“Thank you for the compliment, Secretary Zeng ...” Wu Liqian said, neither obsequious nor overbearing.

It would be a lie to say that she didn’t have any resentment in her heart. Wu Liqian didn’t have a good impression of Zeng jianzhang, who had directly appointed Liu haojun to be in charge of this project, so her attitude was a little cold.

Zeng jianzhang also noticed it. He sighed and said with a bitter smile,””Comrade Liqian, I handed this project directly to Secretary Liu at the Standing Committee meeting today because I had my own difficulties ... I hope you can understand that there are many things that I can’t decide as a Secretary. “What I can tell you is that when County Head Zhu came to report to me last night, the two of us came to an agreement. We hope that you can follow this project to the end. County Head Zhu can also prove this ...”

In the officialdom, people usually only spoke a little, because that was the only way to turn things around. However, Zeng jianzhang’s words were almost clear, and his attitude could be said to be very sincere.

Wu Liqian said,”Secretary Zeng, you don’t have to explain so much to me. Please don’t worry. I won’t let my emotions get into my work. Besides, I’m happy to see the peach blossom company’s project go smoothly. As for whether I’m in charge or not, it’s not important.”

Wu Liqian’s words came from the bottom of her heart.

In fact, when she heard that Liu haojun had taken the project away, for a moment, Wu Liqian really had the urge to call Xia ruofei and put pressure on Changping County through him. However, she calmed down very quickly.

Not only was this project important to Changping County, but it was also important to Xia ruofei and the Paradise Corporation. If they could use the preferential policy that the Standing Committee had decided on to bring in the pharmaceutical factory project, it would definitely be a great benefit to the Paradise Corporation. She felt that she could not ruin this matter for her personal reasons.

In addition, if the peach blossom company’s project was to be located in Changping County, there would be many opportunities for the company to interact with the county in the future. Wu Liqian did not want Xia ruofei to ruin the relationship with the county because of her, which might be disadvantageous to the peach blossom company in the future.

After much consideration, Wu Liqian decided not to tell Xia ruofei and wanted the project to be finalized as soon as possible.

To Zeng jianzhang, these words were not so credible. Even a man made of mud would have some temper. Liu haojun’s table manners were so ugly, and Wu Liqian was not an otherworldly fairy. How could she be so high and mighty?

However, no matter what, Wu Liqian’s stance was still quite politically correct, and he couldn’t find any fault with it.

Zeng jianzhang pondered for a while and said,””Comrade Liqian, thank you for your understanding! I hope that you won’t be affected by this matter and continue to work hard for the construction of Changping County! “Also, the next step of the county government might be to fine – tune the division of labor for the Deputy County Head. County Head Zhu also recognizes your work ability, so you have to be mentally prepared to take on more responsibilities!”

There were a lot of things that could not be solved with words, and Zeng jianzhang had always believed in this.

This time, Wu Liqian had obviously suffered a big loss. In order to appease Wu Liqian, those high – sounding words were naturally of no use. Zeng jianzhang thought that in the end, it would still fall on the distribution of benefits. Since you’ve suffered a loss here, then I’ll make it up to you in other ways!

Although Wu Liqian was in charge of more important areas, some key departments were still under the charge of several other Deputy County heads. This time, Zeng jianzhang and Zhu zhihang reached a consensus to make some minor adjustments to the division of labor for the Deputy County Head and assign a few more important departments to Wu Liqian.

To put it bluntly, it was to find a balance.

Wu Liqian didn’t look particularly happy after hearing this. She just said indifferently,””I’ll follow the organization’s arrangements. I’d like to thank Secretary Zeng and County Head Zhu for their trust in me ...”

Such a statement could only be said to be reasonable, but Zeng jianzhang was already very satisfied. He said with a smile,””For a young and promising cadre like you, we should take on more responsibilities. Only then can you mature quickly!”

“Thank you for your encouragement, Secretary Zeng!” Wu Liqian said in a neither humble nor arrogant manner, then asked,”Secretary Zeng, do you have any other instructions?”

“There’s nothing else ... Comrade Liqian, you can go back to work!”Zeng jianzhang quickly said.

“Then I’ll head back to the government first.” Wu Liqian stood up and said,”goodbye, Secretary Zeng!”

Zeng jianzhang personally sent Wu Liqian to the door of the office, then secretly heaved a sigh of relief. From the looks of it, Youyou had done a good job of appeasing Wu Liqian. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

There was no such thing as an impervious wall in this world. Soon, the incident at the Standing Committee had spread throughout the county party Committee and the county government. Everyone looked at Wu Liqian in a different light. Some secretly felt sorry for her, some gloated at her misfortune, and some even ignored the matter that had nothing to do with them ...

Wu Liqian ignored everyone’s gazes. After returning to the government office building, she went straight to her office.

After she sat down, she took out her phone and called Xia ruofei.

“Sister Qian! Do you have good news for me?” Xia ruofei answered and asked with a smile.

“The meeting with the Standing Committee just ended,” Wu Liqian said with a smile,”the county has already come to a decision on the pharmaceutical factory project. They’ve agreed to acquire the land according to your proposal, and they’ll also give you a certain discount on the land transfer fee. In addition, the county has also taken the initiative to propose a series of preferential policies, including tax exemption and so on. The county still values your company very much!”

“I knew it was good news!” Xia ruofei said happily,”thank you, sister Qian!”

“Don’t thank me, I didn’t help much!” Wu Liqian smiled and said,”it’s mainly because your project is too attractive. “Ruofei, I still have something to do here, so I won’t talk to you anymore. Someone will contact you soon to discuss some specific details ...”

“Alright, I got it!” Xia ruofei said. Then, he frowned and asked,”wait! Sister Qian, aren’t you the one who’s going to connect with our company?”
