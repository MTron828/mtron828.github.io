Chapter 1715: Unfathomable_1

“You’re inviting me to your press conference?”Xia ruofei was stunned.

“Yes, Mr. Xia, you’re the star of this press conference ...” The female secretary on the other end of the phone said.

“Wait!” Xia ruofei interrupted her and asked,”how did I become the main character in your quaohang press conference? Besides ... Didn’t we already hold a press conference for the incident last time?”

The Secretary did not dare to be impatient and explained patiently,””It’s like this, Mr. Xia. We’re going to announce the preliminary investigation results at this press conference. At the same time, we’re going to announce the rewards for the relevant personnel who handled this special case. The most important one is your reward.”

The female secretary paused and continued,””In addition, the news media has been continuously reporting on this incident for the past few days, and the public is full of curiosity about you. All the media hope that you can personally answer a few questions, so ...”

Xia ruofei said,”I understand. The press conference is tomorrow, right?” I will participate!”

The Secretary secretly heaved a sigh of relief. She was worried that Xia ruofei would decline and then have to put in some effort!

In the eyes of Westerners, Chinese people were the kind of modest and reserved people. They would usually reject such things like showing their faces in public. They did not expect Xia ruofei to agree so readily.

“Thank you!” The Secretary quickly said,”Mr. Xia, I heard you’re in Hunter Valley? Can you provide an address? We’ll send a car to pick you up tomorrow!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said -“there’s no need to. I’m in toteny now. Send me the time and place of the press conference tomorrow.-‘Ll go there myself!”

“You’re in the dutani? That’s great!” The female secretary said sweetly,”but we’ll still send a car to pick you up! Please tell me the address! This is also the task Mr. Tony gave me!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”then I’ll text you later!” I’ll have to ask for the address ...”

“Alright! Sorry to trouble you, Mr. Xia!” The female secretary said.

“You’re welcome,” Xia ruofei smiled and hung up.

When he walked back to the dining room, Tang Yitian asked,””RUO Fei, what’s wrong? What’s the matter?”

“It’s from quodan,”Xia ruofei said with a smile. They said that there’s a press conference tomorrow and they want me to attend. ”

“The hijacking a few days ago?” Tang Yitian laughed and said,”I don’t think this qiuhang is reliable. The co – Pilot committed suicide with all the passengers on board! It’s better not to take their company’s plane in the future ...”

Xia ruofei rolled his eyes.”You’re a rich man with a private jet. Don’t you feel guilty saying that?”

Everyone burst into laughter.

At this time, Tang Haoran, who had just woken up, rubbed his sleepy eyes and walked downstairs. He still did not understand the situation. He did not know why the adults were suddenly laughing so happily.

Did I miss something?

When Li Yifu’s gaze fell on Tang Haoran, he could not help but shiver. He looked at him deeply and then looked at Xia ruofei. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Senior granduncle ...” Li Yifu asked in shock.

Xia ruofei didn’t wait for Li Yifu to ask his question. He smiled and nodded, confirming Li Yifu’s guess.

Li Yifu’s heart was in turmoil. He was convinced that Tang Haoran had really broken through in one night!

Although he knew that Tang Haoran had reached the peak of Qi disciple Level 1 yesterday, how could it be so easy to break through a bottleneck?

He still remembered that after he was at the peak of Qi disciple Level 1, he had to grind for an entire year before he managed to break through to Qi disciple Level 2. The pain and torture he had to go through was simply indescribable.

The cultivation environment on earth was much worse than it had been decades ago. How could Tang Haoran break through in one night?

Li Yifu would never believe that it was because he had accumulated a lot of experience. It had only been less than a year since Xia ruofei became Tang Haoran’s master.

Li Yifu’s impression of Xia ruofei, the young Grand – Master, had suddenly become much higher and more profound.

“Allen,” Jennifer said with a smile,”go wash your face and eat! You’re turning into a lazy cat ...”

Tang Yitian also felt strange,””This child used to wake up early every day. Why did he sleep in even when master is here?”

What Tang Yitian didn’t know was that Tang Haoran used to wake up on time every day to cultivate, but now that he had spiritual crystals, he didn’t need to cultivate at four hours a day. Moreover, he was also very tired after breaking through to Tang Haoran yesterday, so he overslept without him knowing.

Tang Haoran went to wash up. Xia ruofei then remembered and said,””By the way, big brother Tang, send me your address! I still have to send it to Quto! They said they’ll send a car to pick me up tomorrow. ”

“No problem!” Tang Yitian took out his phone and sent the address to Xia ruofei on WeChat.

Although WeChat was not popular overseas, it was still widely used in the Chinese circle, including Tang Yitian and Jennifer, who were also loyal users of WeChat.

After Xia ruofei copied the address, he was about to send a text message to the female secretary of quodan when he realized that the other party had called a landline.

Just as Xia ruofei was about to call back, he received a new text message on his phone.””Mr. Xia, I’m the staff member from quangé who just called you. My name is Ivy. Please send the address to this phone! This is my private number!”
