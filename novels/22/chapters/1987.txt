1988 I’m going to find her (3)

Xia ruofei placed three 100 – dollar bills under the fruit plate. Tony had been on call 24 hours a day for the past few days. His service was very meticulous, and it was only right for him to tip.

Tony quickly said,”Mr. Xia, why are you suddenly going back?” I think ... I should report to Mr. MA immediately. ”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”don’t tell Mr. MA yet. I will call him when I reach the airport. Don’t worry. I will tell him that I told you not to tell him.”

Xia ruofei did not want MA Xiong’s family to send him off again, so he checked out first without saying goodbye.

“Alright then!” Tony said helplessly,”Mr. Xia, I’ll help you with your luggage!”

He was well aware of the relationship between Xia ruofei and his boss, so he did not dare to disobey Xia ruofei’s orders.

“No need, it’s just a small box. I’ll take it down myself. I’ll have to trouble you to help me check out and arrange a car to send me to the airport. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Oh right, don’t forget. It’s under the fruit platter in the reception room.”

“Thank you for your generosity!” Tony quickly bowed and thanked him.”I’ll arrange for the car immediately!”

Xia ruofei nodded at Tony, then dragged his suitcase to the elevator.

After sitting in the lobby on the first floor for a while, he saw Cheng Xiaoxiao dragging a large suitcase out of the elevator.

Xia ruofei saw Cheng Xiaoxiao looking around and smiled as he stood up and waved at her.

Cheng Xiaoxiao quickly walked over and said, panting,””President Xia, I’m sorry! I’ve made you wait ...”

“I just went downstairs too!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”quickly check out! I’ll be waiting for you here!”

“Alright, alright!” Cheng Xiaoxiao ran to the front desk in a hurry, but stopped after two steps. She turned back and said in embarrassment,”President Xia, please help me look after my luggage!”

“Don’t worry!” Xia ruofei laughed and waved at her.

After Cheng Xiaoxiao checked out, the Rolls – Royce limousine arranged by Tony had already arrived at the hotel entrance. The waiter came over to help the two of them load the luggage into the car.

After Xia ruofei and Cheng Xiaoxiao got into the car, the Rolls – Royce rolled out of the hotel lobby and drove in the direction of Hong Kong’s new airport.

On the way, Xia ruofei took out his phone and gave Ma Zhiming a call.

“RUO Fei!” Ma Zhiming answered the phone immediately.

“Uncle MA, I’m going back to the three mountains. I won’t be going over to say goodbye in person.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”please tell Grandpa MA, aunt Huixin, and little Huanhuan that I’ll come to Hong Kong to visit you guys when I’m free!”

“Why do you suddenly want to go back?” Ma Zhiming was a little surprised and asked.

“It’s not that sudden. I’ve been in Hong Kong for a few days and I’ve finished all my work. I still have a lot of things to do at the company.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Then wait for me at the hotel, I’ll come over to send you off!” Ma Zhiming quickly said.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”I was afraid that you’d be so polite, so I acted first and reported later. I’m almost at the airport now. Don’t come over!”

Upon hearing that, Ma Zhiming was stunned for a moment. Then, he forced a smile and said,”Ruofei, why are you treating us like outsiders?”

“It’s because I don’t treat you as outsiders that I’m not being polite with you! Otherwise, I’d have to pay him a visit to say goodbye!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Alright then!” Ma Zhiming said,”don’t do it again! Also ... If you have time, come to Hong Kong more often. Huanhuan likes to stay with you. ”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said,”tell Huanhuan that I’ll visit her whenever I’m free. Also, she’s welcome to visit my house during her summer break!”

“Okay, okay, okay, I’ll definitely tell her!” Ma Zhiming said with a smile.

Hengfeng Jiahua Hotel wasn’t far from Hong Kong airport. After Xia ruofei finished his call, he chatted with Cheng Xiaoxiao for a while and the car arrived at the airport.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com
