Chapter 969: The farm’s current situation (1)

Translator: 549690339

“Thank you for your reminder, Secretary song, I understand ...” Professor Zhu said.

Even though he said that, he did not really think much of it. ‘Which doctor can ignore an administrative order from his superior?’ Your medical qualification certificate was issued by the Department of Health. Which doctor would dare to disobey the order of the higher authorities?

Even if it was an expert from the central Health Bureau, they would still have to carry out the orders given by the Ministry of Health, let alone a Chinese medicine doctor from the southeast province.

Even though it was hard to get a number one specialist, most doctors could not fight against power.

Song Qiming had been in the government for so many years. How could he not tell that professor Zhu did not mean what he said? However, he only smiled and did not continue to remind her.

After all, only his family, the driver, and the Secretary knew that Xia ruofei had treated Song Wei. He had already told them not to tell anyone. As long as he did not tell anyone, professor Zhu would not be able to find Xia ruofei even if he wanted.

Even if professor Zhu found Xia ruofei through various connections, with elder song’s strong support, as long as Xia ruofei was unwilling, who could force him?

Therefore, song Qiming did not continue the topic. He hung up the phone after saying a few words of thanks to professor Zhu.

Fang Liyun and Song Wei had already heard the results of the test. Fang Liyun had been suppressing her excitement when song Qiming was on the phone with professor Zhu.

After hanging up the phone, Fang Liyun said excitedly,”Old song! That’s great ... That’s great ... Wei Wei’s illness is finally going to be cured ...”

As she spoke, Fang Liyun started to choke up. This poison was too strange. One second she was fine, and the next, she might faint without any warning. Moreover, no one knew which time she would faint and never wake up again. The best Hospitals in the country were helpless. As a mother, Fang Liyun had been suffering during this period.

Fang Liyun did not even feel happy that her husband had taken a huge step forward in his career because Song Wei’s illness was like a huge stone pressing down on her heart. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Now, this huge rock had finally disappeared.

Song Wei’s eyes were red as she held her mother’s hand. She was very grateful to Xia ruofei.

“Yeah!” Song Qiming said with emotion. I’ve been under so much pressure lately ... It’s all thanks to little Xia this time ...”

“Yes, yes, yes, you must thank him properly!” Fang Liyun quickly said,”old song, should we call Dr. Xia to talk about this?” Also, professor Zhu said that Weiwei’s blood indicators are still a little abnormal, but the degree is very mild. Quickly ask doctor Xia when he will start the next treatment!”

Song Qiming did not know whether to laugh or cry.”Can’t you see what time it is now? is this the right time to call?”

Fang Liyun subconsciously looked at the clock on the wall and realized that it was already 12:30 at night. It had been more than five hours since the blood sample was collected at Seveno’ clock and sent to Beijing overnight.

Fang Liyun said in embarrassment,”Then we’ll fight tomorrow!”

“I’ll give Xia a call after work tomorrow. Let’s treat him to a meal tomorrow night!”Song Qiming nodded. Firstly, it’s to express my gratitude, and secondly, to ask about the next stage of the treatment. ”

Song Qiming was only slightly more rational than Fang Liyun. However, when it came to his daughter’s health, he was very concerned and anxious.

Fang Liyun nodded and said,”that’s a good idea!” This is a good idea!”

Song Wei also nodded in agreement.

Song Qiming stood up.”Alright, you can rest now. Weiwei, you should rest early too!”

Song Qiming could not help but yawn. As he grew older, he slept and woke up earlier.

Normally, he would be in bed at about 10 O’ clock.

Of course, it would be a different story if he was busy with work and had to work overtime to review documents.

Song Qiming, his wife, and Song Wei went upstairs to their respective rooms. However, the family of three was very excited. They could not fall asleep for a long time after lying in bed. They could not calm down.

……

The next day, Taoyuan farm.

Xia ruofei woke up at Seveno’ clock sharp to cultivate. He had already washed up and gone downstairs at Seveno’ clock.

Hu Zi’s mother had already prepared breakfast. When she saw Xia ruofei coming downstairs, she immediately greeted him with a smile.

Xia ruofei saw that Lin Qiao was already dressed and sitting at the dining table. She was eating porridge and holding a steamed bun in her hand.

Xia ruofei was surprised.”Qiao’ er, you’re going to report to Egret Island University in a few days. It must be tiring for you. Why don’t you just stop working and rest at home for the next few days?”

Lin Qiao said,”it’s precisely because there’s not much time left that I have to go to work!” There are still many things that I haven’t learned! I’ll take this opportunity to ask my two masters for advice. It won’t be so convenient to go to Heron Island in the future. ”

Seeing that Lin Qiao loved to study so much, Xia ruofei naturally didn’t want to dampen her enthusiasm. He smiled and sat down opposite her. He picked up the porridge that Hu Zi’s mother had already prepared on the table and started to eat it.

After breakfast, Xia ruofei went straight to the general office building. Since she had been away for more than 20 days, she had to listen to the work report from Feng Jing and the others.

Feng Jing had obviously expected Xia ruofei to come to work on time today. Hence, she knocked on the door and walked in with her laptop not long after Xia ruofei arrived at the office.

Xia ruofei greeted Feng Jing with a smile. As they exchanged pleasantries, he personally took out the best Da Hong Pao tea and made a cup for her.

Then, Feng Jing turned on her laptop and reported to Xia ruofei about her recent work.

The production capacity of the vegetable greenhouses had gradually increased. It would not be long before they could reach the highest output and then maintain a dynamic balance.

With the increase in production, paradise vegetables was no longer limited to the previous channels. People could buy paradise vegetables in some big supermarkets.

Of course, the price of the vegetables in paradise was still very high, and it was many times more expensive than similar vegetables.

Even so, the beautiful appearance and excellent taste still made the sales of Taoyuan vegetables very good, and the supply was basically in short supply.

There were many rich people nowadays, and the overall consumption level of the people had also risen.

In the cooperation, Peach Blossom Farm was obviously the party that held the initiative, so the Super – Commercial channel also returned the money very quickly. Now, the capital structure of peach blossom company was very healthy and had a large amount of cash flow.

In addition, due to the hot sales of Drunken Eight Immortals wine, the winery had already begun to receive a monthly dividend. Chi Ming winery did not need much to maintain its operations. On the other hand, Ling Ji F & B had been expanding recently and needed more funds. Therefore, after discussing with Xia ruofei, Ling Xiaotian decided to take out a part of the profits every month to share with both parties.

The winery’s annual profit was about 20 to 25 million Yuan. This way, peach blossom company would have a fixed bonus of about a million Yuan every month.

Although this amount of money was not much to Xia ruofei, from the perspective of the company, he did not need to put in any work at all. He could just split the money without doing anything.

The pomfrets breeding workshop and the orchard were operating normally, especially the pomfrets. At first, everyone was a little worried as the pomfrets were too tender. They did not expect the pomfrets provided by Xia ruofei to have such a high survival rate. There were basically no losses.

The person in charge of pomfrets breeding, Jiang Hua, was in awe of Xia ruofei. He had also looked for Feng Jing many times, hoping that Xia ruofei could provide another batch of pomfrets seedlings as soon as possible so that the products could be more advanced.

However, Xia ruofei was overseas, so Feng Jing could only comfort him and tell him to calm down.

The fastest progress was still in the pharmaceutical factory.

Xue Jinshan and the team that had just started the pharmaceutical factory had been keeping a close eye on the experimental production of the pharmaceutical factory. On the other hand, they had been maintaining close communication with the hospital, so they had a clear idea of the situation of the clinical trials.

The second phase of the clinical trial had been going on for about two months. According to the normal progress, there was still a lot to go.

However, the heart – nourishing soup was something that even the State Drug Administration paid special attention to. It had basically been decided to be listed as a guided drug for autism, so the process of clinical trials had been simplified a lot within the permitted scope.

In fact, the hospitals participating in the second phase of the clinical trial were all looking forward to the official release of this extremely effective drug as soon as possible. This was because the clinical trial process had been too smooth. Many children with autism had improved to varying degrees after taking the drug.

A Doctor’s Heart was like that of a parent ‘s. A real doctor would naturally hope that such a good medicine could benefit a wider range of patients as soon as possible.

Therefore, the second phase of the clinical trials had also come to an end.

Hearing this, Xia ruofei was naturally very happy. He did not expect the pharmaceutical factory to make a lot of profits, but the heart – nourishing soup was indeed a blessing for the majority of people with autism. This was a very meaningful thing, and Xia ruofei was very concerned about it.

“Boss Feng, can the supply of raw materials keep up?” he asked immediately.

Feng Rao took a sip of tea and said,”although the villagers have already started planting herbs, there won’t be any production in the short term. Hence, Xue Jinshan has already contacted some herb merchants in other places and signed an acquisition agreement. There shouldn’t be a problem with the supply of herbs in the short term.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”that’s good. However, I can foresee that the heart – nourishing soup will sell well. In the future, the demand for raw materials will definitely rise. So, we have to stand on our own feet and provide more technical guidance to the villagers. When necessary, we have to give them some financial support.” In addition, I can also solve some of the medicinal materials problem on my side. When the time comes, let Jin Shan directly connect with me!”

“Alright!” Feng Jing nodded.

After they were done discussing work, Xia ruofei opened his desk drawer and took out a small bag. He handed it to Feng Jing with a smile.”This is for you!”

Feng Rao’s heart felt warm. She took the bag and said,””You even brought me a gift when you went abroad!”

“It’s a must!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you’re my company’s right – hand man. I have to win you over!”

Feng Rao chuckled. She opened it and saw that it was sheep oil, a specialty of Australia. It was sheep oil with lavender essence, which was very good for women’s skin care.

Although the value of the gift was not high, Feng Jing was still very touched that Xia ruofei had specially brought it back from Australia.

Her eyes narrowed into slits as she smiled happily.””Chairman, thank you! I really like your gift ...”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”I don’t know anything about this either. Qiao’ er helped me choose this gift. I’m glad you like it!”

Feng Rao laughed and changed the topic.”Chairman, the sheep oil in Australia is good, but ... When can our company start the jaded skin cream project? The effects of the cosmetics and skin care products on the market can’t even compare to the jaded skin cream!”
