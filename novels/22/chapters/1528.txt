Chapter 1529: At all costs (2)

Translator: 549690339

“You really don ‘t?” Xia ruofei squinted his eyes and asked,”upgrading the space will be good for you too! You’ll be able to better comprehend the spatial laws, right?”

“Ji Ji!” The White realm Fox looked as if it was not afraid of death. It firmly expressed that there were no more extra realm stones.

Since the temptation was not effective, Xia ruofei tried to threaten it. He said that if there were really no world stones, he would throw it to the outside world so that it would never be able to come into contact with such profound spatial laws again.

Even Xia Qing couldn’t stand it anymore. Yingluo was facing such a cute exotic beast. Her master was really ruthless!

However, the white fox remained unmoved, and Xia ruofei had no choice.

He couldn’t really throw the white fox out. He wasn’t such a heartless person. Even if he was, he couldn’t bear to abandon such a rare beast that could help him find the world stone!

It seemed like the White realm Fox really did not have any more realm stones, and the space had not been upgraded. Xia ruofei was a little at a loss.

“Master, why don’t you ... Try the spirit nourishment soup again?” Xia Qing asked carefully.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”forget it. The soup is not effective.” I’d better think of another way to upgrade the space!”

Then, Xia ruofei asked,””Xia Qing, you should be able to level up once more, right?”

Xia Qing hesitated for a moment, but she still nodded.

Xia ruofei knew in his heart that if another level up was not enough, then he really had no other way.

Since it wasn’t realistic to find the world stone in a short period of time, he could only use other methods.

Before the appearance of the world stone, the spirit map space had to absorb Jade to level up. Now, Xia ruofei could only use this stupid method.

Although the spirit map space had developed to its current scale, if it were to upgrade using this method, it would require a huge amount of Jade.

However, the most important thing for Xia ruofei was to heal Song Wei’s soul. Nothing else was important. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Xia ruofei didn’t mind even if it would cost him a lot of money.

Furthermore, this space had already absorbed eight world stones. Perhaps it had already reached the critical point of leveling up. Perhaps it wouldn’t need too many jades to level up.

Xia ruofei’s body flashed and he left the spirit map.

Xia Qing sighed and also turned to walk to the medicine garden. Xuxu had a lot of daily maintenance work to do every day.

The White realmfox heaved a sigh of relief. This fierce – looking guy didn’t seem to be too bad. At least he didn’t really drive it away.

The White realmfox quickly flew toward the spatial node in the herb garden and seized the time to comprehend the rules of space.

After Xia ruofei returned to the outside world, she checked on Song Wei’s condition before sending her back into the medium.

He directly placed Song Wei in the stone room of the cave. There was a natural space barrier here, and without his permission, even Xia Qing couldn’t enter. Moreover, the Jade futon in the stone room was more or less helpful in nourishing the soul.

Then, Xia ruofei tidied up his things and threw them into the space. He took his car keys and went downstairs to check out.

It was already midnight. Xia ruofei had checked in in in the afternoon, so the hotel staff was a little surprised to check out at this time.

However, since it was the guest’s request, they had nothing to say. After checking the room and making sure there were no problems, they checked Xia ruofei out.

Xia ruofei left the hotel in the rented SUV and headed straight for the provincial capital of Hunan, Tanzhou.

Although the car rental agency allowed people to return the car from a different place, Xia ruofei still had to go back to Tanzhou first because there was an airport in Tanzhou. No matter where he went, it was the most convenient transit station.

As the car sped along the highway, Xia ruofei took out his phone.

This time, he wanted to buy a large amount of Jade, but he didn’t have any channels himself. The best way was naturally to ask for help from the MA family. After all, they were in the jewelry and jade industry and had a lot of resources in the industry.

Although it was already midnight, Xia ruofei did not bother to disturb his rest. He called Ma Zhiming directly.

Hong Kong.

In fact, Ma Zhiming and Tian Huixin had just fallen asleep not long ago.

After Ma Zhiming’s “unspeakable secret” had been cured by Xia ruofei, he had been abstinent for a period of time. He had just been released not long ago.

Only after losing it would one know how to cherish it.

During this period of time, the frequency of Ma Zhiming and Tian Huixin’s “early bedtime” had increased significantly. They would hand little Huanhuan over to the nanny to coax her to sleep early and then return to their own bedroom.

Today, the two had just finished making love. After taking a shower and lying on the bed, Ma Zhiming’s mobile phone rang not long after he fell asleep.

In fact, Ma Zhiming’s work phone was turned off at night. Only a few relatives, trusted subordinates, and a few important friends had the number of this phone.

Ma Zhiming opened his tired eyes and fumbled to turn on the bedside lamp impatiently. Then, he picked up his phone in a daze.

After seeing the name on the caller ID, the dissatisfaction and sleepiness on Ma Zhiming’s face disappeared without a trace. He glanced at Tian Huixin, who was sleeping soundly, and carefully got out of bed. He took the phone and walked to the study next door, then picked up the call.

“Nice to meet you, Xia Sheng!”

Xia ruofei said apologetically,””Mr. MA, I’m sorry to disturb you so late at night ...”

“No, no, Xia Sheng, you’re too polite.” “Is there anything I can do for you?” Ma Zhiming quickly asked.

Ma Zhiming’s gratitude and respect for Xia ruofei came from the bottom of his heart, because Xia ruofei had done too much for his family.

He had pulled his father back from the brink of death, cured his precious daughter’s autism, and even he himself had to rely on Xia ruofei’s miraculous hands to regain his manliness.

All of these incidents, no matter which one of them was mentioned, were enough to make Ma Zhiming extremely grateful, not to mention that there were so many of them. Furthermore, Xia ruofei’s paradise Corporation was now a relatively important partner of the MA family’s Hengfeng group.

Therefore, Xia ruofei’s matter was definitely Ma Zhiming’s top priority.

“Mr. MA, I’m in urgent need of a batch of Jade.” Xia ruofei said.

“No problem!” Ma Zhiming said without thinking,”I’ll check the company’s inventory right away and transfer it to you from the nearest warehouse ...”

“Mr. MA, I may need a large amount this time, and I need it very urgently.” Xia ruofei said,”so ... I want to ask if you have any reliable channels in the origin of the raw materials. I hope to buy them directly from the origin.”

The MA family’s jewelry and jade industry was huge. Their company’s inventory of raw materials must be a lot, but the demand was also very large. They needed to constantly carve various grades of raw materials into finished products. If they took too much at once, it would inevitably affect their normal business.

“I see ...” Ma Zhiming pondered for a moment and said,”no problem. What Xia Sheng needs is Jade, right?” I’ll contact them first and give you a call later!”

“Then I’ll have to trouble Mr. MA.” Xia ruofei said,”I’m in xiangnan province now. If it’s convenient, I hope that you can book me as soon as possible so that I can buy a plane ticket.”

“No problem!” Ma Zhiming said, then asked,”is Xia Sheng in Tanzhou city in xiangnan?”

“Yes, I am!” Xia ruofei replied,”my phone will be on at all times. Mr. MA, call me if you have any news!”

“Alright!”

After hanging up, Xia ruofei turned the volume of his phone to the maximum and placed it on the dashboard. Then, he split a part of his consciousness to check on Song Wei’s situation in the medium. He then focused on driving the SUV to tan Zhou.

There weren’t many cars on the highway in the second half of the night. Xia ruofei drove at the speed limit.

When the car was about 80 kilometers away from the exit of Tanzhou, the phone on the dashboard rang. It was a call from Ma Zhiming.
