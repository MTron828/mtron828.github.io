Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei gestured for Feng Rao to continue making tea as he laughed and said,””Mr. MA, I’ve brought the truffles. They won’t grow legs and run away, so don’t worry ... Oh, right ...”

Xia ruofei turned around and said,””President Feng, there’s a brown gift box in my bag. Please help me get it!”

“Alright, please wait a moment!” Feng Rao replied.

Soon, Feng Jing found the tea can and gift box in Xia ruofei’s bag. She walked over with the two items and handed the gift box to Xia ruofei. Then, she went to the side to make tea.

Xia ruofei carried Huanhuan with one hand and passed the gift box to MA Xiong with the other. He smiled and said,””Mr. MA, this is just a small gift to show my respect!”

MA Xiong’s eyes lit up as he knew that Xia ruofei’s gift must be something good. He took the gift box and said happily,””Xia Sheng, you’re so polite every time you come. I’m so embarrassed ...”

“Haha, it’s just a little local specialty.” Xia ruofei smiled.”This is a product that our company is currently selling. It’s a gift for you to nourish your body.”

“Oh?” MA Xiong couldn’t help but open the gift box on the spot.

The couple, Ma Zhiming and Tian Huixin, were also very curious about Xia ruofei’s gift and couldn’t help but stick their heads out to take a look.

As soon as the box was opened, MA Xiong couldn’t help but gasp.

Ma Zhiming even directly exclaimed in surprise,”Such a huge aweto! Xia Sheng, your gift is really too rare!”

In the box, more than 500 Cordyceps sinensis were neatly arranged, with their heads facing the same direction. Each one of them was quite plump and presented a beautiful golden color.

The MA family had seen the world, especially the Hong Kong people who paid special attention to food and medicine. They all knew how precious this grade of Cordyceps was.

MA Xiong held the gift box in his arms as if he had found a treasure and said emotionally,”Although I know that Xia Sheng is always generous, I was still shocked by such a large wormgrass.”

“What’s more, these wormgrass are very even!” Tian Huixin also said.

“Yup!” MA Xiong said,”xiasheng, you must have spent a lot of money, right?”

MA Xiong knew that a small box of wormgrass would cost at least a few hundred thousand Yuan. Although this amount of money was nothing to him, there were many good things that could not be bought with money, such as the old wild ginseng, the top – grade truffles and abalone provided by Xia ruofei. The wormgrass obviously belonged to this category.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”This is our company’s product. We didn’t spend much on it. I’m glad you like it!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Of course, I like good things!” MA Xiong laughed and said,”especially since I’m an old man. I need to nourish myself!”

Everyone laughed when they heard that. MA Xiong was still in good health. He was lucky to be alive after suffering from a severe cerebral hemorrhage. There would definitely be some side effects. However, Xia ruofei’s miraculous treatment did not cause any side effects. In fact, his body was in good condition. He was even better than before he fell sick. Therefore, the MA family was very grateful to Xia ruofei.

“Xiasheng, does this mean that ... Your company still has a lot of such wormgrass?” Ma Zhiming asked.

Xia ruofei knew what Ma Zhiming meant. He smiled and said,””We do have some, but we’ve already reached an agreement with Tongren Hall, so we’re basically not selling them to the public.”

“That’s a pity. I wanted to have a chance to work together!” Ma Zhiming said with regret.

MA Xiong laughed and said,”Zhiming, you can’t earn all the money! Xia Sheng had many good things! I have my own business partners!”

MA Xiong knew that Tongren Hall had a unique advantage in the sales of expensive Chinese medicine like Cordyceps. Although Hengfeng group was involved in many fields, Tongren Hall was still better than them in the Chinese medicine industry.

Now that the channels were King, it was reasonable and irreproachable for Xia ruofei to choose Tongren Hall as his business partner.

Feng Rao served the tea and Xia ruofei invited everyone to enjoy the tea. They sat down and chatted for a while. Xia ruofei noticed that MA Xiong was a little absent – minded and knew that he was still thinking about the truffles. He could not help but laugh to himself.

Xia ruofei stood up and put little Huanhuan down. Then, he said,”Mr. MA, I’ll take out the truffle first! Otherwise, you won’t even be in the mood to drink tea ...”

MA Xiong’s face turned red as he laughed awkwardly,”Hehe, I’ve been looking forward to this batch of truffles ever since I saw the data you sent me ...” He said.

Xia ruofei walked over and opened the refrigerator. He took out all three plastic boxes.

Ma Zhiming also came over to help. The two of them carried the three boxes to the living room and placed them on the coffee table.

Xia ruofei opened all three plastic boxes in one breath.

The truffles were all buried in the rice, so one couldn’t tell from the outside.

However, Xia ruofei had personally put them in, so he was naturally very familiar with them. He reached into one of the boxes without thinking and took out a huge piece of white truffle from the rice.

The truffle was as big as a basketball and it was heavy in his hand. It looked like a large piece of ginger or a sweet potato.

However, it was this unremarkable looking large piece of “sweet potato” that seemed to have endless magic, and immediately caught the MA family’s eyes.

“This ... This ... This is too big ...” MA Xiong was shocked as he mumbled to himself,”this is the finale item for tomorrow’s auction?”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Yes, 2.73 kg!”

The living room quieted down. MA Xiong, Ma Zhiming, and the others were breathing heavily.

After a long while, MA Xiong said with a bitter smile,”I shouldn’t have come ... I saw such a good piece of white truffle, but I had to put it up for auction. Xia Sheng, do you know how cruel it is for an experienced truffle glutton?”

Tian Huixin and Feng Rao couldn’t help but cover their mouths and laugh.

Old kids, old kids ... People would slowly return to their true selves as they grew older. MA Xiong’s expression at that moment was like a child who had just seen his favorite toy.

Tian Huixin knew how much her father – in – Law loved truffles, so she couldn’t help but say,””Why don’t we ... Discuss this with RUO Fei ...”

“No!” MA Xiong said firmly,”the auction is more important. Besides, the promotional video was released a few days ago. How could the finale item be missing?”

MA Xiong was still rational. He knew what was more important.

He knew that not only could he not buy this giant white truffle from Xia ruofei in private, he could not even bid for it at the auction.

There were no impenetrable walls in the world.

This was an auction hosted by Hengfeng group. If he were to bid or entrust someone else to bid, it would eventually be exposed by the media in Hong Kong. He would definitely be accused of deliberately hyping up the price.

At that time, good things would turn bad.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”Old Mr. MA, don’t worry! I’ve long known that you love truffles, so how could I not have made preparations?”

“Oh?” MA Xiong’s eyes lit up. He looked at Xia ruofei expectantly and asked,”Xia Sheng, you mean ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and did not say anything. He took out a piece of white truffle from the plastic container on the far right that was not full.

This piece of white truffle was about the same size as the one he had just taken out. It also had a strong and unique smell. To MA Xiong, this smell was the symbol of extreme deliciousness.

The visual impact of the two truffles placed together was even stronger.

Xia ruofei pointed at the piece of white truffle and smiled.””Mr. MA, I prepared this for you. Are you satisfied?”
