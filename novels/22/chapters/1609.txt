Chapter 1610: “Careful” consideration (2)

Xia ruofei quickly explained,””Of course, this is just a one – sided invitation from the company. The specific decision is still up to you. I also hope that no matter what decision you make, you will follow your heart. In short, this is a simple job invitation, so don’t confuse it with other things ...”

Although Xia ruofei had tactfully expressed that he wasn’t forcing her to do anything, he still couldn’t help but feel embarrassed after he finished speaking. When Dong Yun had offered to join paradise Corporation last year, he had rejected her with a straight face. He didn’t want Dong Yun to mix this matter with the element of repaying her kindness. Now, it had only been less than a month, and he came to invite Dong Yun to join again. He was more or less suspected of going back on his word.

Xia ruofei also thought that Feng Jing had given him a big problem!

Seeing that Xia ruofei, a Big Boss, was acting like a child who had done something wrong, Dong Yun could not help but laugh.

She held back her laughter and said,”thank you for your appreciation, President Xia. This is not a small matter. I can’t give you an answer right away, but I will seriously consider it!”

Xia ruofei felt relieved and quickly said,””Alright! Miss Dong, then I won’t hold you up from your work...I’ll be going to Beijing for a business trip for a few days in the afternoon. If you’ve made a decision, you can communicate it to CEO Feng immediately. Whether you choose our paradise Corporation or not, I’m very grateful for your work for our company during this period of time!”

“You’re too kind, President Xia!” Dong Yun said with a smile.

She walked Xia ruofei to the office door and turned back to continue her work.

As Xia ruofei was leaving, he was trying to figure out Dong Yun’s feelings. Even though he did not reject her immediately, Dong Yun did not sound like she had a strong desire to stay. Could Feng Jing have made a mistake?

“Chairman! Chairman!”

When Xia ruofei returned to her senses, she realized that she had unknowingly walked to the door of Feng Jing’s office. Feng Jing was waving her hand in front of her.

Feng Rao asked with a smile,”what are you thinking about?” I’ve called you several times!”

Xia ruofei smiled awkwardly and said,””It’s nothing ...”

“How is it?” Feng Jing pouted at Dong Yun’s office and asked.

Xia ruofei was a little confused.”I did tell her,” he said.”But she didn’t say anything. She said she would consider it ...”

“I see ...” Feng Jing asked,”then ... What do you think of her attitude?” Is there any chance of her staying?”

Xia ruofei said,”I can’t say for sure ... I don’t feel like I’m that determined to stay ... Anyway, I’ve done what I can. Dong Yun is a very opinionated person. Let her decide for herself!”

“Alright ...” Feng Jing was a little disappointed. She did have high hopes for Dong Yun and felt that she was the most suitable candidate for the Executive Director position.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sister ran, I’ve completed my mission!” No matter if it’s successful or not, you can’t blame me anymore!”

“I can’t be bothered to blame you! The company is yours anyway!” Feng Jing pouted and glanced at Xia ruofei.”If you really can’t do it, you can continue to look for a headhunting company!”

“Mm! Let’s see what Dong Yun’s decision is!” Xia ruofei said,”sister che, I’ll leave the company to you. I have to go back and pack my luggage!”

“Go on, go on!”

......

At twoo’ clock in the afternoon, ye Lingyun drove the company’s Mercedes – Benz to Xia ruofei’s small villa. He quickly took Xia ruofei’s small suitcase and put it in the trunk, then quickly went over to open the door for Xia ruofei.

Although Xia ruofei had told ye Lingyun several times that such a small matter could be handled by a veteran, ye Lingyun did not listen. Every time Xia ruofei was sent to the airport, he would personally drive.

The Mercedes – Benz drove smoothly on the airport Highway. Xia ruofei sat with his eyes closed to rest.

Just then, his phone vibrated. Xia ruofei opened his eyes and took a look at his phone. It was Feng Jing.

He thought to himself,”could there be something wrong again ...”

“Hello, Sister Che!” Xia ruofei answered the call.

“You liar!” Feng Rao laughed and scolded him.

Xia ruofei was stunned and asked,”what’s going on?” When have I ever lied to you?”

“Didn’t you say this morning that Dong Yun’s intention to stay wasn’t very strong?” Feng Jing said unhappily,”when I arrived at the office just now, she came to look for me and said that she’s willing to stay in our company as the Executive Director! I’ve already arranged for someone to handle the formal employment procedures for her!”

Xia ruofei was pleasantly surprised, but at the same time, he asked in confusion,””No way? When I looked for her this morning, she said it herself! She said that this is not a small matter and that we have to consider it carefully before making a decision ...”

“I asked her the same question!” Feng Jing giggled and said,”she said that she’s been thinking about it for more than an hour and finally decided to accept your invitation to join our paradise Corporation!”

Xia ruofei was speechless. After a while, he said,””Alright! He was indeed being ‘cautious’! No matter what, this was a good thing! Sister ran, please ask the canteen to prepare a few more dishes tonight. Please invite Dong Yun to a banquet on my behalf and welcome her to our company!”

“Don’t worry! I’ve already made the arrangements!” Feng Jing said,”you can go to Beijing with peace of mind!”

“Haha, now there’s another female general who’s not inferior to men under my command. This is like adding wings to a Tiger!” Xia ruofei replied happily,”of course I’m more at ease ...”

Feng Rao was also in a good mood. She joked,”Remember to bring us gifts when you come back! Otherwise, be careful that we don’t collectively quit next time!”

“Yes, sir!” Xia ruofei laughed and hung up the phone.

He looked up and saw that the car had already driven out of the airport Expressway. He could already see the terminal in the distance.

Ye Lingyun stopped the car in front of the departure hall. Xia ruofei said,””Alright, you don’t have to get out of the car! This is a temporary parking area, just open the trunk! My luggage isn’t heavy, I can carry it in myself!”

Soon, Xia ruofei moved the small suitcase out of the car, waved at ye Lingyun through the window, and dragged the suitcase into the hall.

It was exactly 2:30 am.

“RUO Fei, this way!” As soon as Xia ruofei entered the main hall, he saw Song Wei waving at him happily.

At the same time, Xia ruofei’s expression froze. He saw song Qiming standing beside Song Wei and smiling at him.

Xia ruofei hastened his steps and came in front of the two of them.””Hello, uncle song!”

Song Qiming smiled at Xia ruofei gently and said,””Xiao Xia, I’m going to visit an Industrial Park in Changping County this afternoon, so I came to the airport to send Wei Wei off. I heard that you’re also going to the capital for business and that you’re on the same flight as Weiwei, so I’m much more at ease. You have to help me take care of my girl on the way!”

“Don’t worry, uncle song!”Xia ruofei quickly said.

Song Wei pouted and said,”dad!” I’m not a child anymore, I don’t need anyone to take care of me!”

Song Wei glanced at Xia ruofei and blushed.

Song Qiming laughed and said,”no matter what, the two of us can look out for each other!” It’s almost time, you guys can go through the security check directly!”

Song Qiming’s Secretary, Guangzhi Cao, walked over with two boarding passes. He nodded at Xia ruofei and said respectfully,””Secretary, I’ve changed my boarding pass!” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Xia ruofei and Guangzhi were old acquaintances. They had interacted a lot. Back then, song Qiming had just taken office and Guangzhi Cao was a new Secretary. It was like walking on thin ice. Now, it seemed that Guangzhi Cao was much more experienced and more confident.

“Give it to them!” Song Qiming nodded slightly.

“Thank you for your hard work, brother Cao!” Xia ruofei smiled as he took his boarding pass.

“I should!” Guangzhi Cao said with a smile. Then, he took over Xia ruofei and Song Wei’s luggage.

Song Wei only had a small bag with her. She was back at school, so she probably had a lot of stuff. Guangzhi Cao must have checked it in for her.

The two of them passed the security check smoothly. They waved at song Qiming, who was outside the prohibited line, and turned around to walk toward the VIP lounge.
