Chapter 3425: Another battle with the star beasts (1)

Translator: 549690339

Ling Qingxuc had also passed the trial Pagoda’s second level test, but her cultivation was only at the Qi refining stage, so her mission was to kill 100 primary star beasts. In the trial Pagoda she was in, there were very few intermediate star beasts, let alone high level star beasts.

When Ling Qingxuc was doing the mission on the second level of the Tower of Trials, she had once encountered an intermediate Star Beast. Fortunately, she had discovered it from a distance and the terrain was good for hiding, so she had managed to avoid it. Otherwise, her life would have been in danger on the second level.

As such, when these mid – tier astral beasts appeared, Ling Qingxue’s expression changed slightly. There was a huge difference between the size of mid – tier astral beasts and beginner – tier astral beasts. She had even seen one from afar, so she recognized it with a single glance.

Xia ruofei said decisively,”Qingxue, you hide first!” I’ll deal with them!”

Ling Qingxue naturally understood what Xia ruofei meant. Although she did not know about the existence of the spirit map space, Xia ruofei had already used it to protect her once on the sixth floor of the Tower of Trials. She knew that Xia ruofei had a “protective magical equipment”. Besides, she was also very clear that in this situation, it was best for her to hide or she would easily drag Xia ruofei down.

Ling Qingxue was well aware of the Star Beast’s speed, so she nodded without hesitation.”Alright! Ruofei, you have to be careful too!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Don’t worry!” Xia ruofei said calmly.

Then, with a thought, a suction force came from the spirit map space. Ling Qingxue didn’t resist and was sucked into the space in an instant.

Of course, Xia ruofei did not want to expose the existence of the spirit map space. Thus, Ling Qingxue was still kept in a small space that he had set up in the mountain and sea realm. The area was not large, and there was white fog everywhere. Ling Qingxue could not see the situation around her.

After putting Ling Qingxue into the spirit map space, Xia ruofei had nothing to worry about and was immediately relieved.

A glint of light appeared in his eyes. The tips of the two flying swords trembled slightly, and he aimed them at the twenty – plus star beasts that were rushing over at high speed.

Xia ruofei didn’t use the trap and kill array immediately. He wanted to fight the Star Beast with his own strength.

Xia ruofei had never encountered those giant ants before, so he had not experienced them directly. He had fought with an intermediate Star Beast before. Now that he had encountered one again, he would naturally have a chance to compare himself with it.

These star beasts were as fast as ever and in the blink of an eye, they had already reached Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei didn’t hesitate. He used the floating steps and two flying swords shot out like lightning, aiming at the Star Beast in the front.

The Star Beast was obviously a little afraid of the flying sword and quickly changed direction to avoid it.

The astral beast was indeed very agile. It changed direction while running at high speed without any delay.

However, the greatest characteristic of the noble Sword technique was that it was treacherous, and the attack route was hard to grasp. It was difficult to distinguish between real and fake.

As a result, the Star Beast dodged to its right, but what awaited it was the blade of the flying sword.

In fact, the sharp attack of the flying sword of qushuang was just a feint. It drew an arc and directly arrived at the right front of the starbeast. At the same time, the starbeast had already turned to the right in its high – speed movement, as if it had delivered itself to the sword.

Xia ruofei knew that star beasts also had thick skin and flesh, so he didn’t hold back at all. He had used all his strength in this strike.

The flying sword cut open the hard scales and the tight muscles on the Star Beast’s chest, leaving a huge wound. Blood immediately gushed out.

The Star Beast let out a miserable howl and fell to the ground. This sword attack had actually made it lose its fighting strength.

Xia ruofei’s eyes flashed with a smile. He could clearly feel that his attack was much more powerful than when he was on the second level of the Tower of Trials.

Of course, the fact that this attack could have such an effect was also the result of a combination of many factors.

After Xia ruofei’s cultivation had increased, the main factor was naturally the increase in his attack power. In addition, the Star Beast was running forward at high speed, which was equivalent to colliding with the sword’s edge at high speed. The damage caused was naturally much greater than when it was still.

But no matter what, this sword had greatly boosted Xia ruofei’s confidence.

Of course, he didn’t dare to relax for even a moment, because he had only injured one star Beast. The rest of the star beasts didn’t stop because of their companion’s injury. On the contrary, under the stimulation of their companion’s blood, their ferocity was stimulated, and their speed suddenly increased by a large margin.

Xia ruofei was soon surrounded.

However, Xia ruofei did not panic. At this time, the advantage of his greatly improved spiritual power was obvious. Although the star beasts were extremely fast and they were attacking Xia ruofei, he could always rely on his sharp perception and super fast reaction speed to Dodge in the narrow space. The star beasts did not even touch the corner of his clothes.

Not only that, the qushuang flying sword and the blue immortal sword were even more elusive, always able to seize the fleeting opportunity to give the Star Beast a hard blow.

When Xia ruofei first encountered an intermediate Star Beast on the second level of the Tower of Trials, he almost could not break through its defense. But now, it was completely different. Basically, every sword strike could leave a wound of different depths on the Star Beast’s body..
