Fang Hongli said,”let’s talk about it when we get back!” President Xu is also in a fit of anger right now, so we have to wait for him to calm down before we can find him!”

In fact, Fang Hongli knew very well that Mr. Xia’s power was beyond their imagination to complete such a complete ban in such a short period of time. Perhaps even their company’s President Xu could not compete with him.

Furthermore, even if he had the ability, why would President Xu help Dong Xinyu?

She was just a small – time celebrity. It would not be a big loss for him to ban her. Why would he risk offending a Big Shot to help Dong Xinyu?

Therefore, Fang Hongli knew that Dong Xinyu was finished. There was no way for her to make a comeback.

Ever since Dong Xinyu had become famous, her personality had become more and more unreasonable. She had brought all of this upon herself.

......

In the RV, Xia ruofei and the rest did not take the little episode at the entrance of the Western restaurant to heart. In their eyes, a small star like Dong Xinyu was not important. If she had not made such a big fuss, Xia ruofei would not have been so heavy – handed. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

However, so what if he was banned? he was just a small figure.

There must be something hateful about the pitiful. Xia ruofei had not reached the point where he was overflowing with sympathy.

Tang Yitian’s family first sent Xia ruofei and Feng Jing back to the hotel.

Jennifer asked with a smile,”Xia, is your company looking for a spokesperson for that product?” What do you think about me being the spokesperson? It just so happens that ‘the angel of doom’ is preparing to start filming in China during this period of time, so I’ll probably be working in China all the time. There won’t be a problem for me to cooperate with your publicity!”

After Feng Rao heard Jennifer’s words, she suddenly showed a look of surprise and joy.

However, she was disappointed.

Because Xia ruofei quickly replied,””Sis – in – Law, you’ve retired from the entertainment industry a long time ago, and you’re now the CEO of an entertainment company. How could I trouble you to be the spokesperson? It’s not suitable for you to show your face in public now ...”

Tang Yitian laughed and said,”ruofei, if your sister – in – Law is willing, I don’t have any problems with it!” I’ve always been very supportive of Jennifer’s career ...”

“I know, big brother Tang even opened an entertainment company for sister – in – Law!” Xia ruofei said with a smile, then said seriously,”but there’s really no need! I don’t want sister – in – Law to make an exception because of me!”

Xia ruofei knew that since Jennifer retired from the entertainment industry, she had completely stopped taking on endorsements, advertising and other jobs. Now that she had successfully transformed, Xia ruofei felt bad to let her return under such circumstances.

Even if Jennifer had suggested it, Xia ruofei could not get over it.

Tang Yitian and Jennifer looked at each other. They could tell that Xia ruofei was not being polite. His attitude was very firm.

So after Jennifer pondered for a moment, she said with a smile,””Alright, then forget it ...”

Then Jennifer asked with a smile,””But ... I’d like to take a look at the information about your new product. That should be fine, right?”

“Of course!” Xia ruofei said, then gestured to Feng Rao.

Feng Rao immediately took out the introduction information about the jaded skin cream from her bag and handed it to Jennifer.

Xia ruofei smiled and took out a small porcelain bottle from his bag.””Sister – in – Law, this is our company’s new product that is about to be launched. It was also personally designed and developed by me. Today, I specially brought it over for you to try it out. However, I was interrupted by that Dong Xinyu just now, so I did not have the time to bring it out!”

Jennifer looked surprised and took the jaded skin ointment from Xia ruofei’s hand.””Thank you, Xia!”

“You’re welcome!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I hope you can give us more valuable advice!”

“Definitely, definitely!” Jennifer carefully put away the small bottle.

She knew that Xia ruofei was a very capable person and his medical skills were superb. She was also looking forward to the product that Xia ruofei had personally developed.
