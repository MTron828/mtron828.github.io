Chapter 1938 Hanging you out without discussion (1)

“Ah?” Zhou Yu was stunned.

Zhu zhihang was the second – in – command of Changping. Although he did not make an appointment to visit directly, Zhou Yu felt that Xia ruofei would still receive him out of courtesy. She did not expect him to refuse so firmly.

Feng Rao looked at Xia ruofei and said after a moment of silence,””Zhou Yu, stop daydreaming! Reply according to the Chairman’s instructions!”

Zhou Yu came back to her senses and quickly nodded.”Alright!”

After Zhou Yu left the office, Feng Jing asked with a slight frown,””RUO Fei, isn’t this a little inappropriate? After all, County Head Zhu ...”

Feng Jing didn’t support Xia ruofei’s decision, but she still had to protect Xia ruofei’s authority as the chairman in front of Zhou Yu. Now that there were no outsiders, Feng Jing finally voiced her opinion.

Xia ruofei pouted and said indifferently,””There’s nothing inappropriate about it! I don’t have a good impression of the leaders of Changping County! So what if he was left hanging? We’re not begging him!”

Feng Jing couldn’t help but smile bitterly. After working together for so long, she knew Xia ruofei better than anyone else. Xia ruofei usually looked very kind and didn’t put on airs, but when he was serious, he wouldn’t listen to anyone’s advice.

She looked at Xia ruofei and said,”I’ve been meaning to ask you!” What did the leaders of Changping County do to you? Didn’t we have high hopes of expanding our farms and building pharmaceutical factories in Changping? From the moment you asked factory manager Xue to inspect the other places, I felt that something was wrong ...”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”these people don’t follow the rules!”

Then, Xia ruofei told Feng Jing about the negotiation with Wu Liqian, but the Changping County had a change of personnel at the last minute. They had openly stolen Wu Liqian’s political achievements. Then, he said,”Sister ran, tell me, what kind of good feelings can I have for these bureaucrats?”

Of course, Xia ruofei didn’t mention that Liu haojun kept pestering Wu Liqian and even used some underhanded means to push Wu Liqian aside at work. On the one hand, it involved Wu Liqian’s privacy. On the other hand, he didn’t want Feng Jing to link it to Liu haojun’s scandal and “resignation.”

So it’s all for a female confidante ... Feng Jing thought to herself.

She knew about the relationship between Wu Liqian and Xia ruofei. She also knew that Xia ruofei had looked for Wu Liqian immediately after the incident at Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory. Now that she thought about it, Xia ruofei had also wanted to give this heavy political achievement to Wu Liqian. In the end, there was a problem in Changping County. Someone came out of nowhere. No wonder Xia ruofei was so angry.

Thinking about this, Feng Jing couldn’t help but feel a little sour. She said to herself,”If I’m treated unfairly like this, will he also be angry?

“Sister Che! Sister Che!” Xia ruofei’s voice brought Feng Rao back to her senses.

“Ah?” Feng Rao said subconsciously.

Xia ruofei laughed and asked,”what’s the situation?” Why did she get distracted while talking? Did you not sleep well last night?”

“No, I didn ‘t! I don’t have any!” Feng Jing quickly said,”now that you’ve said that, I also think that the leaders of Changping County have gone too far!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“So, you agree with what I’m doing?” Xia ruofei asked happily.

“I think ... We can just give them some time to think about it. There’s no need to push things too far ...” Feng Jing said.”Firstly, we don’t know the inside story. Maybe County Head Zhu and the others have their own reasons. Also, our farm is still in Changping, and from a strategic point of view, Changping is the most suitable location for the manufacturing factory. The terrain there is flat, the transportation is developed, and the preferential conditions given by the county are very sincere. The most important thing is that it’s very close to the airport. In the future, when the production capacity is increased, it will be very convenient to ship goods to the country ... Even if we don’t do business in Changping, there’s no need to make our relationship with the local government so stiff. Peace is the most important thing in business, we seek wealth, not Qi!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but look at Feng Rao with a smile and said,””Sister ran, I find that you have the potential to be a political commissar. It’s a pity that our company is not the Army and we don’t have such a position ...”

Feng Rao glared at Xia ruofei and said,””I’m talking about serious business with you! You’re starting to be naughty again ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Alright, alright!” I’ve heard everything you said ... How should I put this? I agree to part of it! To forge iron, one needs to be strong. The reason why we are so apprehensive is because we are not strong enough! Think about it, if it was tycoon Wang or father MA, would they care if they offended a County – Level administrative organization?”

“You’ll have to wait until you’re the richest man in the country!”Feng Rao laughed. At least, we don’t have the confidence to do so now. This is also a result of our national conditions. If we want to have as few constraints as possible, we have to compromise!”

“Understood!” Xia ruofei said lazily,”sister che, let’s see if they’re sincere enough this time. If they can’t even take this little bit of anger and just leave, then don’t blame me ...”

“You! “Don’t overdo it ...” Feng Jing said.”Alright, I won’t try to persuade you anymore. You can do it yourself!” I’m going back to my office first. I’ll be going to Hong Kong in a few days, so I have to arrange some work in advance ...”
