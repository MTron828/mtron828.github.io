Xia ruofei finally reacted and couldn’t help but laugh.””Qingxue, you’re just showing off your storage ring! Hahaha ...”

Ling Qingxue did have some thoughts in this regard. Besides, after she got the storage ring, she was really full of novelty. Her storage space was filled to the brim. No matter what, girls always had more personal items than boys, and female cultivators were no exception.

However, the two fruit baskets and two bottles of wine were indeed specially prepared by her.

Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”don’t make fun of me!” Who doesn’t know that your storage treasure is better! I’m Doing This for Your Sake, okay? I don’t want you to be rude in front of your future in – laws!”

Speaking of her future in – laws, Ling Qingxue still felt a little awkward. However, that slight sour feeling disappeared in a flash. She seemed to have gotten used to her current situation.

“Alright! Alright!” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”our Qingxue is so thoughtful!”

After he finished speaking, he brought Ling Qingxue to the front of the courtyard and rang the doorbell.

Song Wei’s cheerful voice could be heard from the courtyard,””They’re coming!”

Soon, the door to the courtyard opened and Song Wei stuck her head out to take a look. She immediately revealed a happy smile.”RUO Fei! Qingxue! As expected, you guys are here! Please come in!”

Xia ruofei was carrying a fruit basket in each hand, while Ling Qingxue was carrying two bottles of wine. The three of them walked into the courtyard together.

“Why Did You Come to My House to take something? My dad doesn’t like this kind of thing!” Song Wei said with a smile.

“Qingxue prepared this, it’s just a small token of our appreciation!” Xia ruofei said,”uncle song doesn’t accept gifts from others, but he will definitely accept our gifts!”

“You’re quite confident!” Song Wei chuckled.”But you’re right. You’re his Savior! Besides, you’ve never asked him for anything. He’ll be overjoyed if you bring him a gift! How could I not accept it?”

“Right, is uncle song at home?” Xia ruofei asked.

“You’re still working! But it should be soon. ” Song Wei said,”he had a meeting tonight, but when he heard that you were coming, he immediately changed his schedule and postponed it to tomorrow morning.”

“Yo! That’s not good!” Xia ruofei said with a sneer.

“It’s not a meeting in the province. It’s not a big deal for him to adjust the schedule of the city meeting.” Song Wei said with a smile.

As they spoke, the three of them had already passed through the small courtyard and entered the small Western – style house.

Song Wei’s mother, Fang Liyun, had also walked out of the kitchen. She was wearing an apron and sleeves. It was obvious that she was cooking.

Seeing Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue, Fang Liyun smiled warmly and said,””RUO Fei, Qingxue, we welcome you! Please come in!”

Song Wei took out two pairs of slippers from the shoe cabinet and placed them on the floor. She smiled and said,”New slippers, change into them quickly!”

“Thank you!” Xia ruofei said. Then, he turned to Fang Liyun and said,”aunt Fang, sorry for the sudden visit!”

“What are you saying?!” Fang Liyun rebuked. Old song and I are so happy that you came to our house as guests! How could it be a disturbance? However, when Weiwei is not at home, you young people won’t be willing to listen to our nagging. This time, when Weiwei comes back, you will also come. The house will be lively!”

After that, Fang Liyun turned to Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue, who had already changed into their slippers, and said,””RUO Fei, Qingxue, go sit in the living room! The soup was still boiling in the kitchen! I have to go and watch the fire! Let Wei Wei chat with you guys! Old song will be home soon!”

“Alright! Aunt Fang, you’ve worked hard!” Xia ruofei said.

Ling Qingxue smiled sweetly and said,””Auntie Fang, I’ll go help out in the kitchen!”

“No need, no need!” Fang Liyun quickly retorted,”how can you let a guest help in the kitchen! You guys can drink tea and chat in the living room. I’ll be in the kitchen by myself! Dinner is almost ready, I don’t need any help!”

“Qingxue, even though you’ve learned a lot from my family, my kitchen is my mother’s exclusive property. Don’t even think about occupying it!” Song Wei chuckled.

Song Wei then led Ling Qingxue and Xia ruofei to the living room.

“Ruofei, bring out your good tea!” Song Wei said,”although the tea at my house is not bad, it’s nothing compared to your tea!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”no problem!” I’ll make the tea, you guys just drink it!”

With that, Xia ruofei took out a small bag of tea leaves from the spirit map space and fiddled with the purple sand tea set on the coffee table in the living room.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue saw Xia ruofei open the bag and pour the tea leaves into the teapot.

Even though hot water had not been poured in, the fragrance of the tea leaves alone was enough to make the two of them slightly stunned.

“Ruofei, is this ... Wild tea?” Song Wei asked.

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”of course!” Of course, the best tea leaves must be used for the two wives!”

Xia ruofei’s voice was not loud, but Song Wei and Ling Qingxue were still shocked. They subconsciously looked towards the kitchen and glared at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”don’t worry!” If I don’t want aunt Fang to hear me, she won’t hear me even if I shout. “
