Chapter 395: Jaded skin ointment is on fire (3)

Now that a week had passed, Xia ruofei could take the soup again.

The body tempering soup was to be taken every five days. Two days ago, Xia ruofei had made a new bowl of body tempering soup and drank it. After the pain, his strength had improved again. He could only hold on for three to four minutes for the second set of movements. Now, he could hold on for about ten minutes. He had improved by a lot.

Now that Xia ruofei had kept the wine jar, he could not wait to return to the farm.

This was because he wanted to brew the pregnancy soup again.

Compared to his physical fitness, he was more interested in the training of his spiritual power.

This was because he realized that his control of the spirit map space was closely related to his spiritual power.

In addition, there were more contents in the booklet in the stone room of the cave in the new space waiting for him to explore.

On top of that, there were a few other items on the stone platform. Whether it was the Jade token or the jade box, Xia ruofei was extremely envious. He had to use his mental energy to decipher them one by one.

He took a look at the warehouse, which was empty except for the forklift, and walked over to open the door and leave the warehouse.

Xia ruofei locked the door and was about to get into the car when his phone rang.

He took a look at the caller ID and revealed a surprised expression.

Xia ruofei pressed the answer button and said,””Hello, sis Wu!”

“Xiao Xia, didn’t you invite me to visit your farm last time?” Wu Liqian said,”I’m free these two days ...”

Xia ruofei said happily,”welcome!” Sis Wu, when are you going over? I need to make some preparations. ”

“What’s there to prepare? I’m just here to take a look ...” Wu Liqian said.

“Of course, of course. It’s not easy for a busy man like you to come here. As the host, I should at least treat you to a taste of my Taoyuan series of agricultural products!” Xia ruofei said.

“Then ... I’ll go over in the afternoon!” Wu Liqian said.

“Alright! I’m still in the city, but I’ll be back at the farm in a while. ” Xia ruofei said.

“Okay, okay.” Wu Liqian said.

Xia ruofei could tell that Wu Liqian was not paying attention. He couldn’t help but ask,”Sis Wu, is there anything else you need?”

“Ah?” Wu Liqian said,”it’s nothing ...”

In fact, she wanted to ask about the facial mask when she called, but she was a little embarrassed and didn’t know how to say it.

“Sis Wu, you’re not treating me as a friend!” Xia ruofei sighed and said,”since you’re looking for me, don’t hide it from me. We don’t have to be so formal, right?”

“Xia, actually ... I want to ask about the facial mask, the one you gave to Secretary Tian ...” Wu Liqian said quickly.

Xia ruofei smiled when he heard that. In fact, he had already guessed it, so he immediately said,””Sis Wu, that mask is called jaded skin cream, and I made it by hand. I’ve already prepared one for you, and I was just about to send it to you! I didn’t expect you to call me ...”

The jaded skin ointment that Xia ruofei had brewed was originally prepared to be given to others. He would definitely not leave out his female friends and elders like Tian Huilan and Wu Liqian, who were close to him.

Wu Liqian said happily,””Really? Little Xia, you’re really interesting!”

Xia ruofei laughed.”Sis Wu, I won’t be sending it over then. I’ll give it to you when you come to the farm in the afternoon.”

“Alright, alright, alright. I’ll come over after lunch!” Wu Liqian said quickly.

In fact, Wu Liqian would have gone to the farm immediately if she hadn’t said that she would be there in the afternoon.

This kind of cosmetics with unbelievable effects was absolutely fatal to women. Even as a Deputy Director, Wu Liqian couldn’t resist it.

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei smiled and shook his head. He opened the door of Knight XV and sat in the driver’s seat.

He didn’t deliberately promote the jaded skin cream, but such a good thing didn’t need to be promoted at all. It was passed on by word of mouth between friends, and soon, many people would know about it.

However, Xia ruofei did not expect the process to be so fast.

After he got into the car, his phone rang again before he could start it.

Xia ruofei was fastening his seat belt. After he fastened his seat belt, he took out his phone from the storage compartment and glanced at it. It was a call from Tian Huilan. Xia ruofei quickly pressed the answer button.

“Hello, Secretary Tian!” Xia ruofei said politely.

“RUO Fei! Thank you for the mask! “It’s very effective ...”Tian Huilan said affectionately.

“Secretary Tian, you’re too polite. This is just a small token of my appreciation. It’s not worth mentioning,” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Ruofei, do you have any more of that Facial Mask?” Tian Huilan was a little embarrassed as she said,”it’s like this. I had a video call with my sister Huixin today. She saw that I changed a lot after using a Facial Mask. She heard that I used a Facial Mask, so she insisted that I get her one too ...”

“I see! No problem, I still have some on hand, I’ll send them to you later. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”however, this mask has to be kept fresh. If you want to send it to Hong Kong, it’s best to use the cold chain transportation.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“I’m really grateful!” Tian Huilan said happily,”Xiao Xia, you don’t have to trouble yourself with this. I’ll get Youyou to get it from your farm!”

“That’s fine too,” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Secretary Tian, the effect of this mask will be better if you use it a few more times. I’ll get you a few more!” You can keep it for yourself or give it to someone else. This Facial Mask is made of pure Chinese medicine ingredients and can be used on any skin type. It also has no toxic side effects. ”

“Alright, alright. Thank you, ruofei!” Tian Huilan said happily, her tone even more cordial.

“You’re welcome,”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but sigh after he hung up the phone. Was this Facial Mask really that magical to women? Even Tian Huilan, who was a member of the Provincial Party Committee, had personally called.

He shook his head with a smile and started the car.

However, before he could start, his phone rang again.

Xia ruofei could not help but smile bitterly. He picked up his phone again and was shocked when he saw that it was elder song’s eldest son, song Zhengping, the Chief Judge of the xiangnan province.

“This time, it shouldn’t be for the jaded skin ointment, right?” Xia ruofei mumbled to himself as he picked up the phone.
