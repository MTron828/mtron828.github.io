2627 An interesting encounter (1)

“What?” Wang Boshan was stunned for a moment and asked,”martial uncle Zheng, you mean ... We should start from the higher ups of the agate?”

“I don’t know much about the Mutual Deception in the secular world, but since the Liu family won’t listen to anything, and that blue cloud Island is nominally the territory of ponautu, why don’t we make some trouble here?” Zheng Yongshou nodded and said. Wouldn’t it be easier to handle as long as they could take back the green cloud Island? It’s nothing more than some compensation from the state of bonaintu to the Liu family, we’ll pay for it! In addition, they had to feed their higher – ups! I don’t believe that they won’t be tempted if they can make two rounds of money on a small island!”

Wang Boshan criticized in his heart,’you still say that you don’t know how to deceive and scheme against each other? This was already black – bellied enough!

Although he thought so in his heart, he did not dare to say it out loud. He smiled apologetically and said,”martial uncle Zheng is indeed wise and resourceful!” No wonder you asked me to meet you here!”

“Stop flattering me!” Zheng Yongshou said in a reserved manner. Let’s see if this method works first? If there’s no problem, get it done as soon as possible!”

Wang Boshan said,”martial uncle Zheng, you don’t know this ... The Liu family has built the blue cloud Island into an impregnable fortress over the years. Their defensive ability is strong enough to resist the Army of the ponaattu country. You may not know this, but the Army of a small country like ponaattu is extremely weak ... So, the blue cloud Island is only considered as the territory of ponaattu in name. What’s more, they signed a permanent use transfer agreement, which can’t be taken back easily.” Therefore, whether it’s from the perspective of Dharma and logos or ability, there’s no way to take the agate map back to the blue cloud Island. ”

Zheng Yongshou coldly snorted and said,””As long as the ponyagu sect announces that they’re taking back the right to use the island, is there really no way for us to drive out that Liu family?”

“Junior uncle Zheng ...” Wang Boshan hesitated for a moment before saying,”if we use the sect’s power, it would be beyond the means of the secular world. This would not be in line with the original intention of the sect leader!”

After staying in the secular world for a long time, Wang Boshan was used to using secular means to solve problems. He didn’t agree with Zheng Yongshou’s plan in his heart.

Zheng Yongshou couldn’t help but angrily say,”this also won’t do!” That won’t do either! Was he going to keep dragging it out like this? If things go wrong ... Neither you nor I will be able to bear this responsibility!”

Wang Boshan said,”martial uncle Zheng, I’m still inclined to plan it slowly. After all, if we use the sect’s power, it will inevitably attract the attention of other forces. By then, it won’t be just our star Seizer sect who knows the secret of the blue cloud Island.” At least for now, no other cultivation forces have discovered the secret of the blue cloud Island. We still have time!”

How could Zheng Yongshou not know this? In fact, Qingfeng Luo attached great importance to the matters of the green cloud Island. In order to prevent the leak, only four people knew about this matter. In addition to Wang Boshan, Zheng Yongshou, and Qingfeng Luo himself, there was another disciple of the Yong generation who was responsible for dealing with Affairs of the secular world with Wang Boshan.

Moreover, this disciple of the Yong generation only knew a little bit of it. After Luo Qingfeng sent Zheng Yongshou to confirm the situation on the green cloud Island, that disciple no longer knew anything. Even so, Luo Qingfeng had already issued a gag order to this Yong generation disciple, strictly ordering him not to reveal a word. Even Chi Qingcheng, another disciple of the Qing generation of the star Seizer sect, did not know.

The reason why Luo Qingfeng was so careful was naturally to prevent the other sects from getting the news. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The star Seizer sect’s strength in the cultivation world could only be considered average. Although the sect’s strength had made a qualitative leap because of Luo Qingfeng’s breakthrough to the Golden core stage in the past few years, their Foundation was still lacking. Not only was he the only golden core cultivator, but the number of disciples in the upper levels of the Qi refining stage was also much lower than those of the older sects. If the other sects were to hear about this, the star Seizer sect would not have any advantage in seizing the green cloud Island.

After listening to Wang Boshan’s words, Zheng Yongshou also fell into deep thought. After a long time, he said,””Boshan, we can’t just keep waiting like this. There must be a procedure, right?”

Wang Boshan was already prepared for this, he said,””Martial uncle Zheng, I haven’t been idle these days. I’ve also spent a lot of time and effort in gathering information on the Liu family. As far as I know, the head of the Liu family is seriously ill, and it was this head of the Liu family who firmly refused our acquisition at the time. If he passes away, his children won’t be so interested in blue cloud Island, and we’ll have the opportunity to buy this Island for a certain price!”

“Oh?” Zheng Yongshou’s eyes lit up and he said,”there’s such a thing? Then ... Why don’t we add fuel to the fire and send this family head Liu on his way?”

“Uncle – Master Zheng, I don’t recommend doing this if it’s not necessary,” said Wang Boshan quickly. Firstly, I heard that the Liu family’s master is very sick, and he won’t be able to hold on for long even without our help.”Secondly ... The Liu family has a great influence in Huaxia. You don’t know much about the situation in the secular world. In short, there will be a certain risk in dealing with them. Even if we succeed, once we leave any traces, it will be impossible for us to acquire green cloud Island! So, my suggestion is to wait patiently ...”

Zheng Yongshou revealed a trace of hesitation.
