After the luncheon, Deputy Mayor ni and the others also took their leave. These leaders ‘daily schedules were very tight. They could attend the ceremony and the thank – you luncheon, but they might have postponed several meetings.

The employees returned to the Paradise building and began their real relocation.

Of course, in reality, many things were already in place in the early stages. This time, the main thing was to put some personal items in place, then clean up the work desk. The most important thing was to straighten out the working relationship.

After Xia ruofei sent Deputy – Mayor ni and the others away, he said to Feng Jing,””Sister che, I’ll head back to the farm first. You guys have to keep an eye on this place. It might be a little chaotic for the next few days, but I believe that everyone will adapt to the new environment very quickly.”

“Aren’t you going to take a look at the new headquarters?”Feng Jing asked. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“I’ve watched it a few times, but there’s nothing to see. ” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I have something to do. I’ll come back tomorrow!”

Feng Rao immediately understood and said with a smile,”I know, I still have a pretty girlfriend waiting at home! No wonder he’s so eager to go home ...”

There was a tinge of jealousy in her words, but Feng Rao didn’t notice it.

Xia ruofei touched his nose awkwardly and said,””I really do have something else to do when I get back ... By the way, how do you plan to settle your residence? It’s a little inconvenient to live on the farm. ”

Feng Rao rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,””Can you not change the topic so abruptly?”

However, since Xia ruofei had asked, she answered seriously,””I should still be living on the farm in the short term! After all, I’ve already gotten used to living there, and the company has arranged a bus, plus the executives will be getting a car soon. If I really work late, I can sleep in the office. There’s no need to find a place to stay. ”

Although Feng Jing’s office was not as big as Xia ruofei ‘s, it still took up half a floor. Other than the spacious office space, there was also a large suite as a lounge. It would not be a problem for her to live here.

However, an office was still an office. Xia ruofei felt that it was not appropriate to stay here for a long time.

“If you live on the farm, you have to commute for one to two hours every day!” Xia ruofei suggested,”why don’t we buy a house in the city? I’ll pay for it, and I’ll deduct it from your bonus at the end of the year!”

“We’ll see!” Feng Jing wasn’t in high spirits.”Don’t you live on the farm too?”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”I don’t plan to come to the peach blossom mansion every day. But I might buy a property in the city.”

At this point, Xia ruofei had an idea and said,””Why don’t we buy a residential area?”

When Xia ruofei said this, Feng Jing was slightly happy. However, what Xia ruofei said next made her roll her eyes ...

Xia ruofei said,”Qingxue said that there’s a villa for sale in her neighborhood. I’ll go and find out if there are any other villas for sale. Why don’t we each take one? you’re the CEO of a company, after all. You can’t live in a place that’s too shabby!” Otherwise, people will say that I’m mistreating you!”

“We’ll talk about it in the future!”Feng Rao said unhappily. I don’t want to move for the time being ...”

After saying that, she turned around and walked towards the bus that was waiting outside the hotel.

Xia ruofei was a little confused. He muttered to himself,””Why are you suddenly angry?”

Dong Yun had been at the side the whole time. She held back her laughter and looked at Xia ruofei, who had just realized something. She said,”Chairman, President Feng is not angry ...”

“If you’re not angry, then what are you?” Xia ruofei was even more confused.

Dong Yun sighed and didn’t continue on this topic. Instead, she said,”Chairman, since you’re not going to the headquarters later, I’ll report to you some of the recent arrangements!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”let’s talk while we walk!” My car’s over there, and the headquarters isn’t far from here. I’ll send you there first ...”

The driver for Xia ruofei today was still Xie Bing from the security Department. Recently, he had been protecting Xia ruofei regularly, and Xia ruofei had been driving less and less.

After Xia ruofei got into the car, Xie Bing asked,””President Xia, are you going back to the farm?”

“Let’s go to the company’s headquarters first,” Xia ruofei said,”go back to the farm after sending CEO Dong back.”

“Yes!” Xie Bing replied and started the car steadily.

“President, the car purchase and the expansion of the security Department, including the recruitment of drivers, are all being carried out at the same time,” said Dong Yun. “But it may take some time for them to be in place.” At present, we have calculated that there are about 20 employees still living on the farm, so we need to send a bus every morning and night. We have already talked about a bus that will be responsible for sending and sending them every day. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes, you can arrange these things.” Also, the rental Allowance for the employees had to be paid as soon as possible, and it had to be reflected in next month’s salary. Young people don’t have high salaries, and our headquarters is in the city center. The rent nearby is not cheap, so it’s not a small expense for them. We have to quickly implement the benefits that they should have. ”

“I understand! The finance department is already doing the calculations and auditing. The employees who meet the requirements for next month’s salary will be able to receive the rental Allowance. ” Dong Yun said.

Then, Dong Yun reported to Xia ruofei about other work arrangements, all of which were related to the daily management of the company. Although it did not seem like a big deal, the company had just moved to the new headquarters and there were some details that had to be paid attention to. Hence, Xia ruofei listened attentively.

It was obvious that Dong Yun was a capable person. No wonder Feng Jing strongly recommended her as the Vice President. Of course, she was only showing her ability in management. The Vice President had a wider range of work to be responsible for, and it was still to be seen if she could do it.

The Shangri – La hotel wasn’t far from the company’s headquarters, and the car soon arrived at the Tao Yuan building.

“Chairman, that’s basically what I have to report.” Dong Yun said,”I-I’ll go up first!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Mm! Everyone has worked hard these past few days, especially you, President Dong. You’ve really worked hard. After the company’s headquarters has stabilized, you can take a few days off!”

“I won’t feel tired doing the work I like!” Dong Yun said with a smile. Chairman, I don’t need to rest ...”

She got out of the car, waved at Xia ruofei, and walked into the building.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but shake his head. The female generals in the company were all capable and capable, and they were all strong women. He was really worried that they would not be able to get married ...

“Xie Bing, let’s go back to the farm!” Xia ruofei said.

“Alright, director Xia!” Xie Bing said.

When the Knight XV entered the gate of the farm, Xia ruofei started to get excited.

Xia Qing had already finished brewing the Chinese medicine, and Ling Qingxue could take the second dose today. Xia ruofei had paid a huge price for this Chinese medicine, which used heart – concentrating grass as the main ingredient. How effective it would be would depend on this.

If Xia ruofei was not satisfied with the improvement in his cultivation talent, then that was the only way. Although the heart – concentrating grass did not have any resistance, the effects would only get worse if he continued to consume it.

Otherwise, one’s talent could be improved infinitely as long as one kept taking the heart – concentrating herb. This was not in line with the laws of heaven. Of course, the heart – concentrating herb was very rare, and a ‘prodigal’ like Xia ruofei was even more rare.

After returning to the villa, Xie Bing drove the Knight XV to the security station on the farm to wash the car while Xia ruofei walked in.

He used his mental power to scan the area and found that Ling Qingxue was taking a nap in her bedroom upstairs. This was even better. He didn’t have to explain how he went out to attend the moving ceremony, and then come back with the finished medicine.

Xia ruofei took out the bowl of medicine that Xia Qing had brewed from the medium. He also took out the dregs of the medicine and threw them into the rubbish bin in the kitchen. Then, he took the bowl of medicine and walked upstairs.
