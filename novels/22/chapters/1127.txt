Chapter 1128: Expert Xia picks up a bargain (1)

Translator: 549690339

“Boss an, I’ll remember your ‘kindness’.” Xu Qiang stared into fatty an’s eyes and said,”let’s just keep going! Also, I have a lot of friends in the circle of cultural relics in the capital. When boss an comes to the capital to do business in the future ... Hehe!”

Fatty an’s expression changed slightly and he said,””Boss Xu, what do you mean? How can you guarantee that antiques won’t be eye – catching? If so many experts can’t see the problem, how can my cousin and I be sure? We’re not trying to deceive you!”

Song Rui sneered and said,””Just now, my brother said that several sides of this cabinet are made of new materials. Didn’t your cousin just say that it has been passed down for seven or eight generations? That’s a few hundred years!”

Fatty an was at a loss for words, but his reaction was still relatively fast. He immediately thought of something and said,””I really didn’t know! My cousin must have been hiding it from me! I ... I’m actually a distant cousin of his. We haven’t been in contact for many years. This time, he came to me and said that his family was in trouble and wanted to sell a treasure. I ... I didn’t expect him to lie to me! This ... Isn’t this ruining my reputation?”

This was not the first time that fatty an and Wang xingshui had set up a trap. In fact, they had a team. Some of them were responsible for making fake goods, while others played different roles. Wang xingshui, who looked honest, was naturally playing the role of a farmer who sold antiques at a low price because he didn’t know what was good, while fatty an was an antique merchant with a wide circle of friends.

It wasn’t easy for fatty an to build up a good reputation and accumulate a lot of connections. The previous few schemes he had set up had never failed, and no one had found out that it was him who had done it. This identity would be very helpful for him to continue his schemes in the future.

In comparison, Wang xingshui’s role was not as important.

Under such a situation, fatty an naturally sacrificed Wang xingshui at the first moment and threw him out to take the blow.

After fatty an finished, he even secretly gave Wang xingshui a look. Of course, this could not be hidden from Xia ruofei’s eyes.

The two of them had obviously come up with a plan. Wang xingshui was only stunned for a moment before he immediately put on a guilty look and sighed,””This little brother has sharp eyes. I admit defeat ... Don’t blame me, cousin an. If I had a choice, I wouldn’t have to do this ...”

“You ... Aren’t you scamming me?” Fatty an pretended to be heartbroken.”Boss Xu is my good friend. I recommended you to him because I trusted you. I didn’t expect you to be such an ungrateful Wolf!”

Xia ruofei and the others were watching coldly from the side. They watched the two of them acting out their scenes but did not interrupt them.

After fatty an scolded Wang xingshui, Zhao Yongjun said with a sneer,””Fatty an, do you really think we’re three years old? Alright! Take your ‘baby’ and leave!”

Normally, people in the antique circle wouldn’t make things clear. Even if they saw something wrong with the item, they would only say things like “it’s hard to say” or “it’s not accurate”. The seller naturally understood. When the other party saw the flaw, they would basically pack up and leave.

But today, fatty an’s targeting of Xia ruofei had angered Zhao Yongjun. He didn’t even give fatty an the chance to go with the flow.

Fatty an’s face turned red and white. After a moment of silence, he asked Wang xingshui to carry the incense cabinet. Then, he said,””Boss Zhao, boss Xu, I really didn’t mean it this time, but the two of you have misunderstood me too deeply. I won’t explain anything. In a few days, I’ll hold a banquet to apologize to boss Xu!”

Zhao Yongjun saw that fatty an still didn’t recognize the situation and didn’t even mention Xia ruofei, and he was even more furious.

In fact, fatty an could tell that Zhao Yongjun was protective of Xia ruofei, but he couldn’t imagine the power Zhao Yongjun had. Plus, Xia ruofei didn’t hold back at all just now, ruining his seemingly flawless plan. He was still angry, so he didn’t even look at Xia ruofei.

Zhao Yongjun laughed coldly.”Forget about the banquet. I don’t have the habit of drinking with a cheater!”

“This ...” Fatty an forced a smile, put on a helpless look, shook his head, and walked out with Wang xingshui.

Zhao Yong Jun shouted from behind fatty an,””Fatty an, you should come to the capital less in the future! Don’t ask for a snub! In addition ... I have some friendship with the grandson of Tianjin Port. I’ll tell him about your glorious deeds! Good luck!”

Fatty an’s expression suddenly changed, and he couldn’t help but stop in his tracks.

Grandpa sun was an influential figure in the antique circle of Tianjin and Hong Kong. A quarter of the antique market in Tianjin and Hong Kong was controlled by his antique store. His connections in the antique circle were even more unparalleled.

If Zhao Yongjun was really close to Grandpa sun and told him about fatty an’s cheating, then fatty an would definitely become a street rat in the antique circle of Jin Gang city.

At first, fatty an was still feeling sorry for losing the Beijing market, but he didn’t expect the situation to be so much worse than he had imagined. If Zhao Yongjun wasn’t bragging, then his base, Jin Gang city, had already “fallen”, and the connections he had built over the years would be destroyed.

Fatty an’s heart also sank to the bottom.

But this was the capital, and Zhao Yongjun seemed to be very powerful, so fatty an didn’t dare to act rashly. He just looked back, gritted his teeth, and left with Wang xingshui.
