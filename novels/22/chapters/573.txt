Chapter 574: Chapter 437 – in full swing (1)

Xia ruofei was in Feng Jing’s office when he received the call.

When he drove back to Tao Yuan farm, it was already past two in the afternoon. He took a bath and slept until the evening, when he was about to get off work, and then walked to the complex building on the farm.

He had been away for a few days, so he naturally needed to hear Feng Jing’s report. He also had some work to hand over to Feng Jing, mainly about the iron – skinned Kaede fight.

Feng Jing was focused on a report. Xia ruofei used his eyes to stop the newly appointed head assistant, Liu Qian, and directly knocked on the door before entering Feng Jing’s office.

“What’s the matter?”Feng Rao asked without raising her head.

She didn’t get an answer for a long time, so she looked up curiously. When she saw that it was Xia ruofei who came in, she was surprised and stood up quickly.

Feng Rao said with a reproachful expression,”Chairman, you’re back! Why didn’t you make a sound? I thought it was Liu Qian ...”

Xia ruofei laughed.”I didn’t say hello. That’s the only way I can see CEO Feng working tirelessly.”

“Chairman, it’s working hours now. I can’t say that you’ve forgotten to eat and sleep ...” Feng Jing blushed.”By the way, can I report to you the company’s situation over the past few days?”

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”There’s no rush. I have a few urgent matters to attend to. Let me tell you first ... You should arrange the work as soon as possible.”

At this moment, Xia ruofei’s phone rang. It was boss Qian.

“Chairman, do you want me to leave for a moment?” Feng Jing said with a smile.

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.””I’m fine! I didn’t do anything shameful ...”

......

Xia ruofei then walked to the sofa in the office and sat down. At the same time, he picked up his phone.

“Uncle Qian!” Xia ruofei called out with a warm smile.

“RUO Fei! Are you home yet? Was your journey smooth?” Boss Qian asked enthusiastically.

“I arrived at two in the afternoon. It was quite smooth!” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”what’s the matter, uncle Qian?”

“Oh ... It’s about that Wang Jinsheng ...” Boss Qian said,”that old bastard has been living in Anyue city for the past few days. He didn’t dare to return to xiangnan without your permission!” And now you’re here today, begging me to say hello ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh when he heard that. It seemed that song Rui was very hardworking! Wang Jinsheng was scared out of his wits. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”uncle Qian, what do you think?” Should we give him some more suffering?”

Boss Qian sighed and said,”forget it!” To me, I’m already very lucky to have gotten my money back. I don’t want to have anything to do with him anymore. I’ll just pretend that I was blind and mistook him for someone else. ”

“Alright then!” Xia ruofei replied readily,”tell him that he can get lost now! I’ll let my friend know. ”

“Alright!” Boss Qian smiled and said,”ruofei! If you have time, come to visit us in Anyue city. We welcome you to be our guest at any time!”

“Alright! Uncle Qian, you’re also welcome to visit Sanshan city when you’re free!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

After hanging up, Xia ruofei looked up at Feng Jing and said,””President Feng, please wait a moment. I need to make a call.”

After that, Xia ruofei called song Rui and told him about the matter briefly. He asked him to inform the people in xiangnan province to stop all the actions against Liu Jinsheng. This matter would come to an end.

In Anyue city, boss Qian gave Liu Jinsheng a call. He did not waste time talking to Liu Jinsheng, but just said coldly,””Mr. Xia has spoken. You can get lost now!”

Liu Jinsheng felt as if he had been granted Amnesty and repeatedly thanked him. However, boss Qian was not interested in listening at all and directly hung up the phone.

To loathe a person to the extreme, that was absolute indifference. Even talking to him made him feel uncomfortable. Boss Qian was in such a state.

After Liu Jinsheng finished the call with boss Qian, he packed his things and left Anyue city overnight. He did not want to stay a second longer after returning to xiangnan province.

This incident had a huge impact on him. In addition to being forced to spit out a piece of fat meat in his mouth, his business had also suffered a serious loss. He didn’t know how long it would take for him to recover.

This was very similar to boss Qian’s state after he was cheated. This was also an eye for an eye!

Sanshan city, Taoyuan farm.

After Xia ruofei finished his call with song Rui, he smiled and waved at Feng Rao.”President Feng, come over and sit here!”

Feng Rao personally made Xia ruofei a cup of tea and sat down on the sofa opposite Xia ruofei. She smiled and asked,””Chairman, what important instructions do you have for coming to my office as soon as you come back? Don’t tell me you’re trying to put pressure on me again!”

Xia ruofei leaned back on the soft sofa comfortably and said with a smile,””It’s a must to carry the burden! An able man should do more work!”

“You’re exploiting my labor! You have to raise my salary!” Feng Jing said coyly.

After getting to know Xia ruofei better, Feng Jing was no longer as reserved as before. She would even reveal her girlish side from time to time. There was a hint of gentleness in her mature office lady style. It was a unique style.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”sure!” I’ll give you a big red packet at the end of the year! But I don’t think you’ll care about the red packet anymore. The company’s dividends will be the biggest part!”
