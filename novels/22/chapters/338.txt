Chapter 339: Have you finished loading that thing?

Jiang Yue’s eyes were filled with worry. In comparison, Lu You was much calmer. She had seen Xia ruofei create miracles time and time again. Unknowingly, she had developed a blind trust in Xia ruofei. Peng Hui, who was at the side, said in a strange tone: “With master Xia here, what problem can there be? Master Xia, I’ve specially called all the students from the gardening club over. Let’s all witness the miracle you’ve created!” Xia ruofei glanced at Peng Hui and said,””You’re really considerate ...” With that, Xia ruofei pushed the door open and got out of the car. Lu You also cast a questioning look at Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei nodded slightly at her and gave her an affirmative look. Lu You’s face instantly revealed a smile. At this moment, a tall and thin boy walked over and asked,””Lu You, is this Mr. Xia?” Lu You nodded and said to Xia ruofei,””Xia ruofei, this is the president of our landscaper club. He’s senior Xia Cheng from the College of Bioengineering. He’s in his fourth year today.” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded at Xia Cheng,””Hello, President Xia. We’re still from the same family!” Xia Cheng also chuckled and said,”Mr. Xia, you can just call me Xia Cheng. I heard from Peng Hui that you can cure that precious jade lion, and it will only take three days. I was very curious, so I came to take a look. I wonder how the Jade lion is doing now?” Before Xia ruofei could speak, Chen Song, who was with Peng Hui and the rest, came over and pouted.””Xia Cheng, you’re considered half a professional now. How could you believe such a ridiculous thing? I heard that a teacher from your side couldn’t even settle it! Besides, the treatment of the disease in the orchid requires a long process. How can it be recovered in three days?” Xia Cheng smiled.”Just because we can’t do it doesn’t mean that everyone can ‘t. Perhaps Mr. Xia already has a plan in mind!” “Xia Cheng,” Chen Song sneered,”I know that Sanshan University has placed all their hopes on that orchid for this Flower Fair, but I advise you to keep such unrealistic fantasies to yourself! Everything must be done with science. ” After Xia Cheng heard this, her expression turned ugly. Chen Song, on the other hand, looked at Lu You with a burning gaze before he said to Xia Cheng,””Xia Cheng, we’ve known each other for a long time. Don’t say that I’m not a good friend. I even brought you a pot of orchids this time. Although it’s not as precious as the Jade lion, it’s definitely enough for you to participate in the flower exhibition. Even if it’s not as good as the flowers exhibited by our Agriculture and Forestry University, at least it won’t be the last.” After Jiang Yue heard this, she could not help but frown,””How do you know that brother Xia can’t cure our Mo Lan? This is an exhibition that Sanshan University’s gardening club is participating in. We don’t need to borrow other people’s orchids to cheat!” Xia Cheng did not reject him directly, but hesitated. It wasn’t just Xia Cheng. The other students of the horticultural church were also discussing this in low voices. “This Chen Song is too arrogant! Aren’t they bullying us because there’s no one in Sanshan University’s gardening club?” “You can’t say that. It’s not bad that he’s willing to lend us a pot of orchids! Without Lu You’s pot of ink orchid, we can’t bring out any other flowers at all. We’ll definitely be at the bottom of the list if we go to the exhibition! That’ll be a real loss of face!” “How do you know that pot of mo orchid won’t work? I think Lu You and Jiang Yue are pretty confident in that Mr. Xia!” “Stop joking! Is this your first day in the garden Arts Club? That pot of orchid was so seriously ill that it might not even recover in 30 days, let alone three days. Besides, even Mr. Xu couldn’t find the real cause of the illness. Xia ruofei is so young. I don’t think he can even find the cause!” “I don’t think so ...” Obviously, Chen Song had also heard everyone’s discussion. He could not help but reveal a proud expression. He quickly walked to the Toyota parked at the side and took out a pot of orchids. “Xia Cheng,” Chen Song said to Xia Cheng,”this pot is a new species of Hui LAN, the yellow flower, yellow tongue, and plain heart.” The leaves were half slanted, thick and strong, and the tongue was yellow like jade. The grass was also yellow, with a little bit of the smell of deformed spotted grass. It was a very unique vegetarian heart. Originally, we were planning to use this pot of Hui LAN to attend the flower show, but later we had better options, so we didn’t choose it. ” When Xia Cheng saw the pot of Hui LAN that Chen Song brought over, her eyes couldn’t help but light up as she revealed a look of admiration. Most of the students in the garden art Club knew what was good. Everyone could see that this pot of Hui LAN was indeed a rare and exquisite product. Although it was not as precious as the Jade lion, it was definitely not an ordinary product. Although the Jade lion was precious, it had been seriously ill. Even if this pot of Hui LAN was slightly inferior, it was still much better than the other flowers in their gardening club that couldn’t be presented. The students of the Garden Club couldn’t help but discuss in low voices. Chen Song placed Hui LAN on the ground, feeling a little proud. Then, he looked at Lu You and said,””Junior Lu, as long as you say the word, I’ll lend this pot of Hui LAN to your Sanshan University. Just treat it as us making friends.” Peng Hui furrowed his brows secretly. He had initially asked Chen Song to come over to support him, but Chen Song seemed to have other thoughts about Lu You. This made him very uncomfortable. However, you Jun, who was standing at the side, did not have such thoughts. His target was Jiang Yue, who was by Lu You’s side. As long as Chen Song did not have any intention of pursuing Jiang Yue, he naturally did not care. Therefore, you Jun immediately said,’senior Xia Cheng, Lu You, this pot of Hui LAN is really not bad! I think it’s better to be down – to – Earth and borrow this pot of Hui LAN to deal with the flower exhibition first than to have unrealistic hopes of a miracle happening ...” Xia Cheng also revealed a look of interest as he looked at Lu You. Lu You pouted and turned to look at Xia ruofei. She said,””You’ve been watching the show for so long, it’s time for you to take out my Mo Lan!” Xia ruofei chuckled.”I’m just embarrassed. I didn’t want to interrupt his act.” Jiang Yue couldn’t help but burst out laughing and said,”Brother Xia, you’re swearing ...” Xia ruofei shrugged and said with an innocent look,””Is there? Didn’t I just use ‘that’ instead?” “You’re just good with words, aren’t you?”Chen song’s face darkened. If you have the ability, then bring out the mo Lan you cured! Everyone knew that it was impossible! Maybe you came here without fear because you have money, so you bought a pot of more precious orchids!” The more Chen Song spoke, the more he felt that his analysis made sense. He continued,”But so what? That doesn’t change the fact that you’ve been bragging! Although this pot of Hui LAN isn’t particularly precious, I’ve cultivated it myself with great care, and it’s full of sincerity!” Xia ruofei smiled faintly and said,”I didn’t say anything since I got off the car. You’ve already finished talking.” I’ll just ask, when did I say that the orchid wasn’t cured?” With that, Xia ruofei opened the door to the passenger’s seat and took out a flower pot. He placed it gently on the ground. Then he pouted and said,”well ... Three days is too short. I can only recover to this extent. If I can’t meet the standards for the flower exhibition, I’m willing to admit my loss. I’ll go buy another pot of orchids now.” Peng Hui immediately replied,”haha!” He had really blown his own trumpet! Three days ago, didn’t you Pat your chest and say that it would be no problem? Why is it now ...” Peng Hui was speaking halfway when he felt that the surroundings were very quiet. Then he found that everyone was staring at the pot of orchids on the ground, their eyes full of disbelief. Peng Hui also cast his gaze over, somewhat puzzled. Hiss ... Peng Hui immediately sucked in a breath of cold air, his entire body as if petrified.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels
