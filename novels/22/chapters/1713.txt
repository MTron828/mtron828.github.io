Chapter 1714: Haoran’s breakthrough (3)

“Senior granduncle, it wasn’t easy for me to find my sect. You’re the sect leader, senior granduncle. Of course, I have to follow you!” Li Yifu quickly said.

Xia ruofei could not help but feel a headache coming on. He could endure it for a day or two occasionally, but if there was an old man with a white beard following him around every day and even kneeling down to beg for forgiveness every now and then, what was the point of living?

He quickly said gently,”foster husband, there’s no need for this, right?” You have your own business and life in the United States. Besides, communication is so advanced now. If something really happens, you can get in touch with a phone call!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Xia ruofei did not quite understand the fanatical obsession of the older generation towards their sect and clan. He did not know that he had even become Li Yifu’s spiritual sustenance. This was something that Li Jiu Zhou could not forget even before he died! Now that he had finally “caught” the Grand uncle – Master, of course he had to follow closely. Otherwise, what if he ran away?

Li Yifu said stubbornly,”martial granduncle, the businesses are just worldly possessions. Besides, it’s the younger generation of the family who are in charge of them now. I rarely ask about the family affairs anymore. Martial granduncle, please let your disciples follow you!” This disciple also wants to listen to senior granduncle’s teachings at any time!”

Xia ruofei refused flatly,”adopted husband, I’m telling you, there’s no room for discussion!” I still have my own life to live! You can ask me if you have any questions about cultivation, but you can’t stay by my side all day!”

Li Yifu didn’t expect Xia ruofei to be so determined. He was extremely disappointed, but he didn’t dare to disobey his senior granduncle’s order. He could only sigh and say respectfully,””Yes, this disciple will follow your orders!”

Xia ruofei was also secretly glad that his senior granduncle’s authority still had some effect. He didn’t have to bring an old child with him, or else he would really go crazy.

“Let’s go! Let’s go have breakfast!” Xia ruofei said.

Tang Yitian and the others had already woken up. They knew that Li Yifu was waiting for Xia ruofei at the door. However, Li Yifu’s status was too high, so they didn’t dare to persuade him.

At this time, seeing Xia ruofei and Li Yifu walking over one after another, Tang Yitian immediately invited everyone to have breakfast.

The breakfast was naturally also incomparably sumptuous. It was all carefully prepared by Tang Yitian’s private chef, and there were a variety of Western and Chinese food choices.

Xia ruofei preferred Chinese breakfast with buns, soy milk, and deep – fried breadsticks rather than exquisite pastries.

He held a deep – fried dough stick in one hand, soaked it in soy milk, and took a big bite. While chewing, he asked with a smile,””Big brother Tang, what’s the arrangement today? It’s sister ran’s first time in the suttani!”

Tang Yitian smiled and said,”then I’ll accompany you to walk around in Xi Teni!” The scenery here is pretty good!”

Originally, Tang Yitian was prepared to let Jennifer accompany him. They had such a close relationship with Xia ruofei that it would be no problem for Jennifer to accompany him. However, now that Li Yifu was here, Tang Yitian also changed his mind. He put the company’s matters aside and personally accompanied him for the whole process.

“Sister che, you can think about where you want to go and tell brother Tang!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Feng Rao was a little embarrassed. “I’m fine with anything! If it’s possible, I want to return to China earlier! I’ve been out for too long this time, and the company is a little worried ...”

“President Feng, you’re a successful career woman!” Tang Yitian said with a smile.

At this moment, Xia ruofei’s phone rang. He stood up and said,””I’m sorry! I’ll take this call ...”

With that, he took his phone and walked to the side. He glanced at the caller ID and found that it was a sutsune landline number.

Xia ruofei muttered in his heart, but he still pressed the answer button.

“hello!”Xia ruofei said in English.

On the other end of the phone was a sweet female voice in English,””Hello, are you Mr. Xia ruofei?”

“I am, and may I know who you are?” Xia ruofei asked.

The female voice on the other end of the phone suddenly became much more enthusiastic and said,””Hello! I’m the Secretary of Air Australia’s senior vice president, Mr. Tony. Our company will be holding a press conference in sithiny tomorrow. Mr. Tony hopes you can take the time to attend!”
