Chapter 493: The moonless and windy night (1)

It was not the first time Xia ruofei had killed someone.

In fact, he couldn’t even count how many lives he had ended.

However, in the past, he had killed people “legally”. After taking off his military uniform and becoming a normal person, this was the first time he had personally taken someone’s life.

However, Xia ruofei was very calm.

This was because the four people he had killed were all scumbags of society who deserved to die. Such people would only continue to do evil for the Tiger and cause more harm to the world.

Besides, if he couldn’t even protect his own woman, then Xia ruofei was really not a man.

There was no one on the mountain road at night. Xia ruofei took out the pickup truck from the spirit map space.

He checked on Ling Qingxue’s condition. Her breathing was very stable, and her heart was beating very fast. However, she would not wake up for a while.

Xia ruofei did not wake Ling Qingxue up immediately. Instead, he sent her into the stone room in the new space. With his control of the space, he gently placed Ling Qingxue on the stone bed.

Then, Xia ruofei sat in the driver’s seat of the pickup truck, started the car, and went down the mountain.

Of course, Xia ruofei did not forget to pay attention to Ling Qingxue’s condition throughout the entire process.

The moment Ling Qingxue showed signs of waking up, Xia ruofei would immediately send her out of the spirit map space.

The pickup truck snaked down the mountain road.

As they were moving, Xia ruofei heard a few muffled explosions. It was obvious that the damage he had done to the car’s fuel tank had worked. The fuel had leaked out and caused the explosion.

Xia ruofei drove for seven to eight minutes and the pickup truck was about to reach the foot of the mountain. He stopped the car by the side.

That was because the MPV was lying on its back on the small slope on the right side of the road. A large rock blocked it, preventing it from rolling down.

Xia ruofei looked up. His eyesight was far better than ordinary people ‘s, but he could only see about 20 to 30 meters away. The SUV fell from the cliff above him, and the drop was at least 100 to 200 meters.

It had taken Xia ruofei more than eight minutes to get here from the car crash, but the MPV had rolled and crashed to the ground in just ten to twenty seconds.

The impact during this period, coupled with the burning and explosion ... The four people in the car should have been completely dead.

However, since the van was hanging on the side of the road, Xia ruofei had to check it out. He opened the door, jumped out, and walked forward.

The MPV had been burned to the ground, leaving only a skeleton. The fire had basically been extinguished. The possibility of another explosion was very low. Xia ruofei was at ease and boldly walked closer to check.

When they were two to three meters away from the car, Xia ruofei could clearly feel a wave of heat. The temperature had also increased.

This level of high temperature did not affect Xia ruofei at all. He did not stop walking and walked straight to the front of the car that had been completely destroyed. He took out a strong flashlight from the medium and shone it into the car.

One, two, three, four ...

Xia ruofei quickly found the four bodies in the car. They had been burnt beyond recognition and their bodies were charred black. It was impossible to identify who they were.

It was a miracle that no one had been thrown out of the car after falling from such a high cliff.

This was the best result. The violent impact, burning, and explosion had erased all the traces. Even if the Super detective were to come back, he would not be able to find any clues from the wreckage of the car and the four bodies.

Xia ruofei put away the flashlight and drove away in his pickup truck without looking back.

Xia ruofei’s destination was the green Bull Mountain Resort that was 60 kilometers away. Revenge was not to be taken overnight. No matter how powerful Liang Haiming’s background was, he would not be able to escape death tonight!

……

The pickup truck sped through the night. The faint light from the dashboard in the car shone on Xia ruofei’s calm face. He was focused on driving, but his brain was working at high speed.

It was not difficult to kill Liang Haiming, but the difficult part was how to leave no traces and not let anyone suspect him.

In fact, as long as Liang Haiming was dead, no matter how careful Xia ruofei was, the Liang family would eventually suspect him.

Because once Liang Haiming died, it would cause a huge uproar in the Liang family. Then, everything that happened before Liang Haiming’s death would be magnified infinitely. The fact that Liang Haiming had repeatedly sent people to deal with Xia ruofei would definitely be known.

In that case, Xia ruofei would become a highly suspicious target.

The Liang family didn’t need concrete evidence. As long as Xia ruofei had the motive, their thunderous revenge would most likely fall on Xia ruofei.

Unless ... This matter could be done perfectly. Even the most paranoid person would only think that Liang Haiming’s death was an accident and that there was no human factor in it.

However, this was too difficult. Many seemingly accidental incidents, such as car accidents, floods, sudden acute illnesses, and so on, could not withstand a thorough investigation. It was impossible to leave no traces behind.

As Xia ruofei drove, he was thinking of a way to get rid of Liang Haiming without anyone knowing.

At the same time, he still had a bit of attention on Ling Qingxue’s condition in the space, in case she suddenly woke up.

It was the connection to the new space that gave Xia ruofei a sudden inspiration. He thought of a wonderful way to hide it from everyone.

The corners of his mouth curled up slightly, and he had already quickly conceived a complete plan for tonight’s operation in his mind.

Xia ruofei increased his speed. The pickup truck sped forward in the dark. He was going to complete an unprecedented attack today.

……

Green Bull Mountain Resort, a small villa with its back against the mountain wall and facing an artificial lake.

It was still cold outside, but it was warm inside.

Liang Haiming was wearing an expensive silk nightgown, sitting on the soft leather sofa with his legs crossed.

He had a Cuba kuiba cigar in his right hand and a glass of red wine in his right hand. He gently swirled the wine in the glass, looking very pleased.

“Any news from Heibao?” Liang Haiming asked.

The middle – aged man who had been standing not far from Liang Haiming quickly said,””They called forty minutes ago to say that they’ve succeeded. They should be on their way now ...”

Liang Haiming narrowed his eyes and nodded.

Then, he put down the glass of red wine and picked up the stack of documents on the coffee table.

There were more than ten photos of Ling Qingxue, and the background was all outdoors. Obviously, Liang Haiming’s men had secretly taken them.

Liang Haiming looked at the photos and couldn’t help but stick out his tongue to lick his lips. His eyes were full of lust.

“Mister Liang, do you need me to call and rush you?” The middle – aged man asked carefully.

Liang Haiming thought for a while and shook his head.”Forget it! I trust Heibao. Since we’ve already succeeded, we’ll just have to wait patiently ...”

If it had been another subordinate instead of Heibao, Liang Haiming would not have been so patient and would have called him to hurry him.

However, Black Panther was different. He was a true master, and Liang Haiming had the honor to meet his master once in the capital, which made him look up to him even more. For such a powerful person with a powerful master background, Liang Haiming naturally wanted to win him over.

Therefore, he had always been friendly to Black Panther and had never revealed his dandy and domineering face in front of him.

“By the way, get them to prepare my room,” Liang Haiming added.

“Yes, young master Liang!” The middle – aged man quickly responded.

The middle – aged man had been with Liang Haiming for many years, so he naturally knew what Liang Haiming meant by “preparation.”

Speaking of which, Liang Haiming and that unlucky Fang Luo had the same hobby. He liked to add more exciting content when he was having sex with women.

Especially in the past few years, he had been hollowed out by wine and women. If he didn’t have those little devices to increase the excitement, it would be difficult for him to even get hard.

This kind of thing was simply irresistible for those who liked it, but for those who did not have such a hobby, it was no different from a kind of torture.

Therefore, in the eyes of many women who had slept with Liang Haiming, this young master of the Liang family was simply a devil. Many people would shudder when they thought of the scenes when they were with Liang Haiming.

Not to mention, many of them had been raped by Liang Haiming through various means. For them, it was simply a nightmare!

The most extreme one was when a girl, after being defiled by Liang Haiming, directly jumped from a hotel room on the 18th floor naked and died on the spot.

However, just because Liang Haiming was a member of the Liang family, this matter was left unsettled.

In a sense, Liang Haiming deserved to die. If Xia ruofei’s operation was successful tonight, the souls of the girls would be celebrating.

The middle – aged man hurriedly went to make arrangements. Liang Haiming thought that he would be able to humiliate the long – legged beauty in a while, and he couldn’t help but feel hot. He raised his voice and said,”Work hard! When I’m tired of playing with her, I’ll reward you with a taste! I’ll let you be the first one, hahaha ...”

A bitter smile appeared on the middle – aged man’s face, but he quickly turned around. The bitter smile on his face was replaced with a flattering expression as he bowed and said,””Thank you, young master Liang!” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Go!” Liang Haiming said, waving his hand. Then, his greedy eyes fell on Ling Qingxue’s photo.

……

The clouds were very low tonight, and the moon was already hidden in the clouds. Xia ruofei flew all the way and arrived near the green Bull Mountain Resort in about thirty minutes.

However, he didn’t drive straight out of the resort. Instead, he found a quiet place on the National Highway, turned the car into a small road, and stopped by the side.

He took out a set of black clothes from the space and put on a black mask. Then, he got out of the car. His figure flashed, and under the cover of the night, he shot in the direction of the green Bull Mountain Resort ...
