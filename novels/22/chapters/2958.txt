Chapter 2959  A good start (1)

    Luo Qingfeng smiled and said!" It's a bit late. Sect leader Shao is worried that I'll change my mind! As soon as the item was delivered, he hurriedly accepted it!"

  "That's good!" Xia ruofei smiled and asked,"is there a problem with the order of the auction?"

  Xia ruofei hoped that his three items would be auctioned before the pair of storage rings. That way, he would know how many spiritual stones he would have.

  Of course, Xia ruofei and the other two had a rough idea of how many spiritual stones these three items would be sold for. However, it would be better if they could confirm it in advance so that they would not have to worry about the consequences when they bid for the storage ring.

  "No problem! The three items will be placed in front of the storage ring!" Luo Qingfeng smiled and said,"moreover, sect leader Shao also said that our Qi - gathering pill will be the first item to be put on display in the opening auction!"

  "Oh? It seems that the falling leaves sect is also quite optimistic about our Qi gathering pill!" Xia ruofei said with a smile.

  Generally speaking, the first item to be auctioned in an auction would definitely not be the most precious, but it would definitely be much better than ordinary items. The Chinese paid particular attention to a good start. The first item to be auctioned must be of high quality and could quickly stir up the atmosphere. From this perspective, the Qi gathering pill was undoubtedly very suitable.

  To Xia ruofei, this was a good thing.

  The reason was simple. The auction had just started, and it meant that everyone had a lot of spirit stones in their pockets, and their purchasing power was very high. Although some people were reluctant to use a large number of spirit stones at the beginning, as long as the item was good enough, it could still attract many people to change their minds and compete for the Qi - gathering pill. Under such circumstances, everyone had a lot of spirit stones on hand, so the price would naturally be raised even higher.

  The three of them were looking forward to the auction. They sat down on the sofa and chatted while drinking juice, waiting for the auction to start.

  About 20 minutes later, Xia ruofei saw the lights around the main auction stage dim down, and the spotlight shone on the entrance of the stage.

  "It's about to start!"He said with a smile.

  Sure enough, an old man in a blue gown walked up to the stage with a smile on his face. The spotlight moved with him until he stood in front of the microphone in the middle of the main auction stage, every box could clearly hear his voice.

  Cultivators "auction didn't have many empty words. After Hao Qingsong said a few simple words, auction stage.

  This person was the Golden core elder of the fallen leaves sect, Hao Qingsong. Yesterday, when Xia ruofei and the others arrived at the hotel, Hao Qingsong had personally received them.

  With a smile, Hao Qingsong said,"the falling leaf sect is very honored to be able to host this year's auction. On behalf of sect master Shao and all the disciples of the falling leaf sect, I welcome all the fellow Daoists here. I would also like to thank all of you for providing us with treasures, which have allowed the tradition of mutual exchange in the Chinese cultivation world to continue to be carried forward!" Now, the auction officially begins!"

  Although the hearing of cultivators was extremely good, the fallen leaf sect still installed a ceiling - Type three - dimensional speaker in every box. Although Hao Qingsong was speaking on the main auction stage, every box could clearly hear his voice.

  Cultivators "auction didn't have many empty words. After Hao Qingsong said a few simple words, he immediately announced the official start of the auction.

  As soon as his voice fell, a female disciple of the falling leaves sect walked out of the stage with a tray. The tray was covered with a red silk cloth, so it was naturally impossible to see what was inside with the naked eye.

  Xia ruofei sat up straight and said with a smile,""It's time for our Qi gathering pill to appear!"

  The moment the female disciple went on stage, Xia ruofei scanned her with his spiritual power. Of course, there were many cultivators who did the same. However, Xia ruofei only needed to check the three porcelain bottles under the red silk. He had personally bottled the ethereal energy gathering pills.

  The female disciple carefully placed the tray on the table and then stood to the side with her hands by her side.

  "I'm sure many fellow Daoists will be interested in the first item. These are three bottles of Chi - amassing pills!"Hao Qingsong said with a smile.

  After he finished speaking, he nodded slightly to the female disciple. The female disciple of the falling leaves sect hurriedly lifted the red silk, placing the three bottles of gathering Qi pills in a row on the table. She then slightly bowed to Hao Qingsong, before taking the tray and the red silk down the stage.

  As soon as Hao Qingsong's voice fell, many of the cultivators in the private rooms couldn't help but slightly open their eyes. More and more people began to use their spiritual power to check the condition of the three porcelain bottles.

  As a Jindan cultivator, Hao Qingsong was standing right next to the table where the three bottles of gathering Qi pills were placed. Naturally, he could feel the spiritual energy, but he didn't care about it. This was allowed in and of itself. As long as the item wasn't damaged, the bidder could feel it however they wanted.

  "The Qi gathering pill is a rare medicine that can assist in cultivation!" Hao Qingsong said with a smile. This was especially true for low - Level disciples, who could use Chi - amassing pills to increase their cultivation efficiency by a large margin! Which sect did not have a few disciples with outstanding talent? It's just that the environment is getting worse and worse, and even a genius disciple is struggling on the path of cultivation. If they have the assistance of a Qi gathering pill, it will be a big difference!"

  Although Hao Qingsong was a guest auctioneer, he was still a Jindan cultivator, after all. His eyes were very sharp, and he was very clear about the selling points of these auction items. Therefore, with a few simple words, he immediately roused everyone's interest.

  Of course, the people attending this auction were all high - Level members of the major sects. Everyone's vision was not bad, and everyone knew the benefits of the Qi gathering pill. But after all, this was only effective for low - Level disciples. When it came to the jiedan stage, it was basically useless. To put it bluntly, this was mainly to increase the strength of the sect, and had no use for them, so although everyone was more excited, they were not so excited that they would take it at all costs.

  However, Hao Qingsong's following words made everyone somewhat unable to remain calm.

  Hao Qingsong chuckled and said,"I'd like to say a few more things here. Fellow Daoists, you may not be aware, but this batch of Qi gathering pills is of extremely high quality, and their effects are far better than ordinary Qi gathering pills." The fellow Daoist who entrusted the pill to be auctioned said that he could invite a fellow Daoist who was publicly acknowledged to be of virtue and prestige to come up the stage and test the pill. This fellow Daoist also guarantees that at least eighty percent of the Qi - gathering pills in each bottle will have the amount of spiritual energy of forty spirit stones, and at least one pill will have the amount of spiritual energy of fifty spirit stones. If he's lying, this fellow Daoist is willing to compensate you with ten times the transaction price!"

  As soon as Hao Qingsong said this, the cultivators in the private rooms couldn't sit still.

  Liu Mansha's last disciple, Yu Xin 'er, who was in Room 6, gasped and said,""Master, there's actually such a high - Quality Qi gathering pill in this world? It's hard to believe ..."

  "This is also the first time I've heard of this, but since the other party dared to make such a guarantee, he must be very confident!" Liu Mansha said with a slight frown.

  The elder of the flying flower Valley, Yang Liu, said with a smile,""Senior Sister, there's always someone better than you. There are many things in the world of cultivation that can't be judged with common sense. Before the deterioration of the cultivation environment, there were so many amazing geniuses in China's cultivation world. Which one of these people's deeds wasn't jaw - dropping?"

  Liu Mansha smiled and said,"that's true!" Let's see! If this Qi gathering pill is really of such high quality, I can consider buying it. Xin 'er is preparing to break through to refined Qi level 8, and this Qi gathering pill will come in handy!"

  Yu Xin 'er was overjoyed. She quickly stood up and bowed."Thank you, master!"

  Among the three of them, only Yu Xin 'er was a Qi condensation cultivator, so the Qi gathering pill was naturally only useful to her. When Hao Qingsong had finished his introduction, Yu Xin' er was already very tempted, but she was too embarrassed to say it. Now that Liu Mansha had taken the initiative to say that she was considering participating in the auction, she was naturally overjoyed.

  Yu xiner had been in the sect for the shortest amount of time, but her cultivation talent was the highest among Liu Mansha's many disciples. She was only in her 20s this year and had only cultivated for about ten years, yet she had already reached the seventh level of the aura refining realm. Her cultivation was second only to Liu Mansha's first and second disciples. It could be said that her future was boundless.

  If he were to buy this gathering Qi pill, he would definitely give it to her first.

  The situation in the other private rooms was similar to that of the number 6 private room in the soaring Flower Valley. After hearing Hao Qingsong's words, many sect leaders and elders were tempted.

  However, everyone was waiting to see what would happen.

  "May I know which fellow Daoist is willing to come and check?" asked Hao Qingsong at this time.

  After a short while, a voice came from Room 3,""This old man is Medicine King's Valley's sun Tianfeng. If fellow Daoists have no objections, this old man is willing to be a witness!"

  Since the valley of the medicine Masters was assigned to the third private room, they were naturally among the top sects. Sun Tianfeng was an elder of the valley of the medicine Masters, with a cultivation of the middle jiedan stage.

  As the name implied, Medicine King's Valley was a sect whose main business was spirit medicine.

  It was said that before the deterioration of the cultivation world's environment, Medicine King's Valley was not famous and its strength was not too outstanding. However, with the deterioration of the cultivation environment, the cultivation speed of cultivators became slower and slower. On the other hand, the medicine King's Valley's gradual rise to prominence had affected the spirit grasses and spirit medicines they planted. After all, the sect's accumulation for hundreds of years was very rich. The medicine King's Valley disciples relied on the assistance of spirit medicines to cultivate faster than ordinary cultivators.

  Now, Medicine King's Valley was already firmly in the top three in the sect's strength.

  Sun Tianfeng, as a mid jiedan stage elder of the valley of the medicine Masters, specialized in his own field, naturally no one had any objections to him being a witness.

  Hao Qingsong waited for a moment before saying with a smile,"Since no one has any objections, elder sun, please move to the front stage and personally verify the Qi gathering pill!"

  Sun Tianfeng obviously didn't intend to hide it, otherwise he wouldn't have directly spoken in the room just now. The bidding device in the room also had a dialogue function. By pressing the button to speak to the bidding device, the voice could be transmitted to the whole venue. If necessary, he could even use a voice - changing software, so that no one would know who was speaking and which room was it in.

  To check the medicine, one needed to show their body, and there was no need to keep the room they were in a secret, so sun Tianfeng walked out of the room directly and went down the stairs from the side of the room, quickly arriving on the stage. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

  Hao Qingsong stretched out his hand and made an inviting gesture. With a smile, he said,"Elder sun, you can pick any bottle and take a Qi gathering pill at random for inspection. The fellow Daoist who entrusted the auction said that the consumption of this Qi - gathering pill would be on him. Each bottle contained twenty li of Qi - gathering pills, so the bottle that was selected would have a 5% discount on the base price of the final transaction! I won't let the fellow Daoist who is bidding suffer a loss!"
