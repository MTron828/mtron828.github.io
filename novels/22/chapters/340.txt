When Xia Cheng, Lu You, and the others heard this, their expressions could not help but change. The Yang family’s suhe was a very famous orchid species. It was different from the sky – High price orchid species that merchants hyped up. The Yang family’s suhe, Song Mei, Ji Yuan, he shenmei, and Lu Yun were all old and famous orchids. They had gone through the test of time and had not declined. Although in recent years, the market price of this kind of well – known orchid was not as high as the new orchid products hyped up by the merchants, those who knew the industry knew that the orchid species on the market that easily cost millions were actually just a castle in the air, and they might collapse one day. However, these well – known orchids were different. They had been tested for decades, centuries, and even centuries. Each species was very pleasing to the eye. And the best of this kind of variety, the price was not much lower than the variety that the merchants hyped up. The fact that the University of Agriculture and Forestry would give up the pot of Hui orchid and choose the Yang Lotus they had just found meant that the pot of orchids must be outstanding in terms of appearance and petal shape. In that case, their jade lion might really lose. Chen Song saw that the students of the Sanshan University’s gardening club, who were still in high spirits a moment ago, were now silent one by one. He could not help but reveal a proud look. He said,”this time, our Agriculture and Forestry University is determined to win the Gold Award!” If you can only take out this jade lion, I think you don’t have to consider the Gold Award. It’s not a bad idea to fight for the Silver Award. After all, there are three spots for the Silver Award! If we’re lucky, we might have a chance ...” Xia Cheng’s expression turned increasingly unsightly, and so did the other members of the gardening club. Each and every one of them sighed inwardly. Lu You and Jiang Yue were also biting their lower lips lightly, and their eyes were filled with unwillingness. Peng Hui and you Jun’s mentality was even more complicated. In a sense, although their motivation to join the club was not to love gardening, they were still members of the gardening club and Sanshan University. If they lost to Agriculture and Forestry University, they would naturally feel uncomfortable. Speaking of which, Xia ruofei had been in the limelight because of the Jade lion. However, if the Jade lion could not get the desired ranking in the flower exhibition, everything would be equivalent to nothing. Therefore, from this point of view, Peng Hui and you Jun even felt a bit happy because of Chen song’s words. Xia ruofei looked at Chen song’s smug expression and could not help but smile. He asked,””Lu You, Jiang Yue, if you want to win the Gold Award, I have a way!” Without waiting for Lu You and Jiang Yue to speak, Chen Song immediately laughed and said,””Xia ruofei, do you really think that you’re invincible just because you’ve accidentally cured this jade lion? Or are you going to buy it with money? Don’t say that I didn’t tell you! You can’t even buy top – grade orchids with money, let alone in such a short time. ” Xia Cheng and the rest’s expressions became more and more serious. It was obvious that Chen song’s words were not without reason. Lu You and Jiang Yue, on the other hand, trusted Xia ruofei unconditionally. Lu You replied without hesitation,”sure!” No matter what method you use, as long as you can help us win against the Agriculture and Forestry University in the flower exhibition, not only will I owe you a favor, but Yueyue will also owe you a favor ...” Jiang Yue’s face turned red and she lowered her eyes,””Youyou, why are you dragging me into this ...” However, Jiang Yue could not help but ask curiously,””Brother Xia, do you really have a way?” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. At this time, Xia Cheng asked,””Mr. Xia, we’re already very grateful to you for curing this jade lion. But I still want to know, you ... What way do you have to let us win against Yang Su He from Agriculture and Forestry University in three days? Could it be that ... We’re really going to buy a pot at a high price?” “No need for that trouble!” Xia ruofei smiled. He then looked at Lu You and Jiang Yue and said,””If you trust me, give me this jade lion. I’ll bring it back to you in three days. Then, you can just use this jade lion to participate in the exhibition.” The students of the garden art Club couldn’t help but burst into an uproar. Even Lu You and Jiang Yue couldn’t help but reveal extremely surprised expressions. “Should we still use this jade lion?” Lu You asked after some hesitation. Xia ruofei nodded his head in a relaxed manner. “Big brother Xia, will ... Will this work?” Jiang Yue asked without much confidence. Chen Song ridiculed impatiently,””I didn’t expect you to be so whimsical! Don’t tell me that you’ll be able to transform this jade lion into an even more precious breed in three days?” The students of the Garden Club were also secretly shaking their heads. If Xia ruofei had used three days to cure the Jade lion, it could be explained that he happened to know about the disease and used the right treatment. However, this jade lion had already recovered. What could Xia ruofei do with it? Could it be as Chen Song had said, that Xia ruofei could change the breed of the Jade lion? This was too far – fetched! Faced with everyone’s doubts, Xia ruofei did not explain much. He only smiled at Lu You and Jiang Yue. His meaning was clear, he wanted them to decide for themselves. Lu You bit her lower lip. After pondering for a long time, she nodded and said,””Alright! Xia ruofei, I’ll leave it to you ...” “Lu You ...” Xia Cheng frowned.”Think about it carefully ... The school is also taking this exhibition very seriously. If anything goes wrong ...”
