“Yes! Brother Xia. ” Wu Qiang said,”also ... I heard from Gu Yong that these two people look a little like scammers. They’re asking for billions of US dollars ... He said that the middle – aged man looks fine and has quite a style. There’s also an old man in a long shirt beside him who looks weird ... In short, you have to be careful.”

“I know what I’m doing,” Xia ruofei said,”I’m not a child anymore. Do you think we can just give up billions of dollars just because they say so? You can send me your business card. ”

“Yes!” Wu Qiang said.

After Xia ruofei hung up the phone, he received a picture from Wu Qiang on WeChat.

Xia ruofei took out his phone and looked at it carefully. The content of the business card was very simple. It only had a name, title, contact number, and email.

This man named Wang Boshan was the Chairman and CEO of stars Corporation.

Xia ruofei looked at the stars corporation’s LOGO on the top right corner of the business card. The LOGO looked pretty. It was a planet with a blue halo and a ring of shining stars around it. The design was not particularly creative, but it gave people a different feeling, as if the planet had life.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but take a few more looks at it. It was a great LOGO design, but he had no impression of it. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Then why did he have a faint sense of familiarity with stars Corporation? Xia ruofei could not help but frown.

Perhaps they were really just two liars, then there was no point in thinking so much.

However, there was another possibility that the other party had taken a fancy to Paradise Island.

If that was the case, it would attract a lot of attention.

When Peach Blossom Island was still called green cloud Island, very few people knew that the island belonged to the Liu family. Even fewer people knew that it had been transferred to Xia ruofei. The fact that the Liu family could find Xia ruofei with such accuracy meant that they were not simple.

More importantly, under normal circumstances, even if someone knew that Paradise Island now belonged to Xia ruofei, they would not be interested in Paradise Island and rush to the capital to negotiate with him.

After all, this was a deal worth billions of dollars. To throw so much money on an island in the South Pacific Ocean? Unless his brain was damaged.

Even Liu Qunfeng, a member of the Liu family, secretly hoped that Xia ruofei would choose Paradise Island instead of cash or shares. In other words, to him, cash and shares were obviously more important than Paradise Island.

It clearly didn’t make sense, but it still happened. There must be a problem.

There was only one possibility, and that was that the other party had discovered the true value of the Paradise Island.

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei’s expression turned serious. Only people from the cultivation world could see the value of the Paradise Island.

Could it be that someone in the cultivation world had set their eyes on the Peach Blossom Island?

Of course, all of this was based on the assumption that the other party was aiming for peach source Island. Hence, Xia ruofei remained calm even though he was not sure of anything.

He took a deep breath and quickly sorted out his thoughts. The most important thing now was to figure out the other party’s background.

He didn’t plan to call Wang Boshan back directly. He didn’t want to have direct contact with Wang Boshan before the situation was clear.

Xia ruofei looked at the name card again. The words “stars Corporation” still felt familiar.

He remembered what Liu chengfeng had told him. In order to obtain resources, the cultivation world would hire agents in the secular world. Some would even send true disciples to the secular world to take charge of Affairs.

Could it be that stars Corporation was also a company set up by a cultivation sect in the secular world? Xia ruofei’s guess was getting closer to the truth.

There was indeed such a possibility. Liu chengfeng had briefly explained the power of some cultivation sects in the secular world, but it was a brief introduction. After all, Liu chengfeng himself did not know much.

Maybe stars Corporation was mentioned? Xia ruofei said in his heart.

After some analysis, Xia ruofei finally had an idea.

He sent a message to Wu Qiang on WeChat, telling him to ask Gu Yong to keep an eye out and see if Wang Boshan would continue to come over or guard outside. If he saw Wang Boshan, he would tell him that boss Xia would not be coming to Beijing in the near future.

At the same time, considering that Wang Boshan might be a cultivator, Xia ruofei specifically instructed Wu Qiang to pay attention to the safety of the courtyard house. In addition, if the other party really barged in, he was not to put up any unnecessary resistance.

Wu Qiang found it hard to understand. However, he had always carried out Xia ruofei’s orders without any hesitation. Even if he did not understand, he would still obey.

After sending the WeChat message, the plane began to descend and was about to land.

Xia ruofei kept his phone and leaned back on the soft seat. He took a deep breath and closed his eyes.

About ten minutes later, the Taoyuan landed at Jinling’s Lukou International Airport.

After the plane landed, his cell phone had signal.

Xia ruofei was not in a hurry to get off the plane. Instead, he used his phone to send a text message to a number.

The content of the text message was very ordinary. It looked no different from any other spam message, just a recommendation of the stock code.

The message was naturally for Liu chengfeng.

The reason why he didn’t contact Liu chengfeng directly was to prevent Liu chengfeng from not being able to answer the phone or even read the message. He didn’t want the content of the message to expose Liu chengfeng.
