Chapter 3839  Saint spirit realm (1)

  In the blink of an eye, another month had passed.

  Xia ruofei's vital Qi and spiritual power were still improving steadily.

  This was especially so for his Origin Energy cultivation. His spiritual power had basically reached a bottleneck, so the increase wasn't particularly large. However, he was able to last longer and longer in the third Halo of the formation. He was very optimistic that breaking through to the Saint spirit realm was only a matter of time.

  After all, even without the help of the array, Xia ruofei could still cultivate the great Dao chant and the black origin Sutra step by step. With the help of the double array of the Yanhuang building, his spiritual power could still break through to the Saint spirit realm, but the time would be greatly extended. With a specialized spiritual power training array, it was only a matter of time before he broke through the bottleneck. Hence, Xia ruofei was not in a hurry.

  As for his vital Qi cultivation, because he had just broken through to the early stage of the nascent soul realm, he would not encounter any bottlenecks. In addition, he had an almost unlimited supply of the best cultivation resources, so his progress was naturally extremely fast. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

  Although he had not broken through to the middle Yuanying stage, his strength had a significant increase compared to when he had just broken through.

  The congealing degree of his nascent soul was probably higher than that of an ordinary cultivator in the middle stage of the nascent soul realm. However, because his nascent soul was more special, if he wanted to break through to the middle stage of the nascent soul realm, he still needed a qualitative change in four of the Dragon - shaped patterns, so he had not broken through the realm.

  On the other hand, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue had already broken through to the late - Stage of the spirit gathering realm after training in the array for about seven or eight times over the past two months. No one would believe that they had broken through two small realms in two months. However, it was the truth. After all, they had not broken through the bottleneck of a large realm, so the training of the array was particularly effective.

  However, the one who gained the most was probably Li Yifu.

  This was because he entered the formation more frequently. The first time he entered the formation, Li Yifu had only reached the early stage of the spirit gathering realm. It was also because of this that he could enter the formation once every three or four days, so his early progress was extremely fast.

  In less than a month, Li Yifu had already broken through to the middle stage of the spirit gathering realm.

  Of course, after that, every time he entered the formation, the injury to his sea of consciousness would become more serious. This way, the frequency at which he trained his spiritual power would slowly start to decrease.

  After all, even without the help of the array, Xia ruofei could still cultivate the "great Dao scroll" and "mysterious origin Scripture" step by step.
