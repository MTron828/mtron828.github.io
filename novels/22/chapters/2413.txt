Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ve been up for a long time.” Chief Liu, is there anything I can help you with?”

“Oh, it’s like this ...” Liu Qunfeng said.”Mr. Xia, I don’t know if you are free today, but we would like to ask you to come over and help my father with a follow – up examination.”

It had been a few days since Xia ruofei’s last consultation with old master Liu. During this time, Xia ruofei had been to Africa. Although elder Liu’s condition had been stable for the past few days and the tumor had basically been suppressed without getting any bigger, he was still in good spirits. However, they were still a little worried and wanted to ask Xia ruofei for a follow – up every few days. Even if it was just a checkup, it would be good.

Xia ruofei looked at elder song and Liao Jun and asked,””Chief Liu, is elder Liu’s condition acting up?”

“No, I didn ‘t!” Liu Qunfeng said,”it’s just that as his children, we’re a little worried about our father’s condition. It’s been a few days since the last consultation, right? I was just thinking that if Mr. Xia could spare some time, please come over and take a look ... If you don’t have time, then we can meet another day. ”

“It doesn’t matter. I’ll come over today!” Xia ruofei said. He thought for a while and added,”I still have something to do. I’ll come back later in the morning!”

“Alright! Alright!” “Thank you, Mr. Xia!” Liu Qunfeng said, overjoyed.

“Chief Liu, you’re too kind.” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

After hanging up, Xia ruofei smiled at elder song.””The Liu family invited me over for a follow – up. I agreed, but I told them that I would be a little late.”

Elder song couldn’t help but smile. He pointed at Xia ruofei and said,”You! Did he have to see for himself what old Liu’s expression would be like later? You’ve got some bad taste, kid ...”

Xia ruofei laughed drily and said,””What are you saying! Am I that kind of person? A doctor has the heart of a parent. The patient’s family has asked me so sincerely, how can I bear to refuse?”

Eccentric song couldn’t help but laugh.”Alright! You can go if you want, we’ll go first, you can go later!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said,”I’m going to get ready for a follow – up visit too! He had to make preparations in advance! Although I don’t know if I’ll be able to use it when the time comes ...”

Liao Jun, who was listening at the side, was confused. So this young man was also a doctor, and he even treated the chief of the Liu family? Why is the relationship here so messy!

Elder song interrupted Liao Jun’s wild thoughts and said,””Xiao Liao, let’s go!”

“Oh ... Yes! Chief!” Liao Jun quickly replied.

Manager lü accompanied elder song to the Liu family’s residence. Xia ruofei did not stay at the song family’s old residence. He drove the Land Rover that he had driven over yesterday and left the old residence with elder song’s sedan with the red flag.

However, elder song and the others went directly to the courtyard where elder Liu lived, while Xia ruofei went back to the courtyard in liuhai Lane. After waiting for about half an hour, he asked Wu Qiang to be his driver and took the Toyota Elfa to the Liu family’s courtyard.

When Xia ruofei arrived, he saw that the bulletproof red – flag car that elder song was in was still parked in the courtyard. As for the license plate number of elder song’s car, Xia ruofei, who had been in this car many times, naturally knew it very well.

“They chatted for quite a long time ...” Xia ruofei muttered in his heart.

Liu Qunfeng did not show up either. The one who welcomed Xia ruofei was a Butler of the Liu family named Liu Kuan.

He was also an elder of the Liu family and had been serving old man Liu for half his life. This time, in order to treat his illness, Grandpa Liu had moved to live in the courtyard, so Liu Kuan had come with him.

The electric car door of the Toyota Elfa opened slowly, and Xia ruofei stepped out.

Liu Kuan stepped forward, slightly bowed, and said,””Good day, Mr. Xia!”

“I’m here for elder Liu’s follow – up,”Xia ruofei nodded.

“Yes, eldest young master has already instructed.” Liu Kuan said,”but ... The young master and master are receiving an important guest. The young master asked me to ask you to wait for a while if you arrived ... I’m really sorry, Mr. Xia, this guest came at the last minute, and we didn’t know about it in advance, so we arranged ...”

Xia ruofei was well aware of this. He smiled and waved his hand. “It’s okay, I’ll go over after elder Liu is done with his work. ”

Liu Kuan was secretly relieved and quickly said,””Mr. Xia, this way please! You can have some tea and rest in the reception room first. I’ll immediately go and invite you after the old master has received the guests. ”

As Grandpa Liu’s trusted Butler, Liu Kuan knew the importance of this young man. In a sense, whether the Liu family could continue its past glory depended on this young man to a large extent.

Xia ruofei did not seem to be on good terms with the Liu family. She felt that he had a bad temper from their previous interactions. Liu Kuan was worried that Xia ruofei would leave immediately. He didn’t expect Xia ruofei to be so easy to talk to today, and his attitude was so pleasant.

“Alright, thank you for your hard work!” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

Wu Qiang stayed in the car to wait for Xia ruofei, while Xia ruofei followed Liu Kuan to the guest room.

As soon as he entered, Xia ruofei saw manager Lu and Liao Jun sitting inside.

Obviously, the segment of presenting the evidence had ended. Now, it was probably elder song and the Liu father and son who were chatting.

“Manager Lu, you’re here too?” Xia ruofei said, pretending to be surprised.

Everyone in the capital knew about Xia ruofei’s close relationship with the song family, so he could not pretend not to know manager Lu. Otherwise, it would be more obvious.

“Yeah!” Manager Lu smiled and nodded. I accompanied the chief over. ”

Then, Xia ruofei smiled and nodded at Liao Jun, who was standing beside manager Lu. They did not talk to each other. It was as if they were strangers who greeted each other with a polite smile.

After Liu Kuan served Xia ruofei a cup of tea, he bowed slightly and left.

Xia ruofei and manager Lu chatted casually. Of course, they would not mention what had happened last night. In fact, manager Lu did not know much about the whole thing.

Liao Jun, who was sitting at the side, had even less of a presence. He did not say a word and sat straight on the sofa like a statue.

After another 40 minutes, elder song walked out of elder Liu’s room.

Xia ruofei and the others heard the noise and walked out of the guest room.

Xia ruofei saw Liu Qunfeng walking elder song out. The two of them were talking as they walked.

Liu Qunfeng’s face was pale, and he looked like he had aged a few years.

Elder song saw Xia ruofei and asked,””RUO Fei, why are you here?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but Mutter in his heart,””Grandpa song is also a drama queen!”

“I’m here to do a follow – up examination for elder Liu. ” Xia ruofei replied respectfully.

“Oh! It’s time to take a good look. ” Elder song said indifferently,”help old Liu recuperate! He doesn’t look too good today!”

“Yes!” Xia ruofei promised.

“Xiao Lu, Xiao Liao, let’s go!” Elder song continued.

After saying that, elder song walked out. Manager Lu and Jun Liao quickly followed.

Xia ruofei followed Liu Qunfeng and sent elder song to the yard.

“Uncle song, take care!” Liu Qunfeng said, lowering his head.

Elder song nodded lightly, but there was still anger in his eyes. He didn’t say anything to Liu Qunfeng and got into the red flag car.

Manager Lu and Jun Liao also quickly got into the car.

Xia ruofei and Liu Qunfeng stood in the courtyard, watching elder song’s Red – flag sedan drive away.

Xia ruofei clearly heard Liu Qunfeng sigh heavily. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Chief Liu ...” Xia ruofei called out from the side.

Only then did Liu Qunfeng come back to his senses. He smiled bitterly and said,””Mr. Xia, I’m sorry! I’ve neglected you today ...”
