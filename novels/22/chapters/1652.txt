Chapter 1653: Successfully taking down_3

According to their previous plan, if Liu haofan hadn’t intervened, they would have been able to get the land with just 300 million Yuan. However, they definitely wouldn’t have paid the full amount. It would be good enough if they could pay half of it. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

After that, they would use the land mortgage loan to obtain cash for the early stages of design and construction.

Now that he wanted to buy land from Tang real estate, the 260 million had to be paid in full. They had already raised 300 million in the beginning, so they were short of funds.

Zhao Yongjun thought for a while and said,”it’s not a big problem for the time being. After the relevant procedures for this land are done, we will immediately take a mortgage loan. It will definitely not be a problem to withdraw two or three hundred million in cash. Also, the initial design costs of the clubhouse, including the construction costs, can be delayed for a while ...”

“If you have any difficulties with cash flow, you must let me know as soon as possible.” Xia ruofei said,”I still have some idle funds on my side. I can pay for it in advance. Don’t do anything illegal just because of money.”

Xia ruofei had promised elder song that he would do a clean job on the club project. It would be legal even if he didn’t earn a single cent. After all, this project involved several people from different families, including song Rui.

“Alright! If you really need money, we won’t be polite with you!” Zhao Yongjun said,”when the time comes, we’ll all increase the capital together. If Zixuan and the others can’t come up with the money for the time being, then as usual, we’ll help pay for it together. We’re all brothers!”

“With big brother Zhao watching over me, I’m at ease!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Hahaha! Ruofei, our top priority now is to solve the problem of that piece of land!” Zhao Yongjun said,”otherwise, if the rumors spread, it won’t be easy to clear your name in the future!”

“Mm! I’ll make some preparations in the next two days!” Xia ruofei said,”it’s not difficult to reverse the formation. We’re not in a hurry to wait for a day or two in case Liu haofan gets suspicious. Besides, we have to make sure that all the land transfer procedures are completed!” What if that Liu er reneges?”

“That’s for sure!” Zhao Yongjun laughed,”let’s go to the bank in the afternoon. The relevant procedures will definitely be completed in a day or two! Although there were some twists and turns in the beginning, the final result was good, and it was cheaper by tens of millions. Not bad, not bad!”

Xia ruofei thought to himself,”this is not just a matter of being cheaper by tens of millions. The key is that the natural nine revolutions heaven and earth formation is too precious. You can say that you’ve picked up a treasure!”

Xia ruofei even thought that after the clubhouse was built, he would have to spend more time in the capital city because the clubhouse would be very suitable for cultivation.

Soon, the group of people gathered at the Wang family’s private restaurant. Song Rui, who was in a good mood today, was also very generous. He ordered all the signature dishes in the private restaurant and even ordered the most expensive Drunken Eight Immortals wine for his brothers to drink to their hearts ‘content.

When Xu Zi Xuan and the rest heard that they had obtained that piece of land at such a cheap price, they were naturally overjoyed. Other than Wu Qiang who had to drive, everyone else had filled their glasses with white wine and were happily chatting while drinking. The atmosphere was very harmonious.

Everyone quickly divided their work. Zhao Yong Jun was mainly in charge of the land transfer procedures, while song Rui was looking for a design company to start the overall planning and design of the club.

As for Xia ruofei, he naturally took on the most crucial task, which was to reverse the nine turns heaven and earth formation into the Yang formation. Xu Zi Xuan and the others were Xia ruofei’s assistants, and they were responsible for preparing whatever materials he needed.

After all, most of them were natives of the capital and were familiar with all aspects of the capital. With their help, Xia ruofei would have a much easier time.

However, plans often could not keep up with changes. After Xia ruofei received a phone call at the table, he immediately changed his plans ...
