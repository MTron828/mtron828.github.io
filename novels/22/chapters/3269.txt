Although everyone had experienced the process of traveling from earth to the back of the crater in the illusion, it was a completely different feeling to experience it in person, and it was a lonely voyage that lasted more than ten days.

Even though they were all cultivators, the lonely journey in space still brought them a lot of psychological pressure.

Now that their destination was close at hand, everyone felt a sense of relief.

Of course, Xia ruofei and the others did not relax completely. On the contrary, they were even more vigilant. Up until now, everything they had experienced in the illusion had been confirmed on the moon. If the portal really appeared at the final destination, it meant that this must be a secret realm set up by the cultivators. In that case, it was very likely that there would be various unknown dangers and tests waiting for them.

Hence, the five golden core stage cultivators, including Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan, expanded the range of their spiritual senses and raised the alert Level to the highest.

As for Ling Qingxue, Yu Xin ‘er, mu Jianfei, and Xu yurou, the four Qi refining stage cultivators, they did not release their spiritual power. Their spiritual power was not strong to begin with, and it would be too exhausting to keep their spiritual power on alert all the time. Moreover, their spiritual power could only sense a small area. If there was any danger, Xia ruofei and the others would have sensed it long ago. Thus, they did not have to waste their energy.

Xia ruofei controlled the black Phoenix flying ship to lower its altitude. It flew at a low altitude of about one to two hundred meters above the moon’s surface and adjusted its flight attitude as the moon’s altitude rose and fell.

The black – armored flying ship flew at high speed along the periphery of the huge crater. When Xia ruofei discovered a small crater, he immediately steered the black – armored flying ship to approach it. At the same time, he kept increasing his flying altitude. This small crater was an obvious landmark when they were in the illusion. In the illusion, they had climbed from this crater to the top of the crater and then to the valley at the back.

Xia ruofei controlled the black Phoenix flying ship and flew over the small crater. The black Phoenix flying ship flew close to the mountain ridge and soon reached the top.

Everyone’s eyes suddenly brightened up. What appeared in front of them was a huge crater with a diameter of at least ten kilometers, and it looked unfathomably deep.

One could imagine how violent the impact of the meteorites that formed this crater was.

The black – armored flying ship soared into the sky, then quickly descended into the valley behind the ring – shaped mountain.

As the moon’s surface was in a vacuum, there was not the slightest sound of wind despite the black Phoenix flying ship’s extreme speed. Other than the faint static from the communication channel, everyone could only hear dead silence.

It was currently night on the dark side of the moon. The crater formed by the huge crater was pitch – Black, like the gaping mouth of a bloodthirsty monster. In the dead silence, it gave people an inexplicable pressure.

Xia ruofei and the others were still calm. At the same time, the Golden core cultivators expanded their spiritual power to the limit and maintained a high level of vigilance.

As for Ling Qingxue and the other four Qi condensation cultivators, they were also standing on the deck, helping to verify the coordinates. If the black Phoenix flying ship’s flight path deviated, they would be able to warn them in time.

However, under Xia ruofei’s control, the black Phoenix flying ship’s flight path was extremely precise. It was almost completely following the flight path that everyone had experienced in the illusionary realm.

Of course, this was also thanks to the magical music. As long as one experienced a musical illusion once, everything would be deeply engraved in their mind. Every detail was clear and impossible to forget.

The black Phoenix flying ship flew for about 15 minutes inside the huge crater. Everyone’s eyes looked at a spot about 50 meters ahead in unison. Xia ruofei had already made his preparations and slowed down the speed of the black Phoenix flying ship.

There was a moment of silence on the communication channel. Then, Xia ruofei’s voice came through everyone’s headphones. “We’re here!”

“It’s not easy!” “Fellow Daoists,” Chen Xuan said,”everyone, get ready to go down!”

At this point, the black Phoenix flying ship was basically hovering in the air. Xia ruofei controlled the Flying Ship to descend slowly until it was about two meters above the ground. Then, the black Phoenix flying ship finally stopped moving.

Xia ruofei looked around and said,””Let’s prepare to disembark! Everyone, please check your spacesuits again!”

The nine of them immediately checked their spacesuits in an orderly manner, and at the same time, they tested the flow of communication. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

After confirming that everything was normal, Xia ruofei said,””Now, everyone, change all the oxygen supply modules in your spacesuits to new ones. No matter how many you use, replace them now.”

He had taken into account that the situation down there was still unknown. He didn’t know what he would face if he went down. If it was too dangerous, he might not even have time to change the oxygen supply module. If he changed to a new module now, he could at least last a little longer.

Everyone did as they were told and changed the oxygen supply module.

In terms of experience, Xia ruofei was definitely not as experienced as Yang Liu and Shen tianfang, especially when Shen tianfang was an intermediate golden core cultivator. However, Xia ruofei had made a huge contribution to the expedition this time. If he had not taken out the black Phoenix flying ship, everyone would have been stuck on earth, staring at the moon. It would have been impossible for them to cross the harsh space environment and fly more than 300000 kilometers to reach this place. Besides, during the flight, Xia ruofei also showed strong leadership skills and was very careful. Therefore, everyone started to regard Xia ruofei as the center.
