Translator: 549690339

Today, the Tao Yuan building was refurbished. The outer walls and glass walls were thoroughly cleaned by a professional company. Every piece of glass was brand new and glistened in the sun.

The small square in front of the building was also beautifully decorated. The inflated arch, balloons, and banners set the atmosphere in a jubilant manner.

A red carpet extended from the entrance of the small square to the entrance of the building, and the two stone lions were also hung with red ribbons. There was a small stage built at the main entrance of the building. It was at the same level as the steps in front of the door. When Xia ruofei and the rest arrived, the slightly were playing some warm music.

Xia ruofei had already seen Feng Jing in the car. She was holding a walkie – talkie and hurriedly giving out the final instructions.

The employees on the bus also craned their necks and looked at the building that they would be working in in the future with a hint of excitement.

The east side of the building was the parking area for the ceremony, and several security veterans were responsible for maintaining order.

It was still early, and most of the guests had not arrived yet. There were only a few cars in the parking area.

The security department’s veteran skillfully directed several cars to be neatly arranged in the innermost position of the parking area.

After the car stopped, Dong Yun was the first to jump out of the car. She held a megaphone and said loudly,”Everyone, please put your belongings in the car first. Now, get out of the car and line up. Then, go to the designated seats in the square! The directors and supervisors of each department are in charge of gathering their own people. When they arrive at the square, listen to the staff on site!”

Everyone quickly got out of the car and lined up. Dong Yun gave everyone a few more requests, mainly to emphasize order in the venue, including keeping their phones on silent, not walking around casually, not whispering to each other, and so on. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

After that, Dong Yun led everyone to the small square in front of the building.

Xia ruofei followed behind the group and walked towards the small square.

When Feng Rao saw that the main force had arrived, she also walked over with a walkie – talkie.

Xia ruofei left the group and walked over to ask,””President Feng, is everything ready?”

“It’s basically all arranged,”Feng Jing said.” We just need to pay attention to the final timing, but it’s not a big problem. ” We’ll start with the guests “speech, and the last will be your speech, Chairman. The time can be long or short, but it’s mainly based on the opening time we’ve decided on.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” That’s good! Everyone has worked hard ...”

“Chairman, there’s still an hour or two before the ceremony begins!” Feng Jing said with a smile. You should go upstairs to the office and rest for a while! When it’s almost time, I’ll get Liu Qian to call you!”

“I’ll stay at the scene and take a look!”Xia ruofei said.

Feng Jing nodded and walked side by side with Xia ruofei towards the small stage in front of the building.

As she walked, she introduced the main procedure of the ceremony to Xia ruofei.””Chairman, at the beginning of the ceremony, there will be a lion dance performance. Next, there will be a five – minute short video, mainly to introduce the construction achievements of paradise Corporation. Then, it will be the speech by the guests ‘representatives, followed by your speech, and finally, the unveiling ceremony. The whole process will be controlled to be between forty minutes to an hour ...”

Xia ruofei said half – jokingly,”have you decided on the guest?” You have to give me a heads up! When those leaders go on stage, we can’t control the time anymore. Many people say that we don’t even need to look at the script for an hour!”

Xia ruofei wasn’t exaggerating. Which leader in this era wasn’t “experienced”? They had attended countless meetings and ceremonies since they entered politics. If they were not given a time limit, they could speak for half a day.

Feng Rao smiled and said,””We’ve mainly invited the leaders of the Bell Tower District, the city’s commercial Bureau, as well as some leaders of the industry, commerce, taxation, and Bank departments. Now, the Zhonglou District has clearly replied that Deputy District Chief Hong, who is in charge of commerce, will be attending. He should be the leader with the most weight this time. We’ve decided on him as the guest speaker. We’ve already discussed this with the district government office in advance. We’ve also discussed the time of his speech in advance, so there shouldn’t be any accidents!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”when Deputy Mayor Hong arrives later, you can mention it to him tactfully. Don’t make any mistakes in this part. If we miss the auspicious time, we’ll be at a great loss.”

Xia ruofei had specially invited the famous uncle Xu to set the auspicious date and time. For this, he had even given a valuable gift. Although this was a gift of reciprocity, he had paid a huge price after all. Even if he didn’t particularly care about the auspicious date, it didn’t mean that he didn’t care about it. It was naturally best to ensure that the ceremony would be unveiled at 11:23 am.

“Don’t worry! I will. ” Feng ke said.

Then, Xia ruofei looked around the venue and saw that Feng Jing had indeed arranged everything in an orderly manner. Besides, he could not help much by being there. On the contrary, because of his presence, Feng Jing had to be by her side, which would easily delay things.

So, Xia ruofei said after walking around,””Sister che, I’ll go to the office first. You have to keep in touch with the guests at all times. When the important guests are about to arrive, let me know and I’ll come downstairs to welcome them. Don’t be impolite.”

“Alright,” he said. Feng Rao said,”don’t worry! I’ve arranged for a special person to meet up with each guest, so their schedules are all under control. ”
