Chapter 1175: Da Hong Pao, the Paradise card (1)

Translator: 549690339

The next day, ye Lingyun was arranging the next month’s shift schedule in his office as the head of security.

Now that the scope of Tao Yuan farm had expanded a lot, the daily patrol workload had naturally increased a lot. In addition, there was a need to send people to guard the pharmaceutical factory 24 hours a day, so the shifts had to be arranged in advance every month to ensure that everything was equal.

It was going to be the National Day holiday soon. As usual, the company would have a seven – day holiday. Of course, some of the security personnel would be left behind.

Some of the Veterans had already gotten married and had children. They wanted to take advantage of the holiday to go home and visit their families. After all, they were earning more than before. It was only natural for them to go home to see their wives and children during the holidays and show filial piety to their parents.

There was also one person who had eaten his fill and was not hungry. Most of them volunteered to stay on duty.

According to the company’s system, everyone could enjoy different lengths of leave according to the number of years they had worked. During the Chinese New Year, these single men generally would not fight for leave. Instead, they would wait until the “off – season”.

Ye Lingyun was now a statistical staff, arranging the shifts during the National Day period.

As a director of the company’s management, he didn’t need to do such things personally. He could have gotten an assistant. However, he didn’t think it was necessary. He could do such a small task by himself. Compared to his brothers who were patrolling the front line, he was much more relaxed.

Ye Lingyun wasn’t very familiar with the use of EXCEL tables. He clumsily arranged the duty schedule for the National Day holiday, then checked it against his own book again. After confirming that there were no problems, he pressed the print button.

The printer buzzed and spat out the freshly printed duty roster.

At that moment, ye Lingyun’s phone on the table vibrated.

He saw that it was Xia ruofei’s number and quickly picked up.””Brother Xia!”

“Where are you? Go to the front of the complex and unload the things!” Xia ruofei’s voice was heard from the phone.

“Unload the car?” Ye Lingyun was stunned for a moment, then quickly replied,”Okay, okay, okay. Brother Xia, please wait a moment. I’m in the office, I’ll be right down!”

Ye Lingyun didn’t care about the shift schedule and jogged downstairs.

Xia ruofei was smoking beside the pickup truck. There were four large fiber bags in the truck.

After seeing ye Lingyun, Xia ruofei said,”Move the things away! Hurry up and deal with it, don’t let it break ...”

“What’s that, brother Xia ...” Ye Lingyun asked.

Then, his eyes lit up and he asked with a happy expression,””This ... This can’t be Cha Qing, right?”

“What do you think?” Xia ruofei rolled his eyes and said,”I’ve already prepared the things for you. It’s just a matter of how good your craftsmanship is!”

Ye linyun was overjoyed and quickly said,””Don’t worry, brother Xia! Just wait and see!”

Ye Lingyun wasn’t worried about the quality of Xia ruofei’s tea leaves at all. How could they not be quality?

He had learned the traditional tea – making skills from Mr. Li Zhifu, and he was worried that he would not be able to put them to good use!

Ye Lingyun grabbed a bag of green tea and easily carried it on his shoulder. Then, he quickly ran to the tea – making workshop not far away.

Carrying a bag that weighed more than a hundred pounds on his body, it was as light as a feather.

Xia ruofei laughed from behind him.””Don’t worry! Didn’t I ask you to call a few of your brothers over to help you?”

“I’m fine! I’ve already prepared the manpower!” Ye Lingyun said without turning his head,”I’ll get people after I move the things over!”

Xia ruofei smiled and shook his head at ye Lingyun’s energetic look. He picked up the bags one by one and walked towards the tea – making workshop.

Ye Lingyun put down the bag and came out. Seeing this, he quickly shouted,””Brother Xia, just leave it there. I’ll move it!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”there’s one more over there!” You can move it! After you’re done, call your people over to start work!”

Xia ruofei grabbed a bag of things that weighed more than a hundred pounds in each hand as if he was playing with them.

“Alright!” Ye linyun replied.

After moving all the tea leaves into the tea – making workshop, ye Lingyun immediately called the Veterans and got ready to start making tea.

Xia ruofei threw the keys to the pickup to him and asked him to park the car. Then, he walked home with light steps.

He didn’t care how ye Lingyun made the tea. This bit of Tea Green was nothing to Xia ruofei. By now, even those at the mountain sea realm had already cut out a forest of tea trees. Meanwhile, there were quite a number of tea trees in the Archean realm. Under the speed of time that was thirty times faster, they could be harvested once every ten days.

If the quality of ye Lingyun’s handmade tea leaves could reach a higher level and be more stable, Xia ruofei was prepared to increase the supply of Tea Green and launch the Taoyuan Brand Da Hong Pao tea leaves.

In the next two days, ye Lingyun and a few veterans who helped him made all the tea leaves into finished tea leaves without stopping.

The process of making tea was completely done by hand using the ancient method, without the help of any machine.

After the tea leaves were made, ye Lingyun brought them to Xia ruofei immediately. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Xia ruofei made a cup and tasted it. He immediately smiled and said,””Not bad! Ling Yun, it seems like you’ve inherited old Li’s true teachings ...”

Ye linyun scratched his head in embarrassment and said,”It’s mainly because the tea you provided is of high quality, brother Xia. Also ... This is the first time I’ve made tea on my own without a master’s supervision. I feel that the heat control is still a little lacking ...”
