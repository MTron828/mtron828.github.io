    Other than Xia ruofei, everyone in the room looked at the water spinach in President Zheng's hand.

  The most ordinary stir - fried water spinach was emitting an alluring fragrance. Moreover, it looked really good. Every leaf was pure emerald green with a little crystal luster. It looked like a piece of Jade art against the White plate.

  Even Tian Huilan couldn't help but take a few more glances, then smiled and asked,

  "President Zheng, I don't think we ordered water spinach! Could it be that this is a new dish in your restaurant and you want us to try it?"

  President Zheng quickly said,"

  "Mayor Tian, you've misunderstood. These are the ingredients brought by Mr. Xia. We were only responsible for processing them. There will be a few more dishes coming soon, and they will all be using the ingredients provided by Mr. Xia."

  "Oh? Xiao Xia, why did you bring your own food?" Tian Huilan couldn't help but find it funny as she turned to ask Xia ruofei. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

  Xia ruofei smiled and explained,"

  "Professor Tian, Mayor Tian, these are the new vegetables cultivated by a friend of mine. Not only are they pure green and pollution - Free, but they also taste much better than the vegetables sold in the market. I brought them here today for everyone to try."

  "The vegetables Mr. Xia brought are all of very high quality!" President Zheng said from the side,"the Executive Head Chef of this small restaurant is full of praise for these vegetables. He said that they are the best vegetables he has seen in his decades of work!"

  "Oh, really? Then we'll have to have a good taste!" Professor Tian was also very interested.

  President Zheng quickly put down the plate and hurried to the other dishes.

  "Come, come, come, everyone, have a taste! The water spinach looks delicious!" Professor Tian said as he picked up his chopsticks.

  After he finished speaking, he took the initiative to pick up some food with his chopsticks and put it in his mouth. Tian Huilan and Wu Liqian also picked up some out of curiosity. Only Lu You did not touch her chopsticks.

  "Mm! It tastes really good!" Professor Tian chewed and said with a look of enjoyment,"I've lived for so many years, but this is the first time I've eaten such delicious water spinach! This taste ... It's simply indescribable. It's too delicious!"

  Just now, Lu You had also been attracted by the extremely good - looking water spinach and couldn't help but take a few more glances. However, after hearing professor Tian's exaggerated comment, she couldn't help but say,"

  "Grandpa, are you serious? No matter how delicious it is, it's just water spinach. It's as good as you said ..."

  Before Lu You could finish her sentence, Tian Huilan had already praised,"

  "Little Xia, this new vegetable dish is really extraordinary! The taste is too good!"

  Wu Liqian nodded in agreement as she ate. It was obvious that this simple water spinach had won everyone's approval. Of course, Lu You, who was a little peeved, was not counted.

  Professor Tian looked at Lu You and said,"

  "Youyou, why don't you try it? Oh right, what did you just say?"

  This old man was so focused on eating that he didn't hear what Lu You had just said.

  However, Xia ruofei did hear it. He could not help but look at the little girl in amusement.

  Lu You also felt Xia ruofei's gaze and immediately glared at him secretly. Her small mouth pouted slightly, and her angry look made Xia ruofei both amused and confused. This little girl seemed to be hostile towards him ...

  "Youyou, have a taste!" Tian Huilan also said,"don't you usually like to eat vegetables? The taste of this water spinach will definitely not disappoint you!"

  Seeing that her grandfather and mother were so impressed by this water spinach, Lu You's curiosity finally prevailed. She picked up her chopsticks and picked up some, mumbling as she put it into her mouth,"

  "I don't believe it. Is it really as good as you say?"

  However, when the water spinach was in her mouth, Lu You's expression suddenly froze. Then, her expression became colorful. She chewed in big mouthfuls. Although she didn't say anything, the expression of enjoyment on her face explained everything.

  Professor Tian laughed and asked,"

  "Youyou, how's the taste?"

  Lu You's face turned slightly red and she said stubbornly,"

  "It's just like that! It's alright ..."

  However, even though she said that, she did not slow down. Before she could swallow the food in about her image. Almost half of these dishes had entered her stomach.

  Xia ruofei couldn't help but worry that her stomach would be upset if she ate like this.

her mouth, she immediately reached out with her chopsticks again, as if she was afraid that others would snatch it all away.

  Seeing this, professor Tian couldn't help but burst into laughter. Tian Huilan also had a funny and helpless expression.

  Xia ruofei and Wu Liqian wanted to laugh, but they did not dare to. They could only hold it in.

  Soon, the remaining dishes were served. There were braised eggplant, tomato scrambled egg, cold cucumber salad, and stir - fried mustard.

  They were all very ordinary dishes, but the chef of the club was very good at cooking. In addition, the ingredients that Xia ruofei had provided were definitely the best, so the dishes looked, smelled, and tasted great. Even Xia ruofei himself couldn't help but eat a lot.

  He had to admit that there were experts in every field. Using the same ingredients, the food made by the club's chef was indeed much better than the food he made at home.

  Professor Tian and the others were eating to their heart's content. Even Tian Huilan kept picking up food, clearly conquered by the deliciousness of these dishes. Lu You ate very quickly, not caring about her image. Almost half of these dishes had entered her stomach.

  Xia ruofei couldn't help but worry that her stomach would be upset if she ate like this.

  After the meal, professor Tian couldn't help but joke,"

  "Little Xia! We wanted to treat you to a meal to express our gratitude, but we didn't expect to benefit from you. Your new vegetables are really delicious!"

  Xia ruofei smiled and said,"

  "Professor Tian, if you like it, I can send some to your house from time to time."

  "This ... Wouldn't that be a bad idea?" Professor Tian was very tempted, but he still asked with a hint of hesitation.

  "It's nothing. I grew them myself anyway, so they're not worth much." Xia ruofei smiled."Besides, I have a car. It's very convenient."

  "Then I won't be polite! Thank you, Xia!" Professor Tian said with a smile. His impression of Xia ruofei had improved.

increase, and it will be meaningless to push it to the market."

  Tian Huilan smiled and nodded, saying,

  Lu You watched from the side and immediately criticized in her heart,"This guy was definitely trying to build a relationship! She was deliberately trying to get close to Grandpa by eating and giving him food ...

  Xia ruofei naturally didn't know what Lu You was thinking. Otherwise, he would have said in anger,"This girl was an ungrateful wretch who would turn her back on him after eating him! She was the one who had the most fun eating just now!

  Meanwhile, Tian Huilan looked at Xia ruofei thoughtfully and asked,"

  "Little Xia, if you put this new vegetable on the market, it should be very popular. Do you have any plans in this area?"

  Lu You immediately stared at Xia ruofei, thinking that this guy was about to reveal his fox tail! He would definitely take advantage of the situation and ask for his mother's help!

  What she did not expect was that Xia ruofei would only smile and say,"

  "We don't have any plans to promote it on a large scale for the time being. The main reason is that this new vegetable is still in the research and development stage. We still have some problems to solve, such as the problem of large - scale planting. If we can't solve this problem, the output will not increase, and it will be meaningless to push it to the market."

  Tian Huilan smiled and nodded, saying,

  "Mm! Steady and steady was the correct way of thinking! If you have any difficulties in the future or need to coordinate with the government, you can come to me. "

  "Alright! Then I'll thank Mayor Tian first!" Xia ruofei replied with a smile.

  However, even Lu You could tell that Xia ruofei was answering out of courtesy and did not really want to ask Tian Huilan for help.

  Lu You couldn't help but reveal a puzzled expression. This seemed to be a little different from the script she had imagined ...

  Tian Huilan then asked about Lin Qiao's school situation. Xia ruofei told her that the school was very good and that Wu Liqian had helped to find a house nearby. Xia ruofei expressed his gratitude to her.

  After everyone chatted for a while, the family dinner came to an end.

  The clubhouse had an agreement with the three workshops and seven lanes to open a special passage for some important guests 'cars to pick them up directly at the clubhouse entrance. When everyone came out, Tian Huilan's driver had already parked her Audi at the entrance and was waiting.

  Standing at the entrance of the club, Tian Huilan asked with a smile,"

  "Xia, shall I get the driver to send you?"

  "It's fine, Mayor Tian, I drove here myself," Xia ruofei said,"I'll just find a designated driver at the club later."

  That night, everyone had a few drinks, so Xia ruofei could not drive.

  "That's good. If you have time, come home and be a guest!" Tian Huilan extended an invitation to Xia ruofei, then turned to Wu Liqian and said,"Xiao Wu, you stay behind and help make the arrangements."

  "Alright, Mayor Tian!" Wu Liqian said.

  "No need, no need," Xia ruofei quickly said,"it's getting late. I'm worried about sis Wu going home alone! The club has a designated driving service, I'll just look for one. "

  Xia ruofei still had something to do later! Naturally, he didn't want Wu Liqian to stay.

  Tian Huilan muttered to herself before nodding,

  "Alright, we'll be leaving then!"

  Professor Tian also smiled at Xia ruofei and said,"

  "Little Xia, remember to come up! I'm still thinking about your new vegetable dish! Hahaha ..."

  "I remember! Professor Tian, don't worry!" Xia ruofei laughed.

  Lu You didn't say anything at the side. In fact, she had been rather quiet the entire night. However, Xia ruofei wasn't familiar with her. He only smiled and nodded at her. Lu You didn't respond to Xia ruofei and got into the car directly.

  "This child ..." Tian Huilan glared at Lu You reproachfully, then said to Xia ruofei,"little Xia, please don't mind her! We've spoiled Youyou, so she's a little arrogant ..."

  "I'm fine ..." Xia ruofei smiled."Mayor Tian, take care!"

  "Alright, goodbye!"

  Professor Tian's family and Wu Liqian got into the car. Xia ruofei waved goodbye to them and watched the car leave the clubhouse. Then, he turned around and walked back.

  "President Zheng, come out! "Mayor Tian and the others have left ..." Xia ruofei said with a smile. He had long noticed President Zheng hiding in the shadows of the lights!

  This was within Xia ruofei's expectations.

  Sure enough, the chubby President Zheng walked out with a smile on his face and said,"

  "Mr. Xia, thank God you didn't leave! Otherwise, I really don't know where to go to find you. "

  Xia ruofei smiled and asked,"

  "President Zheng, is there anything I can help you with?"

  With a warm smile on his face, President Zheng said,"

  "I do have something to discuss with Mr. Xia. I wonder if it's convenient for you?"

  "Let's talk inside!" Xia ruofei said indifferently and walked into the club. President Zheng quickly followed him.

  Xia ruofei had a confident smile on his face because everything was going according to plan.
