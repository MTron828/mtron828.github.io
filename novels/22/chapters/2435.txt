“A challenge can be initiated every seven days. After it’s opened, you have three chances to challenge.” Xia Qing didn’t keep him in suspense any longer and said with a smile,”master, I believe you have already seen the wonderful use of the Jade pillar array ...”

Before Xia Qing could finish her sentence, she saw a figure flash in front of her. Xia ruofei had already stepped onto the Jade Bridge and entered the Linglong Pagoda in the blink of an eye.

Xia Qing couldn’t help but reveal a bitter smile.

After almost 40 minutes, Xia ruofei walked out of the Linglong tower, drenched in sweat. He had a carefree smile on his face.

After seeing Xia Qing, Xia ruofei grinned and said,””Cool!”

He used up the remaining two challenge chances in one go.

In his second challenge, he persevered for almost 15 minutes, which was five meters more than his first challenge. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

In the third challenge, Xia ruofei was lucky enough to persist for 25 minutes and advanced to more than 20 meters.

After 20 meters, the Halo’s density increased significantly. Its speed was sometimes fast and sometimes slow, making it even more unpredictable. Xia ruofei could not hold on any longer and was directly blasted out of the Jade pillar array.

Obviously, twenty meters should be a threshold. After twenty meters, the difficulty of the Jade pillar array would increase by another level.

At the same time, the Jade pillar array continued to extend forward in the White fog. It was impossible to tell how long it had stretched.

However, Xia ruofei still felt rather carefree.

After challenging the Jade pillar formation three times today, he could clearly feel the improvement in his movement technique. After his reaction speed was pushed to the limit, he felt as if he had suddenly become enlightened.

Xia ruofei was not in a hurry to enter the mountain sea realm. He wiped his sweat and said to Xia Qing,””Tell me more about this Jade pillar array!”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing bowed slightly and said,”the Jade pillar array is actually used to train one’s body technique. If I may be so presumptuous as to ask, what is master’s best result in the three rounds?”

“Around 20 meters,” Xia ruofei replied casually.

Xia Qing had followed Xia ruofei for a long time and was familiar with the modern measurement units. He quickly converted twenty meters to ten feet. He said happily,””Master, you’re able to rush to a distance of seventy to eighty feet on your first attempt. Moreover, you haven’t cultivated any movement techniques. It seems that you’re really talented!”

Xia ruofei shook his head and said,”I feel like I’m still far from it!” By the way, Xia Qing, how long is this Jade pillar array in total? I can’t even see the end of the formation ...”

“Master, the Jade pillar formation is 600 feet long,” Xia Qing replied with a smile.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but take a deep breath and said,””Two hundred meters? In other words, I’ve only cleared one – tenth of it even after using all my strength?”

Xia ruofei was speechless.

One had to know that although he had used three chances to clear one – tenth of the test, the difficulty did not increase in a linear manner. There was an obvious change at the 20 – meter mark. In other words, he had only passed the lowest part of the 180 meters. The difficulty might jump nine more times in the next 180 meters. At the 20 meters, Xia ruofei already felt that he could not handle it. What would happen at the 200 meters?

He didn’t dare to imagine the difficulty of the last Jade pillar array.

Xia Qing said,”master, the Jade pillar array was originally used to train the body technique. Master has not yet cultivated any body technique. You are completely relying on your own reaction. To be able to cross 70 to 80 feet is already a feat of heaven!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand disinterestedly and said,”It seems that I still have to cultivate my movement technique!”

Although there were many cultivation manuals in the human jade talisman, most of them were about cultivating genuine Qi. There were also some methods on mental power. As for body techniques, combat techniques, and so on, there were almost none.

As for the earth character jade talisman, there were only ancient books on array Dao.

Hence, Xia ruofei had not cultivated any movement techniques.

He could guess that the reason why the previous owner of the spirit map space did not leave behind any martial arts or other battle techniques was that he had prepared something better. The reason he did not release it was probably to let Xia ruofei, who came later, focus more on the cultivation of the great Dao Sutra.

Xia Qing nodded and said,”it’ll be much easier for master to break through the Jade pillar array after he’s cultivated his body technique.” That’s right ... If master can pass the test of the Jade pillar formation, you will be able to obtain the reward left behind by Shanhai Zhenren. ”

“Oh?” Xia ruofei’s eyes lit up when he heard that there were benefits. He asked,””What’s the reward?”

“The prize is at the end of the Jade pillar array. You will know after you pass it.” Xia Qing said with a smile.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but complain,”you’re keeping me in suspense again!”

“Master, please forgive me!” Xia Qing said with a slight bow. His attitude was very respectful, but he couldn’t say that he was tight – lipped.

Xia ruofei had long been familiar with Xia Qing’s situation. He knew that no matter how much Xia Qing looked like a human, she was still a soul puppet. Just like the intelligent Robots that many research institutions were researching, no matter how much she looked like a human, she was still a robot in essence and must operate according to a certain process.

Hence, Xia ruofei did not mind. He waved his hand and did not continue to ask about the exquisite Pagoda and the Jade pillar array.

Anyway, the Linglong tower was here and it wouldn’t grow wings and fly away. He had plenty of time to slowly understand it.
