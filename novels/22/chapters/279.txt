Chapter 280: Chapter 276 – old acquaintance (1)

“That’s what I’m thinking,”eccentric song nodded. “Grandpa, leave this to me!” Song Rui immediately said,”a few of my buddies are here!” “What’s the difference between you and me?”eccentric song asked indifferently. In a few days, the outside world will know that it’s our song family’s business. ” “Uh ...” Song Rui laughed awkwardly. Xia ruofei smiled and said,”chief, let me do it!” In addition, every year around the Qingming Festival, as long as there’s nothing particularly urgent, I can come over and burn some paper money for the martyrs on your behalf. ” “Alright, thank you for the trouble, Xia.” Elder song nodded, pleased. “You’re welcome, chief,”Xia ruofei said. It’s my honor to be able to do something for a martyr. Besides, it’s as easy as lifting a finger!” Xia ruofei continued,”then it’s settled. Chief, after this trip, I will find time to come back to Mount Wu Yi. Don’t worry. I will handle this matter properly!” “Good! Thank you, Xia!” Elder song said kindly. The group of people waited for the candles to finish burning before they began to pack up and prepare to return. “Chief, are we going back to the hotel directly or do we have other arrangements?” Manager Lu asked. “There’s someone else I want to see ... But we haven’t been in contact for thirty years. I don’t know if he’s still alive ...” The group packed up their things and began to return the way they came. Although elder song was old, he had consumed a lot of the petal solution recently. On top of that, Xia ruofei had given him a “mineral water” just as he was about to return. Hence, he was still in good shape. He walked on the mountain path as if he was flying. Soon, everyone returned to the parking lot, and the three cars drove out along the small road. At the entrance of xiakeng village, elder song stopped the car. “Chief, the person you’re looking for is in this village?” Xia ruofei asked. “He lived here 30 years ago. I’m not sure now. Let’s go in and take a look!” Elder song said. “I don’t think so many people need to go to the village,” elder song said after they got out of the car. “Xia, come with me!” “Old commander, this ...” The head of security, Huang Fang, said with some difficulty. “So many of us entered the village together. People who don’t know would think that something happened!” Elder song said,”little Xia can accompany me alone.” “Supervisor Huang, since the chief has spoken, let’s carry it out!” Xia ruofei said,”don’t worry! I’ll guarantee the chief’s safety. ” Naturally, Huang Fang did not trust Xia ruofei. He could not help but turn to Xu Wu for help. Unexpectedly, Xu Wu only muttered to himself for a moment before saying,””Okay, chief, we’ll be waiting for you here!” “Staff officer Xu ...” Huang Fang was shocked. “Manager Huang, it’ll be fine with RUO Fei around.” Xu Wu said with a smile. “Then it’s decided!” Elder song chuckled and said,”little Xia, let’s go!” “Alright!” Xia ruofei accompanied elder song as they walked into the village. Xu Wu, Huang Fang, and the rest of the group stayed behind to wait. Looking at the disappearing figures of elder song and Xia ruofei, Huang Fang said worriedly,””Staff officer Xu, your decision is too rash! The old commander only brought one attendant with him. If anything were to happen, the responsibility would be huge!” “Don’t worry, manager Huang,”said Xu Wu easily. RUO Fei’s professional ability is much better than mine, and his skills are even more abnormal. Even when I was planning to ambush him, I was still knocked down by him in one move!” Hiss ... Huang Fang took a deep breath and looked at Xia ruofei’s back in surprise.””Staff officer Xu, could it be that this little brother is from some special force that specializes in protecting the old commander?” “He used to be an excellent Special Forces elite, but he’s retired,” said Xu Wu with a smile. This time, it’s completely out of friendship!” When Huang Fang heard this, he felt even more incredulous. He repeatedly exclaimed that he had misjudged Xia ruofei. From the first time they met at the pick – up station, he had always thought that Xia ruofei was just an ordinary security guard, perhaps a soldier like Xu Wu. Xia ruofei’s resume was highly confidential, so Xu Wu naturally did not talk much and quickly changed the topic. On the other side, elder song and Xia ruofei had entered the village. The small mountain village was in a remote location. All he could see were low and dilapidated houses, which was very different from the high – rise buildings and heavy traffic outside. It was as if time had stopped here. However, when elder song saw the scene in front of him, he quickly recalled the village in his memory. In fact, many of the old houses were still there. There were very few people in the village. Some elderly people were sitting on the stone bench at the village entrance, basking in the sun. A few children were playing under the trees at the village entrance. This was also the general situation of the rural areas in China. The entire country’s rural areas were withering. Xiakeng village was no exception. Most of the young adults in the village had gone out to work, leaving only the elderly and children behind. Of course, many of the villagers in xiakeng village did not go to other places. Many of them worked in the tea gardens, tea shops, and scenic spots in the city. It was rare to see a stranger in such a dusky village. Hence, when Xia ruofei and elder song walked into the village, many curious eyes immediately fell on them. A few children even walked over timidly and sized them up. Elder song nodded at the children with a kind smile on his face. However, the two of them did not stop and walked straight into the village. The layout of the entire village should not have changed much in the past few decades. Elder song quickly found a dilapidated house based on his memory. When he saw the old house, elder song’s face froze. Because this house had been in disrepair for a long time, and no one had lived in it for a long time. Through the half – broken wooden door, he could see that the weeds in the courtyard were already half the height of a person, and a part of the courtyard wall had collapsed. “Chief, the person you’re looking for lives here?” Xia ruofei asked carefully. “He lived here thirty years ago,” eccentric song said, frowning.”It seems that he has moved away, or ... He is no longer alive!” “Let’s ask around nearby!” Xia ruofei said. “En!” Elder song nodded. The two of them walked back along the path they came from and happened to see a villager carrying a hoe passing by. “Chief, what’s the name of the person you’re looking for?” Xia ruofei asked. “He’s Li Zhifu!” Elder song said. “Alright!” Xia ruofei nodded and walked towards the villager.””Uncle, I want to ask you something. Do you know where li Zhifu from your village is now?” “Li Zhifu?” The villagers were at a loss. Xia ruofei pointed at the dilapidated house not far away and said,”He should have lived in that house before.” Realization dawned on cunming as he said,”Oh! You’re talking about uncle Fu!”DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎
