Chapter 977: Principal Tian is angry (3)

Translator: 549690339

If he offended the son of the Vice Director of the health Bureau and the head of the health Inspection Bureau on the first day of business, it would be difficult for him to do business in the future.

Therefore, manager Lu was very anxious. He could only smile carefully and explain.

However, Tian Mingyi didn’t listen at all. He frowned slightly and said,””Wait! You kept saying ‘your President Ling’ just now. So ... Those two people just now are from your company?”

“President Ling is the Vice President of our company, and also the daughter of our Chairman,” manager Lu said carefully.

Pa!

Tian Ming Yi heavily smacked the surface of the bar counter, scaring the staff who was in charge of payment.

“Manager Lu, is this how you do your business?” Tian Mingyi said angrily. Ah? Guests don’t have private rooms, but your own people are enjoying some reserved private rooms! This is simply preposterous!” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Manager Lu, there’s obviously something wrong with your service ...” Inspector Wu chimed in.

Manager Lu quickly said,”my two superiors, it’s not that I’m looking down on you. I don’t dare to do it. But, that private room was booked by President Ling this morning. Also ...”

“And, my ass!” Tian Mingyi slapped the table again,”if the private rooms were all reserved by the guests, I wouldn’t have anything to say. But now, it’s actually occupied by your internal staff ... Hmph! I don’t care! Give us that flying Snow Pavilion or whatever right now! Otherwise ... You can just shut down your little shop!”

Today, Tian Mingyi was going to invite Liu Lisheng, the Deputy Director of the city’s education Bureau, to a banquet. Because their Central Primary school’s principal was about to retire, Tian Mingyi was already prepared to become a full – time employee. He didn’t expect that two days ago, he heard that the district Education Bureau seemed to have the intention of parachuting a principal from the organization.

Tian Mingyi suddenly became anxious. This Deputy bureau chief Liu Lisheng and his father, Tian Feilong, happened to be classmates when they were studying at the municipal party party party party school. Their relationship with Tian Feilong was not bad.

Thus, Tian Mingyi gave Liu Lisheng a call and invited him to have a meal together tonight, and the location was set at Ling Ji’s private kitchen, which had just opened for business at noon today.

After all, private dining was popular these days. Moreover, such places were generally quiet and the quality of the food was relatively high. It was convenient to talk if he invited Deputy bureau chief Liu here.

As for director Wu, he was a guest invited by Tian Mingyi. Director Wu had a good tolerance for alcohol and was very tactful. Most importantly, two months ago, director Wu had helped Deputy bureau chief Liu’s brother – in – Law with his health permit application. Therefore, with him around to help, Tian Mingyi felt more confident.

What he didn’t expect was that there weren’t many private rooms in this kind of private restaurant. He didn’t make a reservation in advance, so when he arrived, he found that all the private rooms had been reserved. He was just telling manager Lu to help him adjust a private room when he saw Ling Qingxue and Xia ruofei come in from outside and go straight to the flying Snow Pavilion private room.

When Tian Mingyi found out that Ling Qingxue wasn’t a guest, but an internal member, he was even more enraged.

“Principal Tian, this ... I really can’t make the decision!” Manager Lu said with a bitter face.

“Then find someone who can make the decision!” Tian Mingyi’s face darkened as he said,”I don’t believe it! I, Tian Mingyi, am here for a meal, but I can’t even book a private room ...”
