“It’s so beautiful!” Feng Rao couldn’t help but exclaim.

There was a drop – shaped diamond brooch in the box. The workmanship was very exquisite, and it was obvious that it was expensive.

Feng Rao took out the brooch and looked at it over and over again. The more she looked at it, the more she liked it. She asked happily,”RUO Fei, this brooch is very expensive, right?”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”It’s not that expensive. I saw it when I was shopping in Turin. I thought it would suit you. As the CEO of the company, you have to attend formal social events. This brooch would come in handy, so I bought it. Sister che, do you like it?”

In fact, this brooch was not just bought from a roadside stall. It was a limited edition brooch from the famous Italy luxury brand, Filch, which was the only exclusive store in Turin. The small brooch cost 100000 euros.

Xia ruofei had asked Lu zhengfeng to bring him there when they were shopping in Duling city. When Lu zhengfeng heard that Xia ruofei was buying gifts for girls, the first brand he recommended was Feixi.

“Of course I like it!” Feng Rao carefully placed the brooch back into the box and closed the lid.”Thank you, ruofei!” She said.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”Hi!” It’s just a small gift, why are you being so polite?”

Then, Xia ruofei looked at the thick file that Feng Jing had brought and said,””Let’s talk business! Looking at the situation, they might not be able to finish the discussion this morning! Let me make this clear! I still have something to do later, so I have to leave early!”

“I know!” Feng Rao pursed her lips and smiled. I’ll try to keep it short! Also ... You’ve been gone for almost a month, and it’s not easy for you to show your face. Don’t you want to meet the other executives of the company?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”I’ve already asked Yao Xin to prepare a meeting room!” However, if you’re taking too long, we’ll have to wait until the afternoon!”

Speaking of this, Xia ruofei continued,”by the way, why did you let Yao Xin come to my side?” I’m not at home these days, so there’s no need to arrange for a specialist, right?”

“You wish!” Feng Jing smiled and said,”Yao Xin is preparing to take over Liu Qian’s position as my assistant. She’s been learning from Liu Qian during this period of time, so ... I heard that you’re coming back today, so I lent her to you. You’re the Chairman of the Board, you can’t possibly not have someone to serve you tea, right?”

“Okay ...” Xia ruofei said.”Oh right, where are you going to arrange for Liu Qian?” Are there any suitable spots?”

“I was just about to report to you!” Feng Rao laughed. Since you’ve asked, then let’s report this first!”

Feng Jing paused and continued,”I have two suggestions for Liu Qian’s arrangements. One is for the company’s administrative department, and the other is for the sales department. Both departments have vacancies for Deputy Managers, and I think she should be able to take up the position.” RUO Fei, which one do you think is more suitable?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Liu Qian is your assistant. She’s only the assistant manager. You can decide on your own!”

After the relocation of the company’s headquarters, the division of departments was more detailed. Whether it was the administration department or the sales department, they were divided into many second – Level departments according to their different functions and tasks. With Liu Qian’s qualifications, it was more than enough to be appointed as a Deputy Manager.

As the company’s chairman, Xia ruofei was not too concerned about such an appointment. Moreover, he had always trusted Feng Jing. As Feng Jing’s assistant, Xia ruofei would definitely respect Feng Jing’s decision no matter what it was.

“If we go to the administrative department, Liu Qian will definitely be able to get into character quickly. After all, she’s been working in this field for a long time and has a broad vision. It might be a little difficult to start off with the sales department since she’s not familiar with the work. But in the long run, it might be more beneficial for her all – Round development ...”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.””Sister che, you’re really concerned about Liu Qian’s matter! That girl is really lucky to have such a good leader like you. ”

In fact, Liu Qian was about the same age as Xia ruofei, but Xia ruofei’s tone did not sound out of place at all.

“I’m training talents for the company, okay?”Feng Jing replied. You’re still laughing!”

Xia ruofei held back his laughter and said,”Okay, okay, okay!” In that case, he might as well let her go to the sales department! It’s all – Round development!”

“You also think that the sales department is better?” Feng Rao said,”alright! Since you’ve also agreed, I’ll arrange for her to work in the sales department!”

Xia ruofei nodded.”You can decide on these things. You don’t have to report everything to me. I can’t manage everything ...”

“I know! He’s just a hands – off shopkeeper!” Feng Jing looked at Xia ruofei coyly and said,”later, the other higher – ups will report on their respective work. I won’t go into detail. I’ll pick the important ones to tell you!”

“This is the best!” Xia ruofei said and adjusted his sitting position to be more comfortable.

Feng Jing opened the folder and said,””Ruofei, you’ll have a few major tasks to do when you’re not in the company. The first is the drug production branch and farm expansion project in Changping County. You should have seen it when you went back yesterday. Now, the construction team has entered the field, and all the construction is in full swing!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I saw it. You guys are very fast and efficient. You deserve praise!”
