Hearing this, Xia ruofei’s expression became very strange.

It wasn’t strange that song Zhilan was looking for a partner for song Rui. In fact, in the past one or two years, the song family had been looking for marriage alliances for song Rui. However, the person song Zhilan looked for this time wasn’t a descendant of a big family in the country. Instead, she looked for a Chinese man from overseas.

What made Xia ruofei not know whether to laugh or cry was that this lady called Li Hongyan had a close relationship with Li Yifu.

Xia ruofei did some calculations in his heart. Li Hongyan’s father, li chenghui, was Li Yifu’s nephew. That meant that Li Hongyan was Li Yifu’s grandniece.

In other words, if song Rui and Li Hongyan were really married, then he should address Li Yifu as grandfather.

According to the seniority of immortal mountain river, Li Yifu was Xia ruofei’s grandnephew. In other words, Xia ruofei was song Rui’s grandfather’s grandfather. Even elder song was Xia ruofei’s grandson … Okay! Elder song had his own opinions, but as for song Rui…

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but look at song Rui. Father, ancestor, great, great… By then, I’ll be this kid’s great ancestor? He’s my great – great – grandson? This arrangement seemed pretty good …

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but find it funny.

Elder song naturally didn’t know that Xia ruofei had such complicated thoughts. He was rather interested in the marriage partner that song Zhilan had found for song Rui. He couldn’t help but ask,”Zhilan, you’ve contacted the Li clan? Does the other party have the same intention?”

Song Zhilan slightly nodded and said,”dad!” Mr. Li Yifu is now living in seclusion and has very little contact with the outside world, so I couldn’t speak to him directly…”

Xia ruofei thought to himself,’my adopted husband is now on Peach Blossom Island. How long has it been since he returned to the United States? It would be a wonder if you could contact him!”

Song Zhilan continued,”however, li chenghui is still very interested in our proposal. If both parties have no objections, he can arrange for Li Hongyan to work in the branch company of the nine states group in Beijing. Our group still has a lot of business dealings with the nine states group. This way, Xiao Rui can also have more contact with Li Hongyan. After all, it’s a new era. Even if it’s a marriage alliance, it’s definitely necessary to let the young people get along first…”

“You’re right …”Eccentric song nodded.

Then, eccentric song pondered for a moment and said, “”The Li family is still very influential in the United States, and in recent years, they have been increasing their investment in China. These patriotic Chinese have a lot of influence in China. If you marry them, it’s not a bad choice …”

The more song Rui listened, the more anxious he became. The situation was not good this time!

In the past, elder song did not approve or oppose song Rui’s marriage. He had seen song Rui’s various means of escape, but he did not say much.

But today, it seemed that even elder song agreed. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

If elder song decided, song Rui would not even have the courage to resist.

He was so anxious that he could not help but look at Xia ruofei for help.

When song Rui looked at Xia ruofei, he saw a strange smile on Xia ruofei’s face. He seemed to be listening with great interest.

What did this brother mean? Don’t tell me he’s backing out? Then wouldn’t 1 be in deep trouble? Song Rui couldn’t help but curse silently.

Song Rui kept winking at Xia ruofei, but Xia ruofei ignored him. Song Rui coughed a few more times to attract Xia ruofei’s attention.

Unexpectedly, elder song noticed it before Xia ruofei did.

Eccentric song frowned and said,”Xiao Rui, why are you making eyes at me? What was he doing now? You’re not a child anymore, why are you still so immature?”

Song Rui quickly sat up straight and looked down, not daring to make any more unnecessary movements. However, he was scolding Xia ruofei in his heart for being too unreliable …

Xia ruofei then remembered the purpose of his trip. He smiled and said,””Xiao Rui, you should give your own opinion! This is your marriage!”

He knew that song Rui was terrified, especially in front of elder song. He did not dare to say anything but he did it on purpose. After all, this was song Rui’s own business. He still hoped that song Rui could express his opinion bravely. “Yeah!” Elder song nodded. Xiao Rui, what are you thinking? Tell me! I think this girl from the Li family is quite good. She’s a good match for you in all aspects…”

“It’s more than a match!” Song Zhilan smiled and said,”I’ve seen Li Hongyan’s resume. This girl is simply too outstanding. 1 even feel that our Xiao Rui is not worthy of her! Of course, the men of our song family are more than enough to match anyone. Moreover, Xiao Rui is getting more and more successful…”

Song Rui couldn’t help but feel depressed. Song Zhilan’s words, so he was just relying on his good family background! If he didn’t have the song family’s Halo, he wouldn’t be worthy of Miss Li! Am 1 that bad?

“Xiao Rui, tell me your opinion!” Xia ruofei said again.

This time, Xia ruofei even used a bit of his spiritual power.

Of course, song Rui was his friend. He wouldn’t use hypnosis on his friend. This trace of spiritual energy was mainly to affect song Rui’s emotions so that he could muster the courage to speak his mind.

Song Rui was not aware of Xia ruofei’s small actions, but he felt that he had become more courageous. He braced himself and said,””Grandpa, aunt, no matter who they are, 1 don’t want to marry them. They have no emotional Foundation at all. Everything is based on benefits.. This is not what I want!”
