    Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan were searching for relevant information on the computer while Mu Sheng, Liu Mansha, and the others were drinking tea and chatting. After all, other than Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan, the others knew nothing about the relevant knowledge and could not help much.

  At this moment, Xia ruofei's phone rang. He took it out and looked at the display. It was Zhao Yongjun. He stood up and said,""Brother Chen, you go ahead. I'm going to take a call."

  Chen Xuan nodded his head with a smile."Alright!"

  Xia ruofei picked up the phone and walked out of the room. At the same time, he answered the call."Big brother Zhao!"

  Zhao Yongjun laughed heartily and said,"ruofei, are you done with your work?" You shouldn't have come to the capital without us first!"

  Zhao Yongjun knew that Xia ruofei had arrived in the capital city yesterday because Wu Qiang had asked him to borrow a car. However, he heard that Xia ruofei was busy, so he didn't disturb Xia ruofei. It was only when Xia ruofei returned to the club with the car that Zhao Yongjun called.

  Xia ruofei chuckled."I've come to the capital at the last minute. I do have some things to do. Brother Zhao, you won't blame me for my lack of manners, will you?"

  "Strange! Of course I'm to blame!" Zhao Yongjun laughed and said,"you'll have to drink at least three glasses as punishment! Otherwise, it'll be hard to calm my anger!"

  Xia ruofei laughed and said,"no problem!" Not to mention three cups, even if it's thirty cups, three hundred cups, as long as big brother Zhao says the word, this little brother will drink it without hesitation!"

  "Straightforward!" Zhao Yongjun said,"by the way, ruofei, I heard from the club's driver that you've brought a lot of friends to Beijing this time? I'll make some arrangements! As a good host, we'll do it in our own club, how about it?"

  Xia ruofei quickly said,"brother Zhao, there's really no need for that!" These friends of mine are all intellectuals who study cultural relics. They have no interest in social activities at all. Well ... They just came back from the Forbidden City, and now they're all going back to their rooms to study the materials, so you don't have to work! When I'm almost done here, I'll go and have a drink with my brothers!"

  Two of the cars heading to the Forbidden City were from the club. Zhao Yongjun naturally knew where they were going, so he didn't doubt Xia ruofei's excuse at all. He smiled and said,""Alright then! Since he's your friend, I'll respect your opinion! However, if you need any help in the capital, don't hide it! Just say it! Your big brother Zhao still has some face in forty - nine city! Ordinary things can't stump me!"

  Hearing this, Xia ruofei's heart skipped a beat. He smiled and said,""Brother Zhao, now that you mention it, I do remember something that I might need your help with. I just don't know if it'll be too troublesome!" Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

  "You bastard! Why are you being so polite with me? Are we still brothers?" Zhao Yongjun pretended to be angry,"hurry up and tell me! Don't talk nonsense!"

  Xia ruofei chuckled and said,"do you know anyone from the major universities in Beijing?" It's best if you have a leadership position. "

  Zhao Yongjun was slightly stunned, then smiled.""Why are you suddenly asking about this? Don't tell me you want to further your studies in University? With your net worth, you don't need to further your studies! Or ... Do you want to pick up female students? I'm telling you, you can't let sister - in - Law down!"

  Xia ruofei didn't know whether to laugh or cry,"what does this have to do with me?" I would like to consult some experts and professors in the University. It would be best if they could give us some special lessons. "

  Zhao Yongjun laughed,"you really want to change your profession and become a scholar?."

  "Big brother Zhao, just tell me if you can or not!" Xia ruofei said.

  "No problem!" Zhao Yongjun replied readily. How could a man say no? Go ahead! What kind of expert was he looking for? I'll think of a way for you!"

  "It's mainly related to computers, such as databases, modeling, and supercomputers ..."Xia ruofei said.

  "Wait a minute!" Zhao Yongjun said,"I'll take notes! I know all the words you've said, but I don't even know what they are when put together!"

  "Okay, okay, okay, I'll speak slowly!" Xia ruofei smiled.

  "Yes, yes!" Zhao Yongjun said,"alright, you can speak now."

  "Experts in computer software. It's best if they have more research in the fields of databases, modeling, and supercomputers." Xia ruofei said slowly.

  "Software ... Database ... Modeling ... Supercomputer ..." Zhao Yongjun said as he wrote."Okay! I'll immediately carry out boss Xia's instructions! Just wait for my news!"

  "Thanks!" Xia ruofei said with a smile.

  "You're too polite!" Zhao Yongjun said,"when you're done, just remember to come and have a drink with me!"

  "Don't worry! "I can't forget ..." Xia ruofei said with a smile.

  After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei returned to the house and smiled.""The matter of inviting the expert to give a lecture has been settled. I've already asked a friend to contact him. It shouldn't be a big problem!"

  "That's great!" Chen Xuan smiled and replied,"I've already found some information and made a list. I think we can first find a large library and self - study the relevant knowledge. Otherwise, we won't know anything when we meet an expert. We won't even know where to start asking questions!"

  "Hahaha! That makes sense!" Xia ruofei smiled and said,"why don't we ... Go now! The information in the National Library is definitely complete! It's not far from here, so how about we go there?"
