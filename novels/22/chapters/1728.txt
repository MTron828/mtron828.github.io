Chapter 1729: Handling it with ease (1)

Xia ruofei smiled.”If you ask me how I feel, I really don’t feel anything. I don’t feel like I’m the pride of the Chinese or the hero of Australia. I just happened to be there, and with my survival instinct and a bit of luck, I felt nothing.”

Xia ruofei’s answer was very sincere and there was nothing fake. The reporter was very satisfied.

As soon as he finished speaking, the reporters immediately fought to ask a second round of questions.

Feng Jing felt like her head was about to explode, but Xia ruofei could still hear everyone’s questions clearly in this environment. He even chose a question to answer.

“Just now, this reporter from Beijing Evening News asked me what I was thinking when I was flying the plane.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”actually, I didn’t have any other thoughts in my mind at that time. I was so focused on controlling the plane that I couldn’t focus on my mind. How could I have the time to have any other random thoughts?”

Everyone burst into laughter.

Xia ruofei said seriously,”actually, when a person is fully focused, there must be no distracting thoughts in their mind. Anxiety, fear, and other emotions will all disappear. There is only one thought in their mind. No matter what, we must land this plane safely. There are hundreds of lives we are talking about! And my most important business partner, our company’s CEO Feng, is sitting behind me!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Feng Jing’s face blushed uncontrollably. Whether it was the reporters, fans, or onlookers, they all applauded to pay their respects to Xia ruofei.

At this moment, a female reporter asked again,””President Xia, what were you thinking about after the plane landed safely?”

Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”is this the third question?” Would your peers have any objections?”

Everyone laughed, but it seemed that the reporters were also quite interested in this question, so no one raised any objections.

Hence, Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””After the plane landed, my first reaction was fatigue. My physical fitness is not bad. Although flying a plane in that situation is a very tiring job, it is not too tiring. I leaned back in the driver’s seat and rested for a while. The first thought that came to my mind was,”I’m never taking a plane again, it’s too scary ...”

“Hahaha!” Everyone couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

Xia ruofei also smiled and said,”I’m just joking. The plane is actually very safe!” I really can’t remember what I was thinking at that time. I remember high – fiving Captain Brook in the cockpit and President Feng behind me in celebration. Then ... I think I said to President Feng,”Finally, we’re on solid ground. This feeling is great!”

Feng Rao couldn’t help but smile gently. She had also recalled the scene back then.

At this time, another reporter asked,”director Xia, I heard that the China Civil Aviation Administration of China will also award you a medal. Many domestic airlines have expressed their willingness to recruit you as a pilot. They will provide free training. Do you have any response to this?”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment and said,”I haven’t been informed of the two things you mentioned.” They weren’t just joking, were they? I condemn this kind of behavior!”

Everyone laughed again. However, they were used to Xia ruofei’s style and did not take his joke seriously. They would not take it out of context and exaggerate it to report it. Now that Xia ruofei’s image was extremely high, if they dared to report it like that, they would definitely be scolded to death.

After Xia ruofei made a joke, he said seriously,””I’ll say the same thing again. I just happened to be on this flight. Out of survival instinct and a little luck, I finally completed an incredible mission, so there’s really nothing to be commended.”

He paused for a moment and continued,”as for becoming a professional pilot, I don’t have such an idea for the time being. As you all know, I have my own company. My career is going well. I don’t have any plans to change my profession for the time being. However, after this incident, I’ve developed a great interest in flying. If I have the time in the future, I’ll consider learning a private flying license. ”

Although Xia ruofei said that he would only answer three questions, after answering the fourth question, he still patiently answered a few more questions before apologizing to everyone and ending the interview.

However, Xia ruofei did not leave immediately. Instead, he walked to the group of fans who had come to pick him up and said with a smile,””I can’t believe I have fans waiting for me at the airport. This is the treatment of a big star! I’m not used to it ...”

The fans of the “overbearing president’s fan club” were very excited when they saw Xia ruofei being so approachable. Some of them were so excited that they could not speak. One of the braver girls said,””President Xia, we’re your first batch of fans! We’ve already set up a Baidu Tieba and a Weibo group, so you have to go there often in the future!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”thank you, everyone!” Thank you, everyone! But ...”

Xia ruofei pointed at the banner and said,””Who can explain this to me? Why was it an overbearing President? I’m the chairman, okay? Our company’s President is there!”
