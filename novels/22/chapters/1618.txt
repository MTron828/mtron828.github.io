Chapter 1619: Greetings to elder song (1)

Xia ruofei didn’t think too much about it. After he entered the house, he put his hand into his bag with Song Wei on his back. In fact, he took out array flags from the space and set up the time array.

Just as Xia ruofei was about to step into the array, he saw Song Wei still standing there. He couldn’t help but laugh and said,””Why are you in a daze? Go in! Weren’t you in a hurry just now?”

“Who’s in a hurry?”Song Wei blushed and asked.

After she finished speaking, she rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei seductively and stepped into the array.

Xia ruofei laughed and followed her into the time formation. The time inside and outside the formation was 90 times faster than the outside. If he stayed outside for one more second, Song Wei would have to wait for one more minute.

Looking outside from the formation, it was as if time had frozen.

The second hand on the wall clock moved every minute. Through the glass window, he could see the birds in the courtyard flying across the sky at an extremely slow speed. The fallen leaves seemed to be fixed in the air by an invisible hand.

Although she had entered the time array many times, Song Wei still couldn’t help but be dazed by this miraculous scene. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Let’s start!” Xia ruofei said.

Song Wei came back to her senses and nodded,”Alright!”

Then, she took out the spiritual crystal from her pocket, sat cross – legged, and placed it on her lap.

Xia ruofei sat down at the same time and placed the spiritual crystals on the table.

The two of them looked at each other and reached out their hands in unison, their palms touching.

......

Cultivation knew no time.

Although Xia ruofei and Song Wei’s cultivations were very low, once they started to cultivate, they would forget the passage of time.

More than three hours had passed in the outside world, but the two of them had actually been cultivating for more than ten days.

Of course, their cultivation had not reached the level of not eating, drinking, or sleeping for more than ten days, so they did stop to eat and rest in between.

But even so, the total amount of time they had spent cultivating was at least seven or eight days.

Even though she was mentally exhausted, Song Wei’s beautiful eyes were filled with excitement.

Through this cultivation, she had taken a solid step towards Qi disciple Level 3. Her spiritual power had also improved unconsciously during the cultivation. At this time, although she could not completely eliminate the peach blossom miasma, she could already effectively suppress the stubborn poison. With the help of Xia ruofei’s array, the effect of the peach blossom miasma on her was very small.

Moreover, during the process of cultivation, the intimacy of their souls became more obvious.

When the frequency of their souls was almost in sync, both of them seemed to be able to feel the call from the depths of their souls, and there was an illusion that the two souls would merge into one in the next moment.

To be honest, the feeling of soul resonance was wonderful. Even Xia ruofei could not help but reminisce about it, let alone Song Wei, who had placed her heart on Xia ruofei.

When she finished her cultivation, Song Wei’s face was still red. She did not even dare to look in Xia ruofei’s direction.

Xia ruofei felt a little uncomfortable too, but he had better self – Control than Song Wei. He managed to calm himself down after taking a few deep breaths.

Xia ruofei smiled and said to Song Wei,””It’s almost time. Let’s end our cultivation here! I’m going to visit elder song tonight, so it’s not good to be late ...”

“Oh!” Song Wei quickly replied. Then let’s go! I’m going back to school too!”

“Why don’t you just stay here?” Xia ruofei asked.

Xia ruofei immediately felt that something was wrong and quickly explained,””Don’t misunderstand! I’m saying that there are quite a lot of rooms here, so it’ll be more convenient for us to cultivate if you stay here. ”

Song Wei’s face was slightly warm. She was quite tempted by Xia ruofei’s suggestion.

But in the end, she still shook her head and said,””I’m going back to school. I’ll come over again when you have time! You’re not at home at night, and I’m quite uncomfortable here alone ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”that’s fine!” Let’s go! I’ll send you back to school first ...”

“I’ll take a taxi back. Don’t delay your trip to the chief ‘s. ” Song Wei said.

“It can’t be delayed!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”basically, it’s on the way!”

Song Wei nodded and said,”Alright then!”

Xia ruofei asked Song Wei to wait in the courtyard for a while. He tidied up his things in the room and called Wu Qiang to ask him to prepare the car. Then, he took a small bag and walked out of the room.

When the two of them arrived at the backyard, Wu Qiang had already driven the Land Rover out of the garage and turned on the heater.

He stood next to the Land Rover and asked respectfully when he saw Xia ruofei,””Where are we going, boss?”

Xia ruofei said,”I’ll drive by myself today. Wuqiang, I won’t be back for dinner. You can settle it yourself. Don’t worry about me.”

Wu Qiang also knew that he shouldn’t ask too much about things that he shouldn ‘T. He immediately replied,”Okay, boss!”

Xia ruofei and Song Wei got into the car and left the courtyard house in liuhai Lane.

It wasn’t yet the evening peak hour in Beijing, so although the roads weren’t smooth, they weren’t particularly congested.

After about half an hour, the car arrived at the East Gate of Capital University.

Xia ruofei stopped the car at the temporary parking area at the school gate. Song Wei opened the car door and got off.
