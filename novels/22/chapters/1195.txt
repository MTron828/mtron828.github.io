Translator: 549690339

In the big office, the employees in charge of the platform’s back – end data each had their own duties. Feng Jing, Xiao Qiang, pang Hao, and the other company executives were standing in the office.

Seeing Xia ruofei enter, Feng Rao immediately went up to him and greeted,””The chairman is here!”

“How’s the situation?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Everything is ready.” Feng Jing said,”other than the shop in the heavenly cat, the other four e – commerce companies have opened their own shops for us. The first batch of goods we prepared three days ago has been sent to the nearest e – commerce warehouse. We will have to deal with the orders from the heavenly cat.”

“Can that person spin it?” Xia ruofei asked.

“We will definitely need to hire people to operate it in the long run.” Feng Jing said,”for now, other than the employees who are already running the shop, our administrative and marketing departments have tried to transfer as many people as possible to support us. Let’s deal with today’s peak order first.”

“Mm! We’re still releasing the goods in stages. After we’re done today, we’ll hurry up and recruit people!” Xia ruofei said.

“Understood!” Feng Rao replied.

“How’s the coordination in the logistics department?”Xia ruofei continued.

Feng Jing said,”our shop has been operating normally. It’s just that we didn’t focus on our business in the past. However, we have signed a major customer Agreement with the logistics company. This time, the news of our jaded skin cream has been hyped up. The logistics company has also contacted us on their own initiative and said that they will give us certain preferential policies to ensure that we can send orders to the entire country as soon as possible.”

Xia ruofei nodded.”Other than special requests from our customers, we will try our best to use high – Quality logistics companies. It doesn’t matter even if the cost is slightly higher.”

“Understood!” Feng Jing nodded and said,”most of our orders are from SF Express. They’re fast and reliable!”

“Very good. Our company focuses on improving our brand. You have to pay attention to every detail!” Xia ruofei said, satisfied.

At this moment, Feng Jing’s assistant, Liu Qian, said nervously,””It’s time!”

Xia ruofei and Feng Rao looked at each other and walked over.

A row of computers displayed the data of different e – commerce platforms. Feng Jing even had someone download plug – ins to read the server time of each platform.

Nowadays, the internet was basically used to synchronize time, so the server time of each e – commerce platform was roughly synchronized, and the error would not exceed half a second.

When the time displayed on the plug – in became 12: At 00:00, the back – end data immediately began to rise wildly.

The real – time order data shot up like a rocket.

In less than ten seconds, the number of orders on each platform exceeded 1000.

And this number was still rising.

Every second that passed, a large number of orders would appear.

At 12:02, the employee in charge of monitoring jingbei shopping mall’s own store, Taoyuan, stood up first. His voice was filled with irrepressible joy.”Chairman, CEO Feng, jingbei mall is sold out!”

Almost at the same time, the inventory of the gold mining group’s Skycat flagship store and the remaining four platforms were all sold out.

Feng Rao was very excited. She couldn’t help but clench her fists and said,””Beautiful! Chairman, we’ve definitely succeeded this time!”

For the first sale of the Jade skin cream, Xia ruofei had distributed 10000 copies to each e – commerce platform. Among them, 5000 copies of the 588th edition, 3000 copies of the 1888th edition, and 2000 copies of the 3888th edition. In addition, he had also specially provided 30 limited edition skin code series, five copies each for each e – commerce platform.

It was equivalent to more than 50000 bottles of jaded skin cream, and it was all sold out in just two to three minutes. This was a rather impressive result!

Even the limited – edition jaded skin cream that cost 880000 Yuan a bottle was sold out. It was 880000 Huaxia dollars, not 88 yuan! It could only be said that there were too many rich people nowadays.

The employees were all overjoyed, but Xia ruofei was very calm. He smiled and said,””This is just the beginning! “Moreover, they’ve only bought all of them now. It’s hard to guarantee that there won’t be any future orders that are canceled due to late payments or refunds ...” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“That’s definitely not the majority!”Feng Rao said with a smile. Chairman, don’t you worry! Our jaded skin ointment is on fire! Our paradise Corporation is going to be famous all over the world ...”

Naturally, Xia ruofei was very happy, but he didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. The main business of the Tao Yuan company was the production and sales of agricultural products. However, after so long, the most popular product was actually a skin care product. Perhaps the special medicine for treating autism, Yangxin soup, would be launched soon, and it would be even more popular!

Xia ruofei thought to himself,”isn’t this a little improper?”

At this moment, Feng Rao walked up to them with a smile and said,””Chairman, why are you in a daze? Was he calculating how much money he had earned? Don’t bother, the sales statistics are out! Take a look!”

Xia ruofei took the report that had just been printed out and looked at the total figures. The total sales this time had reached more than 108 million Yuan.

The cost of this batch of jaded skin cream, including the raw materials, labor, logistics, platform, and so on, would not exceed three million Yuan. It was not even a fraction of the sales.

In other words, in a short two minutes, the Paradise Corporation had made a profit of 100 million!
