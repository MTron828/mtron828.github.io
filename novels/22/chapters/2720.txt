2721 Scheming against a golden core cultivator (1)

The next day, Xia ruofei arranged for bainilatti to leave Paradise Island as well.

He got benilatti to drive a speedboat that was parked at Paradise island’s dock to evates Island to wait for orders.

Benilatti also had property on evatz Island, and he would definitely not betray Xia ruofei since he had a soul seal planted on him. Hence, Xia ruofei was at ease to let him leave. After all, he would only be a burden if he stayed.

In fact, after subduing Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou, bainilatti was no longer of any use.

A soul slave without any cultivation would not be of any help to Xia ruofei.

Bainilatti’s nature was that of someone who only saw money. Back then, he was the one who sold a lot of information about Paradise Island to Wang Boshan, which made Xia ruofei somewhat passive. Therefore, Xia ruofei did not really care about benilatti’s life or death. He could use a secret technique to remove the soul seal so that he would not take up a spot. After all, although removing the soul seal was dangerous, it was mainly targeted at the person controlled by the soul seal. As the master, Xia ruofei would not be in any danger.

Even if he failed to extract the soul seal and benilatti died, his soul slave spot would be empty. In fact, it was considered a success.

However, Xia ruofei still felt a tinge of compassion and did not directly use the soul extracting seal.

Of course, the most important reason was that using the secret technique would consume a lot of Xia ruofei’s spiritual energy. With the enemy in front of them, any unnecessary consumption had to be avoided.

Hence, after some consideration, Xia ruofei decided to let benilatti be on standby at Evarts Island.

Benilatti set off on his speedboat, not knowing that he had already walked one round around the gates of hell.

Xia ruofei and Li Yifu sat together again and went over the entire plan from beginning to end several times. Finally, Xia ruofei decided,””It’s done! I think it’s close to perfection. There shouldn’t be any oversights!”

“En!” Li Yifu nodded and said,”senior granduncle, this matter should not be delayed. Since it has been decided, I think we should implement it as soon as possible!”

“That’s right!” Xia ruofei’s eyes were filled with determination.”Then let’s begin!”

……

In a seaside villa in the rich District of evates Island, Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou were drinking tea and chatting in the living room. Xia ruofei had given them the order to stay in evates and wait for orders, so they didn’t go anywhere for the past two days and stayed at home, waiting for Xia ruofei’s orders 24/7.

Wang Boshan’s phone rang.

The two of them stood up at the same time. Wang Boshan hurriedly took out his phone, looked at the caller ID, and immediately picked up,””Mr. Ling!”

As long as it was a phone call, there was bound to be the possibility of being monitored, especially when Wang Boshan was still in the capital Island of ponautu, evac. This kind of small country did not have any moral integrity, and it was hard to say if there were any monitoring methods for outsiders. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

That was why Xia ruofei strictly ordered Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou not to call him “master” when they were on the phone. They were not even allowed to call him “Mr. Xia” but to use the alias “Mr. Ling”. In fact, Xia ruofei had just casually used Ling Qingxue’s surname.

“There’s some progress,” Xia ruofei said indifferently.”Let’s meet!”

“Alright!” Wang Boshan quickly said,”what time would be convenient for you?”

“In an hour!” Xia ruofei said.

“No problem! We’ll definitely be there on time!” Wang Boshan said.

Xia ruofei had told them the meeting place before they left the day before yesterday, so they did not mention the meeting place at all.

After Wang Boshan hung up the phone, he said to Zheng Yongshou,””Martial uncle Zheng, there’s news from there. Let’s pack up and set off immediately!”

Zheng Yongshou knew that it was Xia ruofei’s call, so he didn’t dare to delay. He nodded and said,”Alright, don’t be late!”

……

An hour later, a speedboat slowly approached a fishing boat in the middle of Paradise Island and evates Island.

Wang Boshan caught Xia ruofei’s rope and connected the boat to the fishing boat.

Xia ruofei tiptoed and leaped into the air, landing lightly on the deck of the fishing boat.

He came here alone today and left Li Yifu on Peach Blossom Island. Firstly, there was no one on the island now, so Li Yifu was needed to stay and guard the place. Secondly, Xia ruofei also hoped that Li Yifu could spend more time cultivating. It would be good if he could improve his cultivation.

As soon as Xia ruofei landed on the deck, Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou knelt down on one knee and cupped their fists,””Good day, master!”

This was also the etiquette of the cultivation world. Of course, it was only a fist salute. Cultivators would definitely not kneel on one knee when they met.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” Let’s talk in the cabin!”

The three of them came to the cabin. Xia ruofei sat down boldly while Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou stood in front of him with their hands by their sides.

“To protect the secret of the Peach Blossom Island, I’ve decided to trap the star Seizer sect’s sect master, Luo Qingfeng,” Xia ruofei said.

Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou were not surprised, they said in unison,””What should this subordinate do, master?”

“The initial plan is like this,” Xia ruofei said.”Wang Boshan will stay on Peach Blossom Island, and Zheng Yongshou will return to the star Seizer sect and report to Luo Qingfeng about the situation on Peach Blossom Island. Let me first talk about Zheng Yongshou’s mission!”

“Yes! Master, please speak!” Zheng Yongshou quickly said.
