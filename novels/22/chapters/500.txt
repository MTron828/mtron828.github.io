Chapter 501: Farm expansion (2)

Xia ruofei sat down on the bed and hugged Ling Qingxue.””Did I wake you up? You should sleep a little longer! I’m going to the village to do something this morning, and I’ll be back to accompany you soon. ”

Ling Qingxue shook her head and said,””I still have things to do at the company! I have to go back. ”

Staying over at Xia ruofei’s place last night was already a huge breakthrough for Ling Qingxue. If she did not show up at the office for the whole day, she could not imagine what her father would think.

Just thinking about it made her blush, so even if she still felt exhausted, she still insisted on going back.

“Can your body take it?” Xia ruofei asked with concern.

Ling Qingxue blushed and rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei.””I’m fine ...”

As she spoke, she got off the bed. Just as she stood up, she felt her legs go soft and her body couldn’t help but sway. Xia ruofei quickly caught her and said,””You’re still fine? Don’t go anywhere today. I’ll give uncle Ling a call and tell him that you’re not feeling well. You can rest here for a day before going back. ”

“Don ‘t!” Ling Qingxue quickly said,”then my dad will definitely think in the wrong direction ...”

“If he thinks that way, doesn’t that fit the truth?” Xia ruofei laughed evilly.

“You’re still talking! “This is all your fault ...” Ling Qingxue pouted and pinched Xia ruofei hard.

Xia ruofei cried out in pain,”ouch ... Wife, be gentle!” How can you blame me? I remember that you were the one who wanted to ...”

“Don’t say anymore!” Ling Qingxue pounced over and covered Xia ruofei’s mouth. She then said unreasonably,”I don’t care. I’m leaving in a while! Aren’t you a Divine Doctor? You must have a way, right?”

Xia ruofei’s sneaky gaze swept across Ling Qingxue’s lithe and delicate body. He chuckled and said,””Wife, I’ve heard that when drunk people endure the discomfort and drink another cup the next morning, their symptoms will ease a lot. This is called ‘soul – returning wine’. Do you think if we do morning exercises together, we can also ...”

“Don’t even think about it!” Ling Qingxue was so scared that her face turned pale. She quickly said,”you’re not allowed to touch me again today ... Otherwise, I ... I really can’t even walk anymore ...”

Naturally, Xia ruofei was just teasing Ling Qingxue. He could not help but burst out laughing. To Xia ruofei, Ling Qingxue’s reaction indirectly proved how brave he was in that aspect. As a man, this was, of course, something that gave him a great sense of achievement.

“I’m just joking with you! “Look at how scared you are ...” Xia ruofei smiled and stood up.”Let me get you a cup of hot water!” Then, you should be able to recover a lot of your strength after eating something ...”

With that, Xia ruofei stood up and walked to the side. He poured half a cup of warm water from the water dispenser.

His back was facing Ling Qingxue, and his broad back completely blocked Ling Qingxue’s line of sight. Thus, he secretly took out a small bottle of the solution from the spirit Heart Flower petals and mixed it with the warm water.

Even though the petal solution was diluted, and not a lot was poured out, it would definitely be of great help to Ling Qingxue’s recovery.

Xia ruofei walked over and handed the cup to Ling Qingxue.””Drink some water first, I’ll go to the kitchen downstairs and cook you a bowl of noodles!”

Ling Qingxue took the cup and held it with both hands, feeling the warmth from her palm. Her eyes were filled with sweetness as she said,””You can just find some biscuits and bread. You don’t have to cook noodles. It’s too troublesome ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”what’s so troublesome about cooking noodles?” Besides, I haven’t had breakfast yet! Qingxue, drink the water and rest on the bed for a while. I’ll come up and call you when the noodles are ready!”

“En!” Ling Qingxue smiled sweetly and said,”thank you, RUO Fei!”

Xia ruofei stretched out his hand and ruffled Ling Qingxue’s hair that had just been tidied up. He looked at Ling Qingxue dotingly and said,””Silly girl! Why are you thanking me ...”

After that, Xia ruofei left the bedroom and went downstairs.

Very quickly, Xia ruofei had cooked two bowls of noodles. He added a Lotus egg in each bowl, as well as some cabbage that he had stored in the interspace. These were all harvested after planting vegetables in the interspace. Anyway, they would not go bad no matter how long they were stored in the interspace, so Xia ruofei could take them out and use them as he pleased. It was very convenient.

Before Xia ruofei could go upstairs to call her, Ling Qingxue had already come downstairs dressed neatly.

“It smells so good!” Ling Qingxue could already smell the fragrance from the stairs.

Last night’s fierce battle had consumed a lot of energy, and she had long been famished. Now, seeing the steaming hot noodles, fragrant poached eggs, and dark green vegetables, she couldn’t help but eat.

“You’re up! Quickly come over and eat it while it’s hot!” Xia ruofei laughed as he took off his apron and hung it behind the kitchen door.”Eat more! Last night’s energy consumption was not small ...”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but roll her eyes at Xia ruofei again. However, she didn’t argue with Xia ruofei. After sitting down, she picked up her chopsticks and started eating. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Xia ruofei was also feeling a little hungry. Seeing this, he sat down opposite Ling Qingxue with a smile and ate his noodles.

After the two of them finished eating, Xia ruofei thought for a while and gave Lei Hu a call, asking him to drive the company’s Mercedes – Benz to the villa.

Very quickly, Lei Hu arrived at the villa.

“Brother Xia, the car is here. Do you have any other orders?” Lei Hu asked.
