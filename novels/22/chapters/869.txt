“Yue ‘e,” uncle Luo said with a smile,”you can decide on this matter.”

Lin Yue ‘e nodded.”Alright, Auntie. RUO Fei, I’ll listen to you!”

“Then I’ll have to trouble you in the future, sister!” Uncle Luo said.

Hu ‘er’s mother was very happy and said,””It’s no trouble, no trouble, no trouble at all. I’m so happy! Nan Nan, you will live with grandma after school starts! Grandma will make delicious food for you every day!” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Thank you, grandma!” Nan Nan said sensibly.

At this time, Lin Yue ‘e said,”Auntie, since Nan Nan is staying at your place, I’ll pay you 2000 Yuan a month for her food!”

“Hey, how much can a child eat? What’s the point of paying for food!” Hu Zi’s mother waved her hand and said,”no need, no need!”

“That won’t do!” Lin Yue ‘e said sternly,”Auntie, you have helped me take care of Nan Nan. I don’t know how to thank you anymore. How can I let you pay for Nan Nan’s food expenses?” If you don’t accept the money, I will definitely not let Nan Nan stay there!”

“You ... You don’t need so much! How can a little girl eat so much!” Hu Zi’s mother said helplessly.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”Godma, since sister – in – Law has said so, let’s just take the money!” When the time comes, you should prepare more nutritious dishes. Nan Nan is still growing!”

Xia ruofei understood Lin Yue ‘e very well. If Hu’ er’s mother did not accept the money, she would definitely not be able to get over it. It would be a waste of effort to persuade her to accept the arrangement because of the food expenses.

Besides, Xia ruofei was giving Lin Yue ‘e a monthly salary of 8000 Yuan. 2000 Yuan was not a big expense for her family. Besides, Xia ruofei could also give her bonuses and benefits, so there was no need to worry about this issue.

Since even Xia ruofei had said so, Hu Zi’s mother could only smile bitterly and nod.””Alright then! Yue ‘e, you’re too serious. We’re not outsiders, so why do you have to make such a clear distinction?”

Lin Yue ‘e smiled and said,”that’s a different matter!” I can’t let you work so hard to help take care of Nan Nan and have to fork out your own money!”

Lin Qiao smiled and said,”alright!” Since we’ve come to an agreement, let’s have a toast! Just take it as ... Wishing Nan Nan to go to the city to attend primary school!”

“I also wish that Qiao’ er will be studying at Heron Island University soon!” Xia ruofei laughed.

Everyone laughed and raised their glasses together. The atmosphere was very harmonious.

Xia ruofei also heaved a sigh of relief. They had finally reached a consensus on Nan Nan’s admission. The next step was to coordinate the schools.

Relatively speaking, this was much easier.

After lunch, Xia ruofei returned to his room.

After some consideration, he finally found the phone number of the new Sanshan municipal Administrative Committee Secretary, song Qiming, and made a call.

Tian Huilan had already gone to Beijing with elder song a few days ago, and song Qiming had officially taken office.

Xia ruofei also knew that it was a bit of a fuss to go to the Secretary of the municipal Committee for the sake of a child’s education. However, all of his connections were of a higher level. If it was when Tian Huilan was in charge, he could go to Tian Huilan’s Secretary directly. However, the Secretary had changed to song Qiming. Xia ruofei did not know song Qiming’s Secretary, nor did he have his contact information, so he could only call song Qiming directly.

Song Qiming had given Xia ruofei his own private number, so the call was picked up after two or three rings.

Xia ruofei heard song Qiming’s warm and hearty laughter from his phone.””Little Xia, how are you?”

“Secretary song, how are you?” Xia ruofei said politely,”I hope I didn’t disturb your rest.”

“No, no, I’m doing research in the Bell Tower District!” Song Qiming smiled and said,”I just finished a discussion with the members of the district Party Committee and am about to go for lunch! Xiao Xia, what’s the matter?”

“Yes, Secretary song. I have a favor to ask of you ...” Xia ruofei said.

“What’s the matter?” Song Qiming said readily.

Xia ruofei was a little embarrassed as he said,””Secretary song, it’s not a big deal. It’s just that I don’t know any other higher – ups in Sanshan city, so I had no choice but to trouble you!”

Song Qiming laughed and said,”it’s okay, just come to me!” The chief has personally instructed that as long as your matter doesn’t go against my principles, I will create conditions for you even if there are no conditions!”

“Thank you, Secretary song!” Xia ruofei said,”I’m looking for you mainly because of a war comrade’s child’s school ...”

Then, Xia ruofei briefly explained Nan Nan’s situation and said,””Secretary song, that’s the general situation. You see ...”

“Little Xia, you’re really loyal!” Song Qiming did not expect Xia ruofei to ask him for help for the first time. It was about his comrade. He had a better impression of Xia ruofei.

He pondered for a moment and said,”the child is the child of a martyr. He should be given some care when he enters the school. This is also in line with the policy!” Xiao Xia, have you guys chosen a school that you like?”

“Secretary song, if it’s possible, I hope that Nan Nan can enter bell Tower No. 2 primary school,” Xia ruofei said immediately.

The Zhong ‘er Central Primary School in the Zhong Lou District was a key school in the province, and the corresponding junior high school was also one of the top junior high schools in Sanshan city, Yan’ an junior high school. Excluding the fact that junior high schools went to private junior high schools, it should be the best primary and junior high school plan in Sanshan city if only a public junior high school was considered.

Of course, more importantly, the clock tower was only two stops away from Hu Zi’s mother’s home, which was the forestry Bureau’s family courtyard. They could pick up and drop off from school by foot every day, and they were on the same side, so they didn’t need to go through any traffic lights.

This was the best choice that Xia ruofei could think of.

“Xiao Xia, please wait a moment. Don’t hang up yet ...” Song Qiming said.

“Okay, Secretary song.” Xia ruofei said.

Bell Tower District, Party Committee meeting room.

The Standing Committee of the Bell Tower District’s Party Committee and the Deputy leaders of the government, People’s Congress, and Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference were all gathered together.

Because today was the day that Secretary song of the municipal Party Committee came down to do research.

When a new leader took office, he would first go to the various areas of the jurisdiction to investigate and understand the situation. He would then determine the work ideas for the next period. This was already management.

The first stop of Secretary song’s research was the Bell Tower District, which showed how much importance he attached to it.

Today, there would be a discussion. In the afternoon, Secretary song would have individual talks with the main leaders of the district Party Committee.

Everyone was very enthusiastic about speaking during the morning discussion, so the meeting didn’t end until around 12:30.

Just as everyone was about to go to the district government cafeteria to eat, they saw Secretary song get up to answer the phone. They gathered on the other side of the conference room to avoid any suspicion of eavesdropping on the leader’s conversation.

The leaders of the Bell Tower District whispered to each other while paying attention to song Qiming’s movements.

After song Qiming said a few words, he covered the microphone and said,””Comrade he Feng, come over for a moment.”

The Deputy District head in charge of education, he Feng, was stunned for a moment, then quickly said,””Okay, Secretary song!”

Then, he quickly walked over.

The Secretary, District head, and other leaders of the Bell Tower District looked at each other and watched enviously as he Feng walked over quickly. Secretary song had been transferred from another province and there were almost no familiar cadres here. However, Deputy District head he had already made an appointment with Secretary song so quickly. It was really the envy of others!

Song Qiming walked out of the meeting room with his phone in his hand. He Feng naturally followed him.

“Comrade he Feng, I have a friend’s child who wants to go to the No. 2 primary school of the clock tower,” song Qiming said in a low voice.

“Okay, Secretary song!” He Feng quickly said.

He was also overjoyed. The leader had just taken office, and he had the opportunity to perform. This matter was just a small matter to him, but it could leave a good impression on the Secretary. It was like a pillow when he was drowsy!

Song Qiming said,”comrade he Feng, give your contact information to Xiao Cao. A young man with the surname Xia will contact you. If he has any requests, you must try your best to satisfy them. If you have any difficulties, you can contact me directly.”

Xiao Cao was song Qiming’s Secretary, Guangzhi Cao. He used to be an ordinary staff member in the municipal Secretary Office. This time, he was chosen by song Qiming as his personal secretary and suddenly became a popular person in the political circle of the three mountains.

“Yes, Secretary song!” He Feng said, suppressing his excitement.

Song Qiming nodded slightly. Seeing that song Qiming was about to continue the call, he Feng immediately bowed slightly to song Qiming and went back to the meeting room to find Secretary Cao.
