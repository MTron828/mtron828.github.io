2878 The magical bead (2)

Therefore, after some slight adjustments, he stood up and prepared to leave the spirit map space and return to the outside world.

He knew that Ling Qingxue, Song Wei, and the others must have been worried about him.

However, before he left, Xia ruofei still used his heart to inform Xia Qing to come over to the Archean realm. He wanted to ask about the situation in the space.

Very quickly, Xia Qing’s figure appeared at the Archean realm. At this moment, Xia ruofei had just returned to the side of the pond after crossing the Jade Bridge.

Xia Qing saw Xia ruofei for the first time and revealed a trace of joy. Then, she immediately lowered her head and said respectfully,””Congratulations to master for breaking through to the early golden core stage!”

“You can tell that I’ve broken through?” Xia ruofei asked with great interest.

“Master,” Xia Qing said respectfully,”the aura on your body is completely the aura of a golden core cultivator. I can sense it.”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but look deeply at Xia Qing. Although Xia Qing was a soul puppet that completely obeyed him, his understanding of Xia Qing was very limited. Xia Qing was restricted by the established rules of the space, and there were many things that he couldn’t tell him before his cultivation reached the required level.

Now, it seemed that Xia Qing could tell that he had broken through to the Golden core stage at a glance, so his own strength should at least not be weaker than that of a golden core cultivator.

Xia ruofei didn’t ask further because he knew that if he couldn’t tell him, he would definitely keep his mouth shut even if he was his master.

“Master,” said Xia Qing,”since you’ve already broken through to the Golden core stage, I have something to give you.”

“Oh?” Xia ruofei’s interest was piqued. “What is it? Let me see!”

It could only be taken out when he broke through to the Golden core stage. This thing was definitely not simple. Xia ruofei’s anticipation was immediately aroused.

“Master, please wait for a moment!” Xia Qing said respectfully.

After saying that, Xia Qing left the Archean realm with a flash.

Xia ruofei subconsciously tried to sense it, but was surprised to find that he couldn’t sense Xia Qing’s existence. He had absolute control over the spirit map space. No matter where Xia Qing was in the space, he could find her immediately with a thought.

Now that Xia ruofei realized that he had lost track of Xia Qing, his curiosity was piqued.

Could it be that there was a place in the space that he could not control or even sense?

Xia Qing returned very quickly. Almost a moment later, he reappeared at the Archean realm. At this moment, he had a Jade Pearl in his hand.

Xia Qing presented the Jade Pearl to Xia ruofei with both hands and said respectfully,””Master, this is what the previous master instructed me to give you when you have reached the Golden core stage. Please accept it!”

Xia ruofei took the bead curiously and asked,””What is this?”

The surface of the Pearl was engraved with the Tai Chi Yin Yang fish pattern. Xia ruofei tried to use his spiritual power to examine it but realized that his spiritual power could not penetrate the surface of the Pearl. Naturally, he could not get any useful information.

Xia Qing said,”when the previous master gave it to this subordinate, he didn’t say what it was.” However, the previous master said that when master breaks through to the Golden core stage, he can give it to you. The previous master also said to ask you to input your spiritual power and vital Qi at the two points of the yin – yang fish pattern at the same time. Other than that, there are no other instructions. ”

Xia ruofei’s curiosity had reached its peak. He didn’t hesitate and held the bead with two fingers. At the same time, he injected his spiritual power and primordial Qi into the Yin Yang fish pattern to check it out. He knew that the immortal Shanhe wouldn’t be so bored as to use such a bead to plot against a junior. Since the immortal Shanhe had instructed so, he would just do as he was told.

When Xia ruofei’s spiritual energy and Yuan Qi were transferred into the Pearl, the Pearl lit up immediately. The brightness was so high that it was like a small sun. Xia ruofei subconsciously closed his eyes.

However, he quickly opened his eyes again because he didn’t want to miss a single detail.

Just then, to Xia ruofei’s surprise, a wisp of green smoke emerged from the Pearl and quickly condensed into the figure of a middle – aged man in a Taoist robe ...

Xia ruofei’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets at this unimaginable scene.

He had thought of countless possibilities. Perhaps this Pearl contained an exquisite cultivation technique or a mystical formation, or perhaps directly consuming it would allow one’s cultivation to advance greatly. However, he had never thought that a figure would actually run out of the Pearl.

Xia Qing also opened his eyes wide. His body trembled slightly as he cried out in a trembling voice,””Master ...”

Xia ruofei thought that Xia Qing was calling him, but he soon realized that Xia Qing’s eyes were completely focused on the Taoist – robed figure that had just appeared.

At this moment, Xia ruofei had a thought.”Could it be ... That the person in the Daoist robe was ... The previous owner of the spirit map space, immortal mountain river? If it was immortal mountain river, then ... This state ... Could it be his soul? In other words ... Immortal mountain river was already dead, and his soul had always been hidden in this small bead?

Xia ruofei suddenly felt that his brain was not working.

The middle – aged man in a Daoist robe looked kind and had a gentle smile on his face. His eyes fell on Xia Qing and said,””Little six, are you okay?”

Xiaoliu? Xia ruofei couldn’t help but have a suspicion. Could it be that this immortal mountain river’s soul had stayed in the Pearl for too long and his memory was affected? This was obviously Xia Qing!

However, Xia Qing said respectfully,””Master, little six has been fine. He just misses you ...”

Only then did Xia ruofei Pat his forehead, completely coming back to his senses. He was the one who gave her the name “bi an, Xia Qing.” Before he became the master of the spirit map space, Xia Qing was definitely not called Xia Qing!

It seemed that everything was so shocking that his brain had short – circuited ... Xia ruofei could not help but smile bitterly.

At this moment, the middle – aged man in Taoist robes nodded at Xia Qing and then turned his eyes to Xia ruofei. He had a warm smile on his face and his voice seemed to have a unique charm.””Little friend, we finally meet ...”

Xia ruofei was a little confused. He looked at the shadow and asked with uncertainty,””May I ask ... Are you venerable mountain river?”

The shadow smiled.”To be exact, I’m not immortal mountain river. However ... You can also think of me as immortal mountain river. There’s no problem with that.”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei was even more confused. Seeing this, the shadow smiled and explained,””In fact, I’m just a thought left behind by immortal mountain river. However, I also have the memories of the main body. If that’s the case ... Do you understand?”

Ever since Xia ruofei started cultivating, he had seen many things that were beyond his imagination. Hence, his mental endurance had also been greatly trained. Although he did not fully understand immortal Shanhe’s explanation, he still nodded and said,””I think I understand ... Senior mountain river, Hello!”

Immortal mountain river smiled and nodded, saying,””Young friend, congratulations on reaching the Aurous core stage. From this moment on, you’ve truly stepped onto the path of cultivation. It seems that the opportunity I left in China was not wasted ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be surprised. He had never reached the point where he would forget to eat and sleep in his cultivation. After obtaining the spirit map space, the first thing he thought of was to plant all kinds of vegetables, fruits, and rare medicinal herbs in the space ...

Of course, Xia ruofei had also caught some key information from immortal mountain river’s words. He quickly asked,””Senior mountain river, does this mean ... You’ve already left earth?”Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om
