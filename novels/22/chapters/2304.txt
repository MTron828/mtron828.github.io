This silver – haired old man was the master of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Ge Jun. He was not discouraged by Xia ruofei’s rejection of his request for a meeting. Instead, he was even more interested in Xia ruofei.

Ge Jun had a casual dinner in professor Chen’s office and decided to wait for him in the intensive care unit.

When Xia ruofei came out with Fang Liyun and her daughter, Ge Jun did not go up to disturb them. Instead, he waited for him to send Fang Liyun and Song Wei into the elevator and then return to the intensive care unit before he came over to talk to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei’s mind was filled with thoughts on how to investigate song Qiming’s sea of consciousness. He could not help but frown when he was suddenly blocked.

However, the silver – haired elder in front of him was an old man and his attitude was very polite. Xia ruofei did not want to be cold to him. He nodded slightly and said,””I’m Xia ruofei. Old Sir, is there anything I can help you with?”

Ge Jun had a kind smile on his face as he said,”Mr. Xia, let me introduce myself. I’m ge Jun, and I work in Chinese medicine in Beijing ...”

Xia ruofei immediately understood. This old man was the sage of Chinese medicine that professor Chen had mentioned, Ge Jun! Working in the field of Chinese medicine in Beijing ... This old man was quite low – Key. In Beijing, he provided health care services to the high – Level leaders and directors. He was definitely a national treasure – Level expert.

However, the old man was really persistent! He had already politely declined, but he still came here to intercept him ... Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel helpless.

He didn’t know why this Chinese medicine master was so interested in him, so he could only laugh and say,””So it’s Mr. GE, nice to meet you! Nice to meet you!”

“Hahaha! I’ll just call you little Xia, okay?” Ge Jun was very friendly.

What could Xia ruofei say?

He could only nod and say,”of course!” May I know what business old Mr. GE has with me?”

Ge Jun smiled and said,”little Xia, I accidentally saw your acupuncture technique this afternoon. It’s not simple! I’m just excited to see you ... So I took the liberty to come and find you, wanting to talk to you ...”

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said,”Mr. GE, you are a master of Chinese medicine. My lousy acupuncture techniques are not worthy of your attention. Moreover, one of my elders is still in the intensive care unit. I need to go in and take care of him. I really don’t have the extra energy. I’m sorry ...”

Ge Jun immediately said,”I’ll go in and take a look too?” Little Xia, I have some knowledge in the treatment of external injuries in traditional Chinese medicine. I might be able to help!”

Xia ruofei had a headache. He couldn’t get rid of her ...

However, the person in front of him was a highly respected Chinese medicine master and he had been very affable from the beginning to the end. As the saying goes, you don’t slap a smiling person. Xia ruofei couldn’t reject him forcefully and could only nod his head reluctantly.

Xia ruofei had wanted to use the night time to figure out how to investigate song Qiming’s sea of consciousness in a safer way. However, it seemed like he could not do that for the time being. He would have to send this old man away first.

Xia ruofei and Ge Jun successfully entered the intensive care unit.

When they arrived at song Qiming’s ward, professor Chen was on patrol with the doctor on duty. He was checking on song Qiming’s condition.

Professor Chen looked up and saw Ge Jun walking in with Xia ruofei. He immediately stood up and greeted them,””Uncle GE, why are you here?”

Xia ruofei looked at professor Chen, speechless.

Ge Jun chuckled and said,”I’ll accompany Xiao Xia to take a look!” Xiao Chen, is this the injured person? How’s his condition?”

Professor Chen’s face turned serious and he said,””Uncle GE, I’m afraid there’s nothing we can do ... I’ve just checked some of his reflexes. He’s still the same as a few hours ago. I’m afraid ... We can determine that he’s brain dead ...”

Professor Chen knew that it would hurt Xia ruofei’s self – esteem to say these words in front of him, but Ge Jun had asked him personally. Professor Chen could not open his eyes to speak due to his strict professionalism.

In professor Chen’s opinion, song Qiming’s condition was irreversible. The only reason he was still breathing and had a heart rate was because of equipment such as a ventilator. It was a waste of medical resources and had no other meaning.

To the patient, this was an inhumane torture. Although the patient could no longer feel it, that was the objective situation.

If Fang Liyun had heard professor Chen’s words, she would have fainted.

Xia ruofei had clearly said that song Qiming’s life was no longer in danger and that he was just unconscious. Why did professor Chen have a completely different conclusion?

Professor Chen was an expert in neurosurgery. Would his words be more convincing than Xia ruofei ‘s? Anyone who encountered such a situation would be nervous.

Ge Jun looked at Xia ruofei in surprise. Then, he looked at song Qiming who was lying on the bed and said,””Can I go over and take a look?”

His question was obviously directed at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei did not agree with professor Chen’s conclusion. Of course, he was not doubting professor Chen’s professionalism. It was just that if song Qiming’s condition was really related to his soul, professor Chen would not be able to tell the difference between this and brain death. Hence, Xia ruofei did not take professor Chen’s conclusion seriously.

At the same time, he didn’t think Ge Jun would be able to see anything. After all, this was no longer within the scope of traditional Chinese medicine.

Hence, Xia ruofei nodded and said,””Of course, no problem!”

Ge Jun nodded and sat down in front of the bed. Then, he placed his fingers on song Qiming’s wrist with great familiarity and closed his eyes. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

When the doctor on duty saw a Chinese medical doctor taking someone’s pulse in the ICU, she suddenly felt that it was ridiculous. However, this Chinese medical doctor was professor Chen’s elder. As an ordinary Doctor Who was many levels lower than professor Chen, she naturally did not dare to say anything and just watched quietly from the side.

After a long while, Ge Jun opened his eyes. He was not in a hurry to state his conclusion, but instead asked with interest, ” “Little Xia, what do you think? I think you have a different opinion about little Chen’s judgment, right? ”

Xia ruofei smiled and replied,” of course!” Otherwise, wouldn’t all that I’ve done be meaningless? Obviously, uncle song isn’t brain dead. I’m very sure.”

Professor Chen couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows. If Xia ruofei’s words were to spread, it would be a huge blow to him.

One must know that the announcement of death was a very strict and cautious thing. Even an ordinary person would need to go through a very strict procedure to announce his death, let alone a high-ranking officer like song Qiming.

It would be a huge mistake to judge a person who was not brain dead as brain dead. If the patient died after the catheter was removed, who would be responsible for that? Strictly speaking, the doctor Who made the conclusion was killing someone!

But before professor Chen could say anything, Ge Jun laughed and said, ” “I also agree with your conclusion!”

“Uncle GE!” Professor Chen was shocked. ” Uncle GE, you can’t say that ...” He said.

Ge Jun smiled and waved his hand, “Chen, don’t get too excited ... Xia and I judged it from a Chinese medicine point of view. The patient’s life force is very strong. If he wasn’t unconscious, he would be no different from a healthy person. I don’t think he’s brain dead ...”

As a Chinese medical Master, Ge Jun had seen countless cases, including brain death cases. Therefore, he could easily tell that song Qiming’s condition was different from all the brain death cases he had dealt with in the past.

After hearing Ge Jun’s words, Xia ruofei started to see him in a new light.

From a cultivator’s point of view, it was not hard to understand that the damage to the soul had caused the cultivator to fall into a coma. However, from a medical point of view, it was inevitable that he would come to a different conclusion like professor Chen. As a master of Chinese medicine, Ge Jun was indeed quite skilled to be able to discover the difference between song Qiming and a normal brain-dead patient in such a short time.

Professor Chen was speechless. It was not that he didn’t want to refute, but he had no way to refute the words that were very common in Chinese medicine, such as meridians, acupuncture points, yin and yang, vitality ... It was difficult to explain in Western medicine. This was also why Chinese medicine had been regarded as witch doctors for a long time.

Moreover, Ge Jun was professor Chen’s elder, so professor Chen could not argue with him like he usually did.

Ge Jun laughed and said to Xia ruofei, ” “Xia, if I’m not wrong, the purpose of your acupuncture was to lock his life, right? ”

Although he only saw the process of withdrawing the needle, with Ge Jun’s level of Chinese medicine, he could easily deduce the effect of the acupuncture.

Xia ruofei nodded. ” That’s roughly the case. We also hope that we can use acupuncture to stabilize the patient’s brain injury. ”

Professor Chen was speechless. Previously, Xia ruofei was the only one doing what he thought to be a futile effort. Now, even Ge Jun was on Xia ruofei’s side. It seemed like it was impossible to declare him brain dead according to the procedure.

” Uncle GE, Mr. Xia, you two can talk. I have to go to the next Ward! ” Professor Chen said after some thought.

Ge Jun waved his hand and said,” go quickly!” Don’t mind us ... I’ll chat with little Xia here for a while!”

“Alright!”

Professor Chen walked out with the doctor on duty and went to the next Ward.

Ge Jun, on the other hand, said with a hint of enthusiasm, ” Xia, your acupuncture technique is amazing. You can control such a serious injury. I’m ashamed of myself! ”

“You’re overpraising me,” Xia ruofei said in a neutral tone.

Ge Jun continued,”Xiao Xia, if I may ask, you ... The acupuncture technique you used this afternoon ... Was it the six cloud contact needles?”
