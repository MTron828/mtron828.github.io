Xia ruofei could not help but laugh.”Boss Feng, what kind of problem have you given the government?”

“The other requests are nothing much. Be it tax incentives or policy support, they’re all written in the document. The main thing I mentioned is ...” Feng Rao smiled.

Feng Jing slowed down and smiled.””In order to leave enough space for the company’s future development, we believe that it is imperative to build our own Park. In fact, in Sanshan, there are several companies of similar scale to our company, but their development potential is far less than ours. However, these few companies, big and small, have all applied for some land to build their own Park ...”

Xia ruofei understood immediately. He laughed and said,””It seems like you’re preparing to claim land! This was indeed an exorbitant price! The city government agreed so easily?”

“Yeah!” Feng Rao shrugged. I’m starting to think that I’m asking for too little. I should’ve asked for more land!”

“How much did you ask for?” Xia ruofei could not help but ask.

” 300 mu!” Feng Rao said with a smile.

“What? Three hundred mu?” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but cry out, attracting the attention of a few employees nearby. He lowered his voice and said,”President Feng, you’re really bold!”

“The city government is really brave to agree to this!” Feng Jing laughed.”Although it’s in the suburbs, it’s a good location for industrial land. 300 mu, without any discount!”

“What project are you planning to do with so much land?” Xia ruofei could not help but ask.

Although he didn’t care much about the secular industry now. However, the meaning of the Paradise Corporation was different to him. His feelings for the Paradise Corporation would not become indifferent just because his cultivation level was getting higher and higher.

However, this kind of feeling became purer and purer, and the factor of wealth became lower and lower.

Hence, Xia ruofei had to pay attention to Feng Jing’s big move.

Of course, Xia ruofei trusted Feng Jing. He didn’t think that Feng Jing would mess around or be rash. He only asked to understand the situation.

“A comprehensive Industrial Park, of course!” Feng Rao said with a smile. He had even thought of the name. It would be called paradise Industrial Park. At that time, other than the farm, the rest of the peach blossom company can basically be moved to the industrial park. The initial plan even includes the main pharmaceutical factory. ”

Although paradise pharmaceutical factory was a pharmaceutical factory, the products it produced were all pure – Natural Chinese medicine products. Even the dregs were used, so it would not cause any pollution. Moving to the industrial park would not have much of an impact. On the contrary, it would be more beneficial for paradise Corporation to integrate the industry.

Speaking of the industrial park, Feng Jing couldn’t help but exude a strong sense of confidence. She continued,””For the first phase, we’re planning to build the company’s headquarters building. In addition, we’re planning the Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory, Taoyuan health industry demonstration base, Taoyuan Internet Marketing Center, our own data center, and so on. In addition, we’ve also specially applied for a part of the land to build two residential buildings, hoping to completely solve the current housing problem for employees. ”

“Woof! This plan isn’t small!” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but sigh.”However, I support the construction of the employee residence!”

Feng Jing smiled.”Employees can apply for different types of housing according to the number of years they’ve been employed. In addition, employees who have served the company for a certain number of years can buy out the property rights of the house with money. The price will not be higher than 70% of the market price of the house in the same area when it was built. Of course, if the price of the house dropped, it would be calculated at 70% of the actual market price! We’re still working on the specific details, and we’ll report it to you when it’s more mature!”

Xia ruofei nodded in satisfaction and said,””Not bad! This is in line with our paradise corporation’s corporate culture. I’ve said long ago that I must do my best so that my employees don’t have any worries. In the future, we’ll even build our own kindergarten for the children of our employees. The company will also have to step in and coordinate with them to solve the problems of primary and junior high school admission!”

Dong Yun couldn’t help but smile and said,”Chairman, your thoughts and CEO Feng’s are really the same! This year, some of the employees ‘children needed to be admitted to the nursing home, and some people raised some of their practical difficulties on the intranet. President Feng gave me this task and asked me to coordinate and solve it. I’ve been working at the City’s education Bureau recently. Director Feng said that if the Department of Education can’t handle it, she’ll personally go to the municipal Party Committee and the city government to ask for help!”

“Of course!” Feng Jing’s face reddened.”Of course we have to carry out the Chairman’s ideas!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”alright, back to the main topic.” President Feng, you’re doing such a big project. You must have spent a lot of money, right?”

“Yes!” Feng Jing nodded and said,”the total investment for this project is about five billion!”

“Woof! That’s not a small amount!” Xia ruofei exclaimed.

Feng Rao could not help but glance at Xia ruofei and said,””Chairman, I’m talking about total investment. The first phase of construction naturally did not need that much money! I estimate that 2 billion is the maximum. Moreover, our company’s cash flow has always been very abundant, and our debt situation is extremely healthy. In addition, the construction funds are not paid in a one – time payment, but are paid in proportion to the progress of the project. This way, the initial investment is even less! Even if I don’t have enough money, I’m confident that I can raise it in a short time! At most, it would just be a loan! Now, the banks are begging us to take a loan!”
