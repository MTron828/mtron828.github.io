3604 The farm's predicament_1

Xia ruofei stared at Daphne and asked,&quot; &quot;He wasn't injured by accident. He was beaten by someone, right?&quot;¬†

Daphne didn't say anything, but Xia ruofei got the answer from her expression.

No wonder the atmosphere at Paradise Farm was so tense, and there were even armed security guards at the entrance.

&quot;What's wrong?&quot; Xia ruofei asked anxiously,&quot;Daphne, tell me first. Is Liang Qichao in danger? &quot;

Xia ruofei did not care about the properties. Even if Paradise Farm was destroyed, Xia ruofei would not be heartbroken. However, Liang Qichao was his friend, and he had only come to work at Paradise Farm after listening to his suggestion. If anything were to happen to him, he would not be able to explain it to Liang Qichao's parents.

&quot;There's no danger to his life!&quot; &quot;But he's seriously injured. The doctor said that there's a possibility that he'll be disabled...&quot;

Xia ruofei heaved a sigh of relief. It was fine as long as he was still alive. As for what the doctor said about the possibility of disability, with the petals of the spirit Heart Flower, there were no external injuries that could not be treated.

For a situation where he had just been injured, unless it was an extreme situation, he could use the petals of the spirit Heart Flower to heal it.

Xia ruofei nodded and asked calmly,&quot; &quot;Then tell me, what happened? how did Liang Qichao get injured?&quot;

&quot;Someone has their eyes on Paradise Farm.&quot; &quot;This person is very powerful in Australia,&quot; said Daphne.&quot;Qi Chao is unwilling to compromise and said that this is a business that Mr. Tang and you handed over to him to manage. He can't back down at all.&quot; As a result, Paradise Farm was constantly suppressed in Australia. In the beginning, it was the inspection of the Agriculture Department and the Environmental Protection Department that made things difficult. Later, except for Mr. Tang Yitian's chain stores, all other channels refused to accept Paradise Farm's products. Qi Chao gritted his teeth and persisted, refusing to compromise. Three days ago, Qi Chao was attacked on his way to Sydney. His car was destroyed, and he was seriously injured. He had multiple fractures, and his leg was the most seriously injured. Although he had three operations in the past few days, the doctor said that he should be mentally prepared. If the infection can't be controlled, he might need to amputate .. &quot;

As she said this, her eyes turned red.

She had also just rushed back from the hospital to Xuanji Paradise Farm, which was in a precarious situation. Liang Qichao was seriously injured and hospitalized. As the deputy manager of Paradise Farm, she had to come back to take charge of the overall situation.

Before Liang Qichao's incident, Paradise Farm had already strengthened their security. In fact, a week or two ago, the other party had already been playing some small tricks. The farm was so big, and the boundaries were usually just simple fences, so it wasn't difficult to sneak into the farm. There had been several theft cases these days, and there had even been people shooting the farm's horses from afar. There was no response after calling the police. Therefore, Liang Qichao had hired a security team from Europe to install a large number of surveillance cameras around the farm, and at the same time, strengthen the patrol.¬†

Daphne was physically and mentally exhausted. She wanted to stay by Liang Qichao's side, but she had to return to the farm to deal with all the troublesome matters.

After Xia ruofei heard this, he could not help but frown and asked,&quot; &quot;You didn't ask Mr. Tang Yitian for help?&quot;¬†

Tang Yitian had a great influence in Sydney and even in the whole of Australia, especially in the Chinese society. He was a well- deserved leading figure. In terms of assets, Tang Yitian could be considered one of the richest people in Australia. Moreover, the chain stores were all companies with heavy assets. At the same time, their cash flow was also very abundant. In terms of absolute wealth, Tang Yitian could be said to be one of the richest people in Australia.

Liang Qichao had Tang Yitian's contact information. In fact, Tang Yitian's support for Paradise Farm was very strong. His chain stores provided very good shelf positions for Paradise Farm's products, and the Commission was the lowest in the industry. The payment was also very timely, and there was basically no delay.

Xia ruofei had also told Liang Qichao that he could ask Tang Yitian for help if he had any difficult problems.

With his relationship with Tang Yitian, the latter would definitely treat Paradise Farm as his own business and be very concerned about it.

Xia ruofei had just met with Tang Yitian, but he didn't mention this at all. This meant that Paradise Farm didn't ask him for help, so Tang Yitian didn't know about it.

After hearing Xia ruofei's words, Tang Haoran couldn't help but say,&quot; &quot;Yup! These people are so bad, let my father punish them!&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Daphne shook her head and said,&quot;I suggested it to Qi Chao, but he refused.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; Xia ruofei was confused.

&quot;Qi Chao said that the enemy this time is too troublesome and he doesn't want to cause trouble for Mr. Tang.&quot; Daphne smiled bitterly.&quot;He always felt that the other party could at most use commercial and administrative means to suppress Paradise Farm. As long as he didn't compromise, he could grit his teeth and get through it! The truth has proven that he was too naive. The other party's lower limit is much lower than he imagined! &quot;
