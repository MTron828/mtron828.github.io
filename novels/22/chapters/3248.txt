3249 A free lunch?_

Xia ruofei beckoned to Elon Musk, and the two of them left the room together.

They came to the room next door, which was still filled with the smell of Chinese medicine. Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Mr. Masker, regarding the spacesuits, I hope that some work can be started as soon as possible. You know ... All the preparation work needs time, and our ... Our project needs time the most, so ...”

After a moment of silence, elonmask said,””No problem! I can arrange it in advance, but ... We don’t have enough funds. One thing is for sure, we can’t support the production of all the EVA suits, so ...”

“The funds that Mr. Li promised will be transferred to your account within two days!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,” 600 million US dollars in advance. Not a single cent less!”

“Then there’s no problem!” Said Elon Musk. I’ll make the arrangements today. ”

“Please!” Xia ruofei said.

“I’ll leave little X to you, Mr. Xia!” Elonmask said. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Don’t worry, I’m not just treating this as a business deal!” Xia ruofei smiled.”Because I’m also a doctor!”

“Thank you,” said elonmask sincerely.

……

In the next few days, although Elon Musk did not leave the mansion, he kept in touch with the outside world.

One part of it was to remotely handle the work of several companies under his name, especially SpaceX.

The other part of the energy was mainly to contact the production of spacesuits and oxygen supply modules.

It was not an easy task to erase all traces of this matter. However, Elon Musk had his own channels, and he had a deep understanding of the industry, so he could still do it with some cautious operations.

The 600 million US dollars that Li Yifu had promised was transferred to an offshore account provided by Elon Musk the next day, just as Xia ruofei had said.

The money in this account went through a few twists and turns before it was transferred to a small company in Houston.

Xia ruofei did not care about the details of the operation. Besides, other than the first day when he took the initiative to talk to Elon Musk about this, he did not mention anything else after that. He was only focused on treating little X.

Xia ruofei completed the acupuncture every day meticulously and provided the Chinese medicine on time. Grams also attached great importance to Xia ruofei’s medical advice. Every time, he would personally feed the child Chinese medicine and not let the nurse do it.

Mannu and his medical team also stayed in the mansion, but they did not appear once. They spent most of their time in an auxiliary building of the mansion.

Three days later, at Xia ruofei’s suggestion, Elon Musk asked Mannu’s team to conduct another inspection of little X.

The results of the examination dispelled Mannu’s last bit of hope. The tumor on little X’s body had shrunk significantly, and all the indicators showed that it was developing in a good direction compared to a few days ago.

Although Mannu was very reluctant, he had no choice but to truthfully report the situation of the inspection to elonmask.

In fact, when Mannu’s team was checking on little X, elonmask was in another room on the second floor, accompanying Xia ruofei to wait for the results.

Unlike Xia ruofei’s carefree attitude, Elon Musk seemed to be a little worried.

Even though little X’s complexion had improved significantly, and even if he didn’t know medicine, he could tell that his condition was getting better. However, Elon Musk had always only believed in scientific data. The education he had received since he was young had made him more confident in the data found by Western medical equipment.

Naturally, Elon Musk hoped that the result would be good, but at the same time, he was worried that the fire of hope that had been ignited with great difficulty would be ruthlessly extinguished by reality.

Therefore, he was a little restless until someone knocked on the door.

“Come in!” Elon Musk stood up from the sofa and stared at the door nervously.

Mannu, who was wearing a white coat, pushed the door open and walked in with a complicated expression. He was holding a folder in his hand, which contained all kinds of test data, including some blood test sheets and various scans.

“Dr. Mannu, what are the results?” “What’s wrong?” Elon Mask asked impatiently.

Mannu couldn’t help but look at Xia ruofei, and then said,””Mr. Masker, congratulations! The tumor has shrunk significantly. The blood indicators and x – ray examination results also show that the condition has improved to a large extent. ”

Elon Musk snatched the folder from Mannu’s hands. After flipping through a few pages, he remembered that he could not understand these examination reports at all.

Thus, he said somewhat awkwardly,””Dr. Mannu, please explain the examination report to me in detail!”

Naturally, Mannu did not want to say too much, especially in front of Xia ruofei. That would be like slapping his own face!

However, Elon Musk was his boss, and the salary he received every month was enough to make his life much more decent than most doctors, so he could not refuse Elon Musk’s request.

Therefore, Mannu still held the folder and explained to Elon Musk one by one. He also found the results of the last examination on the other side of the folder and compared them with the data of the key indicators. He also tried to explain to Elon Musk what the changes in these indicators meant in common language.
