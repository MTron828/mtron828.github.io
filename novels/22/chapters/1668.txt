Chapter 1669: A miraculous landing (2)

At this point, Brook had a very strange feeling.

“Understood!” Xia ruofei nodded.

“Also, Saipan airport only has one runway suitable for a large jet to land.” Brook said,”we’re about to land in the opposite direction, which is runway 25. This runway is 2652 meters long. It’s a short runway for the Airbus 350, so ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”that’s why you have to be decisive when you land. The landing point should be as forward as possible. If the plane is flat and misses the landing point, you have to push the gas pedal to the TOGA position and fly back!” I’ve remembered everything you’ve just said!”

Brook nodded.”Don’t be nervous when you’re operating it. I’ll guide you throughout the process!”

At this point, Brook looked at the meter and said,””It’s higher than the slide! Reduce the thrust a little ...”

A downward slide referred to the flight path of the aircraft relative to the ground when the aircraft was approaching and landing. The closer the aircraft was to the runway entrance, the lower its altitude would be. This flight path was called a downward slide. As an experienced captain, even without the assistance of electronic equipment, Brook could quickly judge the state of the plane.

Xia ruofei immediately made the necessary adjustments.

The plane’s altitude was getting lower and lower. At this time, ta Tai’s voice came through the headset.”QF108, runway 25 is ready for landing. Fire engines and ambulances are all in place!”

“QF108 received.” Brook said,”if the landing doesn’t go well, we hope to maintain the course, raise the altitude, and fly again!”

“QF108, agreed! Return flight height of 3000 feet!” Tatai immediately replied. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Understood. Take off at 3000 feet, QF108!” Brook said.

After ending the last call with Tatai, Brook turned to Xia ruofei and said,””Xia, relax. Just treat it as a flying simulation game!”

Xia ruofei was not nervous at all because he was fully focused on controlling the plane.

As the altitude dropped, the airflow became more and more chaotic, which caused a lot of trouble for the hand – controlled aircraft.

Xia ruofei had to adjust the plane’s attitude at all times.

Of course, there was an advantage to manual operation from the beginning. After more than an hour of actual combat practice, Xia ruofei had some experience in operating the plane. This was undoubtedly helpful for the more complicated landing operations.

Due to the hole in the cockpit, the sound of the engine was louder than usual. Brook’s breathing was getting heavier and heavier, and he was quite nervous.

“I can see the track!” Brook looked ahead and shouted,”Xia, the plane’s position is not bad now. Keep it up! Remember, after entering the runway, you have to pull the lever slightly to set the plane in a landing position!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said.

His left hand clenched the control stick, constantly making fine adjustments, while his right hand was on the gas pedal.

Brook observed the situation outside the cabin and looked at the flight meter from time to time, constantly reminding Xia ruofei.

“The speed is too high, lower the thrust a little!”

“The course has deviated to the left. Adjust it a little ...”

“There are too many adjustments. Don’t make too big of a move!”

As the altitude continued to drop, the demand for precision in the control of the aircraft became higher. Even though Xia ruofei’s learning ability was far better than ordinary people, he still felt that it was more difficult now.

The plane was like a naughty child, sometimes left and sometimes right, sometimes fast and sometimes slow, just like a drunkard ... The runway in front of him was also sometimes left and sometimes right.

Brook sighed in his heart and said to himself,””This definitely won’t work!”

He quickly calculated the amount of gas and said to Xia ruofei,””Xia, don’t be in a hurry to land on our first try. Follow the landing procedure I just taught you and simulate it at an altitude of about three hundred feet. Pay attention to control the plane to aim at the runway!”

Xia ruofei’s forehead was already covered in sweat. He nodded and said,””That’s good, but I don’t have much confidence now ...”

Brook nodded and immediately said to Tatai,”QF108, request for a low – altitude pass!”

Tatai also understood the situation on the plane and immediately replied,””I agree!”

600 feet.

500 feet.

400 feet.

The plane’s altitude was getting lower and lower, and its speed was also slowly decreasing.

However, Xia ruofei was still unable to control the plane perfectly. With the same range of operation, the closer the plane got to the runway, the greater the deviation. He kept adjusting and adjusting, but in the end, the plane still deviated from the runway.

“Okay, let’s say the runway is right below us, 50 feet away,” Brook said. Forty feet! Thirty feet! Start pulling the lever slightly and lowering the thrust!”

Xia ruofei operated the plane according to Brook’s instructions. The nose of the plane slowly rose, showing the posture of landing.

Brook didn’t dare to take too much risk with such an unconventional operation. After achieving the effect, he immediately said,”Now increase the thrust and pull up the altitude! Let’s go back!”

In fact, the plane was already ten to twenty meters off the runway. At this altitude, the only option was to go around.

Xia ruofei carried out Brook’s order without hesitation. The plane was about 300 feet above the runway. It whistled loudly and started to climb.

The staff in the control tower watched as the huge passenger plane took off again. They couldn’t help but show worried expressions. This situation was unprecedented in the history of aerospace. Could they really succeed?
