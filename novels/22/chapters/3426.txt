Chapter 3427: Danger in the garden (1)

Translator: 549690339

A trace of blood seeped out from the corner of the high – Level astral beast’s mouth. It was obvious that Xia ruofei’s heavy punch had caused quite a bit of damage to it.

Of course, Xia ruofei knew very well that in a situation where he was barehanded, it would be difficult to cause fatal damage to the opponent with his full strength, even if the opponent was an intermediate Star Beast, let alone a high – Level Star Beast.

Hence, Xia ruofei immediately retreated after his first attack. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

As expected, the high – Level astral beast’s anger rose by a large amount. It raised its head and let out a crazy roar. Then, it did not hold back at all. It displayed its speed to the extreme. Its body turned into an afterimage as it pounced towards Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei’s spirit was highly concentrated, and he also displayed his agility to the extreme. He dodged the high – Level astral beast’s fierce attacks with all his might, and at the same time, he controlled the two flying swords to launch sneak attacks on it.

Although the defense of a high – Level Star Beast was strong, it couldn’t withstand the flying sword’s attack on the same part again and again.

Xia ruofei’s control was very precise. The qushuang flying sword and the traveling Jade immortal sword took turns to attack. Soon, a wound on its back was cut open, and blood spurted out.

Xia ruofei was very clear that the defense and recovery speed of a high – Level Star Beast were quite astonishing. Thus, he didn’t give his opponent any chance to catch his breath. He jumped up and dodged the attack of the high – Level Star Beast. At the same time, the qushuang flying sword and the blue immortal sword once again slashed at the wound.

Immediately, the wound became even bigger. After breaking through the hard scales, although the muscles and bones of high level star beasts were also very tough, their defense was clearly not as good as the scales.

It was not that the high – Level Star Beast did not want to Dodge, but the speed of the qushuang flying sword and the blue immortal sword were extremely fast and the attack angles were very strange. Besides, Xia ruofei’s timing was very precise. Every time, the high – Level Star Beast was exhausted and had yet to recover. At this time, the Star Beast’s body would stiffen. Although it was very short, Xia ruofei could grasp it with his sharp senses and repeatedly attacked the same place with the qushuang flying sword and the blue immortal sword.

Such a precise attack made the high – Level Star Beast suffer.

The wound on its back was already very big. Not only was it bleeding non – stop, but it was also affecting its movement.

Besides, Xia ruofei was too slippery. The high – Level astral beast’s attacks almost all landed on empty space. There were one or two times when it seemed that it couldn’t avoid it, but Xia ruofei suddenly disappeared strangely. Then, he would appear behind it and continue to attack its wounds with his heavy fists.

Xia ruofei naturally made use of the spirit map space, which was a bit of cheating. If he really couldn’t avoid the attack, he would hide in the spirit map space and use the difference in the flow of time to accurately find the weakest point of the high – Level Star beast’s defense and then flash out. Not only did the high – Level astral beast’s attack miss, but its injuries were also worsening.

The high – Level astral beast was naturally shocked and angry, and it kept letting out furious roars.

Xia ruofei fought with the high – Level astral beast for more than ten minutes and decided to use the formation.

The reason was simple. He had already verified that his strength was enough to deal with a high – Level astral beast. If he had just entered the second level of the Tower of Trials, his reaction speed would not have been able to keep up. It would have been difficult to Dodge the attacks of high – Level astral beasts. It was the same for the attacks. With Xia ruofei’s strength at that time, he could not break through the defense of high – Level astral beasts.

But now, if he stuck to his current strategy, he would have a chance to grind the high – Level Star Beast to death.

Of course, unless the high – Level astral beast suddenly went berserk and activated 120% of its potential.

No matter what the situation was, Xia ruofei would have to spend a lot of effort and there would be a certain amount of danger. Now that he was still doing the mission on the seventh level of the trial Pagoda, he naturally did not want to cause any more trouble. So after dealing with the high – Level astral beast for a while, he decisively chose a more stable method.

He retreated as he fought, slowly moving in the direction of the trap and kill array.

The high – Level astral beast had already lost its mind. It did not expect Xia ruofei to have a hidden killing move, so it pressed on step by step.

Very quickly, Xia ruofei retreated into the range of the formation. The high – Level astral beast did not realize that it had caught up to him.

Xia ruofei’s figure flashed and dodged the attack of the high – Level Star Beast. Then, he made a hand seal and the trap and kill array was activated.

The high – Level astral beast lost its target all of a sudden. While it was still in a daze, the sharp black light had already descended from the sky.

What happened next was simple. Although the high – Level astral beast’s impact could cause some damage to the trap & kill array, Xia ruofei’s strength was no longer the same as before. Hence, he did not simply stay outside the array to control it. Instead, when he launched the attack, he hid inside the array and controlled the two flying swords to attack the high – Level astral beast.

The high – Level Star Beast was distracted by one thing, and the black light kept falling on its body. The qushuang flying sword and the blue immortal sword also cut the wounds on its body again and again.

After a while, blazing flames appeared in the wound.

The high – Level astral beast let out a miserable howl.

Xia ruofei calmly controlled the attacks of the array. More and more black rays landed on the high – Level astral beast.

After a while, the high – Level Star Beast turned into a ball of fire and rolled on the ground.

Soon, its howls gradually weakened, and then there was no sound..
