2491 Sneaking back to the sect (2)

“I know.” Liu chengfeng replied respectfully,”I had an epiphany after returning to my hometown. I only broke through after 20 days of closed – door cultivation!”

Xia ruofei nodded in satisfaction and said,””Now that you’re a Qi level 8 cultivator, you’ll probably be put in an important position when you return to the sect. You have to seize this opportunity. Only when your position in the sect is high will you be able to help me in the future!”

“Understood!” “Yes!” Liu chengfeng replied,”as long as master gives the order, I will go through fire and water without hesitation!”

“Of course I don’t doubt your loyalty!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Then, he took out a bag from the spirit map space and handed it to Liu chengfeng.””This is for you! There’s a cell phone inside that’s used to contact us. In addition, there’s a spirit crystal and some cash. The spirit crystal can support your daily cultivation expenses, but you must remember to avoid people’s eyes and ears. Once they find out that you have a spirit crystal, you’ll definitely cause trouble!”

Although Xia ruofei and Liu chengfeng could sense each other’s location from a long distance due to the soul seal, and Xia ruofei could even communicate telepathically with Liu chengfeng, if the distance was too far, the sense would become more or less blurry, and it would be much more convenient with a mobile phone.

As for spiritual crystals, Xia ruofei no longer needed them. Song Wei and Ling Qingxue would definitely use higher quality origin crystals for cultivation. Hence, he did not mind giving one to Liu chengfeng.

In Xia ruofei’s eyes, the value of spiritual crystals had been greatly reduced, but in Liu chengfeng’s eyes, they were priceless treasures.

After he heard Xia ruofei’s words, his hands couldn’t help but shake. He said in a trembling voice,””Master ... Thank you! This subordinate will definitely work hard to cultivate and strive to raise my cultivation to the next level so that I can serve master better in the future!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”go!” We’re in Sanshan city right now. If you go straight along this road, you’ll be able to get a taxi at the intersection. You can go directly to the airport!”

“Yes!” Liu chengfeng said.

Then, he knelt down in front of Xia ruofei and kowtowed a few times.””Master, this subordinate will take his leave!”

“En!”

“Master, take care!”

After Liu chengfeng finished speaking, he opened the door and jumped out of the Knight XV SUV.

After he closed the door, he bowed slightly to Xia ruofei and turned around to walk towards the intersection.

Xia ruofei looked at Liu chengfeng’s back with a complicated expression.

He had finally planted a nail in the modern cultivation world, but he did not want to use this nail one day.

If the people in the world of cultivators did not provoke him, he would not go against them for no reason.

After all, due to the poor cultivation environment on earth, the number of cultivators was decreasing. As a fellow cultivator, Xia ruofei did not want to fight with his family.

However, a rational voice was telling him,”That was just an unrealistic wish of his. The world of cultivation had always been the survival of the fittest. Sooner or later, he would have to cross paths with those cultivators, and it was likely that a conflict would break out.

After all, an ordinary man’s possession of a Jade was a crime. If even a little of Xia ruofei’s cultivation resources were leaked, the cultivators would probably gather like sharks that smelled blood.

Xia ruofei sat in the car and watched Liu chengfeng flag down a taxi at a distant intersection. Soon, the car disappeared from his sight.

Only then did he start the car, drive to the intersection, make a turn, and drive towards the headquarters of the peach blossom company in the city.

After returning to the company, Xia ruofei took the private elevator to the top floor.

It was he Yu’s turn to be on duty today. She was sitting at the work desk next to the chairman’s office door, typing materials on the computer. Seeing Xia ruofei come in, he Yu quickly put down her work and stood up to greet Xia ruofei with a slight bow.

Xia ruofei nodded and asked,”do you have any important things to do today?”

He Yu didn’t even need to flip through the notebook and directly said,”Chairman, I don’t have any special schedule today, but President Dong called a few minutes ago to report to you. She didn’t come because she heard that you weren’t in the company.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”President Dong is back from Qiantang?” Then give her a call! Tell her I’m back at the company. ”

“Yes, Chairman!” He Yu replied.

Xia ruofei pushed open the door and walked into his super – Large office, which was exclusive to the chairman.

He Yu picked up the phone and dialed an internal short number. After receiving the notification, she said with a trace of respect,”Hello, President Dong. I’m he Yu. The chairman has returned to his office. He said that if you need to report to him, you can come over at any time!”

“Thank you he Yu, I’ll head over now!” Dong Yun said from the other end of the phone.

After informing Dong Yun, he Yu knocked on the door and entered Xia ruofei’s office. She reported to Xia ruofei that Dong Yun was coming over.

Xia ruofei nodded.”Yes. Just let her in when President Dong is here. There’s no need to inform her.”

“Understood!” He Yu replied. She filled Xia ruofei’s glass with hot water and left the office.

After a while, Xia ruofei heard a knock on the door.

“Please enter!” Xia ruofei said loudly.

The office door opened, and he Yu stood at the door and made a gesture of invitation. Dong Yun nodded slightly to he Yu to thank her and then walked in.

“Chairman!” Dong Yun greeted Xia ruofei with a slight bow.

Xia ruofei laughed and pointed at the chair in front of his desk.”President Dong, please sit!”

After Dong Yun sat down, Xia ruofei asked with a smile,””Has everything been arranged at the money pond?”

Dong Yun came here to report the situation of the pharmaceutical Group, so she immediately said,””It’s all been arranged. I left half of the team members at Qian Tang. We’ll split into two groups and take turns to go to Spain for a vacation.”

“Do you have enough manpower?” Xia ruofei asked,”do you need the headquarters to send some people over?”

“No need, Chairman!” Dong Yun said,”the pharmaceutical Group has not started production yet. The next stage of work is mainly the installation and debugging of the production line, as well as the screening and training of the personnel. Half of the staff is enough, so I brought the other half back to San Shan this time. I’m just waiting for you to fulfill your promise!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”sure!” However, if there’s a shortage of manpower, you can’t force yourself. There’s still a lot of manpower in the headquarters, so it’s definitely not a problem to send a few people over!”

“I’ll ask the Chairman if I need anything,”said Dong Yun with a nod.

“Yanan’s side has already registered everyone’s passport information for this trip to Spain. A few employees who don’t have a passport have also gone to apply for one in the past few days. I wanted to ask you if we should contact a few travel agencies in advance to compare the price or something?”

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”Not for now. You guys stay put and wait for my news!”

“Yes, Chairman!” Dong Yun said.

Following this, Dong Yun began to report on her work at the Qian Tang over the past few days, as well as her plans for the future. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Although Xia ruofei didn’t want to care about the details, he could only sit in his seat and listen to Dong Yun’s serious report.

Just then, Xia ruofei’s phone rang. Dong Yun, who was reporting, immediately shut her mouth.

Xia ruofei gestured for Dong Yun to take a seat and not to leave. He glanced at the caller ID on the screen.

The call was from Zhou leiyun. The moment the call connected, he chuckled and said,””President Xia, are you in the office?”

“I just arrived at the office.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”director Zhou, you look so happy. You must have good news!”

“Hahaha!” Zhou leiyun did not hide his happiness at all.”CEO Xia, you can just go on Weibo! It’s currently being broadcast live!”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei was overjoyed. He quickly asked,””You’re announcing it already?”
