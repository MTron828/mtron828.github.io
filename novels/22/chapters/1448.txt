Chapter 1449: New Year’s Eve_1

Translator: 549690339

Swallow meat was a specialty of the three mountains. The pork legs and lean meat were beaten into minced meat, mixed with sweet potato powder, rolled into paper – thin pieces, and cut into three – inch pieces. The meat was wrapped in them and made into flat food. It was cooked to be served with soup.

Because the skin and filling of the swallow were all made from pork, it was jokingly called “meat – wrapped meat.”

The meat swallow was also known as the Taiping swallow. During the three mountains ‘festivals, weddings, funerals, and farewells, they had to eat the “Taiping swallow”, which represented the auspicious meaning of “peace” and “peace”. Therefore,”no feast without a swallow, no adulthood” was said.

The people who were celebrating the New Year with them were all from the three mountains, so they naturally had Taiping Yans for the New Year’s Eve dinner.

Xia ruofei and Ling Xiaotian immediately washed their hands and walked to the dining table.

Lin Qiao had already brought over a pot of minced meat and a bag of swallow skin.

Ling Xiaotian was also an expert, and after weighing it in his hand, he couldn’t help but praise,””The quality of this swallow skin is very high!”

Lin Qiao said proudly,”my mom bought some good pork hind legs and peeled the swallow skin herself!” It’s much better than the ones you bought outside!”

The traditional process of making swallow’s skin was very complicated and time – consuming. Most people would not make their own swallow’s skin because there were many swallow meat shops in San Shan that could be bought at any time. Those who were more particular would just choose the better ones. For example, a century – old shop like the swallow meat could be said to have very few that made their own skin.

Ling Ji restaurant also made swallow’s skin and sold it to customers. Thus, Ling Xiaotian was also very proficient in making swallow’s skin.

When he heard this, he couldn’t help but say in surprise,””I didn’t expect the in – laws to have such a unique skill! Nowadays, there aren’t many people who know how to make swallow skins ...”

Hu ‘Zi’s mother heard this from the kitchen and laughed as she stuck her head out.”I learned a little from the elders in my family when I was young, but in front of experts like my in – laws, I’m just trying to show off in front of an expert!”

“No, no, no!” Ling Xiaotian said,”this is not any worse than what our shop’s chef makes!”

“In – Law, you really know how to talk!” Hu ‘Zi’s mother said happily,”then you have to eat more later!”

“Definitely, definitely!” Ling Xiaotian chuckled as he agreed.

In the kitchen, Hu Zi’s mother and Ling Qingxue were busy preparing the New Year’s Eve dinner. Meanwhile, Xia ruofei, Ling Xiaotian, and Lin Qiao were chatting in the dining room while making swallow meat. The atmosphere was joyous and harmonious.

The afternoon passed by quickly. At FiveO’ clock in the evening, the carefully prepared New Year’s Eve dinner was finally almost done.

Other than the last main dish left for Ling Xiaotian to cook, only the swallow meat had not been put into the pot.

The seasoning of the swallow meat was done in advance. It only needed to be boiled in the pot and a little seasoning before it could be eaten. The time taken was also very short. Thus, Ling Xiaotian began to put on his apron and prepared to personally handle the last dish.

He naturally left the steamed kun fish for Ling Xiaotian.

He “chased” Ling Qingxue and Hu Zi’s mother, who wanted to stay behind to help, out of the kitchen, then began to skillfully handle the Chinese perch.

The steamed Chinese perch was the specialty of Su Yu, the executive chef of the Ling Ji F & B group.

During this period of time, the Chinese perch had already been served to the Ling’s private kitchen. Ling Xiaotian’s cooking skills were exceptional, and in addition to the pavilion closest to the water enjoying the moonlight first, he was already very familiar with the cooking of this dish.

Soon, he finished processing the fish, added some seasoning on a plate, and then put it in the steamer.

While waiting, Ling Xiaotian started to cook the swallow meat.

There was no technique to cook swallow meat. One just had to put the swallow meat into water and boil it, then add an appropriate amount of seasoning.

However, even when Ling Xiaotian was cutting the green onions, his technique seemed to have a sense of rhythm. This was not an intentional show of skill, but a subconscious rhythm that a chef would subconsciously integrate.

Xia ruofei, who was watching from the side, couldn’t help but give him a thumbs up.

Not long after the swallow meat was cooked, the timer sent out a reminder that the steamed kun fish was also ready.

Ling Xiaotian personally carried the Chinese perch while Xia ruofei carried a plate of swallow meat to the dining room.

“Time for the New Year’s Eve dinner!” Lin Qiao shouted happily.

“I don’t think they set off firecrackers yet!” Lin Qiao added.

“You can’t set off firecrackers here!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Although there was no prohibition of fireworks in Sanshan, the control was relatively strict. For a new community like Daguan world, it was certainly not allowed to set off fireworks.

“If we don’t set off firecrackers, it’ll be less festive!” Lin Qiao said in distress.

Lin Qiao grew up in a fishing village. Every New Year, the village was filled with the sound of firecrackers. She would often follow her brother to pick up unlit firecrackers and set them off all over the village.

Xia ruofei rolled his eyes and said,””I have an idea!”

Then, he turned on the TV and stereo system. Xia ruofei had personally installed all the electrical appliances here. The TV came with an internet box. Xia ruofei quickly found the sound of firecrackers in the box and turned up the volume. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

A burst of crackling firecrackers came from the sound system. The high – end subwoofer cannon made the firecrackers sound quite shocking, but it lacked the smell of smoke.

“This works too?” Lin Qiao laughed and said,”I guess you can say that I let him go. Let’s eat, let’s eat!”

The two families sat around the dining table.

Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao started to pour wine for everyone. Ling Xiaotian and Xia ruofei were naturally drinking the Drunken Eight Immortals. Furthermore, it was not the kind that was sold in bulk by the winery, but the kind that Xia ruofei had stored in the medium.
