2368 Searching for Satan (1)

Boa constrictor didn’t hesitate to answer Xia ruofei’s question. However, his answer still disappointed Xia ruofei.

“The dark shadow team is in charge of the assassination,” said Boak.”I don’t know the details of the operation and the client’s information. You’ll have to ask Bason!”

Even though Xia ruofei had a premonition before he asked the question, he still felt a little disappointed after hearing the answer.

“Do you have any information on the Satan’s palm?” Xia ruofei continued to ask.

“Of course!” “Boss is the leader of the organization. He knows everything about the organization,” said Boak without hesitation.

Hearing this, Xia ruofei felt a little more relaxed. His next target was Satan, the leader of the modr organization, who had been hiding very well.

As long as Satan knew who the mastermind behind the assassination of song Qiming was, Xia ruofei was confident that he could get the information from him.

After asking the questions, Xia ruofei did not waste any more time with Boak. With a thought, he threw the still – hypnotized Boak into the spirit map and locked him in the space cage again.

One could imagine how much trauma he would have after he regained his consciousness, especially when he saw that he had returned to that strange and terrifying cage.

Naturally, Xia ruofei did not care about Boak’s feelings. If it was torture, then it was not too much for Boak who had just been locked up for a while. After all, he had just been locked up, while the instructors and mercenaries in the training camp in Basoko town had been locked up in the space cage since 2 or 3 am.

Besides, Xia ruofei had just improved the structure of the spatial cage. Now, everyone who was caught would be locked in a small spatial cage. This spatial cage could only accommodate one person.

He would probably go crazy if he was locked up alone in a confined space with nothing but monotonous gray and white around him.

Xia ruofei did not have the time to care about these captives. Besides, he could use this opportunity to give them an unforgettable memory so that they would not dare to resist in the future.

After locking Boak the Viper back into the space cage, Xia ruofei did not waste any more time. He left the woods like a flash of lightning and returned to the pickup truck. He quickly started the car and continued on the road.

This time, Xia ruofei’s destination was arulei city, the capital of arulei.

The famous leader of the modr organization, the mysterious Satan, was hiding in the most prosperous city of arulei.

Although the “most prosperous” might not even be as prosperous as a Prefecture – Level city in China, Satan’s actions had a sense of “the big is hidden in the city”. Xia ruofei was even more amazed after knowing Satan’s hidden identity ...

It was around seven or eight in the morning when Xia ruofei arrived at Zaha city, where boa constrictor was located, from the town of Basoko.

The process of killing Boak was very smooth and did not take much time. It was only around 9 am.

Xia ruofei drove the pickup truck North.

From a geographical point of view, Basoko town was roughly between arulei and Zaha, so the trip was about 400 to 500 kilometers away. As the road conditions were not particularly good, Xia ruofei estimated that it would be afternoon by the time he reached arulei.

He did not make any stops along the way. He did not stop to have lunch either. For a cultivator at his level, not eating for a few days would not affect him much. The reason why Xia ruofei still ate three meals a day when the conditions allowed was that he wanted to have a regular rest and rest. It was as if this was the only way he could feel like he was living.

In fact, the path of cultivation was like this. The higher one’s cultivation, the less smoke and fire there would be, and gradually one would be able to break away from the scope of ordinary mortals.

Hence, Xia ruofei treasured his time as a mortal even though he was no longer an ordinary mortal.

Xia ruofei was listening to the radio as he drove.

There were fewer English broadcasts in arulei, and because of the lagging construction of the infrastructure, the broadcast signal was not particularly good, and only some information could be heard intermittently.

Just as Xia ruofei had expected, the media had already started reporting on the explosion in Basoko town.

Of course, the location of the explosion mentioned in the report was not the “modr training camp”, but the training base of a security company.

As for the disappearance of Boak the Viper, it was estimated that no one in the manor had discovered it yet, and the media would not report it.

At around two in the afternoon, Xia ruofei finally drove into arulei.

He had been busy the entire night and had been driving the entire morning. Even though Xia ruofei’s physical strength was far beyond that of ordinary people, he could not help but feel a little tired.

The main reason was that the road conditions were too bad, and they had to maintain a high level of concentration while driving. Moreover, the road had been bumpy for five to six hours, and no one could stand it.

After driving into the Urban area, Xia ruofei did not stop. Instead, he passed through the city proper area of arulei and continued North. After another ten kilometers, he finally arrived at his destination, the arulei temple.

This was one of the few scenic spots in the country of arulei that had a certain historical heritage. It was located in the northern suburbs of arulei. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

There was a small parking lot outside the temple. Xia ruofei parked the pickup truck inside.
