Chapter 765: Xiao hei’s appearance (2)

Xia ruofei said as he drove,””Xiao hei, I need to track down a group of people later. You have to perform well! Don’t let any scent escape!”

After listening to Xia ruofei’s words, Blackie actually whimpered at Xia ruofei and nodded.

After living in the Spirit map space for so many years, breathing in the rich spiritual Qi and drinking the water from the spirit pool, Blackie, fluffy one, and fluffy two’s intelligence had far surpassed that of a normal dog. Especially when it came to their master Xia ruofei’s words, it could understand anything as long as it was not too complicated.

In terms of physical function, even professionally trained police dogs and military dogs couldn’t compare to Blackie.

The dog’s sense of smell was about a million times better than that of humans, especially when it came to acidic substances. Some people had experimented by diluting sulfuric acid by 1/10000000 and dogs could still smell it. Therefore, they were widely used in search and rescue, bomb disposal, tracking, and other fields.

Blackie had been “strengthened” in the spirit map space for almost a year. Xia ruofei believed that its sense of smell was much stronger than professional police dogs and military dogs. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Hence, Xia ruofei was hoping that Blackie could play a role as a surprise in this operation. That was why he specifically avoided Guo Zhan and summoned it from the spirit map space.

“Soldiers are trained for a thousand days to be used in a single moment!” Xia ruofei said as he drove,”black, don’t screw up!”

Blackie barked twice, as if it was dissatisfied with Xia ruofei’s lack of confidence.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. His depressed mood from the death of old Luo was relieved.

After taking a detour, Xia ruofei arrived at the north gate of Sanshan University at the appointed time.

Guo Zhan and Tian Feilong were already waiting at the entrance. The Knight XV carriage was very eye – catching. Guo Zhan waved at Xia ruofei from afar.

Xia ruofei stopped the car in front of the two of them. Tian Feilong exclaimed in surprise,”Class monitor Xia! Long time no see!”

......

Guo Zhan had already informed Tian Feilong about Xia ruofei’s temporary recall of the troops. However, when he saw Xia ruofei, Tian Feilong couldn’t help but feel excited.

Tian Feilong had only joined the military one year later than Xia ruofei, and the two of them had only joined the lone wolf assault team two years apart. Moreover, they had been in the same class for a long time. Xia ruofei had been the Vice – Class monitor for a year and the class monitor for more than two years, so he was naturally very close to Tian Feilong.

“Feilong!” Xia ruofei smiled and greeted him.”Let’s talk in the car!”

Xia ruofei gestured for the two to sit in the back seat. Because the Knight XV had a very high chassis and xiaohei was lying on the seat, Guo Zhan and Tian Feilong only noticed xiaohei in the front passenger seat after they got in the car.

Guo Zhan asked in surprise,”Blood Wolf, you just said you have something to do. Are you going to pick it up?” Is this a police dog?”

Guo Zhan looked at Blackie and felt that it didn’t look like it. The most common breed of police dogs was the Germany Shepherd, as well as Labradors, Belgium sheepdogs, and so on. However, the dog that Xia ruofei had brought over, although its fur was smooth and it looked good, it was still a Chinese Garden dog, also known as a mutt!

Which unit would use a local dog as a police dog or a military dog?

Xia ruofei smiled.”No, no. This is my own dog. I left it with a friend in the city, so I picked it up. I’m here to see if it can help when we inspect the scene later.”

Tian Feilong looked at Blackie with some suspicion and said,”Squad leader Xia, we had already sent police dogs from the special police force over yesterday, but we couldn’t track down the group of people. They seemed to have been prepared and used some method to cover up their scent.”

Although Tian Feilong didn’t say it clearly, it was obvious that he didn’t have much confidence in Blackie.

Xia ruofei didn’t explain. He just smiled and said,””I was going to bring little black back anyway, so I brought it to the scene today. It’ll be best if we can find some clues. If we can ‘t, we won’t lose anything, right?”

“That’s true ...” Tian Feilong said with a smile.

Xia ruofei drove to the Research Institute where professor Liang Qiming had been working before he was taken hostage.

It was a small three – story building located in the northeast corner of the old campus of Sanshan University. The environment was very quiet, and no one would usually pass by this area. Now, it had been cordoned off. There were police officers standing guard thirty meters away, preventing unauthorized people from approaching.

Guo Zhan stuck his head out and gestured to the leading police officer. They immediately let them through. Xia ruofei’s car drove directly to the front of the small building.

There was a sign that said “Liang Qiming’s laboratory” in front of the building. There were also some other signs such as “post – doc mobile station” and “National key project”. They were neatly arranged on the outer wall, and it was full of academic atmosphere.

After the three of them got out of the car, Guo Zhan said,”yesterday, it was at the entrance of the laboratory building that a gunfight suddenly broke out. Squad leader old Luo ... It was here ... That he blocked three bullets for me ...”

Xia ruofei looked around. The place had returned to its usual tranquility. However, there were bullet marks on the tree at the entrance and on the wall next to it. They seemed to be quietly recounting the intense gunfight yesterday.

“Let’s go and take a look at the laboratory. ” Xia ruofei said.

The three of them walked into the laboratory building. Blackie followed closely behind Xia ruofei, looking around.

Xia ruofei had bought it not long after it was born and it had been living in the Spirit map space. This was its first time returning to the outside world. It seemed to be curious about this world that was countless times larger than the spirit map space, but the air was turbid.

There were also police officers standing guard at the entrance of the small building. He brought Xia ruofei and the rest into the sterile laboratory, where Liang Qiming and his assistants usually stayed. It was also the first crime scene.

In the past, one would need to go through a strict disinfection process to enter this laboratory. However, it was meaningless now, so everyone walked in directly.

The scene still maintained its original appearance from yesterday, a mess.

All the computers had been turned on, and the hard drives had been specially taken out. They were so broken that they couldn’t be any more broken. The reagents, beakers, and test tubes on the test table were all askew, and paper documents were scattered all over the ground. It was obvious that the group of people from yesterday had searched this place.

As for whether or not there were any gains, he did not know.

Xia ruofei’s eyes were quickly attracted by the row of white coats hanging at the door. He walked over quickly. These white coats had name tags on the left chest area. He quickly found the one that belonged to professor Liang Qiming.

There was a stain on the lapels of his white coat. He didn’t know if it was from the experiments. There were also some stains on the cuffs. Apparently, professor Liang hadn’t had time to ask someone to wash it after wearing it for the past two days.

Xia ruofei’s face revealed a trace of joy. He quickly pointed at the white coat and said,””Blackie, come here and smell this!”

Blackie immediately sneaked over and walked around the white coat. It sniffed hard and barked at Xia ruofei, indicating that it had remembered the smell.

Tian Feilong said,”squad leader Xia, the police dog from the special police force also tried yesterday. It sniffed the cup that professor Tian used. However, the smell disappeared not long after we went out. In the end, we returned without success.”

Xia ruofei said calmly,”let Blackie try!” Its sense of smell was better than that of an ordinary police dog. Moreover, dogs are especially sensitive to acidic substances. Professor Liang is a well – known chemist, so he must have come into contact with all kinds of sulfuric acid during his experiments. The white coat might have left such a smell on it. I think it might be better than sniffing the cup!”

“That makes sense, Blood Wolf!” Guo Zhan nodded. Let little black try!”

Xiaohei had already memorized the smell on the white coat. However, this room was filled with professor Liang’s scent, so Xia ruofei brought xiaohei to the back door of the small building. Yesterday, the group of people had taken professor Liang hostage and escaped from here.

“Little black, show me your trump card!” Xia ruofei said,”you must help us find professor Liang!”

As soon as Xia ruofei finished speaking, Blackie immediately jumped out without any hesitation. He seemed very confident and confident.

“That’s right,”Tian Feilong said excitedly,”that’s the direction the group of people fled in yesterday!”

“Go! Let’s hurry!” Guo Zhan also said immediately.
