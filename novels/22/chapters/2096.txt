2097 Father – in – Law (1)

“Don’t worry, master!” Xia Qing said,”I will definitely follow your instructions and record it carefully!”

Xia ruofei nodded and asked some more detailed questions. Then, he handed the experimental work to Xia Qing.

Under normal circumstances, the growth cycle of a Strasburg goose was about two to three months. With the addition of the time flow at the Archean realm, the experiment could be completed in a few days.

After Xia ruofei left the origin space, he saw that it was already past FiveO’ clock. He quickly washed up, grabbed his coat, ran downstairs, and drove straight to the jiangbin villa district in the city.

The agreed time for dinner was Sixo’ clock. It was rush hour. Xia ruofei rushed left and right in the traffic and even stuffed himself a few times. Finally, he arrived at Ling Qingxue’s Villa area at around five fifty.

Xia ruofei did not even have time to prepare a gift for Ling Xiaotian when he left the house. Fortunately, most of his things were stored in the spirit map space, so he had plenty of time to think about what to give his future father – in – Law.

When he alighted from the car, he took out two bottles of expensive fermented red wine and two bottles of the highest quality Drunken Eight Immortals from his storage space. Ling Xiaotian loved to drink, so bringing him wine was the best gift he could give.

Ling Xiaotian and Ling Qingxue, father and daughter, had gotten off work early today. When they heard the sound of the car, the two of them quickly walked out of the villa.

“Uncle Ling! Qingxue!” Xia ruofei smiled and walked over with a glass of wine.

“Ruofei, why are you taking things again?” Ling Xiaotian said angrily,”you can’t do this next time!”

Even though he said that, his hands did not slow down. He took the two bags from Xia ruofei’s hands. Actually, he had already seen that the bags were filled with wine.

Ling Qingxue looked at her father speechlessly, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.”Dad, can’t you be more reserved?”

“What’s there to be reserved about with your own son – in – Law!”Ling Xiaotian laughed.

“You ...” Ling Qingxue said shyly,”what do you mean by son – in – Law? Do you really want me to get married?”

“Qingxue, this wine was originally prepared for uncle Ling!” Xia ruofei quickly tried to smooth things over. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Wine isn’t anything good,” Ling Qingxue said.”You bring him wine every time you come. What if he gets sick from drinking?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’m here.” Have you forgotten that your boyfriend is a very good doctor? By the way, uncle Ling, I’ll check your body later. If you feel uncomfortable, let’s recuperate as soon as possible!”

Ling Xiaotian chuckled,”sure!” Good!”

The father – daughter pair welcomed Xia ruofei into the villa. Ling Xiaotian said,””Aunt Liu is preparing dinner. Ruofei, let’s go make some tea. It’s been a while since we last met. Let’s have a good chat!”

“Alright, my guest will do as the host wishes!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

In Ling Xiaotian’s living room, there was a very stylish root – carved tea tray. The entire tea tray was carved from a huge tree root. After being coated with a lacquer, it retained the original color of the wood and at the same time gave people a glossy and smooth feeling.

Ling Xiaotian took out some tea leaves from the tea tray and said with a smile,””No matter how much I drink, the Dahongpao you gave me is still the most authentic. It’s much better than those Zhengshan little seeds that are sold outside for a few thousand Yuan per 500 grams!”

“Uncle Ling, if you like it, I’ll bring you more next time!” Xia ruofei smiled.

“How can I accept that?” Ling Xiaotian chuckled.

Xia ruofei said,”these tea leaves were originally produced by our farm. What’s there to be embarrassed about giving you some tea leaves to drink? As long as you don’t mind this Da Hong Pao, I’ll take care of all the tea you drink in the future!”

“Good, good, good!” Ling Xiaotian said happily.

Xia ruofei took the bag of tea leaves from Ling Xiaotian’s hands very naturally and started to make the tea. If he let his future father – in – Law be busy making tea while he sat there waiting to drink, he would be too insensible.

However, just as Xia ruofei finished distributing the first batch of tea, the task of brewing tea was taken over by Ling Qingxue. She smiled and said,””Ruofei, have a good chat with my dad! I’ll make the tea ...”

After Xia ruofei and Ling Xiaotian chatted for a while, Ling Xiaotian said,””Ruofei, there’s something I need to discuss with you. The winery has been asking me a lot recently, hoping to expand the production. The sales of our wine are really good, and the profits are also very impressive. The person in charge of the winery said that with such a good reputation, if we don’t expand the production and quickly occupy the market, it will be a huge loss!”

Xia ruofei understood what Ling Xiaotian meant. The production capacity of the winery did not depend on how much Drunken Eight Immortals wine they could produce, but how much Drunken Eight Immortals wine they could “process”.

Ling Xiaotian was asking for his opinion!

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””Uncle Ling, since everyone has this suggestion, let’s appropriately expand the production! We can’t just leave the money to be earned, right?”

Previously, Xia ruofei had limited the production of the wine every month because it took time to brew the Drunken Eight Immortals wine. In order to quickly produce Drunken Eight Immortals of all levels, he had to make use of the difference in the flow of time in the spirit map’s space.

Furthermore, the territory of the Archean realm had not expanded for a long time, so the space wasn’t large. He couldn’t possibly squeeze into the space of other precious crops just to produce more wine.

However, the situation was different now. Xia ruofei’s control of the spirit map’s spatial rules had improved. He could now stack small spaces in the space at will so that the Drunken Eight Immortals wine could be stacked up. As long as the space was high enough, he could stack it however he wanted.
