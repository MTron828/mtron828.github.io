Chapter 474: Chapter 392 – roundabout stratagy_1

Xia ruofei drove to the largest jade Market in Sanshan city and began to choose the best mutton – Fat white jade he needed from the large number of Jade materials that were mixed with good and bad, and it was difficult to distinguish whether they were real or fake.

Qin Xiao Yu brought a few of her subordinates to escort Zhao he to the hospital. She left all of her subordinates in the hospital to look after Zhao he and called for a few special police officers for reinforcements. Then, she went directly to the Bureau chief of the Public Security Bureau to report such A big matter as capturing an A – Class wanted criminal from the Ministry of Public Security.

“Zhao Zhixi?” After listening to Qin Xiao Yu’s report, the head of the Public Security Bureau, Chen Bo, could not help but raise his eyebrows and ask,”has the identity been verified?”

Qin Xiao Yu stood upright in front of Chen Bo’s desk and said,””Yes, I am. We verified his identity through a fingerprint match. The accuracy is very high, so there’s no way we’re wrong!”

Chen Bo slapped his thigh in excitement and said,””Alright! Little Qin, you’ve done a great service!” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Chen Bo had a deep impression of Zhao Zhixi, a wanted criminal from five years ago. When Qin Xiao Yu mentioned it just now, the picture on the wanted order from a few years ago suddenly appeared in his mind.

This was not only because Zhao Zhixi had committed a family extermination case that shocked the entire country, but also because there was an even more important reason. At that time, several clues pointed to the possibility that Zhao Zhixi had fled to the southeast province.

At that time, Chen Bo, who was still the Deputy bureau chief, had personally led the police to the airport, dock, station, and urban hotel hostel to carry out a carpet search. Although they did not find Zhao Zhixi in the end, Chen Bo had a deep impression of this wanted criminal.

Chen Bo immediately stood up and said with a smile,””Let’s go, Xiao Qin. Let’s go and meet this Zhao Zhixi. I really want to ask him if he escaped to the southeast province after committing the crime. I had to stay up a few nights to catch him!”

Qin Xiao Yu’s expression was slightly sluggish as she said,””Chief, he’s still in the hospital! I’m afraid he won’t be able to be interrogated for a while. ”

Chen Bo was stunned for a moment and said,””What’s going on? Was it an injury sustained during the capture? Was he resisting very fiercely? Are our people alright?”

“Our people are fine.” Qin Xiao Yu quickly replied. Chief, actually, when we arrived at the scene, Zhao Zhixi had already been subdued by a ... A ... Passerby. Because we found that Zhao Zhixi had a gun on him, we immediately carried out an identity check on him. We didn’t expect to catch a big fish. ”

Qin Xiao Yu didn’t know how to describe Xia ruofei and could only awkwardly call him a “passerby”.

Chen Bo also felt a little surprised. He then smiled and sat back in his seat, saying,””Little Qin, your luck is really good! He can even catch an A – Class wanted criminal like this ... Back then, I was so worried about catching this Zhao Zhixi that my hair almost turned white. In the end, I still couldn’t catch him. It’s really infuriating to compare people!”

Chen Bo was in a good mood, so he also joked with Qin Xiaoyu.

“Chief, it’s the Bureau’s contribution to capture Zhao Zhixi, not mine alone,” said Qin Xiao Yu.

Chen Bo smiled and nodded,”I’ll report this to the head immediately and ask for your merits!” Oh, right ...”

Chen Bo thought for a moment and said,”I remember that the Ministry has a reward for those who have rendered Meritorious Service in capturing Zhao Zhixi. If I’m not mistaken, it should be 100000 Yuan!” Contact the person who helped us subdue Zhao Zhixi. We’ll get the bonus in two days!”

“Ah?” Qin Xiao Yu was stunned for a moment and said,”chief, don’t we have to wait for the reward to be allocated by the Ministry? There’s no need to be in such a hurry!”

Chen Bo laughed and said,”you have to strike while the iron is hot!” 100,000 Yuan isn’t a lot, we’ll just pay for it first, the Ministry of Finance will definitely allocate it! How about this, you contact that person first, and I’ll arrange for someone to do a preliminary interrogation on Zhao Zhixi. After the situation is confirmed, we’ll hold a press conference tomorrow or the day after to announce to the public that Zhao Zhixi has been arrested, and at the same time, we’ll also award a bonus to that enthusiastic person. ”

“Oh ... Okay!” Although Qin Xiao Yu was a little reluctant, she could only carry out the Bureau chief’s order.

Coming out of Chen Bo’s office, Qin Xiao Yu had been frowning and urging Chen Bo to ask her to contact Xia ruofei, but she did not have Xia ruofei’s phone number.

He couldn’t possibly run to the Peach Blossom Farm again!

Qin Xiao Yu frowned at the thought of her going to inform Xia ruofei about the reward.

Who knew how arrogant that guy would be when the time came! No, I can’t let him be smug! Qin Xiao Yu said in her heart.

However, he had to carry out Chen Bo’s orders.

Qin Xiao Yu sat in her office and thought for a while, and finally thought of a compromise.

……

At Sanshan University, Lu You and Jiang Yue carried their books and walked out of the dormitory building, preparing to go to the classroom for class.

At this moment, Lu You’s cell phone rang. She held her book in one hand and took out her cell phone with the other. She took a look at it, then picked it up and said with a smile,””Sister Xiaoyu, what brings you here today? Haven’t you guys been so busy recently?”

“Youyou, I’d like to ask for your help.” Qin Xiao Yu said. You should have Xia ruofei’s phone number, right?”

Lu You glanced at Jiang Yue beside her unnaturally. Although the phone’s volume was very soft and Jiang Yue could not have heard Qin Xiao Yu’s words from the other end, Lu You still felt a little guilty.
