Chapter 987: Chapter 635 – all the demons and monsters are gone (1)

Translator: 549690339

The middle – aged man was song Qiming, the Deputy Secretary of the southeast province’s Provincial Committee and the Deputy Secretary of the provincial Committee of Sanshan city.

On the way from the door to the kitchen, Ling Xiaotian had already briefly reported the entire situation to song Qiming.

The more song Qiming listened, the angrier he became. Putting aside the relationship between Ling Xiaotian and Xia ruofei, the actions of Tian Mingyi and director Wu could be said to be extremely bold and unscrupulous. They completely treated themselves as local tyrants. Just because they had the right to supervise these food and beverage enterprises, they did whatever they wanted.

If all the basic – Level civil servants had such quality and character, then how chaotic would the governance of the three mountains under his rule be?

Of course, this might be an extremely rare case, but song Qiming could not tolerate it.

He wasn’t a clean freak, and it was impossible for someone who didn’t know how to be flexible to reach such a high leadership position. However, this didn’t mean that he had no principles. On the contrary, he could accept the exchange and game of political interests, but he couldn’t tolerate the unscrupulous abuse of power by the grassroots civil servants who were directly facing the public.

Besides, this shop was backed by Xia ruofei.

Even elder song held him in high regard, and he had even saved his daughter’s life!

Political influence aside, Xia ruofei’s superb medical skills were enough to make song Qiming value him.

It was no exaggeration to say that befriending Xia ruofei was the same as giving himself an extra life!

Therefore, song Qiming had made up his mind to punish her severely.

A new official would have to make three fires. The first fire would be to build up the cadre team and build up the style of work! Song Qiming said murderously in his heart.

Song Qiming was not in a hurry to enter the kitchen.

He just stood quietly at the door and saw the ugly state of Tian Ming Yi and the others.

Song Qiming’s anger burned even more fiercely. The arrogance and shamelessness of these people were beyond his imagination.

Manager Lu was walking behind the group of people with his head hung low. The first person he saw was not the unfamiliar song Qiming, but Ling Xiaotian, who was standing beside him.

“Chairman, you’re here ...” Manager Lu quickly called out.

Manager Lu also smiled bitterly in his heart.”I don’t know if the chairman has taken the wrong medicine today. The problem could have been solved by giving in, but he has to go against them. Now, even the notice of suspension of business for rectification has been issued. What’s the use of you coming here?”

After Tian Mingyi heard this, he had the preconceived notion that song Qiming, who was standing in the middle, was the chairman that manager Lu had mentioned.

He walked over casually and said,””You’re the owner of this shop? There’s a big problem with your shop! Just now, inspector Wu has already given you guys a notice to stop your operations for rectification. It’s too late for you to plead for mercy now, so just focus on the rectification!”

“Who are you?” song Qiming asked coldly.

Tian Mingyi disdainfully curled his lips and said, “You’re quite a busybody! What does my identity have to do with you? It was better to think about how to rectify it! Don’t close down after only half a day ...” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Impudent!” Song Qiming rebuked angrily,”what is the purpose of our party? To serve the people! Is this how you guys serve? He’s simply lawless!”

“Yo, yo, yo! Where did this big – tailed Wolf come from!” Inspector Wu said contemptuously,”you’re pretty good at using the official language! People who don’t know better would think that you’re a F * cking Secretary of the municipal government!”

“Shut up!” Guangzhi shuddered at inspector Wu’s words. He quickly squeezed past Ling Xiaotian to the front and said angrily,”this is the Secretary of the municipal government, Mr. Song Qiming! What unit are you all from? You’re simply a bastard!”

“He’s the Secretary of the municipal government?” Tian Mingyi sneered,”then I’m still a F * cking Secretary of the provincial government!”

The group of people brought by inspector Wu burst into laughter. Only inspector Wu felt that something was not right. He had a bad feeling about this. He looked at song Qiming.

Song Qiming’s face was as calm as water. His eyes were cold as he looked at the group of demons and monsters.

Inspector Wu’s heart skipped a beat. He could not help but rub his eyes and secretly size up song Qiming.

He had a tall and burly figure, a dignified square face, a pair of bright eyes, and a neat back of hair ...

The more inspector Wu looked, the more he felt that something was wrong.

Although song Qiming had not been in office for long, he appeared in the local news of San Shan almost every day. The general public might not care too much, and many people did not even know that the Secretary of the municipal government had been replaced, but the civil servants would more or less pay attention to it.

This was a major event in the officialdom!

Even though inspector Wu was just a minor official, he was extremely good at currying favor with others. Otherwise, he would not have been able to get close to Tian Mingyi. Hence, he read the news of the three mountains almost every day.

He had assumed that song Qiming was Ling Xiaotian, and since he was different from the one he saw on TV, he did not recognize him.

Besides, he would never have dreamed that the dignified Secretary of the municipal government would suddenly come to such a private restaurant! How could he be so small?

After Guangzhi Cao’s outburst of anger at Tian Mingyi, director Wu finally felt that something was wrong. He secretly looked at song Qiming a few times. His heart started to tremble, and his legs went soft.
