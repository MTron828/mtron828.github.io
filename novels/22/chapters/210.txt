Chapter 211: Not optimistic (urgent monthly votes)_1

The plane left the runway and accurately stopped at the parking spot through the runway. After the plane came to a stop, the covered bridge was soon pulled up, but at the same time, an accommodation car also drove over and leaned against a door on the side of the first – Class cabin. The crew member opened the door. At this moment, Tian Huilan’s Secretary also arrived in the first class cabin. The three of them did not cross the corridor bridge with the ordinary passengers. Secretary Xiao took Xia ruofei and Tian Huilan’s luggage, then they directly disembarked from the first – Class cabin door through the accommodation ladder. A military leopard stopped not far from the plane. A Lieutenant Colonel quickly walked up and saluted Tian Huilan, saying in a clear voice,””Hello, Secretary Tian! I’ve been ordered to welcome you!” “It’s been hard on you. Let’s go!”Tian Huilan nodded slightly. “Yes!” The Lieutenant Colonel opened the Leopards ‘door. Xia ruofei and Tian Huilan got into the back while Tian Huilan’s Secretary, Xiao Xiao, sat in the front seat. After the Lieutenant Colonel closed the door for Tian Huilan, he quickly got into the car and started the cheetah cross – country. However, the car didn’t drive out of the airport. Instead, it went straight to the helipad in the distance. The speed was obviously beyond the speed limit of the airport. Elder song’s condition was not good. Before the car stopped, Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows. He saw a mi -171 helicopter in camouflage paint. There was a serial number starting with “eh” on the body of the helicopter, indicating that this helicopter was from the Air Force. When the helicopter saw the cheetah approaching, the helicopter’s rotor started to spin. When the car stopped at a safe distance in front of the helicopter, the helicopter was ready to take off at any time. The Lieutenant Colonel opened the car door for Tian Huilan. He was only in charge of coordinating the matters at the airport and sending her here. Hence, after Xia ruofei and the other two alighted, the Lieutenant Colonel stood by the car and waved goodbye to the three. Xia ruofei and the other two jogged towards the helicopter, braving the turbulence caused by the rotor wings. A pilot in a blue flight suit stood at the cabin door and helped Tian Huilan and Secretary Xiao Xiao into the helicopter. Just as the pilot reached out his hand, Xia ruofei had already run up and stepped on the accommodation ladder. His body was like a cheetah as he scurried into the plane. As the last person to board the plane, Xia ruofei habitually turned around and prepared to close the cabin door. In the lone wolf assault team, this boarding action had been trained thousands of times, and it had long become a conditioned reflex. It was only when Xia ruofei felt the pilot’s strange gaze that he reacted. He revealed an embarrassed smile and retracted his hand. The pilot also smiled, put away the accommodation ladder, and quickly closed the cabin door. Then, he patted Xia ruofei’s shoulder. As the plane’s engine revved, he leaned over to Xia ruofei’s ear and said loudly,””Brother! You were a soldier before, right? His movements are very standard!” Xia ruofei grinned and nodded at him. The pilot gave Xia ruofei a thumbs – up and then went into the cockpit. Xia ruofei and the other two sat down. The helicopter trembled slightly and then took off. After rising to a certain altitude, the head of the helicopter lowered slightly, and the helicopter began to fly quickly in the direction West of Hongzhou. The cabin of a military helicopter was filled with loud roars. Moreover, due to the low flight altitude, it was affected by the airflow, so it was quite bumpy along the way. Tian Huilan and Secretary Xiao’s faces were pale, and their hands were tightly clasped together. It was obvious that this was their first time riding a military helicopter. On the other hand, Xia ruofei was the exact opposite. This gave him a very familiar feeling. When he was in the Army, he had taken this helicopter countless times, sometimes for training, sometimes for missions. Most of the time, the members of the assault team closed their eyes to rest in the helicopter. The noisy and bumpy environment was the best place for them to rest before a big battle. Even though he was away from the military, Xia ruofei still felt his blood boiling when he heard the sound of the helicopter’s rotor wings. This time, the flight time was not long. After about half an hour, the plane began to descend slowly and soon landed steadily on an open space. When the three of them got off the plane, an off – Road command vehicle was already waiting not far away. A major with an elite short hair welcomed the three of them into the car, and then the car quickly left the helicopter landing field. Xia ruofei noticed that they were in a lush mountain forest. The SUV quickly turned into a deep, curved path and drove up the mountain along the path that was only three meters wide and lined with thick holly trees. Along the way, there were three rounds of strict checks. With Xia ruofei’s keen senses as a Special Forces soldier, he found at least four hidden sentries. The soldiers in these hidden sentries were all armed with live ammunition. This place was really heavily guarded! No one spoke along the way, and there was an inexplicable tension in the silence. Finally, after passing through the fourth checkpoint, the command vehicle stopped in front of a courtyard. The walls of the courtyard were mottled, showing the traces of time. The courtyard was a gray three – story building with a rough style and hard lines. It was built with the help of his elder brother. After Tian Huilan’s group of three got out of the car, a man in his forties who had been waiting at the entrance of the courtyard immediately came up to them. The man was wearing a gray jacket, a pair of gold – rimmed glasses, and his hair was neatly combed. He nodded slightly to Tian Huilan and said,”Secretary Tian, you’ve had a long journey!” Tian Huilan didn’t dare to be negligent and said,”Thank you for your hard work, manager Lu! How’s elder song?” Manager Lu’s expression darkened.”It’s not too optimistic ... The doctor said that it might be within the next few days ... The Bureau chief has been in a coma for longer and longer. He can barely speak when he wakes up occasionally ... He was already put on a ventilator this morning ...” Manager Lu’s eyes turned red. He was elder song’s Secretary and had been with him for almost ten years. When elder song retired from his position as a leader, he was supposed to be assigned to an important position in an Eastern Province, but manager Lu couldn’t bear to leave the old chief and asked to continue working with elder song. Manager Lu had long regarded elder song as his family. Now that elder song was about to pass away, he couldn’t help but feel sad. He took a deep breath and adjusted his mood. Then, he said to Tian Huilan,”Secretary Tian, you said on the phone that you wanted to bring a Chinese medicine doctor to take a look at the chief’s condition. This ...” Manager Lu looked at Xia ruofei and then at his Secretary, young Xiao. He felt that neither of them looked like celestial – looking old Chinese doctors! Tian Huilan quickly said,”manager Lu, let me introduce you. This young man is Xia ruofei. Little Xia is very accomplished in Chinese medicine. I asked him to take a look at elder song in the hope that it can help with his condition ... Little Xia, this is Lu Liansheng, manager Lu. He’s elder song’s personal secretary.” Manager Lu didn’t expect the Chinese medicine Tian Huilan was talking about to be this young man in his twenties. His mouth was wide open in shock, and his eyes were about to pop out ... [PS] today, steel gun was really going all out. He didn’t take a nap in the afternoon and had been waiting until now after dinner. It was the last day, and the situation with the monthly votes was getting worse and worse. Steel gun was also burning with anxiety. Was he really going to fail on the last day? There are less than 23 hours left. If my brothers and sisters don’t vote, the monthly votes in their hands will be invalid. Please support me again on account of steel gun’s hard work ... In the past 30 days, I didn’t sleep earlier than 2 O’ clock. Can’t this kind of hard work be exchanged for the results I want? I don’t believe it ...
