Then, she made a hand gesture to let them in.

Xia ruofei smiled and waved at Qin Xiao Yu as he started the car. Just as the car was about to move forward, Qin Xiao Yu suddenly said,””Si Mao is doing very well at my house. You can come and see him when you have time!”

Qin Xiao Yu saw a hand stretched out from the window of the Knight XV that had already driven past her, making an ‘OK’ gesture.

This guy! The corners of Qin Xiao Yu’s mouth couldn’t help but curve up.

The police officer beside her couldn’t help but be stunned. Cold – faced Captain Qin could actually smile? My eyes aren’t playing tricks on me, right? He could not help but rub his eyes.

Qin Xiao Yu stuffed the breathalyzer into her subordinate’s hands and said,””What are you looking at? Aren’t you going to record the results of the examination?”

The police officer took the breathalyzer and saw the number on it. His mood was the same as Qin Xiao Yu and he heaved a sigh of relief.

He quickly jotted down the license plate number, test results, inspection time, and so on.

As for the strong smell of alcohol in the bus, it was not like they had never encountered such a thing before. It was most likely that there were drunk passengers on the bus.

There was limited space in the car. The windows were closed in the middle of winter, so there wasn’t enough air circulation. As long as there was a drunk passenger, the car would definitely be filled with the smell of alcohol.

In the Knight XV SUV, Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei in disbelief.””I passed just like that?”

“What else?” Xia ruofei shrugged.

If it wasn’t for the fact that the air in the car contained a lot of alcohol, and he had inevitably breathed in a little, the test result would have been even lower. He had even used true energy to force all the alcohol out of his body.

Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei with a half – Smile and said,””Don’t tell me that pretty policewoman deliberately went easy on him? Ruofei, you actually know such a beautiful female police officer? how come I didn’t know about her?”

Xia ruofei did not know whether to laugh or cry as he looked at Ling Qingxue and said,”Wife, what are you thinking? Qin Xiaoyu has always been a woman who doesn’t recognize her family at work. If she wants to go easy on me, can’t she just let me go directly? Is there a need for me to blow a breath of air?”

“Qin Xiao Yu? That’s a nice name!” Ling Qingxue giggled and said,”it seems like you know her quite well!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile bitterly. He must be out of his mind to reason with a jealous woman ...

Seeing Xia ruofei’s embarrassed look, Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but burst out laughing.”I was just teasing you! Look at how scared you are ...”

It was hard to tell the truth from the woman’s words. Xia ruofei did not dare to let his guard down. He quickly said,”Anyway, I’m not in an abnormal relationship with officer Qin! Qingxue, you’re the one I love! The sun and moon can bear witness to this heart!”

Ling Qingxue could not help but blush. She turned around guiltily and saw that Ling Xiaotian was still sleeping soundly, even snoring lightly. She then gently hit Xia ruofei and said softly,””Damn it! My dad is still in the car! To say such mushy words ...”

“This is considered mushy?” Xia ruofei laughed evilly.”I have something even more nauseating!”

“I don’t want to hear it, I don’t want to hear it ...” Ling Qingxue reached out to cover Xia ruofei’s mouth.

“Stop it, I’m driving!” Xia ruofei quickly said.

Ling Qingxue finally stopped. She glared at Xia ruofei and couldn’t help but burst out laughing.

The inspection location wasn’t far from Ling Qingxue’s house. After the two of them laughed and joked around, the car quickly drove into the villa area and stopped in front of Ling Qingxue’s house.

Originally, Xia ruofei was prepared to carry Ling Xiaotian inside. However, when the car stopped, Ling Xiaotian woke up on his own. He asked with sleepy eyes,””RUO Fei, Qingxue, have we arrived?”

Ling Xiaotian did not drink too much today, and the slight shaking of the car as it drove had a hypnotic effect on him. Now that the car had stopped, he had also woken up from his light sleep.

“Yup! Uncle Ling!” Xia ruofei turned around and said with a smile.

Ling Xiaotian sat up straight, unbuckled his seat belt, and got out of the car with Ling Qingxue.

Xia ruofei also got out of the car. Ling Xiaotian was already fully awake. He laughed and said,””Ruofei, it’s too late today, so I won’t invite you in! You should also make good use of your time and go back to rest early!”

“Okay, uncle Ling!” Xia ruofei said.

“Qingxue, I’ll go in first!” Ling Xiaotian then turned to Ling Qingxue and said,”it’s cold outside. Don’t stay too long!”

“I know, dad!” Ling Qingxue said.

Ling Xiaotian led the way into the mansion. Ling Qingxue held Xia ruofei’s hand and stood at the door. She leaned on him gently, feeling a little reluctant to part with him.

At this time, it was probably midnight when the New Year’s Eve arrived. Suddenly, a burst of firecrackers sounded in the distance, and colorful fireworks began to bloom in the sky, lighting up the dark sky.

However, the lighting of fireworks was also prohibited in the villa area, so the fireworks were far away, and the sound was a little weak.

“It’s so beautiful!” Ling Qingxue looked up at the sky and said in surprise.

“Qingxue! Happy New Year!” Xia ruofei said loudly.

“Happy New Year!” Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei with a bright smile.

Looking at Ling Qingxue’s beautiful face, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but hold her face gently, then lowered his head and kissed her hard.

Under the illumination of the fireworks, the pair of lovers kissed each other in the night, completely forgetting the noise outside ...

After a long time, Ling Qingxue finally got out of Xia ruofei’s arms, blushing. She lowered her head and said,””You should go back ...”

“Yes ...” Xia ruofei said,”I want to see you enter the house!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“My home is here, how can I get lost?” Ling Qingxue said with a mischievous smile.

“No, I must see you return home safely!” Xia ruofei said.

“You’re just like a child ...” Ling Qingxue rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei, but her heart was warm.

She let go of Xia ruofei’s hand and walked into the villa’s courtyard step by step. At the entrance, she turned around and waved at Xia ruofei with a smile.

Xia ruofei was leaning against the Knight XV and waved at Ling Qingxue. He only drove back to the daguantian community when he saw Ling Qingxue enter the house.

When they returned to Hu Zi’s mother’s house, she had already gone back to her room to rest. Lin Qiao was still in the living room watching the Spring Festival Gala that was coming to an end.

“Godmother is asleep?” Xia ruofei asked softly.

“Yup!” Lin Qiao said while peeling the orange,”she asked you to rest early!”

“What about you?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“I want to stay up for the new year!” Lin Qiao said.

“You can finally stay up all night, right?” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Where?” Lin Qiao pouted and said,”it’s very important to stay up for the new year, okay? Brother RUO Fei, why don’t you stay up and guard the place together?”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”you should guard it slowly!” I’m going back to my room!”

While he was on the road, his phone and WeChat notifications had been ringing non – stop. They must have been well – wishes from his friends or business partners.

Xia ruofei also prepared to return to his room and reply to them one by one.

“Boring ...” Lin Qiao pouted. Then, she broke off half of the orange and stuffed it into Xia ruofei’s hand.

Xia ruofei laughed and took out a red packet that he had prepared earlier.”You still know how to share half of your food with me! Our Qiao’ er has grown up! Here, this is your New Year’s money. Take it!”

When Ling Xiaotian gave Lin Qiao a red packet, she would hesitate for a while. But when it came to Xia ruofei’s Red packet, Lin Qiao would never be polite. She took it and opened it on the spot.

“Waa! Another big red packet!” Lin Qiao shouted happily,”I’m really rich this year ...”

Lin Qiao’s voice was a little loud. Xia ruofei quickly pointed to Hu Zi’s mother’s bedroom and made a shushing gesture.

Lin Qiao quickly covered her mouth and then released it. She stuck her tongue out at Xia ruofei and smiled.”Thank you, brother ruofei! You’re the best!”

“You little girl, you’re so sweet with red packets!” Xia ruofei touched Lin Qiao’s head lovingly and said,””You should sleep early too! Don’t really stay up all night!”

“I know!” Lin Qiao said.

Xia ruofei then strode back to his room. First, he took out a change of clothes from his bag and went to the bathroom to take a shower. Then, he lay on the bed. He had missed the midnight cultivation time tonight. He was going to reply to messages and WeChat before going to sleep.
