Chapter 143: The first batch of guests in the new space (1)

Xia ruofei saw the anxious look on Cao tieshu’s face and quickly walked up to him. He asked,””Old Cao, what’s wrong?” “Boss, my wife just called me, saying that she fell while shopping at the temple fair. I was just about to ask you for leave!” Cao tieshu said. I’m afraid I can’t be on duty today ...” “Yo! Why would he fall? Is it serious?” Xia ruofei quickly asked. It was really depressing for such a thing to happen on the first day of the first month of the lunar year. “AI!” Cao tieshu said. Who knows ... That woman just likes to join in the fun ... There are so many people at the temple fair, it’s easy to get into trouble ... She’s still in the county hospital! It seems like his bones are injured, but it shouldn’t be a big problem if he can make a phone call!” “Then hurry over! You don’t have to worry about the shift, Ling Yun is at the farm too!” Xia ruofei said. “Okay, thank you, boss!” Cao tieshu said,”I will rush over on the fourth day of the new year when you are transplanting the vegetable seedlings ...” Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”you old Cao!” At a time like this, you still care about this! Hurry up and go see your wife! I’ve granted you leave. You’re not allowed to go to work before your wife recovers, or I’ll deduct your salary!” “This ...” Cao tieshu hesitated. “Why are you still here and there? Hurry up and go!” Xia ruofei said. “Oh! Okay ... Thank you, boss!” Cao tieshu said. Then, he ran to the shed, got his motorcycle, and rushed to the county hospital. Xia ruofei thought about it. Since he had nothing to do today, he might as well go to the temple fair. Moreover, as Cao tieshu’s boss, he knew that something had happened to his family. Moreover, it was the first day of the new year. It was only right for him to go and visit. Hence, Xia ruofei returned to the villa, informed Hu Zi’s mother, and drove away from Taoyuan farm. Xia ruofei did not use the Knight XV. Instead, he drove a pickup. The Knight XV was too ostentatious, and there were many people at the temple fair on the first day of the Lunar New Year. Xia ruofei did not want to be watched like a monkey in a Zoo. Some people liked to be in the limelight, while others preferred to keep a low profile. Xia ruofei happened to be the latter. The temple fair in Changping County was located at the county Cultural Square. Xia ruofei had been to the county several times and was familiar with the place. He quickly found a parking space nearby and parked his car. Then, he walked towards the temple fair. On the streets of Changping County on the first day of the new year, red lanterns were hung on the trees on both sides of the road. The street lamps were also decorated with beautiful “Fu” characters. On the road to the cultural Square, colorful flags were also placed along the road, giving off a festive atmosphere. Xia ruofei was prepared to walk around the temple fair and buy some gifts to visit Cao tieshu’s wife at the county hospital. When he walked near the entrance of the temple fair, his eyes were attracted by a man who had a stall. There was a big basket in front of the man, and there were five or six furry puppies in it. Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat. He was just about to raise some animals in the new space after the evolution! Dogs were undoubtedly a good choice. This was because dogs had higher intelligence. It was said that the Border Collie with the highest IQ could reach the intelligence level of a seven – year – old child. A dog that had been kept in the spirit map space for a long time would definitely have higher intelligence and would be of great help to Xia ruofei in the future. Moreover, dogs were a relatively common animal, and it was very convenient to use them in the outside world. Xia ruofei strode towards the man’s stall. “Boss, how much are you selling this dog for?” Xia ruofei looked at the dog in the basket and asked casually. The man quickly said,”” 50 yuan each, no bargaining!” “What breed is your dog?” Xia ruofei asked. “This ... Is a Chinese countryside dog!” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. He joked,””Isn’t that a mutt? Why are they still so expensive?” The man quickly explained,”Sir, to tell you the truth, these little dogs were given birth to by my big yellow Dog, so their breed might be a little ordinary ... But their father is amazing!” That was the big wolfdog raised by boss Chen of the Dafa abalone farm! These dogs will definitely be very fierce when they grow up, and they’ll definitely be good at guarding the house!” “So there’s still a bloodline!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”alright, I’ll take all of them ...” “AI! “Okay, okay, okay ...” The man said happily when he heard that Xia ruofei would buy all of them.”Sir, there are seven in total. If you give me 350 Yuan, I’ll give you this basket as a gift ...” Xia ruofei was stunned. He looked at the puppy in the basket and asked,””Aren’t there six of them here?” The boss was a little embarrassed as he took out a little black dog from under his chair. This little dog was even smaller than the ones in the basket. It looked listless and had some wounds on its body. It looked like it was on the verge of death. The boss smiled apologetically.”Sir, this is also a litter of puppies. It’s just that it was a little weak when it was born, and it’s always bullied by the other puppies, so ... Hehe, it’s not a loss for you to buy it back. You can definitely raise it. And didn’t I give you a basket?” Xia ruofei looked at the puppy and felt a little sympathetic. Besides, a few hundred Yuan was nothing to him now. Naturally, he would not be so calculative. He nodded and said,”Alright, deal!” “Thank you, thank you! “Sir, you’re really a forthright person ...” The boss said happily. Xia ruofei took out 350 Yuan from his wallet and handed it to the owner. Then, he carried the basket in one hand and the black puppy in the other and walked back. When they arrived at his pickup, Xia ruofei placed the wicker basket inside. Xia ruofei thought for a while. He couldn’t just leave the puppy in the car. It would be a disaster if it were to freeze in such a cold weather. These were seven little lives! Hence, he simply drove out of the city and stopped at an empty roadside. Xia ruofei summoned the spirit map scroll from his palm and kept the basket that contained the six puppies and the black puppy into the new space. The new space had the same flow of time as the outside world, so Xia ruofei did not have to worry about the time in the new space passing by quickly and the puppy starving to death. He kept the painting in his body and drove back to the county. After walking around the temple fair for a while, Xia ruofei bought some New Year’s toys to give to Lin Qiao. He also bought a few bags of milk powder for the puppies. Then, Xia ruofei went to a nearby pharmacy to buy some nutritional supplements before driving to the county hospital. After parking the car at the county hospital, Xia ruofei carried the gifts and went straight to the inpatient department. He heard from Cao tieshu that his wife had injured her bone, so she must be hospitalized. After Xia ruofei entered the inpatient department, he took out his phone and was about to call Cao tieshu to ask which Ward he was in. At this moment, Xia ruofei heard a commotion from the corridor on the first floor of the inpatient department. Among them was Cao tieshu’s angry and loud voice ...
