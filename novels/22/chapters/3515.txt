Chapter 3516: An unexpected reunion (1)

Translator: 549690339

The next morning, Xia ruofei flew the black Phoenix flying ship to the capital city alone.

He did not look for Song Wei directly. After contacting her last night, he knew that she had some things to do today. A few other dormitory mates wanted to have a meal together. Since Song Wei would be returning to San Shan after the new year, it could be considered a farewell meal for the semester. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The next semester would be Song Wei’s last semester as a master’s student. She didn’t have any courses, and her supervisor wouldn’t give her any research tasks. Her most important job was to complete her graduation thesis.

In fact, master’s students had already started preparing for their graduation thesis. Some of them had already decided on their direction as soon as they entered the school. The entire master’s stage was preparing for this thesis. Song Wei had also been preparing for half a year. Her main task in the next semester was to complete this thesis, so she had more freedom.

Xia ruofei first went back to the courtyard house in liuhai Lane. After all, this was his home in the capital and he had not been back for two to three months.

Wu Qiang and the others maintained the courtyard house very well, and everything was in order.

Xia ruofei considered that he might not return to the courtyard house during the spring Festival, so he simply gave Wu Qiang and the other staff a thick year – end red packet each. Then, he told Wu Qiang to arrange for one or two people to stay behind. The others should go home for the new year, so there was no need to stay here.

Of course, the people who stayed behind would also receive a generous salary compensation.

The salaries of Wu Qiang and the others were paid by the peach blossom company. Xia ruofei had informed Feng Jing in advance and asked the finance department to calculate their Spring Festival overtime pay according to the upper limit.

After settling the siheyuan, Xia ruofei called song Rui, Zhao Yongjun, and the others to meet at the Paradise Club.

This time, Xia ruofei had disappeared for two to three months. His brothers were very surprised when they received his call. They all said that they wanted to have a few drinks with Xia ruofei that night. Even Liu Jian, who happened to be out of town, was clamoring to buy plane tickets and fly back immediately. Of course, Xia ruofei quickly stopped him and told him that he was just having a meal with his brothers. He would be returning to the three mountains very soon, so there was no need to make such a big fuss.

In the afternoon, Xia ruofei took a break in the courtyard house. Fie only left the courtyard house at around four in the afternoon and headed to the Taoyuan club in the suburbs of the capital.

Xia ruofei did not let Wu Qiang drive. Instead, he drove the Elfa van that he had left behind in the courtyard house to the Paradise clubhouse.

The traffic in the capital had always been congested. However, Xia ruofei had left the city earlier than the rush hour, so the journey was relatively smooth.

Xia ruofei arrived at paradise clubhouse at FiveO’ clock.

The license plate of the Elfa van had already been registered in the Paradise clubhouse, so the access control system automatically lifted the bar after identifying the license plate.

When Xia ruofei drove to the main building, Zhao Yongjun, song Rui, and the others were already waiting for him.

Xia ruofei parked the car in front of the building and got out of the car with a smile on his face.

Zhao Yongjun stepped forward and said happily,””Ruofei, you haven’t been to the capital in a long time! Have you forgotten about your brothers?”

Xia ruofei hugged Zhao Yongjun and smiled.””How can I? Some time ago, I was so busy with worldly affairs that I didn’t even have the time to manage the company at San Shan … See, I just arrived in Beijing today, and 1 immediately got my brothers to come!”

“This is not bad!” Zhao Yongjun patted Xia ruofei’s shoulder and smiled.

Xia ruofei looked at song Rui and said with a smile,””Xiao Rui has been in the capital all this time?”

“Yeah!” Song Rui nodded. I’m working in my family’s company, so I’ll probably be spending most of my time in Beijing.”

Xia ruofei nodded. It seemed like song Rui had really changed. In the past, he would definitely not want to stay under the old man’s nose. Now, it was obvious that because Zhuo Yiyi was working in the capital, he had started to obediently stay in the capital.

“It seems that 1’11 be able to attend your wedding very soon!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”remember to inform me when the time comes! If you can’t get in touch with me, send the invitation to the Paradise Corporation. They have a way to get in touch with me!”

Song Rui said with a bitter smile,”ruofei, we’re not even married yet!” It’s too early to say this!”

“There’s resistance from your family?”Xia ruofei asked, stunned.

Zhao Yongjun laughed.’There’ll definitely be resistance, but Xiao Rui is very determined this time. We’re quite impressed!”

“Big brother Zhao, don’t make fun of me!” Song Rui smiled bitterly and said,”the pressure at home isn’t too great yet. I don’t know if I can handle it if it’s serious!”

“Tell me in detail later. 1’11 see if 1 can help!” Xia ruofei said after a moment of silence.

Zhao Yongjun hesitated.”Ruofei, I know that you have a say in elder song’s matters, but you have to think about this carefully. I’m just worried that you won’t be able to help Xiao Rui and might even ruin our relationship.”

Everyone knew that elder song liked Xia ruofei and valued him a lot. However, since this was a family matter, song Rui’s marriage should have been arranged long ago. Even if there were no other arrangements, he wouldn’t let him marry a commoner. If Xia ruofei were to be the one to persuade him, it might not be effective. It might even cause the song family to have an opinion of Xia ruofei and it would not be worth it..
