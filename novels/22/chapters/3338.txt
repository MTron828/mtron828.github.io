3339 Chapter 1817 – fight to the death (1)

After all, Shen tianfang was an experienced mid – Stage golden core cultivator. His cultivation was infinitely close to the late – Stage golden core. Naturally, he was not comparable to those puppets, star beasts, and Shen beasts. He immediately realized that he had fallen into a trap array.

Although Shen tianfang did not specialize in array Dao, he had done some research, and he knew that he would only sink deeper and deeper if he blindly rushed in.

Therefore, he quickly stopped and focused his attention on defense. At the same time, he used his spiritual power to check the situation of the array, hoping to use his knowledge of arrays to find a flaw in the array.

He had always treated Xia ruofei as a fish on an anvil. He thought that Xia ruofei would not be able to escape under such circumstances. However, he did not expect that the cooked duck could not only fly, but also bite him.

This bite really made him feel pain.

In fact, Xia ruofei was standing not far away from Shen tianfang. However, he was in the eye of the array, while Shen tianfang was in the trap array. Even if Xia ruofei was close, he could not see him.

Xia ruofei looked at Shen tianfang’s ashen face and felt very complicated.

Of course, he knew the cruelty of the cultivation world. In fact, wasn’t the secular world the same? The law of the jungle was the same everywhere. However, the secular world had established rules and laws to restrict them, while the cultivation world was more dependent on strength.

However, this was the first time Xia ruofei had seen a cultivator reveal their true nature.

He had no grudges with Shen tianfang. On the way to the moon, they had lived in the same small spaceship for so many days. Xia ruofei felt that the exploration team should have formed a good friendship, including Shen tianfang.

However, with enough benefits, Shen tianfang could forget about all these.

Naturally, Xia ruofei was not an easy person to deal with. If people showed him respect, he would show them respect. However, if someone had already started to take his life, he would not be much more merciful.

Moreover, Shen tianfang was an elder of the first heaven society. Now that the two of them had become mortal enemies, it did not matter who was right or wrong. What was important was that if Shen tianfang made it out alive, Xia ruofei would face endless trouble. Moreover, he had a good relationship with Chen Xuan. If he turned against the first heaven society, even Chen Xuan would be in a difficult position.

Therefore, the moment Shen tianfang revealed his killing intent towards Xia ruofei, the outcome was already decided. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

One of the two had to stay in this trial space forever.

Xia ruofei believed from the beginning that he would not be the one who was left behind.

Now, he was standing not far from Shen tianfang. He looked at him silently for a few seconds, then said,””Elder Chen, you’ve said so much just now, but there’s one thing that reminded me. Killing people in this small space is really undetectable. When we go out, everyone will think that I was killed because I was not strong enough and won’t suspect me ...”

Shen tianfang looked around. Under the effect of the formation, Xia ruofei’s voice seemed to be coming from all directions. Shen tianfang could not find Xia ruofei’s location by his voice.

He shouted with a ferocious expression,”Xia ruofei, I admit that I underestimated the enemy!” I didn’t expect you to have a backup plan!”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”I’ve always been a cautious person. Sometimes, I’m even too cautious.” However, it turned out that being overly cautious was better than being careless! If I hadn’t been careful today, I’m afraid I would have died on the spot!”

Xia ruofei’s words were naturally somewhat exaggerated because he had the spirit painting scroll as his last life – saving measure.

However, in terms of strength, Shen tianfang was much stronger than Xia ruofei. Without the help of the formation, Xia ruofei would not be able to defeat Shen tianfang.

If he had to hide in the spirit map space, it meant that the situation was very serious. He would lose the initiative and Xia ruofei could not guarantee that he would be able to hide the spirit map scroll without Shen tianfang noticing.

In fact, the possibility of this was almost zero. Shen tianfang was an experienced cultivator. As long as he saw a spirit map scroll, he would definitely not treat it as a rare item like the nascent soul realm puppet on the first floor of the trial Pagoda.

With Shen tianfang’s experience, he could definitely tell how precious the scroll was. He could even guess that Xia ruofei was most likely hiding in the scroll space.

In that case, Xia ruofei would be trapped in the space forever. On the other hand, Shen tianfang could study the spirit map scroll anytime and anywhere. One day, this last protective barrier would also be broken.

Therefore, the trap & kill array that Xia ruofei left behind was a stroke of genius. Now, the situation had been completely reversed.

Shen tianfang sneered,”it’s too early for you to be happy!” It was just a trap array! It can make you so full of yourself? If you want to kill me, just relying on this formation is not enough! When I find a flaw and break through the formation, you’ll know what despair is!”

Until now, Shen tianfang only felt that he was slightly passive, but the overall situation had not changed.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”feel despair?” I’ll give you this opportunity! You’ll feel it soon ...”

At this time, Shen tianfang’s body burst out and he pounced towards his right side. He deliberately made Xia ruofei talk more, in fact, he was trying to find Xia ruofei’s true position. It was only when he thought that he was certain that he suddenly launched an attack and wanted to catch Xia ruofei off guard.
