Chapter 895: A strange poison (2)

“She fell unconscious for the first time two months ago, and the frequency of fainting is getting higher and higher ...” Song Qiming quickly replied.

Song Qiming could not help but frown. He looked worried and continued,””In the first month, she fainted twice, but this month ... Including today, it’s the fourth time. The last time she fainted was four days ago ...”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,””Looks like it’s getting more and more serious.”

Fang Liyun, who had been maintaining a half – squatting position, also asked,”Doctor Xia, do you have any way to treat Weiwei’s condition?”

Xia ruofei smiled. Just as he was about to speak, Song Wei’s eyelashes suddenly moved. She frowned and let out a long sigh. She slowly opened her eyes.

Fang Liyun’s eyes turned red and she quickly shouted,””Wei Wei, Wei Wei, you’re awake! Do you know? You fainted again just now, and you scared mom to death ...”

Song Wei shook her head lightly, her face revealing a trace of confusion and helplessness.

Yesterday, she knew that her father had hired another doctor for her today. In the morning, she was resting in her room. When she heard her mother calling her at the door, she got up and walked out. She didn’t expect that after taking two steps, she felt her vision go black and then she lost consciousness.

If I’m not wrong, this should be the fourth time she’s fainted this month, right? Song Wei sighed to herself. She felt that she was slowly following in the footsteps of the male archeologists. She did not know when she would fall into the endless darkness and never wake up again.

So far, there had been no progress in all the treatments and examinations. What happened to the male team members today would be Song Wei’s tomorrow.

Death wasn’t scary. What was scary was the process of sliding towards death step by step. It was especially so when one clearly knew where the problem was but couldn’t stop this process at all. It felt like one’s life was counting down every day. This kind of situation was the most terrifying.

Even though Song Wei was an independent girl, she still felt helpless in this situation.

Although song Qiming was also looking at his daughter with concern, he still noticed something. This time, her daughter was in a coma for a much shorter time than the last time.

The first time Song Wei was unconscious, it lasted for about five minutes. After that, the duration of her unconsciousness became longer and longer. Four days ago, she took a full 15 minutes before she woke up.

Today, from the moment they entered the house to Fang Liyun’s exclamation, to Xia ruofei running upstairs to save her, and then to Song Wei waking up, the entire process only took about four to five minutes. It was much shorter than the last time.

Song Qiming immediately realized that this must have something to do with the medicine that Xia ruofei had fed Song Wei.

Song Qiming was suddenly filled with hope. If the medicine was effective, did that mean that Xia ruofei had a way to cure Song Wei’s poison?

Song Qiming looked at Xia ruofei with a burning gaze and asked,””Ruofei, after taking your medicine, Wei Wei’s unconscious period has shortened significantly. You must have a way to get rid of the poison in her body, right?”

Fang Liyun immediately realized this and quickly said to Xia ruofei,””Ruofei, you have to save Weiwei ... You ... Do you have any more of that potion?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Secretary song, Auntie, I’ve done a preliminary examination. The poison in the patient’s body is very well hidden, but at the same time, it’s very dangerous. It’s indeed quite tricky. However, I already have a preliminary idea of the treatment. I’ll think about it when I go back and perfect it. Then, I’ll make the medicine and send it to you!”

It was an emergency just now, so Xia ruofei had used the spirit Heart Flower petal solution. He could only take out the pill concocted by Xia Qing when it was time for actual treatment.

Otherwise, it would not make sense for him to prepare the right medicine without even seeing the patient.

“Okay, okay, then I’ll have to trouble you!” Song Qiming said quickly.

Song Wei only noticed Xia ruofei then. Her beautiful eyes were filled with curiosity. She was surprised to see that the doctor her father mentioned yesterday was so young!

Xia ruofei was not a luxurious person. He always put cleanliness and comfort as his top priority. Today, he was wearing a simple T – Shirt, jeans and white canvas shoes. They were not branded and did not cost more than a thousand Yuan.

However, he had absorbed the petals of the spirit Heart Flower in the early stages, and later on, he had continued to drink the body tempering soup and the spirit nurturing soup. His entire temperament had unconsciously become transcendent.

Her refreshing short hair, a simple T – Shirt, jeans, and white canvas shoes gave people a very comfortable and intimate feeling.

Song Wei couldn’t help but look at Xia ruofei a few more times. After all, even the Chinese medicine master from yesterday could not do anything about the poison in her body. Her father had actually invited him to treat her today. This meant that he must have real skills.

However, since when did China have such a young Chinese medicine expert? VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Archeologists were always curious about everything. Hence, Song Wei was already curious about Xia ruofei.

The poison in her body acted up without any warning. She was fine one moment, but she would suddenly lose consciousness the next. However, when she woke up, she would be like a normal person. Even the most advanced equipment could not detect any abnormalities.
