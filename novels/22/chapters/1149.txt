Zhao Yongjun would help with the transfer.

Even Wu shuheng didn’t plan to stay in China for long. He had already made an appointment with the notary and was ready to notarize it. He would entrust the transfer of ownership to Zhao Yongjun and then he would leave China the next day.

From a legal point of view, Zhao Yongjun could completely represent Wu shuheng in the transfer of ownership.

When Xia ruofei and Wu shuheng came back from the bank, the chef Zhao Yongjun hired had arrived too. There were three of them in total. They knew in advance that there was going to be a barbecue party, so they brought a lot of ingredients, all suitable for barbecue.

The chef was busy setting up the barbeque rack by the pool, while Zhao Yongjun and song Rui were helping to set up tables, plastic chairs, and so on. Song Rui, who liked to join in the fun, even brought out the high – end sound system in the house. He connected it to the computer and started to play music.

Then, he found some light belts and set them up in the yard. Although the sky wasn’t dark yet, the pool already had the atmosphere of a party.

After confirming that Zhuo Yiyi would be coming over, this fellow’s enthusiasm was immediately aroused.

Xia ruofei and Wu shuheng also joined the team to help. While everyone was busy, the sky gradually darkened. The friends that Xia ruofei and song Rui had invited also started to arrive.

Tang Yitian’s family was the first to arrive.

When Tang Yitian heard that Xia ruofei had just bought this courtyard, he immediately took a look around with great interest. After seeing it, he couldn’t stop praising it. His tone was full of envy. He even said that he wanted to buy a courtyard like this in the capital so that he could return home for a vacation.

To a rich man like Tang Yitian, a hundred or two hundred million was nothing. Xia ruofei immediately asked Zhao Yongjun to help look for one, and introduced the two to each other, letting them exchange contact information.

Feng Rao and Duff, who had just finished work, went to the courtyard house together.

It was the first time that Duff had come to a courtyard in the capital city that was filled with the rich Chinese style. She was also stunned by the sight. Everything was fresh to her. She naughtily brought Tang Haoran around the front and back courtyards, having a lot of fun.

When Feng Jing found out that Xia ruofei had bought the big house and spent more than 100 million Yuan on it, she looked at Xia ruofei as if he was a wastrel.

She pulled Xia ruofei to the side and complained in a low voice,””Chairman, we still haven’t settled the funds for our company’s headquarters! You ...”

Xia ruofei laughed awkwardly and said,”Well ... I really like this house after I saw it. I didn’t think much about it and just bought it ...”

Feng Jing didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. This guy was really incompetent as the chairman! He could actually ignore such a huge matter. With this 100 million, he could build a very beautiful headquarters building in Sanshan. He actually bought a siheyuan ...

Xia ruofei quickly added,”but don’t worry. I’ll take care of the funds. It won’t delay the relocation of the headquarters. After you’re done here, go back and look for more. Let me know if you need any funds!”

Feng Rao only let him go after Xia ruofei’s promise.

Feng Jing also knew that it was too late to say anything now. This prodigal had already paid for the house and signed the contract. How could he go back on his word? Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Furthermore, Xia ruofei seemed to love this house so much. Even if he could break the contract, he would not do it, right?

Feng Jing shook her head helplessly and put the matter of the headquarters aside for the time being. She then joined the tour group ...
