Feng Rao was also worried. She nodded and said,”Yup! The shooting of promotional posters, short advertisement films, and the launch of new products could not be carried out without an image spokesperson. And time is especially tight right now ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”if you really can’t ... President Feng, you can do it yourself!” Your image and temperament are very in line with our company’s product positioning, and you’re very popular on the internet now!”

Feng Rao glared at Xia ruofei and said,””The chairman is still joking at a time like this ...”

“Hehe, I just wanted to ease the atmosphere because I saw your sad face ...” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”CEO Feng, if it really doesn’t work, we can find another spokesperson. At most, we can delay the release of the product!”

“I’m just trying to take advantage of the popularity of the last auction to launch the jaded skin ointment,”Feng Rao said with a frown. If this trend passed, the effect would be much worse. “Moreover ... Dong Xinyu’s image is more in line with the requirements. Moreover, if we were to look for another person at the last minute, those celebrities ‘schedules would be more tight. I’m afraid ...”

Feng Jing couldn’t help but sigh,””Chairman, I’ll get the marketing department to look for other candidates first. I’ll try to contact Dong Xinyu again. I still feel that she’s the most suitable candidate, but ... She’ll have to stay in the capital for the next two days.”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said nonchalantly,”I don’t have anything important to do anyway. I’ll stay and accompany you!”

Feng Rao revealed a grateful expression and said,””Thank you! Chairman, it’s my fault for not doing my job well ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said generously,””The other party changed his mind at the last minute. What does it have to do with you? Don’t think too much! Let’s have a good rest in the afternoon! I’ll treat you to dinner tonight! If there’s anything, we can talk tomorrow!”

“En!” Hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Feng Jing’s depressed mood improved a lot. She nodded heavily.

......

Xia ruofei walked Feng Jing to the door of his room and returned to his room with a bitter smile. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

He could tell that Feng Jing was quite dejected. This was also the first time Feng Jing had suffered such a setback since joining paradise Corporation.

In Xia ruofei’s opinion, it would not be a problem for the product to be released a few days earlier or later. It would be best if he could make use of the popularity of the auction. However, it would be fine if he could not make it in time. He was very confident in his product.

Of course, Feng Jing was a perfectionist who pursued perfection in her work. This could be seen from how she had tried her best to persuade Xia ruofei to come to the capital with her to discuss the endorsement contract. Everything had been planned and this was the most important part. Who would have thought that the discussion would go smoothly before they arrived in the capital and suddenly change their mind? this was indeed a big blow to Feng Jing.

Hence, Xia ruofei decided to treat her to a big meal that night, hoping to dispel her depressed mood.

Xia ruofei was not familiar with the capital. He used the computer in his room to look up the high – end restaurants in the capital, but he did not have any good choices. It was mainly because it was difficult to distinguish the authenticity of the information on the internet. The reputation of the restaurant could be faked, so he did not have much confidence.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and decided to call song Rui. This guy grew up in the capital and only followed his father to live in another city. He was a typical rich man in the capital and should know the food map of the capital very well.

Just as Xia ruofei took out his phone and was about to call song Rui, Tang Yitian’s call came in.

“Big brother Tang!” Xia ruofei answered the call with a smile.

“Ruofei, you should be in the capital by now, right?” Tang Yitian asked.

“Yup! I just checked into the hotel. ” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Which hotel are you staying at? Haoran, this kid, knows that you’re here, and he’s making a fuss about coming to pay his respects to master! “Haha ...” Tang Yitian said,”if you have a job, then another day is fine!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s okay. There was a sudden problem at work. I don’t have any plans for today.”

“Is that so?” Tang Yitian was also surprised.”What’s the problem? Can I be of any help?”

“Hehe, it’s just a small problem. It’s okay.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”big brother Tang, I live in Jing Hilton at the Wang Residence. I’m free anytime today!”

Tang Yitian saw that Xia ruofei didn’t want to talk about it in detail, so he didn’t continue to ask. He said,””I still have to attend a summit forum in the afternoon. How about this? Jennifer and I will treat you to dinner tonight!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh when he heard this. He was still thinking about where to arrange dinner! Now, there was a solution.

Hence, he smiled and said,”sure!” But big brother Tang, I still have a colleague who came here with me. It’s not good to leave her alone, so I brought her along!”

“No problem!” Tang Yitian laughed heartily. You can bring as many people as you want! Then it’s a deal! I’ll book a place and text you later!”

“Alright, see you tonight!” Xia ruofei said.

......

In the evening, the lights on the streets of Beijing were lit.

Xia ruofei and Feng Jing got off the taxi at the entrance of Zola’s restaurant, which was near the front gate.

When she heard that Xia ruofei had an appointment with a friend, Feng Jing had planned to order a meal at the hotel herself. After all, it would be uncomfortable for her to go over to a friend’s place. Moreover, although she had encountered some difficulties in the endorsement, there was still a lot of work to be done in the company. She felt that she might as well stay in the hotel and read her email instead of going out for a meal!

However, she could not stand Xia ruofei’s constant persuasion and finally came out with him.

Xia ruofei was also worried that she would be in a bad mood at the hotel alone, so he brought her out to relax.

So, even though he and Tang Yitian had agreed to meet at 6:30 am, he and Feng Jing left at 5 am. The two strolled around Qianmen Street for a while, then took a taxi to Zola’s restaurant, which wasn’t far away.

Although it wasn’t the appointed time yet, the two of them were a little tired after shopping for a while, so they decided to wait at the restaurant.

This Western restaurant was very stylish. The decoration was very exquisite, and all kinds of atmosphere lights and soothing piano music created a very warm atmosphere.

As soon as the two of them entered the restaurant, a waiter came up to them.

“Good evening, you two!” The attendant bowed slightly.

“Mr. Tang Yitian has already made a reservation,” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Please wait!” The waiter immediately checked the iPad he carried with him and immediately looked much more respectful.”So you’re Mr. Tang’s guest. This way, please!”

With that, the waiter stepped aside, made an inviting gesture, and led the two into the restaurant.

After taking a few steps, Xia ruofei realized that Feng Rao had suddenly stopped. He turned around in confusion.

Feng Rao was staring at a booth in front of her with a slight frown.

“Boss Feng, what’s wrong?” Xia ruofei asked softly.

“I saw Dong Xinyu ...” Feng Jing raised her chin and said.

“That small – time celebrity?” Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and said,”didn’t you say that she was recording a show tonight?”

Xia ruofei followed Feng Rao’s gaze and saw three people sitting in the booth. A young woman in her thirties and a girl in a white sleeveless dress were sitting on one side. Opposite them was a fat man in a suit.

The girl in a white dress and a pair of large sunglasses in the dimly lit Western restaurant was most likely the Dong Xinyu that Feng Jing had mentioned.

From the way she dressed, she should be a rather pure girl. However, Xia ruofei also knew that this was all the packaging of the entertainment company. Dong Xinyu had been walking the path of a pure girl ever since she started her career. Naturally, she had to create such an image.

“I’ll go over and say hello!”Feng Rao said with a slight frown.

Seeing that Feng Rao seemed to be very angry, Xia ruofei quickly informed the waiter and quickly followed her.

Feng Rao walked over to Dong Xinyu’s booth in a few steps and asked,””Are you miss Dong Xinyu?”

Dong Xinyu was talking to the fat middle – aged man opposite her when someone interrupted her. She was very unhappy.

She took off her sunglasses and glanced at Feng Jing.””Zola is one of the top 10 French restaurants in the capital. How can they let their fangirls in?”

“Miss Dong, you’ve misunderstood. I’m ...” Feng Rao was taken aback.

Dong Xinyu said impatiently,””Alright, alright, no need to explain! You want an autograph? Hand it over! I’ll help you sign it! But forget about taking a group photo! We’re eating!”

Feng Jing did not expect that Dong Xinyu, who always had an obedient image in public, would behave like this in private.

She smiled bitterly at Xia ruofei and said,””Miss Dong, I’m Feng Jing, the General Manager of paradise Corporation. We’ve talked on the phone.”

When Dong Xinyu heard this, an unnatural look flashed in her eyes. She then said indifferently,””Oh! So it’s President Feng ... What’s the matter?”

Feng Rao suppressed the unhappiness in her heart and said calmly,”Miss Dong, I’ve come all the way to Beijing to talk about the Dai ...”

“Let’s talk at the company tomorrow!” “I’m off work now!” Dong Xinyu interrupted Feng Jing rudely.

Feng Jing could not help but feel shocked. Dong Xinyu was the one who stood her up and said that she had an important program to film at the last minute. Now, she found out that she was not recording any program at all. Instead, she was having a meal with someone at a Western restaurant. Dong Xinyu did not seem to feel guilty at all. Instead, she acted as if it was only natural.

What kind of people were these?

Feng Jing was a very strict person. In fact, she had already reached an agreement with Dong Xinyu before she came to Beijing.

The two parties had communicated on the phone many times. Not only did Dong Xinyu’s manager speak to her, but even Dong Xinyu herself had spoken to Feng Jing. After a few phone calls, they had basically finalized the details of the cooperation.

Dong Xinyu’s manager had even charged 100000 Yuan from the Paradise Corporation in the name of “sincerity money.”

Although both parties had not signed a written agreement, the cooperation was basically settled. That was why Feng Jing had asked Xia ruofei to come along. She thought that the trip to the capital was just for show. The Chairman’s personal appearance would show that the company valued Dong Xinyu more.

He didn’t expect things to turn out this way.

Xia ruofei, who was standing at the side, could not help but frown. He stepped forward and asked,””Miss Dong, didn’t you say that you’re recording an important program tonight? You even rejected the meeting with President Feng. Why did you appear in the Western restaurant?”

Dong Xinyu was immediately displeased when she heard this. She slammed the table and shouted,””Who are you? Is it your turn to meddle in my Affairs? No rules!”
