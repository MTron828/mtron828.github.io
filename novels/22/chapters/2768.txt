The management of paradise Corporation had gotten used to Xia ruofei’s laziness. Even if he did not appear in the company for two months, no one seemed to feel that something was wrong. The company continued to operate as usual.

Of course, Feng Jing, Dong Yun, and the director of the Taoyuan pharmaceutical company, Xue Jinshan, knew very well that even if Xia ruofei did not appear in the company for half a year or even a year, he was still the soul and core of the company. Without Xia ruofei, Taoyuan pharmaceutical company would not be able to last even a month.

All the formulas in Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory were developed by Xia ruofei. Up until now, he was also the one providing the raw materials. The production process was also personally written by Xia ruofei and sealed into the computer. It could be said that without Xia ruofei, Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory would stop production at any moment.

In addition, the precious truffles, Cordyceps, and Dahongpao tea leaves were all provided by Xia ruofei.

It could be said that Xia ruofei was the core competitive force of paradise Corporation.

Hence, even though Xia ruofei had stopped managing the company, his reputation in the company had not weakened.

As soon as Xia ruofei arrived at the company, Feng Jing immediately called for a meeting with all the management to report on their work. Within half an hour, all the senior management in San Shan had arrived at the small meeting room, including Xue Jinshan, who was busy at the construction site.

Xia ruofei listened to everyone’s recent work reports and expressed his appreciation and encouragement for their work. At the same time, most importantly, he was here to solve their problems. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

If there were any unsolvable problems in the field that they were in charge of or things that required Xia ruofei’s approval, they could take advantage of this rare opportunity to raise it.

In fact, everyone had indeed accumulated a lot of problems, such as the large expenses for the purchase of vehicles and equipment, the construction funds from Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory, and the most important raw materials and medicinal herbs were about to be used up. The production scale was about to expand by several times, so Xue Jinshan had been worried all this time. It was not easy for Xia ruofei to appear, so he naturally poured out his grievances.

Xia ruofei answered everyone’s questions with a smile.

As long as the expenses were not too outrageous, he would directly sign and approve of them. In fact, Feng Jing was in charge of it. Basically, the expenses that could be reported to Xia ruofei were all relatively reasonable. Moreover, Xia ruofei had always given preferential treatment to his employees. For example, he generously agreed to the purchase of a bus as the company’s commuting vehicle or to increase the employee’s food subsidy.

Regarding Xue Jinshan’s problem, Xia ruofei gave him a calming pill and told him that the new raw materials and medicinal herbs would arrive soon. He also asked him to contact the transportation vehicle. In addition, he also readily signed and approved the funds for the pharmaceutical factory to purchase equipment.

Xia ruofei was very efficient. In less than an hour, he had answered or solved all of their questions. The company’s higher – ups were full of energy and threw themselves back into work.

Xia ruofei called Feng Jing to his office.

“Mr. Chairman,” Feng Rao said with a half – Smile,”it looks like you’re going into seclusion again?”

Xia ruofei was very efficient at the meeting today. He asked everyone to report on what they had to say. He did not use any empty words. Some of the performance reports were also as simple as possible. He did not even finish listening to the financial report and already knew the total figure.

Feng Jing knew Xia ruofei very well. She could tell that Xia ruofei’s schedule was very tight this time. He would probably disappear for many days after he appeared.

With that thought, Feng Rao couldn’t help but feel a little resentful.

Xia ruofei laughed dryly and scratched his head.””I’m sorry, sister che. I’ve been really busy recently. I really didn’t mean to be lazy. Besides, the company has been developing very well under your leadership. I’m not an expert in business management, so I’ll try not to interfere with your normal operations ...”

Feng Jing could hear the sincerity in Xia ruofei’s tone. Even though she couldn’t figure out why Xia ruofei would be so busy if she left a company with such huge potential, she was a smart woman and knew when to stop. She also knew that she couldn’t get to the bottom of things at this time.

So, Feng Jing only smiled and said,””Don’t mind me, I’m just complaining out of habit. Since you’ve handed the company over to me, I’ll definitely do my best to help you manage it. You can rest assured about that!”

“En!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”it’s all thanks to sister Che’s hard work that the company can develop to this scale today! I’m thinking of transferring some shares to you at the end of the year as a token of my gratitude ...”

Xia ruofei didn’t value worldly wealth as much as he used to. When money had accumulated to a certain extent, it was just a string of numbers. With Xia ruofei’s current wealth, he wouldn’t be able to spend it all even in ten lifetimes.

Most importantly, ever since he started on the path of cultivation, Xia ruofei felt that worldly wealth was not so important anymore. Some good cultivation resources could not be bought with money, at least not with worldly money.

Besides, if he really wanted to make a fortune, as long as he asked for it, Qingfeng Luo would definitely transfer the entire Corporation to him without hesitation. However, he did not do so.
