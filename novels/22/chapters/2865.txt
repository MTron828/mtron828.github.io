According to the rules, if a player was replaced, he would not be able to play again in the game. Even so, the player who was replaced would still sit in the substitutes ‘bench and wait for the end of the game. This was also a form of support and respect for his teammates, as well as team spirit.

Of course, no one would think that Xia ruofei had no team spirit or disrespected his teammates when he appeared on the bench. After all, he was one of the bosses of the club.

However, when everyone saw Xia ruofei directly go to the VIP box to watch the second half, they had a feeling that Yingying didn’t treat the Herona team as a dish anymore. This was undisguised contempt!

What was the underlying meaning? I only need half a long time to deal with the Herona team. In the second half, I can take a shower and sit in the stands quietly waiting for the game to end.

Many commentators could not help but laugh when they saw this scene. The Spanish fans seated near the VIP box were quite excited. Although their area was separated from the VIP box, they could not help but stand up and wave and shout in this direction to express their love for Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei saw a close – up of his VIP box on the big screen and knew that he had been a little impulsive.

Xia ruofei could not help but smile bitterly when all the fans in the stadium were waving and shouting in the direction of the VIP box, completely forgetting about the two opposing teams in the game.

Zhou leiyun laughed as he watched the show, while Song Wei and Ling Qingxue laughed so hard that they couldn’t even straighten their backs.

Xia ruofei could only stand up and wave to the two sides of the stands to show his respect to the fans. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The live broadcast camera was also broadcasting the reactions of the fans in the stands and the situation in the VIP box. For a full half a minute, the camera did not switch to the field. This was probably a very rare situation in the history of football broadcasting.

Beijing, China, PP sports studio.

The commentator, Shen fangjian, laughed and said,””It seems that Herona’s threat to the Spaniards is really too small. It took President Xia a long time to feel bored and simply run to the stands to watch the game.”

Jia Tianning added,”I saw some fans on the bullet screen saying that Xia ruofei’s behavior is disrespectful to his teammates and opponents.” I don’t know what these netizens are thinking. When our Chinese players don’t perform well, they want to criticize us. Now, we finally have a Chinese player who is performing so outstanding...No! It was two! Our players were just replaced and did not return to the substitutes ‘bench, and there were actually people who criticized them ... Had they really knelt for too long? If it were C – list, would the same person say something different and think that C – list had a personality? Domineering ...”

Jia Tianning was only a guest invited by PP sports, so he didn’t have much scruples in his words.

Shen fangjian, as the commentator for PP sports, felt that Jia Tianning’s words made sense, but he could only smooth things over,””It’s normal for the netizens to have different opinions. After all, everyone has different opinions! However, I personally think that it’s better to be more tolerant to everyone. Besides, Xia ruofei’s performance was really eye – catching. His performance in the last two matches was definitely phenomenal. Even the foreign media is doing their best to praise him. Why are we so harsh on him? This is indeed worthy of our deep thought ...”

Shen fangjian was more tactful, but his meaning was the same as Jia Tianning ‘s. To put it bluntly, he was on Xia ruofei’s side.

The match on the court had to continue, and the broadcast camera could not always be facing the stands. After the commotion, everyone finally focused on the court. Xia ruofei could finally have some time to rest.

“Director Xia,” Zhou leiyun turned around and said with a smile,”we’re definitely winning this round!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”if we still lose, then we can forget about the European war!” Next season, you should think about staying in the league!”

Espanyol already had no worries about staying in the league this season and was now working hard for the European tournament.

Zhou leiyun laughed out loud and said,”didn’t you already say that you were going to invest at least 100 million euros to bring in players after your press conference with Barcelona?” With such a large sum of signing costs, do we still have to worry about staying in the league next season?”

Xia ruofei said,”general manager Zhou, get this straight. It’s our club, not me!” I’ll only pay for the portion of money that’s equal to my shares! All the shareholders had to pay in proportion. If they didn ‘t, they would be diluting the shares! Are you willing to have your shares diluted?”

“Although I really want to say that I’m the one who can make the decision, if I’m not willing to spend a lot of money to buy the players, it’s useless even if you say it, because you and I are a team, and my decision is the final one.” Zhou leiyun chuckled and said,”but I do think your suggestion is good! So I’ll definitely fork out the money. As for the remaining few small shareholders, it would be perfect if they were not willing to pay! I was just thinking of buying more shares!”
