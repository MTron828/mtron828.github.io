Chapter 836: The snow plateau (2)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei was not familiar with aweto, so he could not identify it. However, he had his own way.

Before Xia ruofei left the house, he had taken out a lot of cash from the interspace and put it in his bag. Xia ruofei always kept a lot of cash in the interspace. Other than the fact that there was no interest, the safety and privacy of the interspace were undoubtedly better than any bank in the world.

Xia ruofei, who had a lot of money in his pocket, wandered around Nagqu County County. For most of the day, he would go to every shop that sold Cordyceps sinensis, regardless of their size, even if it was a small stall. He would chat with them and buy a small amount of it.

Xia ruofei’s behavior was no different from that of an ordinary tourist. He walked around the stalls and shops. When he bought something, he was cautious and did not buy much.

However, no one noticed that after Xia ruofei put the Cordyceps he bought into his canvas bag, they would mysteriously disappear.

In fact, Xia ruofei had sent aweto into the spirit map space.

Xia ruofei didn’t understand aweto, but Xia Qing did!

As a precious Chinese herb, Cordyceps sinensis ‘Compendium of Materia Medica had a description of its effects. The spirit map space itself was used to grow spirit herbs and herbs. As a spirit puppet that served the spirit map space, Xia Qing was naturally very clear about the identification of Cordyceps.

In fact, from the perspective of spiritual herbs, Cordyceps sinensis was just a low – end herb. However, Xia ruofei had never even heard of the more high – end herbs, let alone seen them.

On earth today, the spiritual herbs that Xia ruofei did not know the names of, even if they existed, were extremely rare and could only be found by chance.

Every time Xia ruofei sent a serving of Cordyceps, he would communicate with Xia Qing using his spiritual sense. He would have Xia Qing write a number for the caterpillar fungus in the space, record the store name of the purchase, and then identify it.

Finally, he would rank all the aweto and Xia ruofei would be able to easily determine which store had the best quality and fair price.

Xia ruofei hoped to use this stupid method to find a good business with good integrity and then proceed with the next step.

Just like that, Xia ruofei wandered around Nagqu County for the entire afternoon. In fact, he was gathering information.

This was the only way. Xia ruofei could not have been introduced by someone he knew. He had to go straight to his destination. Under the circumstances where he was not familiar with the situation, this might be a good idea.

Very quickly, Xia ruofei had visited twenty to thirty shops selling Cordyceps. He bought a small sample from each shop and sent it to the spirit map space.

By the time the sun set, Xia ruofei felt that he had visited almost all the shops that sold Cordyceps in the county. He was ready to find a hotel to stay in.

Just as Xia ruofei walked out of the last shop, he felt that someone was following him. Although the streets were bustling in the evening, The Sixth Sense of a Special Forces elite was very sharp.

Xia ruofei furrowed his brows slightly and walked faster without a sound.

He wanted to test what the person behind him was up to.

Xia ruofei didn’t expect that person to not hide anything and immediately followed him. He even called out in a low voice,””Sir, please wait a moment!”

Xia ruofei stopped in his tracks and turned around. He saw a teenager of about 14 to 15 years old walking quickly towards him. The teenager was skinny and had the Tibetan’s trademark red face. His clothes were also a little tattered.

Xia ruofei pointed at himself and asked,””You’re calling me?”

The Tibetan child nodded quickly and said in broken Chinese,””Sir, may I have a word with you?”

Xia ruofei frowned slightly. If it was any other person who had come to the unfamiliar Tibet, they would definitely not agree. However, Xia ruofei was bold and confident. He was not worried that this child would harm him.

He thought for a while and nodded. The Tibetan child immediately led the way and led Xia ruofei through the streets and alleys. Soon, they arrived at a secluded place.

Xia ruofei stopped.”What’s the matter?” he asked.”Can you tell me now?”

After the Tibetan kid left the street, he heaved a sigh of relief. He nodded and asked,””Sir, are you looking to buy Cordyceps?”

Xia ruofei squinted at the Tibetan kid and said,””You followed me?”

“No!” The Tibetan child quickly replied. No! Sir, please don’t misunderstand. I saw you coming out of several Cordyceps shops on that Street, and you bought a little bit each time. I’m guessing you must be conducting a market survey!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile and said,””You’re quite observant ... You’re right! But ... You called me here, do you also have wormgrass for sale?”

The Tibetan child nodded and said,”Yes, sir. In fact, most of the shops on that Street are controlled by the people of zashi doji. The wormgrass they sell are almost the same. Not only are they expensive, but the things they sell are also not authentic. When they see foreign guests, they often replace them with inferior wormgrass, broken grass, and hollow grass to pass off as first – Class goods.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Xia ruofei looked at the Tibetan child and waited for him to continue.

In fact, Xia ruofei was secretly nodding in his heart. The Cordyceps that he had bought in the afternoon had been appraised by Xia Qing and most of them were of poor quality. There were even a few stores that were selling counterfeits and had no Cordyceps at all.

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly to himself. It was no wonder that people were full of suspicion these days. Be it food, milk, or clothes ... Anything that could generate profit was full of fake goods.

This time, Xia ruofei had come to one of the main producing areas of the wormgrass. He did not expect to buy the same thing.

One could imagine how difficult it would be for a foreigner who didn’t know anything about wormgrass to buy authentic high – Quality wormgrass if he came here.

The Tibetan child was also secretly observing Xia ruofei’s expression, but Xia ruofei did not say anything. He felt that Xia ruofei did not seem to believe him, so he swallowed and continued,””Sir, zashi doji almost monopolized the wormgrass market in Nagqu. Even if the other wormgrass diggers had good products, they would not dare to sell them to you!”

Xia ruofei looked at the Tibetan child with a half – Smile and asked,””It sounds like this zashidoji is very powerful?”

“He’s a demon!” The Tibetan child gritted his teeth and said,”the grass diggers have gone through great hardships and even risked their lives to collect the wormgrass. He used his power and bought them at a very low price every time. Those who dared to resist him were beaten up badly by him ...”

And you still dare to sell wormgrass to me?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“Because I’m in desperate need of money!” The Tibetan child replied. Sir, I didn’t dare to call you in wormgrass Street just now. I just followed you secretly in case of being discovered by zashidoji’s men.” Sir, my father met the wolf at the foot of the snow Mountain when he was collecting wormgrass. He fell down the cliff to escape the Wolf’s pursuit and broke a leg. I had no choice but to take the risk to treat his injuries. ”

The Tibetan child’s expression was sorrowful and anyone who saw it would feel pity for him. However, Xia ruofei was as calm as an old well and his expression was very calm.

He knew that many of the scams nowadays originated from an emotional performance, and many people fell into it because of that.

The peddlers in the capital’s Pan garden could tell a story of every object on their stalls, even if the object was so fake that even a layman could tell it was fake.

Hence, Xia ruofei was not moved by the Tibetan child’s story. However, he did not forget his original intention. No matter how touching the story was, his only judgment was based on the quality of the item.

“Money isn’t a problem,” Xia ruofei said indifferently.”The prerequisite is that the quality of your wormgrass must be good enough.”
