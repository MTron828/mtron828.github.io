Translator: 549690339

However, after MA Xiong got the king’s Green glass Jade, he was in a hurry to bring his treasure back to Hong Kong, so he declined the offer.

According to Ma Zhiming, MA Xiong was planning to hold an exhibition at the flagship store of Heng Feng jewelry in Hong Kong as soon as he returned to Hong Kong. The main attraction of the exhibition would naturally be this piece of top – grade Jade.

Since MA Xiong was in a hurry to go back, Xia ruofei naturally did not ask him to stay.

The bodyguard brought over a password – protected box. MA Xiong personally put the king’s Green token into the box and cuffed his wrists. He bade farewell to Xia ruofei with the bodyguards and left the hotel in a hurry.

After MA Xiong left, the room that had been bustling with noise and excitement suddenly became quiet.

Zhao Yongjun and song Rui looked at Xia ruofei. After a while, song Rui called out,””F * ck! You’re really rich ...”

Zhao Yongjun also laughed and said,”ruofei, I didn’t expect you to pick up 180 million Yuan when I took you to pan Jiayuan to watch the fun!” No wonder you have such a big business at such a young age!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Hi!” Even the city walls can’t stop this luck! This time, I was really lucky ...”

Song Rui said enviously,”why haven’t I been this lucky?” No, no, I’m going to slaughter you today!”

“Alright! I’ll treat you to lunch!” Xia ruofei said readily,”but don’t drink too much! I still have to go look for houses in the afternoon!”

Speaking of the house, Zhao Yongjun immediately asked,””Ruofei, you asked Mr. MA to transfer the money to your domestic account. It seems like you’re ready to buy the siheyuan I mentioned?”

“Let’s take a look first!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”even if I don’t like it this time, you can help me keep an eye out in the capital. If there’s anything suitable, we’ll buy it!”

“Alright!” Zhao Yongjun readily agreed.

“You bought a courtyard house, but you have to leave a big room for me!” Song Rui shouted.

“Go, go, go! You’re everywhere!” Xia ruofei laughed and scolded him.”Your house in the capital is so big, and there are armed guards outside. You’re actually staying in my house?”

“Nonsense! Is that my house?” Song Rui said,”that’s my old man ‘s! I feel so uncomfortable in the old house, it’s like I’m in prison ...”

“Song Rui, you’re dead meat ...” Xia ruofei chuckled.”I recorded your conversation just now. I’ll play it for your old man to hear later ...”

“I’ll fight you to the death ...” Song Rui charged at him, baring his fangs and claws.

Seeing Xia ruofei and song Rui fighting, Zhao Yongjun couldn’t help but shake his head with a bitter smile. They were like two children who couldn’t grow up!

Signing the contract and transferring the money took up a lot of time. The three of them chatted in the room for a while and it was already noon.

So, they had lunch at the hotel’s restaurant.

Although he didn’t drink, song Rui ordered a lot of dishes according to the price on his iPad, starting from the most expensive one.

Even if he did not earn 180 million Yuan today, Xia ruofei would not care about this small amount of money. With his business at this level, how could he be poor from eating? Since song Rui was willing to play, Xia ruofei naturally let him.

After the meal, Xia ruofei and the other two took a car and went straight to the courtyard house in Desheng Gate’s Main Street, liuhai Lane.
